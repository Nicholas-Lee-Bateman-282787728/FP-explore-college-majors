3644014,5,B001HSX38A,"I bought the first season just to try it.  Couldn't wait to purchase season 2 and 3. I find it as  an excellant series. Martin Shaw is very good in this part.  Have purchased other series he has been in...(George Gently) and the 2 PD James stories.  Hopefully, series (seasons) 4,5,6, etc will be soon availble for US viewing. Find this series interesting of the politics of English Court and Law.
Have found several series interesting....buy first 2 or 3 season then the rest are NON USA..Wish they convert them sooner.
Saw Silent Witness on PBS, sometime ago..and still waiting to be made for USA.
Along with Blue Murder 5...New Tricks 5,6,7,etc. Also Law & Order UK season 2/3 any chance of USA???",1306281600,,700,4.666666666666667
3644015,5,B001HSX38A,"I love the character of Judge Deed. He is super smart, manipulative, intelligent and usually gets what he wants. Very entertaining. Waiting for Season Four, to arrive soon.",1304726400,,172,5.178571428571429
3644016,2,B001HSX38A,"This was not a series that I enjoyed very much. The story lines are more than a little trite, and the amount of time that the judge spends on his love life, family life and investigating the cases before him is very far fetched and unconvincing. The judge comes across as a crusading left wing judge who would love people to believe that he hates being a judge, well nobody is ""forced"" to be one, and so the obvious course of action would be to remain a modern day Rumpole of the Bailey, and always appear for the defense, for any successful barrister the money would certainly be better.",1303257600,,588,4.4036697247706424
3644017,3,B001HSX38A,"I don't know whether it is the series, or the British legal system, but I have a hard time with Judge Deed's in-court practices and his out-of-court relationships, or his meddling in the middle of a trial.  Entertaining but not the best BBC.",1302480000,3,241,4.604651162790698
3644018,5,B001HSX38A,"Sir John Deed has never fit easily into the politics which influence English justice. A champion of an independent judiciary, he is always running headlong into interference from the Home Secretary, the Lord Chancellor and the Attorney General. In Season Three his enemies, including his fellow High Court Justice and father-in-law, conspire to get him to resign. Told he could be removed by Parliament, he cheerfully reminds his persecutors that such has not happened since 1830.

Martin Shaw is an astonishingly good actor, who can command a scene with a slight raise of an eyebrow. His personal causes-animal rights and vegetarianism-are on full display, an indication of his importance to this series. Judge Deed is a target for his independence, something American judges expect as a matter of course. Consequently this series may be seen as a plea for a totally separate third branch of government. Whether it had any role in the constitutional reforms that took judges out of the House of Lords and under the authority of the new Supreme Court of the United Kingdom is an open question. If so then this may well be one of the most important television series in history.

As usual Deed's cases in the High Court are the most challenging- a cellphone entrepreneur who killed a young family (while talking on his cellphone) and a woman accused of killing her abusive husband with a baseball bat. That leaves my final question, why do British murderers use so many baseball bats? Why not cricket bats?",1299974400,10,1505,4.944664031620554
3644019,5,B001HSX38A,"First, I will preface my review by explaining that we bought a region free/code free DVD player so that we can play all those wonderful quality British productions.

JUDGE JOHN DEED
Every episode in the Judge John Deed series is intelligent, top- notch drama with an ongoing romance. It is particularly interesting to see how the British courtroom system works. The  behind the scenes interaction between the judges, high court judges, police and the Head of Chancellory operates The courtroom drama is often riveting. It is entirely refreshing to watch dramas dealing with such a variety of subjects instead of the same old thing on N.A. television, i.e. drugs, rape and drugs and more drugs. To be sure, Judge John Deed does have cases on those subjects but they are not the rule. I bought the pilot and series 1. I have been recording the show for the past year and a half on the BBC channel. (details below)

The subjects include murder, hit and run by a diplomat who subsequently feigns a mental breakdown, cell phones implicated in illness (The cell phone manufacturer has huge government contracts. Will Deed allow justice to be perverted?), incest, mature child refuses transplant, someone blows up a lab hoping animal rights movement will be blamed, revenge killing,
an au pair charged in death of infant, war crimes trial at The Hague, homosexual charged with theft by his partner and the defendant ends up murdered, a government official takes his wife to court so their child can be innoculated (or 'jabs' as the  British call it). They still share the same roof. Mom has her experts and dad has his, and a host of other subjects. The best part is to watch just how the judge ingeniously gets at the truth of each case while not allowing himself to be bullied or entrapped by corrupt officials. Trust me, I haven't told the half.

Judge Deed's daughter is a new lawyer, his ex-wife is a lawyer who's fiancee is in the British cabinet. Her dad is a very colourful high court judge, and his past (and undercover) sweetheart is a criminal lawyer. The judge enjoys the ladies, but is cool. The actors are some of the best and well known British actors. There are noticeably many people of colour used in this series representing all professions and walks of life.

Martin Shaw also had a juicy major role as the Head Secret Police Chauvelin in The Scarlet Pimpernel with Richard E. Grant and Elizabeth McGovern. Jenny Seagrove (Jo Mills) has played in Sherlock Holmes (Jeremy Brett), also the lead role in the trilogy of Barbara Taylor Bradford's A Woman of Substance with Liam Neeson and Deborah Kerr, Claire Bloom and Barry Bostick. This was followed up with ""Hold the Dream"" and finally ""To Be The Best with Lindsay Wagner, Anthony Hopkins, Christopher Cazanove, and a host of other fine actors.

3644033,5,B001HSX38A,"Martin Shaw is a versatile and engaging actor.  In John Deed he gets to play a man with lots of challenges, an ex-wife, a naive, not too bright daughter, smart and dedicated love interest (Jenny Seagrove).  The encounters in the court are much more interesting in England. THe judge is really part of the procedure. Good usually triumphs over evil, but there is plenty of evil to keep the story going to the next episode.  Our son-in-law seldom watches anything but sports and has a real challenge with anything with a plot, but he loves this series!",1367625600,,550,4.649484536082475

Before I purchase anything from another vendor, I check Amazon - most of the time the price is lower or equal.  Amazon gives superior service, whether it be shipping (always timely and packaged well) or on returns; in addition, their website is easy to follow.  I certainly hope they will continue to offer all those wonderful BBC and Masterpiece programs, especially the mysteries.  There is no equal to an English mystery.",1320451200,4,499,4.8352941176470585

8309529,5,B001HSX38A,"All 6 series of Judge John Deed played by Martin Shaw are excellent top notch shows. If you enjoy courtroom drama the entire series is well worth the watch.

8309535,5,B001HSX38A,"This series is superb. Each show explores an interesting legal case and/or social issue. Complex characters and issues that are current and difficult. Our judge is usually on an easily determined ethically justified position, but not always. Sometimes it's not so clear. The government is the bad guy--usually the government or opposition forces are portrayed as evil buffoons, but there is still plenty of gist in the plot to chew over. Very enjoyable show.",1436572800,3,458,5.202702702702703
