2099981,3,B0002KGYT4,"The DVD cannot be played in the US for Region 1.  Initially, I was planning on returning it, then I bought a DVD player that will play and convert PAL (Region 2) to NTSC TV (Region 1).  I love the movie too much to return it.",1358899200,2,225,3.869565217391304
2099982,5,B0002KGYT4,"Along with Marx Brothers movies, this movie ranks as one of the funniest I have ever seen. The plot is simple and slapstick, and one can figure out how it will end; nevertheless it is full of laughs. Louis de Funes makes the movie what it is.  He is a brilliant comedian/actor and his rubber-like facial expressions in trying to convey to a toll taker that he is being hijacked is priceless, as is his getting caught in a bubble gum machine. Reminds me of Woody Allen in ""Sleeper"" only de Funes is a much funnier character.",1357516800,,523,4.391752577319588

8028323,5,B0002KGYT4,"A cult film - timeless, beyond generation gaps & politically correct. Quite the opposite; it's always making more sense. You can watch it over and over again and still laugh to tears. It's probably De Funes's best performance, ever.",1481500800,,232,4.9743589743589745
