1835989,4,B00008DDSK,"At the end of the second season of ""Farscape"" John Crichton (Ben Browder) was on an operating table with the top of his skull off as Scorpius (Wayne Pygram) has interrupted the surgery to remove the neural chip from his brain and Aeryn Sun (Claudia Black) was killed when she was trapped in her ejector chair that crashed into the freezing water on the planet below. Little did we know that the themes of death and seaparation were going to be so powerfully strong during the third season, the first four episodes of which are to be found on these two DVDs:
Episode 301, ""Season of Death"" (Written by Richard Manning, Aired March 16, 2001) has the good news that Scorpius' neural chip has finally been removed from Chrichton outweighed by the fact he can not speak, a ""clone"" of the personality of Scorpius remains in his mind, and Aeryn is dead awaiting a Peacekeeper's funeral. Although Moya's crew makes a series of touching farewells to Officer Sun, Zhaan (Virginia Hey) has an idea. On the one hand bringing back the leading lady of the series from the dead was a bit too easy, but on the other it is clear in retrospect that we are being set up for a series of much more permanent demises by the end of the season (Four Wormholes).
Episode 302, ""Suns and Lovers"" (Written by Justin Monjo, Aired March 23, 2001), as the title indicates, is a pun on the infamous D.H. Lawrence novel and on target because the lovers end up being Chiana (Gigi Edgley) and Jothee, son of D'Argo (Anthony Simcoe). The main plot has to do with Moya's crew heading to a Commerce Station to spend their spoils, but a violent storm of unnatural origin hits the station. This episode strikes me as more clearing of the decks in terms of stamping out D'Argo's brief period of happiness, which does not strike me as being particularly necessary, although Chiana's motivations for the betrayal are a nice character touch (3 Wormholes).
Episode 303, ""Self Inflicted Wounds, Part 1: Could'a, Would'a, Should'a"" (Written by David Kemper, Aired March 30, 2001) sets up a new problem for the crew when an alien vessel collides with Moya and the two ships sort of merge with each other. However, the more important concern is for Zhaan: it seems that bringing back Aeryn from the dead by performing Unity is costing the priestess her own life. Her only hope is to buried in special soil, which means finding the right sort of planet. Meanwhile, Crichton's hopes are raised by the ""appearance"" of the Three Stooges (4 Wormholes).
Episode 304, ""Self Inflicted Wounds, Part 2: Wait for the Wheel"" (Written by David Kemper, Aired April 6, 2001), picks up with Zhaan dying, Moya dying, and Pilot in a coma. Breaking away from the wormhole has not solved all of their problems. This becomes a pivotal episode in the ""Farscape"" series, which no doubt caught many viewers by surprise since it was only the fourth episode of the season and we have a major shake up in the cast of the series. I have to admit, I did not think this was a permanent event until I was about halfway through the third season. A memorable episode in a season that will be providing even bigger changes (5 wormholes).
These early episodes from Season 3 are transitional stories that resolve or reset many of the elements from the previous season. But they also set the stage for the two dominant themes of this third season, both of which will be brought home with some of the show's most powerful episodes.",1067385600,19,3444,4.629084967320262
1835990,5,B00008DDSK,"The beginning of the third season of Farscape produced some of the best episodes of the series.  To me, this is one of the most entertaining and well made science fiction series ever produced. It was extremely disappointing to find that it was cancelled.  However, the DVD collections of all the seasons is something that every fan will want. Admittedly, some episodes are more interesting than others, but each tells a small part of the Farscape saga and is well worth watching. The interpersonal relationships continue to develop and we see some of the strangest aliens ever seen on a tv screen.  Let's hope that someone decides to bring this series back with all the characters and story lines intact.",1052524800,4,704,4.85
1835991,5,B00008DDSK,"With season 3 we witness the collison of the bulk of the conflicts at the end of two: Crichton fights and wins a Pyretic victory over ""Harvey"" the neural clone of Scorpi flitting about in his head; Someone close to the crew dies and there are some unexpected departures.
I'd have to agree that Season of Death is one of the show's strongest opening episodes. It manages to build on the established story arcs of both seasons 1 and 2. The writing became more consistent as the character's backstories finally stablized. That also gave the actor's considerably more confidence in their roles as well. The visuals are, as always stunning.
The arrival on the production staff of a number of Next Generation and DS9 vets (including Richard Manning and Naren Shanker) also brought considerable depth and experience to the production side. While staff writers like Andrew Prowse have done a terrific job with the series, the Next Gen folks provided a different perspective that allowed the conflicts and emotional attachments of the characters additional depth.
The DVD's have been improving since the season one batch. Season two still had a number of great extras and the main issue--the DVD menu--has been improved somewhat as well. My only complaint is the focus on a bit too many bottle shows during season three. I realize it's a way to save money and budget out for the bigger episodes but, well, Moya's confined space makes it a bit difficult to continue to come up with strong story ideas. Still, to their credit, the Farscape production crew, staff and actors manage to pull it off.
If you're checking out the series for the first time, I'd suggest going back to the highlight set for season one (or better yet pick up the entire boxed set) and then move forward. There's a number of loose plot ends that are tied up in both seasons 2 & 3.",1047168000,14,1842,4.72360248447205
1835992,4,B00008DDSK,"This DVD set will bring you the first four episodes of Farscape's third season.  In season's one and two, Farscape's first few episodes were a mixed bag of good to mediocre installments.  That trend ends with the first four episodes of the third season.  The following is a brief summary and review of each:
Season of Death-The season premiere sees Crichton left incapacitated, while the rest of the crew attempt to save him. That becomes difficult when a Scarren arrives on the scene looking for Crichton, while at the same time, Scorpius manipulates the situation behind the scenes. This episode also sees Crichton confront and win a victory of the neural clone in his head, and the return of a friend thought to be dead by the crew (though we the fans knew she couldn't be really dead).  This is an action packed adventure episode with compelling emotional drama, and one of Farscape's best installments.
Suns and Lovers-D'Argo intends to ask Chiana to marry him, but finds out she has been sleeping with D'Argo's son, Jothee, sending D'Argo and his crewmates on an emotional roller coaster.  In the meantime, Crichton and crew attempt to stop a religious fanatic from destroying a station full of people, and on the way, Aeryn and Crichton have a discussion about relieving some tensions.  All in all, a bit of a soap opera like episode, but still an excellent episode.
Self Inflicted Wounds, Parts 1&2-This two part adventure sees Moya collide and become entangled with an alien ship that travels through wormholes.  Crichton attempts to use the opportunity to learn about wormholes, but things get tense when a monster appears on the scene and Moya is sabotaged by an apparently invisible opponent.  In order for the crew to escape, on the crew must sacrifice his or her life to save everyone else.  This story was a little difficult to follow at times, but was an incredibly compelling drama with plenty of action along the way.  The end of the story will leave you reeling from the emotional impact.
All of these episodes are definitely representatives of some of Farscape's trully excellent work, with Season of Death being an example of Farscape at its best.  Don't miss this set of fantastic Farscape episodes!",1043884800,25,2221,4.864721485411141
1836055,5,B00008DDSK,"One of the top 3 series every made in my view. Great characters, great story line, and the action...",1210809600,,100,4.315789473684211
1836056,4,B00008DDSK,"The start of the season left me in suspense as I have been waiting for some John/Aeryn action since before I even picked up the series. I feel like everything is a bit of a tease- when will they REALLY get together, what's going to happen with Zhaan, what will D'Argo do about Chiana as time goes on? I've nearly completed the second disc for now, but it's captured me a lot quicker than season 2 did. And the cover is definitely not deceiving as this part of the season indeed focuses a lot on Zhaan and Aeryn",1210204800,,510,4.214285714285714
1836057,3,B00008DDSK,"I love Farscape, so any review I do about them that has less than five stars hurts me.  But I have to say, the double sided DVDs sometimes seem to freeze or skip.  Not alot or I would have demanded a replacement, not that there are any, but double sided DVDs are just not the best way to get a show out to the public, even if it somehow makes them cheaper.
On the other hand there were a lot more extras in the Starburst edition than the other DVDs and the other seasons are available to get NEW, not used, so I am looking forward to the other seasons.  Too bad the first season is so hard to get and costs so much.  More people would become Fans and spend more money on the DVDs.",1205020800,2,680,3.9779411764705883
1836058,5,B00008DDSK,Farscape is tied with Red Dwarf and the Stargates as one of my favorite shows of all time. I love the starburst editions for their price and the considerably smaller shelf space compared to the previous release of Farscape on DVD. My one complaint is the cases are [...]. Most of the cases for the starburst collection have 1-3 disc hubs broken. I forget where but I eventually found the case manufacturer and was able to order repacements. The replacements were the exact size but the disc hubs had been greatly improved.,1178496000,,522,4.684782608695652

I eventually bought the entire collection at once.

The only reason I gave this a 4 out of 5 stars, is because of the quality of the DVD. The inner clips of the box break very easily. The DVD always defaults back to subtitles between episodes, which is really annoying.

Even with the problems of the DVD, I love this set.",1175472000,,476,4.266666666666667

1836063,5,B00008DDSK,"After many complaints, ADV has chosen to re-release all of Starburst Seasons 1 and 2 on SINGLE SIDED disks. The positive effects that come from this change are many:

1. DVD quality is No Longer low. Disks play well, no glitches, no freezes, etc.

2. The titles of the episodes are marked clearly on each disk. No need to squint and rotate the DVD as you try to read some tiny font.

3. No need to flip the disk over when you want to watch other episodes. This is mostly beneficial to the people who own DVD players that can hold multiple disks at once.

4. Disk artwork :-D

There are then, certain faults that result from the change as well, all dealing with packaging quality:

--> Disks are stored in such a way that 2 are attached to each side of the DVD case. This means that in order to get to the disk at the bottom, you first have to remove the one at the top. If this isn't annoying enough, it turns out that all of the DVD buttons that hold the top disks don't work very well. Pushing the button doesn't pop the disks out as there are other plastic pieces that hold it in place. You have to push those with your fingers in order to get a disk out, and that can get really painful. If you're not careful, you might very well break a DVD in half.

My personal solution was to go and get my own DVD cases that worked properly. Having to find multi-disk cases with identical dimensions as that of the ADV ones shouldn't be that difficult. Also try to find ones that have clippings for literature, if you want to keep one in your DVD case. This Starburst release comes with a separate page listing disk content/episode synopsis, but there's no where to adequately store it.

-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_

Having that said, the content of the Starburst itself is excellent. As you know, all of the extra features from the original releases, plus many new ones (mainly the commentaries) are included. Subtitles have finally become available, and some disks don't have those annoying ADV commercials that blighted each of the original Farscape releases.

As for the quality of the show itself, that's something I won't discuss. If you haven't made up your mind about whether you like/dislike the series, then you've probably read enough reviews to get an idea of what most audience think about Farscape. I personally feel that Starburst Collection 1.3 contains the best lot of the episodes in the first Season.",1153440000,9,2401,4.524249422632795
1836064,4,B00008DDSK,"The Farscape episodes are excellent and deserve 5 stars.

The case however is still problematic. The Single sided disks are an improvement, but the little pieces of plastic that holds the DVDs break in transit and 2 DVDs ended rattling around in the case. Same problem with other Season 3 cases. Which is why in summary the collection only gets 4 stars.",1145577600,6,353,4.693548387096774
1836105,3,B00008DDSK,"I was horrified when Amazon sent me Farscape Starburst Season 3, Collection 1 in the 1 sided 4 disk DVD format.  The only reason that I decided to collect Farscape is that the double sided was so cool and compact allowing it to fit into my DVD library. Now there will be a transition in the middle of the collection.  I will not buy anymore Farscape collections unless they go back and redo them to the original 2 sided disk format.  Very very sad.",1136851200,,448,4.309523809523809
1836106,5,B00008DDSK,"Finally, I can give this series 5 stars. As with many other people, the first 6 collections were very problematic, freezing, skipping, popping or just flat out not playing. While some die hard fans mark my reviews unhelpful as I report the disc quality and not the quality of the show! (I figure you know what you are buying! and would better like to know the quality of what you are getting.) The series is a solid 5 in my book, and has always been so, but not the first 6 collections due to the double sided, dual layer format that caused so many to be returned, as with other folks here I too had to return 4 of the 6 before I was able to get a collection that would play properly. WITH THIS COLLECTION ... ADV finally saw the light! They released the collection on single sided disc, and while I'm not happy with ADV as I asked if there was a problem with them long, long ago and they just acted as if it was the first time they heard anything. I had to contact them as I was having trouble getting a RMA AGIAN for a bad disc, by correcting the release and putting them on 4 disc instead of 2 they have all but admitted there was in fact a PROBLEM! Even though they would not admit it months ago. I even have an email from them stating there was no plan to release them on 4 disc! I guess they got as tired of complaints as buys got of returning them. The single sided collection is far better than the prior as you would think in quality, no skipping, no popping, no freezing, nothing but good solid Farscape fun and entertainment, without having to try and skip over bad spots or fiddle with to get it to play.
We can only hope that ADV will offer a trade in offer on those releases already out to upgrade to the problem free collection. Sure it will cost them money, but it cost those of us with bad disc time and money to find one(s) that worked. (A 80 mile roundtrip drive for me in rural Kentucky) The very least they could do is to offer a replacement collection at cost for the first 6 collections. As of this writing I do not know if they plan to release the first 6 collections (2 seasons) on single sided disc or not, however a wise company would. My guess is you will find a lot of 2 disc collections on eBay if they do. Again a great series finally on enough disc to justify buying it. Plenty of extras over the boxset releases, albeit again many are repeated from disc to disc and collection to collection, overall good video and audio quality for hours of viewing. Well worth adding to your collection for those Farscape fans, just hope the first 6 releases are corrected and re-issued.",1136678400,17,2605,4.222444889779559
1836107,5,B00008DDSK,"of the poor quality of the DVD 18s, those notoriously horrid double sided pieces of crap.  There have been tons of problems concerning damage to these double sided disks, specifically the Farscape Starburst Editions and the show American Gothic.  The change was welcome, simply because I had received one of those screwed up disks, and I would have liked it if they had not been damaged.  If your disk is damaged, return it or buff it.  Unfortunately, when the 18s get damaged bad enough, they are useless, and they are damaged VERY easily.",1136592000,2,540,4.774193548387097
1836108,3,B00008DDSK,"I love Farscape and was really enjoying the Starburst editions.  I started off buying the original releases but finally gave up with the price going higher and higher on them and even Best Buy hardly ever getting the new releases when they came out.  Just like the original release though the packaging gets changed up for some stupid reason or another.  I never had a faulty disk until they changed up the packaging this time and now have four disk instead of two double sided.  I just got season 3 collection 1 in today and right off heard at least one disk rattling around inside.  I'm just not a fan and never have been of the double think cases.  They take up twice the room and I've always had a hard time getting them that didn't have a loose disk.  I may or may not finish off the Starburst set now but so far the company that puts out Farscape has constantly changed things up over and over just to make a buck and throw off the buyers.  crappy, crappy way of handeling things.",1136246400,2,986,4.320652173913044
1836109,4,B00008DDSK,"I love farscape but i missed it the first time around. i happened to catch the complete four season series (88 hours)in two weeks when they had a marathon on the Sci-Fi channel leading up to the Peacekeeper Wars mini series. I started collecting the Starburst edition disks because lets face it, it's better to spend less than sixty dollars for a whole season than one hundred and twenty dollars for a whole season. However the first six starburst edition DVD collections had alot of problems. I personaly had to return four out of the six collections back to the store because they didn't play right. season 2 collection 3 ended my relationship with Best Buy because they wouldn't exchange it. I will be buying my copies from Amazon exclusivly from now on because i had no problems getting an exchange from Amazon. You know Amazon isn't going to stop carrying the disk three days later. The best part is that seasons 3 and 4 will come on four single sided disks instead of the cheaply made two sided disks. Im hoping this will end the problem i was having with the old disks.
 I gave this product 4 stars out of 5. The Farscape series it'self is a 5 star product. I took one star away just because the package is wider so they don't look right on the shelf next to seasons 1 and 2. i also don't care for how the disks are held in the package. You have to take the top disk out to get to the second disk. They are kinda stacked on top of each other. It's a minor irritant at best. Im sure they are going to be easyer to take care of than those double sided disks at least.

Added after viewing disks: On the third season they got rid of the production notes that you saw on the previous disks. Instead they put some awfull Sci-fi network commercials for the shows. i rather enjoyed the production notes but the commercials don't do a thing for me. The quality of the actual disk is 100% better than the double sided disks.",1135382400,4,1922,4.336111111111111
1836110,1,B00008DDSK,"This reveiw is more about the quality issues with the disc more so than the content of the disc. For the record ADV has added a lot of extras that is not anywhere else. Albeit many are repeated multible times on different disc of this STARBURST series release that could have been better used reducing the compression ratio. As for the quality issues, these are recorded on dual layer double sided disc and as of this writing I have had to send 3 of the 6 currently released back to be exchanged due to skipping, frame freeze, audio cracking etc. The disc were checked on 3 players and a computer and did the same on all of them. So the issue is with the quality or the lack thereof. I have contacted ADV about the quality issues and they have more the most part said ... 'Oh well.' The more pricey collection did not have these issues, but lacked many of the extras and you get what you pay for. Granted to be fair when the disc work, the video and audio quality is fine, but it is annoying to get to the middle of a show and the disc freezes up and up have to skip over 10 or more minutes to get it to play. ADV simply tried to squeeze to much into to small of a space. This collection really should have been put on 4 disc instead of 2. They did not include scene selection either, you can only choose which episode you want to see then fast forward through the tracks after that. As I said I love the show and it is a healthy 5 but this release's quality is a sickly zero.",1131408000,6,1476,4.110726643598616
1836111,5,B00008DDSK,"Like many fans of FARSCAPE, I've only now started turning in my old recordings of the show for DVDs now that we are finally getting acceptably priced copies of the show.  Although there have been other TV series that have appeared in overpriced editions-THE X-FILES springs to mind-FARSCAPE was the only one in its original edition that could be said to be prohibitively so.  I'm not sure about other fans, but there was simply no way that I was able or willing to pay for a set that listed for well over a hundred dollars.  One could make some complaints about the new Starburst edition-for instance, I'm still not clear on why they have to dribble these out two discs at a time, instead of releasing an entire season at once-but two things one cannot carp about:  the cost and the number of extras.  As to the former, I've been about to find each disc in the Starburst so far from various resellers listed on Amazon for no more than $16 apiece.  As to the latter, each of the three sets making up each season is stuffed with a variety of special features.  Some of the special features feel a bit like filler, but a number are substantive.  In this set we get video profiles of Crais (Lani John Tupu, who also provides the voice for Pilot and therefore the only dual role performer in the series) and the two end-of-the-season newcomers, Chiana and Scorpius.  The importance of the arrival of the last two can't be overemphasized, since after their debuts the show takes on the shape it holds pretty much until the end.

Although I love every season of FARSCAPE, the series completely matured, I believe, in this final third of the first season, with the addition of Chiana and Scorpius to the cast.  Both of those characters changed the chemistry of the show dramatically and took it in entirely new directions.  Chiana's arrival is somewhat disguised in ""Durka Returns,"" as the prisoner of Nebaris and one of their most successful reclamation projects, Durka, whom they have reprogrammed to be nonviolent.  Durka, we learned in a previous episode, was a torturer and notorious Sebacean who took especial delight in questioning Rygel.  But it was not Durka but the feline, ultra sensual free spirit Chiana who would become a permanent member of the cast.  Although the cast was superb from the beginning, Chiana brought a new dimension to the crew as the resident bad girl.  It would be a long time in the series before Chiana would come to cease being primarily more concerned with herself than with the others, but she would end by becoming attached to the welfare of the whole more than to herself.  No character on the series, not even former space Nazi Aeryn, would grow as much as Chiana.  I'm sure the series would have been marvelously successful without the addition of Chiana, but it wouldn't have been nearly as much fun.  Besides, while Virginia Hey's Zhaan was undoubtedly beautiful and sensual and Claudia Black's Aeryn was beautiful and sexy despite herself, Gigi Edgley's Chiana was always a pure, unadulterated sexpot.  She always seemed to be on the verge of jumping the bones of anyone within jumping distance.  She also brought a playful physicality that marked her off from the other characters.

Likewise, Scorpius brought a degree of genuine menace and creepiness that Crais never quite managed.  In my opinion, Scorpius was the finest villain in the history of TV.  Even the first time we see him, before he developed in a host of wonderful ways in the final three seasons, Scorpius was unforgettable.  He simultaneously was part Frankenstein, part reptile, and part elegant gentleman.  His costume looked both like a snakeskin and a tuxedo with tails.  And while his face was haunting, he spoke with a soft, sophisticated voice that completely belied his appearance.  The first time we see the cooling rods rotating into his skull we know for certain that this man is a monstrosity, yet charismatic and compelling despite that.  Even had he not developed he would have been one of the medium's great villains, but what makes him so extraordinary is the way that the show's creators gave him so many new dimensions in the seasons to come, not least as they develop John's ""Harvey"" late in Season Two.

This set is graced with several superb episodes, including ""A Human Reaction,"" in which John thinks he has returned to earth with his shipmates.  It is an extremely important episode on several levels, not merely because it is compelling on its own, but because it represents the spot at which John is implanted with hidden knowledge about wormhole technology (which essentially provides the drive for the main structuring story arc from his appearance in Scorpius's Aurora Chair until the end of the miniseries following Season Four).  We also receive further confirmation of John's feelings for Aeryn.  The final two episodes are the first in what would prove to be a series of extraordinary season-ending finales that helped define FARSCAPE during its run.  Three of the final four episodes have John going down to a Peacekeeper base to attempt to find a medical treatment for an injury that Aeryn has suffered and that will prove fatal if not dealt with.  It is there that we find Scorpius for the first time, a restored Aeryn leading the others down to the base to rescue John, and finally the crew being dispersed as Scorpius attempts to recapture John.  The final episode is one of the great images in all of FARSCAPE with John in his space suit and D'Argo holding hands against a brilliant orange planet as the season ends.

Oh, and in the other episode of the final four, we learn that Zhaan is a plant!  Actually, the first alien in the history of Sci-fi was what was described as a giant carrot in THE THING FROM OUTER SPACE, which was ghost-directed by the great Howard Hawks.

FARSCAPE in its first season established that it was willing to take chances to a degree never before seen in television.  Not every gamble paid off and not every episode was perfect.  But when FARSCAPE succeeded, it succeeded spectacularly.  By the end of the first season, it could lay claim to being one of the finest Sci-fi series in the history of television.  By the end of its third season, it could with considerable justification lay claim to being the finest ever.  As good as Season One was, Season Two would be much better, and then Season Three, one of the great seasons of any show in the history of the medium, would be even better than that.",1129507200,20,6476,4.738626226583408
1836112,5,B00008DDSK,"I started watching this series by buying the first DVD of the first season Starburst collection and the next day, I went back and bought the rest of the series up to Seasons 2, Collection 2. This is the best, smartest, most realistic, funny, snarky, sexy humanistic drama--sci-fi or other--that I've ever watched.

Unlike other shows, sci-fi or other, where no matter what happens to the characters, they stay the same, in Farscape, if you get hit, it hurts and keeps hurting. Even in the first season (and especially in these episodes on this disk), dramatic character changes occur, big scary villians are super scary, and huge upsets happen. Farscape thrusts you into the story, yanks you back out, and then laughs when you don't get it. But it's real, it's good, and you come back for more.

This collection was wonderful like the rest of the new Starburst collection. The sound quality is amazing. The room actually shook when Moya Starburst!

This DVD contains so many extras. Tibits about the actors, inspirations, and choices made for each episode. Commentaries by both the actors and directors that are insightful, interesting, and hilarious.

The commentaries by far is what sold me after the pure brillance of this series. Claudia Black and Ben Browder are quite amusing together, commenting on how young they look, how often Ben got beat up, and generally salivating over the directors and other actors.

The double sided DVDs are the only slightly depressing thing. Mostly because I'm lazy and don't like having to get up to flip the DVD over, but it does make for easy storage and in the long run, it's probably better.",1126828800,3,1633,4.859712230215828

Plus, we finally have gotten to the Chiana episodes.",1109721600,8,241,4.239130434782608
1836114,4,B00008DDSK,"If you are looking for great science fiction that is fun to watch and intelligent, Farscape is a great choice. This is an amazing series with a great deal of humor, action, drama, and (best of all) a story arc. I love the idea of the Human as alien, which has not really been explored in Sci Fi television. The characters are well developed, multi-dimensional, and fun to get to know.  There are plenty of twists and turns to keep one interested. There was enough money put into this series that it looks great from day one and keeps on rolling.

I enjoyed this series when I could find it on the Sci Fi Channel but was not as devoted as others. I have been anxiously waiting for the series to come out on DVD at a reasonable price so that I could buy them, which has finally happened.

The one thing I do not understand is why they are releasing the series using double sided DVDs.  Babylon 5 put out all 5 seasons on 6 single sided DVDs with 4 episode on each DVD and still included commentary and bonus materials for the same price as the entire first season of Farscape Starburst set Season 1.  The way the Starburst DVDs are working out, there will be 6 DVDs but they are double sided.  A bit of an unnecessary pain for viewing since I have to get out and turn over the DVD after two episodes. Call me lazy, but I would prefer not to have to flip the DVD.",1109116800,9,1360,4.1915708812260535

Seems like John Crichton and crew mates are always getting themselves into jam which is why I personally refer to the series as Far-scrape! The only way I think the series could have been improved would be to add a few more humorous episodes like ""Won't get fooled again!"" which was fur-sure, fur-sure my favorite!",1391472000,,360,4.918032786885246

Don't buy it for the extras.  Buy it for the show, itself.  All the Doctor Who and Lexx fans out there, if you haven't seen this... give it a look.  You'll like it.",1329091200,,260,3.8679245283018866
7981772,4,B00008DDSK,"These four episodes get the third season off to a strong start.  There will be some major shake-ups in the supporting cast and some important story arcs will gain momentum.  We get the resolution of the second season cliffhanger, in which Aeryn Sun (Claudia Black) was killed and Crichton (Ben Browder)was left lying on an operating table with the top of his head removed.  The dalliance between Chiana (Gigi Edgely) and Jothee (Matthew Newton), son of D'Argo (Anthony Simcoe), is resolved as well.  The first of the big changes comes in the two-part ""Would'A, Could'A, Should'A,"" which has an overly complex plot but some powerful character dynamics and an effective farewell for a beloved cast member.",1243209600,,703,5.0344827586206895
7981773,4,B00008DDSK,"Some of you, the smart ones, know that Aeryn is too cute and smart to die.  But Farscape, while wild and weird, needs to follow some rules.  So when somebody dies, somebody dies.  Just not the one who was dead last season.  The new character of Jool is smart, sexy and shows cleavage.  Which is a sci-fi theme.  It Is.  Anyway, even with the extras, the time travel episode and the cleavage, this season seems to be slowing down and, yes, a tad bland.  That is why I dropped a star.  Still, four out of five isn't too bad.  That's pretty good!",1219708800,,543,4.235294117647059
