8319205,5,B001LNSP9I,"I purchased this DVD when I was pregnant and unable to attend the weekly yoga classes I was doing anymore. This DVD is great because it is functional for all fitness levels. I found that I could use this DVD for the times when I just wanted a quick, relaxing stretch and the times I wanted a more physically demanding workout. Even postpartum, I am still using this DVD. It is near impossible to get to a yoga class with a new baby! I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone looking for an easy to follow, no nonsense yoga workout!",1248912000,,533,4.287128712871287
8319206,5,B001LNSP9I,"This is one of the best workout dvd's I've used.  I tend to buy them and get bored with them very quickly, and get annoyed by having to watch the intro every time.  I love how its set up so you can just skip right to the program and do as much or as little as you want (its divided in segments).  I have taken classes in person with this instructor and find this dvd to be very close to the actual experience!  You feel relaxed, strengthened, and positive after completing it.  Being unable to attend many actual yoga classes due to having a two year old, this is a great purchase!",1227225600,2,581,4.151785714285714
