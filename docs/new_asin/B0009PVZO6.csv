2311143,4,B0009PVZO6,"We get to see Gale Harold shining bright! Angst is the ticket, and I believe this misguided, fearful ""germophobe"" is where Gale should continue to build his acting chops, when it comes to engaging characterizations. Jennifer Elster director's debut hits the spot. I love painful dramas showing how truly life can be in all its unique facets and misdirection's; drama, felt with pain and fear? ""Particles of Truth"" is a good bet in anyone's collection. queerplanet.us",1121472000,3,466,5.144736842105263
2311144,5,B0009PVZO6,"I managed to record it, but I want the DVD too. Every time I watch it (and it stands up to almost obsessive re-watching!), I find new layers of symbolism surrounding, or complexity in the characters. (Dying father looks like Jesus on the cross... As Lilli opens herself, the lillies in her father's room revive... I know, I know... those are the easy ones.) Even the music was carefully chosen for both lyrics and mood in EVERY scene.

Most people will have an initial knee-jerk reaction of distaste to a few of the characters. Even Flora's ""bi-polar, psycho boyfriend,"" however, is desperately, pathetically grasping for his own twisted definition of masculine identity. He gets what he deserves, of course. Mostly, though, because of their flaws and redemptions, every character is perfectly human. We've seen the surfaces of all these ""walled-in"" people in our own lives. This film lets us really know them and care about them.

This movie is not only engaging, and ""entertaining,"" (as in ""I watch movies to be entertained, not for all the psychobabble yadda yadda yadda."") (to each his own, I guess), this movie is also as finely crafted as any cinemaphile could want.",1121299200,8,1172,4.914141414141414
2311145,5,B0009PVZO6,"I went to the premiere of this movie last september in the city and it was brilliant, i talked with jennifer elster and let me tell u she did such an amazing job with this movie she wrote it acted in it and directed it. It is one of my favorite indie movies and the fact that gale harold is in it is a great bonus plus the two of them have great chemistry.",1117929600,5,356,3.824324324324324
2311146,5,B0009PVZO6,"Particles of Truth is one of the best Indie movies I have seen in a long time. Jennifer Elster and Gale Harold's performacnce is brilliant.

This movie is about two people who live in the same city who happen to find eachother and as different as they might think that they are - the truth of the matter is that they are more alike then they want to admit. It is based in a 24 hour period and you watch their lives unfold as they are forced to face their inner demonds... Love, lies, unseen talent, phobias and what they might know to be the TRUTH.

This movie gives a realistic view on the lives of the average person struggling for happiness and better self image.",1116806400,4,666,4.277777777777778
2311177,5,B0009PVZO6,"The story structure is so interesting. All the characters are interesting, and the story is so intense and powerful. If you want something different but good--this is your movie!",1402099200,,178,5.172413793103448
2311178,3,B0009PVZO6,The roles have not been well camp and when the story started to be interresting it was the end But  Gale Harold is so cute it make it a good divertissement,1381190400,2,155,4.0
2311179,5,B0009PVZO6,"If you like movies that make you think. If you like movies that leave you with a greater appreciation for life, including your own, then this is definitely the movie for you. It is by no means mainstream and it is very strange. The cinematography is brilliant, the direction is brilliant, the acting is brilliant. Jennifer Elster works all these positions and more and she knows what she is doing. She has a real art form as her craft. Gale Harold, is also, brilliant. His performance leaves you with a chill to the bone and it is is best acting portrayal that has ever been witnessed on TV or film, I should know, I've seen all of his stuff. While strange, this movie really gets at how everyone is messed up and has their own stuff going on. The heightened awareness of your own life that is generated from the watching of this movie is so worth sitting through some of the bizarre uncomfortable parts. Definitely a movie experience that you won't want to miss if you give a crap at all about humanity.",1373155200,2,1004,4.461956521739131
2311180,4,B0009PVZO6,"If you like Gale Harold then this was fun to see him in a movie and not just on TV.  Was a serious movie but again, if you like him, you will like this.",1368921600,,152,3.4705882352941178
2311181,3,B0009PVZO6,I am a Gale Harold fan and this movie was ok.  I thought the storyline wasn't that great and overall the movie was not my cup of tea.  The supplier was terrific as I received this DVD within a week from the US.  I live in Australia.,1362441600,2,232,3.893617021276596
2311182,5,B0009PVZO6,"This is probably my favorite movie. It's about 2 people who had rough childhoods and now as adults are dysfunctional and have trouble connecting with anyone. It's a movie that shows the sad realities of life, but also the wonderful possibilities. I like the movie because I can relate to it in what I've been through in my life.",1354579200,,328,4.576271186440678
2311183,4,B0009PVZO6,"I was curious to see Gale Harold perform as a very different character from Brain (from the amazing ""Queer As Folk"" TV series) and was not let down. Gale is a great actor and gave a great performance. The movie is dark, disturbing at some points, defiantly not ""entertainment"" but well done. I think I need to watch it again to be aware of more details and symbols. Overall I'm glad I bought it.",1322524800,,395,4.351351351351352
2311184,5,B0009PVZO6,"I bought this as I am a GALE HAROLD fan (if you are not already aware).  The character Gale portrays is sweet and caring but is not treated in the same manner by his parents.  He meets a girl who has as many 'self' issues as himself but somehow they get along ok. The vunerability shown in the characters made me want to protect them myself and save them from going through the situations in the movie.  This is one for the Gale fans, as there are closeup shots of his face and his interpretation of the character.  This is another movie where Gale shows what he is capable of. Sad content of movie is that it shows how parents can so easily influence their children be it good or bad. A timely reminder for us all.",1316476800,,715,4.197080291970803
2311185,5,B0009PVZO6,"Intriguing story, definitely an indie vibe. I don't normally like ""kismet"" stories, but so much of the movie was low-key in a way that made it seem more authentic. Gale Harold was terrific, a tremendous actor. Jennifer Elster was almost too tough, but her honesty & bluntness were also appealing so her performance never crossed the line. Since this was her 1st project I expected a lot more melodrama, but it was really well balanced. No matter the quirks of the story, it was well worth watching for Gale & Jennifer's chemistry together.",1283385600,,539,4.806451612903226
2311186,3,B0009PVZO6,"A chronicle of not-the-best day in life of the New-Yorkers bounded with family ties and affairs condenses personal and professional problems people should come through to survive.

Iconic Gale Harold adds much to this otherwise utterly grey work.",1266796800,,246,5.473684210526316
2311197,5,B0009PVZO6,"This is a must watch film for any Gale Harold film.
I didn't really care for Jennifer Elster's character, but every scene they had together were very good.",1259020800,,155,4.571428571428571
2311198,1,B0009PVZO6,"Truthfully, I kept hoping there would be a turning point. It was definitely not an amusing film. Other than watching the actors perform in isolated vignettes as one would watch a Thespian college classroom exercise, the film had nothing to acclaim. The editing was not stellar. Good try by Mr. Harold, but nothing else.",1249344000,,319,4.925925925925926
2311199,5,B0009PVZO6,"After seeing trailers of this movie I was interested in it. Jennifer Elster and Gale Harold are portraiing two broken characters who are loaded with many problems due to their family background. This movie shows their collision and how they try to overcome their phobias and fears, Jennifer as Lilly, an artist who fears to fail with everything she does and Gale as Morrison, who drives around in his car and spots people to write about them, who tries to manage his germ-phobia, scrubbing his face till excess with soap ( best scenes with a showercap on ;-)) ). In flashbacks we learn about Lilly's past and present and learn that her father is dying of AIDS, worst she could tell Morrison to whom she fell in love. How these two characters get over their fears and phobias it's well placed in this wonderful indie movie. Watch it you'll like it!",1243555200,3,847,4.6158940397351
2311200,5,B0009PVZO6,"As much of his fans, I know Gale Harold from Queer as Folk serie, but this movie is so different. Gale shows us, that he is much more then only Brian Kinney (But I love Brian and Justin of course). All his film are great, he is really very good actor. Shame is, that I have All his films from Amazon. I'm frome Europe, Czech Republic, and nobody here knows him. So many good films I can't buy at home so THX for Amazon. And again, for all Gale's fans: You must see this film is awesome and sweet.",1210291200,4,496,4.02020202020202
2311201,4,B0009PVZO6,"I became a fan of Gale Harold because of his role as Brian Kinney in the Showtime series ""Queer as Folk."" In ""Particles of Truth"", he gives a pretty good performance. The movie is good, though the pace feels a bit slow at times. If you are a fan of Gale and want to see him in something totally different, then check out Particles of Truth.",1206489600,2,340,4.166666666666667
2311202,4,B0009PVZO6,"I am a Gale Harold fan & I really enjoyed him in this movie.  He has his
own unique style of acting.  The chemistry between Jennifer Elster & him was great.",1202428800,2,156,4.0
2311203,5,B0009PVZO6,"Honestly, I only bought this movie because Gale Harold was in it. I had few expectations, and wasn't looking for a good movie, just a fair amount of screen time for Gale.

I was pleasantly surprised when watching it. This was a really great movie. Regardless of Gale being in it, (though I'm not sure anyone could bring Morrison alive as well as he did) the movie was great. I've watched it with many friends, some who know Gale, others who don't, and they have all loved it.

I highly recommend, Gale fan or not.",1192233600,5,513,4.389473684210526

2311205,5,B0009PVZO6,"Truthfully, I bought the movie because I am a fan of Gale Harold and I wanted to see his portrayal of the character. Not only was I pleased by his interpretation of Morrison, but in the end I was won over by the other characters as well. At some point in our lives, we all

have some of the same insecurities Lilli, Morrison, Flora and the others have, maybe not as pronounced, but they are there, and Jennifer's story lets us know it's OK. We are human, and we are all worthy.",1179100800,6,477,4.184782608695652
2311206,4,B0009PVZO6,Basically it's a story of two people living in solitude and with their very own problems due to their personal history and you can watch them develop and grow somehow in such a short period of time - within 48 hours.,1162425600,,216,4.2926829268292686

2311210,4,B0009PVZO6,A uniquely pieced together story with appealling lead characters. You'll love Gale Harold as Morrison!,1127520000,6,102,5.866666666666666
2311211,4,B0009PVZO6,"If you are a Gale Harold fan and want to see him be different from Brian Kinney I suggest you see this movie!!!! Even though the movie isn't all about him he is in it enough. Gale gives a great performance and so does Jennifer, very well directed. Gale is shy, adborable, and his relationship with Jennifer's character was real and something you could relate to. There isn't really that good of extras except that there is comentary from Gale and Jennifer and it is funny. The movie flows very well and it is one of Gale's best works.",1127174400,23,534,4.404040404040404
2311212,5,B0009PVZO6,"I thought both of the leads were great--especially Harold. However Elster was great as well.  I never understand why folks compare an indie film where the director had true limitations, and compares them to high budget fims.  Gale Harold especially has this intangible quality this is so alluring and honest, it is truly a joy to watch him--he moves me and I have believed every role I have seem him play.  He is such a great actor, I hope he doesn't become super-famous, but a great character actor which I can see so easily.  Morover--I hope Gale gets a chance to show his incredible acting chops as his good looks could be a detriment in this culture.  Elster was so raw and honest, I felt everything she was thinking as she worked through her pain--she was fantastic.

I was impressed!",1125360000,17,789,4.6
2311213,4,B0009PVZO6,Gale Harold never fails to pull out a great performance no matter the subject.  He can convey more story without a single word spoken than most actors can with the entire dictionary on hand.  He acts from his soul.,1125273600,7,214,4.461538461538462
2311214,4,B0009PVZO6,"I was pleasantly surprised at how good this movie is. I bought it because I'm a fan of ""Queer as Folk,"" and Gale Harold who plays Brian on that show is in this movie. But the star of the movie is Jennifer Elster and she is wonderful to watch. I especially enjoyed the commentary by Elster and Harold. Interesting to hear how a film can get made on a small indie budget.
Quite a gritty take on beginning love, but I liked it.",1123113600,6,424,4.120481927710843
2311215,3,B0009PVZO6,"***1/2

Jennifer Elster and Gale Howard give beautiful performances in ""Particles of Truth,"" a strange but compelling tale of two emotionally damaged young people who discover one another on the mean streets of bohemian Manhattan.

Lilli is an aspiring artist who suffers from grave misgivings about herself both as an artist and as a person.  She finds herself unable to trust people thanks to her troubled upbringing at the hands of her dysfunctional parents.  Morrison is a sensitive and talented published author who is so obsessed with cleanliness and germs that he has made himself a virtual prisoner to his apartment and car.  In fact, he gathers material for his writing by cruising around town taking down what it is he believes the people around him are thinking.  Haltingly, tentatively, Lilli and Morrison grope towards an understanding of one another, hoping that that will lead them to a lasting relationship.

The film, artfully written and directed by Elster herself, is chock full of meaningful moments that reflect on the fragmentation, paranoia and emotional dislocation of modern urban life.  It's not only Lilli and Morrison who are filled with feelings of inadequacy and intense self-loathing, but everyone else in the film as well.  These include Lilli's perpetually cheerful, intensely religious roommate (Elizabeth Van Meter, who is a dead-ringer for Shelley Duval) who uses both her disposition and her piety as a means of masking her loneliness; the roommate's boyfriend who is a crazed, borderline psychotic; Lilli's AIDS-wracked father who lies dying friendless in a dreary tenement apartment; Lilli's mother who has no emotional connection with her daughter whatsoever; Morrison's father who can't accept the humiliation of losing his job and having his son be more successful than he is; and Morrison's mother, who suffers in silence under the veneer of a devoted wife and upper class socialite.  Elster's point seems to be that everyone is dysfunctional in some way or another, and that life is all about accepting the past and embracing one's weaknesses even if that means confronting one's demons in ways that are bound to cause intense emotional pain and suffering.  By film's end, some of those characters have taken steps to achieving that goal while others continue to languish in their own personal prisons.

Like many well-meaning independent features, ""Particles of Truth"" seems a little too impressed with itself at times for its own good.  Occasionally it exudes an aura of smug pretentiousness, particularly in its obsession with weirdness for weirdness' sake.  The ending also seems a trifle on the pat side, although, commendably, Elster leaves a number of loose ends hanging around to reinforce the overall truthfulness of her vision.

But these are minor criticisms of a film that is, for the most part, very well acted and filled with profound insights into human nature.  With ""Particle of Truth,"" Elster proves herself a triple-threat talent who will bear serious watching.",1122854400,35,3024,5.229813664596273
