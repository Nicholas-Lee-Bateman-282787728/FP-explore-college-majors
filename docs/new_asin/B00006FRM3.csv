7968045,4,B00006FRM3,"I liked the video, very instructive, packager arrived on time, factory sealed, I was very satisfied.",1266624000,,100,5.3125
7968046,5,B00006FRM3,"This couple is the best because they are really precise clean. Some people don't know the differences in style because they dance street salsa. Living in Miami I've seen all kind of salsa like salsa on 1 casino style, salsa on 2 New York style, salsa on 1 LA style, Colombia salsa and Porto Rico style.  I dance salsa on 2 and highly recommend this DVD.",1185840000,,353,4.348484848484849
7968047,1,B00006FRM3,"I purchased the DVD and cannot return it.  The focus is on one man turning a lady.  This happens over and over and over again.  So what?  Who cares about turns, we can all turn.  I would suggest Salsacrazy DVD's they explain the steps and go through lots of patterns.

Save your money for something worth buying.",1174435200,3,312,4.385964912280702
7968048,5,B00006FRM3,"If you are an advance level salsa dancer, this video is for you.  It's the best videos I ever bought.  Lot's of advance techniques.",1125273600,3,131,4.416666666666667
7968049,5,B00006FRM3,"Yes there are lots of DVDs out there that cover a plethora of moves and patterns. Some have inovative camera angles, slow motion do overs, lengthy explanations, and jokes(millenium).

This DVD covers a good amount of moves and does them well. It is right to the point and very good at explaining the points a dancer needs to know. I recomend this to anyone wanting to learn some new things for the dance floor. It has a high replay value. I will be looking forward to more work from these guys. Hoping they come out with a shines DVD. Please keep making DVDs guys !

Bottom line: I'm a fan, so should you !!",1111622400,3,607,4.315789473684211
7968050,5,B00006FRM3,"I watched some of this hoping to learn a lil bit more and I must say that it seems good and the slow motion portion does help out those who are beginning, but I can't help but not to stare at Diane's a$$. Its just out there, especially in those pants, it's nice too. But the dancing is good as well, don't get me wrong. The bangin apple bottom alone gave it a 4star but the dancing was good, a lot of turns and stuff, but they take it slow for you to learn. But WOH, it is nice!!!",1089244800,,480,3.8585858585858586
7968051,5,B00006FRM3,"the only word that i can say about this video is: AMAZING! Juan and Diana are great teachers. they have a fan way of teaching, i had a lot of fun watching this video and i learned a lot too. they break and down all the steps and they are very easy to learn. If you are looking for a good instructional salsa video, i recomend, this is the best one.",1021939200,6,348,3.915492957746479
7968052,5,B00006FRM3,"I was watching this video with a group of my Advanced social Lady dancers & within 2 minutes of this video playing Diana had all of us smiling & laughing. The interplay between Juan & Diana keep us smiling & laughing throughout this video. They are fun teachers who enjoy their Salsa dancing & teaching.
This couple are the first Salsa teachers I have seen on video that I would like to take classes with. Their Salsa classes must be fun.
Although this video is not called a Ladies Spin video I feel it is great for this. The video is full of double, triple & quadruple turns right up to the 20's + spins. Diana gives some great tips on Ladies spinning.
The video is also full of Ladies styling tips.
The step combinations are shown & taught on ONE  & on TWO so all dancers can learn the steps. The steps are danced to music on ONE & on TWO. This video teaches one of the most famous steps, the ""Coffee Grinder"". I have seen this step being taught in other Salsa videos but I like Juan & Diana version of teaching it the best.
As most of the steps in this video were being shown. The ladies with me were calling out, 'Neal's social'. Most of the steps in this video are what I like to use with my Advanced Social Ladies.
This video is full of steps I like to use. This video was like watching my favourite moves been shown. My styling is different than that used in this video so I was able to get some new endings or variations of the steps. As all the turn combinations are shown with several different styling & endings or versions you end up with some impressive steps.
The moves by Super Mario from England were nice.
The video is very good value for money. It is a good length & the picture quality is amazing.
This video is a great introduction to Advanced Salsa. I am looking forward to seeing their new videos they are producing this year 2002.",1012435200,19,1853,4.2492917847025495
