7959363,4,B000063JD3,"If you want a story about a middle-aged man that suddenly makes some catastrophic misjudgments that cause irreparable damage to everyone around him, this is your film.  The story occurs from the point of view of one of those great educators, the kind with a provocative, salty personality he employs to bring out the best and unexpected in his high school students.  They love him.  In his philosophy class, a beautiful girl, Mathilde, cannot seem to cope: frequently absent or late, she is slouching toward failure.  It is, he knows, her last chance.

While leaving school, he comes across her in a faint and takes her home, which he is surprised to learn has no adults.  She immediately strips herself, unembarrassed at her nudity and hugs herself to him.  He decides to nurture her, first as a tutor and later in an inappropriate way, as her lover.  As she begins to bloom brilliantly, he learns about her situation in ever more shocking detail.  His personal life also emerges slowly - he has a loving and attractive wife, but feels stalled in their relationship and in his career, alienated and stagnant.  Trying to extricate himself from Mathilde, everything quickly falls apart as in a tragedy.  The surprise ending is depressingly predictable but still shocking.

This is a very European film that respects the intelligence of the audience.  There are many connections that the viewer must make, must interpret.  For the most part, it is realistic.  However, as a parent of kids in the French school system, I did not find the sanctions on him believable or even just.

Warmly recommended.  This is a very different viewing experience than one would expect as a regular viewer of Hollywood fare.",1454284800,2,1703,4.878048780487805
7959364,4,B000063JD3,"One notable difference between French and American movies with age-discrepant themes is that French movies typically show nymphets in the nude. One notable American exception is Pretty Baby (1978) where after having her virginity auctioned off, Violet (10-year-old Brooke Shields), was shown bathing in the nude after having her virginity taken by a middle-aged John.

The French movie Noce Blanche (1989), which was written and directed by the famous and infamous Jean-Claude Brisseau, is no exception. The 17-year-old nymphet, Mathilde, was shown in the nude within minutes of the movie's start and repeatedly throughout the movie.

In Noce Blanche, after a high school philosophy teacher told his wife what an ""amazing"" student Mathilde wass, she asked, ""Are you in love with her?""
""You're so silly."" he replied.

""Promise me it won't happen."" she pleaded.
""No need to promise. I've never fancied young girls.""

But that only lasted until the next scene. After Mathilde seductively touched her philosophy  teacher's hand while he helped her edit an essay he suddently ""fancied young girls"".

7959365,5,B000063JD3,"Better known these days as the partner of American actor Johnny Depp, the incredibly beautiful French actress/singer/model Vanessa Paradis had a successful career of her own in the late 1980s/early 1990s. Skyrocketing to fame with her debut album ""M&J"" in 1987 at the age of 14, I was transfixed by her beauty and smoldering demeanor as she performed her first hit single ""Joe Le Taxi"" on the (now-defunct) British pop show ""The Roxy"" (think American Bandstand, but with a 1980s cool). I asked a French pen-pal of mine to collect all articles she could find on Paradis and she obliged and it was from one of these French clippings that I learned .that Paradis had been signed to appear in the movie ""Noce Blanche"" (a.k.a. White Wedding).
I hoped and hoped that the movie would be released in my native United Kingdom and never saw it advertised or arrive at any of my local theaters. Perhaps I had misunderstood the French clipping, perhaps the movie had not been completed? It was a couple of years later that I learned that not only had Paradis completed the movie, but she had a very lucrative career overseas as an actress. Appearing in such movies as ""Une Chance Sur Deaux"" (a.k.a. Half a Chance), ""Elisa"" and ""Un amour de sorcire"" all the while continuing her music career with the awesome album ""Bliss.""
In recent years I have managed to track down DVDs of her live concert performance ""Au Zenith"" as well as DVDs of the excellent thriller ""Une Chance Sur Deaux"" and enjoyable ""Un amour de sorcire."" Yet, ""Noce Blanche"" has so far evaded me. Until now.
Of course the DVD has been available in France for sometime, but only with its original French track, and no subtitles. Now, my French is fine, but I wanted to be able to watch this movie with my American (non-French-speaking) friends without having to provide a running translation, so I was very pleased to see a version with subtitles listed on Amazon UK.
So, armed with a region-free DVD player I ordered my copy and was not disappointed. Released in 1989 Paradis plays a parent-less, troubled, moody, but very smart 17-year-old student Mathilde Tessier who rarely shows up for class. The haggard 49-year-old philosophy professor Franois Hainaut (played by Bruno Cremer) takes an interest in her and resolves to tutor her.
Finally, and inevitably the two embark on an affair (understandably Franois is unable to resist Mathilde) and go to great lengths to keep it a secret from both Franois' wife and the school. Some may find it unrealistic that Mathilde would fall for Franois, but in the teacher she finds someone who cares for her and is willing to help her. Finally Franois decides to stay with his wife, much to the chagrin of Mathilde. The movie examines a range of emotions from anger, jealousy and love, and it is expertly scripted and directed by Jean-Claude Brisseau with incredible performances from both Paradis and Cremer all accompanied by a beautiful and at times haunting score.
Now, it may sound like a French version of ""Fatal Attraction"" but I will take ""Noce Blanche"" anyday. Not just because of the presence of Paradis, but the dour manner in which the proceedings are undertaken, and the incredible cinematography that include the shot of daylight streaming in over Paradis' body that was so provocative and memorable that it was the cover shot for the U.S. VHS release.
Of course there is a lot of nudity and the sight of a topless Vanessa Paradis makes this a worthwhile purchase anyway but Paradis really enlivens the film and turns in an impressive performance.
