8383692,5,B002XHNTOW,"I watched this as a documentary feature on HBO Signature tonight and both my husband and I were riveted by the compelling accounts of victims and oppressor of the Pol Pot regime. The documentary begins with casual interviews with present-day Cambodians, and it is shocking (but perhaps not altogether surprising given the circumstances) to hear how each individual interviewed (apparently at random) had suffered multiple losses during the terror years of the Pol Pot regime, losing beloved family members and friends to the monster that was Pol Pot. Their only crime apparently was to have been targeted as undesirables - many were intellectuals, but many were also ordinary people.

There's Chim Math,who was 20 back in 1979, and who spent 3 years, 8 months, and 8 days incarcerated in a torture den. She has no idea why she survived but her experiences have certainly scarred her - the memories of those horrific days still remain fresh. There's Chum Mey whose talent at fixing sewing machines saved his life and Bou Meng whose artistic skills saved him (so that he could paint portraits of Pol Pot).

Then there's Nhem En, a Khmer Rouge photographer, who appears totally unfazed and unrepentant at his role in the horrors inflicted upon the Cambodian people. He vehemently states that it was the duty of the Khmer Rouge to document who their enemies were, hence justifying his role as a photographer for the regime. Nhem En's stance is not surprising, after all he now holds a high-ranking position in a former Khmer Rouge stronghold.

Though only 26 minutes in length, this documentary effectively shows the viewer the painful legacy of Pol Pot's crimes against the Cambodian people. It also shows us that some oppressors remain unrepentant and continue to thrive at the expense of the innocent. Have humans learned anything from horrors such as these? Sadly, atrocities against innocents continue unabated.",1294963200,3,1912,5.063492063492063
