6434724,2,B00KN2KY4W,"A friend of mine practically gave me his set due to a move.  I'm very happy I picked up all the seasons separately years ago.  This box set reminds me of a Stargate SG1 box set I picked up as well as a boxed set of I Dream of Jeannie my brother has.  The discs are simply not as well protected as they are in individual season sets.  The outer box for this set is flmsy, the extras aren't there on the discs, and imho the discs are more likey to be damaged w/frequent use.  Obviously, Anchor Bay was trying to make a fast buck, and cut back on quality.  If I were looking to acquire Three's Company I'd buy the seasons separately.",1411862400,11,630,4.08130081300813
6434725,1,B00KN2KY4W,They should have added the two seasons of The Ropers and the season of Three's a Crowd. Not really complete without these since they are all connected.,1410825600,22,151,4.62962962962963
6434726,5,B00KN2KY4W,This was my favorite show when I was a kid . My favorite charoters were Chrissy and Mr Furly although the rest of them were good too especially Jack. All of the episodes are funny. You should get it.,1410393600,,199,4.128205128205129
6434727,5,B00KN2KY4W,A great collection of one of the best TV comedy series ever! Nobody does physical comedy like John Ritter. Love it!!,1409270400,6,116,4.571428571428571
6434728,3,B00KN2KY4W,"The three star review is for Anchor Bay's packaging. I feel they really cheapened on the potential of making this a better product. I bought this product for the purpose of completing my collection while reducing shelf space. So I'm not complaining about the mass reduction. If I had all 8 seasons previous to this release I doubt I would've made the switch. When you purchase this set what you receive are four DVD cases here in a flimsy cardboard box. The 8 seasons are divided up into two seasons per DVD case. The trade off between cover artwork from this set to the individually released seasons isn't a big difference, however, the loss of Chris Mann's biographic summaries of how each season fared in both ratings and the show's development is missing. Unlike the prior release where the discs were colored, had an image of one of the characters, and a list of the episodes fitted into the space of the disc, these only contain the basic information you need to figure out one disc from the other; I suppose the reason Anchor Bay chose to do this was for economy. If you're one who doesn't like oily fingerprint smudges on your discs be careful with these.

This isn't a bad product. The sitcom was a great vehicle for John Ritter. But what could've made the packaging better for this release is if the outer box the DVD sets are housed in could've been a bit more sturdier like the ones Shout Factory made for their Complete Series releases of Welcome Back, Kotter, All in the Family, the Bob Newhart Show, and others. An addition that could've benefited this release is if they had provided an insert booklet of Chris Mann's summaries of the seasons from the prior releases in each of the DVD cases.",1409097600,57,1708,4.5816993464052285
6434729,4,B00KN2KY4W,"I wish it wasn't just a repackaging of the discs from the individual season releases and had new features for this release. I am happy that you can buy it as a complete set with a new box that fits nice on your shelf. Just wish they could've redone the discs.

If you like the show you really can't go wrong with this set!

Enjoy! I know I will!",1408665600,16,345,3.9855072463768115

6434749,5,B00KN2KY4W,"I'm not a BIG Don Knotts fan so the later Three's Company episodes did not move me. The early episodes with Mr. Ropper were priceless. Mr. Ropper's exaggerated facial expressions and gestures taught me how to start correctly reading and correctly responding to human expressions. I'm autistic - as in AUTISTIC WEREWOLF lol! Anyways Mr. Ropper and the chemistry he had with his wife Mrs. Ropper often stole the show.  The kids were nice and Jack was awesome in his own right but I tuned in for the Roppers.

The quality hits all the marks for good video, sound and frame rate. The quality is not great but it is not buggy and loaded with issues either. I buy DVD's to have unfettered access to the TV shows that shaped my youth. As an autistic child growing up TV was valuable beyond words in my development into a successful adult. I had a special bond to TV characters because; they gave me insight to the neurologically typical world unavailable elsewhere at the time. Seeing these old shows is like visiting with old friends. Hey just sharing my motivation behind the review.",1511481600,9,1078,4.638743455497382

6434772,2,B00KN2KY4W,"I am commenting on the quality of the DVDs and not so much the show itself.

The series is unbeatable funny!  So this is not about that.

The problems with this DVD set (there are so many....):

1.  The quality of the videos: they didn't clean ANYTHING up.  There are shadows at the borders.
2.  If you have a newer TV, there is no way to use the closed captioning.  For whatever reason, they do not have subtitles.
3.  They didn't splice this up nicely so you can just fast forward to the next scene after the theme music. As fond as I am of the theme song, it's a little tiring hearing it again and again.

I really wish whomever produced these DVDs thought about these issues BEFORE they released these DVDs.  It's really too bad because it's such a great series.",1487203200,22,766,4.286713286713287

6434780,5,B00KN2KY4W,"I purchased this as I grew up watching this show with my mom. I, being younger, didn't understand it at the time, so I am watching the entire series for the first time. I unfortunately have not had the time to get through all of the seasons yet. From what I have watched, it is hilarious. Of course, taking place when it does, you have to understand the comedy of the time, as well as have an appreciation of the actors within. I was always a fan of the original Chrissy and was upset when they changed her. This also was filmed for the smaller tvs so the image is different. So, for anyone wanting to watch or re-watch the series, it is worth purchasing.",1484524800,9,655,4.248

6434803,5,B00KN2KY4W,These DVDs are HD quality. I can notice the difference when I watch the reruns on cable versus watching these DVDs. Another added bonus you get to see scenes that were cut out when played on cable. The reason why cable cut out scenes in a show is to show you more commercials. It seems like there are more commercials now than ever with almost every cable channel. So I think getting DVDs of the favorite shows that you like are worth it.,1476921600,9,438,4.289156626506024

Three's Company is a great show.  Chances are, if you're thinking about ordering this, you agree.  If, for some reason, you haven't seen it or aren't familiar, you should definitely go for it.  I couldn't believe watching it nowadays some of the things they pushed the envelop on at the time this was on air.  It stands up really well over time and even though it was on before I was even alive, I find myself laughing out loud several times every episode.

6434845,1,B00KN2KY4W,"So, this was one of the greatest sitcoms ever on tv. My review is of this box set. As some have mentioned, the picture quality of these discs are below par. I too have seen broadcasts of this show that were better quality. This show is old and these are dvds. So you can't expect HD quality. However, there are clearly better masters out there than this. Further, the manufacturing is horrible. You can tell these discs are really cheap. Some are scratched as others mentioned. I am still only on season one so I fear that I will end up getting to a disc that will not play properly.  Honestly, the overall quality of this box set is what you would expect from a budget dvd release company like Mill Creek as far as picture quality is concerned. Even then, Mill Creek's quality control as far as the physical manufacturing of these discs is normal, where with this release it is unacceptable. Only thing is that Anchor Bay definitely did not price this box set at a budget release price. They charge you as normal but for something really cheap. I fear these discs will corrode to an unplayable condition in the years to come. A new low for Anchor Bay.",1453939200,6,1152,4.433962264150943

My theory is that John Ritter and Joyce Dewitt were the anchors, the rock solid duo  that held the show together through a multitude of changes.  Their resiliency kept things going when one wondered how the heck the series could endure yet another change.

6434857,3,B00KN2KY4W,"This is not a review on the quality of the show, but it's on the quality of the DVD (I really think Amazon should somehow break down reviews for books,  dvds, etc. into those about the quality of the content versus the quality of the product/medium that delivers the content, as they're entirely different criteria.)

The picture on this DVD set is the worst I've seen on all DVDs so far. As someone else put it, it isn't even DVD quality; in fact it's worse than the version they play on cable TV (if they hadn't cut off too many scenes for commercials, I'd not have bothered paying extra for this inferior quality DVD set) so it shows that Anchor Bay just didn't bother to get better quality videos when they're available.
The sound is mono, and also sounds worse than the cable version.
I do not understand how a lot of reviewers are saying this DVD set has high quality picture and sound. Maybe they only watch on tiny screens or have never seen DVDs of standard quality. But if you care about video quality, this DVD set will bug you. I even get headaches watching this and I'm considering returning, but unfortunately there doesn't seem to be any other option available to watch the whole series uncut. If anyone knows of other options, I'd appreciate it if they share that info.

6434889,5,B00KN2KY4W,"I remember watching Three's Company many years ago- and while it wasn't in the same league as All In The Family or The Odd Couple, it was just good light entertainment, which made you laugh and took your mind off of reality- which is exactly what entertainment is supposed to do (And what modern shows fail to do!)

It has been a LONG time seen I've seen this show, as I do not have my TV connected to the outside world; I only watch DVDs; and i had been wanting this series for some time- but in the past, the price was too high to justify me purchasing it. Naturally, when I saw the complete series now available in one set for under 60 clams, I was ecstatic, and purchased it right away.

I am completely satisfied with this set, for the price. The packaging is adequate, and doesn't take up too much space- and while the packaging and even the DVDs themselves seem to be of minimal quality, I'm sure they will last if treated with reasonable care. Picture and audio quality are good so far (I'm only on the first disc, mind you...).

Some are complaing about lack of extras- but personally, I don't care. I'm just glad that the complete series is available in one package for this price. How often does one watch the extras, anyway? In my opinion, the producers did the right thing by making the series available at a price I am willing to pay. I mean, C'mon- this isn't Seinfeld; it's just a semi-slapstick light comedy, with the great Norman Fell as the butt of many sex jokes...and then later, the great Don Knotts. Fun to atch, and one of the best of it's genre...but really, how much can be said?

If you enjoyed watching the show in the past, and are lookin for laughs and a break from reality; buy this- it is well worth the reasonable price, and will provide endless laughs. I tend to prefer intelligent humor, but this is one of the few sit-coms which can still make me laugh out loud. And unlike most shows, it is good right from the start! (Some shows take a while to hit their stride; and for the actors to fully get into their characters- but this one is right on the mark from the first episode!)",1434067200,21,2114,4.33080808080808

6434899,3,B00KN2KY4W,"First off this review has nothing to do with the content of the show itself, it's a classic, it's funny, and brings back lots of good childhood memories.  However being that this is a box set it is definitely lacking.  It is as if they took each individual leftover season DVDs and put them together in a set. The first disc talks about content coming in 2004! I know the original show is 4:3 format, but at least redo the home menus in letter box. I don't think anything was redone from this box set from the original 2003 DVD releases.  Perhaps  there is no source material to digitally remaster but you would think they would do a progressive scan for a modern  release. As another review put it's not even DVD quality and I would have to agree. However all that aside I did enjoy getting to relive a lot of old memories. It's just the price of this box set cannot be justified. Luckily I was able to get it in the $40 range from a box store.",1430006400,7,945,4.227777777777778

6434904,3,B00KN2KY4W,"I love this tv series so let me explain why I gave this 3 stars.

This like so many other COMPLETE series dvd is false advertising.

These boxes always make it seem as if it offers exclusive content yet I recently bought the rest of the seasons I didn't have of TC seasons 2- 8 and they ALL have the same stuff as this box set does.

Do NOT BELIEVE THE HYPE ABOUT THESE BOX SETS.

Save your money and get the seasons separately its a better bargain then to pay 80 something dollars for content that you can easily afford on the single dvds that ALSO have the exact same content as this box set does.

For example the front of the box claims it has 2 early episodes not seen in original broadcast.

On one of the single dvd seasons on the back of the dvd it specifically speaks of the 2 episodes .

These episodes for anyone who is interested are 2 episodes made before TC went to broadcast before Suzanne Somers and Joyce De Witt joined the cast.

Both episodes are the very first episode of the show but basically a rough sketch of the first episode without Suzanne and Joyce in it.

For example the first episode has 2 people who were apparently gonna be Crissy and Janet not Suzanne or Joyce.

The second never before seen pilot has Joyce on board but not Suzanne yet someone else is playing her part.",1426809600,8,1304,4.242914979757085

6434909,5,B00KN2KY4W,"I have always loved this Show ... the great comedy of all of the characters.. So many misunderstandings that you find out about thru the storylines that are funny because one sides knows & the other doesn't or gets mislead to what is going on until the end of the show. With Having Jack, Janet & Chrissy... and the Ropers (Stanley & Helen) and Good old Larry. Then the laughs just keep on coming when you get Ralph Furley, & Cindy and Terri... in to the mix. It's all just one great Sitcom to just pop in the dvd player and laugh a little each day. So if you like other Shows like Roseanne, The Golden Girls, Gomer Pyle U.S.M.C. and lots of other comedies of the era... I say it's worth your money to relive the all Time comedy of this show.",1425168000,,741,4.188811188811189

 Now for the picture quality.  This is why im a huge fan of Blu-ray!  I love three's company but the digital transfer rate could be better. As of matter of fact,  This is not even DVD quality.  ...If the picture quality was good, then i'll give it a 5 star.",1419379200,8,458,3.9450549450549453

6434931,5,B00KN2KY4W,"This is a great set. The other reviewers complain about the packaging being too fragile, and maybe it is. But what do you expect to be doing with this? Throwing it around like a ball? Sure, the cardboard packaging is a little thinner than other box sets, but big deal. If you are gentle in taking out the DVDs and putting them back in and then storing it neatly on your shelf, I don't see why it would be an issue.

If you are going to judge the set on the packaging rather than the contents, then maybe you should get the individual seasons instead, but then you would not get the neat box set look that some people like. If you don't care about that, then purchase the seasons individually and you won't have to complain about the packaging. But then again, you also won't get the added features and bonuses this box set contains. So it has its pros and cons. You decide what is more important to you.",1416960000,40,903,4.280701754385965

6434939,4,B00KN2KY4W,"This was a show made for escapist fun and not to be taken seriously. On that level, it worked fine. John Ritter won a deserved Emmy as Jack Tripper, pretending to be gay so the landlords would allow him to move in with two young ladies. Sometimes silly, but usually entertaining. Suzanne Somers got the hype, but Joyce DeWitt shone as Janet. The landlords, The Ropers, were a riot through first season, but the sex jokes, start to wear thin later on. Don Knotts eventually became the new landlord and was usually funny. Overall well done.",1415059200,3,538,4.614583333333333

6434945,5,B00KN2KY4W,"Contrary to what others thought, I thought the packaging was very good. I never got the individual seasons, so I cannot compare. But as someone who enjoys collecting dvd's, and I consider myself kinda picky, I was very satisfied with this set. The discs are held very well in the little plastic dividers that are attached to the case. For anyone who has the Boy Meets World box set, it's just like that, but this set has more discs, and some of the individual cases are thicker.",1413936000,6,478,4.505747126436781

If Anchor Bay could have invested in doing  a nice digitally remastering process to clean up the colors, and the overall image, I would be all over this set.

As such, it seems like another lame, half-hearted release on Anchor bay's part to try to get more money with very little improvement out of the actually product.

Save your money.
