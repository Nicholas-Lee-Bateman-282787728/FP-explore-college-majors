8586622,4,B00CUKTHDO,Great start for a great director. Clever use of mirrors throughout the films. Awesome box set.,1422921600,2,94,4.9375
8586623,5,B00CUKTHDO,I really love this box set. My favorite is Beware The Holy Whore. But then I really like all his movies.,1385078400,6,104,4.0
8586624,5,B00CUKTHDO,"I have nothing but gratitude for Criterion's release of this set.  Fassbinder's early work is striking in imagination and execution. By the time of Katzelmacher and Gods of the Plague it is clear that one is watching the emergence of a major film maker.  Having owned these films on European releases, I highly recommend the purchase of Criterion's set.  The films are strikingly preserved and sharpened by Criterion's superior engineers and consultants.  My only sadness is that Criterion is apparently not able to release all of the Fassbinder canon quickly.  His films cannot be seen or contemplated too often, or so it seems to me.",1382313600,25,635,5.0095238095238095
8586625,5,B00CUKTHDO,"I love the films of Rainer Werner Fassbinder, and I am so loving this collection from Criterion Eclipse as well.",1381881600,6,112,4.65
8586626,2,B00CUKTHDO,This Criterion release looked interesting so I bought the Eclipse 39 DVD. I have never seen a Fassbinder film before and maybe starting at the very beginning was a mistake. I have only seen the first 2 movies from the set and no matter how hard I tried I could not enjoy these films. Am I missing something? I just don't get it. Perhaps Fassbinder eventually became an admired director but these early attempts leave me cold.,1379289600,8,425,4.532467532467533
