7911572,5,B00000IXC7,You have never seen a UFO? You will! This collection is THE BEST in the world - the evidence you always wanted to see from all over the world in excellent quality (the gentleman below might have gotten a bad copy - mine is excellent and in good quality with no audio problems). It makes you a believer - and it shows that the phenomenon remained steady for five decades!,977788800,2,370,4.3
7911573,1,B00000IXC7,"This is the worst quality VHS production (if you can call it that) that I have ever seen. The audio bounces back and forth between mono and stereo, the sound drops out. The video looks like a third genration copy of a pal original coverted to ntsc. Someone projected some of the films on the wall  and pointed a hand held camera at it.",950486400,,335,4.234375
7911574,5,B00000IXC7,"This three-part video provides an excellent collection of decades of UFO video footage, most of which has not been available to the general public.  Presented in chronological order, with fairly good source information (in  most cases), this is well worth the price for those  interested in the  subject.  Even commonly seen footage (ex. Adamski, Meier) is shown with  more detail and clarity.  Some of the more recent material is truly  stunning to see.  Even a die-hard sceptic would have to reconsider after  viewing this superb collection.  A 'must have' for serious students of the  phenonenon.",939168000,8,599,5.189473684210526
