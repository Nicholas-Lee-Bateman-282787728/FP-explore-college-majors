6347229,5,B00J9PVE2A,"A quiet, beautiful little movie that proves a film doesn't have to be noisy or fast-paced or even just filled with dialog to make a profound statement. A poignant, lovely, not cookie cutter ending.",1422144000,7,197,4.823529411764706
6347230,5,B00J9PVE2A,"Such a lovely quiet little movie, but very powerful.",1421971200,3,52,4.888888888888889
6347231,5,B00J9PVE2A,"this is undoubtedly one of the very best movies I have ever watched. While the main character is quirky and seemingly unusual, it is that about him that makes his character and his job so very endearing and reverent. I often see people refuse to watch anything that has to do with death and dying, but this movie will redeem that idea. I love independent films and also British fare and I love Joanna Froggert from Downton Abbey (Anna Bates) but Eddie Marsan was fantastic and the end was a completely emotional ride.",1421625600,105,517,4.56989247311828
6347232,5,B00J9PVE2A,"A beautiful story of humanity, to care and to love asking nothing in return, to care because it is needed. A touching story of the true unsung heroes of society.",1421539200,103,161,4.4
6347233,5,B00J9PVE2A,Eddie Marsan is brilliant as council worker John May in this wonderfully poignant story. A must see!!!,1409184000,30,102,5.0588235294117645
6347234,5,B00J9PVE2A,"I tried so hard not to cry at the end, but I just couldn't help it. This is life, with all its unfairness... The incredible act of Eddie Marsan is also noticeable.",1488326400,,163,4.125
6347235,2,B00J9PVE2A,This could have been a strong ending of a good movie... instead it tried so hard to make the point of the importance of living life to the fullest with those we love that it killed the man who almost realized this in time.  Hated the ending would never recommend it and will never watch it again... that is a shame.  Did not watch it alone and we felt the ending ruined the point by trying too hard to be artistic and dramatic... just yuck and miserable waste :-(,1487894400,,463,4.191011235955056

6347237,5,B00J9PVE2A,"Eddie Marsan is just brilliant. A beautifully written film and a wonderfully moving portrayal by Marsan!

6347238,5,B00J9PVE2A,Loved it,1487289600,,8,3.5
6347239,5,B00J9PVE2A,"This was a masterpiece.  Every detail was perfect. The music, photography, actors, directing were all amazing to tell a unique story about love.  A quiet and deeply sensitive man gives his special gifts of empathy and genuine respect for each person who dies alone with unknown connections or family.  He finds a sensitive person at the end who is able to appreciate what a wonderful man he is.  A surprise ending expresses what he has meant to many people.",1486857600,,457,4.746835443037975
6347240,5,B00J9PVE2A,"Not the ending I expected, BUT the ending itself touched the very core of my heart. This may be a work of fiction, but the story played out in this film, does happen to hundreds of people out there: people who die alone, with no one paying last respects...and no one to say a prayer at that person's grave. Bravo, Uberto Pasolini!",1486771200,2,330,4.338709677419355
6347241,5,B00J9PVE2A,very nice and touching film,1486771200,,27,4.6
6347242,5,B00J9PVE2A,"Yes...there was a moment that I thought....maybe this movie  is just a bit long.  Boy, was I wrong.  The movie was very touching and sincere.  John May was a simple man indeed, yet was able to show us what respect and dignity is all about. The story is deliberate in showing the true sense compassion and humanity.  Wonderful film. It's what GOOD movies are all about.",1486425600,3,368,4.515151515151516

6347255,5,B00J9PVE2A,"I loved this film.  The writing was excellent and the film's ending was unexpected; it took me a while to get over it (I won't give it away here).  Eddie Marsan is a wonderful actor, I'll be a fan of his forever.",1485129600,,212,4.023809523809524
6347256,4,B00J9PVE2A,"A bit depressing, but lovely and uplifting in the end. You have to have a lot of tolerance for looooong pauses while the lead character looks and and ponders everyday objects. This seems to be a standard mechanism in Brit films.",1485129600,,228,4.585365853658536
6347257,3,B00J9PVE2A,"I was curious about this little movie because of its 2 actors, characters from Ray Donavon and Downton Abbey.  It's a very slow moving, quiet film but I didn't mind that -- was a nice change from all the shoot-em-up stuff.  Well done, albeit sad, thought-provoking and uplifting at the same time.  Once you invest the time, however, watch until the very last minute -- that's the best part.",1485129600,,390,4.6231884057971016

6347259,5,B00J9PVE2A,"STILL LIFE is a very slow, very beautiful film.  there is not much can be said without ruining the plot, but let this suffice.  if you are not a fan of eddie marsan, or do not know even know who he is, this movie will make you an avid follower.  if this is your first exposer to him, watch THE BEST OF MEN when you get the chance.",1484697600,,330,3.823529411764706

6347261,3,B00J9PVE2A,Interesting - ironic ending.  Slow moving but worth the time investment on a slow afternoon/evening.,1484438400,,100,5.666666666666667

6347264,5,B00J9PVE2A,"Wonderful story with incredible actors. The details the main character unveils in each of the wakes, shows the depth of this man's character and love. This one hits you hard and stays with you; loved it!",1484092800,,203,4.666666666666667

6347267,4,B00J9PVE2A,This movie is a bit on the dark side. The story line is actually quite good if a bit quirky.,1483920000,,92,3.65
6347268,5,B00J9PVE2A,Absolutely loved this movie. Heart string pulling story about life and death.  Slow at first but well worth the time to watch. Tissues recommended. ,1483833600,,148,5.125

6347273,4,B00J9PVE2A,"""If you don't go to other people's funerals, they won't come to yours."" --Yogi Berra.

Berra's observation will take on new meaning for viewers of _Still Life_, a meditation on connection and isolation in the contemporary world. The film has a point, but it is not preachy. It's an excellent example of the creative writing teachers' dictum, ""Show, don't tell."" But the pace is too slow, even for a thoughtful piece like this. There are a couple of unexpected twists, one of which is a bit corny and cheap, the other, surprisingly moving.",1483488000,,538,4.78494623655914
6347274,5,B00J9PVE2A,"Excellent movie, well worth more than one viewing.",1483401600,,50,5.375
6347275,4,B00J9PVE2A,"Was hinted at the irony early on, but was still not expecting the ending. Interesting portrayal of how we relate to death from a different perspective.",1483401600,,151,4.846153846153846
6347276,2,B00J9PVE2A,I watched the movie because I like Joanne Froggatt from Downton Abby. It is a very depressing movie and I watched until the end because I kept waiting for it to get better. It didn't.,1483315200,,183,4.257142857142857
6347277,2,B00J9PVE2A,The description for this is very misleading.  If you like this type of movie you would probably like it but I wish I hadn't watched it.  I don't want to give anything away about the movie for potential viewers so it's difficult to give a clear review.  Let's just say the description leads you to believe the ending would possibly be uplifting and it was not.,1483315200,,359,4.409090909090909
6347278,3,B00J9PVE2A,Okay but nothing great but did like the ending and the message.,1482883200,,63,4.333333333333333

6347283,4,B00J9PVE2A,"The obvious parallels between John May's life and the lives of those that ended up on his desk were subtle but poignant. May so thoroughly  did what was right for others and very little for himself except by choosing his final resting place which in the end he willingly relinquished....for someone else. May was lonely. Even while at work, on a cramped train or on a crowded bus. He felt more at ease amongst the morgue's occupants and the subjects in his files.  This film was wonderful and evenly tempered and paced....until the very end. It's one of those -how did he end up like this-kind of movies. Only 4 stars due to the underdevelopment of Joannes Froggatt's character. I wish there had been a little more.
This film reminds me of a 2015 NY Times article ""The Lonely Death of George Bell"". I could not stop reading it when I started. This movie had the same effect. Check both out. You will not regret either.",1482364800,,918,4.524096385542169
6347284,5,B00J9PVE2A,"Beautifully done as only the British can do! Acting is spot on, as is the music.",1482278400,,80,4.0625
6347285,4,B00J9PVE2A,Except for the ending...,1481241600,,24,5.25
6347286,5,B00J9PVE2A,This held my attention throughout movie.,1481241600,,40,5.833333333333333
6347287,5,B00J9PVE2A,"Beautifully done by all.  Might be compared to About Schmidt because it involves workplace treatment and is uplifting by the end.  Do not you wish that there were more people with caring hearts?  As in The Lady In The Van, the use of Faith is remarkable, poetic, and hopeful.  And I say this even though I am a scientific atheist.  Apparently there are government occupations that need caring people, even though Management just wants the lowest possible cost to make themselves look efficient.  This movie reminded me of the case in the UK where a young woman had died and her remains were not discovered for 3 years.  OMG.  Anyway, the acting in this movie is perfect as is the directing, cinematography, etc.  I love the old movie Brazil, but this movie did NOT veer in that satirical direction.  It works as realism almost to the very end, which startles us who spent time wondering how it could possibly end.  At least one scene is a real shock, so choose carefully for children who are very sensitive.",1481068800,,1007,4.632768361581921
6347288,5,B00J9PVE2A,"Very good offbeat British Film, enjoy.",1480723200,,38,5.5
6347289,2,B00J9PVE2A,VERY slow movie. I did watch the whole thing but it wasn't anything spectacular.,1480636800,,80,4.785714285714286
6347290,5,B00J9PVE2A,"It was a very sad story and a little slow, but I like a well developed tale. The ending wasn't what you hope for-but it made me cry which to me is the mark of a good movie -to feel an emotion and be over come by it.",1480464000,,215,3.5
6347291,4,B00J9PVE2A,"well crafted, painfully ironic.  If you decide to watch it, make sure you get to the very end.",1479772800,,94,4.222222222222222
6347292,4,B00J9PVE2A,This is the story of a man whose job is to investigate those who died leaving no one to contact. He performs his job quite well and truly seeks to learn about each person. He is methodical and perhaps slow in doing so and in the end his job is to be terminated and replaced by those less interested in discovering the value of each human being. There is something very touching about this movie as he proceeds to find the answers about the deceased and contact those who might come to the funeral. His life itself seems empty except for his job. He too has no one in his life. In the end he solves his last case. There is a twist in this story I shall not reveal but the ending is awesome. Well worth watching if at times it seems to be dragging a bit.,1479600000,,752,4.087837837837838
6347293,5,B00J9PVE2A,"WOW! I had this movie on my to watch list, but I had no idea the impact it would leave me with.

6347294,5,B00J9PVE2A,"I loved ""Still Life""; it is small glimpse into the life of a rather odd and unusual man doing an odd and unusual job. I think that the Brits are good at this sort of thing, and I loved watching both Eddie Marsan and Joanne Froggatt  (Downton Abbey) perform their roles. Of course, due to the subject matter, it is somber and sad at times, but well worth watching.",1479513600,,363,4.260869565217392

6347325,2,B00J9PVE2A,Watched part of this movie but couldn't stay with it.  Very slow and disappointing as we like the two main characters a lot.  We didn't even stay with it long enough to see Joanne Froggatt.  Eddie Marsan is such a wonderful actor so this was a disappointing role (for us).,1475539200,,272,4.4
6347326,5,B00J9PVE2A,This was a very thought-provoking film.  Very slow on purpose because it is showing the life of a person through quiet and consistent patterns.  What I love about English films is they impact your mind and emotions without a lot of glitz and grandeur of special effects.  I was both surprised and not surprised by the ending if one can actually say this.  Very strong and quiet message.  Would evoke some great discussion if one wanted.  It did for me.,1475539200,,452,4.5875

Eddie Marsan is a GREAT actor!  He played his role with such conviction.  If only more people was like him in real life, caring, caring, caring!  When the chance at a love interest presented itself, the storyteller throws a curve ball.  Alas, such is life!

I did not know anything about the actor, Eddie Marsan, or this movie before I watched it. Now I want to see everything Marsan has been in! Brilliant acting. A movie that makes you forget about yourself and take notice of others. This one will stay with me for some time.

This movie certainly is different from the fast-paced action movies. The pace is to allow the sentiment to really be experienced by the viewer, which really explains the title ""still life"".  A moment in time captured to allow one to get an idea of that person's life in summary.

****SPOILER ALERT********
Super depressing!!!  The trailer makes you think the main character is going to make a friendship connection with one of the people involved in one of his cases.  His life is so lacking in personal connection (with living people) even though he is so caring for others.  You are on the edge of your seat for the poor guy to finally have living relationships, but he never does.  This story is unduly depressing because they don't allow the main character to experience human connection while he is alive.  It was a waste of my time.",1459987200,,788,4.666666666666667

It is a movie which causes you to think.  Many reviews say it is too slow, but what is slow to some is just what is needed for others.  The pace allows you to think beyond what is being shown.  The divided reviews represent the same difference of opinion which is found in the movie.  Here is a man who is fired for being too thorough and too slow.  His superiors would rather dump and go instead of  giving each life a final send off which pays  the homage and respect each human life is due.

And, without spoiling the ending, what was its message exactly?  It may be true that, ""to live on in the hearts of those you love is to never die,"" but what is the meaning of living on in the hearts of those already dead?  It was a lovely closing tableau, but, particularly mixed with the ironic ""ships passing"" story-line simultaneously unfolding, it left a not entirely pleasing taste of the bitter and the sweet.  Are we to think that this was sufficient compensation for a life compassionately (but largely un-) lived?  Hmm.

That said, the two main performances were lovely, the other characters interesting and engaging.  If you're looking for respite from movies that brutalize you with coercively emotive performances and music, or plot-lines that are predictable and well-worn, this may be a reasonable alternative.  I would encourage you, though, to come with expectations appropriate for a small movie about lives on the periphery of life.",1455321600,2,1261,5.057971014492754

Nothing is said that you don't need to know, yet the most powerful undercurrents of the film are not spoken. Rather, the viewer is left to observe and interpolate. It is simple, beautiful, and wistful-- a testament to the enduring impact of endowing those around us with respect and humanity, and making small decisions every day to continue doing the right thing even when there is no reward.

6347546,5,B00J9PVE2A,"Just watched this on streaming and immediately came here to buy the DVD. Not for those wanting a light escapist movie. This is a gentle, sad and very moving tribute to those quiet individuals who live a solitary, friendless life and who die alone. Putting it that way, it doesn't sound so compelling! But this movie is so much more than that!!
It started slowly and I wasn't sure I was going to enjoy it until quite a ways in. However towards the end I knew it was one of those rare movies that was going to stay with me forever. Yes, I shed a few tears at the end - that aside, I admit I found it melancholy but not depressing.
A slow pace suited to the subject matter. The soundtrack (an elegant piano piece) a perfect accompaniment. Exquisitely controlled acting by Eddie Marsan who starts out as somewhat repressed and a little awkward, but towards the very end we catch a glimmer of hope and a twinkle in his eye and start to think (along with him) that maybe, just maybe his destiny isn't to be the same as all those lonely endings that he has been witness too.
That fragile hope comes to a very abrupt and shocking end, but an end with a couple of unexpected and poignant twists. After being laid off he continued to work in his own time to give resolution to the life of one man. His last case. In so doing he changed lives, bringing family members together that never would bave found each other. Although his own outcome was not what we hoped, in the giving of himself to others his own life made a difference.",1451779200,,1520,4.318181818181818
6347547,5,B00J9PVE2A,"Still life is well crafted and both beautiful and subtle.  The main character, John May, is played in a very subdued way, but certainly not without emotion.  John is a caring man who saw the dignity in every life, and lovingly honored those lives after death.  The movie has an unexpected ending that is filled with elegant irony.  There is much beneath the surface of this quiet film.  It's a film that might be interpreted as sad, yet left me quietly positive about life.  It left me honoring the fictitious John May, and all the real John Mays in the world who are good and caring, and who are so with little or no fanfare.",1451174400,3,626,4.4
6347548,5,B00J9PVE2A,"A wonderful, quiet film that will touch your life.  Although horribly depressing, it is beautiful and amazing.  John May is a kind and compassionate, although lonely man that works for the good of others knowing that he will most likely never hear praise or receive notice for his endeavors, a hero in my opinion.  It has made me think about my life and its meaning, for sure.  I will definitely be watching this from time to time to help keep things in perspective...it is just that kind of movie for me.",1450828800,2,505,4.516483516483516

The storyline is a sensitive tale of a sensitive man who takes his responsibilities to the Eleanor Rigbys of the world quite seriously.  A British bureaucrat tasked with wrapping up the earthly affairs of people who die alone, finding their families, if possible, the main character is played brilliantly by Eddie Marsan.  A eulogy he composed for a lonely woman who left behind only a cat is a beautiful testament to his character's deeply caring nature, which is ever so slowly revealed through the course of the movie.

This production brought together some wonderful pacing, thoughtful asides, bits of nuanced comedy, and a whole lot of humanity.  The ending was a breathtaking surprise; rarely does a storyline move me so convincingly, unpredictably into its embrace.  I loved it, even with its offbeat pace and rather dark subject matter.  This is a beautiful movie with a wonderful soundtrack by Rachel Portman.  Most highly recommended for sensitive, patient souls everywhere.

People are disposable. They act out of character, go to jail, lose their money, their jobs - family. Some go through most of their lives alone.

John; a public servant in the UK, is one of those people who are left with unclaimed, and un-celebrated persons who have passed on. His job was to find anyone willing, who was related, a friend or ancestor to take possession of effects and attend their funeral, or take their ashes.

I, mistakenly, never read any of the reviews prior to watching this film, so I found myself yelling at the tv, ""this can't be happening, this is the worst film I've ever seen!""  It's just terribly sad and difficult.  If you are prone to being easily depressed or even mildly depressed, pass on this one!  I'm an eternal optimist and it's now depressed me.  It's not that the pace bothered me in the least, it was fine, it was the way it ends for our poor John, even after all the good he's done.  Just as we see him close the page on an old chapter and then open anew with what seems a new lease on life, it all becomes achingly final.  The last seconds (as many have indicated), are beautiful but still SO pitifully sad.  I'm glad I viewed this but will never watch it again...sorry.",1447545600,,880,4.382716049382716

6347629,5,B00J9PVE2A,"This is a story about the compassion of a sensitive, caring man whose job is to locate relatives of the deceased who died alone. I followed the film to the very end and although it did seem to move at a slow pace, it was fitting when you consider the time an employee devotes to the deceased. Then his job is terminated and this man who is alone, without family to care for him, draws the last case out. He lives with the deceased and makes a scrapbook of the investigated. Not as ghosts, but each is real to him. When his job is no more, he feels a sense of being no more and at one point seemed to want to end it all, for himself.
Ironically, the caring employee finds someone who he could have friendship with and appears to want to actually live among the living, for the first time. The ending is not as I thought it would be or wished it would be. Watch it to feel compassion for others while you are still here, for today is all we have as seen in this thought provoking film that teaches us--leads us and gives a preview of what might come to pass after we are no more.",1447372800,,1077,4.084905660377358

6347692,5,B00J9PVE2A,"At its core, this film is a study in the myriad ways that human beings connect and disconnect, the ways and reasons that we are drawn together and pulled apart. John May is not a man who is connected to people in any traditional sense; he lives, eats, and works in almost complete solitude. He knows his neighbors only in passing, and he and his boss might be complete strangers for all that they understand and care about one another on any professional level. When he tells Joanne Froggart's character that it is a terrible thing to become an orphan, even as an adult, it is clear to the viewer that he speaks from deep and painful personal experience. He strikes me as a man who did not plan or expect to find himself alone while still middle-aged.

And yet, John May *is* connected to people, and not just to the deceased people whose next of kin it is his job to find. He also finds a powerful bond with the family members, ex-friends, long-lost acquaintances, etc., because he both understands why they might not want to have anything to do with the decedent, and also why he believes, as a man who has lost everyone he cared about, that there is no such thing as showing up too late to show someone that you care, that they matter[ed].

John is a man of deep compassion who is driven by a need to learn and tell the stories of the people whose relatives he is charged to find. Before they died alone, they lived and loved and hated and were happy and depressed and frustrated and joyful and loathed and heartbroken and loved. They listened to music and sometimes danced. People walked in and out of their lives. They walked in and out of the lives of people they loved. They made a million memories, and kept a few photographic reminders. Whatever the story, whatever the ending, the life mattered and the deceased should be remembered.

So while his colleagues focus on speedy turnover, conducting hasty and half-hearted searches for relatives, then dispatching the body to the crematorium, John May spends weeks searching every possible place for the deceased's loved ones, carefully crafting eulogies, and planning funerals at which he and the cemetery chapel minister are often the sole attendees. He carefully scours their music collections to find the perfect song to play at the funeral. He sees it as his job as a human being, not just an employee, to stand in for the family and friends who do not show up, which is why he continues to do it after he is fired. Everyone deserves to have the funeral their loved ones would have thrown if they had been able to do so.

Much has already been written in other reviews about the ending, which did come as a surprise, but when it was all over, I was glad that the writers and director chose to close the story in this way. Life, after all, is about making the most of your circumstances, and even the happy endings one wished for as a child often get replaced by other endings that are deeper and more joyful because they were so hard won. John May does not live the life he wanted or expected, and his story does not, on its face, end the way he would have hoped, but it is a fitting ending, and a happy one, too, though tinged bittersweet. His story is told. His life matters, and, after all, there is no such thing as showing up too late.",1446076800,,3301,4.460264900662252

The film captures the fragility and unpredictability of life, while at the same time calling on us to value everyone for the simple heroism of seeing it through to the end. Spoiler Alert-the end is sudden and jarring-but means well in this bittersweet celebration of 'meer' existence. Director Pasolini and the cinematographer also deserve a shout out for making a subtle almost whimsical visual study of daily existence in its isolation and loneliness, and making it seem almost lighthearted and absolutely meaningful, in all its made and missed intimacies.",1444176000,,711,5.085470085470085

6347805,4,B00J9PVE2A,"Yes, it is slow. Very slow. The title is Still Life, and you will see that the entire film echoes that idea in multiple ways. Do not expect a lighthearted romantic comedy, for sure. This movie is definitely  like a painting: still, quiet, and beautiful. The main character unfolds before us like a flower, beautifully and sensitively played by Eddie Marsan, an incredible talent. There is not a lot of dialogue in this movie compared with what most of us are used to, ut Marsan manages to communicate so very much nonverbally. You never doubt what he is feeling. It's brilliant. If you stay with it, Marsan and this movie will most likely win you over. Joanne Froggatt, is, of course, lovely and a ray of sunshine in the film, though she doesn't appear until the second half. I love the messages that every life(or death) is worth caring about and that every act of kindness matters, and may change a heart.

6347822,5,B00J9PVE2A,"This movie can be viewed on so many levels.  The cinematography and settings alone can be discussed endlessly.  It is simply a beautiful film in all its aspects.
It takes its time as it gradually reveals the character of John May, a drone in a thankless job that he takes personally and into which he injects heart and sympathy.  It is slow to unfold, but the rewards are rich.  In the process, we see him relate to the people he investigates in unusual, sometimes humorous,  but nearly always important ways.
In his final task, for his job has been absorbed in the bureaucracy, he finds both meaning and budding friendship, in his slow, quiet, lonely life.
I won't spoil as the less one knows going into the film, the more meaningful it becomes.
The performance of Eddie Marsan, who won awards for it, is so perfect, it is almost impossible to imagine another soul bringing what he does to the part of John May.
I will add that this is not a film for everyone, but for many, the beauty of its art should be viewed (and maybe viewed again) and appreciated.  There is not one false step or flaw to be found from opening to the final, searing, almost overwhelmingly touching ending.",1443312000,,1180,4.516431924882629

Watching the movie, you see how selfless and caring he is, and you notice the small subtle changes he starts making in his own life.  Then you get to the ending (don't worry, I won't ruin it for you), which pulls the whole story together.

Very slow moving and building- small particulars, nuances; Eddie Marsan (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jonathan-Strange-Mr-Norrell/dp/B00UA00E0Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell</a>) underplays his role through much of the film, though he has a subtly expressive face.  The end was worth waiting for, hit me like a ton of bricks.  ***SPOILER ALERT*** This film demands much of you- for you to dig deep, confront what is perhaps for some of us most horrifying in life- nothingness, meaninglessness- stultifying sameness- or it never having mattered that one lived or died.  OR DID IT?

Subtle, existential- a quiet character study of a simple man and one lone life (actually, TWO- we're along for the ride as Mr. May investigates his last case- the life and death of the enigmatic Billy Stoke).  Ultimately worth the wait for the powerful ending, I won't forget it, am glad I saw it.  The kind of film that needs to be seen again, I purchased it.

6347971,5,B00J9PVE2A,"This is an excellent film - maybe one of the most effective movies I've ever watched.  Eddie Marsan is perfect as John May, a little man whose job it is to find the families of people who have died alone.  Just as he is handed a new case, he is informed that his department is being merged with another, and May is to be laid off.  He is given enough time to finish the latest case.

The movie progresses at its own pace - certain to be boring for people who are addicted to the typical fast-paced action film - and is very understated.  One gets the feeling that one is attending a funeral ... which, in a way, one is.  Marsen, again, is perfect for this role.  He is slow (one of the reasons he's being let go from his job), apparently unemotional (Marsen maintains the same neutral appearance almost completely throughout the film) and totally understates his performance.  You genuinely feel sorry for this little man who seems to be going through life without being noticed (at one point, going home after work) he walks between two men who are having an animated conversation in the hallway; he never makes notice of the two men, and they never take notice of him - as if he wasn't even there.

The movie is rich with (again, understated) symbolism.  It's there - but you have to look for, and attend to, it.  The direction is excellent; the camera work is perfect, continually giving us a small, uninteresting, picture of a life playing out (almost could be considered claustrophobic, since there is usually no one in the scene but Marsen and the one or two people he's interacting with - and most of the time he is alone).  The soundtrack (what there is of it) is fantastic.

On the whole, you are given a plain, slow, empty film that magnificently portrays a plain, slow, empty life.  If you believe that movies can be art, that they can be more than the slap-dashed product of fast action, loud noises, hyperactive people, this movie is for you.  I seriously mean it  when I say that this may be the best movie I have ever seen, in terms of being a film that sets its sight on a goal, finds the perfect way to reach that goal, and diligently applies itself to achieving that goal - and achieves it with magnificent effect.",1440892800,2,2232,4.4338235294117645

Only in this quest does John begin to find himself and to find meaning and joy in the larger sense in his very mundane routines.

I have to put it out there that you have to be a fan of the slower paced independent movies that are out there. I love the Avengers fast-action flicks as much as the next guy, but I am incredibly ""at home"" watching someone else's life unfold before my eyes with lots of details, and in a normal paced fashion.

If that's not your cup of tea, then truly don't bother with this movie. It's slow. It's detailed. It slogs along at times, and each time is appropriately done.

If there is no one, he provides a proper, personal and heartfelt burial. While he, May, goes through what could have been a sleep inducing repetitive routine of honoring the dead, his empathic and involved commitment, mostly conveyed through his face and eyes, is compelling. When he finds one relative and romance develops, his transition from the dead to the living is lovely and credible.

6348021,5,B00J9PVE2A,"I think this movie is wonderful. The main character of the film takes great care with his work and makes the effort to get to know each of the individuals he is entrusted to and because they are people who die alone without relatives or nearby relatives, he even writes the funeral eulogy. From looking at the belongings of the deceased, he gets to know them intimately and writes a beautiful eulogy. This film is for people who appreciate quality and detail in the portrayal of a character. I don't know why it is called comedic as it is mostly a straightforward drama but there are some light moments of dialogue. I don't think there is anything sad about this movie. John May does not become emotional but he is very caring and respectful in his treatment of the dead even though the relatives may have no feelings about the deceased relative.

6348089,5,B00J9PVE2A,"From the very beginning, I was completely entranced with John May (played by the fantastic Eddie Marsan)! Everything about his character is beautiful--from the way he investigates these individuals, to the way he cuts his apples. I've often wondered what it would be like to be responsible for investigating these kinds of cases. This movie gives you an inside perspective in to an otherwise forgotten job. John tries his best to give these individuals a good send off and write them a beautiful eulogy. Joanne Froggatt's character is minor but she did a good job. I loved how John May came alive when he first met her. I think it was a combination of finally finding a living relative and finding someone who connected with him on a deeper level. The dedication he showed to this particular case was so endearing. He wanted to find everything out that he could about this man. Maybe fueled by his own lack of family? Maybe it was just something he could pour himself into?

I had no idea this was under the comedy category when I watched it, but let me be clear--this is no comedy. But it is still a beautifully done movie. Realistic and doesn't have your typical we're-trying-to-show-the-woes-of-life-but-still-have-a-happy-ending finish.

At the end I was left wondering about my own life-could I show so much compassion for total strangers? What am I doing that's meaningful?

The movie was a little slow. It was partly the story and also part British directing (they tend to show characters walking places and long shots of people travelling. It just takes up more time). However, I think the pace of the movie really made it easy to immerse yourself into John May's life. I could really feel his emotions throughout the movie. I think a theme of the movie was about attitude and how people perceive the things that happen to them. The pace brought that theme to life. Anyway, this is an awesome movie.

6348115,5,B00J9PVE2A,"An amazing movie. A poignant story of a lonely man who has devoted his live to finding the next of kin of those who die alone in public housing with none to claim their personal effects or see to the disposition of their remains.  Mr. May (Eddie Marsan) does all he can to find family, but more times than not, it is he who makes arrangements, and is there for the last goodbye.
This movie will be unlike any you may have seen.  The pace is slow, and simple.  It reminds us that even those who die destitute and alone once had lives, and loves, and people who mattered to them and to whom they mattered. But what about Mr. May?  Does it really give life meaning to care about people you never knew, if nobody cares about you?",1438214400,,725,4.194244604316546

He was not wasted in this film -- it took a lot of great acting to even make the script believable. But the ending (no spoiler) was too sappy after all the hard work Mr. Marsan did to get us to believe in his character and care for him. Joanne Froggatt had a minor role that she did excellently. When I say ""sappy"" I mean it pulls at your heartstrings in a way that makes you feel like you've been had. Definitely worth watching. I wish everybody could just have simply died at the end.

It is full of thought provoking images that deal with the value of people and life. One of my favorite images is when the main character opens a jar of hand cream from a woman who has passed and they focus in on the impression that her fingers made in the cream the last time that she used it.

6348299,4,B00J9PVE2A,"I agree with those who write that this little flick is ""brilliant,"" although I can understand it would translate as ""boring"" to some; there is very little dialogue, and every peek into who the main character is, is extremely nuanced - a huge testament to the acting ability of Eddie Marsan. His character gives us a rare look into a sector of life that most of us never think of, carrying out his job in an understatedly passionate way. The viewer is skillfully guided to realize that his motive is both unselfish and, understandably, self-concerned. As much as my husband and I loved the way this story was done, the last few minutes disappointed us. Our opinion may not be the consensus among viewers who loved this film, but we didn't appreciate the twist at the end; it disrupted the flow of the story for us, which seemed to be waxing positive in its subtle degrees. I give the film a 4 because it was just so great, in our opinion, until the ending dragged it down for us, artistic as it may be.

6348327,4,B00J9PVE2A,This movie was very interesting. It sort of reminded me of the Station Agent. I like movies that are character driven and this one certainly was. I had seen Eddie Marsan before but did not recognize him and of course Joanne Froggatt from Downton Abbey. The ending was sad. Like Cold Mountain.,1435622400,,292,4.634615384615385
6348328,3,B00J9PVE2A,"Essentially a character  study with grander ambitions, this is an interesting, sweet film with two accomplished British actors: Eddie Marsan who is now more widely known for the Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell series featured on BBC America; and Joanna Froggatt plays in Downton Abby as Anna who becomes Mrs. Bates. Marsan plays a municipal official whose job it is to seek out family of those who die alone, a job that has either made him what he is or is perfect for him because of who he is -- the answer is, alas, a bit ambiguous. The promise of romance and release from his bleak life is, sadly, never really realized.",1435622400,,624,4.571428571428571

First time watching him, his low dialog performance quickly grabs the empathic side and even though most viewers haven't had a job in a similar line, allows us to savor the challenges and feel the patience, acceptance and understanding required for the situation.
He himself having a lonesome life he strongly identifies with his 'clients' and does what he can in the final step on this earth to give them a sense of companionship.
The storyline itself perhaps allows us to draw parallels with our own modern life styles and holds a surprise element of the unknown and unexpected things that might come. Live life to the fullest.
Moving and an eye opening plot exploring a job that is stale on earth but fresh on the screen.

There are so many subtleties and humor it deserves an attentive and intelligent audience with a bit of insight.  I admit I watched it a second time just to savor some of the wonderful images.

But, just when you believe that his life will finally flourish, having met Joanne's character, tragedy unfolds, and it's so unnecessary!!  Totally hated the ending of the film.  As a philosophical treatise, it may rank high on the ironic scale, but as a story unfolding about a human being who's just trying to find some measure of happiness - and who richly deserves it - the irony feels misplaced and spoils the effect of the film.",1434499200,2,746,4.578947368421052

6348447,4,B00J9PVE2A,"I found this to be a sad but engaging film, with Eddie Marsan perfectly understated in the role of a lonely civil ""detective"" who devotes his life to finding relatives of the deceased to attend their funerals. With precious little financial reward, this unassuming bureaucrat fights a quiet, personal battle, so that proper respect might be shown to his fellow human beings, no matter how low their standing. Not everyone will like this film, for it is unquestionably slow and devoid of action, and yet it manages to capture the truism that one person can indeed have a positive impact on countless acquaintances merely by showing them common decency and understanding. The ending is a bit contrived, I thought, but did convey a strong message that obscure people can nonetheless leave indelible effects for the better. Eddie Marsan is not your typical leading man, but he handles his role nicely, and sweet Joanne Froggatt is well cast as an endearing young woman whose troubled, embattled father has passed away.",1434412800,2,1014,5.005917159763314

He then arranges for their `send offs' often being the only person in attendance. He has no family and struggles to understand those that have what he does not have and yet readily shun it.

Then his obnoxious boss tells him they are `downsizing' the department and merging with a neighbouring council. He is told to close the case on his last assignment and clear out. He decides he will find out who this lonely man was and he sets out on a journey to discover this man's past and in so doing he starts to live himself.

This is just a wonderful film - full of hope, loneliness, pathos and even love. Marsan is always excellent and here he carries the film, but is supported by a cast who are all excellent too - Joanne Froggatt as Kelly Stoke brings real warmth and humanity to a role which sees her with limited screen time - so is all the more noticeable for it. This is a film for people who think, who care and who want to understand more about life and death - absolutely recommended.",1434153600,,1130,4.3254716981132075

The story of a man whose job it is to trace the relatives and friends of deceased people. A dour, methodical, deliberate man, the movie deals mostly with a particular case of his, and the effect it has on him and other people concerned.

From the start the movie makes you think about loneliness and mortality, in particular your own, and what you leave behind. Emotional too, in that you see how people are affected by other people's lives.

Despite all this, the movie seemed to be heading for a predictable and possibly lacklustre ending. However, the final few scenes are among the most powerful, emotional and thought-provoking I've ever seen. Certainly not predictable.

Superb work by Eddie Marsan in the lead role. He was perfect for the role. Good support from Joanne Froggatt.

The hero has a deep respect for  deceased people who are found without identification or family he attempts to find out more about them and provide them with a funeral including an eulogy he devises from what he has been able to find out about the individual. As time has passed there are more of these individuals and less desire to find out who they are -  just cremate them and move on is the new wave of the younger boss.  It costs money to go through the research to find out who they are and find their relatives.  He convinces his boss to let him do it one more time even after his boss has notified him he is laid off because he is no longer considered efficient.,1433721600,,816,4.178343949044586

Eddie Marsan, one of Britain's finest character actors, is simply brilliant here, and Ms Froggatt (of Downton Abbey) gives lovely support. The writing and direction of the film (by Uberto Pasolini) could not be bettered.

It is a beautiful film from start to finish with a wonderful, subtle performance from Eddie Marsan, The music is also lovely: sweet, sad, and quietly powerful in feeling, seemingly like the main character.  This is not a love story in the typical fashion of boy-meets-girl although that does eventually happen.  Joanne Froggatt's character appears about three-quarters into the film. For those who love deliberate, thoughtful movies, this is a winner, one that will stay with you for a long time. Marsan's character believes that all acts of kindness matter, in giving respect and dignity to each person no matter their circumstances - important lessons and reminders to us all. Still waters run deep and Marsan's character is very deep with lots of ripples spreading out to shores he cannot see. Sounds a little sentimental but I feel sentimental about this movie.

John showed patient compassion as he contacted past loved-ones and friends for these unknown individuals.

Made in the quite vibrant ( as I understand it ) low to middle ground of films in England( interms of prdouction costs, not production value). Great acting, no question about it. There are certain shots that seemed to echo a more european film discipline, and as I noticed that the Director and production people seemed to be largely Italian, I thought it seemed appropiate. If anything, this film seems to be about the dehumanization of people, which I probably connected to in a more extensive way. Whilst it brings the European view of British life, an outsiders viewpoint, i think this is a Universal topic the way it is dealt with. Basically, the lead character cares about his ""charges"" in client services, and in the view of management, he spent too much time making sure they were treated humanely. As maudlin as the film is, if you get into the story of the film, the ending is quite positive, however the journey is a hell of a depressing one.",1431734400,,1034,4.564516129032258

John May is highly introverted and a bit odd, but also deeply compassionate. The movie doesn't make him into a weird, tortured anti-hero or anything; it just lets him go about his life and we watch his little gestures of incredible love and care. The ending is an emotional punch that I could have done without, but I was willing to ""go there"" with the plot, because it drew me so deeply into caring about a hidden hero of unusual grace and care.

Briefly the story is about a timid local bureaucrat whose job it is to literally prepare the paperwork and burial for lost souls who die and leave no family, no friends, no trace of ever having lived on the planet. He proceeds with dignity, caring and a conscience.
Then the plot turns when he learns he's been let go and must finish his last case. It is in pursuit of putting a life together with a desceased that sends him on the trail of anyone alive who had been part of hi life in the past.

It's not a movie where you chit chat with someone while it's playing, because it's by ""getting into it' that at the end you'll say like I did--that was a good movie!.  I invited my twenty something daughter over to watch it and didn't give any hints.  After she watched it, she agreed, ""that was a good movie"". It's hard to find a ""good"" movie today that isn't full of profanity, sex and violence. This was refreshing for a change.

If you're expecting that kind of experience, or if you're expecting a Joanne Froggatt vehicle, please don't watch this film and then be disappointed. Some of the reviews were based on these expectations. Still Life is in its own category,  one of the most moving, endearing films I've watched in years. Eddie Marsan's portrayal of the lonely, dedicated government employee could not have been better. Ms. Froggatt has a lovely, but small (yet important) role in the film. The story moves slowly, quietly, building to a truly remarkable conclusion--sad, yet appropriate and satisfying. Some may find the film overly-sentimental, and I can understand that perspective. I think much of the impact of this film resides in what the viewer brings to it. For those of us who lead quieter existences, this film resonates so very deeply. It certainly did with me. I absolutely loved it. Highest recommendations.",1430697600,2,994,5.135802469135802

Nevertheless, Husband and I were in the mood for something uplifting and watched the trailer.  Right away, the main character, John May - wonderfully played by Eddie Marsan -  appealed to us in a very endearing way.  So, my husband and I watched it.  If you decide to give it a go - BE PATIENT with the pace of the movie.  The pacing is very much  part of the story and IS the proper vehicle for forcing the viewer to slow down and really ""see"" what the movie is communicating by drawing  one into the methodical way that the 'hero' conducts his heroic actions. Most heroes in this world are everyday people that seem unassuming and often - uninteresting - because their work is tedious and it takes real effort to do something with great love and devotion....(think of your mom or dad).  Everything about the main character is so beautifully empathic that we were totally drawn into his  'Weltanschauung"" (way of being or world view in German - sorry no good English equivalent.)  His perfect empathy for those he cares for is simply, quite beautiful.  This is a lovely, but somewhat sad movie - that allows us to peek into the amazing power of simple human kindness.  We loved it.  (I should add that right before the ending, my perceptive spouse raised this question; ""Do you think all the people he helped will be waiting to greet him when his time on earth is up?

I did not see the ending coming, and I give the movie added kudos for that... I was taken aback and bawled my eyes out.

6349118,4,B00J9PVE2A,"What a lovely film, 'Still Life' is just that.  People who live alone, die alone, who looks after them, who cares if and when they die?

John May, played by Eddie Marsan is a civil servant in South London,  whose job is to locate relatives of those who have died, alone and with no one. he cares, he is a man who lives alone as do the dead he looks after. He tries to find family, writes their obituary, and he attends their funeral. His boss, a loveless man, it appears, has taken his job and given it to someone who does not care. So, John is without a job after 22 years.

His last case he calls the great one. He finds anyone and everyone who ever knew the last great Billy Stokes. He finds his daughter played by the lovely Joanne Froggart. But, she has her own issues of abandonment,but she recognizes in John a kindred soul. All seems well.

And, then the final scene and I found tears streaming down my face. An extraordinary film ,a quiet film with a big message.

If no family is found for the deceased, he arranges for a church funeral. Only the priest and he are present. After being fired, he begs for extra time to finish his last case. He finds a living relative, a daughter. He plans for this man's funeral using his own funds plus giving his own burial plot. Fate strikes!  The man's family and friends attend his funeral so well-planned, but the worker dies accidentally and is buried at the same time with no one present except the priest. Then amazingly, all the deceased people he helped came to his grave. Life is eternal grace!",1430438400,,720,4.4961832061068705

Now, as part of the city council's downsizing, it is decided that someone else is to take over his position, and John May as his last job embarks on a journey to seek for the clues to the life of one Billy Stoke, who happens to have been living just across the street from Johns flat.

This is producer-turned-writer/director Uberto Pasolinis sophomore work. His works as producer includes such comedies as Palookaville and more famous The Full Monty, but Still Life is more of a poignant tribute to the lonely souls than a comedy. The films deliberately slow pace in the first half, and the final chapter that attempt to make us emotional may divide opinion.

This is not to say Still Life is dismal or something. The quiet film is simply not my cup of tea. The film is definitely worth watching, with very good performances from Marsan and Joanne Froggatt (though her role is not very convincing and screen time rather short), but as to the sentiments it (or its ending) conveys, I am not sure you will like it.",1424822400,,1360,4.774468085106383
6349333,1,B00J9PVE2A,Very good movie but not for me because it only talks about death,1424736000,2,64,4.0
6349334,3,B00J9PVE2A,"An interesting watch, worthwhile script and premise.  Watch it, probably once.  A tad strange as a concept and a bit dry.  I think it's worth a watch and am amazed it was made.  It could become sort of ""culty"" like Harold and Maude.  Because of her great work on Downton Abbey, putting Joanne Froggatt on the cover is misleading.  She'd not really a ""lead"" in this , more of a limited supporting player, although she does play a pivotal role.",1424390400,2,442,4.4625

6349336,5,B00J9PVE2A,"You will be touched by this movie. Yes, it is slow, in a quiet,  and unassuming way. But it will get you there in time. You will say ""oh my God"" at the end. The last few seconds are brilliant in the saddest, most ironic way. I love this film!",1423526400,59,242,3.84
6349337,5,B00J9PVE2A,"I loved this quiet little film. A story can be entertaining and meaningful at the same time and this one fills the bill. Eddid Marsan was very effective as the undervalued public servant, without ever reducing this role to a caricature. Joanne Froggatt was charming and made the most of a relatively small role.",1423440000,36,311,4.777777777777778

6349339,5,B00J9PVE2A,"Very well done.starts slowly,but the ending is very powerful. Note the great respect that our hero has for life,and that every one deserves a decent funeral. Without disclosing  much,observe that all the people that he was involved with show up. So he is not alone. No guns,fast cars,sex,still a good movie to watch and enjoy.",1422835200,49,326,4.927272727272728

8649102,5,B00J9PVE2A,"Perfectly pitched, quiet, and ultimately very moving. Speaks volumes about today's alienated society where it is harder and harder for people to express kindness. Absolutely worth your time.",1528761600,,190,5.821428571428571

8649105,5,B00J9PVE2A,I watched this because I recognized some of the actors. It really was a decent movie. Kind of sad. I cried at the end.,1492041600,,118,3.9583333333333335

8649108,4,B00J9PVE2A,This is a beautiful and powerful film with an important story to tell. But I have to say that I wish it would have ended differently. I understand and accept the message the film is trying to send but I feel like it goes out of its way to assault your emotions. I also did not expect the ending at all and maybe that's what made it so difficult to process. I still recommend the film but I caution that it could be too overwhelming for some.,1490400000,,441,4.080459770114943
8649109,4,B00J9PVE2A,"This is a hard movie to review.  I was surprised and left with mixed emotions.  It was a somber and unassuming story, but one of compassion and kindness.  The main character John, is a simple guy that seems like his life is pretty boring from the outside.  When you learn more about him, you see a deep heart with a lot of compassion in doing a job that many would find depressing, unnecessary, or outright avoid.  He really cared for those people that left this world alone.  As a first responder, I have often thought about some of the things that this movie details, which is what drew me to watch it in the first place.  I was surprised, and at first angered, by the turn of events at the end of the movie, but it was a touching ending that made sense in some ways.  I can't say this was the best film I've ever seen, but it was interesting in a subtle and unassuming way.  Worth a try if you want something different or with a deeper meaning.  I agree with another reviewer who mentioned that this movie encompasses the thought that even small acts of kindness really matter.",1490140800,,1080,4.3283582089552235
8649110,5,B00J9PVE2A,"Beautiful, thoughtful, compassionate movie about a man who gave his all and asked for nothing in return. I tried so hard not to cry, but the ending broke me.",1489190400,,157,4.448275862068965
