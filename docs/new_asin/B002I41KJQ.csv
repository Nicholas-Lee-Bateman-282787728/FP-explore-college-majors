3935521,5,B002I41KJQ,Great that this came out.  It was a good call as well.  I hope there will be a release of a DVD with the Johnny Mac call as well.  I really missed it.,1248393600,,150,3.484848484848485
8370627,5,B002I41KJQ,It's a shame how many times the Maestro destroyed Roddick's dreams. Great match between two great players. Don't diminish Roddick's achievements.. he played all his career against the greatest player of all times.,1450137600,,213,5.484848484848484
8370628,5,B002I41KJQ,Everything OK,1412553600,,13,6.0
8370629,5,B002I41KJQ,Watching Federer beat Roddick over and over again is worth the price of the film.,1408233600,,81,4.466666666666667
8370630,5,B002I41KJQ,"Roger Federer met Andy Roddick for the Title at Wimbledon in 2009 and these two played one of the longest and most intense battles ever fought on a tennis court in this match. Roger was in form,but Roddick also was prepared and the match was one for the ages (a 30 game tie breaker is an awesome treat) Fans of tennis will love this one guaranteed.",1393718400,,348,4.287878787878788
8370631,4,B002I41KJQ,This match had everything you could ever want in a Grand Slam final. The only thing I disliked is the finish. I wanted Roddick to win this match so badly you have no idea.,1389744000,,171,4.0588235294117645
8370632,5,B002I41KJQ,"Any classic (meaning a tennis match in its entirety) with Roger Federer playing in it is a must for our DVD collection!  I hope to find more U.S. Open matches... I love to watch Federer play.  He's like a graceful African lion on the court, casually winning points with the smooth sweep of his paw!",1367798400,2,298,4.4
8370633,5,B002I41KJQ,the wimbly 2008 final will be regarded as the greatest tennis match ever.  But this one Makes most people's top 5.  Wish they had the Johnny mac commentary like when I saw it on TV live.  This match was full of Drama and about as close as any match can get.,1367280000,,257,4.0
8370634,5,B002I41KJQ,"Roddicks best chance to take Wimbledon, the fifth set alone is worth the cost of the whole match, and better than the whole match. Do your own research, but I think the final set went 31 games???.....rediculous, and so sad the American didn't finally get his prize, but by far the best match Ive ever seen, and a little proof why they need a dome or something to make it fair.....you'll see.",1362528000,,391,4.444444444444445
8370635,5,B002I41KJQ,"If you are an avid tennis fan and especially a fan of either Andy Roddick or Roger Federer then this is one match you will not want to miss.  Even if you saw this match in 2009, it is a classic and you will want to view it often as the years go by.

I am an Andy Roddick fan so as much as I did not like to see him lose, the match was played at such a high level and as usual, Andy tried his hardest and made the match entertaining.",1310083200,,432,3.6344086021505375
8370636,5,B002I41KJQ,"4 hours 17 minutes of wonderful commercial- and Enberg-free tennis from the BBC, as Roger Federer goes for his 6th Wimbledon and (record-breaking) 15th Slam title.

In front of former champions Laver, Santana, Borg and Sampras (plus McEnroe commentating for NBC and Becker for the Beeb), Federer and Andy Roddick put on both the closest final and one of the finest that I can remember.  As the Beeb's Sue Barker said afterwards, it's sad that someone had to lose.

One fascinating segment during a change-over shows two of Roger's serves superimposed:  the service motion and the point of contact with the ball are identical in both cases, but the ball goes to opposite sides of the service box!

The two discs include the warm-up, the entire match, the award ceremony, interviews with both contestants, and footage of Laver, Borg and Sampras congratulating Roger afterwards.

Boris's fellow-commentators are Andrew Castle and Tim Henman.  The picture and sound are both crystal clear.",1290384000,4,985,5.11875
