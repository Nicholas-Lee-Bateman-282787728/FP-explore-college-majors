This is Region 1 DVD and there is English audio, but I haven't checked for other languages. The quality of them are just like buying them separately. All movies except Man of the West, are in Full frame format. There are four disks in this collection and there is just one case that holds all disks.

All movies included are:

Along Came Jones (1945/b&W/90mins)
-Gary Cooper, Loretta Young, William Demarest, Dan Duryea, Frank Sully; Directed by Stuart Heisler
Man of the West (1958/color/99mins)
-Gary Cooper, Julie London, Lee J. Cobb, Arthur O'Connell, Jack Lord; Directed by Anthony Mann
The Pride of the Yankees (1942/b&w/128mins)
-Gary Cooper, Teresa Wright, Walter Brennan, Dan Duryea; Directed by Sam Wood
The Westerner (1940/b&w/100mins)
-Gary Cooper, Walter Brennan, Doris Davenport, Fred Stone; Directed by William Wyler

This is a great collection of some of the best Gary Cooper movies and Westerns. I would recommend getting this collection for the price of these movies individually will be a lot higher.",1363219200,,1419,6.0497512437810945
