1196598,5,B000007PAP,Terence Hill is such a funny actor. not over the top like Robin Williams can be. The movie had some endearing characters and was a lot of fun to watch.

1196613,5,B000007PAP,This DVD had excellent sound and picture quality. The movie is still enjoyable and funny now as it was when I first saw it back in the eighties which isn't the case with fondly remembered movies from my childhood.

1196631,5,B000007PAP,"I agree with the reviewer that this IS INDEED the original version that aired on cable in the '80's.  The picture quality on this DVD is MUCH HIGHER than what I remember seeing on TV as a kid, though.  Really, very clear and sharp.

The recurring theme music some reviewers complain about, is one of the best features, and part of what makes this movie so fun.",1260489600,,360,4.343283582089552
1196632,2,B000007PAP,"This silly movie is badly acted, has terrible effects and probably one of the worst theme songs ever performed. Yet I've always had a sneaking affection for it, probably because Terence Hill goes at his role with such gusto.

Rating: 4/10.",1260489600,,239,4.829268292682927
1196633,5,B000007PAP,I hadn't seen this since HBO was the only Pay TV service in town (with those potato chip can antenna).  It is still very funny and goofy. Mc Hale is laid back.,1256256000,,159,3.96875

1196635,3,B000007PAP,"If you grew up in the early 80's watching this over and over, then you see this ""new"" Widescreen edition, you'll notice many differences. First of all, it's in Widescreen, the print is cleaned up significantly, which in my opinion is fantastic! The major differences however lie in the soundtrack. Gone are the obvious over-dub's by the actors (there are some here, but not nearly as many, or as obvious as the ""original"" version we all grew up with.) The most annoying thing however, is the overuse of the movie's theme. Many scenes that were quiet in the ""Original"" version are saturated with the theme. It actually detracts from the movie in my opinion. In addition, some scenes are extended, which is nice, because remembering the ""Original"" or cable version, there were some obvious cuts to scenes that seemed out of place.

So, which version is better? I actually would prefer this print with the ""original""/cable soundtrack in place, which wouldn't be difficult to do with an editing system, if it weren't for the extended scenes that would obviously throw off the sync. One could still do it I suppose, but it would be some work...

Bottom line is this print is the best it's looked by far. I'm wondering if this is simply another region's DVD, ported to Region 1? The main titles that kick off the movie don't say ""SuperFuzz"" but rather ""SuperSnooper"" which makes the movie's theme song make more sense!

Glad I have both versions anyhow!",1230422400,2,1447,4.78
1196636,5,B000007PAP,"So I was going around looking for an old movie from the 80's that I hadn't seen since 1986 when I was still just a kid. I ran across the title and found it here. This movie is awesome!!! I believe it may have been one of the movies that inspired me to make some of my own life choices. The main character does stuff, regardless of what anyone else says, including his stubborn-headed partner. Even though his power goes when he sees the color red, don't we all have a weakness we just can't seem to tackle; one that we live with and work around anyway? Yes! This is one of my all-time favorite movies and I'm glad I had a chance to get a hold of it!",1229472000,,649,4.038759689922481
1196637,5,B000007PAP,"We came to this movie fresh, not having seen it as kids or prior to it being released on DVD. We just loved it. What's to love?Well yes, it's corny, but that's part of the charm of these fantastical, ridiculous movies. Ernest Borgnine is his great lovable self. It's a funny, hilarious  movie which keeps moving, lots of action and fun, and Trinity of course never disappoints. Just innocent fun and lots of laughs. A great addition to Trinity collectors. Enjoy!",1223683200,,462,4.703703703703703
1196638,3,B000007PAP,"My copy of this had the same cover and title as shown and was Widescreen without making any changes in the setup. Everyone that enjoys this movie knows it won't win any awards other than make us laugh. The movie although showing it's age, hasn't aged badly. I have seen a number of movies from the same period that were barely watchable because of the dialog and music. This one has aged well. It is still fun to watch. A cop gains superpowers while trying to give a citation in the everglades where all the inhabitants have been evacuated for a rocket test by the government. This test endows officer Dave Speed, played by Terence Hill, with superman like powers. His approach to nabbing the bad guys is more like something out of a Three Stooges short than a police procedures handbook. It helps if you are a fan of Terence Hill and Ernest Borgnine. If you enjoyed this be sure to catch Hill in the ""Trinity"" movies and ""My Name is Nobody"" which is a favorite Western of mine with Henry Fonda and Terence Hill. Good quality DVD with some extras and decent replayability. - C. Luster",1214352000,,1084,4.47979797979798
1196639,5,B000007PAP,"If you grew up in the eighties you will remember this from the 1000 times it played on HBO. The movie is as cheesy and corny as you remember it, and that is what will make you watch it over and over again. If you have kids it is a kid friendly movie that you and the children will enjoy over and over.",1212278400,,301,3.7936507936507935
1196640,5,B000007PAP,"With four extra minutes...

And with the opening title of ""Super Snooper.""

I first saw this film in the theater in the fall of 1981, when I was in 5th grade. And I loved it! A few years later our home was blessed with a Beta VCR. And I became a movie-taping freak! Since I had saved all of my old cable guides, I went back and made a list of every movie I would tape - if they happened to come back on one of the movie channels again. On the top of the list (along with OVER THE EDGE) was SUPER FUZZ.

My prayers were answered on Wednesday May 1st, 1985. SUPER FUZZ came back on cable that month. It was shown on HBO at 1:00 PM CST. Yes, I still have those old cable guides and just confirmed it. I set the timer to record it while I was in school. But when school ended, I rushed home, rewound the tape, and watched it. When it was over, I rewound it and watched it again!

I have probably seen this film (that HBO version) more than 100 times. My poor tape probably wore out. And I can confirm that this DVD (at least the one I bought) IS in fact the same version - with about four minutes of extra footage added.

Now others have said some of the music cues are different. That could be. Although to be honest, even though it has been about seven years since I saw it last (on the pre-recorded VHS tape) I didn't notice any of the music changes. And as for the audio and dialogue, NOTHING has been changed. It's the same audio soundtrack that I remember. Even after all these years, thanks to the repeated viewings I had back in 1985 and 1986, I was able to remember lots of the dialouge - including the inflection of the voices and such.

THIS IS THE SAME VERSION THAT I TAPED OFF OF HBO IN MAY OF 1985!!!

Now if others watched it when it was played in earlier years, then perhaps that particular version was different. I have no idea. All I know is that this particular DVD is the same version (with the four extra minutes of footage) that I taped in 1985.

So I'm happy. I'm thrilled! I now have one of my all-time favorite films on DVD and in widescren. No disappointment here.",1210291200,2,2086,4.108108108108108
1196641,5,B000007PAP,"I quickly bought this DVD because I had a feeling it was going to be one of those ""hard to find"" DVD's. I wasn't surprised that this peticular one now has disapoeared. I remember catching this on HBO (a long long time ago). Nothing was on and I watched it. Put this one in my favorite list. Most people snare when I mention this movie but it's funny. You have to love the synthesizers also present in the movie.
 Ernest Borgnine, before Airwolf, plays Sgt. Willy Dunlop who has a rookie partner Ofc. Dave Speed (Terence Hill). Lets forget that Ernest Borgnine is a young 91 and Terence Hill just turned 69. When red nuclear material rains down on Ofc. Speed when he is serving a warrant over unpaid parking tickets, Speed begins to notice some weird things are happening; he's levitating, silverware is mixing without him doing anything, and unexplained strength. Can he control his powers?
 Still protecting and serving, Ofc. Speed suspects counterfeit bills are being smuggled in trucks filled with raw fish covered in red covers. At first his Sgt. doesn't believe him. Things quickly lead to Tony Torpedo played by Marc Lawrence. If anyone is familar with the James Bond flick, Diamonds are Forever, he played a bad guy where is goons throw out Bond's love interest out of a high rise hotel's balcony. "" I didn't know there was a pool down there,"" he answered Bond when Bond said,"" Nice shot into the pool."" Anyway, is Torpedo one step ahead of Ofc. Speed? Will Ofc. Dave Speed meet his doom on the electric chair?

The DVD is pretty stright foward. No extras. The movie is a breath of fresh air from all the top notch special effects and CGI's out there. Even though the movie is almost 30 years old, it's still funny.",1207699200,,1722,4.584415584415584
1196642,3,B000007PAP,"The DVD I received was within the cover for Super Fuzz, but the title on the DVD and of the movie was ""Super snooper"" and the title song was super snooper as well. This is NOT the version of this movie I thought I was buying. Someone made a switcheroo and put the European version with terrible music, and so loud you couldn't even hear the dialogue at times. There were also many places where there were no sound effects like the car engine and other regular sounds but only the too loud terrible music from this song and lower, somewhat inaudible dialogue, poorly dubbed. I am very dissappointed that Amazon would sell this title, which I was very much looking forwards to. Shame on whoever ripped me off like this!",1192406400,,717,4.480916030534351
1196643,5,B000007PAP,"I've been looking for this film for years!  My kids watched it growing up...wore out the VCR tape! What a goofy, fun movie.  Glad to see it finally came out on DVD.  My kids are thrilled to have it back in the file!",1188604800,,215,3.953488372093023
1196644,1,B000007PAP,"When I think of the early eighties, I immediately remember Colecovision & Atari and Queen, but I also remember some of the movies that were on Cinemax/HBO in the old days of novelty cable TV.  Super Fuzz was definitely one of those movies that bring back memories, along with Flash Gordon & several Chevy Chase comedies (Oh Heavenly Dog, Modern Problems, etc.).  While the movies are pretty campy by today's standards, I still enjoyed them.

First off, someone else mentioned it but I feel the need to re-iterate it.  This is Super Snooper.  What horrendous packaging... the cover says ""Super Fuzz"" but the movie is actually Super Snooper.  I was so disappointed after getting this as a birthday present.  Hey, it woulda been a fantastic gift!  But, as sad as this might sound, I remember the music to every scene as if I'd seen it yesterday, and from the very beginning when Terrence is in the swamp, it's pretty clear that this isn't the Super Fuzz version that aired in the USA.  The music comes on at the wrong times and is far too redundant in the European/Canadian version.  But having said all of this, the general movie is the same with the same thing, and it's about a policeman who gets exposed to radiation and uses his super-powers to try to stop a counterfit ring.  Hilarious scenes include him running extremely fast through traffic, roughing up some thugs in a bar, and taking an unexpected trip to China.

If you can get the version seen in the USA in the early eighties, I'd actually recommend it.  It might not be a 'masterpiece' to some, but I really enjoyed the movie and it brings back some great memories.",1176422400,13,1627,4.607638888888889
1196645,5,B000007PAP,"I would like to apologize to Amazon. I complained about this version not being widescreen. I found out that I had to go into ""setup"" on my DVD controller and set it for 4:3 Letterbox. This will fix the problem everyone is having with the DVD playing in Fullscreen format.

It is true that this version is the Supersnooper version and not the Super Fuzz version. I have the Super Fuzz version on Fullscreen DVD and there are differences.

The plusses for the Supersnopper version: It is widescreen and a clean transfer. This version also has about five minutes of extra footage. The minuses: Some of the music is different in spots and some have said the commentary by Dave Speed is different in spots. I am not sure on that one, but I have only viewed it once so far.

The plusses for Super Fuzz version: It is the version I saw first and I am used to every scene and every musical note. The minuses: Fullscreen format makes the picture to cramped. Also the picture quality is not as good.

Bottom line: I need to keep both versions to be totally happy. What I want is for someone to release a version with all the scenes in it and leave the music as it was in the Super Fuzz version. Maybe that's not possible, but I can hope.",1174262400,,1227,4.321739130434783
1196646,1,B000007PAP,"So I finally received my copy today after eagerly waiting for it for several weeks. Having seen it a dozen times on Showtime in 1983, and subsequently purchased the same version of the film on VHS in the '90's, I am pretty familiar with this movie. That said, here's the lowdown on this latest DVD release:

* It suffers from PAL speedup, noticeable in the voices and music, despite the fact this is an R1 release

* Film is anamorphic widescreen, 1:85:1.

* Opening credits feature the title SUPER SNOOPER instead of SUPER FUZZ

* There are a few additional scenes featured in the movie, and some extended scenes

* The voice of Dave Speed is still Terence Hill's, but it seems like it is a different recorded track compared to the other version (i.e. different line readings in a few instances)

* Many, many music cues have been replaced with the standard Super Fuzz musical theme from the opening. Other music cues have disappeared, and several scenes that didn't have music cues at all now have the Super Fuzz theme added. The theme really wears out its welcome in this version, whereas in the other version it was used more sparingly. One horrifying example of music alteration occurs in the scene where Dave busts out of the electric chair, heads underwater and rescues the chief on the bubble gum balloon, the new music and sound cues are awful.

* Other voices of some of the supporting characters are completely different, such as those of Tony Torpedo's goons

* A few pieces of Hill's voice-over narration appear to be missing or altered

* The camera filter used to make the helicopter scene appear to be dusk is gone; scene now appears to be in bright daylight

On the positive side, the quality and clarity of the print looks better than I have ever seen it before.

Bottom line: this SUPER SNOOPER version was probably released in England and/or Canada in 1980, and is the cut of the film seen on this DVD. The SUPER FUZZ version that was released theatrically in the US in 1981 is the version we all remember from Showtime and the VHS and earlier DVD release. Clearly, as noted above, there are major differences and thus this DVD will disappoint many fans such as myself who have the previous versions.

On a side note, the extras are worthless. There are some production stills included, along with trailers and clips from other Terence Hill movies. No Super Fuzz trailer or director commentaries, contradicting what was stated in the specs on Amazon and other sites.

Buy this DVD only if you don't have the VHS or previous DVD release. Despite the improved picture quality, this version has too many differences that distracted me from enjoying it very much. I doubt I will watch this version ever again.

Hopefully another studio will put out a quality version of the film that we all love and remember.",1173571200,30,2825,4.6579476861167
1196647,1,B000007PAP,"I was so excited to finally have Super Fuzz on DVD in widescreen. Sadly my joy only lasted as long as it took me to unwrap the DVD. I was all giddy as the DVD started up. The menu screen looked fantastic and as soon as I hit play, it all went downhill. At first I was amazed at the movie in widescreen, and then it happened. The main title of the movie came up SUPER SNOOPER. My heart sank deep into my chest. Super Snooper is what the movie is called in Europe and sure enough, the version of the film on this DVD is the super bizarro UK version that I already have on a DVD I imported from England.

A note to anyone reading, THIS IS NOT THE SUPER FUZZ YOU WATCHED AS A KID. This version of the movie is full of odd extra scenes. That sounds like a plus, but what absolutely kills this version of the movie is the fact that the voiceovers are completely different. Aside from Ernest Borgnine, just about everyone's voice is different from the US version. Most offensively are the voices of Paradise (who sounds like a stereotypical bad guy from Mexico, a banditio if you will) and the main character himself, Dave Speed.

Maybe I'm just being too picky, but I simply cannot watch this version of Super Fuzz. I want the version I'm so familiar with, I want the US version! I will admit that the picture quality on this DVD is fantastic. I never thought Super Fuzz could look this good. But I will probably never watch this version ever again, so all the picture quality in the world doesn't really mean much. There was some weird pseudo-bootleg version of Super Fuzz for sale on Amazon a year or so ago. I have that and although the picture quality leaves a lot to be desired, at least the movie on it is actually Super Fuzz and not Super Snooper. If I were you, I'd hunt around for that version.",1173225600,62,1797,4.251461988304094

That was fine with me, I was a young child and this movie would capture my interest every time.  Years later I was lucky enough to find a used VHS in bad condition in a video rental store, but wanted to see it again so badly that I purchased it off of their shelf.  It was worth it.  The tape broke shortly thereafter and I have been searching for it on DVD for a long time.  Finally I found it on Amazon.com and to be honest, I debated about the price.  Did I really want to spend over $20 for a movie made well over 20 years ago?  I decided to make the purchase, and I have to say, the movie is as great as I remember.  Very worth the price.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes superhero type films, or perhaps even comedy.",1140134400,,831,4.0182926829268295
1196655,5,B000007PAP,"Wow, what a classic!

I've probably watched Super Fuzz so many times when I was younger, it's become like what Gone With The Wind is to many people.

This brilliant laugh-out-loud comedy stars Terrence Hill as David Speed, a police officer who, after being exposed to ultra-red rays, gains super powers that allow him to move objects, like trucks, with his eyes, fall out high buildings without getting hurt, and make huge balloons from blowing bubble gum. The only kicker is that everytime he sees the color red, he loses his powers temporarily.

The movie co-stars Academy Award winning actor Ernest Borgnine (Marty) as David's uptight Sergeant Dunlop.

Super Fuzz is a highly enjoyable comedy that everybody will love.

But sadly, the dvd version is baaad ! First, the cover of the dvd looks like it was made by an amateur in graphic (there are some spelling errors) Then, when you watch the movie, there are some glitches at the bottom of your screen, the image is flat and the sound is very low. It looks like ""WHAM ! USA"" (the company that put it on dvd) took a bad vhs version of the film and transfered it to a dvd ! The only thing they add are some actors bio and scenes selection.

So beware ! Even if you like this movie, you should think before spending money on such a crappy dvd ! Maybe the vhs version would be better and less expensive !",1136937600,3,786,3.792682926829268

I've always loved Terence Hill, and was surprised to see him in a non western film.  He's one of those under rated comic stars of films.  He's more of a cult hero, than a A-list actor, but he's still one of the most enjoyable to watch.  This is a cult classic, no matter how corny it is!",1131667200,,408,4.113924050632911

1196665,5,B000007PAP,"It was the summer of 1981. The lights of a small movie theater in Warren, Ohio dimmed as the flickering images of a little known film called ""Super Fuzz"" began to dance across the silver screen. I was 11 years old, then. From the back row I gazed at the colorful opening and tapped my toe to the disco rhythms of the title song, as I prepared myself to be wisked into the heavens of movie making bliss.

  Ok, over-dramatic I agree. But you have to admit, there are very few things left in the world as kind hearted, innocent and a bit naive as the memories of our youth. Like a security blanket we latch on to certain persons, places or things associated with our youth gone by, and Super Fuzz happens to be one for me.

  Its just plain fun to see the clothes and styles from that era, the cars, the music, and the sites re-lived. Who wouldn't want to return to those days, no matter how much your kids think you looked gross in your yearbook.

  I give Super Fuzz five stars among corkey movies. Its a smash hit in its class, and thats saying a lot (concidering bombs like ""Class of Nuk'em High"" and ""The Zoo Gang""). The light hearted humor, slap stick antics and boyish charm, make Super Fuzz a cult classic among 30 something family types.

  Rookie cop Officer Dave Speed (Terrence Hill) is bombarded with red omega rays from a NASA test missile that explodes overhead, while he carries out his mission of issuing a warrent for traffic violations in the swamps of Poepoe. The radiation from the missile gives Dave super powers which he uses for the benefit of protecting and serving the community.

  He soon focuses on a much bigger catch, a counterfeit money making ring printing phoney bills on a boat in the gulf. Aided by his supeior officer Sergent William Dunlap (Earnest Borgine) Dave develops a super plan to catch the culprits, ""Phase one, convince the underworld that I'm a crooked cop. Phase two, catch Torpedo in the act."" But the steaks are high for Dave as he is falsely accused of a murder and is sentenced to death.

  Will Dave be able to clear his good name and apprehend the real crooks? This is a must see. A fun family movie for all ages.",1109808000,5,2166,4.413098236775818

Now I see it's available & I'm sure it will be horrible since it's so old but I will still love it just as I love all things that bring me back to my youth!

1196671,5,B000007PAP,"It's great to see that a studio is releasing this underground classic on dvd. It will finally be mine. I originally taped this movie off hbo in the early eighties when I was 5 years old. I used to run around elementary school impersonating the movie's scene stealer, Tony Torpedo. 'NOW HE'S GONNA GET THE CHAIR, I'D LIKE TO SEE THE SON OF A BITC# GET OUTTA THAT!' It must be one of my favorite movies of all time, because I can't get tired of it. The Italian actor, Terence Hill, was a great leading character. He had a slick, confident presence that made him perfect for the role of Dave Speed. Ernest Borgnine was brilliant as Willy Dunlop 'The Sarge'. He was always flustered and getting angry at Speed for his superpower claims, but couldn't accept the obvious evidence that Dave wasn't lying. And The sarge's niece/Speed's girlfriend, Evelyn, was hot. I used to fantasize about her giving me mouth to mouth like she did for Dave when he made believe he drowned. I want to keep some of the other fantastic characters like Rosy Labouche, Sylvius, and Torpedo's lackey goon, Paradise, duly noted, without actually describing their humorous significance to the movie. The special effects, although exceptionally good for 1979, the year it was made, are too corny for today's over-abundant standard use of computer animation. As far as the audio quality is concerned, the goofy music added a lot to the fun atmosphere this movie gives off. I fished around european music websites carefully and successfully downloaded the soundtrack of this movie onto cd, and now I bought the dvd to follow. You see, unlikely things can happen when you apply yourself. Anyway, if you want to see a very original and unique super-hero movie that is just fun to watch, this is a great choice.",1102204800,4,1774,4.744336569579288

He was eating plates and plates of beans to give him propulsion so he could break through the wall and jump into the ""river"".

Plot: Essentially there is a cop who gets super powers (can't remember exactly how, I think lightning hits him) and he and his buddy, Earnest Borgnine, are trying to disarm some threat/bad guy.

What the movies about:
A cop (fuzz) goes to issue a ticket and gets caught in a nuclear test blast. Of course he don't die like a normal person but instead devolops Super powers! The rest of the movie is the bad guys / girls trying to put a stop to his saving the day!

So,it wins the place like ""Ultimate cult movie"" .In italy  it's already a classic. Personally,i think it's a great bad movie and i  love it so much that...i'm beginning to have some problems with colour RED  too. I give it 8,5 stars out of 10 (Mmmm...maybe 10 stars out of 10  !!!!!!!!!!!)",968112000,,1100,5.129943502824859

1196722,5,B000007PAP,"What a film! Have been looking for this movie for ages,thought it had been deleted altogether. This classic never gets played anywhere,and certainly deserves some play. Dave Speed is the best,and stars in the most underplayed  film I have seen. The film was played at the same time as the MAD MAX films  started,that always gets shown but never afilm I know is just that bit  better.",961891200,,383,4.686567164179104
1196753,5,B000007PAP,"I just ordered my copy of SuperFuzz.  One of the first movies I watched on cable back around '82( I was 6).  It's always been a favorite and although I haven't seen it in years, I remember the entire movie. Here's the deal,  we have an italian actor from spaghetti westerns and Ernest Borgnine, can't  get better than that!  IF you like slapstick, pie in your face, bascially  rediculous movies then this is for you.  Terrence Hill, I assume an Italian  actor(he has an accent), is David Speed.  On a routine assignment in the  Everglades, collecting on some unpaid parking tickets a native american has  yet to pay(outside the tent is a totem pole, isn't that the wrong part of  the country?).  The man is out and Dave is accidentally around a nuclear  missle launching pad.  Dave is exposed to the radiation and gets  superpowers.  His first confrontation, an aligator that he tries to reason  with(starts off by saying ""Hey Fella""). Acctually, it looks like  he caused the missle to explode.  He tries to scare the gator by shooting a  round in the air, next thing you see is the missle exploding in the air. He  soon realizes that he has superpowers but his partner, Sgt. William Dunlop  doesn't believe him and has little patience(that's Ernest Borgnine).Plus  Dave is dating the sarge's niece Evelyn. It's amazing I remember all the  details since it's been at least 10 years since I've seen the film. I  watched a lot of tv when I was young. Anyway, Dave and Willy are trying to  trackdown some mob counterfitters, a Mr. Torpedo and his men including head  henchman Paradise. Dave's powers help he an Willy on this case causing  Torpedo to get nervous(check out the fight scene between Dave, Paradise and  the other henchmen. Never thought a guitar could cause so much damage).  Did I mention Dave loses his powers when he sees the color red?  It has to  do with the explosion, see there was a blinding red flare when the missle  exploded. And this has caused problems during the investigation. Plus it's  only half way through the movie that Dave learns his powers are useless  around red.  How does he find out? Well, on the two times he loses his  powers there's a homeless man named Sylvio who witnessed them so Dave  thinks Sylvio knows the answer.  Sylvio says ""it could be anything, a  color , a noise, a person..."" He does this while he's driving, and  Dave of course is running at the same speed the car is going.  Then he sees  red and literally hits a wall.  But dave gets too close to the action so  the mob guys set him up.  They use a famous female singer/actress, who  happens to be Willy's favorite(check out Ernest Borgnine dancing and wooing  this woman, too funny!) to help kill him.  They make Dave think the  counterfitting is going on in one of Torpedo's fishing boats. Dave tells  Willy, Willy investigates(the fake bills are sewn into the bellies of the  fish on the boat) and Torpedo's men sink the ship with Willy aboard.  Dave  is then accused of killing Willy and is sent to the chair but Dave  counteracts its powers(makes the people watching fry instead like in a  cartoon) and breaks out of jail(runs right through a wall) then dives into  the ocean to save Willy.  Dave finds the sunken ship with Willy aboard,  Willy has been locked in the ship's freezer so it's a rather  ""stiff"" performance by Borgnine. Dave saves them both by blowing  a tremendous bubble gum bubble big enough for them to float up out of the  ocean and into the air. Dave catches the mobsters, while their plane is in  the air and Willy fully accepts dave and his new powers(my favorite movie  scene Ernest Borgnine dancing on top of this balloon shouting ""I'm on  top of the world"" and telling a random thunderclap, ""Don't you  dare!"" but Willy gets carried away and the boys end up in Hong Kong or  as willy calls it. Hawaya Hong KaKa.  How do they get there?  You'll have  to get the movie and see.  But Dave does get the girl who finds away of  curbing his powers for good. Find out when you watch Super Fuzz! I have to  give kudos to Borgnine. I can't believe he got involved in such a crazy  movie but it shows how wonderful an actor and person he is. He's an  incredible actor and top notch star who could have turned his nose up to  this but he didn't.  He's a down to earth actor who likes to work, he's not  Hollywood in any way. I wonder what he now thinks of the movie. Watch him  as he dances with his favorite singer, jumps around on top of the balloon  and best of all, stammers as he becomes the police escort when the  singer/actress arrives in Miami. She asks him if he's married and he loses  it.  His laughter and antics are infectious so if you like Borgnine, and  He's one of my favorites, get this movie.",956275200,33,4738,4.462441314553991

However, many years passed and I forgot all about this  movie until one day a friend and I were talking about old movies we watched  over and over and over again. I could remember the story and characters but  not the name of this movie. After extensive researce I uncovered Superfuzz  and to my surprise that same friend had an old copy of it! I immediatly  borrowed it but felt that I needed a copy of my own, and not one that was  recorded. This movie is a classic, besides, has there ever been a bad movie  with Ernest Borgnine in it?

This movie has some of the best B movie special effects that I've ever seen. My brother and I  have watched it twice since I bought it a few weeks ago. Terrence Hill is  THE MAN! I'm beginning, however, to think that the film was shot without  microphones and then everything was dubbed in after the fact. Highly  recommended!",939686400,,452,4.54320987654321
