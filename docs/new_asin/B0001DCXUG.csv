8010515,5,B0001DCXUG,"This is the second volume of ""Tenshi Ni Narumon."" It's quite similar to the first DVD. We get more goofy adventures with Noelle and Yuusuke, and the characters are all fleshed out a little further. The animation is extremely cute -- I read another review that says the mecha in this series resembles Fisher Price toys.  We see some plotlines from the first five episodes picked up again here -- even though the episodes seem self-contained they all tie in to each other in one way or another.",1143676800,,492,4.590909090909091
8010516,4,B0001DCXUG,"Here we still have the characters developing as in volume 1, so I need to see the rest of the series to make heads and tails out of this story, but since the distributor seems adamant on keeping us in the dark, it seems I will have to wait another two years for the next volume. I've heard it said that this is an excellent series once you get to the middle of it, when the story comes together and all the whimsical stuff takes some meaning (!?). I just hope I can see it complete before I die!",1090454400,4,495,4.01010101010101
