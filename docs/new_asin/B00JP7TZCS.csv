6382483,5,B00JP7TZCS,"A GREAT movie funny and serious, about people's prejudices and how love can forgive all. I enjoyed every word and had to laugh out loud. The only draw back is that the disc didn't work on my DVR because it was done on the European system, plus it did not have subtitles so it might not work for everyone, I am lucky because I speak French Fluently and did not need the subtitles.
Again it is a great story about people, family and all that ties us together which is much stronger than what seperates us.",1422403200,14,503,4.25

Subtitles will not be on the DVD disk main menu, but will be on your remote.  To access English subtitles you need your DVD remote to access the English subtitles. On your remote select (subtitles) and keep clicking it until the word English appears on your TV screen and English subtitles will display.",1484524800,13,415,5.073529411764706

6382503,4,B00JP7TZCS,"I thoroughly enjoyed this French movie, it's so funny. A good movie about inter-ethnic marriages, and how our preconceived ideas and prejudices can color the way we look at other races and religious beliefs. I especially like the way the 2 fathers come together and accept each other through a series of mishaps! I would definitely recommend this movie.",1446422400,,353,5.0

Only the french! How retrograde of them. I only wasted my money since I (like 9/10th of the world) do not speak french.

In the future Amazon should give more information about a foreign film.
Since I ordered the film in the USA, my assumption was that the film comes with subtitles in English and French at the very leasst.
I wonder if there is such a film with subtitles.
I would prefer this film to be used with my Francophone group and studentsl..",1506211200,,441,4.261904761904762

I liked the movie for the most part. I bought it because I thought I would love it and give it five stars. Great acting by all and unique story line but I just wish I'd laughed more and thought it was funnier.",1498176000,2,361,4.084507042253521

8652706,5,B00JP7TZCS,"I have been wanting to see this film from the moment it came out. My French is good enough to hold a multi-conversation but with films it is rather like multi-tasking and I am not as successful. Therefore when I saw Brenda's review I was delighted. I ordered the film which arrived yesterday and has already been seen. This film has parts which are not politically correct but it is rather like open season. It is a comedy which shows us how to be tolerant to everyone and it makes sure that it covers the bases. The acting is good, the scenery gorgeous and although the film might offend some be like me and celebrate that at the end tolerance and an understanding of all makes the film very watchable. If the distributor happens to read this and does a version with subtitles appearing automatically I will be one of the first customers.",1497312000,,839,4.490196078431373
