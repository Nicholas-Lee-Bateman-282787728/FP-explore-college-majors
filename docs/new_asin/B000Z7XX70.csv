It makes her feel girly, confident, and pretty, aside from being fun. It is also good exercise. But I tried so hard to find one that was NOT an exercise video because they go too fast. She wants to learn the dance, not workout with it, she has other videos for workouts. I was so thrilled to find this one, and to see her enjoy it so much.",1517011200,,462,4.087912087912088

8235094,4,B000Z7XX70,"It is one of the best hula instructional video I have ever seen.  The Instructor starts first to explain the posture.  She breaks down the basic steps and then hand motions. She slows down each verse without music for learning purposes.  Then she adds the music of each verse then the entire song.  What made it fun was the mirror-image; you didn't need to think too much about directions but just follow.
Before each dance she explains the story of the song.  You can't go wrong with this video!

Post production they must have realized the mistake and occssionally insert a little box showing her feet in the lower corner of the picture...now you have to watch two things...the box for feet and the main screen for arm movements.

2. There is absolutely no mention of how to hold your hands...you are supposed to learn by watching.

3. I've taken one hula lesson on Kauai and the Kumu (teacher)stressed that you need to understand the words of the song and the way they are expressed with the hands. Telling a story is the whole point of hula. This is barely touched upon in this DVD.

4. This is a very superficial program.  Buy the RealHula DVDs.

The instruction as given is clear, the scenery beautiful, the dancer beautiful and talented...",1238371200,5,891,4.685897435897436
