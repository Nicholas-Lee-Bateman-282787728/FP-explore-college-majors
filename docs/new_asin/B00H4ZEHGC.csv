8630076,4,B00H4ZEHGC,"""Reportero"" (2014 DVD release; 72 min.) brings to DVD a 2012 documentary of PBS' on-going series POV (Point of View). As the documentary opens, we are in the company of Sergio, a reporter at a Mexican weekly publication called Zeta. Zeta is a Tijuana-based independent publication that was started in 1980 by a couple of free spirits who got fed up with the restraints imposed/endured by most Mexican publications and who simply wanted to report whatever they felt like it. That, along with the actual good reporting, quickly made Zeta a 'go to' source for news in Baja California.

Enter the drug-wars... Sergio and others at Zeta tell the stories of the immense pressure they feel when reporting on the drug cartels. Along the way we learn that in the 6 year period between 2006 and 2012, more than 40 journalists were murdered in Mexico. (Unfortunately, there is no additional updated info on the DVD as to what happened in the 2 years since 2012. I suspect things have not gotten better.) When the documentary concludes, informing us that Sergio is writes for Zeta every week, once can't help but feel the greatest respect and admiration for him and others in Mexico who choose/feel compelled to write about the drug cartels, despite the great risk they take by doing so.

This DVD is perfect for use in social studies classes in high school, and in fact ""Reportero"" is a so(m)ber documentary that should be required viewing for all high school kids In the US. ""Reportero"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1422144000,5,1499,4.8062015503875966
