7793601,5,0949906891,"Big Bang Cosmology requires that there is no unique center to the universe. In this DVD, John Hartnett provides a very convincing case for biblical creation and why recent studies indicate that our galaxy is indeed near the center of the universe (redshift quantization) and that galaxies tend to be grouped in (conceptual) spherical shells concentric around our home galaxy, the MIlky Way. This view is only possible if our galaxy is positioned near the center of the universe as moving slightly away from the center would not have allowed us to see what we are seeing. John Hartnett discuss why this is evidence against Big Bang Cosmology and in favor of a galactocentric cosmology.

If some of the terms above seem foreign to you, do not worry. John Hartnett explains all these terms so that the DVD is easy to understand with diagrams greatly helping even the lay person to understand.

Highly Recommended!",1377820800,3,910,4.902597402597403
