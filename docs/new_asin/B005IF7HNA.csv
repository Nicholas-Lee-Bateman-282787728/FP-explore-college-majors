4709362,5,B005IF7HNA,"Yes it had bad/cheesy acting (from the American, no less), but it works. It's just a fun, more adult themed Doctor Who-ish show. I decided to just get the whole series, instead of buying them seperately. It's actually a well made series, with decent characters and decent effects. Worth watching, if you like your Sci-Fi on the side of different.",1355097600,,346,4.783333333333333

4709372,4,B005IF7HNA,"With the exception of Miracle Day, everything worked great. Although I have thought that it might be certain types of BluRay players. I use my ps3 for everything so that may be the problem for the Miracle Day set. I plan on just buying it separate from an American source and that be that. It's a great buy.",1406419200,,307,4.310344827586207
4709373,5,B005IF7HNA,"I'd read that other people had issues getting Miracle Day to actually play, but the set was on sale. Plus, I'd already watched series 1-3 on Netflix while house sitting for my sister and was too emotionally scarred from Children of Earth to move on to the next series just yet anyways. So I figured if it didn't work, it would just prove that I needed more time than usual to heal.

Well, several weeks later I've finally decided to try the last set out, and everything works just fine. And at the risk of sounding like I'm not still totally devastated by CoE (which, just for the record, I most definitely am) I even actually enjoyed it. I hadn't had high hopes, having read both the synopsis for the series and the words of an angry wholigan on the comments of a random Facebook page, but it was pretty good. It's different. I won't say I don't prefer the previous three series. But I think the being different bit was half the fun of it.

So yeah, I guess that's it. Fun show. Dvds worked. Hours of entertainment. *thumbs up*",1401148800,7,1028,4.37696335078534
4709374,5,B005IF7HNA,At first I was reluctant to buy this due to the reported problems had with the discs for season four Miracle Day. I had no such problems and really liked this show.,1398556800,,164,4.15625
4709375,5,B005IF7HNA,"I watched this series on BBC America. It was an offshoot of Doctor Who. So like Doctor Who, it has wacky characters, aliens and situations. They basically fight the baddy of the week but there were also seasonal arcs. I liked all the actors who were in the show. My favorites were Captain Jack and Gwen Cooper. An immortal and a regular cop who solved the crimes with the other characters. I looked forward to watching it every week.

For the Sci-Fi fan, this is a great show to watch.",1396656000,,485,4.388888888888889
4709376,5,B005IF7HNA,I had no problem with the last series that others have complained isn't region free.  I have an LG combo H-D/Blu-Ray machine that is a behemoth (and cost $700 way back when) that has no problem playing the series on my Panasonic Plasma TV 2010 model.  The transfer is great in picture and sound and the show was much better than I expected.  This is definitely the way to watch it!  I'd recommend it.,1394755200,2,400,4.364864864864865
4709377,3,B005IF7HNA,"I chose this set because it was the ""complete"" set meaning it included Miracle Day. However, like many others mention here, Miracle Day does not play in my Sony Blu0Ray player. The only difference I can see with the Miracle Day series and the other 3 is on the ""Video Format"" specs on the box - Miracle Day says ""high definition 16:9"" and the other 3 series say ""standard definition 16:9."" All my research into the various players doesn't specify any difference, so I'm guessing my player is just too old.

I'm wondering if all the Miracle Day series sold separately are like this, or if its just the Miracle Day version in this ""complete"" set? In other words, do I spend another $30 plus for the separate Miracle Day series or spend $100 plus on a newer blu-ray player? I can't find the answer anywhere, and if it's the former, why can't that one series be exchanged?

Bottom line is don't buy this set unless you're willing to take a chance Miracle Day won't play.",1389398400,2,966,4.482954545454546
4709378,3,B005IF7HNA,"Firstly, the rating I gave is for the product functionality itself and not of the actual show (content).  That being said, as others have stated, the Miracle Day discs do not work correctly.  When inserted into my Panasonic blu-ray player, it first goes through various cycles of trying to read/load the disc then play it.  This process takes quite a long time.  After it finally does get the disc to play, the whole bottom half of the screen is blocked with a white bar (no bar per se - the bottom half is just white).

However, the exact same Miracle Day discs work fine on my Xbox One and a Samsung blu-ray player elsewhere in the house.  They load much faster and perform just as a blu-ray player/disc should.  We made sure to update the firmware on the Panasonic, but nothing changed.

I must point out that all of the discs for seasons 1-3 work fine.  This, along with the fact that Miracle Day did in fact work on 2 other players, is why I gave it 3 stars.",1388880000,,963,4.335195530726257

4709380,2,B005IF7HNA,"Series gets five stars, but this set only gets two. I took a chance after hearing some people couldn't get Miracle Day to play, and I had the same problem. It's a shame, since most Torchwood sets are missing it, and I can't stream it from Amazon, Netflix or Hulu.",1385942400,,263,4.28
4709381,4,B005IF7HNA,I love this series and I'm kind of torn about giving this set just 4 stars but as many have noted you will probably have a problem playing the Miracle Day disks. While I like the idea that you can author a disk region free and any player will play it. Unfortunately this is not the case. But there are players that will play both these 50i disks AND the US disks you are used to! You can find a list of players here [...] Note only some actually convert 50 to 60 and that is what you want. The good news is most appear to be less than $100 if you can find them. If like me you watch a lot of BBC it is worth the investment. I bought the LG Electronics BP530 Blu-ray Disc Player with Wi-Fi as it was the only one on the list I could find locally. (Was worried about maybe having to try multiple models.) It works great! You CAN also get them to play on your PC IF you have a Bluray drive AND VLC with the aacs decoder added (google VLC Bluray) but you will still have to load them via the file menu with no menus and play the titles like files. The other PC players I tried did not like them at all but maybe one will.,1384473600,,1117,3.9035087719298245
4709382,5,B005IF7HNA,A solid spinoff. Not nearly as light hearted as Dr. WHO  though but def worth the watch to see how Earth and Cptn Jack deal,1379635200,,123,3.92
4709383,2,B005IF7HNA,"All of the discs work fine except the Miracle Day series. I read the reviews from people that said they had the same problem, but ordered the box set anyway hoping to get lucky. That was not the case. Amazon should pull this set until the problem is resolved. The two star rating is based on the non-working discs and does not reflect the show's content. As far as the show itself; five stars all the way. This is a great television show.",1379635200,3,438,4.289156626506024
4709384,1,B005IF7HNA,"Another reviewer has already reported the same issue - the 4 discs for Miracle Day don't work for some reason.  I contacted Amazon and they very helpfully offered to issue a return label and refund my cost if I chose to return all discs.  Of course, I could always then re-order the collection but I'm a bit leery of this seller now.  Anyway, Amazon is willing to work with you if you contact them.  Too bad, Torchwood is a great series and I was looking forward to seeing MD.",1377388800,3,476,4.314606741573034
4709385,3,B005IF7HNA,Am a fan of Doctor Who and had seen the Torchwood Episode. Started to check out the series. It's okay from what could watch because half of the DVD/Blue Ray Disks didn't work. From what could see it just had a dfifferent vibe and Most Certainly for Adults Only!,1374710400,2,261,4.346938775510204
4709386,5,B005IF7HNA,"I'd already seen Torchwood on Netflix and have been wanting to get it on DVD or blu ray for a while. Unfortunately both Doctor Who and Torchwood and frequently highly over prices. On top of that the Torchwood ""box sets"" would be missing either the Miracle Day or Children of Earth specials but be titles ""the complete series"".
So imagine my surprise when I see this on Amazon one day and it has all four series and specials included and for cheaper than what I'd have had to spend buying them individually or one box set and the one individual missing. Not to mention they are actually in a format that US players can actually read!!
When you get the box set it's awesome!! The series are in the same casing as if I'd purchased all off them separately. So it's defiantly a steal I you want to make the best out of your money and complete the series in one go!!
I'm so happy with my purchase and all of my discs work perfectly.",1369526400,14,926,4.297142857142857

4709388,5,B005IF7HNA,"I recently saw an episode of Torchwood broadcast on BBC America.  It was the first time I had watched the tv show.  It was thrilling in so many ways...science fictiony, intelligent, moody, action-packed, sexy, imaginative, beautifully filmed, and totally enthralling!  I found a Blu-ray boxed set of the complete show here on Amazon and am loving being able to throw a disc in and get lost in Mr. Barrowman's eyes and grin and Gwen's home life whenever I want.",1360195200,,460,4.7974683544303796

4709391,3,B005IF7HNA,"I received the blu-ray complete box series of Torchwood - seasons 1 & 2 and the mini-series ""Children of Earth"" (CoE) and ""Miracle Day"" (MD).  Everything was running smoothly until I opened the MD set of discs - NONE PLAYED! There are four discs in the MD collection and none of them played! I tired my other blu-ray player with the same result. I could not figure out what was special about the MD discs that wouldn't allow them to play versus the discs from seasons 1&2 and the CoE?? Will be sending it back but this definitely discourages me from further video purchases.

8474578,2,B005IF7HNA,"Not even close to the Dr Who series.  Rather disappointed with the intentional ""in your face"" forced view of homosexual relations.  It doesn't fit in  with the storyline and is a waste of time. I'm not against homosexual people (I have friends who are and I think they're awesome people who deserve respect) I honestly feel like I'm being forced to look at a sexual choice that I personally do not partake in on a daily  basis.  This as with all relationships should remain private.",1458777600,,482,4.623529411764705
8474579,4,B005IF7HNA,"As others posted with other listings, Season 4, Miracle Day, does not work in a lot of US players, especially Sony. The vendor, Price Clock, did send us a list of players that would work (http://forum.blu-ray.com/showthread.php?t=95245), and offered a refund, so it was a pleasant experience anyway.

As for the show itself... If you are looking at this listing, you know it is great. Heck, you've probably watched them all already. If you haven't, Season 4, Miracle Day, does have more of an American feel, and, unlike Season 3, Children of Earth, Season 4 feels like the writers are making things up as they go. Still binge-worthy, of course.

The image quality is much better than the DVD version.",1452038400,4,700,4.873949579831932
8474580,1,B005IF7HNA,"I recently became a fan of the new Doctor Who series around season 7.  I had mixed feelings about the Captain Jack character, but when I learned there were 4 spin-off seasons, I decided to give it a try.  British produced sets shipped to the US tend to be a bit pricey, so when I saw this used set at a reasonable price for $42, I figured I could not go wrong.  I was about 75% correct.  Other reviews of this product stated that some of the sets worked and some did not because it was in the PAL format.  I did not have time to sit down and watch this entire set, so I decided to preview each season.  Seasons 1, 2, and 3 worked perfectly, so I thought my fears were unfounded.  When I put in Season 4, aka Miracle Day, I was greeted with a black screen and an odd menu described to me.  There was no picture at all whatsoever.  I tried playing it on my computer and got the same results.  A little research revealed that seasons 1-3 are NTSC and season 4 is in PAL.  What idiot chose to mix the two formats?  I have purchased other British imports that were in the NTSC format, but this was the first one to give me any trouble.

I only have a few options at this point.  I could ask the seller for a partial refund so that I can buy the 4th season separately although it isn't his fault that an idiot put together this package for him to sell.  I could return the whole set and pay two to three times as much for the American version.  Individual sets are about the cost of the entire set.  I could contact the BBC distributor to try to get season 4 exchanged for an NTSC version.  For about $275, I could buy a new blu-ray player that plays NTSC and PAL formats.  If the BBC is this stupid, this may happen again in the future and I would like to be ready.  If I had a time displacement device, I could go back in time to prevent me from buying this set.  If I get a new season 4 set, I suppose I would give it 4 stars overall.  Until then, it gets one star for the individual season cases and negative stars for mixing the format.  Perhaps I can save someone else the frustration of buying a bait and switch product.  I don't think the doctor would approve of this companion set either.  Boycott it until they get it fixed.",1449792000,,2228,4.066666666666666
