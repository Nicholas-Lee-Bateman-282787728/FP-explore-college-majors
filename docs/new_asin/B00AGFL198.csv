8551363,3,B00AGFL198,"Joe Conklin is one of the funniest people on earth, and he is still one of my favorites. But, I think Joe, and his fans, would be better off, if he would just release a CD of his incredible impressions. Unlike Rob Bartlett, Joe is best on the radio., I am happy to support his work. And, I am not angry at him for releasing this DVD. But, it is a throw-away. Unless I have missed something, it will probably never see the drawer of my DVD player again. He's a Philly treasure. But, he can do better work. Having seen Joe in person and listened to him on the radio for twenty years, I could be convinced that the company that produced and edited this DVD is to blame. Maybe they had it out for him.",1364169600,,697,4.094890510948905
8551364,5,B00AGFL198,Screamin' A. Smith and The Cash Crab bits are just amazing..hilarious and creative.  The stand up routine at Ponzio's is classic Conklin..the Bryzgalov bit and the jewish jokes crack me up every time.  I'll miss the Andy Reid and Nnamdi jokes..,1363219200,,244,4.926829268292683
8551365,4,B00AGFL198,Joe Conklin is very funny and his voices are amazing. This captures him reasonably well. Sometimes he is better spontaneously on radio or in shorter doses in public.,1357430400,,165,4.928571428571429
