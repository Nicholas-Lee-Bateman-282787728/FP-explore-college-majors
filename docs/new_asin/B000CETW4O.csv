The background music was over powering, making this DVD nearly worthless.  I bought 2 movies from the same producer and they were the same in very poor sound quality, thus I doubt the DVD was the actual flaw.  Look for other instructional videos.",1338508800,,350,4.421875
8599393,5,B000CETW4O,"This is an excellent video for beginners. I watched this before I started my first batch of homebrew and it gave a lot of information not found on most websites. It was also very helpful being able to watch the process before I undertook it myself. Another thing I really like about this is that while it's made by the 'Learn to Brew' group, it is strictly a how-to video rather than an opportunity to advertise themselves and their website.",1190505600,,441,4.525
