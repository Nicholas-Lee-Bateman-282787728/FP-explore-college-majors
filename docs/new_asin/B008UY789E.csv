8530639,5,B008UY789E,"CREEPY CREATURE DOUBLE FEATURE.  VOLUME 2
THE CRAWLING HAND/SLIME PEOPLE
Here we have two very good transfers of 2 very guilty pleasures.  Again VCI goes all the way with stuff one would not think deserving of the lavish release that this certainly is.
The highlight for me was the conversation with Roger Corman and `50s top guru of the genre, Tom Weaver.  Tom has been interviewing people since forever, it seems, and he knows exactly how and what to ask his interviewee in order to get all the facts down for the history books.  His conversation here with Susan Hart is a perfect example of a ""Weaver-talk"" that comes off absolutely cozy and informative.
Thank you VCI!  I only wish that ALL vintage Horror-Sci Fi-Fantasy films could have the coverage that these two admittedly minor but schlockingly fun films are given here.  There are a handful of commentators who are worth the purchase of a DVD no matter what film is contained therein.  Mr. Weaver is right at the top of these select few.  Please, VCI, keep this guy busy!
Also see Creepy Creature Double Feature Vol. 1 with THE MONSTER FROM THE OCEAN FLOOR and SERPENT ISLAND.  The same excellence (and Mr. Weaver) is there also.

Later: This review is for the VCI CREEPY CREATURE DOUBLE FEATURE.  VOLUME 2.  Not sure what this DVD is, but you want the VCI edition and not this one.",1367366400,,1342,4.639830508474576
