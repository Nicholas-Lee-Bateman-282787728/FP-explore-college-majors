3122971,5,B00144K5M4,I am starting a collection of classic TV shows.  We watch very little TV in our house..We don't have and never did have cable so what do watch has to be very good..The kids like Bob Newhart---truely funny without the dummied down bathroom humor and booty calls of today's shows.,1223683200,26,278,4.56
3122972,5,B00144K5M4,"This is an all-time classic show. Like many of the reviewers here, I couldn't wait for this box set to come out. I bought the seasons as they were released. It has been more than two years since Fox released the fourth season. Same goes for another absolute 1970s class, The Mary Tyler Moore Show. It can't be about sales. These were both very popular shows in their day. They both are as funny as ever - even funnier now in the sense that by watching them these days you see the obvious weakness in the writing of modern tv. I've had it with waiting. There is lots on my wish list. Fox is not getting another penny from me until they start releasing the remaining seasons of these two MTM classics. That's it. End of discussion. Are the Fox bean counters listening yet?",1218412800,28,770,4.354166666666667

3123007,2,B00144K5M4,"Not a good sitcom.  Every character in the show but Emily was nuts or just plain stupid.  Every plot was goofy.  Didn't care for it.

Didn't compare with other comedies of those times.  All in the Family and MTM was 100% better.  Yes, sometimes I thought MTM  should be called the Ted Baxter show, because unlike so many others who loved him, he got on my nerves mainly because there was way too much of him.  The repeats in the writing for him were pretty boring, and often I fast forwarded it.  But all in all, with the exception of too much of Ted and his goofy girl friend, I liked the show a lot, especially Lou Grant, Mary, Rhoda and Phyllis.  I remember years ago, they come on right after each other.  I watched them both, but really didn't care much for the Bob Newhart show.  I think his 2nd show about the his guest house was a little better.",1255910400,,853,4.229813664596273
3123008,5,B00144K5M4,"Bob Newhart plays everyone's favorite psychologist located in Chicago in the 1970s.  Some shows don't hold up well over time but this one does. The central reason is Newhart himself, whose comedy has always been based upon the ordinary person's foibles. Newhart never did political humor, profane humor, sexual humor, etc., The problem is that those kinds of comedy date very easily as prevailing attitudes change.  However, ordinary man has the same problems with his personality and his relationships now as he did in the 1970s. Newhart's patients are hilarious. Perhaps the best known was Elliott Carlin, the Chicago real estate hot shot who was a total disaster in his personal life. Group therapy was also a riot on Newhart.  Newhart's supporting wife, played by Suzanne Pleshette, was a very good foil for him.  His neighbor, the dimwit airplane navigator, was also funny, especially when he got interested in Newhart's sister. There were the other doctors and his secretary in his office building too.  The most obvious way this is dated is there is not a single computer in sight.  Also, the fashions are pure '70s, not exactly a fashion decade anyone cares to remember.  Other than that though, it doesn't seem dated at all.
