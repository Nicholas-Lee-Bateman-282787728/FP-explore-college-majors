Note:  this review is NOT an endorsement for the upcoming feature film, which I will NOT be seeing.  (Despite my deep admiration for the talented Bill Murray as the voice of Garfield)",1083888000,25,2327,4.215730337078652

More Volumes to come soon (for all 121 Garfield & Friends shows total), as well as all the Prime Time specials!!!  Look to christmas time for Vol 2 and another 'Specials' DVD
This is definately a 5-Star Rating!!!",1083456000,4,368,4.382352941176471

Garfield and Friends has sophisticated humor as well as slapstick, so it's fun for the whole family.  I also just read that the 2nd volume should be out by Christmas, which is awesome. This is not just another big fat hairy deal! This is as great as a week without Mondays and lasagna every night! Woohoo!",1083110400,,436,4.64935064935065
493539,5,6302665396,"This movie isn't necessarily for fans of traditional Garfield cartoons.  It is very unlike any Garfield strip I have ever seen but it is still wonderful.  I watched this movie for the first time when I was 4 years old, and my family taped it.  I am now 19 and I still have the same copy which I watch once in a while.  The stories are different, some are beautiful, some are funny, and some are sci-fi.  The story of Diana will always be my favorite as the story is beautiful, as is the artistic method used during that story.",1076803200,7,526,4.22

493574,5,6302665396,"Episodes 25 to 48 of Garfield and Friends are in volume 2, which include the end of the original theme song ""Friends are There"" and the beginning of the show's most famous song ""We're Ready to Party"", which was always used for syndicated prints of the show! Garfield's sense of humor was catching on in TV cartoons by this time, starting the wild and crazy days of the 1990's, not just for Hanna-Barbera, but for many TV cartoons of the 1990's, including the earliest Nicktoons, causing TruTV's World's Dumbest series to make hurtful jokes about ""nineties cartoons"" (The 1990's was the bulk of the Disney Renaissance and Pixar's early years, the ignorant twit-like commentators)! Also with the new theme song, from here to the end of the series, the disc subtitles misinterpret the refrain ""of spaghetti"" with ""I'm scared"". You never know when something might be misinterpreted on home video via VHS, DVD, or even Blu-ray, via Closed-captioning or disc subtitles. Garfield's sense of humor was thankfully nothing like today's reality shows, even AFV itself; Garfield and Friends was where both kids and grownups can watch the show and laugh about it, without being offended in any way, like SpongeBob would later do! Too bad these volume sets aren't made on DVD anymore, only as Digital Download form by Anderson Digital. If they can re-release Garfield's original holiday specials on DVD, they can do the same with his original TV series, right down to every mention of the Klopman Diamond in the show! Like I keep saying, just be thankful for what you have!",1432166400,2,1559,4.909090909090909
493575,5,6302665396,"If you don't like the current CGI Garfield TV series, than there's nothing better than the original with Garfield and Friends! What's more, every show on DVD isn't a syndicated version, but the original versions that debuted on CBS from 1988 to 1994, albeit international prints in the case of U.S. Acres being renamed Orson's Farm since most people outside the USA wouldn't get this gag! Alongside Garfield and Friends came the debut of another personal fave of mine; The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, which sadly never got the DVD treatment Disney was giving to other series like DuckTales, Darkwing Duck, The Gummi Bears, Talespin and others, which Fox gave to Garfield and Friends before they stopped making these incredible volume sets by 2014. Instead of the theme familiar to us in syndication, the original theme song is intact for this volume and over half of volume 2, ""Friends are There"", which was hummed by characters in those days, even in syndication. Every show consisted of 2 Garfield segments with a U.S. Acres segment sandwiched in between, along with Garfield and U.S Acres Quickies throughout each show. I only remember seeing this iconic series on Nick and in syndication, but it still made an impact on my toon expertise to this day, due to Garfield's wacky sense of humor and gently poking fun at cultural and televised things without cursing or hurting anyone's feelings, like political comics and modern comedians generally do. Even U.S Acres' characters were no stranger to such humor, even with musical numbers in each episode (which some later Disney shows would do, like The Book of Pooh & Phineas and Ferb); no wonder that over 40% of the show's audience on CBS were grownups! Maybe someday, Anderson Digital can re-release Garfield and Friends on DVD in restored forms, like with their Walmart-exclusive Holiday Collection in 2014. For the time being, if you have all 5 volume sets of Garfield and Friends, just be thankful for what you have!",1432166400,,1979,4.92814371257485

493597,5,6302665396,"Garfield & Friends shines as the so-called ""Silver Age"" of Garfield...never understood how this was the Silver Age, as the Golden Age was the older, saggy Garfield and included a number of forgettable characters. Volume Two of the series has a number of memorable cartoons.  As with all the G&F volumes, the US Acres segments are hit-or-miss; usually episodes with songs in them are ""miss"", while the others are pretty good stuff.  The Garfield episodes, however, contain voicing from Pat Buttram (voice of the Sheriff of Nottingham in Disney's ""Robin Hood"" & Napoleon in ""The Aristocats"") and a number of other classic cartoon voice actors. These episodes have started coming out in digital format, but they're inexplicably slow to release (legalese and reproduction arguments with PAWS, Inc. are the usual suspects), so I highly recommend getting these DVDs before they're impossible to find.",1374537600,,894,5.244755244755245

Ah, this is the same great cartoon I remember from childhood.  Please note that this is not an HD version, so it initially seemed a little ""off"" compared to the crisp picture we are accustomed to seeing on big-screen HD televisions these days.  After a few minutes, however, one recalls that the picture is exactly like it was when the episodes originally aired, adding to the feeling of nostalgia.  I am so glad this video collection is available so I can share the ""original"" Garfield with my children.",1371340800,,619,4.747663551401869

493621,5,6302665396,"I watched a few episodes of The Garfield Show. The CGI was neat, but Garfield was out of character and most of the gags fell flat! The live action Garfield movies suffered from similar problems. Although, Bill Murray was a good choice for the voice of Garfield. I've been a Garfield fan ever since I was a 2 year old sucking on a bottle. I once had a Garfield birthday cake. In the 1980's, plush Garfield toys that stick to your car window were trendy. Garfield was created by cartoonist Jim Davis in the late 1970's. Garfield TV specials were adapted for network TV in the 1980's. Actor Lorenzo Music was Garfield! When we think of Garfield's ""voice"", we think of his voice. In the comics, Odie joined the cast when Jon's friend Lyman left him at his house. The humor in the Garfield comics is dry and sardonic. They poke fun of Mondays, fad diets, popular movies, con artists, etc. The look of Garfield, Jon and Odie has been refined over the years. Garfield and Friends was a great Saturday morning cartoon on CBS. It lasted from 1988-1993. It delivered in quality and quantity. The show was filled with US Acres cartoons. In England, US Acres is known as ""Orson's Farm"". The music on Garfield and Friends is good considering the limited budget.
I like the episode where Garfield and Odie dance to polka music on the sidewalk. It makes little sense, but it's funny!
In another episode, Jon, Odie, and Garfield have no place to hide from a B grade creature feature. The bad creature feature is also being shown on a Spanish language channel! The US Acres cartoons are almost as fun as Garfield. They spoofed everything from Star Trek to James Bond. It took me years to find out that Nermal was a male kitten voice by a female. In some dubbed versions, Nermal is refered to as ""She""! Garfield and Friends(1988-1993) presented Garfield in his purest, true form.",1368835200,,1861,4.591591591591592
493622,5,6302665396,had to have my title replaced after my first purchase was crushed. The outer box was fine but the contents were heavily damaged. It is terrible that the warehouse people did not care enough to include a proper item because there was no way the stocker didn't see the damage. Amazon was very prompt to replace it. I also purchased two other seasons that arrived separately and they were equally damaged. My request for replacement did specifically ask them to double check the item for damage before shipping. My replacements were excellent.,1359331200,,540,4.880434782608695
493623,3,6302665396,"These sets contain the international version of the show.  That means all of the ""US Acres"" segments are called ""Orson's Farm"" (its international name). As for volume 1, it does not contain the more iconic episodes of the series and used the ""Friends are There"" intro instead of the more well remembered ""We're ready to Party."" Also, these episodes originally aired before the show was on CBS Saturday mornings which is where I always saw it, so I don't recognize any of the episodes in this set.",1348012800,,496,4.7011494252873565
493624,5,6302665396,"Garfield & Friends is one of my favorite Saturday Morning cartoons from my childhood. Half of the things that Garfield says can't be said today on TV! I bought the DVD set back in 2004 on the day that it came out, and I've enjoyed it ever since. ""Heatwave Holiday"" is my favorite from this set, where Jon, Garfield, and Odie decorate the house for Christmas in July, so they could think it was 'cool' when it was actually hot outside. The whole town picks up on it and there is Christmas decorations everywhere.

493626,5,6302665396,"I used to watch Garfield every week when I was a child.  I bought the DVD's becasue I remembered the cartoon so fondly that I wanted to see it again.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that Garfield is really funny to me now, even as an adult.  There is just enough sarcastic humor to make me laugh in every episode.  Garfield is a classic!  I only wish children of this generation could see more of the quality that was around in the past instead of the violence or intellectually stunting shows that seem to pervade the television today.",1308096000,,540,4.414141414141414
493627,4,6302665396,"I'm sure the other reviews go into detail about how good this show is. I still think the show is funny at age 26. I used to watch this in the morning while waiting for the bus to pick me up before school. It's just a great show.

What I like the MOST about these releases is how the company didn't pull the usual crummy tricks in order to get the most amount of money from the customer. Even though there are seven seasons for this show, they squished all of the episodes into five released volumes! BRAVO FOR THIS MOVE! Each volume has 24 episodes (volume 5 has 25 episodes in order to complete the series). Specifically, this first volume actually contains all 13 episodes of season 1 along with 11 episodes of season 2.

I actually would have been happy with having each season be its own release since all seasons are between 13 and 26 episodes so this is a great bonus. It makes me so mad when a series is released in partial volumes that only contain 4-6 episodes and you are essentially paying for the show one disc at a time even though the DVD costs as much as a full season would.

Hopefully people buy all five volumes because this show definitely deserves it.

The only reason I rate this as a four-star is because it still seems like companies don't take the time to remaster and fix the video quality of their shows. even though this is a show from the late 80s/early 90s, it has the potential to look much better with a little work. just check out these comparisons:

[...]

I'm just an amateur when it comes to video encoding so I'm guessing that a studio should be able to get even better results if the spent a little extra time on it. Other than that, this is a great value.",1303257600,,1693,4.275

I returned it to the supplier and they sent me a new set, it is a little better but the colors still fade in and out.  In the meantime I bought a Garfield holiday DVD from Target and it has the same problem.  I suspect that the problem lies with 20th Century Fox themselves, 3 DVD sets from 2 different sources all with the same problem.  I certainly won't waste my money on any more, how disappointing!",1264550400,,690,4.359375

493656,5,6302665396,"I was 14/15 when this show premiered in the UK and I used to watch it every Saturday.  Garfield is kind of a personal hero for me (fat, lazy, cynical and darned proud of it).

18 years later, I moved to Australia and my Garfield video-tapes were in a box that went missing enroute.  Aaargh!!  Much whining and gnashing of teeth.

Finally, I decided to take the chance that a Region 1 DVD would work in my cheap Region 4 player and ordered Vols 1, 2, 3 and 5 (4 wasn't in stock at the time).

The risk paid off.  I've managed to get my Garfield fix once more and have just ordered Volume 4 from this site.  I can't believe how the humour hasn't aged.  Sometimes certain shows have a sell-by date, as it were.  Not Garfield!  Highly entertaining both for kids and big kids too.  The special features aren't much to write home about, being mainly trailers for films (a little out of date now).  I would have liked to see some ""behind the scenes"" things, but who really buys DVDs because of special features?

All in all, a very good buy.",1252972800,,1034,4.262886597938144

Odie and Jon are also great with Odie slurrping all the time and Jon doing funny things. This is a great collection of Garfield if you like cartoons.

This show is just as funny and charming, if not more so, than it was to me years ago. I don't think I can name any other show, movie, book, etc. that has done that before. An all-around enjoyable show for all ages.

I feel I should also mention the lack of special features. No reason to deter you from enjoying these DVDs, though.

The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, however, is that for some insane reason they replaced the beloved theme song with some annoying little number that seems to drag on far too long. Other than that everything's great. But that's annoying. Just... annoying.",1149465600,2,718,4.311111111111111

This is my favorite cartoon of all-time, because these are real people with real problems.  You don't see this in cartoons.  Garfield is different than any cat and he doesn't go by the book like any other cats, makes me want to buy a cat myself. Garfield is like human in a cat suit.

493678,5,6302665396,"I have always been offended by cartoons that revolve around the suffering of cats. It may interest the cat hating writers of ""Tom and Jerry,"" ""Itchy and Scratchy,"" and ""Sylvester and Tweety"" to know that during certain plagues, mice wiped out frighteningly huge numbers of people. If it had not been for cats, the human race may not have survived these plagues. Well, that said, this dvd box set of Garfield is a wonderful addition to any dvd library. If you are reading this, you probably don't need me to tell you that the story revolves around a cat named Garfield who loves lasagna. (Not to mention getting the better of his owner John.) What makes this cartoon so wonderful is that it really does offer insight into what may be going through the mind of a cat. Obviously, while Garfield hears John and understands what he is saying, John can not hear Garfield's comments. (So we have kind of a Shakespeare technique. Virutally all of Garfield's comments are like an 'aside' in Shakespeare. While the audience hears the 'asides' of the character, the other characters on stage do not. Garfield's ways  kind of allow us to realize that our cats may very well think that they run the show, and that we are their servants so to speak. I could go on and on, but there is no need for that. Some standout episodes are: ""Peace and Quiet"" where Garfield is just trying to get some rest which proves impossible, ""Fraidy Cat"" where Garfield and Odie get really scared watching a monster movie, ""Good Mousekeeping"" where Garfield uses his intelligence to get rid of mice, ""Up A Tree"" where Garfield is jealous of another cat Nermal, ""Cabin Fever"" where Garfield and Odie are trapped in cabin without food, ""Magic Mutt"" where Garfield uses his intelligence to outsmart a dog, ""Green Thumbs Down"" where John decided to beat food prices by planting a garden, ""Rip Van Kitty"" where Garfield dreams that he has napped for 20 years, ""Heatwave Holiday"" where Garfield, John, and Odie unknowingly start Christmas in July, and ""Maine Course"" where Garfield, John, and Odie DO NOT have the heart to eat a lobster that was sent to them. Moving on, the ""U.S. Acres"" cartoon is an additional delight. If you are reading this, you probably already know about the characters. (Orson Pig, the level headed leader, but now and then gets caught up in his books, Roy Roster, who likes practical jokes, but doesn't want anyone to really get hurt, and Wade Duck, who is really paranoid, but does rise above his fears in important matters. This is a great cartoon in that while they have their disputes, they really don't want anyone to be hurt. (They are in a sense like normal friends.) Some standouts include ""Wanted Wade,"" where poor Wade accidentally tears the tag off of a pillow and is frightened that he will go to jail for it, ""Return of Power Pig,"" where miscommunication of an event leads Orson and others to believe that a monster has invaded the farm, ""Keeping Cool,"" where Bo Sheep defeats Orson's bully brothers by 'just stayin cool,' ""Shy Fly Guy,"" where Wade is determined to overcome his fear of flying, ""Goody Go Round,"" where Orson has to teach everyone about sharing, and ""Double Oh Orson"" where Orson reads a spy book and sees himself and his friends as the characters. (Even after he puts the book down.) This dvd box set is a MUST for anyone who loves cats as well as someone who would like to see a nice cartoon where different characters remain friends despite their differences. KUDOS TO JIM DAVIS! No thanks whatsoever to Jerry, Tweety, or Itchy.",1136678400,2,3545,4.690208667736758
493679,4,6302665396,"I used to watch cartoons on Saturday all the time when I was a little boy. There was just so many of them that made me feel so wonderful. While many of them have been gone but not forgotten, there have been some of them that are based on those looney funnies. Garfield was one of them. Although today you just can't seem to fiind him on television anymore, his comics keep on meowing for more. But back in the 1980's, Garfield & Friends was a very popular cartoon series on CBS in the Saturday morning blocks that was very popular. The series which ran for a very long time has been a staple on the DVD market for a year, which brings a lasanga-loving feline his just deserts.

Garfield & Friends Volume 1, is a reflection of Garfield and his beginnings as a Saturday Morning cartoon. With his antics about and against Odie, Nermal and others, it is amazing just how funny the series was. There were just so many great cartoon episodes that just captured the imagination on his own, and with the addition of the farm antics of Orson Pig and pals with the lesser-known U.S. Acres. I loved so many of these classic cartoons like Nothing To Sneeze At, where Garfield is seriously allergic to a horrific plad coat Jon has, Peace and Quiet, which the somewhat annoying Binky The Clown has maintained a disturbance to Garfield and his hopeful slumbering, and Identity Crisis, that places Garfield in a probable problem from a dog catcher who thinks Garfield is a dog by his impersination of a barking canine, to just name a few.

The surprising thing is that there just aren't anymore Saturday morning cartoons that still keep the humorgoing anymore. Most of it is where you's eith have to go to cable, or sit and watch boring Saturday Morning news programs. Garfield and Friends Volume 1, is a great buy for anybody who is a fan of our favorite fat feline. This classic series is still as funny as it was made years ago.

The fat cat still makes me laugh after all these years.

My favorite episodes from season one has to be:

""Best in Show"" - Garfield enters into a cat show and has to go up against Nermal, the world's cutest kitten. I just love Nermal. He is so annoying but hilarious when he gets Garfield's goat.

""Identity Crisis"" - Garfield, a neighborhood dog, and a rat decides to try their hand at impersonating one another, and ends up confusing a local dog catcher.

""Up a Tree"" - Nermal pays another visit to Jon and Garfield. After getting kicked out of the house, Garfield goes climbs a tree.

""Tapioca Pudding Day"" - my favorite U.S Acres cartoon.

""Good Sportsmanship"" - I think that is what it is called. The gang decides to play pigball but unbeknownst to the gang, Roy secretly changes the rules. Non-stop laughs.

From 1988 until 1995 we relished with too much lasagna and ravioli while fearing giant radioactive mutant guppies. However, I have noticed one carefully edited part on one episode. On the episode ""Brain Boy,"" Jon and the guys are going to visit Jon's cousin Al. Jon asks, ""How did you guys learn to behave?"" It then cuts to Odie tied up with the back seatbelt. Originally, Garfield quipped: ""effective use of seatbelts."" Yet on this official DVD release, it has been edited out completely. Could this have been from complaints from parents so that their kids would not use seatbelts in such a fashion? Possibly. So far, this has been my only quibble with the series. Everything else (video transfer, features, scene access, etc) is perfect although I wish they kept Orson's segments as ""U.S. Acres"" and not changed it back to ""Orson's Farm.""",1123200000,2,938,4.7607361963190185
493703,5,6302665396,"Though labelled as a Saturday Morning show, Garfield and Friends was shown on weekday evenings over here. Obviously, as I've always been a Garfield fan, I loved the show when I was a kid but somehow I seemed to enjoy it more as a 24-year-old.

As proven before with the Garfield TV Specials, Jim Davis' big-eyed and colorful animation translates well to TV and it looks like his comic-strip has magically come to life. Lorenzo Music (sounding so much like Bill Murray) is brilliant as Garfield and acts out his boredom, deadpan humor and sarcasm perfectly.

U.S. Acres (or Orson's Farm as it was called here, as on this DVD) is also great, it's a shame there's no comic-strip of it. The characters, with the exception of the highly annoying Roy, are very cute and I just love Wade the cowardly duck. And, is it just me, or does Bo sound and behave exactly like Steve Zahn.

As you probably know, the show is a sandwich of two 8-minute Garfield shorts with an Orson's Farm in the middle. There are often a couple of 30-second 'quickies' to keep us that extra bit amused. Garfield and Friends is frequently laugh-out-loud hilarious and it's easy to see where later TV shows like The Simpsons or Family Guy take their cue from. It may not have been made for Prime Time but Garfield and Friends set some kind of standard for exactly how funny a 30-minute animated show should be.

I must also mention that the show has a constant musical score from beginning to end that is loads of fun and there is at least one song per episode too.

The DVDs are in 1.33:1 full frame, as originally drawn with Dolby Mono sound. But don't be fooled, the show looks and sounds great. The single extra feature in the whole set is a trailer for the (absolutely awful) Garfield movie that runs for less than a minute.",1113696000,9,1794,4.49079754601227
493704,5,6302665396,"""You're not Sylvia! You're one of the KUNG FU CREATURES ON THE RAMPAGE!""

This line to GARFIELD fans and lovers of great television animation is what WHO'S ON FIRST is to lovers of classic slapstick!

In either case, it's here on this set. The MOTHER of Garfield episodes, ""Video Airlines AKA Kung Fu Creatures on the Rampage 2"". If you're a harcore GARFIELD fan, you know the deal. If not, let me just warn you that you're in for some throat-clearing laughter, holding on to your belly, slapping your knees, and pounding your palms on the floor in hysteria while everyone else doubts your sanity!

There are some other equally precious perks of tom-foolery in this set. Jon buys a horrible used ""car"" from a shifty salesman and you have to see the results of this! The panty-waisted, Quiche-eating, sissified ""Care Bears"" created by the simpering do-gooder children's television killjoy watchdog types who nearly destroyed Saturday morning cartoons in the 80s are deservedly lampooned in ""The Buddy bears"" (Interesting to see what garfield would have done that disgusting Barney the dinosaur). Check out the Orson's Farm (later US Acres) parodies ""Hamelot,"" (where the barnyard crew search for the ""Holy Pail)"" ""Hog Noon,"" (where Orson the pig faces a childhood bully), and ""Ben Hog"" (must be seen to be beleived).

Hardcore Garfield fans will also be pleased to note that midway through the episodes, the bizarre and freakish original theme song for GAF ""Friends are There"" gives way to the classic ""We're ready to party we're ready/I hope you bring lots of spaghetti"" that is known and loved by fans of this show.

Garfield's class in comedy is also a must-see on this disc. The only thing I'm waiting for now (probabaly on disc 3) are GREAT MOMENTS IN STUPIDITY (where Jon stays on a broken escelator for 19 hours waiting for it to move) and the US ACRES segment in rhyme that parodies Poe's ""The Raven.""

If you come home from a hard day of work or are under unpleasant stress of any kind, this DVD will be just what the doctor ordered. The only thing you will suffer from after watchign this will be from laughing too hard!",1113609600,4,2129,4.7560975609756095
493705,5,6302665396,"When people talk about the animation revival of the late 1980s-early 90s, they usually mention such things as THE SIMPSONS, THE LITTLE MERMAID, ALADDIN, and ROGER RABBIT, but few but the fans will mention GARFIELD AND FRIENDS in the same breath as they should.

This show brought REAL WIT, LAUGHS, and FUN back into television animation along with our yellow, bug-eyed friends from Springfield. As a child of Bullwinkle, the Flintstones, and Fat Albert, I had LONG given up on cartoons by that time until a young lady I was dating in 1991 turned me on to GAF and I was hooked! Thank goodness the goody twoshoes children's advocate watchdog groups that DESTROYED cartoons in the late 70s and early 80s and ""Barneyized"" the genre were asleep at the wheel on this one!

Now back to this DVD. Later fans of the show WILL find the original theme song (NOT the amusing ""We're ready to party we're ready/I hope you bring lots of spaghetti"") bizarre and ""US Acres"" is titled ""Orson's Farm"" in these early episodes. But it's just as knee-slapping hardy-hoo-har-har fun as the later episodes. Loads of good stuff. Garfield mailing the annoying Nermal to Abu-Dhabi, Binky the clown annoying the hell out of everybody, Clueless Jon unsuccessfully trying to find love, Garfield sickened by the over-affectionate Odie (although an episode where Garfield sympathizes with the brainless pooch when he is bullied is rather touching), plus our main cat's never ending search for sleep, lasagna, and more lasagna are all in place, yet the series would never ""jump the shark.""

Looking forward to future volumes with the classics KUNG FU CREATURES ON THE RAMPAGE, HOW TO BE A DISC JOCKEY, the US Acres episode that spoofs Poe's ""The Raven"", etc. All ages can gather around the tube as with Bullwinkle and the best of the Hanna-Barbarians and enjoy this set!

493720,5,6302665396,"The early 'eighties were arguably an all-time low for cartoons. Then in 1983, four stars appeared to light the way. Alvin and the Chipmunks marked the recording rodents' return to TV, (absent since The Alvin Show in the 'sixties). Mickey Mouse, last seen in 1953's ""The Simple Things,"" re-entered the spotlight in Mickey's Christmas Carol. The Peanuts Gang got their own weekly slot on ""The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show."" And Jim Davis' fat cat made his first TV appearance in Here Comes Garfield. These four classic characters were in the vanguard of an animation revolution.

The undebated high point came five years later when Fox syndicated the wonderful weekly series, Garfield and Friends. It was everything other cartoon fare wasn't. Like Peanuts, it was paced to the comic. Long before Animaniacs, there were subtle send-ups of the state of the tube: the Buddy Bears parodying early attempts at ""educational"" cartoons, prompting Joe Barbara to proclaim he was in favor of cartoons that were ""mindlessly funny"" instead of ""mindlessly preachy."" It stands up now as a cartoon with high production values, and the series compares favorably with Film Roman's Garfield specials. Disney would bring the same high standard with its re-entry into weekday cartoons, beginning with Ducktales.

Then there was Lorenzo Music's inimitable voicing of Garfield. Characters frequently broke into song and dance numbers, but always stopping to wink at the audience, ""hey, you know it's a cartoon."" Running through the endlessly repeating set of a haunted house, Garfield would note that either monsters were afoot or the producers had been buying old Scooby Doo scripts. Orson Pig would read books, not to be educational, but always with pratfalls, slapstick and pure imagination. As other reviewers have noted, the early theme song is annoying. The better-known  and far wittier ""We're ready to party, we're ready"" with ""surprises and pies of all sizes"" takes over two thirds of the way into the second season. It's almost too great to watch an episode a day instead of once a week, as they originally aired, but as any fan of the lasagna-loving feline knows, too much Garfield is never enough.",1106784000,13,2186,5.117647058823529
493721,4,6302665396,"Garfield and Friends was always one of the funniest cartoons on TV when I was a young kid.  In fact, aside from your Looney Tunes, your Animaniacs and your Fairly Oddparents, I think it's one of the funniest cartoons ever.

There are a number of ""Quickies"" in this show that are short jokes, most of which are animated versions of actual comic strips, and at the show's midpoint, there is a cartoon originally called ""Orson's Farm"" and later called ""U. S. Acres,"" featuring a number of unique and amusing characters.  Orson; the pig voice of reason and the cultured one, Wade the eternal scaredy-cat duck, Roy the trick-playing rooster, Sheldon, the walking egg whose legs are the only part of him that are hatched, but who somehow has all manner of appliances in his shell, and so on and so forth.  These characters each have their own unique behavior patterns, but are funniest when some running-gag is introduced to their lives or when making fun of public service announcements (which is what I choose to interpret large parts of this cartoon as.)  However, virtually every time Orson and Friends come on, they wind up in a musical number, many of which are really quite trite.  However, I'm going to dismiss even many of these for a reason I will later outline.

The real meat of the show is Garfield himself, and he, Odie and Jon (and occasionally a guest-character or several) occupy two thirds of the show's longer segments.  Garfield and his supporting cast are quick with a joke and good at coming up with funny coincidences and/or well thought out cartoon gags a few times every minute, which may not seem like much where sheer volume is concerned, but when Garfield does it, it feels classy.

Many of Garfield's supporting characters get by largely on the strength of either a light-hearted parody (Cactus Jake,) a modified running-gag (Binky) or else an innocence that leads to them being funny in Garfield context or developing a funny joke without realizing it (Nermal.)

However, the most funny thing about Garfield and Friends is easily its tongue-in-cheek parodies of just about everything that occurred before and during the 80s.  Garfield was the master of the tongue-in-cheek parody.  His show showcased rather frequently concepts that were already very popular in animated cartoon shows (such as the public service announcement, the talent show, the cowboy episodes and so forth,) but these concepts, while only mildly interesting in something like The Flintstones or Scooby-Doo, are truly hilarious in Garfield because Garfield knows how trite these concepts are, smugly professes that, then uses them anyway and in some cases, even apologizes to the audience.  One that really stands out in my mind is when a half-staggering man tells Garfield, Jon and Odie to ""walk this way"" (another popular cartoon cliche of the time,) and he responds by looking right at the screen and saying ""Don't worry, folks.  We're not gonna do that stupid joke.""  I laugh every time I think about that.  Making fun of cliches is something I've always found wonderfully amusing.  I loved it in MST3K, I loved it in the Simpsons, and I love it in Garfield.

The quiet cynicism with which Garfield pulls off this lost art of making fun of the cliches appearing in one's own animated series sets a beautiful mood for humor, and when you think about it, sort of reminds you of a real cat's attitude.  This is Garfield's greatest strength and the reason I have excused so much of the Triteness of U. S. Acres.

""Garfield and Friends; Volume 1"" contains slightly more than one season of this wonderful show and introduces many of the characters that made the series so funny.  Garfield, Binky, Odie, Jon, Nermal, Cactus Jake, Liz and more all appear herein, perfectly faithful to the spirit of the comic strip, and in my opinion, way better than the movie.

I do have one gripe, however.  During the first two seasons of this show, the theme song was rather annoying (amusing, but annoying if heard more than once in the same afternoon.)  Still, it's worth it to get to see these great episodes again.  I hope you like them as much as I did.",1106524800,14,4136,4.799717912552891

It was orginally intended for adults, and this is a brilliant cartoon that's much darker than what you're used to coming from Garfield.

Like Eve, I ALSO watched this originally when I was 4 and still love it today at 19. So if you love Garfield and can just put god in a box for a moment, you will find this film very enjoyable.",1096502400,2,495,4.2105263157894735
493739,5,6302665396,"Whether you grew up watching the Saturday morning cartoon like I did, or you just jumped in the Garfield lovers bandwagon...this dvd will NOT disappoint. Maybe except the theme song. I used to watch Garfield and Friends faithfully every Saturday morning, now my 4 year old son watches it EVERY morning. It doesn't bother me one bit. I just pull up a chair and start laughing!",1093651200,3,375,4.696969696969697
493740,3,6302665396,"Thisis a great show and finally it's on DVD! I'm a 90's child so this DVD set was a breath of fresh air. The Garfield and Friends I'm used to was shorter and was different. Imagaine my surprise when I watched this and I heard a different theme song and discovered just how many ""quickies"" there were in the orginal broadcast! I had to watch all the episodes straight!

HOWEVER, I do have some gripes about this DVD set. Hence why I gave it a 3 rating. First off, the menus for these DVD set are all the same and there is no hint of what disc you're on. This is a none issue to many people but for someone like me who has a multiple disc DVD player and pops in an entire DVD set, it's a minor gripe. If I want a specific episode, I don't know if I'm at the right disc until I comb through the episode selection screen and find it. A simple ""Disc 1"" somewhere in the menu would have sufficed.

The second issue I have is the transfer. I picture isn't to  great compared to DVD standards and is quite obvious when you pause the screen as some of the lines are blurry. Again, a minor gripe since it's not too noticeable during viewing.

The last issue is the amount of extras (or the lack thereof to be exact). There is no extras on these DVDs. Actually, that's not true. On the last disc, there is the trailer for the new Garfield Live Action movie. The reason to get DVDs (other than having your favorite show, of course) is for the extras. Something a little more like an interview with Jim Davis, sketches, or somethiung would have been nice.",1091750400,6,1542,4.199324324324325
493741,5,6302665396,"It's great seeing this on DVD. What's even better is that the DVDs are exactly how the show was originally when it aired on CBS! Forget about the syndicated run that jumps from channel to channel and is currently on Toon Disney. That is nowhere near complete.

 Instead of the syndication run where you see this format:

 generic ""We're ready to party"" theme

 Garfield episode

 US Acres episode

 Garfield quickie

 generic ""We're ready to party"" closing theme,

 the ORIGINAL format is completely restored on the DVDs:

 Garfield quickie

 ""Friends are there"" opening theme song (""we're ready to party"" didn't come until a couple seasons later, but is the only theme song that is in the syndication run, even when they are showing the older episodes!!!!)

 Garfield Episode

 Orson's Farm quicke (original title cards have also been restored)

 Orson's Farm episode

 Garfield episode

 Garfield quickie (sometimes a ""Screaming with Binky"")

 ""friends are there"" closing theme

 So that's 3 quickies instead of 1, which means MUCH footage is lost on the syndicated run! Plus, the syndicated run apparantly often has the wrong credits, since there were a lot of guest voices on the show from time to time and they choose to use that same generic ""we're ready to party"" closing theme song for EVERY episode.

 Instead of watching it this way, get the DVDs. You'll be glad you did!",1091145600,11,1381,4.912280701754386
493742,5,6302665396,"This is a classic cartoon series with unusually clever comedy for a saturday morning kids show.  Garfield has this nonshalant casual charm, which is an uncommon source for comedy even among more mature t.v. programs and movies.  Unlike a lot of popular kids cartoons that are built to provide drama for children (e.g. Pokemon and its battles, Yu-Gi-Oh and its battles), this cartoon is about the sutle comedic muse of Garfield the cat.

I used to watch this cartoon every morning while I ate breakfast. I have to get to work so much earlier now so there is nothing on except for those both surprisly hypnotic and lame infomercials while I'm eating breakfast.  The dvd's let me enjoy a quick smile anytime I want.

I'm looking forward to the release of the release of the other seasons.",1091145600,4,785,4.700729927007299

They are great, classic cartoons, much better than anything created recently.  I don't really like the little packages that the DVD's are in.

I would watch this and Bugs Bunny and Friends, both old goodies which got replaced by new, crappy cartoons with political correctness (oh boy, we can't have the ""senseless violence of cartoons,"" stupid storylines, and just overall boringness.
I am a cheapskate, but this DVD set would be worth it.  I can't wait.
Now, if only they would release ALF, Night Court, Murphy Brown, Poltergeist the Legacy, PSI Factor, and Bugs Bunny and Friends, my tv DVD collection would be complete (don't want too many sets).",1087084800,,636,4.834862385321101
