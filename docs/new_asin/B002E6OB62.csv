Mrs Zawistiski shows quite clearly what she is telling you to do and why. I may need to  watch it a few times to get all the instructions correct, but that's the nice thing about owning it, you  can go back again and again.",1459123200,2,336,4.0
8366866,5,B002E6OB62,"This is an excellent video for beginner spinners. At times I had reviewed it several times. Patsy is very clear in her instructions. She starts you out by knowing your wheel and the parts of the wheel and different wheels. Then getting a good treadle rhythm. Different types yarn and its uses. She also teaches single, double and triple ply spinning. The only problem I had was the that the camera man did not always get close enough to Patsy's hands or the yarn in which she was working on or demonstrating. Otherwise, excellent video.",1421452800,,536,4.652631578947369

8366870,5,B002E6OB62,"This DVD is exactly what I needed. I researched, bought books, watched others spin, joined a spinning guild, found a used Saxony style wheel at a garage sale, but didn't know what I had or what to do with it. At the advice of someone, I sent the flier and bobbin off to a craftsman to have five more bobbins made. He said it could be up to six months turn-around, so I've been without something to learn on for four months.

I finally broke down and ordered a new traveling wheel so I can take a class and take it to guild meetings, and this DVD came with it in a beginner's kit. I am digesting it chapter by chapter and learning so much! My new wheel is a Castle style single drive and my bargain one is double drive. Now I know what that means and what to do with each of them. I keep going back and reviewing and appreciate how thorough it is.  I definitly recommend this for a beginner like me.",1330300800,6,898,4.096590909090909
