8274442,2,B0002C4JEE,"Dragon Blood is a great movie,however the dvd tranfer is digusting. It has Dutch subtitles that cannot be removed,full screen and very poor picture quality. The same applies to fighting fist of shanghai joe. I guess the 2 stars is for the dvd cover.",1104278400,,249,4.681818181818182
