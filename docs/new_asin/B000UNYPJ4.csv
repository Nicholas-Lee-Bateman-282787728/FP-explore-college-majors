8214011,4,B000UNYPJ4,"This DVD is full of some great matches, the only problem with it is in a few matches when they fight into the crowd you can barely see what is going on due to the place being so dark.",1260921600,,183,3.717948717948718
8214012,5,B000UNYPJ4,"On Saturday, October 29, 2005, the Majestic Theatre in Detroit, was home to an outstanding IWR professional wrestling card, which was a celebration of the Lucha Libre mat science.

With a classic, old-school promotional poster - the artwork is on the DVD cover - Revolucin Enmascarada Dos!: El Dia de los Muertos (The Day of the Dead), is the name of the event from this independent promotion which values quality matches from top performers.

The main event is the legendary Hijo Del Santo and L.A. Park within the confines of the steel cage. That bout alone is worth the price of the DVD, but there are five other matches and a battle royale - the Tag Team Riot -with live music provided by two bands.

The production quality is fantastic and the enthusiastic crowd is infectious. This is a must, not only for Lucha Libre fans, but for those who truly want to have in their DVD collection an impressive professional wrestling show.",1201564800,2,933,4.711656441717792
8214013,5,B000UNYPJ4,"I was very pleasantly suprised at the production quality of Revolucha: Dia de los Muertos.  I was even more suprised at the great turn out in Detroit for Lucha Libre.  Chock full of good American talent and tremendous Mexican superstars, the disk is put together very well.  The camera angles were great, and they even had some kind of crane to get overhead shots as well.

The mini's match at the beginning is great, and Blue Panther taking on an American is really good as well.  The cage match at the end is outstanding, featuring LA Park and the Mexican wrestling legend, El Hijo del Santo.  The cage match is outstanding, with a story told that is in keeping with the traditions of Mexican Lucha Libre.

I was unexpectedly pleased with this purchase and highly recommend this video.",1198800000,2,787,4.659420289855072
