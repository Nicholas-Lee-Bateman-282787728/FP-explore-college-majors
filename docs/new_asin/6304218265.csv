7865325,4,6304218265,"This tape features an 8 man tournament as well as the SuperFight between Ken Shamrock and Kimo. It is dubbed David vs. Goliath because of the huge difference in size between the competitors in the tournament. This features the first UFC appearance of both ""The Predator"" as well as ""Big Daddy.""

Quarterfinals: Don Frye vs. Thomas Ramirez- Frye makes short work of Ramirez in ten seconds, knocking him out.

Paul Varelans vs. Joe Moreira- This fight goes the distance and is a stand-up fight only. It does not go to the ground at all. Varelans wins all three judges' decisions because he was the aggressor throughout most of the fight. Moreira did get some solid hits in, but he was backing away while Varelans was moving forward.

Jerry Bohlander vs. Scott Ferrozzo- Very interesting fight here, Ferrozzo uses his size to his advantage with a lot of grappling, a couple of nice suplexes are landed and the fight goes to the ground. A lot of stalemates though as he gets Bohlander up against the fence. Bohlander comes up with the win with a tapout.

Paul Herrera vs. Gary Goodridge- Another short fight, Herrera shoots immediately but gets caught in a bad spot, and Goodridge nails him repeatedly with some nasty elbows and gets the KO.

Semi-Finals: Frye vs. Adkins*- *Varelans is replaced because of an injury and Adkins gets his spot in the tournament. Here we have a boxer vs. wrestler fight and we all know how these usually end up. Frye with an early takedown and starts throwing down punches, and Big John McCarthy stops it.

Bohlander vs. Goodridge- Nice ground fighting by both men until Goodridge nails two solid punches and McCarthy stops it.

The Superfight: Ken Shamrock vs. Kimo- This fight goes to the ground immediately. Kimo nails some solid punches but got caught in an ankle lock and taps out.

Final: Frye vs. Goodridge- Goodridge was looking good in the early portions of the fight, but made a mistake and Frye rolled him over and got control and gets a couple of short punches in. At first I thought Big John stopped it, then we see a towel thrown in the Octagon so I assume that was the reason. Either way a win for ""The Predator"" but a very nice showing by ""Big Daddy"" as well. Don Frye is the UFC 8 champion.",1123804800,3,2234,4.609571788413098
7865326,5,6304218265,"this is one of my all time favorite ufcs. the david vs goliath tournament idea was brilliant match making and the fights were all good apart from varelans borefest with moreira. goodridge and frye both have amazing superfast KO's in the first round and then TKO's in the second, they go to war in the finals. ken vs kimo was also great. nothing bad about this except for jeff blatnick making references to the chupacabra (see it to believe it).",1080432000,,444,4.5625
7865327,5,6304218265,"Watching a 400 pound Peurto Rican ""Island King"" get knocked out in seconds flat.  Seeing somebody get elbowed in the head numerous times and just go blank.  Some of the coolest sites of the UFC.  Not the greatest but definitely great.  One poor fight:  Polar bear and Brazillian, neither is agressive, it sucks.",1006646400,,311,4.7924528301886795
7865328,3,6304218265,"UFC 8, the David vs Goliath tournament was a good idea but fell short due to big names on the card and lack of skill of some of the competitors.
I won't give you a rundown on every detail, but I will highlight some of the pro's and cons of this tape, so you can best decide if you want it or not...
Pros:
- Good idea, big guys vs little guys. The big guy's don't always win. - Don ""The Predator"" Fry gives an impressive performance for a smaller guy. Great puncher. - Very good superfight between Kimo Lepoldo and Ken Shamrock for the Superfight championship.
Cons:
- Severe lack of skill/lack of effort/lack of action on the part of many of the big guys - Not enough big names on the card - Overall replay value of the fights very low. You won't be yearning to watch it again after seeing it once. The fights are generally mismatches but not in the way you would think it would go down.",996278400,5,887,4.162790697674419
7865329,4,6304218265,"UFC 8 is the second best UFC tournament I've seen so far.  The best UFC, in terms of entertainment quality, is Ultimate Fighting Championship, Vol. 6: Clash of the Titans.
UFC 8 features the debut of a new fighter, Don ""The Predator"" Frye.  Frye is the most viscious, enthusiastic, and friendly fighter I have ever seen.  As a judo master, a boxer, and a Greco-Roman wrestler, he truly represents what the martial arts is all about.  During a match, he will brutally strike his opponent until his opponent taps out.  After his opponent taps out, Don would, then, walk over to his opponent, shake his hand, hug him, and maybe say a word or two that will put a smile on his opponent's face.
Although UFC 8 features other fighters and fights, I believe the debut of ""The Predator"" should be the most memorable thing on this tape.  Even if you do not like any of the other fights, just the three fights that Don ""The Predator"" Frye participated in makes this tape something worthy to buy.
Buy the tape and consider my opinion for yourself.",991699200,2,1035,4.537634408602151
7865330,5,6304218265,This UFC Danid Vs Goliath is the best one out there to buy right now. See 150 pounders vs 400 pounders and sometimes the smaller guy KO's the big men wow is all you can say when you watch this great video.,989625600,,205,3.9047619047619047
7865331,4,6304218265,"The first UFC outside the continental US was the famous David vs Goliath tournament. At first I was a bit skeptical about this tournament. I assumed a bunch of fat beer-brawlers would compete against a decent field of  in-shape fighters. On paper I was somewhat right, I mean Paul Varelans,  Thomas Ramirez, and Scott Ferrozo all in one card! Still the tournament  proved the skeptics wrong. First off, some of these ""goliaths""  learned a little MMA 101, in other words: they were prepared. Paul Varelans  actually used his 350+ pounds to his advantage, his opponent could not take  him down nor had the striking ability to take him out. Thomas Ramirez was  as expected; he went out in about 10 seconds, while Scott Ferrozo failed as  well. The one  impressive ""Goliath"" Gary Goodridge, did so all  with his absolute power. And that's all he needed,(what is Kuk Sool Won?)  basically he was an arm-wrestling champion. But a ""David""  survived all, and in the end was the tournament champion.
The Superfight  saw an interesting, but obvious mismatch. Champ Ken Shamrock would battle  Kimo in a fight maybe catered to actually end. Still all the major fights  were very entertaining.",963792000,,1180,4.888888888888889
7865332,5,6304218265,"""The Predator"" Don Frye shows off his stuff trying  his best to prove to the world that it is skill over size any day.  There were many great fights and the Superfight was good as Kimo makes his return to the  Octagon.",949881600,3,218,4.142857142857143
