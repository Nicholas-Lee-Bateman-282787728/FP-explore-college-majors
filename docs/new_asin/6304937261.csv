939953,5,6304937261,The DVD is absolutely wonderful.  The interview with Otis' wife was great.  It gave a personal account of his life.  I also enjoyed the interview with Otis.  I don't think I've ever heard him talk!  Thank you for such a quality documentary of a very talented man.  This DVD is a must have.,1193529600,,289,4.3584905660377355
939954,5,6304937261,"This is the best video of Otis Redding available. It has his Monterey appearance as well as clips of his legendary European tour. Also great footage of Sam and Dave during the Paris concert. But much more important to me personally, it is absolutely essential for any Booker T and the MGs fan. The band is unbelievably tight and is the driving force behind all of the Stax vocalists. They steal the show. The best little band there ever was. Thoroughly satisfying.",1189036800,,464,4.670731707317073

939957,3,6304937261,"This Dvd has some historical value, but does not really

represent the Otis we know from Stax/Volt.  One inportant

element of the ""Stax Sound"" was their ""slow/layed back""

tempo's (even on their fast songs.  To paraphrase Dan Penn

""to fast a tempo is a cardinale sin"".  The super fast

tempo on most Otis Live Perforance seem over done to say the least. (How many ""gotta gotta"" can one stand.  The Booker T

and the MG's part was good as was Sam and Dave.  If you are

a real diehard Otis fan get this DVD.  To most Stax Music

lovers it will be a disappointment.",1150934400,4,565,4.3076923076923075
939958,5,6304937261,"I see why my people (parents/grandparents/aunts/uncles) had such a great time in the 60's.
I watched this concert and became happy for them as well as myself!
One for the library.",1060732800,3,179,4.806451612903226
939959,5,6304937261,"This is great stuff. A must for any Stax Records fan and highly recommended to any music fan as an introduction to the sounds that came from Soulsville U.S.A. in Memphis, TN, in the '60s. Redding's legendary Monterey Pop performance is here, looking and sounding better than ever. His version of ""Try a Little Tenderness"" here may be the best example of the power of the Stax sound. With Stax house band Booker T. & the MGs doing what they did best, building climax upon climax until the whole thing explodes, Redding blew away the West Coast audience in the rain at One in the Morning. The only disappointment on this dvd comes during this song. Instead of getting to watch the MGs and Otis knock the song out, we see Mama Cass and dozens of hippies relaxing and grazing in the grass. It's really frustrating at first, but one begins to appreciate the message in the song. Treat your woman right. And it shows why John Phillips (of the Mamas and Papas) once said that Otis could have been an ambassador of good will to the world. Also from Monterey Pop, we get an unbelievably moving and powerful version of Redding's and Jerry Butler's ""I've Been Loving You Too Long"".
 The dvd also includes footage from the now famous Stax tour of Europe in 1967. And this addition is what really makes this dvd such a great package. Not only does it have Otis doing his thing, but also ""When Something Is Wrong With My Baby"" and ""Hold On, I'm Coming!"" by Sam and Dave, and Booker T. & the MGs playing their first and biggest hit ""Green Onions"". One of the real thrills of this dvd is watching the late, great Al Jackson, Jr. of the MGs. Never will you see a more cool and in control drummer. Bassist Donald ""Duck"" Dunn, who is amazing throughout, and the brilliant guitarist Steve Cropper grew up watching Jackson and talk of how they would go in to see him play with Willie Mitchell's band in Memphis. They would become ""Mesmerized"" by him. And it is hard to take your eyes off him, he's beautiful to watch.
 So, that's it. You get taken to school by the tightest rhythm section ever, Booker T. & the MGs. You get taken to church by the superstar performance of Sam and Dave, and you get taken to heaven by the king of Soul himself, Otis Redding. The only let down is that, just like Redding's life and career, it's over far too early. But this fifty minutes of ecstasy must be seen and heard. It's the closest the world will ever again get to this level of greatness and showmanship.",1049414400,29,2473,4.421052631578948

IT PAYS HOMAGE TO THE GREATEST SOUL SINGER OF ALL TIME!!
IT FEATURES PERFORMANCES BY OTIS REDDING, SAM AND DAVE AND BOOKER T. AND THE MGS.
THESE WERE ALL GREAT MUSICIANS WHO ALL TOURED TOGETHER AND THIS IS A GREAT DVD!!! ENJOY!!!",1037404800,3,375,4.295774647887324
939961,3,6304937261,"This DVD seems to be the only film on Otis Redding ( I've heard that through the BBC there also should be a very detailed VHS available).
Unluckily not very much is said about his life and how he started in his music career which is imho relevant to his singing. The quality is ""ok"", too bad that they stuffed in Sam & Dave shows (wtf?) and that during ""Try a little tenderness"" you can't see him singing actually, only videocaps on people on the festival grounds.
Many songs and details about Otis are not shown and I am still looking for a more documentary style video about Otis. Still for any Soul afficionados this is a definite buy.",1006214400,2,638,4.369747899159663

7879472,1,6304937261,"I'm writing this on 2/5/09, a few weeks before the release. I just read about it in the current issue of Rolling Stone. I'm suspicious because I can't find anything on Shout's website, or on Amazon giving details on this DVD. The reason it matters is that Reelin' In the Years Productions, an excellent outfit, released Stax/Volt Revue in 2007 that took place in Oslo Norway in 1967 and, along with Otis, has Booker T and the MGs, Sam and Dave, and others. That release mentions nothing about D.A. Pennebaker. I didn't know D.A. Pennebaker was involved with Otis, other than the Monterey Pop documentary. The 1967 Oslo Norway concert was advertised as One Night Only. Rolling Stone magazine states that Pennebaker caught the soul giant in Oslo with Booker T and Sam and Dave. So, D.A. Pennebaker filmed the exact same concert that was already released in an excellent edition by Reelin' in the Years Productions? And that concert was shot by the NRK outfit in Oslo. I would wait to learn more about this release. Something is not right.",1233792000,20,1036,4.7292817679558015
