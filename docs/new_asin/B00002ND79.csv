1255488,4,B00002ND79,"Crystal is at his warmest and funniest and Winger her most endearing in this classic romance.  Irresistably drawn in by the roller coaster relationship between the rigid referee (Crystal) and the classy lady (Winger), you will love the round-the-table recounting of their story by their closest friends.  A very satisfying film we have watched and rewatched a dozen times or more, you will never forget ""Forget Paris"".",995846400,2,418,5.223880597014926

1255491,5,B00002ND79,"Hilarious romantic comedy with Crystal (one of my favourites) as a NBA ref who meets cute with Winger in Paris, and their assorted romantic travails. One of the great strengths here is the supporting cast: John Spencer,  Richard Masur, Julie Kavner, Joe Mantegna and Cynthia Stevenson. Priceless  moments: The entire pigeon sequence and the late, great William Hickey.",963878400,2,368,5.327586206896552
1255492,3,B00002ND79,"The romantic comedy is a very popular genre at the movies right now.  I suppose that it always has been.  In ""Forget Paris"" the emphasis is on the comedy, rather than the romance, and it provides a nice counterpart to some  of the others.
The story is structured in a fashion that will be familiar  to Woody Allen fans.  Three couples are sitting around at dinner telling  stories about their absent friends Mickey (Billy Crystal) and Ellen (Debra  Winger).
Mickey and Ellen first meet in Paris through a rather amazing  set of circumstances.  (I won't give it away.)  They fall in love, but  Mickey has to go back to work-he's an NBA referee-so he leaves.  He pines  for Ellen, though, and it starts to affect his work.  (There's a great  scene with him and Kareem Abdul Jabbar.)  Finally, Mickey returns to Paris  and they resume where they left off.
Eventually, they decide to get  married and Ellen quits her job and moves to California with Mickey.  That's when the problems begin.  Mickey is constantly on the road, so Ellen  gets lonely, plus she hates her new job.  Basically, she's  miserable.
Trying to make things work out between them, Mickey quits his  job and stays home with Ellen.  In the meantime, she has gotten a great job  that she loves so she's never home.  Now Mickey is miserable.
If you  suspect that somehow everything works out in the end, you've probably seen  this kind of movie before.  No matter.  A romantic comedy succeeds or  fails, not based on its originality or unpredictability, but on its charm,  humor and the charisma of its characters.  On that basis, ""Forget Paris""  succeeds.
Billy Crystal produced, directed and co-wrote the film, in  addition to starring in it, so it's his picture all the way.  With that  kind of pedigree, you know it's going to be funny, and it is.  Sometimes  hilariously so.
It also means that there will be moments when the story  or the characters will be sacrificed in order to serve the humor-and there  are.  There are too many scenes where Crystal cracks jokes and all Winger  is given to do is laugh at them.  That's too bad.  An actress of her talent  and intelligence should have a character that is more worthy of  her.
There will be natural comparisons between this film and ""When Harry  Met Sally...,"" which also starred Billy Crystal.  Although this picture is  not as good as that one, it is still enjoyable.",959212800,11,2390,4.6521739130434785

his war buddies in France and had to go through a lot of delays trying to find his father's casket which was held up in quarantine in Switzerland and then later on becoming romatically involved with Debra Winger as she accomandates the airline's mistakes on loosing Billy Crystal's deceased father. The movie also has a great cast of other great actors whom tells the story to their other friends about Billy Crystal and Debra Winger's love affair. Also if you are a NBA fan you will see real live NBA professional players in the movie. I loved this movie and found it to be utterly charming and heart breaking at times with the difficulties of going thru relationships which one of two can be rather selfish concerning their jobs. Debra Winger was already married when she met Billy Crystal's burial plans for his father, but, she was seperated from her husband and had to decide wheather or not to leave her husband for Billy Crystal whom was a very selfish person when it came to his job as a NBA referee.

Crystal plays an NBA referee. Yes, and he does a good job of it! In any case, his father dies and his father's wish was to be buried in France. So Crystal goes to Paris and, you might almost guess this, the airline loses the body. In his exasperating wait for them to find it, he meets Winger, an airline employee. A light-hearted romance follows. Ultimately, they get married and settle in Los Angeles, his home base. Then the normal marital difficulties seem to settle in to where they ultimately separate off and on, and ultimately come back together. It's a good story and well done. No big deal. The acting is good. The story has a good flow to it. It's funny off and on. It's touching here and there. I'd regard it as a good evening's entertainment, but nothing I'm going to remember for long.

It was interesting how this movie is told. There closest friends are telling the story. At first, i thought it would be annoying. But the director knew when to interupt the movie to go to the friends telling of the story.

SOMEWHAT REAL STRUGGLES
This movie was about the struggles about remaining yourself while being married. And how badly you want to be married.
The location issue is one issue that I think brings many couples apart. So I was happy to see how they addressed this problem in a movie.

BILLY CRYSTAL
Please don't throw tomatoes at me. He's not my favorite actor, especially because he plays the same person in every movie. He's always the sarcastic, goofy guy. But he's okay. Only thing that really annoys me is how he never seems to have a haircut in any of his movies. He has this 1 inch of frizzy fuzz hair. And he is always wearing the tightest jeans! And most of the time its not believable that these gorgeous ladies would be attracted to him at all.

DEBRA WINGER
She was ok. But she lacked the charm and charisma of Meg Ryan. I found her character a little flat. Which is not her fault. She did what she could.

THE REFEREE
It was annoying to have Billy Crystal be a referee. I don't like sports, so I didn't care for watching tidbits of his games or tall men hi-fiving each other sweatily.

PARIS
I watched this film hoping there'd be a lot of Paris scenes. But they weren't in Paris for very long. So don't get your hopes up if you're trying to watch a film mostly set in Paris.",1307491200,,1524,4.314685314685315

Billy Crystal is so self-absorbed that he can not get away from this genre, e.g., When Harry Met Sally, City Slickers.  The only thing missing from this horribly trite movie is the tall Midwestern blonde as Crystal's love object.  Rent The Heartbreak Kid (1972) starring Charles Grodin and Cybill Shepherd, to see a somewhat similar theme but better in every way, writing, directing, acting, character players.

For me, the only redeeming feature of this movie was the luminous Debra Winger.  Ms. Winger, many years after her brilliant performance in An Officer and a Gentleman is still a delight to watch.

(Liked it, didn't love it.) And, then, shortly after we started dating, saw part of it on TV together and realized how truly funny it was. A few years into our marriage we started a tradition that we watched ""Forget Paris"" together every year on our anniversary, and we still do (if not on, then near). It's become one of those classic films for us, where we can just say a line and crack each other up.

Billy Crystal is an unlikely romantic lead, but it works here. Joe Mantegna, Debra Winger, Julie Kavner (a.k.a. Marge Simpson), the late, great John Spencer and the always wonderful Cathy Moriarity (when is she not brilliant?) round out a truly awesome cast.

The story of a couple that meet, fall in love, break up, make up, and do it all over again (many more times)--all in very funny, yet real ways--never fails to delight. (And it's all told in flashback by friends waiting at a restaurant.)

I've given this film to several people as gifts (most haven't even heard of it) and they've all enjoyed it. It's very much in the vein of ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and other not-starring-teenagers fun, romantic films--though I actually think ""Forget Paris"" is more romantic and far funnier than ""Sleepless"" could ever hope to be. (And please don't confuse it with the dreadful, Meg Ryan flop, ""French Kiss."") I truly have no idea why this isn't a classic of its genre.

I found the film to be boring. Its quite long, full of unnecessary details, typical early 90s movie! It wasn't funny, wasn't even romantic. We didn't even get much of France or the French culture except in the begining. Even the name Forget Paris doesn't make sense because we don't get much of France.

Billy Crystal is great with the comedic repartee and Debra Winger is watchable in everything she does.

They meet under unusual circumstances - Mickey, the Billy Crystal character, is a referee who flies to Paris to bury his father.  When the casket turns up missing, Mickey spends hours in the airport, seeking the help of various customer service employees, trying to locate his father's body.  Then he meets Ellen (Debra Winger), who gives him the news that his father's body has been found - plus, the airlines is covering expenses, including his hotel, and bumping him up to first class for his return home.

Then somehow, the two click.  Ellen shows Mickey around Paris.  As they enjoy the sights, they begin a romantic love affair.

Inevitably, their week in Paris is at an end.

However, Winger seems lost playing against the stand-up shenanigans of Billy Crystal, and consequently they never really connect in any believable way.

Crystal plays Mickey Gordon, an NBA referee who tries to abide by his estranged father's wishes to be buried in France. The airline has unfortunately lost the casket, and their Paris-based customer relations executive Ellen Andrews tries to correct things for Mickey. Of course, they fall in love since it is Paris, and they get married almost immediately. Complications ensue with Mickey on the road and Ellen unable to conceive a baby. The central conceit of the film is its framing device, a dinner where a group of their friends congregate and share their remembrances of Mickey and Ellen's courtship and marital problems. How they are able to relay such intimate details is never really addressed since it's a plotting contrivance we are supposed to accept.

The other problem is that Crystal is not really acting here but performing his comedy routine as Mickey. Many of his lines sound overly familiar with many of the jokes having a forced feeling, and the role is virtually interchangeable with his Harry from the earlier film. Nevertheless, there are some truly funny bits, such as the running gag with Ellen's senile father (played by a befuddled William Hickey) repeating road signs in the car and the scene with the pigeon getting stuck to the side of Ellen's head. But it's not nearly enough. A solid supporting cast has been assembled as the friends - Joe Mantegna, Julie Kavner (particularly funny), Richard Masur, Cathy Moriarty, John Spencer, Cynthia Stevenson - though they act more like a chorus to the proceedings. The inevitable ending feels hollow since the relationship never felt that resonant.

Unfortunately, while there love endures, that Parisian spark doesn't survive the wedding.  Crystal's bachelor life proves harder to leave behind than he thought (Mickey has what amounts to Bill Crystal's dream job - as an utterly fearless NBA ref - but may have to sacrifice it;  He may also have to bear living with Winger's dementia-plagued father played by William Hickey).  She may have to bear the obvious unhappiness of causing Mickey to lose his dream job, not to mention his loutish friends, including Joe Mantegna as a sportswriter, and primetime TV vet John Spencer (""LA Law"", ""West Wing"") as a serial divorcee who derisively refers to his latest spouse as ""the new Mrs. Jack.""

Love Crystal's retort to a couple psychologist team,""When do you get involved, when there is gunplay!""
Overall, the story is pretty similar to When Harry Met Sally. In some ways its a little irrealsitic. Nonetheless, there are some comedic moments that will keep you amused.",1038700800,3,682,5.0265486725663715
