7996278,1,B0000A9GL6,"""Killer Buzz"" (also known as ""Flying Virus"") is a terrible Brazilian-US co-production about bees on a plane. The opening reveals the plot to be oil company versus environmentalists versus the ""Shadow People"" versus the pharmaceutical industry versus killer bees, all in a package wrapped tightly with a bow of government-industrial conspiracy. Among the killer bees there's a backstory about a messy divorce between Ann Bauer (Gabrielle Anwar) and her husband-hero Martin (Craig Sheffer) which in no way furthers the plot, but foreshadows their ultimate romantic reunion at the end of the movie. The dialogue is gravely poor (""You want to tell me why you're playing tonsil hockey with my comatose wife?"") as are the performances. Give the actors a break, though, they don't have a lot to work with.

The film has all the required characters necessary for a bad B-movie: annoying spoiled teenage girls, teenage computer geek who wants to date one of these girls but is instantly rebuffed, unexpected hero who is given control of a complex situation he knows nothing about, and an evil crazed lunatic played, of course, by Rutger Hauer. I have seen many Hauer movies, and despite their often poor quality, cannot imagine why he chose this role. On the plus side, the Brazilian location is lush and gorgeous. One other high note: the flight attendant helping stow the obligatory obnoxious guy's tray table. That's it for the reasons you might want to see the movie.

A money hungry executive takes a bunch of killer bees to New York on a plane with him. The turbulence knocks the bees loose on the 767, and an airborne struggle for survival begins. I have seen many aviation disaster movies, and you might expect me to be a difficult audience member given that I've been an airline pilot for twenty years, but this surpasses all but the worst aviation spectacles for sheer stupidity and terrible special effects. After the bees storm the plane the solution is to (you are so going to love this...) have Martin Bauer open one of the cabin doors, depressurizing the plane and sucking all the bees out. He accomplishes this and hangs on to a rope being pulled behind the plane flapping in the wind until the nerdy teenage boy pulls him back in and a flight attendant closes the door. I am not even going to dignify this with a professional response, but will say that from a cinematic perspective it is eye-rollingly poor.

Eventually the Captain gets stung, and while in his death throes and with Martin's help, he successfully lands the plane in a mountain range, and, least realistically of all, the plane comes through unscathed. I particularly liked the passengers ""brace for impact"" positions, which are not only completely unlike what the flight attendant just told them to do, but are as ludicrous as the positions adopted in the brilliant satire ""Airplane!"" decades ago.

As the movie closes with the 767 sitting in CGI splendor in the mountains of Brazil, the romance between Ann and Martin is magically rekindled, and bratty girl falls for teen geek. It's all enough to make you want to vomit.

My copy of ""Killer Buzz"" came with a disc problem that I presume is unique to my DVD. Between the 56-minute point and 1:20 into the film, the DVD skipped sometimes, so I would miss ten seconds of plot or so on occasion. My favorite instance of this was the skip that ended with Rutger Hauer bellowing ""The bees are allergic to me!"" This defect didn't substantially alter the viewing experience (actually it probably shortened the film by a minute or so, which was a not at all bad thing) but I thought it worthy of mention in case others suffered from a similar issue. I thought about getting another copy to watch it without the skips, but the lowest price I could find it for online was one cent, and that's still overpaying quite a bit.",1273017600,,3839,4.775602409638554

7996280,5,B0000A9GL6,"""KILLER BUZZ"" is a funny slasher of gore and action ! I recommend this movie for YOU !!!!! KILLER BUZZZZZZZZZZ ! she's here !!",1208476800,,126,4.291666666666667
7996281,1,B0000A9GL6,"This film must have cost a fortune to produce with pyrotechniques, dangerous stunts, lots of he-men going gung ho with fire bombs...sounds nice? It's not--many stunts, little plot, and the acting was very bad. There is this one scene this young woman is holding this fire extinguisher getting the bees saying ""take that...and that...and that"" it sounded and looked  sooo stupid and really corny.

But I felt the majority of the acting, along with poor script with little story line, is just as bad, throughout the movie.

Lots of Rambo he-man stunts, lots of bombs and fire; but that's about it. Ironically very little bees too! When the bees did appear, to me it looked very manufactured. Here's another example of a corny script: The plane is crashing. falling..falling toward earth. the piolet says ""no no no no no...pull it back pull it back..you got it. I got it. yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah...""  how thrilling...

I kid you not-I really felt ripped off because, I thought, this movie is packed full of stupid idiotic scenes that I felt very very depressed that I lost money on this lame movie, which I promptly placed where it should be--in the garbage can (really, I honestly put it in the trash so I don't have to be reminded about the money I lost). Too bad I couldn't get my money back...I thought this movie was MAJOR AWEFUL.

If you like corny rambo he-man stunts, and tough-man scenes, plenty of profanity (but to its credit no sex scenes) get the movie, but don't expect much in terms of bees and a story line; that was my honest impression.

If there was a NEGATIVE scale, that is, below ""zero"" I felt it would have earned that. But I do give it credit--no sex scenes.",1130716800,2,1680,4.58
7996282,3,B0000A9GL6,"KILLER BUZZ is a joint production between the US and Brazil, and one benefit of this is the beautiful Brazilian scenery.  Opulent rain forests, jagged peaks, and lots of greenery are feasts for the eyes.  What lies within, however, is a derivative, if somewhat entertaining, thriller about genetically enhanced bees.  The plot revolves around the US plans to build a road into the Brazilian countryside, 100 miles long, supposedly not to interfere with the rain forest.  However, with billions of dollars of oil at stake, the US is greedy enough to want to take the road 200 miles into the jungles, of course infiltrating the precious rain forest. Our heroine (the plucky Gabrielle Anwar) is a news journalist who along with her partner Raka, discover the secret....the bees are being used to wipe out the villagers and remove any blame from the government.  Of course, Anwar's somewhat romantic doctor (played by Dr. Pepper and American Werewolf's David Naughton) finds out about the bees after Anwar is attacked but miraculously saved, by what he thinks are the bees.  He hustles off one of the containers to New York and while on board, that's right, the bees get loose.
Also featured in the disjointed plot are Craig Sheffer, playing against type as Anwar's estranged husband; Adam Wylie, the geeky nerd from ""Daybreak"" who once again uses his computer knowledge to save the day; Rutger Hauer in a loopy performance as the designated hitman for the government; hunky Jason Brooks (Baywatch) as the Defense Department stud who wants to get into Anwar's pants; and Duncan Regehr as a mysterious white man who is living with the natives.
The effects of the plane and bees are second rate, but you can't help liking this movie, as it fills the need for our dislike of geneticized mutants and heroes who go beyond the norm to save the day.
Not one of the best, but it's passable.",1082246400,4,1878,4.834890965732087
