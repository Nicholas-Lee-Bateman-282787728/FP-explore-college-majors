6126780,5,B00H28A5FS,"For many years I've loved Ariadne auf Naxos, probably for the same reasons you may enjoy it: lovely music, drama, and a commentary on the rights of a composer, as to how his works are produced.

But I always wondered why Strauss chose this unusual format of a one-act opera, preceded by a prologue. Was he just imitating Richard Wagner's description of his Ring of the Nibelung tetralogy?

In this performance, Sven-Eric Bechtolf's staging has finally helped me understand the thinking behind an opera preceded by a prologue, and it's caused me to enjoy Ariadne more than ever before !

Similar to Richard Wagner's ""valentine"" to Cosima--the playing outside her bedroom of Wagner's ""Siegfried Idyll,"" Ariadne is Strauss and Hofmansthal's incredibly romantic wooing of Countess Ottonie.

Hugo von Hofmannsthal has become a character in Strauss' Ariadne, and he's trying to help Countess Ottonie overcome her grief at losing the only man she thinks she will ever love. To accomplish this, Hofmannsthal uses a rich benefactor (Monsieur Jourdain) to put on a play and an opera for Ottonie's enjoyment.

Soon, Ottonie begins to see the parallels between Ariadne's desire for death, and her on-going melancholy since she lost the only man she'd ever love.

Only rarely is there a scene as romantic as that between Ottonie and Hugo, as she says:

""Dear Herr von Hofmannsthal, you have taken great pains with Moliere...
...and with me.

Are we talking about literature, or about you and me?""

Hugo answers: ""And if one couldn't be separated from the other?""

It's just a deliciously-romantic moment which portends the beginning of a great love.

Regina Fritsch is superb in her acting of the role of Ottonie. She is carefully juxtaposed, reacting to everything Ariadne sings, and seeing herself in Ariadne's role. She's moved almost to tears at Ariadne's suffering. You can see her reaching out to Ariadne to show her empathy and understanding of suffering.

The singing and acting of all roles are wonderful.
Emily Magee personifies the despondent Ariadne, and her voice is powerful in all the arias that fans of Ariadne look forward to.

Jonas Kauffman will knock your socks off--he literally knocks a surprised Monsieur Jourdain out of his seat with the power of his ""Circe, Circe !""

Yes, as Zerbinetta, Elena Mosuc delivers the ever-anticipated tour de force for a soprano, dazzling all who hear her.

Her entourage of Harlequin and the others is equally entertaining and delightful.

I've always looked forward to the song the Muses (nymphs) sing about music (Tne tone, ssse Stimme!), and this original version has these lovely muses much more involved in the whole work. I'm glad there are more opportunities to hear their singing and watch their acting and their impact on the other characters.

Peter Matac, as the Major-Domo is so much fun that you'll remember his performance as adding more to the role than you've ever seen before.

Cornelius Obonya is a flouncing and loveable treasure as Monsieur Jourdain. You may find yourself watching HIM, during all the other action he is watching onstage.

So finally again, let me thank Sven-Eric Bechtolf for such a delightful and elucidating performance of the original version of Strauss' Ariadne.
Now, I finally ""get it,"" and I treasure this opera more than ever before!",1411171200,9,3320,5.0476190476190474
6126781,3,B00H28A5FS,"This one goes back to the original concept of the play, followed by the opera; a lot of different music and additional music. I have no way to comparethis with what was presented at the world premiere of this version in 1912, and the booklet indicates this is an updated version for the Salzburg Festival.  In any event, the play is much too long and the opera lacks the punch we get from the revised all musical approach to the prolog and opera.  This is interesting for what it is but probably would never be popular today.  Kaufmann is outstanding as expected but even his role seems to be less interesting in this version.  Magee is good and so is Mosuc but a lot of the additional music for Zerbinetta is really boring after a while, at least in my humble opinion.,  Recommended only if one really wants something at least approximating the ""complete"" history of this work.",1406419200,7,878,4.531645569620253
6126782,3,B00H28A5FS,"There are a number of reviews of this set on the UK site which contain what I consider at least misleading statements in their otherwise well made points.
I should have read the advance publicity for this set for it was not what I expected and I suspect that it will not be what most potential purchasers expect or want, despite its considerable strengths.

I am not in general a fan of opera on Blu-ray/DVD unless it is a production that attracts and is unavailable on cd. Thus the prospect of Kaufmann and Emily Magee in a work I love to distraction was a very attractive one, especially when the orchestra is the VPO.

As others have explained, the original 1911 version consisted of Hofmannsthal's freely adapted version of Molire's Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme presented as the full play with incidental music by Strauss somewhat based on Lully (though Strauss wrote in a letter ""I've got old Lully open in front of me but there is not much I can use"") followed by the opera of Ariadne auf Naxos in a version in which Mr. Jourdain, the butt of the satire makes spoken interjections.

It was not a critical success for perhaps obvious reasons, though as to an extent in Rosenkavalier, Strauss had developed Neo-Classicism 10 years or more before it became recognised as a genre attributed to Stravinsky!
Wisely for us all, Strauss and Hofmannsthal reworked the piece into the 1915 version we know and love so well. There has been a highly successful recording, now re-issued at mid-price of a semi-reconstruction of the original version conducted by Nagano with Margaret Price, Gosta Wimbergh and -Sumi Jo!
More of her anon.

This 2012 Salzburg Production devised by "" Regie Theater""  Director Sven-Eric Bechtolf is a hybrid-he has adapted the original play (and shortened it thankfully!) by introducing a ubiquitous device of it "" being in the mind"", in this case of a visible Hofmannsthal who for once is not a mad character but is explaining the plot to cheer up a grieving Countess whom he is trying to woo.

The setting is pleasant enough, it is all terribly clever-it just lacks all the music of the later Prologue!
The Composer is a moping long-haired male loon who wants kicking-off the stage for preference, and only Strauss's brief musical interjections sustain interest.

We lose the later Overture of course, and the music, such as it is, is familiar from the later expanded and recomposed suite "" Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme""-NOT to be called Der Burger Als Edelmann under Strauss's instructions.

The Opera fares better, and it is more or less the earlier version complete with Mr Jourdain and guests-and the composer, and the Countess, and Hofmannsthal, and the Major-Domo etc. making for a very crowded stage in the compact Mozart Haus!
The Vienna Philharmonic plays like angels-this was the last Salzburg Festival prior to retirement for veteran Principal Cellist Franz Bartolomey whom I was delighted to see in the pit alongside Rainer Kuchl.
 Daniel Harding conducts sympathetically-perky in the style of Bohm.

The stage set is composed of melting pianos in the style of Dali, and the costumes are attractive enough-it's a decent if chaotic stage picture.
Emily Magee is a fine Ariadne, fulsome of tone and very good indeed in the acting department.
She is not as good as Janowitz, Norman, Voigt or Price but I have no complaints.
The Comedia dell' Arte troupe is excellent as are the Naiads and Echo.
Jonas Kaufmann enters dressed as a cross between Peter Pan and The Riddler from Batman, and is a very virile Bacchus indeed. His voice has become beefier and in saying less innately beautiful that is not a criticism-it is what happens to tenors as they take on more heroic and more taxing roles.
The longer duet with Ariadne holds no fears for him and he soars through it with firm upper notes-but yes, there is a hint of strain towards the end! He is human.

I have left comment about the Zerbinetta of Romanian Elena Mosuc to this point. It is perhaps unkind to advise that her costume does her no favours, but it is the voice that matters.
Back to Sumi Jo. No-one has so far commented on the fact that in the first version, Strauss set Zerbinetta's big numbers (there are 2 in this version) an OCTAVE HIGHER than in the revised version of ""Grossmachtige Prinzessin"" which he revised for the second version.
Sumi Jo sings it with dazzling ease at the higher pitch on the Nagano recording.

Mosuc sings it an octave lower, but I am astonished as to why no reviewers have commented on how poor her top notes are-and there are a lot more of them in the earlier version!!
Her voice spreads alarmingly near the top of the stave, undoing for me all the good characterisation she achieves otherwise. This role if any needs to be sung with technical brilliance-Gruberova, Battle, Geszty and Sumi Jo show us how, and Dessay shows us a more powerful ""Marlene Dietrich"" version-all brilliantly sung. Mosuc is sadly deficient.
I find the interventions of Jourdain into big numbers irritating, and the stage picture, though not offensive, is not compelling either!
So, just be careful before you order. If you want a filmed Ariadne of the 1915 Version I suggest the Bohm in the venerable Fillipo Sanjust Vienna Production with Janowitz, Gruberova and Kollo.
If you are curious about the original version, the Nagano CD version is where to start.

I had hoped that this Blu-ray would provide a sufficiently musical experience for me to want to return to it on that basis, but it doesn't especially as the operatic Prologue is missing.
The opera itself has enough drawbacks despite its many strengths also to rule it out of contention.
It's pretty enough visually with nothing to make the hackles rise, but overall a disappointment.
Sound quality is excellent as is picture on my copy
I'm not suggesting that there is no enjoyment to be had, but there should be more, so be careful which version you choose!! 3 Stars. Stewart Crowe.",1406246400,20,5938,4.792766373411535
6126783,4,B00H28A5FS,"This is the first version of Ariadne with the intro of the Bourgeois Gentilhomme instead of the later sung prologue. And the actual opera is also different mainly with passages which were later dropped from the revised version. My initial reason for buying the disc was the presence of Jonas Kaufmann. Usually with Ariadne the anti-climax is the arrival of Bacchus who is something of a disappointment. Not so here. Kaufmann easily earns his salary. The performance is quite good. All the singers are first rate. But the problem is that introductory play. It takes up 1:30 of a 3 hour evening and there is very little incidental music for the play.
I would give the performance 5 stars solely for the singing and the chance to hear the original Ariadne. For one thing Zerbinetta has a much longer scene as well as another aria. But in the future I'm afraid I will skip the play and perhaps play the prologue from another set. It is the play that brings my rating down to 4 stars.

8629209,5,B00H28A5FS,"One of the reasons the first version of ARIADNE AUF NAXOS (1912) failed was that people who came to see an opera were impatient and resentful at having to sit first through a play, librettist Hugo von Hofmannsthal's adaptation of Molire's LE BOURGEOIS GENTILHOMME. Even before the 1916 revision, which is the version we commonly hear with the through-composed Prologue replacing the play, cuts were quickly introduced as this curious hybrid made the European rounds. The earliest performances of play-plus-opera including intervals were said to run more than six hours.

For the work's centenary production at the 2012 Salzburg Festival, director Sven-Eric Bechtolf has attempted a meta-update that is not quite ""the original ARIADNE"" but honors its creators' impulses, and at 90 minutes, his own adaptation of Molire-via-HvH is considerably shorter than what any audience in 1912-13 would have seen. Nevertheless, some reactions of those who saw this at Salzburg, watched the streaming broadcast, or purchased the DVD suggest that the objections of 1912 have not gone away. Many who came for the opera are *still* impatient and resentful at having to sit through a play. I knew what I was getting (more or less), and actually was more interested in it *for* that. We already have many good recordings and DVDs available of vin ordinaire 1916 ARIADNE AUF NAXOS. While another one with the present cast augmented by some distinguished mezzo or soprano Composer would have been welcome, why not do something special for an important anniversary?

Whether the 1916 revision is ""better"" or ""worse,"" it was certainly a wise move, because if all that existed were the 1912, we would very rarely see this opera. It would be quite a curio, and it would make the demand of an entire second cast of actors, so it would be at best a festival undertaking, as here. The VPO plays wisps of incidental music for the 90 minutes of Bechtolf/Hofmannsthal/Molire spoken material. Bechtolf frames everything by putting Hugo von Hofmannsthal himself in the ""play"" portion of the evening. HvH is wooing the melancholy widow Countess Ottonie, who remains devoted to her husband years after his passing. He tells her of a project he has in mind, which begins to appear on the stage around these two. HvH himself assumes the roles of the Music Master and later a rakish Count who is exploiting the nouveau riche buffoon Jourdain (the rich host talked about but never seen in the 1916 ARIADNE). This Count is pursuing a Marchioness, Dorimne, whom the married Jourdain also covets. Ottonie is then induced by Hofmannsthal to enter into his Molire adaptation as Dorimne. Toward the end of all this, Bechtolf orients us by telescoping in some of the action of the familiar Prologue (it was Dorimne's suggestion that Jourdain's evening entertainment include fireworks, which led to Jourdain's capricious request that the opera seria and opera buffa be performed simultaneously). In a dressing room scene, we also get cameos I will not spoil by other Strauss/Hofmannsthal opera characters, and Jonas Kaufmann in curlers, amusingly impersonating a stupid divo who communicates in Italian swearing and broken English (""I go airport!"").

The opera begins. We are still in Jourdain's house (although since we began with Hofmannsthal and Ottonie, we're really...wherever they were). The BOURGEOIS GENTILHOMME '12 characters are watching the opera and occasionally venturing into the staging area. The ""caves"" are (cleverly) the ruins of smashed pianos, and there is some sand suggesting a beach. Then we settle in for a remarkable performance of the ARIADNE ""Opera,"" in the form it held before the tightening-up Strauss and Hofmannsthal gave it for the revision. ""Gromchtige Prinzessin"" is longer, brutally difficult, and the role of Zerbinetta is fuller and more elaborate overall (of course, she had not had the duet with the Composer in the Prologue, because here he is a spoken role, acted by a man). There are other differences.

I have never heard a better Bacchus than Jonas Kaufmann, and I am tempted to leave it that. His sound is virile and glamorous, and he treats the language lovingly. It is a punishing role that can seem thankless, the sort where you applaud someone for getting through it so we can have the rest of the opera, even if the quality of the tone gives little pleasure. Kaufmann gets through it *and* gives great pleasure. Emily Magee, the Ariadne, has a funnel-shaped voice, tight and dusky at the bottom, opening out the higher up you go into a huge, effulgent top that is made for this music. Elena Mouc is a bigger-voiced Zerbinetta than the usual, not as bright and focused as Dessay or Gruberova on other DVDs, but she is fluent and fearless. One wants not only to applaud the performance on the DVD but the mere thought that she sang this version of the aria seven times *live* over a couple weeks, and also managed to characterize Zerbinetta within a busy and demanding staging of the scene. It is a piece most coloraturas would think long and hard before even attempting live once in a stand-and-deliver recital. Commedia dell'arte troupe, nymphs, et cetera...all at the very highest level. Maestro Daniel Harding (leading the VPO with delicacy) even gets to act a little.

I will not soft-pedal that this ARIADNE AUF NAXOS is a bit exhausting. It seemed longer than its three hours and 15 minutes, but by that I do not mean it is bad or boring. It is just that we go from one theatrical world to another, and although the two are linked together with some ingenuity (by the work's creators and by Bechtolf and the cast), it still feels like two heavy meals served close together. The 1912 version of the Opera is as long as ELEKTRA, and ELEKTRA does not begin after a substantial play. I am very glad to have seen it all, though, and the actors in the play portion are excellent: Peter Mati's drily humorous Major-Domo; Cornelius Obonya overplaying appropriately as the hapless M. Jourdain; Stefanie Dvorak as his wife, who seems unsympathetic but turns out actually to be much smarter; Michael Rotschopf's suave and witty Hofmannsthal, and above all the Sterija Award winner Regina Fritsch, expertly differentiating the circumspect Ottonie from the merry Dorimne via vocal color, body language, expression. Fritsch's Ottonie becomes a mirror character for Ariadne, struggling to begin again, to live again. She and Magee are dressed similarly and are only a few feet apart in the Opera, and Fritsch's accomplished and deeply touching stage acting set beside Magee's broader ""opera seria acting"" is not cruel to Magee. They seem like two sides of the same coin, two women who have arrived at a similar situation through different planes of existence. It was in these moments that I felt I had been given a deeper understanding of any version of ARIADNE AUF NAXOS, and I was grateful for the whole undertaking.

A brave and beautiful recreation/rethinking of a challenging work, recommended as an adjunct to a good DVD or recording of the 1916 version, and for any fan of one or more of the three principal singers.",1423526400,6,7116,4.970612930310663
8629210,5,B00H28A5FS,"Few have sung the impossible role of Bacchus with confidence, facility and beautiful tone. The first was Helge Roswaenge, more recently Goesta Winbergh and now Jonas Kaufmann, perhaps the best of the three. He seems completely comfortable with the daunting range and dramatic intensity of this part. It's really dream casting and a knockout performance that makes this disc a must-have. You will also appreciate why this chattier 1912 version of the opera is rarely produced. The very long first act hasn't much singing though lots of amusing philosophizing about the dependence of artistic genius on bourgeois patronage. It recalls the later work, Capriccio, which examines the relative importance of music, poetry, actors, singers and stage directors. Here it's a chorus line of prima donnas representing opera composers, stage directors, choreographers and a dramatically inclined patron whose love of fireworks nearly compromises the integrity of the final opera. Along the way, there is broad comedy and exquisite ballet from the cheeky servants. I do think this opera works better when the Ariadne piece is played straight and allowed to take over, erasing all memory of what has come before, underscoring Strauss' belief that art transcends the ridiculous circumstances of its birth. Here the singing is sublime, though the production remains earthbound, with the audience locked into a painful awareness of the realistic surroundings and the banal presence of a host who faces us unashamed of his boredom and frustration. I just found it distracting. But that's a minor failing in a great show, including magnificent singing by Emily Magee and Elena Mosuc and all the operatic commedia dell' arte company. The production is striking, with lovely sets and costumes; and you're not likely to see better in your lifetime. Someone really needs to mass produce Kaufmann's panther pj's, which have to be the coolest costume ever worn by a tenor. He's a singer in his prime and we are lucky he viewed this role not as a thankless bit part but as the fireworks display Strauss intended.",1421020800,5,2086,5.192878338278931
8629211,4,B00H28A5FS,I had no knowledge of the Opera so had no expectations for it.  I was drawn to it because of Jonas Kaufmann.  I've never been disappointed in any of his performances and wasn't with this one. I did do some research about the story and that was a help in understanding what it was portraying. Therefore I do recommend it on that basis.  For me it is a 4 Star.,1418688000,,358,4.085714285714285
