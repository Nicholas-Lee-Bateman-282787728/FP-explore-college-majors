5012955,4,B006PTL1QM,"Putting aside some minor historical and biographical inaccuracies, ""A Dangerous Method"" is a marvelous film, with a bravura performance by Keira Knightly. The focus of the film is the relationship between two of the great founders of modern psychological theory, Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung.

Freud (1856-1939) was an Austrian Jew who developed the Psychoanalytic method as a result of his work in neurology and his experiments with Mesmerism (hypnosis). He published the first of many books in 1899 and this attracted the attention of dozens of intellectuals, including Carl Jung (1875-1961), a Swiss Psychiatrist.

Jung approached Freud in 1906 and their relationship lasted for approximately 7 years.

When they met, Freud was 50 and Jung was 31. Freud was a Jew and Jung was a Swiss Reformed Evangelical. Freud was 5'7"", Jung was 6'1"". Jung's experience was largely based in institutions and Freud was primarily a private physician. Freud lived comfortably but was never well off. Jung had been poor as a child but married one of the wealthiest women in Switzerland. Freud was known for being faithful to his wife and Jung was well known for his affairs, one of which is the focus of the film.

Keira Knightly plays Sabrina Spielrein (1885-1942), a former patient of Jung with whom he had an affair. Knightgly is the Natalie Portman look-alike who played the decoy Queen in Star Wars (1999). From this humble beginning she went on to earn an Oscar and a Golden Globe nomination for ""Pride and Prejudice"" (2005) and has been in such box office hits as the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise and ""King Arthur"" (2004). As the conflicted and vulnerable Russian Jewess, this is by far her best performance and one of the best performances by anyone.

Viggo Mortensen plays the cigar smoking Freud (who ultimately developed cancer of the jaw). Mortensen is best known for his ""Lord of the Rings"" films as well as some stunning work in films like his Oscar nominated role in ""Eastern Promises"" (2007) and ""A History of Violence"" (2005). His work in this film earned him a Golden Globe nomination. He is marvelously understated.

Michael Fassbender plays Jung. Fassbender is best known for his work in ""Inglorious Bastards"" (2009) and his Golden Globe nominated ""Shame"" (2011). He does a good job acting, but he lacks the stature of Jung who towered over (at 6'1"") his contempories.

David Cronenberg directs. Cronenberg is known as the ""Baron of Blood"" for films such as ""Scanners"" (1981), ""Videodrone"" (1983), ""The Dead Zone"" (1983) and ""The Fly"" (1986). He worked with Mortensen on ""A History of Violence"" (2005) and ""Eastern Promises"" (2007).

The beautiful on location photography is courtesy of Peter Suschitzky who is a long time collaborator with Cronenberg and who also has to his credit films as diverse as ""Valentino"" (1977), ""Mars Attack"" and ""The Man in the Iron Mask"". The excellent musical score is from Howard Shore whose most familiar work is ""Lord of the Rings"" for which he won 2 Oscars and 3 ASCAPs. and who also gave us memorable work in ""Big"", ""Silence of the Lambs"", ""Philadelphia"", and ""Se7en"".

It's hard to make a compelling movie about such an academic topic as the differences in emphasis between Freud and Jung, and there a few good films about the history of psychology. Montgomery Clift's ""Freud"" (1962) and the Australian film ""Between the Wars"" (1974) are examples that this can be achieved, and here we have another fine example.

There are some problems with the film. The influence of World War 1 on Freud's death theory is ignored as is Jung's unflattering complicity with the Nazis. The use of Otto Gross as the only other analyst in the film makes one think that early Psychoanalysis was permeated with sexual perverts, when in fact there were many people involved who were there for the intellectual and humanitarian purposes.

Another problem with the film is that the enormity of Freud's message is not really portrayed adequately. In 1900, the idea that our behavior was controlled by unconscious impulses was revolutionary, and as much of a problem for Freud as his sexual theory, yet the two were intertwined. The film's focus on the sexual theory doesn't do justice to the complexity of Freud's theory nor to how controversial it was.

The film also underplays the importance that Jung's role as a non-Jew had to the ""movement"" and how much anti-semitism was at play for a theory that seemed to be rooted in intellectual Jewish culture.

Critics were divided in assessing the film. Roger Ebert called the film ""absorbing"" and said Mortensten's performance was ""masterful"". The Hollywood Reporter called it ""precise, lucid and thrillingly disciplined"", but Rene Rodrigues of the Miami Herald called the film ""crushingly dull"".

The film was released in late November and earned nearly $4 million in the first month, which placed it 165 for all films released in the previous year. It had an estimated budget in excess of $20 million.

Bottom line - fans of biographies and anyone with an interest in Psychoanalysis will find this film very entertaining and informative, but for the ordinary film goer it may be too much talking and not enough action.",1327363200,231,5193,4.966589861751152
5012956,4,B006PTL1QM,"This film is not in Cronenberg's most common style but it is well done. It is nicely quaint and that is definitely the British touch in it, quaint to the point of nostalgia, mind you before the Fist World War in Austria and in Switzerland.

But The film is divided between the sentimental conflict and impulses, that are also sexual, and the more serious subjects of the relation between Jews and Aryans in the German speaking Europe of the time on one hand and the theoretical and practical debate between Freud and Jung on the other hand. That gives to the film a strange equilibrium that definitely makes the sexual and sentimental side purely animalistic and the theoretical part a purely boring discussion between essentially males locked up in their impulses, repressions and other axioms.

The sentimental side is simple. Carl Jung had liaisons, a little bit more than affairs with his own patients and played on the term by refusing their fees when he started the liaison or affair. At the same time he keeps a rather serene relation with his own wife who is extremely well-off. That sounds sordid and that is anyway a case of abuse of power from a person in an authority position to a person in a medically dependent position. That is unacceptable from any point of view. That side of the film is off-limits.

The second question, that of the relations between Jews and Aryans before 1914 in German speaking countries is only expressed by Freud and is a total rejection of some compromise with the Aryans and an advice to the young student Jung had a liaison with to remember that Jews are not supposed to mix with Aryans and are supposed to keep together. This cast a bright light on the reasons of the ending of the relation of Jung and Freud, though it is true in a way Freud was too intellectually powerful for Jung to remain under his influence too long. The question at stake here is the fact that Jung considers that Freud brings too much sexuality in psychoanalysis.

The third question is the continuation of the previous one. The debate between Freud and Jung before 1914. Can the whole psychology of a human being be reduced to his libido, hence to his sexual instinct or impulse? Jung starts thinking then that many other elements interfere with the psychology of an individual that come from the social and cultural field, both being time-sensitive and hence inherited from the past, from history, and hence the reflection of this history, including ancient history. Jung will go very far in that direction after WW1. A side issue is brought into the picture by Sabina Spielrein, the student and patient Jung had a liaison with. She seems to tend to think that a love relation, a sexual relation leads to the destruction of both egos in order to be able to produce a new one. This is by far the reduction of the sexual and sentimental impulse, the libido, to only one objective: procreation. This is dangerous.

The point is that Wilhelm Reich is missing in that picture who will defend the idea that the libido aims mainly at getting pleasure and that procreation is only kind of a side effect, which it has become nowadays due to contraceptives and other birth control means.

That reduces the debate to the arguments that will triumph in Scientology: the only basic and central aim of all life is the survival instinct, at the level of the individual, intercourse, the immediate group and the species. If sexuality has only one aim, procreation, if pleasure can only be taken into account outside procreation, hence outside a marital relation, if the only aim of the individual is to survive in a way or another, humanity is reduced to a herd of animals that have to be manipulated and brainwashed by the few powerful ones who will dominate by self appointment due to their force, no matter what.

I thus regret this film does not step over 14-18 and does not envisage the later period of the 1920s and the 1930s, when things became quite different and a lot more interesting.

5012957,5,B006PTL1QM,"This is really a story of Victorian restraints versus early 20th century liberationist impulses and tendencies (or of ego versus id). Viggo Mortensen plays Freud as a man who is brave enough to suggest that sex is the key to unlocking virtually every human secret but who is so thoroughly ensconced in Victorian respectablity that he is uncertain what to do with this discovery. Initially, he places his hopes in Jung but, as Michael Fassbender plays him, Jung is too confused by his own personal truths and desires to see a clear way forward. Neither men seem to understand psychoanalysis as Sabina (Keira Knightly) understands it: as a personally and politically liberating art & science. Cronenberg's film (based on a book and stage play) suggests that we still haven't resolved the age-old dispute between Freud's patriarchal rationalism that preserves the social order and a more anti-patriarchal & anti-authoritarian version of psychoanalysis that transforms the social order. Keira Knightly's character seems to be the one nearest realizing some form of compromise between or some sort of synthesis of these two competing branches of the art/science but alas the film ends and we never learn what that way forward might have been. One thing is certain: this is my idea of cinema, a cinema of ideas.",1327104000,85,1305,5.102803738317757
5012958,4,B006PTL1QM,"I have to admit: David Cronenberg (imdb.com/name/nm0000343) is one of my favorite film directors, and is considered to be a film 'auteur' director, or, in plain English, a truly unique film director - one whom no other film director has ever rivaled. While he is best known for his somewhat more dubious films including&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Naked-Lunch/dp/B0000CDUT5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Naked Lunch</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crash/dp/6305161968/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crash</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-History-of-Violence/dp/B001JNNE1O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A History of Violence</a>, David Cronenberg's 'A Dangerous Method', is one of my personal favorites for Psychology, turning this quite complicated subject into an easy-to-understand cinematic masterpiece.

I wish I could give this film a 5/5 star rating as it promises a lot of potential. However, the character of Sigmund Freud is unquestionably flat in some places, as is that of Jung, though he is seen much more closely. And the reader all but can't help sympathizing with Spielrein even though her delight in masochistic sexuality is frightening. It is a film that I highly recommend - seeing once, or maybe twice. But it is, as with other Cronenberg films, a true work of art, and you will not easily forget this film.

-- Spoiler Follows: --

The film is seen through the eyes of Carl Jung, a friend of Sigmund Freud. Jung is a doctor at an asylum and is in charge of Sabine Spielrein, a woman with a mental disorder stemming from her abusive father when she was a child. The film wanders towards her recovery - Jung going so far as to give her some of what she wants (torture mingled with sex) as a way to cure her mental problems. Freud and Jung have several heated debates on how best to cure mental problems throughout the film.",1325289600,,1973,5.91578947368421
5012959,4,B006PTL1QM,"Based on a true story and highly influenced by the 2002 discovery of letters and diary of Sabina Spielrein.

Keira Knightley shines magnificently as Sabina Spielrein, a spastic, neurotic, but highly intelligent patient of the young Swiss doctor Carl Jung (methodically played by Michael Fassbender). While she is neurotic her intellect still reasons. In an early scene Sabina is in a pond as the men in white coats try to persuade her out.

The clinic director approaches her and says ""You clearly have too much time on your hands. We must find something for you to do. What are your interests?""

Sabina, ""Suicide and interplanetary travel.""  In this simple scene we can grasp her intellect and her issues.

Jung allows Sabina, (who wants to be a doctor) to act as his assistant, a task she does a little too well as demonstrated with her diagnosis of patients using word associtaion. Sabina has been abused by her father. Now it gets weird. He would slap her, then make her kiss his hand afterwards. He would also spank her bare bottom, something Keira confesses caused arousal, even at an early age. She would do things which would cause her to be spanked.

In one scene Sabina is on a moving river boat talking to Dr. Jung, however the scenery behind her never changes. It looks as it the background is superimposed. The background also appears fake when you see the statue of liberty.

Carl Jung decides to consult some guy named Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortensen) about this case. Mortensen plays Freud somewhat stiff, for a guy who relates everything to sex.  When cocaine snorting, womanizer patient (Vincent Cassel as Otto Gross) shows up at the clinic, his unethical ways cause Jung to question his life and his relationship with Knightly who now desires sex and a good spanking.

Freud is always pictured with a cigar in his hand or mouth(sometimes a cigar is just a cigar), but his other idiosyncrasies are not captured. Note the German custom of wearing the wedding ring on the right hand. He is involved in a lot of dialouge scenes about sex, repression, ego, and dream interpretation. What should be a five star movie from the cast, lacks action in the script and good drama in the dialouge, but does have an historical interest. Worth while rental.

f-bomb, sex, spanking, and nudity (Sarah Marecek, Keira Knightley)",1324166400,3,2328,4.81203007518797
5012960,4,B006PTL1QM,"Does anybody out there actually dislike David Cronenberg? It's just bizarre to think that fans of any sort of film genre could hate, dislike, or not care for anything in Cronenberg's genre-spanning repertoire. He's a pretty versatile director and dabbles in a little bit of everything while leaving his fingerprints and trademarks all over everything he's a part of. Videodrome, The Fly, Dead Ringers, Naked Lunch, and Spider are a few personal favorites. With that said, A Dangerous Method more than likely won't be considered one of his best but is still a very solid effort overall.

The entire film feels like an acting vehicle with Keira Knightley firmly in control of the driver's seat. Viggo Mortensen isn't really around much at all and his performance is the most forgetful of the three leads. His performance is still fairly engaging, but it pales in comparison to his co-stars and even his performance in his last film with Cronenberg Eastern Promises. Michael Fassbender does let his talent slip through his rather wooden-feeling performance at times. Carl Jung (Fassbender) and Sigmund Freud (Mortensen) are the two main scientific minds of the film and being know-it-all, emotionless drones is practically expected and kind of natural to think of when a scientist comes to mind. Fassbender at least shows signs of emotion and it's almost as if you can see the wheels turning in his head before he speaks at times, but Keira Knightley steals the show. Her facial expressions, body language, and hand gestures are just phenomenal and almost inhuman. I've never seen someone's teeth used to be so expressive before and her Russian accent isn't too shabby either. It'd be kind of a tragedy if Knightley isn't at least nominated for an Oscar after this.

The film becomes notorious for the repetitive way certain scenes are shot. Two characters would be in frame, one in the background and one in the foreground (usually a close-up), and it would only last for a few lines of dialogue. It was a simple idea yet was visually intriguing and the technique usually made the shot more memorable because of it. There's also a scene near the end of the film with a discussion between Carl Jung and Sabina Spielrein (Knightley) sitting by the lake. It's mostly absent of background music other than some piano that creeps in later on in the scene, but hearing the sounds of the lake during their conversation made it a little more spectacular.

A Dangerous Method is set during World War I and is about how Freud and Jung developed psychoanalysis at its core, but is driven by the masochistic affair that develops between Carl Jung and Sabina Spielrein. Their intimate scenes are usually fairly disturbing and incredibly emotional. They're practically the heart and soul of the film. There are also a handful of one-liners that are sure to stick with you long after the journey ends. (""Little do they know we're bringing them the plague."")

A Dangerous Method is a little unnerving at times, but is very tame in comparison to nearly everything else Cronenberg has done. Keira Knightley is absolutely outstanding. A Dangerous Method is a well-written and intelligent drama that is powerful and superbly acted with just the right amount of discomforting material to keep you fascinated until those final credits roll.",1321228800,15,3316,4.969369369369369

It was as if there were great struggles on the editors' part as to what to leave in and what to omit. It does capture the essence of the split between Jung & Freud. It also clearly conveys the ""mans' world"" of that era which makes the presence of Ms. Spielrein all the more remarkable. It also conveys Jung's willingness to be vulnerable in his turmoil---and Freud's need to be the superior one in their relationship. That struggle was clearly conveyed. The imagery was lush and beautiful. Also the sensitive and intuitive nature of Emma Jung was made clear. This is a complex topic made in present day with poetic license no doubt.

I would expect people who distance themselves from feeling their emotions by immersing themselves in the 'why' and 'how' of the the emotions (the clockwork running the machine rather than the machine itself) would have reserved personalities - but that is on the outside, and a good movie is supposed to actually show us the layers within a character, not just have the character lay it all out via discussion. Much of the characters' true selves were revealed either through discussion (not unexpected, since it was a movie about how 'talk therapy' developed as a treatment) or through obvious plot devices. The transition between scenes was often abrupt, as well, which seemed to make the movie seem rushed and rather lacking in depth, despite some of the intriguing dialogue. I felt it was a good concept, but that the plot writing needed to be more developed with more subtle cues from the characters as to what they're really feeling.

The relationship between Spieilrein and Jung is highly fictionalized with a ridiculous twist of S & M.  There was actually never any evidence of that element in their relationship although there did seem to be a possible relationship addiction with Spielrein and she seemed to think of destruction of the self as a means toward reproduction. She did a great deal of therapeutic work. Jung would, rightfully so, have his license taken today for being in a relationship with a patient...no matter how brilliant or gifted. The acting is very good although Knightley went a bit overboardand I found her less believable than Mortensen and Fassbender (who stole the picture in my opinion as a deeply conflicted but brilliant man). Like so many others Spielrein was a casualty of the horrible Anti-Semitism of WWII. She was shot with 27,00 other people in the early forties.

5012982,3,B006PTL1QM,"Weird. Is synchronicity real? I just posted a review of Richard Noll's cult classic The Jung Cult (or, as evil tongues call it, Vlkische Jung-Mdel), and look what Swedish TV aired literally the same evening: A Dangerous Method, freely based on the true story of Carl Gustav Jung's collaboration and conflict with Sigmund Freud. The only thing lacking now is a mysterious dung beetle (or Egyptian god with kingfisher wings) flying into my flat through the open window!

A Dangerous Method doesn't shy away from the more juicy (some would say Freudian) aspects of Jung's early career. The Swiss psychoanalyst's entanglement with the beautiful, intelligent and crazy Sabina Spielrein forms the centerpiece of the story. Yes, Dr Jung (who was married) had an erotic relationship with her. The film also features Jung's fateful encounter with anarchist Otto Gross, who was one of his patients (!) but had a demonical influence on the man who was supposed to cure him.

I can't say A Dangerous Method is *that* interesting, unless you have an Oedipal crush on psycho-analysis, and the plot is probably incomprehensible to anyone who hasn't read extensively on the subject. Still, it did give me new respect for Viggo Mortensen as an actor  like most people, I remember him as Aragorn in LOTR. Here, he starsFreud!

I'm not sure if it's another aspect of Jungian or Vlkisch synchronicity, or just a sheer co-incidence, but another TV network was showing Twin Peaks reruns at the same time as A Dangerous Method was aired.

Apparently, Jungian analytical psychologists prohibited their patients-clients from reading Noll's fratricidal attack on the Jung cult. I can only hope that they can at least watch A Dangerous Method. If not, I suppose there is always Twin Peaks",1479427200,,1761,5.037800687285223

Just an absolutely great movie for those interested in the depths of the human psyche!!! These line towards the end sums up Jungs experience with his first mistress Sabina Speilrein, Only the wounded physician can help to heal. . . My love for you was the most important thing in my life, for better or worse, it made me understand who I am. . . Sometimes you have to do something unforgivable just to go on living!  I was so impressed with Sabina Spielrein's insights, she went from straight jacket crazy to Dr. of Psychology, she studied with Freud too, I ordered a book about her and her theories, Sex versus Survival.

Fassbender and Viggo were wonderful, as were the setting, costumes and story. But Knightly's actingwhat the hell was up with that? Even IF convulsing, neck-craning, stammering, eye-darting and jaw-jutting were physical symptoms of abuse for the real Sabina Spielrein, all that twitching was totally distracting and unnecessary. How could Cronenberg allow that? Is he that enamored with her? Keira Knightly seems to act from the outside in. She puts a character on like a (clown) costume instead of inhabiting an emotional core and going from there, so that the audience will actually believe she's in such a state. Physical twitchery would have to be a typical symptom of such abuse for it to register as anything resembling plausible. Is it?

5013013,5,B006PTL1QM,"Difficult material yet excellent effort by David Cronenberg.  I say ""effort"" simply because these relationships and history could be revisited from numerous angles as we change as a culture.

There is something ironic, odd, and even humorous about how absolutely precise the producers were about every material detail except one: the sado masochism scenes.  Somehow that seems appropriate. And it fits the characters as developed. If you've read about Freud and Jung you will guess that this is speculative.

What matters is the movie does help us touch the spirits of these strong-willed historically important people.  So Jung the spiritualist trumps the materialists: their spirits are still alive!

The movie ends with Sabrina actively seeking out Jung in spite of the pain and Jung having the love to tell her how important she was in his life.  Then the words on screen that Sabrina is killed by the Nazis and Freud escapes from the Nazis to London.  Jung sits pretty on his melancholy but rich island of fantasy and material wealthy.  Yet I love Jung most because he has no final answers unlike the other two who seemed to have definitively figured it out in their non-spiritual ideology and lives.

Bringing in Sabrina as the third and central spirit is ingenious and works -- my favorite part of Cronenberg's effort.

Sabrina's  thought can soar above their differences and go farther into truth.  But more importantly her presence makes clear what is lacking between Freud and Jung: a commitment to love the other through the pain of differences.  Yes, Jung needed to individuate and separate from Freud, the father symbol, but as most of us come to learn, we can still love and support our fathers.  Instead Jung and Freud are the ones who most seem to play a dangerous game.  At the expense of their work, emotional and mental growth.

Jung is often shown as a dumb, or self-servingly unconscious with Sabrina, his wife, and Freud -- using Freud's beliefs against him. Freud too seems to go against Jung's wishes in regard to Sabrina, perhaps not trusting him.  When Jung tells his totally-obvious dream to Freud, he would have to be an idiot not to see what a slap in the face it is, dumb and selfish not to understand why Freud might not want to play that game by reciprocating with his own dream.

Love was clearly the problem.  Sex forces the deeper and more important question of love on Jung and Sabrina both.  But cannot between Jung and Freud.  Will-fullness becomes far more dangerous to human development than sex.

Freud fills the vacuum left by Jung when he can no longer fill the role of psych-analyst for Sabrina due to sexual complications.  Jung -- the spiritualist -- ironically is tripped up by the material world.  And at the most crude level he asks her, How can he now ask for money for her treatment?  Sabrina sees through the material world where as Jung's soul searching religious quest has left him befuddled.

So much more here to reflect on.  I loved it most for it's evocativeness of both thought and emotion.",1461628800,,3049,4.789272030651341

5013015,3,B006PTL1QM,"I've collected all of the David Cronenberg's movie and I love the director that much.
<Shivers><Rabid> <The Brood><Scanners> <Videodrome ><The Dead Zone ><The Fly> <eXistenZ>  can be categorized as Supernatural power or mutation, <M. Butterfly><Crash><Dead Ringer>  can be a strange love, <Cosmopolis><A Dangerous Method><Spider><Naked Lunch> can be psycological, <Eastern Promises><A History of Violence><Crimes of the future> can be violence and crime.

The movie <A Dangerous Method> was kind of tepid small movie that is not all David Cronenber name big sign all written down movie.
It is about Keira Knightley, a mentally problem woman who has a relationship with a doctor Michael Fassbender. Their doctor. patient relationship become sexual but soon it becomes colleague and she becomes a lover of the doctor. And then she becomes interested in psycology and eventually becomes part of that business.
The movie was kind of boring and most of all, I cannot smell anything, any trace that this movie was made by David Conenberg. This was his first movie about the modern days and he didn't melt it well into his own story. He was just lost in the different era.
The result was just boring and even the Keira Knightley was trying so hard to look like she has problem that I was feeling that I want to go to the location and say to her that 'Hey, you are trying too hard to look like you are crazy that you are no more look like one anymore.'
All the other actors are doing their best but sadly none of them were charming at this time. After the movie, I remembered none.
Even the story, I quite didn't know what the director was about to say.
I could say something like  Sigmund  and Carl are trying to find out the best way to treat the mentally ill pacient. But I don't see how hard they try.
Although the way Keira suffered was not really that painful to feel as an audience. I looked like she was acting so hard to look like one. That's all.

How about focusing more on the research Jung  did on culture and spirituality,  how about him spending his life participating in his own research to make sure his concepts are reliable,  and how about the many books and concepts he discovered  that built a bridge between psychology/science and spirituality/religion.

5013042,4,B006PTL1QM,"Connection is a concept that is often overlooked as something that is necessary to a productive way of life. Not only can meaningful things be accomplished without help but a person needs human connection in order to thrive and be happy. Whether this is personal connection or done through online methods or letters; people yearn for connection. For some it is an absolute priority, they seek out as many friends and acquaintances that they can and for others they prefer a very small circle of friends. The common factor being people are happy when they have someone that they can talk with, and express ideas and most importantly feelings.

In the film ""Deep Impact"", humanity as a whole is faced with the impending doom of a comet colliding with the Earth destroying all life. While the world's governments attempt various plans to stop the comet they all fail until a small group of people are able to sacrifice themselves for the rest of Earth. While at the same time the remaining main characters on Earth are able to find reconciliation among various emotional differences with other people in order to find happiness.

This is no coincidence. The title may not refer to the impact of the comet into the Earth but rather that we have deep impact amongst others in our lives. This ranges from all forms of relationship types to at times people that we haven't met. The film encourages the ideas of the importance of art and culture within our society, as well as the meaningfulness of the individual. Everyone is important and should never be reduced to a number in a lottery such as the one within the film.

I do not particularly like Keira or Viggo, but this movie has made me reconsider my opinions of them.",1424217600,,485,4.7176470588235295
5013080,5,B006PTL1QM,"I saw the film recently in Sydney (April 2012) but my following comments are also colored by the fact that I had investigated the relationship between Spielrein and Jung as part of my PhD in 1997 (see http://www.lighthousedownunder.com/mydocs/spielrein.pdf).

To begin my commentary I can say that I was pleasantly surprised by the tone and relative historical accuracy that I found in the content of the movie with a couple of exceptions that I will speak to here. In general the artistic need for dramatic impact was not entirely at the expense of historical accuracy, at least the history that I have studied. So, well done!

Now, to go more deeply into the substance of their relationship, as imaginatively portrayed in the movie, I can think of no better beginning than this quote by the famous child psychiatrist Bruno Bettleheim who, I have read, did not suffer fools gladly:

""Whatever may be one's judgment of Jung's behavior toward Spielrein, probably his first psychoanalytic patient, one must not disregard its most important consequence: he cured her from the disturbance for which she had been entrusted to his care. In retrospect, we ought to ask ourselves: what convincing evidence do we have that the same result would have been achieved if Jung had behaved toward her in the way we must expect a conscientious therapist to behave towards his patient? However questionable Jung's behavior was from a moral point of view - however unorthodox, even disreputable, it may have been - somehow it met the prime obligation of the therapist towards his patient: to cure her. True, Spielrein paid a very high price in unhappiness, confusion and disillusion for the particular way in which she got cured, but then this is often true for mental patients as sick as she was. It may be good that Spielreins story reminds us that, contrary to our easy optimism that we know exactly how to treat psychologically very sick people, there are more things in heaven and earth that are dreamed of in our philosophies.""

(Foreword to: Caratenuto, Aldo. A Secret Symmetry: Sabina Spielrein between Jung and

Freud. New York: Pantheon Books, 1982.)

This quote alone points to the enormous complexity involved with deep transformative healing. In no way is Bettleheims quote, or my affirmation of that quote to be read as a license to cross therapeutic boundaries. To offer such a license is to relegate the whole process to ego desire, power plays etc. all of which are rightfully legislated against in all professional associations, state laws etc.

Rather, Bettleheim, and I think the movie, is offering not a condemnation but an account of what happened between these two pioneers of psychoanalysisan account that goes beyond moralism (but not excluding the moral dimension at all)in order to understand something of the mystery of healing.

I just said, these two pioneers of psychoanalysis. Yes, thanks to some sensitive scholarly research it is now come to light that Spielrein deserves to stand alongside Jung and Freud as a founder of psychoanalysis. The movie is very faithful to this point. Perhaps viewers who
have no prior knowledge of the historical facts may have missed the mention of Spielreins doctoral dissertation in which we find her essay Destruction as a Cause of Coming into Beinga weighty title that a movie probably could not go into in detail but it is pivotal to understanding of her central role as a theoretical pioneer in her own right. Keep in mind that Spielrein was only in her early twenties during the time of the movie. Probably she was a genius.

The key to her healing in my view lay in Jungs cognition of her genius lying beneath and within her pathology. In this cognition Jung shows his own genius as a spiritual mentor someone who perceives or cognizes the as yet latent potential within a troubled, even psychotic personality, and thus draws it forth into actuality. It is the very cognition that draws the genius into actuality. This constitutes a rare and precious form of spiritual love: an aspect of spirit seeks to incarnate and must do so through the incomplete, often disturbed and unbalanced personalities of the human vessels. Furthermore in this episode with Spielrein, we can see the seeds of Jungs unique teleological method of healing (i.e. within the present neurosis, look for the emergent, more complete personality).

The movie captures very well the suffering, conflict, and moral dilemmas that almost always follow such an incursion of spirit into materiality. Nobody escapes unmarked!

The movie for dramatic purposes brings into focus a sado-masochistic sexuality acted out by the couple even though there is no conclusive historical evidence for this behavior. I go into this aspect more fully in my essay: MAKING OF SOUL: Sabina Spielrein and C. G. Jung, to be found at my web site but we can say here, along with Bettleheim that even if they did, they each paid the price. In no way can such transgressions be approved of but at the same time, we can also acknowledge that this union was not barren, was not simply a power play that ruins lives. A birth did occur and Spielrein knew it was meant to be so, all along! She called the new being, i.e. the product of hers and Jungs union, Siegfried. She knew that this was a symbol of spiritual significance. One of Jungs many betrayals of the relationship lay in his Freudian inspired reductionist interpretation of Siegfreid as Spielreins unconscious wish for a baby by him. He could thus refuse this possibility, being a married man with children already.

In this way he contributed to Spielreins suffering immensely but ultimately could not (and nor did he wish to) abort the true birth, the birth of psychoanalysis.",1423267200,2,5729,4.943866943866944

5013092,4,B006PTL1QM,"This is a magical combination,Cronenburg and Freud,and it is scripted by a master narrator,Christopher Hampton as a play, Talking Cure,from a book,The Dangerous Method. Freud was to become the master navigator of theunconscious, exploring through scientific method and psychoanalysis,the human soul and psychology in our more secular age. Having watched it I was very impressed with Keira Knightley's performance,of a hysterical woman(Sabina Spielrein) who has suppressed her sexuality due to her father's repression and his beatings,which have adversely stimulated her desire. Without her central characterisation of an extremely complex female,who became in reality central to both Jung(Fassbinder) andFreud(Mortenssen), who was to become a psychoanalyst herself, working with both Jung and Freud,also having fallen in love with Jung,by crossing the barriers of the analyst-patient relationship,Knightley conveys extreme emotion,angst,yearning,terror and intellectual passion. She is the catalyst for Jung's rebellion against his father-figure.

Jung and Freud are played by two of the screens major character actors. Fassbinder plays the novitiate Jung,who shares his dreams with Freud(unreturned by Freud,who fears losing his authority), who feels hamstrung by Freud's singleminded focus on sexuality at the root of all our behaviour and neurosis,and Jung's attempts to broaden the canvas into religion,parapsychology and mysticism,seeking to improve his patient's lives. Freud played byMortensen as a stolid patriarch with a cigar treats his friend as a patient,who must confess his thoughts to Freud's higher authority. He wants him to be his son and heir. Freud addresses Jung in letters as ""Dear friend""(infuriating Jung).Jung proposes to treat Sabina by the `talking cure',Freud's method of analysis. Jung is shown as nervy and twitchy,a bored bourgeois,seeking release from his conventional,often pregnant wife,Emma(Sarah Gaddon), via his treatment of Otto Gross(Cassel),whose libidinous ideas inspire Jung to begin an affair with Sabina,who insists through her desire for beatings,they have a sadomasochistic relationship. Jung tries to break off with Sabina, trying to quell the rumours of their affair,but the affair continues. Freud disapproves of Jung's treatment of Sabina. Freud and Jung grow increasingly estranged. Sabina works with Freud. There are brilliant costumes, set design and period detail in both Switzerland and Vienna. The style of the movie is formal,nicely controlled of a world pre-1st World War world,in which the monsters of the id are about to erupt. Sabina like Freud was Jewish, Jung was an Aryan,who prefigured Nazi ideas of blood and the soil. Question:did he collaborate with the Nazis?",1417996800,,2728,5.9238578680203045

Kiera Knightley plays a patient both doctors worked with and that's where it all gets interesting because the relationship between the two men and the patient they have in common and her story literally determined the whole direction of self discovery and its limits we must continue to consider today.

5013115,5,B006PTL1QM,"this is a dramatic interpretation of the intellectual issues at the origins of psychoanalysis in europe around 1900, exemplified in the relationships among carl jung, his patient/mistress sabina spielrein, and the ""father figure"" sigmund freud -- all major founding personalities of early psychoanalysis. i attest, based on my extensive reading in the publications and letters of freud and jung back in my grad school days, to the accuracy of the film's depiction of the attitudes of the protagonists and the major events in the plot. it is also a lovely recreation of the historical fashions and settings of the era and superbly acted by fassbender, knightley and mortensen, who contrast against each other like three primary colors and fire what is essentially a drama of ideas in the manner of george bernard shaw into the alchemy of a character driven drama.

some reviewers of this film exemplify the human tendency (freud would associate it with a rearward body part) to overlook meaning in a fussy regard for facts -- the propriety or accuracy of showing a sexual affair between sabrina and carl, for example, or portraying carl as reserved rather than loutish. (and, by the way, both freudian and jungian psychoanalysis are ""sciences"" now largely discredited and therefore immune to any misrepresentations that this film might seem to make.) whether the affair is factual or not (i find it likely, given jung's wayward temperament), it is highly meaningful and resonant within the film as a transgression that becomes necessary in carl jung's search for what is true to himself. others dislike the vivid sexual scenes, but they seem to me necessary to anchor the basic temperaments involved: meticulous freud increasingly obsessed with what other people think, restless carl increasingly unconcerned with what other people think, and sabrina ... a molten gush of passion, pain and inspiration.

david cronenberg's achievement (as director and cowriter) is to cast this psychoanalytic triangle -- ego carl, superego sigmund, and sabrina of the boiling id -- as an elaborate family drama. the personalities argue for conflicting interpretations of science and healing, repression and freedom, creativity and destruction, civilization and its discontents (superbly exemplified in otto gross) that were raw and entirely unexplored at the time. themes we may think of today as settled or at least worn out are reimagined through the conflicted individuals who grappled with them for the first time, and we are shown how revolutionary intellectual insights, at first encounter, can unleash primal counterreactions in otherwise civilized human nature. there are even resonances of classic freudian concepts: the carl/sabrina affair as incest, the jung/freud dispute as a parricide, the benevolent tone that freud takes to spielrein as a father and daughter seduction.

whatever quibbles the fastidious may want to make about documentation and evidence, or posterity and propriety, this film struck me as accurate where it aspired to be: as a portrait of the human struggle to understand the darkest and most powerful parts of human nature. it is one of cronenberg's best works.",1404518400,,3178,5.326693227091633

When this film came out I didn't see it as I didn't see it as I feared it might be a Hollywood-ization of the man and I had too much respect for him to bear watching it.

So, now that I saw it on DVD, I was pleasantly surprised that it was as good as it was, or not as bad as I'd feared..  I thought it did a pretty good job of presenting the differences in the theories of the two great men and their personal relationship.  What bothered me,was the emphasis on the relationship between Jung and his patient, Sabina, I can understand how they wanted to spice up what could have been a dull academic study with some sex and romance, but since there is no historical proof that such a relationship existed, I think it's a mistake to present it as the centerpiece of the film.  indeed it seems to say that this relationship was responsible for Jung's development as a whole human being, or something like that.  In addition, Keira Knightly's portrayal of er is so odious that it makes her attraction to Jung quite incredible.  I've enjoyed Knightly's performances in other films but in this, she was beyond bad.  Her facial expressions were grotesque and her accent was ................?!

Jung, too, seems badly portrayed, as a terribly uptight fellow who doesn't seem particularly likable.  The most interesting of the main characters is Freud, portrayed by the always charming Viggo Mortensesn.  I would like to have seen Viggo play Jung and anyone else play Sabina. If they had to show so much of their romance they should have had some better actors play them. That would have made a more enjoyable film.

5013136,5,B006PTL1QM,"Though I've read some comments by other reviewers as to the historical accuracy of the screenplay, there is certainly a core of information about the life and times of Jung and Freud that makes this a very interesting and intellectual film.  Keira Knightley, Viggo Mortensen, and Michael Fassbender each portray highly intelligent, complex characters and they do it so convincingly.

Keira plays a tormented young woman who first visits the clinic to receive treatments for her bizarre behavior caused by an abusive father and neglectful mother. Her tics and mannerisms are so severe and disturbing that it is, at times, difficult to watch. Jung allows her to assist him in some of his therapy experiments, and this activity, and her burgeoning interest in psychotherapy, allows her to find her way back to relative normalcy. Along the way, she and Jung have an affair, which is the ""dangerous"" part of the method. She is quite addicted to Jung, though he eventually breaks it off and severs contact with her for a while.

The long conversations between Jung and Freud about methods and approaches are quite interesting, and most are set in Freud's office, which is filled with books and objets d'art. A rift develops between the two doctors over time as they disagree more and more on the developing therapies.

The sets and costumes in the film are sumptuous, and the glimpse into the history of psychotherapy is quite interesting. It is a cerebral film with some sex and intrigue, not a film for the masses but definitely entertaining, well acted and well directed.",1381276800,,1568,4.9505703422053235
5013137,4,B006PTL1QM,"A very interesting entry from director David Cronenberg that stars Viggo Mortensen and the beautiful Keira Knightley. Michael Fassbender steals the show as Dr. Carl Jung. A Dangerous Method is part biographical, part drama and part thriller. It is an exploration of psychology and the men behind it: Dr. Sigmund Freud and Dr. Carl Jung. The movie starts in 1904. I would say the portrayal of Dr. Jung is not completely flattering because the film does poke some fun at both men and offers witty dialogue. I was pleasantly surprised by this film and would say most students of psychology and fans of the director will appreciate it. It's not a documentary but you can have fun with it. Some of the director's sense of humor comes through when Jung and Freud are eating together. It's subtle but laugh out loud funny at times. The picture quality in this release is superb and the audio is almost as amazing. Sony did an excellent job on the transfer. My only complaint is that Cronenberg's ""new flesh"" signature is absent from this film unlike his classic work (Scanners, Videodrome, Existenz). There is also 39 minutes of bonus content and an audio commentary. Ignore the bad reviews (3.4 stars on Amazon) because if you like psychology and Cronenberg you won't be disappointed. Admittedly it's not for everybody because it is dialogue oriented and obviously psychological in content.

5013147,4,B006PTL1QM,"""A Dangerous Method"" is a movie that disserved by its trailer -- it looked like a movie that focused on Carl Jung having an affair with a masochistic mental patient. Well, yes, that does happen. But David Cronenberg's movie is less about the love affair and more about Carl Jung's fraying friendship with Sigmund Freud, and Viggo Mortensen and Michael Fassbender give exquisite performances. Sadly, Keira Knightley isn't up to their level.

Sabina Spielrein (Knightley) is incarcerated at a Swiss mental hospital, where she is psychoanalyzed by Carl Jung (Fassbender) -- and soon he is able to pinpoint the cause of her masochistic sexual behavior. Soon she's not only acting normally, but is studying to become a doctor herself.

Pleased by her progress, Jung speaks about her to the eminent Dr. Sigmund Freud (Mortensen), who views Jung as a surrogate son and heir to his well-regarded theories. At the same time, Jung continues working professionally with Sabina as she develops her own psychoanalytic theories -- and the two of them develop a passionate attraction.

Jung initially is reluctant to cheat on his loyal, beautiful wife. But after a sex-addicted psychoanalyst (Vincent Cassel) exhorts Jung to follow his urges, he falls into a passionate affair with Sabina. This throws a monkey wrench not only into his personal life, but it begins to interfere in his friendship with Freud -- and as Jung insists on following his own theories about myth and archetypes, his friendship with Freud begins to fall apart.

It takes a director as brilliant as David Cronenberg to not only get a movie like this made and released in theatres, but to keep it from becoming dull. Most of ""A Dangerous Method"" is made up of conversations about the human mind and how it works, slowly showing the audience that psychoanalytic theories are not really about the patient -- they are all about the shrinks and how THEY see the world.

And yet Cronenberg makes every scene, every conversation feel intense and sometimes passionate, no matter how dry the subject matter is. He makes you feel the intense passion of Jung and Sabina as they natter about their theories, contrasted to the rigid condescension of Freud. Things are intense even in a funny scene where Freud exhorts Jung to talk about kinky sexual practices at the dinner table.

And while Jung's sexual/intellectual affair with Sabina is important, the most important relationship here is the friendship with Freud and Jung, which flowers briefly before slowly decaying. Fassbender and Mortensen are absolutely spellbinding here -- one is a uncertain but passionate doctor who is seeking to explore new terrain in the human mind, and the other is an older, more entrenched man who refuses to explore different theories.

But Keira Knightley was not the right actress for this part -- she's not subtle enough to go toe-to-toe with Mortensen and Fassbender. Any displays of emotion look cartoonish and exaggerated, with her twitching and yo-yoing jaw. Even in the scenes where Sabina is composed, she feels over-the-top compared to the others.

""A Dangerous Method"" is a very cerebral, ""talky"" movie, but it also is a powerful look back at the men and women who created psychology as we know it today. And while Knightley is embarrassing, Fassbender and Mortensen are astounding.",1366588800,2,3325,5.043715846994536
5013148,2,B006PTL1QM,"I could not even finish the movie and I am not surprised when a friend told me later that the book is a real snoozer too. Time and again, good actors cannot make up for a dog of a script, the basis of a movie that is mind numbingly slow.",1366502400,,237,3.76
5013149,2,B006PTL1QM,"A Dangerous Method, written by Christopher Hampton and directed by David Cronenberg, is the story of the relationship between the founding intellects of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud (played by Viggo Mortensen replete with prosthetic nose) and Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender), and their relationship with their patient, student, and fellow analyst Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightly).

Almost thirty years after the techno-surrealist, sadomasochistic stylings of Cronenberg's  Videodrome, the restraint of A Dangerous Method is often boringly neurotic instead of excruciatingly grotesque. And yet, the film immediately causes intense, almost physical discomfort in the viewer--Knightley's over-acted contortions hardly capture the grotesque contortions of the hysteric, but certainly induce uneasiness. The hyper-confessional mode of the ""talking cure"" itself is an uncomfortable one--most of the plot development is encased in diagnostic dialogue and dream interpretation.

According to the film's description, Jung and Freud supposedly ""fall under [the unbalanced yet beautiful] Sabina's spell."" Spielrein is portrayed as ""systematically planning"" the seduction of Carl Jung, and slashes his face when he breaks off their affair. The film risks the reduction of scholar and Holocaust victim Sabina Speilrein, via Knightly's performance and the speculation of an epic love affair, to a mad but one-note seductress who spews clichs in her farcical and throaty Russian accent; ""I want you to punish me."" The best scenes are those between Jung and Freud, arguing over the future legacy of psychoanalysis, to the point that one wonders why the mediating figure of Knightly's Spielrein was necessary at all.

A Dangerous Method disappointingly relies almost entirely on a sense of historical gravitas to carry the story; it is bloated with a sense of documentarian import, while taking little care with the figures and events it portrays. Overall, the film is mediocre, and runs long.",1365379200,2,1977,5.8068965517241375

5013153,3,B006PTL1QM,"It seems that those naughty sophisticated intellectual Europeans of 100 years ago were not casually naughty, they spent a lot of time thinking about it. On the historic side this movie introduces us to a young Carl Jung Carl a doctor first experimenting with the new Freudian psychoanalytic methods, his older father figure Sigmund Freud and the wildly hysterical Sabina Spielrein. These are three historical figures two known to us, one almost forgotten. In fact the three of them had some type of relationship although perhaps not as portrayed. There exists extensive record of close friends Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud and their breakup is a matter of historic record. The Russian born Sabina Spielrein did first enter this group as a patient and later as a leading light in founding the field of child psychology. She would know the two men quite well the record is not clear if she would become a mistress to either.

Between the quality of the acting the costumes and sets this is a five-star movie. The problem is in the story line. Upon reflection it does not hold together. Specifically the arguments being presented by the principles and the principal visuals do not coincide.

As A Dangerous Method would have it, Dr. Jung would become passionately involved with his former patient and provide her with the S and M sex she wanted.  To dispense with the sexual side of the movie Sabrina clearly enjoys her role on the receiving end of violent sex.  Carl is not portrayed as enjoying it very much. He looks to be experimenting with sex as therapy rather than a means of  allowing either himself or her to experience the freedom that is one of the central themes of the larger story.

The inconsistency is that Dr. Jung argues that Freud is wrong in assigning sexuality as the single driving force behind psychology. However it is the sexual activity between Carl and Sabrina that consumes a very large portion of the movie. What in fact drove the breakup between these two founding giants. is that Dr. Jung developed a number of theories largely emphasizing elements such as racial memory. For racial memory to work people would receive particular impulses genetically. In the early 1900s there was no scientific basis for genetics at this level and the specificity of racial memory still sounds more mystical than scientific. Very little of the story line in A Dangerous Method covers or clarifies the their differences.

The good news is that the principal actors Michael Fassbender (Carl Jung), Kiera Knightley (Sabina Spielrein) and Viggo Mortensen (Dr. Freud) perform their roles brilliantly under the very tight direction of David Cronenberg. Miss Knightley portrayal of hysteria and her transition into a trained psychologist are exceptional performances. The bulk of the dialogue of this movie is thought-provoking the sexual visuals do not support the intellectual themes.

This is not a popcorn movie. The hysterical version of Sabrina makes demands on the viewer. The sex scenes whiel kinky are more clinical than titivating. Consequently the audience for this movie is going to be those who do not plan to turn off their brains, are not too committed to absolute historical accuracy and are not going to turn away at the first sign of a bared nipple.",1362787200,8,3271,4.945355191256831

5013166,3,B006PTL1QM,"A Dangerous Method certainly can't be accused of a lack of ideas. During it's all-too-brief 99-minute running time, it attempts to tackle the birth and eventual dissolution of the friendship between Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud, Jung's almost subconscious dissatisfaction with his family life, the torrid, potentially destructive affair Jung has with one of his patients, a major load of various psychosexual and philosophical themes, and the birth of psychoanalysis and - eventually, in many ways - modern psychology. That's a whole lot to heap on one film's plate. And that's just the problem; it is simply far too much to satisfactorily explore with any real depth in a mere 99 minutes. In order to succeed, one of two things needed to be done:

1. Expand this to at least three hours.

2. More realistically, choose one of those ideas and explore it at length. Wrench every last drop of psychological drama and substance from it. Use it to present a small, focused set of themes and ideas that form a film with substance. Use them to suggest something interesting. Use them to say something about human nature. Use them to do anything memorable!

Instead, screenwriter Christopher Hampton seems too married to all of the different story elements of his own play to effectively edit out what may be unimportant in the grand scheme of things. Personally, I think this would have been most interesting had it focused solely on the relationship between Jung and Freud; what initially connects them and unites them as colleagues, and the eventual personal and ideological conflicts that inevitably lead to their parting ways, and what could arguably be considered a rivalry. But all of the other pieces of the film - mainly the relationship between Jung and his mentally unstable mistress - get in the way of that potentially fascinating storyline and, as a result, everything the film presents feels surface level, as if we're only seeing the tip of the proverbial iceberg.

There may be no type of film more frustrating than A Dangerous Method - a film so rich with ideas and so unsure of what to do with them.",1356048000,,2110,4.885474860335195

5013170,4,B006PTL1QM,"... ultimately not as profound an investigation into the characters of Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung as it ought to have been, and indeed as it seemed it would be for 90% of the film. It's scarcely a film about Freud at all; Jung is the central character throughout. It's the ethical, emotional and intellectual turmoil of his life that shapes the drama; his divergence from Freud is presented as largely the result of sexual and professional jealousy on both sides, with just the merest hint of the impending catastrophe of anti-semitism and an even slimmer hint of the substantial incompatibility of Freud's and Jung's psychological models. Nevertheless, the very capable acting of Viggo Mortensen as Freud and Michael Fassbender as Jung keeps the film engrossing.

The insurmountable problem is the acting of Keira Knightley in the role of the historical person Sabina Spielrein, first shown on screen as a flailing hysteric, then as a challenging patient significantly ""helped"" by Jung's psychoanalysis, then as the masochistic lover and manipulator of Jung, thus becoming the ""wedge"" between Jung and Freud. The characterological triangle is not entirely implausible. In fact, it might approach ""fact"" or at least insight. But Knightley so freakishly overacts throughout that the triangle loses its hypotenuse. Knightley's grimaces and writhings are hard enough to watch, but her spoken dialogue is horrible. She seems to be attempting a ""Russian"" accent in this English-language script that rightly should be in German. Alas, her Russo-English slips often - sometimes in mid sentence - into a twangy LA Valley Girl accent. And how's that for weird, since she is actually British by birth? Even if her accent were better managed, her speaking technique is amateurish; ""stars"" who are paid celestial salaries surely can be expected to have basic skills of dramatic elocution.

I'm stymied about a proper rating for this film. As I said, I found it engrossing; ergo four stars, though Knightly is so awful that I'm tempted to slam the film with a three. There's also, to my mind, a failure of resolve in the abrupt ending of the film. Bang, it's over, and we are informed by crawling script that Jung survived his WW1 breakdown and lived until 1961! Sabina Spielrein and her two children were killed by a Nazi German SS Death Squad, Einsatzgruppe D in August 1942 in Zmievskaya Balka, together with 27,000 other victims.",1354492800,2,2421,5.080402010050252

It was like watching a bad high school stage production in which the immature actress completely overacts.  What was so hard to watch was that she was so obviously acting - you try as a film viewer to suspend belief and get absorbed in the roles of the film.  However, when the acting is so bad all you see is someone pathetically attempting to act and nothing more.

I found the clash of ideas, the class differences, and the struggle between rivalry and respect very interesting. The diversion caused by the insertion of Speilrein and her sexual and mental health issues was just that- a diversion. It was a topic of sufficient interest to merit it's own movie, but only served to distract from the story told here. What's worse was Knightly's presentation of her. I don't know whether it was her interpretation or the direction, but I have worked in an in patient setting treating seriously mentally ill people and have never seen anything like her performance. It made me want to roll my eyes and turn off the movie. Not only that but her weird accent was off- especially given that she was the only one to attempt an accent at all despite the fact that none of them were Americans. You've really got to create a cohesive picture and when something is that wrong, it effects the whole feel. Is it worth seeing? Yes, if you are interested in psychology or mental health in that time period, but probably not if you are looking to be entertained.

5013176,3,B006PTL1QM,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

'A Dangerous Method' is advertised as a film mainly dramatizing the conflict between iconic therapists Carl Jung and his one-time mentor, Sigmund Freud. But the bulk of the film is really about an affair that Jung had with one of his patients, Sabina Spielrein, who later went on to become a prominent Russian physician and psychoanalyst.

The film begins in 1904 with Spielrein, a young medical student, checking into a psychiatric clinic with severe symptoms of what was termed 'hysteria' in those days. She primarily displays a complex motor tic of continuously thrusting her jaw out and stuttering and often must be restrained by the staff at the clinic. Carl Jung, a student of Sigmund Freud, employs Freud's new 'talking therapy' with Spielrein, who makes remarkable progress and is soon offered a job by Jung, to assist him in his medical research (Spielrein's transformation from borderline psychotic to responsible student is too abrupt as we never see how Jung actually works his miracle--Jung returns from military leave and we must take it on faith that somehow, through the passage of time, his therapy simply worked!)

Jung is married to a wealthy woman who he has a number of children with. During the course of his relationship with Spielrein, he treats a disaffected physician, Otto Gross, who urges him to abandon his monogamous ways and pursue his sexual desires with Sabina. It is the contention of the film's scenarists that Jung indeed began an affair with Spielrein; her illness was related to being physically punished by her father in childhood and she now sublimates these negative experiences by engaging in masochistic spanking and bondage sessions with Jung (coupled with normal sexual encounters).

Meanwhile, Jung corresponds with Freud and meets with him a number of times, including a trip to America. Freud is depicted as a rigid theoretician and practitioner, inflexibly adhering to his core belief that mental illness is rooted only in childhood sexual experiences. Jung eventually seeks to incorporate other theories to explain psychological dysfunction which Freud derides, and ultimately rejects, as 'mysticism'.

The dissolution of Jung and Freud's relationship is tied to Jung's dissolving relationship with Spielrein. He not only publishes studies about his treatment of her but her dissertation as well. They both agree that acts of creation can be rooted in destruction (holding up their own relationship as a perfect example: a clash of opposites and breaking of taboos), not necessarily related to Freud's one note obsession with childhood sexuality. Although Spielrein is essentially on Jung's side, she decides to undergo analysis with Freud who she hopes might play mediator between the warring couple, after Jung (due to guilt feelings) breaks things off between them. While Spielrein takes the high road by not exposing Jung, she insists he confess his indiscretions to Freud. After agreeing to Spielrein's request, Freud uses Jung's confession against him, bashing Jung in future correspondence, after his former pupil fails to pay homage to him. After they split, both Freud and Jung then fail to acknowledge Speilrein's contributions. She finally gets over Jung, becomes a notable analyst in her own right and has children with a kindly physician from her native Russia.

The resolution of both of these plot strands (Jung and Freud and Jung and Spielrein), will prove of great interest to aficionados of the great psychotherapeutic icons, but to the general public, perhaps much more anti-climactic. If we are to believe the scenarists here, Jung went way beyond his mentor Freud, in terms of presenting much broader, holistic, psychological constructs. Much of this we learn in the closing titles at film's end but I'm not convinced that Jung is the better of the two.

To their credit, Freud is depicted as a minority practitioner, beleaguered on many sides, due to his unpopular emphasis on sexuality. He argued that Jung's belief in 'superstition' undermined the 'scientific' basis of their profession. Ultimately, a one hour and forty five minute film, can only touch upon the basic conflicting points between the two men. For a deeper understanding between Freud and Jung, a real solution is to read through their writings. Creative luminaries such as Joyce Joyce, however, did not care to--he dubbed them both ""Tweedledum and Tweedledee"" (perhaps if both of them had written a novel as good as 'Ulysses', they may have earned Joyce's approbation).

Michael Fassbender as Jung is perhaps the strongest of the three principals. He displays a subdued intensity throughout the film. Many internet posters found Keira Knightley as Spielrein to be way over the top, particularly in the early scenes where she is depicted as being completely unhinged. I didn't think she was that bad at all and is perhaps the strongest when she makes her case for Jung, while meeting up with Freud. Viggo Mortensen comes off as a bit boring as Freud but is perhaps saddled by the rather ponderous, dialogue heavy script.

'A Dangerous Method' will keep your interest up to a point. Ultimately, however, Freud and Jung's work may not be worth immortalizing in any film at all. There is a deeper and darker tale here, far more ominous and important than the conflict between seemingly self-involved intellectuals. I'm referring to the fate of Sabina Spielrein, revealed in the closing credits. She was murdered along with her two children by Einsatzgruppe D, one of the Nazi death squads, near her home town in Russia, in August of 1942. The machinations of Freud and Jung seem like a distant memory in light of the evil which inexorably began its march over the European continent some 100 years ago, almost to this day.",1351209600,4,5800,5.142099681866384
5013177,5,B006PTL1QM,"I think this was an exceptional and brilliant film and give it 5 stars, but I have been reading the work of Freud and Jung for thirty years and I think that many people unfamiliar with the history of psychoanalysis would find this film too complex and dense to be enjoyed. That is a shame since the themes explored are fascinating and the acting was first rate. But the bottom line is that this is a film that will appeal to a limited audience of intellectual viewers.

The primary focus of the film was divided between the psychological struggles of a brilliant young woman and the sexual and intellectual struggles of a brilliant psychologist attempting to forge a model of human consciousness and unconsciousness while at the mercy of his own desires and impulses. A secondary theme was the professional scientific and personal relationship between Sigmund Freud and Carol Jung over a 7 year period critical to the development of the field of psychoanalysis.

Carl Jung was very familiar with the work of Sigmund Freud and began writing to him about there mutual interests in abnormal psychology. But the two men were very different in many ways and these differences eventually lead to tension in their relationship. The film does a credible job of contrasting Freud, an Austrian Jewish physician, and the wealthy Jung, a privileged Swiss psychiatrist. Early in the film Jung begins to use Freud's method of analysis whereby the psychiatrists sits behind the patient so as to reduce projection onto the psychiatrist and to create a more ambiguous sensation for the patient so that they can actually focus on their own projections and images without looking to the therapist for approval or disapproval. Jung complains that Freud writes much about the intellectual side of the analysis without giving many details as to the actual implementation of the methodology, thus early in the film Jung's independent thought is demonstrated.

Freud saw Sabrina Spielrein as a patient when she was 19 years old and published her case history as the case of Sabrina S. It is Emma Jung in the film who tells the viewer that surely this Sabrina S written about by Freud is the same Sabrina Spielrein who has been admitted to the psychiatric hospital under the care of Dr. Jung.

Michael Fassbender does an outstanding job as he plays Carl Jung. The character of Jung is pivotal in this film and Jung is a brilliant but conflicted human being. Jung was an outstanding genius, comparable to the genius of Freud, but he loses his bearings when he begins an affair with Sabrina Spielrein. His attempts to gain control of himself and the relationship reveal his cold determination which Fassbender plays very well. Fassbender's athletic sexual physique appears to be ready to explode out of the tight Victorian clothing that binds him much as Jung's sexuality is exploding out of his overly controlled intellect. Jung may appear overly harsh, controlled and rejecting as he ends the affair with Spielrein but he was becoming unhinged from the ground upon which he had built his personal, intellectual and professional life.

Kira Knightly does a superb job of playing Sabrina Spielrein. Spielrein has neurotic tics that manifest when painful or conflicting memories emerge. The early scenes where Spielrein relates to Jung how often her father whipped her naked behind and then forced her to kiss his hand after the whipping are very powerful. As a child Spielrein would sometimes urinate in fear while being whipped and her father would whip her again for the urination. She now dreams of a catlike creature whispering into her ear as a slug like creature crawls on her lower back. Jung is able to connect that Spielrein would masturbate to images and memory of physical punishment and that pain had thus become eroticized for her. Knightly was able to portray mental illness, repressed eroticism and intellectual acuity in one outstanding performance.

Vincent Cassel deserves mention for the part he plays as Dr. Otto Gross, another brilliant but unstable mind in an addict. However it is in conversation with the way-out Gross that Jung comes to terms with his passion for a brilliant and beautiful patient.

Viggo Mortensen plays Sigmund Freud with careful understatement. Freud believed that in Jung he had finally found the champion, the heroic son, who would carry his theories forward. Much of their relationship in the film vibrates between a father-son relationship, a mentor-mentee relationship, and a professional competition. Of course the scene is included where Freud and Jung share dreams on the voyage to America and Freud tells Jung that one dream he can not reveal since he would lose his `authority' which Jung relates as the point where Freud lost all authority for him. It is to the film's credit that it includes the discussions between Freud and Jung on strategy whereby Freud wished their work to remain focused, concentrated, demonstrable, and repeatable whereas Jung was becoming more expansive, overly inclusive, and willing to explore paranormal experiences that are almost impossible to demonstrate or repeat under controlled conditions. Both strategies may advance scientific thought but the tensions eventually disrupt their personal and professional relationships.

Eventually the tables turn as Spielrein emerges from her neurosis and becomes a brilliant psychoanalyst in her own right, mentored and complimented by Sigmund Freud.

Thus this 99 minute films is about two complex themes; the development, expression, and repression of sexual desires as demonstrated in the relationship of Spielrein and Jung and the creation, translation and re-creation of complex scientific ideology as demonstrated in the relationship of Jung and Freud.",1350172800,6,5758,5.1431623931623935

I would like to see something between these two great men again in the future.",1349654400,2,515,4.677777777777778
5013179,5,B006PTL1QM,"Carl Jung (1875-1961) is known today as a respected psychoanalyst. His father was a protestant minister and Carl maintained a deep interest in religion, spirituality, myths, and even superstition throughout his life. He disagreed with the Sigmund Freud's theory (1856-1939) that the underlying human drive is sex. Thus, for example, Freud says that some people are unable to overcome early sexual attractions to their mother or father and he says art can be a sublimation of the sex drive. While Freud insisted on a strictly scientific study of people, Jung felt that psychoanalysts must also delve into improvable imaginative mystical and spiritual matters. One of his theories is archetypes: ideas can be transmitted from one generation to the next. This is well known. However what is not known is that Jung unprofessionally had long-lasting sexual affairs with at least two of his patients for years.

 This 2011 film tells part of the story of Jung's affair with Sabina Spielrein. It began in 1905 and lasted for five years. The film is based on the book by the same name by John Kerr. Spielrein was 19 years old and Jung's first patient. She was ten years younger than Jung who was married. Jung at the time was impressed by the treatment method of Sigmund Freud and used it to treat Spielrein successfully.

A serious problem with the Freud method is transference: patients develop a strong feeling of love for the doctor. Thus the author calls it a ""dangerous method."" As expected, Spielrein became enamored with Jung, and Jung, who had stopped loving his wife, took advantage of Spielrein sexually. Jung met Freud in 1906 and began a friendly relationship with him until Freud learnt of Jung's misuse of his profession and sexual affair. Freud ended his relations with Jung in 1913.

 Sabina Spielrein became a physician and a psychoanalyst, married, had two daughters, and moved to Russia. She is credited with introducing psychoanalysis to Russia. She and her husband were Jewish. Stalin murdered her husband and the Nazis killed her and her two daughters. After Spielrein left for Russia, Jung, a non-Jew, began an affair with another one of his patients who was also Jewish. Freud with whom Adler had disagreements was also Jewish. In view of Jung repeatedly taking unprofessional advantage of Jews and other acts, as well as articles he wrote during the Nazi regime in Germany in which he spoke disparagingly about Jewish psychoanalysis, there are analysts who are convinced that Jung was an anti-Semite.",1348963200,2,2518,5.028776978417266

5013181,4,B006PTL1QM,"The movie is based on the book A Most Dangerous Method and the stage play The Talking Cure. It follows Carl Jung and details his relationship with Sigmund Freud and the development of psychoanalysis.

It's not typically my type of movie, but I didn't get bored not one time (and that is super rare for me in something like this.) But here's why I liked it.

The movie is complex. And I think the directors and actors handled the material very well. Michael Fassbender did a great job showing Jung's struggles to stick to own theories while feeling the pressure to conform to Freud's (played by Viggo Mortenson) ""scientific"" (and mostly sex-obsessed) approach to psychology.

The movie starts in 1904 when Jung takes on the hysterical Sabina Speilrein, a Russian Jew (played oddly by Keira Knightly) and tries out Freud's new psychoanalytic theories on her. It works wonders and she not only makes vast improvements but grows up and becomes invested in the field herself.

The rift between Freud and Jung start when Jung realizes that Freud will never see him as an equal, though Freud tries to spin it as disgust at Jung's affair with Sabina. It seemed to be Freud was threatened by Jung and tried to shut him up by saying that Jung's theories would ruin and discredit the field of psychology.

I had a little bit of a hard time being convinced that Keira Knightly was Russian or a Jew. Her accent seemed a little inconsistent at times, but I think she did the best she could and that helped me look past it. The significance of Sabina & Freud being Jewish and Jung being a Swiss-Reformed Aryan is only slightly touched upon. I think they could have delved a little deeper into that, but the movie wanted to keep the majority of the focus on Jung's relationships with Freud & Sabina and also Jung's relationship with himself and how he goes from being a student of Freud's and doubting himself to being one the leading psychologists of his time.

For me it was especially interesting to follow Jung as I didn't know nearly as much about him as I knew about Freud. I think this is worthwhile movie to watch for anyone interested in psychology.",1347494400,,2142,4.623684210526315

Poor choice, she is no Russian, if you ask me.

5013189,5,B006PTL1QM,"I'm a huge fan of Cronenberg and have been since VIDEODROME, and I'm really appreciating the filmmaker he's grown into. He refused to pigeon-hole himself into just making hyper-violent or horrifically unnerving psuedo-sexual horror or suspense films; with SPIDER and A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE, he started entering the world of a fully mature director who could now play with all the toys that cinema had to offer. After that, though, came his safest film EASTERN PROMISES, and other than a bravura performance by Viggo Mortensen, is a sadly forgettable film. But with A DANGEROUS METHOD, he subverts another genre of filmmaking: The Historical Biopic.

Aside from the excellent (but unsurprisingly historically inaccurate) storytelling and great performances by Michael Fassbender as Carl Jung, Vincent Cassel as Otto Gross, and Viggo Mortensen as Sigmund Freud, the real standout here is Keira Knightley who gives a brilliant, uncompromising performance as Sabina Spielrein, the young woman who comes to Jung's hospital for treatment and is the catalyst for the drama within the film. Many people who are giving this film less than stellar reviews are singling out Knightley for ""overacting"" when she's in the throes of her hysteria. Obviously I wasn't there, but from historical documentarians and accounts, this is a very successful recreation of a woman suffering from hysteria. To be quite honest though, even if it wasn't an exacting duplication, it's utterly convincing, totally unflinching, and excruciatingly heartbreaking to watch. The most important part of a great performance is to not see the actor through the character they're playing, and when they disappear into a role, it's really breathtaking to witness. That's exactly what Knightley does with the role of Sabina; she doesn't just play her, she becomes her.

I've been a great admirer for the most part of Knightley's roles of late now that she is unshackled from having to be the prissy quasi-adventurer of the terrible PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN series, and that can really be initially witnessed through her transformation into ""Domino"" Harvey in Tony Scott's DOMINO (a film worth seeing once, but not much more than that), and her stellar work in Mark Romanek's underrated and underseen NEVER LET ME GO. This is the performance I've been waiting for from her, and believe me it's well worth the wait.

Cronenberg doesn't stray too far away from his favorite subject of sexuality and the modern mind/body, and he does extract some kink from what might otherwise be a beautifully acted and shot but all-too-safe biopic, and the sado-masochism this film displays does fit within the confines of this film and this subject matter. Mortensen shines as Freud, a man full of wisdom and bonhomie, but also a man filled with trepidation. Fassbender is fascinating as a Jung, the ""son"" to Freud's ""father"" of the field of psychoanalysis, and as a man who is of two minds about a great many things, but is steadfast in his belief that Freud's ""talking cure"" has to evolve. Cassel as Gross is hypnotic in his own twisted way as a early 20th-Century hippie; a practitioner of polygamy, a man who uses drugs to expand his consciousness; a man constantly in search of pleasure and looked to cure those who would deny themselves pleasure. Jung is the man caught between all of these characters; Freud, Gross and Spielrein... all of them seem to pull him in different directions, but all of them help to shape the man he would become.

A DANGEROUS METHOD is more than just a story about two of the most significant minds of the 20th Century and the woman that would come between them; it's about the first ripple of a movement that would change everything in the world to come, and Cronenberg does this ripple great justice.",1344124800,,3777,5.009554140127388

The film is spellbinding, the three lead actors are amazing and the story is extremely well told and gripping.
As I said, studying psychology help to see hidden layers in the dialog about the main character views in life and the method of Freud and Jung such as their views on sex, death and nations.
Even without that extra level of knowledge the film is a great example of the masterful directing skills of Cronenberg and the acting skills of Mortensen, Fassbender and Knightley.",1343692800,,728,4.564885496183206
5013191,3,B006PTL1QM,"Essentially this is a movie about Jung and the significant relationships in his life - with his forerunner and contemporary in psychoanalysis, Freud, with his rich and patient wife, and perhaps most of all with the patient with whom he falls in love and has an affair, Sabina Spielrein.  It's hard to see the Cronenberg of old who would delve into murkiness and come up with visually inventive and often shocking ideas.. here, the photography is bright and crisp, the mannerisms impeccable and the period seemingly immaculately recreated.  The pace is measured, and in the manner of the time, ""violent arguments"" are mere words on paper, so much of what was said being done by letter.  Indeed, it is through the letters of Freud and Jung so much is known about them, apparently.  So it's a biography, covering the pivotal career trajectory of Jung.  And yet for all the willingness to show things for how they were (Knightley has a brave and deliberate performance, which was apparently well researched, as the detail rich commentary by Cronenberg attests), is less emotionally involving, and more.. well, clinical, if you'll forgive the analogy.  The details are interesting and well observed, the history of the two men in particular is of some significance, and yet for all the fine performances it is hard to truly be engaged emotionally.  Fassbender has a wonderful performance as Jung, finding out about himself as much as about his patients at times, and Mortensen is really wonderfully understated as he puffs his pipe, and wrestles with his opinion of the man he had hoped would carry his work forward.  Their interplay during their period of friendship is arguably the movies highlight, as they ponder each others dreams..""Have you considered the rolling log could be your penis..?"".  Knightley has done a great job in a difficult role, having to convince as someone seriously mentally ill at the start, but who went on to become a significant psychoanalyst in her own right.  Alas, her Russian accent, while not awful, leaves you forever reminded she is acting, when everyone else speaks perfectly normally.  It's defensible from a movie convention point of view, but distracts.
Taken on its own, without any preconceptions, this is a well crafted and visually beautifully conceived movie.  It's just hard sometimes to forget that with Cronenberg we so often expect something with more bite.  Without that bite,  what we are left with is a biopic that educates a little, engages somewhat less, but is so beautifully shot and acted, it's like a Merchant Ivory film with added rude words.  6/10",1342915200,,2603,4.993055555555555

5013193,4,B006PTL1QM,"""A Dangerous Method"", directed by David Cronenberg, is a screen adaptation by Christopher Hampton of his own stage play, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Talking-Cure/dp/0571214851/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Talking Cure</a>"". The idea for this biographical drama derives from John Kerr's scholastic study of 1994, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Most-Dangerous-Method/dp/1609984862/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Most Dangerous Method</a>"", which chronicles the rise of psychoanalysis as a clinical treatment of hysteria and other mental conditions and explores the relationship between Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung and the catalytic role played in both the establishment and demise of that relationship by Sabine Spielrein.  The book is long and detailed in its subject matter, documenting not only clinical methods but also placing events into the social context of their time. It presents an interweaving not just of the personal desires, obsessions and paranoias of its central characters but also of wider events to spin a complex tale of politics, hysteria, anti-Semitism, sexual duplicity, repression and intellectual brilliance wielded as blackmail.

Christopher Hampton has done a masterly job of extracting the human interest story from the wider academic treatment, making Sabine Spielrein the true protagonist of the drama. In the screenplay we see her gradual transformation from highly dysfunctional hysteric to eminent and respected psychoanalyst in her own right.  Along the way, she becomes Jung's mistress and is shown as herself being pivotal in a number of the turning points in his life. Alongside, the film details the development of the friendship of the two principal proponents of the emerging field of psychoanalysis, following by the gradual divergence of their ideas, fueled by the inherent differences in the characters and the circumstances in their lives. And always, it seems, with Sabine Spielrein in the mix somewhere.

While the exact details of the relationship between Jung and Spielrein remain speculative and conjectural, much of the screen adaptation is given greater authority by an almost obsessional attention to historical detail, with many of the scenes and much of the dialogue drawn from the copious notebooks, diaries and letters that all parties routinely kept and exchanged. There are nevertheless many aspects to the production that are distinctly Cronenberg in style and feel. Overall, he imbues an already uncomfortable tale with an air of voyeurism which shifts the original screenplay into a darker and more unsettling place altogether.

The acting is by and large superb. Viggo Mortensen's portrayal of a brooding and somewhat paranoid Sigmund Freud is played to perfection -- and invariably with a cigar to his lips -- while Michael Fassbender does an admirable job of conveying Carl Jung's cautious and self-conscious approach to his own ideas which seems to have left him so susceptible and malleable in his relationships with others. Fassbender does a good job too of portraying Jung's own gradual mental disintegration at the approach of the Great War. Keira Knightly pulls off the role of unstable but brilliant Sabine Speilrein quite well, once one manages to ignore her fluctuating accent. Credit should also go to Vincent Cassel in his almost bit-part role of the wayward Otto Gross -- the serpent who mesmerises his prey -- as well as to newcomer, Sarah Gadon, whose quietly understated performance as Jung's wife, Emma, makes one wish that the writers had been able to find a way to include more of her story in the mix.  Cinematographically, the production is sumptuous (although let down by some over ambitious CGI work in places) whilst Howard Shore's Wagner-derived score is a perfect accompaniment to the scenes that call for it (and nicely absent when not).

The DVD production also includes a brief ""Making of..."" feature, as well as informative commentary soundtrack by director, David Cronenberg, plus descriptive soundtrack for the unsighted.",1342310400,,4101,5.713114754098361
5013194,4,B006PTL1QM,"In the early 1900's Sigmund Freud developed a method of analyzing dreams that some in the psychiatric profession considered dangerous.  This early look at what became known as psychoanalysis is focused on a young disciple of Freud's, Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender, ""Prometheus"").

An early patient of Jung was a disturbed young woman who had prolonged fits of hysteria.  Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightley) suffered abuse as a child and had grown to enjoy sexual pleasure from pain although she remained a virgin until Jung fell in love with her.  Jung was happily married with several children, but couldn't resist Spielrein once her health improved and she was no longer his patient.  In one great scene after their affair was over, a now married and pregnant Spielrein asks Jung if ""he had taken on any other `admirers'.""  He replied ""you were the jewel of great price.""  Great words from writer Christopher Hampton.

Director David Cronenberg (""Eastern Promises"") uses a vast library of coorespondence between the characters to develop the film.  The sets and locations in Austria and Germany are beautiful and appear authentic.  Again much information on this era was available to the filmmakers.  They got it right.  Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortensen, ""A History of Violence"") eventually mentors Spielrein who becomes an influential child psychologist of the day.  His relationship with Jung begins to sour, however, as Jung believes Freud is too narrow-minded in his analyses.  The film is provocative and sometimes erotic.  Mortensen and Fassbender deliver understated performances and Knightley gets your attention when she goes into full hysteria mode as Spielrein.  You may hate her or love her, but you'll surely remember her.  The movie certainly isn't for everyone, but I liked it.

I could find no fault with this Blu ray 1080p transfer.  Using a 1.85:1 aspect ratio every detail is perfect.  Dark shots are dark and exterior well lit shots are beautiful.

5013196,4,B006PTL1QM,"David Cronenberg likes to take on sexually and violently charged controversies, so it's not surprising that he was attracted by Christopher Hampton's play ""The Talking Cure"", whose storyline was based on the book ""A Most Dangerous Method"" by John Kerr, an exploration of the role that Russian psychoanalyst Sabina Spielrein played in the relationship between Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung in the years before World War I. Christopher Hampton wrote the screenplay for ""A Dangerous Method"" as well, and that is evident in the strong dialogue.

In 1904, Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightley), daughter of wealthy Russian Jews, is brought to the Burghlzhi Clinic in Zurich in a state of hysteria. Dr. Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender) wants to try the theoretical ""talking cure"" developed by Austrian psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortensen) on her. Conveniently, Miss Spielrein turns out to be a masochist who is sexually excited by humiliation. Sabina recovers and enrolls at university with the intention of becoming a psychoanalyst herself. But her aggressive, raw sexuality proves too much for Carl Jung to resist, which eventually threatens his social standing and his already ideologically strained relationship with Freud.

I was surprised that I liked this film as much as I did, because I have never found the work of either Freud or Jung the least bit interesting. I find them both largely fanciful. But there is more insight into the human psyche to be found in the ideological and personal conflicts between Freud and Jung than in anything those men published. There is real drama in their creeping hatred for one another. Freud's insistence on an exclusively sexual interpretation of clinical material versus Jung's increasingly far flung interests in parapsychology. This is exacerbated by conflicts of class, ethnicity, and personality. In walks Sabina Spielrein to stir it all up, in love with Jung but usually siding with Freud.

I'm not sure if Keira Knightley overacted Sabina Spielrein's illness, but she deftly conveys Sabina's bright, self-possessed, but slightly nutty character for most of the film. Viggo Mortensen is unrecognizable as Sigmund Freud. It's not just the make-up. His voice is unlike I've ever heard it before. Jung is perhaps the trickiest of the trio to portray, as he is an affluent, respectable WASP, with wealthy wife and beautiful children, who, in spite of his criticism of Freud's practicality, is the most practical of all. He mistreats his mistress to protect his fortune and social standing. Michael Fassbender, with help from Christopher Hampton, makes us see his point of view, at least.",1341792000,,2633,5.264285714285714
5013197,5,B006PTL1QM,"A DANGEROUS METHOD is an exquisite film with brilliant acting, the historical mystery of the beginning of psychoanalysis,with Carl Jung, his first patient, Sabina Spielrein and Sigmund Freud, in the class with the film on the life of Mozart, Amadeus. The script is terrific, and mostly historically accurate, and is based on the London play, The Talking Cure,and the book A Most Dangerous Method, By John Kerr, the book I used to write a play I did off off B'way in '07, Jung Among The Women, which I turned into an Amazon.com novel. This film is 5 plus stars, and is miles above the boring and mediocre movies made in the US. Keira Knightley should get an Academy Award for her role as Spielrein, she is that good. The USA is probably the most neurotic nation on the globe, needs to look to this kind of elevation of the psyche, to what Jung calls in the film, ""another hinge to the universe"" - He disagreed with Freud, in that psychoanalysis should do more than describe the sexual ""toad"" of our illness, but show us the way to become the person we were meant to be i.e, individuation and the constellation of our archetypal SELF"" For Canadian Jungian Analyst Miriam Woodman""All therapies without archetypal energy are merely bandaids.""

5013198,5,B006PTL1QM,"A Dangerous Method doesn't delve as deeply into the rift between Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud as it could have, but is nevertheless, a solid effort from director David Cronenberg. Cronenberg is not known for his subtlety, but the more mature style on display here is nuanced, and if it could have delved deeper, it at least gets what it does show right for the most part.  Though fans of his previous films might miss the shock and awe of films like Scanners, his remake of The Fly, Crash (not the Oscar winner but a much more twisted tale starring James Spader), Naked Lunch or Dead Ringers (the absolute worst date movie ever made), Cronenberg is at least consistent in that his films are always very challenging, psychologically speaking. He is King of All Head Games.

Carl Jung: Sometimes you have to do something unforgivable... just to be able to go on living.

Michael Fassbender is Jung, and like the director, he could have gone deeper into Jung's more mystical, and some would say superstitious, theories, but presented more of a good doctor tempted by his attractive, but disturbed patient vibe. He wants to do the right thing, but how can you resist when you have Kiera Knightly throwing herself at you, and the Dangerous Method of therapy she begs for is the only thing that seems to provide her with relief?

Sabina Spielrein: [to Jung] I want you to punish me.

Kiera Knightly gives a very enthusiastic performance as Sabina Spielrein, but at first it almost went off the rails. Her character is Jung's patient, then Freud's patient, then she goes on to be a docter herself. She chewed the scenery a bit, but later, when she herself was a physician wanting to use what she had learned to cure other unfortunate souls, her performance was much better controlled and believable. She is also very easy on the eyes, and I get a sense that her career is on the verge of blowing up, big time. Same for Fassbender, who has nothing to be ashamed of, and was also in the much anticipated Prometheus.

Also believable was Sarah Gadon as Jung's lovely wife, Emma, who not only provided him with a lovely family, but was also very rich, which gave the Jung doctor the luxury of pursuing his more esoteric objectives, such as Synchronicity, the Collective Subconscious, cultural and mythical archetypes, and the ancient wisdom unearthed in the I Ching, the Book of Changes. Another seminal character was Otto Gross, played by Vincent Cassel, who was a renegade doctor wanting to push the Dangerous Methods envelope even further, scoffing at the ethics forbidding patient doctor relations.

Viggo Mortensen, as Freud, was as usual brilliant. Though Siggy tried to pass himself off as above it all, he was just as much in thrall to his libido as the rest of us. The fact that he had repressed his desires didn't mean they weren't still exerting their influence. I think that he said things like ""sometimes a cigar is just a cigar"" in order to give him a little closet to hide inside. He wasn't fooling anyone, and his frustrated need to be some kind of surrogate father figure for Jung was as much of a reason for their rift as any. Furthermore, some of his theories were just wrong, and he could have benefited immensely from Jung's ideas.

Sigmund Freud: Experiences like this, however painful, are necessary and inevitable; without them, how can we know life?

The Bottom Line is that A Dangerous Method could have delved a little deeper, but the excellent cast and sure footed direction made for a most entertaining film--one that would make a much better date movie than Dead Ringers. There are a few steamy risqu&eacute; scenes, but most of it is left up to the imagination, and there are also some tantalizing glimpses of great ideas and psychological insights, but these are, alas, also left mostly to the imagination.",1341187200,2,3826,4.741353383458646

5013200,3,B006PTL1QM,"The problem with this as a movie, is you keep waiting for something dramatic to happen.  Something that will involve you, the viewer.  A patient who is a borderline psychotic (not neurotic as is her diagnosis in the film), is hardly a dramatic revelation.  Nor is it eye opening for a doctor to have a sexual relationship with his patient, even in turn of the century Vienna or Switzerland.  The director has Keira Knightley over play the psychotic patient role to the point of being stereotypical and a distraction. You almost want to say ""enough, already!  Nor does the director have her (in the end of the film) seem ""cured"" as she states.  She always displays a nervous tick, even in her final scene with Jung.

As psychoanalytical history, the break between Freud and Jung came when Jung switched from the individual patient, to the whole of humanity as the patient, and saw ""archetypes"".  Today, Jung is a footnote in the history of psychoanalysis, and Jungian therapists are rapidly diminishing.  Freud's approach is still the most favored of those who do ""talk therapy"".

And those damn cigars gave Freud cancer of the jaw, forcing its removal.  Anna Freud said (after her father's death) that he wished he never smoked, and concluded that it was a neurotic habit with possible oral fixations to his being weened too soon.

Unless you're deep into Jung and Freud and enjoy scene upon scene of deep discussions about your repressed sexuality, this movie isn't for you.  Kiera Knightley's performance of a disturbed woman who from childhood gets off sexually from physical abuse, is over the top.  As some reviewers pointed out, she painfully overplays the part trying to look quite mad, which only brings you to the brink of madness watching her physical contortions.  The remainder of the movie deserves deep attention to understand the musings of the two psychiatry giants of the past.  The timeline jumps from one thing to the other a bit disjointed and actually in parts makes no sense whatsoever, such as Freud having what appeared to be a stroke, and then in the next scene is perfectly fine.

The debate is still on if Jung became a quack. Any Freudian would say he did, but there may be people out there that had successful treatment with Jung's methods so it is hard for a layman like me to make the call.

5013209,3,B006PTL1QM,"Period drama about early 1900s in Switzerland and Austria.  Freud is at the peak of his fame, practicing in Vienna.  His young follower Carl Jung works in psychiatric hospital in Switzerland and Freud considers him a golden boy and potential successor in a brand new way of psychoanalysis.  One day, Jung admits new patient, who is very receptive, very intelligent and yes, very neurotic.  In the course of him treating her, Jung falls for her.

Cast of actors provides background in what is was to live in early 1900s just before the WWI.  There is also an aspect of class difference between Freud and Jung.  Freud is a self made man, pioneer of he new way of treating patients; he is pragmatic and intellectually sharp but also unforgiving.  Jung on the other hand is married to a wealthy woman and treats his practice as a hobby that over time becomes mix of scientific research and mysticism. Such apprach unlimately causes Freud and Jung ot part their ways on both personal and professional level.  Heavy in dialogue between all three characters, movie explores the relationship between all three of them, the infatuation Jung has for his young patient Sabina who herself trains to become a doctor and his intimate relationship with her in which by the end of affair there is a complete role reversal between the two.  Jung looses control of his emotions, purpose and life that plunges him into a nervous breakdown, while Sabina earns her medical degree, marries and moved to Russia where with her husband she trains young doctors interested in pursuing their career in psychotherapy.

5013212,4,B006PTL1QM,"There's a distant clinical feeling to this piece that keeps the audience at arm's length and therefore might work against it on some level. The focus is upon Dr. Sigmund Freud (played by Viggo Mortensen) and Dr. Carl Jung (played by Michael Fassbender) shortly before World War I takes place and Jung is helping a disturbed patient named Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightly) who later becomes his lover for experimental sexual pleasures and even later a psychotherapist with her own views. There seems to be a strong push and pull feel between rationalistic psychology of Freud and intuitive psychology of Jung with some subdued conflict between the two personalities. On the whole it's an interesting look at three historical people back in the day but I've heard there are some historical inaccuracies or improper delivery of certain theories. An end narration of what happened to each of these three people follows at the end of the picture.

It is a story mostly about Carl Jung's tumultuous relationship with Sabina Spielrein, with Freud as a secondary, albeit important figure in the film.  Vincent Cassel almost steals the show as the randy Otto Gross, who essentially pushes Jung into a relationship with Spielrein by encouraging him to follow his emotions.  This is more a dramatic vehicle than it is a study of psychoanalysis, probably more influenced by the method acting of Stanislavsky than it was the so-called ""dangerous method"" of Freud. As such, the acting is impeccable.  Viggo Mortensen gives a wonderfully deft touch to Freud, Michael Fassbender captures the repressed emotional state of Jung perfectly, and Keira Knightley gives a stand-out performance as Sabina Spielrein.

As the film winds all too quickly to an end on the eve of World War I, it leaves you begging for more.

What I liked most is that Cronenberg avoided reducing his historic figures to caricatures.  He reveals them to be the complicated individuals that they were, and that we can't hope to understand them.  What we can do is enjoy this little slice of their lives, as they intersected in early 20th century Europe.  Yet, Cronenberg touches on so many aspects on Freud's and Jung's psychoanalytical views, including dreams, as they sail to America together.  He provides a fascinating portrait of Sabina Spielrein, who was brought to Jung on the verge of complete emotional collapse. Through his calm counseling and eventually through their love affair would become a leading psychoanalyst herself, with the further tutelage of Freud. This was a tumultuous time with the advent not only of modern thinking that would  reshape science and the arts, but also of modern war, which would turn Europe on its end in World War I, alluded to by Jung's dream at the end of the film.

This is a superb story about a very difficult subject,  handled with sensitivity and intelligence. This will really mean a lot to those who are familiar with Freud's theory and how he and Jung collaborated and then split some seven years later before the beginning of WW1.

This is the type of movie that makes you think and if you are familiar with the history of psychoanalysis, this is about as good as it gets. Freud and some of the people that he worked with were among the greatest thinkers ever. Jung, Adler, Otto Rank are in that group. Some of the occurrences presented are almost exactly as I remember reading about them many years ago. This is a classic confrontation between an analytical thinker (Freud) and a Intuitive thinker (Jung), both giants of intellect, but very human. These men were scientists, trying to dissect and understand the nature of reality and the essence of raw experience without psychic defenses or repressions. It could have destroyed them. Freud had more than one ""fainting spell"" and Jung had a nervous breakdown. It was indeed a ""Dangerous Method"".

An important female character enters the picture but I'm not going to give more away about this movie.  I will say this, she may have understood everything, better than Freud or Jung.

You'd think that Keira Knightly, Michael Fassbender and Viggo Mortensen could generate some sparks and venerable cinema.  Keira Knightly speaks in an atrocious Russian accent and she fades in and out of the accent.  Just this alone is cringe-worthy.

I don't know your impression of this genre of movie (it has become a genre in my mind), but it seems that whenever a period piece about the 1800's is made, some how it has to have kink or sexually repressed characters or the movie will not be produced.

I thought the acting was good by all three actors, in particular Kira Knightly. Mortensen was very convincing an older Freud (who was much older than himself). The sets, props and costumes were authentic and the cinematography was good.

The film adaptation was to feature Julia Roberts but as time went on, Chris Hampton's play would be the first to be done but as time had passed and scheduling conflicts came in the way, by 2010, a film would be made and would star Viggo Mortensen (""The Lord of the Rings"" films, ""The Road"", ""A History of Violence""), Michael Fassbender (""Inglorious Basterds"", ""300', ""X-Men: First Class""), Keira Knightley (""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films, ""Pride & Prejudice"") and Vincent Cassel (""Black Swan"", ""Shrek"", ""La Haine"").

And now, ""A Dangerous Mind"" will be released on Blu-ray and DVD in March 2012 courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""A Dangerous Method"" is presented in 1:85:1 anamorphic widescreen and audio in English 5.1 Dolby Digital. Before I continue, it's important to note that this film will be released on Blu-ray, so if you want the best picture and audio quality, I recommend watching it on HD.

With that being said, ""A Dangerous Method"" is a film that utilizes a lot of outdoor scenes and locations.  So, there are time that we see vibrant colors and overall lighting was good and while watching the film, I admit that in my mind, I was thinking how awesome a lot of these scenes would look in HD.  And along with the wonderful location shots and cinematography, the film features beautiful costume design and also set design as well.  As for the picture quality of DVD, overall picture quality is good but once again, if you want the detail and clarity, go for the Blu-ray version.

As for audio, dialogue is clear and there are moments where ambiance such as Sabina being taken to the mental hospital, you can hear the sounds of her kicking things around inside the carriage through the surround channels.  But the film is primarily a center and front-channel driven film.

The music from Howard Shore is quite impressive and Richard Wagner's ""Sigfried Idyll"" performed by Lang Lang and arranged by Howard Shore is absolutely beautiful.  One again, this is a beautiful soundtrack that would probably sound much better via lossless on Blu-ray but on DVD, overall dialogue and audio is clear with no problems that I can see or hear.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""A Dangerous Method"" comes with the following special features:

  Commentary with Director David Cronenberg - Featuring an in-depth audio commentary from Director David Cronenberg.
  The Making of A Dangerous Method - (7:41) Director David Cronenberg and the cast talk about working on the film.
  AFI's Harold Lloyd Master Seminar with David Cronenberg - (31:21) AFI interviews director David Cronenberg about how he came to direct ""A Dangerous Method"", how the film came to be and the making of the film.
  Theatrical Trailer - (1:56) The theatrical trailer for ""A Dangerous Method"".

JUDGMENT CALL:

""A Dangerous Method"" is an intriguing form of fiction based on the lives of Carl Jung, Sigmund Freud and Sabina Spielrein.

For anyone who has studied psychiatry or are familiar with the people featured in the film, reading into the lives of Carl Jung and Sabina Spielrein seems like an emotional and intellectual drama.  And it doesn't surprise me that a film was made on them.

For Carl Jung, so far it has been a few who have asserted that Jung and Spielrein have had a sexual relationship.  Afterall, it is known that Carl Jung had a long-time affair with Toni Wolff, a Swiss analyst who was also a patient of Carl Jung and had a relationship with his wife and Wolff simultaneously.  While with Sabina Spielrein, there have been books since 1980 written about the relationship between Jung and Spielrein from 1904-1910 and that he did constitute an ethical breach of doctor-patient boundary while treating Spielrein.

In 1994, letters and diaries were found in the Claparede archive in Geneva and these letters show that their relationship was non-sexual but more of a therapeutic nature.

Needless to say, no one will ever know the truth if these two individuals did have a sexual relationship but we do know that Carl Jung did have an impact in the life of Sabina Spielrein.  We do know that Carl Jung contacted Sigmund Freud for advice in treating Sabina and that moment of time, both Jung and Freud became intellectual confidants.

As for the rift that drove them apart, we know that Sabina had nothing to do with it, but it was two men with two different theories and both men being well-known in their field and doing all they can to have supporters of their ideas, the clash between both men were inevitable.

So, while watching ""A Dangerous Method"", I did find Christopher Hampton's screenplay based on John Kerr's novel to be an intriguing take on this long-rumored interaction but also what caused the rift between Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud.

The more you research Carl Jung, especially with the release of ""The Red Book"" in 2009 (a manuscript that he written right after his falling out with Jeung and was forbidden for public viewing by his family until a family heir decided to publish it a few years ago) which you realize that Jung was man who had dreams, an active imagination one would say and these were further explored in his book.

And as for his relationships with his patients, while Tony Wolff was known to be his mistress, Sabina to be rumored as a woman he had an affair with for years, I did find it quite intriguing of how the storyline incorporated Otto Gross, who was a disciple of Sigmund Freud but treated by Carl Jung and is known as the founding grandfather of 20th Century Counterculture.  A free spirited manic depressive who was an extrovert addicted to sex.  Was it Otto Gross that helped lead Jung astray?  I found that intriguing.

I'm not a Freud or Jung erudite, but I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed the performances by Viggo Mortensen, Michael Fassbender and Keira Knightley are fantastic.  How exact it is to their original counterparts, I don't know.  But Keira Knightley did a wonderful job in portraying a hysterical woman.  It's a performance that I have never seen by Knightley and in fact, whenever she did go into hysterics, I was freaked out a little as she would do this elongating of her jaw.  Needless to say, it was visually affective in portraying the character.

Mortensen's Sigmund Freud was rather well-done.  Very stoic and serious, while Fassbender's performance of Carl Jung was very good, but it made me wonder if an intellectual like Jung was also a suave ladies man?  I felt that maybe he looked too cool, but then again, maybe Carl Jung was a classy, cool, suave intellectual.

The cinematography by Peter Suschitzky (""Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"", ""Eastern Promises"", ""A History of Violence"") was absolutely beautiful and vibrant and it helps to have a talented crew providing wonderful costume and set design as well. Also, I give credit to Howard Shore for providing beautiful, emotional, chaotic music to support what we see onscreen.

As for the DVD, fans of David Cronenberg will enjoy his AFI interview but also his audio commentary which he really delves into the characters and his interested in doing a film about Freud.

But as I did enjoy the performances, the cinematography and music, I do have a problem with the film's storyline overall.

Once again, this film is fiction based on assertions that Sabina Spielrein and Carl Jung had a sexual relationship.  But if letters were found to show that it was factual, I wouldn't be surprised because we know that Jung had an affair and a relationship with Tony Wolff, a former patient of his and a future analyst.

But I enjoyed the film for giving attention to Sabina Speilrein, as she was the first person to introduce the idea of death instincts (best known for her published work ""Destruction as the Cause of Coming into Being""), a concept that Sigmund Freud would incorporate into his own theory.  She was also known to introduce psychoanalysis to Russia and was an inspiration to future psychoanalysts, including Swiss developmental psychologist Jean Piaget.

Always known as a footnote in Sigmund Freud's book and considered as a ""forgotten pioneer of psychoanalysis"", unfortunately Sabina Speilrein's life in reality was cut short and her two children were killed by a German SS Death Squad.  But her contributions as a psychoanalysis should have been shown.  This woman's work have been forgotten and now that she has been brought back to the masses, she is not seen for her accomplishments but her sadistic needs.

It is known that Spielrein had wrote about masochism and the sadistic component of sexual drive as a ""destructive drive"" but does it mean she was a woman who loved to be spanked by Carl Jung?  Those scenes I found a bit worrisome as people will see her more as Carl Jung's sexual exploit rather than her contributions as a psychoanalyst.

Overall, ""A Dangerous Method"" is an exploitative, sensational and intriguing take on Carl-Gustav Jung and Sabina Spielrein, and Jung's his split with his intellectual confidant Sigmund Freud, but I do admit that I found the treatment of Sabina Speilrein's life to be troubling and misleading. It's bad enough that her career as a psychoanalysis was never recognized (possibly because in that era she was a woman in man's world and not taken seriously by her peers) but to summarize her life as a character that is always craving for attention and wanting to be spanked, I found it the most unfortunate.  And like Freud's footnote to credit her career, Cronenberg also ends with a title of Spielrein's accomplishments and tragic death.

For so long, many have hoped for Speilrein to be known for her work and no longer be ""forgotten"".  Unfortunately, ""A Dangerous Method"" is a film that no only hurts her reputation and paints nothing more but a hysterical love toy but also is a film that is possibly quite damaging to the legacy of Carl Jung.

While ""A Dangerous Method"" does make for intriguing cinema. I do hope that viewers know to discern that this is not a film based on fact, but a fictional tale.",1335571200,4,10369,4.837393767705382

Film Review: A Dangerous Method--A Woman's Perspective
Published on January 24, 2012 by Ilene A. Serlin , Ph. D. in Make Your Life a Blessing
There are many ways to review this film, both professional and personal. Let me start with the personal first, since I have strong feelings about it.

For many years, I have been intrigued by Sabina Spielrein, a woman pioneer of psychoanalysis. My own life, though nothing like hers, has led me into adventures with exotic locations, studies, or high-power, charismatic men. Consequently, I have maintained an informal and formal fascination with women like Sabina Spielrein and questions about their lives; I attended a seminar on her at the Jung Institute, read A Secret Symmetry: Sabina Spielrein Between Freud and Jung, and A Most Dangerous Method, one of her articles, designed and taught a course on Women and Narrative, and published articles: ""The Anne Sexton Complex"", ""A Tribute to Laura Perls"", ""Dancing Women's Freedom: the Story of Isadora Duncan"", and tributes to other women in psychology and the arts. I am a Fellow of the Society for Women in Psychology (Div. 35) of the American Psychological Association. The women in my reading list included biographies of women who were muses to famous men (Rodin, Picasso), wives of famous men (the Beat poets, Scott Fitzgerald). Most of these women either self-destructed (Marilyn Monroe) or were hospitalized by their husbands (T.S. Eliot). The women who survived were writers who advocated having a ""room of one's own"" and an ""independent income"" (Virginia Woolf, Vita Sackville-West), left a man's world (Carolyn Heilbrun left Columbia), capitalized on their experiences (Francoise Gilot), or were lesbian or bisexual (Diane diPrima). In other words, sex between men and women can be a powerful drug-profound, uplifting, creative and destructive.

Next, since I did my pre-doctoral internship at the C. G. Jung Institute and taught at the institute in Zurich, I have been also fascinated by the personality and legends around Carl Jung. Being involved and interested in cases of erotic countertransference (as an analysand and a supervisor), I read Jungian analyst Robert Stein's Incest and Human Love, and consulted with Mario Jacoby; in short, the boundary issues among Jungian psychoanalysts were (in)famous and fairly widespread, often with elaborate rationalizations for why boundary crossing was permissible. I also heard more stories about how both male and female lay analysts were trained by being in analysis with Jung (or Freud) and one of the inner circle; incest was part of the excitement. I found the book, Jung's Circle of Women: The Valkyries. Finally, I met with Aniela Jaffe, Jung's personal secretary whom, legend had it, was one of the few heterosexual women who had not slept with Jung.

Aniela Jaffe, blind and almost 90 years old at the time, took my hand, pronounced it strong, and advised me to ""have the courage to lead an unconventional life."" She told me that she tried marriage for 6 years, found it not for her, and preferred to live like a graduate student in a simple, book-lined apartment in Zurich. I identified with her-she, a well-educated Jewish upper middle-class woman from Berlin; me, a well-educated Jewish woman from New York (Russian heritage), Sabina Spielrein, a well-educated Jewish Russian woman living in Zurich and Vienna, and Toni Wolff, Jung's next long-time mistress, a Jewish or half-Jewish former patient and originator of some of his theories of the occult.

An unconventional life or marriage? This is one question that has haunted me for a long time. My role models, including Simone de Beauvoir, said that it made women property and advocated personal and professional liberation. Modern women ask these questions, some of which I reviewed for PsycCritiques covering Elizabeth Gilbert's Committed: A Skeptic Makes Peace with Marriage.

In her real life, Sabina Spielrein, as she got mentally stronger, thought that she should have her own man and family. She married a fellow Russian Jewish medical student, had two children, but was reportedly soon bored. She left Vienna and moved back to Rostov-on-Don with her family. Although she accomplished much--she was responsible for the contact and collaboration between Jung and Freud and did try to keep them together, she originated theories about the death instinct and wrote about 30 articles, she trained the early generation of psychoanalysts in Russia-her life was cut short in 1941 when she was killed by the Nazis.

Would it have been better to remain in Vienna amidst the creative ferment? Would she have kept productive and did she need the madness/edginess/competition to create? Is love hotter when it is forbidden and secret? As Spielrein wrote in her own diary (February 22, 1912):

 No ashes, no coal can burn with such glow 'as a secretive love 'of which no one must know.

Kay Jamison, herself a sufferer of bipolar disorder, tackled this question in Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament. In her earlier writings, she came down on the side of sobriety; creativity is not helped by manic-depressive disorders and medication is in order. In her later writings, she did acknowledge the contribution of manic-depressive illness to creativity. Anne Sexton also tried to have a normal 1950s suburban married life to keep herself grounded, became bored and left--but committed suicide anyway. So did Sylvia Plath.

What is a talented woman to do?

One could say that in Victorian times, women suffered from repression, and showed classical symptoms of hysteria. However, the treatment of choice for them might have been an independent income and a job; Freud's Anna O., who walked out of his office, went on to become a well-known social worker. Ellen West, who was expertly diagnosed and phenomenologically described by Binswanger, died anyway; but Kim Chernin, a feminist psychologist, re-analyzed the case by prescribing a job and independence for Ellen West.

These are some of the questions raised for me once again by seeing the film. I don't think there are easy answers, and certainly we are no longer in Victorian times; the issues were particular to those times, but also universal and applicable to women today.

Some quick comments about the film itself: I thought it was just OK. First, Jung was a big, hearty charismatic man; in the film, he was rather sensitive and effete. Second, Freud was powerful and deep; in the film, I thought he was just dark and somewhat creepy. Third, Sabina Spielrein was a strong woman; in the film, Kira Knightley over-acted her symptoms and desperation. Emma Jung was large and strong, not the delicate beauty in the film. None of the characters in the film, although they made appropriate gestures and conversation, touched me. Finally, the explicit sexual scenes left me puzzled. I thought that it was never confirmed whether their relationship was ""consummated"" and wondered how such liberties could be taken.

In short, this film is psychologically rich, intriguing, and leaves the viewer with more questions than answers.

5013227,1,B006PTL1QM,Knightly just screams the entire film. Her accent is also pretty crap. I want my $1.99 and one hour and 40 minutes back.,1335052800,6,120,4.260869565217392
5013228,4,B006PTL1QM,"If director David Cronenberg's early films like Videodrome and The Fly were concerned about ""the new flesh"", then his most recent efforts have been fascinated with ""the new mind.""  It might be the drug addled world of Naked Lunch or the disturbed mind of Spider or the amoral world of Eastern Promises, but the director has gone from visceral horror into more intellectually disturbing terrain.

And ""A Dangerous Method"" fits this world view quite well.  I was leery of seeing this film since it generated very mixed reviews, with some people loving it and others finding it tedious.  I liked it a lot and think the problem is that this is really two films.  On the surface everything is Victorian prim and proper.  Except for some naughty spanking scenes, the film has few Cronenbergian flourishes.

But go one level deeper and follow what everyone is talking about and things get more disturbing.  When Carl Jung uses Freud's experimental ""talking method"" on a new female patient Sabrina Spielrein, we get into a world of sexual repression, adulterous affairs, mysticism versus hedonism, and hints of European Anti-Semitism on the eve of World War II.  There may also be an intellectual menage a trois going on here - with Jung as ego rebelling against superego father figure in Freud and Spielrein as id (and Vincent Cassel's hedonistic Otto Gross could serve as Libido, I guess).

Cerebral and complex, and let's be honest, dialogue heavy in quite a few places, this is not an action packed film.  But it is an intellectually challenging and provocative multi-level film, with superb cinematography and fine performances by all the leads.

I must admit I am a fan of director Cronenberg - but I am not blind to his faults.  He can be very distant and aloof as a director - M Butterfly was definitely not his best effort and Spider left me cold.  I found Dangerous Method challenging and involving from start to finish.  In his early film Scanners, Cronenberg had a famous scene where a human head literally explodes.  Cronenberg is still there in your head, just messing with it in an entirely new way.",1334966400,4,2106,4.8245125348189415
5013229,4,B006PTL1QM,"As a person who has for all of my career been interested in Psychoanalysis, I really enjoyed this movie. I read other reviews and lay people are not all that impressed it seems. They thought Keira Knightly's acting was a bit ""over the top"" in the beginning. I assure them it was not  - I have seen people just like that in mental hospitals - and people who were even worse. The Blu ray as usual was well done - wow just great for the home cinema. If anything I thought Viggo Mortenson was a bit understated, but then he usually is - his performance in Lord of the Rings was very laid back, and I was hoping for a bit more pizazz. He maybe thought Freud was ultra conservative - or at least had to appear so - maybe he was spot on, difficult to tell. If Jung was like that he was not as nice as I had hoped. Also I thought Mrs Jung a bit insipid. Keira Knightly really shone and was a treat to watch.",1334707200,3,899,4.022346368715084
5013230,3,B006PTL1QM,"A very dialogue heavy film, which drags on quite a bit and there really are no characters to latch on to.",1334620800,,105,4.0476190476190474
5013231,3,B006PTL1QM,"There have been accusations heaped upon `A Dangerous Method'; that it is too kinky.  It's not.  There have been accusations on Keira's performance; that it is too over the top.  It's not.  No, the kinky nature of the film is far tamer than the initial trailer and or mere synopsis would have you believe, and all of Miss Knightley's jaw jutting theatrics fit perfectly in tone with her character; the real life Sabina Spielrein and thus feel naturalized and appropriate.

Sadly, debunking these accusations doesn't make `A Dangerous Method' any better of a film.

David Cronenberg is a director I have a hard time with.  He's just not as consistent as I'd like him to be.  I loved his 80's work, but I find that a lot of his more acclaimed recent fare has been stilted for me, rather bland and just not entirely thought through.  `A Dangerous Method' suffers from that.  The film just hangs there, without much to make it truly engrossing or compelling, and this is a shock when you consider the dynamics involved here.  This should have been a ravishing tale, yet it just feels so stagnant.  Even the kinky sex scenes feel restrained in a way that doesn't add to the sophistication of the picture (this period genre is far different that standard Cronenberg fare, and thus I assume he was shooting for Oscar here) but instead give it a dull varnish.

Fassbender delivers his weakest performance of the year, yet Mortensen is gold and Knightley proves yet again that the haters can hate all they want, but she is a great actress.

Still, `A Dangerous Method' is missing that spark.  The costumes are good, the sets are compelling and the overall ensemble (Sarah Gadon and Vincent Cassel are also sublime) is fantastic, but Cronenberg drops the ball here.  It's like he tried too hard to shy so far away from his signature style that he became a poor man's Merchant Ivory.  I love Merchant Ivory films (do I ever), but Cronenberg is not suited for this genre.

He really should have revved this up some, for narrowing down his signature chaos to a theme this organic could have led to a stunning film.",1334534400,,2100,4.644986449864499
5013232,5,B006PTL1QM,"An interesting and thought-provoking film. Five stars, but I have some minor reservations. Lets psychoanalyze this:

1] Jung. While certainly a womanizer, Carl Jung was quite mainstream. Though he and his patient Sabina Speilrein were lovers, Jung didn't spank her in the bedroom with his belt. Not even for medicinal purposes. Did this come from the director's fertile imagination or his suppressed desires?

2] Freud. It was bold, but silly to cast Aragon of ""The Lord of the Rings"" (Viggo Mortensen) as Sigmund Freud. This didn't pay off, because Viking-looking VIggo (Isn't he Danish?) looks more like Jung than Freud. Freud was 5' 7'"" (170 cm), while Viggo is six feet-tall. Details are important. While Viggo acts well, he doesn't look believable. But perhaps Freud himself wouldn't have mind it?

3] Frau Spielrein. Making ""Pirates of the Caribbean's"" Keira Knightly into Sabina Spielrein didn't quite work either in my view. Sabina was attractive to Jung because she was (apart from being neurotic) very rich, very bright and very exotic. She was a Russian. She came from Rostov-on-Don, heiress to the fortune of a Russian-Jewish merchant. She spoke German with a Russian accent. Correct me if I am wrong, but Keira doesn't fit this profile, although she did best she could with her West London accent.

Perhaps I am nitpicking. Overall, the film is good and, in cinematographic terms, good-looking. The music-score is nice. While casting is overall suspicious, Vincent Cassel is brilliant as Otto Gross, a deranged over-sexed psychoanalyst. Jung's wife is also well cast. The costumes are tremendous; the atmosphere of the times is well reproduced. I highly recommend it to everyone interested in the history of psychoanalysis and films for grown-ups.

P.S. The main argument between Jung and Freud perhaps should have been better explained in the film: it was about nature of the libido. Freud conceived of the libido as a quantitative (or ""economic"") concept: it is an energy which can increase or decrease, and which can be displaced. Freud insisted on the sexual nature of the energy, and he maintained a dualism in which the libido is opposed to another (non-sexual) form of energy. Jung opposed this dualism, positing a single form of life-energy, which is neutral in character. I believe Freud was nearer the truth: at least he stayed scientific, while Jung descended into the alchemy.",1334534400,5,2401,5.130434782608695
5013233,1,B006PTL1QM,"I couldn't wait to see this movie and expected it to be great.  I love Cronenberg's work especially History of Violence, and I adore Viggo.  They usually make a strong team together...but not this time.

Here are my pros/cons.

PROS:
- Viggo and Michael both acted well
- Nice history lesson

CONS:
- I agree with some of the reviews about Keira Knightly's severe overacting.  It was painful to watch. A character that is very mentally disturbed does not necessarily have to talk all weird and make seizure like motions.
- I understand psychoanalysis involves talking, but the movie has a length, and within that length, it needs to engage the viewer.  The talking and conversations were so excessive that I lost interest.  Perhaps this was intentional so that the viewer was part of the psychoanalysis process?  Extremely boring unless you put in A LOT of effort to really pay attention to every word being said

Is it worth renting/borrowing?  No.  Would I recommend to others?  Only if they want to fall asleep.",1334448000,11,1014,4.791907514450867
5013234,2,B006PTL1QM,"""A Dangerous Method"" is a beautiful film to look at, a handsome production design for the period, glorious Vienna landscapes all shot wonderfully on location by cinematographer Peter Suchitzky. I thought I would get that out of the way because my kind words must stop at this point. ""A Dangerous Method"", the new film from the talented David Cronenberg, isn't the beauty of a movie that it looks.

Coming from the usually inspired Cronenberg, who since the turn of the new millennium has been on a roll much the same way he had been on at the dawn of his career in the late 70's and early to mid 80's, re-teaming with his go to star Viggo Mortenson, playing Freud and is about the only actor who comes across well here, and a subject with great cinematic potential, it comes as a down right shock for it to end up as such an inferior piece of work. It is hard to pin point just where this train skidded off it's railing, because as I've already pointed out, it looks great. Somehow I feel much of the problem lies in the casting, otherwise great actors, Keira Knightley overacts her character's mannerisms and thick, and I do mean icky thick, Russian accent. Michael Fassbender, who I predict will become a huge star and is already a fine actor, can't give his Carl Jung any electricity to the point of tedium, watching him you feel as though you would rather watch anything else, he is the cinematic equivalent of paint drying in slow splotches. Still, the major fault of the picture, I think, must be laid at Cronenberg's feet, even though he tackles themes close to him and his other films, he just seems unable to work up much enthusiasm for the subject mater, this is something new, dull Cronenberg.

Adapted by Christopher Hampton from his stage play, unseen by me, working with rich material that unfortunately goes nowhere. I do not doubt a fascinating story could and should be told in film about Carl Jung and Siegmund Freud and the dawning of psychoanalysis, but ""A Dangerous Method"" seems more interested in the inner desires and illicit affairs of Carl Jung, rather than the relationship with Freud or the pursuit of psychoanalysis. Frankly, I do not care about his love life, in fact if Knightley's character, Sabine, had been dropped from the story, I think we would have already had a vast improvement. The movie runs only ninety-nine minutes, but it feels twice as long, a movie can anger me, frustrate me, offend me even, but it must never bore me.",1334361600,4,2466,4.627853881278539
5013235,3,B006PTL1QM,"The reviews seem to be focused on Jung and Freud. Whereas Sabina appears to be the star ...as she evolved both their theories - as an active recipient of Jung's psychoanalysis and a participant in his work.  Her 'erotic' interaction with Jung seemed a bit over the top - of course it did spice up the movie.  It would have been interesting to have more details of the conversations between Jung and Freud, but the movie paradigm typically limits us to under 2 hours.",1334275200,,466,4.535714285714286
5013236,4,B006PTL1QM,"I think this film was rather kind to the splintered relationship of Freud and Jung. It was also kind about Freud's massive and mysogonistic ego he supposedly had in real life. Although, most male physicians at that time could be described as the same, so I suppose Siggy was not abnormal, he was just very famous and jewish and some older history books do not flatter him. He did earn his fame, but most of his notable first patients were females suffering from ""hysteria."" Later on he was called out from those early cases as not proven ""cured"" because he didn't comply with the standard scientific technics by using several other variables, like placebos, to prove it was his technic that cured. It was also anti-semitism and intellectual jealousy that literally declared war within this new field during and after WWI. He had great fame as being the father of psychoanalysis during his lifetime and he used it for doing good. Freud contributed so much and so did Jung. Yet, Freud is still the contender. Viggo is a wonderful actor and I think he did something excellent here with his role as Freud. His quiet way of questioning, suggesting, active listening and his fatherly chuckles, especially the one he delivers while reading the scathing letter from Jung towards the end of the film. Knightly, held nothing back in her performance as Sabina Spielrein. A sexually frustrated hysteric that finds freedom and eventually her own fame as a child psychologist. Forced to strip naked as a young girl and through spankings and humiliation from her father, she developed sexually in a neurotic and repressive way that contradicted with church, society  and medicine at that time. She is a patient of Jung, and because of her high intelligence from a university education in medicine, is allowed to participate in some experiments. Vincent Casteel makes a brief, yet compelling performance as the unbalanced, psychoanalyst Otto Gross, needing treatment for himself. Otto is a referral patient from Freud sent to Jung for treatment by the demands of Otto's father. Jung tells him he heard he helped a patient commit suicide. Otto offhandedly responds that she was suicidal and he merely told her how to do it without botching it and gave her the option of becoming his lover. He follows up with a resigned ""she opted for both."" Casteel plays this role of Otto, with such a beautiful contradiction of reckless indifference and human grace. He is wonderful in the scenes with Michael Fassbende, in shocking and baffling him with his philosophy, and explaining Freud's theory of transference between physcian and patient in a wicked way. He looked like lucifer sitting outside in that garden enjoying his cigarette, with that slight grin on his face, and taking control over the conversation between himself and Jung. I loved him! Casteel could have played the part of a shorter  Jung, but we would have missed him as that poor, deranged physician and his shenanigans. Jung starts to give in to the transference and experiments with Spielrein, that crosses boundaries. When news leaks out about Jung's affair with her, he breaks it off and asks Freud to help soften the blow by writing to her. This brings about some dramatic moments between Jung and Spielrein where Spielrein wields some power to get justice or payback, however you want to see it. Both come out with gain at the end of the film, but in real life, Spielrein was later murdered by Nazis back in Russia during WWII and Jung lived a long, full life.
This intervention from Freud eventually leads to her working for him and becoming a child psychologist. Freud's refusal to give any credence to Jung's theories into mysticism is the wedge that breaks their working relationship apart. Fassbende is excellent with Knightly as he restrains and gives tension from himself at the right moments that brighten Knightly's performance...he does this really well with all of the actors. I love his sober restraint when Knightly is helping him on an experiment with the actress Sarah Godon playing his wife. His coldness allowed Godon's subtle awkwardness feel more intense, without Godon having to over due it. The scene with Viggo in Freud's study, when wood is snapping from the bookcases and  Fassbende is in a lather, telling Viggo he knew it would happen and predicted the second one snapping, and goes on about mysticism all agitated, while Viggo's reaction is fatherly as he scoffs at it. Viggo is a tad condicending to him, but not cruel in his reaction. Yes, this film plays with history, but I haven't seen a feature film about historical figures be any where in the ballpark when it comes to accuracy. This is a good one if you've ever had to study a little bit of Freud and Jung a long time ago, and don't mind a little salt in your sugar. It's a fun movie, not a documentary.",1334188800,2,4837,4.8393719806763285

Dr. Jung is married, but has an affair with his new patient. The affair becomes public, damaging the doctor's reputation. The woman eventually becomes a mental health practitioner in her own right. This one was interesting, with a look at how a doctor can put his family life and professional reputation in peril by engaging in an inappropriate relationship with a patient.

5013238,2,B006PTL1QM,"I was quite underwhelmed by ""A Dangerous Method"".  I am firmly of the view that the fame attaching to the film has preceded it.  I expected more and came away disappointed.

The movie covers the overlapping in the lives of the two of the 20th century's great minds, Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung.  The cause of their meeting was, ostensibly, one of Jung's patients, a wealthy Russian Jewess, Sabrina Spielrein.  She comes to Jung in an extremely distressed state after having been institutionalised.  It is here that the acting is first rate.  Keira Knightly plays Spielrein and is extremely plausible.  It is not an easy task to convince the audience of madness.  Knightly succeeds totally.

In the course of her sessions with Jung, the two become sexually involved.  This is, of course, contrary to accepted protocols.  Jung is aware of this and is deeply conflicted. The fact that his wife is pregnant at the time only serves to heighten the emotional conflict that is running through Jung.  Freud is also unhappy with his behaviour.

The essence of the film is the interplay of these three main characters.  Unfortunately, the drama comes to no great heights.  It seems to end abruptly and the viewer is left feeling somewhat cheated.  This is a pity.  The film had more to offer.  It had an excellent cast with a fascinating subject to explore.",1333929600,2,1347,4.8034934497816595
5013239,1,B006PTL1QM,"I have never thought of Kiera Knightly as an especially talented actress, but her overacting in this movie put her even lower in my estimation. Her overacting was definitely one of the contributing factors to ruining the movie for me.  Her bodily contortions and over-the-top facial expressions during the first third of the movie were so ridiculous and distracting that they could have been featured in a Saturday Night Live skit.

Beyond that, I can't help but think that the sado-masochism so emphasized in this movie was gratuitous and done to make it more shocking and, thus, appealing to the masses. How many times did we need to see Jung smacking Spielrein's naked buttocks?

So, unless you're a masochist like the character Spielrein I wouldn't recommend you watch this movie.",1333843200,13,784,5.015384615384615
5013240,4,B006PTL1QM,"Last evening I watched the film.
I have read Freud and Jung. Not completely, perhaps before I really understood either, not that I can understand either-but I mean to say I read them in connection to my work in art and my interest in creativity in my twenties. I have read biographies of their lives as well. So -the interest in this content was already there for me. They don't have to sell it-if I could I'd visit all the places of their lives. Learn more, read more. I would like to own The Red Book in reproduction actually. So I've wanted to see this movie since I saw a preview in the theater. It is the story of Jung early in his career, his relationship with Freud and their break, and a woman (Sabina Spielrein) who was Jung's first psychoanalytic patient. She apparently factored in this break in ways I did not know, nor have I ever read or heard of. In a way this was almost deflating-how could I have missed such stuff? (The acting of the three main characters btw was fascinating and unlike what I would have pictured- if pressed to explain I would respond that neither of them (Jung or Freud) had I pictured in this cerebral, refined, rather finished gentle way-and that the actress seemed to struggle almost with Tourette's or some straightjacket the rest of us couldn't see which was I hope both a liberty and a device meant to stand for the distancing mental illness produces-it achieved that effect)

The role of this first psychoanalytic patient in Jung's life trajectory seems immense- as told here- I recall somewhere in my reading someone who was an analysist, perhaps Jung, talking of how that 1st patient is so important and thus so memorable-then I would imagine kept alive in their work rather like I will always recall the first class I taught. Not being in the field I can only relate through my lens of perception. Perhaps I missed that they became sexually involved-he and his 1st patient- in what I have read. That shocked me. I didn't even realize how she went on to be such an incredible contributor in psychoanalysis,was his assistant,then taking psychoanalysis to Russia, and herself by then a psychiatrist. That he lent her such a role in his work-certainly as talking partner- made me think of a mirror-I'm sorry -it just did. And my brief fleeting thought was I bet he had many. It was fascinating to learn of all of this.

I recently have been talking and thinking about the death instinct and the creative life force in male intimacy- reading about it-to so quickly be directed to the root of the formulation of this theory via the person he analyzed and her contribution of this to the work they developed- struck me as quite a coincidence-I began reading him because I wanted to better understand creative drives as well as surviving abuse within creativity,
The movie also explores triangulation- actually that as much as anything else-and I have no idea if that is accurately what happened. Triangulation is everywhere in it. Infidelity, love, needs, the nature of repression, rejection, wounds, truth, psychiatry, boundaries, healing, sexuality, historical perspectives, evolution of ideas, science and myth, individuation-a host of themes touched upon.

I think a woman's need for the healing force of two of the greatest psychiatrists that ever lived indicates really the amazing person this girl was-or they were. For basically they both took her seriously and in their own way cared for her. My thought was sexualizing the relationship with Jung-mistake, but at least the movie bears that out false for both of them. Ultimately her fulfillment as a doctor healing her. There are things here I haven't yet worked out, and places where thins get too close to my own stuff for me to work it out easily.
And if this plot line isn't the revealing of the nature of triangles what would that be?
They are prey to their feelings in this movie, to their actions, to the dominate themes of the time, science versus mysticism for instance is discussed,  they analyze everything, they look at their histories, they explore their dream contents, they adjust the thinking,they deny, they hide truths, they reveal, they are human, they sort through the dynamics of their living-looking at what is driving them. Time figures in the story. It touches on how Freud and Jung were not the same in orientation, how the dynamics between them revealed both of their weaknesses. Especially Jung-who seems seen by Freud.
I suppose in the end what struck me was their bravery to face their feelings, continue trying-even when Jung is basically just portrayed here as a coward in his relationship to Sabina- and in his marriage-a coward- that likes the wife's money- still they are present with one another. Imperfections shown. Their importance to one another is presented in what must have been some sticky stuff.

 In this way the movie becomes rather like the opening up to discussion in repressive times of what a woman might want, what the effect of the times might breed for such an intelligent woman, to be so desired and yet to move forward and develop not as a subordinate or object alone- and finally it seems to hold her own intellectually-that was interesting. Sabina Spielrein clearly was greatly wounded, a healer herself, and these three great individuals are placed within their times dynamics one hopes accurately, you hope- so we can see the development of their methods in analysis fairly. (She will later be shot with her children,by the Nazi's which was a tragic thing to read in the last brief notes- the men having fuller careers-but all shaped by times foreshadowed here with Jung's apocalyptic dream.)
It's a love story, it's a loss story, it's a growth story, it's actually perhaps an intellectual and historical journey as well.
(I could have done without the spanking scenes, but I think that's because they seemed so privacy invading, impossible, and suggestive of titillating-and would scandalize about a half of the folks that might happen upon the movie. And I doubt them. I understood them within the context of displaying the unbounded nature of their relationship and exploration of the destructive force of sexuality she had in play from childhood-in the notion of their exploration of taboo subjects-but it came across grossly)

So essentially Jung had an affaire with a patient, with a first patient, and I suppose that's pretty significant to understand in his evolution, that his work was as much about his own insights into self as patients health-as his process. I saw in the movie at times the flashes of their equality, the wounds within him, the strange compartment for his wife, the triangulation over Sabina with Freud, Also with his wife and work,  Sabina's role in their split (Jung/Freud which I have never heard before in anything I've read), (reading later of her fate after the movie)-at least for me a movie abruptly ended....it is all grist for the mill....I think the movie distorts the man-super normalizing him here via a very sweet performance, but...

I never pictured Jung so wealthy either, but I knew that his wife was wealthy, nor him so beautiful and in such magnificently beautiful surroundings, so in the movie this felt false against my inner eye -distant and perfected or idealized-definitely idealized, tribute like- but looking at pictures later I thought perhaps this was carefully considered -certainly the quotes used as dialog throughout the movie were placed in key moments to stay with you directly from the letters.. I revise those images to move him even further from things I can understand-the luxury and station of his life...but surely there would be some quibbling about Carl Jung as seen here.
And finally, this was a relationship that their letters revealed and it was a movie based upon them. One of the fantasies or  themes of my life was a wish to have such intimacy with others through writing and experiences, to know such a closeness, to share feelings, insights, the stuff of life with another in that way-clearly these letters were the correspondence of three people that took the time, knew the significance, allowed the relating in this form to connect them. There are several movies that I love in which letters are the basis of the movie. The Anne Bancroft one with the bookseller-The Turtle Diaries among them. It would seem that these movies deeply affect me. They represent something for me- the deep connection in word. Somehow in my fantasy, or my conceptions of love, of the secrets inside us-letters, correspondence, the revealing-it is a piece of why this movie worked for me-perhaps psychologically.
How different a movie it might have been had these men simply rejected Sabina Spielrein, denied her importance to them, never written another word to her in their fear of scandal, and simply we were left with none of these records. It would seem they put the thing to pen because they were brave enough to at least on some level face and work through it -that seems such an act of care and love.
Interesting movie.",1333670400,4,9045,4.852331606217617
5013241,1,B006PTL1QM,"Oh, where to begin with this ... well, I guess if you ""dramatize"" bits from the lives of ""important"" people, the film itself becomes de facto ""important"" and ""weighty,"" right?  I mean -- it's GOTTA be!  Ya'all get POINTS just for trying!

Ugh.

ACTUALLY: Under the creakiness of such a premise (one feels, as one often does in these situations, that the diegesis/narrative tension is all but a weight on you while ""submitting"" yourself to it, more ponderous than any high school/college lecturer bore could ever've been), one feels so chastened that one's ability to ""like"" the film on one's own initiative is all but completed squashed (""How DARE you think differently!  How DARE you not 'grapple' with this!"" etc., etc.), making it an act of prolonged ethical/artistic cowardice since, y'know ... ""success"" is ""guarranteed""!

Meanwhile, to sum up, here's what you (actually) get:

-- verisimilitudinousness (now THERE's a word for ya!) layered in such a thick, mortar-around-bricks sort of way that the effect is, oddly, implausible.  One gets the sense that -- ha ha -- EVERY FRICKIN' LINE in the movie (or, like, almost) actually ""happened"" and the whole shebang was just sandwiched together to fit in a 2 hrs. plus-or-minus running time and insure ""inescapable plausibility.""  But -- and here's the real ""but"" -- for those of us whom (either in an academic setting or, perhance, out of our own ""self-starting"" curiousity) have happened across ANY of the real Freud and/or Jung's writings these characterizations strike one as ... ""off.""  Like they didn't care to capture them, exactly: just the ""Icon"" status the viewers is all but forced to ""submit"" to.  (Most film critics, curiously or not, seem unaware of this -- or, more likely, unable to PERCEIVE this.  Well, you don't HAVE to read Freud and/or Jung -- EVER -- to NECESSARILY be a ""well-rounded"" person [I suppose] ... but, if you're just going to ""show up"" at the film that's ""handed to you"" and just start off as a matter-of-course with something like ""Oh yeah, of course: Freud and Jung!  Totally!  I get it!"" you're either going to: (1.) miss much or (2.) catch little, however you want to put it!)

-- a rather horrific culture-wide precedent set herein; specifically, the scene where the very-adept actress Keira Knightley is instructed to -- front & center -- replicate ""madness"" [compulsive, labored switching, for our viewing pleasure] which none-too-many viewers, not aware of Cronenberg's madness [he's totally NOT gay, in case you were wondering!] may not have ""protected"" themselves from, by shutting their eyes during that scene and ""keeping it out"" of their heads [YOU didn't do this, did you?  Too bad!].  Knowing that there are, in fact, people in Psyche Wards who are TRULY unhinged -- and not just there for the convenience of their ""concerned"" relatives or Pfizer & Co.'s or the psychiatric ""profession"" as practiced by (mostly) M.D.'s nowadays -- but have, in fact, fallen down such a DEEP ""internal well"" that just being NEAR them can compromise your ability, to soon-therafter ... well ... let's just say some things aren't so easily ""shaken off"" and leave it at that, okay?  [That is, unless you believe ""culture shock"" is a MYTH, or are otherwise not fit for post-6th grade life without pseudo-bravadoic ""scoffing"" at anything LARGER than yourself -- yeah, GOOD LUCK with THAT!]

Soooo ... some several-times-several months [maybe sixteen? twenty-seven? I forget . . . ] after ""Adbusters"" first ran a series limning the ""leakage"" of the so-called ""torture porn"" [well ... you gotta call it SUMPTHIN', dontcha?] into mainstream culture/advertising/network T.V. programs [yah: those are some real great ""kicks"" to start foisting off on the kids!], ""Interview"" magazine -- catching the ""slow down and run backwards"" pull of this film -- has run (in its current issue) a ""fashionably institutionalized"" spread in its pages ... as though drooling, incontinence, and (perhaps) unrecoverable-from psychic trauma is ""alluring"" ... great!  Just great!  (Like that would've EVER happened without ""deep"" Croneyberg propping alluring, competent & magnetic Keira in front of a 35mm camera for our viewing pleasure ... again: terrific!)

-- lastly, making a ""20/20 hindsight"" effort along these lines would, in fact, be USEFUL if one didn't lose track of that fact that we all, nowadays, are similarly ""bound"" ... rather than, say, just looking back -- safely ensconced in our ""knowing-better,"" modern perspective -- and going ""DEEP!"" for the duration of the movie.

But, of course, that last would actually entail:

[1.] Drawing parallels in the then-current, post-Industrial Revolution, pre-World Wars world-stage (rather just tacking on an ""inexplicable""/""inevitable""/""helpless ground-level view"" epilogue; you know, those WORLD WARS just, like, ""happened""!) that were just then becoming barely possible before becoming horrifically smashed by the ""momentums"" beyond the horizon (i.e., Bram Stoker's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Illustrated-Dracula-Penguin-Illustrated-Classics/dp/0142005150/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Illustrated Dracula (Penguin Illustrated Classics)</a>,"" itself both a deep meditation on psyche/physical body/materia interaction and an allegory of Old World resentments clawing their way into the English-speaking world's ""plentitude"") -- and, like you know, the OTHER FILM stuff being done, at the time (Cronenberg apparently expects us to ignore/have never heard of the work of Bunuel/Dali like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Un-Chien-Andalou/dp/B0006IUE9I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Un Chien Andalou</a>,"" subjecting us, instead, to a ""Masterpiece Theater"" rendering of how these silly people -- ""pot kettle black"" -- couldn't quite keep all their insights in line!).  When Andre Breton -- founder of Surrealism, and considered an ""abandoner"" of his French brethren for fleeing the continent during W.W.I.I. -- came back with his ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Arcanum-17-Green-Integer/dp/1931243271/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Arcanum 17 (Green Integer)</a>"" prose-poem, CORRECTLY assessing the hatred of the female/intuitive that overwhelmed the Western Civilized world, we all were granted a ""reprieve"" from ""not-knowing"" what to make of it.  A marker.  A signpost.

But, hey: Cronenberg doesn't take ""art"" THAT seriously, does it?  (Again, kids: it's not 1950.  You don't get to PULL THIS CRAP if you haven't DONE YOUR RESEARCH!)

Sorry, Dave: you get an ""F""!

[2.] Ever since David Lynch made ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost-Highway/dp/B001152TL6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost Highway</a>"" [1997] and Richard Linklater made ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Waking-Life/dp/B00005YU1O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Waking Life</a>"" [2001], the ""ante"" has been ""upped"" -- and the ""possibilities,"" for that matter -- for making ""idea films"": experiencially, neither one-nor-the-other, neither sitting through ""ideas"" being expounded like a Stanley Kramer movie or a George Bernard Shaw play, nor ""film transpositions"" that have no THEORY you're supposed to ""get,"" y'know, in your ""head,"" OUTSIDE the film ... (whatsamatter, Dave?  Didn'tcha ""get the memo,"" or somethin'?)

[3.]  Freud MADE the ""psyche"" a tenable concept, freeing it from being a slave to Organized Religion (which, of course: few had the ""inner liberty,"" previous to then, to CONCEIVE of, without) or something artists KNEW about, but had trouble ""articulating"" (given the all-too-understandable skepticism by most other folks without said experience responded with towards such conjecture), which is why HIS ""margin of error"" is, given the times, entirely his OWN -- not OURS!  (Ours, of course, is personified by/has been established by Swiss Psychologst Alice Miller, whose unwaveringly & unflinchingly levelheaded ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Untouched-Key-Tracing-Childhood-Trauma-in-Creativity-and-Destructiveness/dp/0385267649/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Untouched Key: Tracing Childhood Trauma in Creativity and Destructiveness</a>"" ""cashed out"" Friedrich Nietzsche as a never-grown-up lifelong emotional cripple whose ""bermensch""/master race concept bore real fruit in the atrocities practiced on the Hereros in Africa, and, later, on the European Jewry in Germany ... oh, I'm sorry -- didn't you know?  He's worthless!  You're not gonna CRY, are you, tough guy, while we -- the self-policing race of nothing-but-Earthlings -- clean up his MESS, are you?  Good!  Great!  Thanks for caring!)

5013242,3,B006PTL1QM,"Several great actors playing historical figures doesn't always equal a great movie. A DANGEROUS METHOD brings us some little known history and the interactions between Carl Jung, Sigmund Freud and someone I had never heard of - Sabina Spielrein.
Speilrein is an emotionally damaged woman who is sent to Jung for psycho-analysis. Jung follows Freud's methods but also has his own ideas. Jung and Freud become friends and mentors to each other as well as sparring partners over their believes. Jung becomes sexually involved with Spielrein and nothing is ever the same.

A DANGEROUS METHOD is a beautifully films period piece taking place in the early 20th century. The visuals are a treat to the eye. Costumes and location add an extreme reality to this film. The main problem is there really is not much of interest in this film as the trio work out the problems. Three brilliant minds become intertwinned and there is not much resolution. Vincent Cassel also stars as another as another brilliant analyst with his on set of psychological problems.

The most interesting part of the film were the final comments on screen as to what happened to the main players. What happened to Spielrein after she returned to Russia and became a great analyst in her own right is sadly amazing. There is fascinating story that needs to be told.

First, Keira Knightley's performance was simply over the top. Her character didn't seem crazy; it seemed totally freakish and weird. It was as if Knightley was over-exaggerating every word and every action. So much so that it was hard to watch her without wanting to laugh at how ridiculous her acting was.

Then, the relationship between Keira Knightley and Michael Fassbender (Carl Jung in the movie) was so bland and boring that you could not even imagine the supposed passion they had for one another. Lastly, every time Jung and Freud (Viggo Mortensen) met, I had to fight not to fall asleep because their conversation was beyond mundane.

2 stars because I got to see boobs! The movie wasn't very exciting. The story was relatively interesting, but I was confused about all the bondage scenes. I am sad that the trailer basically had the ending of the movie in it so when I got to the end I was kind of like '...really?' I could have saved the money and just watched the trailer to see pretty much the whole movie. I am also sad because I enjoy a good story about something historical but I really feel like they added a lot of sex just to sell the film. I would have been ok without seeing Keira Knightley's boobs and some man that looks like a younger version of my grandfather spanking her with a belt. For me personally for the reasons described, it was a little creepy and gross lol. I'm sure other people will be totally ok with those scenes though. I also totally expected the wife to have more of a role in the movie and I am very disappointed by that. If I could summarize the plot synopsis in my own words I would say: Carl Jung has sex with a patient while arguing with Freud and neglecting his family. They laugh, they cry, they move on and die. Then end.

All in all, it didn't really make me think much or feel much. Besides slightly confused about why they would put the end of the movie in the trailer. This movie is worth a once through.

5013251,5,B006PTL1QM,"I can certainly see how the opinions of this movie may be totally scattered.  This could possibly depend on one's personal interest in the Psychiatric field of study, onto psychoanalysis, and just how far you are personally willing to take its concepts of the day. This wonderfully informative movie, directed by David Cronenberg and based on a true story, begins in Switzerland in 1904 at the hospital where a younger Dr. Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender) is busy working with patients.  He is a devout student of Dr. Sigmund Freud's theories at the time. Jung is married and his wife and he are expecting their first child.

Dr. Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortensen, who gives an excellent portrayal) is following as closely as can be to conventional thinking within the 'new study', which has vastly gained in popularity. Freud is a monogamous family man with several children.  He is now in his fifties and well-respected in the medical community although is constrained to have his theories accepted in the society of the day.  He must conform to a certain degree as to not step on too many toes for the 'new thinking' to be fully accepted.

Into Jung's peaceful hospital setting arrives the extreme patient, Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightly) who appears severely ill while contorting, screaming and resisting with all she has within her.  After a short course of settling in, Jung begins to work with her while talking being seated directly behind her.  He is asking questions while she is raging and convulsing in her chair. Dr. Jung is trying to get to the origin of her illness as she tries so hard to answer the questions, suggestions, and to remember what has happened to her.

Through a long journey of psychoanalysis for Sabina, a calmer and studious time in the facility, and a job of sorts working alongside with the testing that Dr. Jung is doing.  He is finally able to reach her and to help turn her life back around after the horrific abuse she has sustained.  He is also able to see within the drive she has of becoming a Dr. of Psychiatry herself, and encourages her forward. During her healing and beginning medical school, they become the best of friends and confidants.

After a couple of years Dr. Jung goes to Vienna to visit his mentor Sigmund Freud and to speak on many issues.  Dream interpretations, the patient Sabina, and ""The Talking Cure"" are discussed as the two colleagues begin to get to know each other much better and with a strong mutual respect. They begin writing letters to each other, discussing new insights, even testing out dream interpretations on each other.  Shortly after these two giant minds meet, Jung crosses the line and begins an aggressive affair with Sabina just as Freud had been suspecting all along. The rumor mill has been aptly turning with Freud although questioning Jung at that same time was kept to himself.

The correspondence of Dr. Freud and Dr. Jung runs a course of approximately seven years. The differences of opinion and the two doctors are also forced to realize just how different they are in their lifestyles. Freud is Jewish while Jung is not at this significant time in history along with Jung being more of a visionary of Freudian archetypes and Freud more scientific to remain medically relevant within the limitations of the time. The relationship also goes on between Jung and Sabina for the course of the movie with the addition of love, guilt, marriage, pregnancies and several other themes which are introduced and explored.  All three of the main actors present an exceptional portrayal of each doctor.

I found this movie very astute.  Wonderfully driven with dialog and full of interesting theories of what was accepted during this time in history. It is definitely an entertaining vehicle for learning some things about yourself in and through the doctor's discourse.",1332979200,18,3850,4.878834355828221

5013253,5,B006PTL1QM,"A DANGEROUS METHOD offers the audience a look at the beginnings of psychoanalysis by presenting the lives of four important doctors at eh turn of the 20th century. The film is adapted by Christopher Hampton from his play `The Talking Cure' which in turn was a dramatization of John Kerr's book `A Most Dangerous Method'. An interesting aspect of the film is that it is primarily a film about discussions embroidered with enough action to make it cinematic. It is beautiful to watch, a pleasure to hear (Howard Shore's musical score consists of `arrangements' of themes form the operas of Richard Wagner with an emphasis on the `Siegfried Idyll' which as a work with its own similar history that plays exceptionally well into this story), a challenge to absorb in the hands of director David Cronenberg, and a showcase for some fine acting.

The film opens in 1904 with Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender) accepting as a patient young Russian &eacute;migr&eacute; Sabina Spielberg (Kiera Knightley) who is a tortured soul from a past abusive upbringing.  We are like a fly on the wall, observing Sabina's neurotic/psychotic behavior as Jung begins to tame her: their gradually successful treatment results in an affair both emotional and physical despite the fact that Jung is married to Emma (Sarah Gadon) and has children and also despite the fact that Jung believes the doctor/patient relationship should be respected. Meanwhile off in Vienna Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortensen) is gaining acclaim for this psychoanalytic work and refers a patient of his, a fellow analyst Dr. Otto Gross (Vinvent Cassell) whose extreme sexual acting out has gained notoriety. Jung accepts Gross as a patient and from the stance of the story, Jung learns more form Gross than Gross benefits from Jung: apparently Jung's libido is encouraged and that urges him to act out with Sabina, now able to respond to the world in a manner so appropriate that she becomes a medical student and eventually a psychiatrist also.  The story also examines the coming together and the eventual parting of ways between Jung and Freud and it is this part of the film that becomes more significantly and satisfyingly cerebral.  It is this intense relationship between Freud and Jung that gives us a quality understanding of the birth of psychoanalysis.

Though the opening scenes of the film - those that focus on the outrageous behavioral changes in Sabina - becoming trying on the nerves, the remainder of the film is intellectually satisfying. Kiera Knightley stumbles with her Russian accent and tends to take her character's mental aberrations too far, but otherwise she is excellent in her role.  Both Michael Fassbender and Viggo Mortensen offer elegant and understated characterizations of these two important men in the history of medicine.  Vincent Cassell and Sarah Gadon are also exceptional in their acting. Providing more in depth studies of both Freud and Jung would have been welcome, but in the confines of a film we at least are allowed insights into the minds of these two men.

5013254,3,B006PTL1QM,"Following the progression of thought in the minds of three psychologists in the Edwardian era, A Dangerous Method is an intriguing film about not entirely likable individuals that raises some interesting thoughts on morality and repression.

No one quite knows what to do with Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightley). Her keen mind has been overcome with sporadic fits and hallucinations, which lands her in the mental hospital where Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender) is employed. She proves a fascinating subject, and one that prompts him to consult well-known psycho-analyst Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortenson) for his opinion. Over the years, as Sabina improves under sexual therapy, Jung finds his idealistic views of morality challenged through another associate, who believes that monogamy is unnatural and nothing should ever be repressed. But his eventual relationship with Sabina will do more than threaten his reputation... it will also begin to dismantle his precarious relationship with Freud.

This is a fascinating movie on many levels, as it explores the hypocritical nature of humankind and at times impresses us with its psychological conclusions and at others makes us smile a bit in their far-reaching explanations. The obsession that Jung has with dreams reveals a lot about his inner motivations and fears, but quite early on we understand that while common interests bring them together, elements of pride will keep Jung and Freud apart. Jung is offended to be the mentored, and Freud cannot confide in them, leaving an unequal friendship certain to implode. In the midst of this sits Sabina, who when we first meet her is contorting her face inside a carriage and then much later, becomes a successful psychologist in the field.

Casting on this is utterly delightful. Keira in particular turns in an exquisite performance that requires a large amount of physical manipulation. It is both fascinating and painful for an audience to watch, as a woman struggles with expressing her internal emotions. Fassbender is an adequate Jung, and if his intention was to make me dislike the man, he did it perfectly. It's unusual to enter a movie about Jung and come out liking Freud more, but that is what happened. Viggo is brilliant in the role, vanishing into it so completely that at times I forgot he was acting. You can see the richness of the Edwardian period in the lush costumes and settings, some of which are particularly exquisite. It also has a beautiful musical score and real intelligence in its screenplay.

I did not see most of the harsher content, but the film does earn its R-rating for sexual material and nudity. I was left to enjoy the richness of the production and the intellectual scope of the script, one that combines social prejudices and our desire to know what alters our behavior, but also the emptiness of Jung's life.",1332892800,,2851,5.072494669509595

If you choose to see this film, and you can manage to keep your eyelids apart for moments at a time, you can find the actors' craft quite remarkable.  I gave this film 2 stars for the casting quality only.",1332892800,2,523,4.038834951456311
5013256,4,B006PTL1QM,"David Cronenberg is most famous for his earlier work, which revolved around various incarnations of the New Flesh.  His three most recent films (shall we call it the Viggo Mortensen Trilogy?)  could be described as analyzing the New Identity.  Longtime fans have expressed disappointment, of course, although both A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE and EASTERN PROMISES are arguably the strongest overall films of Cronenberg's career.  A DANGEROUS METHOD is a nice end-cap to the prior two films, while never quite reaching their brutal eloquence.  This is perhaps because METHOD is more a movie of ideas, and ideas, while captivating, don't necessarily make for an entertaining film.  The story (such as it is) follows Carl Jung, as he rehabilitates Sabina Spielrein, discovering in her not only a brilliant young woman, but also a fierce lover.  This relationship causes friction between Jung and his mentor/friend, Sigmund Freud, and ultimately leads to the split between the two.  (No spoilers; it's history, after all.)

This is a slow film; indeed, at times the audience's attention is tempted to waver (thus, the lack of a fifth star).  To look away would be to miss a fine little film, however.  The performances from the three leads is utterly captivating.  The film belongs to Michael Fassbender and Keira Knightley, the former restraining his baser urges, the latter exhibiting unrestrained emotional outbursts.  Viggo Mortensen is along in a supporting capacity, utterly disappearing into the role of a jovial, thoughtful Freud.  Turning in small, but excellent, supporting roles are Vincent Cassel (as Otto Gross) and Sarah Gadon as Emma Jung.  Christopher Hampton's script (based off of his play) is top-notch, and Cronenberg's direction is surprisingly controlled; for a director known for chaotic abandoned, Cronenberg plays the film fairly close to the chest, except for a few key scenes with Knightley.  Arguably, A DANGEROUS METHOD could have benefited from a little abandon; it's not boring, not at all, but the film is ultimately missing something.  Still, it's a fine addition to Cronenberg's cannon, one that leaves us hankering for his next disturbed offering.",1332806400,,2171,5.3011695906432745

5013258,1,B006PTL1QM,"This movie is just another example of how ancient superstition poisons people to perpetuate the psychoanalysis scam.  Freud and Jung are charlatans.  The book, The Reluctant Alliance Between Behaviorism And Humanism shows how science overcomes the superstition of psychoanalyst's and documents effective methodology, but this movie ignores the truth and continues to perpetuate this ignorant behavior.  Sad.  Psychoanalysts use the ancient superstition that you have a magical, self initiating force in your brain called a soul/will that gives you free willy. This assumption allows psychos (psychoanalysts), that never solve a problem, to blame you for your behavior. The best way to control anyone is too make them think they have a little man inside their heads to control their behavior. You have a problem it is up to you, take some personal responsibility. Never works.  Solving unhealthy behavior involves re-arranging the contingencies of reinforcement to reinforce healthy behavior, but that would take too much time, too many resources, and continuous adaption. Too difficult. It is much easier to tell people it is up to them AND have people feel good about being able to talk about things they cannot say to others in this culture AND repeating cultural clich's articulately, ad infinitum. Easy, but wrong.  Psychoanalysis is a cruel tool that never works and this movie continues to foster this dangerous method.  It is much easier to tell others to take responsibility and never take any responsibility of their own to shape healthy behavior. No problem ever gets solved, but the psychos get paid a ton to listen to you get to talk of subjects that are taboo in this culture and feel much better for an hour. You have to want change. How great. A way of doing nothing and not observing that circumstances make us want things and rearranging contingencies determines wanting what is healthy or unhealthy, but they ignore the facts.  They don't have to do a thing, they put all their lies/superstitions on you. You get to feel like you are solving problems, but actually you just schedule endless appointments and the vicious cycle never ends. Everybody wins. Viva La Psycho!

Otherwise, the performances are mostly very good, though Knightley is a bit irritating at times, overdoing the grimaces and the odd accent.  Fassbender and Mortensen are very solid by contrast.
Somehow, this film left me wanting a bit more.  Did Jung have any sort of relationship with his kids?  Why did his wife stay with him?  Surely she knew he was getting around with the other women and patients.  How did Sabina's childhood abuse lead to the screaming fits and attacks that she suffered?  How many other patients benefited, or didn't, at the clinic?",1332633600,5,652,4.716814159292035
5013260,1,B006PTL1QM,"Film makers, like novelists, have artistic license when dealing with historical characters and events.  Still, when their portrayal is severely distorted, they may be doing a disservice to the audience, who comes to accept what they see or read as the truth.  This is the case with A Dangerous Method, which has so many biographical facts wrong that it makes the film hard to follow or understand. The movie purports to be about the relationship between Carl Jung at the beginning of his career, Freud, and one of Jung's first psychoanalytic patients, a young Russian-Jewish woman named Sabina Spielrein.  What is wrong? Jung is portrayed as a clean-cut, serious and soft-spoken young man.  In fact, the real Jung was a ferociously ambitious doctor, with a booming voice, energetic, and someone who felt, from late childhood on, that he had two personalities.  He was, in other words, somewhat of a wild man; in his youth his friends called him ""barrel"" both because of his robust physique and his capacity for alcohol.  In short, the portrayal of Jung is a most serious distortion of the real man.

Eugen Bleuler, the head of the Burghlzli where Sabina is hospitalized is, again, mistakenly portrayed as an authoritarian man who has little sympathy for her.  Not true: both he and Jung granted her wish to become a medical student and not a mental patient and it was this, along with Jung's love, care, and taking her on as his research assistant, that enabled her to overcome the crazed state she was in when she first came to the hospital.

And what of the real Sabina?  The movie shows her engaged in various bizarre body distortions but gives no sense of why she is in such a state.  In fact, she was the oldest daughter of a wealthy family whose father beat and abused her and whose mother was so self-centered that when she brought Sabina to the Burghlzi, she almost never visited her, preferring to spend her time staying in a luxurious hotel and shopping.  The mother also had the strange idea that her daughter should be completely shielded from sexuality and, even as an eighteen-year-old, she didn't understand reproduction.  Sabina, who was brilliant (she mastered four foreign languages by the age of seven), was reacting with hatred at both her father's violent treatment of her, her mother's disinterest, and the difficulties that women faced realizing their potential during these years.  She was one of those extremely energetic persons who did not hold her emotions back and most of what she displayed when she first saw Jung was in reaction to the frustrations and abuse in her life.  She displayed out of control temper tantrums, some of a childish nature, and rage.  Jung began trying an early version of psychoanalysis with her but soon found that it was more meaningful to both of them to have her participate with him as an assistant and collaborator in his research.  This, along with the granting of her request to study medicine - providing she acted appropriately in classes - led to the complete abatement of her symptoms within little more than a year.  She pursued her medical studies with ease, got her degree with Jung's assistance, and, at his suggestion, went into psychiatry and, eventually, became a psychoanalyst.  She returned to her native Russia, wrote a number psychoanalytic papers, married, had children, and helped spread psychoanalysis there until she and her family were murdered by the Nazis in 1940.

Did Sabina and Jung have an affair?  She clearly fell in love with him and proclaimed to one and all - including her mother and Jung's wife -- that they were lovers.  His comments in letters are more ambiguous but they certainly spent a great deal of time together and, given his later affairs, it is likely that they did.  While we now know that sex with patients is destructive, in this case it seemed to be part of the love that helped her recover. There is no evidence that Jung beat her on the buttocks with a leather strap, as depicted in the movie, though she may have had such a fantasy.

The portrayal of Freud is probably the least distorted in the movie since his main concern, as it was in fact, was luring Jung into the psychoanalytic movement as a loyal adherent.  At the same time, the movie seems to suggest that Jung's affair with Sabina had something to do with the later break with Freud as well as Jung's own breakdown.  Completely untrue, as revealed in the Freud-Jung correspondence and other biographical sources.  Many of the early analysts had sex with their patients and Freud seemed little concerned with this as long as they adhered to psychoanalytic dogma.  Jung saw Sabina in 1905, she graduated from medical school in 1911, and Jung's near psychotic breakdown occurred in 1914 when Freud, who he had come to revere as a substitute for his own weak father, rejected him.

Sigmund Freud gave me the tools to understand dreams and to understand sexuality. Those tools are words. Those words are littered all over 'A Dangerous Method.' The ego, repression, libido, neurotic and biggest of all: freedom.

Freedom is being psychoanalysed in 'A Dangerous Method.' A woman has her childhood pain revealed to herself through the talking method. She finds it liberates her sexuality. But it is the welcoming embrace of a dream job offer which really locates herself.

A man who finds sex at any 'oasis' is battling with a man who wants to remain in a monogamous relationship; his wife gives him some rope then reins it in when he asks for too much.

Meanwhile a father figure is unrepentant in his belief that the sexual urge is behind everything. He has found a new land even though he does not yet know what lies ahead. He is the solid rock denying the chance for more intuitive reasoning to bloom. He is a man of science.

5013262,4,B006PTL1QM,"Based on a true story and highly influenced by the 2002 discovery of letters and diary of Sabina Spielrein.

Keira Knightley shines magnificently as Sabina Spielrein, a spastic, neurotic, but highly intelligent patient of the young Swiss doctor Carl Jung (methodically played by Michael Fassbender). While she is neurotic her intellect still reasons. In an early scene Sabina is in a pond as the men in white coats try to persuade her out.

The clinic director approaches her and says ""You clearly have too much time on your hands. We must find something for you to do. What are your interests?""

Sabina, ""Suicide and interplanetary travel."" In this simple scene we can grasp her intellect and her issues.

Jung allows Sabina, (who wants to be a doctor) to act as his assistant, a task she does a little too well as demonstrated with her diagnosis of patients using word associtaion. Sabina has been abused by her father. Now it gets weird. He would slap her, then make her kiss his hand afterwards. He would also spank her bare bottom, something Keira confesses caused arousal, even at an early age. She would do things which would cause her to be spanked.

Carl Jung decides to consult some guy named Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortensen) about this case. Mortensen plays Freud somewhat stiff, for a guy who relates everything to sex. When cocaine snorting, womanizer patient (Vincent Cassel as Otto Gross) shows up at the clinic, his unethical ways cause Jung to question his life and his relationship with Knightly who now desires sex and a good spanking.

Freud is always pictured with a cigar in his hand or mouth(sometimes a cigar is just a cigar), but his other idiosyncrasies are not captured. Note the German custom of wearing the wedding ring on the right hand. He is involved in a lot of dialouge scenes about sex, repression, ego, and dream interpretation. What should be a five star movie from the cast, lacks action in the script and good drama in the dialouge, but does have an historical interest. Worth while rental.

fassbender and mortenson do the more restrained jobs that playing jung and freud would require.  there are strong emotions running between the two men but as analysts this must be conveyed in their typical observational and subdued style.  for example, freud has a number of problems with jung and they aren't sexual!  first and foremost, he envies him that he is married to one of the wealthiest women in europe.  next, freud suffers from all the coming thunder of being a Jew in a Germany which will erupt against Jews.  Jung has no such religious or ethnic background to constantly battle.

they only knew one another for seven years and then parted over divisive beliefs in where psychoanalytic practice should develop. they knew one another before the world wars broke out in europe. both are regarded as giants in the psychiatric field.  few people, at least in america, receive either straight jungian or freudian therapy today.  the major factor is that the cost of rendering such treatment does not fit within our health care system.  however, all branches of treatment used today feature the basic precepts established by these two men.

5013266,3,B006PTL1QM,"A DANGEROUS METHOD is a heavily intellectual work, with a heavy emphasis on sex...much like the work of Sigmund Freud, one of the main characters in t his fascinating yet aloof film.

The movie starts with a bang, as we see the clearly disturbed Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightley) being forcibly admitted to a hospital.  She is thrashing and contorting her face and body in remarkable ways.  Surely this woman is in for a lengthy asylum visit.

But she is in fact going to be the first patient on which young Dr. Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender) will be trying his new method of Psychanalysis (yes, t that's what he calls it at first).  He places Spielrein in a chair and sits behind her and encourages her to talk.  Soon, she is confronting her demons and confessing some pretty lurid sexual feelings, including the pleasure she receives from humiliation and physical punishment.

From here, A DANGEROUS METHOD swings back and forth between being an interesting case study of the relationship between Jung and Spielrein and an intellectual tug of war between Jung, and his older mentor Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortensen).  In the first instance, we see that the rigid divide between patient and doctor is not quite so settled in 1904.  Jung continues to treat Spielrein, but because she has a keen intellect and interest in her own treatment, he puts her to work as a research assistant.  And we also see their relationship teetering towards something even more than professor & student.  In the second instance, there are dinner table conversations and exchanged letters between Jung & Freud, wherein Jung challenges Freud to think beyond the confines of everything in psychoanalysis (as Freud calls it) relating to sex.

These Jung vs. Freud exchanges are INTERESTING.  They don't make for very exciting ENTERTAINMENT, however.  They feel a bit turgid.  Jung is, in many ways, such a fussbudget that he is incapable of small talk and only wants to challenge his mentor.  Freud, the elder statesman, isn't particularly inspired to fight back vigorously.  He is looking for a successor to himself and fancies that Jung will be such...but he also doesn't seem to embrace his role as inspiration and mentor.  He mostly seems vaguely bemused...at least until the relationship between Jung & Spielrein has a direct impact on the relationship between Jung & Freud.

The movie is certainly interesting in that much of it is true, including word for word readings of the correspondence between these two influential men.  But the movie fails to be emotionally gripping on almost any level.  The relationship between Jung & Spielrein is never gripping, as both of these people are driven by passions out of their control, and frequently come across as being acted UPON rather than making choices and deciding on actions.  And the relationship between Jung & Freud comes across like a well-acted reenactment in a TV documentary about the two men.  This is all the more disappointing, because with a director like David Cronenberg at the helm, I had hoped for more twisted sparks.  I think he was constrained by the stage-bound screenplay, and perhaps felt the emotional turmoil surely roiling in these characters would play more than it does.  It is simply too far below the surface most of the time.

Mortensen's role is fairly small, and we really only have the tiniest glimpse into Freud's life.  Fassbender is clearly a smart actor who understands the man he is playing on a very intellectual level, but what's missing is the sense that he is truly INHABITING his character...which is a shame, because Fassbender is such a terrifically physical actor.  Knightley has by far the flashiest role, and she is generally quite good.  Her character is the most interesting...and when reading the closing comments about what happens to each character...it's almost enough to make you want to read much more about her.  In many ways, this is the most ""grown up"" character Knightly has played.  She truly has a chance to mature into a woman.

A DANGEROUS METHOD is gorgeously filmed, and many of the locations are the actual locations these events took place.  The pace is fairly brisk.  It is never uninteresting...but I really wanted to care more about these people.  It's tough to actually recommend this film to a general audience...if the subject matter is of particular interest to you, then you should probably see it.",1327881600,13,4406,4.956403269754769
5013267,4,B006PTL1QM,"""A Dangerous Method"" (99 min.) is a historical drama featuring two parallel but intertwined stories: first the troubled relationship between Swiis doctor Carl Jung, founder of the analytical psychology (played by current ""It"" actor Michael Fassbender) and his Russian patient (and medicine university student) Sabina Spielrein (played by Kiera Knightley); and second the budding rivalry and eventual fall-out between Jung and Austrian-born Sigmund Freud (played by Viggo Mortensen), who of course revolutionaized the medical world in the early 20th century with his theories of psychoanalysis.

The movie is directed by David Cronenberg, yes the same director who brought us The Fly, A History of Violence, and Crash, just to name those. I cannot recall a single movie off the top of my head directed by Cronenberg that is anywhere similar to this one. No matter. This movie is a ""talk"" movie, not an action movie. The script is by Christopher Hampton, and I wish more context wouul've been provided as to the moment in history that these events are taking place. But in the end, you will marvel at the acting performances in this movie. Knightley brings her best performance ever, period (check out the first 10 min. of the movie!).

And then there is Michael Fassbender, whom I just recently saw brilliantly in ""Shame"". Here he goes completely the opposite direction and brings a restrained, if not understated, but beautiful performance as Jung. How is it possible that Fassbender did not get a single Oscar nomination for either performance? It blows the mind. All that aside, ""A Dangerous Method"" is a nice little movie, but beware, not for anyone in a hurry or wanting to see an ""action"" movie.",1327795200,6,1700,5.067857142857143

8502889,5,B006PTL1QM,Great for those with an interest in psychology. Particularly those interested in Jung or Freud. The acting is outstanding and the subject matter compelling. This movie is not for those who are merely interested in some lightweight entertainment; this movie is an intellectual exercise. I recommend watching with someone who you enjoy good conversation with. This will certainly catalyze that.,1518393600,,392,5.55
