3864646,4,B0027CSMXQ,"This is one of the better series that deals with heros who help out people who are in a tough spot. The writing is clever and the plots have enough depth to sustain the show for forty four minutes. I like the supporting cast more than the lead, and find the sub plot of who ""burned"" the lead character as less interesting than the weekly adventure.",1254700800,,348,4.287878787878788
3864647,5,B0027CSMXQ,"Sex appeal.  Comedy.  Drama.  Action.  You want it.  And you've got it with Burn Notice.

Burn Notice is a television series on the USA Network.  The sexy Jeffrey Donovan plays the main character, Michael Westen, a former spy who has been ""burned"", or blacklisted, by the agency he used to work for with no knowledge as to why, and is then dumped smack in the middle of Miami, Florida.

Westen spends most of the series trying to find out who issued his burn notice while honing his intelligence skills on jobs that seem to find him, sometimes at the worst possible times.  You will be drawn in to his voiceover explanations of the weapons he's creating or the situations he is devising and will find yourself comparing him to a modern-day James Bond or MacGuyver.  He can convey that something isn't going as well as he had hoped with a subtle look on his face and when he slips on his glasses and grins, you know things are going to get interesting.  He has a quick, sly wit and a penchant for sharp suits.  He has a sordid past with an abusive, alcoholic father, yet he always makes time for his over-worred mom, (Sharon Gless), no matter how bad her timing is.  He can be caught up in a deadly job but still make it to her family counseling sessions.

He also has a strong liking for yogurt.

Cult favorite Bruce Campbell, (Evil Dead, Army of Darkness), stars as Sam, Westen's aging partner in crime who is an ex-Navy Seal with skills just as sharp as Michael's.  Sam enjoys drinking anything with alcohol in it at the local hangouts and checking out the pretty ladies on the beach, even trying to scoop up some for some possible food and shelter.  Sam usually ends up bringing jobs to Michael that seem harmless and end up turning into quite the conundrum.  But Sam comes in handy for creating distractions, like posing as a man who needs to ship Pilates balls in large quantities to some gun-runners just so he can check out their warehouse and report back to Michael.

And just when you thought you couldn't have a strong, respectable female character who still exudes a razor-sharp sex appeal and a talent for weaponry, enter Fiona (Gabrielle Anwar, who you might have seen in the film The Three Musketeers), Westen's ex-girlfriend and an ex-IRA member.  She can take care of herself, sometimes a little too well, even when posing as the damsel in distress.  She can make household bombs and render a man helpless with her looks, as well as her weaponry and fast fighting style.  She'll do anything for Michael, and vice versa.  Being a spy had forced Michael to end their relationship, but Fi still holds out hope that maybe they can someday be together, despite what Michael says.

In a series complete with twists, but no too many as to become cliched, informative and comical voiceovers, excellent comedic timing, (including the introduction of characters from time to time), and more guns than you can shake a stick at, it's hard not to be entertained by this refreshing show.  You're kept on the edge of your seat, knowing that when the day finally comes that we learn who burned Michael, it won't be anti-climactic.  It's hard to say ""that was a good episode"" when every episode is incredible.

Well-written, great acting, a respectful female lead and comedy and guns for all!  If you don't watch this show now, you should.  And if you do watch this show, you already know what everyone else is missing.

Bet you can't watch just one!",1254096000,3,3449,4.597381342062193

So I ordered season 1 and 2 in the US because I was curious about it. I did not regret it.

This series is fresh, with a sense of humour, interesting characters. Even though  - in the first season I feared this ""client-thing"" could become a bit boring and the characters needed a bit more of deepness. Watching season two, I was completely satisfied. This mix from alias, Mc Gyver, maybe even a bit of the good old ""Magnum"" - thrilling episodes, interesting new characters ( a great Micheal Shanks for example) and stories, actors getting better and better and - at the end - one is just waiting for season three.

Would have given four stars for season one, but after watching the second season, five stars are a must.",1251936000,5,830,4.594594594594595
3864650,5,B0027CSMXQ,Great show and even better cast. All of the actors in this show blend together so that anyone of them can hold the show afloat.,1249862400,,127,4.12
3864651,5,B0027CSMXQ,"Best show on TV, no doubt.  Great premise, great writing, great acting.  Doesn't take itself too seriously.  There is real chemistry between all the major players, and even the supporting cast is stellar in recurring roles:  Barry the money launderer, Nate, Michael's brother - love them all.  My favorite recurring opponents:  Jason Bly, Victor, Carla, Brennan.  Television hasn't been this good in many years.  Hope it continues for many seasons.",1249430400,,448,5.3
3864652,5,B0027CSMXQ,"Show is amazing, great characters, writing, acting, and production value. The only thing i would recommend is getting it in a widescreen format or high deff if you can. The full screen some what low contrast(tho it may just be my tv) make it look dated or cheep, when infact the show is fairly high budget and shot with RED, a 35mm film quality camera. But if you cant its still a great show, i have seen the whole thing twice now. My family sat down to watch a couple episodes and ended watching the whole first season in 2 nights.

Buy it, you won't regret it",1248048000,2,561,4.242990654205608
3864653,5,B0027CSMXQ,Burn Notice is by far the best show on tv.  Season 1 is fantastic!  Every show is solid!  Season 2 has some weak episodes but over all it's still excellent.  Season 3 has just started and so far every single episode is great!  I could watch all of the shows over and over and over again.,1247961600,3,287,4.053571428571429

3864696,5,B0027CSMXQ,"I bought this for my husband's birthday because he LOVES the show. It's a ""manly"" show. I had originally purchased only season one at a store (the one with a red, circular symbol...) and it was the same price on amazon for BOTH seasons. So I returned the first purchase and ordered seasons one and two online. Much better deal.

The premise of this show is about Michael Weston, an international spy who has been ""burned,"" or blacklisted by the people he works for. He is determined to find out who blacklisted him and why, and along the way he picks up jobs from various people in Miami who are in trouble. He works with his ex-girlfriend, Fiona, and an old friend, Sam.

I bought this show, not only because my husband really likes it, but because it's one of the only shows I've seen that isn't dirty or especially violent. I appreciate the fact that they don't have to swear all the time, show sex scenes, or have bloody shoot-out scenes. This is an action show, it has a lot of comedy in it, and the character, Michael Weston, is an all-around good guy. He doesn't kill people unless he absolutely has to, and he loves his mom! It's a good show!",1279670400,,1150,4.394366197183099
3864697,5,B0027CSMXQ,"This is probably the best show on TV, now that 24 is done. What I really wanted to say was this costs $89. You can buy season 1 and season 2 separately and it only costs $54. Way to go Amazon! lol. How does anyone miss that?",1276128000,2,224,3.7872340425531914
3864698,5,B0027CSMXQ,My dad loves this.  I have season 3 on pre-order.  He has watched these episodes so many times and still going!  Totally worth it to see him happy with it.  He talks about it all the time.  'Best show ever made!',1273881600,,212,4.073170731707317
3864699,5,B0027CSMXQ,"A friend let me borrow her copy of Season 1 last month and told me she thought I'd love it. She couldn't believe I hadn't watched it before now. After watching the first disc, I couldn't believe it either! I've been missing out on a great show. Action, romance, comedy and drama all wrapped up into one--what more could you ask for? Love the on-again, off-again relationship between Michael and Fiona; love how Jeffrey Donovan plays the ""side"" characters each week; and Bruce Campbell is hilarious as Sam. Best of all, you can definitely re-watch this series, which is why I purchased my own copies of Seasons 1 and 2.",1273104000,,618,4.627272727272727
3864700,5,B0027CSMXQ,"Let me start by saying I don't really watch too much TV. When I do, I gravitate towards the more gritty or cerebral shows like House,Dexter or Fringe. But Netflix has this program embedded in the subscription that based off reviews on movies or shows you submit they will make recommendations on shows or movies you may like. Burn Notice kept populating, no matter how many times I said I wasn't interested or ignored it. Finally, after pretty much exhausting all my interests... I ordered it, the first season. I LOVED IT. This show has action, comedy, eye candy for girls & guys (it is set in lovely Miami...), & a very intriguing subplot that ties all the action together.
He is an ex-spy, and wants to know why. He was issued a ""Burn Notice"" that essentially leaves him with nothing in the way of funds, connections and most importantly answers. One day he is in deep cover in unstable Nigeria negotiating with terrorists, the next day he is broke, alienated and mysteriously in Miami. Now the search for answers ensues. In the meantime he takes ""odd"" jobs that suit his skills he has acquired as an agent. He undercuts druglords, punks gangsters, sets up con artists, cleans up neighborhoods... all with his spy/CIA skills. This show is in the same vein as ""The Equalizer"" an '80's show with a similiar plot line. I can tell you Burn Notice is a much better written and appealing plot line in my opinion having seen both series. YOU NEED TO CHECK THIS OUT. Rent it is first... then go buy it! Have fun!",1273017600,2,1507,4.564575645756458

3864728,5,B0027CSMXQ,"I love Burn Notice and I have been watching it since it first aired back in summer of 2007. I've been telling my dad about how great it is and he really wanted to watch it so when it was on sale, the first two seasons for about $40 I thought it was a perfect gift for Dia de los Reyes (January 6th, I think americans call it epiphany?)

Shipping was quick and very inexpensive like it always is with Amazon but I'm really mad that in the description on the product it said that both sets of DVD's came with Spanish audio and that is not the case, the main reason I decided to go with Amazon was because they offered the Spanish audio (The gift was for my Father who doesn't understand English all that well and finds reading the subtitles a little distracting) after all Costco has each of the seasons for $19.99 since the middle of December.

I'll think twice before buying something from them since I was very disappointed with the somewhat-inaccurate description.",1265155200,,966,4.421348314606742

The filming, stylish sets and cool clothes remind me alot of the old breakthrough Miami Vice series with Don Johnson., only much better.

It does require your attention to keep up with the details and the plots, but unlike many shows on TV, this is not watered down or overly violent.  This has the right balance of smart writing and fantasy to make the adventures of Michael Westen watchable.  Sure it's not hard core or gritty like what you would see on pay cable, but it is not as cheesy as the network shows.  The characters are fun, the writing is solid and if you need an escape, this is a fun way to forget how bad your day is going.  Imagine being ""burned"" and living Michael's life for a day.
