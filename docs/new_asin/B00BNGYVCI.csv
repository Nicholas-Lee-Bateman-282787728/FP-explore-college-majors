5658763,5,B00BNGYVCI,"Sister Italy ....Comedy or drama ? Definitely  hilarious and moving.

Get more than one copy......give one to your son or daughter.
This is a must see movie; a story about two italian sisters which not only makes you laugh but it also makes you cry; it teaches us that the family is more important than money and that the love for one and another is what makes us cope with all  the problems in life.

5658764,1,B00BNGYVCI,"If this is your idea of funny I fell sorry for you. If it's your idea of a heartfelt, poignant drama, you need to get a life. As an Italian-American I find these stereotypical characters shallow, idiotic and totally unbelievable. This movie is an insult and a far cry from the comedic drama to be found in Moonstruck, To Rome With Love, Life Is Beautiful and other great Italian comedies Some may disagree but what is undeniable is the acting, which is so bad it's embarrassing. Several characters go in-and-out of having accents and all look like they are reading their lines from cue cards. Sister Italy should remain an orphan. Do yourself a favor....don't buy it, rent it and most of all DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WATCHING IT.",1455926400,,726,4.635658914728682
5658765,3,B00BNGYVCI,"A lot of family conflict and not enough comedy, but it does have a lot of Italian flavor, which is why we enjoyed it.",1445472000,,117,3.9166666666666665

5658773,1,B00BNGYVCI,"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I made my husband and children watch it with me but let my children go after they begged me to stop watching it. We finished it with hopes it would get better...we were wrong. It was horrible. In fact I found it insulting. I strongly dislike the portrayal of Italian husbands cheating on their wives. Enough of that! The acting, filming, story line was awful. The language was unnecessary. No class to this movie. I grew up in an Italian family and this was never how we acted. Do not waste your money. I wish I could get my money back!",1420243200,2,613,4.293103448275862

5658776,2,B00BNGYVCI,"What makes this funny is the bad-acting and stereotyping of the characters. The men are greedy, ugly, stupid, and chauvinistic and the women are objectified and just as stupid. This portrays the Italian families no one who is Italian (or otherwise for that matter) would want to be a part of.
I came from a very large Italian family (Sicilian and Calabrese) and no one ever acted like this ever. The only truth to the movie is that most Italian women do tend to be rather excellent cooks and enjoy preparing meals for the people they love. The truth ends there. The DVD is amateurish in content and production. Not worth the time or money.",1415836800,2,639,4.565217391304348
5658777,5,B00BNGYVCI,"The Sister Italy video gives you the competition of true Italian Sisters or Cousins or Friends.  It is a fierce competition between families to not be cut out of the will.  The lives of each person involved in it. Very entertaining.  Italian cooking at its' funniest, and best.",1410998400,,277,4.729166666666667
5658778,1,B00BNGYVCI,"Sister Italy was one of the worst films I have ever seen. It felt like a porn flick without the porn. Instead of sending DVDs of Death Wish, they should have sent this DVD to each other. That is worse than death. Do not waste your money or time on this sorry movie.",1409529600,2,265,4.018867924528302
5658779,4,B00BNGYVCI,"very sweet movie...got it as a gift for one of my sisters..a bit hokey, but we laughed a lot to see the typical Italian sister rivalry...lol",1406678400,,140,4.423076923076923

5658781,5,B00BNGYVCI,"Sister Italy is a very funny movie.  You don't have to be Italian to enjoy it but if you are you will have a very special connection to this movie.  The characters in this movie are all so unique.  As I watched, it brought back so many memories of my Grandparents and Aunt's and Uncle's.  I watched it several times and laughed each time.  It is so common in Italian family's for them to fight over some of the most stupid things but in the end when the chips are down it always comes back to the most important thing, Family.  Get this movie, you won't be disappointed.",1395532800,,570,4.231481481481482
5658782,5,B00BNGYVCI,"SISTER ITALY: A laugh out loud Felliniesque Comedy with a kaleidescopic cast like a modern day Amacord or Divorce Italian Style. The sibling rivalry war brought to fruition via a cathartic transformation of hearts without losing its comedic flair while containing the deep rainbow of emotions that come with family war. The Montagues meet the Capulets in Brooklyn in 2014. Actually there is room here for a television series revealing the daily lives of these crazy characters. With wider distribution I believe Sister Italy would create a cult following. BRAVO!! Thank you, Daniel Birch, actor/athlete",1395360000,,602,5.347368421052631

5658785,5,B00BNGYVCI,"I caught this at a screening and it really surprised me. This is a real hidden gem with a fun, sweet storyline and surprisingly strong acting.  In the spirit of excellent intimate indies like Napoleon Dynamite, this film captures a very specific culture with both a searing wit and a loving sympathy. Don't miss it!",1391904000,,315,4.7272727272727275
5658786,1,B00BNGYVCI,"This video was marketed as a funny comedy, it was not funny. Very cheesy portrayal of Italians and a very ridiculous storyline.  Didn't even finish watching it.",1390694400,3,160,4.925925925925926

5658788,5,B00BNGYVCI,"I purchased this movie after Amazon recommended it to me. I had not heard of it before but I figured, why not.  I was pleasantly surprised by the fantastic ensemble cast of amusing characters in the family!  Each scene is funnier than the next. I was doubled over laughing.  The story all comes together with a surprising twist, too!  I highly recommend you watch it!",1388707200,,367,4.6

5658798,4,B00BNGYVCI,It does suffer a little for being so low budget but the cast and production did a nice job keeping it moving. Much of the humor is very funny and the characters are very engaging. Worth a look.,1374883200,6,193,4.105263157894737
5658799,5,B00BNGYVCI,"It's entertaining and funny movie that appeal to entire family. The story of two sisters who embattle in a culinary feud that would result in gaining the affection of their aunt and a $ 5M inheritance after her death.
It's a must see movie with a very beautiful and passionate conclusion",1373932800,2,287,4.647058823529412
5658800,5,B00BNGYVCI,"Sister Italy is a story about two very Italian sister's and a food competition. The antics that they and their families get into to win the love and money of a very wealthy aunt is hilarious! The culinary experience makes you hungry and want to eat Italian food. The combination of the cast and the story are so funny that you must see this video more than once. It will make you laugh and cry. The music is wonderful, the actors are perfect, and Angela Sciddurlo Rago is a genius storyteller. Loved it and will watch it many more times.",1373241600,3,537,4.38
5658801,5,B00BNGYVCI,"So far I have watched this Italian family movie three times and laughed harder each time that I watched it. At first, I thought this movie was about my family but then realized that all families can relate to it. Even if you're not Italian, you'll love it! In this family, two sisters compete for the love of another family member or is it the money that they are after. Watch this movie to find out who wins her love or ""prize"" as their competing families see it.",1373068800,6,464,4.284090909090909
5658802,3,B00BNGYVCI,"Don't go looking for Academy Awards in this charming low-budget independent film. But, if you've ever been competitive with siblings, you'll really appreciate it. Full of familial love & jealousy, there's something for everyone, especially if you like food.( It made me want to jump into it & mangia!) Two sisters compete for their mother's inheritance by cooking her favorite dishes, despite endangering her health with some of them. As expected, Mamma passes on and leaves her fortune to one--I won't tell you which one, but that's when the real fun & feud starts. Emelise Aleandri & Angela Rago head the cast on a merry romp to see who will end up with the prize. It's an enjoyable light-hearted summer fare for all.",1372723200,3,719,4.853658536585366
5658803,5,B00BNGYVCI,"I picked this up recently and found it to be a surprisingly sweet, genuine little movie.  It's not going to blow you away with star power but the characters are fun, the performances have heart, and the production is more than the sum of its parts.  You'll enjoy the catchy score and the family drama in this hidden gem that doesn't take itself too seriously and does what it sets out to achieve.",1372204800,4,396,4.410958904109589

8571612,3,B00BNGYVCI,It's a pretty good bad movie.  But sometimes a good old fashion dumb movie is what you need.  Really bad acting but that is part of the fun.  It was totally irrational however that was what made it even funnier.  The jist of the movie revolved around cooking good Italian food.  Something that's really important to Italians.,1489622400,,325,4.631578947368421
8571613,1,B00BNGYVCI,"The thought of two Italian sisters getting into a cooking contest should make anyone laugh.  This movie did not.

I'm Italian.  Some of the things that happen in my own family when food is involved create great comedy.  I hoped to see some of those sentiments here.

The plot could have been carried off with better writing and actors.  In fact, it should have been one of those movies that made you laugh so hard that your stomach hurt.  It wasn't.

Very disappointing.",1485561600,,470,4.578313253012048
