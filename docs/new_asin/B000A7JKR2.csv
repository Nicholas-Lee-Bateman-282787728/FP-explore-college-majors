8075859,5,B000A7JKR2,"This DVD was ordered for my husband's b-day.  I couldn't be more pleased.  We have camped and fished at Cave Run Lake several times over the last 2-3 yrs.  It's a beautiful, well maintained, 'got something for everyone' lake and forest (Daniel Boone Nat'l Forest).  Recently the hubby has become addicted to muskie fishing...so this DVD just seemed like a no brainer.

The great thing about this DVD is that it isn't just another 'catch a fish, show the fish to the camera' kind-of-a-production.  This DVD is professionally produced. It intermingles historical local lore, muskie facts, Cave Run Lake scenery, and the expected fishing footage. My mother-in-law and I both sat down to watch it with the men (trust me, that's saying something)....and we were engrossed!!

Fear not avid muskie anglers, there is plenty of 'on the water' footage and tales of lures and the one that got away, but you'll be pleasantly surprised by this DVD, and I suspect that this will be a disc that you will watch more than once. It's a little pricey for a 1 disc deal, but It was worth it for the purpose I bought it for.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.",1289692800,,1122,4.688775510204081
8075860,5,B000A7JKR2,Finally someone made a DVD that shows what muskie fishing is really all about! Those fish are MONSTERS. This DVD definitely wanted me to go fishing and drink moonshine. What more can you ask for?,1123113600,,195,4.6
