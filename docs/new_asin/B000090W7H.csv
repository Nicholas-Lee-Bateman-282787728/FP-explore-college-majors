1876514,5,B000090W7H,"I am 25 years old and have used ""Signing Time"" as a kick-off in my attempt to get back into practice with sign language. It has proved to be just what I needed! Rachel, Alex, and Leah make it easy and fun to remember the signs with catchy music and plenty of child and adult models for each sign. Signing Time! is a useful and fun tool allowing adults AND kids who aren't old enough to speak or those who have disabilties to convey what they want, need, or feel.",1104278400,2,462,4.144444444444445
1876515,5,B000090W7H,"My child started watching these fantastic videos at 8 months old, so we could teach her sign language. She is not hearing impaired but we thought it beneficial to teach her sign language as a second language to help her communictae with us before she could talk. She loved the videos and even asked to watch them. She did her first sign at 10 months and asked for 'Milk"". Now she is 2 years old an still mesmerized by the videos adn loves watching them. She now knows all the signs from the first three videos and signs them often. She is also talking a lot now and signing has in no way impaired her speech or slowed it down.
These videos are pleaseing to the eye both for children adn grown ups. Many children sign the signs adn it is also repeeated verbally to help your hearing child to pick up the words. they are bright colourful adn the songs are beautiful adn very catchy.
I would recommend these videos to anyone interested in teaching sign to their children. [...]",1103760000,,974,4.386740331491713
1876516,5,B000090W7H,"My husband and I are not big on letting our daughter watch TV, but we checked these out from the library. She is 14 months old and loves them to death. I like them because they are live action, not annoying, and great for learning. She has picked up several signs from the videos, and the other day came in and pointed to the TV while shaking her hands up and down! Honestly, some of the songs are not that great, but the video of other kids doing signs is priceless, and they make it really easy for everyone, even parents, to learn signs. If you want to learn some basic ASL, I highly recommend all the videos in this series!",1097712000,,627,4.190082644628099
1876517,5,B000090W7H,"I purchased the 3 Signing Time videos as well as the music cd.  I cannot rave highly enough about them!  My 2 year old has learned so many signs in 2 weeks... dog, cat, hot, cold, full, more, ball, mom, dad, boy, girl, banana, milk, day, sun, night, moon, stars, hurt, sad, play, dirty, clean, and several more in just a matter of 2 weeks.  My baby (9 months) started signing milk when he wants to nurse and also dog.  They both really enjoy the videos... the music is lively and my husband and I even enjoy the creators lovely voice.  It is not overstimulating but will not bore you either.  The signs are repeated for easy memorization... there is an adult on it that shows the proper way to do the sign as well as children following throughout the scenarios.  All I can say is Thank you to the creator of these videos because they are wonderful!  I can't wait till the next one is released!

On a side note... before making a purchase, we reviewed many different signing videos that we were able to view on loan through the library and were very discouraged with them all until we found this series.  Often the signs were not clear on the correct way to do them.  The scenarios were often unrelated in several videos and had no repetition to aid in memorization.

If you choose this set, you won't be disappointed!!!!!",1096934400,2,1321,4.413223140495868
1876518,5,B000090W7H,"This is mainly directed towards hearing children. I am amazed at how quickly my two children (ages 3 and 4) picked up on many of these signs and use them daily.
There is a word shown on the screen (mother, for example) and then the lady demonstrates the sign with a description of the sign (you touch your thumb to your chin). Then you see many mothers and many kids signing mother.
This one has a lot of songs on it and they are fun songs too.
This is well worth the money and very fun.
Enjoy.",1089417600,16,494,4.103092783505154
1876519,5,B000090W7H,"My son has a birth defect that causes speech delay.  He had been going to speech therapy for months in which they were trying to teach him sign so he could communicate in some way until he could speak. Months and month he didn't sign one word until we bought the signing time videos, the next day he was signing and is now up to 40 signs in 2 months and still going strong!  He is so happy to be communicating and he thinks it is fun! I highly recommend these videos to EVERY parent, my husband and I love to watch them to and the music is awesome!!!!",1077148800,3,551,4.045871559633028
1876520,5,B000090W7H,"Of these videos in the ""Signing Time!"" series, this one has the most signs and the most songs.  (""Music? In a sign lanaguage video?"" Yes, this is a sign language video for hearing childern! There is even an audio CD of the music.) The ""Silly Pizza"" song uses repetition (in a very fun way) to reinforce a number of signs.
This video can be enjoyed over and over again by both children and adults. The music is a kind of light/folky rock that appeals to both age groups.
[small side point: not much ethnic diversity in the cast. Also, in these videos boys don't play with dolls. They do play football, however.]",1070582400,2,610,4.446428571428571

1876537,5,B000090W7H,"Can't say enough about signing time. These videos are amazing. Started my son at 12mos old and by 18mos old he knew over 30signs. This dramatically reduced his (and our) frustrations, raised his sense of pride, and just allowed us to know and understand our child so much more. He's now 2.5yrs old and speaking quite well. Learning sign didn't slow his actual speech at all. In fact, his speech therapist feels he's ahead intellectually and expressively because of his early signing. Can't say enough about signing time. We own four DVDs.
Just for reference, we began signing to help make up for a speech delay which was due to our son having a tracheostomy from age 1week to 6 mo old (Pierre robin). Would recommend for all children. An amazing way to understand them early and effectively.",1449964800,3,791,4.739130434782608

1876577,5,B000090W7H,"My husband and I highly recommend the Signing Time videos to anyone who is interested.  This video mezmerized my son from age 4 months.  He loved the combination of songs, children, colors, cartoons and Rachel's voice (I think).  We learned quite a lot of signs and used them for quite a while with our son.  We ended up purchasing three of the videos in this series.  It made communication much easier with both of our children, before they were capable full-on talkers.  We STILL use some of the signs!  (And my kids are now 3 and 5 years old)  The signs are intuitive, for the most part, and very easy to learn.  Right now, I could probably accurately sign at least 40 words.

He's 17 mos now and daycare wonders if he's such a happy kid because he has several avenues for communication.

He absolutely loves, loves, loves them. He wants to watch them all the time and he is actually learning and using the signs he see on the DVD. It is also helpful for the parents and grandparents to get the hang of using the signs. It's not as annoying as many children's videos, but let's face it, watching anything 16x a day is annoying!

1876602,3,B000090W7H,"Yes, I might be a bit of a health-food nut, at least when it comes to my preschooler and teaching habits. I love learning new signs with her. When our local library had the Signing Time Volume 3 DVD I looked at the back to see what it had to say.

""Everyday Signs teaches signs for favorite foods and everyday life."" (I guess that should have been my clue) and it went on to give examples on the back.

""Apple, banana, cracker, full, hot, cold, help, day, night, sad, happy and many more."" Had it said ""cookie, ice cream, and candy"" I would have left it on the shelf. Really, do we need to see a picture of a baby (couldn't have been more than 12 months) chowing down a cookie? Not everyone cares about establishing healthy eating habits in the same way, but for those that do this just isn't the video to watch.

The kids are cute to watch (engaging) and they have some real video footage (child playing with a hose, ducks in water, etc. to show ""wet"") versus all animation, which I appreaciate. I do like the ""Goodnight song"" it's sweet, but there's quite a few montages of sleeping kids and not as much signing during that song. Also, the woman's verbal description of the signs is usually pretty helpful, too. I do wish after watching the kids sign that the woman would come back on and re-do the sign again, since the kids' versions usually differ a bit from an adult's.

I just wonder if we started showing kids pictures of other kids eating less junk food and more fruits and vegetables if that could help alter their views on eating their veggies. A DVD like this could have chosen to showcase healthier foods that kids eat (although I realize that's not its express purpose). Merely my opinion.

I prefer to watch the YouTube videos for [...]. I think they have better signing descriptions, go slower in showing the signs, and repeat it more often.",1345680000,,1857,4.45

1876604,5,B000090W7H,"My daughter just tuned 2 and has a significant speech delay. It's been very frustrating for her and us. She works with a speech therapist but just doesn't want to talk. I bought this DVD out of desperation. It took me months to teach her one sign (more) so I hoped with the help of a fun show she could learn more signs.

We've been watching it every day for 3 weeks and yesterday we gave her an apple and she signed apple! I could have cried! Then today she signed cookie and cereal! It sounds so insignificant but when your toddler can't talk, ANY kind of communication is major. We are absolutely thrilled!

UPDATE 8/20/13: Since writing this review my daughter was diagnosed with autism. Her speech was very slow to progress and signing was an invaluable tool to communicate her wants and needs until the words finally came. Now she is 3 and still enjoys watching with her neurotypical 2-year-old brother who also used signs until he could speak. Both kids have loved showing off their signing skills.

The neat thing is that using the flash cards and the videos I have taught Grandpa to use sign as well as my niece who is my ""mom's helper"". These babies were preemies (born 10 weeks early) and when the littlest guy signed more,milk and food I almost burst into tears! This happened when he was almost exactly one year old and it is awesome to be able to communicate with these little guys. Yes, the signs aren't perfectly executed but it's understandable. Each time I ask them something I use the sign for it as well as speak the word. "" Do you want to eat?"" then bring my fingers to my mouth. ""Milk"" and use the sign...I have been doing this since they were sitting in the high chair at about 6 months and it took 6 months for them to try to make the sign so patience is a virtue here, folks! I am just about to buy Signing Time 3 & 4 because I have always used the DVD's at the parents house and now that I have my own grandkids I want my own copies or all of us to use.

The video is wayyy too busy - too much loud, fast music.  I do not like the way the signs are presented either - I feel that the presentation of sign, picture and word is effective, but this video doesn't do that.  It puts up a cartoon picture of the item with the word then shows the sign and then jumps to people/babies/children doing the sign while fast music is playing and the narrator sings.  ugh.
While my 14 month old has sat perfectly still and been glued to the Einstein sign video for months now, this Signing Time video has yet to keep her attention for more than a few minutes at a time. She loves sign language and uses the ones she knows daily (I also know sign language, so I teach her beyond the videos as well - but the video idea is nice for 'down time')

We will continue to use this video since I have not seen any other good ones out there.

UPDATE 2/2/09 - While this video is still a bit annoying to me, my little girl has decided now that she is interesed in it!  The past few days she has brought me the movie and then run to her chair to watch it. (she's done the same with the Baby Signing Time video recently)  I am very glad that she is liking this video b/c I am excited about her learning the new signs.  I may even end up buying another from this series after all :)

Update (9-30-09)  Ok, so i've given in and we have the ENTIRE collection of these videos.  Now that my little one is bigger (she's almost 2), they are not as 'busy' and she really does love ""akee and leah"" - she knows the signs in ALL of the videos and tells me exactly which volume she wants to watch and she does every sign many times before it even comes on the screen b/c she's watched them all so many times!

It contains many of the signs that you would use when beginning to teach your young child to sign and communicate with you about all the every day things in his environment.  The repetition is just perfect for those little learners to take in the words and signs (and perfect for mommy and daddy to follow along, too).

We first bought Baby See 'n Sign (don't waste the money) and he wouldn't even pay attention to them. I couldn't even stand watching them, extremely boring and a lot of the signs are not correct ASL. Then we went to 'Baby Signs'...excellent, great for beginners, easy for babys to relate to Bebo the bear and the characters, however not enough signs on each video otherwise I would have kept buying them. I decided to try the 'Signing Time' series and he really enjoys watching them. He even does the sign and says the word with Leah & Alex. He will watch a whole video. I really like the review section for my husband and I because we don't always get to watch the entire video (cooking dinner etc).

1876670,5,B000090W7H,"As the mother of twins, one hearing and one deaf, I have had the opportunity to check out many programs for teaching ASL to small children.  This is by far the best series out there.  Most other products are so boring that parents must struggle to stay awake during the production, and there is no way a toddler would tolerate a viewing.  My 2-year-old twins request Signing Time all of the time.  At home they want the DVDs playing almost constantly.  In the car my hearing daughter starts asking for the Signing Time CD before I even have her strapped into her carseat.  My 2-year-old deaf daughter is using 5-sign sentences, which is almost unheard of for the deaf child of hearing parents.  My extended family owns a total of 6 sets of Signing Time.  Whenever my daughters' cousins have a birthday they ask for the latest Signing Time DVDs.  Children of all ages love this product.",1148860800,,885,4.585987261146497

Now everyday she signs ""milk"" and points to the TV asking for a signing video.  I told her no a couple of days ago and she signed ""cry."" The songs are catchy and won't drive you insane after hearing them for the upteenth time unlike the ones sung by a certain purple dinosaur. I highly recommend these videos for their educational and entertainment value.",1137196800,,477,4.523255813953488
1876672,3,B000090W7H,"I was surprised to find the negative review on this DVD. They brought it back because it signed ""Candy"", ""Cookie"", and ""Ice Cream""!

I just want to say this. I have a child with autism. These DVD's have greatly helped her to communicate with us. Having signs that are motivating for her to use is important. If a child can ask for a ""Cookie"" that is very powerful for a 2.5 yr old.

In the beginning, I don't think I could have gotten my child to sign ""Liver""...  ""More Liver Please Mom."" or ""Lima Beans"".  You get the picture. Children learn when it's motivating to them.  I'm not trying to put the other reviewer down. I just felt the need to address an important subject. I am suprised that she didn't see the 'value' from her child's eyes. They could have learned a whole new language.",1135209600,,789,4.376712328767123
1876673,5,B000090W7H,"What a wonderful DVD!  The songs are catchy, the colors are bright, the words are perfect for a toddler/preschooler, Rachel is engaging in her facial expressions and her signs are easily understandable for parents to learn and reinforce with their children. The children's voices throughout the DVD capture my daughter's attention and because each word is signed by multiple kids and Rachel - it allows our daughter to try it herself!

I think best of all is that my curiosity of Rachel and Emilie led me to search out their own story on the net and this DVD set is really a labor of love since Leah (the little girl in the DVD) is Rachel's daughter and she was born deaf.  Rachel had been a singer/songwriter in a band and she put everything on hold to learn ASL for herself and her child/family.  This DVD collection is her hope to enable many young children to learn ASL and not avoid deaf children they come in contact with on the playground, at the schoolyard etc.  Like all parents, it's hard to see other children ignore our own child. This DVD will hopefully allow Leah and other deaf children an avenue to communicate with new friends.",1131408000,3,1144,4.588235294117647

The DVD reinforces her therapy time at home AND helps Grandma and Grandpa to learn the signs for when we are called on to care for our granddaughter. This way of learning is SO EASY.We LOVE it!",1128729600,3,373,4.582089552238806
1876675,5,B000090W7H,"I originally bought these because I wanted to have more visual learning tools for signing... just because we heard it was helpful in teaching infants and toddlers how to communicate before they can speak. They are the ONLY videos that can catch my 13 month old's attention. When he hears ""It's signing time with Alex and Leah""....he stops and runs to the TV. These videos give us more of a desire to continue teaching our son to sign. In 2 month, he knows the sign for tree, apple, bannana, eat/food, fruit.... I can go on and on. Let's just say, he is not screaming anymore because he wants something... he just points, mumbles AAH-P-O (for apple) and puts his hand on his cheek. Volume 3: Everyday Signs is by far our favorite. For my son mainly because it signs APPLE, BANANA, BREAD & CHEESE.. all his favorite things. The pizza song IS FUNNY, and you DO hear it in your sleep and you DO wish you could keep up!!

In a nut shell, we LOVE LOVE LOVE them. A MUST BUY, even if you are not that into signing, it's still nice when your child can learn some sign and some cool songs.",1128470400,,1080,4.320197044334975
1876676,5,B000090W7H,"I have 2 kids, who are 2.5 and 11 months.  This video is NOT geared towards babies.  All of the signs are standard ASL, which is good, but it makes them a bit difficult for a baby without coordination to learn.  Babies also tend to lack the focus to sit there and watch a video.  My son won't even look at the tv.  This is a good video to teach YOU some ASL to teach your baby (or you can get an ASL dictionary and do it yourself).  I did Baby Signs with my daughter when she wasn't talking yet, and used the board books, which I highly recommend.  She's forgotten all of her baby signs but she's picked up the real ASL very quickly from this video, as a preschooler.

For teaching a toddler age 2 or older ASL, it is GREAT.  My daughter really likes watching the video and she will mimic the signs and do them later.  She is in a phase right now where she likes to tell me who is a boy and who is a girl, so the ""I'm a boy/I'm a girl!"" song is fabulous.  Very catchy and you'll be humming it to yourself.  Same with the Silly Pizza song.  And the Signing time with Alex and Leah song I get stuck in my head constantly.  So it does have good entertainment value as well as educational value for the preschool age set.

I wanted a pretty general video for teaching some ASL signs because these DVDs run $21 and I didn't want to buy the whole series (yet), so I thought this one would have a good enough useful variety.  I liked this video better than the 1st one of the series (which I got from the library), so if you're trying to decide between the two and just get 1, I'd recommend this one.

(and for the person who didn't like them teaching ""ice cream"" and ""candy""... guess what are the favorite signs of a toddler? :-)  They'll sign what interests them the most, and if they sign ""candy!"" to you, you can always sign ""no!"" back! :-D",1127433600,40,1837,4.098039215686274

We have found as parents that using this language we also have many more hours of focused time with both our daughters.  When she was 10 months old she was overjoyed that she could share with us the fact that she had seen a picture of a dog on the wall in a cafe.  With ""Signing time 3"" she is equally as keen to share with us this fun means of communication as with the earlier videos.  ""Signing Time 2"" seems to have marginally more complex issues which she doesn't seem to grasp as easily (maybe that is just our daughter) but from our experience I would recommend you buy #1 then #3 then #2.  Rachael's songs are great, in #1 she's a little stiff (but still good) but bear with her because everything gets infinitely better thereafter.  We bought #5 (ABC's) for our own enjoyment before our toddler would be interested in it, and we can't wait to see #4.  All in all, life enriching.",1126483200,3,1082,4.326732673267327

Well, after watching the videos for 1 week, she had picked up 15 signs with the clear spoken word to match! by the end of 5 weeks, she could speak and sign all 100 or so signs from the set! (I also have a 4 1/2 yr old who has also improved with these videos. Plus, my 7 month old daughter is often enthralled with them. She recognizes the sign for ""milk"" and gets excited when we sign it!)

My husband is Deaf, so we do use sign at home, but she refused to pick up EITHER language. These videos provided a way for her to communicate! Now she is picking up the signs/words from Vol 4-6 just as quickly, and she is stringing words and signs together.

The songs are so fun! You will be singing them even if there are no kids around! I love these videos and what they have given to my daughter!! :)

The videos reinforced what I was already teaching her. After a couple of weeks of watching the videos her signing exploded! She was eager to learn new signs that it was hard keeping up with her. The videos are so well constructed that my daughter learned to recognize the words on the screen, meaning she could say the word and do the sign for it even before they did. My goal was for my daughter to be able to communicate with me before she could verbalize her wants and needs. With the help of these videos we achieved that. We couldn't wait for new videos to come out as she had mastered all the signs on the first 3 videos within the first 6 months. Now we are moving on to expanding our ASL and will buy volumes 4-6.

I can't wait to see all the other dvds that have recently been released.  I'd have to say my family has become ""addicted to Signing Time"" dvds!!!  We love them and just can't seem to get enough!

We knew we wanted to teach ASL as a 2nd language because of the many benefits such as earlier communication. You can communicate with your baby as young as 8 months old, maybe even younger. What a gift to know what your child needs before they can tell you with spoken words! For more information on the benefits of ASL check out the Signing Time website at [...]

We love this volume of Signing Time. The songs are wonderful and work very well in a school setting as well as at home. The songs are very catchy so you will find they get stuck in your head. Alex and Leah do a great job. We love to see the 2 friends/cousins interacting together. In this volume we learn words like hungry, happy and lots of food signs. My kids love to be able to ask with signs for more cheese please. Or to tell me with signs that they are hungry or thirsty or happy. The silly pizza song is so funny. You will hear it in your sleep and wish that you could keep up with the fast pace of the signs. Hopefully I will be able to someday if I keep practicing.

We like that the written word comes on the screen first and then they show the sign. It is very helpful for practicing the signs. It is like a video flashcard. It also helps children develop reading skills because they start to recognize the written word that goes with the sign. We love watching the children do the signs because you see lots of different kids and lots of different skill levels. It gives you an idea of how your child might make the sign at different ages. Rachel also does the sign so you can clearly see the proper way to do it.

The song during the credits is a great way to learn additional signs that were not covered in the show. You can really add to your signing vocabulary if you pay attention.

I highly recommend this volume of signing time as well as the other 5 in the series. As a mother and a teacher I can say it is truly the best educational tool I have found for teaching ASL to children (and adults too). I hope they make many more and I will buy them all without hesitation.

1876693,5,B000090W7H,"If you are wondering about a great video for your toddler or child to watch, this is it!

Volume 3 introduces more basic signs, Everyday Signs.  These include some food signs, a couple emotions, and more.  The songs are very captivating and teach even more signs.

Signing Time is a great way to introduce children to a second language, ASL.  It is also the perfect way for babies to communicate before they develop speech.  I can't count the times we've prevented a temper tantrum!  These videos have really given my daughter confidence because she knows she can use signs to tell us what she wants, even when she does not know the word or cannot yet speak it clearly.  These videos have also given us a great way to communicate with my young cousin who is disabled, and any Deaf people we may meet.",1104364800,2,800,4.506944444444445
1876694,5,B000090W7H,"I cannot say enough about the positive messages that are taught in the Signing Time series! Everyday Signs impresses me everytime I watch it! My son has learned to sign happy, sad, night and day along with many others! For a 23 month old I am very proud. He not only can sign them, but understands them and uses them correctly! I am still amazed everyday that I am able to communicate with my toddler and thrilled he can express his feeling! I have raised another child without signing (she is now 18 years old) and this has been a godsend!!!",1104278400,,542,4.376237623762377
1876695,5,B000090W7H,"This DVD and CD (the whole set of 6, actually) opened the door to new communication with my nondisabled 6 year old, who loved having a ""secret language"", my nondisabled 2 year old nephew and my speech delayed 2 year old daughter,  I don't know how we ever got along without it!  A MUST HAVE for any parents interested in seeing what their child has to say!",1104278400,,356,4.298507462686567
7988422,5,B000090W7H,Daughter is 12 and we bought this to home in our all our signs (logged in over 400 so far).  I definitely recommend this entire series...we have many Signing Times.  Rachel wears the tape on her fingers only to help the audience visually SEE her signs better. (I get asked that question a lot).  Have fun and enjoy!  We've been at it for 10 years...this family of 4 loves Signing Times.,1518307200,,386,4.394366197183099
7988423,5,B000090W7H,"The quality of the lessons is superb and well-timed, repeated enough that I was satisfied with my retention rate. The production is really well done - from the repetition of the children signing, the clarity of the instructor, and the different examples. My 17-month old focuses on these with no problem.",1516320000,,304,4.980392156862745

7988426,2,B000090W7H,"Disappointing. We enjoyed Volume 1 so much, but this edition is not nearly as good. The cartoon images are dark and confusing for young children. We also don't like how they don't have as many images of children actually interacting in real-life with whatever signs they're using. In Volume 1, when the kids sign ""Dog,"" they would often be next to their dog making that sign. This kind of association is very helpful for kids. But unfortunately in Volume 3, they have kids who look very bored in a school classroom making signs. So not only are there fewer associations, but the kids don't look interested at all in doing them. I'm sorry for giving the harsh review, as we loved Volume 1. But this was so disappointing.",1496793600,,719,4.625

7988431,4,B000090W7H,I still LOVE the series for my son (18 months) but it loses points because it dropped its bi-lingual (Spanish influence) appeal. I liked the thought of my son studying 3 languages with this single video.,1474329600,,203,4.666666666666667
