8545242,4,B009YI3KNS,Witchouse Trilogy is about Lilith a witch murdered by townsfolk. In all three movies she returns to react revenge on some poor souls. The first two are far superior since they are not soft core porn like the third. The best of them all is the sequel Witchouse Blood Coven. Decent special effects for  Full Moon Picture and an twisted plot involving injecting witch DNA into college students. If your a fan of horror make sure you pick this up.,1397520000,6,443,4.5375
