6107683,5,B00GSMZ3I8,I cannot wait for this to release! I never thought in a million years this would see the light of day. I hope that each episode has the intro and ending included and it's not just something that's in the menu screen. but I used to love watching this as a kid and would sit up late and watch it and tales from the crypt. tales from the crypt was the better show IMO but monsters had it's charm.,1388620800,5,393,3.9873417721518987
6107684,5,B00GSMZ3I8,"This is an excellent 80's tv series! If you loved watching ""Tales from the Darkside"" the tv series in the 80's, then you'll enjoy this just as much! It's more scarier and as the name indicates there's actually some unique monster in each episode!

It's a great tv series & interestingly enough, you can't always figure out the ending of each episode like you could with ""Tales from the Darkside,"" because in this series sometimes the good guys win and sometimes they lose.

Very unique & fun tv series & great stories too!

For the price, you simply can't go wrong with choosing to buy this anthology tv series!

So, if you enjoy watching 80's anthology tv series that include sci-fiction, and horror combined, then you'll most likely enjoy this tv series too!",1387843200,11,760,4.69172932330827
6107685,5,B00GSMZ3I8,"So excited to hear this excellent horror anthology series is finally coming to dvd (although a blu ray set would blow my mind!). Just wondering if anybody knows whether or not the rights to the original soundtrack have been secured for this release. They had to change most of the music for the Tales from the Darkside DVDs (same producers), which actually wasn't as bad as it sounds. The new music was surprisingly faithful to the series...but of course the original music would be ideal...",1385596800,10,491,4.788235294117647
6107686,5,B00GSMZ3I8,"Durring the late 80's/early 90's, horror anthology TV shows were all the rage. You had show's like Tales From The Darkside, Friday The 13th: The Series and Freddy's Nightmare's all doing well with their respective airings....it was only natural that a show like Monsters would thrive and become a hit and absolute cult classic of the genre. As a kid, nothing was better on a Saturday night than grabbing some popcorn and soda, turning off all the lights, slipping under the covers and tuning in to back to back airings of both Tales From The Darkside and Monsters. The show was cutting edge for it's time with a good amount of gore and violence being shown, and despite the show's low budget, the make-up effects were really well done. In my personal opinion, Monsters was darker in tone that Tales From The Darkside, although Monsters had a few lighthearted episodes. All in all, I give this series a 10/10 for being such an entertaining horror show, for being scary for it's time, and for being one hell of a fun time. If you're a horror fan, do yourself a favor and pick up this great set.....you won't regret it.",1385510400,61,1116,4.613065326633166

6107698,5,B00GSMZ3I8,"I had a dream recently, well, it was more like a nightmare, really.
In the dream I woke up from sleeping after only two hours rest and my first thought while swinging my legs out of bed was that I had better grab my Monsters dvd boxset and head over to a friend's house to introduce them to the show. I was wearing a bathrobe, for some reason, which is strange to me because I have never, nor do I intend on, ever owning one. I grabbed my Monsters boxset and headed out the door, panicked and sweating.

The moment I stepped outside everything slowed down. It went from being somewhere in the 2010's to like the late 1800's.
 Everything was badly lit, primitive, and confusing.
  ""Clippity clop, clippity clop"" , the sound of hooves approaching me. I looked up to find a stage coach approaching me.
 While I was distracted, the most elderly man I have ever laid eyes upon bashed me in the back of my left leg with a cane, causing me to drop my boxset. He snatched it up and held it in his wrinkled liver-spotted hands. Just then three men, all seven foot tall and at least three hundred pounds a piece, picked me up violently and held my arms behind my back as the stage coach arrived.
I couldn't understand why but I sensed that when the stage coach finally stopped it was going to bring something so ominous to my life it was unfathomable. Everything was moving in slow motion, each second passing felt the equivalent of ten seconds in my mind.
The stage coach stopped. Nothing happened for a moment.
A small woman in a grilling apron that read ""I eat BBQ, Therefore I AM"" crept out of an alleyway in measured strides. She approached the door of the stage coach, she turned and smiled at me, eyes gleaming like a vulture in the Arizona sun. She opened the door, and before the door was halfway open was when I felt a terror comparable to a parent losing their child in a crowded shopping mall.

Romaine lettuce came spilling out of the inside of the wagon. Forcefully and relentlessly it poured out like blood from a hammer-pierced skull.
 I have always hated lettuce, especially romaine lettuce. In my heart of hearts I had always told myself I'd rather be in the place of Paul Sheldon in the movie Misery where Kathy Bates character hobbles his ankles with a sledgehammer than to suffer the cruel fate of a ranch dressing laden snack or salad. The anxiety and fear in me created an upward thrusting tidal wave of acid reflux bile that caressed my teeth with violent finesse.

 The most elderly man alive on all the earth held my Monsters boxset in plain view while the 7 foot tall men held me still. In garbled slowed down speak he said ""We intend on liberating this boxset for, shall we say, safe keeping. But I mean to inform you, we do not TAKE from anyone. You will GIVE us this boxset freely, of your own volition. Of course, if you don't, my friends there could force feed you some of that Romaine Lettuce and maybe crack a few of your ribs while they're at it"". A strong elbow to my ribcage came directly afterwards, I fell forward seeing stars and struggling to breathe. Right then another one of the thugs grabbed me by the hair and shoved a large handful of the lettuce in my mouth, causing me to forcefully vomit.
 ""It's not often that we get to watch mostly obscure shows that are reminiscent of Tales From The Crypt, and Tales From The Darkside around these parts, mister."" said one of the 7 foot tall guys. Which confused me, because I was fairly certain that there was no tv, vcr's, DVD players, or any shows at all in the 1800's, so how could these hicks have possibly seen Tales From The Crypt or anything else like that ?
I knew I had to come to a decision. I thought about it a moment and with a defiant expression on my face I told them ""No, I won't do it. That was kind of a pricey boxset and I happen to love the show. Its weird as hell, and I just can't part with it, not now, not EVER.""

 I felt a very aggressive blow to the back of the head and fell unconscious. When I woke up after who knows how long unconscious I was laying beside the covered wagon and had no feeling in my arms, they were covered in blood. I also couldn't move them.
 They had ran over my arms with the stage coach for me not giving them my Monsters boxset.
 Now they looked completely enraged. - ""How many times are we going to have to tell you city folks ? We don't take kindly to strangers that won't give us their rare short horror story boxsets free of charge.""
 He turned to one of the tall men and said ""Esther, feed him some of that lettuce, the brown wilted pieces.""
 ""NOOOOO"" I cried, trying to hold back tears. All three tall men grabbed me, held me down and forced me to eat a considerable amount of lettuce, advising me to hold it down this time. I did what I was told.
""Now we're going to ask you just one more time, mister. Can we have this rare horror dvd boxset of incredibly interesting and weird as hell short horror stories?? Will you give it to us???""
 ""I'd rather start a large family with Glenn Close"" I shouted in anger.
 ""Back her up then,Boyd"" the elderly man said to whoever was driving the stage coach.
 They then proceeded to slowly run my legs over with the covered wagon. Then they doubled back around and ran them over again.
 I promised myself I would rather be killed than give up on my cool little boxset. At that moment I saw myself from outside my body, I seemed to be bleeding from my head. I woke up shortly thereafter and found that I had passed out beneath the drink cooler at work again and it had been leaking on my head.
I am like the apostles in the Bible preaching the good word about this show, about all shows that are weird and insane and have short horror stories that are disarranged inside the skull. Buy it now or you'll be transported to a time before cellphones or phone books and you will perish in a land with no comfort or fun !!!",1507075200,,5890,4.284428442844284

6107703,4,B00GSMZ3I8,"Monsters isn't great television, and for anyone who didn't grow up in the 80s, it might be a chore to sit through. That said, if you did grow up in the 80s and enjoy campy horror, then this might be for you. I remember watching Monsters on Saturday nights at 1030 when I was a kid. The show didn't scare me then, and it doesn't scare me now, but there are some episodes that certainly stick with you. I prefer the straight horror over the humorous episodes because of the low budget. I've enjoyed the set so far, and I'm happy with the transfers. They look far better than the Newhart series from Shout Factory, which was also an 80s series.

So, if you grew up with this show or have a taste for 80s camp, then dive in. There's a lot to enjoy.",1499212800,,744,4.166666666666667

6107715,5,B00GSMZ3I8,"'Monsters' brings back that 80s feel, when little threat plagued the world...At least, not as much. There was still a sense of freedom that has been forcefully removed, a sense of feeling 'carefree' and a bit silly. The format of this old show is good, though has no extras or interviews. Outside of that, it offers this anthology show as it was aired in the 80s.

Add this to your other 1980s collections, like Tales from the Darkside; Tales from the Crypt and Friday the 13th: The Series.",1484438400,,490,4.568181818181818

6107739,3,B00GSMZ3I8,"When I bought this series I mostly decided to purchase it for two reasons. 1. It was a kind of 'spin-off' of Tales from the Darkside (which I enjoyed) and 2. for nostalgia. I admit I didn't remember the show very well from its original airing in the late 1980s so I wasn't sure what I was purchasing. However now that I have finished the series all the way through I can definitely say that this series is not at all like I remembered. I truly thought that the production values were exceedingly low. The first season episodes were all on film. Then beginning in the second season through the third it was done on videotape. Just that alone takes a lot away from the way the show looks and feels. Watching these episodes was almost like watching the special features of a movie. It looked too 'live' and staged. This is usually done to save money on production costs. Also, the stories were not particularly well written and had very strange endings that, to me, didn't make much sense. I also felt this look really made the acting look worse than it was.
As I said before, I didn't remember the show well when I first bought it so that is my own fault. It is a trip down memory lane for nostalgia purposes. I do want to keep it as the companion for 'Tales from the Darkside'. But I will just say that it is a very substandard series in my opinion. I would recommend it mostly to those who either enjoy watching 80s style programs and if you are a collector and need to complete the TFTDS series. That is why I give it the 3 stars. I would not recommend it to anyone who is looking for a high quality monster series. This was aired before any kind of computer effects so that needs to be mentioned as to why many of the monsters look so cheesy in today's world of realism on TV. But no matter how I look at it, I am not very pleased with the series as a whole. I believe it could have been much better even with the special effects they had at that time.
If anyone remembers the original 'Outer Limits' series from the 60s I would say most of their monsters were much better than this program which was aired over 20 years later. But, of course, this is my own opinion based on watching the entire series.",1455148800,3,2205,4.252380952380952

6107743,2,B00GSMZ3I8,Each episode is twenty minutes of boring material. You know how the episode is going to end in the first 3 minutes and then you sit thru talk and the last two minutes comes the monster climax. I have not seen every episode but their all about the same dragging dialoge. Its like lets get the episode over. Its like watching Night Gallery when they had the 3 minute short stories but here the story last 20 minutes.,1451952000,,414,4.32051282051282

6107751,5,B00GSMZ3I8,I really like this DVD collection of episodes.  The series puts a light hearted humorous spin on scary episodes.  The 1960's were known for putting humor into horror on different TV shows....The Munster's and The Adam's Family come to mind.  I would recommend to anyone getting this DVD collection if you like humorous light hearted horror.  A lot of the same actors and actresses are in this series as were in so many from Tales from the Darkside.  Same producer/directors/casting agents!  Absolutely no gory stuff on these episodes either.  All in good fun!,1442448000,2,559,4.946236559139785

6107753,4,B00GSMZ3I8,"If you grew up watching this program, it will bring back memories of the era in which the horror television series thrived.  (If you didn't, I doubt ""Monsters"" would do much for you.)  As with most anthologies, there are both good episodes and bad.  It was enjoyable to see most of these shows again, to note the youth of many of the better-known guest stars, be amused by the campy story lines, and reflect on how mostly cheesy & low-budget the monsters and sets were, an aspect that for a myriad of reasons, wasn't always so evident, or even glaring, at the time. Still, there is a lot of originality and rough charm that makes this collection a classic.  I was surprised to find a few episodes I had never seen before, as I recall watching re-runs.  I have a couple favorites, such as ""Pool Sharks"" and ""Bug House.""  I think ""Monsters"" at its best is witty or unsettling, rather than truly funny or frightening.  Overall, this anthology didn't hold up as well for me as I hoped it would, but the nostalgic aspect mostly made up for it .",1440374400,,1039,4.436842105263158

It has all of the episodes on nine DVDs presented in a basic but presentable box with inserts for each DVD set. For fans of this TV series, it will bring back fond memories of watching this when it was broadcasted.

Keep in mind, the monsters in the series aren't the high quality props you see in today's shows or movies but they're still fun to watch. Many of the episodes are kind of campy but that's what made this series fun. There's no CGI monsters in these videos since they were made back in the 80's and early 90's. However,  I adore the physical nature of the monsters and effects and this series is a must have for people who enjoyed sci-fi/fantasy back in that era.

The DVD's are well packaged in a manner that prevents them easily being damaged. The video and sound quality were easily 8 out of possible 10. there is no fading or lost sound quality.  These DVD's were not remaster to absolute perfection but they are eminately watchable. The stories are good if a little dated but they carry their age well.

The ''monsters'' look like something some amateur spent about 15 minutes with $25 worth of stuff from the crafts section at Walmart creating. The acting is awful. I hope they didn't pay the writers for this series much. I've seen better dialogue in comic books. If you are easily entertained and bored to tears and desperate for something to watch this series is for you. I guess maybe if you were a kid in the 1980's and would like to watch the shows for a little reminiscing then go ahead. I was disappointed.,1428192000,6,554,4.4950495049504955

The transfers are pretty good and the show hasn't looked this good in years. There are no real ""extras"" to speak of, but the packaging is nice and you get each and every episode of the show, which is the most important part anyway.

I have been a fan of 'Monsters' since I was a kid. Along with shows like 'Tales From the Crypt', 'Tales From the Darkside', 'The Twilight Zone (80's), 'Are You Afraid of the Dark?', 'Amazing Stories', and 'Erie, Indiana', 'Monsters' was a show I looked forward to watching each and every week.

6107797,2,B00GSMZ3I8,"I'm puzzled by the popularity of this show. All the episodes take place basically from start to finish in a room, usually a house, sometimes a lab, an office , a jail but there is never any outdoor scenes, no scenery, no chases, everything is indoors,there is very little difference from one show to the next, just 20 minutes of talking and no action. It's as if they used the same 4 or 5 sets each time and just changed the furniture around. Oh there were a few good episodes, like the one with Steve Buscemi and it was fun seeing some old favorite long time actors again, maybe 30 years after their prime, like Troy Donahue, who was hardly recognizable, and Darren McGavin, David McCallum without his long beatle style haircut, Barbara Billingsley, Adrienne Barbeau, Linda Blair and some others but I found all the episodes following more or less the same routine, whenever there was a monster, it was usually shown at the end or only on for 1 - 3 minutes, and most of the monsters looked just like actors with heavy makeup, or lots of hair, or wearing a mask or costume, like something you would see at a halloween party, and once in a while, when they did use a creature, it looked more like a muppet than something alive.

So I'm quite disappointed with this series, when it was originally on TV, I saw a few episodes in the first season, and seeing the list of guest stars was the reason I bought it. But certainly for me, most of these episodes are forgettable, it's just all talk and no action, no suspense, too much silly humot, I don't want sitcom humor in what is supposed to be a scary show, there is very little thrills in this series, because the whole series takes place inside a room in every episode, there is no variety. It's as if more money was probably spent on the commercials that on each episode, thay look like one act plays. Usually the most fun part is the opening credits with the family sitting in front of the television waiting for the show to start. Anyone who enjoys monsters would have a much better time with the 50's movies and any other anthology series like Twilight Zone, Outer Limits and even Goosebumps.",1404432000,8,2144,4.455470737913486

As the title of the show implies, each week there is a different creature at the heart of the story. Like all anthology series Monsters is uneven. When it is at its best the show is wonderfully entertaining. Many would compare it to Tales from the Crypt, Unlike Tales, Monsters has very little big name talent, and the special effects are fairly cheesy.

6107801,4,B00GSMZ3I8,My wife grew up loving this show.  Never heard of it until she made me watch a few.  Couldn't find the rest of the shows until the DVD set came out.  Kinda cheesy but it's something I was able to get into.,1401580800,2,205,3.8333333333333335
6107802,5,B00GSMZ3I8,"I grew up watching this show, I've only met very few people who remember this show and I was so excited when I saw this was finally being released on DVD, this is a very classic show and a lot of the special effects are great, yes some are cheesey but this is still a great show",1400630400,,278,3.8947368421052633
6107803,5,B00GSMZ3I8,"I'm glad they finally put this old school horror series on DVD to own. As a kid, I had memories of watching this series and loved it. Definitely beats all the reality TV crap out there that's killing quality, fun TV. Highly recommend this series for anyone who loves fun, campy, horror a la ""Tales from the Crypt,"" ""Twilight Zone,"" and ""Tales from the Darkside."" I wish TV series still were as original and entertaining as the late early 80's and early 90's.",1399507200,3,458,4.530120481927711
6107804,4,B00GSMZ3I8,Monsters dvd  takes me back to the good old days of tv. Yeah ! some of the episodes are silly but it's the 80's. Overall I'm happy that I could add it to my collection of Tales From The Darkside and Friday The 13th The Series.,1398729600,3,226,3.9130434782608696
6107805,5,B00GSMZ3I8,"I remember staying up late to watch this show. When I was a boy this was the show, monsters, cheap gore and good looking 80's women, what a simple time it was. It is alot like ""Tales from the Dark Side"" but I find it more creepy and campy. Some times the acting and directing is down right bad but that some how adds to the experience. It will transform you to another time.",1397692800,3,374,4.0675675675675675
6107806,5,B00GSMZ3I8,"I remember watching these every Friday night in the late 80's.  Still love them today.  Nice packaging, and a great trip back to the late 80's.  Richard P Rubinstein produced these, along with Tales from the Darkside.  Cheesy horror with a little humor.  Get these!",1397260800,5,265,4.8
6107807,5,B00GSMZ3I8,"Very good and complete collection brought back so memories :) definitely a must-have.

6107808,5,B00GSMZ3I8,"The 1988 classic show MONSTERS is finally available! After watching re-runs of it on Chiller for years and even owning ""special"" copies of it, I can't believe it's finally been released!

There's no special features here, but the show looks great and the packaging is slick. I definitely recommend picking up this set, because who knows how long it'll be around? Despite the lack of special features this is a definite pick-up for any fan of MONSTERS",1395878400,5,450,4.8441558441558445

The actors include Adrienne Barbeau, David McCallum, Gina Gershon, Darren McGavin, Pam Grier, Deborah Harry, Chris Noth, John Saxon, David Spade, Jerry Stiller, Lili Taylor, Linda Blair, Meat Loaf, Laraine Newman, and Steve Buscemi.

6107812,4,B00GSMZ3I8,"Mine arrived today and I have viewed the first 3 episodes. Monsters is exactly what I remembered. Late 80 late night television at it's campy creepy best. The re-master is probably exactly what you imagine given the time and technology of the production . It's not the best re-master  and darks can be more gray and colors are a tad uneven in the first 3 episodes but it is certainly viewable and enjoyable. Slip in a disk, turn out the lights and pull up the covers cause Monsters is gonna eatz you!!!",1394150400,14,502,4.456521739130435

6107814,5,B00GSMZ3I8,"I can't believe this is finally released! By the way, I'm the one who started the online petition at petitiononline.com several years ago, in 2005. I really didn't think we had enough signatures, compared to the TFDS petition which was about a little over 1,000. (Big thank you to that petition starter!) But thanks to all of your support and signatures, we finally have this! I just ordered this a moment ago, and can't wait until it arrives! Thank you all!

Just received Monsters today, and WOW! It's great! Picture quality is great, it is remastered! Also, what really makes me happy is the commercial bumpers are there, and the music is exactly the same as originally shown! This is really a great set, they did an awesome job on it! No extras on the dvds, but it really is the BEST tv dvd set I've ever bought!

8626799,5,B00GSMZ3I8,"I avoided this series for years because it looked silly, like a ""kids"" show.  After finally running out of other things on my shelf I tuned in for an episode (streaming) - after a couple of episodes in, I broke down and bought the disk set.  If you liked Tales from the Darkside and The New Twilight Zone then I would almost guarantee you will like this.  It's heavy on practical effects, some of which are ""low budget"" by today's standards.  I am tempted to think this series was developed to give young practical effects/makeup/prosthesis techs a steady venue to ply their trade and gain experience for the big league (mainstream movies etc.).  It has that mid-to-late eighties atmosphere that a lot of us treasure nostalgically.  The stories are imaginative, sometimes scary, sometimes just fun.",1529712000,,798,4.874074074074074
