1896353,5,B00009XN9D,"If you are fed up with this cold, uncaring and hectic world and don't use mind altering substances to escape reality, this is the best medicine.  You either remember this show and loved it so much that you want to take advantage of the DVD phenomena or you don't!  I love them all.  They are back from the war.  The dales have remained relatively unphased except for the unmentioned young men who might have gone and come back changed by the experience (or maybe not come back), but the series does not get into that much.  The animals and their owners are busy just living.  They are simple folk, they drink, they laugh, and the warmth and humor is what I need.  Just knowing that Carol Drinkwater was in her swan song as Helen was a bit unsettling, but the addition of the kids is nice.  If you have and love the first three series, you know you have to have this so just go for it.  What else is there, the slop that is on modern TV?",1186790400,13,936,4.213483146067416
1896354,5,B00009XN9D,Love the series. The specials just add to the rest of them.,1178928000,,59,4.0
1896355,1,B00009XN9D,Unable to review wrong DVD format Zone sent to Australia unable to play. Who can I change,1170288000,,89,4.294117647058823
1896356,5,B00009XN9D,I have read all of James Harriet's books and the actors truly personify the characters in the books.  It was wonderful to see print come to life on the television.  It was also nice to see the creativity of the author displayed as they did not deviate much from the original written form.  It was really great.,1168387200,4,310,4.4035087719298245
1896357,5,B00009XN9D,Highly recommended.  Warm and interesting stories from All Creatures Great and Small.  I just wish there were more of them on this DVD.  The price is much more affordable than the DVD sets.,1157328000,5,189,4.666666666666667
1896358,5,B00009XN9D,Bought this for my father and he loves it.  Apparently extremely humorous and poignant as well.  Highly recommended.,1140998400,4,116,5.388888888888889
1896359,4,B00009XN9D,Just a word of warning: this volume only contains two of the three ACG&S specials.,1134345600,26,82,4.533333333333333
1896360,4,B00009XN9D,"Well, we collected all the DVD box sets for the first 3 seasons of ""All Creatures Great & Small""& enjoyed them during many sittings. I wrote reviews for each set, cut & pasting the same main frame with sprinkles of information that made each season different. For this review on the 1983 & 1985 Specials, I will start afresh. I notice that most people rate the 3 box sets & this collection of Specials with a '5'. I normally save a '5' for a life changing experience, '4' for great entrainment, '3' for average, '2' for a good idea but flawed, & '1' for trash. Therefore I always gave the box sets a '4', though to learn a little veterinarian science could be a life changing experience. I am rating this DVD with a '4', but the 1983 & 1985 Specials are not up to par with the box sets. Maybe a '3-1/2' would have been better, but then again ""All Creatures Great & Small"" is never 'Average'.

The first box set (January 1978) started out rather slow because it took a while for the characters to blossom, or maybe it took us, an American viewer with his Russian wife, to get use to the British sound of our shared language, the typical British dry comedy mode, or the cultural framework. By the second box set (September 1978) the characters are in full swing & the series just flows with fantastic family entrainment. The third box set (January 1979) continues this mode but with more of a social consciousness due to the up coming World War Two. This last box set ends with James Herriot (played by Christopher Timothy) leaving his beloved small town Darrowby to join the R.A.F. to protect England from the Axis.

The 1983 Special shows James returning to the dales, entering an area unaffected by the war except for the men that left. Get ready for a surprise; following the books by Alf Wight, James has a son Jimmy (played by Oliver Wilson), whom he picks up with his wife Helen (played by Carol Drinkwater) to return to the practice. Siegfried Farnon (played by Robert Hardy), the main veterinarian & business partner, & Siegfried's brother Tristan Farnon (played by Peter Davison) is there to greet James with his growing family. Later Siegfried's old girlfriend returns to marry & Tristan gets a government veterinarian job. They all try out a new housekeeper that cooks worst than Tristan. Mrs. Pumphrey (played by Margaretta Scott) returns with her over stuffed dog Ticki Woo, whom she is trying to breed. All of these minor plots follow the main focus on James's readjustment to peacetime.

What is strange about this Special is that the actors seem to have lost that growing bond that made the series so wonderful. Also the music seems off & the production is more static: showing quick scenes that don't quite fit. By the middle of the Special, the actors & production come into focus & the joy of the series returns.

The 1985 Special shows another surprise, James & Helen now have a daughter Rosie (played by Rebecca Smith). Siegfried with a moustache has moved to a larger house because of his marriage & has given James' family the house beside the practice. Tristan returns to date a past girlfriend who has a father that is against drinking. James picks up a stray dog & makes it the family pet only to find the dog has an incurable disease. Tristan makes fun of the old practices while Siegfried gets some newer drug samples that he wants to try out. The funniest highlight is the clip after the ending.

One problem with the 1985 Special, there was a minor character, an Asian (maybe lower eastern Siberian?) Russian P.O.W taking care of an Owl, who befriended James. Wait...I thought the Russians were part of the Allies, helping the British against the Nazis? How could there be a Russian P.O.W. camp in Great Britian? Also my wife is Russian & the actor was horrible at his accent. This just puzzled me to no end.",1075939200,127,3837,4.595620437956204
1896361,5,B00009XN9D,"The reason that this DVD of the ""Specials"" has been teamed with Series 3 is that it picks up exactly where Series 3 leaves off with James Herriot going off to war in a car. The Special has him returning the same way and resuming the practice that he left before the war. The cast is virtually the same save for the housemaid, who is shown to have passed away in a slightly touching scene. This 2 special DVD shows Siegfried with a moustache and slightly older and Tristan as a now successful government employee in a town nearby. We are updated unexpectedly (unless you had read the novels) of James's family with a son and eventually a daughter. The pleasantness and wonderful country atmosphere remain as if we had never left and the specials conclude the series in a nice way. A sure pill for our times and relaxing to watch.",1069200000,152,828,4.453947368421052
1896362,5,B00009XN9D,"If you are a fan of the other episodes in this series, you will love this DVD.
The acting is superb, the storyline is very well-written and the animals are some of the cutest I've ever seen.  This is one of the few series that I've seen where the cast fit perfectly together as if they had been together their entire lives.  When you are watching, you are drawn into their different personalities.
This is a series with heartwarming stories and unexpected twists.  Whether you are a longtime fan or a beginner, you will enjoy this DVD.  Definitely worth watching.",1063756800,53,563,4.6

1896376,4,B00009XN9D,"Re-runs of this beloved series are still shown on many PBS stations, but these two specials are rarely shown.  The first one especially, is important for fans, because it bridges the time gap between the original series of programs (which ended with the male protagonists going off to war) and subsequent series made  later in the 1980's.  We learn that they came back from the war, resumed the veterinary practice,reconnected with familiar supporting characters, and readjusted to civilian life.  Both specials still feature Carol Drinkwater, and she was, in my opinion, the far-superior portrayer of Helen Herriott. There is one extra feature showing the making of one of the specials, and an interview with Christopher Timothy.",1437523200,4,730,5.267241379310345
1896377,5,B00009XN9D,Watched them already and both specials were great. Glad to see that they were of the older type that had the original Helen.

1896422,5,B00009XN9D,"This is a great series for the entire family.  Warm characters who treat all animals with dignity while taking care of the large and small creatures the vets handle on a daily basis.  You have three lovely vets who treat both farm animals and house pets, sometimes hindered by clients who are a mixed lot (some hateful, some endearing).  Each episode is interesting and this is really a series you can watch over and over.",1395619200,,422,4.6
