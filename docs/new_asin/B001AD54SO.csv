8277090,5,B001AD54SO,"The only reason I got this was because of Peter Cushing. If it has Peter Cushing, I will watch it. Although there are many other superb actors like Ian Bannen and Donald Pleasants, the plot is dull as well as the dialogue. No action at all except a fight scene towards the end. A really rare film, very glad that it is out because I wanted to see it, for Peter Cushing that is! The video quality is good, again it's a super rare film and I'm so happy that Sinister Cinema made this available!",1393891200,,492,4.189473684210526
8277091,4,B001AD54SO,"A typical understated UK spy movie of 1960.  Instead of relying on blood and gore and action shots, the movie has intelligent (and intelligible) dialogue and good actors.  It raises the important issue of scientific integrity versus realpolitik, so important now with global warming, the Gulf oil spill etc.etc.  My favourite character is the Minister (Raymond Huntley) who makes the case for realpolitik so eloquently.

A small technical flaw is noticeable.  The director has tried unuscessfully to pick up some of the ingredients of ""Brief Encounter"", made 15 years earlier.  For example the repressed strain of the protagonists, the rather forced comic relief (with the chimpanzee) and the classical piano background.  It does not quite work.  Maybe it would have been better to have had some steam trains roaring by.",1280275200,,820,5.253846153846154
8277092,3,B001AD54SO,"The movie had a good plot but it lacked action.  There was alot of dialogue in almost every scene of the movie.  It was slow in getting to the climax.  The acting in the movie was good for the most part.  Peter Cushing is great as usual.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Risk/dp/B001AD54SO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Risk</a>",1222992000,,375,6.294117647058823
