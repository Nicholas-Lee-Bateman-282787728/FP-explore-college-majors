  Gordon and all the case/crew were great to work with..  This is a great example of much needed feel-good kinda movie with some really funny scenes/lines..  Phyllis Diller, Henry Winkler, Gladys Knight  just top it off..  Yes,, it's an indy.. yes it's corny at times.. all the better - tongue firmly in cheek.
You won't see it at the academy awards.. so ya better order it here!",1370131200,,579,4.415094339622642
