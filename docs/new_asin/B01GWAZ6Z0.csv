7768010,5,B01GWAZ6Z0,"James is returning home after serving time for his involvement in the drowning of a small boy  whose body was never recovered. Once he returns he soon realises that, even though he may have served time, the past has a way of not letting you forget and there are always consequences. So he decides to sort out once and for all what really took place all those years ago when, he too, was just a child.

Now to say anymore would ruin the surprises and there are more than enough here. It is the sort of film where the plot is not that difficult but the telling is all the better for not being so reliant on the twists that have come to dominate so many of the thriller genre. The tension and existential threat are ever present giving this a brooding quality that naturally make you want to keep watching. The acting is all completely convincing and Reef Ireland as James is particularly good as the returning bad boy.

This is from writer and director Grant Scicluna who has made a few shorts including The Wilding which featured in the Boys on Film franchise and was rather good too. For a first full length feature he has demonstrated what a reservoir of talent he has to offer and I can only wait in eager anticipation for his next outing  absolutely recommended.",1478736000,3,1265,4.439655172413793
7768011,4,B01GWAZ6Z0,"This is very well written.  Had I known it was going to have a gruesome subject both in subject and near the end visually , I would not have watched it.  It had a few homoerrotic scenes which compared to most hetero scenes were suggestive.  There were no other offensive situations unless you are extremely closeted or homophobic; the short clips are minor .  The sexual odd parts of it are slightly s & m oriented .",1474761600,2,416,4.363636363636363

7768015,1,B01GWAZ6Z0,After the first 15 min. I stopped watching it.  It had quiet of lot of boy - boy romantic scenes so I figured that I kind of scenes will be continued in the movie.  Not interested.,1472860800,2,180,3.9722222222222223

7768017,1,B01GWAZ6Z0,Not as described. Soft gay porn scenes mixed in.  Strong sexual scenes. Content should have been mentioned in description.,1472169600,2,122,5.421052631578948
7768018,5,B01GWAZ6Z0,"This is a taunt mystery from Australia that is full of resentment, pain, secrets and regret. The less said about the film the better. If you're homophobic then I wouldn't suggest you watch this as it contains quite a bit of male on male sex scenes. Although not extremely graphic ,I thought it essential to the story.

I found this film to be spellbinding and completely realized. The scenery was beautiful yet had a very melancholic vibe to it. The acting and direction were top notch and had the power to make us as an audience feel everything the characters were feeling.

Some may feel the ending abrubt,but we're given enough information during the rest of the film to figure out what would happen after. I highly recommend this to lovers of award worthy indie cinema !",1471910400,8,774,4.642335766423358

8763642,4,B01GWAZ6Z0,Really good movie but really brutal in some places and the end just left you hanging.,1500768000,2,85,4.375

8763644,4,B01GWAZ6Z0,Great movie. If you have Amazon Prime do not buy it. I collect LGBT movies . This movie is based on a true story. I feel it has no place in my collection but great stuff.,1497744000,,170,3.75
8763645,1,B01GWAZ6Z0,Only watched 30 minutes. Appeared to be a young boy on boy Homo flick. I wasn't interested.,1495670400,,91,4.411764705882353
8763646,2,B01GWAZ6Z0,movie was not what I expected,1494979200,,29,4.0
8763647,5,B01GWAZ6Z0,"this was an excellent movie, you have to watch this movie more than once to take in all that this movie has to offer. It's a must have if you enjoy deep content movies. You certainly can't predict what twists and turns are about to happen.  GREAT MOVIE !!!",1494892800,,256,4.224489795918367
8763648,3,B01GWAZ6Z0,A truly horrifying movie - a somewhat slow and confusing slice of life among what can only be described as the Australian equivalent of the appalling people who made us shudder in Deliverance. Engaging all the same because of the tragic plight of the protagonist whose innate goodness and sweetness I kept hoping would in some way lead to a positive outcome.,1489017600,,358,4.790322580645161
8763649,2,B01GWAZ6Z0,"The plot got so cloudy I couldn't follow who anybody was in relationship to each other. Then, the ending resolved nothing, was like a slap in the face, after all the time invested in watching and trying to figure out the damn thing. The boys are wonderful, though. It's not their fault.",1486512000,,286,4.519230769230769
