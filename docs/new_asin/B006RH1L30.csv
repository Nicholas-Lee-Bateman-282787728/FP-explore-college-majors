5014849,5,B006RH1L30,"This video is jam packed with some really great instruction. My brother-in-law watched it and sent a text with a ""go watch this right now"" command. It didn't disappoint. It's around 28-ish minutes I think, and is seriously all fantastic explanations and demonstrations of cornering and footwork.

Highly recommend.",1371686400,,314,5.408163265306122
5014850,5,B006RH1L30,"Great DVD for the mountain bike lover. I have already learned and improved my techniques. I am very happy with this purchase, because most the DVDs about MTB are just documentaries that show off MTB Pros but don't tell you anything on how to do the tricks or a learning path.",1368748800,,275,4.411764705882353
8503565,5,B006RH1L30,"Excellent instruction on using footwork and weight transfer to flow through corners. He demonstrates and explains it in a very detailed manner. If I am ever in Seattle, I would do some private instruction with him.",1525737600,,214,4.972222222222222

8503567,5,B006RH1L30,"My turns/cornering are my weak point in mtb'ing, I am a newb. The instruction on this vid is clear and with practice, a great confidence builder. My turns have improved already. Great basic skills for anyone starting out in mtb'ing. I don't know if the skills explained will help an advanced rider but I don't see how they would hurt either. Vid has about 23 minutes of instruction on turns/cornering and is worth buying. Highly recommend it.",1434758400,,442,4.753246753246753
