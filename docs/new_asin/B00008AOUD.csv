ALARM CLOCK: Is a really fun video- the tiempo of the song is a little faster then the album version. Bjork floats on a raft through a jungle. Animals peek at her from the bank, and she frolics with a snake and some piranhas!
ALL IS FULL OF LOVE: Really cool video, I love it. Not the album version, but better. Has a darker feel to it. And features Bjork as a robot!
HIDDEN PLACE: The song plays but it doesn't show her singing it. In the begining you see Bjork standing still with her hair over her face, there is an opening sequence of rumbling beats unlike the album. Then as the music begins, a breeze starts up, and Bjork's hair whirls all around, she has the sweetest smile on her face.
Then this multicolored goo stuff comes out of her right eye, travels down her cheek then into her mouth, up her nostril, then comes out of her left eye...and keeps moving like this. At one point a computerized image of a uterus shoots out of her mouth! Then she opens her mouth to reveal, an image of herself, with hair flowing...
I learned later that the multicolored goo stuff, is supposed to be the many thoughts traveling through her head. Magical!
PAGAN POETRY: Starts out with abstract figures, that are erotically suggestive. Then slowly shows Bjork, she's dress in a gauzy dress that starts right under her bare breasts. Strands of pearls are hanging from her neck, and there are also pearls ""sewn"" to her skin.
It features close-ups of actual piercing. And at the end she turns to reveal her back (or a body doubles back) which has been pierce with six big rings, criss-cross down her spine, and a train of pearls run through them.
I think it's all incredibly stunning. But I know this was too taboo, for some people. If you're SUPER squeamish you may want to skip it.
Mtv (at least in America) would only show it late at night, and censored it.
But come on! It's an exquisite song. Bjork looks lovely. It's an incredibly gorgeous work of art.
I love that moment when the song reaches a climax, and suddenly the music stops, and Bjork sings ""I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him"" The expression on her face....it's fabulous and moving. :-)
There was a lot of jeers when COCCON came out, even more probably. Mtv shamed Bjork and gave her dishonorable mention!
Bjork appears nude, her lower half is covered with a body suit. So you can't see anything vulgar, you can't even see her belly button!
She's painted white, her eyebrows are bleached and her hair is done up, Geisha-style. The video was done by Eiko Ishioka, the woman who did the cotumes for ""The Cell"".
As it begins, there is a group of several Bjorks, all standing in different positions. One Bjork stands up and walks off alone. She stands in this greyish glow, shivers, looking vulnerable (and cold!).
As she begins to sing, these red threads start to emerge from her bosom. She plays with them, as they grow longer and longer. As she begin to encoil her feet, then her legs. The video gets a little steamier (but it's NEVER crude or vulgar) as Bjork passionately rubs her neck and pull the threads over her mouth, sticking her tongue through them. They eventually wrap around her completely and haul her up out of sight.
I guess to signify the bliss she finds swarthed up with her lover, in a cocoon. Simply lovely. :-)
IT IN OUR HANDS: Bjork remarked ""It was nice to do a full-blooded song after doing a whole album that didn't have any blood in it, though that was the point with Vespertine, this is was see-through like a crystal"" (Recorder Collecter, in an interview with David Hemingway)
It's a beautiful song, with a gorgeous deep bass beat and melody. And a magical video. Which shows Bjork, shot in nightvision! Walking around a with giant plants, bugs, frogs, swimming underwater with fish, standing in front of a huge spiders web ""Now, aren't we scaring ourselves, unnecessarily?""
I love the ending when she's laying in a boat, with her hand drapped over the side, in front of sunflowers. You'll also notice that Bjork is heavily pregnant here.
NATURE IS ANCIENT (AKA: MY SNARE):An animated/computerized video. Really, really cool. In the primeval beginning of Earth, there are two beings, they look like two globule micro-organisms swimming in a black void or primordial soup.
The female's heart starts the beats of the song, and sending out a beacon to a male. They begin a dance-like mating ritual. That results in the gestation of a little human fetus, that grows fast before your eyes. You can see it's veins and heart, through the female's tranluscent body. And look at that distinctive top lip, it's Bjork. Spectacular!",1053388800,,4779,4.58411214953271
7980962,5,B00008AOUD,"Anyone who has seen a Bjork video knows that no matter the theme or style the video is always beautiful.  These latest videos are no exception.
Alarm Call: Bjork floats on a raft in the middle of a quiet jungle stream.  From time-to-time she is approached by different wildlife and we get to see Bjork from their perspective.
All Is Full of Love: Even MTV plays this occasionally.  Two robots (who look like Bjork, of course) make out as machines fondle them.
Hidden Place: Gosh that lady's got amazing skin!  A camera follows glittery, iridescent fluid around Bjork's face (in and out of her eyes, nose and mouth).
Pagan Poetry: Bjork gets some pearls sewn onto her skin and her back pierced.  Her breasts are also bared for the camera.
Cocoon: Directed by the same woman who did the art direction for The Cell (Jennifer Lopez/Vince Vaughan movie).  Bjork is naked, but not really, as two red strands come out of her nipples to dance around and wrap her in, surprise, a cocoon.
It's In Our Hands: Spike Jonze directs Bjork in this nighttime romp through a very strange forest.  Bjork is very pregnant in this video.
Nature is Ancient:  Amazing animation of a conception.  The guys who made it, collectively known as Lynn Fox, used the very latest software to render this treat for the eyes.",1048118400,,1291,4.651982378854625
