If you enjoyed Deadly Prey, you will love this also. People running thru the woods, bad acting, explosions! This has it all.
If you are a stickler for quality, don't expect blu-ray quality here despite being on that format. However, I enjoy it this way, and think it adds to the experience, just like it was on USA Up All Night in the past!",1480377600,,393,4.324324324324325
2758556,5,6303388116,"A fun action film directed by the late David A. Prior in 1986/1987. It receives its first official DVD/Blu-ray release from Slasher // Video, using the only surviving elements to remaster the film.",1467504000,2,197,5.0
2758557,5,6303388116,"Mankillers starred Edd Byrnes and was released in 1987. Also known as 12 Wild Women. Edy Williams provides good support. Edd Byrnes plays a CIA agent who uses a team of women to go after a drug lord. Pretty violent, and not for the squeamish. Fans of Edd Byrnes will like this the most.",1435622400,4,286,4.314814814814815
2758558,2,6303388116,"I have fond memories of browsing thru mom & pop video stores as a kid during the 80's and running into all kinds of interesting, weird, titillating video covers from some of the most obscure movies released sometime during the 60's, 70's, or 80's. Usually the horror, action, or misc sections had the ""good"" stuff.

Mankillers, released in 1987, no doubt belongs on one of those shelves along with all the other wonderful miscreants and varmints that were unleashed upon the public during the heyday of VHS. This movie is like a timecapsule of bad 80's clothing, hairstyle, and acting; that alone makes this movie worth a look.

In the first 5 minutes alone, roughly ten people are gunned down. There are kidnapped 80's ""valley girls"" and savage ""death row"" fem felons acting like Junior High brats being recruited for a top secret mission. One of the prison girls is a former Glow girl, Tara of the Southern Belles. No real story, bad acting and a fun/silly trip down 80's VHS memory lane.",1247961600,4,990,4.716763005780347
2758559,1,6303388116,"Mankillers, a silly feminine version of The Dirty Dozen, involves a double-crossed female CIA agent, who is bent on revenge over her X-lover who tried to kill her and has gone over to the bad side.  With a set up like this, it's pretty easy to draw conclusions, i.e. sleazy man wrongs pretty woman, pretty woman blows away sleazy man.  Mankillers is not a good movie.  I wouldn't advise watching it.  It's just that I'm the kind that loves watching trash like this!

The stage is set however as Rachel MacKenna, the wronged CIA lady, forms a team to make an assault on her former lover and associate, John Mickland.  Mickland, appearing to be hanging out with his own gang in a South American country, is running a white prostitution ring and drug trafficking business.  MacKenna's all women team consists of prison convicts who are well armed and scantily dressed in cut off combat rags.  The girls are sexy and sleazy and have plenty of bounce to the ounce.  Not bad to look at, I might add. Mickland's men are pretty much a collection of low life, scum bag bums that are just hanging around waiting to be killed.  They are well armed also, but very quickly prove they have a remarkable talent for missing everything they shoot at.

So when Boys meet Girls in the jungle, Girls mow Boys down like ten pins.  With pistols, explosive charges, automatic rifles, hand grenades and bayonets the dozen or so ladies run roughshod over their male adversaries leaving stacks and stacks of dead men in their wake.  There is even one scene when one of the goons is taken off guard by one of the girls, who is about to expose her shapely breasts, only to have one of her girlfriends come up behind the guy and strangle him with a piano wire.  Cool!  A certain sexual eroticism pervades the movie with the sultry appearance of the women who efficiently wipe out the gang of bad guys, while at the same time maintaining a high degree of invulnerability, strength and confidence.  In other words if the girls went on a hunting trip and killed a dear you would probably feel sympathy for the dear.  In Mankillers you love watching the girls kill the creeps.  It's breathtaking.  And kill them they do, about 50 of them.  In the end the MacKenna and Mickland showdown settles it once and for all.  Naturally, Rachel shoots John to pieces, and then blows him up with a  LAW rocket for good measure.

When Gilbert Gottfried did the USA Saturday Night movies years ago, he played Mankillers just about every other month.  The movie offers countless jabs and fertile breeding ground for endless jokes.  One of my Gottfried favorites in describing Mankillers: ""Hell hath no fury like a woman's shot, at close range.""  That pretty much sums it up in a nutshell.",1142812800,6,2740,4.609504132231405

8175323,4,6303388116,"There's a certain glory in making films that objectively bad but still tons of fun to watch. There's no real formula for it. It doesn't involve a fun guy behind the camera, good actors, etc. It is kind of a weird wave that people just ride into the sunset or until they lose it. In this case, it's the guy who eventually went on to do Deadly Prey. If all you ever made in life was Mankillers or Deadly Prey, movie nerds / fans would probably love you but this guy managed to make both.

The basic plot is about an government agent who we are told is sexy that creates a Dirty Dozen style squad of female inmates who we are also told are sexy. I say told are sexy because frankly put everyone in this movie looks like they came out of a particularly trashy suburban bar. I mean I don't have a thing against that. It just makes it more fun to watch. I mean you're already in  weird world where a government agent decides the best way to fight drug dealers is give 2 week boot camps to hookers and send them out as shock troopers. I mean I know they did this in the USSR but you know they're in America. It's hilariously weird.

The movie has zero budget. The sets are used for multiple places. They have no lack of bad sound effects or explosives work. The movie in certain areas looks like a Mad Max film but it's taking place in then present day USA LA. It doesn't matter how scummy LA can get. It's never Mad Max end of the world levels of scummy. It's not 70s New York or Rome. The weather is too lovely for that.

The blu ray is cheap, the packaging good, and the transfer of the film itself is excellent. It's worth the purchase if you're into this sort of thing",1520294400,,1666,4.132716049382716
8175324,5,6303388116,"From some of the reviews I thought I was going to watch a complete piece of trash.  Actually, although the dialogue was stilted, the
action kind of standard from the eighties, and the killing sort of more primitive than has developed over the years, this turned out to
be kind of funny and interesting.  I kind of feel like I went to a dirty little greasy spoon cafe and was served edible food and good
coffee.  It wasn't that great but it wasn't that terrible.  I rate it five stars because of it surpassing expectations.  Besides watching a
bunch of pretty girls in high tight shorts and with no bras running around shooting at people and throwing grenades draws ones attention.
I especially liked the muscular legs as they were sneaking around in a crouch--that was good and somebody deserves a bonus for that.",1515801600,2,813,4.618055555555555

8175327,3,6303388116,"Glorious mullets (men and women), feathered bangs, men in tight jeans, braless women in cut up fatigues that look like they stepped out of an 80's Soldier of Fortune magazine ... it's 80's redneck/hillbilly culture in all it's glory and I say that with affection. The budget is minimal, there are lots of scantily clad ladies (and I use that word loosely) running around, doing things. Lots of good looking guys, fighting, being jerks. All superimposed on a plot cribbed from The Dirty Dozen. By any objective standard it's a terrible movie but somehow manages to be fun.",1513296000,3,571,4.836734693877551

8175330,5,6303388116,"MANKILLERS (aka: 12 WILD WOMEN- 1987) begins w/ the required synth-o-cheeeze score, that prepares us for glory! It seems those eeevil drug lords are up to their old tricks once more. Meanwhile, a man resembling Captain Kangaroo and his CIA cohort, Joan Hanson (Gail Fisher) decide to enlist some outside help, after a drug deal / operation gone bad. Someone named John Mickland (William Zipp) is killing the best drug dealers, and taking their money as well as their white devil powder! He's also a human trafficker! Enter Rachael McKenna (Lynda Aldon) who is called upon to go after Mickland, but she will need the help of a few ""recruits"". These ""recruits"" happen to be in prison. No problem! They're sprung immediately in order to serve their country! Their big-big hair, halter tops, and wily grins, tell us that America is in good hands. Rachael will have to whip these women into shape, and hope there's enough hairspray, as these are not the type of females who share! After proving her dominance, Rachael puts her team through boot camp, in the required short-shorts. We witness them doing jumping jacks, while the song ""Stand Tough"" warbles on! Yeah! Grenade training is a true spectacle! Simultaneously, Mickland continues to show how disgusting he is, by murdering the girls he has abducted! As it turns out, Rachael has a score of her own to settle w/ Mickland. Can she get her squad ready in time to face off w/ this eternally grimacing, pony-tailed pig-man? You'd better believe it, baby! The next thing we know, they're shooting down / blowing up the bad guys, like the no-name extras they are! You'll love the way these goons make belching sounds whenever they're hit! All while that kickin' theme music roars! EXTRA POINTS: Watch and don't blink, and you'll catch one of the dead men start to get up! Oopsy-daisy! Oh no! Mickland proves to be a bit more slippery than first thought, and captures Rachael! Have no fear, as the remnant of her band of delinquent debutantes is out for blood! The karate, grenade tossing, grrrrl-power, gun battle finale shall live forever in our memories! There's more of that belching too! Aren't men funny?!... P.S.- You'll be astonished when Mickland takes a .45 slug through the heart, and just gets up like he's been hit by a grain of rice!...  P.P.S.- Hell, he takes another one in the leg and one in the gut, and can still drive a car!... P.P.P.S.- Let's all sing the theme song together! ""Frreeeeedomm! FFFrreeeeeddoommmm!"" Anyone bring a kazoo?!...",1510531200,7,2504,4.836829836829837
