4164301,5,B003P5JYP4,"Great thriller with a good plot line that keeps the viewer's attention. Does a good job of portraying a sense of desolation when they return to the deserted town, which adds to the suspense. Really enjoyed the storyline and loved how it ended. It's been a while since I had seen a thriller like this that I truly enjoyed.

PLOT SUMMARY -- Fifteen years after Clear Lake, WI was evacuated and quarantined by the government, four young adults return to the small town in search of clues about their mysterious past. Back in 1994, a mysterious virus appeared in Clear Lake. As panic spread, a local priest (Michael Madsen) convinced a small group of high school students that the locals were being punished by God, and that the day of retribution had finally arrived. It was their job, claimed the priest, to apprehend the worst sinners, and ensure that they suffered for their transgressions. When government health officials arrived to investigate, they were shocked to discover that 13 of the locals had vanished without a trace, and the majority of the townspeople had abandoned their homes for fear of getting infected. For the following 15 years, the town sat eerily still and completely unoccupied. Now, a group of documentary filmmakers have convinced the kids who previously took part in the kidnappings to return to Clear Lake, and shed some light on the unsolved mystery. But the deeper the filmmakers and their subjects dig for answers about Clear Lake's mysterious past, the more they risk being buried alive in the process.",1285286400,7,1534,4.9

8401900,5,B003P5JYP4,"As described the movie is a fun fright watch. Definitely in the B movie class but I like B movies. Plus I live in Clear Lake, WI so that is the primary reason we purchased it. Shipping was prompt, quality of the package and the product is excellent as advertised. Highly recommend it for a popcorn movie night on a snowy winter evening. Especially if you live in or near Clear Lake, WI or you are a Clear Lake, WI native living elsewhere. The movie was shot on sight in Clear Lake and you will see a lot of familiar landmarks, etc.",1471824000,,531,4.215686274509804

8401903,2,B003P5JYP4,"Clear Lake, WI (Brian Ide, 2009)

Entirely forgettable serial-killer movie that wants to cross subgenres into the teen-sex-comedy world, but fails in both respects. Promising setupan aspiring documentary filmmaker gathers together the survivors of a quarantined town, all of whom were under the protection of a local crazy preacher (Michael Madsen, slumming it), and takes them all back to Clear Lake (where, of course, they start dying). I'd like to blame the movie's problems on a lack of budget, but I'm not sure Ide (The Ride) and screenwriters Morgan Simpson (Redemption Road) and Geoff Bullens could have pulled this off with A-listers and a Michael Bay-level budget; there's just not enough to the story, and what there is was tired and predictable thirty years ago. Could possibly have some use as a sleep aid, but otherwise avoidable. * ",1402358400,,846,5.1231884057971016
8401904,2,B003P5JYP4,"When the army dumps toxic waste into Clear Lake, people died from a mysterious illness. The Reverend (Michael Madsen) claims sin was reason and convinces a group of teens to kidnap sinful town folks so he can purge them from the community. The Reverend got convicted, but the teens got off. 15 years later, Kyra (Shi Ne Nielson) and Nikki (Heather Simpson) decide to shoot a documentary about the abandon town including interviews with four of the remaining teens, now grown adults. These four are the only ones that are left as someone has been killing them off.

This isn't hard to figure out. While you have more suspects than a Scooby-doo episode, you don't have much more, and they make it a bit obvious. There is some blood, but the horror aspect is minimum. There is some old inner conflicts in the group, but nothing well written. Even though the town has been abandoned for 15 years, none of the abandoned vehicles have flat or cracked tires.

Fairly lame for a Madsen film. Now part of a 30 Horror Film Collection.

8401907,2,B003P5JYP4,"I actually don't remember too much about this film. We watched it 2 days ago, and I have already, thankfully, forgotten most of it. It was just a generic, slasher type film with nothing to offer. Unbelievable story, unbelievable acting, and unbelievably bad. I feel sorry for the good people of the real town of Clear Lake, WI that have to have this film forever associated with their fine town. Thankfully, not too many people ever even heard about this film. I also feel sorry for the actors who had to endure the freezing weather on location, for what I'm sure will be very little return for their efforts, especially Michael Madsen, whom I love as an actor. Why he lent his name to this horrible excuse of a movie is beyond me. What was he thinking? Thankfully, he was only in it for a brief period of time and I'm guessing that he didn't have to leave the comfort confines of California for any of the shooting.",1313107200,4,916,4.458333333333333
8401908,1,B003P5JYP4,"I ordered this movie based on the excellent reviews from the previous three viewers, so I had high hopes for it when I put it in my DVD player. Unfortunately, as soon as the movie started, it became quite evident that it was very low budget. The acting was poor, there was no increase in tension at all, and the pointless conversation scenes were extremely long. I watched this movie for about one hour, before deciding to stop it. Mind you, I am very tolerant, and I try to find goodness in the majority of the movies I watch, but this one was intolerable.",1289865600,4,557,4.365384615384615
