4509259,5,B004ZJ9W4W,"To do this DVD justice, I'd have to write an essay on each short film. If you're like me, and are completely enamored by this sort of 80s-loving, gore-heavy, gut-busting (and ghost-busting?) comedy/horror/action/softcore porn(?), then you'll hardly have the patience to sit through anything longer than a 300 word review.
That being said, thank goodness for these clinically unbalanced Canucks. For being homemade films, these fellas are already demonstrating the skills to play in the big leagues (said leagues have only just gotten ready now as they're releasing their first two feature films ""Father's Day"" and ""Manborg"" in the festival circuit).
You'll just have to trust me on this one and BUY THIS DVD compilation. It is the best Troma release since...ever...and if you're the least bit a fan of sci-fi, raunchy comedies, straight-to-VHS 80s films, animation or just anything with lasers and/or swords, you'll find something to love amongst these films.",1323734400,16,959,5.315789473684211

8449930,3,B004ZJ9W4W,"I came to this Astron-6 collection by way of ""Manborg"", an Astron-6 feature film that I found extremely creative and well-executed, particularly given the budget constraints in play. This collection from the young Canadian comedy collective calling themselves Astron-6 shares the zero-budget ethos of ""Manborg"", but is not nearly as polished, even, or funny. Don't get me wrong, there are funny moments in this collection, but on the whole I found much of the material to be extremely juvenile and frequently boring. The group clearly loves shock value, and they do everything in their power to surprise and occasionally revolt the audience, and while I genuinely believe it's all done in fun, shock for shock's sake wears thin quickly.

The collection opens with a pointless and painfully unfunny introduction from Lloyd Kaufman (Troma distributed it), and proceeds to a terrible menu that is patience-trying at best. This collection is an assembly of short films (some of which are very short indeed) made by people who clearly love spoofs of 1980s themes (particularly when they can be combined with horror genre tropes). This is definitely an ensemble piece, so prepare yourself to see the same faces repeatedly. First up is ""Cool Guys"", in which two nerds go to the beach to become cool. This had a strong opening, with great credits (something Astron-6 deserves praise for almost universally) like ""And introducing Falcon Van Der Baek as The Mayor's Son"". The mayor's son, it turns out, is a bully; don't even ask how it turns into a murder mystery. I was so bored at one point that all I could think of was how the murdered girl had really nice teeth. The plot resolution requires the protagonists to win a talent show (again, don't ask), and the music is unbearable even as an 80s parody.

""H.I.Z."" is a camp film about adolescent boys and girls generally doing what they do best in an unsupervised setting while dealing with a military virus. Again, great credits, terrible acting and unfunny jokes. This is a zombie parody that sees the ultimately annoying Paul enduring a glass-related injury leading to his eventual zombification. It's fairly graphic (I told you they like gross-out humor) but exceptionally juvenile and once again bored me.

""Punch Out"" was, after the first two, a joy to behold. It's an 80s coming of age spoof that has some genuinely hilarious moments, mostly revolving around fear of intimacy. The fake ID scene was brilliantly written and executed, and I will just say I've never seen a comic tracheotomy scene before. This was a strong effort that really hit its mark. This is the kind of thing that, like ""Manborg"", makes me appreciate these guys. They are talented, they just needed to think through this collection and be more introspective about what's weak and what's strong. I would take a great single DVD instead of a middling two-DVD set any day of the week.

""You're Dead"" would be more appropriately titled ""Misogyny Can Be Fun"". This is as dark as their filmmaking gets, but sexual predation is never funny. At least it's short.

""Insanophrenia"" is by far the most ambitious and creative effort in the collection, using live action, some primitive CGI, and even stop motion effects, the short is occasionally genuinely disturbing. While I didn't love it, I admired the approach to the material given the budgetary constraints the filmmakers were under. The fact that a large part of the film is three guys in respirators talking in a stairwell should not deter you.

""Kris Miss"" is a very short infomercial spoof. I am always up for mocking infomercials, but much like ""You're Dead"", the filmmakers misjudge the humor potential of the underlying premise: holiday suicides aren't something that makes for compelling comedy, even of the dark variety. Along those same lines, in the coming attractions section, I'm going to once again go out on a limb and say that most people won't find rape especially funny: I certainly didn't. These guys are actually good at making spoofs; that they repeatedly choose subjects that aren't comedy goldmines for their shock value does not help them. ""Haunted"" is a goth murder rap music video spoof, and if you're into that sort of thing, you'll love it. It is, truthfully, fairly well done if you can get past the music involved.

Disc two opens with ""Fireman"", which is a parody of a movie promo about a fireman who returned from the dead (""Revenge is a dish best served on fire!"") This one is short, but has a creative twist that once again hints at the group's potential brilliance when they are focused on good material.

My very favorite thing on the DVD, and the item that redeems the collection to a large degree is ""Lazer Ghosts 2: Return From Laser Cove"". This is an excellent spoof of cheesy 1980s horror movies, and is spot on in its comedy. I especially loved the sword fights and laser Frisbee decapitation scenes! If you want to see the group's true potential shine through, start here.

""Siam I Am"" is a truly odd comedy-mystery about conjoined twins torn apart by a very hot woman. I won't spoil it, but will say that the contract killer gets the best bits, and the discussion about fake eyebrows is hilarious. This is another strong effort.

""Inferno of the Dead"" is another great spoof, this time of Italian zombie movies. The introduction, opening credits, and musical score are standouts. While I liked the concept of eating beans off the kitchen floor (you'll just have to see it yourself to understand), the zombies making prank phone calls may be the single greatest scene in the collection. Brilliant stuff. If this collection was this consistently good, I would give it five stars without reservation.

""Ena Lake Blues"" is something completely different. Kudos for leaving their comfort zone on this one, as it's a parody of silent movies. The idea here is great, though the debauchery involved quickly makes it clear that this is like no silent movie ever made. While the concept is good, it goes on far too long and becomes boring by the end.

""Dusting For Nightmares"" is a movie about making movies: it's the most self-referential film of the bunch, and despite loads of clever movie references, it's once again too long and becomes tedious.

""Xtreme Ghost Killers"" is a great parody of horrible reality television. Highlight: they find a free burnt orange couch. This is another solid effort that has some genuine wit and cultural insights through the power of parody.

""Fat Adam"" is another departure: it's a short animated story of murder over a bologna sandwich. I'm impressed they took a passable shot at animation, though the content was not terribly amusing.

There are multiple installments of ""Goreblade"", which is a bizarre sword and sandals fantasy serial (sort of) that has some particularly great moments. Some of the episodes are better than others, but the Japanese episode is worth the price of admission by itself.

The DVD has multiple extras including some commentaries, trailers, behind the scenes stuff, and photo galleries. There is an extremely peculiar extra titled ""A Word From Guy Maddin"" in which the unique Canadian filmmaker expresses himself. It is beyond odd.

My favorite extra, though, is called ""A Word From Uwe Boll"". Simply put, this is wonderful! He talks at great length about how bad Astron-6 is and his endorsement alone bumped up my rating of this set to three stars. I rarely would align myself with Boll, but on this one we completely agree when he says ""I'm Uwe Boll and you're watching Astron-6 so good luck with it, you're going to need it!"" I couldn't have said it better myself.",1459123200,2,7635,4.878858024691358

They clearly love movies and you can tell they're having fun.  I own DVD's of Father's Day and Manborg, but gave away my copy of Astron-6 collection to a friend, just to spread the gospel.  Guess I need to order another copy!

Also, yes Troma distributed this, but it's all Astron-6 baby!  After the Father's Day debacle with Troma, I kind of don't like them anymore, I think?  Lloyd's always been, let's say, a cheap-skate, and that's part of Troma's charm, but you shouldn't rip off talented, dedicated ARTISTS.  I always thought that's what Troma stood for.  Also, the products are themselves cheap.  The Troma produced DVD of Father's Day has no subtitles.  The Manborg DVD made by Astron-6 has subs.

There is something for everyone here in this collection of 18 horror shorts but the stand-outs by far are the eerie HEART OF KARL, INFERNO OF THE DEAD and INSANOPHENIA.  Only a couple of them were ""eh"" and for the most part this collection is pretty solid with great bad acting, good effects at times and a fun stories.  I really loved the 80's feel to it and the music throughout was perfect.  You get gore, nudity, violence, humor, 80's synth music - look, it's worth the money and it's a great movie to toss in at a party or watch with a group.
