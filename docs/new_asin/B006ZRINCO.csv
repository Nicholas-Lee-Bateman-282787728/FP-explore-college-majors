5043760,5,B006ZRINCO,"Alter Bridge has to be one of the most under-rated bands alive. They are incredibly talented at each instrument and just ""gel"" together better than almost any band I can think of. Myles voice is one of a kind, Mark Tremonti is easily one of the worlds best guitarists, Flip is a phenomenal drummer, and Brian is killer on the bass. These guys just know how to write music and the LIVE to entertain. This DVD gives you a full experience. The only possible way to get any more real than this is to actually go see them live. You will be amazed at how incredibly good this DVD is...the sound, the visuals, the camera angles, the energy, it's just nothing short of amazing. Do youself a favor and buy this blu ray, pop it in your player and let your surround sound show you what it's made of!",1332720000,2,788,4.295302013422819
5043761,5,B006ZRINCO,"I am a live music junkie. I usually forego the DVD experience in exchange for the live one. For any concert goer, the anticipation builds as the crowd gets larger. You spend 30 minutes getting to know your fellow junkie next to you as you both agree to ride the rail for the entire show. Suddenly, the lights go out and the crowd roars. A strum of a guitar or a beat from the drum signals that the show is about to start. Then your band takes the stage! As the band pounds out the crowd favorite songs, you wait for that moment that makes your experience so personal.

I got the opportunity to attend a private screening of this DVD 2 days ago. The producers of THIS DVD have done an outstanding job at capturing these moments. It's not just watching the band play onstage. You get this experience as if you are right there in all the action. They captured those moments that make your concert experience REAL. Watching the band interact with each other, from smiles to nods, to seeing them interacting with the audience. Even better, the producers were even able to capture fans interacting with each other. The amount of energy given on this DVD will blow you away! It is a definate treat to any Alter Bridge fan and will enhance their collection....but I also recommend this DVD to any live music fan and experience this. I personally cannot wait for the 3D movie showing this summer!",1331596800,11,1387,4.482213438735178
5043762,5,B006ZRINCO,This is an awesome concert!  Great production and quality!  Alter Bridge really puts on a good show in this video!,1418774400,,114,4.65
5043763,5,B006ZRINCO,Love this.  I even went out to buy a Blu-Ray player before I ordered it especially so I could watch it.,1410048000,,103,3.9047619047619047
5043764,5,B006ZRINCO,"Great DVD! Shot well, sound is excellent and captured what I think is one of the premiere bands out today. You really get a sense of the joy felt by the band and that makes for a great experience. Extra's were cool to. A must own!",1398124800,,230,4.021739130434782
5043765,5,B006ZRINCO,Awesome show. I have seen this band 4 times live and they never disappoint. They bring 100% to the stage every time. Get this DVD. You will not be disappointed.,1397692800,,160,4.366666666666666
5043766,5,B006ZRINCO,Great show along with the music. Being a musician you could appreciate how he gets the crowd into it. Outstanding performance from the band.,1394236800,,140,4.875
5043767,5,B006ZRINCO,"If you only 'like' Alter Bridget, I recommend this.  If you 'LOVE' Alter Bridge like I do, you MUST have this.  I've watched it numerous times...and that says something for a concert video.",1387497600,,189,4.696969696969697
5043768,5,B006ZRINCO,Everything Perfect,1385942400,,18,8.5
5043769,5,B006ZRINCO,I first got interested in Alter Bridge after doing a web search for Myles Kennedy after seeing his performance with Slash on the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame show. He sang better than Axel Rose could ever dream of singing. Plus he didn't do the stupid dance; he didn't have to because I was hooked. I wish they would tour the west coast so I could see them in Portland or Seattle. I am a big lyrics person and I truly love the song lyrics. How do people get so talented?,1385337600,,466,4.076086956521739
5043770,5,B006ZRINCO,GREAT. ALL AROUND. I'D LOVE TO SEE THIS BAND IN THE FUTURE. STAY AWAY FROM CREED. GO ALTER BRIDGE.  BUY IT.,1380931200,,107,4.095238095238095
5043771,5,B006ZRINCO,"The lighting and camera work was exceptional.  The sound was great, but the mix on Tremonti should have been louder.  This is a very high quality concert production.  I woud highly recommend. You will enjoy this whether you are a die-hard fan or not.",1377907200,,250,4.636363636363637
5043772,5,B006ZRINCO,LOVE this band and LOVE this Blu-ray!  One of the best bands out there today.  If you haven't heard their music...buy a CD or buy this!!!,1373155200,,137,4.230769230769231
5043773,2,B006ZRINCO,"Vocals are to loud. If you want a concert experience that is. The Amsterdam show had the same problem, but at least that show had some punch and power behind the music.(Bass and Drums) Was looking for what they did with the Creed show sound and power wise. With my system Creed's Show will blow you completely out of the room. The Amsterdam show gives it a good try.",1369267200,,366,4.318840579710145
5043774,5,B006ZRINCO,"I love that someone is giving these guys some credit and putting their music out for all to see. You really can't go wrong on blu-ray either.
I've heard that this may be released in 3D soon as well...even better.
To the seller, thanks for the quick turn around.",1363564800,,261,4.346938775510204
5043775,5,B006ZRINCO,"this concert is awesome , I'm a big fan since creed this guys are great, I haven't see yet in concert but this experience is great the sound the guitars man great I recommend "" es uno de los mejores concierte en DVD  It Rocks",1362182400,,225,4.0
5043776,5,B006ZRINCO,"I love Alterbridge as band. They sound great in this second concert, but I like more the performance of the first one. Excellent image quality. A must to have for AlterBridge fans! Now I want another eith the AB3 songs included :D",1361491200,,230,4.5
5043777,5,B006ZRINCO,This Blu ray is awesome. I love it. It has all the great AB songs. The quality is excellent and the documentary is preety good.,1360800000,,127,4.12
5043778,5,B006ZRINCO,"I am a very big Alter Bridge fan, and this concert is the ultimate display of the band's talent and music. A must for any AB fan. The HD visual and audio quality is brilliant and best experienced in full surround sound.",1359331200,,219,4.238095238095238
5043779,4,B006ZRINCO,SUPER DVD. Like the group and the song selection. Sound quality and picture excellent. look forward to their next release.,1358035200,,122,5.15
5043780,5,B006ZRINCO,"Great Band and great show, Blu Ray is as its touted to be. Concert Video was recorded very well, lots of good shots and great audio as well.",1345593600,,140,4.035714285714286
5043781,5,B006ZRINCO,"This Blu Ray is an incredible registration of Alter Bridge history so far. Excelent camera work, set list selection, crowd interaction and musical performance. Also, a great documentary about one of the best hard rock bands out there. I highly recommend.",1344902400,,254,5.219512195121951
5043782,5,B006ZRINCO,"The bluray is a most have for any Alterbridge fan. Excellent setting, and their is a difference in about 7 songs that are not in their previous Bluray/DVD concert.

So get it!!",1343692800,,176,4.5
5043783,5,B006ZRINCO,"This concert was amazing and my second Blu Ray concert purchase. Alter Bridge is amazing and I will continue to buy concert dvds of them if they make more of them. As close to being there, comes with a cd with live tracks from the show but not all songs, like 13 tracks and the concert blu ray has 21 songs; why it's like that I have no idea. If you are a fan of Alter Bridge, you'll love this product.",1340064000,,402,3.9753086419753085
5043784,5,B006ZRINCO,"I am a huge fan of concert DVD's and saw this release by Alter Bridge on sale, not a big fan of Alter Bridge although I bought the first CD and never really listened to it much after that. Recently I've seen Myles with Slash and was pretty impressed and since there wasn't any concert dvds coming out that I didn't already have, I took a chance and ordered the blu ray and so glad I did ! Really enjoyed watching the concert, sound and video top notch and the music itself was very powerful and enjoyable. I might have to revisit the Alter Bridge cd along with the other two that came out since, can't wait to watch the dvd again !",1339977600,,631,4.138211382113822
5043785,5,B006ZRINCO,I'm not surprised how good is this concert considering how good is the band. The set list is great and executed to perfection. Lasers and flames give a striking visual effect to the concert but I would enjoy this band even in darkness. RECOMMENDED,1339113600,,247,4.636363636363637
5043786,5,B006ZRINCO,"I own this as well as their first dvd, live from amsterdam. the quality of the recording is absolutely beautiful. it's crystal clear, the sound is amazing and the band just looks like they are having a blast up there on stage. if you are even a casual fan of Alter Bridge, you owe it to yourself to pick this up.",1335830400,,312,4.131147540983607
5043787,5,B006ZRINCO,If you like big Rock N Roll concerts you must see this!  Alter Bridge Live At Wembley is a memory of one of Alter Bridge's best concerts ever! The video and audio quality are superb.,1335830400,,182,4.2
5043788,5,B006ZRINCO,"A must have!
I blast this Blu-Ray so loud just to feel I was there. I'm sure my neighbors liked it too. Because I got no complaints!",1335830400,,132,3.925925925925926
5043789,5,B006ZRINCO,"Wake up America this is real music,a rock band playing their own instruments at the highest level. Look at the crowds AB has overseas! It's time this band and others like it get the recognition they deserve. AB is four of the most talented artists you will ever see and hear. Myles awesome vocals and guitar skills,Tremonti guitar god,Marshall five string bass and and last but not least Flip on drums!",1334707200,,402,4.676056338028169
5043790,4,B006ZRINCO,"I've been a massive AB fan since the first album, the Amsterdam show is still one of my favourite live DVD's however I was slightly underwhelmed this time around.

The production level here is great, in HD format it's a visual treat.  Myles is one the best vocalists around at the minute, however this performance didn't stand out for me whether this was down to the mix on the night, or a rigorous tour schedule  I don't know.  But for me, the Amsterdam show was vocally more impressive.

I also would have liked to hear a slightly different set list, Fallout, One by one, break me down, Still remains, Make it right would have fit straight in.  Some people have also commented on the language?!?.... deal with it, this is rock and roll people!

So in summary... Good product... Does this change my opinion of the band, no, does this mean you shouldn't by this DVD, Hell no! Great band, but an ok performance... But for all die hard AB fans, this should see you through the hiatus until the Next AB project. Enjoy",1334275200,9,1014,4.478260869565218
5043791,4,B006ZRINCO,"I own the Amsterdam DVD, and this Blu-ray blows it away visually. Everything is crisp and detailed.  The camera angles change too often for my taste, but that's totally subjective to the viewer.  I haven't even gotten through the entire Blu-ray yet, but wanted to comment on the pace of the concert. As with the Live in Amsterdam DVD, some if not all of the songs appear to be played at a quicker pace than their stuido albums.  I agree with other commenters that it makes Miles appear rushed in his vocals which is a shame, and it can make the overall sound just seem a little sloppy.  Once again the audio seems to fall a little flat sonically compared to the studio albums. It's not that the band is doing anything wrong, its that the mix just doesn't have the lows of the kick drum and the bass that a real live show encompasses.  I don't have a dedicated subwoofer on my system which may help, but I have two very capable stereo speakers which sound great with other live concerts, so I know it is the mix, and not my system causing this shortfall.

Despite these negative comments, I know that if you're an AB fan, you will enjoy this Blu-ray.",1334102400,,1149,4.370892018779343
5043792,3,B006ZRINCO,"Great visual Concert dvd, blu ray is amazing, very good setlist

i have a few gripes though

Myles looked to be holding back vocally on a bunch of songs, i kept waiting for the big ""here it comes"" on vocals and they never came. WAY to much crowd participation the band had them sing on almost every song and the best parts no less. Interaction with the crowd seemed forced and very lame,same goes for the F bombs, doesnt seem to fit AB style. UPDATE-DVD should clearly state Wembley arena not Wembley stadium  Guitar solos were very good, alot of dueling between Myles and Tremonti. overall i would recommend it , i prefer AB live from Amsterdam over this one but generally a good dvd.",1333756800,5,685,4.464
5043793,5,B006ZRINCO,"Alter Bridge is no doubt one of the greatest bands out there today, and this movie proves that. Not only is the music great (like always) but combined with the unprecedented video and audio quality that Blu Ray offers you get one of the greatest live videos created in the last 10 years. And about the whole swearing and cussing in the video, I personally don't mind it because I got this looking for a concert experience considering I am a whole ocean and another 50miles away from England, and that is part of the experience, this was obviously a big gig for the band and some things just get said. I can see why some wouldn't care for it because of the fact it is very unpredictable and wouldn't want to show their children because of that, but what would be different if they went to the concert. All in all this is a definite recommendation, the quality of the video and audio mixed with the expert video editing and filming, fused with the beautiful ROCK sound that Alter Bridge ever so awesomely delivers just makes this a must have for any fan or non-(soon to be) fan.",1333670400,2,1076,4.4120603015075375
5043794,5,B006ZRINCO,"Alter Bridge are definitely one of the best bands of the past 10 years and this new Live At Wembley DVD proves that they are talented musicians who thrive on the live experience. This package includes an amazing concert containing 21 songs from all three of their albums plus a DVD documentary with lots of backstage footage and a bonus CD of the live concert. The band is on fire during this show as they play with passion and intensity while the production is also killer featuring a nice light show and crystal clear footage of all band members and their musicianship. Alter Bridge is that rare type of band that has musical talent, quality songs, and the ability to produce it all live on stage. Highlights include the powerful opening track ""Slip To The Void"", the brilliant vocal melodies of ""Ghosts Of Days Gone By"", the amazing performance of ""Blackbird"", the heartfelt acoustic performance of ""Watch Over You"", and the stunning hard rocker ""Isolation"". I recently saw Alter Bridge perform in Australia and I can tell you it was a very intense show that highlighted the twin guitar attack of a great band and their awesome singer. This is an essential concert for fans of Alter Bridge and is a reward to fans who have supported this band's steady climb to the top of the rock ladder.",1333584000,,1291,4.666666666666667
5043795,3,B006ZRINCO,"I was able to go to an Alter Bridge concert last year in Baltimore and it was AWESOME! I was dissapointed with the dvd for a couple reasons:

1. To reiterate what others have said, the use of the f-bombs by Myles was awkward and ridiculous. I was planning on showing my kids but am not able to now.

2. I like when Myles sings like the recordings or slightly different. I felt that many of the songs were rushed and he was trying too hard to make the songs sound too unique. Also, I do not want to hear the crowd singing I want to hear Myles. I think it could have been done better.

I am glad that I only spent $14.99 for the thing.",1333411200,2,633,3.968503937007874
5043796,4,B006ZRINCO,"I am a die-hard fan, and live by their Amsterdam DVD/Blu-ray release.  The sound and picture quality of this Blu-ray are unmatched.  With that said, here are my issues:

1.) Slow down! The band feels the need to speed up the tempo of songs that were originally recorded at a much slower tempo.  This causes them to sound a bit jumbled live, and Myles loses breath just slightly. 'Find The Real' and 'Slip To The Void', two of my favorites, encompass this.  Both are great songs, both sound good live, but I wish they would have played them at the right tempo.

2.) How 'bout some different songs? Live at Wembley includes a handful of songs off AB III. The older ones left a lot to be desired, in my opinion. Don't get me wrong; they sounded great.  But they should have performed some songs that weren't on the Amsterdam release. I didn't particularly care to hear 'Come to Life, 'Ties That Bind', and 'Broken Wings' again. AB has some great songs that are underrated and not included on EITHER release -- 'Wayward One', 'Burn It Down' (one of my faves), 'Down To My Last', 'Shed My Skin', 'The End Is Here'; as well as AB III's 'Still Remains', 'Make It Right', 'Show Me A Sign', 'Words Darker Than Their Wings', etc...

3.) Swearing. I'm not the first reviewer to note this, but I feel it bears repeating. I am by no means a prude, but unexplained f-bombs in random places make Myles sound ridiculous and takes away from the experience. Plus, you can't let your kids watch it...and I'd rather my kids appreciate good rock music instead of Nicki Minaj or Adele.",1333065600,10,1563,4.498233215547703
5043797,5,B006ZRINCO,"Someone ought to explain to me why anyone would buy the Audio CD seperately when this Blu-ray / CD combo seems to be the DEAL of a lifetime. Every AB fans dream. Great show, great production quality both in HD Video and HD Audio. Deserves every star.
However, I too feel that Myles cursing was unnecessary. Let me explain. I'm an adult, so the expletives don't bother me personally, but my two young boys are also evolving into AB fans. At ages 9 and 10 they like to sing ""Wonderful Life and Watch Over You"" as I play those songs on my Acoustic and together we have watched the Amsterdam Show many many times. Now, I contemplate letting them see this entire Blu-ray as is, or perhaps just letting them watch (edited) portions. I'm glad Myles acoustic portion is curse-free!
So note to AB: Fellas, your fans come in all AGES. As (under-valued and under-appreciated) artists your music is far reaching and widely enjoyed. Be proud of that, but mindful as well.",1332979200,7,958,4.575581395348837
5043798,3,B006ZRINCO,"I've been an AlterBridge fan ever since they've been a group, and couldn't wait for this live concert video to come out.  Great quality, production, etc.  My only beef is the profanity from Myles throughout the concert.  Doesn't add at all to the show.  Certainly this could have been cleaned up post production or Myles could have cleaned things up knowing this was recording live.  Just my two cents worth.  Take away the F bombs, and you get 5 stars.",1332979200,4,453,4.6
5043799,5,B006ZRINCO,"It's all in the title.
I didn't think AB could top their Amsterdam performance but in my opinion they did. All of the classics are there plus 7 songs from AB III; the energy the band put in their performance is amazing and the fan response is even better, the mosh pits are awesome!! You can tell playing at Wembley was really a dream come true for them (plus the fact that Myles can't stop smiling and laughing says it all)

Highlight of the concert in my opinion: The breathtaking wonderful life/watch over you combination.

Overall an amazing DVD that YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO BUY!!",1332892800,2,583,4.542857142857143
5043800,4,B006ZRINCO,"This is a beautiful bluray.  All aspects including including sound, picture, camera angles all put together what a hi-def bluray should look like. It is much better quality than their first bluray, which was also excellent.

I do have a complaint, however; which is Myles' unnecessary cursing and lack of finishing the vocals on some of the songs. I understand that its just a live thing, but i do not remember him doing this when seeing them live. Mark, Brian and Scott all get 5 stars for their performances.

To this day, Alterbridge remains one of the most underrated bands in all of rock.",1332806400,,593,4.6826923076923075
5043801,5,B006ZRINCO,"I simply cannot comprehend why these guys are not bigger in the United States. Myles, Mark, Scott and Brian are all at the pinnacle of what a true artist is in their own respects. I will forever be an Alter Bridge fan! \m/

This Blu Ray is extremely high quality--the production team hit a grand slam. DTS-High Definition Audio. IS. AMAZING. Do yourself a favor and get a A/V Receiver with this sound decoder if you don't have one already (Denon, Pioneer, Yamaha, Marantz, etc.).

The video quality is also awesome. The light show is amazing. 1080p baby!

I've seen Alter Bridge live several times, and I would have given anything to have been there at Wembley. They always sound great live, but I think they put their best efforts into this performance not only because they were at Wembley, but because they were making history. That was recorded with some of the best equipment available. Win. Win. Win!

Highly highly recommended!

--Rhys M.
