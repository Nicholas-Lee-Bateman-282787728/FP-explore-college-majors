334876,5,6301379616,"I have loved this movie since I saw it the first time when I was about 10 years old. Gregory Hines and Sammy Davis are incredible dancers, and so are all of the others in this film. If you like great dancers, you have to see this movie. The plot is believeable, the characters develop well, and you'll love the ending. This is a great movie which will be around for a long time, I hope.",1030924800,10,386,4.092105263157895
334877,5,6301379616,"The story is just a story, but oh the dancing is sweet.",1023753600,3,55,3.6666666666666665
334878,4,6301379616,I bought this video some time ago and watch it from time to time.  I like the fact tribute was paid to the old timers.  That was really a treat to watch.  The plot was not weak to me.  It is the same with everyone.  You want to live the good life but some people don't want to work for it.  It's basic.  What's wrong with that. The movie was very tasteful to me.  I don't watch a lot of TV and movies but when I do I would like to watch something that is tasteful.  This movie is a classic in my house.  I wish he would make more movies that he dances in he really is a great dancer let alone a great actor.,1008892800,8,607,3.746031746031746
334879,3,6301379616,"I stumbled across this while getting over a cold and couldn't switch away from it.  Whether that was due to the lethargy of sickness or a commentary on the film quality I wasn't sure.  Gregory Hines plays a tap dancing ex-con who finds his way back into his old steps, both dance and burglary.  The movie never gets too deep or preachy and retains its light hearted quality throughout.  The tap scenes between Hines, his ex-girlfriend, and his 60 year old plus cohorts at the dance studio are very impressive.  Sammy Davis Jr. stars in his last role as the ailing father of Hines' girlfriend, looking for one last big show before he taps off to the Candyman-land in the sky.  Overall, a decent little film, very old fashioned in its pacing and delivery, I was surprised when it drew me in, but it did.",1004313600,2,801,4.489655172413793
334880,4,6301379616,See this movie again if it's been years for you--or if there was any doubt in your mind that Savion Glover is a prodigy. Gregory Hines does a great job acting and dancing and the story is a great showcase for so many little parts by tap greats.,1000166400,3,244,4.104166666666667
334881,4,6301379616,"If you are a fan of tap, dancing, good rhythm, toe tapping and cheering on an underdog, you will love this movie also!  I think there was genius involved in using all the old greats, including Sammy!  The story is a  little weak, but who cares when the dancing starts?  That's what this movie  is all about.....and what a start for a promoting such a talent as young Mr  Glover......",943747200,30,383,4.4

Gregory Hines, Sandman Sam, Mr. Nicholas, Mr. Glover, and all the others were and are amazing dancers. The storyline is not what I looked at this movie for.

This movie is a classic for those who love tap dance topped off with love stories between Max and Amy; Max and Amy's son; and the love shared for tap dance by youngsters and old timers, alike.  Tap was released at a time when you rarely saw a black man and black woman in a love scene. It will always have a special place in my heart for that very reason. Gregory and Suzzane brought passion to the screen. Thank you!",1460332800,,466,4.166666666666667

335353,5,6301379616,"If you like tap  you will love this film. If you like the Fred Astaire, Gene Kelley type, this is not for  you. This is tap that comes from the environment. If there is a dripping faucet, a scratching sound, rain on a roof,  any kind of regular rhythm, and the dancer puts it into his dance. Gregory Hines is superb in this film about this kind of tap dancing. There's also a group of older men, including Sammy Davis Jr. who also do this kind of dancing who are in it also.  I can't remember the whole plot but  Hines character is trying to get his wife and son back and win some kind of prize.

However, Tap's primary purpose is to introduce the viewer into the beauty and transcendence of tap dancing and also to provide an incomparable nod to an unacknowledged pool of talent. Many of the people in this movie have ""passed on,"" so in honor of my ancestors, I watch this movie and soak in its beauty and allow them ""good ole days"" to surround my soul and my mind and in that connection, I reach back to the past and breathe in its TRUTH and allow myself to FEEL a kinship that is beyond space, time, and prejudice.",1411084800,,709,4.503875968992248

The story line  is just  filler, and a link between the dance numbers.  Gregory Hines' character Max is released from prison and returns home, he is conflicted about returning to his criminal life or dancing and his dance 'family'. He is conflicted internally and being pressured externally by his old  criminal associates, his old love, and the father of his old love , played by the great Sammy Davis Jr..

Though the music is OUTSTANDING; the constant spins on the step made it virtually impossible to learn how to do the moves for a beginning stepper.  They tell the basic steppers to follow Janie but Janie is often doing the same moves as the instructor.  It was very frustrating following Janie who seemed to forget that she was supposed to be doing the moves in a more basic form.

I recommend this DVD for people who are used to doing a LOT OF SPINS on the step and, therefore, are used to not watching the instructor every minute of the workout.",1365811200,,611,4.333333333333333

335829,5,6301379616,"I have to say this is my favorite step workout to date.  I had an absolute blast learning the choreography in this.  Deirdre Morris is very likeable and an excellent instructor.  She moves along quickly so you can't get bored.  The choreography is advanced so if you are new to stepping, this is definitely not the one to buy.  Initially, I had a bit of trouble trouble learning all the choreography but learning the moves is half the fun and the fun level was way up there. She offers 3 premixes which I was delighted with. One does the first half of the workout with the warm up and cool down and abs- the 2nd premix does just the 2nd half of the workout with the warm up cool down and abs. The 3rd premix is a must for step workouts in my opinion.  It is the finished product - all combinations in their entirety all put together run through multiple times. No breakdown - for advanced exercisers and step enthusiasts this is essential.  I don't want to do the breakdown of each combo after I have already learned it over and over.  Believe me, this is boring.  Once you know how - you just want to run through it.  The last premix also includes the warmup, the abs and cooldown.  This workout is a keeper!!",1364774400,,1210,4.3097345132743365

The movie also had legendary tap dancers, including Sandman Sinks, and especially Sammy Davis Jr. Also (back as a kid, Savion Glover). The songs were great!

When you hear someone talk about the greatest dancers you usually hear names like Michael Jackson, Fred Astaire, Sammy Davis Jr., or others. I would put Gregory Hines right up there with them. When you watch this guy dance, you are watching the very definition of dance and entertainment. Not only does it have the final performance of Sammy Davis Jr. on film, it also shows off some of the ORIGINAL dancers of Vaudeville such as Howard ""Sandman"" Sims, Bunny Briggs, Arthur Duncan, Jimmy Slyde and many others. All of whom perform there great and most impressive dance routines. IMPORTANT NOTICE: YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BE A FAN OR BE A STUDENT OF TAP OR DANCE TO ENJOY THIS MOVIE!!!

336078,4,6301379616,"Gregory Hines isn't with us anymore, so what's the use of wishing? Still, I wish the man - who was surely the best tap dancer of his generation - had done more movies which featured his dancing skills. I saw him play hoofers in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Cotton-Club/dp/B00005IA7Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Cotton Club</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/White-Nights/dp/B000GDH9JQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">White Nights</a>&nbsp;and this one, TAP, and I couldn't really get enough. It's true that TAP gets bogged down with a hackneyed side story, and this does take away from the overall enjoyment of the film. But the electrifying dance sequences go a long way to making TAP a must-see flick. Only, nowadays, I tend to fast-forward thru the parts where Max Washington is being lured back to a life of crime.

Max Washington, of course, is who Gregory Hines plays, and Hines inhabits the role so naturally that it didn't strike me 'til later that there's a bit of a dichotomy in a hard-bitten, resentful ex-con also being a tap dancer. I guess nowadays tap dancing is regarded as foofoo stuff, something for the well-bred Nancies. Except that tap, way back, was the equivalent of breakdancing and krumping and whatever else hip form of street dance is currently making the rounds. I know it sounds like a bit of ""What? Really?"" but folks used to battle on the street corner in the style of tap, challenging each other, striving to impress their homies, and trying to come up with the best moves and rhythms and cadences. My point being, that Max Washington as both a tap dancer and a criminal isn't that far of a stretch.

Quick catch-up to the premise: Max is the son of legendary tap dancer Sonny Washington. Max himself was a dance prodigy, but gave up on his talent to hang out with the wrong sorts. Now newly released from prison, he's torn between his love for dancing and the temptation of the easy, ill-gotten life.

But, as mentioned, the gangster subplot is pretty lame. Instead, it's all about the dancing and also about Max's relationships with the folks up at Sonny's Side of the Street, a tap dance studio housing Max's old flame and also a host of legendary tap dancing performers. And it's this side of the cast which lends the film its luminosity. Start off with Suzzanne Douglas, who is beautiful and feisty and sizzles in her scenes with Hines. When Douglas was cast for the role, she wasn't a trained tap dancer, but she learned how to do the thing (or fake it well enough) under tap dancer Henry LeTang's tutelage that, on the screen, you couldn't tell that she's new to tap. She looks natural and entirely effortless in the Rogers & Astaire-type rooftop number with Hines.

TAP brings together three generations of tap dancers. Savion Glover was 14 or 15 years old when he co-starred in this one, and he demonstrates not only his pretty impressive skills (but why only one dance outing for him?) but that he can also act. Nowadays, Savion Glover is the closest thing to an ambassador for tap that we have, and dude is doing his best. It's just that I get the sense that the tap dancing culture is slowly fading out.

Meanwhile, if you've been around for the past three decades, especially in the '80s, then you know that Gregory Hines held it down for his generation.

""Now I know you guys were good in your day, but since you ain't got no legs anymore..."" is Max's observation to Little Mo (Sammy Davis, Jr., in  his last film), and maybe it was an inadvertent slip of the tongue, but maybe it wasn't. Anyway, that comment leads to the absolute highlight of the movie: the Challenge number. In a hazy, nostalgia-drenched sequence, legendary tap dancers Howard ""Sandman"" Sims (perfectly, grumpily hilarious), Jimmy Slyde, Pat Rico, Steve Condos, Arthur Duncan, Bunny Briggs, Harold Nicholas, and, of course, Sammy Davis, Jr. himself all form a circle and show off their signature moves. And, from what I got out of the bonus features, a lot of this stuff was improvised. There's a lot of improv dancing that went on in this film, and I think that gave TAP a certain dynamic energy and freshness.

Another highlight is when Max is talked into taking a barful of dancers out into Times Square to demonstrate how his father was able to pick up tap moves merely from listening to noises off the bustling New York streets. This sequence ends up feeling the most staged, but the energy in this number is off the charts. I will say, though, that this has to be the most good-natured, accommodating crew of construction workers ever, as Max and his enthusiastic group of dancers and musicians proceed to take over a construction site without as much as a by-your-leave.

The DVD bonus features are worth checking out: Director Nick Castle's film commentary (recorded in 2004) and four documentaries: ""The Movie"" (the behind-the-scenes look, 29:15 minutes long), ""What Tap Is"" (the cast talks tap and tap dancer Alfred Desio goes on a bit about his experiments with manipulating tap with synthesizers, 26:24 minutes), ""About Gregory"" (a loving reflection on Gregory Hines, 21:15 minutes), ""Old Timers"" (a whole mess of reflecting and reminiscing by some of the cast's legendary tap dancers, including some massive props dropped on Sammy Davis, Jr. - 25:30 minutes).

Okay, my feeling is that the last dance number doesn't really live up. This climactic sequence is supposed to bridge the gap between tap and rock music, and so allow tap dancing to live on. Max's tap shoes are miked up and hooked to synthesizers as Max does his thing while fronting a bluesy rock band. But it doesn't really pan out. There's a purity that's stripped away when you replace the tap shoe's natural clickety-clackiness with synthesized claptrap. As Savion Glover says, ""The integrity of the dance should be maintained between the wood and that tap.""

TAP works as a loving homage and, in parts, as a sheer entertainer. Gregory Hines turns in a very good performance, both with acting and dancing, although I say his best stuff can still be found in WHITE NIGHTS (WHITE NIGHTS, TAP, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Running-Scared/dp/B00005N89R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Running Scared</a>&nbsp;are my three favorite Gregory Hines movies). Gregory Hines is graceful, although he doesn't have the grace and lightness of, say, a Fred Astaire. What Hines has is this driving, forceful energy, a rugged athleticism, and this hunkered down intensity, never more typified than in the opening moments in the prison cell, as Max Washington wakes his fellow inmates with a ferocious barrage of tap. The inmates' protests eventually turn to grudging applause, with one inmate's voiced endorsement ringing out above the rest. ""Let the man dance!"" Yay for the power of tap.",1253923200,6,6897,5.0678414096916296

It starts with a vigorous warm-up (on and off the step) and then goes into a single step 45 minute routine and a short 5 minute double-step (two steps side-by-side) routine.
The 45 minute portion is a truly advanced workout.  I had to replay portions (which I don't mind doing) to get some of the steps.  I consider myself an intermediate to advanced stepper.  Towards the end, I just did my own moves to keep my heartrate up and watched the DVD so I would be ready for the next time.  I appreciate the fact that this is interestting enough to want to continue learning.
The cool down is sufficient and the stretch is a little short for me, but I usually complete a yoga stretch on my own after working out, so it didn't bother me.

What this REALLY is - and this part I like - is an excuse for Hines and fellow hoofers to strut their stuff. In fact, Hines puts on one of the best exhibitions of tap dancing I have ever seen.

I am not unfit - yet I had to take two breaks during this workout which is a sign that I'm doing a workout that's out of my comfort zone.  It doesn't let up from start to finish and while you're doing tough choreography to begin with, like the title says, there aren't a lot of taps (which help you transition usually to the next move).  At one point, you can even put two steps together (although you don't have to).  If you use two steps, you better have the space to do it in.
I don't want to put people off buying this.  It's definately what you want in a workout because it really pushes you and gives you something to work towards.

The date is August 29, 2006 so get ready!  This movie is tap dance history! Great tap dancers old and young join forces to bring to the screen a celluloid history lesson for those who care to be educated.  This is one of my favorite movies and while I haven't been able to watch it since Gregory's passing in August, 2003, I plan to celebrate on the release date.

  The storyline involves a man's struggle to accept who he is. The background of dance gives us the chance to watch the magic of Gregory's character's growth.  There are strong performances from Gregory and Sammy of course, but you get to see a young Savion Glover in the process of soaking up all that he sees. There are also strong performances from overlooked actors Suzzanne Douglas, as a woman from Max's past who loves him and tries to help him and Joe Morton, who tries to convince Max that all he will ever be is a thief.  The performances of master tappers Sandman Sims, Harold Nicolas and Jimmy Slyde are worth the purchase price of the dvd. The ""challenge"" segment of the movie is priceless.

  While watching this movie may be somewhat sad for those of us who feel the loss of many of these talented individuals,  we should rejoice that we now have a package that showcases their excellence. You can see how personally happy Gregory Hines is to be dancing alongside his childhood idol Sammy Davis, Jr.  This is really Gregory's story. Sammy was his inspiration. Gregory and Maurice (Greg's brother) studied all the greats, many of whom are in this film.  Gregory's mentor, Henry LeTang, who is the movie's choreographer, passed that love and excellence on to Gregory and Gregory passed it on to Savion.  This is the real story of tap dance.  It's about love, friendship, family, history and destiny. It's fast and it's energetic.  You don't even have to know a thing about tap dance, but buy this movie and I promise you, you will feel great after watching it.",1154217600,5,2095,4.571045576407506

336216,5,6301379616,"I had the privilige to see this film, soon after Gregory Hines succumbed to cancer at age 57.  There is a good reason why ""Tap"" is considered one of the best films Hines ever starred in.  It showcases his talent and innovation as a truly masterful tap dance and showman.  From the very beginning of the film, where we see him dancing freestyle in his prison cell, you know that this is no ordinary dance film.  The power of this film lies in one of its central themes--that music exsists all around us.  Whether you are walking down the street, listening to construction workers driling holes in the concrete, or just tapping on any hard surface, rhythm is universal.

This story is centered on Max Washington (Gregory Hines), a truly great tap dancer who is serving time in Sing Sing for armed robbery.  In spite of his troubled past, he also left behind a tap dance community, for whom he left a great impression, and also became a family unit for him.  Particularly, he left behind his former dance partner (Suzanne Douglas) and her son (a young Savion Glover--let me tell you, he could truly move even back then), for whom he was something of a surrogate father.  What's more, the older dance community (which includes the late, great Sammy Davis Jr.) is still engaging in ""cutting challenges,"" even though most of them are in their seventies.  But, like fine wine, they only have improved with age.

This is a great, period piece from the eighties, that combines Hines' infectious talent with a rock n' roll backdrop.  Though, this might sound kind of dated, it really isn't and will leave you wanting more......This film ends way too soon, and it would be great to see what dance numbers were left on the cutting room floor.",1132444800,2,1730,4.636065573770492

I can assure anyone to buy this film and you will feel the same energy during the dance segments. I would also like to note, one of the other reviews here said the opening seen of Gregory Hines dancing in jail was a down side to the film, thats because the reviewer did not know the essence of the shot, in which the Idea came to Gregory Hines from Sandman Sims when he was told the the story of Sandman Being arrested in Los Angeles California for ""late hour vagrancy"" while ""challenge"" dancing on a street corner to earn money. When Sandman Appeared in front of the judge a number of days later the judge asked what where you doing? Sandman replied dancing and the judge said what kind of dancing? Sandman Sims showed him a ""time step"" and with a swift decision the judge said ""case dismissed"". So this just goes to say don't be so fast to judge anything if you don't know the history first""

336271,5,6301379616,"Biography

  Howard ""Sandman"" Sims was a distinctive and influential tap dancer who gained his nickname from dancing on the sand he sprinkled on a tap board. Sandman Sims was famed for the range of percussive sounds his sand-dancing could produce - from the sweetest brushing to the most abrasive grinding.

  Although he had tap-danced since 3, he discovered his style accidentally while training to be a boxer and shuffling his feet in a rosin box.  The result earned him widespread acclaim and sustained him during the decline of tap in the 1950s and '60s.

  ""They called the board my Stradivarius,"" Sandman  liked to say."" I could use any kind of music - or I could do it without any music at all.""

  He was born Jan. 24, 1918 in Fort Smith, Ark., but would grow up in Los Angeles.  One of 10 children, he began dancing with his brothers on street corners.  Tap dancing was the street dance, the break dancing of his time. He would walk around with his tap shoes laced over his shoulder, Because the kids helped make a living for the family in his day!  ""People would throw down their shoes in front of you and said, ""Challenge""!  This was later dramatized in the movie Tap and an episode of The Cosby Show called Mr. Sandman..

  After breaking his hand twice, he gave up boxing and danced in Latin America before Archie Moore, the prize fighter, drove him to New York City in 1947 after World War II.  There Sandman  joined "" The Hoofers ."" They  characterized the hoofing style of dance. Unlike the heel-and-toe tap performed by Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly, a hoofer's steps use the whole foot.

  Dance historian Sally Sommer has described Sandman's tap style as strong and vigorous: ""body hunkered over, knees bent, feet digging into the floor - and his sand dance was characterized by clear, quick rhythms and subtle nuances.""

  People would say they liked the effect of shuffling in a rosin box, so he glued sand to a board, but wore out his shoes. Then he tried gluing sand to his shoes, but wore out the board. Finally loose on the sand board was the solution.

  He worked at the famed Apollo Theater in Harlem for the next 17 years, in the stage left lower balcony he played side kick to famed Executioner of that era Puerto Rico around the mid 1950s, shortly after and for the 30+ years, he acted in the part of ""the executioner"" which would soon later stand out of the role and just be recognized as ""Sandman"" who escorted unpopular or downright awful performers off the stage on amateur nights by dressing  in hilarious outfits and chase the unsuccessful entertainers in mid-song, firing a blank pistol at them or taunting a chair, tambourine or broken plastic bat!.

  He said in a 1987 New York Times interview, ""performers wait outside to beat me up.""  He told disconsolate losers about how he himself had to return 10 times before being allowed to finish his act.  But then he danced up storm upon storm and won 25 straight contests, a record that led to the four-win limit now in effect.

  He also worked as the Apollo's stage manager and supported himself as a carpenter, mechanic and tap teacher.  His students included such stellar dancers and stars such as Gregory Hines,  Ben Vereen, Emmanuel Lewis, Savion Glover even Bill Bojangles Robinson and Sammy Davis Jr were fascinated by his signature sand dance. Star boxers, such as Muhammad Ali, Archie Moore and Sugar Ray Robinson came to him to improve their  footwork.

  Sandman Sims owned a caf on 125th Street in Harlem and was a regular in the vaudeville scene. He also held his own Amateur Hour at the Lenox Lanes bowling alley on West 146th street in Harlem.

  In 1984, Mr. Howard ""Sandman"" Sims  won a National Heritage Fellowship award, from The National Endowment for the Arts for his craft.  ""I thought I was making noise all these years,"" he said at the time. ""Now they're calling it culture.""

  In 1986, he appeared in ""The Sand Dancer,"" a play by poet Sandra Hochman inspired by his life and career.  ""I wanted my feet to sound like shooting stars,"" the Sandman character says. Sandman Sims, who danced in that production, was good with words himself.  ""I'm in show business not for a season, but a reason!""

  He narrated and appeared in the documentary ""No Maps On My Taps""- 1979, he was also widely seen in the film ""Tap"", Harlem Nights, The Cotton Club, A Gathering Of Old Men and the PBS special ""Tap Dance In America"", starring Hines and the Hoofers. He also toured widely in the 1980s, dancing in 53 countries as an embassador for the U.S. State Department.

  Sandman was a ""virtuoso among virtuosos,"" said dance critic Anna Kisselgoff, ""in a class by himself.""

  The Howard Sandman Sims Corp. is continuing the legacy of Sandman through ""The Sandman Sims Feet First Foundation,"" which is a non-for profit agency that is implementing free dance programs in various school systems. The Sand Dancer Production Company will  continue with The Sandman's legacy in tap on film, television, stage.

  Sandman Sims' made the transition on May 20, 2003 at the age of 86, although he long maintained that his age was ""a matter of opinion.""  He is survived by his wife, Solange; his daughter Diane Sims Jones; his son Howard Sims Jr, 5 grandchildren, Shannon, Daniel, Shardonnai, Christopher, Tatianna, Eugenia Sims (daughter in-law)  Troy Jones (son in-law), Joe Sims (brother) and Janie B Scaggs (sister).",1108944000,24,5402,4.7005347593582885

Just thinking about this movie brings back memories of watching it with my family, and it was one of my fathers favorite movies. I enjoyed everything about this movie the plot the cast, the set and so forth. The dancing scenes were exciting and just to see the growth of the characters from beginning to the end was enjoyable.

336277,5,6301379616,"It's strange and a bit sad to watch this movie now.  Earlier this week the world heard that dancer/singer/actor Gregory Hines had passed on at the age of 57.  In his obituary there was a comment that, while multi- talented, Hines always considered himself first and foremost, a dancer.  This movie from the late 80s shows that to be true in all it's wonderful glory.
 Possible Spoilers.....
 The movie opens on a man in a cell.  The darkness surrounds him and he looks pained.  Slowly he begins to listen to the noise around him.  Before you know it the man in on his feet and dancing to the rhythms and sounds of the life in prison.  The dance is one of pain but also as it goes forth brings out relaxation as anger is spent but most importantly the man begins to feel joy.  Jump forward to the man, Max Washington (Gregory Hines) being released on paroll.  He has just spent a few years in Sing Sing.  Originally he was sentenced for Grand Theft but time was added on for Assault & Battery of a prison guard.
 Max returns to his old neighborhood and takes a hotel room across from a run down building which houses the ""Sunny Side of the Street"" tap dance studio.  As  time goes on we learn that was his father's studio but first you see the various classes taught on the first two levels by an old love interest, Amy (Suzzane Douglas) and her son Lewis (Savion Glover).  The true joy of the building is the third floor where the old ""Hoofer's"" reside.  Here we find a virtual who's who of the tap dance world with many of the old masters portraying themselves and of course Sammy Davis, Jr. playing Little Mo.
 Max is not originally totally welcomed back by everyone except for Lewis who looks up to Max as a father, which strongly portrays some of the real life feelings that occurred between Hines and Glover, and Little Mo who has some big ideas of how to get the rock and roll world interested in the tap world.  Unfortunately for Mo, Max has a chip on his shoulder regarding the life his father led and the lack of finances that he grew up with.  It seems that Max has another family, one in which Max was a first rate second-story man...until the night he got caught and ended in jail.
 The movie is one of conflict between the worlds of the alleged easy and plentiful money and the hard work, no glory, no money world of music.  As much as Max hates it this is the world that is within him and continues to draw him back time and time again.
 Hines was a supremely talented man.  He could act, he could sing, and man he could dance like no other.  He expressed himself in so many ways that it almost didn't seem fair to the rest of us.  Here his character of Max is full of rage and anger.  He bears a lifetime of resentment at what he perceived his father's life to have been worth and he knows what he has to do to make it better.  The anger is almost palpable as it floats off his body.  The look in his eyes and the set of his jaws tells people that he isn't going to take any more.  That same rage appears at first in his dance.  He doesn't just lightly dance on the floor a la Fred Astaire.  He pounds the floor and lets it feel his frustration.  He attacks it with percussive beats and syncopated rhythms that make the listeners instantly step back...but then the joy appears.  First it come in the way he dives across the floor and moves free for all the world and then it reaches Hines eye's and you know at that moment that all will be well for this man.
 The dance sequences alone in this movie are worth sitting through.  Hines has most of them starting with the dance inside the jail cell but there are also moments such as the instruction at the construction site as well as the end sequence when he is working with the rock band that are almost hard to sit through.  For long time fans of the genre, the ""Challenge"" segment is a treat as all the old greats get out and show just why they made the business what it was.  Also, there is a brief flash of the style from Savion Glover's character at one moment that shows why he was a star at such a young age and gives hints as to his future success with Bring in the Noise, Bring in the Funk!
 The world has lost a great talent this week.  But movies like this and Bojangles will be around for years to come and will allow fans to share one last time the joy of seeing a true talent at work in his field.",1060905600,81,4376,4.206482593037215
336278,4,6301379616,"See this movie for the dancing only!  The dancing.  It's difficult to imagine Gregory Hines as a criminal, ex-prisoner, so that portrayal doesn't come off well.  He's not that, he's Gregory Hines the tap dancer.  The plot sandwiches typical scenes perfunctorily -  the release of the prisoner into society, looking for a job, love interest, crime, etc.  There really isn't a storyline, just a remanufacture of  stale overused scenes.  The cohesive element that makes a story work is missing, characters don't build, and it's predictable.

But what works is the dancing.  See it for that.  The film was shot with a smoky sepia-tone image, that impression of both black and white and color.  Watch youthful Savion Glover shine!  The older hoofers, Jimmy Slide, Arthur Duncan (from the Lawrence Welk Show), Sammy Davis, etc.  This dancing ensemble might just be the ""best"" part of the film.  ....Rizzo",1057449600,24,898,5.054794520547945
