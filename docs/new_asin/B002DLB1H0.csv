3911373,5,B002DLB1H0,"Kyle Schid, Dylan Neal, Chrisina Cox & Jaimie Alexander (Kyle XY)  are the leading characters in both seasons of Blood Ties. Each episode is better than the last one. Sadly, this highly entertaining series was ended too soon, similiar to ""Moonlighting"".

This is a five star product-",1257292800,2,283,5.0
3911374,4,B002DLB1H0,this season of blood ties is so much better than the first. i was glad to have bought it and will recommend it to others.,1255737600,,121,3.88
3911375,3,B002DLB1H0,"To clear up some of the confusion brought on by the reviews written before Season 2 of Blood Ties was actually released on DVD:

1) There were 22 episodes filmed according to the Internet Movie Database and the Lifetime Network website.

2) In the US and Canada (Region 1), the first twelve episodes are on the ""Season One"" DVDs and the last 10 episodes are on the ""Season Two"" DVDs.

3) In the UK (Region 2), all 22 episodes are in one DVD set which is labeled ""The Complete First Season."" It probably should have been called ""The Complete Series.""

Other than that, image quality is about the same on the R1 and R2 DVDs. Both R1 and R2 are widescreen even though the R1 DVD case says ""4:3 Screen Format."" They are also English only and have no subtitles.

The only bonus features on the US (R1) version are the Season One trailer and a photo gallery with 32 still photos. The UK (R2) version has no bonus features.

If you have a multiregion DVD player, the UK version from Amazon UK is a far better deal.

Without a doubt, this exceptional series deserves 6 stars and the studio deserves 0 stars for not selling the complete series in one set for a combined rating of 3 stars.",1255219200,35,1179,4.3561643835616435
3911376,5,B002DLB1H0,"I love this series. I wish it was still going. It is always a shame when a great series is canceled. I'm just glad I have it to watch over and over. Great actors and the writers had great imaginations. And I love it when the vampire is the good guy. The series reminds me of the series ""Supernatural"" except it is a vampire that is one of the hunters. I think anyone who likes ""Supernatural"" will like this series.",1254441600,4,414,4.1875
3911377,5,B002DLB1H0,"I can safely say I was addicted to this show!  Kyle Schmid as vampire Henry Fitzroy is most definitely the hottest vampire ever....whether on the big screen or the small.  This show was funny, it had action, great chemistry between its characters and it was never given a chance by LifetimeTV.  It ended with such a cliffhanger I figured we'd at least get a TV movie to tie things up, but we never got a thing.  The show was based on Tanya Huff's Blood Books, but the show was far superior to the books.  In the UK the whole show was sold as one set of DVDs.  They needed to wring a few more bucks out of us here in the US, but that's okay.  My favorite ""vampire"" show ever!",1248134400,19,674,4.138461538461539
3911378,4,B002DLB1H0,"The center of ""Blood Ties"" has always been the love triangle between PI Vicky Nelson, cop Mike Celucci, and vampire Henry Fitzroy.

But that love triangle starts constricting painfully in the second season of ""Blood Ties,"" which finishes the all-too-short horror/mystery series. The plots are solid whodunnits and thrillers that center around strange supernatural beasties and items, and the trio of lead actors are excellent (particularly the striking Kyle Schmid). The one problem is the ending -- it's a big fat ""to be continued"" that leaves you craving a wrap-up TV movie.

When a wealthy man is brutally killed, Mike (Dylan Neal) knows he has the right suspect, a sneering woman who was at the crime scene. The problem is, the man died from being savaged by a giant cat -- and Mike saw her eyes glow when she was upset. So Vicki (Christina Cox) and Henry (Schmid) start investigating the woman's home and her family -- and uncover an ancient family secret and a tragic loss.

Among the other cases they handle: creepy art and men drowned with oil paint, a mysterious box that sticks Vicki in a time loop, a Goth club being threatened by a strange drug and insect attacks, a gang of truckjackers accidentally let loose an Incan mummy, and a murderer who suddenly changes his story (claiming psychic visions). And Henry unexpectedly seeks Mike's help when another vampire starts killing in his territory... leading to a reunion with the slinky Christina, his ex-lover/vampire-mother, who's got a nasty problem that is more than it seems.

Unfortunately, all this supernatural stuff is slowly crumbling away Mike's professional credibility, and the relationship between the three of them is getting increasingly tense. When an old demonic enemy returns to attack Coreen, Vicki must depend on both men to help -- but it may not be enough.

""Blood Ties Season Two"" is in some ways darker and more desperate than the first season, now that Vicki has gotten totally immersed in the world of the supernatural (and Mike is starting to sink in too). But the core of the series is much the same -- it still sticks to the monster/artifact-of-the-week formula (""Talismans don't kill people; people kill people""), and maintains that distinctly dark, grimy feel, with lots of pale light, shadowy urban streets and a very unusual vampire.

And the murky mysteries are nicely speckled with gritty action sequences, monsters both typical (werethingies!) and unique (bug demons!), and some painfully bittersweet moments, such as the tragic fate of an out-of-control, self-loathing vampire. But the writers keep things tongue-in-cheek, and have some wonderfully quirky dialogue (""Don't you have a lucky shirt or socks?"" ""I have a bonnet that Anne Boleyn gave me right before she tried to poison me. I'm still here, so I guess you could call that lucky"").

The biggest problem with ""Blood Ties Season Two""? The ending. It's abundantly clear that there was a third season intended that would dealt with the myriad hanging plot threads -- namely the fractured love triangle and the whole Astaroth problem -- but it never happened. So the ending is depressing and unsatisfying. Come on, make us a TV movie!

Kyle Schmid actually steals the limelight in this season -- Henry becomes a more passionate, tragic figure as he deals with some of his past demons, while thankfully maintaining his sexy-trickster attitude (after admitting that he likes Celucci, he adds, ""I'm gonna regret having to draw him being eaten by hellhounds""). And he pulls off even potentially-cheesy scenes, such as when Henry describes to the half-blind Vicki how luminous and vibrant the world looks to him.

But Christina Cox and Dylan Neal still hold their own -- Vicki seems more at peace with her new ""night life"" and the crimes she has to investigate, but her emotional life is even more snarled than it was before. She's getting pulled in two directions, and it now hurts. And Mike is slowly coming to terms with Henry's presence -- and evens seems buddyish once or twice. But the slow destruction of his career and his nice comfortable life is a painful thing to watch.

""Blood Ties Season Two"" has an unsatisfactory finale, but it's still a solid fantasy/horror/mystery series that is one of the better vampire shows to make it to TV. Definitely give it a watch.",1245974400,61,4323,4.958563535911602

This show made its mark more along the lines of the cases solved - the mysteries in each episode, versus a simple vampire storyline or concentrating on blood and gore, similar to something like The Dresden Files (2007).  Of course, there was some blood and gore - it is a vampire/paranormal show, after all, and some creative myths and stories, making it a very enjoyable view.",1404604800,,543,4.75531914893617

3911420,5,B002DLB1H0,"This show reminds me of another cut short show (firefly) that I fully enjoyed cancelled too soon. If you enjoyed buffy the vampire slayer or angel or true blood, then you will enjoy this one with a more adult mind set (though unfortunately lacking in a lot of adult content partly due to this once being on regular tv, like buffy--and made as short seasons or half seasons and only 2 of them, if it had more time maybe more adult sexual them would have come in with some of the 3 main characters). I loved watching this crime drama with a usual supernatural villian getting his/her/its booty kicked by a going blind nonsuperpowered grownup buffy character with the help of a playful at times and serious at times sexy vampire, with the ex also throwing in some police help and giving some comedy of competing against vamp for the affections of the female lead.

It's got it's cliche moments, sometimes downright cheesy, but you have to judge the whole, not the one or two moments that disagreed with you.  I really loved this show when it was on and was rooting for it all the way.  Even doing the write in campaign like everyone else, to no avail.  It was doomed to fail, but not because of low numbers.  It had a following and it was growing in strength.  Their production company failed them is what I heard.  Anyway, buy season one and immerse urself into Vicky's world, then buy this one and love the longing.  You won't regret it.  :D",1389657600,,617,4.2956521739130435

3911424,5,B002DLB1H0,"I loved this series when it was on TV. Vicki Nelson, P.I. was quite a woman!  It is so very rare to see a TV series where the lead is a strong female! And she's strong and in charge even though there are also two very handsome and strong men around.

Henry Fitzroy, the vampire is not just sexy or typical of the vampire genre. He's not evil, nor is he tortured by his ""evil nature"" like so many vampires. He's ""always had a pretty good opinion of himself, and hundreds of years of positive reinforcement.""

Michael Celluci, the human detective, and the third person in the love triangle is strong and handsome and very human.

There's a ""monster of the week"" in every episode, but the show is all about those three and how they deal with each other under difficult circumstances.",1387843200,2,780,4.433566433566433

Maybe the problem is me, I have a lot of rules in my life.  My family calls them rituals but they are all crazy so, screw that right?  One rule is hot vampire trumps underpaid adverage looking cop every time.

3911427,5,B002DLB1H0,This Canadian series about vampires had great acting by everyone in the cast and the love triangle always kept the plot line interesting.  Ranks right up there with the American series Moonlight,1366675200,2,194,5.0625

3911431,5,B002DLB1H0,"This show has something for everyone.

Henry is a vampire. Old legends style. He sleeps deeply during the day, completely unconscious. He was noble class when human.  He has Flawless Looks, a Warrior's Spirit, Rock Star Confidence, and Hypnotic Ability. He is nearly 500 years old, and very protective of Vicky.

Vicky is a an ex-cop, who became a private investigator. Her eye condition cost her the police career. In the first season she was nearly sacrificed to a demon. This left her permanently linked to the demon, by magical tattoos. The experience and tattoos have her marked, she's outside of normal life. The power in her tattoos draw the supernatural to her regularly.

Coreen's goth lifestyle makes her an amusing sidekick and her obsession with the supernatural makes her a valuable one. She brings youthful vitality and enthusiasm to the show.

Mike was Vicky's partner and lover when she was still a cop. He never stopped loving her. Henry, Vicky, and Mike are an explosive love triangle.",1356825600,,1003,4.946428571428571
3911432,5,B002DLB1H0,"Season 2, three discs, and each one worth watching more than once.

The background is simple, ex-cop now Lady investigator still has her male ex-partner inside the department as a ""source"".
She also has a relative of Henry VIII helping out as a quasi-after dark ""new associate"".
It's set in Toronto, a superbly metropolitan city.

I enjoy horror movies and scary generes, I prefer them when there's legend, myth or lore mixed in.
That's why the 5 stars, the sets were good, the acting well excecuted, the love triangle boiled and the case files intruging.
Why then was it cancelled?

The episodes build on each other until we discover that ultimately life's choices are our own to make, and any happy ending is our own to devise.
Love triangles don't often end well, surprisingly no one dies in this particular one, but as the season ends no one is exactly left getting their hearts desire, except perhaps the office help who really had a hearts desire.

The season finished in a way that left it open to continue - not because like so many of the genere it had very obviously run out of storylines and ideas. It still came accross as fresh, lively, vibrant.

Perhaps someday someone will resurrect the series, or at least the theme. It should have been a bigger, longer running hit than it apparently was.

Buy it, enjoy it, you'll want more in my subjective opinion.",1330214400,2,1368,4.655601659751038

3911446,4,B002DLB1H0,"I had been watching this on TV and found myself drawn to it. It has a bit of romance but it dosn't quite quench a vampire fan's thirst for love. The main characters are Vicki, Mike and Henry. Henry is nearly 500 years old and Vicki is a P.I. that he is attracted to. They end up working together on supernatural cases and though Henry is reluctant to get involved in anything not associated with him, he agrees to help Vicki.

It is obvious that Henry really likes Vicki, but the season falls short of a satisfying ending. Both season one and two show Vicki is attracted to Henry, but they never seem to go through with their desires. The triangle b/t Vicki, her previous partner Mike, and Henry is a constant tease. She doesn't end up choosing, ever! In a way, I ended up bitter towards her for taking such opportunities for granted. Henry gets closest to having her, but she still rejects him in some physical and verbal ways.

The entire season seemed to be focused on Henry and Vicki's friendship and the possibility of it becoming more. Leaving Henry hanging leads Henry to inviting Vicki to move with him. It is aggravating to watch her struggle with such a decision and end up in tears while a demon leaves the room in a human body. The demon tells Vicki he will see her again. Why ponder on the decision to go to a safer place? The last episode of season two will doubtlessly get viewers to try the books. Since there is no third season, the books are all viewers are left with to fill in the gaps.

The episodes are much darker and occasionally bloody compared to season one. There isn't as much ""fun"" to it. Its more like a horror/supspence movie. I was disappointment with the cut offs of some good scenes that seem to end abruptly.
The dvd pictures were good, but I really think season one and two could have been put together in one packet. The front cover is not very appealing either.",1269561600,,1899,4.404558404558404

Unfortunately, this can't be said about this DVD set. First, the DVD set only has 9 out of 10 Episodes of Season 2. The first Episode (""DOA"") is missing.

Worse, the format is horribly broken. The Show is 16:9 - but the data on the DVD is 4:3 with black bars on top and bottom. That looks ok on a 4::3 screen, but horrible on a 16:9 - you get a huge black frame all round the film. And even if you have  a player that can enhance this, the black bars are part of the signal - which means you loose resolution - and thus, quality, on the actual content.

3911450,5,B002DLB1H0,"This was a Christmas present for my daughter-in-law.  The only tiny negative is that the producers chose to artificially split what was a single season on TV into two ""seasons"" for dvd sales.  Thus my daughter-in-law got the first half for her birthday in June and the second for Christmas.  She loves them, so mission accomplished.",1264809600,,332,4.892857142857143

3911452,4,B002DLB1H0,"I am in agreement with a lot of the reviews.  This show suffered from being on the wrong channel.  The actors knew what kind of show they were in and it felt like they were having fun as they played their roles.  I adored Christina Cox as Vicki Nelson.  She was was warm, down to earth, and very funny.  Of course I loved Kyle Schmid as Henry Fitzroy.  He's gorgeous and a good actor for someone so young playing someone so old.  He carried himself with such confidence and elegance.  He played his fangs well through his sexy cockiness, romantic sense, and comic timing.  There was that little bit of sadness that played through him, too.  It made me want to know  more about his world.  How did he come through the ages and survive so well?  Nice touch his being a dark graphic novel writer. Dylan Deal, as Mike, brought a beautiful balance.  He's so handsome and a bit of tortured white knight.  Considering he wants Vicki as much as Henry does.  I enjoyed how the show solved murder mysteries and balanced the love triangle.  Very fun!  We should have gotten to know the TV shows take on how those sigil symbols on Vicki's wrists worked.  This show needed at least one more season.",1262563200,,1185,4.427906976744186
3911453,5,B002DLB1H0,"Loved the books, loved the show, love the DVDs.  This show was so well produced, acted, directed, written...  it is just too bad it was on the wrong network.  It never had a chance.

I highly recommend watching both season 1 and season 2 (in that order!).  Unfortunately, instead of coming out with one DVD purchase, we have to buy 2 DVDs.  But they ARE worth it!!!",1260576000,,365,4.373134328358209
3911454,4,B002DLB1H0,"At times the show is a bit slow, but overall I like it, Henry could bite me any day, lol.",1260576000,,89,3.5
3911455,4,B002DLB1H0,"Thought this was a great series. Although I did not care for the female investigator, I thought the vampire and police investigator were great.  They made the series worth watching. The lady investigator was the most self centered, unyeilding character I have seen in a long time. By the end of the series I felt she got what she deserved.",1258243200,,339,4.65
3911456,4,B002DLB1H0,"I enjoyed the show but found the books much more satisfying. That is pretty common for me with most books turned to tv or movies. The characters and plot seem fairly well done, I understood the story line and could follow the characters actions and motivation. All together I would rate the show an eight on the ten scale.",1257638400,,322,4.47457627118644
3911457,5,B002DLB1H0,The show needed allot of work but it was a precursor to all the vampire shows now airing.  The acting was great and I really miss this not being on.,1257638400,2,148,3.933333333333333
3911458,5,B002DLB1H0,"I gave this 5 stars because I've really enjoyed the first season and this second season has great episodes, but you can tell they got cut off at the knees when they were canceled. So I'd like to give the Lifetime network zero stars for canceling this really well done show.

The casting for this show was really great. Kyle Schmid is one of our heart throbs now. And I think the woman who played the medical examiner is my all-time favorite medical examiner on TV. Christina Cox was also well chosen. I've read all the books and I think she makes a great Vicki.

The show itself was suspenseful and usually had comedic overtones that I enjoyed. This DVD set is well worth the price, even though there are only 9 episodes and no special features. That was a disappointment. But its all worth it to watch Henry, especially when he goes all vampire. They did his vampire teeth (and overall look) right. His canines and second incisors extend and his forehead does not get bumpy and his veins do not pop all out. Henry's vamp look is very sexy.",1257379200,3,1040,4.439790575916231
