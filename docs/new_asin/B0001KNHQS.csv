Filmed in beautiful Lithuania, The Keeper of Time stars Michael O'Hearn, Adam T. Dawson, and Parker Alexander. Like any good movie, The Keeper of Time begins with children being killed by a demon. A good looking female shape-shifting demon, but still a demon. After two children bit the dust, we join the last child on the demon's hit list- little Timmy, the week from 12 year old farm boy. Timmy and his mother return to his home, only to find that a sinister looking women dressed in black has given their father/husband apples to eat. When Timmy states that he is not hungry, his mother replies with, ""Timmy, that's not grateful! Say thank you to the good lady,"" and promptly dies from apple poisoning. Timmy is quickly rescued from the demon by Bullrock, the bad-with-words sword wielding wizard want-to-be shirtless barbarian (played by Micheal O'Hearn, three times Mr. Universe), and Udo, the magic-less old kung fu instructor who knows the arcane secret of gunpowder. Watch for the sword-fight between Bullrock and a storm.

""This place is as good as any other place,"" says Udo, as he sets camp in the middle of a haunted swamp. We find that he may have been mistaken, when swamp zombies rise from the slime to attack Timmy and Friends. Having learned his lesson, the next night Udo has the party camp in the woods, surrounded by mutilated skeletons hanging from the trees. And he did all this AFTER a frantic woman had warned him, ""Whatever you do- Don't sleep on the ground!""

Overall, I found the movie very enjoyable, in a corny manner. I recommend this film as fodder for your own Mystery Science Fiction Theatre with friends, but don't expect the Lord of the Rings. Just remember to never sleep on the ground.",1468454400,,1764,4.739413680781759

8013772,5,B0001KNHQS,"This is the story of Bullrock, Udo, and... Tim. Yes, this movie has all of the quasi-Nordic/Dungeons&Deutschland names, and then the main character is Tim... not even Timothy. Just Tim. While this movie is not as stunningly mind-dumbing as O'Hearn's next masterpiece, Barbarian, it includes a sword fight with a thunder storm (ACTION SCENE!), a CGI floating sword that serves very little purpose (WHICH WAS SWEET!), a guy wearing a wizard costume (THE SEX APPEAL), and an evil sorceress who attempts to wield a battle ax when she finally decides to try to kill Bullrock (LOVE STORY!). If you like good CGI and a moving story line, a Nickleback music video would be a better choice.",1399248000,,681,4.879310344827586
8013773,5,B0001KNHQS,"in this small budget fantasy adventure movie a boy (about to turn 12) loses his family and finds the road before him hard to see but there are a few new friends that help him find himself.

Keeper of Time is very good - it has a good and wise heart but not much money (the production is not meant to be mind-blowing entertainment). the movie speaks quietly - it doesn't make a big noise. Keeper of Time has no big movie producers or directers and no big movie stars - just a humble but cool out of the way little movie with a fairy tale atmosphere.

give Keeper of Time some time and it will reveal a world of wonder, wisdom and spiritual meaning.",1321833600,2,647,4.168
8013774,3,B0001KNHQS,"A low-budget-film with a rather simple story. Acting is quite slow and stiff. Nearly no character development, only some with the boy (who is struggling with his destiny) and the girl (who, at a moment, vainly tries to escape her destiny).
The special effects are not very special, possibly due to the low budget.
There should have been more emotion in the film as the boy lost his parents.
The music is not used well: at the thrilling moments the music makes you want to go asleep.
So it is not an A-rated movie, but it may have been a brave first try.
In spite of all this, I liked the movie because of the very nice picturing.",1238112000,,629,4.338983050847458
8013775,2,B0001KNHQS,"I rented this from my public library, and spent 70 minutes laughing it. Maybe children under 4 who have no concept of cliched plots, bad acting, cheap props/costumes, low-tech special effects, and badly written scripts (which include lines such as: ""You ungrateful muscle-head!"" -Udo) might enjoy it. I know the movie makers weren't looking for aiming for an Academy Award and were just creating a movie that kids might enjoy, but the 4 and 6 year old children I was babysitting while watching this were laughing at the bad acting and cheesy plot lines. The 6 year old actually predicted the ending midway through because it was indeed that predictable.

Overall, I must say I am glad that I rented this movie for free from my library, or I would have been angry. It provided a source of entertainment for myself and the kids, but not in a good way.

Watch it, you might like it. But I seriously doubt it.",1124841600,,905,4.614906832298137
8013776,4,B0001KNHQS,"I first rented this movie thinking it was some serious film reminiscent of Lord of The Rings.  My suspicions turned out to be correct, but not in the way I thought they would be.
The film begins with a scene similar to some PBS style filming.  This cheap filming continues throughout the ENTIRE movie.  This movie is so phony that it's absolutely laughable they they could take themselves serious in making this movie.
I laughed so hard at making fun of the bad acting, poor special effects, poor filming, cheap scenery implements...it goes on and on.  Everything is so cliche, so contrived. The lines are trite, the storyline is trite and the special effects mimic this ""cheesiness"" perfectly.  This movie is so bad it makes it good.
After I finished my 90 minute laugh-a-thon I looked at the special featurse and found previews of White Wolves 1, 2, and 3.  After watching each preview it was obvious they had used many of the same film clips in all three previews.  The storyline was a copy in each one. It was absolutely hilarious that anyone could take this seriously.
An excellent bad film.",1089158400,2,1096,4.677083333333333
8013777,4,B0001KNHQS,"I totally disagree with the previous review. I rented it and my little boy just loved it. He even invented a game called ""The Keeper"" and they keep playing it all day long with his friends. i think this movie is not only entertaining, it teaches kids some valuable lessons about life and love.",1088035200,4,293,4.444444444444445
