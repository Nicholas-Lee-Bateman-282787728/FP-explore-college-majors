7633340,3,B01BEDN0N0,"The actors were good but this movie will not take you to a happy place. It gives you an idea about what the war in the Balkans might have looked like in a superficial way, how the fall of the USSR created career criminals, what the immigration policies of the EU have produced and how the government and corporations have no shortage of crooks. It also shows you how people trying to make better choices in broken systems are emptying the ocean with a tea cup. Don't pick this for a pizza movie night because you will not feel like eating. You will want to go to church and light a candle for these people instead.",1467849600,5,614,4.301724137931035

7633342,5,B01BEDN0N0,"What a rollercoaster ride of a show!  I wasn't certain that I would like this, but I did in the way that one might like epic movies about war or disasters.  I was caught up in the web of the story and intrigued by all the elements involved that kept the energy of the action going relentlessly and intelligently.  The foreign language parts add flavor to this thriller as we follow characters from place to place things are jumbled and confused and complicated, the use of multiple languages signifies a departure from your known world..  Realistic storytelling, as both criminals and those chasing them are portrayed as human beings, not stereotypes, and things go right and wrong indeterminately everyone.  I really enjoyed Samantha Morton's portrayal of Naomi Franckom, the the insurance investigator who is charged by her boss (John Hurt) to recover the stolen diamonds at any cost.  It is dark, and brooding, thrilling and horrific at times, but it is a well told story.  With title song by David Bowie, and a series score by Clark, the whole becomes an experience rather than just a viewing.",1467072000,,1097,4.834224598930481

7633344,5,B01BEDN0N0,"Last Panthers, The, starring Goran Bogdan. As recently shown on Sundance, this 2015 television series is an intellectual intricate crime thriller shot all over Europe, in seven countries and five languages. A daring diamond heist in Marseilles, an ancient city on the Mediterranean in the south of France  seems to resemble those committed by the supposedly retired Pink Panthers, a gang known for their bold daylight raids, movie-style getaways. Unfortunately, the heist, which at first seemed  like the perfect crime, is queered by the accidental death of a little girl in the gangs escape, which makes the gangs efforts to fence the jewels more difficult. These events start a British insurance-loss adjuster (Oscar nominee Samantha Morton, IN AMERICA, JANE EYRE, MINORITY REPORT), a former MI-6 officer (Oscar nominee John Hurt, THE ELEPHANT MAN, TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY), a French-Algerian cop (Tahar Rahim), and a Serbian soldier-turned-thief (Goran Bogdan) on a ricocheting journey across Europe that eventually leads to commerce in  guns, drugs, high finance, and the exposure of high-level government corruption.  The production was written by Jack Thorne, (Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, a new play), inspired by the long tradition of jewel thief crime dramas and the real-life Pink Panthers, who worried Europes jewelers for a decade. As directed by Johan Renck (BREAKING BAD, THE WALKING DEAD), it features the theme music Blackstar, which was, especially for the production, written and performed by David Bowie.

The acting and direction is strong in this complex, character-driven crime caper. And we see bits of Europe not usually on the screen, the least quaint and touristy bits of Eastern Europe in particular.  We revisit Serbia and Bosnia in flashbacks to the bloody wars of the last century. The box set, which I received for review purposes, in return for an honest unbiased review, consists of two discs, containing four episodes, running approximately 307 minutes.  Of course, and thank goodness, it has subtitles, for those of us not up on our Serbian.  There are bonus behind-the scenes featurettes and a photo gallery. Beware, as you might expect, the drama contains violence, strong language, nudity, sexual situations.  Definitely not for the faint of heart or family viewing. But a quick-moving thriller that breaks new ground.",1464220800,5,2364,5.333333333333333
7633345,5,B01BEDN0N0,"The Last Panthers is a fast-paced, but not overly action filmed look at the European crime world from 3 perspectives. 1: A French cop, Khalil (Tahar Rahim); 2: A Brit Insurance Loss Investigator, Naomi (Samantha Morton plays it very well); 3: The crook of organized crime (Pink Panthers), Milan (Goran Bogdan). Also needed included is Naomis boss, Tom, played believably by John Hurt. All 4 have backstory slowly revealed to indicate their character. It starts with a fast daylight diamond heist, and the path of the stolen gems drives all 6 episodes. The scene changes countries frequently in each episode. See Europebut the dark side. Adult viewing.

I intended to dock the rating a full star due to the fact over half the audio dialogue is in French, Serbian, or other languages,
but all has SDH SUBTITLES or CC so English is available via text.
After a couple of episodes, I became accustomed to the different languages and need for subtitles, thus it proved not as distracting after that. So Id only drop to a 4.5, because the 2015 story, and presentation via actors and cinematography is excellent, believable, and compelling.

==Episode 1== A Marseilles diamond theft starts the story of Frances criminal diamond fencing world extending to the Eurozone & many countries. Pink Panthers? The Serbian version of Robin Hood? Based on the real Panthers gang.
==2== Having recovered in London from a near-assassination in Serbia, Naomi travels to Belgium. Milan helps storm a suburb housing estate seeking gun dealers. Meanwhile the 15 million Euro diamonds move on.
==3== Khalils brother goes to crime as Khalil continues to seek gun runners. Naomis team tries to intercept the diamonds.
==4== Milan must warn his brother, targeted to be killed. Tom rejects Naomis claim of the diamond heist/Serbian airport construction link.
==5== Can Milan save brow from Zlatko (Nikola Djuricko)? A 1995 flashback to Bosnia war days showing another merging of paths of Naomi, Tom, & Milan.
==6== Naomi & Milan unite for a cause. Khalil and brother are found in danger form Marseilles gangs. An explosive finale.

8749950,3,B01BEDN0N0,"Wow, not what I was expecting. I thought it would be all about jewel heist (hence the Last [Pink] Panthers title) but it's really about modern-day crime in Serbia, London and Marseille and how it's all connected across Europe. Although this series is short at six episodes it drags until about Episode 4. There are way too many flashbacks. In fact, the episode that is entirely set in the 1995 Balkan Wars made the flashbacks totally unnecessary. It explained the characters' past quite well.

The main Panther, Milan, is super violent when the time comes which totally goes against the grain of the real Pink Panthers who robbed jewelry stores with almost no violence. The British insurance agent woman also I found played the whole thing way too low key. The entire series is filmed in some sort of sepia-washed grey-o-vision. Apparently there are no colors in Europe at all even in the sky. The Marseille part could have been cut completely. Other than the crime occurring there and the gang buying guns in that city, the French cop hunting down the gun runners was almost a McGuffin for the big money involving the proposed Belgrade Airport being funded with dirty Serbian mob money.

Lastly, if the Panthers are this unreal jewel thief ring who have been at it since Tito's Yugoslavia days, why do they not have fences lined up all over Europe to offload the jewels worth 15 million euros. Throughout the Panthers are meeting guys offering them maybe one percent of that at best.

Warning: It is in a multiple of languages (French, Serbian, English...and I'm sure Bulgarian and Croatian are mixed in) so subtitles-a-go-go.

The DVD extras are quite good and all around five minutes each so short and to the point. They include:
World Of Crime - Looks at the real Panthers' jewel heist history
Director's Vision - This is where Swedish director Johan Renck declares ""I don't care about the actors; I only care about the characters."" Yeah, it shows in the casting (see above). He also states ""It's very important for me what it (the scenes) look like..."" which does not explain how grey everything looked.
Executing A Heist - Behind the scenes of filming the heist scene.
Cop, Thief and Insurance Inspector - Interviews with and about the three main characters.
Real Pink Panthers - This is the most fascinating to learn how these Serbian criminals were let loose on Western Europe with the Yugoslav's state cooperation",1519948800,,2422,4.828915662650602
8749951,3,B01BEDN0N0,"Started out OK. Had lots of potential.  Too many story lines. Not enough of tying up plots and characters. Episode 5 was a waste. What flawed character do you root for?  Nothing original about killing off characters at the end of the movie. Better than having them drag on into an Episode 7.

8749959,5,B01BEDN0N0,"Three men pull off an audacious mid-day robbery of a Marseille, France, jewelry store. We're shortly introduced to the three main characters. Milan Celik, one of the robbers. Khalil Rachedi, the French policeman handling the robbery case. And last, but not least, Naomi Franckom, the British insurance adjuster specializing in diamond recovery.

The robbery has the earmarks of the Panthers, a criminal gang once based in Serbia. All members were supposed to be jailed or retired.  But Naomi's boss, Tom Kendle (played with amoral sliminess by John Hurt), tells her that this heist must be the Pink Panthers and she must head to Belgrade to recover the diamonds. She tells him, ""We had a deal. I don't do the Balkan work.""

That does her no good. It takes us a while to find out why she fears Belgrade. It takes us a while to find out where Milan's demons were birthed. And Khalil, just what is making him tick off-beat? I am telling you, at the end of episode 1, I was sitting on the edge of my seat. The final two episodes are riveting. There are a few unnecessary and gratuitous scenes here and there, but overall, this is a fast-paced series.

This is not a series for the kids. It is very violent and the language frequently foul. There is a lot of full-frontal nudity, and not in an artsy way. The show is dark in terms of tone as well as visuals. But it also has the makings of a Greek tragedy (only more interesting, if you've actually watched a Greek tragedy on stage). There is hubris and revenge, justice, power desired, power misused and family mechanics. Atonement, avarice and desperation, the tightrope of being a compromised man. I think it would have been just as good with less violence, but I recommend the show as is.

""The Last Panthers"" is a French production which originally aired in 2015. Its six episodes total 307 minutes of exceptional television entertainment.  The DVD presents the show in 16:9 widescreen and 5.1 Dolby Digital.

People have wondered if there will be a sequel. But writer Jack Thorne, in a March, 2016, ""Digital Spy"" interview, squashed that hope: ""It's a serial that is finished. It's hard to talk about this without giving away massive spoilers, but this was a story about three individuals  two of them end up broken and one of them ends up dead.""

There are some characters who speak English, but this spans several countries and languages. Fortunately, the Region 1 DVD release has English SDH subtitles for the episodes and the Bonus features. The 28 minutes of bonus material are not extensive, but interesting.

Bonus Features:
....1.  ""A World of Crime"" (5 minutes) Commentators include Caroline Benjo (producer), Jerome Pierrat (writer), Jimmy Desmarais (producer) and Jack Thorne (writer). Pierrat talks about the show's underpinnings, ""You, like, an old-time criminality, and on the other side, you have the new face of criminality, one more mixed with our society.... This new criminality is more scary, you know.""
....2.  ""The Director's Vision"" (6 minutes) Hear from Johan Renck (director, from Sweden), Jack Thorne, Goran Bogdan (plays Milan Celik), Samantha Morton (plays Naomi Franckom) and John Hurt (plays Tom Kendle. Filming ""The Last Panthers"" was ""95 days of shooting in four different countries.""

Johan describes Khalil: ""He's quintessentially Don Quixote, because he has no idea of what he goes up against and he's fighting the windmills rather than really understanding what's going on.""
Bogdan's character, Milan Celik, is intense: ""His sorrow, that he's not fitting, that he's always running. It's a very hard part. He never laughs. He does not have time to laugh. He can't remember these good parts of his life.""
....5.  ""The Real Pink Panthers"" (5 minutes) Commentators include Jimmy Desmarais, Jerome Pierrat, John Hurt, Johan Renck, Goran Bogdan, Caroline Benjo and Jack Thorne.

A recommended show.
