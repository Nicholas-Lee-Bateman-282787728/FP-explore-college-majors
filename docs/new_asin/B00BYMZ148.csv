8575632,4,B00BYMZ148,"This fascinating , realistic , gritty and smart film has it all . A great cast , terrific writing , interesting characters and so forth . Young Glenn Ford circa (1950) , about 34 years old at the time , excellently portrays a clean cut fellow fresh out of four years of service in the armed forces . Inebriated at the time of a scuffle , his character strikes another man from a prominent family . As the stricken man falls , he hits his head on an object and soon thereafter perishes . This horrible and regrettable incident/accident leads to the incarceration of Ford's character in a maximum security prison . Prosecuting Attorney Broderick Crawford (superb as often) tries strenuously to keep Glenn Ford's character from doing any prison time but is foiled by Ford's incompetent and inappropriate legal representation . Then the story truly gets under way .
The remainder of Convicted becomes a highly compelling (for me) prison picture in which the reluctant but dedicated District Attorney (Broderick) finds himself the tough but fair new warden at Ford's prison and further stuff ensues . Classic Reel . Hammer + Jazz .",1496707200,,1126,4.809278350515464
