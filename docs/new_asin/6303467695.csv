669122,5,6303467695,"--""The Good Old Bad Old Days"" is an intriguing episode which is based on a challenge given to Carmen that she can't pull off a crime without her technological gadgets for which she is notorius. Fast-paced and exciting, the second episode on this video, ""The Stolen Smile"" is actually the first episode of the entire television show, starting with Ivy and Zack's team being formed. It's funny with some clever jokes and interesting.--Marisa",1002240000,,439,5.027397260273973
669123,5,6303467695,"--""Moondreams"" is a great episode from the first season of this fantastic 1994 TV show - Carmen dreams about being the first woman on the moon and decides to make her dream come true. A fast-paced episode with some great scientific facts. ""Split Up"" is one of the best episodes of the show. When Zack and Ivy, with their respective computer and physically based detective styles decide that they clash too much to be any kind of good team, they break apart and each tries to capture Carmen in her strangest plot yet. This is an exciting, exhilerating episode that shouldn't be missed....",1002240000,,587,4.70873786407767
669124,5,6303467695,"Where on earth is Carmen Sandiego?  Find out as Zack and Ivy travel around Europe searching for certain pieces of masterpieces that Carmen Sandiego has stolen.  She has stolen the eyes from a Van Gogh painting, the nose from a Picasso, and the mouth from the Mona Lisa.  Zack and Ivy then go to the Lascaux Cave in Paris to stop Carmen and restore the different parts of the different paintings.
Then in The Good Old Bad Old Days, Zack and Ivy help an Argentinan cowboy recover the Orient Express train than has just been robbed by Carmen.  At first when Ivy finds a mechanical bird that plays a Spanish cowboy song she thinks Carmen is off to Spain or something when she's really off to a Latin American country.
? Walt Disney Pictures has been announcing a new live-action Carmen Sandiego movie with Jennifer Lopez portraying Carmen, and I hope it becomes reality.  If not, then people will have to sign the petition to help get the TV show back on the air.
These videos rock!  Bring them back, and let's hope there's a video release for Sonic Underground as well.  Back in the mid-90s I hoped for a release of the Super Mario World cartoon on video and there was a release, but not in America unfortunately.  There were two videos of it released in Britain, in PAL standard.",996969600,,1277,4.4978354978354975

669268,4,6303467695,"A little out-dated but educational and interesting.  I didn't care for the emphasis in a couple of the episodes on the teen boy's infatuation with females, but other than that fairly clean.",1268697600,8,189,4.90625
669269,5,6303467695,"I barely remember this series from when I was a kid, but I picked up a VHS of one of the episodes a few years ago and was hooked. I stumbled on this dvd collection and bought it without a second's notice. I have two younger siblings and they immediately loved this series after watching the whole season in one sitting. I'm telling you, Carmen Sandiego's exploits are timeless, and it's this kind of ""suave education,"" if you will :), that really attracts kids. Carmen is such an intensely mysterious character and you really can't help but be torn between which of the characters you cheer for (Carmen or the ACME Kids) in this show.

The animation is exceptional--I always loved that opening sequence. :) You may want to watch out as there are some facts that don't resonate with what is being taught about the world today, such as when the kids are talking about how people in Old England talked like characters in Shakespeare's plays. But for the most part everything is still incredibly informative, and even I learned some things that I didn't know before.

The character development at this point is still beginning, since it is after all only the 1st season, and admittedly the episodes so far are pretty much formulaic. I think this can only be expected, however, since the series creators are crunching education and action along with the storyline into less than 30 minutes. I wiki'd the series and apparently the story does get more intriguing bit by bit as each season progresses.

Which is a nice segue into this question: What happened to the next season on dvd???!! This season came out in 2006 and here we are 3 years later and still no season 2!! What is going on people? I'm serious, if they release season 2, I will buy it without a second's thought. This show is just that good. So really, if the people behind the production of these dvds ever read the reviews, send out the other seasons so all of us CS fans can give you our money!!

In conclusion: I wish they had shows as good as this on tv nowadays. :( But that's why I want all of CS out on dvd!",1251158400,,2073,4.476190476190476
669270,5,6303467695,"My kids love this show (9 and 7).  They have certainly learned new things from it.  It is exciting and has a real kid draw while dishing out the info.  My kids watch the shows over and over and now know all the information given in the shows (places, peoples, definitions) by memory.

I really wish they would release additional series.  I would buy them immediately.",1235779200,2,367,4.5
669271,5,6303467695,"This is a great DVD. You can finally have Carmen Sandiego on DVD!

669272,5,6303467695,My son loves this show and we are working on getting all of the programs for him.  It is a good way for him to learn history and geography without knowing he is learning it.  And the adventures and mysteries keep his attention.,1221523200,,227,4.255813953488372
669273,5,6303467695,"Where on Earth is Carmen Sandiego? is one the best Educational shows of the 90s.  I wish Shout! Factory has plans to release more DVD sets of the series in the future.  Please Shout!, release more Where on Earth is Carmen Sandiego? on DVD!",1214006400,2,239,4.409090909090909
669274,5,6303467695,"Yes, it is true. I have finally found her TV Show. I have been hoping that this series would be released so long ago: So what can I say about this...

 If only the biggest reason possible for watching any video: It is both entertaining and educational. Now when I say educational, I don't just mean there is a few things you can learn. I mean there is lots you WILL learn. Although primarily geared at a younger audiance (which means this is perfect for elementary school classrooms!), there is still much I at my age (early 20's) still will learn from this. After watching the whole series once through recently, I knew I would have to watch it at least twice more to learn most of everything it was offering. As well, it is 'Where In The World Is Carmen Sandiego?', so obviously you will learn about things from all over the globe.

 Of course, if it were just educational, it would be only classroom appropriate and wouldn't have lasted four seasons. The series does have a good action pace, with well placed humour and deffinite kids appeal. There's even a bit of mystery (through Carmen Sandiego's character -of course). It is a very well rounded show.

 Now, the only thing I need to know is... Where in time are the next three seasons coming out on DVD?",1198454400,2,1260,4.4803493449781655
669275,5,6303467695,"Where On Earth Is Carmen Sandiego?, was one of the best cartoon shows back when it aired on tv, educative, thrilling and fun.  I highly recomend this cartoon for children and parents as well.  Is just a fun way to learn.  The dvd box set is really nice too, cant wait for the second season to be released on dvd.",1171238400,2,312,4.166666666666667
669359,5,6303467695,I am a 6th grade Geography teacher and this product has been great in helping my students with Geography.  The episodes are only about 25 minutes each.  The students always look forward to watching! :),1168300800,5,201,4.714285714285714
669360,5,6303467695,"Finally! While this series wasn't perfect, I have to admit that it led to my interest (and college degrees) in Anthropology and International Relations. It won't make your kid a geographic wiz but might pique his/her interest where dusty artifacts and flag memorization won't. As an adult some of the educational facts seem simplistic now, but I still appreciate that they attempted to have people speak in the language of the country visited. It had characters that were intriguing (Carmen especially), and most of the plots were good too. I was a big big fan of the show when I was a teenager, and hope they come out with the other seasons. (Though I noticed some of the worst episodes from Season 4 were already released, leading not surprisingly to at least 1 bad review). Seasons 2 and 3 were, I think, the best, so I hope they get released too.

Note: Some facts may no longer be valid at this point in time, like the names of world leaders who were current at the time. But most of the information has a historic basis.",1161388800,22,1026,4.545945945945946

669362,5,6303467695,"I can't even do this justice with this review but I am absolutely thrilled that the long long wait for this to arrive on DVD is finally over! WOEICS is my favorite animated series of all time, occasionally even better than the X-Men animated series that was popular around the same time as this.

 ACME detectives Ivy and Zack work on cases where they are on a nearly perpetual mission to apprehend and catch the 'uncatchable' criminal thief Carmen Sandiego. Together they must decipher the clues that she leaves behind in order for them to solve and recover stolen items especially of historic landmarks.

 This series is very educational for younger TV goers especially kids and teenagers and yet even for adults like myself as I was just entering adolescence when this series premiered in early 1994.

 Although catering to younger audiences, I am suprised that grandparents have found this to be very entertaining as many older people I know have actually told me that they loved this show. It goes to show how diverse it's fans really are.

 As of writing this review, animated TV series have declined back into banal garbage lacking any good character development and no innovation. WOEICS pushed the limits in animation and stands as a landmark series of the 1990s.

 This DVD is of the first season of the series and is highly recommended for all CS fans out there, wherever they are!",1153612800,21,1392,4.7866108786610875
669363,5,6303467695,"This is a really fun and awesome animated series. The cahracters are absolutely brilliant and very three dimensional in personality.
 In this sadly out-of-print tape, this contains two episodes. One is ""Dinosaur Delerium"" and the other is ""By A Whisker"".
 In the episode ""Dinosaur Delerium"", Carmen gets a hold of a sample of possible dinosaur DNA and steals technology and ACME is called on the case to find out what she is up to. They have no idea of what she is actually planning on doing with the sample!! This episode isn't the best with me but it's still very good.
 In the second episode ""By A Whisker"", Carmen is on the loose once again when she steals two albino cats from a forest preserve and ACME agents Zack and Ivy are on the trail to find out what Carmen's up to next.
 This is another great VHS tape to own just for the fact that it's Carmen Sandieog. If you can find it, BUY IT ASAP!!! They should release this entire series on DVD because it is the best show on Earth!

7849292,5,6303467695,"A true classic cartoon from my childhood, still fun to watch to this day. It really is worth the time and money to rewatch or even watch for the first time. The DVD was a tad lacking in features I thought.  They had story boards to the soundtrack, which was cool but rewatching an entire episode that way which we already saw was a bit much. They had trivia but that was the same ones from the show itself, which was boring. The show itself is well worth the price anyhow.",1425945600,,472,4.186813186813187

7849298,5,6303467695,"Wow, I have this boxed set and it is wonderful. Back in the 90's it was a great way for me to learn lots of things just by watching this show. I love the whole ""Cat and Mouse"" thing with Carmen and the kids Zack and Ivy.  The whole interaction between the three and the characters interaction with the player is great. though at times I must admit I felt like smacking the player in the back of the head. Anyway, this is a great DVD set and worth picking up. True, much of the political info will be out of date but it was true for the time it was produced. Still a great way to learn and have fun. I even had a Professor who thought Carmen was a great character. I wish some how the show could have continued a little longer and have a real grand ending.  But in the end, it was a show that made people happy and it will make you happy too. So go ahead and buy it, Carmen fans, you'll be glad you did.",1334016000,,902,3.9234972677595628
7849299,4,6303467695,"I've played several computer games of the ""Carmen Sandiego"" franchise from when I was seven years old, and this disappointed me in the respect that ACME was portrayed very differently, without any recognizable computer game characters (I missed the ""Good Guides"" and Lynne Thigpen's portrayal of the Chief). But this made up for that for its original characters. The computerized Chief was not interesting to me. I felt he was mainly there for comic relief, which was very mediocre. However, both detectives were likable and relatable characters. They also are very different but work well together, and the relationship they have is also enjoyable, as their role as coworkers conflicts with their relationship as siblings.
I think what really makes this DVD is Carmen herself. In the computer games, particularly ""...Great Chase Through Time"", Carmen was always very one-dimensional who had no other character besides ""smart globe-hopping thief that is against ACME"". In this, it is clear from the start that Carmen is not the stereotypical villain. Her main motive is boredom. She steals because she wants to be chased by the detectives, and hates to be upstaged. Carmen also seems to care about the wellbeing of her detectives, as she does save their lives a few times. When they are up against less moralistic criminals, she does sometimes help them. But analyzation of Carmen's character aside, I'll continue with the episode storylines.
These early storylines portray the conflict in the traditional way and Carmen is more of a protagonist, even though there are a few occasions when the sides help each other. However, this would drive younger viewers crazy until the end, as Carmen's plans are mostly quite elaborate and it is difficult for even teenagers to understand her clues until they get more information.
The main problem I have with this is the aspect of the ""Player"". While their short conversations with Carmen at the beginning and end are enjoyable, the detectives are such good characters in their own right, that the Player doesn't make much sense at all. Also, the animation is very simple, sometimes annoyingly so. Carmen also looks very different to her computerized counterpart. In spite of the coat and hat she still wears, she has black hair, not brown hair, which will confuse players of the computer games.

However, I do advise people to buy this. It has great characters, interesting knowledge, and good storylines. ""Where On Earth Is Carmen Sandiego"" is a worthwhile TV show to watch more than once!",1328572800,,2532,5.071942446043166
