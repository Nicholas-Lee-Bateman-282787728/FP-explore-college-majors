7982404,5,B00008FGAU,"Why would I waste my time to write a review on a 30 year old concert that is on VHS???  The answer simply is because this is Hall & Oates best concert!  While we are talking about VHS I do not know for the life of me why this concert is not on DVD/Blu Ray format.  Just prior to Live Aid, this concert was broadcasted live by HBO on Independence Day July 4th 1985 Hall & Oates performed at Liberty State Park in Jersey City, New Jersey as part of the Liberty Concert where they played an outdoor benefit concert for the restoration of the Statue of Liberty. It was a huge event, drawing an estimated crowd of over 60,000 people at $5 a ticket.  This concert was monumental in Hall & Oates' career. I also have to say that it's this concert that I became a Hall & Oates fan.  The Liberty Concert is edited well and gets no less than 5 stars.  They were at their peak as performers.  Very entertaining band, and you can also see why they are the most successful duo in music history.  This is not the best live vocal performance by Daryl Hall compared to the Rock and Soul Live, or Live At The Apollo, but it's made up by energy, musicianship, entertaining, and soul.  The sun is shining on the huge stage and the band starts out with:

1. ""Dance On Your Knees"" going into ""Out Of Touch"" and right from the get go we are in for a ride.
2.  Family Man-  Here we see how the soul duo were so developed at this point of the career doing a New Wave number.  G.E. Smith(underrated guitarist) is on top of his game doing a great solo.
3.  Rich Girl-  The only 70's original song in their set.  Start out will Hall doing a slow gospel intro on his electric piano.  The band does some good back up vocals, and the breeze through it like the summer wind.
4.  Say It Isn't So-  It starts by having a good view of the twin towers.  A good pop number sped up faster than usual, and it's done so to match the energy that is flowing already.  The sky slightly gets darker as you can see a Goodyear Blimp in the background flying by as Hall's perfect 80's hair is blowing in the wind.  A good sax solo by Charles DeChant, and a good camera pan of the audience.  By now you get to see the massive sea of people chanting.
5.  Some Things Are Better Left Unsaid-  A underrated release from the Big Bam Boom album. A song that is better understood when seen live.  Live it takes a British Rock overtone, while G.E. Smith rocking a fiery solo.
6.  Possession Obsession-  John Oates takes on singing lead without a guitar in his hand, and does a fine vocal performance.  It's the only time in my life I have seen John Oates doing a front man role where he is using the whole stage, and btw does a convincing job.  The song ends with just the band singing accapella.
7.  You've Lost That Loving Feeling-  Best rendition done live.  Reason for that is they take this Phil Spector tune and rock  it at the end of the song.
8.  Method Of Modern Love-  The purple sky by now has darkened and Hall sings the first appropiate lyrics  ""In the moonlight Under startlight""  Again this song is done faster  and bit edgier and it takes a different character life.  Engaging the audience to sing the lyrics, and you get the understanding that the songs of Big Bam Boom was made with a conscious effort of performing live.  This song ends  with Hall doing a nice vocal soliloquy on the electric piano.  Reminiscent of the way ""Wait For Me"" was performed years before.
9.  Man Eater-  A classic.  The band is tight and T Bone is locking on the bass solidly.  Charles Chant does a wonderful sax solo with a nice delay on it.  G.E. Smith does a great overdriven solo.  The band jams this song over 6 minutes.
10.  Adult Education-  This song is 7 minutes long here.  The whole band jams simultaneously in the end.  By now you will realize that this band is on fire.
11.  You Make My Dreams-  You can hear Hall's voice tired, but their is no quitting in him.  They rock this song to a new level.  John Oates dancing all over stage.  Sax Player running while he is playing.  Bass solo on the money, while Hall is doing James Brown Foot work they end the song.  You can clearly see the  sax player out of breath,  and just when you think it is done Hall  all of a sudden goes into this Gospel/Robert Plant vocal riff  solo.  Then the band joins in and ends the song with another bang.  The best live rendition I have seen
12.  Hot Fun In The Summertime-  The band does a cover song , and it's better than Sly & The Family Stone in my humble opinion.  Extra musicians are brought on stage.  Brass section, a keyboardist and a percussion player are joined to bring this song to  a higher level.  The crowds are joining along, and the fireworks are flying off in the the deep dark summer sky.

In conclusion I have to say fairly that there was not one bad performance in the Liberty Concert.  If you want to know why Hall & Oates are legend, then this is the concert to see.  The best concert that I have seen Hall & Oates Band perform. One of the reasons why Hall & Oates was so good at this point of their career is because of the band.  Give credit where credit is due.  G.E. Smith is known as a versatile guitarist virtuso that went on to be a band leader for SNL.  Also playing for other major acts, and the list will be too long to write down.  The bass player Tom ""T- Bone"" Wolk also became part of the SNL band, and a excellent musician that could also play guitar. He played for other artists and went on to be faithful as Daryl Hall's right hand man and became band leader for Hall's solo concerts and for Hall & Oates future gigs.  Charles DeChant Sax playing who was on top his game, but also did keyboard work and percussion.  Mickey  Curry a power house drummer that went on to play for the likes of Bryan Adams, Bowie, tina Turner, and the list goes on.  Hall & Oates had A List musicians at that that time.  Sadly that year is the last we see this line up in studio or live!  Hall & Oates burned a lot of energy on that tour, and they had to take a break for couple of years until the Ooh Yeah! album.  They never captured this energy that you will witness on this Liberty Concert.  If you happen to have a VHS player then God Bless you, because the only reason the VHS player is good for is for you to put on The Liberty Concert.",1415059200,6,6300,4.169717138103161

New York City on a heavenly blue afternoon and into the sparkling evening to welcome back Lady Liberty after her remarkable facelift....imagine tens of thousands of people mingling about freestyle as the Statue of Liberty is reintroduced to the public on a gorgeous July 4,1985...and who better to rock it all in than Hall and Oates singing practically all of their monster hits..and picture this, the finale consisting of Sly and the Family Stone's ""Hot fun in the Summertime"" version by Hall and Oates, the whole city singing along, fireworks, and the lighting of the statue's torch...still sends shivers up my spine..you can practically smell the hotdogs and apple pie...i guarantee you'll quickly appreciate this marvelous concert for its true meaning: Americana at its best...unfortunately it's VHS format only, God only knows where i got this one, but i won't ever give this beauty away..

DVD with 5.1 format would be hot, but I doubt we'll ever see it.  For now VHS will have to do..but rest assured VHS is not bad at all.  In the meantime, pop the video in, flip the burgers and crank it up ! !",1114300800,9,1168,4.682926829268292
