Relations are challenging but Character Enhances all Challenges.
Those two lines above reflect so much of what we experience in relations in our personal lives.
Watch the movies and you will understand why.

Thank you

5890692,4,B00E4WMS78,"Fun for Kung Fu Panda fans, but don't expect any depth of character or involved plots just lots of kick-ass action.",1384905600,2,115,4.523809523809524
5890693,5,B00E4WMS78,"This second collection features more fun adventures of Po, the food loving, belly swishing, unconventional Dragon Warrior from the 2011-13 cable series.

Like the first set, Good Croc- Bad Croc, 7 episodes(of the more than 40 episodes) show off Po and the Furious Five fighting various villains and, at times, at odds with each other, especially, Po and Tigress.  The episodes are about 20 minutes long and include: Scorpion's Sting, Love Stings, Owl Be Back, Monkey in the Middle, Crane on a Wire, Kung Shoes, and Qiln Time.

My family love the Panda movies, and Mick Wingert does a super job replacing Jack Black as Po.  Funny with a simple moral and lots of creative artwork, this is a kicking, punching, kadushing, terrific series.

The added extra is ""World of Dreamworks Animation"".",1382227200,7,788,4.9393939393939394

8601255,5,B00E4WMS78,What can you say Po is always trying not to hurt anyone's feelings and do the right thing at the same time. And that is when things get a little out of control. It is a very funny and enjoyable series. Everybody will like it,1406937600,,224,4.0
8601256,5,B00E4WMS78,"My three year old son loves Kung Fu Panda, so when I saw this dvd on Amazon, I had to purchase it. Though some of the shows are on television, we are usually unable to catch the full episode; I had resorted to recording them, but you can't always trust the channel guide. What's not to like about Po? He's a warm, cuddly panda bear that is loyal to his friends and protecting the Valley of Peace. Those lovable things are also what get him into trouble because he is so naively trusting; furthermore, Po does whatever he can to not train.",1405468800,,538,4.284313725490196
