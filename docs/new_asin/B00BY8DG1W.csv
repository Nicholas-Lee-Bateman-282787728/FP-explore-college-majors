5681805,5,B00BY8DG1W,"It's been a family favorite for a long time. But the fragile nature of VHS makes this DVD the best. Dick Haymes, Vera-Ellen, Cesar Romero, and Celeste Holm at their best!",1386288000,2,170,4.516129032258065
5681806,3,B00BY8DG1W,Not the best Vera Ellen movie but she is such a superb & versatile dancer that she makes it worthwhile - Dick Haymes has a pleasant enough voice - uncomplicated & easy to watch !,1376611200,,178,4.114285714285714
5681807,5,B00BY8DG1W,This is a lovely film with excellent performances from Dick Haymes in his final film for the studio. Vera Ellen dances wonderfully. Celeste Holm is quirky and a joy. Cesar Romero is suave and playful. The music is Latin flavoured and the scenes full of colour and atmosphere. What a treat to have this on DVD in an official release and at a very reasonable price.,1367452800,5,363,4.515151515151516
5681808,4,B00BY8DG1W,"Vera-Ellen, Dick Haymes, Cesar Romero and Celeste Holm star in this
romantic musical comedy filmed in glorious Technicolor.
Fox Archives has done itself proud with this dvd release. The color
is a knock-out!, the sound is great and the condition of the print
used to make the dvd is excellent.

The story takes place during carnival time in Costa Rica where a
pre-arranged wedding between the son of one family and the daughter
of another is about to take place until true love intervenes.
The plot is not important, however, but merely an excuse to feature
some wonderful and exciting Latin dance numbers by Vera-Ellen,
some romantic vocals by Dick Haymes and lots of beautiful scenery.

I want to give a shout-out to Fox for getting this one right.
Keep up the good work! There are no dvd extras.",1367020800,13,798,4.733812949640288

They fiilmed several scenes near my school and I was present to see all. The film is nothing special, but for me it brings a lot of remenberings",1388361600,4,277,3.8771929824561404
