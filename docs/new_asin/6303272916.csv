617740,1,6303272916,"This is a total joke and a piece of trash. From now on, I just hate Rainforests because of this movie. I must hope they are all cut down from now on since this film makes it so boring and stupid too.",1137110400,3,199,3.761904761904762
617741,1,6303272916,"This is the WORST documentary I have ever watched. Anyhow i consider iMAX documentaries sub par to National Geographic and BBC documentaries. Given that leeway, this documentary still sets new standards. New stardards in terms of the worst documentary made.
The narrator sounds like hes overdosed on prozac, there is no theme whatsoever (they take a rainforest, take the first person off the street to narrate, and an IMAX camera: where they spent all their money). I was so severly disappointed. The DVD transfer is nothing spectacular.
Which brings me to my next point: IMAX documentaries are subpar in terms of filming and content and narration to the aforementioned documentaries. They are only popular becuase of the film and projection technuiques of the BIG screen IMAX theatres. Once they are transferred to DVD, the effect is lost and they appear as inferior, B-class documentaries. Stick to some BBC or National geographic documentary.
I think the grass growing in my lawn is more fascinating than this lacklustre piece on a ""rainforest"". Useless.",1036800000,23,1057,5.187134502923977
617742,1,6303272916,"I felt so happy when I was able to return this DVD for a refund. I stopped collecting IMAX DVD's without renting them first after the experience I had with this one.
The things that are bad with this one: 1. Poor Video 2. Lousy narration(worst ever for an IMAX). 3. Not at all interesting",977875200,17,288,4.254545454545455
617743,1,6303272916,"What a waste of money, this film was more of an add to save the rain forest than a documentary.",963792000,6,95,3.8
617744,3,6303272916,"Compared to other IMAX DVDs, the sound quality isn't quite up there with Yellowstone, Antarctica, and others. Nevertheless, the great visuals make up for any real or imagined sound quality. You do feel a bit sorry for the  animals who have been taken from such a lush setting and placed within a  2x3 foot aquarium. And it hurts to see these rainforests chopped down for  the sake of business.
What bothered me most about the video, was its  blatent credit to this wonderful area to evolution. Part of the problem is  that we have a 40 minute video--not near long enough to have a good  discussion on evolution even if the whole DVD was devoted to it--which it  is not. Instead, we get these simplistic answers, such as, evolution did  this, or that, or gave us a conscience, etc. But where did evolution come  from? What caused its existance? How did an impersonal force with no  personality give us a conscience? The movie never tells us, and ""it  just happened."" For the thinking viewer, however, this will lead to  more questions than answers. How can we evolve from one state to a better  one when the rest of life tells us that things tend to break down? Where is  the transitional evidence of evolution in the fossel record? There is none,  but this DVD never touches on this. It just assumes that evolution is true,  and everything just happened. What was its first cause? We aren't told. How  does ""Mother Nature,"" made up of trees, rocks, and other things,  manage to make willful decisions? We aren't told. I don't believe evolution  is true, but just throwing out evolutionary phrases in a 40 minute movie  doesn't do justice to the topic. Despite this, there are some very  beautiful scenes of plant life and animal life.
However, if you are  wondering what IMAX video to buy, if you have to make a choice between this  one and another, I would recommend Yellowstone, Antarctica, Niagara, Super  Speedway,Alaska, or Africa The Serengeti as a starting point. Save this as  a purchase toward the end of your run of IMAX purchases.",953251200,8,2041,4.665730337078652

618012,5,6303272916,"For me the single most affecting sentence spoken [so beautifully by Mr. Holder] is this:  ""What has taken 400,000,000. years to evolve, is destroyed by a chainsaw in 4 minutes.""
Of course there is much beauty and wondrous life of all kinds to learn about.  However,  I have only one complaint, if you can call it that, which is that this documentary is far, far too short.  I realize the expense and time it took to explain the evolution of the rainforests of Africa, Australia, and many other countries included, while not being named specifically as the video proceeds; however,  if you are going to explore the rainforests, then DO IT.
Mind you,  this short video was made in 1992,  twenty years ago.  Now, in 2013 - almost 2014 - how much more of this fragile ecosystem has been destroyed?  Who can know who has not visited there oneself?",1385856000,,842,4.597315436241611

618018,1,6303272916,"I bought this Blu-ray Tropical Rainforest and it was the worse documentary I have ever seen in my life. The whole video last about 20 minutes, the sound was awful. I returned it to Amazon.com and end up to pay for shipping back and restocking fees since I openned the item. It end up costing me 60-70% and I got a refund of about 30% back of my purchased price. Never buy this product unless you are a NO Brainer or want to waste you $$ like me.",1350604800,5,445,4.068181818181818
618019,2,6303272916,"The first 20 minutes or so is some beautiful footage of the rain forest and the narrator has a Jamacian accent which is kinda entertaining. However, after that the rest of the film is just some tree-hugging hippie crap that goes on and on and on and on. Footage of one cut down tree after another. If I wanted to be preached to by a bunch of hippies that don't have a clue to what they're talking about anyway I wouldn't need to pay for it, I'd just go to the Health food store, ask for a paper bag and set it on fire!! They had a great start but should of been better. :( Lameness!!",1335052800,2,583,4.0344827586206895

618021,3,6303272916,"Now come on! This documentary deserves at least a 3 1/2 star rating. It's expensive and rather short like all other IMAX films but at least it tries to send us the message that humans are screwing around with the rainforests.  The point of this film is just that, to remind us of the  extinction of animals and plants due to human greed and stupidity!  When the animals are gone for ever, humans will follow.........WAKE UP!!!!  Save the rainforests!!!!!!",1173139200,,455,4.7215189873417724
