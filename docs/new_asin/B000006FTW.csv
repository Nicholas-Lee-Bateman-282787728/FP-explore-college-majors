7904223,2,B000006FTW,This just episodes from the show put together to make a movie . Do not buy this if you already have the series .,1465171200,,112,3.7083333333333335
7904224,4,B000006FTW,"It has been a long time since I saw the Flash 2 but i still remember it vividly and still enjoy watching it (when it does choose to show on TV). The flash 2 handles intself in a style that 1997's 'Batman & Robin' should have handled itself. It is very bright and cartoonish, yet very dark and urban and doesn't forget its roots, just for the sake of a 'traditional' family audience.
Mark Hamil does well to shake off the Luke Skywalker character as the devilishly delightful Trickster, although he has never been recognised for it. He plays The Trickster with such energy and great psychology.
I still feel that The Flash was one of the best interpretations of a comic book character ever displayed but unfortunantly disappeared before its time. John Wesley Shipp is also fantastic as the subtle Barry Allen, but this time shows his comedy side as he is brainwashed to work with the trickster halfway through the film in the film's most hilarious scene....the courtroom scene.
I will be critical, the film sometimes sloaps off into extra information that is not always needed; i.e: the relationship between Barry and his girl, who is so forgetful that I cannot even remember her name.
Far superior to the first film and the even the third. This is a great achievement for the industry of comic book films, it is only a shame that no one can find a copy for it anymore.
I feel that it could benefit from a resurrection, or even a remake could work. This is a true piece of action and comedy that has always played 56th fiddle to the truel bad comic book films over the years, such as the hulk and the phantom.",1086134400,2,1608,4.510273972602739
7904225,5,B000006FTW,Gleemed from the legendary Flash television show of the 90's. It later was released as a movie in Japan. Top-shelve! I love that red lighting bolt costume. Did you notice that the speedsters in the olympics wore a similiar designed Flash costume?(Minus the  lighting bolt.),976579200,5,273,5.066666666666666
7904226,4,B000006FTW,"The two finest episodes of the series, and much better than the uneven pilot.
It sometimes plays as one big audition on Hamill's part for the Joker (which he was to voice on the excellent ""Batman: the Animated  Series"" a couple years later) but not to the detriment of the  story.
It's too bad that the series went off the air just as it was  finding its (excuse me) legs.
How about pressing these to DVD?",951955200,7,405,4.302631578947368
7904227,4,B000006FTW,"This tape consists of two episodes, one introducing the somewhat demented James Jesse, who goes from con artist to costumed villain in sixty nutty minutes, the other the final and best episode of CBS's short-lived  super-hero series.  Together, you can see the show gaining its footing and  its willingness to combine the grit of the first Batman film with the sense  of fun that the various Flash comics have always had.
Shipp makes a fine  Barry Allen, a man with one foot in a shiny yellow boot and the other in  1956. Hamill reinvents himself here, developing the persona that would  serve him later as the voice of the Joker on the Batman cartoons of the  1990s.  And Joyce Hauser - not listed in the Amazon or IMDB creits - plays  Megan Lockhart, Barry's spunky and tough love interest quite well.
Also  take note of Shirley Walker's superb incidental music, which builds on  Danny Elfman's theme for the show and gives the Trickster a motif of his  own that would later be the basis for Walker's own work with the Joker on  the Bat-cartoon.
It's a shame that the 2nd Trickster episode was the last  of the whole series.  It was getting better with each week and could have  been what Lois and Clark was.",948412800,5,1210,4.553488372093023
7904228,5,B000006FTW,"After watching the video, I had to remind myself that it was Mark Hammill who'd played the Trickster. I can't believe he rarely got acting jobs after the Star Wars movies, because he's so good in this you don't see Luke  Skywalker.  It's the Trickster all the way.  The acting is superb, not just  by him, but Shipp and the rest as well.
  The special effects, as with  all the John Wesley Shipp ""Flash"" episodes, are excellent, and  the story is perfect comic book super-hero fare brought to life.  Well  worth watching.  Anybody know how to get more episodes?",948412800,5,561,4.565656565656566
