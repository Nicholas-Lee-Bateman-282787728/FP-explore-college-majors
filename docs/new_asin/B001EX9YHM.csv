3558059,4,B001EX9YHM,"This was an amusing show but after watching several episodes while still amusing it was
predictable.  Good for a fill in to just relax",1378944000,,134,4.583333333333333

3558061,5,B001EX9YHM,"This DVD was well worth the money. My husband and I had never heard of Hylda Baker. I just came across it on sale at Amazon UK and thought I would give it a try. She is hilarious in this series. Love the other supporting characters as well. Don't know if she played in any other series or not, but plan to check it out. After seeing this I saw an interview with Thora Hurd from ""Last of the Summer Wine"" (one of my favorite actresses). She was talking about Ms. Baker and what a talented comedian she was. I agree. This is one series not found in the USA so make sure you have a region free DVD player and order directly from the UK.",1349222400,3,633,4.031746031746032

3558063,5,B001EX9YHM,"When I purchased this dvd I really did not know anything about the series or any of the actors. I must say it was worth every ""fenny""  The comedy was so refreshing without being dirty. I have enjoyed every minute. I like how Nellie mixes up her words.  lol lol lol lol",1316736000,7,268,4.134615384615385

8299851,3,B001EX9YHM,I think it's supposed to be funny because the lead actress misuses words.  But she does it so much it's a turn-off.  So I turned it off.  It could have been good I think.,1478131200,,170,3.9411764705882355

8299855,3,B001EX9YHM,"If you can get a working copy, it is a good show for retro British comedy fans - but only if you have a taste for the sort of sitcoms from the 70's that were on London Weekend Television.  I had to return and re-order quite a few times as I got discs that either looked okay but froze/skipped/had audio issues, and one that just go the daylights beaten out of it by the delivery service.  It took several tries before I settled on the best of the worst - frankly I got tired of returning the bad copies and settled.",1449273600,,515,4.089108910891089

8299858,5,B001EX9YHM,"Having caught this show totally by accident on Youtube, all i needed to see was a few scenes of this short-lived show to convince me to buy it here, on Amazon.
What is actually more than the first season, it includes season 2, but not the 4 episodes from season 3, which was abandoned after lead character Hylda Baker had injured herself while filming the first episode of season 3.
The show was originally supposed to be a spin-off of a previous show that starred Baker (Nearest And Dearest), but changed a few things here and there in the procss to bring certain aspects of the new show a bit of freshness. It never did catch on for some reason, as I find Baker's occasional 'ticks' with the English language funny, but what one would call this show almost like 'Cheers' in a way. As owner of a pub, Baker encounters different personalities that drop by, some are endearing, some are a little annoying, but adds to the charm of this show nonetheless.
I rated this show highly for 2 reasons. First, for having this available on Region 1, so those in the USA can enjoy a good classic britcom. Second, for making me laugh, think, and enjoy a good show that didn't rely on raunchy humor.",1403395200,,1185,4.465437788018433
8299859,3,B001EX9YHM,Not on your Nellie is truly one of the old TV shows.  The sort I watched years ago.  It is sort of funny for its time period.  The cloths are something to see.  For the price it is fun to watch.,1386720000,,194,3.658536585365854
