The clothes are completely over the top, the lighting is the lighting of film crews discovering they can use all the colors in the world on film now, and there's a villain so loopy and campy that only 60s Britain could produce them.

It also has pretty decent gore effects for what it is. It was Britain in the 60s and while they seem more sophisticated than Americans they were rather squeamish about both violence and sex back then in their films, which they still are in general. The kills are all Psycho influenced but with that added color sheen of red blood and all the colored light gels you can find. It's fun. They certainly don't make movies any where close to like this anymore.

Oh there's a particularly rough looking fall down the stairs stunt towards the end of the movie. So rough, the set shakes. Hopefully, it was a one take.",1460505600,,962,4.368715083798882
8488124,1,B005WU38GG,"The Haunted House of Horror is a boring and dated horror movie from England about a group of ""swinging party goers"" who spend a night in an empty house for fun, only to find that a murder is committed. There are spoilers in this review, but as the film is no classic, I feel like you might as well know what you are going to be in for if you are remotely interested in seeing it.

You could imagine this film building to some kind of sustained suspense as the group arrive and begin exploring the house with candles, but once the murder is committed, the film spirals into all sorts of baffling red herrings and pointless dead ends. The group immediately decide to hush up the murder rather than call the police. Next, they all leave the house without further incident and go back to their lives. So much for the ""horror""! The middle chunk of the film then shows us some very boring police investigations over the missing person, and the friends meet up to discuss what they should do - you're in for a laugh when you hear what they agree on - to go back to the house again and search it from top to bottom. Sounds reasonable enough, except that rather do it in daylight, they deem it necessary to do it in the middle of the night, and also to follow the exact same actions as they did on the night of the murder. WHY?? God knows. But off they troop again, and there is another portion of screen time allotted to creeping about with candles AGAIN, and a really dismal attempt at suspense in a ridiculous ""who-is-holding-the-knife?"" scene with two characters, in a scene which generates absolutely no tension at all. The film even does a double-take of a female character getting her shoe caught in the same staircase twice, adding no real dramatic effect (either time). The story isn't very strong at all. If all the action had taken place on a single night there could have been some tension but having everybody leave and then come back again a month (!) later to ""solve the mystery"" is ludicrous.

The film also doesn't look great. There are many day-for-night shots which look very obvious. The exterior shots of the house look like they are of a different house each time. Character seem to swap having affairs with one character to another for no reason. One of the women has a rich ""sugar daddy"" boyfriend who spies on her throughout the whole thing, again this has nothing to do with the rest of the story. The special effects are terrible, with blood that looks like tomato soup being smeared on the outside of people's skin or clothing to simulate shocking gore. The main entertainment comes from seeing the awful fashions of the period being liberally unleashed across the proceedings, but that alone does not make this movie worth watching! So...no chills, or thrills, and a ridiculous plot.

US shoppers please note the ""Best of British"" DVD release of this movie is a UK format DVD  so it may not play an regular US DVD players. (You're not missing anything)",1455321600,,2972,4.539179104477612

8488127,3,B005WU38GG,".that this ""English rubbish"" would still be entertaining 40 years after the fact? In fact HAUNTED HOUSE OF HORROR (U.S. title: HORROR HOUSE) is more enjoyable now than when I saw it back in 1970 on a double bill with THE CURSE OF THE CRIMSON ALTAR (U.S. title: CRIMSON CULT). Both films were released here by American International Pictures hence the presence of Frankie Avalon. His presence is no longer an issue besides the ending was designed for people who hate Frankie Avalon (I remember my friends and I cheering at the end). Seeing the clothes, hearing the music (and seeing the Frank Zappa poster) took me back to my college days which is probably why I enjoyed it so much this time around. The film is worth it as a time capsule alone. It's also fascinating to see how prophetic the film turned out to be regarding teenage horror pictures.

It's positively amazing how well the movie plays considering everything that was done to it (check out director Michael Armstrong's commentary and read the insert that comes with the DVD). The performances are surprisingly engaging considering much of the dialogue and the lighting & the cinematography are better than they have any right to be. In 1970 I had no idea of the film's tortured history although this wasn't the first nor the last film that producer Louis ""Deke"" Heyward did his best to ruin. In fact this original British version is different and plays a lot better than the one I saw. This was often the case with Tigon films that AIP released stateside. So a tip of the hat to Odeon for this well done Region 2 release (great picture quality and significant extras). It's certainly not the ""Best of British"" but they treat it like it is.",1415318400,,1702,4.6544850498338874
8488128,4,B005WU38GG,"It wasn't the best thing I have ever watched, but it was entertaining.

All of the characters are likeable.

The plot is simple. Bored at a party, a group of young people head to an old abandoned house for a ghost hunt, only to dicover one amongst them is a murderer. Who is it?

The most shocking thing about this film is that it is a bloody horror film with Frankie Avalon! It isn't a gore film, but the murders are bloody.",1394668800,,425,4.158536585365853
