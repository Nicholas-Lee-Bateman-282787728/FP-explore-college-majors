3952879,5,B002MVI3HC,"I stumbled across Season 1 in the bargain bin at a store and bought it for $2. Although the series has never, to my knowledge been shown on Australian TV, it is outstanding, so as soon as I had viewed season 1, I ordered seasons 2 and 3. I highly recommend this brilliant series.",1356220800,,279,4.185185185185185
3952880,5,B002MVI3HC,"The Border comes back for season 2 with a few cast changes and maintains a very high level of action, drama, sexual antics, and political gamesmenship. ""Spooks meets 24"" is how the show describes itself on the back cover of season 2 and I think that's a good analogy. Sofia Milos, (CSI Miami), moves into the background in this season and Grace Park, (Hawaii five-o), comes in as her younger, hungrier replacement. Grace does a good job, but I prefered Sofia as the US Homeland Security Agent assigned to work with ICS on cases affecting both Countries (US & Canada). Season 2 has a lot more sex than season 1 which is fine as long as it doesn't get in the way of the cases/action. In this season Detective Gray Jackson has a lot more going on as he juggles a relationship with Grace Park and saving his deadbeat Dad from bookies who want to kill him. The other ICS Agents are very cool in their own way as we get to know a bit more about them in season 2. This is a really well done, fast moving, spy/cop show that American audiences should like. In season 2 you also get closed captioning which is a plus. Canadians aren't hard to understand--but I often miss what's being said in action shows just cause so much background noise is going on. Sadly, the Border ends after season 3 but you get a lot of entertainment for the 38 episodes it ran and the 3 seasons are a bargain on Amazon.",1330819200,2,1387,4.338461538461538
3952881,5,B002MVI3HC,"Dont be put off by the horrible camera work in the first couple of episodes in series 1 of the series.  This is fixed very fast and from then on it is comparable, and in many cases, better, to most US made submissions. The acting is outstanding, the stories are arresting and the characters intriguing.  The best part is that the actors are ""regular joes"", not the standard Hollywood output of beautiful and very smart women without a hair out of place and male models. But, as with so many good series, it was cancelled after season 3, much to my, and many others, disappointment.  Highly recommended for thinking people.",1281312000,5,622,4.636363636363637
3952882,5,B002MVI3HC,"OK, so yes this is a CBC (Canadian Broadcast Company) series and is to my knowledge not the easiest to find (AKA watch on a regular basis) or even purchase South of the border. However, I am shocked that even on the Canadian and UK Amazon sites that there is nary a review for season 1 or 2. Grace Park and Nazneen Contractor sharing the same frame (who ""out hots who?"") should almost be enough to watch and subsequently generate a few reviews. I am happy to report that the show is so much more than Ms. Park and Ms. Contractor in bed room scenes (though there are a few of those). There is a tag line for the show that reads ""24 meets Spooks"" in deference to the fine US/UK produced series. I generally don't find The Border as complex as either of the aforementioned series. Perhaps in time (I am pleased to report that CBC has approved a season 3) the characters can become layered with greater complexity. I recognize material improvement in season 2 when compared to season 1, which was not too bad in its own right. The writing is sharp and sometimes humorous (I wonder if they added a comedy writer for season 2 to help with the double entendres?). The topics covered range from human trafficking to terrorism (both fundamentalist and eco), immigration, narcotics and general border issues (including an episode where a home on the border of the US/Canada burned down, as a result of the Canadian Border Guard stopping a US fire truck from entering without checking all of the fire fighters passports - apparently there is actually some quid pro quo in general services for some of the smaller border communities). There is also an underlying love/hate relationship with the USA (which caused some criticism [unfounded in my opinion] that the show has anti-American tones), as well as an internal feud with the Canadian version of the CIA.

Perhaps I watched this series (season 2) at an opportune time consistent with that void in the US where the summer series have already wound down and the fall series have not yet started. Also, the simple fact that there is really good TV coming from North of the border with ""Intelligence"" having at least getting a handful of reviews and ""Durham County"" having made it to a somewhat assessable cable channel. So let's call it a 4 1/2 star rating with very high hopes for season 3!",1253577600,15,2331,4.6168674698795185

3952888,5,B002MVI3HC,"With the introduction of the ""Kono"" actress, the fabulous Grace Park, a new level of professionalism was added. Ms. Park shows em how to kick butt and get the job done, while falling for bad boy Graham Abbey's character. James McGowan does a wonderful job as the boss of this elite border response unit and his titillating interactions with Sofia Milos as his American counterpart add interest in the human side of the show. Very much looking forward to season 3!",1395532800,,463,4.728395061728395

3952892,5,B002MVI3HC,"I love this show as anyone would. Nice to see a show that is not only not about the Mexican border but is portrayed from a Canadian point of view. If you have not seen the show it is just so interesting how they see us and the problems they have with their own system of government. They have a sexy woman from Homeland Security from the U.S. that works with them. New idea, new perspectives, and a great cast. You will want all three seasons!",1358294400,,443,4.162790697674419
