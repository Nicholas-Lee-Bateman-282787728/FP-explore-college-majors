8198850,3,B000R4SKEC,"""It's (terrorism) a way of life for them,"" an American woman says at the beginning of Bassam Haddad's documentary, Arabs and Terrorism.  ""They have been in constant combat for so long.""  Though her comment was intended as an indictment rather than a defense, the fact is millions of citizens in the Middle East have lived under conditions of repression, violence, and poverty for decades.  In the face of brutal subjugation, frustration felt by oppressed peoples often evolves into resistance.  When, however, does legitimate resistance cross the line into vicious terrorism?  Is terrorism ever justified?  These are the questions Haddad intends to answer.

Haddad's Arabs and Terrorism, produced in 2007, ""examines the dominant discourse on terrorism in the United States and Europe and offers critics an opportunity to respond.""  By interviewing over 100 international security and diplomacy experts, revealing their responses to each other, and allowing them to further intone upon their commentaries, Haddad purports to illuminate the deeper and broader issues associated with clear communication between the West and the Middle East when it comes to issues associated with terrorism.  Haddad, however, seems unable to escape the omnipresent specter of the Israeli-Arab conflict.

The varied and pronounced issues associated with post-colonial state development and Arab identity in the Middle East are all too often distilled into the Arab-Israeli cycle of repression, resistance, terrorism, and violence.  It is a credit to the caginess of the regional powers that they have managed to manipulate the Palestinian people for so long (and it is an indictment of the Israeli national security apparatus that they cannot help but respond predictably to Arab provocation every single time).  It is worth noting, as Haddad highlights, supporters of the ""Global War on Terror"" in the U.S. frequently have no idea how U.S. policies, especially its defense of Israel, lead to political difficulties, moral inconsistencies, and security problems across the globe.  However, just as Arab regimes manipulate narratives of resistance and Palestinian brotherhood surrounding the conflict in order to keep their own populations distracted, Haddad himself fails to fully extract his narrative from this rhetoric.

Haddad's final hour is the most compelling of the documentary and focuses to a great deal on suicide terrorism.  One would think there would be little defense of suicide terrorism, but Haddad's Arab experts (among them Hezbollah chairman Hassan Nasrallah,  journalist Amira Haas, and Sheik Muhammed Fadlallah of Beirut) argue suicide attacks are legitimate as long as resistance is legitimate.  Nasrallah compares suicide bombers in Israel to Russians who conducted attacks against Nazis during World War II though they knew they would die; Haas states that every Palestinian has ""fifty reasons"" to conduct suicide attacks.  Many of these arguments are incomplete and illogical and rely not just on ""strawmen"" but also in some cases ""red-herrings.""  Counter-arguments in defense of the Western perspective are all too often defensive, shrill, and reactive.  The hardest questions, for each side, remain unasked.
Furthermore, Haddad's choice of experts is odd--while representatives of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO), Hamas, and Hezbollah provide comprehensive arguments, individuals like Clifford May, Edward Walker, and Jonathan Schanzer, as well as Haddad's European commentators, come off, at least in front of Haddad's camera, as less articulate and more beholden to ideological rhetoric--and seem to earn less screen-time.

Ultimately, Haddad's documentary is valuable as a commentary on the confusion and exclusion that terminology like ""terrorism"" creates.  In the end, Haddad has no answers, or even definitions.  This, sadly enough, puts him on even footing with our ""experts.""",1329091200,,3905,5.671821305841925
8198851,2,B000R4SKEC,"First the author does do a good job of explaining opinions and viewpoints on both sides.  Both Western nations and Muslims see the other side as the aggressor and debates which side is the freedom fighter or terrorist.  However where the film loses credibility is when the filmaker interviews Hamas and Hezbollah spokesmen.  The filmaker never really challenges them on their previous statements and actions but allows them to Bill Clinton like use semantics to argue such things as resistance vs terror.  In addition while attempting to paint the likes of Donald Rumsfeld and George Bush as extremists, the filmaker ignores the other quotes and speeches by the likes of Hassan Al Banna, Sayyid Qutb, and Bin Laden.  It is almost like the filmaker was attempting to argue, ""What terrorist threat?""",1310947200,,797,5.0534351145038165
8198852,1,B000R4SKEC,"Nauseating and obvious in its bias. In the product description it sums it up perfectly: ""Haddad strives to open a dialogue between neoconservatives in Washington, DC and the so-called Arab ""terrorists"" they obsess about."" That's a good way to open a dialogue, isn't it? I love the ""so-called"" in that sentence.

8198853,5,B000R4SKEC,"This film was created by a very interesting effort of the director to travel back and forth from the U.S., Israel and the Middle East to bring people with quite divergent views together in a virtual face-to-face.
Technology can be a magical thing.
The director would interview someone like Daniel Pipes, and then load it into his lap top and play it for a figure like Tariq Ali, or a spokesperson for Hezbollah.  Dozens and dozens of scholars, poltical figures and authors were involved in this dialogue.  A dialogue that is much needed to cultivate understanding of terror, including state terror.  There's an interesting segment about the origins of the word ""terrorism,"" and how it originally implied the use of force by governments.  It is easy to understand why various state powers would want that definition to be buried in favor of focusing on the violence done by people without an air force, a navy, cruise missiles, cluster bombs and the like.
