7826913,5,6302499879,I loved this movie and I really wish it would come out on DVD. Jonathan Silverman is great. So is his roomate George Newbern. Great college movie. Alyssa Milano is hot...Maybe one day!,1379116800,,184,4.606060606060606
7826914,5,6302499879,"I bought this VHS tape so I can copy it over to a DVD. The quality isn't so great... kinda grainy like you would expect from a VHS tape, but it's better than nothing.",1353110400,,166,3.911764705882353
7826915,5,6302499879,"I liked this one, because it made you try to understand from a different perspective point. You know, walk a mile in someone else's shoes for a while thing! Plus, Alyssa Milano had just finished wrapping up with her TV show ""Who's The Boss?"" during or about that year.",1236211200,,268,4.489795918367347
7826916,5,6302499879,"This is a little known movie of Alyssa Milano's but I

like this movie a lot.  Alyssa in her younger days.  Not on DVD.

I'm a buyer of it if it was.  If you are a Alyssa fan, you

want this movie.",1121990400,,197,3.5714285714285716
