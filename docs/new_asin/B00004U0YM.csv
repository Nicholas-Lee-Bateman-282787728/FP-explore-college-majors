7923431,5,B00004U0YM,"This is a story that is more about a lust for power than it is about racism, grand political strategy, a tragedy of an attempted assassination or a popular political figure. George Wallace began his political career as a liberal judge, as one black lawyer mentions, Wallace was the first governmental authority to ever address him formally by leading with Mister. When he first ran for governor of Alabama, Wallace stated quite clearly, ""If I am not capable of treating all men the same, regardless of color, then I should not be governor.""  He was soundly defeated, so making a very Faustian bargain, vowed to never be ""out-ni**erred again.""
 Wallace completely changed his tactics, adopting racist rhetoric and policies that led to horrifying events that were covered live and shocked the nation. I watched those events on television, and even some of the people I knew that had no time for black people objected to what was happening. Quite ironically, his hardline segregationist policies served to hasten the demise of segregation in the south. According to some of his confidants, Wallace privately expressed personal regrets over the brutality committed by his state troopers.
 Over the years, he toned down his rhetoric, arguing more against big government and for the rights of states rather than pushing the race button. Nevertheless, it was always present, sometimes only thinly painted over. From his speeches of the late sixties, you still see the racist firebrand and it is hard to believe that he stood a good chance of winning the Democratic nomination in 1972, until he was gunned down. Of course, everyone knew that Nixon would be re-elected, so a vote for Wallace was not one that would have to be lived with later. Nixon would have crushed Wallace just like he did McGovern.
 Nixon and his disgusting band of cronies appear in the life of Wallace in one of the most disgraceful political plans ever devised. Within hours of learning that Wallace had been shot, Nixon and his group were plotting to plant McGovern campaign material in the apartment of the shooter in an attempt to discredit the McGovern campaign.  It makes modern political mudslinging look like a perfume fight.
 To his credit, later in life Wallace began calling his old enemies and asking for forgiveness, and started courting the black vote. Of course, he could not have regained the governor's chair without a significant number of black votes, so that could also have been a political ploy. Furthermore, one wonders if he would have felt the need if he hadn't been paralyzed from the waist down.
 George Wallace is one of the most frightening political figures of this century, but also the easiest to understand. All he wanted was political power and he would do anything to achieve it. I was mesmerized as I watched this biography, as he transformed himself from a decent man to a racist brute and finally back to a man who appeared decent. All in the name of political power of course. It is not possible to understand the civil rights movement without understanding men like Wallace as he was in the sixties. However, it is also not possible to understand the southern states as they are today without knowing how men like Wallace underwent the transformation from men who preached segregation to those who openly courted the support of blacks.
 This is one of those tapes that shows you as much about the country and how it has changed than it does about the person being described. I strongly recommend it to everyone, as it shows why there had to be a civil rights movement and why the federal government had to trump the ""rights"" of some states in pursuit of a greater right of decency.",1072137600,4,3686,4.839682539682539
