I have no problem with a foreign film.
I have no problem with subtitles.

What I have a problem with is making these movies seem like English when they're not!  Fortunately I speak spanish.  But don't say English Subtitles if there are none!",1480550400,,250,4.613636363636363

7689111,2,B01CRIWSBG,"An art film that borders fairy tale or fantasy. Frankly, I thought it was a stupid film. I did not have to pay to view it since I am a Prime Member otherwise I would have felt it to be a total waste of money. I gave it a two because they did try to create a good film. It just missed it's mark.",1476748800,,294,3.609375
7689112,2,B01CRIWSBG,"I watched this Chilean film in Spanish with English subtitles. The film starts out with two teens, preteens (?) Reuben and Lenora in the woods. Leonora runs off, Reuben follows and is stopped by an ominous figure. Years later adult Reuben (Iigo Urrutia) hooks up with married woman Laura (Catherine Mazoyer) in a cabin near the same woods. They were old lovers who had drifted apart. Laura married Francisco and has two daughters.

Reuben tells Laura a creepy story involving a local persecuted sect who died in a fire. Laura tells Reuben she is pregnant with his child. Weird things happen outside the cabin...

I thought the film had an interesting plot and ending. There was zero character introduction and whatever the incident was in the past was told to us in two lines. A visual would have been nice. I felt the production crawled too much. It took me half the film to figure out Laura wasn't the lost Leonora.

8754018,1,B01CRIWSBG,I always look for good Spanish movies (which are a rare find on Amazon) and at first I found it interesting. The movie is drawn out and overall boring.,1499904000,,151,4.241379310344827
8754019,1,B01CRIWSBG,"PEEEEEEEEEEE-YOU. Young couple, who previously frolicked in the woods as children before being rudely interrupted by perfectly normal people wearing rabbit pelts, return as adults, hang out at a cabin for awhile before being rudely interrupted by those very same normal people wearing rabbit pelts -- some are wearing faux fur throws and beach towels this time, before the movie grinds to a non-ending. Right down there with the lowliest shot-on-cell-phones American horror flick, this Spanish feature recalls countryman Jesus Franco's efforts. One flash of breasts, no violence and no point -- read a book instead!",1499644800,2,615,5.416666666666667

8754021,1,B01CRIWSBG,"Not English. Not watching. This movie is in Spanish with not even any subtitles. How hard is it to dub (to change the sounds and speech on a film) to a different language? Preferably English, because that's the majority of us on Amazon I'd guess as everyone's reviews are in English. What a disappointment to potential viewers to not make that effort.",1497398400,,351,4.67741935483871

8754026,3,B01CRIWSBG,"The movie dragged a bit until the middle, the dialogue could have used some punching up and there was a little confusion as to the story, but overall I enjoyed the tension and the atmosphere .  Would likely recommend it to my friends who like some suspense but not scary movies.  *Some reviews state that there were no English subtitles but once I clicked the caption box, mine worked fine.",1481328000,,390,4.557142857142857
