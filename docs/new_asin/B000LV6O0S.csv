This dvd includes special features, bully boogie short, and interviews with voice actors. This will be a rare dvd in a couple, or a few 2 years. I highly recommend you guys purchase it before it goes out of sale and goes around 45 dollars-125 dollars.",1407628800,2,362,4.338235294117647

2714489,5,B000LV6O0S,"In this movie, Grim has lost his position in the underworld (which has been given to numbuh 3 of the Kids Next Door). Afterwards, Grim and Boogey race through a series of obstacles to get an item known as ""Horrors Hand"". Grim intends to use it to get his job back and Boogey wants to use it to become the scariest being ever. Throughout the movie, it is a typical Billy and Mandy adventure. Billy and Mandy work with Grim. Irwin tags along trying to win Mandy's heart. Fred Fredburger runs around doing whatever makes him happy.",1378857600,2,528,4.453608247422681

2714491,5,B000LV6O0S,"My husband and I are both fans of the Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy and wish they would release more.  Sadly this movie and season 1 of the show are all we can find.  The movie is a lot of fun.  It has a lot of cameos from past episodes like Fred Fred Burger and Dracula and Irwin, some of my favorite characters.  If you're a fan of the show or just like off the wall humor you'll like this movie.",1354579200,,401,3.8536585365853657

2714493,5,B000LV6O0S,"I am amazed at the anger in the negative comments towards those that enjoy this movie, so I must say, first, that this is only my opinion and not meant to be taken as gospel truth.

I really enjoyed this movie as the sick and twisted humor is very much like my own.  When I first saw it on TV, I had only experienced a few episodes of the show, but I enjoyed them as well.  Indeed, this movie only made me want to watch more of the show, and I received Season One for Christmas a couple years ago.

If you are a Billy and Mandy fan, I would recommend this, but do not expect it to be exactly like the show.  Being a feature length movie it goes even more in depth than the shorts do, and is actually quite satisfying if you are in to that sort of humor.  You get to see more of the Underworld as per Maxwell Atom's vision of it, and you get to see more of Grim's acquaintances and friends than ever before.  Also, you get to see Billy and Mandy's ""friendship"" with Grim evolve and grow.

Over all I give it five stars, because I'm weird that way.  And I find it amazingly entertaining.",1250640000,10,1085,4.056338028169014
2714494,5,B000LV6O0S,I really like this movie. Just like the tv show with a few twists. Like who the Boogy Man has to replace Grim. LOL.I think all the cast is great and I really enjoyed the extra of talking with the voice cast. I wish it would of been longer to aslo include other cast memebers. All in ALl a great movie for Billy and Mandy fans as for others that have twisted sense of humor. Pie Pie Pie!!!! Heheh HEeheh,1219276800,3,402,4.0375
2714495,5,B000LV6O0S,"This could've totally gone theatrical. It is too good to be a TV movie. To put it simply, this movie is hilarious for pretty much the whole 80-or-so minute run. Any fan of Billy and Mandy will love it, anyone who only watches the show occasionally will love it, and anyone who has never seen the show will probably love it as well(my grandma did).
The only Billy and Mandy episode that can possibly compare with this is the episode where they try to get Mandy to smile, which is simply genius. A couple months ago, another TV-movie was made, Wrath of the Spider Queen. It was great, but definitely not as great as this.
This is the ultimate Billy and Mandy experience. any fan who hasn't seen this, go out and buy this DVD.",1189382400,5,723,4.362962962962963
2714496,5,B000LV6O0S,"In the anals of true cartoonish entertainment, they will never admit that Billy & Mandy are the best since Ren & Stimpy. Enough said, YO.",1186963200,4,137,4.52
2714497,5,B000LV6O0S,My kids love The Grim Adventures of billy and Mandy and my son couldn't wait to get the movie for his birthday.  They are very happy with it and have watched it several times.,1181088000,3,175,4.147058823529412
2714498,5,B000LV6O0S,"The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy:

My favorite cartoon on the air today.

I recently watched and recorded Billy and Mandy's Big Boogy Adventure and I was very pleased with the movie and I am a huge fan of the series ever since it was originally ""Grim and Evil"". The Evil Con Carne half of the show was never up to par with Billy and Mandy and it was no surprise that in 2003 Billy and Mandy got their own show. And now that the first movie has been made it is no surprise that it is a treat to watch and is as funny and wacky as ever.

All the plot elements are here. Billy is as stupid as ever and saves the day with his outrageous gross beheivor. Mandy and Erwin duke it out in their little love story and the Boogy Man becomes the central villian while Grim as always is the victim stripped of his powers/dignity/ and honor only to be restored by the likes of Billy and Mandy.

The only things that are missing from this adventure are certain characters and villians from previous episodes. These characters are:

Aris- Goddess of Chaos- The funiest villian in my opinion.

Jack-O-Lantern(hope that's right)- From the Halloween episode.

Haus Del Gado- The fan fav.

Principal Good-Vibes- Not really a villian but a likeable character.

Malaria- Grim's Love interest from a previous episode.

Puddin- One of my favorites.

Blandy- The female version of Mandy.

Harial- The Mermaid copy of Ariel from the Little Mermaid.

Just to name a few of my favorite characters that didn't make it in the movie but it's understandable because of the run-time. You can't put every character in the movie.

With all this said it's a good buy with this dvd because there is still no box set of an entire season or anything besides Cartoon Network Haloween which is a very short dvd. This is the first all-out movie starring Bily and Mandy and should not be missed.",1176768000,6,1858,4.491071428571429
2714499,4,B000LV6O0S,"This full-length movie happens to be that Billy and Mandy special I aformentioned in my reviews for the videogame.

In this movie, the Grim Reaper, now powerless, has him, Billy, Mandy, and Irwin on a quest to find the mystic artifact, the Hand of Horror, before his high school rival the Boogeyman gets to it first.  Beware of monstrous pirates, high-speed chases, creepy cyclopses, crude puppets, cyborg doppelgangers, tons of snot, a ferocious kracken, and a couple of good songs, too.  You'll also note that some of the costumes and other stuff in this movie were big inspirations to the videogame.

Special features on this DVD include a full-screen and a wide-screen format of the movie.  Plus, behind-the-scenes interviews with the voice actors of the movie and a bonus cartoon: ""Bully Boogie"", featuring the Boogeyman's first apperance.

Get this movie if you're a fan of the ""Grim Adventures"" TV series, and also available, the Billy and Mandy videogame for your favorite game console including the new Wii system.",1175817600,3,1023,5.059523809523809
