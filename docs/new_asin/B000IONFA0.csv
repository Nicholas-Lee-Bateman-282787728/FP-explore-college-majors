8147039,5,B000IONFA0,My parents I loved the many new facts and stories we learned about the story of the Nativity. I sparked many hours of conversation on aspects we did not know.,1395532800,,158,4.3
8147040,1,B000IONFA0,"This ""documentary"" is way too full of myths, pseudepigrapha texts and unbiblical doctrines.  The superstitions on putting faith in ""the holy family"" (i.e. Joseph, Mary and the baby Jesus) outside of God only is just too painful to watch and even listen to for over an hour.  Stories like a solider whose life is saved when a bullet hits him but gets stuck in a Bible that he had on his person, and then, instead of thanking the LORD for saving him, the solider puts his faith in the ""spirit of the holy family"" is just too excruciating to digest.  Why doesn't the host place a great deal of emphasis that the stories mentioned outside of the Bible and outside of actual authenticated historic facts are erroneous?  The video attempts to sway the viewer in believing stories like of Maria's breast milk falling to the ground was preserved and is used today for healing barren woman when they drink it mixed with ""holy"" water.  And when Mary washes the baby Jesus' clothing in some water, that was taken to a young girl who was sick with a skin condition was healed when they poured the water on her.  Are you serious?!?  The only reason I finished watching this ""documentary"" was because I paid for it.  I'm not discounting the fact that there is actual evidence discovered outside of the Bible that proves the Gospels Account, such as numerous archaeological discoveries, documents written by first and second century historians and the fact that Jesus is still saving and blowing the human intellect with miraculous events taking place in believers lives and creating ample testimonies across the globe.  However, I just can't stomach fabrications that are designed to create tourist attraction and/or simply made to ""help"" the validity of the already Divine Scriptures.  In this video, you see people praying to statues of ""the holy mother"" and touching and placing notes or letters on pictures on what they believe to be Mary for good fortune.  This is simply idolatry and its man's attempt of finding other means of blessing apart from placing solid faith in Jesus only.  This whole worship of Mary is just too out of hand.  This brings to mind Luke 11:27-28
 27And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked.  28But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.
Why does it seem that Jesus is correcting/rebuking this lady for trying to praise His earthly mother?  Is it because Jesus for knew that people would try to make a deity out of Mary and worship her instead of The Father through Jesus?  Man is saved by faith in Christ's atoning grace that is a gift of God.  In all, I didn't gain any insight from this ""documentary"" other than angina watching it.  The video quality was also too dark for some reason, at times the viewer couldn't hardly see the faces of people and backgrounds.  And the sound sometimes would be too loud in some parts, and then too low in others.  This whole video makes me think that this video was made for Catholics or people who worship everything else besides (or along with) Jesus.  Jesus, in which there is no other name whereby people can be saved.  I only gave this one star because it was required to just so I could place review, if I could, I would give this NO STARS.  A better documentary (although not that great either) is Zondervan's ""The True Christmas Story: Herod The Great, Jesus The King"" hosted by historian Ray Vander Laan.",1323388800,3,3556,4.616852146263911

8147042,5,B000IONFA0,This is a well-researched and intereting presentation on the astrological explanation of the Bethlehem Star. Great for pre-Christmas viewing.,1266883200,,141,6.473684210526316
8147043,5,B000IONFA0,"This DVD arrived very timely and in excellent condition.  It was well-narrated by Roger Moore, depicting with realism the hardships endured during the trek made by the first family that night.

Kudos.",1265328000,,200,5.21875
8147044,3,B000IONFA0,"While the movie was Ok in that it contained a somewhat accurate account of the events (with some possible assumptions) but the picture did't seem to have the wonder & passion that the subject of Christ's birth should contain.  I prefer the ""The Nativity Story"" even though it was not as historically sound (i.e. wise men's arrival at the cave/stable).  However, the wonder of God's sending Jesus to be our promised savior was moving and passionate.
