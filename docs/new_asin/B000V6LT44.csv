2931122,3,B000V6LT44,"Rollin's second vampire film is an example of technique over plot.  Not up to par with some of his other work, it remains a must see for some of the startling images that occur within its running time.  I originally saw this film in a heavily edited washed out print, Redemption has triumphed once again with a nice looking transfer. A perfect segue to his much better 'SHIVER OF THE VAMPIRES'.",1274659200,10,394,4.535211267605634
2931123,2,B000V6LT44,"...which are: The subject matter would usually lend for a visual feast. However Jean Rollin manages to be an ultimate bore when it comes down to the cinematography in this production. When we all know from ""Rape of the Vampire"" and ""Fascination"" that compelling visuals can be his strength. The lighting is flat, compositions plain.

The editing is sloooooow. Do we really need to see a guy walk across a field until he disappears into the horizon? In an end sequence maybe, however not in the middle of a story that already tends to induce sleep.

My favorite: the girl that shoots herself in front of an audience. No gun smoke, no jerky body movement, no blood.
The acting is as usual questionable however this is most likely not a priority when watching a Rollin film. The majority of costumes look homemade. Or completely pretentious.

Bummer.",1201996800,15,847,4.787671232876712

We thought our expectations were suitably low and we would be able to get some laughs out of it, but...wow...terrible... just...terrible. According to my boyfriend: not even the nudity can salvage this into being watchable.
Furthermore, we turned it off at a point where there was a black actress doing some kind of dance/tease kind of thing; the look on that poor girl's face kinda freaked us out. We're pretty sure she was supposed to be going for sexy but she actually looked a bit nervous and scared, like maybe the filmmakers were taking advantage of her. I know that seems like a stretch, but the rest of the movie was odd enough that it didn't seem out of the realm of possibility.

2931227,1,B000V6LT44,"I don't use superlatives too often, but this was the worst movie I have ever seen.  Oh, it was bad.  And not in the it-was-so-bad-it-was-good way, either.

It is not about vampires.  I have no idea what the hell it was about, but it wasn't about those.  As for nudity, that just means not-so-attractive women remove their tops in situations where there's no apparent reason for them to do so.  But even for those obsessed with boobs, I'm afraid the unremittingly boring nature of the film will cause them to lose consciousness and miss the breast shots anyway.

My attention span is good, but after the first unending half hour of cringe-worthy dialogue (when there was any), and painfully bad acting (come on, an actress does a scene where she shoots herself in the head and doesn't even bother to twitch her head to the side, but gracefully faints instead?), and complete lack of sense, plot, beauty, eroticism or anything, I ended up putting the player on fast-forward.  Even then, the extended scenes of people walking went on and on... and on.  There were many of such scenes. People walking.  I suppose it was meant to be artistic.  It failed. I'd like to say that the sheer bad-ness of this film made it funny.  Sadly, it's not so.  I only got one laugh, brought on, no doubt, by boredom-induced derision.  This from a scene where a woman tumbled down a set of stairs, supposedly unconscious, but managed to slowwwwly tumble down each step, obviously bracing and positioning and turning herself throughout the slowwww descent until she hit the bottom.  Finally, she decided to let her head slowwwwly thunk to the floor and it made a sound just like a coconut.  Perfect!

Other than that, the most fun I got from this movie was writing this review.",1389312000,6,1754,4.6797385620915035

2931232,3,B000V6LT44,"French with subtitles, not really a vampire movie. Nudity, yes- it appeared that there was some attempt at making the nudity artful, but the extreme closeup of boobs and erect nipples kind of shot that down, as well as the poor (and really odd) attempt at making some of it appear erotic. Don't think that it is chock full of nudity, though, regardless of what I have written so far. In any case, it IS an interesting take on the subject of evolution, and although the characters seems very lackluster in many places, it is not a terrible story, and if you have some time to kill, watch it.

He is also told that his father is just trying to help a woman w/ a strange blood condition. Pierre gives dad 48 hours to explain his involvement in this insane situation. THE NUDE VAMPIRE is rather absurdist, loaded w/ odd characters, crazy costumes, unexplained events, and an atmosphere of lunacy. The story makes sense if viewed through its own lens. Jean Rollin has created a secret underworld, a dream-like universe where mysteries abound, and rationality takes a seat in third class.

2931243,4,B000V6LT44,"This year, I discovered the films of Jean Rollin and have generally enjoyed them.  I was a bit reluctant about The Nude Vampire as the reviews on Amazon ran from mixed to negative.  Still, I was able to find my copy at a good price and decided to give it a chance.  I'm glad I did.  I would not recommend this film to someone new to Rollin; such a viewer would be going ""what the heck is this supposed to be?""  It is an early effort, the story does have gaps of logic, and yet there is something charming about it.  It starts with a young woman undergoing experimentation by hooded scientists.  She makes an escape, is pursued by people in bizarre animal masks, and meets a young man.  Both are obviously smitten with each other.  The young man gets away when the woman is captured and he soon learns that she is somehow connected to an outfit run by his father. He sneaks into one of their meetings and finds the object of his affection.  However, she seems to be a vampire.  Father finally tells him the woman has a condition that grants immortality and he wants the secret.  Father is aided by twin nymphets and a ruthless hit woman as well as two financial backers.  They all make their way to a chateau where there is a fellow who has an agenda of his own concerning the young woman.  The ending is interesting; without giving much away, I think it may be the only Rollin film I've seen that has a happy ending instead of the usual bittersweet or sad one.  Yes, it could be confusing trying to figure out what's going on, but I like the ambiguity of Rollin's films.  The young lady has a sweetness that would cause most people to toss away their wooden stakes.  Jean Rollin films are noted for their spectacular locations and this one succeeds on that count (on the subject of location spotting, Rollin, or whoever did that work for him, was one of the best in movie making).  As noted above, people who have developed an appreciation for the atmosphere of Rollin will be best able to enjoy The Nude Vampire.  For developing such an appreciation, I might suggest my own starting points Fascination and The Iron Rose.  If you like offbeat horror, Jean Rollin is worth your while.",1355875200,19,2183,4.423558897243108

A son takes an interest in his father's experiments on a woman in a see-thru garment who feeds on blood and can not be out in the sun. She has that immortality thing which he wants. The killing scenes were rather campy, especially the candlestick which killed two people while being waved through the air. The roll down the stairs scene lasted long enough to make me laugh. The shot to the head was also a laugh. The movie didn't have that great of a plot. Gratuitous nudity, but I expected more from the title character.",1501200000,,630,4.584070796460177

8216794,4,B000V6LT44,I am a big Rollin fan so I have of course enjoyed it. The movie is rather dreamlike and surreal when it begins and it goes that course throughout the majority of the movie. The plot is not explained very well at all and is very thin at best however the visuals and the surreal mood are enough for me to rate it four stars and an enjoyable experience.,1460160000,2,350,4.086956521739131
8216795,5,B000V6LT44,"Many years ago, Channel 83 set out to collect the films of great French director Jean Rollin on DVD, all of which were out of print at the time. There were a few titles that were unavailable for the US market at the time, The Nude Vampire being one of them. I had been hearing about this movie since I was 7 years old, with such a title wasn't hard to remember, and finally got to see it on Amazon Prime, which also has nearly all of Jean Rollin's other movies. This movie is definitely one of Rollin's most psychedelic, with fantastic costumes and lighting and plain old weirdie dressing. May be even more LSD drenched than Shiver of the Vampires, another Rolling made soon after. Definitely some subterranean fun to be had tonight on Amazon Prime!",1456185600,3,749,4.474452554744525
