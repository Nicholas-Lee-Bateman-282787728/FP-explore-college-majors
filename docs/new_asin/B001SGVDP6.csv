8339840,3,B001SGVDP6,"Stated like this the headline looks like a putdown of the era.
It's always interesting to look back and be reminded of
favorite moments from ten years past.  This DVD did that for me.",1390176000,,183,4.382352941176471
8339841,5,B001SGVDP6,"This is one in a series of DVDs about Musicals from Hollywood, all of which are very well done.  Shirley Jones narrates, with stars from many of the movies adding their comments to the movies.  Musicals were changing due to the culture and exposure to MTV.  Some of the movies discussed are Cabaret, Hair, Tommy, Rocky Horror Picture Show, Saturday Night Fever, That's Entertainment, Grease, All That Jazz, New York-New York, and more.  I loved being reminded of old favorites and found some I had forgotten about, to add to my DVD collection.  If you like musicals and music from the 70's you will love this DVD!",1256342400,10,613,4.691588785046729
8339842,5,B001SGVDP6,These are terrific series of docos of which the original was just a cut down version of the longer more extended versions with terrific interviews. I am surprised more people don't seem to be aware of them or interested in writing about them.,1246924800,5,242,4.651162790697675
