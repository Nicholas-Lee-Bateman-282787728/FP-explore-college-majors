8587063,2,B00CX0A4G0,"I bought this for around $215 total. I thought I would be getting a lot more than what I ended up getting. The box itself is flimsy thin cardboard. Similar to the ones used in Aniplex's NA release of the LE's of Kill la Kill. The show is in 3 blu-ray discs with the 4th being the soundtrack. The soundtrack itself is just 2 tracks, one is around 50 minutes long with the entire remixed soundtrack all squished in one track and the 2nd track is a remix of Fly Away. Also included is a little booklet that doesn't matter. Unless you're a die hard fan and have money to burn, I'd say just get any of the NA releases. They're obviously cheaper and have both the Japanese and english dub and you also have the benefit of not randomly pushing buttons on the menus. It's just not worth it for the soundtrack and booklet. I mean, if you really wanted the soundtrack, the songs are easily available online. Another warning, unless you can read Japanese, don't get this. All the menus are in Japanese (Obviously being from Japan). So this doesn't really do you any good if you shell out $200 only to then get stuck on the damn menus. This release is catered toward the domestic marketplace, i.e. the Japanese. even though the inclusion of english subtitles, the english dub and region free discs may indicate otherwise. That's why the price is outrageous and the menus are in Japanese.",1424908800,4,1375,4.48207171314741
