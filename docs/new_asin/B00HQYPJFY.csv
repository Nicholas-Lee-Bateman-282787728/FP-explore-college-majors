8634471,5,B00HQYPJFY,"I have bought several different DVD tap classes by other artists/producers and this is the first one that comes close to being what a real tap class is like. I love this DVD and cannot wait to try the rest of the series. Having already had some live tap classes (tap as a kid, plus two rounds of Absolute Beginner Workshop tap classes at Broadway Dance Center in NYC a few years ago), I knew many basic steps. However, I couldn't do them quickly, and I really couldn't put together several of them in a routine and ""get it"" after one or two go-throughs at breakneck speed. At age 64, my feet (especially the left one) doesn't always do what my brain demands right away and my memory for putting steps together isn't what it used to be. What I love about these classes and this teacher is that he gives you real time in the ""class"" to practice and practice and practice. You don't have to keep stopping the tape, rewinding and doing it again like with other tapes. And he talks to you like a real teacher would. He's funny in a dorky kind of way that is very endearing and I find myself chuckling during the class. Finally, I feel like I am attending an authentic class in the privacy of my home. Thank you thank you thank you Rod Howell for making these tapes. I bought Beginner 9/10, 11/12 and the whole advanced beginner series. Although I already know the ""new"" steps on Beginner 9/10, the routines at the end of each class are still challenging for me. I feel like learning these will help me to be able to ""drop in"" to basic Broadway Dance Center classes when I visit the city and actually survive them. And when I master the advanced beginner dvds, I will move on to the Intermediate and higher classes.",1496707200,,1709,4.360501567398119
