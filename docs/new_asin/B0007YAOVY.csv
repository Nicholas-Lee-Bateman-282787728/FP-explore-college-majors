8054136,5,B0007YAOVY,I tested a few of the lessons on the video before taking it over to my grandson and granddaughter a few towns over. One is age 12 and the other is age 5. I believe this would be most useful for the 5 year old. More of a review for my 12 yo grandson. I like it .. myself. I've drawn the first two characters. It's easy enough to get into each.lesson. i used the DVD player on a laptop to view.,1516060800,,392,3.792682926829268

8054139,5,B0007YAOVY,"My oldest son loves to draw and loves Veggie Tales so this seemed like a perfect fit, and I was not disappointed.  He loves this video and we immediately saw a vast improvement in his drawing.  Specifically with his drawing of Veggie Tales characters as drawn in the video itself, but also his application of the principles demonstrated to his other drawings as well.

I highly recommend this for any child who has an interest in art.",1367366400,,434,4.6103896103896105

8054143,5,B0007YAOVY,"This video was purchased for my 8 year old grandson. I wish you could see what he can accomplish using it. His artistic talent, even at his age, already is shining through, and that is verified by his teachers, not just his proud grandma.
Instructional videos such as this one should be more plentiful.
Thanks again. Mary W. Nelson",1259280000,3,331,4.627118644067797
