8434962,4,B004LVSSUI,"Overall this is a great antelope reference and action production.  A couple things I WISH they would have included:  Would be nice if they had mentioned something about the rifles, optics and especially bullet choices for each antelope hunt.  Gun nuts like me would like to know-not asking for a tutorial, just thirty seconds about the equiptment used.  Also, maybe they could have showed the scores of the animals they did harvest, so I could check myself and see how good or bad my own scoring skills are.  There is a bonus feature about scoring antelope that is short and sweet, exactly what I was hoping for, and some tips on equipment that were decent, maybe thirty seconds on how you handle your meat and capes would have been nice.-Amen on the spare tire comment, I've lost several in Wyoming!
Some of the camera work is sloppy, not typical of Eastman productions and Please, please, please stop showing the shooter as he/she (thanks for including the ladies, my wife and daughters also hunt)makes the shot-show the animals.  The only person who cares about watching the shooter, is the shooter!!!
Beware the shameless over-promotion of other Eastman products especially the book!  I expect outdoor producers to push sponsored products to the point of illness, and the self promotion is needlessly tacky.  I'll buy the book in spite of this and would recommend this dvd as action packed and the best dvd I have seen so far and I own about a dozen.  Just my opinions-",1456444800,,1473,4.767716535433071
