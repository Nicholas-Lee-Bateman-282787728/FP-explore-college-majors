8659818,1,B000TKG49W,"This is little more than a home video of someone cutting a child's hair.  And while she is a good hair dresser and does a nice job on the kid's hair, it is a low quality video with minimal tips on how to do it yourself.  I cannot believe I paid almost $30 for this home video!  It is shot in her home with a tarp behind her, she seems nervous and unsure of what to do.  There are multiple people talking in the background.  I did feel like I could cut bangs after watching it but as for doing a real hair cut... no.  I have two boys with short hair, so watching a demo on a long haired little boy was not beneficial.  I was very dissapointed with this dvd and again I really can't believe they are charging this outrageous price for a very low quality video.",1269734400,7,758,4.013333333333334
