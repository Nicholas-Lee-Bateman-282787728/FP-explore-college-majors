8593098,5,B00004RL62,"Another review on this page mistakenly lists this as the Cannon Films version of this story, a well done live action series of fairy tales. BUT, this is the animated version by the ever popular Rankin Bass Studio.

This is a Rankin Bass animated cartoon, (but not one of their ""Animagic"" stop motion features). It was one of the 30 minute episodes of the Festival of Family Classics that Rankin Bass Productions made for television broadcast on ABC in 1972-73. Rankin Bass made the many great holiday classics we all remember such as Frosty and Rudolph. If you are a fan of their films you will enjoy this great series very much.

This episode is the classic story of Puss and Boots, the tale of a poor peasnat boy who is befriended by a cunning magic cat. The cat helps the boy improve his life and marry a princess.

This episode has been recently re-mastered and is an extra on the holiday Animagic release DVD ""Here Comes Peter Cottontail"" by Golden Books Entertainment, who now owns the whole Rankin Bass catalog it seems and is treating their DVD releases very well with extras and remastering. Maybe they will release more of the episodes from the Festival, hopefully the full 18, remastered on a multi disc DVD set. These are very popular with the under 8 year old set once they see them.

Some of the 18 episodes were very much part of Americana with tales from fact and fiction such as Tom Sawyer, the Ballad of Paul Bunyan, Yankee Doodle, Johnny Appleseed, and Hiawatha. The other episodes in the series include classic literature and famous fables: Swiss Family Robinson, Cinderella, Puss `n Boots, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, Robinson Crusoe, Alice in Wonderland, A Christmas Tree, The Arabian Nights, Robin Hood, and two double length episodes - Around the World in 80 Days, and 20,000 Leagues Below the Sea.

VERSIONS TO LOOK FOR - The label Prism Entertainment or Video Craft International released these episodes as possibly the first vhs release in a clamshell package as a set of two episodes per vhs tape. For example JackO'Lantern and Yankee Doodle were on one tape. I am unsure of the year of this release since it is not listed on package or tape. These are very good quality video, sound and packaging, and the art on the box is authentic from the film. (There is a bad habit among video companies to use some hack art for animation covers that is not from the film, and makes the film look worse on the cover than what is actually on the tape, seems self defeating to me.) In 1988 Prism and Videocraft (now one word rather than Video Craft) released vhs copies in a slipcover package with one episode per tape, but the artwork on the cover does not look anything like the film. Both of the before mentioned Prism/Videocraft releases also say ""Childrens Video Playground"" on the front cover. In 1989 ""Starmaker Entertainment"" released some of the episodes, but their copies are not as good a quality as the Prism copies in my viewing of one episode, Johnny Appleseed. Also their cover art is not from the film and can throw you off. I will update quality and episode details this as I learn more. The most recent vhs re-release is from Anchor Bay Entertainment starting in 1989 but I am unsure yet of the quality or packaging.

Maybe you may remember these shows from the opening sequence that had the characters from fables, folk tales, and history walking out of a book and strolling across a rainbow while fireworks went off in the sky, the book opens with the title of the week's episode. I also seem to remember watching reruns in a classroom on 16mm but I could be wrong. It is really great that Amazon has the used feature for buying videos so that completists like me can search for the missing shows from our collections. There is also a good book on Rankin Bass for sale at Amazon, ""the Enchanted World of Rankin Bass"".",1128470400,,3854,4.610787172011662
