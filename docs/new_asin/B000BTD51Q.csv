2440977,5,B000BTD51Q,"If you are a liverpool fan and remember the greatest Champions league final ever seen... This is the DVD for you!  It had been years since I had seen this game, and it brought tears to my eyes.  To see RAFA in his first season with only two englishmen on his starting XI win the cup with the big ears again... was incredible.  Now I have the ability to watch it every week and remember the greatest game every played.... or maybe just those 6 minutes!!!",1278806400,,453,4.244186046511628
2440978,4,B000BTD51Q,"great video, only complaint is if you don't know what happened it's spoiled for you in the interviews at halftime. they should have show that later in the dvd. That way the new viewer would get the same experience as you do with the original broadcast of seeing the impossible come true.

Oh quality is kinda mediocre even for dvd. could have used a better less pixeled source. i've got an 720P HD version of the game and it looks a ton better obviously but even for dvd it's not the most perfect quality. still worth having in your collection though.",1248393600,,551,4.455445544554456

2440982,5,B000BTD51Q,"I'm thinking about ordering this cos it was an amazing comeback by Liverpool, but the title on the amazon.com page is incorrect and is distracting attention away from the product, also it says ""cisse steven gerrard""  cisse is one player and gerrard is another so their names must be apart---sorry i used to be a proofreader----please fix it thanks!!!!!! i know my punctuation and syntax etc are a bit loose but i'm off to bed

A LITTLE WHILE LATER

March 13th I'm back again and still no fix on the titles. Would you guys hire me as a stay at home proofreader? I'm reasonable and I don't need a company car

A LOT LATER

November 11th 2008 and the ""Instanbul Becky"" thing is gone! And we got a new President who should make HR 676 a law. Free Healthcare for all y'all.",1141862400,3,768,4.380281690140845

8092362,4,B000BTD51Q,"Down to the brass tacks: The video quality is nowhere near what you'd expect from watching any of today's games, but it is still enough to watch some of the greatest players of generations past. Luis Figo, Dida, and Kaka showcase their abilities against LFC, along with younger versions of Gerrard, Xabi and Carragher, and wind up going up 3-0 at the half, only to be the victims of one of the greatest comebacks in football history. If I had to guess, I'd say that this video was shot, by a local crew, live in Istanbul and that's the reason for the poorer than normal quality of footage. That, alone, makes it more authentic than anything that has been digitally remastered.

Other than the stepped down video quality, this video contains bonus footage of the team on the way to the tournament and allows you to get to know them all just that much more (as if any of us know them for real).

As the title says, this video is a MUST HAVE for any true supporter of Liverpool FC and should be picked up before it becomes unavailable. TOO LATE TOO LATE will be the cry when the sale of this video passes by.",1381536000,,1105,4.359223300970874

8092364,5,B000BTD51Q,A fantastic come from behind win.  Sensational football and sheer guts and determination by Liverpool to show you should never give up,1377734400,,134,5.090909090909091
