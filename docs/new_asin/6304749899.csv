918350,5,6304749899,The Wonder Years was a show that just about everyone can relate to. It is a show that tells the story of growing up. The writers do a very good job of presenting the stories both serious and humorous. This video includes  the very last episode which is probably the best of all of them. Anyone who  enjoyed this show should own this video.,933984000,5,339,4.28125

Being about the same age as Kevin Arnold would have been I can really relate to each episode and this set brought back many good memories of my favorite moments. Hopefully every episode will be on DVD soon but until then - Enjoy It!!",1085875200,,309,4.0

7876565,5,6304749899,"""The Wonder Years"" is the BEST where all talents come together.  All tapes and DVD of ""The Wonder Years"" are valuable, and this tape is no exception.

7876566,5,6304749899,"I'm pretty sure that I've seen every single episode of the wonder years, I rarely see it on Nick at Night anymore, which is a downside, but a good reason to get these videos. This show is so awsome, it was one of my faves, and gives out a lot of teen situations and advice for teens, but its a fun show starring Fred Savage, who you can see grow up onscreen as Kevin.",970272000,,367,3.972972972972973
