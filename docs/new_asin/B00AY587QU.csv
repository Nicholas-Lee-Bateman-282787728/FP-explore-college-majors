5527296,4,B00AY587QU,"Delightfully cheesy collection of 2 wrestling movies and one starring legendary wrestler Roddy Piper. Video quality okay, but nothing to write home about. Worth it if you find it at a good price just for the inclusion of the vintage footage of the Shiek in the ring!",1429228800,,266,4.680851063829787
5527297,5,B00AY587QU,All 3 of these films are a must have for longtime wrestling fans! GRUNT! and I Like to Hurt People especially. Hell Comes to Frogtown isn't necessarily a wrestling flick but is a fun science fiction movie starring Roddy Piper. The surviving Farhat sons have on occassion have said they are going to make a sequel called I Like To Hurt People Too. So far they haven't delivered but still run an indy league called AWWL in the midwest that has staged tributes to The Sheik over the years.,1421539200,,486,4.47191011235955
5527298,5,B00AY587QU,"Haven't watched it yet.  Just the fact that I got it, in new condition, for such a bargain is worth the 5 star rating.  Once I watch it, I will chime in again.  No possibility of being let down unless the DVD just doesn't play.  Other than that all my expectations have been met.",1421366400,,279,4.111111111111111
5527299,5,B00AY587QU,5 stars all the way for this bad boy. Happy that Grunt! the wresting movie finally made it to DVD. All three movies are solid. Would recommend this for any true wrestling fan.,1374019200,6,175,4.333333333333333
