in the Sean Penn Vehicle Colors, but more Note wothy South central. I purchased
Kilos on a whem not knowing much about it,  but I like the little underated movies he's appeared in so far, so I decided to give it a chance.  there's not that
much to the story but the movie does have it's moments. I think his movies don't
always have the A list as far as production gos but its far above a B movie as
far as acting and production. So I recomend renting it first, but I must say
that I'm not sorry that I purchased it.",1331596800,,597,4.094017094017094
8038041,5,B000641YVY,"One young man's desire to rise from his ghetto upbringing leads him into a life of crime, an action which has unexpected worldwide consequences, in this urban drama. Ricky Ross (Glenn Plummer) grew up in South Central Los Angeles, and as he came of age in the 1980s, he was desperate to earn enough money to make his way out of the ghetto. Convinced that dealing drugs was the easiest way for a young African-American to gain wealth, Ricky formed a gang called the Freeway Boyz, who in collaboration with a distributor from South America began importing cocaine into California. Ricky and his cohorts soon find a ready market for their drugs after they process the cocaine into crack, but the Freeway Boyz aren't initially aware that their American contacts are affiliated with the CIA -- and they're using the profits from drug dealing to finance a brutal right-wing political faction overseas. 100 Kilos also stars Dwayne Adway and Suzanne Mari. ~ Mark Deming, All Movie Guide",1136160000,2,978,4.862275449101796
8038042,3,B000641YVY,This movie is one of the first movies that tells some truth about crack. Because this is a movie some parts are just for entertainment but all in all this movie is pretty good. I say its a pretty good movie to start to learn how the crack trade started. After watching this movie read some of the books by gary webb or do a web search on ricky ross and you will be surprised what you find.,1108684800,2,389,4.0
