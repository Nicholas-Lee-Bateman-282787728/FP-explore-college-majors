2457356,1,B000CCUBC8,"I am hoplessly hooked on this series and Netflix has most of the episodes but the 4th series wasn't available so I ordered these dvds. They wouldn't play on my American DVD player. They are for Region 4 only (Australia, but not the US) I returned them and Amazon was great about it.",1403222400,,282,4.339622641509434
2457357,5,B000CCUBC8,"Highly recommended, great stories, love the accent, allows you to see the beautiful SA countryside. Will rewatch continually for years",1403049600,,134,5.75
2457358,5,B000CCUBC8,"This is one of my absolute Favorite shows of all time!  I worried when they killed off a beloved character in Season 3 but thankfully they added an equally beloved character in Stevie.  There is so much angst, joy, love, hate....it's hard to stop watching!  I found myself watching several episodes at one time!  It's helpful if you've watched this show from the beginning to fully understand the nuances of each character.  I would recommend this to all who love family oriented television shows!",1400112000,,497,4.869047619047619
2457359,5,B000CCUBC8,Awesome series!  Have been a fan for years.  WB only ran first 3 seasons.  Had to purchase so I could watch the rest!,1397088000,,117,4.0
2457360,5,B000CCUBC8,Have watched 5 and a half series so far and will complete the series. Need two more seasons to complete the series.,1396310400,,115,4.2727272727272725
2457361,5,B000CCUBC8,i would highly recommend this video. From start of first season to the last on season eight it is an excellent program. The scenery is beautiful the actors and actresses are fantastic. Better than Most everything we have here in the States.,1395360000,,240,4.738095238095238
2457362,5,B000CCUBC8,"Why didn't the ""feral"" dog eat on the sheep?  Oops.  Who was supposed to do the research?
Otherwise, still a good watch.",1389052800,,120,4.409090909090909
2457363,4,B000CCUBC8,"One of the most entertaining series I've seen, well acted with a strong dose of reality, of country life in the outback. The characters are all compelling, and give a sense of a carefully planned series, with one twist after another. Most entertaining.",1388102400,,252,4.883720930232558
2457364,3,B000CCUBC8,Too many character changes.  Big shock buying this season before completing the third season and finding out one of the main main main characters is killed off and another leaves for a good portion of the season (even more so that the actress playing that main character is the reason I started watching to begin with!),1384819200,,319,4.696428571428571
2457365,5,B000CCUBC8,"I loved all 8 seasons of this series.  However, if ordering online, it is important to make sure you get a DVD that works in the US.  I mistakenly ordered a Region 4 DVD that would not work on my system .....the vendor was very helpful in giving me a credit.  I finally had to go to Netflix to get all 8 seasons which turned out to be a lot less expensive in the end.",1384387200,,367,3.8666666666666667
2457366,5,B000CCUBC8,"I have loved this whole series since I found it on Netflix ! Had to buy it to watch at our camp where no Internet can be found! Wished they had continued the series! I give it a thumbs up!

2457367,5,B000CCUBC8,"A beautiful mini-series.  Watched it first from the Library, then decided to buy them for my collection of movies.  Thanks!",1379894400,,123,5.1
2457368,5,B000CCUBC8,"This is a wonderful series.  I am an Aussie and it definitely is very authentic - except for the cattle duffing (rustling) bits -it hugely overplays the crime situation, however I guess that makes for good tension.  I came from a West Australian cattle station so I am very familiar with outback life - although this is semi rural the problems are very similar.

American audiences may have some difficulty with the language.  We are; as some wit said; two countries separated by a common language",1379462400,,497,4.744186046511628
2457369,5,B000CCUBC8,purchased complete series for something to do while recovering from shoulder surgery.  Only viewed the first 2 seasons on TV.,1378771200,,125,5.25
2457370,5,B000CCUBC8,"HOW COULD THEY KILL OFF CLAIRE? As far as I'm concerned, SHE WAS THE SHOW! I bawled like a baby through the last 3 episodes of Season 3 - and I'm a guy, for goodness sakes! I had seen the pilot for the series sometime ago on tv, and since I like horses, I decided to try the series. And even though they used different actors in the series, I was hooked pretty quick. I just ordered season 4, so I really don't know if I'll continue after that - but from what I saw of the ""new girl"" Stevie, it may still be worth watching - BUT SHE'S NO CLAIRE!",1376092800,4,545,3.918918918918919
2457371,5,B000CCUBC8,"I found McLeod's daughters on an obscure cable channel many years ago.  When it stopped airing, I had to find out how the ongoing story was unfolding, so I set about buying the entire series.  Yes, it is a ""soap"" but has characters you wind up caring about.  And the setting in Australia is stunning",1371168000,,299,4.4
2457372,5,B000CCUBC8,I purchased the whole series.  Very much enjoy the plot and struggles of these women trying to survive and run a ranch.  The scenery is very beautiful.,1366934400,,151,4.555555555555555
2457373,4,B000CCUBC8,"realistic acting, beautiful country side....all around awesome series. The actors draw you into their character, they become like family...weird huh",1366848000,,148,6.45
2457374,5,B000CCUBC8,"I bought these for my Dad since he is hooked on this series, but now of course, after paying all that money for Series 1-4 all of them came out on Netflix & Hulu!!!  Figures.",1366329600,,174,3.9714285714285715
2457375,5,B000CCUBC8,"Can't get enough of these strong, capable women. Wish we had more of this kind of television entertainment available in the US.",1365552000,,127,4.818181818181818
2457376,4,B000CCUBC8,"We have watched 2 of the disks and other than not having the cover pictures it seems like new. With so many more episodes to go McLeods Daughters might make someone rich!

2457378,5,B000CCUBC8,I HAVE THE WHOLE SET NOW AND LOVE EVERY SEASON. THIS IS A GREAT SERIES. ALL THE DVD'S WORK WONDERFUL AND I SAY BUY IT.,1348531200,,118,3.76
2457379,1,B000CCUBC8,"One of the DVD's in Season 4 is defective - won't play due to a crack.  I followed all your online instructions for a return including an appointment with UPS to pick up the package.  They never showed up.  I really wanted to exchange the defective package for another Season 4 but, apparently, that's not possible.  In the meantime, I still have the defective pacage.  At this point, I'm not a satisfied customer.  I don't even have a return address for the package - that was supposed to be on the UPS label.  Can you help?

I thoroughly enjoyed all the seasons that I have watched to date and am disappointed that i couldn't complete watching Season 4.

Thanks in advance for your asistance.

2457381,5,B000CCUBC8,McLeod's Daughters is a really good Series and keeps you wanting more.  I started collecting the series after watching all of it last year when I was home ill.  My daughter and I both liked it so much that I decided to collect the entire series so that we could watch it whenever we wanted to.,1319500800,,293,4.214285714285714
2457382,1,B000CCUBC8,"I am sure this DVD is just fine. I don't know since I haven't opened it. I bought it as a gift, but the giftee already found the item. I have contacted you regarding return and have heard nothing. Please contact.",1318982400,,212,4.195121951219512
2457383,5,B000CCUBC8,Absolutely FANTASTIC.  Shipping was quick and received in excellent condition.  All the MCLeod's Daughters Seasons are out of sight.  I first started getting them on Netflix and really got into this series so I just decided it is something I would watch over and over again so I ordered the whole series 1 through 8 which is a total of 52 disks and WELL WORTH IT from Amazon.com!  Adding it to my collection of 2000 movies.,1314489600,,423,4.526315789473684
2457384,5,B000CCUBC8,"If you've seasons 1-3 of McLeod's Daughters, you probably don't know if you want to watch anymore. But, do. The entire eight seasons of McLeod's Daughters is fantastic and a wonderful show! It's incredibly addicting and hard to stop watching. If you aren't sure after season 3, give a try. You won't be disappointed.",1267660800,,316,4.87037037037037
2457385,2,B000CCUBC8,"McCleod's daughters was unique for television; it had heart, spirit, and charm.  The premise of a group of determined women with a common goal, the development of their characters, their personal growth through life's ups and downs, was fabulous.  The first three seasons focused on connections, to family, friends, heritage and the land.

The 4th season on is just another tv drama, good at times, but without the same focus on family ties and station life that so engrossed me.  I couldn't wait to see all of the Seasons 1 through 3.  Although the end of Season 3 was extremely well done - (I cried, and I never cry!)  it truly gutted the show.  The storyline moved too far away from the initial relationships and rural life, and became too convoluted to be believable.",1245628800,3,771,4.708955223880597
2457386,4,B000CCUBC8,After Claire character was lilled off last season the lost something;they tried to make up for it by bring in more characters;I still in enjoyed to old characters and their story but season 4 was the end for me.,1235260800,,211,4.435897435897436
2457387,5,B000CCUBC8,"I was concerned after the loss of Claire how the cast would make it, but wow.  They really keep the spirit of Drover's and Claire alive.  And the story lines still draw you right in.  Cant wait for the next release!!!",1201478400,2,217,4.2439024390243905
2457388,3,B000CCUBC8,"I have to say I was a bit dissapointed with season 4.  This doesn't mean I didn't watch or enjoy it, but the show really is not the same without you know who.

Like a good book you can hardly put down, I couldn't wait to find 39 minutes to fit in an episode of McLeod's Daughters from Seasons 1-3.  (My mother loaned me all three seasons at once, talking about starting an addiction and feeding it at the same time!!!)  Anyway, I got through the first three seasons at a ridiculous pace.

Then came season 4.  It started off kind of wierd (after the ending of season 3, you know...).  But...I did enjoy it. However, with season four I was not obsessing over when I'd be able to fit in the next episode in, or having an eight episode marathon Saturday.  It just wasn't that captivating.

One thing that is odd, Drover's run just doesn't seem to be on the financial brink at all times in season 4.  There used to be talk of bills, or payments, or sales, or contracts on practically every episode of seasons 1-3,  all of a sudden in Season 4 financial problems are mentioned only once in a blue moon.

I have pre ordered season 5, and will probably order every season and watch till season 8.  However, there was no way i could give this 5 stars, after giving seasons 1-3 5 stars.  It is still a great show, and we've got nothing like it on American tv, but it's not as good as before.",1201392000,11,1382,4.2251908396946565
2457389,5,B000CCUBC8,"Hurray, this fantastic Australian drama is finally available in USA-format DVD. The first three seasons were broadcast by just one American channel, which then dropped it. Then ensued a long drought. At last, the story continues thanks to Koch Vision, the Nine Network, and Millennium Television. As always, the writing, casting, and acting are engaging, intimate, and utterly real. The setting in South Australia is sublimely beautiful. This is a wonderful show that deserves much greater exposure outside Australia.",1201392000,2,517,5.556962025316456
2457390,5,B000CCUBC8,Still one of the best shows ever created.  There's nothing like this on American television.,1201392000,,92,5.133333333333334

2457392,1,B000CCUBC8,"I loved season 1 to 3, and I gave season 4 a chance, even though I loved Claire. This season had some good moments, but for the most part it felt slow and too dramatic. I was and am very disappointed with season 4. Finally Nick and Tess marry and there is not a little while of happiness, the next big problem arrives. I am cured of McLeod's daughters. I have no urge to see season 5.",1199923200,6,384,4.0
2457393,4,B000CCUBC8,"I wondered how Season 4 would be without Claire and Becky, but it's held up pretty well.  This is the year Tess and Nick FINALLY get married, so it's worth the wait just for that.  I'd like to see more Tess and Nick from here on out since Claire is gone.  This is one of the best quality shows I have ever watched, and it's totally addicting...something about those characters just draws you in and keeps you there.  Get this season, especially if you've been waiting for the big wedding.  It's a real shame WE TV dropped this series from their schedule.  I dropped them from my cable as a result.  Why are good shows dropped in favor or reality shows--boggles the mind.....",1199577600,3,674,4.430894308943089
2457394,5,B000CCUBC8,"After seeing the end of 3 seasons,and the actors that left the show,I did not think season 4 would measure-up to high standards of season 1-3. But after taking my British friend Diana's advice,I decided to try one more season. With ""Claire""-played by very talented,and beloved fan favorite Ms. Lisa Chappell,and""Becky"" gone it's not quite as good;but there is still much to love here!!!! The eposode ""For Love Or Money"" will I promise make you cry,and ponder the human condition of love!!! Also there are many other moments that will make you laugh,cry,and think how we are all very much alike!!! There is plenty to see here,but I must admit it is not quite as good as seasons 1-3; but I also must admit that I will  purchase the next season !!!!",1196208000,7,746,4.651515151515151
