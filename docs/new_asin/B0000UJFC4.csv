8003151,3,B0000UJFC4,"Groucho Marx sung the song ""Lydia the Tattooed Lady"" in the 30s describing a circus performer covered in tattoos.  In the 1930s you'd only see tattoos on women in a cirus sideshow, now Playboy in an attempt to be edgy has named one as the 50th Anniversary Playmate. Don't get me wrong, a small tattoo in the right place can look cute (an example would be the Hot Chilli Pepper on Jodi Ann Paterson right butt cheek), but I think older viewers will be turned off by the number on Colleen Shannon's legs and the Teles Twins back and bikini line.
  Personally the Bonus material is what makes the Dvd worth buying.  On one disc you have Video profiles of Previous Anniversary Playmates Penny Baker, Fawna McLauren, Anna Marie Goddard and Jaime Bergman.
  Colleen Shannon's Video Profile follows the same format Playboy has been using for 15 years.  It starts with the Opening title with Colleen lounging, trying to look elegant against a tiled ballroom.  Next, a too short outdoor in the grass vignette (the only outdoor spot in the program), followed by a fantasy though the walk-in-closet.  The opening portion of her closet fantasy features her in a Black miniskirt and stilletos, its here that the tattoos real become a distraction.  Covering both ankles and lower legs, it's like some spray painted the art in the A.G.O, and now all you can see is the graffiti.  There are several more unmemorable scenes, the standard mother daughter banter scene and another with Colleen sitting in a chair telling the viewer the kind of girl she's not.  This scene might of worked except that Colleen sounds like Luan from King of the Hill.  Colleen's best scene is a copy of the famous lingerie commercial made by Kylie Minogue, you know the one where she's riding the mechanical bull.
  Overall the cameramen/women and production crew did the best with what they had to work with, and once again the viewer is wondering why they picked this blonde over the likes of Jenny Haase or some other contestant.  If you like a pretty blonde painted in ink you'll love this disc, if not you'll find it more annoying then erotic.",1075852800,13,2109,4.705722070844686
