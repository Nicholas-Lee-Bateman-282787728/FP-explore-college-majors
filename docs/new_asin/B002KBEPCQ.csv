8623934,1,B002KBEPCQ,"I was enjoying this DVD I bought and then at the end, well there is no end. The DVD simply stops and turns off. I attempted 2 other dvd players in my home and it simply gets to the ending and stops as in the disc just sits on a scene then turns off. Soooo VERY disappointing. I would have bought more of these episodes but there is no point if I can't finish it. Not happy, waste of money!",1394755200,6,389,3.875
