This film tells the true story of life, works, struggles and tribulations of Vice-Admiral John Madison ""Uncle John"" Hoskins (1898-1964) during years 1942-1951. His participation in both World War II and Korean War are an important part of the film, but quite a lot of time is devoted to, well, other topics, including the burden his career imposed to his wife and children. I simply cannot say much more in order to avoid spoilers.

I would advise you to NOT research admiral Hoskins before watching this film. ""The eternal sea"" follows very faithfully the real events and if you google too much, well, it will spoil your pleasure of discovering the whole story by yourself. And the story is worth discovering - it is not for nothing that Hoskins was for a time a familiar face for Americans, as his face was on the cover of many magazines (and for good reasons too)...

This is not exactly a war movie but rather a military biography, in which the two wars are of course very present, but the fighting scenes are few. The most important part of the story takes place in last months of WWII far from the frontlines and later in the post-war years, before the Korean War begins. Also, this film gives a lot of importance to the ""home front"" and the heavy, very heavy burden naval-military career places on the families. The wife of the admiral, Sue Hoskins (Alexis Smith), is a character as crucially important as the main hero - and her struggles and sacrifices are not lesser than those of her husband. Previously completely unknown to me actress Alexis Smith played her with a great skill - I will certainly look for more of her films.

Most of the film however is a one-Sterling-Hayden-show. In this film he plays a very noble character, quite different from those which made his reputation. He is mostly remembered for films in which he played a dangerous gangster (""The Asphalt Jungle"", ""The Killing""), a not entirely stable gunfighter (""Johny Guitar""), barking mad general (""Dr Strangelove"") or a corrupt cop (""The Godfather""). But he played also the good (albeit tough) guys and here is an occasion to discover this less known aspect of his career. I was quite impressed with his acting here and I will look for some of his other less known films, because I would like to see him more.

I will stop here, to avoid any temptation of spoilers. I liked this film a lot and I will definitely keep the DVD for another viewing. A recommened thing for all amateurs of military films and of good cinema in general. ENJOY!",1453680000,,2661,4.665245202558635

This is a bit of history most will never know, not only about Admiral Hoskins, but how we came to have jets on aircraft carriers.",1427846400,,274,4.037037037037037
