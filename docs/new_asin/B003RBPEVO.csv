8403486,5,B003RBPEVO,"My Wife used this on a regular basis during her pregnancy with our second child - she was big into the whole yoga thing prior to becoming pregnant, and wanted to be able to continue with it, as well as she insists it would make her feel more comfortable throughout - I cannot speak from personal experience, but my wife is a pretty tough critic and says this dvd set was great",1428969600,,376,4.236111111111111
8403487,2,B003RBPEVO,"I liked the routine but the instructor talks the entire way through it, making it rather difficult to concentrate on breath and relaxation.  She becomes more of a distraction.",1348790400,,175,5.0344827586206895
8403488,3,B003RBPEVO,Personally I liked the Prenatal Yoga dvd.  It flowed smoothly.  The third trimester yoga I thought was a little harder and I didn't like it as much.  I haven't listened to the audio cd as of yet.,1324166400,,195,4.216216216216216
8403489,3,B003RBPEVO,"The second trimester yoga DVD is pretty good, but the up-dog suggestion is ""iffy."" As a yoga teacher, I don't know if I'd recommend that to prenatal students, and it hurts my belly, personally. The third trimester yoga DVD is very repetitive, and they also suggest a bunch of up-dog poses (multiple times in a repeated sun salutation).  I got more use out of the second trimester DVD.  The adudio CD was OK.  The visualization techniques were not new to me, but they do help with relaxation a little.  In all, I don't feel as though the listing for this ad ""Prenatal Yoga Video 3 Disc Set (2 DVDs + 1 Audio CD) Prenatal Yoga, Third Trimester Yoga, and Relaxation and Pain Management, Pregnancy Strength Building, Mental Focus, Relaxation, Reflexology, Labor and Delivery Coping Skills, Child Birth Education, Exercise, Toning, Labor Preparation, Breathing Patterns and Techniques"" was quite right.  I guess I was just expecting more on all the topics listed, and I don't recall hearing or seeing anything about reflexology at all.

Used this set, but it just wasn't exactly what I was hoping for.  I found a need to search out other prenatal yoga routines to do on a daily basis, and have found Hypnobirthing CD's to be better for relaxation.",1322438400,,1242,4.802816901408451
8403490,4,B003RBPEVO,I like having the dvds and cds at home. It was convience for me I didn't have to work around a classroom schedule.,1287014400,,114,4.0
8403491,5,B003RBPEVO,"My order quickly arrived 4 days after placing it and had chosen standard shipping.  MyBirthClass did not currently have the item that I had ordered, it was on back order.  However, I was happily astonished when I read the letter they sent with a completely upgraded version of what I had ordered.  They provided me with the full 8 disc set that included my individual selection, and then some!  How wonderful!  I greatly appreciated their decision to go above and beyond what they needed to do.  I will recommend this company to friends who are also preparing for a baby.  They greatly exceeded my expectations!!!",1283990400,,613,4.780952380952381
