8229889,4,B000XUOLUW,Great Hockey moments.  Nice comparisons.  10 year old son loved it.  It taught him a little more about some of the older guys he was not as familiar with.,1427673600,,154,4.241379310344827
8229890,4,B000XUOLUW,"i got this a while ago. i've watched it a few times and it has great audio and video quality. great interviews with past and present players, and some great extras. the only thing it lacks is MORE HIGHLIGHTS. i'm the type of person who can watch hockey highlights all day long. but for this price its good for the content you get. i think the comparisons from today's great players to former NHL legends is pretty close, also. just an overall well constructed dvd and NHL keepsake. !!!!!!!!!!! :)",1289779200,,496,4.522222222222222

8229892,5,B000XUOLUW,"I've slammed a couple of NHL DVD releases here on Amazon, which is why I suddenly felt moved to actually write a positive review of this disc, as it most certainly exceeded my expectations.  Why?  Well, the main program itself is just fine, with plenty of hockey highlights and a minumum of the boring non-hockey ""up close and personal"" material that crippled the recent ""NHL All-Access"" disc.  But what really prompted me to post a review of this disc is to alert people to three bonus videos that are mentioned nowhere on the DVD packaging (or on this Amazon page):  The entire 28-minute 2004 jersey retirement ceremony for Mike Richter at Madison Square Garden, the entire 26-minute 2006 ceremony for Scott Stevens at Continental Airlines Arena, and, at 52 minutes, the 2007 ceremony for Steve Yzerman at Joe Louis Arena in Detroit.  Outstanding!--and well worth the price of the disc for these three videos alone.",1219449600,8,917,4.890322580645162
