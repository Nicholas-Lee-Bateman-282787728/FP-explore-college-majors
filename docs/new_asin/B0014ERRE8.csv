I am very happy with this purchase.",1366934400,,142,4.5
8255417,3,B0014ERRE8,"The ""Step Barrel/Spine Corrector"" DVD is a short and advanced workout at about 21 minutes.  It is fast paced and you are already expected to be knowledgeable and have experience already from a Pilates instructor.

[Please note that the video quality is that of a VHS tape and the audio has a slight echo.  The setting is in a room at a house.  Nevertheless, it is o.k. enough to see and hear without any issues.]

I felt that the workout was a little short and there should have been more exercises shown.  Many exercises were advanced, and in general,  modifications were not shown.

Jillian Hessel instructs and demonstrates.  She also uses an audible Pilates breath technique.  I have to admire that Ms. Hessel shows amazing strength, core stability, control, and flexibiliy in her demonstration of the exercises.

Here is the breakdown.

Total time (21:13)

1. Spinal articulation and abdominal exercises

Port de Bras arms (or reach): A pair of two pound weights are used.
I got a little dizzy doing this first exercise.  I had to stop momentarily.  I continued and I was fine.
Roll-up: A Pilates pole (a wand, a wooden dowel or short bar wiil do) is used.

2. Supine leg & core work:  In this section, some positions were awkward.  Some of the exercises were too difficult, advanced, or dangerous for me to attempt.

Running
Scissors
Bicycle
Fish (had to modify)
Roll-over (skipped)
Small bridge with battements
High bridge (skipped)
Corkscrew (had to modify)
Side scissors
Helicopter (skipped)

3. Prone extension exercises

Back, arm and leg extension (had to modify)
Swimming (could not do)
Grasshopper

4. Side-lying exercises:  These are actually stretches and were  easy to do.

Scapular mobilization
Diagonal reach
Arm circle

5. Teaser (an advanced teaser which I had to modify)",1333670400,5,1792,4.966216216216216
8255418,5,B0014ERRE8,"This is a really cool, little used piece of Pilates equipment.  They are starting to make it now in lightweight, compressed foam, so it is inexpensive to buy from some of the top Pilates equipment manufacturers, such as Balanced Body.  The Spine Corrector literally  turns a conventional Pilates mat routine upside down!  It is not recommended for folks with high blood pressure or neck problems, but for the rest of us, it's a blast.  It changes a familiar mat workout just enough to challenge and tone different muscles groups, and creates new coordination patterns--very refreshing!",1203552000,11,585,5.11578947368421
