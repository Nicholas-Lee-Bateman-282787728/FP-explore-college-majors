643258,5,6303407161,"When I first heard about this movie, I thought, ""A guy cheats on a quiz show.  What a dumb idea.""  Then when it was up for the 1994 Oscar  for Best Picture, I said to myself, ""Well, I saw the other four movies  up for BP this year.""  So I rented it.  Then I bought it.  Then it was  playing in my VCR almost every day as background sound when I played on the  computer or ate.  I have the dialogue pretty much memorized now.  The movie  is art.  It was an instant classic.  A must see.  Every time I watch it I  notice something new or ""get"" a joke I never understood before.  It has fantastic actors, unbelievable dialogue, and is a cute little story.  This reigns as my favorite movie of all time.",966556800,21,699,4.051851851851852
643259,5,6303407161,"I am a fan of Robert Redford as both an actor and a director, and as the latter this is his crowning achievement. It has the subtlety and scharacter development of Ordinary People with the good natured love of A River Runs  Through It. But it also has an understanding look at it's characters and  that is what won me over. No one is all good or all bad the film shows  everyone fairly and without prejudice. Quiz Show is powerful without  getting in your face and moving without feeling manipulative. It is what  all films try and achieve. Realism, depth and subtlety all rolled together.  Ralph Fiennes is fantastic so is Mr. Morrow and John Turturro is excellent.

With the flood of big money, small brains quiz shows with multiple choice  questions that have hit the air waves in the past year, no one can deny the  prophetic power of the film.

643263,5,6303407161,"Robert Redford does it again in this much lauded film that is flawlessly executed with pathos and suspense, and, incidentally, one of the top picks of 1994.  ""Quiz Show"" is the absorbing, engrossing story of  tirumphs and downfalls (of both tv showbiz and personalities).  The cast is  quite remarkable--John Turturro is brilliant and sympathetically strikes a  cord with us, Rob Morrow is nothing short of powerful, and Ralph Fiennes is  stiffly and guiltily confused as one who has to live up to the incredible  reputation of his father (played by Paul Scofield, who's absolutely  terrific).  There's some awesome directing that requires a second viewing  (including where Fiennes is rubbing his sweaty cheeck with a cold bottle of  milk, as if to cool his shame).  The script is also extremely witty and  literate; in other words, brilliant and remarkable.  The cinematography is  very effective and observant (the game show owners says to Ralph Fiennes,  ""It's okay, there's only the three of us,"" and the camera looks  at Fiennes, towering over him ominously).  ""Quiz Show"" is a  masterpiece, a thriller with brains, a drama with heart.  Don't miss this.",948499200,7,1159,5.096256684491979

643396,5,6303407161,"Although I can recall quite clearly when Robert Redford's QUIZ SHOW first came out (in 1994), I never actually watched the film until last night.  Let me say first that I have rarely seen either a movie re-creation of the 1950's that rings truer or an opening sequence (shots of New York and New Yorkers, accompanied by Bobby Darin's rendition of ""Mack the Knife"") that is smoother or more engaging.  The behind-the-cameras and before-the-cameras views of the (re-enacted) quiz program ""Twenty-One"" are still more seamless and riveting; this is direction at its very best.  The film's plot, of course, deals with the quiz-show scandal of the late 1950's that involved contestants Herbert Stempel, a working class Jewish man from Queens, and Charles Van Doren, a privileged, Ivy Leaguer who resided in Connecticut.  Other reviewers have summarized the plot; I will only add that QUIZ SHOW's script vilifies no one involved, though it does present moral and ethical issues for our consideration.

The performances are uniformly excellent, with John Turturro as Herb Stempel (a bigger role than that of Charles Van Doren) making the strongest impression.  Paul Scofield is entirely believable as Charles' venerable father, the academic Mark Van Doren.  Scofield's countryman, the young Ralph Fiennes, was perfectly cast as Charles himself.  Blond and blue eyed -- the opposite physical type to the ""ethnic"" Turturro, which is apt -- Fiennes makes Van Doren's internal, moral dilemma abundantly clear.  His beautifully delivered, genuinely humble address at the Congressional hearing in the penultimate scene of the film will have you in tears.  Although he does not sound fully at ease with the American accent, which turns his voice nasal, Fiennes' mouth and eyes are most expressive:  he is an actor capable of evoking audience sympathy with his gaze alone.  David Paymer and Hank Azaria as the two NBC executives who ""discard"" Stempel and lure Van Doren, and Rob Morrow as the lawyer who handles the wronged contestants' cases, are all equally effective.  As written, Paymer's and Azaria's characters might be one-dimensional; their acting is not.

It is a mystery to me why QUIZ SHOW was not honored with Oscars, as nearly everything about it seems ideal.  Rarely has there been an American movie that better evokes the era in which it is set or that handles a past ""scandal"" with such fairness.  Highly recommended.",1477526400,3,2417,5.143222506393862

643556,5,6303407161,"This reviewer will not presume the surpass the other reviews for this film. This is a great film. If the story had not been based actual on real events, the story of the Quiz Show Scandals in the late 1950s could have been conceived by Shakespeare. It moves with the drama of a thriller, the mystery of a detective story, and ends with the pathos of King Lear. The impact is made greater from the fact that the underlying core of the story was accurate  some artistic license was given to the unfolding of the actual events, to which Redford replied that he was trying to make a compelling movie, not a documentary    and actual dialogue was used.

In the quiz show scandals, Charles Van Doren, an upper class educator from a distinguished literary family, overtook the national attention by unseating Herb Stempel, an equally educated but idiosyncratic, working class joe, by having the answers fed to him, in the quiz show $64,000.00 Question. Stempel had also had the answers fed to him, but regretted it and later attempted to expose the fraud. Van Doren never did. Once on the cover of Time magazine, Van Doren became a national disgrace. This movie is graced with fine performances of all around.

Charles Van Doren is living proof that intellectual acuity and upper class upbringing does not equate moral rectitude.

The crucial point of the film is when the Van Doren family and friends are leisurely enjoying an afternoon meal in their tony, country estate. While the tony guests are cheerfully talking, Charles Van Doren, a main protagonist, quotes from Much Ado About Nothing:

What men dare do,
What men may do,
What men daily do,
Not knowing what they do.

This quotation becomes the metaphor for this movie and of the entire quiz show scandal.

Indeed, the makers of the $64,000.00 Question dared to present a phony quiz show, and rather than have the contestants achieve their riches through merit, rigged the game in the avowed aim of giving the viewing audience a good show.

The federal prosecutor, Richard Goodwin, dared to start Congressional investigations for possible federal law violations. In order to do so, he found it necessary to ingratiate himself with the Van Dorens and their ilk, taking care not to get too close. The viewer  and the Goodwin character   at times is left with the impression that sometimes he got too close.

Herb Stempel, the every-day, common man, dared to expose the scandal in his own foible ridden, imperfect way.

Charles Van Doren, on the other hand, went along with the fix, and indeed, for all his education, erudition, and privilege, did not realize, until, that is, when it was too late, that the entire process was wrong, exposing the moral bankruptcy of his class. The entire picture is summarized by the comments of Congressman Derounian, who, at the Congressional hearings commented, both in the movie and in the actual hearings, that Charles Van Doren should not be commended for telling the truth.

Van Doren thus became an embarrassment to the nation and his class and has largely lived outside of the national spotlight ever since. This movie can be seen as a moral, political and social allegory, a narrative of events, or of a simple example of human hubris, and it is even more poignant because it is based on actual events. It works well on many levels.",1465862400,,3325,4.795096322241681
643557,5,6303407161,"An all-star cast comes together to present an amazing dramatization of real-life events of the late 1950s.  It proves that you cannot judge a book by its cover or a film by its name.  One wouldn't think that a film based on events involving a television quiz show could be interesting, but one would be wrong.  Everything about this film is absolutely perfect, which is extremely rare for Hollywood.  The cinematography is excellent without being attention-grabby; the writing is realistic and era-appropriate; the music is apropos overall, subtle when it should be and prominent when it should be; the acting is perfect; the pacing is perfect.

It tells the story of how television lost its innocence, and took down the American people and the world with it.

There is no greater force in this new medium than the television quiz show as ordinary Americans put their intellect to the ultimate test. Quiz show champions became national heroes and quasi celebrities and have a comfortable existence. This seems like a terrific world and all you have to do is keep playing the game

Quiz Show is a very creepy and haunting portrait of what happens when ordinary Americans become intoxicated by the money and the trappings that pseudo fame can provide and then are forced to come crashing down to earth when they learn that Quiz Show is really a sinister breed of consumerism, capitalism, and corporate greed run by a Goliath known as network television and they were just pawns in a sinister game easily replaced, if they decided not to play the game, subject to personal and financial ruin. The Quiz Show is gripping drama that at its core speaks to human ruin as they become swallowed up by the machine in a very Orwellian 1984 sense.",1451520000,2,1067,4.675531914893617

John Tutturos best work IMO( close is "" O Brother where art thou"" and even rounders) and Ralph Fiennes marginally redeems himself post Schindlers with a stellar performance.

643652,5,6303407161,"Only Robert Redford could direct a historical piece and make it riveting. He took the simplest chapter from Richard Goodwin's ""Remembering America"" and created a fast paced, riveting motion picture about the government investigation of the duplicitous game Shows in the mid to late 1950's in which the Networks and Geritol made millions by feeding the answers to guests Herb Stemple and Charles van Doren.
  The star of this film is Rob Morrow who plays Dick Goodwin. Ralph Fiennes plays van Doren and is expert but it is Morrow who carries the film.
  Typical of Redford's films, the detail is amazing from real footage, and the use of muted colors, gray, white. He doesn't portray 1956 as it was but as we remember it or WISH it was. Cigarettes are everywhere but with the clean affectation of a 1940's Bogart film. The script is smart, taking pure fact and creating excitement. Once again, Redford earned an Oscar nomination following a list of films that began with ""Ordinary People.""

643716,5,6303407161,"With great performances by Ralph Fiennes, John Turturro and others, this film deftly recreates the scandal of the 1950s TV shows ""Twenty-One,"" ""The $64,000 Question"" and others that led to similar investigations of other quiz show fraud. And now for the real $64,000 Question, in three parts: 1) How was Jack Berry able to slither through the investigation only to end of building a TV show empire worth millions when he died? 2) Did Charles Van Doren, the primary and most notorious fall guy in the scandal, in fact never teach again, as the movie's ending stated? 3) Did the entire investigation have any real effect on lying in television? Let me answer part 2 first, if I may. Yes, Mr. Van Doren, after positions as senior editor of Encyclopedia Brittanica and some other relatively obscure intellectual jobs, was able to return to teaching as a full professor in Connecticut. He also went on to write and co-write several books. Now for part 1. Barry and his right-hand man, Dan Enright, the masters behind the puppets, convinced Mr. Van Doren not to cooperate with New York District Attorney and U.S. Congressional investigators while they spilled their guts, thus ensuring immunity and less publicity, and later returned to TV to lead a highly successful and lucrative career. And last but not least, part 3. There is now more lying, deceit and scripting of answers and events in so-called ""reality"" shows than was ever committed in any game show. But maybe that is because, as Mr. Van Doren, a literature major with plenty of knowledge of history, knows well, those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it. And most Americans really don't care if they're lied to, as proven by their habit of re-electing the best liars in politics.",1428019200,6,1752,4.843333333333334

643786,5,6303407161,"Only last year, the 1994 film, Quiz Show, finally came to blu-ray. But, only in Australia. I recently purchased it here in the US via Daaveedee dot com (possibly the only US seller, and they are on Amazon as well as their own site), and am thrilled with this blu-ray of one of my favorite films.

For those unfamiliar with this film, it is not only based on a true story, it hardly departs from the facts at all. It focuses on two of the most famous contestants in the television quiz shows of the late 1950s-- which happened mostly, after a time, to be rigged(!)-- and on the young congressional investigator with a Harvard law degree who met with them and investigated both of them, other contestants, and the quiz show producers. These two contestants were Charles Van Doren and Herb Stempel, and the investigator was a young attorney, later a speech writer for JFK and LBJ, Richard Goodwin (these are their real names, by the way, also used in the film).

As born out by books and a fine 60-minute, 1991 PBS documentary on the subject, ""The American Experience: The Quiz Show Scandal,"" essentially the 1950s quiz shows, often airing on Sunday nights, drew huge TV audiences and market share. Thus the sponsors stayed very close to the production of the shows, and ultimately, some sponsors decided that certain contestants and the games they were in at the moment were ""boring"" or otherwise a turnoff to their valuable TV audiences. So, eventually, they pressured the producers to ""bump"" unpopular contestants. This was achieved initially by asking those contestants questions they knew the contestants couldn't answer (based on entrance exams taken when auditioning to be on the shows), and later, with the full, active participation of the contestants-- by supplying them with the questions and answers well BEFORE the show was taped, and even telling them how to act while mulling over their answers!

Many contestants didn't want to go along with this rigging, a tribute to the values of the time. Several told local district attorneys what was going on, but there was no corroborating evidence. Eventually, some contestants brought forth various forms of proof of the fraud, and such was the case with the biggest, though not the first, such revelation-- concerning the most popular quiz show, Twenty One, on which this film is based.

A big winner on Twenty One for a couple of months, nerdy genius Herb Stempel learned he was to have to ""take a dive"" once the producers informed him that his ratings had begun to decline. He resented having to do so, and even wanted to play the game ""straight up"" henceforth, which he had wanted to do from the beginning, actually; as he was indeed a real-life genius. The producers insisted he MUST lose, and it would be to a young, handsome Columbia University professor from a literary family, Charles Van Doren. Van Doren, too, had wanted to play on the up and up, but was convinced to go along with receiving his questions and answers in advance. Once Stempel was defeated by Van Doren, he became depressed at his sudden loss of fame and celebrity-- and money-- and when certain promises for a TV career after Twenty One were not kept by Twenty One producer Dan Enright, Stempel went to the press, later the Manhattan district attorney, with his story of participating in an outright fraudulent television quiz show. He told a great narrative, but without corroborating evidence.

Eventually, Van Doren, who went on to become the show's biggest winner and who then received a spot on the The Today Show, was implicated, and subsequently compelled to speak with the D.A. and then before Congress. But it took him much time and soul-searching before he came clean. Around this time, the TV quiz shows were collapsing, one after another, as a result of the scandal, and virtually all of them went off the air, plus the producers resigned or were fired, and MANY contestants and others lied before Congress. President Eisenhower spoke to the nation about ""this terrible thing perpetrated on the American people."" Even with their reprisal some years later, the quiz shows never again had the same magnificent aura following the 1950s scandals that took them down, virtually completely.

This film is essentially a character study of the three main players, yet it's not preachy. Producer/director Robert Redford hits a home run with this movie, which earned much critical acclaim if not much money at the box office. It is shot entirely in color, yet of course uses authentic props, such as cars and clothes from the 1950s, and really puts the viewer back in that time. The acting is superb, as is the memorable script, and the cast is top-drawer: Ralph Fiennes plays Van Doran, John Turturro plays Stempel, Rob Morrow is Richard Goodwin, Mira Sorvino is Goodwin's then-wife, Paul Scofield plays Van Doran's father, fellow Columbia professor and Pulitzer-prize-winning poet Mark Van Doran, and David Paymer plays Twenty One producer Dan Enright. Hank Azaria of The Simpsons fame is very believable as Enright's assistant. Even famed film director Martin Scorsese, for some reason, has a role in this film, as a corporate sponsor.

One leaves this film wanting more, and also feeling that he or she has lived a bit in the late 1950s and through the quiz show scandals. It is educational, overcoming a fault I have with so many films that are ""based on real life"" but are thorough fictions. Personally, I really dislike such films because of this falseness, yet most films based on a true story are in fact greatly fictionalized; not so for Quiz Show. It is factually accurate throughout, likely with some minor dialog changes for effect, but little else changed, apart from the compression of perhaps three years' of events into one year. This one's a keeper, and is now a classic to many.

As for the blu ray, oddly only Australia has a blu-ray release of this US film. It's Region A/B/C, thus works fine in my US (Region A) blu-ray player. The few extras on it play fine as well, unlike the extras on some other multi-region blu-rays. The picture quality is excellent-- clearly a remastered, sharp Hi-Def image with just a hint of natural grain, and it is identical in quality to the very pretty Showtime version currently playing on cable TV where I live. The sound is loud and clear, though as to the stereo quality or surround sound quality, I can't comment, as I don't use additional speakers beyond those in my TV set. I have the DVD, and esp. on an HD TV, the picture quality upgrade via the blu-ray is substantial. The extras are brief, but good, including an under-4-minute ""making of"" documentary piece with quick interviews of the lead actors and Redford, plus one or two trailers. I HIGHLY recommend this blu-ray.

Want to see a great TRUE story, with superb acting, direction, and script? Plus learn about a slice of Americana circa 1955-60? Then watch this film. If you have kids, view it with them, they'll like it, too. There is no sex, hardly even a kiss, come to think of it, nor any violence. Just a mesmerizing story . . . my kind of picture!",1419897600,2,7107,4.790375203915171

643843,5,6303407161,"Quiz Show is a historical drama film produced and directed by Robert Redford. It was adapted by Paul Attanasio from Richard Goodwin's memoir Remembering America, the film is based upon the Twenty One quiz show scandal of the 1950s. It stars John Turturro as the reigning quiz show champion,Herbert Stempel and Ralph Fiennes as the controversial contestant,Charles Van Doren.

The story starts when the producers of the quiz show 21 have a problem. Their current champ, Herbert Stempel,who has a phenomenal memory and a broad range of knowledge but who also is a loudmouth with an uncharismatic personality. Then the producers asked Herbert to lose on purpose and allow Charles Van Doren,a handsome and charming college professor,to become the show's new champion. Audiences like Van Doren, and he's certainly not averse to the money he's winning, but the ethics of the situation begin to trouble him, especially when the show's producers begin to give him the questions in advance.

The movie paints a telling portrait about the effects of advertising on producers of TV shows and networks. Aside from that a poignant examination of pop culture, greed, and race relations in American society in the 1950s. It relates changes in the American character and culture as it exposes how men make moral choices. In summary,the movie is an outstanding narrative of corruption of a person's character. Quiz Show delivers in all these things mentioned. Aside from that,it also worth mentioning the Turturro and Fiennes deliver great performances as Stempel and Van Doren respectively. In summary,Redford excels in Quiz Show.",1419638400,,1614,5.227799227799228

643931,5,6303407161,"Millions of television viewers thought they were watching legitimate knowledge competitions, such as ""the $64,000 Question"" and ""21"", in which the contestants were being asked difficult questions supposedly sealed in a vault. What the public didn't know was the producers did not perceive they were broadcasting competitions but rather entertainments. And since the television ratings were the real score, not the scores of the contestants, it made sense to everyone involved to rig the show with preordained outcomes. Not even the eight men of the Chicago White Sox who threw a threw a few games of the World Series in 1919 could literally pre-ordain the precise outcomes of the competitions.

""Quiz Show"", directed by Robert Redford and starring John Tuturro, Ralph Fiennes, and Rob Morrow, begins with a salesmen showing a prospective buyer a new Cadillac. The salesmen expounds upon the design, interior, even the radio. He allows the potential buyer to start the engine. The salesman comes off as both confident and yet trustworthy. Even though once the opening title sequence begins, we never revisit the salesman or the Cadillac, we understand that this is a film having to do with selling something. Then strands of the Threepenny Opera song Mack the Knife intones: Oh the shark has pretty teeth dear, And he shows them pearly white Just a jack-knife has Macheath dear And he keeps it out of sight.

Television and entertainment is a bit like Mack the Knife, pearly white teeth but very sharp and biting.

The television quiz shows in the 1950's were at the mercy of one of their biggest sponsors, Geritol. When the ratings for the quiz show ""21"" begin to stagnate during reigning champion Herbert Stempel's tenure, the sponsors decide they want a new contestant. But Stempel appears to be unbeatable. Then the producers meet little known literary professor Charles Van Doren. Doren appears to exude an uncommon combination of intelligence, knowledge, and amiability. And he's of ""gentile"" extraction, probably Dutch-New England, unlike the Jewish Stempel who probably grew up in Brooklyn. However, it's not enough they want to match Van Doren against Stempel. They want to make sure Stempel loses, so they compel him to flub an easy question, the Best Picture of 1955, ""Marty"". Only problem is, ""Marty"" is one of Stempel's favorite movies, and he knows very well it won Best Picture. The producer, Daniel Enright, replies that that's the beauty of it. It was such an easy question that his faltering will be just that much more dramatic.

In the mean time, Richard Goodwin, fresh out of law school, is working for a US congressman on the Legislative Oversight Subcommittee. He is wondering if the television quiz shows are legitimate, or fudging their own supposed ""rules"". He begins asking questions. He is led to Herbert Stempel and eventually to Charles Van Doren, the recent ""21"" champion. Then he discovers an unexpected piece of the puzzle which verifies, once and for all, whether these shows are rigged.

An incredible film with a first-rate cast. ""Quiz Show"" presents not just the scandal itself, but a slice of American culture in the late 1950's. Although World War II was now over 10 years behind, new challenges were facing America. And the legitimacy of television as the new entertainment medium was becoming the choice for many Americans. The public believed everything they saw, but not everything they saw was real.",1392076800,,3442,5.063492063492063
643932,1,6303407161,"You have been warned.
My issue with this movie orbits around one insignificant detail--because it irks me, it vexes me...thus I must discuss it, as it has bothered me for years.

Though first I will say that, on the whole, the film is rather dull, the one good thing about it is John Turturro who offers a brilliant, vivid performance, I will watch the movie when it's on occasionally simply to listen to him, he's a delight.  Rob Morrow was good in his roll, he can't really be a lead actor, but he shines always in supporting rolls--just my opinion.

As for Ralph--he's not satisfactory in his roll, far too dull, it seemed, too tiring to watch. even to listen to.  Whatever magnificence he had summoned for Schindler's List seems to me never to have been revived again--anyone else feel that way?  Same for Val Kilmer in Real Genius and Tombstone, and Eric Bana in  Munich and Ray Liotta in Goodfellas--you see some kind of...je ne sais quoi, a fascinating allure, a burning, smoldering Something, and then you never see it again--curious.  Again, just my opinion, think what you will.

Now, as for the ""meat"" of my review, what has bothered me--yes for years, is the birthday scene.  Every time I think of this movie, my thoughts go directly to the cake.  Why, you may wonder.  Because the cake is too small.  I detest that cake.  That cake infuriates me.  I say again; it is TOO SMALL.

What does the cake's dimensions signify--perfect people gathering to to eat perfectly?  When perfect rich creatures have cake they receive a thin wedge and eat primly and perfectly and moderately with utmost control?  This is my interpretation.  I don't know about you, but cake means to me--abundance, indulgence, excess, and if it is offered at a party it should be large and plentiful so that guests can eat as much as they desire.  I mean...do you SEE how the patriarch--Charles' father, slices the SMALLEST pieces of cake ever? I have no words for this, it's stunning.

Such a tiny cake for all of those people?  How about he slice even tinier wedges, use a scalpel and a ruler, put some science into it, really shave off a paper thin layer, why dont' you, pal? Or you know, don't even offer a cake of that size- -heavens, no! Just give everyone at the table a single, minuscule petit four--how about that, or go even farther, just have one tiny little petit four for everyone, mouse-sized pieces for all to ""enjoy"".  You know, just don't have a cake at all, how's that?

I'm sorry.  It's a weird review, okay--I freely admit that, but this really must be addressed, so--what can I do?  Yes, the corruption of the controlled media, the lies--not lost on me, I assure you, but the business with the cake stands as one of those heinous and detestable things in life that, well...just also must be exposed.",1392076800,6,2800,4.608080808080808

643935,4,6303407161,"I just had this feeling that `Quiz Show' was going to be a complete bore.  I was holding off watching it for the longest time, and yet settling in to watch it over the past weekend was a complete joy.  Despite running over two hours, the film has such natural flow to it that you can't help but be absorbed in it from scene to scene.

Bravo to Paul Attanasio for his exceptional screenplay.

The film, taking place in the 60's, tells the true story of a young reporter who uncovers a scandal in `quiz show' television when he becomes aware that the winners are being fed the answers to fix the show and garner higher ratings.  When young Jewish `every man' Herbie Stempel plateaus with the show `Twenty-One', the producers convince him to throw the game and elect the young, good looking and financially stable Charles Can Doren as the new winner.  He skyrockets to fame because of his charm and soon becomes the biggest winner the show ever had.  And then the reporters come and the allegations come and the pressure pushes down on him and the producers to save face.

Quickly.

Robert Redford does a great job of pacing his film, giving us just enough to keep us hooked and keep the film flowing, and he manages to splice together different plot points and character arcs with an ease and naturalness.  The cast is also exceptional, with Fiennes charming the pants off the audience and John Turturro delivering a remarkably layered performance as the jilted Herbie Stempel.  It appears that he and Scofield were really neck and neck in the Oscar race (Scofield was nominated for BAFTA and Oscar, while Turturro was nominated for the Globe and SAG) and I really wish that Turturro had prevailed, since he really is the best part of the film.

With snappy dialog, rich production values and an ensemble who sells every note (Paymer and Azaria are a marvelous pair), `Quiz Show' gets so much right I can't help but love it.",1382572800,2,1922,4.604105571847508
643936,5,6303407161,"The film gives a perfectly detailed feeling for the 1950's from the start--cars, soundtrack, costumes, houses, the attitudes of the 50's.  You'll viscerally remember sticking to your grandmother's plastic covered best furniture.  The pacing is fast and never drags.

The cast of the movie is great--Ralph Fiennes (Charles van Doren) is perfect; Rob Morrow (Dick Goodwin, who investigates the wrongdoing) plays off him ideally, and the versatile John Turturro is terrific as the unlikeable but sympathetic Herb Stempel.  Robert Redford is probably a better director than actor, and that's saying  a lot. Martin Scorsese, another idol, also makes brief but scalding appearances.

In any description of the movie you'd be told it's about the quiz show scandals of the 1950's.  On another level, it's about the stigma of being too smart.  When Charles van Doren and Mark Goodwin cast off a small sailboat into a tame lake, Charles remarks, ""Remember when being smart was like being cross-eyed?""

While I was too young to remember much about the quiz show scandals, I do remember the worshipful attitude schoolchildren and teachers had towards the Van Doren family, especially in northwestern CT, where I grew up and they lived.  They were America's first family of poetry.

The forces that ultimately end up destroying those with any integrity in the movie are complex and many.  No good guy wins; might triumphs right.  But the carefully nuanced portrayal of those who are pitched into parting with their values, piece by piece, and end up losing everything is a masterpiece.

For the record, the establishment of higher learning that is portrayed as Columbia U (my alma mater) is actually Fordham University, the Jesuit University of NYC, possibly an even more gorgeous campus, where my daughter attends school.

It opens with Dick Goodwin (Rob Morrow) at a car dealership. He sits in a Chrysler 300 convertible and listens to a news broadcast about the launch of Sputnik.

Robert Redford's QUIZ SHOW is an entertaining film with a solid cast that's only loosely based on the Twenty-One scandal and subsequent 1959 Congressional hearings. For those already familiar with this movie, here's just some of the factual inaccuracies.

But just as happened with the Lumet's film, the Academy saluted the flag and decided to award the golden statue to Forest Gump, a modern fable that as with Rocky had a more optimistic statement and greater acceptance within the general public.

Viewing this film one can not but recall Marshall McLuhan when he stated boldly that the TV is the babysitter of the twentieth century. And the illusion of seeing new talent to win is part of the collective unconscious.

A devastating movie that carves in relief the reality behind the screen. Well written and better acted. John Turturro in the role of his lifetime, the great Paul Scoffield and Ralph Fiennes (one of the ten top actors around the world) further accentuate this overwhelming film.

The movie itself is excellent, albeit quite long.  The cast and screenplay are both on a very high level.  One cannot fail to be moved by Paul Scofield's heart-breaking reaction as his son, Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes) confesses to him that he was also given the answers to the contestant's questions on the Twenty-One program.

The line that stays with me the longest is that of the CEO of the program's sponsor, very well played by Martin Scorsese, to Dick Goodwin (Rob Morrow), the federal investigator:  ""You have to understand that the public has a very short memory,"" he says with a grin.

Contestants can stay on the show for weeks, earning then-astronomical sums of money and becoming household names.  Such was the case for Herbert Stemple (John Turturro), a buck-toothed, blue-collar guy who raked in the money.  Little did the public know that the show was entirely scripted and that Herb was told the answers in advance.  When Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes) a bright, attractive college instructor came on the show, the producers decided it was time for Herb to lose; he did and Van Doren became the biggest thing on television, even making the cover of Time Magazine.  But he and the show were no match for Congressional watchdog Dick Goodwin (Rob Morrow) who exposed the show for the fraud that it was.

I was really surprised at how exciting this movie was. It's got humor and drama and is filled with tension.  Fiennes portrays Van Doren as a witty, charming Connecticut Yankee from an influential family.  We care about him and suffer with him as he prepares to confess his part in the fraud not only to Congress, but to his trusting father.  Turturro's Herbie is a fascinating, naive, greedy man whose life was ruined by the show.  Morrow is excellent as the whistle-blower.

The movie is a wonderful look back at a time when we as a people were so much more trusting and innocent.  This scandal rocked the nation and changed us forever.  This is a great movie.",1288569600,,1481,4.715953307392996
644112,5,6303407161,"If there were a desert island with a DVD player and a TV set -- and power -- this movie would be in my stack of DVD's to carry along. It's one of my five favorite films of all time.

As a screenplay, it's brilliantly done; the performances are letter-perfect; and the evocation of 1950's New York could not be more on the money. I have loved this film since the first time I saw it and re-watched it countless times, marveling each time at how each scene makes its point, reveals its characters and moves on to build a cohesive whole. Simply wonderful.

My only quibble -- and I remember it every time I watch the film -- is in the wrenching and remarkable scene where Charlie finally has to admit to his father, in his Columbia University classroom -- that he did in fact get the answers on 21, along with other contestants. Paul Scofield is one of the best actors ever, with a marvelous and expressive face. Surely that face, reacting to a devastating and wholly unexpected confession from his son, should be shown in a closeup?

But Redford, for some reason, picked the medium shot. And though I am hardly a critic of film editing, it jars me EVERY SINGLE TIME. Why not move in for a closeup of Scofield? Why not let us see his shock and anguish as closely as possible? To me, it detracts from the scene and reminds me of the mechanical process of editing, when I should be deeply caught up in the characters' dilemmas -- Charlie still wanting his father to understand, Mark unable to fathom why his son -- HIS SON! -- would cheat on a QUIZ SHOW ... (And if I ever meet Robert Redford, that's the one question I HAVE to ask him ... )

I can't add anything to what all the other reviewers have said. But I've got my list of desert-island movie material ready, and QUIZ SHOW is on it. So if you happen to know of a desert island with reliable electric power and a DVD/TV set up, get in touch ...",1287014400,,1896,4.272980501392758

The movie may take a few liberties with the actual happenings of the quiz show scandals of the late 50's but it stays close to the facts while telling the story concisely and understandably to those who have little background about the events.  And the film nostalgically and genuinely portrays New York City in the 1950's.

John Turturro is excellent as Herb Stempel a nerdy young Jewish guy from Queens with an encyclopedia like mind and a nagging wife.  Because of certain attributes Turturro gives Stempel I can't help but wonder if Herb would now be diagnosed as someone with Aspberger's Syndrome.  Ralph Fiennes is equally good in his role as the White, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant, Charlie Van Doran, a Columbia University instructor who is the son and nephew of Pulitzer Prize winners.  Not quite as good is Rob Morrow playing Richard Goodwin the young government lawyer who goes after the quiz show cheats. I found Morrow's Brookline accent grating, perhaps because I am more used to hearing him without it on the 90's hit NORTHERN EXPOSURE.  Interestingly enough as of this writing the real  Herb Stempel, Charlie Van Doran and Richard Goodwin are alive and more can be found out about what happened to them by googling their names and finding their Wikipedia entries.  And YouTube even provides some vintage footage of Stempel, Van Doran and game show host Jack Barry on the game show, ""Twenty-one"".

644117,5,6303407161,"Directed by Robert Redford, Quiz Show immediately grabs your attention to the true story of the 1959 quiz show scandal.  The budding television invention began blossoming in the 1950s and the potential money made in advertising gave rise to cutthroat tactics to grab audiences.

Viewers loved the game show TWENTY-ONE and ratings went up with intelligent bright contestants vied for big monetary gifts.  Geritol as sponsor also benefited with increased sales.  Herbert Stempel (John Turturro) a knocked out tooth with unattractive personality and looks was the reigning champion of the show.  He was intelligent and smart, but the big boy network wanted someone more handsome and appealing.

Herbert Stempel was asked to take a dive for Charles Van Doren when ratings began to ""plateau"".  They bribed him and he reluctantly took the fall, though he felt betrayed.  His bitterness grew and he accuses the producers of rigging the show for advertising dollars.

Redford won an Academy Award in his very first stab at directing with 1980's ""Ordinary People"".  Likewise, he was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Director for 1992's magnificent ""A River Runs Through It"" and the 1998 film ""The Horse Whisperer"". While these were all terrific flicks my favorite Robert Redford-directed film always has been 1994's ""Quiz Show"".

Now in the 1950's quiz shows were all the rage on network television.  Shows like ""21"" and ""The $64,000 Question"" drew upwards of 50 million viewers each week.  It is difficult to imagine those kinds of numbers in this day and age where the audience is so fragmented  In any event,  there was enormous pressure on network executives to keep these shows fresh and interesting to the audience.  The networks quickly discovered that one of the best ways to achieve this end was to manipulate the results.  In that way a certain number of these contestants would be sent packing before audiences grew tired of them.  This strategy was quite successful for a number a years before one estranged contestant decided to blow the whistle on all of it.  ""Quiz Show"" recalls in a very compelling way the people and events surrounding this scandal.  This is a film that commands your undivided attention from the outset and simply never lets go!

There are really three principal charactors in ""Quiz Show"".  John Turturro  stars as Herb Stempel,  the thirtysomething Jewish contestant who was the reigning champion on ""21"".  To be kind,  despite winning for several weeks in a row Herb proved to be about as charismatic as a mortician.  The sponser was calling the network demanding that  Herb be ""replaced"".  Enter one Charles Van Doran (played by Ralph Fiennes),  a handsome, highly educated and captivating young man who possessed all of the charactoristics that both the sponser and the network were looking for.  Would he be willing to ""play the game"" and be fed the answers?  At first he resisted but the allure of fame and fortune proved to be too much. In order to make this all happen producer Dan Enright (David Paymer) must convince Stempel to deliberately miss a question.  Stempel is outraged but reluctantly agrees and Van Doran would become the new champion.  In the ensuing weeks the ratings would go through the roof and  Charles Van Doran would become a household name.  Meanwhile, Herb Stempel, who is now nothing more than yesterday's news is seething.  His celebrity is gone and the network has refused to make good on a deal he struck with them to throw that question and end his reign as ""21"" champion.  Totally frustrated, Stempel goes to the authorities and tells all.

It is at this point that Redford introduces us to the third major player in this saga.  Dick Goodwin finished at the top of his class at Harvard Law School.  Although he realized that he was one day destined for big things on Wall Street he decided that he wanted to pursue other avenues first.  He goes to work as an investigator for a Congressional subcommitee and finds the work to be rather mundane.  All of that changes rather dramatically when Goodwin (played by Rob Morrow) begins to suspect there just might be something fishy about some of these TV quiz shows.  Goodwin is a feisty and persistant son-of-a-gun who relentlessly pursues the investigation.  Eventually, he catches up with both Stempel and Van Doren and the whole tangled web slowly and painfully begins to unravel.  All three men are conflicted about their roles in this drama and soon Goodwin discovers that there are forces at the highest levels of both the government and corporate America that are out to discredit him.

Although the film was criticized for taking some ""artistic license"" Robert Redford stands by his portrayal of these historic events.  ""Quiz Show"" features outstanding acting and a terrific script.  In my opinion this  was one of the finest films made in the 1990's.  Very highly recommended!",1245628800,,4032,4.8777614138438885

Every actor is superb in here, from crooked NBC executives to the Stempel and Van Doren families. Veteran actor Paul Scofield plays Van Doren's father ""Mark"" and is a standout in that role.

Fiennes, who insisted in playing ""catch"" and wrestling with `Weng Weng' when not at call, was often at costume designer Kathy O'Rear's wit's end. The costume designer said she had no clue how to get out those kinds of stains from a Giorgio Armani suit. Additionally, several of the cast and crew had to be treated for gorilla related injuries, including, actor Paul Scofield. The most serious incident involved Craft Services manager Michael Demers who suffered a gunshot wound while trying to remove `Weng Weng' from the cafeteria. Fiennes claimed no knowledge of how `Weng Weng' acquired the handgun.
Executive producer Richard Dryfuss had to finally step in and mediate an agreement. It is not known what the outcome was but Weng Weng was never seen again.",1231632000,2,1129,4.885416666666667

Secondly, since there were no laws pertaining to television ethics, nobody went to jail. Indeed,years later, the ""Bobsey Twins""- Jack Barry and Dan Enright were right back at it again making  handsome sums on ""The Joker's Wild"". Additionally, let's not forget that ""21"" was only the tip of the iceberg. Quickly, ""The $64,000 Question"", ""Tic-Tac-Dough""(another Enright,N.B.C. debacle), and ""Dotto"" soon came crashing down, one upon another. Finally, Bob Kittner's remark of television being a great educational tool could easily have become reality had there been a market for it.

644197,4,6303407161,"Quiz Show (Robert Redford, 1994)

The brilliance of Robert Redford's Quiz Show is related, in retrospect, in the film's opening sequence, where Dick Goodwin (Northern Exposure's Rob Morrow) is considering buying a car. The effect of the scene is completely lost the first time you see the film; go back and watch it again once you've got a handle on everything that goes on. That's why Robert Redford is a fantastic director, and Quiz Show is a fantastic film.

Based on the true story of the Twenty-One scandal, Quiz Show opens with Brooklyn geek Herb Stempel (Rounders' John Turturro) as the undisputed king of TV quiz show Twenty-One. The producers of the show are looking for someone to replace him, since the ratings are starting to get stale, and they happen upon Charles van Doren (Ralph Fiennes, recently seen in the Harry Potter movies), literature professor from the bluest blood to be found west of the Atlantic. As van Doren is being prepped for the show, Albert Freedman (Hank Azaria), one of its producers, casually asks how he'd feel about them asking him questions they're aware he already knows the answers to. From there, the movie degenerates into a morass of corruption and conscience unequaled in fiction; like the man said, you just can't make this stuff up.

The movie was pretty much destined for success. Redford was already well-known as an excellent director. Scriptwriter and (uncredited) producer Barry Levinson were at the very beginnings of the rides of their respective lives with Homicide: Life on the Street. The entire cast is full of stars (and a few director cameos); about the least-known name on the list, at the time, was Mira Sorvino, whose big break came the next year. This is a movie that had everything going for it from day one. It still amazes me how often you can say that about a movie that ends up crashing and burning, but Quiz Show is not one of those movies. The acting and script are, of course, exceptional, as is Redford's direction. The pacing is phenomenal, even more impressive given the movies two-hour-plus running time (common in other countries, but almost unheard-of  in America). At least two critics have called it one of the thousand best films ever made (it made both the Guardian list and Peter Travers' list for Rolling Stone), and there is certainly some merit to the claim; this movie is great fun to watch, and as the events get more absurd, the more fun it is. What really puts the cherry on the sundae is that hey, this stuff really happened. ****",1193875200,,2522,4.7643020594965675
644198,5,6303407161,"Its 1957 and the very popular show ""Twenty-One"" attracts the national eyeballs. A patent medicine is the sponsor. Just answer a few questions and you can win a big prize. It seems so easy! Then we see the whims of the top managers affect the show. Herb Stempel is a hero to his neighborhood. The college instructor Charles Van Doren applies to be a contestant. The producers think he has star quality and want him on ""Twenty-One"". They also explain how things work. A new face will perk up interest. The big event comes, and Herb Stempel takes a very dramatic dive. That's show business, folks. Charles Van Doren puts on his act to be the new winner.

The contestant is led through a series of questions. They know what he knows, and what he doesn't, so its easy to promote or demote any contestant. Stempel goes to the NY Grand Jury, NBC soon learns of his secret testimony. Stempel made a poor investment with his winnings and wants more. Lawyer Goodwin noticed the attempt to squelch the Grand Jury presentment. Judge Mitchell Schweitzer upholds this cover-up (wasn't he later involved with some scandal?). Goodwin tracks down contestants (like Woodward and Bernstein). Van Doren basked in his fame. Goodwin asked his opinion about the show. Finally Goodwin talked to Stempel and got his story. [The monetary figures from 50 years ago must be multiplied by 20 for today's values.]

Stempel took a dive because of what he was promised. (He should have known better.) They had the foresight to send him to a therapist so they could question his mental stability! But Goodwin checked the facts. Stempel admitted he got the answers, and Goodwin's investigation continued. When viewing a film of the show he noticed an anomaly in Jack Berry's performance! Then he sees Van Doren take a dive, and lose after 14 weeks. But there is a consolation prize of a $50,000 salary as a cultural advisor. Goodwin confronted Enright with a registered letter, proof of rigging the show.

Goodwin's detective work lead to a Congressional hearing into television. Stempel was a star witness. Can a television network stand to be distrusted? Would print and radio profit from this? The manufacturer of Geritol told how his sales went up 50% when Van Doren was on. Of course they suspected nothing, and admitted to nothing. Could an old college professor really be so naive as to be shocked by paid performances on television? Charles Van Doren showed up to admit to the facts: he was involved in a deception. How unlike his peers in corporations or government! Putting on an act is so common in television, then or now, that no one should be shocked. Just look at the Congressional speeches at the hearings, then or now.

Enright took the blame for everything to spare the corporations. Freedman admitted to rigging the quiz shows: its entertainment. NBC is owned by RCA, Rockefeller companies (they knew nothing). This is the story of a deception by one intellectual who served corporations. How many tens of thousands of intellectuals have deceived the public for corporations without being exposed? This lavish production may not have recovered its costs at the box office. Goodwin later became a speech writer for JFK and wrote a book on this story. John Turturro seems to be ""the man with a 1,000 faces"" for his many acting roles in films.",1184630400,,3325,4.8178633975481615

And yes, the characters were real, many dimensional, and this was nicely portrayed throughout. I highly reccommend this film, well worth seeing many times.",1176681600,,608,5.4787234042553195
644201,5,6303407161,"This has always been one of my favorite movies. I generally have to be ""in the mood"" for a particular film, but I will always sit down and watch this one. It seems strange today in this post-Watergate era to believe it could have been considered scandalous at one time for quiz shows to be rigged. For that matter, today, I doubt many people would be surprised if you told them the Congressional hearings on the quiz shows were rigged. That is the level to which our cynicism has progressed. At any rate, this film excels on many levels. To begin with, the cast and performances are just excellent. Turturro excels as the completely unlikeable walking encyclopedia, Herb Stempel. He so badly wants to be admired and successful, but he is just SO unlikeable he doesn't realize that he IS unlikeable. His long-suffering wife played by Johann Carlo sees Herb's every flaw yet loves him anyway. In this he is truly lucky, but he just doesn't see it. Besides his Jewish heritage, Stempel seems to have cluelessness in common with Robert Morrow's Richard Goodwin. Goodwin's character is center stage throughout this movie, and he is played as an exceedingly complex character. First in his class at Harvard, he has brains but lacks the worldliness to see from the beginning that corporate America's Goliath will never be taken down by his version of David and his sling shot of a subpoena. Long before Big Pharma got so big, the fix was already in.

In this sense, Goodwin is the personification of the wide-eyed idealist. He still believes if you just present the truth to the public the correct outcome is inevitable. Finally you have Ralph Fiennes as Charles Van Dorn, possibly the most tragic figure in all of this. He goes in to try out for one of NBC's quiz shows with the best of intentions, and  ultimately trades his integrity for fame and fortune, although reluctantly at first. Van Dorn at first enjoys the attention and the money, but when Goodwin shows up at his door with a host of questions about the honesty of the quiz shows he seems to reawaken Van Dorn's conscience, and he slowly disintegrates into a pile of nerves who even goes out of his way to avoid the host of admirers he once welcomed. He seems relieved to indict himself before Congress and the nation, but pays a heavy price for his confession. Rounding out the cast is the excellent Paul Scofield as Mark Van Dorn, Charles' father. He is another wide-eyed idealist, and a tall shadow in which Charles has had to dwell until ""21"" comes along. The master stroke in this film is the cameo by Martin Scorsese as Martin Rittenhome, an executive with Geritol, the sponsor of ""21"". His short conversation with Richard Goodwin pretty much lays out the ugly truth of the situation - People do tune in to watch the money, and the same end could be accomplished by merely making the questions easier. He also mentions that the public has a short memory but corporations do not, and is thus confident that the NBC employees who rigged the show will never implicate anyone higher than themselves at any hearing. This fictional composite character is right at every turn, and the dishonored NBC employees even return to TV in the 60's with an even bigger hit - ""The Joker's Wild"" - something that would have never happened if they hadn't been willing to be the fall guys.

In short, I highly recommend this film. You'll probably get something further out of it each time you watch it.",1172880000,,3444,4.661184210526316
644202,5,6303407161,This is the best film of 1994. I rank it slightly ahead of Shawshank Redemption. It deserves a deluxe DVD!!!!!!!,1164672000,2,112,4.65
644203,5,6303407161,"These days nobody seems to care about rigged television shows. After all, the obvious contrivances that networks parade before us year after year result in little more than incredulous shrugs from viewers. A few hours watching daytime talk shows or professional wrestling will expose just how much some people enjoy being fooled for entertainment's sake. On the programming side, behind the camera, far too much remains at stake to let the chips fall where they may. Programs must provide rapid fire entertainment to attract viewers and advertisers and reality rarely delivers the jaw-dropping drama needed to keep audiences transfixed. Creating such tension usually entails some form of premeditation or scripting. Television producers came to this realization very early.

The producers of the very popular quiz show ""Twenty One"", which ran from 1956 to 1958, apparently subscribed to these views. Following its first unchoreographed and uninspired episode, the sponsor communicated its great displeasure to the producers, and the decision was made to rig the show. Following that, contestants essentially became actors who were completely outfitted and rehearsed. Herbert Stempel appeared and won a string of victories that approached $100,000 in winnings. The movie ""Quiz Show"" begins at this point. The show's producers then decided to bring in a more clean cut and ""proper"" contestant to win over the hearts of Americans (not to mention their sponsor), and they found this person in Charles Van Doren. But a defiant Stempel, feeling cheated, moved to expose the show. A government attorney, Rob Morrow, convinced his superiors to allow him to investigate the quiz shows. Eventually the whole issue came before a congressional hearing. Such a scandal seems unlikely today. But the bygone audience for the new, and presumably innocent, medium of television felt betrayed.  The genre of the quiz show was almost obliterated by these scandals.

""Quiz Show"", a dramatization of these scandals, manages to attain a high level of drama without resorting to violence or sex. Pure character development moves the story along. Herb Stempel, played brilliantly by John Turtorro, evolves from a confident but arrogant winner into a bitter and reckless fall guy. As the network continues to make him empty promises (which involve his return to television), his bitterness turns to feelings of vengeance. Charles Van Doren, played by Ralph Fiennes, nonchalantly traipses into the promises of fame and fortune the producers feed him. In the end he confesses and pays a heavy price.

Though ""Quiz Show"" makes for great cinema, it shouldn't be confused for a documentary. The film has come under fire for many historical innaccuracies, and some have accused it of following in the deceptive footsteps of the quiz shows themselves. For one, Dick Goodwin, played by Rob Morrow, did not play a central role in the original investigations as depicted in the film. And the actual timing of the historical events, along with how Herb Stempel lost (he did ""take a dive"" on the question about ""Marty"" but he ultimately lost when Van Doren ""stopped the game"" in the show's second round) gets a little skewed. Not to mention that many of the details behind what occured between the sponsors of ""Twenty One"", portrayed by Martin Scorsese, and the show's producers, is lost to history. So the producers of this film paradoxically found themselves in the same position as the original producers of ""Twenty One"". They needed to make a dramatic film and had to bend the facts here and there to ""make it work"". This dilemma frequently occurs in filmmaking that involves historical dramatization.

Regardless, none of these criticisms detract from the film's raw power. ""Quiz Show"" strives to make a point by fictionalizing certain aspects of fact. Arguably, it is less about the historical events of the quiz show scandals of the 1950s and more about the power of television to deceive.  It also presents a theory about how deceptions get propogated up the ranks, who ultimately takes the fall for them, and the effect such events have on the public. This point gets driven home when Dick Goodwin says ""Television is gonna get us"". He means all of us, the public, not just the characters in the movie. ""Quiz Show"" aims higher than a mere docu-drama of a fifty year old scandal. It tries to make us see the connections between those events and how we experience television in the present tense. Which explains why it doesn't follow the historical facts to the letter. The filmmakers had a bigger picture in mind, and to get that vision across they had to play with the story.

""Quiz Show"" is, in the end, a great movie that invites reflection on a medium that has come to dominate our lives. Not only that, it points out that studio heads have a lot of power, and that human beings in positions of power can succumb to corruption, even in the seemingly innocent medium of television.",1152230400,5,4955,5.050122249388753

If you only want one reason why you shouldn't miss this movie than I would definitely say that you should watch it for the acting.

644247,5,6303407161,"Even though what was shown in the movie would probably not shock anyone today considering that people nowadays are not oblivious to some of the not so positive aspect of how television operates. If in the future some game show or reality contest was exposed to be rigged, it wouln't be as shocking compared to the period of time the movie took place. It's more like ""I told you so"" reaction. OK Im exaggerating but you know what I mean!

Even though the rigging of a game show was the story that drove the whole movie, it also explored the human perspective surrounding that focal point. We get to see the motivations of the people for doing what they did, how each cope with the scandal and how each is going to face the consequences of what he did (or for some lack thereof). The movie wouldn't be as compelling if they failed to incorporate those kinds of complexity in the movie, because otherwise this movie could've been just a move about a rigged game show.

Towards the end of the movie, when Van Doren (the game show champion who at first unwillingly become part of the rigging but eventually become a conscious participant), played perfectly by Ralph Fiennes, decided to confess to the court of his involvement in the scandal, I was worried when all the judges started to praise his honesty and courage for exposing himself, they were two inches into canonizing him into a saint and forget everything he did. Thankfully someone whose reason is not superseded by passion said that honesty doesn't acquit someone from the wrong things he did. Honesty is an admirable virtue but it should not free someone from facing the consequences of his actions. But the sad fact is that it only seems to apply to the small powerless people.

The movie has something to say not just about games shows but the power of television as a whole. But the movie's true greatness lies in the vivid and memorable characters in the movie. This is a modern masterpiece!

644248,5,6303407161,"A movie like Quiz Show is entertaining on so many levels...where to begin.

The opening sequence; I don't know what it is about Bobby Darin singing Mack the Knife and the behind the scenes look at America turning on their TV's, but the opening few minutes pull you into a period of history.

From that sequence the script moves swiftly, the characters are tightly drawn, and the stage is set for a morality play asking viewers about the nature of integrity.

While all acting in this movie is outstanding, the direction almost transcends these solid performances, making the actors look like they are simply doing their job rather than carrying a story.

That said, I really enjoyed Rob Morrow, perhaps for the surprising depth of his acting ability (I didn't know he had it in him). Ralph Fiennes seems like an actor you expect greatness from (and he delivers). Hank Azaria is great. And John Turturo is outstanding.

644249,5,6303407161,"I just saw ""Quiz Show"" last night for the first time. It should have won the 1994 Academy Award for Best Picture instead of that annoying, shallow pap titled ""Forrest Gump."" Not only was the story and acting in ""QS"" much better than in ""FG,"" it also had paid incredible attention to period detail without resorting to cheap FX gimmicks to make its point or advance the plot.

""QS"" is not merely a fascinating period piece of a landmark event in recent US history, but is also very much a ""man's movie""---and I don't mean some shallow, bicep-flexing, explosion-filled ""action film."" What I mean by ""man's movie"" is that ""QS"" does a fine job of showing how men interact with each other at all levels, personally and professionally; accurately and honestly exploring the concepts of competition, status, fame, behavior, friendship and the meaning of personal honor and compassion, when not in the presence of women. The supporting women characters in films like these, although ""once removed"" from the immediate action, interestingly enough, play strong, vital and highly influential roles far beyond their immediate circumstances and respective time periods. The only other film I can recall that does this as well as ""QS"" is the obscure 1956 Rod Serling-scripted ""Patterns.""

To me, Ralph Fiennes as Columbia University luminary Charles van Doren and John Turturro as blue-collar Queens resident Herb Stempel, both contestants on the rigged game show ""Twenty-One,"" were each fascinating male character studies. Stempel was portrayed as envious and disdainful of elite ""WASP"" van Doren and this propelled him to expose the rigged show to the media and the federal government. After van Doren was ruined in front of the House investigating committee, Stempel, experiencing a sudden ""epiphany,"" honestly and sincerely felt compassion for the man he previously despised and envied and indirectly helped discredit.

The van Doren character had lamented that he had, throughout his life had ""risen on the wings of others,"" but in truth he never really had had a chance to stretch his own wings at all. Stempel and van Doren had both been considered frustrated ""second raters,"" so to speak, in their respective worlds. Stempel was very intelligent but a working-class man who, deep down, thought himself a failure. Van Doren, who would have anywhere else been at the top of the mountain, was considered a second-rater within his own stunningly brilliant family. Going on a TV game show had been, for both of them as they saw it, a sort of once-in-a-lifetime chance to quickly and completely break out of their seemingly suffocating existences in the hope of gaining what they thought would have been some real respect (too often confused with transitory and superficial ""fame."") The money they each had won was a nice benefit, but less important then the chance to somehow be truly, as it were, ""somebody,"" completely through their own efforts. However, much like Luigi Pirandello's hapless characters in his ""Six Characters in Search of an Author,"" van Doren and Stempel were in truth mere expedient, rootless simulacra, just passing through on the long wave of television viewer ratings.

Both men, as the scandal played itself out, soon became two of the earliest casualties of what was soon to become the relentless and short-memoried American ""celebrity culture"" which rewards handsomely yet punishes severely and is all too maddeningly fickle, and moreover, can have a deeply suffocating nature of its own. So many of us grab for fame as a cheap substitute for love and respect in a world around us which is even more ""celebrity"" dominated than it was in 1959; the ever-more pervasive and intrusive TV always raising the stakes, subtly and repeatedly telling us that deep down none of us really ""measure up"" to the endless parade of images of the ""beautiful people and places"" it relentlessly transmits, now 24 hours per day all over the planet. Friedrich Hegel had once written that what is reasonable is real. If he had experienced the history of television, and especially the 1959 quiz show scandals, he might have quickly retracted that claim.",1117065600,3,4146,5.074780058651027

""Quiz Show"" on 2/5/05 and re-experience the emotions I felt so many years ago when the scandal erupted. I was in my 20s, very busy raising a family and naive about the television industry.

644251,4,6303407161,"This is an utterly brilliant film, to be sure, worthy of every star or series of stars ever given in cinematic history. Its prelude, alone, is worthy of 5 stars, as are its performances, screenplay, cinematography, and striking use of the song ""Mack the Knife"" -- in two totally different performances.

So why do I only award it 4 stars?

A film of this caliber surely deserves more special features on its DVD release. (?) At the very least, Robert Redford should sit down and record his insights into this masterfully understated, superbly crafted, and exquistitely wrought drama. (?) Those who have seen the film are virtually begging for more, aren't we?

To be completely (and embarrasingly) honest, I only liked the film the first time I saw it, which was in the theatre when I was too young to appreciate its finer points. But I also believe its finer points defy the first viewing, as every subsequent showing of the film has uncovered a new dynamic, a new layer, a new penetrating insight. For one, I marvel at the bookending of the drama by totally different versions of ""Mack the Knife"" -- a song that we associate with the 50's by virtue of the famous Bobby Darrin and Louis Armstrong recorings, but that few know to have been written originally (and far more stringently) in the native German of Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill. The use of the song belies the filmmakers' knowledge of its incendiary message and content -- also the realization that the legendary Darrin recording superficially glosses over the bite of the original lyrics, via a TAME translation. (The story behind this is fascinating, but irrelevant.) Specifically, the opening credits are attended by the familiar, the period, the almost inane version recorded by Bobby Darrin -- but the final credits, with the ceaseless zooming in of the images of the audience, is accompanied by Lyle Lovett's far more knowing rendition: sinister, cynical and bitter.

And dare I mention the engrossing but mysterious first scene? A scene that has (at a glance) virtually nothing whatsoever to do with the plot of the film? Mira Sorvino mentions in passing that Rob Morrow has been car-shopping at a point; that is the only reference (albeit oblique) to the opening scene in the main body of the film. And yet: its exquisite disection of the 1950's in America, and the hopes, fears, insecurities, and aspirations that attended it, is shocking. Watch as the camera carresses the rampant materialism and nearly seduces the car for us. Watch as the salesman (in this film about sales pitches) never loses a beat. Watch as the carpet is pulled out from under us: Sputnik flies over, the USSR beats us into space, the camera loses control. For the first time, it shows us the *entire* field of view, rather than a coquettish close-up. It loses focus on the objective: to sell. But Mr. slick salesman doesn't: he doesn't lose a beat in tying the calamity into his pitch. This is the kind of filmmaking that all of Hollywood should aspire to. And I defy any thinking, conscientious person to watch the entire movie and return to the opening scene without seeing it as a kind of overture to the film, reducing its themes and intentions into a brief and enticing summary.

And again, I wonder: why doesn't a dumbfounding masterpiece like this not merit more in the way of commentary?

644252,5,6303407161,"""The $64,000 Challenge.""  ""Twenty One.""  ""Tic Tac Dough.""  In the 1950s, America was in love with television game shows.  But, little did the public know that things were not well at the television networks.  Many game shows were rigged, contestants cheated, and integrity was given up for money and higher ratings.  ""Quiz Show,"" the 1994 movie directed by Robert Redford, takes a painful and memorable look at the television game show scandals of 1958.

""Quiz Show"" is based off the true story of Richard Goodwin, the lawyer who uncovered the scandal of the popular NBC quiz show ""Twenty One.""  When ratings begin to fall of the show, David Paymer, playing ""Twenty One"" producer Dan Enwright, blames the geeky long-standing champion Herb Stempel, comically played by John Turturro, for the show's troubles.

Enwright recruits another contestant, a handsome, refined college professor named Charles Van Doren (played by Ralph Fiennes), whom he feels will gain public approval and help ratings.  To ensure that Van Doren stays on television, Enwright insists that Van Doren receive the answers to questions asked on the show in advance.

Once Van Doren arrives on ""Twenty One,"" ratings climb and Van Doren becomes a hero to millions of fans across the nation (not to mention the infatuation of thousands of young girls).

When the outraged Stempel goes to court and declares that the ""Twenty One"" was fixed, Richard Goodwin, a young lawyer from Washington, is intrigued by the case and decides to probe further.  Thus, a national scandal is born.

The development of the characters in ""Quiz Show"" are compelling, particularly that of Charles Van Doren.  First, Fiennes portrays Van Doren as an honorable man with values - he initially questions the ethics of being given answers to questions.  Then, Van Doren is cast as a man who knew that he was breaking rules but was enjoying himself too much to care.  Finally, the audience begins to feel Van Doren's pain when he finally confesses to the world of his wrongdoings.

Van Doren's anguish can be felt in a scene with his father, Mark Van Doren, a distinguished poet played by Paul Scofield.  In this scene, Charles questions his morals and desperately needs guidance, but cannot bring himself to disappoint his father by telling him what he has done.  Fiennes is able to radiate these struggling emotions without saying a word.

Scofield also gave an amazing performance as Mark Van Doren. In a later scene when he hears of Charles's predicament, his sorrow can be seen in his face.  When Charles tries to assure his father that this will not damage his reputation, the elder Van Doren expresses his disappointment and pain all in one, sorrowful sentence:  ""Your name is mine.""

Robert Redford did an amazing job on ""Quiz Show"".  His recreation of the 1950s was complete and believable.  The beginning scenes of people glued to their television sets helped to show how obsessed America was with television.  The jazz music by Mark Isham helped to further recreate the atmosphere of the time period.

One flaw in this movie, however, was that of Rob Morrow's portrayal of Richard Goodwin.  His faked Boston accent was annoying at best.  His character also was overdone, perhaps because the movie was based off a book by Richard Goodwin himself.  The movie should have focused on other characters, such as the NBC producers.

The 1958 ""Twenty One"" case questioned the ethics of the television show business. Robert Redford created an unforgettable movie by presenting a painful yet compassionate perspective of the people involved in this scandal.  This can be seen in a noteworthy line from Charles Van Doren when he testified at court:

""I've stood on the shoulders of life and I've never gotten down into the dirt to build, to erect a foundation of my own. I've flown too high on borrowed wings...""",1099958400,5,3850,4.954758190327613
644321,5,6303407161,"The first era of prime-time television programming was the Vaudeo Era, which was defined by shows like ""The Texaco Star Theater"" with Milton Berle, ""Your Show of Shows"" with Sid Caesar, and ""I Love Lucy.""  However, during the Fifties television underwent monumental changes in terms of how shows were produced.  There are two specific programs that represent the major changes.  One is ""Dragnet,"" which was the first successful series that was filmed in Hollywood and represented the shift away from live television broadcast from New York.  The other is the CBS game show ""Dotto,"" which was the first such show to be exposed as being rigged in 1958.  It was not as successful as ""The $64,000 Question,"" which was apparently run cleanly, or as infamous as ""Twenty-One,"" which is the basis for the 1994 film ""Quiz Show,"" but it was first.  Because the quiz show scandal was driven by the greed of corporate sponsors, networks then began the practice of selling advertising time.  No longer would a sponsor, such as Geritol, be able to decide what programs would go on the air.
However, Robert Redford's film is not really about the massive changes in the business of television that resulted from the quiz show scandals.  The final word in this film is given to Dan Enright (David Paymer), the producer of ""Twenty-One,"" who insists that because the show was entertainment and everybody made money, there was nothing wrong with giving contestants the answers and rigging the game.  The point of this film is the human wreckage left behind by the scandal in terms of the two ""Twenty-One"" contestants at the center of the storm.  Herbie Stempel (John Turturro) and Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes) are polar opposites in terms of looks and religion but what they have in common is a vast knowledge of what can be called facts or trivia depending on your point of view.  As Van Doren's father observes, if you are going to ask a question worth $64,000 it should be about the meaning of life.
Stempel is the reigning champion on ""Twenty-One,"" but the show's sponsor (Martin Scorsese) has grown tired of Stempel's looks and grating personality.  So the producers order him to take a dive and in a calculated move that backfires on them insist that Stempel blow an easy question on what film won the Oscar for best picture in 1955.  Enright thinks that for 70 grand Stempel can be humiliated, but the producer grossly underestimates the importance of a reputation for being a smart guy has to someone like Stempel.  The producers also think they have the perfect replacement for Stempel in Van Doren, the son of a famous American intellectual family.  They offer to feed him the answers to ensure victory, but when Van Doren refuses they go ahead and find a slightly different way of producing the same results.  Van Doren blinks, but takes the money, and sales for Geritol go up fifty percent.
Between these two is Dick Goodwin (Rob Morrow), a young lawyer who works for the Senate committee with oversight responsibilities on television.  Goodwin is Jewish like Stempel but also Ivy League like Van Doren, and while he is pursuing the truth regarding how ""Twenty-One"" is run he is also attracted to the life lived by Van Doren, who exchanges Shakespeare quotations with his poet father Mark (Paul Schofield) over a family lunch.  The great irony of the script by Paul Attanasion, based on Goodwin's book ""Remembering America: A Voice from the Sixties,"" is that Stempel wants to get ""Twenty-One"" and Goodwin wants to get television, and while neither wants to do it with Van Doren, that becomes unavoidable.  Not that any of these three men comes close to getting what they want out of this experience.
It is impossible not to consider ""Quiz Show"" to be a morality play, but as such it is a rather disheartening one since nobody gets what they deserve at the end of this one.  But Redford sees the quiz show scandals as being a point in American history that ended a period of innocence.  After this point Americans could not longer believe what they saw on television as being the truth and Redford, who did star in ""All the President's Men,"" sees it as the first in a series of violations of the public trust that extend through Vietnam, Watergate and beyond.  But the performances by Turturro and Finnes are so compelling that they keep this film grounded on the personal level, so that the larger social issues are lost in the personal wreckage of Stempel and Van Doren's lives.  Enright claims that nobody lost with these quiz shows, but that is obviously not the case.
My only complaint about this film is that it really does not do a good job of capturing the excitement of such shows.  Stempel and Van Doren played each other four times before Van Doren became the new champion.  Van Doren also played Vivienne Nearing three times to a tie before losing (and had beaten her husband Victor earlier that year).  I do not think we get a sense of the drama or the addictive nature of the game.  Fortunately, it was only a few years after this film that game shows made it back to prime time with ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?""  With that show we could really appreciate what it was like for the country to be riveted by a game show.  Ironically, ""Twenty-One"" was brought back, but it did not catch on.",1082160000,5,5301,4.712892741061755
644322,5,6303407161,"Directed by Robert Redford and nominated for several Academy Awards, this 1994 film tells the true story of the quiz show ""21"" in the 1950s and how the contestants were given the answers ahead of time and coached for the show.  As a child at the time I remember the hoopla and how whole families would watch this show together, holding their collective breaths during the competitions for big money.  It was a time of innocence and the viewing community was deceived.  And never again have the networks won that kind of public trust.

Paul Attansio adapted the screenplay from the book written by Richard N. Goodwin who was the government investigator at the time.  In the film this role is played by Rob Morrow who is determined to uncover the deception.  All the other actors are excellent too - most notably John Turturro who is cast as a Jewish man from Queens who is allowed to win for seven weeks before being replaced by Charles Van Doran, a professor at Columbia who came from a long line of scholars.  Paul Scofield also shines in the role of Van Doran's father, who stands by his son even though the family is disgraced by the publicity.

It's not just the quiz show phenomenon that comes alive in this film.  It is the nature of the times as well as the anti-Semitic undercurrent and cultural conflict that was endemic.  Usually, when I see a film about the fifties, it looks like someone's imagination of what those times were like.  But this film was different.  I really felt I was right back there, many years before computers or even color television, sitting wide-eyed in front of that black and white set and admiring the contestants for being so smart.  Times have changed.  Now, we know we're being manipulated.  And there is no outrage.

I was unprepared to love this film so much.  There is tension throughout and consistently wonderful acting.  The dialog was authentic and the actors all played their roles with subtlety.  They became the characters in the film and I wound up caring about all of them.  ""Quiz Show"" is a simply wonderful film and I give it one of my highest recommendations.  Don't miss it.",1080691200,33,2131,4.629333333333333
644323,5,6303407161,"The answer to that question, is a resounding ""yes"". The fact is that ""Quiz Show"" is, to my mind, one of the finest depictions of the television industry, 50's America, and morality (in a -somewhat- modern world) around. The stellar cast, led by Ralph Fiennes and Rob Morrow, turn in excellent performances - so much so that you wish each character could have more dialogue (the movie has a fairly substantial running time, but I have never felt it). The veritable Paul Scofield, a paragon of integrity, shines in his role as the patriarch and intellectual role model of the Van Doren family. The scenes between him and Fiennes are notable for how much is communicated without actually being said. Meanwhile, Rob Morrow (whose accent occasionally descends into farce) is excellent in his role as a tenacious investigator.
  All in all, an excellent movie, and a testament to Redford's ability.",1058832000,,892,4.94
644324,5,6303407161,"How many times have you seen this disclaimer at the end credits: ""The story depicted in this motion picture is based on actual events. However, certain characters and incidents were added for dramatic effect.""
What the filmmakers are telling us here, folks, is that without these added elements, the movie would be downright boring. See, if we tell it like it is, we won't make money.
Director Robert Redford and screenplay writer Paul Attanasio would have none of that. They chose to chronicle the events leading up to the quiz show scandal of the late 1950s without the embellishments that have become so much a part of Hollywood tradition. For that alone, they deserve the highest praises. But what makes Quiz Show a cinematic marvel is its ability to keep the viewer involved while remaining unerringly faithful to the facts.
John Turturro and Ralph Fiennes turn in career performances as contestants who at first benefit from, but later become victims of a system that dictates that ratings are more important than moral integrity. Turturro plays Herb Stempel, the annoying Jew who at first makes for an appealing underdog but soon wears out his welcome, and so has to take a ""dive."" Fiennes is Charles Van Doren, the handsome, clean-cut Ivy Leaguer who is seen as the worthy replacement and goes along with the deception, only to soon find himself in over his head but unable to just walk away.
Equally impressive is the supporting cast: Rob Morrow as Congressional investigator Richard Goodwin, Hank Azaria and David Paymer as the quiz show's manipulative producers, and Paul Scofield as Van Doren's ever-supportive but unaware father. Also exceptional, but easy to overlook in the glow of the all-star cast, are Johann Carlo as the unsophisticated, non-intellectual but nonetheless faithful Mrs. Stempel; Martin Scorsese as the less-than-honorable profit-motivated sponsor; and Mira Sorvino as Goodwin's devoted, if rather outspoken wife. All turn in tour-de-force performances so essential to bringing the brilliant screenplay to life.
The result: a morality play that is at once gripping and entertaining. A taut drama where tension runs thick in virtually every segment, intensifying as the movie progresses, and culminating in the unforgettable scene where Van Doren has to face the Congressional committee.
It is only fitting that a movie whose theme is integrity is approached with such uncompromising honesty, and for that we should all be thankful. For once, filmmakers actually stood by the belief that this was more important than making the proverbial quick buck.",1057276800,13,2582,5.209134615384615

644326,5,6303407161,"I confess, I collect pithy lines from films for later use (though, striving to be a person of honour, I try to cite my source as well). Three lines stick in my mind from this film. The first, cited in the title, is from Charles Van Doren's father (played beautifully by veteran actor Paul Scofield), commenting on the prospect of people cheating on the Quiz Show. The second comes from a comment made with regard to Herb Stempel appearing on television: 'Now there's a face for radio.' The third is when Van Doren is contemplating the ethics of his situation, and remarks: 'I'm just trying to imagine what Kant would make of this.'
The movie 'Quiz Show' is based upon the true story of 21 and the scandals surrounding a fix in the questions and answers to facilitate ratings. The show 21 has only recently made it back to television.
21 was a highly rated NBC programme sponsored by Geritol (back in the days when usually one sponsor carried a show and became identified with it in the minds of the public). The producer, host, and other workers played with the audience by making sure that popular contestants returned, and unpopular ones lost, by rigging the questions. Herb Stempel (played by Tuturro) had a several-month run when it was decided that his popularity had reached a plateau, and a new face was needed. Entering the scene was Charles Van Doren (played by Ralph Fiennes), who in the excitement of fame and money succumbed to the temptation of being given the answers, too.
Eventually the government got involved in investigating a fraud (Rob Morrow as Dick Godwin, the investigator, is excellent) related to the show (big play was made about the absolute secrecy of the questions before hand) -- television was not quite in its infancy but was still in its childhood and the public perception was one of trust. When it was revealed that not only was 21 rigged, but that Van Doren had been part of this, the backlash was tremendous, but short-lived.
The production team including the host eventually made it back to television, and indeed Herb Stempel even made a television commercial recently as a parody of himself playing a contestant on a quiz show who had just been given the answer.
But for Van Doren, whose family was noted for academic achievement, the blow was long-lived, and he was never able to establish a career as an academic again. He did go on to author several books, including one of which I use in reading circles and teaching (The History of Knowledge).
What makes the story so remarkable is that most of the people participating were very intelligent. Stempel was a whiz kid at trivia and factual knowledge; Van Doren had a very broad education covering arts and humanities and the natural sciences. If anyone didn't need the help to win, it was these people.
Martin Scorsese has a cameo in which he gives the investigator the very real and somewhat painful truth--people ultimately don't care about the knowledge or education or even the honesty of the shows, they just tune in to watch the money. And in fact, that is what has happened with shows today--the recent insurance investigation of Who Wants to be a Millionaire?, given claims that the questions are too easy and payouts too large, brings this movie back to mind as the 'anything for ratings' mentality still thrives.
A glimpse into a more innocent time that wasn't so innocent after all, this movie works on multiple layers. Now, as I'd like to be on a show myself, does anyone have that Millionaire telephone number?",1056844800,4,3517,4.738988580750408
644327,5,6303407161,"The movie starts out with one of the main characters poised in a 1957 brand new Chysler as a car salesman schmoozes the man into believing things that he really wants to believe, but taken out of context, are simply untrue. This scene completely and surprisingly sets up the brilliance of the following two hours of cinema, called ""Quiz Show"".
America's fascination with the sale of happiness is told through the lens of the infamous 1950's ""Twenty One"" quiz show scandal. It tells the tale of one Herb Stempel, an ex-GI who's intelligent if not terribly charismatic.  His smarts got him to stay on the show, but soon you see the machinations of money hungry corporations calling the shots behind the screens. Herb needs to go because his mug isn't pretty.
Enter Charles Van Doren, family family and good looks to boot, who becomes the new darling of Twenty One. But first, he needs to beat out Herb hiimself, who takes a fall in hopes of preserving any hopes of an imaginary television career. Stempel's fifteen minutes are up, and he spends the rest of the movie trying in vain to get them back, or at least ensure no one else does.
The movie moves on with the investgation of Dick Goodwin, driven by passion for justice and a quest to find the truth. He chases that lucrative beast throughout the movie in hopes of pinning it down.  The brilliance of Van Doren manuvers him around it constantly, while the anger of Stempel is almost too raw to be believable.
What could have been a mere retelling of the scandal, which in and of itself is an interesting story. But this film aims higher, much, much higher, and the results are simply impressive. We in America want happiness, and we are willing to purchase it for any price. The fact that Van Doren was fed answers to his questions simply didn't matter; the public loved him, the sponsors loved him, and all were happy to buy into that illusion. The illusion of happiness, so wonderfully ridiculed almost in the final credits as the audience is shown rollicking and screaming at the results of a television show.
All performances in this movie are grand, from John Turturro's manic Stempel to Ralph Fiennes slick Van Doren, even Scorese as the slimy sponsor. Under Redford's smooth, stylistic direction, this film is a tribute to the late fifties as much as it is an expose.
This is one of those films that should be on more people's top ten lists. It instructs without being preachy, and fully showcases the strength that cinema can carry. A great movie, overall.",1054252800,10,2517,4.666666666666667

The bad guys are maybe too bold about their predictions of the future, because Redford knows the future already, but otherwise the movie flows nicely with the main characters facing all sorts of moral dilemmas, and answering them as they come along.
The problem with the DVD is that is has nothing special to offer.  It has no commentary or making-of segment, and not even one of those documentaries on the real scandals.  You can pick it up cheap now or wait until somebody releases a special edition of this fine movie.",1044230400,3,709,4.4728682170542635
644329,5,6303407161,"Quiz Show is a remarkably good film, presenting in vivid detail an important if disillusioning piece of Americana.  I understand the events as presented here are quite accurate to the truth of the actual events, but the film is so gripping and so full of implications about the America that was and was yet to be that it has the appearance of a brilliant screen play made exclusively for Hollywood.  Honesty, integrity, greed (both personal and corporate), betrayal, politics, discrimination, disillusionment-this movie is filled to the brim with these themes and many more besides.  The story is rather simple.  Long-running Twenty-one champion Herb Sempel is a contemporary version of Everyman, winning the acclaim he has sought his whole life only to lose it when America begins growing tired of this Jewish underdog (and I mention he was Jewish only because that fact does have some bearings in the story).  With ratings slipping, producer Don Enright compels him to take a dive so that he can be replaced by the charming, good-looking, academic, viewer magnet Charles Van Doren.  Van Doren, with a lot of help from the producers, goes on a record-breaking run as champion while NBC's viewership rises sharply and the sponsor's sales increase 50%.  Humiliated that he was forced to purposely miss an easy question and furious that his expectations to land a spot elsewhere on television go unfulfilled by the network, Sendel cries foul to a grand jury.  The story is quickly hushed up behind courtroom doors, but then an upstart Washington lawyer working for a Congressional oversight subcommittee hears word of the rumors and sets out to ferret out the truth.
The acting in this movie is top-notch indeed.  John Turturro is wonderful as Herb Sempel, David Paymer and Hank Azaria are convincingly slimy and fast-talking as producers Albert Freedman and Dan Enright, and remarkably talented supporting players such as Paul Scofield and Martin Scorsese make this movie something special, but it is the performance of Rob Morrow in the role of lawyer Dick Goodwin and Ralph Phiennes as Charles Van Doren that really steal the show.  (As an aside, look for Ally McBeal's Calista Flockhart in a cameo role as a young coed mooning over her suddenly famous instructor.)  These are some complex characters: Sempel is a somewhat paranoid man obsessed with the fame that was taken away from him yet not without secrets himself, but Van Doren is exceedingly hard to read.  Oftentimes seemingly ashamed of the fraud he knows he is committing, he allows himself to rationalize his situation, buying into notions that he is doing the right thing by inspiring youngsters to study harder and bringing entertainment to the masses.  Beneath all of his motivations lies a seemingly innate need to make his Pulitzer-winning father proud of him and to step out from the shadows of the Van Doren name he secured by birthright alone.  I must admit that the lawyer's motivations are somewhat inscrutable to me.  Fired up over the chance to ""nail television,"" he is reluctant to implicate everyone despite his zeal for bringing the fraud to light; in the end, it's hard to really say what his most basic motivations are.  Any ambiguity I feel over Goodwin's motives is dwarfed by the magnificence of the movie as a whole, however.  Clocking in at over two hours, there is not a slow spot to be found anywhere; each scene is dripping with tension and drama.  Its subtleties make for great rewatchability, as everything that takes place is important, even though it may not seem so at the time.  Van Doren in particular is a marvelous character study in this amazing cinematic morality play.
Having appeared on a game show myself, I thought I might be able to offer a unique perspective on this movie, but its lessons are undeniably universal.  I can say that the legacy of this scandal remains vibrant indeed in our own time-I and my fellow contestants were not allowed to bring anything with us to the studio, we were not permitted to go anywhere (including the bathroom) alone all day, and we had to search the faces of the audience in front of us to make sure that no one we knew was in our field of vision.  Anyone watching this movie should answer the question that Goodwin answered for himself: if you had been in Van Doren's place, placed under extreme pressure, knowing the eyes of millions would be studying your every move, would you have been a party to a fraud promising you fabulous riches?  Beyond providing over two hours of gripping entertainment, this movie compels you to learn something about yourself, and that is one of many reasons why Quiz Show is a certifiably five-star movie.",1042675200,8,4679,4.8813131313131315
644370,5,6303407161,"This is a great film on so many levels...dialogue, performances, cinematography, editing...all supporting the central metaphor of the quiz show scandals as a watershed event, marking the loss of innocence and shattering societal changes that began in the 1950s and are still playing out today.
Along the way, many subtle symbols are interjected which support this thesis, and it is these elements that raise the movie to the same level as some of the best films ever made.
Here's my favotite example; one that most people probably didn't notice:  In the opening credits, we hear the bouncy 1950s hit-single version of ""Mack the Knife"".  Then, over the closing credits we hear the much darker 1970s version of the same song (which is actually a truer translation of the Weill ""Threepenny Opera"" classic). Thus, these two ""bookends"" symbolize the loss of innocence and change of mood that take place during the course of the film's events.

Unlike the gracious old Van Doren and the ethical young Goodwin, Charles Van Doren, the young Wasp intellectual, Stempel, the Jewish self-taught proficient,and the relatively new medium, television itself, represent the unbeatable wave of a debased future.

There are many, many reasons this movie succeeds so marvelously, but I would like to focus on three.
First, this movie benefits from an exceedingly fine cast. Not merely the leads, but many of the lesser roles are filled with extremely good actors and actresses. While Ralph Fiennes, John Tuturro, and Rob Morrow all shine in the leads, lesser parts are filled with people like David Paymer, Hank Azaria, Mira Sorvino, and Martin Scorsese. I was especially impressed by the always superb but underutilized Paul Scofield (who won the Oscar portraying Thomas More in A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS). He seems the very embodiment of the man of reason, erudition, and courtesy portraying Mark van Doren, and his pain upon learning his beloved son has lost his teaching position at Columbia is one of the great poignant moments in the film. Look very carefully at the scene where several attractive coeds interrupt Ralph Fiennes and Rob Morrow and you will spot Calista Flockhart (a.k.a. Ally McBeal).
A second reason this film succeeds so well is its tremendous period feel. The movie looks and feels like the late 1950s at every second. QUIZ SHOW does a great job of [pulling] you in and giving you an almost tangible sense of time and place.
Finally, the movie is easily one of the most accurate historical films I have ever seen, although drama is never sacrificed for the mere sake of being accurate. If one has done any reading about the scandals or perhaps if one remembers the events, the film constantly impresses with the amount of accurate detail it contains. Too often when watching a movie dealing with historical events, one can become irritated of the events are inaccurately portrayed. For instance, although LAWRENCE OF ARABIA is a truly great movie, Peter O'Toole was nearly a foot taller than the real T. E. Lawrence, which is a huge problem, since Lawrence's self-consciousness about his short stature was a major factor in his self-image. There are no such moments such as this in QUIZ SHOW.

Ralph Fiennes, John Turturro and, of course, Paul Schofield are three of the very finest actors working today and each is up to his best here. Another performer who has been very good whenever I've seen him, but who seems to be highly underrated, is David Paymer who also brings a subdued intensity to his role as the producer at the center of things.

Paul Scofield gives his usual superb performance as Van Doren's father, the noted poet Mark Van Doren.  David Paymer is perfectly slimy as Twenty-One's producer Dan Enright and Chris McDonald plays Twenty-One's host Jack Barry with the right touch of mock importance.  Mira Sorvino has a small part as Goodwin's wife and Martin Scorcese has a cameo as the head of Geritol who was the show's sponsor.  Mr. Redford expertly weaves the lives of Van Doren, Stempel & Goodwin together and we are taken from the highest of highs to the low of lows.  The movie is meant to show that prior to the scandal, America was a more trusting place, we accepted things at face value, but after the scandal, we started to become skeptical and question everything.  In many ways, Mr. Redford is dead on with that assessment.",980985600,8,1635,4.8

This really is an entertaining adaptation of a real life quiz show scandal, it's smartly executed by a well put together cast. It is a true miscarriage of justice that this film had limited release in 1994 and became a box office bomb which didn't make enough money back from what was put into it. I still consider this a cult classic and I am grateful I rediscovered it not long ago. So worth it!",1518480000,,515,4.319587628865979

Hot Toasty Rag, September 26, 2017

Those of you who remember The Joker is Wild or other similar quiz shows in the 1950s and 1960s on television will be transported back in time during the film Quiz Show. Those of you who are a little younger will think Quiz Show is a very fascinating and creative film. But to my fellow younguns, let me tell you this: its a true story.

This piece of social commentary thats sometimes hard to watch but has fantastic acting, well framed shots, and great scene transitions is directed by none other than Robert Redford, the master of all elements mentioned. Quiz Show really is an important movie even though its the poster-child for the people are mean mentality. It was nominated for Best Picture, Director, and Supporting Actor at the Oscars, but John Turturros and Ralph Fienness performances went unrecognized. But, it was released in 1994, the same year as Forrest Gump and The Shawshank Redemption, so it didn't really stand a chance during awards season.

In the film, Christopher McDonald is the host of the incredibly popular television quiz show 21. David Paymer and Hank Azaria are the shows producers. Martin Scorsese is an executive to the shows product sponsor. Everyone has a stake in the ratings, so when successful contestant John Turturro wanes in audience popularity, the network asks him to take a dive. Will he do it? Will he tell the truth that the show is being riggedand, more importantly, will anyone listen?

While I kept asking myself, Why wasn't this Timothy Hutton? every time Rob Morrow was on the screen, the other leads gave excellent performances, most of them more likable in this movie than in any of their other movies Id seen. I was kept on the edge of my seat the entire time, and each time a new characters plight was introduced, my heart completely transferred its sympathy to him, a testament to Paul Attanasios fast-paced and well-defined script. Every character was made to be both likable and unlikable; this is the type of movie that will make you talk about it afterwards.",1506384000,,2075,4.77158774373259
