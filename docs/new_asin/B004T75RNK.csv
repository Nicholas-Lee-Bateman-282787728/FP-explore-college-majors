4465323,1,B004T75RNK,"Wow! I started watching this about a 1/3rd of the way through. I won't even bother wasting my time to see the beginning as the middle and end are sooooo bad! As the poster wrote on another site: ""....afraid of the obvious truth that is conveyed. Dams are extremely bad..."", really?? I grew up around a dam in Washington. Let me tell you, if it held back ALL of the water like the one in the film does, it would soon overflow and be destroyed. How do you think hydroelectric power is generated?? by water flowing THROUGH the dam! I was impressed by the animation. Although I kept telling myself that they should have spent less on the animation, and more on better writers. The hatred towards all humans is evident, even by the humans! The 2011 United Nations Climate Change Conference was the 17th session, however, in the movie, there's a line from a reporter with something like: ""At this 167th conference on Global Warming, it looks like like the animals are taking humans to task for what we have done..."". WOW! Can you feel the hate! in the movie, do they meet every week for the conference to get that high of a conference number? And did I mention all the animals traveled to NY in the belly of several whales?
It makes my brain hurt to think about how very bad this movie is.
As for the ending: with the little girl happy about her father's career ruined, I want to see them in 10-15 years when they are begging in the streets, or their bleached bones are drying on the African plain!",1350604800,5,1492,4.409420289855072
4465324,5,B004T75RNK,"Loved this movie. Just watched it on Netflix! I love the funny animal characters in it and the take back our world attitude. Stupid humans killing anything that moves, not to mention destroying whatever they can and being greedy about every little thing on the planet. I just loved that they made a real world problem into a cartoon with some really quirky and funny animals!

4465325,1,B004T75RNK,"A disgusting abuse of decent animation to bash humans for destroying the planet. Don't be fooled into thinking this is a movie you should see. It is pure garbage, and is especially unfit for young children, whom I think it would scare to death. The animation could have been used in a way to convey the importance of being good stewards of the environment. Instead it is a very negative message.",1348185600,4,395,4.577464788732394
4465326,5,B004T75RNK,"Over all, Animals United is a funny and interesting animation. My only criticism is sometimes the music doesn't relate to or carry the story forwards. All-in-all though, Animals United is a great family movie for all age groups, if you liked Lion King. Madagascar, Alpha and Omega, The Wild and Over The Hedge then you'll love this movie.",1344643200,2,338,4.844827586206897
4465327,3,B004T75RNK,"Seriously, if you are offended by the idea that the environment is being polluted and manipulated by people, avoid this film. Animals United is nothing more or less than another mediocre animated film with high aspirations.

The good: Bits of satire and a few characters that work well.  The film has a good score, and achieves some dramatic and fun moments as well as a few visually impressive scenes. Probably will keep your kids entertained.  But not you.

The bad: Disjointed plot tries to preach a bit too much.  The English dub probably destroys what humor and wit there once was in the film. The voices often seem at odds with the character's expressions and movements, and like most European kid's movies, no option for watching it in the original language with subtitles is offered. Many stereotypical characters. Like way too many kid movies, it tries to surf on tried-and-true character and situation themes, leaving you with a sense of dja vu.

The Story.
A group of animals have lost their homes.  A polar bear was displaced due to the ice floes melting, a pair of ancient Galapagos tortoises find their island slimed by an oil spill, a very French rooster escapes from a sadistic chef, and a kangaroo and flatulent Tasmanian devil must leave Australia because...um...motorcyclists burned the desert (I think.)

They end up in Africa later, where they meet the hero of the story (and thereafter become mostly irrelevant.)

The hero is a typical character--a meerkat who is kind of a screwball and slacker, and whose son thinks he's a loser. (Whopping clich #1)  His best friend is a lion who became a pacifist and vegetarian after a hunter shot his brother.  So, anyway, one day they notice there's no more water in the water hole.  Billy the Meerkat wanders off to find where it went, and discovers that the humans have built a dam so they can have a swimming pool at their resort hotel...where, coincidentally, a bunch of politicians are gathering for their 168th congress to discuss the climate and environment (without doing anything about it.)

I'm sure I don't need to tell you that by the end of the film, the animals all work together, the dam has been smashed, and they are aided by the token 'good' human, a little girl who 'Gets It.'

The film is hurt by the fact that there are way too many pointless or near-pointless characters.  The polar bear hardly comes into the story.  The Australian animals mainly fart and steal beer. (Or soda.  It's clear-colored, but the cans are unmarked and the characters seem more like beer-drinkers!) The old tortoises mainly boringly tell each other how much they love each other, until they tell the other animals about all the destruction they've seen humans do in the past 700 years (admittedly a very powerful and dark scene) and then die to add a little pathos to the story.  The rooster gets plenty of screen time, but frankly, he's SO annoying and stereotypical I could have done with less of him.  There is an evil hunter who apparently only exists to shoot at animals with a nasty grin on his face.

On the other hand, Socrates the lion is quite likable. There is a chimp, who is clearly a wanna-be human, who I found to be quite the funniest character in the film. There are some visually impressive scenes, like the tortoise's story, the breaking dam, and the blue whale.  And every now and then there will be a sequence that wakes you up and makes you feel like you are not completely wasting the time you spend watching Animals United.

But if you are looking for a gentle way to break your kids in to foreign films, PLEASE start them with something better.  I can strongly recommend: A Fish Tale (AKA Help, I'm a Fish) (Swedish, I think), the Dragon Hunters movie (French), The Secret of Kells (Irish/Belgian), Spirited Away (or any other Miyazaki movie) (Japanese)",1338940800,9,3839,4.7140718562874255

4465329,1,B004T75RNK,"This is the single worst animated film I have ever watched.  My wife ordered it on Pay Per View because my 4 year old son loves animial movies.  It is pure enviro-nazi propaganda.  I don't even mind that much when the propaganda is snuck into the film like in Happy Feet.  At least happy feet is a creative movie with a ridiculous political agenda.

This piece of poop movie had scenes that include a Rooster harassing a black panther for eating meat, then later they show the panther eating vegetables.  The last bit of dialog in the movie is a news reporter standing on top of the UN building in NYC as the animals come walking up, he says, ""coming to you live from the 139th conference on global warming and it looks like the animals are finally going to hold us accountable for our actions...""  Fade to black.

Even if you are into brainwashing your children with fear mongering political films, skip this one.  Poor animation, poor dialog, poor plot, poor soundtrack.

4465337,1,B004T75RNK,"As the title says, this children's movie is based around demonizing people, and is nothing short of a propaganda film to inundate your children with such ideas.

I do not typically write bad reviews, but this one asked for it.  The main theme to this children's movie is that humans are evil and they are out to kill the animals and destroy everything in the world. At least that is what the 714 year old all knowing tortoise tells the entire animal kingdom.

The first dialog of the movie starts out with a speel about Global Warming. They then show how humans are evil and that two drunk sailer's on an oil tanker run aground by the Galapagos and spill the oil everywhere not showing any remorse. Then they show a ""bad"" guy on a motorcycle throwing his beer bottle and smashing it in the desert starting a forest fire. They then show how evil people are from eating meat, with a sadistic cook trying to murder a rooster aboard a ship. It continues with a sadistic hunter or park ranger guy killing the the main characters brother and trying to continuously kill one of the animal characters. Plus the dam that blocks all of the water for the rest of the remaining animal kingdom.

It goes on and on. Give me a break. Really? Why make a movie for humans about animals telling us how evil we are? WTF?

All but one of the animals are vegan including one of the main characters who is a lion. The only character to eat meat is the evil black panther who lives alone in the canyon seeking to kill and eat anyone he can. Really? Predators eat meat, without this they would die. Humans eat meat and this is fine, in fact I love a nice rare steak, how does this make me or any other meat eater evil? The people who made this film need to wake up and learn that animals eat other animals and that is cool. That is how the world stays in balance. It does not make them bad, or make humans bad for doing the same.

Anyways if you hate people, hate society, and hate carnivores, then this movie is for you. However if you enjoy firearms, a nice steak, vehicles, motorcycles, and being a human, then pass this one up as it is a waste of time. Don't get me wrong I am a proponent for taking care of the earth and not letting the large corporations devastate it, but seriously this movie is a HUGE FAIL!!!",1431388800,2,2293,4.284064665127021

Andrews Blu-ray Review: The two protagonists in this animated film are a glib meerkat named Billy [James Corden] and a disenchanted lion named Socrates [Stephen Fry], who decides to go on a quest to discover why the river in their habitat has unexpectedly dried up. Along the way, they meet other animals whose homes have been destroyed by mans inconsiderate ways. Their journey brings them to a dam which has been constructed to supply energy for a luxury resort. They must then come up with a plan to break the dam to get water flowing back into the delta again.

You aren't the only one who noticed something strange with the characters mouth movements. The lip synching seems slightly out of place, only because this is an original German production with an original German cast of unfamiliar names. Here, we have most of brilliant British actors that include James Corden as the talkative meerkat, Stephen Fry channelling a tender and gentle touch to the disillusioned lion, as well as veterans Jim Broadbent and Vanessa Redgrave lending weight to the film as a pair of loving Gal&aacute;pagos tortoises.

It is inevitable that people will compare this animation film with more well-known animations like the Disney The Lion King [1994] where Timon the meerkat and Simba the lion in that production were best friends too? Also in the Madagascar [2005] weren't the motley crew of animals in that DreamWorks hit from Africa as well? This imaginative animation film directed by Reinhard Klooss and Holger Tappe has done a very inventive job so far seen. Its 3D effects are totally brilliant at best, and the animal characters leave a warm lasting impression, while the computer generated effects in scenes involving massive numbers of rhinoceroses and buffalos are awesome. And But the animation film still deserves some brilliant credit and especially if youve got any heart for saving this planet we call home.

Based on a childrens storybook The Animals Conference [1945], this animation film was first visualised in 1969 by Curt Linda. Some 40 years later, the satire in which the worlds animals unite to successfully force humans to disarm and make peace with each other may be slightly diluted, no thanks to todays need to produce movies which are simple and digestible, but the 93 minute animation film is so upfront with its modern environmental message that you cant help but recommend, especially young children to watch it regular, especially in schools, to hit home the message of the danger if humans are allowed to pollute and ravage this planet of ours.

It may seem ridiculously unbelievable at first, but the animation films highlight has to be the rather surrealistic finale where animals from all over the world march onto the streets of New York to sound out that the animal kingdom is under threat from mankind and sends a serious message that us humans cannot ignore. Yes, despite the fact that it is not an animated feature film from Hollywoods honchos like PIXAR or DreamWorks, it still looks stunning. Call this reviewer soft hearted, but how can people criticise an animation film that promotes environmentalism and sends a strong message about mans destruction of animal habitats?

3D Blu-ray Video Quality  Although Animals United had a relatively modest budget, but reportedly somewhere between $40 [50] and $50 [60] million, computer animation has progressed to the point where a lot of value can be created for that amount, if the talent is there. The film's frames may not be as jam-packed with detail as the best of PIXARS's creations, but the creatures are sophisticated in their conception and detailed in their realisation, and the 1080p encoded Blu-ray image reproduces all the fine renderings of texture in such demanding areas as fur, moisture, gravel and dirt. Colours are appropriately saturated, blacks are black and the panther in the Valley of Death is especially well-done, and there is no video or other noise to interfere with your viewing pleasure. As with all such digital animation, the Blu-ray was presumably sourced from digital files, thereby ensuring that the end product matches what the animators created. In Europe, Animals United was released in cinemas in 3D, and many sequences would obviously benefit from the 3D image rendering. However, ARC Entertainment in North America has not announced any plans to release a 3D version.

3D Blu-ray Audio Quality  The 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio surround track fully utilises the five channels to immerse the viewer in the film's experience. Discrete effects are plentiful e.g., beer cans tossed over your shoulder, as are pans and airplane flying, and all-around activities, like stampedes and showdowns between the rhinos and the water buffalos. Bass extension is significant and substantial, because the ground trembles for several reasons, at a number of points in the film. The numerous voice performances, with their wide variety of accents and intonations, are well-reproduced and generally confined to the front centre. The underscoring by the prolific David Newman is spread across the soundstage and blended unobtrusively into the background. This may not be the subtlest of soundtracks, but it's effective and totally professional.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Finally, is Animals United a great animated film? I think PIXAR and DreamWorks Animation do not need to start worrying just yet. But there's undeniable craftsmanship behind it, the kind that only improves with subsequent ventures, and next time the subject matter may not be as difficult to sell in the North American market. That the film's pro-animal slant would set off ideological trip wires and can be seen with user comments via either Amazon or IMDb. I personally enjoyed it precisely because it played like something that would never have survived a journey through the U.S. studio marketing, which almost always aims for blandness. Children, of course, won't care either way. But most important I thought it was a totally brilliant animation film and I just do not know why there have been so much negative comments about this animation film, these people should get a life and not be so up their own petard?

4465346,1,B004T75RNK,"After watching an animated film like this that gets so much wrong, one appreciates all the other animated films out there that have gotten it right. In Animals United, in addition to the greatly over-exaggerated anti-human pro-animal environmental meme which moviegoers are now barfing over because it's so over-used, the characters lack something in their anthropomorphism - they lack a soul. The audience isn't given the opportunity to bond with the characters - maybe because of lack of character development, or maybe because the characters are not very emotional. Maybe it's because we're used to Disney/Pixar films where the characters' movements are pushed/exaggerated, which makes these characters all seem limp and lifeless by comparison. Even Disney's ancient Jungle Book has better animation. I can't really put my finger on it - maybe it's a combination of things. The texturing and lighting/rendering are great, and the musical score uses realistic instruments, but fails to sync fully with the action. And the plot is just completely disjointed. They throw in a couple of slightly funny antics like a meercat who golfs with a hardened ball of ""poo poo"" and a tasmanian devil who farts noxious fumes. But then they ruin these antics or jokes by immediately running them into the ground instead of moving on. And having the characters sing or dance to popular songs like ""King of the Road"" is something that Dreamworks can pull off, but Animals United cannot. It's kind of silly that the characters are dancing at the end when you haven't even bonded with them during the film. Poorly directed. Poorly scripted. Poorly written with a plot that doesn't make any sense. Just don't see it.",1415318400,2,1698,5.089605734767025

4465367,3,B004T75RNK,"You kind of have to go into these direct-to-DVD CG feature releases from Arc Entertainment a bit leery on account of the practice of taking a foreign-made film and slapping an English dialog track atop it and calling it a day.  I don't mean to suggest that there's anything wrong with this practice from an ethical or political standpoint but simply the end result is usually pretty messy.

I am pleased to report that of all the films on the market these days that use this technique, Animals United is perhaps one of the solidest.  The timing is decent, the mouth flaps pretty well aligned and the English voice actors actually manage to bring a degree of character to the characters.

The visuals are absolutely gorgeous and should have little trouble impressing this, a culture raised on the benchmark standard set by industry icons Pixar and DreamWorks (especially in high def).  No, the trouble here has more to do with a heavy-handed moral agenda- but more on that in a bit.

This film began life as Konferenz der Tiere; a 2010 German 3D computer-animated comedy-adventure film directed by Reinhard Klooss and Holger Tappe that was redubbed in English and released in June of 2012 as Animals United (Adventures in Africa) by Arc Entertainment.

Animals United Adventure in Africa is a 93-minute un-rated tale of life in the African savannah where the animals inhabiting the region notice there's a shortage of water.  A small ragtag group of critters consisting of a lion, meerkat, giraffe and elephant set out to find some answers.  In the mean time, due to humanity's influence on their own respective regions, a rooster, polar bear, kangaroo, koala bear, Tasmanian monster and a pair of tortoises make a pilgrimage of their own into the unknown.

All of these animals end up meeting in the savannah and, as the title suggests, unite in the common cause that is sticking it to the man.  And by ""the man"" I literally mean mankind.  If the environmentalism subject managed to ruffle proverbial feathers in Happy Feat, prepare for an all-out plucking with Animals United!

Covered in the hour and a half runtime are the subjects of global warming and natural resource consumption, humans are depicted drinking and motorcycling through animal habitats, drinking and crashing an oil tanker, poaching, polluting, creating industrial waste, damming vital water supplies; in short you can't help but hate us by the end of this one.

As the story progresses, the heavy-handedness of the theme becomes so blatant as border on ridiculousness and manifests itself into a single human ""hunter"" versus the whole of the savannah and a marauding group of insects who deliver the message that the animals mean business by swarming off offending humans' clothing.

If this all sounds a bit much- uh, yea this isn't the kind of silliness one would expect from Madagascar, the cleverness of Happy Feet or the subtlety of say Bambi, Animals United makes sure to deliver the message that man = bad very thoroughly.

However, political, socio-environmentalist messages aside, the film does manage to do what very few direct-to-DVD options can and that's maintain a sense of coherency throughout.  There are even a few genuine laughs to be had along the way (I was particularly fond of the means by which the animals disposed of said hunter and his jeep during one sequence).  However, do expect some toilet humor and plenty of slapstick to attempt to hold the younger ones' interest while the adults are force fed its agendas.

All in all, this one may be worth a rental when all of the big budget CG feature films are out for the night at the Redbox but be forewarned, pretty textures and decent characters alone can't right all of its wrongs.  Its overly preachy approach will certainly keep this one from ever being classified as an animated family classic.",1364256000,,3846,4.896764252696456
4465368,1,B004T75RNK,"Animals United is not just a bad film (If it can even be called that. Trash is a better word for it). It is a bad bad film. It is so atrociously, unbelievably bad my stomach churns within me as I write about it. As I watched it (not willingly of course) my gut heaved and roiled, my ears shriveled, and my eyes twitched in nervous spasms.
I could tell my brain cells were committing suicide, one by one, as I watched this. So I left the room and screamed. I buried myself in Lawrence of Arabia for 4 hours.

Why this garbage is bad:
1. Awful animation. Really, it looks fake, computer generated, ugly, and at times disturbing. It's not just a disgrace to CGI, it's a disgrace to computers itself, to humanity, to the animal kingdom, to the bloody universe!
2. The story, portraying man as evil, disgusting beasts, and animals as the rulers of the world. Not appropriate for children.
3. The humor: crude, trite, tasteless, and shallow. Pass on this; it's not even worthy as toilet paper.

If you are a self-respecting human being, who loves their child, don't show this to them, don't buy it, don't even look at it. In fact, whenever you see a copy of this utter rubbish, spit on it. The world will be a better place without it. How a talented cast ever signed up to do this crap is beyond me. Maybe they were drugged or something.

So please, DON'T BUY THIS JUNK. Animals United gets ZERO stars.",1363737600,11,1396,4.382239382239383
