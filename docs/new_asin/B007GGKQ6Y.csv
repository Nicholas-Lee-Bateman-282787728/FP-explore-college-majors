8516338,5,B007GGKQ6Y,"There is not a better baseball DVD out there! This series showcases what the lowest level of professional baseball is all about. Wally Bachman's two uncensored tirades in the extras section are worth the $25 alone. If you're a fan of any level of baseball, this is a must own product!",1455408000,,284,4.588235294117647
8516339,5,B007GGKQ6Y,"I was drawn to this documentary after being shown clips on YouTube from a coworker. Those clips have been viewed millions of times (probably by us alone), so I wanted to see if there was good content on the rest of the series.

Let's just get this out of the way: the Backman tirade after Doc Brooks gets tossed is, as Wally might say, the best f&&@ing thing I've ever seen. Lasorda, Weaver, Sparky Anderson, Billy Martin...none of then have anything on Wally's rant.

So I thought ""maybe I've seen the best on YouTube."" I couldn't be more wrong. Seeing the grind of day-to-day minor league baseball is highlighted in this documentary. The guy that put this together really knows how to tell a story through his work. The, probably ordinarily, boring life of a minor leaguer is highlighted in a very entertaining way. You come out of this rooting for the players and wondering ""how the f@&$"" Wally never got his shot in the big leagues. You will also become a Wally fan.

Players and coaches are mic'd up through games. There are conversations after games. This is real life stuff.

If you're reading this wondering if you'd like this documentary, and you're a baseball fan of any kind, the answer is ""yes."" If you're buying this as a gift, the person (assuming they love baseball) will love it!

I bought the original version, then I bought the uncensored version. While I own practically every baseball movie and documentary, this is one of my 5 favorites.

Buy this with confidence.",1436054400,,1485,4.670498084291188
8516340,5,B007GGKQ6Y,"I watched the first six episodes on Youtube. I wanted to show the producers my gratitude, so I purchased the uncensored version. This is by far the best minor league documentary that I've watched. Wally Backman is my new favorite manager. I HIGHLY recommend this DVD!",1398643200,2,267,4.826086956521739
8516341,5,B007GGKQ6Y,Wally goes up against umpires who think the fans in the stands bought tickets to see them umpire.  He argues his points and declares their true ancestry.,1397347200,2,153,4.666666666666667
8516342,5,B007GGKQ6Y,"I bought the uncensored version.  Not for mixed company or the youngsters, but for mature adults you will get to see what kinds of things go on in the minor leagues.  I have been around minor league baseball operations over the years and this little 10 episode version seems pretty accurate to me.  Life in the minors is tough on kids and what is worse is a new, fledging,  independent league as you will see if you purchase the video.  Wally is passionate about the game and yes he is salty and does not mix words but this is the world of baseball behind the scenes. There are many F'Bombers....

I particularly laughed at the front office people trying to be league officers and GM's in this league. There was a reason they went to an independent club/league as opposed to affiliated clubs and a reason that the league barely limped through one season before folding.  I also enjoyed seeing the video and then hearing how the press, many of them not even at the park, wrote about several of the ""incidents"".  The press would write one story and you could clearly see the video evidence that it was not true.  The press seemed to kind of set up Wally ""for the ratings game"" and did not truthfully report the events.  After several years in fire and law enforcement service; I know full well how the press does NOT get it right very often or even try very hard to be accurate. They never let truth/facts get in the way of a good story.

If you love baseball, if you feel the depression of the dark days from the end of the season until the start of spring training, if you ever wondered what it was like to try to work your way up into the bigs, this could be a good view for you.  If you have never been part of a team, or not been in the locker rooms as a player or a coach, or only watched the game a few times on TV,  this may be too intense for you.  Be warned there is a lot of profanity, but accurately portrayed as the way it often is found behind the scene in the game of baseball.",1353801600,7,1990,4.2026315789473685
8516343,5,B007GGKQ6Y,You can feel the raw emotion while watching this series. It's a shame that the Georgia Peanuts are now defunct.,1346544000,2,111,4.6
