7992750,4,B00009PY2V,"I have subtracted a star from this DVD because as always  quality of the Kultur packaging  is beyond low. But I got use to it since it is reflected in the price. This time the Kultur went further: the cover has multiple errors in the names of the singers!
Nikolai Okhotnikov, Yelena Prokina, etc....",1426982400,,299,4.518518518518518
7992751,2,B00009PY2V,"Most people will not agree with me, but . . . I found the opera as boring as the book.  It is two stories in one.  The first seems like a bad remake of Les Liasons Dangeruses.  The second, like a speech by Vladimir Putin on the greatness of the Motherland and the need to defend it against Western ""corruption"". . Tolstoi is quite overrated:  length does not mean quality.  As to Prokofiev, I really love his musical output, and I am sorely puzzled at his having tackled such ungainly text.
Musically and vocally, a fine production.  Visually, I felt I was walking into an oversized Manhattan apartment with lots of closets. This is opera as jingoistic propaganda.  I have yet to find a Russian opera that is clearly critical of Russian culture, its gulags, its imperialistic aims, its contempt for Western mores.  For truly great Prokofiev operas, get ""The Fiery Angel"" or ""Love for Three Oranges"".",1417910400,3,899,4.681528662420382
7992752,5,B00009PY2V,"superbly staged 2nd Act, somewhat pedestrian 1st

given that this written at the height of the 2nd World War, the repeated fervent patriotism promising the defeat of the enemy is perfectly understandable:  the legion of brilliant male singers especially Gegam Gregorian as Pyotr and the magnificent Nicolai Othotnikov as Field-Marshall Kutuzov (would there were more of his work on DVD) are stunning:  but the greatest praise must go to Stage Director Graham Vick whose crowd movement and therefore constantly shifting stage pictures is nothing short of breathtaking and, as ever, the superlative conducting of Valery Gergiev",1411776000,2,625,5.489583333333333
7992753,5,B00009PY2V,This is an excellent production of an epic Opera. I highly recommend it.,1277769600,3,72,4.615384615384615
7992754,5,B00009PY2V,"Warching this wonderful DVD makes it obvius that ""War and Peace"" is truly a great opera, if somewhat neglected in the west. I was fortunate to have seen it performed at the Met back in the 70's when the Bolshoi Opera visited and this Kirov production cannot compare to that. Sets here are more than sparse and much of the first act looks like it is performed in various locations of a men's locker room. But the scenery(or non scenery) works better in the second half when the stage is raised and lowered to create more interesting multi-leveled performance areas. But this disc is about the singing and the singing is wonderful. Gergiev conducts with a mastery of the score and the chorus work is magnificient. This is an opera full of national pride and you can see it on the faces of both the performers and the audience. It is also interesting to see glimpses of the inside of the Marinsky theater-a masterpiece in it's own work. This video is definitely a memorable night at the opera on all accounts.",1268697600,9,1006,4.56353591160221
7992755,4,B00009PY2V,"A simple but effective production of a fine opera. The first  half, Peace, is a bit more effective than the second.  The opera is about World War II more than the French invasion of Russia. The actors were all effective as actors and vocally.",1061424000,9,242,4.4772727272727275
7992756,5,B00009PY2V,"Well sung, well acted and simply produced. It seems like two operas, Peace is dominated by beautiful waltzs, and is light and elegant. War is a choral adventure, very much reflecting the impact of World War II. A grand opera, the sets are minimal and don't always contribute much, but they do alow the music to dominate the DVD.",1060300800,18,328,4.576271186440678
7992757,5,B00009PY2V,"Many thanks to Kultur for finally making this magnificent opera available years after the VHS release was cut from the Philips Classics catalog.  The Kirov production is fine ensemble work and is performed with sprit and conviction.  DVD sound and picture quality are very good (this is a two-disk set, although the description does not indicate that).  My only minor compaint is that I find the sets a bit too minimalistic for such a sweeping work, but that's just niggling.  This is a must-see for anyone who loves Russian opera, particularly since few of us will ever get a chance to see this one live.
I hope Kultur will next bring out the wonderful Kirov production of Rimsky-Korsakov's ""Sadko,"" which was part of the original Philips Kirov series and is also out-of-print.",1060041600,44,778,4.871212121212121
