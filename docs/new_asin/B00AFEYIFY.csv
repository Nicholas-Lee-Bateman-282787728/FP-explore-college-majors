5423635,3,B00AFEYIFY,"The older versions were so much better in content.  They had the winner of qualifying do narration of the upcoming track, and so much more presentation of racing detail.  We had major changes in tires last year that were simply mentioned, video was good but the content is lacking.",1360108800,,281,4.714285714285714
5423636,3,B00AFEYIFY,"Picture quality is very good. No coverage of qualifying, they go right to the grid at the start of the race which I think removes some of the drama of each event. I was a little disappointed and I don't feel this review is as good as previous years.",1359936000,,249,4.1020408163265305
5423637,3,B00AFEYIFY,"This is a very clinical review of the 2012 F1 season. If you are used to the flashy graphics and entertaining format from the announcers at SkyTV or the BBC, this video won't impress you much. Every race is covered, albeit without much flash or additional behind the scenes footage or ""investigative"" reporting.

Visually, it's high quality video, on par with the Sky or BBC broadcasts, and much better than the highly compressed SpeedTV broadcasts. If you have only seen F1 on Speed, watching this will be a treat. Content wise, it's simply a comprehensive review of the 2012 season. Most races get a good 10 minutes of coverage, and not only the race leaders. You'll often be shown battles between 8th place or 15th place. As stated before, it's just not presented in a memorable way.

Scattered throughout the running time, there are plenty of cut aways to the pits and to the team principals, but again there's just not much production involved. The production consists almost entirely of FIA footage from the races, unedited, and un-embellished. Rarely any graphics, interviews, or even subtitles. No music, no dramatic cues to slow motion rain falling on a track while a tight race enters it's final laps... just FIA footage and the narrator describing exactly what you're seeing.

You do get to see and hear some of the FIA footage that neither Sky, BBC, or SpeedTV used during their broadcasts. Vettel's ""rant"" during Spain is a good example of this - I didn't hear his complaining about his drive through penalty on any other broadcast but it was fully covered in this DVD. The DVD is censored however, so if you want to hear Schumi blasting Senna with f-bombs after his accident, you won't have it on this SVD.

That's not to say the Season Review DVD is a bad DVD. It's bare bones, but very comprehensive. At no time during any race does this DVD try to tell you an interesting story about a particular driver or constructor. It simply shows you what happened, while the narrator describes it. You see everything race related, presented in a very no-nonsense manner, announced by a guy with a British accent that has very little emotional range.

It's a great way to catch up on what happened in 2012 but if you're not already a fan, this DVD won't teach you your Buttons from your KERS from your Mercedes. It's geared towards the well established F1 fan that has already followed the sport throughout the season and is familiar with every driver, constructor, and race venue.",1359763200,,2487,4.734411085450346
5423638,1,B00AFEYIFY,"Finally in 2011 we got to watch Formula One in high definition, and what a treat it was! The additional clarity and consistency of colors and black levels made for a far greater viewing experience than the standard definition widescreen feed Bernie had said was good enough for people now with not enough people having HDTV's.

In North America we've been able to watch ""Bass Fishing with Rolando"" in high definition for almost ten years, and Formula One racing the premiere racing league on the planet only went HD in 2011? Ecclestone really is a plonker.

Anyway, 2011 was an exciting season outside of the run for the Championship which was sewn up very early on. The great Montreal race in the rain, the always exciting Spa, I was looking forward to watching this review on Blu-ray. We've put up with some really AWFUL reviews over the years, from the faked color commentary as though the race was actually happening to the brutal pixelation and compression artifacts that were finally fixed in 2007 when they started going to 2 discs. I mean it, if you want to see possibly one of the WORST DVD releases of ALL TIME, pick up the 2006 season review. It is absolutely awful. I don't think I've ever seen another DVD as bad as this, it's like a terrible YouTube video. Which really sucks because that season was amazing.

So the announcement for the season review comes and goes. A DVD was announced for North America with a Blu-ray and DVD option being announced for European markets. I imported it from Amazon UK and sadly it was region locked. So after figuring out how to bypass that (hint - 2 blank 50GB Blu-ray discs to retain full quality) I then ran into the next obstacle, the disc was encoded in 1080i50. Virtually no HDTV's in North America will decode a 1080i50 signal and hardly any manufacturers make players here that will play this signal anyway. After lots of researching it turns out that while not advertised, all Samsung and LG players will convert 1080i50 > 1080i60 on the fly. Oppo's players also do this but are out of the price range of most people not interested in things like high resolution audio (Super Audio CD, DVD-Audio, etc.). I picked up a used Samsung BD-D5700 and finally was able to watch F1 in Blu-ray quality - MAGNIFICENT!!!!

The only shortcoming of the 2011 Blu-ray was that it had dts-ma advertised and only came with lossy DVD-quality Dolby Digital.

So here we are in 2013 waiting on the release of the amazing 2012 F1 season that came down to that terrific race in Brazil. Again, Blu-ray & DVD announced for Europe, only DVD announced for North America? WTF? Come on now, this is pure laziness on the part of the studio. If you can convert the 1080i50 feed to 480i60 for DVD release, why not give us a 1080i60 Blu-ray as well?

From what I gather from the Amazon UK site this release will actually be encoded for both Region A and Region B which is great, mine is already en route, but this pattern of hosing over North America Formula One fans by not offering a Blu-ray release in this region has to stop. (EDIT - according to poster ""Mavrick"" on the Blu-ray forums this disc is locked to region B, but in one piece of good news they've actually put lossless dts-ma on it even though it's not noted on the back).

It's 2013, over 70% of American households own an HDTV now. Bring on the F1 blu-ray discs. I can't even locate info for the distributing studio for this release (Standing Room Only) to ask them about this omission.

For those interested, it works out to around US$20 to import the Blu-ray.

Regarding the DVD vs. the Blu-ray, there is no pre-race build up featuring Will Buxton on the DVD. For some reason they went with extra features and handicapped the main feature which some may not like. The Blu-ray release in REGION B has an additional 2-hour featurette entitled ""The Story of 2012"" which has loads of pre-race intros by Will Buxton including the qualy/practice footage. It's a shame it can't be included within the main featurette using Blu-ray's seamless branching but it's not on the same disc. This is kind of the opposite of the 2011 which had all the main feature on the DVD but none of the 2 hours of extra features that were only on the Blu-ray. The main feature on last year's Blu-ray was spread over 2 discs, this year it's all on the one disc. That's a little over 5 hours of footage on one 50GB disc so you can expect the picture to not be quite as sharp as last year's Blu-ray but likely still a nice step-up over the highly compressed MPEG-2 HD broadcasts most of us have to endure in North America.

To sum up, not only are we getting shafted in North America for quality, but we're also missing out on over 2 hours of extras that are only being released on the Blu-ray version that we're not getting.

BOGUS!

EDIT - some additional info for those thinking of importing from the UK the Blu-ray. Sounds like there is one solution that will work for all North American systems. Apparently the Orei M2 looks like a good option. It plays any DVD whether NTSC or PAL regardless of region, and plays any Blu-ray and 3D Blu-ray regardless of region, also converting 1080i50 > 1080i60 on the fly for those of us (most of us in NA) whose TV's won't handshake with a 1080i50 signal.

They said the conversion is automatic. However you have to set the region manually to B to play a REGION B disc, so I wanted to confirm whether or not this affected the conversion. They've confirmed that even when set to REGION B a 1080i50 disc will still automatically convert to 1080i60 unless you go into the settings and change it to ""MULTI"" which would be multi-system.

Sounds like this is a winner to me. It's only $150 shipped from Amazon.

EDIT #2 - I got my M2 last night and it works as described. I tried both my 2012 F1 Season Review on Blu-ray and it played perfectly, then I tried my PAL 2008 F1 season review and that also worked perfectly. I now have a player that will play any DVD and any Blu-ray regardless of video format (50Hz/60Hz) and regardless of region coding. Sweet!

EDIT #3 - The 2013 edition of the season review is the first Blu-ray to be put out by Duke in the UK, it is encoded at 1080i60 and has REGION ABC coding on it, so if you import (works out to around US$25) it will work on ANY North American Blu-ray player.

8550932,3,B00AFEYIFY,"I now own every single FIA Formula 1 review DVD. The production value is good and the format has been the same in terms of reviewing each race. The beginning of the review does not go over the teams and drivers at the beginning of the season. The thing that disappointed me the most is the fact that it is not available for Blu-Ray here in the North America region. The quality of the video is good for DVD, but I was hoping to see a Blu-Ray version come out for North America this year. Hopefully, next year the company, SRO Entertainment will produce a Blu-Ray version for the 2013 F1 review. Overall it is okay. The review isn't that good in its format as previous years, but still gives you enough to enjoy each race. There were plenty of other F1 storylines they forgot to tell and show for this review. I suggest buying this at a discounted price, even for the die hard F1 fan.",1377561600,,883,4.293413173652695
8550933,5,B00AFEYIFY,A concise and complete review of the 2012 season. Formula one is about the machines and the few men who can drive them. It is this synthesis and the awesome physics involved that makes this series so enduring. A great buy for the fan.,1370736000,,234,4.340909090909091

I get these every year and they never cease to make me excited for the next season to begin.  The only reason why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is because they don't have it out on Blu-Ray for us North American fans.  I know there's not as many North American F1 Fans as in Europe, but come on, I'd love to have this on Blu-Ray, especially this season.",1370131200,,486,4.041666666666667
