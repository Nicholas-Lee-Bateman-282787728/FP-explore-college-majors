8076855,5,B000A9QL5O,"I have the 2010 version of this set that includes the same films on one double sided disk, I mention this because I am actually impressed with the quality of the prints and transfers of these films, when compared to similar value sets, but Im not sure it applies to the 2005 release. The cheese factor is uber high with this set and several of these films are considered minor classics. Vampire Night Orgy 1973, a bus full of tourists ends up stranded at an old inn in a town inhabited by vampires, file under atmospheric eurohorror similar to the Blind Dead, a bit slow, but has it's merits. 1971 Werewolf vs Vampire woman, this one is an atmospheric low budget spanish film, that reminded me of some of the old Hammer films, also may be a bit slow for some, but I found it worthwhile, well written and directed. Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things 1973, directed by Ben Clark who later directed Porky's, A theater troupe decides to get some kicks by digging up corpses and trying to resurrect them, this is a really weird cheesy flick you won't soon forget, outrageously overacted and bizarre, I found this print of the film to be especially good compared to others I've seen. The Thirsty Dead 1974 off the charts cheesy flick about a blood drinking cult living in the jungle that kidnaps young white women to drain them of their life essence, the cult leader looks like Greg Brady, complete in bell bottomed one piece jumpsuits white man afro and gold chains, guilty pleasure abounds. Last but not least 1971's Blood Thirst, a surprisingly affective and interesting B&W film about an american detective trying to solve the unusual murders of young women working at a night club in the Philippians. It is rare to find so many worthwhile films in a bundled movie set like this, and I am especially pleased with the quality of both Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things, and Thirsty Dead.",1300579200,,1896,4.645833333333333
8076856,4,B000A9QL5O,"This is a two disc set. Disc one contains the movies ""The Vampire Night Orgy"" (Italy/Spain 1973), ""The Werewolf vs. The Vampire Woman"" (aka ""La Noche de Walpurgis"") (Germany/Spain 1970), and ""Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things"" (Canada 1972). Disc Two has ""The Thirsty Dead"" (USA/Philipines 1974) and ""Blood Thirst"" (USA/Philipines 1974). Like the first volume, the quality of the transfers is average (there are some defects from the original prints) and the extra features are minimal. But once again, a nice collection of some decent movies at a bargain price.",1147305600,6,569,5.263736263736264
