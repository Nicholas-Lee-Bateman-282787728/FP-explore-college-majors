8522088,5,B007V2LN2O,"Psychic squad collection 2 is simply amazing. It still has the fanservice stuff from collection 1, but I don't mind and this collection was so feelsy. I ended up marathoning the whole collection in on day(and I'm usually able to control it). I love the characters and plenty of the story introduced. A few problems I do have are the few fanservice seens that involve the main girls, because that's not good, it's not as bad as Fate kaleid Thankyou, but still a minor problem",1468886400,,474,4.588235294117647
