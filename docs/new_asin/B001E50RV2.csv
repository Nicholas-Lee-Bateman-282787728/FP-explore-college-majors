I tried it in several different DVD players, none could overcome the flaws in the DVD which I'm guessing are physical.

8296320,4,B001E50RV2,"For those who prefer a change of format and scenery, this is a color broadcast from a British university with William F. Buckley chatting in a cafeteria-like setting with remarkable intimacy. Dame Rebecca West paints a wide canvas with the niceties of Philby and other notable spies. The subject of spies, here, is exclusively speaking about government spies other than fictional James Bonds, when the iron curtain was formidable and America had rid itself of McCarthyism, a decade later trapped in Vietnam. In all, this is an interesting Anglican/American sharing of notions about treason and the ramifications of government betrayal. Mr. Buckley runs into a wall attempting to compare this sort of treason to dissent in the Black panthers or Malcolm X, as far as Ms. West was concerned. I don't think Ms. West was far-sighted in predicting the rise of con artists along the lines of the Watergate burglars. But she was sure right about a lower class of individual betraying their country in the near future. One indication of the respect Mr. Buckley had for his engagingly informed British guest, was his momentary slip in calling her sir, and, unlike ""The View,"" no offense was taken or feigned for entertainment purposes. One felt upon viewing that Ms. West was holding back some cloak and dagger secrets only found, perhaps, in her book. Certainly left me thirsting.",1238630400,,1371,5.017543859649122
