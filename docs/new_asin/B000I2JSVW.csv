2652476,5,B000I2JSVW,"As a 23 year old anime fan (been a fan since i was around 13) there is very few titles out there that catch my attention anymore. Most lack substance and story. Music is sometimes an issue, as well as animation. Very rarely can a show or movie pull off all of these categories. I'm happy to report that Ergo Proxy delivers them all. The animation is crisp and full of life.. an occasional 3d CGI scene is used (what shows don't now a days?). The music is also outstanding. Very minimal and ambient at times, often with an eerie edge to it. Other times its fast paced and techno-ish. The story is the true winner here.. exploring areas of man and machine not yet done in anime. The lead character, a woman, is interesting to watch and her character design is pretty unique. I would sum this show up best as a cross between Witch Hunter Robin and Ghost in the Shell. Thats not too surprising though considering Ergo Proxy has the same director that Witch Hunter Robin did.

Check this one out, thats all i can say.",1164412800,17,1012,4.354497354497354
2652477,5,B000I2JSVW,"Ergo Proxy is a great new anime it has some of the best animation I have ever seen and a very good start to a storyline. Its kind of confusing at first with all the cover-ups going on but the unique characters drive the show. I wish there was more stunning action and a little less talking. But it does remind me a little of Ghost in the Shell, its not quite as good but with the animation and story it certainly could be.",1164240000,,422,4.035714285714286
2652478,5,B000I2JSVW,"Man, their was something about this title and the two screen shots that came with a quick overview when I was browsing a Newtype Mag. The review couldn't say much if it was good or bad because even the author haven't witnessed it himself. It was all for the inticaption factor of the arrival of Ergo Proxy in the States.

But I couldn't wait for the English dubbed especially since I was at a intermediate level of Japanese, so I bought the Japanese version. Even when I swore to give up on collecting anime since the latest stuff seemed to be full of cliche's and cheap panty shots. But this one I felt in my heart, the same feeling when I stubbled on the reviews of such titles as Noir, RahXephon, Wolf's Rain, Gunslinger Girls, Kino's Journey which changed my view of life in one way or another. Ergo Proxy has reopened my shut doors to the anime once again to prove that their is still good script writers in the world of anime.",1163548800,5,932,4.35632183908046
2652479,5,B000I2JSVW,"I've been watching the fan-subs of this series since it aired in Japan Spring 06, and haven't been disappointed with it in the least.

Here's why:

The setting is like a cross of Ridley Scott's film and the movie Dark City.

if you liked either of those films, you'll enjoy this.

Music is top-notch; even features a Radiohead closing song.

Animation is consistently great. Some scenes come off scetchy, but maintain an edgy style.

Lots of visual metaphor literary references give you something to chew on.

A really unique heroine, with depth and some intense internal struggles.

there're more reasons I'm sure you could find if you gave the first few episodes a chance.

Be warned, though, if you don't care for a lot of exposition, then Ergo Proxy might come off as dull at times. Also, some of the literary elements might cause some confusion with some viewers. It's handy to write the stuff down and refer to it later online. It's worth learning that stuff anyway. :D

2652501,5,B000I2JSVW,"Really quite amazing, as stated. The character and background design and presentation is exquisite. I didn't get it at first, but resigned myself to just soak it all in leisurely.... that convoluted plot can be a strike against it, and every once in a while the animations REALLY goofs up.... like a paragraph spoken without any accompanying lip motion.... if you can forgive those two rough edges, and I know I'm drastically late in realizing this, but this is one of the best I've ever seen.",1485993600,2,493,4.744186046511628

2652505,4,B000I2JSVW,"The good just barely outweighed the bad in this anime series, but I enjoyed the weirdness of it and found the style very entertaining, so I gave it four instead of three stars.  The plot, with all its twists and turns, is unique, the characters are mostly well-written, and the voice acting is consistently good.  The story is bleak, with just a hint of hopefulness, and the pace is sometimes moderately slow, but with such a dark, broody plot, it isn't surprising.
A few things didn't work for me, though.  A few over-the-top cartoony episodes almost made me quit watching.  I wish anime producers would quit trying to combine Bugs Bunny with Akira.  The philosophical dialog, frequent in the series, alternates between adolescent platitudes and complete nonsense.  One minute you'll be rolling your eyes, and the next you'll be saying, ""Wait, what does that have to do with . . . ?""  By far, the worst aspect of the series is the ending.  It doesn't make sense on quite a few levels, and though I kept watching just to find out where it was going, I tuned out through much of the last three episodes because none of the characters were making sense, and most of the final explanations for the series' running mysteries were just plain kooky.",1473724800,,1243,4.669724770642202

Now Devil My Cry and Ergo Proxy are vying for the first position in my mind. Thing that haven't happened with another anime before, so good luck to you both....",1387670400,,424,4.3
2652512,4,B000I2JSVW,"Dark, atmospheric anime with some philosophically interesting ideas. Great for fans of Ghost in the Shell, though Ergo Proxy is a different beast.

Sometimes... too dark. And I don't mean thematically, I mean the actual color palette. There are some scenes you can only watch in a completely dark room to actually be able to see, which is annoying if you aren't near a space like that. The characters are passable, but hard to like. The male lead is predictably whiny and amnesia-stricken, and a lot of time is killed bringing him up to speed. The female lead is capable and doesn't complain, but doesn't offer a very compelling reason for anything she does, and so feels mechanical.

But the setting is very creative, very clever. Think Ghost in the Shell, but 1000 years later and in a post-apocalyptic future. In what is supposed to be the last great city, people are grown in tubes for specific purposes and can live forever. It's an Orwellian setting in which everyone has a personal robot servant to assist them, and strives to be the best citizen they can. Their world is shaken, though, when monsters called Proxies begin tearing through town. The story that follows leads more into mysticism and end-of-days pseudo-science than political intrigue, but I thought this gave it a unique flavor.",1370995200,,1300,4.851351351351352

2652514,5,B000I2JSVW,"Contains Ergo Proxy episodes 1-4

Please DO NOT read the official Amazon reviewer's reviews for this series.  The review for the series as a whole contains a major spoiler.  Plus, it's obvious Mr. Solomon doesn't like the series.

In the distant future of Earth, centuries after some unknown catastrophy, the human race lives in a ""boring utopia"" of domed cities.  Fellow citizens of the city of Romdo are constantly urged by ubiquitous ads to consume, consume, consume.  Another domed city, Mosk, has recently been destroyed, and refugees are immigrating to Romdo with the goal of becoming fellow citizens.  Most of the people of Romdo (citizen or immigrant) have at least one ""Autoreiv"" (robot) who might serve as an assitant (""entourage"") or simply as a companion.

We meet most of the main and secondary characters in the first episode (in order of appearance):
Daedelus: a young genius scientist/doctor.  Obsessed with Re-l.  Involved with the proxies.
An ugly proxy: proxies are humanoid monsters, and to tell you anything else at all about them would be a spoiler.  Knowledge of their existence is kept from the general public.  This one breaks loose from a lab.
Raul Creed: Chief of the Security Bureau - knows a proxy exists, but doesn't know what it is.  He's ordered to capture the ugly proxy, not kill it.
Kristeva: his autoreiv entourage.
Regent Donev Mayer: ruler of Romdo and grandfather of Re-l.  He never communicates directly, but speaks via four floating statues (at least, I think that's what is going on.)
Re-l Mayer: works for the intelligence bureau.  Sees two proxies. No one believes her (or, if they know proxies exist, pretend they don't believe her.)
Iggy: her autoreiv entourage.
Vincent Law: a recent immigrant from Mosk who investigates reports of autoreivs becoming infected with the cogito virus, a virus which causes autoreivs to become self-aware, self-determined, and sometimes (but not always) homicidal.
Pino: a companion model autoreiv - a substitute child.  According to Vincent Law, she does not have the cogito virus.  Her human ""parents"" have just been given a new human baby, so her ""mother"" no longer wants her.
The ""joker-faced"" proxy: breaks into Re-l's apartment as she is preparing to take a shower.  Then the ugly proxy appears, they fight briefly, then leave.

And that's just the first episode.

Rated 16+ because - ah, who the heck knows.  I have no idea how they rate these things.  There's a lttle occassional gore, violence, swear words, but not that much.  ""Fanservice"" is mostly subliminal to non-existent.  People younger than 16 might not have the attention span for this.

I'd rate the series as a whole somewhere around 4.3 to 4.5.  Not ""ohmigod, you gotta see this"" good, but close.  The animation and English voice acting are reasonbly good for the most part.  There are a few filler episodes which you may or may not like.  The animation quality suffers in the final disc.  Nevertheless, if you like series that make you think and that you'll have to watch a few times to really understand (and I don't claim to get it all myself), I recommend this series.  Since the box set is insanely expensive, I advise you to buy the single discs, since most of them are reasonably priced.  Keep your eye on Disc 6 (the final disc).  If you're lucky, you might get it at a good price.  (There are Region 2 Ergo Proxy Discs 7, 8, and 9, but these apparently contain episodes 17-19, 20-22, and 23 respectively.)

[Edit: This series will be re-released in August 2012.  Also, Amazon removed the spoiler from Charles Solomon's review.]",1331856000,5,3585,4.897009966777409
2652515,5,B000I2JSVW,"Ergo Proxy is perhaps one of the most under-appreciated anime of all time. It is such a fantastic work aimed at mature audience (mature in sense of intelligence. For example, the utopia is based on Plato's ideal guardian society with philosopher rulers). Everything about the show has been researched and masterfully brought to life in this piece of art.

***Animation***
The animation is beautiful, the visual style, the art and settings.

***Audio***
I purchased the OST because of it's great music. There are a few background music you hear throughout the show that just stick with you. The opening song, Kiri, (which won't appear until episode 02) is really nice. It's well put together with the opening animation.

***Voice-overs***
I always watch anime in the original Japanese voice-overs and occasionally switch between English to compare the works. I have to admit, Ergo Proxy blew me away with the English work; such talents. I never imagined myself say this, but I feel one of the English cast did a better job that their Japanese counterpart. Liam O'Brien who does the voice of Vincent Law is amazing. He does such a fantastic job portraying Vincent throughout his journey of self discovery. Pino and Iggy also have great voice-overs. Re-l, on the other hand, does not. Her voice actress isn't bad, but compare to the rest of the cast, she seems less talented.

I had purchased the original DVDs (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ergo-Proxy-Volume-1-Awakening-Limited-Edition/dp/B000I2JSVW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ergo Proxy, Volume 1: Awakening (Limited Edition)</a>) when they were first released and just recently bought the digital version for my Kindle. Unfortunately, the digital format does not come with multiple audio tracks, so you can only watch it in English. But as I mentioned, the English cast is really, really good.

The show has lots of references to great art and philosophical works. There are tons of trivia and homages throughout the show if you pay attention. The team has put effort down to the littlest details. For example, if you pause during any of the scenes that show English text, you'll see it's real text, well written, and actually makes sense. I remember pausing on one scene where one of characters (who is a doctor) was working on a paper. The paper he was working on was legitimate medical text. That just made me happy to see the love the director and developers put into this great anime.

I watched this show when I had just begun college and I didn't really quiet get it at the time. A few years later, I went back and watched it again and I was blown away. Watch it, you won't regret it.",1327017600,,2682,5.070294784580499
2652516,5,B000I2JSVW,"The series is great beyond words it really makes you think and the ending is mindbobbling.

2652519,3,B000I2JSVW,"Ergo Proxy is without doubt one of my favorite Sci-Fi animations in the past five years. Not only is it visually fascinating, its ambition in bringing forth highly philosophical questions is also admirable. You could easily recognize clues all the way from existentialism, theology, to applied ethics. As for the limited edition, the bonus disc does not bring too much excitement. A couple short footages show the Japanese teamwork and an unnecessarily long interview shows the American production team's comments. I would've skipped the bonus and gone straight to the anime itself.",1259452800,,582,5.336956521739131

2652528,5,B000I2JSVW,"Ergo Proxy is a fairly dark, slow paced and moody anime with a very cryptic storytelling style. It takes place in a post apocalyptic future in which the main characters seem to be caught up in a plot involving virus infected robots who gain self awareness and the unknown force that seems to be behind it. It sounds simple, but trust me, it's not. It's just a bit hard to explain.

What this title does best is atmosphere. You have a cinematic style that somewhat resembles that of the Mothman Prophecies and a world and music and look that is very similar to an MMO by the name of Neocron. This creates a very rich and dark atmosphere to the anime that mirrors its shadowed plot.

This particular release will leave you with many questions however, the stage is set and a lot of events take place but at this point very little of it is actually explained. We know basically what the characters know and nothing more, a storytelling style that I actually love but might be something to watch out for if it's not a style that interests you. The english voice acting is also quite good as is the sub so both schools should be pleased. The title and ending also have very good tracks, the title(starting on ep. 3) is an english song by the band Kiri and the ending is a song by the band Radiohead.

This anime has so much going for it, it's not thick with action and is fairly slow paced but it seems to really be setting up a great story and the cinematic style and atmosphere to it is almost unmatched in the anime world. If the subject matter appeals to you then I highly recommend giving this series a shot.",1203120000,2,1608,4.335548172757475

2652530,5,B000I2JSVW,"(This review refers to the series as a whole and contains no spoilers)

First, this is the last complete series produced by the sinking Geneon aniimation studio.  Due to internal issues, they have cancelled their current projects indefinately.  That aside...

The series begins in Romdo, a Utopian society that borrows heavily from the ideals of Shangri-La and Shamballa that have been wildy popular of late.  Humans live side by side with machines (Auto-Reivs).  Everything seems perfect, but of course it isn't.  Within three episodes you will be gasping in horrific awe as the beautifully gothic artwork sends chills down your spine.

The characters are well portrayed, especially Pino (which is borrowed from both Piano and Pinocchio) the Cogito infected Auto-Reiv (seriously need to watch the show to get all that).  The other characters are also marvelously melodramatic and complex.  Re-L, Vincent Law, Daedelus, and Raul Creed are all masterfully portrayed by both the Japanese and the English actors.

Music and artwork are both masterfully produced.  The music fits in with the various moods, themes, and elements.  The artwork, like the music, is also in line with the various moods.

This chief writer was Dai Sato, and if anyone wants to see some great anime, then check out his works (Eureka Seven, Cowboy Beebop, Ghost in the Shell SAC and SAC 2nd GIG, Wolf's Rain, and Samurai Shamploo).

Pros: Artwork, music, characters, story, theme, voice acting.
Cons: Not much to complain about, a few episodes have less stellar animation (obviously sent to cheaper Korean studios for those few episodes), the series was rushed to completion before Geneon cancelled everything (its only 23 episodes not 26).",1196726400,,1712,5.197080291970803

The episodes slowly shows a conective with the characters, that sadly, have not, until the end of Vol. 1 ( Awakening), developed an interesting psychological side.
We can only hope that it'll be explored later.

2652536,5,B000I2JSVW,"I broke down and bought the first three volumes of Ergo Proxy (the first volume was in the box-set that has the Bonus Volume), even though I swore to myself I was going to wait until I finished completing Tokko and then got Heat Guy J and The Last Exile in my collection.

I knew I was going to love ergo Proxy, and I was right, From the very beginning I was stunned by the artwork and animation - and the computer animation surrounding is absolutely gorgeous. I actually started Episode One over and watched it in Japanese without the subtitles just so I could look at the animation and not let the story get in the way - this didn't spoil much because the first episode is basically set-up anyway.

I rewatched the first episode two more times - once in Japanese with the subtitles and then in English. Though the English voicework is capable, it should be noted that Re-L's personality is a lot different in Japanese than in English. If you watch the scene where her auto-reiv Iggy is driving her to work near the beginning of episode one in both languages, you'll see. In English, when Iggy tells Re-l that her grandfather thinks of her as his 'little princess' (or something akin to that), she agrees with her andro-chauffeur; In Japanese however, Re-l responds by giving Iggy a small warning by saying his name in a chastising tone... she knows that Iggy is just a machine and treats him as such. ""I can't take it anymore!"" she cries, growing quickly tired of the upgrade that auto-reiv's have that makes them chit-chat about recent events, weather, etc. Installed to make them seem more human, Re-l doesn't seem too thrilled with the component so tells Iggy to disable the program for the rest of their ride.

Though I generally only watch anime in the language it was born with, I always watch my DVD's in English too (if I pay for something I want to get all that I can out of it!) and sometimes the voicework is on par to the original (like Azumanga Daioh, Fulmetal Alchemist, and even Eureka Seven) but in Ergo Proxy, the Japanese version is far superior, because Re-l simply has a darker, more pessimistic tone to her voice. This fits in with the amazingly bleak world this anime is - it's as if a Dickensian ironworks factory went and swallowed up modern-day Los Angeles. But having said that, the English voice actress Megan Hollingshead is still very good (and light years better than the English voice actress in Ghost In The Shell, who makes me want to jam kabob sticks in my ears), as are most of the others in the cast (at least so far -I just finished episode three).

The big flaw of the DVD though is that the subtitles are sometimes up for like 1/4 of a second and you need to go back and pause the episode in order to read what was being said. That's just inexcusable and a rookie mistake - hopefully they get that fixed in future volumes.

All I can say now is that if you've been waiting for another dark and dreary - yet comfortable and fascinating - universe to immerse yourself into, then this is it. It's just amazing to look at, and Re-l makes for one hell of a guide. She's beautiful, mysterious - and tough as hell while still being feminine.. and unlike the Major in Ghost/Shell, she doesn't need to dress like a porn star. Re-l has an innate femininity that shines through without being obvious. And a big plus is that the episodes can be seen several times without boring you - Seeing the first few episodes two or three times, I discovered things that I had missed, learned more from parts of the dialogue I hadn't understood the first time through, and also quickly became more comfortable and familiar within the world of Romdo. Even though I'm still early on in the strange story that makes Ergo Proxy, I dread the moment that it comes to an end. Worth every penny - and worth getting a few months before I planned to!",1184025600,3,3858,4.466666666666667
2652547,5,B000I2JSVW,"Romdo was a domed city, a place where humans and robots lived together, in peace and love.  A utopia of the future, with complete government control and happiness for all.  Yeah, right.  Mix Blade Runner, Ghost In The Shell and Witch Hunter Robin into a big bowl and you have Ergo Proxy.
It seems that robots are going nuts, even praying, and Re-I Mayer of the Intelligence Bureau wants to know what's going on.  Is it a virus, a man made plot or is God really doing something to the robots?  Why do all the robots try to flee the city using the same pathway?  And why are humans being murdered?  Is everything linked or is there something else going on in the background?
Four interesting episodes and some lame extras in the form of boring previews.  That's the only problem with the disc.  Not much in the way of anything extra.  Is Geneon getting cheap on us?  But the story, artwork and character design is enough of a reason to at least check out the first DVD.  On the other hand, if the second disc only has three episodes and no extras I might think twice before buying it.",1183593600,6,1082,4.355
2652548,4,B000I2JSVW,"Ergo Proxy is a very interesting start to a new science fiction anime. I ended up enjoying these first four episodes a lot more than I thought I would, but I find it hard to give this a complete recommendation. Series like this that try to be all philosphical and deep, and with a title like Ergo Proxy how could it try to be anything else, have a tendency to fail spectacularly in the end because their storylines end up being crushed under the wait of philosophical mumbo-jumbo that the creators clearly have only a superficial understanding of.

This story takes place far in the future. Earth is all but uninhabitable thanks to ecological disaster. Domed cities exsist where people, the chosen few called Citizens, can live in a comsumers paradise. In one such domed city, Romdo, humanity lives in comfort with help from AutoReivs, robots that serve as companions, walking PDAs, and 24-hour spying devices for the central government. The city currently has two problems. A terrible monster called a Proxy has escaped the government's confinement and is rampaging through the city. The second is that AutoReivs are being infected with the cogito virus, a rogue program that makes the machines self-aware and unruly.

Inspector Re-l Mayer, a rather gothy looking policewoman and granddaughter of the city's overlord whose use of eye-shadow makes Tammy Faye Baker's comestic use look moderate in comparision, is investigating an incident where infected AutoReivs have killed civilians. At the crime scene, she runs into the Proxy. When her superiors try to make her think she hallucinated the incident, Re-l starts putting the pieces together between the Proxy and a man named Vincent Law.

Besides an interesting plot-line, Ergo Proxy has a very striking dark look to it. It does make some of the scenes hard to see, like the first couple minutes of the first episode, but over-all its very attractive. It's all complimented by an atmospheric soundtrack.",1170374400,25,1956,5.030864197530864

2652550,5,B000I2JSVW,"""Ergo Proxy"" is one of the most beautiful anime ever made. It's also very complex, filled with allusions mysterious and even more mysterious, obscure, opaque, a story about the search for self and meaning in a bleak post-apocalyptic world of domed cities, androids (""autoraves""), warfare, and death. The heroine, Real Mayar (also Re-l Mayer), is stunningly beautiful as she undertakes to unravel the mysteries of a killer freak as she befriends an oddly lonely immigrant named Vincent Law.

But, a warning: if you want cartoons that spell out all the details a la ""Hamtaro"" or ""Cinderella"", you will be bored witless and irritated by ""Ergo Proxy."" The premise is that the *viewer* also participates in Ergo Proxy's search for self and meaning. It is distinctly intellectual, in the sense of thoughtful: the viewer is *expected* to ponder over meaning, especially the meanings of identity and memory. Entire scenes exist solely to create analogies between what Real and Vincent do and the viewer's consensus (although false) beliefs about reality. ""Ergo Proxy"" operates in the interstices of such realities, in sepia, gray, and icy blue images of radical incompleteness.

Visually, Ergo Proxy has only rarely been equaled in animation. It has a hard-to-describe kind of lyrical bleakness offset by Real's beauty - which is just one of the contradictions that suffuse the story. If you want everything telegraphed by the middle of episode 1, watch something else. But for a depiction of what used to be called ""existential"" search, ""Ergo Proxy"" is superb - vivid, gorgeous, lots of action scenes, all in a world that we recognize as our own.",1169769600,41,1639,5.111940298507463
2652551,5,B000I2JSVW,"This is an awesome show, great animation and so on,  plan on getting the rest soon.",1168646400,,83,4.1875
2652552,4,B000I2JSVW,"Ergo Proxy is very stylish, very well drawn, and features a wonderful soundtrack and beautiful voices. This anime continues the growing trend of hiring English dub actors who can actually act, and the result is a dub easily on par with Ghost in the Shell or Fullmetal Alchemist. Character design and general production design is drop-dead gorgeous, with a wonderful use of color and just enough stylizing to be distinct, but not garish. It's just refreshing to see an anime that does not follow the trend towards bland homogeneity in character design (as seen in Scrapped Princess, Mai-HIME, and so on) these days, so right there it has an edge over most of the other anime being released Stateside these days.

So where does it go wrong? What keeps it out of the pantheon of Great Anime, where it would stand beside the likes of Cowboy Bebop and Neon Genesis Evangelion?

Mainly, the problem is with the characters and their ability to support the story. I'm only 4 episodes in, which isn't enough time to start making firm judgments about either, but it the show certainly gets off to a rough start as far as writing is concerned.

The main character, Re-I Mayer, is not badly written, she just seems flat. Her dialog is strong, and she shows some refreshing vulnerability under stress, but so far almost nothing has been revealed about what her personal life was like before the events of the series begins turning it upside down. Who are her friends? Did she join the Intelligence Bureau because she wanted to, or because of family pressure? Her grandfather is the Regent of the city (which is sort of like being mayor, but a lot creepier), but we don't know anything about her parents. Because she only interacts with other humans in a professional capacity, we have not yet seen her in an unguarded moment. She is shown to be bored and dissatisfied with her life before she stumbles across the Proxy case, but why this drives her so strongly to investigate the Proxy, even to the determent of her career, isn't made clear. We can see that she has a very strong motivation, but it is difficult to understand what it is.

The other primary character so far is an immigrant to the city named Vincent Law who is struggling to get accepted as a citizen. His motivation is much easier to grasp, but a lack of screen time in the first volume means his backstory hasn't made much of an appearance yet. Towards the end of the volume he displays some intriguing promise to develop further as the series goes on with a flash of unexpected aggression. Hopefully the story will slow down enough for him to show some emotional state other than professionally repressed, cringing in terror, or confused and delirious.

The weakness of the characters is not unforgivable- certainly they are no worse than Ghost in the Shell, and there is plenty of time for them to grow and gain depth- but right out of the gate they just don't grab me as strongly as some other series I've seen. The main reason this problem sticks out is because the story- so far- is interesting, but not anything special or unique. It's a dystopian future with plenty of economic inequity and hints of a grand government/corporate conspiracy, complete with a military research project gone horribly wrong. Stories with robots gaining self-awareness, corporate police states, and ecological catastrophes have all been done before. This story doesn't break any new ground, but it does go over already-known territory very, very well.

Again, I stress that with only Volume 1 out at this time, final judgments about the series cannot be made. I certainly enjoyed the episodes I've seen, and I'll pick up Volume 2 as soon as it comes out. It is generally a high quality show, and lacks a lot of distinctive anime weirdness, making it one of the most accessible series to mainstream audiences to be released in years.

Bottom line: Volume 1 was quite good, but Ergo Proxy isn't a classic yet.",1167091200,5,3947,4.728197674418604
2652553,4,B000I2JSVW,"One of the most overused conventions in science fiction is the future world of semi-apocalyptic ruin where the privileged few dwell in wealthy splendor in a domed city while most of the population is segregated outside its walls in a brutal bid for survival. Lots of times the rich class has either robotic servants or gentically modified slaves or even clones. Or course, this structure is analogous to the current world situation between the haves and havenots. The saying goes that ""All men are equal, but some are more equal than others."" That's basically what you have in Ergo Proxy. You have a domed city named Romdo whose citizens are safeguarded by a dome that keeps out the wasteland with its deadly diseases and undesirable humans. The people within are served by robots called ""AutoReivs"". But a problem has arisen in the form of the ""Cogito Virus"", which infects robots with a rogue program which makes them self-aware as individuals which inevitably leads to them rebelling against their masters. The show revolves around three main characters. First, there's Re-L Mayer, an investigator for the Intelligence Bureau, who has been called in to handle cases having to do with AutoReivs murdering humans. Even though she is the daughter of the ruler of the city, she finds that are a lot of things going on in the city that she knows nothing about. For example, you have some very powerful creatures resembling humanoid monsters running around killing people and seem to be especially interested in new immigrant Vincent Law. Raul Creed, chief of Security for Romdo knows what these creatures, called ""Proxies"" are and he's trying to capture them without raising too much of a fuss in public.

I didn't like this show at first, mainly because of the animation. It seemed like the staff spent so much on the ""look"" of the show that they didn't have a lot of money left to animate it. Another aspect I didn't like was its over reliance on cliched sci-fi conventions. I mean, the Appleseed movie last year dealt with all these themes and had a very similar plot. The characterization is what furnished a way into Ergo Proxy for me, particularly the characters of Re-L and Vincent. Lest I forget, there's this cute little robot girl named Pino who might just steal the show from the rest of the cast and seems modeled after the lead in Serial Experiments Lain. Even though you feel like you're watching a painting at times, this first volume of Ergo Proxy is an excellent beginning to a show that promises loads of mysteries and action.",1166745600,3,2542,4.80365296803653
2652554,5,B000I2JSVW,"The beginning is extremely confusing with the characters making references to their own world, of which we know nothing in the beginning, and the darkness of the setting shrouds much of their actions. As the story continues, we learn that science is researching a creature called Proxy, which apparently was not man-made. We see this world as being one of routine, discouraging individuality, and only accepting immigrants if they choose to comply with crushing their 'self'.

Vincent Law is one such immigrant, and it is made clear within the first three episodes that he is a key character, along with Real.

The series contains a lot of symbolism, historical references, religious comparisons, along with a plot just complicated enough to confuse unless close attention is payed. A lot like a musical, the scenes which Vincent is forced to come to terms with his 'Self' are key in the movement of the story, and cannot be ignored. Ergo Proxy contains a lot of theorizing that stretches for entire episodes, and would become boring to someone who cannot sit through it. Think the end of 'Evangelion', minus repetitive dialogue. It's convoluted at times, and often has foot notes at the end of an episode when almost composed entirely of character development.

The animation is very similar to Ghost in the Shell, but it can hardly be compared in terms of story--It's dramatically different, and the fight scenes are lacking, but not at all necessary to the enjoyment.

Ergo Proxy requires patience, as it doesn't throw you in to the story immediately. It's air of mystery with its introduction to Ergo Proxy's world, keeps you wondering just long enough before it finally sends you reeling with plot and action, and really, there's a just enough of everything to satisfy the pickiest of anime collectors.

The whole thing blew me away.",1166745600,6,1838,4.973941368078176
