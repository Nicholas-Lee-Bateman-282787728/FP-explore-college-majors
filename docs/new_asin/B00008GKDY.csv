1846258,4,B00008GKDY,"My daughter (4) love the Angelina shows. I find her-Angelina-a bit whiney and conniving. They all seem a bit melodramatic, but as I say, mine loves it. The only problem I really have with the DVD is the lack of menu: the disc just starts up with the trailers-including Barney (ugh)-and on to the shows. A small thing but disorienting. Even I can make a DVD with a menu.",1114560000,4,369,4.36231884057971

7983733,5,B00008GKDY,"My 4-year-old is just beginning to get interested in ballet and dance and the Angelina Ballerina stories and DVDs provide loads of inspiration whilst serving to entertain at the same time.

There are 4 episodes altogether [12 mins each] - ""The Lucky Penny"" [Angelina learns the value of practice], ""The legend of Big Paw"" [Angelina, cousin Henry and dad go camping], ""Angelina and Anya"" [Angelina learns not to make assumptions about people] , and ""The Gymnastics Competition"" [Angelina's best friend Alice learns to overcome her fear and build confidence in order to master the balance beam]

The animated stories remain faithful to the source material by Katharine Holabird, and retain the original illustrations by Helen Craig. The quality of the animation is above average, lending an almost real-life quality to the little mice, and the language is clear [British accent is used here]. In between the animated episodes, there are scenes of actual dance lessons, either ballet, folk or others.

I'd highly recommend the Angelina Ballerina series of DVDs to aspiring young dancers, those who love immersing themselves in a world inhabited by adorable little mice and this is probably suited to preschoolers and up.",1240790400,,1217,5.230769230769231
