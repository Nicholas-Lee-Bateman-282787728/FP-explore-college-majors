3523259,5,B001D2WUCK,"Home Movies is one of the most smart immature clever animated comedy I have seen in the last 20 years. I have no problem watching this show at any time. That is why I currently have the individual DVD season sets. But I don't have that awesome box it comes with, or the canvas bag, nor the directors clapboard. I love Home Movies so much, I will most likely just give my old DVD's to friends and win them over. To put a close to this review of mine, watch Home Movies.",1220832000,25,468,4.0978260869565215
3523346,5,B001D2WUCK,"I kind of totally debated on buying this cause it's expensive and do I really need a big box of a show I watched when I was a kid?

Then I realized ""yes I really want this"", caved in, and bough it. I'm still really glad that I bought it, it's like one of the coolest sort of ""box sets"" that I've seen for quite some time and I kind of was totally hyped when I got it and saw the other times like the tote bag.",1471996800,,409,3.7011494252873565

3523535,5,B001D2WUCK,"I love everything about this set. I have loved Home Movies since I first saw it about 15 years ago. I am a big fan of Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist, and I was so excited that H. John Benjamin was in this show. This show made me a fan of Brendon Small (I love Metalocalypse!) and Loren Bouchard (I love Bob's Burgers!). It is fun to hear so many familiar voices on Bob's Burgers that I remember from this show. I am excited about all of the special features and I love the Coach McGuirk bag!",1440028800,,493,4.145833333333333

3523538,5,B001D2WUCK,"then IT'S TIME TO PAY THE PRICE! A great box set for a phenomenal show. It was delivered earlier than expected and was in great condition (one very small ding). I'm a long-time huge fan so I'm really glad to finally own the physical copies of the DVDs, and it comes with things you can't get anywhere else (as far as I know). In the box are the DVDs, a 52 song album, TONS of commentary with different cast members on the DVDs, an awesome Wizard of Oz themed box, a Home Movies director's clapboard, and a McGuirk tote bag. What more could a fan ask for? Aside from bringing back one of the greatest comedies ever on television... (T-T)",1421452800,2,636,4.308333333333334

Brendon Small is amazing.  Just get it.

Not since Thor Von Clemson have we seen such fine work.",1394755200,,125,4.125
3523602,5,B001D2WUCK,"I love all the ""extra"" bonus you get with this set; special features with commentary tracks, interviews, animatics, and animation galleries.  You also get a bonus CD with Home Movies Music!",1377129600,,189,5.096774193548387
3523603,5,B001D2WUCK,"I'm biased, as this is one of my favourite TV shows ever - having it all in one DVD set makes me very happy. I certainly wouldn't be buying it for the bag or clapper though - both are pretty average.",1376524800,,199,3.8780487804878048
3523604,5,B001D2WUCK,Tote bag and marker make an excellent addition to a hilarious tv series I loved as a child. Thanks so much.,1369785600,,107,4.142857142857143

3523606,5,B001D2WUCK,"If you're a huge fan of Home Movies, such as myself, than this set works great. The DVDs are in great condition, the case works great, thought the extras aren't needed (mine are still in the box) they're a bit of fun.",1353542400,,217,4.190476190476191
3523607,5,B001D2WUCK,"Home Movies is my favorite cartoon and never fails to cheer me up when I need it. The Coach McGuirk tote is a bit tacky (kind of like a mini version of the cheap grocery bags they sell now), but other than that the presentation's cute and I'm sure I'll be enjoying this purchase for years to come.",1353024000,,297,4.137931034482759
3523608,5,B001D2WUCK,"Love me some Home Movies.  This grossly underrated series should have stayed on the air much longer.  The ensemble cast of Brendan Small, John Benjamin, Melissa Galsky, and Loren Bourchard deliver a consistently funny product with a unique feel.  A must for any fan.  Though the price is a bit high for a tv box set, these guys deserve and have earned the money.  It's time to pay the price!",1335398400,,391,4.5285714285714285
3523609,5,B001D2WUCK,"This series is very cleaver, creative and funny.  In my opinion the peripheral characters are the key to success of the humor.  The main character Brendon is surrounded by numerous main supporting characters including the Coach, Melissa, Jason and Paula, but there are numerous others that have funny recurring roles - Walter and Perry, Mr. Lynch, Felton, and others.  Reminds me of an animated version of Seinfeld in that supportive characters play major roles in the show and they are funny.",1325289600,,493,5.061728395061729
3523610,5,B001D2WUCK,"this show is just beautiful... from the hilarious first episode right to the masturful and touching finale. just beautiful. fullstop. i won't go into my opinions any more, if your considering purchasing this set then you have probably already drawn positive conclusions.

whats important is that this is the only complete boxset there is of the show, the dvds are very well laid out, and the cover box is very attractive. the picture and audio quality is very good, it holds up equally well on both my 27"" pc monitor and my projector. at the $55 i spent on amazon it was an absolute steal.

my only gripes are the bonus gifts - a small black tote bag with a coach mcguirk logo? completely useless and unattractive - it may as well have come with a free plastic kroger bag. and the wooden directors clap - kind of a neat idea i suppose, i don't take an issue with it as such - except that its very poorly made and fell apart as i was taking it out of the box. but there could surely have been better things to give? maybe a plush doll of one of Brendan? or a few cheap plastic figures to put on a shelf somewhere? even some stickers?... or just not include them and have a smaller box that fits the dvds more snuggly and economically.

but whatever, im not going to take a star off because the freebies are stupid, if you buy this for anything other than the actual show then its a waste of money. if you buy it for the show then its a complete steal and will give you many hours of unparallelled video enjoyment. buy it.",1323561600,3,1520,4.270833333333333
3523611,5,B001D2WUCK,"I love home movies. I use the bag to go play football (aka soccer) so I take coach mcguirk advice with me every time hahaha :P. The music, the episodes incredible. The makers of this series are wonderfuly talented.",1315699200,,214,4.512820512820513
3523692,5,B001D2WUCK,"This is going to sound crazy but I have to get this set even though I have the the individual seasons already.
  I love the show that much and everytime I watch it I notice a little something that I missed on the previous viewing.  This is a great price for the entire set and would look forward to carry the ""Coach McGuirk tote""",1313539200,,329,4.109375
3523693,5,B001D2WUCK,This hands down the best way to buy this show! You get everything and sometimes you can get it for under $60,1306108800,,108,3.9545454545454546
3523694,5,B001D2WUCK,this was the greatest gift i could get my boyfriend (especially since i benefit directly from it too). it looks really great in the case and is just all in all awesome!,1298073600,,168,4.28125
3523695,5,B001D2WUCK,This show ended a while ago but I started watching it on adult swin when I was a freshman in high school. I am now in my third year of college and I still watch it season after season. Recently adult swim stopped playing it so I have to get the box set!!  It is such a huge part of my life. I can recite lines verbatim! Any one who is a Home Movies fan should have this.,1295222400,,370,3.7435897435897436
3523696,4,B001D2WUCK,Bought this for our daughter and she has watched it everyday during winter break.  She will probably bring it back to college with her.,1294185600,3,135,4.625
3523697,4,B001D2WUCK,"The only reason I purchased this set was that it would have cost more to buy each season individually. The bag and clapboard are both made in China. Bag is decent quality whereas the clapboard is not. The top half of it merely slides into the bottom half. Very cheap! Everything else is the same as the individual seasons including the music c.d. that is surprisingly good. If you are a Home Movies fan and want the complete series, then this is for you. Just don't be surprised when you see the clapboard!",1290902400,11,506,4.451612903225806
3523698,5,B001D2WUCK,"as a home movies fan since the first episode, i was super excited to see the whole season for such a great price! the tote bag is very cute, and the box looks great on my movies shelf :) love it!",1285718400,,195,3.7804878048780486
3523699,5,B001D2WUCK,"If you're even looking at purchasing this item, you probably should. Every Home Movies episode, a CD with all the songs from the series and a sweet carrying bag with Coach McGuirk on it. To those of you unfamiliar with the series. Definitely a necessity for the kool-aid drinking, Home Movie fans.",1282953600,,297,4.730769230769231
3523700,5,B001D2WUCK,"I bought this set as a mutual anniversary present, and it was great!  My fiance and I are big fans of Brendan Small, and we've always enjoyed Home Movies, and this came with every episode, some bonus material, and a CD featuring all the music from the series.  I could not have been happier with the purchase.  I would strongly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Brendan Small or to anyone who just enjoys good comedy.  Five stars, all the way through.",1262995200,3,458,4.352941176470588
3523701,4,B001D2WUCK,"I enjoyed watching this DVD series.  It is one of my favorite TV shows.  It's pretty funny; not overly sophisticated but not stupid humor.  The special features were alright, if you're a real big fan of the show.  I only watched some of them because it became a bit repetitive after a bit, since there really are a LOT of special features.  Each disc has maybe about 45 minutes worth on average, some have considerably more.

The box itself was nice and durable.  The DVD cases are a bit thin and mushy but they're plastic so they should stay intact for a long time.  The clapboard was surprisingly well made.  I was expecting something cheapo or even cardboard but it's made out of some kind of hard plastic or something I think, can't remember exactly.  The bag is alright for what it is.  Mostly felt like one of those cloth bags you get form the grocery store for $1 to carry your groceries in.  Probably alright for carrying a few light things, but I wouldn't use it for anything long-term or particularly heavy.  They sorta make sense for this TV show, but I would've liked something a bit more useful like a mug or a mousepad or something like that.

The DVDs themselves were reasonably good quality.  The first season had that kinda motion blur interlace effect when I was watching it on the computer that was only correctable by halving the resolution.  I suppose that's not an issue for people watching on CRT televisions.  The last 3 seasons were nice and sharp, though.  No interlacing effects and the lines were clean and defined.",1258156800,21,1543,4.569343065693431
3523702,5,B001D2WUCK,"For those who already know what a clever and endearing show Home Movies is, this is a perfect gift. I gave this to my boyfriend for his birthday, and we couldn't wait to watch every episode from start to finish. I wish I had known about this before buying one of the individual seasons. We've not gotten to enjoy all of the special features yet, but I'm sure we'll be enjoying this set for years.",1251417600,27,396,4.293333333333333
3523703,5,B001D2WUCK,"Home Movies is by far my favourite show on tv. its hilarious, witty, and fun to watch at any time of the day.
I cant get enough of Coach McGuirk. arguably everyones favourite character. My friends and I find ourselves quoting him about 50% of the time we talk. And the goodies inside are great. A must buy for any Home Movies fan and collector. Highly recommended.",1251244800,2,364,4.447761194029851
3523704,5,B001D2WUCK,"Title says it all.  The bag is of surprisingly good quality, however the actual box itself leaves something to be desired.  A great cartoon.",1244592000,5,140,4.791666666666667
3523705,5,B001D2WUCK,"Home Movies is classic humor that reaches many levels.  My teenagers love it for the humor is finds in surprisingly realistic life situations - Brendan's dad getting re-married; an overbearing school administrator; being profiled on a local news channel; and on and on.  A couple of weeks will go by and we will be reminded of a scene in Home Movies that will make us laugh all over again....with this set we can go back and watch whenever we want.  We already use several catch phrases we have grabbed from scenes in some of the best episodes, not the least of which is: ""Its time to pay the price.""  The episode(s) where the kids go back and review some of the titles of the Home Movies they have made is pure genius. ('Jesus-zilla: Son of God-zilla').  And Brendan renaming his current production ""Movie History"" so when someone asks, he can say he is making 'movie history'.",1240531200,31,878,4.602564102564102

3523707,5,B001D2WUCK,Love Home Movies and this box set was perfect.  The box it comes in is great for storage.  I bought it as a gift for my boyfriend but love it myself too.  The order came promptly and I even got free shipping!,1231891200,,208,3.9047619047619047
3523708,5,B001D2WUCK,"If you don't wanna wake up at extremely early morning and a fan of this great series, Why not get this? This 10th anniversary set contains The complete show. Its great now that I don't have to wake up at 4am in the morning to watch this and Now I can watch my favorite characters (Couch Mcguirk, Perry and walter, and Jason) when ever I have free time. 100 dollors worth spent.",1230508800,2,377,4.25
3523709,5,B001D2WUCK,"$100 is a lot to spend on any show, but Home Movies is something you can watch over and over again.  Comes neatly packaged with a clapboard, handbag, and bonus cd.  If anything could be better I would maybe say instead of the handbag to have something people would actually use, I mean I love Coach Mcguirk but I don't think I will ever be able to find a use for a handbag.  Buy this set if you love Home Movies, its got it all.",1230249600,2,428,4.011764705882353
3523710,5,B001D2WUCK,"Well I know I do not own this yet.  I still however am giving it 5 stars.  This is one of the funniest shows I have ever seen.  I remember seeing it one day at like 1 in the morning and the squiggle of the lines made me sick.  But as I watched it I got used to it and soon came to think of it as one of my favorites.  Plus the squiggles went awa in the second season I think.  The humor stayed though.

  Some may ask why?  Why buy it if you already have the seasons by themselves?  Well I collect cartoon stuff.  I am only 23 and just started but I know that this will be a great collection to add.  The exrta stuff in the set is worth buying it for alone.  Even the case that it all comes in.  Also, the soundtrack is a cool thing to add.

In the end it comes down to this.  I think any fan of Home Movies will like this set for any or all of the reasons I have listed above.  Plus it is SUCH a good price!",1225411200,4,908,3.6649214659685865
