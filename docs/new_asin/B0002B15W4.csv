8025360,5,B0002B15W4,Carlin and  Buddy Ebson at their best (Stiller in a break-out role).  Leslie Hope is also terrific.  And the direction by Alan Metter is spot-on.  The supporting roles really work - Michael Pollard and others.  Music terrific.  What's not to like?  Really excellent film for family or anyone.  Fun night out!,1518134400,,308,4.901960784313726
8025361,5,B0002B15W4,"This is a very funny movie. I really like this movie. Ben Stiller is hilarious and George Carlin has this gentle puppy dog way of talking that is very funny. The guys he owes money to are threatening to kill him, at the start of the movie. ""That will teach you a lesson! "" says his wife. ""Rosie, death is not a lesson. It is more like a final exam,"" answers George Carlin. The story is great, the characters work well to make a satisfying movie.
It is a very intelligent movie, that is inspiring to watch. Just the title makes you think outside the box, and so does the movie. Ben gets the girl, and this small group of janitors turns around a deceitful situation with a lot of heart, and street smarts, and always with a low key wry humor that pokes fun at everybody and ultimately wins the day.",1423180800,,796,4.243421052631579
