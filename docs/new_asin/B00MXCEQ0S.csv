8675249,5,B00MXCEQ0S,D'ORA is a very realistic representation about a social phenomenon in the post Cold War times in Europe - MIGRATION. A young Romanian women drama in her way to a new world (to London) is the central element of this film. The subject is very well built around the difficult situations where she passes. A true story made for understanding the new configuration of Europe.,1433289600,2,370,4.707692307692308

8675254,1,B00MXCEQ0S,"One star is way to high grade for this called ""movie"".  It presents such a false image of Romania. It is a lost of time to watch it. I  lived out of the country ( different continent too) for the last 10 years, and I have nothing but wonderful memories about my birth country. The level of civilization it is higher than the one presented on this movie. I can not understand why a Romanian would want to create such a bad image about their own country...",1413763200,4,454,4.206896551724138
