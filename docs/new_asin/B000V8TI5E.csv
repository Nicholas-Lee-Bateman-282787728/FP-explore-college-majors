Personally, I thought he was the best part of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crouching-Tiger-Hidden-Dragon/dp/B00003CXR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</a>, and it was his peformance in this film that drew me to purchase ""The Go Master.""  I am not disappointed.

The cinematography is truly outstanding, and you are captivated by the beauty on the screen.  Some very nicely captured moments enhance--one might assert ""make""--a film that seems to purposefully strive to provide a contemplative or meditative viewing experience.  It is slow moving in this regard, but it is clearly intentional. Music also draws the viewer into the calm intensity of the film and adds a nice touch to many scenes.  But though the senses can be elevated in watching ""The Go Master,""  the intellect is left somewhat unsatisfied.  Plot and script are a little thin.  Wu is ""dedicated to truth and Go,"" which suggests a deeper meaning to what is a board game, but a deeper philosophy is not really revealed in the film except through some early references to ""God"" and Wu's ""gift,"" and his later involvement with a religious cult whose religious tenets are opaque to most Western viewers' minds. What exactly is the the relationship between Wu's faith and the game?  Certainly a little more information would have made for a better movie and given more depth to Wu's character and integrated him more fully with his ideals and life fulfilling activity.  Instead, his involvement with the Jiu Keyou (the primary religious force in his life)seems antagonistic and antithetical, especially after its corrupting tendencies are revealed, and you are left a little puzzled by his efforts to incorporate the sect into either his desire for truth or to play Go.  In short, despite being a ""biopic,"" the film leaves its primary interest curiously ill-defined and somwhat shallow.  No amount of fine acting and pretty scenery can make up for the shortfalls in  this film's narrative.  However, it is still a very good effort and highly recommended.",1246752000,4,2157,5.340236686390533
8217251,3,B000V8TI5E,"I started playing go in 1969, by when Go Seigen was already retired in practice. Accordingly, I have always thought of him as a historical figure, and when watching this DVD was surprised to find that he was still alive.

Most players would regard Go Seigen as the greatest go player of the twentieth century. This DVD provides a faithful and eminently watchable documentary of his life, with English subtitles. However, it left me feeling depressed, with its coverage of the hardships suffered by so many Japanese during the militarism of the 1930's and the catastrophe of World War 2. This provides the backdrop to Go Seigen's personal suffering, with his glittering career being ended by injuries from a motorcycle accident in 1961.

Despite its gloominess, I would recommend the DVD to every lover of go.",1243641600,5,808,4.9338235294117645
