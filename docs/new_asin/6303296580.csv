7843315,5,6303296580,"I could only wish this 3 part series was on DVD now. It was informative and inspiring. Because of the beauty and the history presented in these videos, I was able to visit many of the locations on my first trip to Britain. They are even more amazing in person. The background that this series gave me allowed me to have a better experience where I traveled and helped me look for the more special places and treasures. John Julius Norwich brought the houses to life. Don't miss this series!",1351641600,,490,4.455555555555556
