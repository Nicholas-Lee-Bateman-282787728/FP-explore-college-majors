Thats what I like about my Happy Days collection. Even at the tender age of 10, I was hooked on this show. I was constantly wishing I was a teenager in the 1950's. What a wonderful world the cunninghams lived in. Not to mention the fact that everyone wanted to be like ""The Fonz""",1240876800,25,419,4.526315789473684

3546133,5,B001E6FMMU,"Great to have them on DVD. These were the seasons I loved! Before the show's writers left over $$? Before the trip to Calif & the horrible jump the shark episode. Before Fonzie got so super human it just got stupid! Yes there are a few good episodes in seasons 5-10? Beside's the Girl's college dorm story. Where Richie & the Fonz are dressed up as woman. Only to have Potsie & Ralph show up for a girl's panty raid. The Mork from Ork episode. The return of Richie & Ralph Mouth, which wasn't all that funny or Happy either. One of the few newer episodes but was still disappointing. Was Fonzie's Ghost car/ Twilight Zone episode. About a old classic wreck he ends up with in his garage. That was said to be a 57 Chevy like one Fonzie once owned in his younger days? But wasn't even a 57 Chevy on the show! But a car looking more like Christine from the Stephen King movie. Happy Days should had ended with season 4 or 5. But this is simply my opinion. These were the best seasons to me.",1404432000,,987,4.2
3546134,1,B001E6FMMU,"I mean, I am absolutely FLABBERGASTED by the fact that so many reviewers have been giving this set 5 stars! Flabbergasted! What, people who buy this today don't care that the original classic Rock n Roll was replaced by bad imitations??? If ANY series was dependant on having the original music included, it would be ""happy days"", the music was as important as the actors are. They might as well have replaced Ron Howard and Henry Winkler with unknown actors who looked like them a little bit- or they might as well have simply re-filmed the whole series with other actors, unknown high school drama students who they didn't have to pay much for, they could have saved even more money than they did when they replaced all the classic rock n roll of Elvis, Richard, Chuck, and Bill Haley with tepid, bland cover versions that make me want to barf.

3546135,4,B001E6FMMU,"""Happy Days"" was on when I was in junior high school. There was nobody like ""the Fonz,"" the hoodlum with the heart of gold. Unlike the other boys, he seemed to have a rich life off-screen; in his frequent appearances, he always gave the impression of dropping in from wherever he was living his real life. Richie was the show's center: a boy on the cusp of manhood, tying together together the two worlds of the Cunningham family and the teenage universe of Ralph and Potsie and Arnold's diner.

One of the first ""nostalgia"" series, ""Happy Days"" had to take place in the 1950s. The 1960s were too recent, and too closely associated with hippies, drugs, the Vietnam War - hardly ""happy days."" The 1940s were dominated by the Second World War, the 1930s by the Depression, and the 1920s were too distant. Oddly, the 20s were the same distance in the past in the 70s as the early 1960s are now. I remember a friend in high school, my own age, assuring me that the early 60s were ""boring, boring, boring."" Now,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mad-Men/dp/B000YABIQ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mad Men</a>&nbsp;has taught us that they weren't boring at all - they were as exciting as any period can be, a time of transition against a backdrop of mid-century modern design. The real ""boring"" period in the popular culture is the late 1940s - presumably, nothing happened between V.J. Day and 1950 - the vets all went to college on the G.I. Bill, bought houses, and started families.  World War Two so dominated that decade, that little things like the establishment of the State of Israel, the Nuremburg Trials, and the start of the Cold War barely merit mention in the popular culture.

""Happy Days"" had none of the elan of ""Mad Men;"" the fashions were willfully geeky, the dcor nondescript. Jammed as it was between two cataclysmic decades, the 50s were shown as a peaceful time, when the girls were pure, the chrome was thick, and a working man could live a decent middle-class life. This idyll existed only in the imagination - anyone who actually lived through the period would remember the Red scare, the fear of nuclear annihilation, and the social issues bubbling barely beneath the surface, on the verge of explosion. But the imaginary idyll is what people think of when a politician talks about returning America to a simpler, more honest time. It was a time when minorities knew their place, men and women occupied distinct roles, and the most exotic ethnic group was our new friends, the Japanese. Homosexuals pretended to be straight, and everyone else pretended to believe them. And maybe if you were a white, middle-class kid in Milwaukee, like Richie Cunningham, it really was ""happy days.""

I am sure I remember Howard Cunningham saying something about being in ""the war"" one time. What war was that, I wonder? We can assume that Richie was born sometime in the late thirties; Howard must have been born in the early teens, making him too young for World War One, and too old for World War Two. I can find no evidence of any war the U.S. was involved in between the withdrawal from the Siberian campaign of 1920, and the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941. Maybe Howard was an officer.

A few episodes stand out. In one, Joanie falls in love with Potsie, of all people, and writes him notes that he thinks are from a ""secret admirer."" The notes refer to him as a ""dren,"" the opposite of a ""nerd."" When the meeting finally takes place, Potsie first assumes that his friends have played a trick on him, and breaks poor Joanie's little heart. But by the next episode, like Ellie in Thomas Mann's ""Disorder and Early Sorrow,"" Joanie will be fine again.

In another, Richie meets a group of beatniks who are passing through, and is smitten by one of the girls, an aspiring poet (""Little bird, there is no birdseed for you today, only...death""). Like Siddhartha leaving home to join the Samanas, Richie is prepared to abandon his life and follow these free spirits. When, at the moment of departure, he learns that the girl is done with the beatnik life, and is now going to Omaha to work as a secretary in an accounting firm (or whatever it was), Richie sorrowfully returns home. We do wonder what happened to Richie after the series ended - I like to imagine that he grew up to be Ken Cosgrove.

I stopped watching after the fourth season, so I missed the iconic ""jumping the shark"" episode, and the ones with Robin Williams as ""Mork."" I am especially sorry to have missed the one where a young Alan Greenspan, played by an even younger Steven Seagal, kidnaps Joanie and forces her to join his group of Ayn Rand disciples (Ayn Rand, of course, played by David Prowse, who would gain fame a few years later as Darth Vader in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars-Episode-VI-Return-of-the-Jedi/dp/B00076SCPW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars, Episode VI: Return of the Jedi</a>&nbsp;in the famous ""Luke, I am your father"" scene when his helmet is removed). In its final season, ""Happy Days"" had some of its finest episodes, with critically-acclaimed adaptations of John Cheever stories. These included&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Swimmer/dp/B003TQAJMG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Swimmer</a>, where Fonzie, after swimming home through the neighborhood pools, arrives at the Cunningham house to find it empty, abandoned, and fallen into disrepair. In another, ""Metamorphoses,"" after Howard accidentally walks in on his boss while she is having sex with a co-worker, he returns home only to be torn limb from limb by the family dog. One of the most memorable of these, ""The Sorrows of Gin,""  had the Cunninghams hire a nanny, played by none other than Angie Dickinson, whose character drinks a quart of gin a day. The climax at the train station is unforgettable, as Dickinson gives the performance of her career of the drunk nanny crying over ""peaches and cream"" as she takes swigs from a bottle, shouting ""it's all I've got!""

The legacy of ""Happy Days"" is that it showed us the imaginary ""perfect"" America of the past, set in a decade when we can almost bring ourselves to believe that such things existed. This is what politicians are talking about when they demand that America return to the values of this period - as if ""Happy Days"" were a documentary, and their fuzzy memories of a television sitcom are conflated with actual events. I often wonder if the current conservative mythos would be different if ""Happy Days"" had instead concerned a family of migrant Latino farm workers in California, or an African-American family in Chicago during that same period. Or maybe a family of beatniks, wandering the country, with one episode in which one of the girls briefly considers staying in Milwaukee with a nice, clean-cut young boy named Richie.

Over the past few years, there has been a surge in movies based on beloved 1960s and 1970s television sitcoms, including The Brady Bunch, Bewitched, the Flying Nun, Gilligan's Island, Adam-12, The Man From U.N.C.L.E., and Meet the Press, to name a few. Can the ""Happy Days"" remake be too far behind? My sources indicate that it is already being filmed in 3-D, with an all-star cast including Jon Lovitz as Howard Cunningham, Rosie O'Donnell as Mrs. Cunningham, Macauley Culkin making his big comeback as Richie, Nikki Blonsky as Joanie, Jonah Hill as Potsie, Jon Heder (""Napoleon Dynamite"") as Ralph Malph, Justin Bieber as Fonzie, Russell Brand as Mork, and Ricky Gervais as the wisecracking, irreverent owner of the local diner. The plot reportedly involves a teen idol, played by Chris Crocker (""Leave Britney alone!"") who is stranded in town for a few days when his car breaks down and his chauffeur/bodyguard, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, goes missing. If it is anything like the original, this will be next summer's ""must-see"" blockbuster.

RON HOWARD (the perfectly cast OPIE TAYLOR of ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW fame) was equally effective as typical fifties era teenager RICHIE CUNNINGHAM, hanging out at Arnold's Drive-In with his best friends, gullible POTSIE WEBBER and jokester RALPH MALPH. Affable TOM BOSLEY and twinkle eyed MARION ROSS played the most likeable parents since LEAVE IT TO BEAVER, with ERIN MORAN getting her licks in as bratty kid sister JOANIE. The show's breakout star/eventual focal point was leather-jacketed, motorcycle riding King of Cool ARTHUR ""FONZIE"" FONZARELLI (HENRY WINKLER), who mostly stayed in the background during the first two (and best) seasons. Armed with snappy theme songs (notably, BILL HALEY's ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK), a knack for successful spin offs like LAVERNE & SHIRLEY and MORK & MINDY, and nostalgic charm, HAPPY DAYS was a hallmark of seventies TV viewing.
