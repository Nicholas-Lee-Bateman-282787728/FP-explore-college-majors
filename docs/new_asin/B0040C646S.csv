8412287,5,B0040C646S,"Kay Francis mother and her sisters' favorite actress  I can see why: she's gorgeous, so thin and wears the greatest outfits of the day, This story will break your heart in two-- giving up a baby and never ever forgetting that child.  George Brent always an excellent accessory.",1455840000,,277,4.75
8412288,5,B0040C646S,Love Kay Francis.  Good movie.,1447718400,,30,5.0
8412289,5,B0040C646S,Kay Francis way too underrated and not so forgotten is lovely in character and in her performance.  NO one but no one wore clothes better or was more beautiful than this lady.  Gorgeous George Brent as the husband is handsome and dashing.  A mother's love shines in this movie.  Roland Young is darling as the man of reason who saves their marriage.  Kudos for a great movie.,1414195200,4,375,4.537313432835821
8412290,5,B0040C646S,THIS IS A VERY GOOD MOVIE.  I HAVE BECOME A MOVIE BUFF OF  CLASSIC MOVIES AND SUCH  A DELIGHT TO FIND ON AMAZON.  KAY FRANCIS AND GEORGE BRENT ARE GOOD IN JUST ABOUT EVERY MOVIE THEY HAVE PLAYED IN.,1405209600,4,198,4.0
8412291,4,B0040C646S,"It is amazing that Kay Francis was such a hugely important star in her day and now almost forgotten. She is always fun to watch, with her distinctive speech ""impediment"", huge eyes and admirable way of carrying the often outr fashions of the era. This is heavy melodrama but kinda gorgeous too. The theme; the ascendancy of the mother instinct above all else may be a bit sentimental for today's cynical audience, but hey, I cried at the end!",1387065600,7,442,4.6075949367088604
8412292,5,B0040C646S,Kay Francis is wonderful.  She definitely did not get enough recognition in her movie career.  She's wonderful in everything I have seen.,1383782400,4,137,5.181818181818182
8412293,4,B0040C646S,"Based on the play Sweet Aloes, and old fashioned in a fairly good way, a grand cast makes it a more than pleasant experience. Kay Francis, George Brent, Roland Young, Henry Stephenson and Frieda Inescort are so likable, made me wish I knew them. The Warners Archive disc is okay, not more than that. But  its shortcomings almost add to the charm. Now, that is ridiculous, but my true sentiment.",1324166400,11,394,4.628571428571429
