1066954,1,6305616027,"I used to watch the cartoon in the 80's as a kid, I loved it, but the elements that made me love it aren't in the film.  In fact you wonder if those who made this ever watched an episode.  Gadget wasn't the hero of the TV series, it was his niece Penny and her dog Brain who saved Gadget's life, the day and thwarted Dr Claw's evil plan each episode.  Gadget of course thought he did, but we the viewer knew.  In this movie remake, Penny and Brain don't do much at all, neither look or act like the characters from the cartoon.  Penny doesn't even have pig tails or yellow hair, she's not even blonde to try and come close with a natural hair colour.  They don't communicate with each other by TV watches (except in the credits where for some reason they got Don Adams to be the voice of Brain who hadn't talked or even acted like a non real world dog in the actual movie).  Instead the movie has the Gadget Mobile no longer resembling the transforming into a police car one from the cartoon, but instead some convertible from the ghettos with some Chris Rock style talking voice fulfills that roll.  This car is also fitted with Coca Cola beverage advertisements and Mars company candy such as Skittles.

No one else looked liked the characters either.  M.A.D. is called Sanford Industries or something stupid, and Dr. Claw sounds, looks and behaves nothing like the guy whose face we never saw in the cartoon.  We see his face hear in this one as some well groomed business man type. He never speaks the famous ""I'll get you next time Gadget, next time! line, and M.A.D. Cat, well it is just as unrecognisable as its character and just as much as regular cat and Brain is a dog in this one.

This one is an origin story for how Inspector Gadget came to be full of gadgets.  Basically he was a security guard who keeps getting rejected from the police force in this one.  He has a run in with Dr Claw where Dr Claw's hand is smashed and Robocop style Gadget is pretty much dead but can be saved by this experimental new technology and body.  If you're going to remake a classic cartoon into a film with actors, you've got to at least stick with the main elements of the cartoon.  The movie only goes for 67 minutes (the DVD cover will tell you it's 76).",1478908800,,2254,4.305687203791469

1066956,1,6305616027,"I loved inspector gadget as a kid. This movie does a disservice to the franchise. Penny was, at best, sidelined, whereas in the show she was crucial to the plot. Matthew Broderick could have been good as gadget, but too much of the movie was spent making corny jokes that addressed either the audience, or addressed the fact they were in a movie directly.

Add to this the terrible choice of plotline, and the ridiculousness of origin story, and this movie was downright painful to watch.",1477612800,2,488,4.674418604651163

1067437,2,6305616027,"Heres a movie that is aimed for five year-old kids. I suspect most adults will find it silly. I only bought it because I knew it was filmed in Pittsburgh, and as a native Pittsburgher, I wanted to see the city on film. And there are many great shots of the city.

1067521,1,6305616027,"Ok, this film's been out for a while so most of it's many flaws are well known.  Basically, the movie took a much beloved cartoon from the 80's and trashed it in a way the world wouldn't see again untill '07s Transformers. On the plus side, most of the movie's missteps failed to stick to the series as a whole, with one notable exception: The Gadgetmobile. As a fan of the classic series I detest the new ""improved"" street talking Gadgetmobile with a fiery passion usually reserved for home invaders and neo-Nazis. It's that bad. And it's carried over into future Gadget projects like a sickly infection, the direct to DVD sequel (which I can't bring myself to watch) and a handfull of otherwise promising animated features.
I almost skipped out on seeing Pirates of the Carribean because of how bad this Disney live action film was.  The good news is that the original show is now coming out on DVD and should provide the go-go-gadget brain scrubber needed to erase this unholy mess from my mind. I still feel guilty all these years later for dragging my sister and girlfriend to see this thing when it first came out, convinced that anything with the Gadget name on it had to be good.

The 2nd film however does a poor job of connecting with the first film. So what if it has cheesy jokes, and so what if it didn't do great in the box office. Sometimes you just need to ignore what the critic's think of it. What really matters is what you think of it. I loved the comedy in this. Even though some of the jokes may be twisted for younger viewers. Despite that I still give it 5 stars.

1067611,1,6305616027,"A voice over in a commercial for reruns of the Inspector Gadget cartoon once stated ""he's the original RoboCop.""  This cartoon had a kick@$$ theme song and Don Adams of ""Get Smart"" was perfectly cast as the voice of the bumbling mechanical detective.

Now for the movie review, where I do I even begin?  It's painfully obvious Disney hasn't got much talent or creativity as far as updating a retro cartoon to keep up with the times.  First they gave us a movie adaptation of Inspector Gadget followed by Underdog a few years later.  Neither one of these movies can match the witty and clever nostalgia of these two animated series.

Wowsers... this movie is a waste of time and talent that should have been direct to video if nothing else.  Just watch it and you'll see why it didn't do well at the box office.  Oh well, maybe another movie studio will get it right next time with a better cast and more experienced movie director.  Go go Gadget reboot!",1312934400,2,953,4.526315789473684

It tries waay too hard to be funny to a point that it is not funny at all. It has little to do with the cartoon and the moments that are true to the show is just a slap in the face. The movie's Dr. Claw is nothing like the Craw from the cartoon. He's more like a sidekick to him. The acting is crud. The editing is trash. AND YOU THOUGHT THE LAST AIRBENDER WAS A BAD MOVIE!!!!! I give this trash a 1 out of 10.",1298937600,,546,4.064814814814815
1067613,1,6305616027,"This live action film is based on a popular and fondly remembered 1980's animated television series about a bumbling bionic police inspector who is aided by his young niece and their dog, the architects of his success.

All I can say is...wow, this remake was a disaster of epic proportions.  Horrible, just ghastly.  The problems, in a nutshell:

1. Somber content in an allegedly lighthearted film.  A scientist is killed, a security guard is seriously injured and possibly dying, and neither event is treated with the gravity it deserves.  No mourning for the dead scientist, and the serious injuries are played for laughs, as we see the security guard encased in a whole body cast, utterly helpless as a dog licks his mouth.  Ugh.

2. A disturbing lack of ethics.  Said security guard is surgically altered WITHOUT HIS CONSENT OR KNOWLEDGE and changed into Inspector Gadget.  And we're not talking about The Six Million Dollar Man here---this isn't a maimed human being who is enhanced by powerful, but otherwise normal appearing, prosthetics.  This is a normal human being who is turned into a FREAK!

3. Awful casting.  Matthew Broderick is not funny, charming, or even remotely sympathetic.  And the film goes straight down the toilet when Matthew Broderick fights his evil double in a seemingly interminable battle sequence.

4. A changed premise.  The original conceit---a bumbling adult secretly aided by a brilliant girl and dog---was altered in the live action version.  The niece and dog have token roles, and Inspector Gadget is such an imbecile that he's painful to watch.

5. A wisecracking, jive talking car.  Need I say more?

6. Commerical advertising unsuccessfully disguised as product placement.  The scenes where a Yahoo billboard fell over (accompanied by the company's signature yodel) and carload of Skittles tumbled onto a sidewalk were as subtle as a sledgehammer.

Eye-gougingly awful, recommended only for your worst enemy.",1290297600,3,1953,5.1528662420382165

Overall, this is a very entertaining movie, one of the better live-action kids' films I've ever seen. Once Matthew Broderick is turned into ""Inspector Gadget,"" the film becomes very inventive with a lot of cool gadgets and a lot of neat things to see and hear (great movie for surround sound.)

Broderick is a likable hero and even Rupert Everett as the villain is, too, producing some laughs. There are enough adult-type jokes to clever material to make this fun for us older folks. I'd have to say this is one of the better efforts ever by the Disney company.

Broderick plays two roles, and is especially funny as the counterfeit Gadget with the fake teeth. The little girl in here is cute, too, and the talking car has some of the best lines of the film. At under 80 minutes, the film breezes by at good clip.",1235433600,,822,4.503355704697986

1067650,2,6305616027,"Remember growing up and watching this oddly funny, inspirational show that dabbled in both the absurd, the diabolical, and the genius all at the same time.  Don Adams of ""Get Smart"" fame wisely allowed his voice to be our uncanny hero, you know, the guy that couldn't save the day if his life depended on it, but thankfully had Penny and Brain there with him at all times to assist when needed.  This was a part of my growing up, thinking that the Chief would, at any time, give me a self-destructing sheet of paper with my mission was always something I was dreaming for.  Who else wanted to hold Penny's computer book for just one moment in our lives?  Was I the only one hoping to one day catch a glimpse of Dr. Claw's face?  If you are chanting ""YES. YES. YES"" along with me, then you are already aware of my feelings with Disney's debacle of a feature film presentation.  Now, this isn't to say that there weren't elements that I found entertaining (gosh, am I saying this...), but overall this seemed to forget the foundation that it was built upon - even the perverse cameo at the end sent shivers up my spine.  Where did the creators go wrong?  Let's begin by saying that this was a concept, a cartoon, that Disney had no right placing their expensive hands into.

I was hooked at the beginning surprisingly.  Why?  I wanted to see the birth of Gadget and the reason why Claw and him were always pitted against each other.  I wanted to see the creation of good and evil, but after twenty minutes, I saw Disney do what they do best.  Matthew Broderick nervously steps into a role that he obviously wasn't ready for.  He plays Gadget himself, a bumbling security cop who dreams of being a police officer.  Due to Rupert Everett's whining and obvious lack of knowledge of who Dr. Claw is, the two find themselves crossing each others paths at a bio-technology  lab where a new form of artificial intelligence is being designed.  There is a pretty girl/scientist (played by Joely Fisher) whom John Brown (Broderick, pre-Gadget) pines for, but cannot win because he doesn't have the confidence to win her over.  Well, we all know where this is headed next, and Disney lays it on thick as Broderick uses every torturous gadget in his disposal to eliminate ... not Dr. Claw, but a clone that is demolishing the city ... can he win?  I can't give it away, though it would make you better film viewers if I just blurted the ending ... who would pay money for this plastic form of entertainment.

Alright, characters - there was no commentary on this film, so  I only watched it once (thankfully!), but Broderick was the obvious stand out.  He tried, I know I feel bad saying this, but he did try to bring some depth to this character.  Gadget is a bumbling idiot - but he has a good heart.  I thought Broderick was a good choice personality wise, but he never took Gadget to that next cinematic level.  I wanted to have the foundation of the cartoon, but then grow into a feature film that had heart and dedication.  In this mere 78 minute short film, there was nothing.  So, on one side we have Gadget (Broderick doing his best), then on the other side we have the worst Hollywood idea ever - Rupert Everett as Dr. Claw.  This was a hazard.  This was Disney thinking they could take a enormously popular villain and give him a soul.  This was Rupert needing to ham it up more than Broderick so that there was a share of the screen.  There was no evil, there was no corruption, there was nothing that even faintly resembled the ""Claw"" that we grew up with.  The henchman seemed more in tune than Everett.  He wasn't funny, he wasn't sinister, he wasn't diabolical in any way.  He was fluff, and that wasn't the Dr. Claw that I attempted to pay money to see.  His portrayal was a disgrace to anyone that has ever even glanced at the cartoon.  Arg, it makes me mad just to mention it in this review.  Rupert Everett ruined Dr. Claw.  Penny (Michelle Trachtenberg) seemed to follow the Everett style of ""Gadet-ing"", but not following her character at all.  Shouldn't there have been a prerequisite to see the cartoon prior to making the film.  Oh, filmmakers, how I shun thee.

I guess if one could literally pull themselves away from the hideous acting by Everett, the rest of the film just seemed raced and pushed.  I was happy to see that it only lasted 78 minutes, and they did cover quite a bit of ground, but it just felt like they weren't willing to give the credit due to the cartoon.  This was a cult cartoon, and to see Disney play for a younger audience, care nothing for the pre-existing older audience that grew up with Gadget, make jokes that seemed clich, and bubble the bad guy.  It was hard to watch.  I was pleased with the script, the director tried to go dark with a really random Broderick attempting to play a darker, more fun character as Gadget's clone - but overall this film just  lacked the spunk from the cartoon.  I wanted animation, I wanted excitement, I wanted an adventure that would befuddle Adams himself, but instead I had a story that seemed like it would be in the dollar bin within the week of its release.

Overall, this film wasn't horrid.  The story itself wasn't anything I could watch again, but their ability to not overextend the plot, made it for simple viewing.  It was 78 minutes of filming that I didn't mind, but couldn't get myself to watch it again.  I will forever hate Everett for what he did to Dr. Claw, I think Dr. Claw will forever hate Everett as well.  His portrayal ruined this film.  It knocked it to the ground with no opportunity to pick it up again.  Broderick was watchable, but I don't think he was what this film needed.  ""Inspector Gadget"" is a perfect example of what happens when Disney puts their hands into a project and is determined to ensure that children get laughs from semi-crass physical humor.  This was a sad attempt of a film, but a part of me is happy that I watched it - now the cartoon seems better than ever!

1067724,1,6305616027,"I grew up watching Inspector Gadget in the 1980's, and was always fascinated by Penny's computer book. Since I only had to make do with a now obsolete Commodore 64 computer system, I thought that one book was the coolest part of the show.

Sure, living with an uncle who you were smarter than would occasionally challenge the nerves, but Gadget (whose first name was never revealed) also seemed like a genuinely nice guy who tried to do the right thing.

Before she ruined Buffy, Michelle Trachtenberg defamed Penny. In this movie, she appears as a brunette who lacks a computer (book) or otherwise to help Uncle Gadget---and basically save the day. In fact, Trachtenberg is not doing much of anything during this screenplay.

Matthew Broderick's Gadget in contrast, is a ladies man. He meets up with Dr. Brenda Bradford (Joely Fisher) who ultimately is Robo Brenda. Since this is a family film, nothing bad happens but the idea of Inspector Gadget attracting anybody is really hard to take. He's SUPPOSED to be a bumbler who does not get the woman, the anti-James Bond for kids.

Chief Quimby's (Dabney Coleman) appearance also poses some problems. He is too old and too thin in this movie. Chief Quimby is supposed to be a rotund person with light brown hair.

Finally, the crucial part of Dr. Claw's sinister persona is that the audience only sees his hand. Rupert Everett is not supposed to show his face or have an actual claw for a hand. The studios could have saved bundles of their precious money (and made this screen play more authentic) by hiring a literal nobody to sit behind a chair and speak into a voice distorter while an animatronic MAD cat was giggling in agreement. According to the cartoon, Dr. Claw actually had a metal gloved hand with a spiked gold bracelet.

Since Andy Heyward oversaw production on both the earlier cartoon and then this movie, I am really shocked by the large discrepancies. If he cannot exercise product control over his own cartoon product, I really have no sympathy for this film's poor returns. The people who would have incentive to revive their franchise with a great live action film, blew it instead.",1102896000,8,2152,4.7560321715817695

First, one of my pet peeves is deceptive trailers! A good portion of material from the trailer was either left out entirely or rushed through as a flashback or afterthought. This movie has the air about it that budgets ran dry and rather than scrap the movie altogether, it was rushed to production.
Disney needs to raise the bar on their live action movies. This was as much of a disappointment as Snow Dogs. If you are going to produce a movie based on a book, comic book, television show, etc., from a by-gone era, it would help if a fan of the material was involved in the production in my opinion.
See this one once, but save your money on the video. Maybe they will release the old cartoon on DVD. I would buy the whole series!",1048809600,2,900,4.238372093023256

Matthew Broderick is excellent as Rent-a-cop John Brown who is turned into Inspector Gadget, I didn't think he would pull off the cartoony-thing well, but he does! Joely Fisher is Dr. Brenda Bradford who carries on her late father's work by turning Brown into Gadget after he was maimed trying to protect her work from the evil Dr. Claw. Rupert Everett is hilarious as Sanford Scolex/Dr. Claw (even funnier is Andy Dick as one of his sidekicks).

As has also been the trend in cartoons on the big screen lately, there are some adult jokes that go right over the kids heads and some excessive cartoon violence. The funniest scene in the movie is when Gadget is with the Swami and grabs him inappropriately. Dabney Coleman is good as the chief of police, but he is not as good as the cartoon Chief Quimby. Yes, the Gadgetmobile is different too, but it has more attitude and deserves more screen time. Possibly the funniest person in the movie is Cheri Oteri as the ditzy 'Evil Gidget' mayor Wilson.

But then this comes out & spoils it all, I've seen this on a plane to the US & the turbulence was far more entertaining then this, for a Cartoon to Movie flick, it has nothing to tie it to the catoon & here's why below,
1, Matthew Broderick made a nice Gadget, but we all know that he's a bit of a doofus when it comes to crime solving & Penny
& Brain do most of the work, but in the film he does it all without Penny or Brain's help (like they did anything in the film) & I don't like that ""John Brown"" name.
2, Penny does most of the work foiling MAD with her computer book & com/laser watch in the toon, now she's just a typical
pre-teen girl who does nothing but teaches one MAD worker the error of his ways.
3, Penny's partner Brain the dog protects Gadget while in disguise & helps Penny out, now he's just your typical house pet.
4, The Gadget car turns from a family van to a sports car, the movie car is a thunderbird (I think) & it is a total paint in the ***,  never mind all the characters in other films that some people consider ""annoying"".

6, This film's version of MAD only has 2 noticeable people (some inventor guy & a fat doofus), the toon had an army of MAD
henchmen.
7, The in movie advertising, I don't really mind it but some people do & that's why I'm mentioning it.
8, We all know Disney will give us some sort of origin on how Inspector Gadget (or John Brown) got his gadget's, but getting
badly injured or killed while pursuing evil folk has been overdone.

If you have ever seen Robocop you will know exactly what I mean and if you have not, then consider these comparisons after watching Robocop: 1) both Robocop and Inspector Gadget were human beings before they became cyborgs. 2) As human beings, they were both law enforcement officials(if you consider a security guard a person who lays down the law!). 3) They were both ""killed"" by a criminal genius whom they were trying to arrest and then brought back from near death as cyborgs who take down every perp they encounter. 4) They both cling to what humanity they have left in them, mainly through the loved ones that they had in their human lives. 5) They both wind up combating the same man who tried to kill them as human beings and eventually bring him to justice. 6) They both have to deal with a heavily armed robot before they are able to take down their primary adversary. 7) They both come to terms with their existence as cyborgs.

Three major reasons and yet I even struggled to watch it because it was bashed on so much and it was only 78 minutes long.
So, I was expecting a bad film but you know what.  I enjoyed it.  I actually liked the movie.  It's definitely not below average.
Matthew Broderick is actually a good Inspector Gadget.  I think with the way movies are, many people tend to want to see a different Inspector Gadget, perhaps someone more violent.  Well, if that's the case...there is the Criterion edition of Robocop with the added gory scenes that you can buy.  This movie was made for kids as was the cartoon and I'm a kid at heart because I grew up with the show.
One of the things you'll notice is that it's a Disney DVD with extra's.  Yes, it's a miracle isn't it.  The majority of all Disney DVD's don't have squat in them.  This one has a 30 minute featurette on ""Go Inside Inspector Gadget"".  It also has a music video from Youngstown and the trailer.  Not bad Disney...keep adding more!  Also, the sound is well done with the 5.1.  Good use of the rear channels!
One negative was the layer change.  It was during a so-so important scene and that was not good to place it in that area of the movie.  They could of put it somewhere else.
Otherwise a good movie for the young ones.  Just a little warning for parents with younger children: Seeing Broderick with his head backwards or seeing him get blown up may frighten your child.

Thanks to current state-of-the-art special  effects, the filmmakers manage to effectively translate the cartoonish  aspects of the original to the live action format. Despite a few glaringly  bad shots utilizing rear screen projection, the visuals that help to  realize the infinite gadgets at the inspector's disposal are genuinely  jaw-dropping.
What the movie makers couldn't (or, at least, wouldn't)  come up with is a decent script - without which all the greatest special  effects in the world cannot a quality film make. Gadget is surrounded by a  gallery of dull, poorly written caricatures ranging from a giddy,  self-absorbed mayor, to a gruff, shortsighted chief of police, and an  effete mad scientist bent on creating an army of indestructible gadget  warriors, with which, of course, he (ho hum) plans to rule the world. Even  the newly ""hipified"" gadget mobile comes across as a charmless,  grating irritant as he provides a constant stream of witless one-liners as  running commentary to the action.
Of the actors, Broderick and Rupert  Everett cannot be faulted since both provide a degree of enthusiasm wholly  unwarranted by the inferior screenplay with which they are saddled. For a  perfect marriage of sophisticated writing and unsurpassable special  effects, check out ""Toy Story 2."" And see what ""Inspector  Gadget"" might indeed have been.",964742400,2,1748,5.349264705882353
1067875,4,6305616027,"This movie is cute but not for all ages. Kids would greatly enjoy this,most adults would think of it as silly. It's about John Brown (Matthew Broderick) getting into a car accident then is transformed into Inspector  Gadget,a robot in other words,by many doctors. At first he does not like  this new change,but he gets used to it after a while. I say it's a cute  movie and i would recommend it to people that enjoy silly movies. If  not,then do not see it...I would highly recommend it to the young-ones.",961545600,2,505,4.516483516483516

1067877,3,6305616027,"Even though I liked this movie, I did not enjoy it as much as I thought I would. It runs barely over an hour, whereas I was expecting a feature-length movie. Even so, I did eventually check my watch near the  middle of the movie.
The comedic bits in the movie are worth seeing,  especially with the Gadgetmobile. The credits are also worth it, as they  are inturrupted from time to time. Perhaps the best special feature on the  DVD is the Youngstown music video.",958780800,,463,4.411764705882353
1067878,1,6305616027,"there's is nothing more i can say about this absolutely pathetic, only for kids, movie than what's in the title. the actors seemed stiff, uninterested, and unemotional. rupert everett was absolutely horrible as  dr. claw and broderick was the worst possible actor to be signed on as the  crafty inspector we have all grown to love through the cartoon. the movie  is based around a diabolical accident that forces a regular cop (broderick)  to become a gadget-ridden man out to protect justice. basically the rest of  this monotonous film includes crazy, ""non"" action sequencences,  which build up to a ""climatic"" encounter with claw (everett).  along the way, gadget falls in love with a scientist and receives useless  advice from his ""crackpot"" daughter (michelle trachtenberg) and  useless dog, brain! fine to see with the kids, but don't expect to savour  it on a free saturday night.",956620800,,888,5.062068965517241
1067879,4,6305616027,I think that this film is really good although not  everybody likes it. The actors were good. My only objection is that the guy with the claw did not laugh the way he should. I loved it!,949276800,2,186,4.027027027027027
1067880,3,6305616027,"One thing that really annoyed me about this film is that 'Doctor Claw' has a face!  Anyone who's anyone knows that he was faceless in the cartoon.  What's more, the film felt the need to explain how he got his claw.  We  don't need to know how he got the claw cos he's the bad guy.
Now that  I've had my little rant and rave I'm gonna tell you about the dream  sequence at the beginning.  This sequence is so over the top it's good!  Everything a dream would be.  Saving the day while looking good.  Plus, I  like films that have a romantic interest sewing through the whole film.  You know they end up, but it's good to keep the 'will they, won't they'  scenario going for as long as possible cos that's the best part of romantic  films.  Look at 'Sleepless in Seattle' as an example, or, more recently,  'You've Got Mail.'
The kids will love this film.  Hell!  I liked this  film and I'm coming on twenty.  What I mean is that this film is perfect  for the little ones while strong enough to keep an adult entertained as  well.",949276800,2,1029,4.22279792746114
1067881,5,6305616027,"What a fantastic film!  It isn't the cartoon, in my opinion, it's better (maybe because the last time I saw the cartoon I was 5 1/2 years old).  Matt Broderick, Rupert Everett, Joely Fisher, Michelle Trachenberg and all  the rest was brilliant, the car was hilarious, the special effects seamless  and the entire film a laugh fest.  You'll have to be crazy to not like  Inspector Gadget, each of the four times I've seen it, the cinema was  packed with kids, teens (like myself), adults and grandparents all having a  really great time!  Buy this film!",948931200,3,552,4.666666666666667

1067883,1,6305616027,"It can't get worser than this! This is a bad, kids movie that has a plot with no point, actors with talent but have lost it here. I put faith in Matthew Broderick in alot of films, and he sucks in this one. And as for  the Claw guy, your a bad actor! Get rid of him! Hardly entertaining and a  very big disappointment.

1067938,3,6305616027,This tape has the disney trademark on the front.  To me that automatically means that it is good.  For the most part it was not a scratch on the old cartoon with the storyline sagging in parts.  The animation is pretty good  but fans of the cartoon will be sorely disappointed.  The car is also very  annoying and i think they could have hired better actors.  Overall this  video is not the best but could eventually get there.,947116800,,427,4.384615384615385
1067939,1,6305616027,"Usually, the opening title sequence of a movie sets the tone of how good or bad will be the movie.  This opening sequence seemed to last 10 minutes before it actually started the story.  After watching this much of the  show, I was quickly reminded of the movie ""Spawn"" which had an  equally boring to watch opening sequence.  ""Spawn"" had all the  computer special effects in it, but the story was boring.  Such is the case  with Inspector Gadget, but this show decided to add ""in your  face"" commercials (like Yahoo, Skittles, etc.) in practically every  scene.  I was highly annoyed watching this show.
The movie is not funny,  is not true to the original Inspector Gadget cartoon, and is very boring to  watch.  The run time of the actual movie is only about 60 minutes excluding  the opening and ending credits.  Skip this disc.",946771200,3,832,4.63448275862069
1067940,3,6305616027,"Disney make two kinds of film: the type that everyone will remember forever (Jungle Book, 101 Dalmatians, Dumbo etc.) and the type that get forgotten fairly quickly like... er... um... Escape From Witch Mountain and  er... Pete's Dragon and um... so on.
This is probably one of the latter.  That's not to say it's a bad film - it isn't. It has it's flaws, sure (it's  a bit messy and incohesive - the whole thing just doesn't seem to fit  together very well), but it is funny, it will keep you entertained for the  duration and kids will want to watch it more than once. I suspect it will  improve with repeated viewings - you tend not to notice the bits that don't  fit so well as familiarity smooths over the cracks.
The car is very  annoying, though, and I was a bit annoyed at the non-use of Penny and Brain  - any cartoon fans will miss them as they are almost completely absent from  the plot despite being in the movie.
I suspect that if you buy the video  it may become a kids favourite. If not, then your family will probably have  forgotten about it within a year.",946771200,2,1074,4.315

1067943,4,6305616027,"For a movie with the name Disney branded on the front (which means it's automatically geared towards a young audience), it isn't half-bad.  The plot: catch the bad guys & get the girl.  That's okay, because the way  that they go about is funny. The co-star looks good.  It's predictable, but  a 180 from the cartoon (which in a way is refreshing).  Inspector Gadget  (Matthew Broderick) is ""not"" the dim-witted, feigned hero like  his cartoon counterpart.  And Penny (Michelle Trachtenberg) isn't the lil'  snoop that solves all the mysteries sans credit.  In fact Penny, uh, has no  role; the director tried to stay somewhat true to the cartoon Penny.  Nor  does Brain.  You'll like the way Gadget handles his evil twin- who is  concocted from the warped mind of Dr. Claw/Cotex (and whose teeth are  incredibly white!)  The only downsets are that Cotex (Rupert Everett) is,  to my knowledge, not from the cartoon.  And I dang sure know that Dr. Claw  is supposed to be covert and... not seen! If you pay meticulous attention-  the Cartoon Dr. Claw has a bionic right hand, not left.  Anywho, what  squirmed me right out of my theater seat was the annoying Gadgetmobile  personality (D.L. Hughley). I'm sawry, but D.L. was getting on my nerves,  yall, dang!  And I thought it was kinda cruel how Gadget's on the brink of  death and they metamorph him into the next ""Robocop"" without his  permission. But all 'n all, a very funny, FX-filled, watch-at-any-age kinda  film.  Hello... duh, it's Disney... that's why!",946339200,,1512,4.811764705882353
