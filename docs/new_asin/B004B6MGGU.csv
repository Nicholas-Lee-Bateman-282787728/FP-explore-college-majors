4313942,5,B004B6MGGU,This program is awesome! Although I do cardio and weight training 3-4 days a week I am whimpering at the end of these workouts. I'm almost done my third cycle and already I see a huge improvement in my core and hip strength and I notice the results in my riding. They are the perfect length - 20 minutes - you can fit them in anywhere in your day. No excuses. My husband (a runner but non-rider) has started the program and is amazed at the improvement in his strength in a very short time.,1330041600,5,490,4.168421052631579
4313943,5,B004B6MGGU,This Core Fitness Program is true to it's title. Since I'm an avid trail rider and live in Western PA the winter time is some times trick to be able to ride every day with out an indoor to ride in.  Yesterday though we were able to take  a long 3.5 hour ride over some pretty hilly terrian and I woke up this morning with just mild stiffness and I have only been doing this program 2.5 weeks. I usally use my eliptical 5 days a week going 1.25 miles and then the success in the saddle 3 days a week and was really pleased not to have the soreness of a long ride without the fitness program.  I didn't even have to pop any pain meds to get to sleep.  I just can't say enough about this program it's short but with enough intensity to really shape you up!!! I have more confidence not only in the saddle but also on the ground with my daily activites.  Thanks Debbie for a fitness program to target rider!!!!,1328486400,5,906,4.096045197740113
4313944,5,B004B6MGGU,"I absolutely LOVE these dvds! There is a good amount of variety in each session and they are short enough that I can fit them into my busy college schedule. They are challenging but do-able. I have already started seeing results in my riding and it has only been a few weeks! I don't want to skip a day, they are so much fun!",1326844800,7,325,4.09375
4313945,5,B004B6MGGU,"Let me start with that I am in pretty good shape, and I'm not bragging, but work out mostly cardio for at least 60 minutes a day running or spinning.  I had been doing hot yoga but due to times of classes had not done any classes for about two months and I could tell a different in my core strength.  Bought these exercise videos as they were developed for riders.  I am very critical of exercise videos because I typically find that they are geared towards people that are just beginning an exercise program and they don't challenge me enough.  This series of DVD's has surprised me with how challenging they are.  If you are not in good shape, don't be scared off because they aren't impossible to do, but I think they are good for any rider no matter their fitness level. I bet you will find like I did that some of those muscles weren't getting used as much as I thought.  I find the core, abs, and arm exercises more challenging than the legs/hips but those are the areas I was not working enough.  Also like the 20 minute length so I can add one session in after a run or spin class.  And they are short enough you should be able to work in one session a day.",1296518400,56,1166,4.197309417040358
8421539,5,B004B6MGGU,"I work out five days a week and this video has challenged me. Fantastic workout for a rider. It has improved my balance and seat. Increased my confidence as a rider and athlete. If you ride and want to be in your best physical shape I highly recommend this video, a must have for a serious rider.",1519948800,,296,4.2105263157894735
8421540,5,B004B6MGGU,"This is a great exercise program for anyone who rides.  20 minute workout with no equipment,  and true results",1457827200,2,110,4.7368421052631575
8421541,4,B004B6MGGU,"Pros: Good low impact workout that definitely helps with balance and core strength.  Much less intense than 21 day fix, insanity or p90x.  Nice to be done in 20 minutes.  The con is that the instructor is very quiet and calm, doesn't have much enthusiasm to keep you interested and working hard.  You have to motivate yourself.  Also she doesn't preview or verbally explain and the moves.  Just watch and do.  Consequently, the first few times you do each workout, you are missing the beginning reps each time while you figure out what she's doing.",1452729600,3,548,4.705263157894737

8421543,5,B004B6MGGU,Fantastic challenging workouts.  Doing it daily with a friend...my horse is happy i am even trying to improve myself!!,1413158400,,118,5.2105263157894735
8421544,5,B004B6MGGU,"This is a perfect complement to my cardio exercise regime. Six different workouts with the focus on balance, flexibility and core strength help me become a better dressage rider. The variety keeps it interesting. It helps me maintain a ""no excuses"" daily routine!",1378857600,,263,5.1395348837209305
8421545,5,B004B6MGGU,"But it's the isolation of the muscle groups and the repetition that makes it so challenging. The first day I thought, ""This isn't so tough."" But I felt it in every muscle group the entire next day. The second day I felt the burn much faster and by the third day I needed to give my muscles a break. After about a week off, I started back in at Day 1. These sessions are definitely worth the money. The exercises target the exact muscles you need when you ride. I highly recommend the DVD ... but I advise exercisers to go slowly unless you are already in tip top shape.",1369785600,5,569,4.181818181818182
8421546,2,B004B6MGGU,"I am disappointed in this DVD set.  Ms Rodriquez expects the user to already know how to do the exercises.  There is no explanation of correct form, and what to avoid.  The supposedly less strenuous workout shows very little difference to what Ms Rodriquez is doing, and the more strenuous workout is only more strenuous when weights can be used.",1348099200,2,346,4.733333333333333
8421547,5,B004B6MGGU,Really like these CDs - they start out gently and work up to more energetic work outs. Great for developing the right muscles for riding.,1332806400,6,137,4.52
8421548,5,B004B6MGGU,"These DVDs are good not only for the riders but any person would benefit from this workout. The workout is very short and reqires no equipmet. So, there is really no excuse to skip a day. I could never force myself to do any exercises on my own. But the ladies in the DVDs is a good company and a motivation as well. The exercises are very chalenging. I love these DVDs. Thanks a lot!",1332806400,3,384,4.133333333333334
