949722,4,6304952899,There is so much to be said and written about Tesla. I am honored to have discovered this forgotten master researcher and inventor. Tesla has been written out of history because his inventions would have changed the way we live and do business. We would all have FREE energy for our homes and cars. The world would have little or no pollution because fossil fuels would not necessary. The fear of men in high places and their greed and need for control have impovrished us all. Do your research on Nikolai Tesla you will be amazed.,1220486400,2,531,4.541666666666667

949727,3,6304952899,"I just viewed this 50 minute long DVD and found it kind of boring but useful regarding seeing some of Tesla's actual inventions at work and some of the real documents, by and about him, displayed.  It also shows the inside of the Tesla museum in Belgrade.  The PBS Tesla documentary, Tesla - Master of Lightning, is much more interesting and goes much deeper into Tesla's life (it's much longer in duration).  As well, this DVD is a poor quality transfer of the VHS tape; it has video dropouts and missing pieces, similar to what happens when a film has damaged sections chopped out, causing jump cuts where some information is lost.  I cover Tesla at the beginning of a course I teach about information technology and, along with the PBS Tesla documentary, will use brief segments of this DVD to further illustrate Tesla's inventions and importance; past, present and future.",1135382400,36,876,4.781456953642384

949729,5,6304952899,"Nikola Tesla has not been given his place in the history books.  However, with the video ""The Genius Who Lit The World"" he is getting the credit which he deserves. Tesla is the inventor of alternating current,  which is in use today (not Edison's direct current which reached only the  few rich). The video is a true documentary covering his many contributions  to the world, such as his 2 phase poly motor  as well as his inventions of  flurescence and robotics.  As a neighbor of his Shoreham, Long Island 1901  laboratory, I have a deep respect for him.  I have had the pleasure of  interviewing several people who have met Mr. Tesla and have written  articles for a local newspaper.  I am a Board Trustee of the Friends of  Long Island Wireless History.  It is our aim to establish a museum about  Long Island's wonderful wireless history.  This video will whet your  appetitie to learn more about this genius.",922752000,54,914,4.647798742138365

949761,3,6304952899,"This 50 minute documentary was originally made in 1977 and to say the video to DVD transfer is somewhat grainy would be an understatement. The whole thing looks like it was made for about $2.50 or thereabouts and much of it is voice over laid on top of static photographs of our man Tesla, his inventions and experiments. The DVD gives the barest mention of his parentage, his early life and then delves straight into his life in the US where his genius was harnessed first by Edison and then by Westinghouse. And genius he quite clearly was as this documentary shows how the man came up with invention after invention and by the shows end you are left in no doubt of his towering scientific achievements. What is so beguiling is that his inventions weren't abstract concepts of interest mainly to academics but they really touched the world around him due to their practical uses.

Within the space of a 50 minute documentary you are not going to get exhaustive detail. And given the age of the source material this is hardly going to be considered the last word of Nikolo Tesla study. The limitations of budget and the painfully dry live sequences where aspects of his inventions are displayed along with the grainy transfer of this DVD preclude it from being rated highly. However if you know nothing about Tesla this is a start. One of the first things I did after finishing watching it for the first time was to check out what biographies of the man were available in book form, so that at least is a good thing.

Cautiously recommended.",1400976000,,1542,4.6036363636363635

949765,5,6304952899,"I was pleasently surprised to find that the story of Nikola Tesla is presented rather well. Some reviews take a rather critical poke at the quality of the video; I was more interested in the educational value. The video is clearly not a made for TV but so what? For the money, one gets a quick historical background on Tesla's family and family life in old Yugolslavia (Serbia in particular with mention of Hungary, and Germany), an excellent tour of the Tesla Musium in Belgrade with some intereting demonstrations of Tesla's inventions. A great deal of the film deals with Tesla's history with Edison, J.P. Morgan, and others as he carried out and perfected ideas he generated through out his life; from childhood (Niagra Falls electicity generation dream), to a never completed tower to wirelessly distribute power and communications world-wide (Wardenclyffe Tower). I would have like to hear more in depth on Tesla's theories (Tesla frequency, for example), but there are plenty of good books to follow up with. As mentioned, quality of the film overall is not perfect, but the ideas, the message, and the overview of Tesla's lie is why I purchased the video, not for the entertainment value. You will not be an expert on Tesla after viewing this video, but if you are new to the his Tesla's history, you should at least have a good appreciation for his accomplishments after viewing the video.",1296432000,12,1398,4.878151260504202

949767,3,6304952899,"I have next to no time to read so I rely a lot on DVD documentories.  They're easier to pay attention to than a book when your tired.  USUALLY, when you search for things on Amazon, the best one out of the bunch is the one at the top of the list.  Not so in this case.  This is a very old fashioned documentary from, I really don't know when.  I had gotten use to very energetic and exciting narrarations.  This reminded me of a high school lecture I would have fallen asleep in.  Very much on the boaring side.
The up side to this DVD is that you get a bit of visual illustrations of his work.  Theres a part in the program where they have the president of the Tesla museum explain and even deminstrate some of his work.  You also get to see things like the photographs of his hands that he took when he was working on photography lighting, as well as the sphere he was creamated in.  There are a few things like that that you probably won't find anywhere else, but my not be completely worth the 5-10 seconds of show that that get.
This DVD is very informative, but not very big on keeping your attention.  You're most likely to miss something cool just because the show had a hard time keeping you into it with the dull droning of the narraration.  Much like in high school.
I'm not trying to discourage anyones interest in Nikola Tesla.  He was awesome.  I'm just suggesting that you may want to look at the reviews of some of the other videos.",1256083200,5,1448,4.218181818181818

7880827,4,6304952899,"Nikola Tesla: The Genius Who Lit the World is an informative and accurate documentary of Nikola Tesla's accomplishments. It covers Tesla's time and rival with Thomas Edison, goes into detail about his induction motor, and even tells of his obscure experiments. It gives a great deal of information about the Nikola Tesla museum in Belgrade. It also gives information about his death and then lasting legacy. But there are a few setbacks.
