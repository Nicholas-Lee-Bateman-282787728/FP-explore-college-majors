8567672,5,B00BFCDJ8C,"I seen this at its premier and the movie is fantastic. The filmmakers worked hard on this project and it shows. If you like independent films, I would suggest you buy this one. Not like other indie projects that have big budgets and big actors, this one is truly independent from Hollywood and just as good as things you'd see in the theaters.",1372032000,3,343,4.4603174603174605
