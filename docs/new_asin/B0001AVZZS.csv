8009792,5,B0001AVZZS,"If you are a fan of college football than this DVD is for you. Watch the Florida State Seminoles, led by quarterback Chris Weinke, prevail over the Virginia Tech Hokies. Besides Weinke, the Seminoles featured future NFL players Travis Minor, Peter Warrick, Corey Simon, Tommy Polley, Derrick Gibson and Sebastian Janikowski. The Hokies were led by all everything quarterback Michael Vick.
The game is exciting from start to finish. Make sure to not miss the end when the greatest college football coach of all-time, Bobby Bowden, lifts the Sears Championship Trophy. The 1999 Seminoles were one of the greatest teams in college football history.",1080345600,5,645,5.211538461538462
