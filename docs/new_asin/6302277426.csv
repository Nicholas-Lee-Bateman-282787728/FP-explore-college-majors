8127617,2,6302277426,"the previous negative reviews are pretty accurate.  the listing i read on amazon had the WRONG INFO for the video.  it is not 680 minutes.  it is 90 min.  also, some of the information is wrong.  i didn't watch past the battle of shiloh, but up to that point several things were wrong, including names, pictures attributed to the wrong historical figure and even statistics.  shiloh had 23,000 casulties (killed wounded or missing) but the film stated that there were 33,000 dead.

i can't say i would recommend this to anyone, even if you just want an overview of the war.  ken burns doc. is still the best overview, though it is lenghty.

there are a lot of better cw video/dvds out there.  i hope this helps.",1309910400,,711,4.52755905511811
8127618,5,6302277426,I received this video set and also another video from this dealer.  I was very happy with the service and expiditiously the delivery.  I have not watched either videos yet.  (I am waiting for a rainey day!)  We don't get much moisture here in Southern California.  Thank you to everyone involved.  5 stars rating.,1233792000,,313,4.703703703703703
