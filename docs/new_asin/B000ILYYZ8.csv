8146203,5,B000ILYYZ8,"Just watched America Rebuilds (2002, Kevin Spacey narrator) which was excellent. Wondering whether this product includes both the 2002 and 2006 documentaries.

As a New Yorker and amateur 9/11 historian, I found the perspectives of the demolition crew extremely powerful. After my very recent visit to the (/11 Memorial Museum, the backstory provided in this film (2002) is eye-opening. Clearly the 9/11 families fought a hard fight for the beautifully moving memorial that is there today. Highly recommended.

While I realize that the demo crew underwent extreme stress, it was a little disconcerting to hear whoops of success as WTC 7 and other remaining structures were demolished. But history is history, and this documentary provides a rarely-seen view of the aftermath of 9/11.",1471219200,,783,5.357723577235772

8146205,4,B000ILYYZ8,"Part One - America rebuilds:  A year at ground zero.

Labeled as the largest demolition and recovery project ever undertaken in the United States, the first half of this program takes an extensive look at how 2300 workers cleared two million tons of debris over a nine month period after the 9-11 tragedy.  In an environment where new hazards were encountered on a continual basis, the heroic efforts of all involved were impressive to say the least.

Interviews with many people involved in this project clearly show the emotional impact it had on them due to the tremendous loss of life and devastation that surrounded them every day.  Several residents of Manhattan also shared their feelings on how they and the surrounding community were affected by this attack.

The topic of eventually rebuilding on this and surrounding locations was explored also and as one might imagine, this was a delicate balancing act between the many that lost loved ones in the disaster and what was in the best interests of the city itself.

Watching the images of the devastation on the World Trade Centers in this feature is heartbreaking and disturbing even today but it also helps to illustrate, however, that America is a very resilient and proud nation that always rises to the occasion in the best and worst of times.

Part Two - America Rebuilds II:  Return to ground zero.

In the second installment of this program, it begins with a detailed look at the construction and opening of World Trade Center building number seven, the first complex to be rebuilt out of everything destroyed in the original attacks.

Farther along, public forums are held to discuss thoughts on a memorial that would eventually be a part of a new structure on the original twin tower's property.  Selected from hundreds of designs submitted from around the world, a winner was finally chosen out of eight finalists.  An exploration of the memorial project is examined in this segment to include the controversy it created when many people objected to its construction being below ground level.  Finishing up the documentary is look at an artist's rendering of the final building design that will take the place of the original towers.

`America Rebuilds' is a solid production from PBS in my opinion and they present the subject matter well especially considering these past events are still sensitive to many.  Good narration is provided by Kevin Spacey and Mariska Hargitay and the video footage is clear and distinct throughout.",1190332800,,2501,4.961630695443645
