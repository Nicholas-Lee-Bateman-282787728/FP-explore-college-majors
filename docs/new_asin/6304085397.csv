7861013,5,6304085397,We ended up buying the entire series once we saw this one.  It is truly funny for British TV and we enjoy watching the complete set.,1237334400,,132,4.076923076923077

converted into DVD???

Its a great pity the series is still be sold as VHS.

Absolutely loved it when seeing it on TV for the first time.",1131926400,,270,4.215686274509804
7861015,5,6304085397,"This is a mustfor any afficionado of British comedy. Also it is essential viewing for anyone who travels around Europe. Highly recommended for sons and daughters currently or are thinking of embarking in a study abroad program.
Some of Amazon's readers may be aware of a character from an English sit-com many years ago called Alf Garnett. At the time, this character was very politically incorrect and would certainly not be able to be broadcast in the US at the present time. Garnet was the archetypal Little England, resistant to any 'foreign' notions of food or anything new. A particularly reactionary chap, he reflected the concerns of a nation emerging from the war facing a changed world and articulated the fears of many. In many ways, Henry Root is a modern day equivalent.
Root, admirably played by George Cole (Minder) is a businessman who lives in a comfortable middle class suburb of London. He is a self-made man and his home reflects the tastes of the lower middle classes. He and his long suffering wife embark on an odyssey around Europe to see what's out there. While the role that he establishes is of itself extremely funny, the best of the humor is experienced on his travels.
Just travelling on the Channel ferry across to France is an unmitigated disaster in certain respects and is quite hilarious. What gives this particular comedy particular strength is the use of only two actors throughout. Everyone else being real the effect is almost a candid camera with everyone knowing.
Particular themes are the need to have sufficient supplies of British toilet paper (which as many American readers will know, is not renowned for it's softness) and the effects that foreign food has on Henry's stomach.
The main theme throughout is the destruction of stereotypes - both British and European. There are some brilliant scenes which are confrontational and expose differing cultures to the reality that despite different national origins we are all people underneath. Some of the shots are breathtaking and for me one of the highlights is the Roots driving across Spain with the windows open with the song 'Impossible Dream' blasting out to the obvious bemusement of the locals. Don Quixote indeed.
I rave over this comedy to anyone who will sit an watch it with me. There was talk of a Root into America but that never materialised. Shame.
A great comedy, highly recommended but watch with caution as some viwers may be offended.",1016496000,,2448,4.915458937198068
7861016,5,6304085397,"Having watched all five tapes, two nights in a row, I am still thoroughly amused and can and will continue to watch them.  Being from ""Streatham"" certainly helps but regardless, George Cole's rendition of Henry Root displays the ""Average Englishman abroad"" character that has been, and I guess still is, prevalent since the Korean War!",981504000,2,335,5.090909090909091
7861017,5,6304085397,"Don't expect ""European Vacation"" (also a film I love by the way!) here because ""Root into Europe"" is a more subtle comedy which visits European foibles more in depth.  This video is even funnier to  people who have travelled in ""the continent"".
Other than Henry  and Muriel Root, all the other players are real people often responding  somewhat spontaneously.
Henry Root's stereotypical notions about  different Europeans (Germans have no sense of humor, the Spanish are lazy,  the French are too intellectual and no fun etc.) and how these notions are  blown away are supremely funny.
I think ""Root into Europe"" is a  budding classic and a keeper!",942710400,,648,4.990654205607477
7861018,4,6304085397,"Great series, but you'll need to follow the dialogue carefully to fully appreciate the humour and British expressions.  Maybe a bit tough on Americans, but certainly worth a try.  One should probably be knowledgable  about the time (pre-Unification Europe), as it was quite topical when it  was produced.",935280000,,304,5.270833333333333
