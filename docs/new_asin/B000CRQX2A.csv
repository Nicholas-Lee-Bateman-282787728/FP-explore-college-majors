8101269,4,B000CRQX2A,"This set contains both Zorro films! Each movie is wonderful with Antonio Banderas perfect as Zorro! I am giving this set 4 stars for the price, and for the transfers. A quick breakdown of each film is as follows:

The Mask of Zorro: 4 Stars! Zorro (Banderas) returns to action against Montero and his band of evil doers! After Spain is run out of California, the original Zorro (Hopkins) is locked away by his mortal enemy, Montero! To add insult to injury he takes his infant daughter Elena (Zeta-Jones) as his own. Now Montero has returned with a sinister plot to buy California for his own! It is up to the old and new Zorro to stop his sinister plot and teach Elena the truth about her past!

The Legend of Zorro: 3.5 Stars! Zorro (Banderas) is called by the people of California again to stop the sinister plot by Armand (Sewell) that will destroy the union. Zorro must also save his wife (Zeta-Jones) and son from his evil clutches as well!

NOW FOR MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: The Mask of Zorro looks good, but it could have been better. It certainly suffers a little from age, but it's the best it's ever looked. The Legend of Zorro looks fantastic! A beautiful picture with sharp contrasts and amazing color! Each film has very good audio mixes. SPECIAL FEATURES: All special features are carried over from each special edition DVD. FINAL THOUGHTS: As a box set, this is an absolute winner! Especially if you can get it for under $30. ABSOLUTELY UPGRADE!",1276992000,9,1456,4.592307692307692
