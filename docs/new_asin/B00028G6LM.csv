8023804,5,B00028G6LM,A brief drama gives you some insight into Freud's early career when he is in training and developing some of his theories which later have to be discarded. I particularly liked the part where he goes to study with the French doctor.,1265587200,2,232,4.5476190476190474
8023805,3,B00028G6LM,"Not uninteresting, but not what I had hoped to buy.  Looking at the box cover, you might assume that the film is in color - wrong.  Looking at the DVD release date, you might assume the film was made in the last few years.  Again, wrong - it was made in the '70s, although the picture and sound quality are so poor that it might as well have been made in the '30s.",1251158400,6,364,3.958904109589041
8023806,5,B00028G6LM,"I enjoyed this movie very much, since it depicts Freud's early professional work. Th emovie shows Freud's struggles to establish himself and to deal with psychological patients and theories. The movie shows the impact Charcot had on Freud.

I highly recommend this movie for those who are interested in learning about Sigmund Frued.",1129939200,15,332,5.264150943396227
