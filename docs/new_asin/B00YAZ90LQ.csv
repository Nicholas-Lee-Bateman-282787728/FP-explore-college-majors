8717808,5,B00YAZ90LQ,"I have seen Distant Worlds concerts in 5 different locations now, and I don't know if they could beat the lineup for their 30th anniversary shows, but this is a pretty close second. A lot of tracks are available on the Distant Worlds CDs, but as of this writing, this is the only place you can see the I-XIV Battle Theme Medley, which is absolutely amazing. It's great that they were able to get Susan Calloway as well as the original performer of Melodies of Life. The last 4 shows I have been to have not had any of the female vocalists, so this is a nice get. Overall, a great concert.",1519776000,,588,4.258928571428571
