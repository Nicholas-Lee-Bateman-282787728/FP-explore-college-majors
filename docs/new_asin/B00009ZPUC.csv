1898651,4,B00009ZPUC,"I don't understand why critics are so hard on Vin, I think he has great range as an actor, personally, and he's the best action star of this generation.  Sly and Arnold always gave the cheesey one-liners, and couldn't pull a tear outta me if they bit me on the ass.  But ""A Man Apart"" really demonstrated Vin's acting abilities, and he can go far, in my opinion.
""A Man Apart"" was a pretty dramatic movie, moreso than expected.  It had a lot of heart, and plenty of action, and some real comedic moments, which were well placed, considering the plot.  I didn't hear any cheesy one-liners, which I was thankful for, cause, in my opinion, it destroyed Vin's blockbuster ""XXX.""
AMA was nice break from some of the other flops I've seen lately, and I was glad I spent the money to see it.  The only downfall, no that I said that is this, the trailer gave away soo much, too much.  You basically know the entire plot from the trailer, which was a mistake made by the production company's, and one reason why I don't have to tell you the story, you know it.  But I strongly reccomend this movie, Vin fan's won't be disappointed.",1050278400,13,1122,4.391304347826087
1898652,1,B00009ZPUC,"I saw this movie the first day it came out.  According to the reviews, Vin Diesel gives a powerful performance.  Boy were they wrong.  I am the biggest movie fanatic and I dozed off about two or three times.  The action scenes are two spaced apart and the movie is so repetitive.  They say the exact same thing about twenty times.  The movie was promoted good but the movie was unable to live up to the previews.  Trust me, save your money and go see something like The Core which was excellent.",1049932800,,495,4.315217391304348
1898653,3,B00009ZPUC,"A pretty predictable action movie about a cop (Diesel) attempting to avenge the death of his wife by taking on a mexican drug cartel.
A lot of action, guns, death, blood, and drugs .... or in other words a typical night in LA type of stuff. The acting isn't as bad as I expected, except the part where Diesel has to attempt to walk after being shot twice - that was pretty pathetic. But the overall effect of the movie isn't too bad. But just like XXX, don't have high expectations and it'll all be ok.",1049760000,3,502,4.239583333333333
1898654,2,B00009ZPUC,"This movie was supposed to be the vehicle to show off the versatility of Vin Diesel's acting talents.  It failed on that objective.  Vin Diesel has proven that he is solely an action movie hero.  If he attempts to stray from that formula, it will not be a convincing acting performance.  The movie had entertaining portions to it, but overall I would say that the movie did not do it for me.  When I see a movie I would like to feel something.  I want to become attached to the characters and see them either struggle or succeed.  This movie spent way to much time have shots of Vin Diesel staring into space for an action movie and too much action for a movie trying to tackle an emotional man's attempt to deal with his wife's death.  This movie was the typical action movie star film and could have starred any of the sterotypical action movie stars.",1049587200,,853,4.388535031847134
1898655,5,B00009ZPUC,"This tale of vengeance is one of the best I have ever seen. Riveting and emotional it sends the viewer to a place noone wants to be.  From the cliche action beginning to the touching end, this is Vin Diesel's shinning momment. His onscreen persona throws you in to the mix as you feel all of his confused emotion, not many can do what he does and he did it well. If you are out this weekend and want to see a movie that is action filled and emotional stimulating at the same time this is the one.",1049587200,,496,4.061224489795919
1898656,1,B00009ZPUC,"In A Man Apart, agents Sean Vetter and Demetrius Hicks are part of Los Angeles' best drug enforcement agency, which is currently making an effort to strike a massive blow at the narcotics pipeline between the borders of United States and Mexico.  Shortly after a successful joint mission in putting one of the most elusive drug cartel leaders, Meno Lucero, in jail, Vetter's home becomes the target of a ruthless attack that results in his wife's death.  With the name Diablo as his only lead, Sean must find a way to discover the identity of this mysterious person who is claiming Lucero's operation as his own, and to avenge the murder of the love of his life.
While I appreciate the attempt at infusing some semblance of a plot into an otherwise straight up action movie, however, the effort is inconsistent and ultimately hurts the picture as a whole.  Rather than focusing on either giving the audiences an action packed adventure or a heart felt drama, what we end up with is a film that is average in both areas.  The gunfights in A Man Apart were poorly shot and chaotic, at times it was hard to tell the differences between the good guys and the bad ones.  The twists in the story made very little sense, and even though the romance displayed between Diesel and co-star Jacqueline Obradors is sweet, it really did not work for me or convince me of Sean's desire for revenge.  I also find it silly when movies have the tendency to suggest that criminals become more powerful when they are behind bars, if that is the case, what is the point of arresting them?
With the exception of Pitch Black, I have never been a big fan of Vin Diesel's performances.  His monotone delivery of lines is often devoid of any feelings, and when he does exhibit emotions, frequently they seem to be forced and unnatural.  The same is true in his portrayal of the protagonist Sean Vetter.  This is largely the reason why the movie failed, if you are unable to make a connection with the lead character, why would you care what happens to him?
Larenz Tate plays Vetter's partner Demetrius Hicks.  The two of them were good friends while growing up.  Their aspiration to make a difference in their neighborhood instead of complaining about it motivated them to join the anti-narcotics law enforcement unit.  There really isn't much to say about Tate, he did not make much of an impression in his scenes opposite of Diesel.  Timothy Olyphant, on the other hand, went way overboard as Hollywood Jack.  One minute he is a blubbering fool, another minute he becomes a cold-blooded killer, the discrepancies in the way the role was depicted demonstrates how poorly the whole film was scripted.
A Man Apart is a derivative and an awful movie.  The lack of good action sequences, in combination with a superficial plot and paper-thin characters, result in a mediocre fare that was neither fun nor exciting to watch.  As for Vin Diesel, he still lacks that one defining role that has made actors like Stallone (as Rambo) and Schwarzenegger (as the Terminator and Conan) such big names in the genre.",1049587200,2,3076,4.689591078066915
1898657,5,B00009ZPUC,"Where can I begin? I loved this movie. I am an avid Diesel fan love all his roles, but in A Man Apart he proves that he is a true actor. Diesel does a wonderful job in the role of DEA officer Sean Vetter. Vetter goes on a revenge spree after his wife is murdered my a new cartel head called ""Diabol."" The movie is full of twist and turns and is narrated by Diesel.  My advice go watch it!",1049500800,,388,3.85
1898658,5,B00009ZPUC,"A man apart was a excellent film to start with the story lines were excellent and Vin Diesel played a excellent part.

I came across it doing some Web surfing. As soon as I did I went straight to Amazon knowing that if I was going to find it that I would there. I love buying these great movies such as this on Amazon. Then when I'm in bed and watching TV and want to watch a good movie when there's none on I just turn on my Amazon. I keep a lot of good movies in my Amazon library. Then I can watch them in HD without ever getting up out of bed. I'm also a Prime Member so I have a big selection of movies to watch for free as a Prime Member. Newer than the selection of Netflix which I'm also a member. A Man Apart is one of those movies you can watch over and over. A good story with drama, excitement.",1486166400,,845,3.752808988764045

The plot, while not incredibly original, is still good enough to hold your attention. If you like movies like Man on Fire with Denzel Washington or Training Day, then A Man Apart is sure to be a solid choice for you. I've held back on giving it 5 stars only because the ending was a little weak (in my opinion).

Vin Diesel .. in his 40's ... still looking great & delivering believable lines ... a great action/drama film ... depicting the never ending war on drugs ...  a situation that exist because of the uncontainable consumers among Developed nations ... an ironic reality ... that places my country in not always a dignifying way in american films ... but the truth is that we are more than drug supliers .,1447545600,,406,4.638888888888889

Diesel is the anti-hero who simply doesn't accept the state of things once he loses his wife and as you may well suppose will fix the mess according his own methods.

This is not typical of other heroes who have some restraint.

1898891,4,B00009ZPUC,"Revenge movies generally do well with American film audiences, if for no other reason than that they achieve something that other film genres cannot.  This type of film speaks to our sense of justice, when someone we love has had some wrong done to them, whether they be hurt, robbed, or worse, be killed, we want to go and set things right.  However, in reality we cannot always act on these feelings, as much as we may want to, which is where these movies come in.  For one, we don't actually have to go through any real pain or suffering, we simply vicariously live through the characters on screen, and through the emotional connection that is made, if something should happen to one of them, it instantly stirs that feeling for justice to be done.

""A Man Apart"" is the story of a volatile DEA agent, Sean Vetter (Vin Diesel), who along with his partner Demetrius Hicks (Larenz Tate), go undercover to bring down the top Mexican drug lord.  With the toppling of the top drug lord in Mexico, a new cartel begins to assume control of Mexico, led by a man called Diablo, this new drug cartel is even more ruthless than the one before it.  To get the attention of the DEA, more importantly Sean Vetter, Diablo orders a hit on him, Vetter narrowly escapes with his life, sadly his wife was not so lucky.  Vowing to take revenge on Diablo, Vetter strikes a deal with the very drug lord he just put away, and with the aid of his DEA partner, Demetrius, sets out to deliver his own lethal brand of justice.

Many revenge films have been hugely successful in Hollywood such as, ""Desperado"", ""The Punisher"", ""Four Brothers"", and many others.  Now, ""A Man Apart"" can be added to the list, directed by F. Gary Gray (director of ""The Negotiator"" and ""The Italian Job""), ""A Man Apart"" delivers a solid story of a broken man, that has lost the love of his life, and will stop at nothing until those responsible feel his wrath.  Vin Diesel delivers possibly his best performance to date, showing a wide range of emotions that he hadn't needed to portray in his previous films ""Pitch Black"" or ""The Fast and the Furious"", though some doubted his acting ability, Vin proves here that he is more than just another action hero.  The supporting cast is fairly strong, Larenz Tate is solid for the most part, as Vin's right-hand man, there are some weak spots in his performance, but they can be overlooked.  The action is fast-paced and frantic, but serves to show the fractured state of Vetter's life without his wife.  A problem many films of this genre can suffer from is an over-reliance on action, with not enough of a story to keep the audience engaged.  ""A Man Apart"" succeeds in eluding this pitfall, with a story that continues to engage the audience emotionally, so that the vengeance doesn't seem pointless.

If you enjoy revenge tales or are a fan of Vin Diesel, then this is definitely a movie you should see.  Also, if you are one of the many nay-sayers regarding Vin Diesel's movies or his acting, then you should put your skepticism aside and give ""A Man Apart"" a try, I believe you will quickly see that Diesel definitely has what it takes to be more than just an average action star in Hollywood.

1898893,3,B00009ZPUC,"As someone who grew up watching the action films of the 80s---Chuck Norris, Stallone, Schwarzenegger and others---I fully expected A Man Apart to follow along the same lines.  In some ways I ended up being pleasantly surprised, and in some ways I didn't.

The surprise came from the fact that Vin Diesel truly does have a fair amount of acting ability and showed good emotional range as the husband of a murdered wife who becomes obsessed with finding her killers.  Vin does well as the strong, silent type with an explosive temper.  The bad came from the fact that the basic plot of this film made very little sense, especially the big ""who-dunnit"" at the end.  Was a big chunk of the movie edited out or what?  When the main villian is revealed, it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.  As we get further along in the movie, the writing lapses into the same old cliches and tired old lines that popped up in all those 80s movies I was talking about.  The ending could have been ripped off from Cobra, Commando or one of those other flicks chock full of lame one-liners.  I expected more from the ending, frankly, but I can't say that the rest of the movie was altogether bad.  A Man Apart is worth viewing at least once.",1122595200,,1223,4.493212669683258
1898894,3,B00009ZPUC,"This is an okay movie, not a great movie. I would see it on TV but not rent, or own, much less pay full box office ticket for it. The reason? Even when Vin Diesel proves he has grown and matured as an actor, his producers haven't. Only one character in the whole movie expresses an acceptable spanish phrase, (Mateo, played by Juan Fernandez) Again the Hollywood establishment is guilty of the same offensive crime over and over. Hiring Latino ""looking"" actors for terrible spanish renditions of their lines. It seems no one cares in the end for the latino box office dollar.

The Main spanish speaking character in the movie is colombian, a pronunciation that happens to sound different than mexican, than guatemalan, than argentinian, than venezuelan; Yet he sounds like a 12 hour audio tape graduate. Also the producers fall all over again for the cliche of Colombia as a poor version of Juan Valde'z hillside, burros included.

Unlike his past attempts, this movie allows Vin Diesel to expand his acting abilities and offers us a rare glimpse of his vulnerable/sensitive side which is especially s-e-x-y.  I also loved the character of Hollywood Jack who is introduced in a humorous way in Chapter 13.  The only too minor complaints I have with regards to the movie is that it can be overly violent at certain points (or maybe I'm just a sensitive viewer) and I would have liked to have seen the relationship between Sean & Stacy developed more.  I just didn't feel that seeing them together for only 10-15 minutes of the movie was enough for me to feel the intense love and passion that he had for her.",1100044800,2,842,4.435064935064935

He plays Sean Vetter, a former gang member turned DEA agent whose street smarts make him the top dog. In the beginning of the movie, he brings down Memo Lucero and it looks like the drug empire is over. But not so fast. A new dealer named Diablo orders a hit out on Vetter at his house and the bullet meant for him accidentally hits his wife and she loses her life. He's devastated by the loss of his wife and seeks revenge against Diablo. Vin Diesel was a perfect pick for the lead role. The emotion and intensity of Vetter was captured perfectly by Diesel. And Larenz Tate as Demetrius Hicks is the perfect compliment to Vetter with his subtlety and calmness.

1898899,4,B00009ZPUC,"A MAN APART is another fine Vin Diesel sleeper. Like KNOCKAROUND GUYS, A MAN APART showcases Diesel's intense, multilayered, talented and underrated acting skills.

Vin plays himself playing Sean Vetter, former gang-banger turned DEA agent. In this tired plot, Vetter arrests cartel king Memo Lucera (Geno Silva)and sends him up for life. To fill the power vacuum at the top a mysterious figure, ""Diablo"" takes over Lucera's operation and kills Vetter's wife(Jacqueline Obradors). Vetter then becomes a vigilante, calling on his former street connections to hunt down Diablo.

Although A MAN APART has a predictable storyline, Diesel makes of this movie more than the sum of its parts. The action sequences are dynamic (if a bit chaotic), but Vin is once again hypnotically believable onscreen, and totally in sync with his character.

Vin Diesel is a much better actor than his second-tier resume of action-adventure films would lead you to think, and A MAN APART proves it.",1098489600,3,975,5.197452229299363

1898901,4,B00009ZPUC,"If you reflect back on a earlier review I did of the movie ""Pitch Black,"" you will see that I predicted superstardom for Vin Diesel. In, ""A Man Apart,"" he shows that he is about to become the leading action hero in Hollywood, clearly showing more range than Seagal, Norris, Schwarteneggar, or Stallone. Now, if we can just get him to admit that he's African-American. But more on that in another review.

In, ""A Man Apart,"" we find a crack (no pun intended) DEA team that is going after a major cartel. THey break part of it down but in an act of payback, members of a new cartel murder Diesel's wife. Big mistake. Along with his trusty DEA colleague played convincingly by Lauren Tate (Menace II Society, The Inkwell, Why Do Fools Fall in Love, The Postman), Diesel attempts to infiltrate another drug kingpin's clique, but things fall apart, and he's and Diesel is suspended for six months. But he's a man who has a missoin and doesn't let that stop him. He gathers a rag tag group of street brothers and, along with Tate, they head to Mexico for payback. I don't want to spoil the plot any more than I already have.

Diesel brings a refreshing smart mouthed toughness to the action hero genre. His approach is direct and brutal - but smooth.

1898902,5,B00009ZPUC,"It was refreshing to see Vin play a part that has emotion.  Even though this was an action flick it gave Vin the chance to expand on his acting.  He's a good actor but when all he gets is action movie roles you can't expect too much in the way of oscar-winning performances.  This is the best movie Vin's done so far in my opinion, because he shows a human side not seen in his other movies.  Even though this is typical action movie goodness it's Vin's performance that sets it apart. (no pun intended)",1091318400,,503,4.2631578947368425
1898903,4,B00009ZPUC,"This is, as everyone knows, Vin Diesel's proof that he has range and depth with a character emotionally. He himself has said he loves getting in tune with a character. (Obviously moreso with his ""Riddick"" character of course.) So A Man Apart never seemed to be even hyped so much as a fantastic movie but moreso that Vin Diesel had to be a fantastic actor.
The plot was very tired as everyone has pointed out. There are dozens of movies similar to this. A cop's significant other/child/family was murdered (sometimes, and in this case as well, the main character was supposed to be killed right along with them) ordered by a convict whom this said cop busted in some way. Cop seeks revenge. Cop gets revenge.
A Man Apart is the same way, but carried by a normally rough-and-tumble action star (ironically, even this movie is labeled ""Action"") showing that he can pull off these extreme emotional stakes. Many thought it would be laughable to see Vin Diesel nearly loose his mind and go on a killing spree to avenge his wife. But like the man or not, he pulled this role off powerfully.
Sean watching his wife die under him while she was smiling through bloodied teeth repeating ""I'm okay, I'm fine.."" while he couldn't even speak on the phone to the police was wrenching to even watch. The bloodshot eyes (when drinking on the beach behind his house), the few seconds when realization first struck in while crying his wife's name (when Demetrius had to hold him down in his hospital bed), and the ""come down"" after the purposely insane shootout after he beats the man who actually did kill his wife, cleaning his wedding ring on his hand were undoubtedly the most powerful scenes in this movie. It was impossible not to empathize somehow with Sean Vetter during some points during this film.
If you like Vin Diesel and want to see his range in a not so emotionally strong role, this is a good flick to add to your collection.
The DVD itself was awful, the deleted scenes were up to three minutes max, no behind the scenes or making-of, and no commentary that you would think/hope this kind of movie would have. If you want Vin DVD's that are WELL worth the money, buy XXX and the new unrated directors cut of Pitch Black (that also has many The Chronicles of Riddick extra also), you won't be disappointed.",1086566400,,2306,4.585956416464891

MY FEEDBACK:
1) Forget XXX or Fast & Furious, this is a much better Vin Diesle movie (Pitch Black is still his best though). Vin does some decent acting and his general charisma carry a large portion of the movie.
2) Good attempt at developing the relationship of Vin's character with other characters in the movie
3) Not a huge action flick but enough guns to keep this drama moving
4) Some suspension of belief is needed in this movie
5) Seemed the editing didn't explain a plot twist or two but cut things out leaving gaps in the story.

1898906,4,B00009ZPUC,"Vin Diesel stars as a DEA Agent out for revenge in ""A Man Apart"" and the results are solid.
THE STORY:
Former gang banger turned DEA Agent Sean Vetter makes the biggest bust of his career taking down the biggest drug distributor on the West Coast.  Before he can celebrate his victory his wife is killed in a plot of revenge.  Vetter must cope with his lose while setting out to find the people who killed his wife while keeping a new drug lord from taking over the turf.
THE COOL THINGS:
This is your standard macho tough guy ""take no prisoners"" movie.  Diesel's cool ""tough guy"" persona shines through as he makes the rounds kicking butt and taking names of all the bad guy drug dealers out there.  The powerful undertones of loss and companionship as Vetter's boys help him out makes the movie touching as well as a good action flick.
THE DVD EXTRAS:
DVD special fiends are in for a disappointment here as the movie only has 7 deleted scenes (all crappy) and trailers to speak for it.  Surprisingly there's no commentary or featurettes to speak of.
THE VERDICT:
""A Man Apart"" makes a solid rental for the evening and is definitely worth a watch.  As far getting the DVD goes, with no features to speak of this one is probably only worth the pick up by true Diesel fans and collectors.

1898907,3,B00009ZPUC,"Despite the mixed critiques, luke warm reviews, A Man Apart ain't all that bad...Diesel is still in his early stage of his acting career so there is much room for improvement...You still have to give the man an A for effort at least. But, soon he will definitely need something to really prove that he can play other well rounded or multi-faceted in-depth roles to avoid being stereo type casted or stuck as the tougher than tough and take no bs guy for the rest of his career. There's only so many limited ""don't f with me, man"" expressions viewers can take. Otherwise, it will just be Vin Diesel, well, playing Vin Diesel...
What the film may also lack in story depth it makes up for in it's quick and fast paced action. The thrilling twist did keep me as a viewer interested as to who El Diablo (the new cartel druglord taking over a major pipeline) was. Early in the film I thought it was one character but was actually surprised and got a chuckle that it was someone else ! You'll never guess who it is until towards the end...Diesel's portrayal as Sean Vetter, a somewhat renegade DEA officer, trying to smoke out El Diablo for a personal vendetta does allow Diesel's acting abilities to show some vulnerbale and emotional moments without the man totally breaking down or hitting a melodramatic melting point...
The video and audio technical aspects, well, are your average to pretty good run of the mill stuff. Surround effects are effective for ricocheting bullets, cars exploding, and  packed with rumbling bass for some pivotal scenes. The video transfer is clean and film-like with no harsh grain or color bleeding. Darks are dark to black and lights are light to bright...Clean picture, clean sound.

It's quite possibly the most tangible thing throughout the entire film.

Well, the answer is this.  ""A Man Apart"" has Vin Diesel as its star, so we expect something tense, something with action and perhaps humor.  No, though Vin Diesel still retains the same amount of charisma, it's a huge disappointment.
As I said, Vin Diesel is good as the rough and tough cop Sean Vetter.  Raised in the street himself, he knows the bad things drugs can bring to your life more than any other cops, so Sean sometimes goes too far.  This time, in Mexico, he arrests a drug kingpin, ignoring his warning: ""You don't know what you're doing.""
So far, the film is good.  And you get (and Sean gets) what he gets -- new drug cartel takes over, and his wife is murdered.  Bent on revenge, he tries to find the guy who ordered the deadly attack....
This kind of premise has been done many times, but ""A Man Apart"" attempts to give an edge to the story.  The drug king is given a certain amount of characterization.  That's a good thing if only the film is directed with assured skill of storytelling.  It has none.  Actually, I had hard time trying to figure out which is which in a certain shoot-out scene.  That kind of confusion happens again and again, and there is no substance in the second part of the film where Vin's character should be shining more.
Think about any TV cop series in the 70s or 80s, like ""Miami Vice,"" and you get the picture.  Only that the plot is muddled and the situation is confused.",1069459200,5,1655,4.415841584158416
1898911,3,B00009ZPUC,"A Man Apart (F. Gary Gray, 2003)
At this point, it's getting hard to imagine F. Gary Gray (The Negotiator, Friday, The Italian Job) directing a bad movie. Gray specializes in quick, tense, mindless action thrillers, and he seemingly never fails to deliver on the goods.
Take A Man Apart. While it may well win the race for dumbest movie title of the year (original title Diablo was scrapped after a threatened lawsuit from Blizzard Entertainment, who are doing a movie of the videogame franchise of the same name), there's nothing at all wrong with the movie itself. Vin Diesel plays Sean Vetter, a narcotics officer involved in the taking down of drug kingpin Memo (Geno Silva, who ironically appeared in the TV movie El Diablo thirteen years before) Lucero. When a new guy known only as Diablo moves in to take over Santos' old operation, he begins by trying to take out Vetter. The assassins fail, but in the process, Vetters' wife Stacey (Jacqueline Obradors, recently of NYPD Blue and Tortilla Soup) is hit by a stray bullet and killed. I don't think anyone will be surprised when Vetter and his partner Demetrius (Larenz Tate of Menace II Society fame) start cleaning house.
It's an old and well-used plot, and I'm sure a lot of people saw the twist coming at the end. (I didn't.) What makes the movie work, and work very well, is the chemistry between the characters. Gray gets emotion out of Vin Diesel for the first (and possibly last) time since Multi-Facial. The chemistry between Diesel and Tate is the best buddy-cop stuff since the first Lethal Weapon movie. It all works very well.
Two hours of pure, brainless entertainment. Naked women, things blowing up, and Riddick and O-Dogg shooting lots of people. How can you possibly go wrong? *** ",1067990400,3,1756,4.757377049180328

1898915,3,B00009ZPUC,"Vin Diesel is one of those actors who can bring an incredibly strong force to whatever movie he is in.  'A Man Apart' is no exception.  Now look at 'XXX', 'Fast And The Furious', and 'Pitch Black'.  Those three movies were all better-than-average, though none really had revolutionary plotlines.  Again, 'A Man Apart' is no exception.  The tough guys in drug-stopping bit has been done before (i.e. 'Training Day'), and over time, predictability takes this movie over.  But all that unoriginality and poor script stuff aside, Vin Diesel makes this film watch-able.  And enjoyable.
One brilliancy I noticed that put this movie above the likes of the aforementioned trio, is that, here, Diesel suffers a hardship to his personal life.  After taking down (almost personally) one of the world's most prolific dealers, Sean's (Diesel) house is broken into, and his wife is killed.  After he realizes what'd happened, he cries.  And seeing Vin Diesel cry would be/is the equivalent of hell freezing over (as they say).  But instead of carrying his sadness with him to time off from work, he quickly looks to get revenge.  In order to justify his wife's death, he plans to take down the entire drug dealing universe.  But his friends and fellow cops are not always in the same boat as he.  Sean is soon overcome by anger and rage and eventually gets kicked off the force for (indirectly) killing three officers.  But to no avail, he continues his pursuit with the help of friends ""Big Sexy"" (George Sharperson) and Demetrius (Larenz Tate).  From there it's a bang-bang, action-packed, shot-in-the-leg-twice-but-still-able-to-run ground game that is nothing short of entertaining.
If you like Mr. Diesel, you will like 'A Man Apart'.  It's as simple as that.  I think this is the best movie he's been in thus far, although this movie is far from flawless.  Again, the story is borderline been-done-before; whereas the action sequences are what make it a decent film in the first place.  Had the story been more innovative, I would've given it four stars.  However, even with a brilliant (but un-educational) performance by Vin Diesel and a crafty appearance by Timothy Olyphant ('Gone In 60 Seconds', 'Dreamcatcher'), 3 stars will have to do.

Everything just seems so cliche and generic, action scenes and scenes where Diesel is trying to be ""emotional"" just have a ""I've seen this before, and I've seen this done better"" feel to it; and in the end, A Man Apart is pretty much another excuse for Diesel to flex his muscles and blow stuff up.

1898921,1,B00009ZPUC,"A Man Apart is supposedly the story of a DEA agent played by Vin Diesel who becomes a one-man army against drug dealers after his wife is killed.  Unfortunately, it is actually an unintentional comedy about a dangerously incompetent man bent on revenge and the people (innocent or otherwise) who are hurt by him in the process.
There are numerous flaws in this movie, with just enough entertainment value to rate it a high one-star.  Most glaringly to me was the loose way Diesel's character does little to protect his identity from criminals, showing up at press conferences and living in a nice beach house (how can he afford such a house...perhaps he's not as clean as depicted).  It's little wonder his wife is killed.  He abuses his power and blows operations, yet somehow we're supposed to feel he's wronged when he is suspended.
For those who want action, there is a good deal of it, but most of it is in poorly lit situations, making the action hard to follow.  The one daytime shootout is vaguely reminiscent of the far superior shootout in Heat; yet even this scene is uninteresting, as by this point, the little sympathy for the character is completely gone.
Diesel is usually better than this.  Unfortunately (a word I need to use repeatedly in this review), while he would never be expected to be the next Olivier, in this film, he seems interested in being the next Steven Seagal.  He can do a lot better than this movie.",1062892800,4,1435,4.648221343873518

I appreciated the near realistic shootouts (but movieland please learn to re-load movie weapons at appropriate times), the need of revenge (yes, I like the woman I'm to marry) and the slow yet not boring pace to get to the end.

They flood our streets, day after day, week after week, at an average of 20 tons a month... enough to provide a line of cocaine for every man, woman and child on this planet... worlds away from the men who run the whole @#$@% show."" ~ until the end of the movie, I found myself hoping that it would work out the way it did, and that this could happen in real life. If the movie did nothing else but enlighten us ""again"" to this crisis, it served it's purpose.  I felt very sorry for the loss of his wife, as well as the wife & son of the drug lord; it seems it's always the innocents who suffer when greed and power clash with decency & morality.

When I think action I think over the top thrills and intense stunts. I think adreniline, fast-paced suspense, and a certain momentum. I didn't find any of that in this film. But what I did find was a genuinely interesting story. Perhaps the concept has been done before - but that's the case with a lot of films these days. Looking past that: the movie does have substance. It delivers believable emotion and is worth sitting through at least once. I'd say the main draw is getting to see Vin Diesel stretch his wings a bit and hit us with something fresh. Sean Vetter is a little more unique than any of his previous characters. Perhaps not dramatically so - but we can see that Vin put forth an effort. I like the direction he's moving in - and you must admit - seeing him move in a different direction is reason enough to watch the movie. This one isn't about and edgy street racer like in The Fast And The Furious. Or an attitude-driven adreniline junkie as seen in XXX. This is a story about a man who loses his wife.

1898931,1,B00009ZPUC,"I am a huge Vin Deisel fan I own all of his movies, but this one will not be joining my collection. It is a movie that has the best parts in the middle of the movie and kinda drags after that. The plot is kinda incoherrent and jumpy. This is one to rent not buy.",1054252800,2,262,3.6964285714285716
1898932,3,B00009ZPUC,"Vin does a wonderful job acting. Even though he barely sheds a tear,he facial expressions alone convey the anguish he goes through after his wife's death.
 Larenz Tate and the rest of the supporting cast do a great job also.
 The real problem lies in the script;it was obviously written in haste and without any real clarity. Any actor who can work w/ such writing deserves plenty of credit.
 But those of you who walked away completely disappointed,PLEASE don't judge Vin Diesel's acting skills by this movie alone!",1054166400,,516,4.840909090909091
1898933,5,B00009ZPUC,"Being a huge Vin Diesel fan, I saw this movie the day it opened in theaters. One thing I have always loved is that he has never done a bad movie, and 'A Man Apart' further proves that. The plot of the movie was good, Vin's performance was amazing. Never a disappointment, he has a great road ahead of him!!

1898934,1,B00009ZPUC,"The previews hinted at an average-plot action movie.  It was wrong.  Now, I don't mind Deisel as an actor.  But this movie was so poorly written that I was rooting for the bad guy to kill him just so the movie would end.  The dialogue is forced (at best) and just awful.  How someone got paid to write this (and continues to get paid to write other things) I have no idea.  The plot was thin.  The characters were thinner.  The only intriguing character was the older crime boss, and they didn't do much with him.  This is the first movie I have wanted to walk out on in a long, long time.  Of mainstream movies, they don't get much worse.",1052870400,3,639,4.206611570247934
1898935,5,B00009ZPUC,I thought this film was amazing. Vin has out done himself and so has his co-star Larenzo Tate. The movie takes you through every emotion and back again. It has you fighting the fight you know cann't be right. Plus it's a true drama not a muscle movie. I think a step in the right direction for our man. It shows Vin's diversity yet again. WOW!,1052611200,3,343,4.212121212121212
1898936,4,B00009ZPUC,"I recommend this movie...it was very enjoyable...even aside from all the drooling I did just looking at Vin on the screen...that man just rocks my world! haha...but really....Great story, nice + unexpected twist. Enjoy!",1051920000,,219,5.470588235294118

Seeing is believing.",1051920000,,77,3.875
1898938,5,B00009ZPUC,If you love Vin Diesel you will love this film. If you don't love Vin you will still like this film. This is Vin at his best. Honest hard working Sean Vetter loses his wife to a drug dealer and goes on a mission to avenge her death. It's wonderful to see such a tough guy show such emotion and love for his wife. Don't miss this film If your not yet a Diesel fan you will be after this flick!,1051660800,2,392,3.8518518518518516
1898939,2,B00009ZPUC,"I went into this one thinking it was gonna be good. What was I thinking?! The previews made the movie out to be an interesting action/drama, and it looked as though Vin Diesal was going to show some range in his acting. Well, I went to it, and I was wrong! It's just another cliche riddled action flick, with too many shoot em up scenes and abosolutly NO character development whatsoever. I have to admit, Vin Diesal did try in this one. There are scenes in this movie where he is really believable. It's just the old revenge plot that we have seen over and over again, in dozens and dozens of cop movies. Every action movie that is released these days lacks any originality whatsoever.
Diesal basically plays a man who is trying to find his wife's killer and bring him down. He has to turn in his badge after he goes nuts on the wrong guy, and he takes matters into his own hands. Thats it. I lost interest in it about half way through.
SKIP IT, or wait for the video atleast.",1051401600,,977,4.286486486486487
1898940,3,B00009ZPUC,I love Vin Diesel but I wish I'd skipped this movie. The first bad sign was the fact that this thing has actually been in the can on the shelf for about a year before being released. This usually indicates that it's a problem movie. The second really bad thing involves the death of the wife. That scene was extremely ugly and should've been shortened. You're supposed to cheer Vin on as he goes on his quest for revenge but the film is just such a sloppy mess that you probably won't care what happens. Rent XXX and watch that again instead.,1050796800,,542,4.323529411764706
1898941,5,B00009ZPUC,Man apart has many levels to the movie its a love story and a story about great loss and how far one man will go to catch the killer of his wife. For every vin diesel fan this is a must as always he makes the part of sean his own and carries you on a journy of how he deals with the murder of his wife and how far he goes to find stacy's killer.,1050364800,3,345,3.5526315789473686
