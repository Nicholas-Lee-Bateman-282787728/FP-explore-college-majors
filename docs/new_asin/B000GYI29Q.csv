8368865,2,B000GYI29Q,Not enough detail. Poor  quality and very expensive. The Master is teaching black belts which is a little strange.,1509062400,,114,5.0
8368866,5,B000GYI29Q,"I really enjoyed the second volume, it's a perfect follow up of the first one.

Explanations are clear and the techniques shown well done, I wish I had attended that seminar.
THe camera work is good and clear, it shows what a seminar should show, nothing more, nothing
less (it was a seminar, not a documenentary) and lets Gen. Amnat's teaching come alive.

I enjoyed watching it and it can be watched either alone or right after the first volume, which
is also a good point in my opinion.",1258070400,,489,4.48314606741573
8368867,3,B000GYI29Q,"Vol 2 is done much better then vol 1. The camera guy from vol 1 must have gotten fired or took some classes at the local college. No people walking/standing in front of the camera while the colonel is teaching. The audio even sounds better. Vol 2 is worth watching, but don't think you are going to pick up any great techniques for mma or street. These Dvd's 1 and 2 are more for the dreamers that just like to watch instructional dvd's, take notes and day dream about using these techniques. the techniques are like what you learn in old school karate dojos,  that don't work in real life street fights or mma fights, maybe if your fighting a drunk bum. But for someone punching/kicking with power at you, the drills in the dvds are not really useful. that's just my 2 cents. But if you are going to buy a dvd from these seminar series, I would just recommend Vol 2. It's allot more professional quality. Or better yet just get into the dojo/gym and work on the techniques you learn from your trainer/teachers. Or if you don't belong to a dojo or gym, get on the internet and find some free video, pick one or two techniques and train them, til you can do them in your sleep. please don't buy into some of these 5 star reviews, people write. I believe they are writing by people trying to promote sells of some products. I just can't see these DVD's having five stars, it just boggles my mind! maybe they got different dvd's?",1256774400,4,1426,4.360902255639098
8368868,5,B000GYI29Q,"This disk is part of a two disk set featuring Colonel Amnat Pooksrisuk, a member of the World Muay Thai Council and a career solider who graduated from the US war college. I decided to review both disks together, because anyone serious about learning the basics of bare knuckle Muay Thai should consider getting both.

The DVD's to a great job in laying down the basic foundation behind the bare knuckle arts of Thailand. Although the Colonel has a think accent, his instruction is very clear. I've heard BJJ guys from Brazil that were worse, so it really wasn't an issue.

Vol 1 lays the foundation & gives basic principals and techniques. Vol 2 focuses on skill development exercises that help build the physical structure behind the techniques. Both disks have solo exercises that remind me of the RMAX biomechanical movements Scott Sonnon teaches. For example, opening & closing your fingers ""with intent"" has made my grip much stronger. I can make a much tighter fist than before - something important for bare knuckle or MMA fighting. It's amazing that something so simple can make such a difference.

He even teaches a defense similar to the Crazy Monkey/shelling technique a lot of MMA guys have used the past few years. Funny to think that a defensive structure hundreds (thousands?) of years old was a fairly recent development in modern MMA. I was also surprised to see the Colonel teaching the looping punch used by MMA fighters like Chuck Liddel & Fedor, as well as footwork to set up strikes against the takedown. He also covered techniques to break the Thai neck clinch that I haven't seen before - some of this stuff could've saved Rich Franklin's belt & nose when he lost to Anderson Silva.

MMA fighters really need to get both disks.  The techniques & training methods could have an immediate impact your striking game.  If you are serious about the finer details of bare knuckle striking, this is the set is for you.

Filmmaker Vincent Giordano publishes a newsletter called The Vanishing Flame, which covers the martial arts of Southeast Asia.  He has other interesting DVDs as well, including some with bareknuckle matches.  You can email him at blackdiamondcobra@yahoo.com for more information.",1186617600,3,2217,4.906417112299465
8368869,5,B000GYI29Q,"This DVD runs for around 120 mins & is based on a edited seminar given by Col. Amnat Pooksrisook. I have reviewed the 1st volume elsewhere on this site. In that volume, Col. Amnat breaks down the principles & foundations of his style of bare knuckle muay. In this volume there is a lot more application. The DVD begins with a lengthy warm up which are then used in effective (& often nasty) applications. As with the previous DVD, Col. Amnat emphasises caution with some of the techniques.

Similar to the 1st DVD this is very watchable. This DVD does not require other DVDs but the 1st volume does go into greater detail on the use of the triangle (for example). Again footwork is drilled repeatedly with & without a partner.

Overall I enjoyed this DVD, it has little filler. Both DVDs have illuminated my training notes from when I have trained in Thailand (at ring thai bxg) & filled in some gaps in my knowledge.",1166140800,,917,4.518072289156627
