8230970,1,B000Y3H1O6,"This was the standard War Department Short film on the capture of Tarawa.
Nothing new, film transfer to DVD was horrible with no attempt to digitally enhance the DVD image.  I would definitely not recommend this DVD.  I was hoping that this was a much better account with much better footage, that I saw on TV as a special.  I was sadly dissapointed.",1203465600,9,350,4.523809523809524
