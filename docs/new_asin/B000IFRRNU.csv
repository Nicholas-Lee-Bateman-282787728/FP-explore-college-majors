8145327,5,B000IFRRNU,Who's determined to mess around with multiple skill toys. I'm not the greatest at poi...but this dvd is grand. I'm one of those people who buys tutorial videos and actually uses them :-P My friend Michael used to show me all these videos of the man who made this instructional gem. He's damn good at poi. I would recommend this to anybody. Doesn't matter if your a pro or just starting out. I'm sure you will get something out of this masterpiece !,1356048000,,448,4.409638554216867
