8016258,4,B0001US5Y2,"Nuku Nuku returns in Everybody Needs A Home.
There are 3 episodes now instead of 4.
One of the most bizzare (and touching) episodes appears here. Ryonouske is accidently transformed
into an alligator due to one of Mishima's idiotic concoctions. He also learns to appreciate Nuku Nuku more
even though her feline instincts can get her into trouble.
The last episode, labled a special is one of the more interesting ones overall. On a New Year's celebration, the classmates get together at a shrine. There a joke is made about the low budgets of the show. Ikenami complains that the girls aren't wearing kimonos and another character says it's because the animators weren't skilled enough to draw the elaborate detail.
In a long sequence, we get to see the classmates' families and the uncanny resemblence that they bear (both in appearance, mannerisms and hobbies).
While not as exciting as the first 2 volumes, this volume should not be passed up.",1390694400,,947,4.925
8016259,4,B0001US5Y2,"It doesn't get the full 5-star treatment because it is kind of short, (three episodes instead of four) but these are some of the best of the TV series. First, you have Shirabaka...I mean Shirakaba, challenging Nuku Nuku to a race during ""Sports Day."" The competition, in the grand tradition of the series, ends up involving two more bizarre mechas and a bunch of references to classic Anime series like Giant Robo and Ranma 1/2. Next, you have Ryunosuke running afoul of a Mishima experiment in energy drinks that scrambles his DNA with hilarious results. Then finally, Nuku Nuku thinks she has been abandoned on Oshogatsu, the Japanese New Year and the most family-oriented day of the year.
The first episode is a typical NNTV laugh riot. However, the other two episodes are really sweet and sentimental without being sappy. NNTV is a series with a lot of heart behind its madcap satire. I don't know WHY ADV Films rated this series ""12+"" because really, this is a family series...kidvid...in Japanese TV terms. About as offensive as Pokemon.
The transfer is great, although like the rest of the NNTV DVDs there are no special added goodies. I could quibble with a few of the subtitling decisions, and I haven't heard the dub yet on any of them. Die hard sub camp Otaku, sorry.
The next DVD is great too. Keep an eye out for it.",1088553600,,1329,4.659574468085107
