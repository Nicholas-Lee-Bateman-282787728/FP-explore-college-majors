7361917,5,B013C6OUAE,"Madhouse is a super under-rated/over looked comedy that only gets a 5.2 on IMDB the horrid Vacation re-boot gets a 6.2 though! seriously
another great example how loaded the ratting on any movie sites are!
This is a a solid early 1990's comedy
It's one of those films that has had countless dvd-rips mostly due to MGM never putting it out on dvd!
This movie does have a cult following and it's great we get a HD blu ray version thanks to Olive Films

The film stars
John Larroquette  as  Mark Bannister (John at the top of his game on Night Court does this film!  This is one of the only times he carries a film besides Second Sight (1989) I honestly think he does good in both films overall this film is just written much better for him

Kirstie Alley  as Jessie Bannister  (Kirstie much like John is on a top network series Cheers while doing this film) She much like John is really good in this it's fun watching her! Plus the  chemistry between Alley and  Larroquette was always very real and organic you could see these two being married........
 John Diehl  as Fred  (Mark's cousin)  This is a different role  from what  John Diehl would later do he's good while he is in it
 Jessica Lundy  as Bernice (Fred's pregnant wife) It's hard to hate a pregnant woman but, Jessica's performance is so good you're meant to loath her! and you will very quick plus her NJ  accent is so over the top but, spot on funny! at the end of the day Jessica does a bang up job
Dennis Miller as Wes  (Mark's BFF) This is Miller's first major acting role he's decent
Bradley Gregg  as  Jonathan (Mark and Jessica's shady nephew)  Bradley was a 1980's child star he usually plays the good boy in this it's not good...

The film is basically about a successful married couple that have house guest from Hell
Things get more and more out of control from a Bedridden pregnant mother to be! to a sister with her son moving in, to a cat that keeps dying and somehow coming back to life everything just snow balls from bad to worse and it's making both Mark and Jessica no longer happy they are about to snap!! If you are a fan of the first three Vacation films or Ruthless People  you'll love it  It has that vibe

The blu ray is solid it's marked down to $13.99 great price the only major negative about the blu ray is extras or lack of extras
It would've been nice to get a audio commentary by Director  Tom Ropelewski or Stars John Larroquette and Kirstie Alley you never know they might have done it I'm sure both Alley and Larroquette hear how much they are loved in Madhouse at least 2-4x's a week
It's a great film that still holds up even some of the hair and clothes look a bit outdated  9.2/10
If you love this film check out Ruthless People another film that gets over-looked",1447804800,5,2764,4.324902723735408

7361919,5,B013C6OUAE,"After waiting for years for this movie to come out...IT""S HERE this movie is a long forgotten title that the studios really don't care about anymore. The movie never received an official release on DVD but rather a manufacture on demand version that was burned to a DVD-R. So it was to my utter shock when I learned that this film was getting an official release not only on DVD but on Blu Ray as well. The picture looks shockingly good for not much love being put into it and I can say the same thing for the audio. This is well worth the money, and a word of advise I would not hold out to long on purchasing this movie because usually movies like this released by smaller studios like olive films go out of print fairly quickly, which will cause the price of the movie to sky rocket on the second hand market.",1444262400,4,812,4.245161290322581
7361920,5,B013C6OUAE,"This  may not be 'grand cinema' but is a very funny one. No matter how bad your own relatives may be when they visit, they don't compare to the ""cousins"" who overstay their welcome in this one. Although the cat has a small role here he makes me laugh too.

I waited for years for this one to come out on blu ray and now it finally has.",1442016000,2,335,3.911764705882353

8727275,5,B013C6OUAE,"This movie is laugh out loud funny from beginning to end.

The luxurious villa of Mark (John Larroquette) and Jessie Bannister (Kirstie Alley), a yuppie couple, is overrun by loads of uninvited guests who turn the house up side down. (courtesy IMDB)

So glad that it's on Blu Ray - needed this in higher quality and it's fantastic!",1483488000,2,331,4.689655172413793

8727279,5,B013C6OUAE,Great storyline and good representation of what happens with too many unwanted house guests and family. Overboard but that's what makes it so funny. I waited a long time for this to come out on blues Ray or any medium other than tape.,1462406400,3,234,4.465116279069767
