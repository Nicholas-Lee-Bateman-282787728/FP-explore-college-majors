This set contains four VHS tapes from the 1940s, the peak time for Westerns. Private detective movies began to supplant them and were more popular in the 1950s and afterwards. [A librarian told me that VHS tapes were more robust than DVD discs.] The classic Western was involved with property rights. A big landowner or cattle baron tried to drive away homesteaders and small ranchers from the area in order to grab their lands or water rights. Water is more important in the dry southwest than in water-rich states.

The Carson City Kid (1940) is a story about a search for a criminal. It warns against gambling and misidentifying a suspect.

The Yellow Rose of Texas (1944) is about a man framed for a robbery; he doesnt have the missing money. The missing wagon and strongbox are found. Will the guilty man reveal himself?

The Cowboy and the Senorita (1944) is about a young girl who wants to keep her fathers gold mine. Who wants to buy a worthless gold mine? Can this young girls property be saved?

Home in Oklahoma (1946) is about the inheritance of a valuable ranch. Will an heir be murdered so another can inherit? This story is different from the usual classic Western which avoided such personal conflicts.",1409788800,,1242,4.678899082568807
