8143881,5,B000I3ZUQS,Chic In Charge - Peep Show was never cancelled (whoever told you it was got their facts wrong). Season 5 started airing in the UK 2 weeks ago.,1210550400,,142,4.107142857142857
8143882,5,B000I3ZUQS,I ran across this show on the BBC completely by accident.  I loved it from the very first episode I watched.  I had my boyfriend watch it and he was instantly hooked as well.  It's very entertaining and the inner monolgues of Mark are very witty and funny.  He's relatable and uncomfortable and lovable.  I was hooked from the start and have my Tivo set to a season pass so that it always catched each episode over and over again.  I still always find the re-runs as funny as they were the first time I watched them.  It's too bad it was cancelled.  If your an American who enjoys subtle off-beat British humor then this show is right up your alley.,1205020800,2,649,4.305785123966942
