8689837,5,B00PYXHLN2,"After watching this film in it's entirety, it felt like the ""calm after the storm!""  We Americans have been through a lot of changes and this film put this in perspective.  A surprisingly great film to watch for those who are working, unemployed, and students.  If you felt like you were running out of energy this will give you a boost!!! Get it.... you will not regret.",1418515200,,371,4.507462686567164
