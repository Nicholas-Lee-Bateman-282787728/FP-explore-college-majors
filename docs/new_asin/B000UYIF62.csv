8215618,3,B000UYIF62,"There is interesting material in this DVD but I found it is very light on useful marketing details. The marketing information is targeted at the real beginner. The producer spends too much time demonstrating largely outdated software but skims over the marketing decisions.

For example (and this is just one example) he barely mention price (""I like to sell DVD costing more than $40""), does not discuss affiliate percentages, customer discounts... which are all important decisions but he spends a lot of time showing to fill in the screens in his 5 years-old shopping cart with those details.

It would have more useful to discuss the pricing strategy, how to use discounts to market, etc. and leave it to us to figure out how to use current software.

Again there are some useful ideas in the DVD but there's probably no more than 15 minutes of them. The remainder is a long demonstration of outdated software.",1308787200,,914,4.846153846153846
8215619,5,B000UYIF62,The best thing about this DVD is that the techniques revealed are from someone who has sold thousands of DVDs. In this DVD Bill Myers shows step by step exactly how he has sold so many DVDs.,1293408000,,190,4.162162162162162
8215620,5,B000UYIF62,"I've purchased several of the DVD's created by Bill Myers and have nothing but good words to say about them all.

In this DVD, you'll learn several great tips for promoting your own DVDs online (and these tips apply to other types of products too).

As someone with a good understanding of these tactics, I still have to say that I came away from watching this DVD having learned even more tips to add to my marketing strategy.

If you've never purchased one of Bill's DVD's, you'll welcome his to-the-point, ""regular guy"" approach to this business...a refreshing change when compared to a lot of the other ""make money"" hype you'll find out there.

You'll also want to take advantage of his companion website which expands on the videos and is hands down one of the best values you'll find online.  You can get a taste for what this DVD is like by checking out Bill's Youtube videos which also offer some great tips to expand your knowledge.",1214179200,3,941,4.610778443113772
