It is a multi-layered and multi-faceted tale told visually through incredible images enhanced with armor piercing sound effects. The dialogue really has to take a back seat to this simple tale of men and their survival because the images of the land, the bleak faces and the carnage tell it all. This film is named WINDTALKERS but the film does not really focus on the code developed by the Navajo Marines. Director Raoul Walsh had peripherally addressed the Navajo code in 1955 with his film BATTLE CRY with Felix Noriego as Marine Crazy Horse where we saw Japanese operators baffled while listening in on radio and field-telephone transmissions. Director John Woo, as did Raoul Walsh, decides to focus his attention on the men and their diverse backgrounds and what makes them Marines. However, Woo narrows his focus on the relationship between a war-weary, shell-shocked and enigmatic Marine sergeant (Nicolas Cage) and a good-natured naive Navajo recruit (Adam Beach) assigned to him. Beach can't understand the actions or behavior of loner Cage's intensity for killing and bloodshed but learns eventually that if you survive you then increase your chances of having your comrades around you survive as well. Woo is a director noted for action and WINDTALKERS contains some of the most frenetically staged sequences ever filmed. These sequences reminded me of some of Sam Peckinpah's cathartic work from THE WILD BUNCH, the montages of the combat maelstrom of his CROSS OF IRON and the intensity of the intimate fighting of combatants from Edward Zwick's Civil War epic GLORY. This is not action for the sake of action that can be easily labeled on John Woo. Woo is making a statement that all this carnage can be addictive yet simultaneously it usually creates and strengthens intimate camaraderie. But you really can never afford to be close to any of your buddies and this is a highly moral conflict. Is battle weary hardness a symptom or a mechanism to survive? This is the price of defending the ideals that we hold so dear. This is a very subtle and great film that can be easily glossed right over for its true meaning and realization. WINDTALKERS draws attention to forgotten heroes.

BEHIND ENEMY LINES looks as though it was made with all good intentions. I really wanted to like and enjoy it. Because the character motivations were never deeply explored it lacked the essence of what could have made it a good old fashioned stand-up-and-cheer movie. It moved at a lethargic pace. If the character motivations were explored in depth, lethargy would have been replaced with viewer concern and interest and it would have been a much more entertaining film. Only the confrontation between Joaquim de Almeida as Admiral Piquet and Gene Hackman as Admiral Reigart gave this film some character based emotional fiber and substance that it sorely needed. I also thought this made the Hollywood theatrics at the end of the movie were just too unbelievable and out of place. Owen Wilson, Gene Hackman and David Keith do their best with what script they are given. Actualy Joaquim de Almeida, a very underrated actor, came out the most memorable and believable.

Director Werner Herzog's RESCUE DAWN is an incredible tale of survival and the will to live. Christian Bale's performance as German-born Dieter Dengler is totally enigmatic, mesmerizing and captivating. Dengler is a Navy pilot during the Vietnam War. On a classified mission he is down over Laos and captured. Bale's performance is so aloof and curious, but is always singularly focused on escape. He may escape confinement by his captors, but the green dense jungle proves to be even more confining than can be imagined. Christian Bale's performance remains focused, but his determination is challenged time and time again. This is an interesting film based on true events. It holds your interest throughout. I love the finale even though it was criticized, but in reality its almost surrealistic and humorous feel, puts the film's entire narrative in perspective and makes it so thought provoking.",1424476800,,4256,5.009887005649717

I FULLY RECOMMEND THE PACK.",1222041600,,240,3.8979591836734695
