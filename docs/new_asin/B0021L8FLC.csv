Ugly Betty purposely goes over board with unrealistic story lines to give it the similarity to the original that the show is based off of. The show and characters jump the shark to make it more fun, sure it is unbelievable and that is what gives it it's novelty. Of course a woman wouldn't steal a dead man's sperm to take over a company, but the story lines just make it more fun and different than any other television show. I have seen every episode of the series, and it never fails to entertain (though season 3 did lose the grip of the heart of the show) it regained it and came back stronger in season 4. Amazing show worth watching. :)",1261612800,2,702,4.285714285714286

She really enjoyed watching it during the day that I would play it for her.  I was really sad that she died before she was able to see all episodes.  But my daughter came out and watched Seasons 1 & 2 and wants me to lend her Season 3. But I don't know if I want to let her have it until I am able to get it from her.  It is that good of entertainment.",1258502400,3,498,3.7142857142857144
