7595343,1,B01A9IV4XY,"Well, the movie started off pretty well. We learn that Mischa Barton wants to go to a storage unit that her boyfriend is renting. She wants to go there behind his back to find a diary he's written. In this diary, she will be able to determine if he's cheating (which she suspects). Anyway, for the first 30 minutes or so, the film is pretty good.

Mischa and her best friend arrive at the storage place and realize that the unit is on the fourth level -- but that all the storage units are underground. When Mischa and her friend get to the fourth level, it's dirty and dingy and not like the other three floors. Anyway, when they finally open the storage unit, something attacks Mischa's friend. Mischa of course, runs off and escapes into the other parts of the storage unit.

I won't spoil what happens, but Mischa runs into other characters, who are all stalked by whatever killed the friend.

There are to huge problems with this film:

1) The inconsistency and plot holes. I can't say anything else without spoiling the movie, but let's just say that the actions of the villian make NO sense, especially when the big twist is revealed at the end.

2) The ending. Again, I can't say anything else without spoiling the movie, but the ending is a huge let down.

Ultimately, the film starts off strong, then descends into typical cliche horror movie stupidity. One plus about this film: the production values of the film are high for a horror movie. The movie was well-shot with good cinematography, and didn't feel cheap like many horror movies. Despite this, it's ruined by an inane third act which makes the film completely fall apart.",1460592000,,1641,4.602739726027397
7595344,5,B01A9IV4XY,Found this at Walmart for only 9 dollars and I have to say glad I got it. Was an interesting movie and kept me on the edge of my seat towards the end.,1460419200,,150,3.5757575757575757
7595345,2,B01A9IV4XY,"This is another storage unit horror story, (Storage, Self Storage, Blood Shed,  Storage 24, The 13th Unit). Ella (Mischa Barton) with the help of a friend (Emily Atack) finds her way into a self storage unit belonging to her fiancee. Oh yes it is near closing time as usual and they only have a few minutes and no cell phone reception. The following is generic plot spoilers for this and all the films mentioned:

Wrong Unit...Check.

Something deadly in unit...check

Other people there also including someone who lives in one of the units...check

Closing time and lock down prevent their leaving....check

If I recall my high school biology, if you staple a person's mouth shut, life expectancy can not be too long.

I watched the film and felt like I have seen it at least a half dozen times before, thinking it had been released previously under a different title. I didn't see this film being done any better than the other two star productions...except for maybe that one with Eric Roberts. Been there. Done that.

7595347,4,B01A9IV4XY,"I really enjoyed the film! I found the production value to be very good as was the acting. I especially love( Robert Knepper) who is one of the mixed bag of characters visiting the EEZZEE Strorage facility this night.

(Mischa Barton) plays a woman who with a friend goes to her Fiance's storage unit to retrieve her diary which has secrets about her past she would much rather he not know. Her friend is attacked by a very freaky looking creature / person and dragged away.

There are about 6 people that get locked in the storage facility and each one has a shady story behind their visit. It turns into a fight for survival as they are stalked by the creature.

There isn't a lot of gore but what is presented is very well done and effective. But it is bloody and brutal at times. I found myself invested in most of the characters because they were .well thought out. There's not so much of a twist but a brutal realization towards the end. I found it to be somewhat fresh ,pretty fast paced and highly entertaining.

It does for creepy storage units what Jaws did for the water.",1460160000,2,1082,4.395
7595348,3,B01A9IV4XY,"I liked the storage setting in The Hoarder and the main creep was pretty ugly. Great sound effects and music too. Nice twist near the end as well. I do think they could have done more with the story though. The ending was a bit rushed, but pretty good effort. The cover is especially crazy looking. Id say worth a rent. 3.5/5",1459987200,,325,4.258064516129032

The plot was solid and surprising, the villain was extremely creepy and it was very creatively done. In a world full of horror movies that feature brainless goons with axes just cutting people to pieces, this was something different and better. If you generally enjoy horror films, you'll probably enjoy this one as well.",1459900800,2,464,4.8125
7595351,3,B01A9IV4XY,"I really like the setting of this movie and the idea isn't half bad. Just wasn't as good as I thought it could be. The acting most definitely varies in quality and the direction can get awfully slow at times. But I did like the killer, he looked awesome. His kills were a little standard but had some variety to them. There was just nothing impressive about this movie. Not bad at all and I kind of liked the ending, but far from being a memorable horror movie. 2.5/5",1455408000,4,467,4.258426966292135

7595359,3,B01A9IV4XY,"Here we have a low budget horror film The Hoarder. Almost the entire film except for a few scenes takes place in a storage unit, which wasn't a bad choice of locations I thought as it does add to the isolated, creepy atmosphere, especially the basement (4th floor). Basic plot is a group of people get stuck in a storage unit where they start to get killed off (don't want to give to much detail so as not to spoil anything). The actors do good with what they have to work with but I cant say any of them were great or standout in any meaningful way. There is little blood & gore but whats there works well enough. The atmosphere in places is really good & the movie moves at a decent pace, there is barley any bogging down in the plot which is good, I did enjoy the movie so you might be thinking why only 3 stars so here is why, the movie I feel falls apart in the last act. The first half & middle were very good but once the twist/reveal happens what was an interesting plot about the unknown becomes a normal clich horror film plot. Had it maintained what it started showing it would easily be a 4 or 4 1/2 star rating from me. If curious at least give it a rental, there is enough here to enjoy to make it worth a buy at a cheap price though.",1469059200,2,1248,4.05668016194332

7595383,1,B01A9IV4XY,"The Hoarder is one of those movies you think will be good then you're happy when it starts out good but eventually is disappointed because it turns out to be a waste of time.

The Hoarder starts out as a typical but promising horror movie. The acting is on point, there's tension within the first 10 minutes, and the plot seems somewhat plausible with semi-likable characters. Then the kills begin and the movie gets 10x better. Despite taking place in a very repetitive location, there's a lot of atmosphere and the creature is very creepy. Then, for no apparent reason, the movie goes on a downward spiral.
- Spoiler Alert Below This Line-
The ""leader"" of the group turns into a major jerk; realistic reason but actions contradict the first half of his depiction. The characters' actions go from ""fight or flight - with caution"" to downright stupid. The killer isn't who you think it is, which was okay, but their movements make no sense (along with how they've gone unnoticed for so long). And the worst part: the ending makes absolutely no sense on TWO separate plot developments. The first one is when the lone survivor risks her freedom for a notebook - yes, there's a bit more to it but it's still just as ridiculous as that sounds. And the second one is when her fianc decides not to look for her after going to the last place she was... to look for her. *sigh* I know. Like, he literally asks if the attendant has seen her then proceeds to talk about how he misses her then declares he's not going to continue searching for her. So stupid and made absolutely no sense.

There are worse movies than The Hoarder but I judge movies like this harsher because the writers unnecessarily ruined a good story for a cheap ending. Their selfish actions made me wasted more time than necessary and I hate movies like that. Don't bother buying let alone renting!",1462233600,2,1859,4.57957957957958

7595385,3,B01A9IV4XY,"This movie starts out well, playing into the intrinsic eeriness and mystery of storage facilities. Then it ends a little more creatively than many low-budget thrillers. However, its middle is pure ""Friday the 13th"" retread. We have a variety of trapped younger people wandering around, fractioning off to meet terrible fates when left alone. Along the way, they hurl course insults at each other.

However, 2/3 of a fairly decent movie was enough to keep me interested and feel I hadn't wasted my time watching.",1461888000,,511,5.011764705882353

I remember seeing the trailer for this film and being completely intrigued by it. I loved the location of the story and the creature looked great, I was in. so when it was released onto DVD I went and picked it up immediately. So I called up my brother and we headed over to my grandparents house, they love watching these horror movies with us.

The story follows two friends who go to a storage unit place since one of them thinks that her man is hiding something there. So after getting in they soon unlock a door that should have always remained locked. Something or someone is now loose in the building and they must fight for their lives in order to survive. Of course it makes it harder when they get locked inside.

I thought this was an interesting movie that had a great setting and hook to it. Over all I thought it was good but it wasn't a hit amongst all of us. My brother wasn't too impressed by it although he thought it was OK. Writers Matt Winn [also directed], James Handel and Chris Denne did a good job with this film as I thought it was good. I would like to see them come together again for a future project. The acting in the film is good with some better than others nd like I said I loved the way the creature looked.
