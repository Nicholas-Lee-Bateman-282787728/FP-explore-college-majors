7884112,2,6305165106,"Maybe I expect too much from a bloopers video, but I wasn't really impressed here.

The good things first.  There are some good bloopers of some NFL and college teams.  I really liked some of the bloopers involving the refs (one ref even picks up the ball during the play-you can't do that), and bloopers can be great family fun.

I don't mind that some of the bloopers seem to be from obscure college teams, CFL games, and USFL leagues.  That's fine.  But the video consistently shows ""bloopers"" that aren't.  Just because a football player drops the ball doesn't mean it's a blooper--fumbles happen all the time.  And football players run into each other.  It's football.

Moreover, the bloopers are consistently shown again later in the video.  Do they think we won't remember the bloopers from earlier?  Give me a break.

These drawbacks make me feel like the more the viewer knows about football, the less funny they will find this video--that's not good.  Also, people with short-term memory loss will enjoy this video more because they won't remember that bloopers from earlier are appearing again.  It's not the worst collection of bloopers, and I laughed out loud here or there, but it wasn't the best I've seen.",1110499200,,1221,4.802884615384615
7884113,1,6305165106,"I bought this movie to show my flatmates in Scotland the joys of American Football. We all gathered around the TV on Thanksgiving and watched this movie and soon realized it consisted of about 10 minutes of footage that is repeated throughout the film. The only diffence is the annoying commentary and perhaps the most horrific soundtrack ever created changes slightly.

Seriously, the same footage is shown 2 or 3 times...it's crazy. I would not except this movie for free much less buy it again. The only good thing that resulted from this movie was the joy we felt as we repeatedly smashed the VHS after it was over. Yes we did watch the whole thing in hopes that there would be one moment of goodness...but alas there was not.

DO NOT BUY",1106092800,,742,4.571428571428571
7884114,1,6305165106,"This is one of the poorest quality videos I've ever seen. The graphics and voice-over are amateurish and worse - not funny. The picture quality is terrible. And most of the so called bloopers are just routine plays. Many of the teams represented are unrecognizable to American NFL or college ball fans. They appear to be CFL or European NFL minor league teams, or perhaps from one of the now defunct (USFL, WFL, etc.) NFL competitors. That wouldn't be a concern if the clips were amusing or interesting on any level, but unfortunately they are neither.",1105747200,,552,4.760416666666667
7884115,3,6305165106,"Also known as ""Crash Mania"". Five hours of motor sports action on three DVDs is absolute party-time fun, only if you're a die-hard  enthusiast who care the very less over below-average video quality and  muffled announcers speaking out of a king-size glass bottle. The experience  contains a massive variety of banging thrills and slippery spills from  monster trucks, hot rods, motocrossers, Indy cars, and lots more -- and  there's bikini-clad models to tantalize. Its quiz portions consisting of  five true-false questions about driving safety has some cleverly old stock  footage shown for eight seconds, but unless you know the answers with a  snap of the brain, they can get really boring (after all, you just might  learn something!). There also should have been more sections to choose in  the scene access (only eight in each disc). If you have a closet space of  old sports blooper tapes, this isn't the best recommendation to justify  another DVD addition. For some, this is worth the pleasure since tracking  problems won't harm your faithful DVD machine. A reasonably good buy aimed  at motormaniacs.",966643200,2,1113,5.111111111111111
