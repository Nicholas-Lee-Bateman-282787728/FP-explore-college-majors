1406688,2,B000059H8K,"It's a bit silly that Image included both a stereo and 5.1 DD soundtrack on ths disk because it's a direct port from the video and is almost entirely in mono!!!!  Only two songs from the entire program are presented in stereo, and there is no use of center channel or surround.  Of course, one would expect this for the older footage but for the 90's material this is inexcusible.  As if that weren't enough, the audio tracks are very dirty with lots of digital artifacts.  Unless you just can't live without the slightly improved video offered here or plan to watch it 1,000 times most ELP fans will probably want to stick with a VHS copy of this one.",987552000,5,652,4.408333333333333
1406689,2,B000059H8K,"Long-term ELP fans will be annoyed by the chatty dressing-room approach to the history of the band. None of the discussions were particularly interesting, and added nothing to the collection of videos. I'm sure there are better films of ELP out there, and someday a fine producer will make a better presentation.",986688000,8,312,5.019230769230769
1406690,2,B000059H8K,"This dvd was disappointing, knowing of the quality of ELPs work made this dvd hard to swallow. First off the quality is low with popping and clicking across the entire length of this dvd. The fact that is from 1992 is no excuse, I have an Ozzy concert from same year with much higher quality. Then on top of this not one whole song is ever played constantly being over shadowed by talking in the middle of songs is no way to make a dvd thats what extras are for. Its apparent that these people {the ones who produced this} had no idea how to make a good dvd. I do not like a supposed concert dvd with less music then talking. Ohh well with the poor quality it does not matter all that much. I was expecting so much more out of one of my favorite bands of all time. Don't buy it unless your a hardcore ELP fan even then.... Try the new Live DVD from ELP it's much better. On a side note for pure reference it's intresting historical perspective.",986169600,6,944,4.163934426229508
1406733,5,B000059H8K,"What a bunch of whiners the other reviewers are. Most of the criticism is that this isn't a concert film - well, it was never advertised as such. This release is more like an episode of VH1 Behind the Music - a great bio of one of the greatest prog rock bands of all time. Lots of great archival footage, behind-the-scenes, etc. This is not a concert film as such, but if you dig ELP, and want to spend some quality time with the band, you'll be pleased.",1078617600,11,454,4.170454545454546
1406734,4,B000059H8K,"....that a lot of DVD's out now are just straight reissues of product previously only available on VHS, hence no extras.
The critisism I've read for this release is unjust.  Complaints of ""they don't know how to make a DVD"" are rediculous.  This is the exact same material that was on the original VHS and it's about the same price as when I bought the VHS new.  Some may complain that interviews interrupt the music constantly and I agree, that is annoying if it's supposed to be a concert film.  However, this is a DOCUMENTARY!  That's the way they are.
And it's not a bad documentary at all.  There's cool old footage and new interviews with the band during the comeback ""Black Moon"" period.  I do feel they could have gone a little bit more in depth and shown more old footage and presented more interviews but what is there is fine.  Not outstanding, but entertaining enough for ELP fans.",1073520000,12,893,4.5375
1406735,1,B000059H8K,"Sometimes things are not what they appear to be on the cover. And this is one. If you want a DVD that is mostly interviews and interrupted music, this is for you. Cutting in and out of the outstanding perdormance of Pirates was horrible. This DVD is an injustice to a great band.",1057449600,19,279,4.283018867924528
1406736,2,B000059H8K,I was hopeing this would show the band in concert but that is not what you get here a lot of talking not much rocking there a great band and I hope one day to see them on a dvd or vhs that shows how great they are have not seen it so far!,1019001600,2,238,3.425925925925926
1406737,2,B000059H8K,"When I bought this DVD I thought I would see more of the shows and less talking, or at least, the interviews apart from the shows (as Alice Cooper's Welcome to My Nightmare).  Unfortunately most of music DVDs are released this way: interviews over the music/show. I liked the old footage, but I think there would be at least ONE complete song. ELP version of ""Fanfare"" is one of my favorite pieces but I didn't like the way they glued it from two different shows (it works best on CD). For die-hard fans only!",1012867200,,509,4.414893617021277
1406738,1,B000059H8K,"Emerson, Lake & Palmer are famous for their incredible music, and when you buy a DVD you want to listen to their music: well, this DVD has only history... a little live music here and there but 90% of all are words... ...!",1012435200,,222,4.186046511627907
1406739,2,B000059H8K,"Very frustrating! ELP is one of my all-time favorite bands and there are so few movies on them. I guess someone tried to make some bucks out of this situation. The info on the box is misleading. There is not a single complete song available in this disc. Several interviews and footage were old and already presented on the multimedia track of their King Biscuit Flour Hour Live CD. This disc is simply a patch of old material, not exactly a documentary project. The Dolby 5.1 track is awfully mixed, so bad that I preferred to listen to the Dolby 2.0 one.
A shame to release a disc with mostly old interviews available elsewhere, and glimpses of live performances. I guess the new ELP Live at the Albert Hall is the one I should have bought. Unfortunately it wasn't available at the store on the day I was easily fooled to buy this one as a real ELP DVD. The Welcome Back DVD should be a freebie/complement to the Albert Hall Live DVD, not sold as a separate stand-alone item.",1008633600,8,977,4.433333333333334
1406740,1,B000059H8K,"After reading the DVD box, I was looking forward to seeing a live performance by one of my all time favorite bands, but there's not one complete song on the entire DVD.  Instead you get a tease of live footage and a lot of idle chatter that adds nothing.  The sound quality is poor at best and the video footage is worse.  Don't waste your money on this title.",1002499200,3,360,4.188405797101449
1406741,3,B000059H8K,"I have to agree with the other reviews of this DVD, in that no whole songs are played, and that is basically an INTERVIEW DVD.  However, I guess that is why I liked it, because it presents the background of ELP that many of us haven't heard before.  I've been a fan of ELP since day one, and saw their 1977 concert tour with the full orchestra BEFORE they had to abandon it.  So, seeing the bits and pieces of that tour on the DVD brought back a lot of memories.  But, I agree that ELP should put out a REAL concert album, like the California Jam concert, which I feel was their greatest work ever!  I mean, it's about time and we've all waited long enough!",995500800,2,657,4.141732283464567
1406742,1,B000059H8K,This DVD is disappointing even for a die-hard ELP fan like me.  There is not one complete song on the entire DVD.  Its value as a documentary is low due to poor video quality and bizarre combinations of interview clips overlaying what little music there is.  Can I get my money back?,994291200,,283,4.403846153846154

7933592,5,B000059H8K,"If you've seen the concerts, own the albums, know the songs, this dvd's for you. It's not a concert, it's a documentary. There are plenty of the songs we know, but not cohesively done as one concert vid. There's much talk, background info, photos and footage from the whole lifespan of the band. This is meant for the hardcore ELP fan, as I am. Not meant for dilettantes. Pass it up if you're looking for a regular concert. Snatch it up if you can't get enough ELP.",1308960000,,465,4.35632183908046
7933593,1,B000059H8K,"Don't waste you time on this.  All of the performances are chopped up with cheesy interviews.  On the other hand, if you are such a total ELP fan that you will enjoy little excerpts of performance mixed in with little excerpts of interviews, maybe you'll like.  Personally, I don't get it, and I wish that I had known what it was before I bought it.",1242864000,,349,4.338461538461538

7933596,1,B000059H8K,"Worst forty dollars I've ever spent. The other reviews say it all. I'm just gonna say that I was torn between this and Live at Montreaux (which also happened to be much more reasonably priced) but chose this because the back had a large songlist (implying you could actually LISTEN to the songs) with ""Karn Evil Nine"" and ""Tarkus"" included. I was assuming it had the pieces it named. Not so. It had a small snippet of footage of the beginning of the second part of the first impression of Karn Evil Nine in concert, which quickly cut to TALKING. (Which wouldn't have been a surprise if the package had been completely honest with me. But then, of course, how can they have sold this crapfest at the ridiculous price they do with complete honesty?) And as far as ""Tarkus"" goes, it only had a bit of live footage of the middle section in Mass, and Keith Emerson playing Eruption on the piano. (Which was actually pretty cool, but it's not what I paid for.)
Conlclusion: I wouldn't pay $10 for this documentary, and neitehr should you, now that you're informed, unlike I was.
Also, previously to this DVD, I'd never heard their new stuff before: It blows.",1123891200,7,1152,4.543269230769231
7933597,1,B000059H8K,"Our time will be remembered for its music, not its politicians.  Who remembers which king ruled Austria during Mozart?  The same must be said about producers of this DVD.  Folks behind the scene decided to get on the wagon of history by cutting up some immortal music and mixing the pieces with some interviews with the musicians.

Joking is not appropriate here.  You, the scissors-happy fools need to know that in the Ukrainian coal mines in the 1970-th and 1980-th my now dead brothers were yelling `oo a lucky man he was!""  You owe some respect to the only source of excitement in the endless dark labyrinths.  We, the Emerson, Lake and Palmer fans, formerly or presently oppressed, demand release of all row footage in fool, no cuts, no butchering!  No picking and choosing, please!  Hadn't we had enough of the censorship!  Interviews belong at extra-bonus section.",1107129600,11,871,4.863945578231292
