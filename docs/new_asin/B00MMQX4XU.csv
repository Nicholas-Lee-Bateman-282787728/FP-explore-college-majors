8673080,5,B00MMQX4XU,"For what this is, a 1964 romp through Alexandre Dumas territory, with a very likable cast doing amicably for a French production then, it is pretty good.  Very entertaining, director Christian-Jacque handles the period production well with Alain Delon and Virna Lisi showing what had made them A-listers.  Adapted by Paul Andreota, Christian-Jacque and Henri Jeanson from the novel by Alexandre Dumas, ""The Black Tulip"" is quite funny, and, I think, purposefully leaves us dazed.  Dawn Addams (""The Moon Is Blue"") and Akim Tamiroff offer fine support among others.  The music is by Gerard Calvi and Henri Decae was responsible for the photography and costuming by Dario Checci.  It is a Georges Cheyko production.  The real star of success if Video Dimensions, which has brought us this delight.  The company not long ago put out a serious edition of Damiani Damiani's ""The Witch In Love"" and the black and white film bordered on being closely muffled, but with ""The Black Tulip"" they came through with flying colors, literally, as the film is in color and French with your choice of yellow or white subtitles.  Even the many scenes at night are presented quite visible and I lift any reservations from their capable hands.  The DVD comes with a trailer and other previews plus a cartoon, ""The Figurehead"" based on the tale of Highwayman Dick Turpin.",1465257600,4,1350,4.964444444444444
8673081,5,B00MMQX4XU,"This is quite a romp with Alain Delon delighting in what for him must have been a departure from his usual fare.  His supporting cast is fine and the story moves along as an adventure movie should.  His enthusiasm carries the day and makes for an enjoyable film.  You can see him warming up for his much lauded turn as Zorro which is still a few years down the road.  The ladies will find him in peak physical condition.  His charm and beauty are at their Zenith with this motion picture.  If you are a collector of his works this is a must have.

For an evenings entertainment you can't go wrong with this.",1461283200,2,607,4.271929824561403
