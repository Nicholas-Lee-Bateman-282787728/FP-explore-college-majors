8129898,1,B000GAKQIA,"This is Not really Jan and Dean.  There are clips of Dean and later Jan introducing videos.  They are videos of people who are NOT Jan or Dean lip-syncing Jan and Dean songs but the songs are not the originals and do not even sound like they are done by Jan and Dean. There is no explanation of what you are seeing or why.
Save your money and get ""Jan and Dean One Last Ride"".",1246665600,5,376,4.0
