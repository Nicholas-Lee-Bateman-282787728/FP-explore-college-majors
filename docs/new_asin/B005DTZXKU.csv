8467496,1,B005DTZXKU,"Less than one star. First disc most of the time wouldn't open to menu just would be blank screen sometimes would start on first movie. Would continually freeze and ""couldn't read disc"" quite a few times throughout movie. When it did open to menu once or twice tried other movies and same issue repeatedly in different spots freezing. This was on my BOSE system tried two other cheaper players in house plus computer same issue. Worse when it would freeze in my BOSE it wouldn't eject disc tray. BOSE doesn't have a manual eject for disc tray. Had to unplug numerous times before it would eject. Returned and re-ordered cause wanted movies for my collection. Second replacement disc at least opened to menu consistently, but freezing problems all thought out three movies and ""couldn't read disc"" and wouldn't eject like first one. Very poorly burnt DVD's to fast write speeds on burning process. Tried cleaning both disc numerous times with no results. What did play seemed like original quality recordings from yesterday",1526083200,,1021,4.941860465116279
