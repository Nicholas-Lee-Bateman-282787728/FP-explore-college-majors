8530288,1,B006RFGKYC,"I pre-ordered this a few years ago. cost me a nice bit of money at the time but I liked spirit world 2 so I thought I'd try this out. It never came, we kept getting reassurances that it would be soon on one of the internet radio shows I subscribe to and any attempts to contact them have been for naught. Not even a typed response as I've sent several emails to any facet of this ""company"" that I could think of. I have now attempted to just get my money back through the means I used to pay with little to no luck and obviously they're no help.",1382918400,2,545,3.963636363636364
8530289,1,B006RFGKYC,"I ordered this DVD from enigma productions USA on March 24,2012 for 30.99.  It was a pre-order and I had done business with this company before with no problems.  I never received this DVD or got my money back.  I have left at least 10 messages on their answering machine (never a real person) and have sent them numerous e-mails.  Never got a reply back.  Be careful when ordering anything from this company (Enigma Productions USA).  I reported it to Paypal (that's how I paid) and they could do nothing because the time limit for reporting was over.  It was a pre-order.....how convenient was that.  If there was a problem I would assume that they would get a hold of me and let me know.  I can only assume that they wanted my money and didn't intend on sending me anything in return.",1374451200,2,787,4.4475524475524475
