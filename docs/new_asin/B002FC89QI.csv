8368946,4,B002FC89QI,"Anything for Her is the English subtitled version of the French language film Pour Elle.  It's a nice what would you do if in his shoes movie.  Basically an innocent mother is jailed for the murder of a work colleague since she moved the murder weapon that was blocking her car in the staff park and no one else saw a homeless woman running away from the scene.  She's not handling jail and the fact her appeals have been used up and has tried to commit suicide.  Her husband knows the only hope she has is if he breaks her out of jail. They also have a son to further complicate matters and be a further motive to get her out. But he's just a school teacher, what does he know about successfully escaping jail and avoiding capture as a fugitive, so he'll have to do some research talking to a guy who escaped numerous prisons and venture into the violent underworld to get what he needs.

It's a nice story. you the viewer certainly might well have done some things differently but the flaws of the character and his desperation work well for the film.",1491696000,,1053,4.3520408163265305
8368947,5,B002FC89QI,"This tense, passionate, driven, thriller is an excellent introduction to the oeuvre of contemporary French crime drama. It is well acted, of course, due to the undeniable talents of Vincent Lindon and Diane Kruger. As a result, the viewer identifies completely with both of their characters, which is essential, as you would not care about the film otherwise. Totally believeable and well-paced.",1461542400,,395,5.387096774193548
8368948,4,B002FC89QI,"Love's constant flame seems to be at the heart of the excellent French romantic-thriller ""Pour Elle"" (2008, aka ""Anything For Her""), starring Diane Kruger (as the wife Lisa) and Vincent Lindon (as the husband Julien); co-written/directed by Fred Cavay; story by Guillaume Lemans; edited by Benjamin Weill. The premise: Lisa is arrested and whisked away to jail for a crime she did not commit (in her home in front of her husband and son); in short order she is found guilty and given a prison sentence. Similar to the Robert Cummings' classics of the 1940's where the theme was about `an innocent man wrongly convicted - who must now flee for his life or end up in prison'; Cummings perfected the role in ""Saboteur"" (1942) and other similar-plot films during his long career. His shadow seems to be ever present in the tightly-woven plot of this very movie.

In ""Pour Elle"", we witness Lisa's agony (which propels Julien into extreme `heroic' action); consequently, it triggers our empathy with her unjust imprisonment. Dramatic tension is ignited like a flame from hell within her helpless cries to her husband. We identify with Lisa and Julien on many complex levels: because they are noble and true to their marriage vows. His absolute devotion to her bespeaks of his own truth, humility, and extreme loyalty; he will rescue her or die trying. He `the husband-garde du corps' will climb into the abyss for her. That is high romance within a tragic plotline. That is noblesse oblige at work, even in a topsy-turvy morality play like this one where unjust events dictate uncivil conduct.

When we approach an impassioned, desperate `highly emotional' storyline, we are eventually called upon - to accept the breaches of civil and legal conduct (that must be made by our noble protagonist to complete his mission), to overlook the felonies and crimes commited by our hero - within the context of a husband's supreme duty to rescue and protect his wife - to the best of his ability. Truly Julien does exactly that. His love remains constant even when he is beaten to a pulp by thugs. In addition, her sacrifice as an innocent woman draws us into his plight to free her legally first and then free her illegally second. It is a choice that Julien is forced to make. His extreme devotion to Lisa draws us into the flame of passion - where he will remove all barriers to get her out of prison and to an unknown sanctuary.

Long into the night we can wonder aloud about the pure devotion of Julien for his wife Lisa.",1332806400,2,2511,4.728310502283105
