5691229,4,B00C6ACW80,"Am I reviewing this product? That depends on what ""the product"" is. I have not seen this DVD. I HAVE seen the story. It can still be seen in episodic pieces as a BBCi Flash animated production at http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/webcasts/index.shtml. The story is good and the then new, 9th Doctor is, too. This Doctor, who is not included in the Canon, is portrayed by Richard E. Grant, who actually played The Doctor, briefly, in Steven Moffat's hilarious Comic Relief spoof, ""The Curse of Fatal Death"".  Roz Kaveney, in the Amazon.com Editorial Review of the skit on VHS, wrote, ""...[Richard E. Grant's] performance indeed gives one uncomfortable thoughts about roads not taken...""  I agree. R.E.Grant would have made a fine Doctor. But a different choice was made for live action, so ""Scream of the Shalka"" stands to one side as a single play. The story and performances are worth watching multiple times. I've watched the streaming version at least a half dozen times, and always enjoyed it. If the DVD has the story stitched together with fewer breaks than the streaming version, and if the picture and sound are of the same clarity, any Doctor Who fan should find this worth buying.",1368835200,21,1195,4.97

5691231,4,B00C6ACW80,"There are times in life when even if your dream comes true, its not quite in the way you imagined it. So went the experience of the team behind the first ever fully animated Doctor Who story, Scream of the Shalka. What they created may not be one of the fondest remembered episodes in the Who-verse, but it may be the most important.

Back in 2002 the original team of folks behind this were coming off some interesting experiments happening with online storytelling and animation. The BBC had two official websites, with one leaning more towards pop culture and the media front and the other more focused on the news. The team noticed that the 40th anniversary of Doctor Who was soon approaching and the BBC had made no mention of doing anything special for it. The famed character was still viewed at the time as a historical novelty with only a niche following.

It was agreed that some type of remembrance should celebrate the anniversary and this team charged forward with the idea of making a brand new animated story and launching it online using flash animation. They asked BBC if it was cool and found out they were golden as long as they could get all the rights sorted out, which they did. Off they went and the work was quick and tough, but thrilling.

Suddenly people started asking the BBC questions at press conferences about whether or not a celebration was being planned for the anniversary and would the show ever come back. The reply was they would love to bring the show back, but the rights were too tied up and unavailable. This was a rather big shock to the folks working on Shalka since they believed they had the rights all sorted out. The BBC got reminded about them and called them immediately to headquarters, likely in order to yell at them. But the Shalka team came prepared with all their documentation about the rights and they were allowed to continue on the special.

This brief and momentarily tense meeting was only a brief bump in the road in terms of Shalka production, but it planted that seed that Doctor Who could actually come back fully on television. Once that connected with an ambitious woman at the head of development the ball began to roll and it very quickly led to the 2005 reboot and the rebirth of a modern day franchise. The premiere of the new series quickly overshadowed the online Shalka production which hit the web only a few months before the show came back to air. The story was quickly dumped into the annals of Who history and left to gather digital dust, even though it actually won an award for digital animation at the time.

Yet I think it deserves to be told that without Shalka the current phenomenon may not have come to bear, or at least not in the time frame it did. Also, for Richard Grant, the actor who voiced the Doctor in this tossed aside project, he did get to come back years later during the seventh season with Matt Smith as The Great Intelligence. Another factoid is back in 2003, then fanboy and future Doctor himself, David Tennant, got to voice a five line character (Second Warehouse Worker) in the animated episode.

So while it might not be a great story in contrast to the last seven years of modern day Doctor Who, it was an integral stepping stone to getting us there.",1390521600,5,3260,4.5451448040885865

5691233,4,B00C6ACW80,"We must admit, as an animated feature, we did enjoy this but had a difficult time trying to see the main character as the Doctor. He looked more like a ""vampire"" than our beloved Doctor Who"". We understand that the idea for the animation formed when it had been apparent that the series was not going to continue (before it was brought back with Christopher Eccleston's 9th incarnation) and so they had great leeway to create the doctor any way they wanted... If you try hard you might be able to see how he could be the next generation up from the 8th Doctor, Paul Mcgann. Using a robot to mimic The Master as the Tardis Companion for the Doctor added a humorous element to the story-line and at least he ressemble the original Master. As we like anything Doctor Who, it is a nice addition to our Library but don't expect a Brilliant story line. It was made for a Saturday morning cartoon fare!",1386720000,3,895,4.430303030303031
5691234,3,B00C6ACW80,"There is so much of a Doctor Who craze going on these days that it is hard to remember the period before the new series had revived interest in the long-standing British sci-fi series. Prior to the 2005 return, this animated story was an attempt at breathing new life into the beloved character. Richard E. Grant lent his voice to an animated Doctor, the ninth doctor in a continuing line of time-and-space traveling aliens.

  Originally broadcast on the internet, this is not a headlining Doctor Who feature. The highlight of this package merely comes from the fact that it was previously unavailable, as plans to release it were cancelled after interest in the franchise moved elsewhere. Despite minimal impact, there are plenty of special features on the disc. Paired with the animated feature is an audio commentary track with writer Paul Cornell, director Wilson Milam and producer James Goss. There is also a making-of featurette, archive interviews, and a history of the BBC website which debuted this feature.

The story is very good, unfortunately some of the characterization (especially the Doctor) wasn't very well thought out. Every Whovian should have this in his or her collection.",1380844800,2,263,4.9772727272727275
5691236,3,B00C6ACW80,"""Scream of the Shalka"" was originally released as 6x15 minute Flash animation webisodes by the BBC to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the program when there was no Doctor Who program currently on-air in 2003.  Shortly afterward, BBC One had decided to bring Doctor Who back to the tele and then-showrunner Russell T. Davies in an interview with Doctor Who Magazine announced that the new television Doctor (played by Christopher Eccleston) would be the Ninth Doctor, relegating Richard E. Grant's Ninth Doctor to an alternate Whoniverse. Davies later commented that Grant had never even been considered for the role in the new series, quoted as saying in DWM: ""I thought he was terrible. I thought he took the money and ran, to be honest. It was a lazy performance. He was never on our list to play the Doctor. Therefore it exists outside of the continuity canon of the Whoniverse.""  A bit harsh I'd say.

David Tennant even has a cameo.  There's no denying the significance that ""Scream of the Shalka"" contributed to Doctor Who's long-awaited return to the airwaves and it's a fascinating look at an attempt to give the fans new material in another media format during a period when we only had the Big Finish audio dramas to keep the show going after Paul McGann's singular appearance as the Eighth Doctor in the Americanized&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Movie-Special-Edition/dp/B0049S1NYG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: The Movie (Special Edition)</a>.

5691238,4,B00C6ACW80,"Doctor Who: Scream of the Shalka is one of my all-time favorite Doctor Who episodes and that's saying a lot because I'm not normally a fan of animated features unless they're from Disney! I was more than a bit skeptical going into this. A few of the reasons that I enjoy the live action series so much is the little nuances and amusing facial expressions of the actors on the screen. It's impossible to catch the twinkle of the eye or even something like the movement hair. Surprisingly, even though these details weren't present in this feature, the actors voicing the Doctor, Alison, and even the Master really brought the characters to life. Richard E. Grant, Sophie Okonedo and Derek Jacobi are just a few of the famous actors who lent their voice talents to this little masterpiece and later starred alongside the Doctor in the live action series. You know how great they were in the new series so you can imagine how wonderful they were in this animated bridge between classic and new Doctor.

Now for the monsters -- the Shalka. The Shalka, a reptilian-like alien species didn't have much to say, but as you may have guessed from the title of the DVD, their screams are quite grotesque -- not to mention the fact that they took over human bodies to lead earth and humanity into death and darkness. Aliens that can grow out of human foreheads is enough to give anyone the shivers! The Shalka are indeed a very frightening alien, up there with the Weeping Angels and the Silence.

I was very impressed with the animation, the story-line, the monsters, and each of the characters. As much as I enjoyed this, I was a little disappointed that the ending was left open for more adventures with the Doctor and Alison but to my knowledge, there never were any. Still, Doctor Who: Scream of the Shalka is yet another wonderful DVD for anyone who loves Doctor Who and for those who want to build their DVD library with shows the whole family can watch and enjoy together.

Doctor Who Scream of the Shalka is available now on DVD from Amazon and other stores.

More often than not I am greeted with a blank stare, followed by a 'Huh?'. At least it gives me the chance to explain the story around this webseries that treated us briefly to Richard E. Grant as the (at the time canonical) Ninth Doctor. Before the series even premiered on the BBC website the TV series was returning with a different Ninth Doctor, rendering the Shalka Doctor an AU (Alternate Universe) Doctor. Nothing against Christopher Eccleston (he's my second favorite Doctor) but this story was my introduction to the world of Doctor Who and as such will always have a special place in my heart.

8577592,4,B00C6ACW80,"Welcome to the Richard E Grant era of Doctor Who. Blink and you'll miss it.

Those words, spoken by its executive producer James Goss in the DVD documentary Carry On Screaming, more than adequately describe the reputation of Scream Of The Shalka. Originally produced with the intention of being the first story in a web based continuation of the then still canceled series, this animated Doctor Who webcast from 2003 has often been neglected, if not downright forgotten, by fans. With its long awaited DVD release last year, the story has been enjoying something of a much needed reexamination.

There is Richard E Grant's Doctor for example. Grant's Doctor (originally intended to be the Ninth before being replaced by Christopher Eccleston) feels like something of a cross between the Doctors of the Old Series and the New. There's an aloofness that brings to mind the First and Sixth Doctors while his rather abrasive attitude towards the military (and especially Major Kennet) calls to mind the Third's early dealings with UNIT. In other ways this Doctor has intriguing pre-echoes of the New Series Doctors that were to follow within just a couple of years. Grant's Doctor has a hurt quality to him with something and someone in his past haunting him which only the events in the story start to help him recover from while some of the dialogue could easily be delivered by the likes of David Tennent or Matt Smith. Like Paul McGann's Eighth Doctor, we get only a glimpse of this Doctor and it's something that makes judging his Doctor more difficult but there's certainly plenty of promise here.

The story also has a god cast, some of whom would go onto appearances in the New Series. Perhaps the most obvious connection to the New Series is Derek Jacobi as the Master, a role he would play in a different context in the New Series episode Utopia (and who also in 2003 played a version of the Doctor in Big Finish's Doctor Who Unbound story Deadline), though the character here has a rather interesting development. There's also Sophie Okonedo (Liz X from Series Five episode The Beast Below) as barmaid Alison Cheney, who is introduced as the Doctor's new companion and comes across almost as something of a template for the companions of the New Series. Hidden away in a cameo working at a warehouse is a pre-Tenth Doctor David Tennent who  has only a couple of lines and a scream. The cast also includes noted character actress Diana Quick as the Shalka Prime, Craig Kelly as Alison's boyfriend Joe and Jim Norton as Major Kennet

What perhaps makes this webcast most intriguing in retrospect is the script by Paul Cornell. What this story feels most like is an attempt to take the classic series alien invasion formula and update it for the twenty-first century. From its six episode length to its opening scenes setting up the deserted streets of the Lancashire village of Lannet (which bring to mind the opening scenes of Invasion Of The Dinosaurs) to the story's somewhat eco-friendly message, there's some strong calls back to the Pertwee era. Even though UNIT doesn't appear, the military presence in the story certainly brings them to mind. The story makes that connection even stronger by its opening and closing titles which harken very much back to the Pertwee era title sequence.

Yet it also brings to mind the New Series that was to come. There's those aforementioned elements in Grant's Doctor and some interesting casting, there's other New Series elements that come into play as well. The story's opening scene for example set in New Zealand which feels like a pre-credit scene out of a New Series episode. There's the future companion in an unhappy relationship with her boyfriend whom she ends up leaving to travel with the Doctor for example. There's the Doctor using a cell phone and at one point using his sonic screwdriver in a fashion that wouldn't be at all out of place in the New Series. The DVD reveals that, like the New Series, seeds were being planted for larger story arcs that would eventually go into this Doctor's background and explain not just his state but also how the Master ended up as an android. In a way then, Cornell's script feels like something of a bridge between old and new that came at an unfortunate time and place before it could lead to more.

Something that made this controversial in 2003, and that also gives it distinction as well, is that it was the first licensed animated Doctor Who story. Despite having been originally produced with Flash animation for an era with much slower internet connects ,  it holds up rather well. There's some wonderful character designs including Grant's Doctor and the Shalka themselves (from the average worm like ones to their leader, the more humanoid Shalka Prime) that, while not hugely detailed, still allows for the characters to be emotional as well which helps the animation feel less artificial. There's some wonderful design elements as well including an impressive TARDIS interior and the underground lair of the Shalka as well as also boasting an atmospheric visual style full of shadows and silhouettes. Indeed the animation even looks good on your typical wide-screen TV thanks to its DVD release.

In the final analysis then, what are we to make of Scream Of The Shalka more than a decade later? It certainly deserves more than the obscurity it's languished in ever since. There's a Doctor that shares many things in common with the Doctor's we've been watching for the last few years as well as elements familiar from the New Series being done in a different way. With its appearance finally on DVD, perhaps the story will be seen as more than an obscure curiosity at last and as something far more than just another thing from the wilderness years.",1410307200,7,5764,4.820020222446916
