8056307,3,B0008IUBM6,"Michelle on her own website says it's a combo of funk, jazz & hip hop. I think I found a date of 1993. It's set on a dark set with 4 backup dancers, usually mostly female, but switches for each part. The outfits are baggy like early 90s style. The camera work moves around a lot to make it look more stylish, but between the low lights & that, it makes you dizzy a little from trying to follow & SEE the dancer's feet. The camera work would be great for dance video, but it's horrible for dance instruction.
Intro: 2 min
Rhythm Training: 5 min
Michelle alone showing some basic step touches to get you to feel the music.
Warm-up: 5 min
Michelle alone adding some hips & shoulders & couple stretches
Aerobics: 30 min
Split into Chunk A, B & C. A & B teaches you about 4 different dance moves each into a routine. C is the compilation of A & B in a straight, no slow down dance routine. In A & B she does break down the moves into lower body part first, then upper, then both, but only shows it 1/2 speed 2-3x only. She also has a smaller window of showing her alone with the back view of the legs only & also it's less stylish, more beginner level. With that, I still had trouble doing it, though I've done MANY dance dvds already. Probably due to the lack of focusing on leg/feet of the camera work. Her cuing is minimal & doesn't help that much. The moves are overall basic early 90s style with a few jazz leg lifts thrown in, a decent amount of hopping/jumping as well. (Those with bad knees should be careful.)
Cool Down/Stretch: 6 min
Done well just like the warm-up, great shoulder circles & plies just like her Jamaica Me S'wet which feels great.

Michelle as always has fun & she does get you to want to be able to do it. She is great as always at getting you to feel the music in the beginning, though just trying to follow was hard enough in the cardio section.

This is best for beginners who don't have 2 left feet who don't need 1/2 speed practice or are big fans of Michelle's. Otherwise I'd recommend her other, easier to follow, more fun, better dance moves & better produced dvds, Jamaica Me S'wet & Dance workout for Dummies.",1205366400,,2142,4.221951219512195
