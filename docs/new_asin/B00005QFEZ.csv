1648416,5,B00005QFEZ,"I have had this workout on VHS tape since it came out (about 5 years ago).  It is wonderful!  Kathy Smith has a way of explaining exercises in a clear manner but yet not making you feel like an idiot.  The Yoga on this tape is a great total body workout.  While you are doing it you don't even think you are working that hard and then before you know it you are sweating.  By the next day your body feels like you've worked hard.
I loved it so much I just bought the workout on DVD.  The DVD is great because the workout is seperated into different sections so that if you just want to quickly do floor exercises or deep breathing you can go right to that particular part.
I would highly recommed this tape to those people who like Yoga or simply want to try new things.  I started out with the Kathy Smith beginner Yoga tape and moved up to this when I felt confident.
I hope Kathy Smith comes out with some more advanced Yoga tapes soon.",1010707200,26,939,4.126373626373627

7950509,4,B00005QFEZ,"I accidentally bought this Advanced video when I meant to get something more along the lines of Intermediate or Beginner. What sold me on it was Rod Stryker's cameo. My yoga teacher had said he's the only teacher she trusts, so I wanted to stay true to that.
The video is a little over one hour and you can obviously fast forward it or slow it down to your preference. I think it was a good buy and I've been using it 2-3 times per week. You really do feel amazing after a good yoga workout like this. Even though I'm taking it slow (I'm still skipping some of the harder poses) I feel it has made an impact on my body and the way I feel about exercise.
The only reason I gave it four out of five stars is the lack of explanation on some of the poses. I felt Stryker could have gone a little more into detail into the meanings behind the poses, as well as what they are supposed to do for the body.",1294185600,2,898,4.022346368715084
7950510,4,B00005QFEZ,"I have been doing this as the tape,off and on for many years.  I used to be thoroughly worked/wiped out (even with taking ballet several times a week and running 3-4 miles a day).  Now, 12 years later, it doesn't seem as difficult.  It has the most important elements of yoga.  Really do agree that, especially when returning to the practice after a break, to take heed of modifications.  It would be ideal to do this tape in front of a mirror so that there isn't unusual posturing.  This yoga is not the most intense but will wake up most cells in your body and bring the state of clarity and awareness that yoga has been known for.

K.S. is a little competitive/negative and he mostly ignores/defuses it.  You can ignore it too.",1284249600,,730,4.43609022556391
7950511,3,B00005QFEZ,"This is set on a stage with a beautiful ocean background. It's Kathy in the front & Rod always behind her & sometimes even barely on camera. Sheela mentioned they were in competition of each other which can ruin the mood. I felt it as well, but I know it's Kathy since in any other dance, kick boxing, etc. workout though she's not an expert, she always had to be front & center, hogging the camera & ignoring the expert. I was pleasantly surprised with this since she only has a lengthy intro of 5 min of telling all about yoga, after that she barely speaks; though early on she tries to hog the mic but Rod calmly hints to her to get back to work.
Rod has vast knowledge & I learned a few terms from him. His cueing is perfect, he tells you when to breathe, always check posture, use of props, how to get the most of the pose, the modifications, and when he reminded to relax the shoulders, I immediately was able to though hadn't realized they were tensed.
The workout is I'd say beginner who already has taken classes or owns shorter, easier yoga videos already & already has strength & endurance in general. I've seen intermediate, this is closer then most, but not there. It starts with Ujayi breathing which means Victory. Then downward dogs & fwds bends, then the the usual sun salutations A &B w/chair pose.
The standing poses still has sun salutations between: triangle, side angle, revolved triangle, wide legged fwd bend, warrior 1 & 2, three legged downward dog.
The sitting routine has: sitting fwd bend, pigeon, butterfly, bridge, tabletop, shoulder stand, plow, flying locust, bow, supine spinal twists, sitting spinal twists & some ab crunches.
I'm not telling the poses in the right order & I might have left out 1 or more poses. This is one of the only videos I've seen that do so many poses done. The pace is as long as it takes to teach each step, about 1-3 full breaths depending on the ease of the asana.
I took off 2 stars because Kathy or ""Kat"" as Rod called her, made it hard for me to finish the routine because of all her negativity & felt a bit more tired/negative myself after. I've had trouble completing any of her DVDs from negativity: Latin dance workout, kick boxing & Flex appeal. (I made sure after her first 2, I've only rented any thereafter.) She is unable to handle taking a backseat for even a minute to someone more experienced/knowledgeble then her but Rod makes up for that mostly. Most other yoga workouts I felt at least stretched out, slightly beter mood or like Rainbeau Mars, Wai Lana, Ateeka, Teigh Mcdonough, Yogi Hari & Kristen  Stroheker, very uplifted, fluid, balanced & calm.
Great yoga workout for those who aren't influenced by bad vibes from Kathy competing with Rod.",1177891200,6,2726,4.540650406504065
7950512,5,B00005QFEZ,"Just a great workout. John leads it, but it is still very effective and balanced, you work hard, but you don't really know it until you stop. Usually I start with the standing poses, skipping the breathing excercises ( that takes too much time :-) )I had this in Vhs and then bought it again in DVD. Thats how much I love it!",1177027200,,325,4.174603174603175
7950513,5,B00005QFEZ,"Kathy Smith on the cover of this tape is a little misleading.  She shares the stage with Rod Stryker who is the yoga guru behind the sequences and workout.  He is very skilled, has a lovely calm manner, and leads you through a balanced and definitely challenging sequence of poses.  I've been using this tape for five years.  Be forewarned, in the early days, I was always sore afterwards--make use of the less difficult posture suggestions until you are VERY comfortable with the tape and your ability.  Still one of my favorites.",1095120000,2,531,4.728260869565218
7950514,5,B00005QFEZ,"By way of giving some background, I've been practicing daily Yoga for 7 years,have over 70 yoga videos, and study with a fabulous teacher as well.
 I must admit that I was skeptical about a Yoga video w/ fitness star Kathy Smith. I was concerned that this was strictly a ""Let's get on the Yoga Bandwagon"" project. However, knowing that Rod Stryker was her partner in this made me give it a try because Rod is the ""Real Deal"".
 This video is actually led by Rod Stryker w/ Kathy Smith assisting him (which is a very smart move on Kathy Smith's part and gives it much more credibility ""Yoga wise"" in my opinion).
 It's a very complete yoga routine, with Gentle Warmups, Sun Saluations (w/ pushups between up/down dog), a complete standing pose practice, Short balancing segment, a very complete backbending routine plus forward bends, inversions and relaxation. There is a clear explanation of Ujayi Breathing at the beginning as well.
 I found this tape to be enjoyable to practice with, easy to follow and challenging as well.
 I actually took it out of the library to try it out and was so impressed that I just ordered her Ultimate Yoga DVD set which has her three Yoga Programs, I've tried all three and had to have them.
 By the way, I thought Rod actually came across better in this video than he does in his ""Yoga For Longevity"" video where he seems a bit stiff and mechanical (even though that is a WONDERFUL video which I highly recommend).
 Also, if you want to try another really great and challenging video, check out Sherri Baptiste's ""Baptiste Power Of Yoga"" video (which is an intermediate level video)as well as her brother Baron Baptiste's excellent collection of videos (in particular his ""live"" set). Of course Bryan Kest has some of the best videos out there as well if you're looking for a real challenge with another excellent teacher.
Namaste",1068854400,10,1864,4.681957186544342
7950515,5,B00005QFEZ,One should have already reached certain levels of flexibility in order to be able to enjoy and appreciate the flow of poses. The athletic routine moves quickly but directions are given well in advance so one knows what's coming next. One might not be able to do some of the poses towards the end but that depends on ones flexibility and strength. It's the only yoga tape that will make you shed few drops of sweat. One really stretches well and feels warmed up and full of energy. Kathy Smith gives excellent guidence. It's trully worthed to have this workout!,1034294400,6,560,4.61
7950516,5,B00005QFEZ,"I'm kinda doing Yoga on my own, so I started with Yoga for Dummies.  That's a good disk, but you have to wade though the instruction on every viewing.  Kathy's THE NEW YOGA CHALLENGE is a wonderful disk and daily experience, but put the emphasis on Challenge.  It's tough for me the nubie, but I love it.  Best thing, it's got a routine you can do in front of the TV ... all of it or part of it.  A bargain!!!!!!!",1027555200,6,413,4.049382716049383
