7914211,4,B00000K3V2,"This television special does justice to the Sinatra of 1969. Worth the price of admission alone is the ""apartment"" sequence. I dare anyone to watch that and not be emotionally moved by his performance. The songs ""A Man Alone"" and ""Forget to Remember"" are haunting, melancholy and capture the essence of Sinatra's idea of a salon song. A Man Alone is Sinatra's most underrated song from his entire recorded output, in my opinion.

Other parts of the special were not as spectacular. Frank's movie bit was self deprecating and silly but it somehow seemed to distract me from his musicianship rather than enhance it. A few of the songs like ""Goin' Out of My Head"", which Sinatra cannot top Little Anthony on, should have been eliminated. And the audience laughter at Sinatra's jokes seemed forced to me. I couldn't tell if it was a laugh track or a live audience, unlike his '73 ""Ol' Blue Eyes is Back"" Special which was in front of an audience.

I'd recommend this to Sinatra fans who like his late 1960's reprise albums such as My Way, A Man Alone (A Tribute to the Poet/Songwriter, Rod Mckuen) and Cycles as he performs songs from them plus the old standards.",1451520000,,1159,4.648780487804878

7914213,1,B00000K3V2,"I see that a deluxe five DVD set of Barbra Streisand's TV specials has been released recently... So why doesn't Warner/Reprise do the same thing for Frank Sinatra's classic TV specials? Could ""The Family"" be involved perhaps...? Sure, they can get behind a phony ""Sinatra at the Palladium"" multi-media extravaganza where you watch 20-foot projected videos of Sinatra singing accompanied by a live orchestra thanks to ""unprecedented access to Frank Sinatra's film archives""... but they can't seem to get Sinatra's video performance legacy released appropriately on DVD...

The classic 1960s, 70s, and 80s musical TV specials (A Man and His Music Part I & II, Sinatra+Ella+Jobim, The Main Event, etc...) are still being sold as individual DVDs at full price ($15-$20 each). They are each about 50 minutes long with ""stereo"" sound (actually ""2-channel mono"" I think) with no bonus features whatsoever, packaged in flimsy plastic and cardboard cases.

Why don't they compile all 9 of the Reprise Collection Sinatra TV specials in a 3-DVD package with 3 specials per DVD? Price it at about $40-$50, include some bonus goodies (there must be hours of stuff in the vaults... better go with 4 DVDs!) and give this material the deluxe, classy treatment it deserves.

Surely this would sell well enough to justify the minimal investment required (just repackaging/remastering the same old material for the most part). Wouldn't a DVD set like this be a better 90th birthday ""limited edition"" release than reissuing the sub-standard Duets CDs again? And what about all the amazing unreleased audio that remains stagnating in the vaults...? Get with the program, folks!

I am truly very happy for all you Babs fans though! You're ""the luckiest people in the world...""",1133827200,2,1754,5.165492957746479
7914214,5,B00000K3V2,"After a so-so attempt to connecet with the younger crowd on the previous year's ""Francis Albert Does His Thing"", Frank Sinatra returned to the small screen in 1969 with his fifth tv special, simply titled ""Sinatra"". The result was a more cohesive and enjoyable performance, if not quite up to par with the first two ""A Man And His Music"" specials and the one with Ella and Jobim.

The show starts off in fine form, with Frank firing off powerful, energetic renditions of ""For Once In My Life"" and ""Please Be Kind"" (the latter of which never was done better in any format), followed by moving, elegant ""My Way"". In between songs, Frank cracks some amusing one-liners and pays tribute to the songwriters of the world.

After this excellent comes a brief clipshow of Frank's movie career, which is filled with hilarious clips and Frank's shamelessly self-depricating humor. He does a few snatches of songs from his movies, including ""I Couldn't Sleep A Wink Last Night"", ""You're Sensational"" and ""All The Way"". This half closes with a rousing performances of ""The Tender Trap"".

After this comes a selection of new numbers. ""Little Green Apples"" is corny and worth skipping after one listen, but the obligatory ""sad song"" sequence is a sight to behold. After the brief Rod McKuen poem ""Out Beyond The Window"", he sinks into soulful, appropriately melancholy renditions of McKuen's ""A Man Alone"", Jimmy Webb's ""One For My Baby"" - esque ""Didn't We"" and the haunting ""Forget To Remember"".

Frank then reunites with his audience for the final half of the show, starting off with ""Fly Me To The Moon"", which he dedicates to the recent heroes of the moon landing. ""Street Of Dreams"" is up next, followed by two final new numbers, Rod McKuen's bittersweet ""Love's Been Good To Me"" and Teddy Randazzo's ""Out Of My Head"". In a departure from the norm, ""Put Your Dreams Away"" is not done as the closing number, as Frank instead opts for a revised Don Costa arrangement of ""My Kind Of Town"" that Frank goes all out on.

Frank looks and sounds great on this special. Looking slim, sporting a tan and sounding exceptionally good (1969 was the last year in which Frank ascended to the vocal heights of his peak years until 1979). I noticed a lot of reviewers saying Frank seems bored and distant during the performance, but I couldn't disagree more. Frank is having a ball here, and I find it very surprising that Frank had laryngitis during the taping, because he sounds absolutely wonderful.

""Sinatra"" is up there with Frank's best specials, and is entirely worth the price of admission. Pick it up.",1131235200,4,2585,4.771812080536913
