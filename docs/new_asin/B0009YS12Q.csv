Since make it or break it had to condense the videos to display videos from all three rappers, some videos are complete. For the first hour or so, videos appear to be 2/3s in length, as is the video by Mystikal featuring Outkast (Nek uv d woods). Although the last hour, one can appreciate DMX videos which are in full length and are in slightly poorer quality than the Make it or Break It's Best of DMX DVD, do NOT contain make or break it logo as the other DVD.  But it's a collectible for DmX fans.",1484006400,,642,4.35

There was some pretty decent photoshop work done on the cover so I thought ""Hey, maybe the footage will still be good.""  Not so.  First, there was no menu screen so you can't skip to the videos you want to see- it just starts playing when you put it in.  The videos seem to be in some random order with these really tacky transitions cutting off the ends of each video to cover the fact that they were captured from MTV2.  The quality of the footage is pretty good except that occasionally you get a line moving up the screen like on a problematic television.  If you try to skip to the next chapter you'll find that the markers are in the wrong spot and you'll have to rewind to get to the top of the video.  Then, when you get towards the end of the dvd, the length of each video gets shorter so you get maybe half of each one.

Totally not worth it- don't waste your money!",1148169600,9,1047,4.169154228855722
