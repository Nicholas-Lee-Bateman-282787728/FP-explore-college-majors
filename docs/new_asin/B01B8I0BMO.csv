8749643,4,B01B8I0BMO,"Murder at the Baskervilles, 1937 film

This is adapted from the story ""Silver Blaze"". The film begins at a warehouse. Professor Moriarity and Moran inspect this site; it is like a fortress. ""It does sound simple"" when Holmes explains his reasoning. Holmes and Dr. Watson will take a vacation at the Baskerville estate. Inspector Lestrade visits and tells of his new job. He says ""Silver Blaze"" will win the race. Mr. Standard visits Moriarity, he has bet against ""Silver Blaze"" and needs to win to avoid bankruptcy. It will cost 10,000 to fix the race. The owner of ""Silver Blaze"" guards him carefully. Holmes demonstrates his powers of observation at the Baskervilles (blue chalk). [Note the simple door latch in the kitchen.] Mr. Trevor visits Straker the trainer. The next morning they find ""Silver Blaze"" missing! Colonel Ross visits Holmes for help, Lestrade is with him.

A dog barks as they approach the horse stall. Holmes asks for an old horseshoe - for luck? They find the body of Straker out on the moor. Where is the horse? Holmes follows the tracks. He talks to Silas Brown, the owner of a competitive horse in the race. Brown will do as Holmes says. Holmes has his own plans in this case. Who bought Straker's promissory notes? ""But I've trained myself to notice what I see."" The dog always sleeps outside during the night. Holmes questions Mrs. Straker. Some of the sheep have gone lame. There was the curious incident of the dog in the night. Why would a bettor risk more after losing? Curry disguises the taste of opium. As Holmes and Watson leave another motor car overtakes them, their car goes off the road!

Cup day sees a big crowd for the race. Dr. Watson bets on ""Silver Blaze"" to win. Holmes explains the facts to Colonel Ross. The chief clue was the surgeon's scalpel. Moran hides a pistol in a kinematograph, one of the jockeys is shot. Holmes plays draughts with Lestrade. Dr. Watson calls with a message, Holmes and Lestrade go to the address. Will they foil Moriarity's murderous plan? Will the gang be caught by the police? Is this the end of Moriarity?

Arthur Wontner best resembles the old illustrations for the Sherlock Holmes stories. The original story ""Silver Blaze"" was modified for this movie. The book is usually better than the film. The story tells how minor details can fill in the big picture and solve the mystery. ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" is the most popular of the four long stories about Sherlock Holmes. ""Silver Blaze"" was one of the many short stories.",1465430400,,2510,4.723744292237443
