1078289,5,6305810109,"At one point in this amazing film, Alvin Straight is asked by some young campers to name the best thing about being old. Straight says that since he's seen everything there is to see, he is more able to separate the wheat  from the chaff and let the smaller stuff fall away. After the incredible  film year of 1999 ended, and the smaller stuff fell away, David Lynch's  masterpiece remained standing head and shoulders above most of the rest,  arguably the finest film of the year.
Richard Farnsworth is Alvin  Straight, a man intent on journeying 300 miles from his home in Iowa to  visit his estranged brother in Wisconsin after the latter has a stroke.  With eyes too bad to drive, and distrusting of being driven by others, he  builds a trailer to pull behind his lawn-mower and sets off on an  incredible journey, indirectly teaching valuable lessons to the folks he  meets along the way.
Lynch's direction and Freddie Francis's  cinematography are breath-taking. They linger on rolling waves of endless  wheat fields, billowing seas of storm clouds and wonder-filled starry  nights ... and most important of all, they explore the incredibly emotive  landscape of Richard Farnsworth's old face, etched with an entire life's  worth of experiences, and punctuated by a beatific smile and tender blue  eyes. Farnsworth's performance is a gem.
Only the most hardened of  hearts will sit through this late odyssey in an old man's life (with echoes  of Bergman's Wild Strawberries) without being touched over and over and  over by the poetry and lyricism that Lynch brings to this jewel. Don't miss  this film.",957398400,,1609,4.910780669144981
1078290,5,6305810109,"""The Straight story"" was one of my favourite movies of 1999. It is a warm and gentle movie that is not overly sentimental. Every scene has just the right tone.
Fans of David Lynch might be astonished when they  hear that their master made a G-rated movie, but to my mind, it is one of  Lynch's best films. I think that sometimes, his films are too freaky for  their own good, but in ""The Straight Story"", he completely serves  his screenplay and trusts his actors. Richard Farnsworth is really  masterful as Alvin Straight. His performance is so effective that he almost  moved me to tears. He shows us a man that hasn't lost his dignity despite  being old and handicaped. But let's not forget the supporting cast with the  outstanding Sissy Spacek. Other great contributions are made by  cinematographer Freddie Francis and also by the score composer.
I once  wrote that Terrence Malick's ""The Thin Red Line"" is not always  poetic because it strives too hard to be just that. Cinematic poetry cannot  be forced, it must develope out of the moment. ""The Straight  Story"" is one of the most poetic films of the decade.",957312000,23,1117,4.666666666666667
1078291,5,6305810109,"A wonderful movie. I just wish that Disney had released thismovie to more Theatres and that it had a better distribution. One ofthe best movies I have ever seen. It should have received an AcadamyAward. It just shows you the kind of people that vote in the Acadamy when this movie was not recognized and a movie likes The dysfuctional ""American Beauty"" walks off with the top award.  END",957225600,2,387,4.608695652173913
1078292,5,6305810109,"Admittedly, the fact that I look with favor on any film that doesn't portray Iowans as hicks may slightly taint my review. But what David Lynch has created with this film is something truly moving and timeless, the  likes of which hasn't been seen in a LONG time, even during last year which  was a phenomenal year for great movies. If someone had told me that the  best films of 1999 would be about a puppeteer who travels inside the mind  of John Malkovich and an elderly man who rides 300 miles on a lawnmower, I  would have been cautious of anything arriving in theaters. Against the  odds, however, both films proved to be masterpieces, even if they didn't  walk away with any Academy Awards (like we need to give any credence to  that particular institution).  This brings me to what I felt was one of the  biggest travesties in Oscar history.  Academy voters could have done all  the right things by awarding Richard Farnsworth (calling attention to an  overlooked film, awarding the oldest actor ever to be nominated for Best  Actor, capping the career of a great character actor who's been working in  the business for over half a century, and, most importantly, by giving the  award to the most deserving performance), but instead they gave it to Kevin  Spacey (who was excellent, but then again, he's always excellent) as part  of ""American Beauty""'s Oscar sweep. Oh, well, those who see  ""The Straight Story"" know that Farnsworth's appearance truly  ranks among the greatest of all time. There is a scene in a bar where  Farnsworth (an actual WWII veteran)recounts a war story with another  veteran. The sadness behind his eyes conveys all the visual horror of the  D-Day sequence in ""Saving Private Ryan"", and it's the closest  I've ever come to actually crying in a movie (not counting when I was  little and Yoda died in ""Return of the Jedi""). To costar with  Farnsworth in the first act of the movie, Lynch got Sissy Spacek, and her  moving turn as Alvin Straight's daughter was surely deserving of an Oscar  nomination (as was the score, cinematography, director, and the picture as  a whole), and she avoids all the cliches of playing a ""slow""  individual. Her scenes with Farnsworth are absolutely priceless.  Is it  possible, therefore, for the movie to sustain itself once Farnsworth sets  out alone on the road?  Yes it is, thanks to beautiful aerial photography,  a score that alternates between vibrancy, tragedy, and sadness, and a  capable supporting cast. There is not a villain in the film, the closest of  which are two brothers who try to cheat Alvin on repairs to his lawn mower.  Alvin, however, sets them straight (no pun intended), and leaves them  better off, as he does to all the people he encounters. You may wonder why  I rave so much about a film that sounds so simple.  Well, you can describe  as much as you want with words, but it's not until you see all those  elements work together onscreen that you can fully appreciate just how  magical a work of film ""The Straight Story"" is.",957052800,,3024,4.69980879541109
1078293,5,6305810109,"Richard Farnsworth delivers a performance that must rank as one of his best in a long career.  The pace of this movie is wonderful.  It is slow, like the countryside it depicts, but not as to be dull.  Farnsworth is  absolutely perfect in his role as 73 year old Alvin Straight.  Sissy Spasek  is wonderful as his daughter, who is sweet and caring (but a little slow  mentally).  The fact that director David Lynch made this film may be  surprising, but he handles it wonderfully.  There is only one possible weak  point in the film, and it involves a hysterical motorist who hits an animal  on the highway.  This quick scene seems somewhat out of place, but not in a  terribly distractng sense. The fact that this is a true story makes it all  the more fascinating.  Definitely worth seeing, The Straight Story  showcases Richard Farnsworth in a performance that easily rivaled that of  Kevin Spacey in this year's Academy Awards race.",955152000,,936,4.672839506172839
1078294,5,6305810109,"the theatrical and artistic aspects of this grand movie enhance a very deep story line. the slow seeming pace of action, the intimacy of conversation,the straight across acceptance of the characters for each  other,all give us a look at that elusive goal we all seek of peace in our  lives. this is not being still or inactive, but having peace with our  history,, life and yet being still on the journey with whatever is at hand.  this portrayal reminds us that life is indeed a school and if we learn the  lessons we can achieve a sense of self that is beautiful, is powerful in  its effect on others and will result in transformation in many ways  wherever we go. thanks david lynch.",954374400,,686,4.528455284552845
1078295,5,6305810109,"I have never seen a film that captured it's audience so fully and completely.  When movies end and the credits begin, what happens?  People get up and leave.  Sure a few people will stay behind and read the  credits.... But when I had the honor of seeing The Straight Story, noone  stirred.  Noone moved.  It was as if we all waited, hoping to get one last  glimpse of this beautifully simple and honest man.  It was as if we stayed  to hear the beautiful score for one more second, the story would be retold  and our lives would be sweet again.  This film is simply glorious.",952905600,3,576,4.330188679245283
1078296,5,6305810109,"Who would have expected David Lynch, the director of films from the bizarre underbelly of America (Eraserhead, Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks) to come up with such a beautifully simple movie about the need for redemption in  life, and do it without corniness or coarseness? Yet, Lynch has created one  of the most touching movies I've seen in a long time - while avoiding the  saccharine effects of Hollywood fare. ""The Straight Story"" is literally a straight story, about an old man named Alvin Straight. As a ""road movie"" it runs a straight line from start to finish, but  along the way Lynch throws in some of his best scenes, pacing and dialogue, which keep the movie from being too maudlin or flat. Alvin Straight, a retired Iowa farmer in the receding twilight of his life, sets out to see  his ailing brother, whom he's not seen or spoken to in years, in Wisconsin. He can't drive and won't take the bus, so he hitches up a makeshift trailer to his battered tractor and makes the journey, at 15 mph, across the  heartland to see his brother. Cue the heart-swelling scenes of Iowa cornfields and the uplifting music by Lynch pal Angelo Badalamenti. But none of it plays predictably. Straight encounters some unique people on the  road - some who might seek his help and wisdom, some who could help him -  and it's in this context that Lynch works his quirky magic. The old cliche  about life being a journey gets an elegant and charming makeover. Alvin reveals, through conversations with strangers, that he's led a  tumultuous and cantankerous life; but even now, his stubbornness both drives him and keeps him on the straight path to his brother's doorstep. We know  that 10 years of bad blood have separated the two men; will Straight's  brother finally accept him once he arrives? Will Straight own up to his  past mistakes? Will the film end on a falsely-derived feel-good ending? Lynch avoids the traps skilfully and gives us some very interesting  characters along the way. Richard Farnsworth plays Straight beautifully: a mixture of quiet stubborness mastered by resignation. His weathered face  says a lot. Sissy Spacek gives a deft performance as Straight's mildly  retarded daughter. She has a life full of her own regrets and mistakes: she tries to be strong and helpful for her aging father, yet we learn she has children of her own somewhere, taken away by the state long ago. There are other characters who play small but interesting roles: a young runaway  girl who shares a roadside camp with Straight; a barman who offers Straight  a beer and a painful memory; a family straight out of a Norman Rockwell tableau, and, in a classic Lynchian scene, an unhinged woman motorist who hits a deer and flips out in front of the bemused Straight. The dialogue is right on target, being neither contrived nor melodramatic. In one scene, shot from a middle distance, we see Alvin talking to someone, but we can't quite hear them. Rather than mike it so that every line is  audible, Lynch chose instead to keep the viewer outside. That and the somewhat off-kilter camera angles makes the look and tone of ""The  Straight Story"" so refreshing: not everything has to be explained or  conventional. Lynch isn't putting heroic words in Alvin's mouth, nor is he  saying that being old and decrepit is somehow noble. There are no weird,  malevolent or supernatural beings here. Lynch has (for once - maybe not for  the last time) given us a look at real life, the way it meanders along with no seeming purpose, but whose little events add up to something greater.",952732800,8,3561,4.7435064935064934

1078595,5,6305810109,"This is one of those sorts of movies which will never get the acclaim it deserves due to the subject matter. Yes, it moves very slowly to an expected climax, but as with many things in life it's about the journey not just the destination. Shakespeare said that everyone's an actor and all the world's a stage. In this movie Richard Farnsworth becomes Alvin Straight. Farnsworth leaves us this swansong as his highest achievement as an actor.

It almost defies imagination to consider this was based upon a true story, being portrayed along the same 200+ mile route Alvin Straight took... on a lawnmower. It's story is about more than human determination and compassion. It's about virtue, principles and the simple decency of right and wrong.",1507248000,,742,4.888888888888889

Trouble is, the man has failing legs and eyesight and cannot drive a car there, so he buys a used riding mower and attaches a trailer to it, which he uses to drive hundreds of miles along the highways from Iowa to Wisconsin.

The actors all perform realistically and credibly, and the depiction of rural America does not fall into crass stereotyping.

This is a tender, wry exploration of the lives of characters who, at first, will strike you as very ordinary, but, at the same time, humorously odd.  Before it is over, you will find that you have been drawn into a profound caring for these people.  It all adds up to a sweet, wise, funny, sad, and soul-touching experience.

1078905,5,6305810109,"I was searching around at a used CD store and came across a score composed by Angelo Badalamenti for a film that I had never heard of entitled ""The Straight Story"".  While the I found the score to be very enjoyable, I was even more curious about the film itself and decided to do a little research to find out more.  I discovered that this Disney film was actually based on the true story of Alvin Straight's 240 journey to visit his ailing brother.  What makes this journey so extraordinary is the fact that Mr. Straight travelled the 240 miles on a 1966 John Deere lawn mower.  Rolling along at around 5 mph, the journey took the 73 year old somewhere in the neighborhood of 5 weeks to complete.  After watching some videos and even a ""Mysteries at the Museum"" episode concerning the event, I decided to order a copy of the film.

The film stars Richard Farnsworth as Alvin Straight and Sissy Spacek as his daughter Rose.  The two performers are simply outstanding in these roles and the film, which was directed by David Lynch, is full of unforgettable moments, great lines, and wonderful sentimental scenes that can really tug at your heartstrings.  The scenery and the people that Alvin meets along the way will have you hoping that a world like that still exists.  Kindness, love of family, and the wisdom of old age are some of the themes presented within the story.  There are so many great scenes in the movie and one that stands out to me, for some reason, is when Alvin is buying the ""grabber"" at the hardware store.  I don't want to spoil the scene if you haven't seen the film, but the acting is just superb and it reminds me of some folks that I grew up around when I was a kid.  I love how Alvin compares family to a bundle of sticks and the very memorable line concerning the worst thing about growing old....""is remembering when you were young"".  Wow.  The film is definitely a hidden treasure and I enjoyed it immensely.  I'm so glad that I stumbled across the score for the film because otherwise I don't think I would of ever heard of the film or the real life story that it is based upon.

I guess a Blu-Ray version of the film has been released but it doesn't look like an American release so I opted for the cheaper DVD version.  The DVD version has a very strange looking cover (looks just like the one pictured currently - photo surrounded by gold border).  There are no special features included with the DVD version other than the original theatrical trailer.  I was hoping they would include a short documentary about the real story...but it didn't.  The film looks fine to me for a DVD and while many of us are getting spoiled with Blu-Ray and 4k picture...the ""primitive"" DVD format did not hinder my enjoyment of the film at all.  Surprisingly, my 6 year old came in when I started watching the movie and ended up watching the whole thing.  I thought it would be too slow but he stayed because he wanted to see if the ""old man would make it to his brother"".  Anyway, it's a great film and maybe some others will discover it too like I did.  It'll sure speak volumes to you if you listen and we sure could use a little bit of this in today's world for sure.",1473292800,15,3187,4.390119250425895

1079037,5,6305810109,"The Straight Story (1999) is a Disney film starring Richard Farnsworth and Sissy Spacek. The plot is simple: a debilitated elderly man with not much money makes a trek (via his John Deere lawnmower) some 250 miles to see his estranged brother who has suffered recent health problems, in the hopes to make amends. Okay, that sounds simple, so what's left? Well, this is no ordinary story; it's a story of resilience, tenacity, and an old man wanting to finish what he started. Alvin Straight (Farnsworth) meets several gracious strangers on his journey, but never accepts their offers to help him get to his destination. Straight is a man of wisdom, and those who come in contact with him learn something to enrich their own lives. This is a heartfelt story with absolutely fantastic music by Lynch staple Angelo Badalamenti. His music is spot-on, and really captures the feel of the plains and the many farms that Straight passes along the way. David Lynch was meant to direct this film, and if anything else, he showcases a versatility that was always there but was never tapped. I give Lynch huge praise for telling a story, well........'straight.' I have the utmost admiration for Richard Farnsworth for taking on his role despite battling his own health issues during the shooting of this film. Overall, The Straight Story is one of the best and most wholesome films ever to hit the silver screen. The special features are good, too.",1461801600,7,1437,4.845528455284553
1079038,5,6305810109,"Let's start by saying that this film is not suited for those who crave action-packed, fast-moving, and probably lightly plotted movies.  But, if you're looking for a film with depth and meaning, wisdom acquired thru real-life experiences, this is the film for you.  I, personally, was deeply moved by every aspect of the film.  I felt that David Lynch developed the story-line with true understanding, and the eye and heart of a true artist.  Alvin Straight's story was real, and though he may have appeared, on the surface, as a simple person, his understanding of life was kind, and profound.
This movie was not for the shallow-minded.  We can all gain from the life-lessons, and love, of Alvin Straight.
Thank you, David Lynch, for bringing us such a gem.",1461110400,4,758,4.844961240310077

Richard Farnsworth was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance.  Like Adrien Brody in ""The Pianist,"" he should have won the Oscar in a groundswell of popular support and sensible Academy voting.  Really, nothing I have written here so far has any real meaning.  I am just stunned by the affect of  Farnsworth's eyes during this intimate chronicle of Alvin Straight's journey of forgiveness.  Perhaps the fact that I am in my 60s and my younger brother, in his 50s, committed suicide with a handgun only four months ago is seminal to my ability to attest to the fact that no on knows a person's whole life story better than a sibling.  ...and that to forgive is divine.",1439164800,4,844,4.655405405405405

Forgiveness, sacrifice, love - truly family is everything, as seen in this poignant true story about a man who risks his life to make amends with his long lost brother. (Ironically a year after making this movie, Richard Farnsworth was to end his own life by suicide) Sissy Spacek is again, brilliant in her portrayal of Rose, the daughter of our elderly main character, Alvin. Wishing to seek forgiveness before he passes away, Alvin forges 240 miles through open roads and treacherous terrain on a 2nd hand John Deere tractor, to find Lyle (his best friend and younger brother) and say he is sorry before its too late. The brothers share a bond closer that any two humans can and have not spoken in 10 years. Alvin cannot drive, and he refuses to take a bus or be driven by another. Along his journey of redemption he crosses paths with many people who carry a significant part of the reason why this wonderful story is so sweet and relate-able. Those people were forever changed by Alvin's appearance, to be sure. We all have a piece of us in Alvin, an adventurer, seeker of truth, brave, fearless. My favorite encounter was with the first stranger, a young pregnant girl, to which he shares a heartwarming parable about family ties that bind. RUN and get this movie and show it to everyone important in your life, those closest to you, people you wish to ask forgiveness from, the people you love most.",1436140800,,1495,4.62406015037594

On the plus side, it is a 'redemptive' type of story, with good messages about perseverance, second chances and forgiveness too. Richard Farnsworth played the lead very well.

Negatively, I thought the movie dragged on and on, particularly towards the end, the pace was VERY slow and I got a bit bored to see the rather obvious ending that finally arrived.

 I also thought that it should have been explained why his daughter was speech-challenged, I kept expecting that to come up. Was she mentally challenged, had a stroke, etc...It was hard to listen to her talk like that throughout the film, without at least knowing why.

Could have been better but OK and I'm not sorry I watched it, overall.",1412640000,,793,4.759124087591241

To me it is a love letter to America, ambivalent and on the edge of meaninglessness.  The landscape is a main character, strangely, and everything that happens, happens on it.  But the landscape is not offended, and the people are not diminished.  I guess this may sound terribly abstract and it is difficult to verbalize but to any who have watched this movie, I think they will understand what I am saying.  That's why this is a great movie.  It occupies that area of communication that only movies can--you can't really write this story, you can't document this story with a series of stills--it is a story only a movie can tell.  I think this movie might actually be Lynch's masterpiece but because of it's ""quiet"", minimalism, and lack of overt perversion it is not well known.

With The Straight Story he got to make a film almost entirely about quirky old people, only these folks are more grounded than his typical portrayal of geriatrics. That's probably because this story is based on a real life adventure of Alvin Straight, who drives a mower about 300 miles to visit his brother. The acting isn't always the greatest, but Richard Farnsworth plays the role of Alvin wonderfully.",1385769600,,464,4.961538461538462

As the story progresses we learn more and more about Alvin Strait and his history, which helps explain many things that we see early in the film.  Alvin did not have a perfect life, but as he realizes his days are numbered he decides to put things right with his estranged brother using his limited resources in unconventional ways.  As Alvin meets people on his journey we see his wit and his wisdom and each encounter provides another life lesson.

For some reason, the director decided that this DVD should not have any chapter marks in it, which is inconvenient.

If you have seen this show on television, be advised that the TV edit leaves out some scenes that provide some key details in the overall story.  Example, in the TV edit that I have seen, Alvin leaves town on a red lawn tractor and then he suddenly changes to a green John Deere tractor.

1079673,5,6305810109,"I had read a very short synopsis of the movie which said it was about a man who used a riding lawnmower to travel 300 miles to visit his brother. This sounded like something that my wife might enjoy so I rented it mostly for her; what I didn't expect was the power house of production and acting that makes this movie an amazing and memorable experience.

A review of this movie requires one pull out many terms not often used of movies today, gentle, tender, sensitive, introspective, great direction, great acting, thoughtful, and non-violent for starters. It reminded me in some respects of ""Enchanted April"" where time is given to quiet moments of beauty and calm; where the camera lingers on a gentle moment filled with the beauty of just that moment.

During the movie I commented to my wife that it didn't feel like I was watching acting, I was watching life being lived before my eyes. I had the impression that this was really happening as I watched; I almost had to remind myself that I was watching actors of extraordinary ability reciting lines, playing a part, that this was not reality.

Also interesting, as I think back on the movie, is it never lost that sense of relaxed reality; the pace of the movie always seemed to move naturally with no rushing through the quiet moments. Facial expressions were allowed to speak to the viewer and tell of the inner emotions at play in the character.

If you rush through life without stopping to smell the flowers you will probably find this movie moves too slowly; if, on the other hand, you like to enjoy the beauty of the flowers, the beauty of a sunset, a quiet moment watching the crackling of a fire in the evening, then this movie may well please and delight you as it pleased and delighted me.

To fully enjoy this movie it is helpful if one has enjoyed some years of living, younger children may not be able to relate to the subtler moments featured in the telling of this beautiful and touching story.",1378252800,,1968,4.548022598870056

That's the main plot, but the subplot is about recognizing that there's a time to but grievances behind you and remember that family is more important than hurt feelings or disagreements and that you can often help people by just saying the right words at the right time and then leaving it alone.  Alvin changes lives all through his trip and regains his independence at the same time.  If you like shoot-em-ups, thrillers, or mile a minute action, you might want to look elsewhere, but if you like a slower pace with a message, give this a try.",1378166400,2,705,4.571428571428571

1079706,4,6305810109,"THE STRAIGHT STORY, the play on words title from the unconventional David Lynch distributed by Walt Disney Pictures, is about a side of America rarely seen in movies but one we see -- if we're lucky -- in our own neighborhoods and towns every day. In a way, it's the quintessential pre-9/11 movie about American humanity.

Lynch, who also created the sound design, teams with Freddie Francis (cinematographer) and Mary Sweeney (co-producer, co-writer and editor) on evoking Alvin Straight's (Richard Farnsworth) Odyssean journey of 300 miles to see his dying brother (Harry Dean Stanton). There's double meaning in the title -- named after the main character but also Lynch playing it straight as director -- which is a welcome to viewers seeing THE STRAIGHT STORY for the first time. There's a pleasure in being as honest and stubborn as the character and both Richard Farnsworth and the film itself are no-nonsense folk. You're almost waiting for this Hollywood gang filming in Wisconsin and Iowa to poke fun at the characters and the story, to turn it into a three-act genre story, especially with Disney looming over the proceedings.

But what you have are just honest to goodness quality performances that are real, including Sissy Spacek as the autistic daughter Rose. The people Alvin encounters along the way seemed to be plucked right from the farmhouses and villages he passes. It's a hero's journey and I'm very glad I finally sat down to watch it fourteen years after its release.

Interesting note from Lynch himself on the inside cover of the DVD that he doesn't believe chapters should be used for films -- it's not a book, he says. Therefore, THE STRAIGHT STORY is one continuous whole. Alvin didn't want to cut corners on his trip, and neither does Lynch.",1372377600,,1772,4.919732441471572

I've always enjoyed his work and that of Sissy Spacek.  That said, I really hated this movie.  I couldn't tell whether Sissy Spacek's character was supposed to be mentally challenged or had a speech problem or both.  Thirty minutes into the movie absolutely nothing had happened.  When Farnsworth's character finally got going on his journey riding his mower the film got even more boring, if that's possible.  He rode and rode and rode and rode...and got nowhere.  Even if he only went 5 miles per hour, 8 hours per day, his 300 mile trip should have taken only about 8 days.  At one point his mower broke down.  I won't even count this as part of the time his trip.  When all was said and done it took him over 5 weeks.  Nothing happened on his drive.  We were given endless shots of the wheels of the mower or the wheels on the trailer he was hauling.  Endless.  Over and over...and over...and over.  What a waste of great acting talent....and time.

1079836,5,6305810109,"From the day this film came out in theaters I have been watching it regularly. I watch it about every year and a half. It is one of Lynch's better films and if it were not for Elephant Man would maybe be his best. Although many Lynch fans may disagree with me on that one. Few films have been able to accomplish what this movie has. It is a study on the notion of forgiveness and importance of family. It's about a lonely pilgrimage which really plays on an important part of Lynch's personal life. Lynch has said on occasion that one of his favorite things to do is just sit in a chair and think (Lynch is also big on meditation). Alvin Straight, ""It's amazing what you see when you are just sitting."" Lynch used to go to a restaurant to sit and look at the silverware, think and write on the napkins because ""Ideas are the best things going."" Alvin is a walking contradiction which is all resolved by the fact that he is riding a lawn mower 500 miles. How is this possible? The answers is in the stars. If you like action movies then this is not going to work for you at all. This is more for the student of film and the person who likes to think. I would not disagree with the person who says that the movie is not entertaining. It's a slow movie. It's about an old man driving a lawnmower for goodness sake! It captures the feeling of the slow country life. There are long distance shots that really make you feel like you are familiar with the landscape. There are only a few times in which the movie makes you feel like you are riding the mower with Alvin, which was a good decision. If you are simply emotionally moved by this film then I think you have probably missed the point and maybe some of the finer details. Yes it is emotionally moving but it is more than that. It is a series of pictures pieced together to tell one tale from many different angles. Lynch took this so seriously he wouldn't allow chapters in the final DVD release. Why did he allow chapters in his other films? Because he needs you to watch it in one sitting to get what is going on. Amazing film. I have endeavored not to ""over think"" this movie. Think too hard when watching Mulholland  Drive and in my opinion you are wasting your time because it's a television pilot with an ending pasted on not unlike the Twin Peaks Pilot made for the Japanese market. The Straight Story can only be observed well or not. If you are thinking too hard then you are missing its meaning. This film is a huge departure from Lynch's artistic philosophy. Commonly he would prefer the viewer create or derive their own meaning like a moving painting (Six Men Getting Sick). But with Straight Story he has crafted a work of genius with clear meaning. Mary Sweeney (co-writer) hoped he would fall in love with the project and that he would direct it which is exactly what happened.

1079874,5,6305810109,"Released in 1999 to high critical praise, this movie didn't do well, coming short of its miniscule $10 million budget.  Still, I remembered it for some reason I got it recently.  Richard Farnsworth gives a remarkable performance in the true story of Alvin Straight and his mission to visit his estranged but seriously ill older brother.  Farnsworth was 79 at the time and had to play the 73 year old Straight.  Straight himself wasn't well.  He had bad hips, needing canes to walk.  His failing eyesight prohibited driving, so he decides to make the 300 mile trip across Iowa on his riding lawn mower.

I know it sounds pretty farfetched and given the fact this was directed by David Lynch, one would assume he would meet up with aliens or something.  But Lynch holds back.  Even when Straight meets an assortment of Midwesterners, they all seem very real.  Along his weeks long sojourn, he must deal with his own devils and memories.  In one scene, Straight and an equally old man trade war stories in a small town bar.  Their memories of WWII are as fresh as yesterday and still weigh on them 50 some years later.  Straight reveals a secret he had never shared, one that he must deal with every day.

I love this movie.  It moves slowly, like the lawnmower.  It moves deliberately like Alvin Straight.  It moved me.  Farnsworth delivers the writers lines brilliantly and while Straight wasn't an educated man, he has many words of wisdom.  In one scene, Alvin is talking with a couple of bicycle racers who are camping for the night.  One asks Alvin, ""What's the worst part of being old?""  Alvin replies, ""Well, the worst part of being old, is rememberin' when you was young."" Amen brother.",1325116800,,1692,4.648648648648648

But even when his work is at its most fascinatingly esoteric, and I am thinking of Inland Empire, still I admire his skill as a movie maker. The Straight Story is a masterful and deceptively simple telling of a man's journey to see his estranged brother when both are approaching their life's end. The fact that he undertakes this journey across several states on a ride on mower makes his trip epic with a small e. His story is also a study of the basic good in so much of human nature and it is told with the full visual force that film can bring. The leisurely pace of the film is perfect for a story of an older person's experience.
The acting is so good and so seamless that one forgets this is being acted. This is a brilliant film and I loved it.",1319241600,2,870,4.153846153846154

1079920,5,6305810109,"My wife and I had seen this movie back when it first came out, and then forgot about it.  Then one day I was looking on Amazon for DVDs to purchase and found ""The Straight Story"" and remembered how I had enjoyed it before.  Through the wonders of Amazon Prime, it showed up on my porch a couple of days later.

The story is a fairly simple one; an elderly man, Alvin Straight, played by Richard Farnsworth, learns that his brother in Wisconsin has fallen ill, and decides to visit him.  But he has a problem - due to his own health problems he no longer has a drivers license.  So he hooks a home built trailer onto his riding mower and sets off to visit his brother.  The movie is the story of his journey.

There are several thing that I like about this movie.  First it is based on a true story, and is set in Iowa.  The entire movie is shot along the actual locations that the real Alvin Straight took.  The photography is beautiful, the locales are beautiful, and it tugs at the heartstrings of this boy of the middle of the USA.

Second, there is no sex or violence.  I realized after watching the movie how conditioned I have come when watching modern movies to expect something violent or sexual to happen at some point.  Some one get killed, someone has an affair - you know what I mean.  In the back of my mind I kept expecting something to happen, but it never does.  Don't get me wrong, this isn't a boring movie.  And Alvin has some close scrapes along the way, but it was so refreshing to not have the movie cheapened by inserting something violent or sexual into it.

Third are the characters.  I have always liked Richard Farnsworth in the movies, and here he does a wonderful job.  Sissy Spacek, who plays his daughter, does a wonderful job as the woman with the speech impediment, taking care of her father while pining for the children she has lost.  The people he meets along the way are great also.  I don't know if they are professional actors, or extras from Iowa, but the do a great job of playing the small town, decent, salt of the earth people Alvin meets on his journey.

Finally, and most importantly, I like the message of the movie.  It is a story about reconciliation.  Reconciliation primarily between Alvin and his brother, who had a falling out a decade earlier over something that no longer matters.  But reconciliation is a continuing theme throughout the movie - Alvin reconciling himself to the reality of his failing health and steadily shortening life time.  Sissy Spacek reconciling herself with her dad's journey that she disapproves of and her loss of her children.  The reconciliation of the runaway pregnant teenager Alvin meets along the way with her family that she imagines hates her for becoming pregnant.  The reconciliation of the bickering twin brothers who repair his lawn tractor when it breaks down along the way.  And the reconciliation of Alvin and a fellow World War Two veteran he meets to the horror they experienced many years ago that still haunts their memories.

This isn't a flashy action movie, no special effect, no frenetic action.  But it is a story that grownups (I won't use the term adults as that has a whole different connotation) will watch and enjoy.  Highly recommended!",1317254400,2,3248,4.556131260794473
1079921,5,6305810109,"Young viewers probably won't sit still for the quiet thoughtfulness and the leisurely pace of this gem of a movie.

It is paced slower than the quiet moments in a Jesse Stone movie.  The understatement of its script makes ""A Trip To Bountiful"" looks frenetic.

But the performance of its star, Richard Farnsworth, is a career-capping tour de force.  The sweet dignity displayed by Mr. Farnsworth is unspeakably beautiful to behold - no less effecting than John Wayne's performance in his last movie, ""The Shootist.

1079922,5,6305810109,"This movie-""The Straight Story"" I purchased online through Amazon is one of the Best I have seen in a long time. I am not much of a movie watcher-but after recently losing a dear Friend and Supervisor where I worked to cancer...I happened by chance to see some of this Movie on TV one night. It was a workday weeknight and it came on later in the evening,so I stayed up as long as I could to see it...but having to be up at 4AM to go to work...I had to not see it all. I found it after it had started as well,so I had no idea of it's name.

The story though...was amazing!...and the actors in it were so ""Real People""and mostly,the Character Alvin Straight. I was stunned!....Not only did he have the same personality and almost the very same voice as my Friend Dennis...he also looked like Denis and his mannerisms and way of thinking...his quiet yet sensible demeanor and way of looking at life and daily troubles were so much like my Friend...it left me feeling hard to believe I wasn't looking and hearing my Friend Dennis.

If I didn't know it wasn't Dennis...I would have thought it was a small clip out of his life on film. My Friend even lived in the Country too.
I found out about 2 years after seeing this movie on TV as I described...and by mentioning it in conversation whilst reminiscing about my Supervisor/Friend with another fellow worker and Friend,he suggested I go to go to Google and type in what the story was about...""Man travels across country on a John Deer Tractor""...in an instant...this movie was found.

I ordered 2 copies and received them in about 1 and 1/2 weeks time. Except for some inside damage to the actual DVD cases...(The small button pop in the middle that holds the DVDs in place were broken on each one-so the DVDs and the broken piece were rattling around inside the packages loose)I played one of them,there was no damage to the DVD that affected the playing of the movie...It was as if I had experienced a visit with my Buddy Dennis. I gave the second copy I purchased to my Friend's Wife and Daughter and Grandson. I am not one to watch a movie twice but this one-because of the personal Connection it made with me is so well done-I will watch it from time to time as a reminder of my Buddy Dennis.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Straight-Story/dp/B00004Z4SD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Straight Story</a>

Beautifully done,this movie is one the entire family can enjoy...it is a real escape from the harshness of today's world and I highly recommend it. The messages you will receive from this video will warm your heart and mabey some of it will even rub off on the way you think of each other as people. Especially when it comes to the importance of patching up differences with estranged Family and Friend's in our Life. There is some dry humor and some valuable life lesson's in it. Everyone who is looking for an escape to simpler times and way of Life and what's really important should watch this.... Joe Hovorka-Ajax,Ont.",1315353600,,3021,4.694339622641509
1079923,5,6305810109,"This was a surprisingly entertaining, tender movie that was an absolute pleasure to watch.

Sometimes it takes a movie like this to slow down and smell the flowers.  Richard Farnsworth does an absolutely fantastic job acting in this movie as Lyle Straight.  The cinematography is also notably excellent, and it is still a shock to realize that this film was directed by the ever-weird David Lynch.

I did a bit of research on the real Alvin Straight, and I have a tendency to think that he was not entirely the humanistic, compassionate soul that was portrayed in the movie.  It takes a reclusive, cantankerous man with too much time on his hands to refuse to get on a Greyhound bus and instead embark on a six week journey on a tractor just to go a few hundred miles.  To the real Alvin Straight's credit, he reportedly refused to appear on David Letterman and other shows trumpeting his odyssey.  This was clearly a man who wanted to be left alone.

Actually, the real star of the movie is this rural corner of the US that is the Iowa/Wisconsin border.  The peaceful scenery and hospitable people, as well as laid-back lifestyle and slower pace of life can really be appealing.  I think that the film captures that aspect very well, and it makes one want to go and visit.  The film itself was reportedly filmed along the actual route that the real Alvin Straight took on his journey.

So even though this film offers us a clearly romanticized view of this event, it does so in a way that is not unrealistic, even if it is idealized.  After all, isn't that the real reason we go to movies in the first place?",1311724800,,1609,4.506896551724138
1079924,5,6305810109,"Althought I live in the U.S., it was only during a recent family visit to Melbourne, Australia that I learned about this film!  I am a big fan of Richard Farnsworth and Sissy Spacek, so I requested a copy of the DVD through my local library when I returned home to Wisconsin.  The based-on-fact film actually is set in rural Iowa and Wisconsin, and the pace of the story matches the slow unfolding of the country roads and two-lane highways that pass through some of the most quietly beautiful landscape that any Midwesterner can imagine (or grew up memorizing.)  ""The Straight Story"" brings us directly into the long end-of-life-journey home as one of two estranged brothers, separated by more than physical miles, stubbornly and steadily drives his old John Deere lawnmower all the way from central Iowa to the lush wilds of Wisconsin to try to make peace with his equally stubborn brother, played by Harry Dean Stanton, who has recently had a serious stroke.

This is a beautiful film that allows us to watch as Alvin Straight pursues forgiveness and reconciliation with his brother, but leaves a wake of healing behind him as he passes through small towns and is rescued and gives rescue in equal measures.

And oh, after I had to return the library copy of this DVD, I promptly went to Amazon and bought it for myself and my family.  It's just that important.  Do yourself a favor and take a trip with Alvin Straight in ""The Straight Story.""",1307491200,3,1446,4.691699604743083

1079939,5,6305810109,"""The Straight Story,"" David Lynch's quietly brilliant epic, is unlike any film I've ever seen. There are moments when you sense the path, and then it veers in new directions of dignity. Everything about this journey of an elderly man seems earnest and authentic - Richard Farnsworth's final performance, the true story on which the film is based, on-location shooting where the events took place, filming in sequence - eventually coming together as a subtle and unlikely continuation of Lynch's unique vision.

That Lynch had this work in him is one of the most hopeful occurrences in film history. One of the greatest modern directors, he has challenged for decades with unconventional trademark productions, from instant cult classics&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eraserhead/dp/B00003CWPL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eraserhead</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blue-Velvet-Special-Edition/dp/B000063JDE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blue Velvet (Special Edition)</a>, the dark period piece&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Elephant-Man/dp/B00003CX9S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Elephant Man</a>, the horrifying&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost-Highway/dp/B001152TL6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost Highway</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wild-at-Heart/dp/B00062IVM6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wild at Heart</a>. I'm sure I left out a film or TV series, but no matter. Lynch's world is often an excursion through the realms of nightmare. His body of work may not hold up against similar masters Martin Scorsese or Steven Spielberg, but this one film is superior to any they've ever made. ""Straight Story,"" yes, is rated G and yes, is a Walt Disney production, but it's the flip side of Lynch's nightmare, a gentle dream, hopeful and amazingly audacious.

Film-making became art the instant someone exposed a trolley car clacking down a busy street circa 1910. It's instant art, oftentimes possessing the depth of a microwavable lunch. Today, filmmakers move fast, forging visions of animated destruction, car crashes, machine guns and men walking away from exploding buildings. These films are populated with young actors, glistening pecks, slick haircuts, shaved heads and tight clothes. They drive waxed cars with loud motors, jump from helicopters and conduct slow-motion scissor kicks against multiple adversaries.

Lynch's ""Straight Story"" is the exact opposite of every convention in film today. It exclusively details the long journey of a wheezing elderly man on the back of a riding lawnmower ambling 5 mph. He moves slower than modern society, gazing at roadside fields, blankets of evening stars, rumbling thunderstorms and cyclists zooming by. He stops to smell the roses, so to say, as he encounters numerous souls, a wayward teenager who actually looks like a teenager, a comfortable middle age family kicked back in lawn chairs, an elderly bartender who serves beer cold, a lawnmower salesman (Everett McGill) who shoots straight, ""It's a good machine."" There are other souls encountered en route to the ultimate soul, an estranged brother embracing his final months of life.

It's based on the true story of Alvin Straight, an old man with failing vision who traveled 200-plus miles on a lawnmower across Wisconsin and Iowa to visit an ailing brother. Richard Farnsworth was a perfect choice for the lead, an elderly actor suffering from cancer on the set (he would die soon after the film's completion). Farnsworth, one of Hollywood's most interesting individuals, had spent a life in the movies, first as an extra in such films as ""Gone with the Wind,"" later a stuntman on John Wayne westerns, evolving into the weathered, no-nonsense acting presence we came to love in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Comes-a-Horseman/dp/B00005LOL4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Comes a Horseman</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Grey-Fox-VHS/dp/6301166671/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Grey Fox [VHS</a>]. Nominated for an Oscar in this role, Farnsworth gives a heartbreaking performance combining physical and spiritual pain, his soul exposed in every scene (and very much akin to Wayne's final performance in the meandering, cameo-heavy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Shootist/dp/B00005JSGL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Shootist</a>).

""The Straight Story"" is ultimately the microcosm of a man's complete life, one who has embraced anger of the past, has kicked alcoholism, who lives with the scars of years. He's had struggles, a mentally challenged daughter (Sissy Spacek), failing health, minimum income, and yet he's able to view life in a gratified manner. They say some people can see the entire world within their backyard. Lynch has documented such a man and very nearly revealed the secret of the universe.

Zion, Wisconsin, along three hundred and sixteen miles of distance, there are delirious landscapes plenty of showy vegetation and fiery thunders, Alvin Straight(Richard Fansworth,73) will undertake a particular last epic journey just to meet with his brother, after ten years of mutual absence.

Along this poetic road movie, this old man will live a very pleasant experience exchanging points of view about multiple livings, like opening a hidden diary showing the deepest of his soul and heart to everyone.

Since the times of ""The elephant man"" David Lynch had not focused with such ceaseless devotion and profound affection about the power of the human feelings.

A film that exudes visual freshness, unforgettable sunsets and mesmerizing landscapes, without forgetting those little and unsaid details of the human behavior.

In the end David served up one of the most sad but poignant endings more so than the straight story. I'm only surprised that he never made more of this style.  He is equally adept at this style as he is to his bizarre plot provoking mind twisted movies.

1080029,5,6305810109,"In 1999, one of the most unusual pairings in Hollywood history formed to make a film telling the story of Alvin Straight's odyssey: David Lynch and Walt Disney Pictures. Lynch, arguably one of film's more daring storytellers, the mind behind Eraserhead, Blue Velvet and Twin Peaks, is absolutely the very last filmmaker I would ever have believed to team with Disney, except perhaps David Cronenberg. His films often navigate the darkest waters of the human experience with an unflinching eye for images both disturbing and nightmarish, and so naturally the idea that he'd done a film for Disney, a G-rated film at that, I could scarcely believe it. And I absolutely had to see for myself what could come of this most unexpected collaboration.

The Straight Story opens with Alvin Straight (played to perfection by the late Richard Farnsworth, an actor and former stuntman whose career dated back to the 1930's), who lives in Iowa and has just learned that his estranged brother Lyle, who lives in Wisconsin, has suffered a stroke. Alvin decides that it's time to put their feud behind them and wants to visit his brother and make peace while there's still time. The problem is that Alvin no longer has a driver's license because of his failing eyesight, and his pride is too strong to allow someone to drive him or take a bus. So Alvin attaches a small trailer to his John Deere riding mower and sets off on an epic journey.

As with most road movies, much of the story is told through Alvin's encounters with people he meets along the course of his travels. Upon meeting a hitchhiking young runaway (who has a big secret she's scared to disclose to her parents), Alvin offers these words, remembering a lesson he would often give to children:

""I'd give each one of 'em a stick, one for each one of 'em, then I'd say, 'You break that.' Course they could real easy. Then I'd say, 'Tie them sticks in a bundle and try to break that.' Course they couldn't. Then I'd say, 'That bundle... that's family.'""

As the story progresses, it is through these seemingly random encounters that we learn more of Alvin's story, and how he came to be the man who is determined to complete this journey. Alvin Straight appears on the surface to be a fairly simple man, but just beneath the surface lies a different person: a man who has made mistakes and while he accepts responsibility for them, he is still haunted by the things he has done and seen over the course of a lifetime. Little by little, we are allowed to see the person inside and in doing so, we learn perhaps a little about ourselves as well. Alvin is a proud man, and yet he is the first to admit that his pride has cost him dearly over the years. He is not a perfect person, and it is clear that he struggles daily with his demons.

It is rare that a filmmaker has the confidence with actors and the trust in the audience to allow moments of quiet; moments in which the story, the emotions, and the story are told only by the actors, and yet this film is largely comprised of soft, quiet scenes that propel the story far better than any soundtrack or flashy camera tricks ever could. As Alvin grows ever closer to his destination, his encounters with strangers become more complex and in the process we learn of the heartbreak and devastation he has endured over the course of his life. In a way, Alvin's journey is one of redemption, and not only in regard to mending fences with his brother. In one incredible scene, Alvin recounts his experiences of a war many years past and I dare anyone who sees it to not shed a tear for the innocence that was brutally torn from him and the impact those nightmares still have upon him.

The film itself is paradoxical; on one hand, it is a simple film with a simple story and a small cast. On the other hand, however, it is an emotionally rich and complex film that, despite the G-rating, never panders to the audience, instead trusting that Alvin's odyssey is largely a voyage of the soul and that the truths to his humanity are so universal that there is simply no need to explain them.

In a time when so-called ""family"" films rely too heavily on weak stories supplanted by excessive effects work and toilet humor, The Straight Story stands high above all others, offering a story of quiet dignity, the power of perseverance, and in the hands of a truly amazing cast, it works flawlessly. And in the end we learn, as is often the case, that it is the journey and not the destination in which the greater truths are often found.",1218240000,4,4523,4.535539215686274

This is the true story of Alvin Straight, who finds out that his brother isn't doing so well. The thing is, Alvin and his brother had a falling out years ago, and they haven't spoken since. So, being an old man who shouldn't exactly be behind the wheel of a car, he drives miles and miles to his brother's home on a riding lawnmower. Along the way, he meets many people from different walks of life.

This is a slow and meditative film, but it is one of the best that I have ever seen, and one of David Lynch's best. The man can do anything! I'd love to see Lynch do more drama.

1080069,4,6305810109,"I was surprised I had somehow missed this Disney gem when it came out. I happened across it looking for rentals and it was an excellent one. I now plan to get a copy. It is one of those movies that isn't exciting but takes you on a journey of discovery. The beautiful late Summer and Fall countryside in Iowa and Wisconsin are a nice backdrop to this sojourn for Alvin Straight to see his ailing brother. How many would attempt to pull a trailer with a riding mower across 260 miles of state highways? Not many that is for sure. Alvin Straight's own failing health has made him realize that his ten year dispute with his brother just doesn't matter any more.

Alvin recalls him and his brother growing up on a farm and caring about each other. Now he must use the only thing he can to get there, a riding mower. Straight meets interesting people on his journey just like Bert Munro did in ""The World's Fastest Indian"". Sissy Spacek is excellent as Straight's handicapped daughter. The movie is an emotional ride at a pace equal to Alvin's mower, and that's a good thing. If you enjoy movies like ""The World's Fastest Indian"", ""Second Hand Lions"", and ""The Station Agent"", you will probably like this one. Disappointedly there are no extras on the DVD.

Lynch is one of our great filmmakers, and to see him branch out with this film (and succeed magnificently) is phenomenal.  In the hands of a lesser director, this film would have been awful.  It would have been overly sentimental with a bombastic music score.  With Lynch, it becomes incredibly moving and tender.  Richard Farnsworth should have won an Oscar for his performance here.  Why he didn't is another one of those Oscar mysteries that will never be solved.  Sissy Spacek, who Lynch has known since his Eraserhead days, gives a great performance as well.  The supporting cast is excellent here, too, and the small town folk are portrayed with dignity and humanity, a far cry from Lynch's Blue Velvet, where they were portrayed as pervertted and ugly.  But then, not all small town people can be deranged, now can they?  Lynch saw all sides of them, like the true artist that he is.  This is a wonderful film.  It came out in 1999, a fantastic year for films, and this was one of the best ones.  Thank you, David.",1188000000,,1197,4.6650717703349285
1080073,5,6305810109,"This is perhaps David Lynch's most courageous movie, for it is one of simple dialog, long sentences and a zen storyline of one man's decision to visit his ailing brother by driving a sit-down lawn mower several hundred miles. It is a slow road trip movie, without any special tricks, only the quest of one man with no overwhelming bits of conflicts or violence.

Silences are not easy in movies, and yet they are expertly carried out here by a wonderful ensemble of cast and crew. Though Amazon mistakenly identifies this primarily as a Sissy Spacek movie, there is no doubt that this movie is the mantle for the late Richard Farnsworth.

Farnsworth, whose face shows the emotions of a man making final journey, masterfully carries the movie in a way that is humble, haunting and sincere. His delivery of lines is quiet and gentle, as is his demeanor. A ""slow road trip,"" the pacing of the movie is compelling in part because of its quietude. Beautifully shot, the great blue skies and the miles of corn have an eloquence that only adds to meaning and depth.

This is a movie that resonates, never shoving but gently prods us to think.
Of special note, Farnsworth was terminally ill during the shoot of this movie. In extreme pain, one can see the determination in his eyes. Sadly, in October 2000, Farnsworth died.

Well, I would simply just like to say that I believe that this movie has a very rare quality. It is very down to earth in a natural and liberating way and is basically just a story about this old man who wants to make up with his brother, which he haven't seen for ten years, before its to late.

He has no drivers license and not much money, so he decides to make the long journey across America, on an old lawn mover - and as one discovers along the way, he has really made up his mind to fulfil his decision - and that even in spite of many of the peoples kind help, which includes an offer to drive him to his destination - because as I see it; that there is almost an symbolic meaning to his way of doing it, which you'll find out at the very end of the film.

Sounds boring??? Anything but... this is simply beautiful and a great and very different effort from director David Lynch. This film is almost magical in its simplicity and complete matter of course. Just check it out for yourself.

1080110,5,6305810109,"The Straight Story is a film about an old man named Alvin Straight who hasn't talked to his brother Lyle in ten years because they said some ""unforgiving things to one another."" He finds out that his estranged brother is dying and he decides to make amends and say good-bye. He drives hundreds of miles with a giant trailer attached to a lawn mower. The story is based on facts.

David Lynch is known for his cutting edge, bizarre and perplexing mysteries but when taken into account with all his other films The Straight Story (and it's unusual G-rating) should be no surprise. Lynch went from the completely off-the-wall horror Eraserhead to in my opinion one of the most touching films ever made in The Elephant Man. He is no stranger to drama and it manifests itself in varying depths in every one of his films.  It often shows up in the most surprising of places. Lynch is acclaimed and credited more after Mulholland Dr., however, in many years from now he will get many of the same accolades that guys like Stanley Kubrick do now for films like this one. Lynch is a master of his craft and among the best American Directors of our time. It sounds like a bold statement now but the years will tell. I for one will argue his films are timeless.

The Straight Story unfolds at a snail's pace and plays the most straight forward formulas to the tee...I'm not saying that as a drawback but it may not be for everyone.  It is the perfect environment for Lynch to show he can direct a great drama with a narrative and some older actors like Richard Farnsworth (excellent as the likeable Alvin Straight) and briefly Harry Dean Stanton as Lyle. Sissy Spaceck is also excellent as Alvin's daughter. If I were to list the most touching sequences in film for me, two come from Lynch films. One scene being when John Merrick is well received by Dr. Treves' wife in the Elephant Man, and the other being a scene from The Straight Story. The scene starts off as a sort of comical and lighthearted part in the movie where twins work on Alvin's broken down lawnmower and they fight while they are doing it. It almost seems like Lynch is being exploitative at first here, but he makes you relate tremendously and feel for these two brothers (especially if you're a twin or have a brother close in age like me). It's so simple but Lynch really has created as likeable a character as you can get in Farnsworth's Straight. Another touching scene is when Alvin is asked by a few bikers what the worst thing is about growing old and he replies ""remembering when I was young"" with a proud smile.  Farnsworth's recent death makes this statement even harder. The comment is layered but comes off as simple like the rest of this amazing film.

Mary Sweeny and John Roach deserve just as much if not more credit for writing this screenplay. I hate giving too much credit to the director but Lynch deserves to be lauded for simply taking on such a pure and uninviting project.  The films his real fans appreciate are for the most part on the other side of the spectrum. It seems risky if it were not for the fact that Lynch is pretty much famous for not giving a damn about risks. However, Lynch is the kind of filmmaker who is capable of creating the most profound kind of drama, but mostly his films are viewed as guilty of shock and not seen far beyond that. When Kubrick began creating his films I'm quite sure many people did the same thing. Lynch is a filmmaking wizard and one of these days the whole world will recognize it.",1178755200,8,3510,4.466458658346334

Lynch's choice for lead actor, the bland Sissy Spacek, the filler of repeat cornfield montages, all the way to the incoherent time spent on the read, I just felt that nobody had control over this picture, yet the randomness (and the possible tear ending) gave critics something to smile about.  This is not a David Lynch film, and for those walking into this with images of Mulholland Drive, Twin Peaks, or even Eraserhead in their mind will be utterly discombobulated.  The Straight Story attempted to show us a slice of Americana via the cornfields of Iowa, but for this boy based in the Flatlands of Illinois, it just seemed repetitive and boring.

What initially pulled me away from this film was the technique that Lynch used to introduce us to Alvin and his daughter Rose.  Alvin lying on the ground because he can't get up, the clich use of taking him to the doctor letting us know that he is deteriorating, while bringing us the central conflict of his brother falling ill was just too much in such a little time frame.  Spacek's depiction of Rose seemed unbalanced and rather stale.  She brought nothing fresh to this rather emotional character outside of a stutter and some unfunny scenes.  I expected so much more from Spacek with her timeline of cinema, but this felt like something she did on an afternoon instead of providing us with the intensity that she harbors.  Then, to add more fuel to the fire, there was Richard Farnsworth.  Again, he isn't a horrible actor, but it felt like Lynch picked him because he fit the role physically, but alas, couldn't master it mentally.  Farnsworth seemed out in left field for a majority of his time onscreen.  I couldn't tell if he was trying to remember his lines or if he was truly in character.  His eyes seemed watery for everything which brought too much emotion to those little scenes, and seemed to bring not enough by the dramatic ending.  His entire speech about his time overseas at war was pathetic, while some will quote it as being his speech of a lifetime, I saw it as babble (and no, I am not that insensitive - I just felt it could have been handled by a stronger, more professional actor).  The rest of the cast seemed equally as unimportant.  I wanted Lynch to either go 100% for this film or none at all, but alas, it felt as if he just half-ed his way through this heap.

Speaking of David Lynch, where did he go in this film?  There were some scenes that I witnessed that screamed the director that I love, but then there were others that just felt like he took pointers from Ken Burns' ""Looking at America"" class.  I hated the sweeping cornfields that seem to plague this film.  Instead of keeping us by Alvin's side throughout his journey, Lynch gave us a repetitive view of farming and corn.  There is nothing wrong with this technique when making the epic that one desperately needs to see once in a while, but when the same images were used over and over again, I nearly felt Lynch was humoring us with the dulls of Iowa instead of being the majestic all the critics raved about.  I think he could have been stronger with his filler than what he was with this film.  He needed something to couple with the authenticity of Alvin, but the stock-footage that he chose to show was definitely not the balance one could hope for.  I also felt there was more to be discussed with the friends that he met along the way.  Alvin was a walking storybook, filled with the way that he led his own life instead of listening to those around him and learning from their experiences as well.  Lynch made Alvin very closed minded, which did not create a strong protagonist for the feature.  Alvin was a strong character, but I needed more with this story.  I wanted him to make choices, learn new things, and bring that to his brother's table when they eventually met.  I felt cheated when this never occurred and felt as if Lynch was saying that this journey through Americana was that we could learn from Alvin, and not vice-versa.

Overall, I wasn't stunned by this picture.  I thought Lynch could have been stronger with his choice of direction and cast instead of what seemed like he just ""played it safe"".  The overplayed stock footage of cornfields infuriated me due to the lack of time that we could have been spending with Alvin.  Speaking of Alvin, why couldn't he have been a stronger, better-rounded character?  I felt after watching this film that Lynch had duped me into believing that he wanted to paint a picture of America, but instead gave us nothing more than soft music, recycled images, and stock characters.  The stories were interesting to listen to, but brought nothing fresh to the table.  I must admit that the brotherly love moment brought a tear to my eye (since I have a brother as well), but why couldn't we focus on this further.  Lynch made the riff between the two brothers seem like a toss in the pan, when it was the central focus of this film.  The Straight Story could have been a strong tale bringing in a new image for Lynch, but instead it felt jagged and old.  I could suggest one viewing for this film, any further, and you will see how dull those cornfields really claim to be!

1080161,5,6305810109,"The Straight Story is film paradise; repeated viewings will only make you like it more.  It is an extraordinary work of art that is as surprising as it is richly rewarding.  If ever there was a case of ""less is more,"" this is it.

The story, (both bizarre and fact-based), is almost Shaker-esque in its simplicity.  Alvin Straight, a 73-year-old man in failing health from Laurens, Iowa, rides a garden tractor 320 miles to Mt. Zion, Wisconsin in hopes of making peace with his dying, estranged brother Lyle.  On the way, the incredibly slow way, he meets nice people and we learn a great deal about him.  (Imagine pitching that to a producer!)

Retired stuntman Richard Farnsworth plays Alvin to perfection.  The hard years are visible; his craggy face resembles a well-worn baseball glove, although there's sparkle, even mischief, in his eyes.  When Alvin smiles it's the smile of a man who has seen all the hardship life has to offer and still chooses to embrace it.  Straight is laconic but unlike most characters, every word matters and reverberates with authenticity.

The pacing in this picture is faultless, through vignettes played out in chance encounters we come to understand Straight and the complex trials he's endured, as well as his need to make amends with brother Lyle.  These small scenes are played out on a vast, sumptuous visual canvas of American farmland, gigantic John Deere harvesters cut broad swathes as Alvin put-puts in the foreground.

The reliable Angelo Badalamenti provides a lovely, non-intrusive score while Sissy Spacek shines as Alvin's daughter.  But the truly stunning thing about The Straight Story is that it was directed by David Lynch, demonstrating once and for all that Lynch is capable of creating movie magic without resorting to dwarfs talking backwards and dogs dining on severed ears.  This is a profoundly humanistic and gentle film that moves with slow confidence - no cheap tricks.  For me, knowing that Lynch made The Straight Story actually improves all his other films after the fact.",1154044800,5,2041,4.994082840236686

And it has been since early this month since I last got up a review, so I think it is time for a movie review, I enjoyed pretty much a lot of the movie, all expect for the ending of the movie, which I think could have been better, and I hate to spoil the ending of a movie, and there might be still some people out there, that haven't seen a movie yet, and I would hate to see it spoiled for them, so I do not do it, and it would be a good idea that nobody does, otherwise, they might be angry if it was spoiled for them.

But since this is a live action movie, and not a cartoon, I had better get back on subject. This movie is supposed to be based onb a true story, but how much is true, since you know comapnies love to invent things for these kind of movies that never happened in real life. The late Richard Farnsworth stars as a real life man, that decided in 1994, to makea journey from his home to visit his brother that he hadn't seen in 10 years to make peace, when he learns his brother has suffered a stroke.

1080166,5,6305810109,"It's true that it's surprising to see this movie knowing that the director is responsible for some of the most bizarre and confounding films ever made; it's also possible that David Lynch is the only director who could have made it so perfectly. The cinematography consistently resembles a moving painting, while the quiet moments between characters lends a realistic, often quirky, gravity to the story.

Alvin Straight, after suffering a small heart attack, has a wake-up call: time is precious, and too much of it--years, in fact--have been wasted continuing a long period of non-communication with his brother, Lyle. The reasons why this silent feud exists no longer matters to Alvin, who decides to swallow his pride, mount his lawnmower (in nearly as ill-health and age as Alvin himself) and ride from his home in Iowa to Mt. Zion, Wisconsin to visit his brother. What at first seems stubborn and ridiculous soon becomes admirable and even heroic as Alvin travels through the majestic (and perilous) countryside, encountering interesting characters and situations along the way, never passing up a chance to share nuggets of wisdom or advice. We soon understand why he wants to make this trip in the fashion he has chosen--and can't help but respect him.

This is a simple plot and story which needs to be seen to be absorbed, and if you're not sitting there rooting for this determined old man to complete his epic journey, one long mile after another, each hill a mountain, than you need to have a revelation of your own. Genuine acting, incredibly beautiful vistas of the Midwest, perfect pacing, interesting characters and a message for everyone that ""late is better than never"". ""The Straight Story"" is a true family film which will never grow old.

1080187,5,6305810109,"I first saw The Straight Story in a film class last year.  I am a fan of David Lynch and was surprised not to have heard of the film.  What I expected and what I got were too very different things.  Normally Lynch is known for challenging the viewers sense of reality and normality, Eraserhead challenged the conception of family and fatherhood.  The Straight Story seems to be an American validation of these things.

The Straight Story is a very touching film about an aging man, Straight, who recieved news that his estranged brother had a stroke and may be in his final days.  Being self-sustaining, but having the eyesight of a bat, Straight is forced to pack up a trailer, attach it to a riding lawnmover, and drive several states to visit his brother before it is too late.

The real power of the film is in its pacing, the people and stories Straight meets along the way, and the beauty of the American heartland.  He emparts a lifetime worth of wisdom to people who need it, and is able to reflect and come to peace with his own life.

I found Straight to embody something about the American cowboy still alive today.  He wants his autonomy andto blaze his own trail.  Through his slow travel he is able to soak in his surroundings in the way that a person on horseback can.  He throughly believes in honor, family, brotherhood, paying your own way, and that anyone you meet can be a trusted friend.  A man with stubborn grit and heart.

Great film.  Great male lead by Richard Farmsworth.  Great supporting roles such as Sissy Spacek.  Great Direction by David Lynch.",1143158400,9,1577,4.535460992907802
1080188,2,6305810109,"I realize I'm taking a chance by writing this review.  The people that don't like this movie are a minority, and get lots of 'unhelpful review' marks.

However, I can't recommend this movie.  The story behind this movie is touching and it drives the viewer to want to see the movie through.

The problem is with the film itself.  The story is good, it's heartwarming, it provokes reflection... but the film is not and does not.

The acting in this film is embarrassing to watch at times.  The cheesiness of some of the dialogue is over-the-top.  The direction... I hate to say it, but it looks like a movie made for television, and for a Saturday afternoon at that.  The characters are mostly hollow (the deer-lady reminded me of the log-lady from earlier David Lynch work).

I started watching this movie and it had enough potential to make me follow it through, but at every turn it just got worse.

Now, I'm not the type that is going to dismiss a movie because something doesn't blow up every 45 seconds... it's fine that this movie has a slow, deliberate pace.  However, what it lacks is meaningful character interation, irony, conflict, tension - anything to raise the interest level.  The closest thing we get to emotion is regret, and regret is hardly a plot-driver.  The two most interesting characters of the film are separated early on and rarely interact after that.  The rest of the character interaction is basically limited to saying nice things to each other followed by ""good luck"" ""thanks for the help"" ""amen to that"" ""nice to meat you"" kind of dialogue.

The emotion is always intense and there is a place for this art, which alarms and threatens with only vague explanation.  The Straight Story is a remarkable narrative by any messure, but perhaps more remarkable considering it comes from Lynch.  The emotion is as intense as ever, but the plot is completely comprehensive and digestable.  A man embarks on a journey to make amends with his ailing brother using the feable means available to him.  Along the way his values and good nature are embued on those that he passes on his jouney.  The wisdom and revelations seem profound in their simplicity, and Lynch lets the strength of the story capture his audience.

1080194,5,6305810109,"If you are considering buying/renting/watching ""The Straight Story"", you should know that people are not lying when they tell you that it is nothing but an old guy (played by Richard Farnsworth) who decides to make a 300+ mile trip on his small riding lawnmower. He meets a lot of nice ordinary people, he dispenses a little sage advice, he reflects a little on his life, and nothing much happens to him. It is closely based on a real event that was newsworthy not because of what happened to Alvin Straight on his journey, but because of the human-interest angle of a guy making a journey in such a unique way.

David Lynch does a nice job of directing this Disney production, but do not expect a lot of wild expressionistic developments.

A lot of people really like this film and a lot of other people are asking, ""why do people like this movie so much""? And they are the polite ones. Less polite ones are branding the film ""manipulative"" which seems like a strange criticism for a film. Aren't they supposed to be manipulative? Don't people watch films to be manipulated? If you insist on viewing ""The Straight Story"" and if you generally know what you are getting into, you should enjoy it. If you are looking for its deeper meanings I suggest that you watch it along with Monte Hellman's ""Two Lane Blacktop"". Both are road pictures and Alvin Straight's orientation as a young man was probably not much different than the driver (James Taylor) in that film. The difference is the stage of life in which the journey is being taken. Both have an intended destination. But for the driver in ""Two Lane Blacktop"" it is just a excuse to keep on the move, the highway stretches out endlessly before him and life is a journey not a destination. For Straight it is a single-minded trip that he views as his last chance to mend fences with his brother who has just had a serious stroke. It is very likely the last trip he will ever make but he does not savor the journey, he does not take satisfaction in overcoming obstacles, or even find much pleasure in his positive encounters with strangers. For him the destination is all important.

This was Farnsworth's last picture, in declining health he committed suicide by gunshot a few months after the film's release. One can't help but speculate on whether he was aware during filming that ""The Straight Story"" would be the final act in his long career, and how much of that realization was incorporated into his performance.

Straight's journey is a lot like that of Ned Merrill (Burt Lancaster) in ""The Swimmer"". Merrill got it into his head that he could restore things to how they were in his idyllic past if he could just swim home one afternoon through the backyards of his wealthy Connecticut suburb, using his neighbors' pools. Straight is not that delusional but he has come to believe that his brother will remain alive and be waiting for him as long as he stubbornly sticks to his original idea of traveling by mower.

His other motivation for insisting on this means of travel (he won't take a bus and he turns down a ride for the last 60 miles) is to demonstrate how sincerely he wants to reconcile. If you give someone a horse it will be a lot more impressive if it is your only horse and it means that now you will have to walk. To walk is part of the gift.

An unexpected turn by director Lynch (*Blue Velvet* and *Wild At Heart*), without any of the irony and surrealism that he thrives on. A gorgeous score emphasizes the endless sweeping shots of America The Beautiful, with the attendant spacious skies and amber waves of grain. This is the backdrop for the story of Alvin Straight (Farnsworth), who, for a variety of reasons, decides to drive his lawnmower 300+ miles to see his brother. It is a true story, and you know right off the bat, that this is going to be a tearjerker - Alvin is increasingly infirm at 73, and learns that his estranged brother has had a stroke. He lives with his daughter, Rose (Spacek), who is ""slow."" This is the most mature Sissy yet - she could rest on her laurels and still be hailed as a major actress entering her fourth decade of moviemaking - though in this, she is a minor, but unforgettable, character, and has excellent assistance from the other supporting cast.

As snapshot-like vignettes spin by, we are propelled towards the inevitable meeting, which promises to be a gusher - but isn't. Though it ends rather abruptly when Alvin shows up at his brother's place six weeks later, the story has been told, gloriously.",1106438400,3,1593,4.817518248175182
1080260,5,6305810109,"This film is fantastic!  It's a story about a man who travels a great distance on an old john deere lawnmower to see his brother that he's not seen in 10 years.  It's a wonderful family-oriented film that deals with lots of issues and is surprisingly deep for a Disney film.

Originally I thought that this film might be kind of sappy and tha I might not like it, but I ended up loving it. Richard Farnsworth, usually seen as a stunt man, became the oldest man to receive a best actor academy award nomination for his work in this film.  (He lost to Kevin Spacey.)

This film has nothing offensive in it that I could find.  I don't think there's even any swearing. So if you're looking for a great film to watch with your children and your parents, this is a great one to consider!",1105401600,3,781,4.27891156462585
1080261,5,6305810109,"I recently bought this movie and I am glad I did. A big fan of David Lynch, I now have almost all of his films (except Eraserhead, Dune, and the irritaingly non-existant Twin Peaks 2nd season box set). Upon watching this film, what struck me was the breath-taking beauty of the combination of cinematography and score. Watching the gentle passing over golden rows of corn and hauntingly empty main streets with the excellent orchestration of Angelo Badalementi will warm anyone's heart. The story of a dying old man making a final trip of reconcilliation with himself and with his brother is not something you'd expect to see from hollywood these days. Funny how a movie like this could be made by a director who is used to delving into the dark parts of the human psyche.

As I said, the camerawork, score, story, and characters are top-notch. However, there is one complaint I have with this film. I'm not familiar with Alvin Straight the man, but I felt that at times the film portrayed him as some sort of saint, dispensing wisdom to everyone he comes across. Maybe in talking to others, Straight was in a way talking to himself...

I highly recommend The Straight Story to anyone who wants a real family film, a film with not only a good message but a film that is a great work of art.

All of those bad undergraduate memories of gothed-out, late-night ""Blue Velvet"" movie get-togethers, having to hear people babble endlessly on about ""Twin Peaks"" in the early 90's, and high school ""Eraserhead"" days all combined throughout time to make me hate David Lynch. Then I heard ""The Straight Story"" was about some guy on a lawn mower. I thought it was going to be pointlessly weird and annoying.

I was wrong, thank goodness! This was a hypnotic film that really touches your heart. I never cry when I watch a movie, but this one got the waterworks flowing (I'm embarassed to say). There was nothing weird or pointlessly strange about it (I'm glad!). The musical score was wonderful, and the performances luminous. The storyline is highly creative, while still being a believable slice-of-life at the same time.

In an odd way, this film reminded me of ""Slingblade"". Pretty much, if you liked ""Slingblade"", you'll like this movie. Although this movie is not as dark as ""Slingblade"" (in fact, I was surprised to learn after seeing it that ""The Straight Story"" is rated G -- usually I dislike movies rates G -- but this is an exception to the rule).

I grew up in a small farm town and noone was that lost to reality as these people (really the script writer, this thing must had script problems from day one).  Is portraying a vacant town supposed to say something?  Seems like all the more reason to get out of there, looks like some sort of post-apocalyptic armageddon.

This is supposed to be the central motivator and it is completely wasted.  And what the hell is Sissy supposed to be?  Her speech impediment character is unbelievable and just detracts from the main story.  She has nothing of value to say that has any bearing on anything.  Hallucinating about the child with the ball looks like it might provide some real meat and then never provides and impetus to the plot.  And where did that guy to to cinematography school?

Despite everything I've offered, the film depends upon one man- Richard Farnsworth.  In his last role, his award-winning performance is a master class in listening and being.  He IS Alvin Straight instead of acting like Alvin Straight.  His beautiful blue eyes are weary with pain and memories.  I have never seen the eyes convey so very much.

1080307,5,6305810109,"""The Straight Story"" is a true story about a 73 year old man who drove 300 miles on a riding lawnmower to visit his estranged brother who has just had a stroke. Why did he ride a lawnmower? Well, as he tells almost everyone who asks in the movie, his eyesight is bad and he doesn't' have a drivers license. Alvin Straight is opinionated, pigheaded and cantankerous - he is not a particularly intelligent man but when he speaks, his carefully chosen words speak volumes about life. He meets many people along his five-week journey and along the way, he ruminates about mistakes he made in his life, human nature as well as the wisdom and downfalls of old age. Above all, he dispenses common sense, especially to those in need of it.
Like Alvin's character, this is a simple film, brilliantly filmed by director David Lynch, but one that will stick with you long after the final credits. Richard Farnsworth received a well deserved Academy Award nomination for Best Actor (he committed suicide one year later after being diagnosed with terminal cancer). Sissy Spacek is, as always, wonderful as Alvin's daughter, a semi-retarded woman who herself lives in the shadow of a devastating secret. But all of the actors in this film are great, even the ones who only have brief scenes. The cinematography is wonderful as well with the camera sweeping across the prairies and plains of the Mid-West.
It may come as a surprise that this film was made by David Lynch, the director who has made such unconventional films as ""Blue Velvet,"" ""Naked Lunch,"" and the tv series ""Twin Peaks."" For those familiar with his work, it may seem unbelievable that this is the same David Lynch, but it shows the true mark of a gifted and versatile filmmaker.",1074556800,5,1731,4.7161716171617165

Most of  the others, like me, appreciated the slow moving (just like five mph Deere mower) unfolding of Alvin's big adventure and the folks he met.  Where else other than the Midwest, where honesty comes as standard, could this story take place.
There is so much to enjoy!  Angelo Badalamenti creates the perfect bluegrass style theme music, cinematographer Freddie Francis captures the gorgeous colors of the Midwest, the actors and especially Richard Farnsworth sparkle.  Great lines, too, Alvin says to a hitchhiker, who has run away from home and shares a meal with him around the campfire, ""A warm bed in a house sounds a mite better than eating a hot dog on a stick with an old geezer travelling on a lawn mower"".

The Straight Story, an even cleaner film than his 1980 Elephant Man, could not be more G-rated.  But Lynch shows us here that he does not need to use his common elements to make a great film.
The transfer:
Theres really nothing wrong with this transfer, although there shouldnt be, considering that it was made about 4 years ago.  You get a nice 5.1 surround, and clear picture, and a very wide presentation.
Thre supplements:
Nada.  Actually, on the whole disc, there is only 2 menus.  The only thing that makes this disc sold without a box is a trailer, and a little note from Lynch himself explaining why there isn't any chapter stops (sadly, for most this film would have to be seen in parts, unless your so comfortable in your seat you don't want to get up).
For kids?
Although this is G-rated, anyone under 10 would fall asleep in less than 10 minutes.  Forget children, most adults would not have the patience for this film.

1080346,5,6305810109,"""The Straight Story"" has the gorgeously colored, semi-surreal look of a typical David Lynch movie, but here the surrealism is lyrical and benign. There are no armies of insects fighting to the death underneath the amber wheatfields, no severed ears in the pristine woods. The overweight next-door neighbor, sunning herself while eating pastel-colored Hostess snowballs, may look weird, but she's perfectly nice. As the title implies, this is the ""straight"" and deceptively simple story based on the true tale of Alvin Straight, an elderly Iowa man who, hearing that his long-estranged brother has had a stroke, wants to go to Wisconsin and mend fences with him. Too incapacitated himself to drive a car, he hitches a trailer to his riding lawn mower and spends five weeks driving the 300 miles along country roads to his brother's house. That's all there is to it, but it's incredibly moving, thanks to Freddie Francis' gorgeous photography of the Midwest countryside and Lynch's poetic direction. Above all, what makes this movie worth seeing is the exquisite, deeply moving performance of Richard Farnsworth as Alvin Straight. Silent for long stretches of the film, Farnsworth tells the story of Straight's life mainly through his eyes, showing a world of stubborn decency and bitter regret. When Farnsworth does speak--such as his monologue in a bar about his World War II experiences as a sniper--you will never forget it. There is only one recent screen performance that is at all like Farnsworth's--Adrien Brody's in ""The Pianist."" There is also Sissy Spacek's performance as Straight's mentally challenged daughter Rose; although Spacek's performance seems overly mannered at first, she keeps revealing telling details about Rose until, at the end, her performance is as haunting as Farnsworth's own. ""The Straight Story"" may have the look and slightly off-kilter feel of a David Lynch movie, but at heart it resembles another recent Disney-released movie, ""The Rookie,"" which also is deeply concerned with the love of family and the need for second chances in life. Both movies are beautifully realized, but ""The Straight Story"" is an authentic American masterpiece.",1048982400,4,2174,5.286127167630058
1080347,5,6305810109,"Someone once ridiculed me because I said I loved this ""old person's movie"".  Indeed this movie lacks the sex and violence and sarcasm that dominates today's Gen Xer's video library. But does that make it a film intended strictly for the geriatric crowd?  Heck no!!  It's one of THE best movies I've ever seen. Perhaps it's because I grew up in a small Illinois town, pop. 550.  Perhaps it's because Alvin Straight reminded me so much of my own dad puttering around on his tractor.  Perhaps it's because it was so realistic and sweet...whatever the reason, this movie touched me down to the core.
I love films based on real-life.  Sissy Spacek is cute and believable as Rose.  Her stuttering and simplistic portrayal made me feel Rose's pain.  And Mr. Farnsworth's interpretation of Alvin is stunning.  He is a simple man, there's no doubt about it.  Anyone who would jump on a tractor and drive himself hundreds of miles without investing in a bus ticket or thinking to go to the local church to ask for a ride is someone who clearly doesn't accept charity.  He probably never considered himself needy.  This was his last goal in life, to mend fences between he and his brother.
Who didn't grab a hanky at the last scene when they finally reconcile in their quiet, simple way?  Too many words pass between people today.  If everyone was an Alvin Straight, we'd be doing a lot more thinking and a lot less yammering away.
I could rave on and on about this movie, maybe because I'm a country girl at heart.  It's a family movie, although young kids will probably get bored.  It's not fast-paced, and if you're looking for a climax, you're probably not going to get it.  However, if you and your sweetie just want to cuddle up while watching something sweet and adorable and redeeming for the human soul, this is it.  And the soundtrack is a MUST.

1080380,4,6305810109,"David Lynch, one of the contemporary cinema's true magicians, converts his power to casting white magic in this quietly intoxicating ode to silent reflection and natural beauty.
One of the great keys to telling a great story on film lies in not what is said and done, but often what isn't. This is admittedly what often turns me away from Lynch's other works. Here, he embraces economy and finds gentle hope in America's heartland.
""The Straight Story"" is exactly what the title implies: a story about sticking to the essentials of honest linear narrative structure and leaving out anything extra. It is so promising that this film was made even at all. All too often, Film makers treat their audiences like idiots and feel that every motivation, thought and reaction must be dictated through rapid editing, snappy one-liners, super stunts and CGI effects all set to a blaring soundtrack.
""The Straight Story"" is a movie about quiet truths and requires the audience to fill in the blanks. Fine case in point: in the film, Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) listens to a woman vent about running over deer. As she screeches off in her compact car, Alvin simply stares down at the deer. Usually, the filmmaker will insist upon some quick quip that comments on the action and the character, but not here. We simply move on to see Straight cooking a piece of venison over a campfire while being stared at by a molded plastic deer lawn sculpture. The scene where Farnsworth and another aged actor whisper and bare the scars of the their wartime experiences is also another fine moment that simply happens. Lynch allows the camera to lovingly and tenderly hold on his actors' beautifully weatherbeaten faces. These are wise men who have seen much more than we could ever possibly imagine.
Sissy Spacek, Richard Farnsworth and the rest of the cast give fully fleshed out and three dimensional characters. The film is quietly moving without the slightest hint of sentimental seasoning. It earns its happy ending honestly. Thank you David Lynch for creating a genuine near classic work of American Film Art. A worthy addition to any home film library.

Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth, in his last movie role), a mostly-disabled farmer living with his slow-but-gentle daughter Rose (Sissy Spacek), learns that his health may be declining after both his hips give out.  His doctor tells him that unless he quits smoking and begins to eat well, he will have more serious health problems.  Then, Alvin gets a phone call from his brother, Lyle, who has suffered a stroke.  Alvin and Lyle have not spoken in years, and Alvin decides to go visit.  With bad eyesight and a daughter who cannot drive, Alvin sets off across Iowa to Wisconsin on a riding lawnmower, trailer in tow.
Along the way, he meets a variety of people who help him out, and talk with him about his trip and why he's going.  As he meets different people, more of Alvin and Lyle's background is revealed, and the good nature of the main character becomes apparent.  Lynch is a master filmmaker, and in his hands this script becomes magic.  It moves along at a lawn-mower pace (pardon the pun), preferring to focus on character and dialogue than action, weaving an amazingly-accurate portrayal of middle-low-class Midwestern life.  Lynch is known for his attention to detail, and he does not disappoint: most, if not all, of the film was shot on-location and in real buildings (as opposed to soundstages), and he bucked convention and cast real-life people in real-life roles.  These aren't liposuctioned models or Hollywood pretty-boys; women have cottage cheese on their legs, men have scars and stubble, clothes are dirty, hair is greasy, and houses are dirty - in other words, it's got a sense of verisimilitude rare in any film.
""The Straight Story"" is, in many ways, an anti-""Blue Velvet"" or an anti-Tragedy (in the true meaning of that word).  Like ""BV,"" it offers an unflinching view of middle-class life, but instead of the constructed, artificial town of Lumberton, ""The Straight Story"" offers something more like a documentary look at people.  Although no one in the film moralizes, and Lynch certainly doesn't use his camera to preach, what ""The Straight Story"" manages is to paint a view that, at their hearts, people are basically good.  While bad people, car chases, explosions, and Evil Warlords might make a good movie (or a profitable newscast, depending on your level of cynicism), it's refreshing to see a master present a project that reminds us that, at our core, we are all good people, and it's really not that difficult to be good to each other.
As for the DVD, I think it goes without saying that watching Lynch's films in anything but widescreen is a crime, so it's good they gave us a solid, anamorphic transfer.  He doesn't like extras, so everything is bare-bones, but considering the quality of the motion picture, the price can be forgiven.

1080385,5,6305810109,"Many of the below reviews explain why this film is excellent.  I wanted to add that it's not an atypical Lynch film.  Not very like his past efforts, yet his hand is evident.
Lynch has always been fascinated with texture, long drawn out closeups of normal surfaces, and there is that (the corn fields, the highway).  There are (mildly) quirky characters and incidents (the deer lady; the repairman brothers -- one with an unusual bandage, of sorts, on his chin).  There are otherwise normal characters carrying dark secrets (the vets discussing World War 2).
And while Lynch has always been fascinated with the dark secrets beneath Middle America, he's also long evinced a genuine love for Middle America.  His tales tend to be about innocents who are attracted and drawn into darkness, yet they are at the same time genuinely innocent.  And Lynch has never mocked them for their innocence, just as he does not mock them for their quirks.
The Straight Story emphasizes this softer side of Lynch -- his love of Middle American innocence -- but that's always been an element of his work, albeit under-emphasized in Twin Peaks and Blue Velvet.
Likewise, Lynch's longtime music collaborator, Angelo Badalamenti, creates a score that's also softer yet typical of Badelamenti's work.
The Straight Story is masterpiece that stands on its own, but it remains a Lynchian masterpiece.",1024531200,5,1374,5.004385964912281

No Marilyn Manson cameos. No identity swapping. No ""I have your disease in me now."" Yes, sir, this is not your typical David Lynch film.
 The first time I saw this, I was blown away by the almost void of idiosynchcrasies. There is the occasional ""party"" reference to remind you that you are still watching a film by THE David Lynch but it is mostly just there to tell a most unusual true story about brotherly love and devotion. This is Lynch's first true story film since ""Elephant Man"" and may be his best overall production since. Before this, people said his strongest, most put-together film was ""Blue Velvet,"" but now it has been replaced with this gem. It contains the final performance of Richard Farnsworth (who, I think, SHOULD have won the OSCAR that year. Sorry, Mr. Spacey). And marks the first time the wonderful Sissy Spacek (who has worked with Lynch since ""Eraserhead"") has acted for Lynch as Alvin Straight's most secretive daughter. Though most Lynch devotees will be bored senseless while waiting for things to get ""wierd,"" most viewers content with watching G-rated, Disney-distributed films will find inspiration and enjoyment at watching the old man go all of that way, even if Lynch might be discreetly mocking him at times (just look at that shot of Alvin going only abut five yards after fifteen seconds when the camera goes up and comes down on him). The Badalamenti music (see, this film isn't so unusual for Lynch, after all) is also top-notch, even if if it doesn't always mix with the final picture completely at times. Overall, a triumph for Lynch and its actors. This deserves to become a family classic!",1023753600,2,1812,4.84516129032258
1080387,5,6305810109,"This is not just the true story of very determined man named Alvin Straight, it is also a truly straightforward story, an unusual thing in modern movies
and a real surprise coming from David Lynch.  With his own mortality staring him in the face, Alvin Straight, 73 years old, decides to go visit the
once beloved brother, Lyle, from whom he has been estranged for ten years, their quarrel a product of sibling rivalry as old as the Bible and the
baleful influence of liquor.  What might have been a simple enough five hour car ride becomes an epic journey when he decides to travel the 300
miles from Laurens, Iowa to Mt. Zion, Wisconsin on a riding lawnmower :
  I've got to go see Lyle, and I've got to make the trip on my own.
Along the way he meets a young runaway girl; a woman who plows into a deer in front of him, apparently a near daily occurrence for her; a couple
who allow him to spend a few days with them after he fries a motor on a steep downhill grade; a fellow WWII vet tending bar; and finally a pastor in
whose cemetery he stops overnight.  Over the course of the six week sojourn he slowly reveals himself and his regrets for his part in the feud that has
separated him from his brother.  As he tells the pastor:
  I want to sit with him and look up at the stars, like we used to, so long ago.
When finally he gets to Lyle's place, his penance done, the two do indeed sit in comfortable silence on the front porch, as the stars come up
overhead.  It's the kind of speechless togetherness that only people who truly love one another are capable of maintaining and enjoying.
This is entirely Richard Farnsworth's film, a role he richly deserved after a lifetime in the movies.  He began in Hollywood as a teenager in 1937,
doubled for Roy Rogers and Gary Cooper, drove a chariot in The Ten Commandments, worked as a stuntman, a role player, and only very
occasionally the lead.  Farnsworth was one of the few truly conservative people left in Hollywood and maybe the only one in recent memory who
sometimes turned down films that failed to meet his own ethical standards--as regards profanity, sex, and violence.  Somehow--and I've no idea
how--that integrity was etched into his face.
In the underrated movie The Big Kahuna there's a scene early on where a young man tells Danny DeVito that a secretary said he'd be easily
recognizable because his face has character.  Later on there are scenes where DeVito is almost preternaturally calm and the only forward momentum
of the story is supplied by that character-filled face.  Farnsworth had such a face too and that's an exceedingly rare quality in any human being, but
especially an actor, particularly in a day and age when special effects, plastic surgery, and bad scripts have made it easy to cast pleasant looking idiots
in most movie roles.  Recall the scene in Sunset Boulevard when Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) says : ""We had faces then"".  In that silent era
faces were required because they had to communicate.  Today, when the films don't even bother trying to communicate anything, who cares if the
faces say anything?  Well, when you see what a real face, like Farnsworth's, can convey, you'll realize what we're missing.
Fittingly, this was Richard Farnsworth's last role.  Like Alvin Straight he went out on his own terms; stricken with a painful terminal cancer, he shot himself on October 6, 2000.

1080420,5,6305810109,"First, let me disclose my bias that I am a HUGE David Lynch fan.  That being said, let me also say that in no way does that sway my opinion of this movie.  Yeah, right.  No, seriously, it doesn't.  Why?  Well...
To begin, this is the most un-Lynchian movie D.L. has ever created.  I say that with somewhat of a ""grain of salt,"" but I think most stalwart Lynch fans will understand my meaning.  This is simply unlike ANYTHING he has ever done.  Period.  There is definitely a linear, less-is-more, mentality in this film.  It is immediately touching and kindles the very most basic humane spirit that (I would like to believe) dwells within us all.
Perhaps the subject matter is the major reason why that is the case.  But simply put, this movie is wholly and completely beautiful.  Every facet of the movie just drips with beauty.  Whether it's the gorgeous sunrises or sunsets over the plains, or whether it's simply LISTENING to Richard Farnsworth (aka ""Alvin Straight"") talk as the viewer stares into a campfire...watching the flames dance around the logs thrown on top of each other.  Whether its seeing the huge amount of road that lay before Alvin Straight, or whether its listening to him haggle over prices of tractor repairs or a ""grabber.""  Every where the viewer is taken, is beautiful.
What else? My God, Harry Dean Stanton.  Can I just digress for a moment and ask:  ""WHEN IS PARIS, TEXAS GOING TO BE RELEASED ON DVD?""  The agony of going with out it (save for an extremely well-worn VHS copy) is torture.  At any rate, enough of that.  My point is this, Harry Dean Stanton (in the words of David Lynch) ""rocks.""  He is an amazing actor. Pure brilliance.  Even his (roughly) two minute appearance in this movie makes it that much more complete.  As an aside once more, Harry Dean Stanton always reminds me of (the old, not young) Chet Baker (of trumpet-playing fame).  Anyone else?
Which brings me to my next amazing person:  Sissy Spacek.  As always, she delivers and impeccable performance as the mildly-brain damaged daughter of Alvin Straight.  Once again Ms. Spacek, kudos.
Of course, the man of the show is the late Richard Farnsworth.  Many may remember him as the sheriff in Stephen King's ""Misery.""  His performance here is just heart-stopping. He was an amazing man, who was perfectly suited for the role of Alivn Straight.
Musically, as with any Lynch film, it is beautiful.  Angleo (""The Bad Angel"") is here again, delivering a more restrained, yet equally capturing, score.  There are very brief moments, that, just for a moment, you can hear remnants of Twin Peaks' material showing their presence (particularly in the very beginning of the film).
There are so many images that come to mind during the course of watching this film.  You are drawn to a variety of mediums from Lynch's imagery.  For instance, the descriptions of the plains that Willa Cather used in her book ""My Antonia"" came to my mind.  Then, for some reason, Steve Earle's song ""The Road Goes On Forever"" came to mind.  The ability of a director to instill (or rather, recall) memories within the viewer's mind is something that is not achieved frequently.  Here, Lynch does it perfectly.
Lastly, despite the fact that this is a G rated movie, and despite the fact that Disney is behind it, it is not a children's movie.  That is, it is not for kids.  Older kids will appreciate the message this movie delivers.  However, younger kids who just finished watching Barney or Rugrats will probably not even understand what is going on within the film.
To make a long (winded) review longer, get this film as soon as you can.  The DVD (technically speaking) is beautiful and I applaud Lynch for not inserting chapter breaks.  But more importantly, the film itself is beautiful and moving and will touch you permanently.",1019174400,2,3810,4.73820395738204
1080421,5,6305810109,"Richard Farnsworth, and his tallent seemed to walk hand in hand, because he was so naturally gifted on screen. From Anne of Green Gables, to The Natural, and even Into the Night, Farnsworth has always done a sure-fire method of humble acting. His gifts, even while under physical pain, were just as evident in the Straight Story.
The 73 year old, cigar loving, veteran, Alvin Straight finds out that his brother is sick, and must go on a journey of forgiveness. He and his brother have resentment in their past and have avoided one another for decades because of a simple argument. Sissy Spasek plays his loving and mentally handicapped daughter. This is one of her best performances (next to ""A place for Annie"").
The mode of transport? An old John Deere lawn mower. Along the way he encounters many people and touches all of their lives. Most memorably the life of a teenage runaway, who is afraid to tell her parents that she is pregnant.
There is one scene that closely reminds me of the ""Carl tells his Past"" portion in the opening of Sling Blade. It is truly haunting as Straight tells one of his new found friends (also a veteran - Straight tells him he could see it in his eyes) about a memory from the war.
The ending of the Straight Story is one of the most rewarding endings you will ever see. It is a simple moment of true emotions and is everything it should be. ~s.a.o.s.~",1018915200,4,1386,4.503968253968254

1080423,4,6305810109,"American Beauty came out the same year as this movie and was nominated at the Oscars like this movie.  However, of the two, I preferred this one for its look at people who are not jaded, cynical, crazy or mean and evil.  The back story of Richard Farnsworth dying by suicide shortly after the Oscars makes his performance all the more poignant.  Mr. Farnsworth is a long time actor with a long movie career and his character is an old man with one final score to settle.  He doesn't use a gun or treachery to settle it, just old-fashioned forgiveness.  For those who think it's a little crazy for someone to ride hundreds of miles in all kinds of weather on a lawn mower doesn't know seniors.  Seniors often have lived so much life that they want to do things on their own terms.  Some want to make their last peace before their demise.
This movie is slow paced. It's funny but not laugh out loud funny (ex. the scene with the road kill deer).  It has moments of tenderness, near tradegy, humor, redemption.  It's a good movie to see with the family, especially after a knock-out, drag out fight between a teen and a parent, spouses, parent and adult children or, like in this movie, with siblings.  I recommend this movie to see around the holidays instead of ""Home for the Holidays"" (which wasn't a bad movie, just one I'd recommend for people with non-dsyfunctional families!) so that families can bury the hatchet and appreciate each other.  This coming from someone has estranged siblings too!
My husband thought Sissy Spacek's performance was the strongest in the movie and her performances always are. However, I was totally enamored of Mr. Farnsworth who also played in Anne of Green Gables. I guess it's because there are so few good parts for people over 60 and it's also good to see actors who are like Michael Jordan have long careers and go out at the top of their game!",1018137600,3,1883,4.55786350148368

The second level directors tend to only imitate what they see. They might be good at it, but the fact remains - its an imitation.""
David Lynch is not a second level director, that's for sure. His work has been described as bizzare, illogical and disturbing. You either hate his movies and turn off the movie after 2-3 mins of watching, or fall in love with every piece he's ever made. You can not stay indifferent. Just like poetry does not have to rhyme to be poetry, his work does not have to be liked by everybody.
Back to Straight Story.
Here is the scoop: it's a movie about an old man who drove his  lawn mower from Iowa to Wisconsin to see his brother who had a stroke.
Not impressed? Wait till you hear this. The lawn mower is a 1966 John Deere and the movie was shot by Disney.
Lets not get carried away here - there is a plus side to it too. The music (as always with Lynch) wrote by Angelo Badalamenti. From the first 2 minutes of the movie you will notice that it is in fact a Lynch movie. However, there is nothing bizzare or disturbing anymore. A lot more calm  to. Badalamenti shines in this one. Unbelievable sensuality. You have to be blind and deaf not to get too emotional at the end. I did.
The movie is the best example of what kind of people Americans are - openminded, gracious, companionate.

1080425,5,6305810109,"We all know and appreciate Lynch with his twisted movies in which the viewer is forced to expect the unexpected and abnormal. When I heard the news, I was very excited that he was going to shoot a road movie that was nothing to do with paranormals and weird characters. After watching Straight story I was wondering  where was he before and why he was not shooting movies like this that can be called normal in his standards once a while.
First of all this is a road movie. But also a movie about an old man who tries his best to achieve what he wants against all odds.
It is also about humanity, respect as well as the elderly people who have seen all about life  but either extremely ignored or not remebered. Lynch manages to build a story combining all these elements and making the movie a visual and an emotional beauty.
Straight story  takes us in to the heart of America with the real American people who are always there but rarely seen in the hollywood productions as normal,friendly folks. We also enter in to the world of elderly, their limited lives and their emotions.  Beautiful camera shots of fields, simple but touching music as well as the remarkable performances by the actors and actresses make this movie a classic. Even during the common road scenes it is difficult not to get very emotional. Lynch not only knows how to get chills to the spine with his previous works, but he also knows how to get in to the people's hearts by a camera.
Overall in my opinion Straight story is an excellent movie which is better than the recent oscar awarded movies with their spoiled  million dollar actors and actresses as well as overblown budgets.

1080427,5,6305810109,"I wonder if David Lynch was drawn to directing this film if only because of the possible title.  But, the film lives up to its title, a feat that Lynch familiars should be interested in.
The film is a very simple (true) tale of Alvin Straight, who learns that his brother - who he hasn't spoken to in years - has had an illness fall upon him and decides to go and see him.  So, he hops on a riding lawnmower and off he goes.  This idea could have easily turned into a silly mess, but throughout, the film is handled with care and sentiment (not sentimentality).
It has a measured pace, so the restless beware.  But if you have no problem with the pace of The Sweet Hereafter or Breaking The Waves, this shouldn't be a problem.  Lynch explores the rural countryside of America with conscience, it's like a love letter to his Heartland Of America roots.
The plot would be pointless to specifically recount because it would just reveal incidents that happen on Alvin's journey.  For the entire film Alvin travels and meets with various people, who are each - in different ways - touched by his presence.  We also meet Alvin's daughter, who is interesting, and we learn about one or two of her problems.  We learn some of Alvin's past by his tellings with others who he meets.
The score is delicate, alomost mournful, played mostly on a violin.
Without trying to sound too pretentious, The Straight Story may be Lynch's most personal film.

1080486,4,6305810109,"Howdy!  First of all, I've seen most of David Lynch's films, and I think this one is one of his best films.  It is a surprisingly straight forward film (rated G, for goodness sakes! on a Lynch film??) and boasts some of the best landscape cinematography, in my humble opinion, since Days of Heaven or The Horse Whisperer.  It is really quite beautiful.  And Richard Farnsworth offers a superb performance as the man who decides to trek cross country to visit his brother (If you don't already know, this film was based on a true story).  Those people interested in Mr. Farnsworth's performance should definitely check out Anne of Green Gables (it is always on PBS for fund-raising and it is probably one of the best family films of the last several decades, honestly!).
This film is slow and methodical and is quite a good counter-point to all the MTV-editing style action films of the day.  But you can read about the plot elsewhere, I want to say a few words about the DVD itself.  This is a STRANGE DVD, to be blunt.  I know David Lynch usually does strange things, but this is *really* strange.  The video and audio quality of the DVD are quite good - no complaints there.  But this is totally bare-bones, only a trailer and nothing else.  Nothing.  Considering the really hefty price tag this DVD has, that's nonsensical.  But the weirdest thing is that the movie is NOT divided into any chapters at all.  It's all ONE chapter.  So if you watch one hour, plug in a different DVD, and then return to this one, you'll have to fast-forward through the entire movie to get back to where you were.  Heaven forbid that you should have a power outage 5 minutes before the end of the movie.  I guess Mr. Lynch wants us to watch the entire film in one setting, but really...
So, I rate the film a very HIGH 5 stars, but because of the peculiar presentation of the DVD, I must bump it down to 4 stars.

1080489,4,6305810109,"Alvin Straight is a man of many years.  He has made mistakes, but he has learned when it is time to set aside pride and do what has to be done -at any cost.
Based on an actual event, David Lynch's latest film The Straight Story, stars Oscar nominee Richard Farnsworth playing the role of Alvin Straight, a 72 year old man who knows the importance of family, a good swisher sweets cigar, and the awe of a summer sky. Straight comes to a realization that he is not getting any younger when he takes a bad fall and then receives news that his brother he hasn't spoken to in ten years has suffered a stroke.
Alvin decides he must leave his home of Laurens, Iowa to visit his brother Lisle in Mt. Zion, Wisconsin. Wanting to complete this journey completely on his own, but without a license or a car, Alvin sets out on his ride-on lawn mower.
Alvin meets many people on his adventure north, giving him time to tell stories and give advice backed by his life of experiences.  The drama builds slowly, but the overall effect is resonant.
Wanting to capture the outdoors just as Alvin would have experienced it, Lynch insisted the movie be filmed on location as well as in the exact seasonal timeframe. The film moves gracefully through the Midwest American landscape with help from director of photography Freddie Francis, who worked with Lynch on The Elephant Man and Dune.
Designed by Angelo Bandalmenti, the soundtrack behind The Straight Story creeps along in a sleepy tone similar to sound design he did with Lynch for the television series Twin Peaks. It provides the perfect emotional backdrop, taking on a darker theme as Alvin crosses the Mississippi River.
Another aspect of the film that cannot be overlooked is Sissy Spacek's performance as Rose, Alvin's ""slower"" daughter. Although the majority of the movie revolves around Alvin, her story and character are vital. Spacek's speech, delivery, and mannerisms as simple as washing the dishes are extraordinarily executed.
The Straight Story ends right on time, no more, no less. It is a simple film about a simple subject, leaving the viewer with a gentle sense of calm. As a follow up to Lost Highway Lynch has redeemed himself.",1001203200,3,2184,4.729658792650919

1080491,5,6305810109,"A tough gig, you would have thought, watching a film about an old geezer who drives his lawnmower halfway across the USA to see his long lost brother. Especially if directed by David Lynch. But he pulls it off, and then some. This is one of the most coherent, positive films I've seen in a long while from anyone - it's even more remarkable that David Lynch directed it, hard on the heels of his celebratedly unfathomable ""Lost Highway"".
For all its difference in outlook, like Wild At Heart and Lost Highway it's an unshamed road movie. Rather than carrying the story, though, here the road (literally and figuratively) IS the story: sweeping shots of the road, the headlight view, turning wheels, highways of corn, rivers of rain down the window and even the the dead straight path of the sun in the late afternoon sky reinforce this idea of an inevitable, pre-ordained journey, which Alvin (the old buzzard on the lawnmower) personifies.
With a beautifully framed sense of fatalism, Lynch takes the ostensibly absurd and makes complete sense out of it: tripping from Iowa to Wisconsin on a lawnmower isn't, you might think, the most commonsense thing to do, but in the context it's the right thing to do; it's the inevitable thing to do - and if you analyse it, it's no more pointless than a lifetime spent smoking and contracting emphysema, or for that matter not speaking to your own brother for ten years - both of which Alvin (and half the rest of us) are guilty of anyway.
The characterisations of the supporting cast are incredibly humane and real - in place of Lynch's usual cast of misfits and weirdoes, Alvin encounters a succession of decent, Middle American folk, who do decent things, whilst giving Alvin the intermittent opportunity to share some hoary old pearls of wisdom, and confront one of two of the demons in his past. This aspect could have easily devolved into sordid sentimentality, but Lynch handles it very deftly indeed. The same could have been true of the final scene, but (without giving away too much), it is done with a beautiful lightness of touch, and it left me with that all-too-rare sense of complete satisfaction as the credits rolled. This is an outstanding movie.",996278400,5,2205,4.759791122715405
1080492,4,6305810109,"The year ""The Straight Story"" came out, Kevin Spacey was chosen over Richard Farnsworth for the ""best actor"" Oscar. In my opinion, though, Richard Farnsworth's performance was much better in many ways. His character depth is sensitive and heartwarming. There are many moments of this movie in which Farnsworth's character, Alvin Straight, nearly moves me to tears. It is the touching story of a man brimming with experience, wisdom, love, and driving determination. It is inspiring and positive. It's a bit slow-paced, on the down-side. That's the only problem I have with it, though. This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Buy it.",994032000,,639,5.037735849056604

1080494,5,6305810109,"'High concept' is a term usually used to describe blockbuster films with plots that can be summarised in one line, preferably five words long. 'Old man drives lawnmower to meet striken brother' sums up 'The Straight Story', but doesn't really do it justice. Basically a long meditation on growing old, it's a slow-moving road movie that nonetheless remains riveting from start to finish, like a cross between 'Koyaanisqatsi' and 'Wild at Heart'. It's also the only film in which Harry Dean Stanton looks relatively young. Richard Farnsworth's performance in the lead role is excellent and understated, although it's hard to separate the character from Farnsworth (who was suffering from terminal cancer, and who took his own life shortly after the film was released) himself. Faults? Lynch keeps his surrealistic instincts in check most of the time, but they burst out in a pointless scene with a woman who keeps crashing her car into deer. And a later scene, in which Farnsworth walks into a bar and has a beer and some emotional catharsis, seems a bit abrupt and contrived. But that's just being mean. This a great film, one well worth seeing, with a superb soundtrack from Angelo Badalamenti. It harkens back to a short period in the very early-70s when Hollywood produced low-budget, small-scale gems, and gives you faith in cinema again. If there is a cinematic opposite of 'New Jack City', this is it. As for the DVD, you just get a trailer and subtitles, and it's in proper widescreen. The dark bits - and there are quite a few dark bits, as the film takes place partly at night - are sometimes a bit jagged and blocky, but the picture and sound are otherwise fine.",989280000,6,1672,4.809027777777778

The acting by Richard Farnsworth is brilliant and heart-wrenching to watch (knowing he was in extreme pain while filming this, and then later taking his own life).  The Straight Story is a mellow movie that is great to unwind and relax to. It's a peaceful journey with an important message at the end of the ride.  Unconditional family love.",982195200,3,590,4.821782178217822
1080566,5,6305810109,"I know the title for this review sounds pretty underwhelming, but I want to stress how much weight the word 'good' means in this case. 1999 gave the audience a troughful of preachy feel good and pretentious message-movies, but 'Straight Story' was the only film that was 'good'. No agenda's or convulated plots, just a simple story of a man and his journey.
'Straight Story' is good for so many different reasons. David Lynch is one of my favourite directors, so I am pretty biased in calling him a genius, but this film truly puts his artist's vision on full display. Though much more 'mainstream' (although how could one ever give this label to Lynch) than his other films, 'Story' contains many elements which definately mark this work as his own. Fascinatingly bizarre (yet strangely real and familiar) characters, often odd camera angles and weird dialogue all inhabit this film.
Performances by the late Richard Farnsworth and Sissy Spacek are so flawless and dead-on real that they can't even be called performances. Farnsworth is especially touching in the poignant role of Alvin Straight, and I believe will long be remembered to be his best role.
Of course, what would a post-'Elephant Man' Lynch film be without the music of Angelo Badelementi? Although quite different from his past masterworks for 'Twin Peaks' and 'Lost Highway', the music he composes still remains beautiful and haunting, a great companion to the visuals Lynch creates.
Some people may feel that this film was stiffed at the Oscars. Heck, I'm glad it wasn't nominated for more. Those statuettes could do nothing but tarnish the true gold found in this movie.",981504000,7,1640,4.967272727272727
1080567,5,6305810109,"In this movie an old man, Alvin Straight, hears that his brother in Wisconsin has suffered a stroke.  The brothers had had an argument 10 years ago and had not spoken since. Alvin decides that he will travel to see his brother on the only mode of transportation at his disposal, a lawnmower.  The story is of his journey, both physical and emotional, towards a reconciliation.  This is a simple, but poignant movie.  When Alvin reminisces about childhood memories we have only his words, not a visual flashback.  Along the way Alvin encounters many kind people who help him when he has the inevitable problems of a 300 plus mile trip on a lawnmower.  He refuses offers of a ride by more speedy transportation, preferring instead to make his journey alone and unaided.  Alvin is played to perfection by Richard Farnsworth whose facial expressions and measured words communicate a world of emotion.  Sissy Spacek is very believeble as Alvin's mildly retarded, speech-impaired daughter.  This is a real tribute to family values and the strength of the human spirit.",981158400,5,1062,4.921348314606742

1080570,5,6305810109,"Apart from simply implying that the film is the story of Alvin Straight, the title, ""The Straight Story"" is also a colloquial reference to Lynch's crystal clear vision. That, appropriately is where all irony ends. The Straight Story is not a film of metaphors or symbols, although the journey of a stubborn man across 370 miles to see his ailing brother, his encounter with a wide variety of folk has been construed as some sort of fable. Lynch, always one to expose the rot the lies beneath the picket fences, has a filmography that would encourage such an interpretation. The story here, from all angles is that of a man and his mower, and ofcourse everything in his long life that has led to this momentous journey.
Richard Farnsworth was nominated for best actor in a leading role, and lost. Perhaps that was appropriate. There is a certain falsehood in the word ""performance"". He wears the sorrow and the joy of some 70 odd years on his face. Unlike many movies about or featuring elders, the film doesn't presume him to be some ubiquitous fountain of wisdom. He is honest, and whatever wisdom he has was hard earned. The worst thing about being old he tells a somewhat hyper cyclist he meets on the road is ""remembering when you were young"". Maybe a better accolade for Farnsworth is people's inability to describe how he is in the film. An expression, that seems to emulate from whatever soul human beings have, is worn on his face. It says, and affects, more then is feasible to describe.
There was I recall surprise at the kindness of this film. Not just to Straight, but to the strangers he meets on the journey. They are, surprisingly for Lynch, not only sane, but ones I would be glad to run into if I just happened to be travelling on lawnmower. Lynch's fans would recognize that, although seemingly the opposite of the likes of Blue Velvet and Wild at Heart, The Straight Story comes from the same place, the same wordless search for the truth, whether in ugliness, beauty or kindness. In one scene that will be remembered for a very long time: Straight sits with a stranger. They discuss drinking, and from there, the war. There is no music, just brief sounds of battle, but no visuals. Both men experience an unexpected outpour that can only come adventitiously. He remembers those young boys back in the field ""I dream of their faces. Sometimes, it's not even my buddies, sometimes its German boys. We were shooting moon-face boys at the end of the war. Every year I live is a year more then they've had"". Quietly, this scene dwarfs Spielberg's entire Saving Private Ryan, and Lynch.... I was going to say does it, but rather, he lets it happen with the melancholy in an old man's eyes.
Search if you must but you won't find another film quite like this one. The closest I can think of is Wim Wender's Paris, Texas, another seemingly unaffected film. The elements of The Straight Story are indeed superlative. Angelo Badalementi's score, particularly the twangy violin, soft acoustic guitar of Laurens Walking, is cleansing, mournful, understated. Freddie Francis's photography is breathtaking, but somehow, never overpowers the film. I would call it a masterpiece. But what Lynch and his collaborators have accomplished is a form of cinematic purity that transcends such pedestrian praise. It gains an added measure of poignancy when you consider that Farnsworth took his own life last year in the face of terminal cancer. In the film, a stranger offers to give him a ride to his brother's place. He smiles, thankful and says ""I am gonna finish this one my own way"". I could never tell exactly why, but his final gaze up at the stars is one of the great moments in cinema.",978825600,17,3690,4.704791344667697
1080571,5,6305810109,"This movie is an oh so important and pleasant reminder that you don't need to have sex, action, violence, special effects, big budgets, box office draws, or complicated scripts to produce quality.  IT'S THE STORY that drives it all.  And within is a very powerful one but one without a great deal of dialogue or bravado.  In this case it was totally unnecessary.
The only rebuttal I would make to any critics who say that this film moved to slowly is that the director was trying to create a sense of time and distance.  That of a life, relationships, regrets and revelations.  None of which happen in a moment or are necessarily singular events.  Wisdom comes with time and in small increments just as the trip (in the film) demonstrates.  So for me the story did not move slowly at all.
If you need to be bombarded with the stupidity and inane activity that occurs in too many Hollywood films today then the Straight Story is definitely not for you.  On the other hand if you can appreciate truth, honesty, and the beauty of the human spirit then you will truly revel in The Straight Story.",978566400,4,1092,4.535714285714286

The story is simple and unencumbered, yet so engaging.  And yes, I am one of those people that have grown tired of exploitative sex, violence and language.  This film has a way of putting you into an introspective mode.  I live in the ""Silicon Valley"" area.  It is expensive and full of self-centered individuals...maybe I have been like that too.  So, seeing this film, with all its peace, serenity, and genuineness of story made me think about a greater good (sounds so corny I guess)I might consider for my life.

I wondered, as with the other movie, how Lynch would avoid the inevitable sentimental finish, and, as he did before, he ends this one powerfully by going the opposite way you'd expect.
Farnsworth underplays to the point where you might wonder if he's playing at all, but try to imagine anyone else handling the role better.  There are moments when all I remember is his face, particularly those eyes, and those are the most powerful moments of all.  (Such a loss.)

Everything about this movie is beautiful-from the shots of the expansive Iowa grain fields, the colorful sunrises (and sets), the small towns, the Mississippi river, to the warm hearted midwesterners who bid the old man well has he slowly travels down the road. And, not to be disappointed by the ending, it has such a peaceful tone that one leaves this movie definitely touched and having a little more optimism about our country and its people.

1080594,3,6305810109,"From ELEPHANT MAN to SAILOR AND LULA and from ERASERHEAD to TWIN PEAKS, director David Lynch has written some of the most intriguing pages of modern cinema. So I was a little puzzled after having seen THE STRAIGHT STORY, a movie David Lynch shot in the autumn of 1998 in Iowa and Wisconsin. Apart of the first travelling of the movie and an accident scene shot in a subjective manner through Alvin's eyes, the movie adopts a very classic form. Obviously, David Lynch didn't want us to be distracted from the story he chose to film.
Now, is there any substance in this story of an old man deciding to visit his brother by driving an unusually slow vehicle ? Of course, yes. The theme of the redemptive trip can been found in thousand of books and naturally in most of the road movies shot since the sixties. But, in my opinion, what makes THE STRAIGHT STORY strange and truly original is Alvin's idea that if he can make it, his brother will be still alive on his arrival. The trip is not only redemptive for Alvin and his conscience, it is also magic. And I'm intimately convinced that this is the theme which has seduced David Lynch, mystic among the mystics.
Sissy Spacek proves once more that she is a very talented actress in THE STRAIGHT STORY and the only reason I give only three stars to this movie is that I would have liked a little more madness in the treatment of this unusual story.

But instead of writing about what everyone already knows, which is, that this is a wonderful film, I would like to point out the two unforgettable men of this film - Alvin Straight and Richard Farnsworth.  Alvin Straight gave us this story.  He gave us a story of courage, perseverance, wisdom, and forgiveness.  Alvin's story made me wish I knew him personally.  It made me wish I was one of those fortunate people that he met during his journey.  Richard Farnsworth gave us Alvin.  Again, everyone agreed that Richard Farnsworth's portrayal of Alvin was impeccable, and it truly was.  But to me, I do not believe that Mr. Farnsworth solely resorted to his acting abilities for this portrayal.  I believe he identified with Alvin's physical and emotional trials, since Mr. Farnsworth, himself, was suffering from a terminal illness. And like Alvin, Mr. Farnsworth forged on through the pain.  He gave a flawless performance and completed his last film.  In many ways, Mr. Farnsworth was giving us himself while he was giving us Alvin.

While I thought Farnsworth's acting was great, as usual; I've seen Sissy Spacek put in more effort in other films, but there were parts of this film that dragged along and there were a few scenes, when he had set up his trailer/tent in the back yard of the folks who help him when the tractor breaks down, that didn't make sense.  The scenes were filmed far away and though the actors were talking you couldn't make out what they were saying. I suppose these scenes had their purpose in the movie, but I found them annoying. Also some of the scenes ended quickly and strangely as though it was cutting to a commercial (as you would see on television--fade to black).  Overall, though, the message got through and it was an inspiring film. Richard Farnsworth deserved an award for his performance.  I just don't think there is anything in there that reaches out and embraces you. Even the several scenes that showed the country side were a little boring (rows and rows of wheat fields (?).  Even the scenes where he gazes at the stars looks unreal (too many stars) and you could tell some of them were laid over top another field of stars.

1080668,4,6305810109,"This film was really all about family, what it means (or should mean) and what you should be willing to do to get it back.  Alvin sets out to visit his estanged brother over 300 miles away on a lawnmower - the only vehicle he can drive - taking him over a month to cover the distance.
I suppose he wanted to get there his own way, and perhaps to show his brother just how much making up meant to him.  It would be very easy to hop on a bus and make an effort, but that wouldn't exactly require 100% commitment, would it?  Alvin is obviously out to prove something, to his brother, to himself, and to the world.
Along the way he meets various people.  He helps some, is helped by others, and simply reminisces with yet more.  As he goes along, you get to know him as a gentle, kind old man, with watery eyes and a penchant for wieners.  Richard Farnsworth does a great job in this role, and is very convincing.  Sissy Spacek is also good , she plays a slightly retarded and troubled daughter.
You can tell that this is a true story from the way Alvin's quest to visit his brother has a false start.  That kind of thing only happens in real life, if this was a script, a writer would have smoothed that kink out right from the start.
Lynch, the Director, does a good job in portraying the vast expanse of the distance that Alvin has to cover, but I thought he could have done better at giving an indication of how long the journey took.  There were lots of shots of Alvin chugging along, but you didn't know if they were all in the same day or week or month or what - thus the dropped star.
Overall, this is a very nice film, one for a cold night in, relaxing by the fire.",970444800,3,1670,4.113846153846154

1080712,5,6305810109,"A lot of people have David Lynch pegged as a filmmaker obsessed with darkness, depravity, grotesquerie, perversion and weirdness for its own sake.  Not to sound too ....., but these people are immune to visual poetry and should stick with Adam Sandler or Schwarzeneggar movies.  Yes, there are some elements of all of the above in Lynch's work, but always too there is a sense of humanity, a certain skewed grace.  With The Straight Story, the spirituality that has always been present in Lynch's films comes more prominently to the fore than it ever has before (with the possible exception of The Elephant Man).  The Straight Story lacks much in the way of outright strangeness in terms of content, but the general oddness of Lynch's style, his unique sense of composition and editing rhythms, his whole way of seeing, is very much in evidence here.  Based on the true story of Alvin Straight, an old man who made a 300-mile journey by riding mower to see his estranged brother, The Straight Story is so, well, straightforward and simple that it achieves a kind of purity.  By all accounts, on a personal level Lynch is an unusually warm, sweet guy and I can believe it. This film couldn't have been made by someone who wasn't a fundamentally clear-eyed, good man, and the deep-down decency of Straight is accordingly made palpable by the deep-down decency of the director.  When Alvin finally meets up with his ailing brother, the film ends with an exchange between the two that is so understated and eloquent that it's almost startling in its power.  Eschewing any trace of cheesey sentimentality, Lynch makes a statement about the importance of love and forgiveness that even the most hardened cynic would be moved by.  If you missed this in the theater, the widescreen DVD is the only way to go.  Don't miss this remarkable film.",969494400,2,1834,4.7936507936507935

Deviating from his usual style of directing, Lynch provides a touching and sometimes tearful insight into the life of Alvin Straight, a man who rode a lawnmower across several states in order to visit his sick brother one last time.  Touching at the heartstring as you see how the suffering endured by Alvin in order to see his brother affects him, strongly recommended to those people who usually find Lynch's work overwhelming This will bring a sigh as you watch Alvin meet strangers along the way and how each meeting can affect a person in one way or another, always determined and forthright in his mission Alvin will show you what it is like to be old and honourable.

1080714,5,6305810109,"The Straight Story is an unexpected movie from David Lynch's hands. When I first saw this in a local cinema I was mesmerized by the movie's beautiful imagery, music and storytelling.
This movie tells the true story of Alvin Straight, an old man with a bad hip. When he hears his brother, whom he hasn't spoken to in years due to some argument, has had a seizure he feels he has to see him, to once again sit side-by-side and look at the stars. As he has no means of transportation and refuses to be driven or brought, he takes his '66 lawnmower and starts to drive it from Iowa to Wisconsin.
On his journey he meets a number of strangers with whom he shares experiences and wisdom through honest, personal and simple stories. This is beautifully depicted by Richard Farnsworth's role as Alvin who got an Acadamy Award(r) nomination for his performance.
Alvin's journey, this old man's character, his encounters with the strangers he meets, the music and the unrushedness of the movie impressed me so much I went to see it three times in a row. Because the movie is not a roller-coaster ride, but takes its time to let everything sink in you finally have to time to really appreciate every aspect of it.
Allthough this movie hasn't become a major block-buster, I know nobody who has seen it who hasn't also seen it twice. Definately one of the better movies of '99.

1080715,5,6305810109,"This film is probably one of the warmest and heartbreaking films of the year and it is all because of David Lynch and Richard Farnsworth. Unlike your typical Hollywood movie, David Lynch is able to work in the multitude of charachters in ""The Straight Story"" in a very natural and unpretentious way. The beauty of the picture is the way in which Alvin Straight (Farnsworth) is able to touch all the people he meets as he travels from Iowa to Wisconsin on his tractor to meet his ailing brother. The ending, which may leave the typical moviegoer scrathching his head and asking ""so what happens?"", is brilliant in how the expressions on the brothers' faces explain how they feel; and there is no need for a long drawn out speech that screams for the Academy's attention.
This film, in essence is about getting old and how aging has its benefits as well as its tragedies; how anger and resentment of family and friends is really not worth it in the end.  Richard Farnsworth does a brilliant job that not many actors could have done. The wisdom he seems to have just by staring at him is astonishing. The second best line in the movie is when a young man asked him, ""What is the worst thing about getting old?"" and Alvin stares at him and says quietly, ""Remembering when you were young."" The best line, of course is the last sentence of the movie which makes you feel happy as well as sad inside.
David Lynch did a beautiful job in making the cornfields of the midwest seem amazingly scenic; trust me, I have been through Iowa and it is not as gorgeous as he made it out to be. The soundtrack goes perfect with the movie also. And I did not even mention Sissy Spacek, who plays Alvin's daughter and she does a great job as well as the rest of the cast in playing characters touched by Alvin and his mission.
What makes a movie a classic or a great film is that after you watch it, you sit there and think about it and have discussions with your friends about it. This movie did that to me, and I have been reccommending it to all my friends. But I must warn you, you also have to be in the right mood for it, and it might be best if you either watched it alone or with only a couple of other people. It is a must see for anyone.",969408000,3,2225,4.2725118483412325

Lynch lets the story  unfold slowly and some may be put off by the lazy pace.  ""Why isn't  anything happening?"" was a frequent complaint I heard.  I found the  pace a welcome change from the MTV-style editing that is so prevelant.  Straight Stories'  slower style is a perfect parallel for the mower's crawl  across Midwest America.  Lynch lingers on shots and fully develops his  protagonist while also tossing in some strong supporting characters.  Farnsworth should have won an Oscar for his multi-layered performance.  The  ending is a bit weak after such a long build-up, but there is a certain  poetry in the last shot.

David Lynch, who made his debut into filmaking with the disturbing  and strange ""Eraserhead"", has always been labled as an auteur of  the strange and surreal.  He came closest to commercial success with the  Academy Award nominated ""Elephant Man"" and ""Blue  Velvet"", but no film he's ever made has been able to tap into the  sensibilities of middle-America.  ""Straight Story"" is that movie.  Departing from the surreal images we've come to expect in a David Lynch  film, he directs this moving story about a man's journey to visit his  ailing brother in a ""Straight"" manner.  Instead of focusing the  camera on disturbing images of evil lurking within human nature, Lynch  gives us beautiful shots of the roadways of middle-America and the pastures  and fields that line these highways.  Along the way, Richard Farnsworth's  character (in an Oscar-nominated performance) meets different people who,  like him, are on a journey.  As the movie proceeds, we come to learn that  the real journey is that of Farnsworth's character which is revealed in  pieces throughout the film as he shares his life's regrets, sorrows, and  pains.  Lynch takes his time with this film, slowly unraveling the motives  of the main character.  Suffice to say it's not for the Micheal Bay crowd.  Be patient.  You will be digesting this movie long after viewing.  Enhancing this beautiful film is stunning cinematography and a wonderful  score featuring a violin solo.  Yes, a violin.

The film moves slowly, but deliberately, as Lynch  demonstrates the power of silence. Angelo Badalamenti's score complements  the film perfectly.  The cinematography is unusual but is never  distracting. The character development is outstanding, and the biggest  surprise of all: the dialog is very strong and very intelligent.

Yeah, Mr. Disney, we've got David Lynch on the phone - yeah the same guy who did ""Blue Velvet"" and ""Wid at Heart"" and  ""Lost Highway"" - yep, and he wants to do a Disney film - no, not  through Touchstone or anything, he definitely wants the Disney logo on the  film.  Mmm-hmm.  No, nothing like that, he wants it to be a family film,  but not for kids specifically.  In fact, it's an old guy riding a lawnmower  across the Midwest, so it's actually not for kids at all....Hello?
The  Straight Story features Richard Farnsworth on his riding mower (cuz he  can't drive no more) riding to see his ailing brother a couple hundred  miles away whom he hasn't seen since having a falling out with him years  ago.  Along the way he stops in towns, chats with folks, and acts as a sort  of Midwestern Messiah by giving wisdom and advice to folks who need it.  The whole thing basically boils down to a character study of Farnsworth's  character, and he does carry the whole darn thing - and well.

""The Straight Story,"" directed by David Lynch, recounts the story of Alvin  (Richard Farnsworth), who set out to see his brother, Lyle (Harry Dean  Stanton), upon hearing of his stroke.  Alvin is prevented from driving  because of poor eyesight, and he won't take a bus because he doesn't trust  another's driving.  A widower who lives with his daughter, Rose (Sissy  Spacek), Alvin, not a man of means, resorts to the only way he knows how,  to get to Lyle.  He needs to put the bad blood behind them before it's too  late; an estrangement born of ""anger and pride.""  Hauling a make-shift  trailer, and with three five-gallon cans of gas and a cooler full of hot  dogs, Alvin sets out, alone and determined, on his lawn mower.  Now in the  twilight of his life, having learned to ""separate the wheat from the  chaff,"" the trip affords Alvin plenty of time to reflect on his life, and  steels him in his quest to do what he feels he has to do. Along the way he  befriends and is befriended by the strangers he encounters; a testimony to  the bountifulness of the human spirit.  When a young man asks him what the  worst thing is about being old, he replies, ""Remembering when you were  young.""  Richard Farnsworth gives the performance of a lifetime as  Alvin, this stubborn, prideful man, who has learned humility with age, and  you can see the wisdom of his years in his eyes.  Farnsworth connects with  the audience from the beginning, aptly conveying the yearning of a soul in  need of atonement, and the determination of the man to effect his amends.  Sissy Spacek, also, gives a terrifically nuanced performance as Rose, the  ""slow"" daughter who lives daily with demons of her own.  That the members  of the Academy failed to nominate her for best-supporting actress for her  work here is nothing short of criminal; her Rose is a beautiful piece of  work.  David Lynch, as well, has done a remarkable job of bringing Alvin's  story to the screen.  He has woven a rich visual and emotional tapestry,  all poignantly delivered with a gentle hand.  Beautifully photographed, the  lush vistas of the Midwest reflect Alvin's state of mind, underscoring the  deeper meanings of what is really a spiritual journey, during which the  past mingles with the present.  Lynch has taken a wistful, almost poetic  approach throughout, which, together with the story is reminiscent of  Ingmar Bergman's ""Wild Strawberries.""  The scene in which Alvin finally  meets up with Lyle is perfectly and touchingly executed, and is one of the  most memorable scenes in the movie.  The supporting cast includes  James Cada (Danny), Everett McGill (Tom), Barbara E. Robertson (Deer  Woman), John Farley (Thorvald), and Kevin P. Farley (Harold).  With an  artistic hand, Lynch has crafted an unforgettable film.  ""The Straight  Story"" is Alvin's story, but the journey belongs to us; a reminder of what  is really important in life, and the needs we all share at one time or  another.  It's an entertaining movie that will touch you and make you  think, as well; and as far as I'm concerned, that's about as good as it  gets.",962668800,129,3400,4.714041095890411

I am happy to say that if the movie is related to what I  thought of David Lynch before, it was all in a good way.  It's not like  reading some unusual tabloid - but rather he knows how to create tension,  suspense, and mystery in a basically serene land.  From the beginning,  everything is defamiliarized - we don't understand much, and it gives us  the story slowly, letting us come to a natural understanding of the people  rather than forcing a lot of story down our throat.

The human side of  the story - I don't want to ruin it for you, but I will share that this was  one of those few movies I see each year that made me shed more than a few  tears.

The movie is more than mere concept, however.  It's a quiet celebration of  rural provincial life in the midwest, part meditation, part a series of  Americana koans.  The movie does not have a ""movie of the week""  feel at all, nor is it afflicted by Lynch-inspired kitsch or satire.  Instead, the movie uses spaces of silence to drive the plot, much as did  Tender Mercies, only this film is much less sentimental.  The film is a  series of beautifully realized small moments, which works through slow  realization of its themes--only My Dinner with Andre has succeeded in  bringing the tiny moments to life as well as this movie.  Richard  Farnsworth's performance is quite creditable, even though his character  must exhibit an almost mythic depth of wisdom and pain.  Somehow the viewer  always believes in Alvin Straight and his curious tractor quest to see a  sick relative.  Sissy Spacek is a marvel in support--I've missed seeing her  in roles this nicely turned out.  The Straight Story is patient,  slow-building and anecdotal.  Its pace may be too slow for kids.  That's  okay--this is  a very adult film, rating notwithstanding. The roving  camera--stars fading in and out, brush-by treelines, lingering moments in  campfire flames--adds to the ethereal atmosphere that permeates this movie.  The soundtrack is ambiant, meditative, but we never lose sight that our  protagonist is riding a small tractor past rural field and ordinary people.  The Straight Story will not capture your heart, or bring you to the edge  of your chair, but it may give you a quiet moment of thought, and not many  films can do that anymore.",960854400,2,1839,4.983443708609271

This movie shimmers with a fountain of pent-up,  heart-felt, but tragically unspoken human emotions. Along the way, we also  get to know and appreciate his emotionally challenged daughter, played well  by Sissy Spacek. But this trip is really a Richard Farnsworth bravura  one-man show.  And what a show it is!
We trip the light fantastic with  him as he sets out to see a long-lost brother at the end of life, and we  get to share in his ersatz adventures with an eclectic cast of all  too-ordinary yet extraordinarily beautiful losers he encounters along the  way.  Of course, his trip on the John Deere is a trip toward himself and  toward discovering a lot of things he needs to know to complete his life's  journey. This is adult entertainment for the whole family, because it has  such a wonderful ring of truth and integrity hovering over it, and an  insight about life that lingers even after it's over.  Every time I think  about Alvin Straight being either nave enough or ballsy enough to set out  on this amazing journey it brings an involuntary smile to my face. He sure  wasn't nave. I think you'll like it too.",960595200,43,1442,4.620553359683795
1080845,5,6305810109,"With 'The Straight Story' David Lynch has weaved together a subtle, fascinating story about age, regret, and family.  The tale is of Alvin Straight, a 73 year old man who has seen most of what life has to dish out  and learns that his brother suffered a stroke.  With bad eyes and no  license, he sets out on a journey on a riding lawnmower to see his brother,  who he hasn't spoken to in ten years.
What I loved most about this movie  is the simplicity; of the story, the characters, the filming.  Yet within  that classic style is a movie that is incredibly moving.  The stories that  Alvin has to tell about his life are saddening, touching, and almost  frightening.  He talks about being old, about fighting in World War II, and  about his regrets of not speaking to his brother.  He runs into quite a few  people along the way who help him out, and their stories contribute to a  beautifully crafted script.
Richard Farnsworth is convincing in the  role of Alvin.  His abilities are most especially outlined in the sad tone  of his voice, and the look of regret and hope in his eyes.  It is rare that  I have grown to respect and adore a character so much.  David Lynch's  direction is not dark or creepy like his other works, but carefully and  nicely photographed in great harmony with the script.  The cinematography  is smoothe, and the extended takes prove his abilities as a director and  the actors abilities as well.
This film is done in a classic manner, and  the results are moving in a rare way.  I sincerely hopes this film  eventually gets the recognition it deserves.",959817600,66,1586,4.501766784452297
1080846,4,6305810109,"If you didn't know from the opening credits, you might very well have been hard-pressed to guess that David Lynch directed this movie.  Yes, ""Big Ed"" from Twin Peaks does turn up in one scene, as does Harry Dean  Stanton, who was also in Wild at Heart. But there aren't too many familiar  Lynchian faces, and there is none of the surrealistic, kinky imagery and  over-the-top outrageousness he has become known for.  The movie's extremely  leisurely pace is a bit frustrating for a while, but eventually you kind of  settle down and go along for the one-of-a-kind ride with Alvin Straight.  Richard Farnsworth's honest, direct, performance draws you in, and he  refrains from either going over the top or being expressionlessly wooden,  traps Lynch actors often fall into. He and Sissy Spacek fully and  unsentimentally realize their flawed, limited, but human characters, and  provide the main reasons for watching the film. The lovely cinematography  and fine score also deserve praise--Lynch films are always fine in those  categories, whatever else their flaws, due to the exceptional skills of  Freddie Francis and Angelo Badamente. The ending is a guaranteed  tearjerker, but not in a cheap, hokey, manipulative way--you feel you know  the Farnsworth character, and you're moved when you see his deep emotion.  Let's hope Lynch makes more movies like this in the future--sincere,  unsentimental looks at how life is really lived in America, and how  beautiful and sad it can be.",959644800,2,1484,5.104166666666667
1080847,5,6305810109,"I took my 77 year-old father to see this movie in March. We absolutely loved it. So often the elderly are portrayed as helpless and weak in today's movies. Not so in this movie. Straight Story was a tale of a  wonderfully simple man doing the right thing and helping others along the  way. I promise, it will touch you. I hope the price of this video drops  soon because I think it would be a great gift for my dad on Father's Day.  May be a little slow for children, wonderful scenery.",959558400,2,486,4.193548387096774
1080848,5,6305810109,This is the most genuine and unpretentious film to come along in years. Lynch has broken new ground with The Straight Story. Expect to see many filmmakers in the future borrowing from its unobtrusive style.,959472000,,206,4.914285714285715
1080849,2,6305810109,"I tried to watch The Straight Story last night, but had to give up after a while because Sissy Spacek was driving me up the wall. What an overdone, annoying performance. But I'm going to give it another try tonight, because Richard Farnsworth is so good. Also, I'm encouraged by the fact that one viewer who's seen it all the way through said that Spacek is out of the movie after the first half hour. By the way, another viewer stated that this was Farnsworth's first lead role. Doesn't anyone remember 1982's The Grey Fox? A terrific movie!",959385600,2,542,4.540816326530612

""Tenderness can be just as abstract as insanity,"" Lynch  said in regards to this film.  And he proves it.  Based on a true story,  the viewer learns about Alvin Straight through the people he meets.  Richard Farnsworth gained an Oscar nominee, but the entire cast should have  been included.  Through subtle performances and story-telling, ""The  Straight Story"" grabs your heart.  Doesn't let go, even after the  credits.  Trust me.  Go into this film without reading the other reviews  that give away the plot you can witness yourself.  Invest two hours well  spent.",959385600,,709,4.974137931034483
1080851,3,6305810109,"Avid filmgoers have been shocked that David Lynch directed this G-rated Disney movie  (DAVID LYNCH!), but those who pay close attention while watching it will notice a few Lynchian send-ups of Americana, albeit muted.  The director strives for compassion -- I think he mostly succeeds -- but  he still can't quite resist chuckling at some of the folks he puts in his  movie.  (For instance, Farnsworth blowing apart his first lawnmower with a  shotgun might be just a bit overdetermined.)  There isn't the full respect  and acceptance of rural America that one finds, wondrously, in Robert  Duvall's  *The Apostle*.
That small unpleasantness over with, let me  praise the virtues of  *The Straight Story*.  The movie is a welcome  reminder for all of us to SLOW DOWN.  Lynch forces us to travel at Alvin  Straight's pace, which at first is funny . . . and soon provides  opportunities for some inner reflection  (entirely possible while watching  a film).  And, of course, the scenery is beautiful -- Lynch doesn't make a  pretensious point of that, he merely presents it.  The story itself is  about an old patriarch  (Richard Farnsworth)  who wishes to make amends  with his stroke-afflicted brother.  Without a proper driver's license, he  must drive the 370 or so miles on a lawnmower, with a small camper hitched  to the back.  Naturally, it's based on a true story.
It's a demanding  role for Richard Farnsworth  (FAR FAR more demanding than Kevin Spacey's  larking about in  *American Beauty*), who handles it superbly.  This guy  pops up in movies every once in a while, and one is always astonished at  his dominating screen presence.  But, perhaps even more astonishing is  Sissy Spacek's lamentably brief work in this movie.  Lynch makes a HUGE  error by dropping her after 30 minutes.  Her portrayal of Alvin's daughter  is shockingly one-of-a-kind -- you'll never see anything quite like it in a  film again.  But that's what great actors do, and Spacek's one of our  best.
I recommend  *The Straight Story*.  It's not a masterpiece, but it  doesn't strive for greatness, anyway.  It just does its job . . .  beautifully.",958953600,6,2134,4.903682719546742

1080919,5,6305810109,"Alot of people thought that just because this Lynch gem isn't twisted meant that it wasn't good. Actually, it is more enjoyable because of it's mainstream plot (no offense to Twin Peaks, I have a place in my heart for  you to). Richard Farnsworth (Oscar nomination well deserved) portrays Alvin  Straight, a man who travels on his lawnmower to visit his sick brother. It  is funny, adventurous, and highly dramatic. But it's the little things  (Alvin picks up his hat) that brings on the tears.",958435200,,494,4.776470588235294
1080920,5,6305810109,"Richard Farnsworth has been acting 63 years.  That's a long time as a supporting and character actor.  He gets his big opportunity to be a leading man at age 79 and he nails it.  Farnsworth plays Alvin Straight who  takes a cross country odyssey on a riding mower to see his ailing brother  with whom he has not spoken in ten years.
This is a warm and touching  story that takes its time unfolding.  Alvin's journey is a journey for the  viewer as well. It is an excellent character study of a proud and  cantankerous old man who is determined to cling to his self sufficiency and  dignity and for whom failure is not an option.  It reminds us that behind  the eyes of those old faces that we so often push aside, there are real  people with strong principles, wisdom, experience and emotions worth far  more than the value we place on them.
Director David Lynch is to be  commended for transcending his own usually bizarre mold in this film.  Though his pacing is decidedly slow, so is the lawnmower, so it is  appropriate.  The prelude to Alvin's getting on the road was particularly  deliberate and might have been condensed a bit, but once on the road the  pacing was perfectly adapted to the story.  The locations were terrific,  with numerous aerial shots of our beautiful heartland.  The story was  presented with sensitivity and simplicity without a lot of visual  gimmickry.  It's good to see a film where the story and not the filmmaking  is the point.
Farnsworth gives the performance of his career.  His  portrayal makes Alvin determined and stubborn, but in a way that is lovable  and charismatic.  His ability to distill complex emotions into simple  expressions was masterful.
My only real criticism was that Sissy Spacek  gave what I thought was a sub-par performance for her.  I thought she  overdid the speech impediment to the point where it hindered the  dialogue.
This is an absorbing and wonderful human interest story.  I  rated it a 9/10.  For those looking for fast paced action, this is not your  movie.  For everyone else, see it soon and enjoy its simple enchantment.",958435200,2,2095,4.676795580110498
1080921,5,6305810109,"So, how do you sell a film about an old guy who makes a two hundred and  fifty mile trek on a lawn mower tractor to an action-addicted, MTV-jaded  public? Certainly not overnight. David Lynch again breaks the rules and  gives us a ""road movie"" like no other. ""The Straight  Story"" did only minimal business during its initial theatrical run but  make no mistake, this strangely mesmerizing film is built for the long  haul. The Lynch touch is undeniable, yet beautifully restrained, bestowing  the film with a life-like, life-giving idiosyncracy that glows with feeling  and depth. Its unhurried, thoughtful pace seems almost like a remedy for  our times. Spacek's role as the slow daughter who speaks in halting,  awkward speech rhythms is a masterstroke of character work, while  Farnsworth gives the signature performance of his career. In years to come,  ""The Straight Story"" will grow into a time-honored classic as the  public discovers and takes this unique, gentle film into its heart. Capra  smiled down on this one.",958262400,3,1025,5.023809523809524
1080922,5,6305810109,"Character actor Richard Farnsworth earned an Oscar Nomination for Best Supporting Actor in 1978 for his work in COMES A HORSEMAN.  His current performance as Alvin Straight in a magical, lyrical and lovely film, THE  STRAIGHT STORY, is even more extraordinary.  His face is a map of a  lifetime and is so incredibly expressive that, like Garbo, one almost does  not need dialogue to know what he's thinking and feeling. This is a film  about decent people being decent to each other - that's a rarity, eh?  I've seen just over half of the 35 Oscar nominated films from 1999 and only  this and MUSIC OF THE HEART contain no violence - what a comment on our  film world.  Alvin Straight sets out to see a brother who may or may not  have survived a stroke - to end a feud and set the record as straight as  his name.  He does this on a John Deere tractor, traveling from Iowa to  Wisconsin, since his age precludes an active driver's license.  Along the  way he meets a number of people, including himself, and leaves a bit of  wisdom, honesty and perspective in all the lives he touches.  Sissy Spacek  is also exceptional as his developmentally delayed adult daughter - she  deserved an Oscar nom in support for her performance here.  This is a  beautiful film.

I cannot remember a film experience I have had that  left me feeling so utterly relaxed and satisfied at the same time. Sit  back, turn off the lights and let this film take you into a different state  of mind. Farnsworth's performance is as perfect as any screen role in  years. The Oscar deserved to be bestowed on him for a performance that was  not acting at all. He IS Alvin Straight, quite simply. The music by Angelo  Badalamenti (who is normally a bit eccentric in his musical scores) is  sublime. This is filmmaking at its best. David Lynch has found his niche'.

I am sure the award winner was ok but Farnsworth was worth a 1000 words as  the main character.  This was a STELLER PERFORMANCE IN THE MAGNETUDE OF THE  GREAT ACTORS OF ALL TIMES.  I compare it to Burton's Hamelet,Redford's  Horse Whispers,Brando's On The Waterfront and Don Juan, Monty Wooley's The  Man Who Came To Diner, Grant's Bring up Baby. If you have not seen it watch  it. If you have watch it again.

1080926,5,6305810109,"In the first parts of the movie, when Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) is driving down the road on his riding lawnmower, it was all I could do not to speed up the VCR!  I kept thinking - ""Good grief man, get in a  car!"" The slow pace was almost uncomfortable to watch, but then it  really hit me - he's not going too slow - everyone else is just moving too  fast.
And indeed we are.
And at first I pondered the question - why  is this good and decent old man having to endure this long trip? His  motives are pure and right. Why wasn't there an easier path for him?
But  as the movie progressed, I saw that the long trip brought him many  blessings. And his presence brought a blessing to everyone he met. His own  pain over a broken relationship with his brother enabled him to help others  find healing in their own lives.
Maybe the trip wasn't as much for Alvin  as it was for the people he met and helped along the way.
What a  wonderful afterthought to ponder! Who received the greater  benefit!
Mother Theresa once said that maybe we can't do a great big  wonderful thing, but we can all do many little wonderful things. (my  paraphrase)
This movie emphasized that lovely truth. At first glance,  this old man looked like a pretty unimportant character on the stage of  life, but in terms of the wonderful things he did for others, his life was  of immeasurable worth.
This movie is too good to rent. I'm buying copies  for me and as many family members as possible.
What a treasure. Best  movie of 1999 - without a moment's doubt.
And a last note - I hadn't  heard one word about this flick until I saw info about it posted at a  Christian website.
