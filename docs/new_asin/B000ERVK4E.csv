8113769,1,B000ERVK4E,"So many conspiracies, new interpretations, and formerly unknown players - too much to absorb at one sitting, and probably too unlikely to accept even with many viewings. National Geographic did the best job they could, but this was a lost cause from the 'get-go.'",1438473600,,263,5.0
8113770,5,B000ERVK4E,The material was informative and interesting. I am now considering attending a De Vinci tour to experience the knowledge I have gained.,1374019200,,135,5.181818181818182

8113772,2,B000ERVK4E,"Documentary is biased in favor of people who favor Dan Brown's views. Equal time is not afforded to bibilical authorities, historians and other experts. Although, ultimately the outcome refutes Dan Brown's claims, it does so with too much time given to non-authoritative ""experts"" and a disgruntled former Opus Dei member.

Recommend Tony Robinsons, ""The Real DaVinci Code"" It does a much better job of balancing the views of true experts with those that are busy getting rich from perpetuating myths, legends and distortions.",1170547200,6,526,5.337349397590361
8113773,4,B000ERVK4E,"I bought this DVD and I was not disappointed.  I give it a 4 only because there wasn't complete balance in all of the ""experts"".  Particularly the Mary Magdelene expert.  Not that it really mattered, but there was now counterpoint to her beliefs that ""Jesus used to kiss Mary on the mouth, much to the Disciples chagrin"".

For those who claim bias, I would slightly disagree.  Dan Brown has said that his book was fiction.  So for National Geographic to create a documentary investigating something that was ficticious from the start is admirable.  Some Amazon reviewers call this DVD biased and even believe that the Catholic Church funded the DVD.

I honestly beg to differ.  The Da Vinci Code is a fanciful story.  So for National Geographic to take the bait and create this DVD, gives Dan Brown more exposure.  If anything, this DVD portrays the early Catholic Church as misogynous with their negative and false depiction of Mary Magdelene.  The debunking of The Priory of Sion with its exclusive membership is comical as well.  But they had to research it as it was derived from the book.

The DVD Bonus features are pretty good as well.  They give you a little True/False quiz at the end.

Man will continue to search for proof.  However, those who believe in God (and have a relationship with him), need not apply empirical evidence or follow logical conclusions to prove or disprove the Da Vinci Code.  Even if the Da Vinci Code was completely true (which it isn't), that wouldn't change my faith or belief.  This is something that the DVD touched on.  It is Christ's message that is important, not necessarily His social life.",1152748800,19,1635,4.7304964539007095
8113774,1,B000ERVK4E,"When I purchased this DVD, I was hoping to get the complete picture- an unbiased presentation. From scratch I could sense what was to come. Bad presentation coupled with one sided propaganda forms the crux of this DVD. It is not well researched and very important issues have been completely omitted. What little was discussed appeared to be very tainted.

I definitely did not expect National Geographic to come up with this kind of a DVD. I will definitely think TEN times before I purchase anything from them. Maybe they should just stick to wildlife/geography/ecology and leave history/religion/spirituality alone.",1149984000,7,618,5.242424242424242
8113775,1,B000ERVK4E,"The content of the DVD ""National Geographic - Is It Real? Da Vinci's Code"" appears to be very badly researched. Assumptions made by National Geographic are presented to the viewer as facts. Conclusions drawn are in general not supported with plausible evidence. The views projected are bias and I wouldn't be surprised if the Catholic Church was the main sponsor of this movie. All in all a highly disappointing DVD.",1149292800,15,416,4.957142857142857
