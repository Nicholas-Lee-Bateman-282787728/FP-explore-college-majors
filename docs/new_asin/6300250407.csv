275961,5,6300250407,"In the past 28 years of my life I think I can safely say that this is the greatest, most beautiful, and the most magnificent muppet movie ever made in the history of mankind. Beautiful acting, singing, and dancing and just brings you joy and tears of joy especially the infinitely grand wedding scene. I think throughout the course of my lifetime I have seen this particular muppet movie about 3500 times. My mama and papa bought me the VHS back in 93 and the DVD in 2002 and love them and cherish them forever. My second favorite Muppet movie is The Great Muppet Caper which is infinitely fabulous too but Muppets Take Manhattan wins the gold. Muppet Caper I've seen 3000 times , but this Muppets Take Manhattan i've seen the most-maybe even 4000 times!!!",1460073600,5,756,4.5661764705882355

But, despite the Amazon listing saying the format is 1.85:1, that only refers to Muppets Take Manhattan, which is wide and full screen.

276253,4,6300250407,"It's amazing how you hear songs you haven't heard in decades.  Then after a few opening notes the whole song comes back to you and you find yourself singing along with the film.  That's what this movie is.  After just a few moments in the opening scene the songs were all coming back.  Even the little ones laughed and sang along after a few bars.

This is one of those rare funny movies where there aren't any scary parts for little ones and there's no needless use of foul language or sexuality.  So grab the movie and introduce a new generation to the Muppets

Of note in this film: Jim Henson had a plethora of celebrities make cameo appearances and in this film we're first introduced to what would later become the ""Muppet Babies.""",1389398400,,737,4.455223880597015

276536,4,6300250407,"Kermit and Miss Piggie are essentially Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland in one of those 1930s movies where at some point they shout ""Let's put on a show!"" It's got the usual cliches about breaking into Broadway, but then this is the Muppets, after all. Nothing is quite the way it would otherwise be in a movie like this, however corny. If nothing else, you can have fun watching for the cameo appearances of Liza Manelli, Art Carney, Joan Rivers, Brooke Shields and Mayor Koch. There are others listed in the credits as cameos, but I didn't recognize their names. And of course other muppets you know show up here and there. Statler and Waldorf, certainly. And in the grand finale wedding scene (Piggy cleverly substitutes a real preacher for Gonzo who was to have played the role), all the muppets, including those on Sesame Street, are guests at the wedding.

As is typical of muppets, they make good use of interactions with humans, especially an immigrant named Pete who runs a coffee shop (a rat named Rizzo, an inside joke for Philadelphians, is the waiter), and his charming daughter who wants to be a fashion designer. Convenient, as she makes some outrageous costumes for Kermit. And of course raises Piggy's always touchy jealousy. Rizzo asks customer Brooke Shields how she feels about inter-species dating, and she says, ""Well, I've dated some real rats, if that's what you mean.""

One aspect takes some getting used to, however. People on the streets and in the restaurants and offices seem to take the muppets for granted, as if they were more-or-less human, although acknowledging their species when relevant to the plot. This confirms my impression that inter-species relations has always been used as a metaphor for inter-racial and inter-religious relations among humans. Nobody seems to mind that Camilla the chicken is in love with Gonzo the . . . just what species IS Gonzo, anyway?

I got lots of laughs out of the movie, but it is clearly meant for kids and their parents, or even their grandparents, and not to be taken very seriously. All muppets fans will appreciate it, I'm sure.",1336867200,,2105,4.825484764542936

276561,5,6300250407,"SPOILERS FOLLOW

""The Muppets Take Manhattan""  is undoubtedly a classic comedy starring Jim Henson's witty creations.  The Muppets graduate college and are preparing to shop their new musical ""Manhattan Melodies"" to Broadway.  With a perfect satirical stroke, they find that success in The Big Apple often does not come easily.

Upon experiencing decisive setbacks, Kermit the Frog(voiced by Mr. Henson), and the gang decide to split up, with the idea that if the show finds a backer, they will reunite to put it on.  The song that plays as they say both collective and individual farewells is a textured tearjerker.  ""Saying Goodbye"" is a tremendous song, a thematic dissection of sad emotions which often accompany a momentous and/or painful parting.  The meat of the movie follows Kermit as he works in a cafe and creatively keeps ""Manhattan Melodies"" publicity alive.

Muppet films are often known for their celebrity cameo appearances, and this one is loaded with stars.  Dabney Coleman plays an underhanded Broadway producer.  Joan Rivers works at a cosmetics counter with Miss Piggy.  Gregory Hines pops up as a skater who is a brief witness to a spat between Kermit and Miss Piggy.

Jim Henson's professional legacy has always been investing puppets with sophisticated human emotion and creatively freeing them from the strings that adorned puppet shows of an earlier generation. ""The Muppets Take Manhattan"" stands as a lasting tribute to the durability of Mr. Henson's legacy, and also his collaboration with Frank Oz.  Mr. Oz voices Miss Piggy, as well as several other Muppets in the film, and directs it.  This movie is very highly recommended.  Many people who grew up with it love it, and its warmth, intelligence and humor make it easily enjoyable to newer generations.",1328745600,2,1785,5.103448275862069

276609,2,6300250407,"I'll be the first to jump in front of a moving truck to ward off Muppet slander, but honestly I don't see how this is a worthwhile purchase.  I love this movie, the great music, perfectly timed gags, what's not to enjoy?  I'm not writing a review based on the content of the movie, but rather the lack of care this barely passable conversion/ 'upgrade' Sony has given us.

What a disappointment. We've all been waiting hungrily for the Season 4 of the Muppet show that's been dangled in front of us so many times, but then they push this (and Muppets from Space) out the door without any care to the consumer. Just repackaged on a bluray disc.

If you own 'Muppets Take Manhattan' on DVD, then you've got everything this has but with less advertisements that come with BluRay Live.  Even down to the Jim Henson interview pieces, nothing on this is any different than the DVD version and that's half the price.  No new Pepe interviews, just a reprint but on slightly nicer material. Granted, with Disney owning the Muppet franchise and the release of the new film, why wouldn't it have been quick and painless to add a few more worthwhile featurettes onto this?  Fans can only wonder.

The quality is roughly the same with probably some slight adjustments but I don't believe it's remastered in the sense of seeing a night and day difference in the overall video or audio quality.

276613,3,6300250407,"Since I had never seen any of the Muppet movies, my fiance insisted that I watch this one.  I honestly didn't really see the charm of it, but he sure seemed to enjoy it.

The Muppets (all of them) have just graduated college and have to decide what to do with their lives.  They decide to take a variety show they'd been performing at the college and try to get on Broadway with it.  Once in New York though they can't find someone to take them on.  Running out of money and starting to get on each others nerves, they separate to go find jobs (and some of them turn out to be quite unusual) while Kermit stays behind in New York working as a dishwasher and by night looking for someone to produce their show.  He finally finds someone, but gets hit by a car on the way back to his friends and they have to wonder if the show will go on.

Characters:
Several voice actors including Jim Henson.

I always liked the Muppet baby characters and watching adult Muppets was a little different for me.  Kermit was still great but Piggy got on my nerves.  I also found myself not liking Ralph the Dog as much (although he's my fiance's favorite).  The human element in this film was ok but didn't really add or take anything away for me.  Animal is still the best.

For a plot it was pretty standard and while the movie was funny and quirky, I had trouble focusing my attention on it.  I do have to say that I don't think I'd go see their Broadway show considering it was all about a wedding but not that exciting or emotional (some will probably argue with me on this, but they probably like Miss Piggy).  Its a perfectly appropriate movie for children though and I'm sure they'd have a great time watching it.

The puppetry in this movie was very well done.  I was impressed to see a puppet riding a bike and several other hard tasks.  I also loved all the chicken puppets (reminds me of my chickens).  The music was ok, its sang by the Muppets of course and this is an aquired taste in music to be sure.  But the music did fit the scenes and had the ""Together Again"" song which is a favorite of many.

So in conclusion while it had its funny moments and probably appeals to a lot of people, I just found this movie average.

276614,5,6300250407,Who doesn't love the Muppets?  This movie is hilarious and gives a glimpse of NYC in the 1980's.  The NYC portrayed in this movie still stays with me to this day when I walk around the city.  Kermit is the man...well frog! Every kid needs to see this movie and they will become instant fans for life. As an added bonus they will get to see the origins of the 80's mega-cartoon The Muppet Babies. I watched it with my three year old and he is now a Muppet-Man like his old man.,1298505600,,476,4.096774193548387

276641,5,6300250407,"A catchy, toe-tapping little ditty called ""Together Again"" beckons us back into the realm of Muppetdom.  It starts off smooth and easy not unlike Kermit the Frog's banjo prelude to THE MUPPET MOVIE.  After graduating college and performing their new big show, ""Manhattan Melodies"" the Muppet gang is inspired to take their show to Broadway.

But no sooner do they arrive than tough times hit hard, and the Muppets learn that putting their show on Broadway will be much, much more difficult than they had originally thought.  Eventually, everyone's nerves are shot, and they part ways.  During this time, Kermit gets a job washing dishes in a diner (not the ideal job of someone who wants to be a Broadway star) and works harder than ever, often failing, before he can get everyone together again (just try to suppress that theme) and get the show rolling.  All throughout, there is the typical Muppet humor, hijinks, and great an memorable songs, including ""I'm Always Gonna Love You"" during a sequence which became the inspiration for the popular 80s Saturday morning cartoon, MUPPET BABIES.

I love this movie primarily because it teaches kids (or anyone who sees it) that nothing worthwhile comes free.  The Muppets had to work extra, extra hard, endure times of not getting along, and more than once being on the verge of giving up before they saw their dream become a reality.

Probably the song from MANHATTAN that means the most to me is the soft and melodic ballad ""Saying Goodbye"" which the Muppets sing in the first half of the film while parting each other's company.  This song is ingrained in my mind because I remember when I was a teenager watching ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT, they played that song and that sequence in tribute to the passing of Jim Henson.

I wish there were a remastered soundtrack of this movie available on CD.",1259193600,,1841,4.8126984126984125
276642,5,6300250407,"I was a four-year-old tot when this movie came out.  I remember watching it in the movies, but I only remember seeing a few scenes while there.  When it came to video a year later, I remember watching it over and over, grossing my family members out.  They liked it too, but it's hard to like it when one of your number is obsessing over it.  My favorite part is probably when Kermit and Jenny are jogging in Central Park and Piggy's purse gets snatched.  That sequence, leading up to the wagon ride and the Muppet Babies' song has always been so cool tome.  And, the amnesia part where Kermit thinks he's part of a marketing agency is both cute and clever.

Two of the great things about this DVD are that you have a choice of aspect ratio, both wide and full, plus a collection of nifty interviews with the late, great Jim Henson about his work and the Muppets.  Watching it sparks memories and opens up other vistas (including when you watch it in widescreen).  If you don't have it, get it.

276644,5,6300250407,"After graduating from college where their stage musical was a big hit, Kermit and the Muppet gang decide to take the play to New York to make it on Broadway! That turns out to be tougher than they thought, but Kermit never gives up and makes some wonderful new friends while pursuing his dream!

Full of Muppet magic, music, heart, and fun, not to mention the traditional, timely cameos, ""Muppets Take Manhattan"" is a must-see for anyone and everyone! If you haven't seen one of the three classic Muppet feature films made prior to the death of the great Jim Henson, you haven't seen the truly iconic Muppets and probably don't know why so many people absolutely love them! ""Muppets Take Manhattan"" is the Muppets at their best, co-existing in the ""real"" world and surviving through their love and wit, following their dreams and bringing mayhem wherever they go! This first solo directorial effort for Frank Oz is just as good as its predecessors, and the music is absolutely magical, as usual! The song ""Saying Good Bye"" will cause you to tear up, and who could forget the introduction of the Muppet Babies with the song ""I'm Gonna Always Love You""? Great stuff!

Grab this DVD while you can! It's got both widescreen and fullscreen presentations, an interview with Jim Henson (though it is unfortunately divided up without the benefit of a ""Play All"" feature), and 3 Muppetisms, plus 3 trailers, though none are for this particular film. The real reason I recommend getting this as soon as you can though is who knows how hard it will be to get in the future! With the Muppets in Disney's hands now and all the legal issues and editing this has caused in regards to Henson releases, I don't recommend putting off this purchase. It's one you won't regret it! ""Muppets Take Manhattan"" is a must own!

Also recommended are, of course, ""The Muppet Show"", ""The Great Muppet Caper"", and ""The Muppet Movie"", but also some post-Henson Muppet work: ""Muppet Christmas Carol"", ""Muppets from Space"", and ""Muppet Treasure Island"". They're not quite the same without Jim, but they're still pretty good. It's the post-Henson TV movies that have really hurt the Muppets' reputation, but here's hoping Disney can find the right way to handle the Muppets in the near future, even if they often have trouble recapturing the Disney magic as it is (and I sadly say that, being a bigger Disney fan than anything else). Let's also hope that someday, somehow, uncut versions of A Muppet Family Christmas, The Christmas Toy, and Emmet Otter's Jug-band Christmas finally get released. Releasing hacked up versions of these films should be a crime! And Disney, when are you going to give us ""The Muppets at Walt Disney World""? That Henson era classic should be a given for you guys! Further recommendations: Fraggle Rock, Sesame Street Old School, Christmas Eve on Sesame Street, Big Bird in China, Big Bird in Japan, The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland, Follow That Bird, Kermit's Swamp Years, The Storyteller, The Witches, Labyrinth, The Dark Crystal, and the original Star Wars trilogy.",1234656000,,3066,4.858508604206501

-Interview With Jim Henson
-Movie Trailers

The Muppetisms Were Very Odd and Wierd. The Interview With Jim Henson Was The Most Interesting as He Talks About How He Did Kermit's Voice, Frank Oz (Who Directed The Film), and More. The Trailers Include The Trailer For the Film, Muppets From Space, and Others.

276647,5,6300250407,"The Muppets Take Manhattan captured my attention the moment it started; and I never felt bored at all. The plot moves along at just the right pace even though, of course, some of the plot is rather predictable. Jim Henson, Frank Oz and all the rest worked so well to make this a strong Muppets movie; and they clearly succeeded. The cameos are well done and the cinematography is excellent. Some people will tell you that the transfer of this film to DVD is just average--and, unfortunately, they're right. However, it's still quite enjoyable; and the picture quality isn't as bad as all that.

When the action starts we see a college senior variety show performed by The Muppets. The editors carefully create the impression that college kids are applauding wildly after the show ends; and pretty soon our gang gets the itch to go to Manhattan and put their show (""Manhattan Melodies"") on Broadway! They go to Manhattan by bus and sleep in lockers at The Port Authority; but after several months nothing comes of their efforts and they sadly bid each other good-bye hoping that someday they will all be together once more.

Of course, the plot gets more fleshed out than just that. Kermit takes a job at a Manhattan coffee shop where he befriends Jenny (Juliana Donald) whose father Pete (Louis Zorich) owns and works the shop. Pete is a gruff guy but we see him soften up a bit when he gives jobs to rats (yeah, I know, ewww). He also gives Kermit work. Meanwhile, as his friends work their gigs and try to make their ways through life, Kermit remains in New York City, working at Pete's and trying to find a producer to put their show on Broadway.

I really like the ""retro"" feel of the Muppets' show entitled ""Manhattan Melodies."" It's not unlike the flavor of 42nd Street and similar musicals from the `30s. The flashy costumes for the puppets and the catchy, sing-a-long type ""show tunes"" work very well.

Will Kermit ever get the show to Broadway? How will Miss Piggy take it if she ever finds out her beloved Kermit is hugging Jenny, even though Kermit and Jenny are just friends? No plot spoilers here--watch the movie and find out!

The DVD comes with an interview with Jim Henson but the interview is cut up into 90 second and 2 minute segments; I agree with the reviewer who writes that this is frustrating. There are ""Muppetisms"" which are essentially three very brief, poorly done and rather zany clips of Muppet characters. You also get to choose between watching the movie in fullscreen or in widescreen.

The Muppets Take Manhattan is a creative movie with fine cameo appearances by everyone from then New York City Mayor Ed Koch to Art Carney and Brooke Shields; and that's grand. It leaves you both charmed and happy that you watched it. It appeals to children and the child inside all of us, too.",1231200000,,2815,4.6312625250501
276678,4,6300250407,"Stop living in the 70's.  This movie has the Muppet babies in it.  That gave birth to the long running cartoon.  I guess you guys were too old by then.  The first movie was a novelty, the second was not as good as Manhattan.  You hippies must have been pretty high watching those first two movies to think that Muppets take manhattan is inferior to those.  This movie is big on relationships and you guys just can't relate.

This is the last Muppet movie that the late Jim Henson did, the series returned after his death with the Muppet Christmas Carol. But also imange what would be like for the Muppets to disband, and well you have this movie, which may not be the best one they have done. The Muppet perfromers for this movie are Jim Henson, Frank Oz, Dave Goelz, Jerry Nelson, Steve Whitmire, and Richard Hunt. When the movie begins, the Muppets are perfoming in a colege theatre of thier show ""Matthan Melodies"" and they are just about to graudate for college. But while Kermit the Frog is onstage, when the show is over, the rest of the Muppets decide that thier show is good enough to take it to the next step, and that is broadway in case you have just joined us. But they then Kermit can't believe what they decided, but gets talked into it, so they head to broadway. Now they need is a producer, and looking through the ads, thier first one (Dabney Coleman) seems intersted, but wants the Muppets to pay him $300 each, I guess what he does get is they are just about flat broke, so how do they plan to get thier show on broadway? They keep trying with servel other producers, but one by one, they keep closing thier office door, which leads Kermit to get frusted, and he says that the Muppets depend on them to much. And with barely any money, they stop off at a restuarant, and while Kermit is placing an order, and having a chat with the owner/manger/etc (Louis Zorich), the rest of the Muppets decide to decide to stop depending on Kermit so much, so they they make a plan to go out and find jobs out of town, and of course Kermiet meets and becomes best friends with the owner's neiece Jenny (Juliana Donald).

He's a legend, pure and simple.  The Muppets Take Manhattan is great fun, as the gang reunites to take on Broadway and become stars, but there just seems to be a little something missing here.  Maybe it has something to do with the fact that all the players go their separate ways over the course of a big chunk of the film - I don't know.  It's still a great movie that children of all ages should enjoy, but it's not my favorite Muppet film.  Certainly, one thing in this movie's favor is the fact that, in 1984, Jim Henson was still alive and well, and his collaboration with Frank Oz makes this a vintage Muppets motion picture.
As the film opens, the Muppet gang are graduating from college, and the big show they put on for the school is such a hit that they decide to go to New York and take their show to Broadway.  It is a decision that helps keep everyone together, but even Kermit the Frog has a hard time getting any Broadway producers to sign a show featuring song and dance performed by a frog, a pig, a dog, etc.  When hope is all but lost, everyone decides to split up and live their own lives - they feel as if they have been unfair to Kermit by depending on him alone for so long.  Kermit vows to stay and sell the show, and he can't way to get the gang back together.  Luckily, Kermit has developed a friendship with a fashion design student/waitress and gets a job at a diner (which also features a funny and delightful little group of rats).  Kermit's new three-phase plan to sell the show offers a lot of comedy but doesn't exactly pan out the way he would like.  Then he has to make things right with a certain someone who has been stalking him.  In the end, of course, everything works out for the best - but not before Kermit completely disappears for the two weeks leading up to opening night.
This film boasts a number of cameo appearances by well-known personalities: Dabney Coleman, Joan Rivers, Gregory Hines, Linda Lavin, Art Carney, Elliott Gould, Liza Minnelli, Brooke Shields, and many others (including a pre-Star Trek: The Next Generation Gates McFadden).  Some extra special guests from a certain street everyone knows and loves also show up for the big finale.  As always, the Muppets themselves steal the show, and there are some really comical scenes of physical humor as well as funny dialogue.  You even get to see what the gang might have been like if they had all met as children.  By all means, watch and enjoy The Muppets Take Manhattan, but I think there are better Muppets movies out there.",1080259200,7,2705,4.432323232323232

All the Muppets have just got out of college and now all leave for different destinations and job.  They all split up, but Kermit tries to get them all on Broadway meanwhile with their show ""Manhattan Melodies"".  My favorite scene in this film is when Miss Piggy is spying on Kermit and another lady Kermit is talking to.  Kermit gives a hug to her, and Miss Piggy, who is being teased by some contstruction workers bend a bar of metal and then starts denting metal.  It's really hard to explain, but it is absolutely hilarious.  You have got to buy this DVD!  I also recommend ""The Great Muppet Caper"", ""The Muppet Movie"", ""Muppet Treasure Island"", and ""Muppets From Space"".",1061164800,3,853,4.4935064935064934

Great Cameos and just a fun movie all around. I introduced the Muppets to my 9-year-old cousin with this movie, and now he is hooked and collecting all the figurines.  Great for kids and adults.  Also contains some cool special features on this one as well as Muppet Movie.",1052092800,,450,4.451219512195122

Fun songs, the incomparable fun characters created by Jim Henson and his team of geniuses!

A wonderfully zany romp through the big city, complete with a Broadway show finale and all those wonderful moments that make the Muppets quality entertainment. 'Saying Goodbye' produces tears in me as effectively as it did when I was three. I promise you'll be singing at the end!",1013299200,2,373,4.582089552238806

It's by far the best... ""The Muppet Movie"" is also very good; especially when Big Bird says he's on his way to New York to break into public television.

It follows the gang graduating from college and trying to take Broadway by storm with their musical ""Manhattan Melodies"". After extensive self promotion they soon realise that breaking into showbiz isn't as easy as it might seem.
The third of the Muppet movies sees it's second release on DVD video. This newer release includes a nice interview section with the Muppet mastermind himself, Jim Henson. Apart from the wide-screen picture, the interview section is the best special feature on the disc.
The soundtrack is presented here in mono (did the original cinematical version have a mono soundtrack?) so audio digital remastering wasn't necessary.
Nevertheless, another fine addition to the Muppet DVD collection.",995414400,7,816,5.3828125
276742,3,6300250407,"This is another movie that I loved growing up - well, I loved all of the Muppet's movies. PLUS it has Lonny Price in it, who I find oddly attractive (now, that is, not so much back then). And for some reason, all of the rats' lines have stuck in my head (""Come on in, the coffee's fine!"") without my realizing it - it was only on watching this movie again that I realized where the lines had come from.",995155200,,402,4.0375
276753,4,6300250407,"The Muppets Take Manhattan is the third Muppet film and although not the strongest, it's sure to entertain the entire family.  The story follows the Muppets on their quest to get their show, ""Manhattan Melodies"", produced on Broadway.  It's a terrific story that hits at the core of what the Muppets are all about, namely putting on a show.  Sure the music isn't as memorable as that in the first muppet movie (except ""I'm Gonna Always Love You""), but you can't help appreciating the lengths to which the Muppets will go to entertain you.  Singing chickens?  Got 'em!  Frogs with hair?  Check!  Unbelieveable action sequence?  Of course, and it's unbelieveable in more ways than one!  A Muppet staple is the cameo and they abound in this film.  Everyone from Liza Minelli to Art Carney sets some screen time.  Joan Rivers is particularly funny in her over the top make-up scene with Miss Piggy.  For all you Trekkers, Gates McFadden even appears as a secretary to a con man!
The film is great entertainment, but this DVD has problems.  First of all the digital tranfer isn't that good.  Plenty of older films like Fantasia look stunning on DVD, but not this film.  There is a graininess to the picture that can be discracting and artifacts abound.  Sound is presented in only a mono format.  Was the original film released this way?  I don't know, but if so some mention should be made on the packaging, otherwise it feels like we're getting ripped off.  On a positive note the film is presented in both a formatted and widescreen version.  As for the other bonuses, there is a strange feature called ""Muppetisms"" that I can't really figure out.  They are minute, minute and a half long segments featuring one or two muppets just goofing off and benign wacky.  Not too sure what it's all about, but it was fun to watch - once.  By far the best bonus feature is the interview with Jim Henson.  He talks a bit about the making of the film, how decisions are made and such.  It's an incredible peek into the creation of a Muppet film.  There is one glarig problem though - the chapter stops are just little minute or so long bits of the interview.  To see the whole thing you have to continually stop and start up again.  It's a big mistake and makes watching the entire thing quite a chore.
My final word on this edition is buy it for the widescreen version of the movie only.  The transfer isn't that good, the bonuses aren't that great, but the film itself is a real treat.  Not the strongest Muppet film, but not the weakest either.  If you have the video and don't care about widescreen, you can easily (and sadly) pass on this DVD.  If not, pick this up for a fun romp around Manhattan that you and your family are sure to enjoy again and again.",992044800,66,2748,4.497975708502024
