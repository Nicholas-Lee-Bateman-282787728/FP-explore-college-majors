7538693,4,B0182W7IXY,"My kids have only seen ODD SQUAD a few times as we tend to always miss it on PBS, so it was great to get this collection for home. It has six episodes on it that are perfect for curious minds. My kids ranging from 4 to 9 years old all enjoy the show and even though they may have seen some of these episodes already they don't seem to mind. It is a great mystery solving show for kids that features real kids as opposed to animation - I appreciate the break from animation!

The DANCE LIKE NOBODYS WATCHING DVD includes the stories below:

Dance Like Nobodys Watching

When the alarm system at headquarters is triggered, Olive, Otto, Ms. O, and Oscar must avoid a series of booby traps in order to shut it off. They use their shoes to test the various patterns of the booby traps.

Soundcheck

Olive and Otto must figure out how and why things are disappearing around town when all Otto wants to do is listen to a song by his favorite band, Soundcheck.

Soundcheck Part Deux

When the members of Soundcheck go missing, Otto and Olive must bring them back together in time for their big concert. Otto uses his special superfan closet to help collect data to solve the case.

A Case of the Sing-Alongs

When Mayor Macklemore catches a case of the Sing-A-Longs, Olive and Otto must discover the cause before the Mayor sings his way out of his job!

O is Not for Old

The agents throw a surprise party for Ms. O and are having trouble making decisions about the details. They send OMalley to delay Ms. O by various means while they try to figure them out.

Mystic Egg Pizza

With the help of Odd Squad, Delivery Debbie and Delivery Doug must figure out why their food is disappearing.

ODD SQUAD is a live-action series with the goal of helping kids ages 5-8 learn math. The show focuses on two young agents, Olive and Otto, who are part of Odd Squad, an agency whose mission is to save the day whenever something unusual happens.

I received this DVD to review in exchange for sharing my honest opinion.",1459641600,7,2182,4.42

The Odd Squad is a government agency thats run by kids.  Their mission is to investigate and rectify strange occurrences and to keep everyone safe.  All of the agents have names that begin with the letter O.  Field agents Otto, Olive, and their boss Miss O., are in each of the six episodes on this 90-minute DVD.  As the title suggests, each episode is musically themed and most of them use math logic to solve the perplexing mysteries in their neighborhood.

Heres a break-down of each episode:

Dance Like Nobody is Watching  The agency is under a lockdown as their alarm system got triggered.  Their scientist, Oscar has put many booby traps in place and has long forgotten their patterns.  Otto gets to show off some of his dance moves while de-activating a tricky laser trap.

Sound Check  Theres a hot boy band called Sound Check and all of the townsfolk and agents (except for Olive) are digging their new single  Take Away 4. The problem is that whenever people hear the song, four of their items disappear!

Sound Check Part Deux  Sound Check is back, well at least one of the members is.  The Odd Squad has to help put the band back together by locating the missing three members.

Case of the Sing Alongs  The mayor has developed an unusual habit of singing and dancing at public events.  The Odd Squad has been called in to figure out why and to put a stop to his strange behavior.

O is not for Old  The agency wants to throw a surprise birthday party for Miss O.  Everything is set up except for the forgotten present and birthday cake.  Oscar can produce them quickly if the group can decide on what type of cake and present to give her.  Olafs suggestions for potatoes for both are not very helpful.

Mystic Egg Pizza  The pizza delivery girl and egg sandwich delivery guy have discovered that pieces of their products show up missing after they are placed into their delivery boxes.  The Odd Squad is called in to follow some leads and crack this tricky case.

My kids enjoyed this show and its wacky humor.  Besides entertaining, it teaches logic and math concepts like fractions and graphing/charting.  I highly recommend this DVD",1458864000,2,2205,4.565217391304348

It's a cute show, and unlike a lot of other kid shows on TV, Odd Squad is extremely tolerable. DVD arrived as described, worked fine. Five stars for keeping a child entertained and not driving the adult insane.",1480723200,,370,4.211267605633803
