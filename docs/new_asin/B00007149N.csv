1798406,5,B00007149N,"I was almost in tears watching this movie.  I thought it was so funny and had a great story line.  Ryan Reynolds is soo funny, and you should go check out some of his other movies, like van wilder, he is just as good in that one as he is in this one, and another movie with jerry o'connel is tomcats, and thats a pretty good one too.
BOTTOM LINE: THIS MOVIE KICKS SOME SHIZZAT AND YOU NEED TO GO BUY IT",1053820800,,402,3.8902439024390243
1798407,4,B00007149N,"The cast alone is a reason to see this movie.  Jerry O'Connell is his usual quirky funny self, Brigitte Wilson follows in her own footsteps as a girl wanting to get married (Love Stinks and Wedding Planner), Ryan Reynolds is hilarious as a guy who is so much of a player, mistakes himself for gay when he wakes up in what he thinks is a guys bed, and Alyssa Milano takes a break from the norm as the stripper with a heart of gold.  O'Connell plays Dave, a commitment phobe who has just been given the ultimatum by his hotter then life girlfriend (played by Bridgett Wilson).  She leaves for New York, leaving him to his own devices.  Little does she know, he is stuck in 1st gear because of a near intimate moment in an airport when he was 16.  The girl in the airport left a mark on his life and he is afraid if he marries his girlfriend he will be missing out on his soulmate.  Reynolds is hilarious as the guy that is so in love with himself he should  be gay.  On his quest for the one, he wakes up in a strange bed and does not remember anything from the night before.  When a guy walks in and starts to clean up around him, he thinks that he has had sex with him and begins to question his sexuality, which leads to very humorous scenes with Reynolds (nearly naked and man is he hot!!!).  Alyssa Milano rounds out the cast as Amy, a stripper who used to date Dave and is now friends with the boys.  A very funny movie and a movie that should be seen if you like movies like Tomcats and American Pie.  Enjoy it.",1043366400,8,1516,4.119047619047619

Jerry O'Connell is unbelievably [weak,] the plot weak, and the ending beyond ridiculous!! The only respectable thing about this movie is Bridget Wilson Sampras who does a fairly decent job at pulling off some lackluster material.

Of course, it's not genius, or Oscar-worthy, but it was better than a lot of movies that are in the theatres right now. And if Van Wilder didn't convince you that Ryan Reynolds is destined for greatness, this movie will. He is sexy, hilarious, charismatic, and soooo sexy.

1798410,5,B00007149N,"This was one of the funniest movies I saw in 2002.  This is Jerry O'Connell's followup to ""Tomcats"" and the two are so similar I thought they were made by the same people.  As far as I can tell from the credits, O'Connell is the only correlation.  This one is just as funny if not more so, as O'Connell's girlfriend leaves him for two months to allow him to decide if he wants to marry her.  His reason for not wanting to is told in a hilarious flashback scene, which comes back to haunt him later on in the movie in a way that will spoil a plot twist if I talk about it.  (O'Connell with that horrible mullet he also sported in the flashback scene in ""Tomcats"" is hilarious.) Alyssa Milano has a good role, as does Ryan Reynolds and Ron Livingston.  The question of ""Does true love really exist?"" is handled here with all varieties of humor and many hilarious plot turns.",1041638400,3,872,4.286585365853658

However, I was very disappointed that she has a very small role and is in only 2 scenes. This forced me to sit through a very unoriginal and unfunny gross out/romantic comedy. Jerry O'Connell has never impressed me in any of his work and he should stay away from films. Ryan Reynolds could be very funny, but hes stuck being cast as a moron who thinks he can get away with anything because of his good looks, but he tries to hard. Bridget Wilson is wasted in her role, and should get a new agent. There are a couple of funny scenes but for the most part I was bored and uninterested.

I mean look at this cast list. Jerry O'Connell, Bill Bellamy, Ryan Reynolds, Ron Livingston, Alyssa Milano.

1798470,5,B00007149N,"It's great when you sort through these cheap movies in the few dollars section of stores, take a gamble and find a really great movie.  Who knows why this wasn't a success back in 2002.  I guess maybe because the lead actor and actress weren't that well known (and haven't gone on to major success) and the minor sidekick actor Ryan Reynolds was yet to become a regular lead in higher budget and marketed movies, pretty much just being known for his role on the TV show Two Guys a Girl and a Pizza Place which ended the year before this was released.  Reynolds though is the reason to buy this, he plays a similar character to Barney Stinson in How I Met Your Mother, and has some of the funniest scenes you'll ever see, such as when he wakes up and thinks he slept with a man, and the Spiderman scene with the kid stumbled upon by the kid's father and its aftermath is absolutely classic.  It also has minor appearance by Alyssa Milano at the end who may have been added to get fans of Charmed which was airing at the same time as this.  Whatever reason you decide to give this great film a go, just buy it, you won't be disappointed.

Basic plot revolves around a couple, where the girlfriend goes to New York for a career opportunity. She wants a commitment from her boyfriend who is reluctant to do so.  You see he doesn't believe he's found the one since he met the one for a few seconds at an airport when he was 19.  His friends including one played by Reynolds, tell him why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free, only problem is another friend is getting married.  Seriously this is a nice cheap very funny movie.  Other old movies with actors before they were famous or who were washed up that I've stumbled across for a few dollars which are actually really good include&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Very-Bad-Things/dp/B00007ELER/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Very Bad Things</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kill-Me-Later/dp/B00005QJIV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kill Me Later</a>.",1301270400,,2100,5.043352601156069
1798471,5,B00007149N,"For the first time in my life... hold on a second.  I'm not ready to admit it.  Let me start again, lol.

For the very first time in my life, I think I've finally seen a romance comedy that deserves 5 out of 5 perfect stars.

Yes that's right- despite the fact I claim time and time again (and even put it in my profile description here at amazon) that romance comedies can NEVER have a chance of winning me over because most of the time this is a genre of movies that *really* doesn't appeal to me in the slightest, I guess I have to make an exception in this particular case because Buying the Cow does just about everything right.

It contains actual humor that a guy like me can easily get into (you know, since I'm stubborn and close-minded when it comes to romance comedies) and it features a storyline that eventually leads to an exciting and surprising conclusion.  There's really no flaws anywhere in sight.

Everything from the naked guy jumping out a bathroom window and hanging by a rope attached to a steel bar by the toilet, to the woman in the kitchen spraying his naked hanging body with water out of confusion and fear, to the little boy standing below and believing the guy is superman without his cape, to the man walking out from behind a building corner taking out trash when he catches the guy in a peculiar situation, to the two dogs going at it beside the front door, to the police noticing and admiring the two dogs... yeah this is one extremely well-written and hilarious segment.

And that's just one part of the film!  I didn't even mention the hilarious waitress with a bad attitude.

We're talking about a romance comedy that is funnier more often than it's boring.  That's *incredibly* rare, haha.  It's unheard of!

Whoever came up with the storyline deserves some awards.  Like I mention above, there's a twist at the end involving one of the many women that plays a small part throughout the movie, and I guess it shouldn't be taken as a surprise if you've been following the events closely, but nonetheless, I was a bit shocked.

Overall, the acting is really good, the humor is definitely a reoccuring theme (to my surprise!) and the film is just really darn good.  Finally, a romance comedy I can proudly award 5 stars without reservations!  This may never happen again so savor the moment, lol.",1297296000,,2332,4.52744630071599

I'm serious, if you can get over the ""bad"" movie factor and just relax for five minutes you will enjoy this film. It is truly one of the great ""bad"" movies out there, perfect for a Sunday afternoon.

Have a beer, get over the cliches, the stereotypes, and sexist attitudes. At the end of the day, this movie has a truly positive message. Through all the BS that the sexes go through and put each other through, we all really are desperately seeking ""true love."" A chance to find that special someone that for some unknown reason just feels right in all possible ways. Sure, the movie's completely unrealistic, but there are plenty of laughs along the way and it at least reassures us that there really is true love out there, even if the movie is just a hollywood cliche.",1235692800,,902,4.466666666666667

Just the cast alone is worth getting this movie - I thought they were all great and fit their roles. Everyone of them made me laugh at some point...but Ryan Reynold's was hysterical to me! He rocked! Even if the plot wasn't the greatest...Ryan's role in the film alone is worth watching. I am a hopeless romantic, though, so I liked the whole story and it's definately going in my dvd collection. I was surprised I had never heard of it...but am so glad I found it. I told all my friends about it and would recommend it to anyone!

David (Jerry O'Connell) finds himself under increasing pressure to take the final plunge with his long time girlfriend (Bridgitte Wilson) after his best buddy Tyler becomes engaged. This news wreacks havoc on David's life as he tries to find the answer to the question the movie asks.

This movie is funny, very funny at times and also at times quite stupid, but it is good quality entertainment nonetheless. Ryan Reynolds steals the show unsurprisingly, as Mike, a freind to David and Tyler who is trying to figure out his own problems where he fits in in the world. A scene where he wakes up in a strangers bed after a hugely intoxicating night is absolutely hillarious...

I bought this movie because I am a fan of the young cast, especially Reynolds and also because it is directed by Walt Becker, the same guy who gave us Van Wilder. Fans of that movie will love this, as will all fans of Reynolds and Jerry O'Connell. Anyone else may find it to be 'not their kinda movie'.",1167955200,2,1062,4.526041666666667

Also, if you like Ryan Reynolds, he's hilarious in this. As a side note to the other ladies, you get to see him naked which is always a wonderful plus in my book. He looks gorgeous! Jerry O'Connell's character seems very similar to that of his character in Tomcats, but he's still great fun. Another thing I really liked was how they showed Jerry O'Connell's meeting in the airport with the girl of his dreams from his point of view as well as later on in the film, from her point of view.

It has some seriously subpar performances from pretty much all involved, and the script was just awful. Gosh, it's hard to believe I actually sat through it. It was just so... exactly what it was, I guess. A stupid sex comedy that's absolutely terrified to be anything else. The thing that really pushed this above the radar for me to blip at was the truly offensive tone of some of the material. I think my real downfall here was the fact that I'm a gay guy whose friends are mostly straight guys. The scenes regarding a certain character and his chance encounter with homosexuality are so repugnant it's almost ridiculous. Now, I'm not one to get offended easily, but this just took it a bit too far. Just the attitudes and behaviors expressed by most of the characters just made me depressed, which isn't really something I look for in a movie. It just seems to me that if 'gay' had been replaced with 'black', this would have been deemed racist and probably wouldn't ever have been released. Not that I'm condoning censorship, but when your tone becomes so... mocking, I guess. Oh well, I guess all I'm trying to say is I will definitely not be repeat viewing this film, and I don't recommend you view it at all if you're a woman, or gay, or you care about others.",1106006400,10,1427,4.409090909090909

A word of warning though, if you are breaking up or if you have just broken up, you may not want to watch this movie cause it's all about relationships ..... I say this cause I thought this was hilarious, but my friend who has just broken up his relationship (and normally would have enjoyed it) squirmed in his seat in parts of it ....

When you have a supporting role in an otherwise average film, you should make the most of it; and on the strength of his performance alone I can recommend this film.  As for the appearance of Alyssa Milano, she looked alluring as usual, but was otherwise just another disposable bimbo-type character that could have been played by thousands of other actresses with breast implants like hers.  Not to belittle her talent, but she has no scenes here worth mentioning.  As for her acting ability, try watching her television show ""Charmed.""  But for all the raging heterosexuals out there who want to see more of her ""talent,"" you should all buy ""Embrace of the Vampire.""  She is absolutely luscious in that movie.  Overall, this film is typical romantic-comedy fare with a dash of comic genius via Ryan Reynolds.",1075075200,14,1291,5.1

1798518,5,B00007149N,"""Buying the Cow"" was a definite dvd to buy after seeing it once. I even buy this when I need a gift to give cause the movie is hilarious. Ryan Reynolds has some scenes in this movie that will make you wonder why hes not headling movies yet? He keeps his ""Van Wilder"" attitude rollin' threw this one thats for sure! Jerry O'Connel pulls off another safe performance where he plays the love struck goofey guy! But this movie is about Ryan Reynolds and the hottie from the cafe (you'll know)! You must see this movie!!!!!",1071014400,3,518,4.40625
1798519,5,B00007149N,"The thing that I really enjoyed about this movie is the idea.  The fact that it takes a different spin on relationships and actually shows some problems that they may have.  Sure, it is a Hollywood and things do get out of hand from time to time however, it keeps the idea alive that there is only a single individual for each person to be with (or marry) in their lives.
The move starts out with David (Jerry O'Connell) having his girlfriend Sarah (Bridgette Wilson) leaving him to do a job in New York City.  So Dave starts going out to clubs with his friends Mike (Ryan Reynolds) and Jones (Bill Bellamy) to have a little fun and the plot is introduced.  Simply put, the plot is to that there is only one other person in the world that can give you true love, or as the movie states, pure truth.
As the movie progresses, the plot thickens when David sees a girl in a local restaurant that gives him that love struck feeling again and moreover, attempts to track her down using dating services that ultimately fail with a crash and burn.  In the mean time, Mike figures out that he his actually homosexual.  And a little later, David and Sarah break-up in the airport up over things that they do not even know are true or not and David leaves for New York City to see his friend Andrew (Jon Tenney) that is getting married to Julie (Erinn Bartlett) which happens to be the girl that he had an obsession with for a while in his younger years.
Finally, at the wedding, Mike announces that he is a homosexual while Andrew and Julie try to convince David to meet Julie's sister Katie (Scarlett Chorvat) and they end up meeting and live happily ever after.
Overall, I thought this movie was absolutely historical and actually almost had me in tears at times.  Ryan Reynolds is historical in this movie.  In time, I think that Buying the Cow will become a classic romantic comedy.",1070928000,,1876,4.433139534883721
1798520,5,B00007149N,Omg Ryan Reynolds was hilarious in this flick. The rest of the movie is typical love story type stuff but his role in the movie made it worth every penny. If you wanna see some hilarious crude humor then definitley pick this up.,1064188800,,228,4.325581395348837
