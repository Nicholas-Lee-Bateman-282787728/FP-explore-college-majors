7890102,5,6305474621,amusing and very upbeat tale of reckless love among purportedly respected professionals replete with  their  far fetched but humorous excesses in pursuit of romantic triumph.,1440288000,,174,5.92
7890103,5,6305474621,"If you want to go on an emotional roller-coaster, THIS is the series for you! The intensity of human emotions and the complexity of human lives are dramatized with excruciating accuracy, using exceptional characterization on the parts of the three main actors. My recommendation: start at the beginning of the series and set aside a LARGE block of time to watch this, because once you start, you will have to see it all the way through. And have a tissue box handy for the last three scenes with Michael Kitchen.",1372982400,,512,4.7
7890104,5,6305474621,"Never watched this VHS as the sequel came with the three-parter of the original series,so it was an unnecessary purchase.",1259452800,,121,5.1
7890105,5,6305474621,I re-watch Reckless and the sequel at least once per year.  A really well-done little story!  And a fun romance as well.,1243641600,3,120,4.409090909090909
7890106,5,6305474621,"I saw the original Reckless Masterpiece Theatre, and it's fabulous! This one also is great. Who could resist the leading man, and the humor is hysterical. Smarty pants remarks abound. Buy it! Watch it!",979084800,10,201,4.9411764705882355
