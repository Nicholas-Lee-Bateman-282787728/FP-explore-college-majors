917515,3,6304601727,"I bought recently both the 1952 and the 1999 film versions of Orwell's dark fable, and although neither of them is what you'd expect, at least this one has some redeeming value. Both movies are absurdly intended for children (the book is obviously not), poorly done, too slow, and patched up with annoying ""happy endings"" that resemble one another (Napoleon's regime is overthrown, a wall comes tumbling down, whatever...). The only difference is that the 1952 cartoon was made one year before Stalin's death: Not only way before the falling of the wall, way before the wall was even built! And its eerie to see the filmmaker's prophetic eye in describing the fall of Communism: Animal farms multiply enslaving its flocks, the beasts get fed up (figuratively speaking, of course, for they're starving), revolt against their pig masters (who look like Khruschev, Gorbachev and Caeseascu!) while their praetorian guardian dogs do nothing, animals oust the swine in just one relatively bloodless uprising, and ...a wall comes tumbling down! I thought I was watching an animated CNN special, only drawn in a time where the events depicted were nothing more than mere -and nowhere near- wishful thinking! That being said, neither movie is any good. Too light for the book's fans, and too violent for the kiddies (this one is quite bloodier). If you want to show your children an enjoyable fable for grown-ups (also staged in somber surroundings) get CHICKEN RUN. Now, that's a masterpiece!",998611200,9,1484,5.061224489795919

917517,1,6304601727,"IMDB.com didn't think my comment on this film was worth posting, but I will try here and hope Amazon.com doesn't have high requirements :)
I have never seen this film, but the New York Times has reported on the  discovery that this film, along with the 1950's version of  ""1984"", was created by the CIA. Created may be too strong a word  however. If I remember the report correctly, the CIA funded both of these  projects while demanding some alterations be done. The fact that the pigs  in this movie do not stand alongside the humans at the end, like in the  book, is due directly to the CIA's influence.
The report was on the new  book ""The Cultural Cold War"", which can also be found at  Amazon.com (grin grin). So for more details, check out that book.

An outstanding achievement for award-winning animators John Halas and Joy Batchelor, this landmark adaptation brilliantly conveys the horror and humour of George Orwell's scathing satire. To celebrate its 60th Anniversary, the film is featured here in a new High Definition transfer made from original film elements.

Inspired by the dream of Old Major, a prize boar, the overworked animals of Manor Farm rise up against their negligent, drunken owner and drive him out. Led by two young pigs, Snowball and Napoleon, they establish their own self-sufficient farm, but as the farm flourishes it begins to slide into dictatorship. Narrated by Gordon Heath.

FILM FACT: The story of how his book was turned into Britain's first animated feature film is fascinating, not least because the movie was funded by America's Central Intelligence Agency. The truth about the CIA's involvement was kept hidden for 20 years until, in 1974, Everette Howard Hunt revealed the story in his book Undercover: Memoirs of an American Secret Agent. Why did the CIA choose England as the place to make the film? They were impressed by the advertisement commercials Halas & Batchelor had made for Kelloggs Cornflakes, and by the wartime propaganda films the couple had been behind. The CIA also thought it would be cheaper to make the film in England and believed, with good reason, that they would be able to keep the English animators in the dark about who was funding the film. In the optimistic C.I.A. approved ending to the film, the (non-pig) animals ask for help from the outside. They are helped, enabling them to crush the evil Stalin ruler. Some endings are more equal than others, it seems.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Celebrate the 60th Anniversary of Britain's first feature-length animated film, ANIMAL FARM that was George Orwell's classic fable about repression, revolution, and corruption became a quirky animated mini-classic 1954 animated feature caught the bleakness of George Orwell's allegory, and the growing usage of the animated cartoon as a medium for conveying something more than short spurts of slapstick entertainment and children's fairy tales is eminently marked by the rendering of George Orwell's novel ""Animal Farm"" into a full-length adult cinematic satire, which opened at the Paris yesterday. This vivid and biting animation of George Orwell's popular tale of social revolution and disillusion, expressed in terms of animals on a farm, is, indeed, a pretty brutal demonstration of the vicious cycle of tyranny, and what there is of outright laughing humour in it comes from the smartness of its clever caricatures.

Obviously, the British animators, John Halas and Joy Batchelor, who made this film for Louis de Rochemont Associates, were most fascinated and inspired by the task of presenting the leaders of the new Power State of the animals as pigs. For their most illuminating and devastating revelations of inhumanity and selfish greed are in their brilliant drawings and animations of the dictatorial Napoleon and his fellow swine. It is in the ponderous porcine features and pompous movements of these heavy beasts, who lead the animals in a revolt against the farmer and then set up a socialistic state in which they impose a tyranny of their own, that a sense of the monstrous hypocrisy of the totalitarian leader type is conveyed and the irony and cynicism of the idea of this satire is most clearly visualised.

Actually, the pigs are the only creatures that are fully caricatured and they to a lesser degree, the donkey, Benjamin, and the swarthy Farmer Jones. The rest are fairly representational with the sheep, the chickens, the cows and ducks and the heroic draught horse, Boxer, who comes to a horrifying end when he is carted off to be made into glue. As a consequence, the drawing of this cartoon is very close to what is known as the Disney style, with prettified and heroized animals set in quaint and toyland fields and barns. And, indeed, one or two of the sequences, such as that of the animals doing the daily chores or building their own proud windmill, would do credit to a Disney cartoon.

But the theme is far from a Walt Disney animation, and the cruelties that occur from time to time are more realistic and shocking than any of the famous sadisms that have occurred in Disney films. The business of Napoleon bringing up puppies to be his own special pack of killer dogs, the liquidators of those who oppose him, is, for instance, blood-curdling stuff. And the carting away of poor old Boxer is unrelieved agony.

The film's credited producer is Louis de Rochemont, whose major achievement up to then was the creation of the March of Time newsreel format in the US, though he had also produced feature films dealing with sensitive political issues. But later research suggests that the funding was provided directly by the CIA, who at the height of the McCarthy witch-hunts was keen to back a popular film with an explicitly anti-Communist message. To emphasise this, Orwell's profoundly pessimistic ending was softened, though it's still left ambiguous as to whether the rule of the hated pigs truly is coming to an end.

However, that's the nature of this picture, as it is of George Orwell's novel: The shock of straight and raw political satire is made more grotesque in the medium of cartoon. The incongruities of recognisable horrors of some political realities of our times are emphasised and made more startling by the apparent innocence of their surrounding frame. John Halas and Joy Batchelor were hired to direct what would turn out to be Britain's first animated feature film, with Maurice Denham supplying all the voices, bar the narration, by Gordon Heath. The visual style recalls the great Walt Disney features of the 1930s and 1940s, though the content is far more adult and notably unsentimental.

Blu-ray Video Quality  In celebration of its 60th anniversary, ANIMAL FARM has been brought back to life with this Networks brilliant 1080p encoded image, with of course an equally impressive 1.33:1 aspect ratio. The restoration of the animation film for this transfer is also very impressive. The picture quality is great; carefully preserved to recreate the image without damaging its original look and feel. The colours are not oversaturated, and it does not seem to look like there has been too much DNR [Digital Noise Reduction] and definitely gets a 5 star rating from me for a great effort of the team at Network. Network has done an outstanding job with the musical elements of ANIMAL FARM, treating them with importance and respect. M&aacute;ty&aacute;s Seibers score is simply breath-taking and brings a whole new dimension to cartoon animation. Interestingly, Halas & Batcehlors ANIMAL FARM is often dictated by the rise and fall of the score, giving the audience an immersive experience thats only heightened by Networks competent restoration. Networks rendition will allow George Orwells and Halas & Batchelors legends to survive respectively; with the 20th century tale facing a contemporary and ever-changing audience in the 21st century. Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The sound is presented in its original 1.0 LPCM Mono Audio, which is very clean for a film released in 1954, especially with the recording techniques that were not so sophisticated in 1954, that you expect from audio sounds that you get with films released today. Still, this is a great preservation of ANIMAL FARM, which will do a fine job of replacing your worn-out VHS copy. But overall it is a great effort on the part of Network and their team in finally seeing the best animation Halas & Batchelor ever produced with this brilliant classic animation cartoon from the Halas & Batchelor vaults.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary with Brian Sibley: Here Brian Sibley introduces himself and informs us that he is a Film Historian and is also an English writer. He is author of over 100 hours of radio drama and has written and presented hundreds of radio documentaries, features and weekly programmes. But the thing that strikes Brian with the opening film credits is how prominent Louis de Rochemont is credited and was a major American filmmaker known for creating, along with Roy E. Larsen from Time, Inc., the monthly theatrically shown newsreels The March of Time documentary series. Brian also points out the wording states it is a Memorable Fable, whereas George Orwell called it personally a Fairy Story, which is an interesting concept. Brian says that what strikes you is the music composed by M&aacute;ty&aacute;s Seiber, which is very lyrical, pastoral, especially with a wonderful visual opening, which is so reminiscent to the beautiful English countryside, but it quickly turns to a great brown burnt out colours of the farm, that gives it a totally sinister look. When you see Moses the raven sitting on the Manor Farm sign, and that the raven is a very important character, especially throughout the animated film progresses, because the raven is a sort of sentinel and an observer of everything that is taking place on the farm, who is basically a silent witness and also the music gives the impression of something that is very foreboding, and also something suggesting there are doomfully things to come. Brian praises the brilliant effects of light and shading that we would normally associate with a Walt Disney animation, but with a Halas & Batchelor gives us a more European style animation, with heightened animation. Brian feels that when Old Major collapses and dies, which is a very bold move so very earlier on in the animated film, which was a very dramatic move on the part of Halas & Batchelor. When the animals rise up against the humans and they run off, but suddenly we see the dog has been killed, and Brian says that Halas & Batchelor are not scared to show death, like in real life, whereas with a Disney animation, it would not be shown, but then the animals in turn destroy everything related to the humans, which relates to the tyranny of Famer Jones, and is a very symbolic part in the animated film, and is also very evocative, because it beautifully animated without any use of dialogue or narrative. Brian says that over the passage of time is depicted especially with the changes of the seasons are superbly done with superb animation, especially with stylised backgrounds, but when it comes to scenes with snow, which is very flat, but is highlighted beautiful with the animals footprints in the snow. Brian feels when you see the animals start to build the windmill, which Brian feels is brilliantly choreographed sequences, and it much characterisation is created in a way in which the animals pull things, push things, lift things and Brian also points out particular Boxer the shire horse shows the weight he is pulling and also the other animals as well, which is brilliantly animated observation. Brian comments on the scene where it starts to rain, which is the first time we have observed and the sheer struggle and tension of the animation in seeing Boxer and Benjamin still struggling to finish building the windmill, and the dramatic conclusion is when Boxer is seriously injured and the sad pathos of Benjamin consoling Boxer his long term friend and is trying to revive Boxer, which is so brilliantly portrayed, where you have great comedy, but with high pathos. As we get to near the end of the animated film, where the animals rise up against the tyrannical pigs, and is rendered with shadows on the wall of the farm house, especially seeing the portrait of Napoleon is smashed, but finally we see the rest of the animals marching forward and the birds fly over their heads, which perhaps gives the impression of a renewed promise for hope for the future and Brian feels that ANIMAL FARM might not have a Disney happy ever after ending, but it is one of optimum, never the less it is an ending like no other animated film that was made before or since, which I concur 100%. But with Brians summing up of this very powerful prophetic animated film ANIMAL FARM and the very forwarding thinking and professional Halas & Batchelor team, in producing one of the best animated film for all of us in the United Kingdom and how John Halas, Joy Halas and Louis de Rochemont were not afraid to be very provocative and fight against the strong criticism by the British Government of the time and the strong prejudice personally by Winston Churchill against his portrayal and caricature of the pig Napoleon, because Winston Churchill had no personal say in the matter, because if there had been interference from all politicians, the film would of turned entirely different to the detriment to free speech and a much more sanitised direction of the animated film, so once again three cheers to Halas & Batchelor for standing up against the establishment.

Special Feature: A Stay Tooned Special: Down On Animal Farm [1995] [480i] [1.33:1] [29:15] Presented by Blackadders Tony Robinson, and in each episode he would give an in depth profile of key cartoons or studios and this Stay Tooned special presents a special programme to mark the re-release of the Halas & Batchelors animated feature and also charts the history of the film and the Halas & Batchelor animation studio. We get an in depth look at ANIMAL FARM especially considering the BBC TV Series was made for a BBC Childrens TV audience with interviews from Bob Godfrey [Animator], whilst Maurice Denham [Voice Actor] talks us through performance, animator Harold Whitaker [Animal Farm Animator] elucidates on the art of animation and are all tied together by Tony Robinsons presenting style, which keeps it from being too patronising, which most BBC Childrens TV have a tendency to fall into. But as an added bonus, we get excerpts from: Train Trouble [1940]; Filling the Gap [Black-and-White] [1942]; Dustbin Parade [Black-and-White] [1941]; Festival of Britain [Documentary]; The Owl and the Pussy Cat [1952]; The Figurehead [1953]; Animal Farm [1954]; Ruddigore [1967] and Automania 2000 [1963], sadly some of the animation you view is of very poor quality. This documentary stands as a good introduction into the Halas & Batchelor studio and the film.

Special Feature: Storyboards to feature [2015] [1080p] [1.33:1] [25:54] This Storyboards to Feature comparison, unusually these storyboards are in full colour and simplistic in design resembling what we would see today as a colour script. Nonetheless comparing them to the final film is compelling enough. It is really good to see what Halas & Batchelors extensive storyboard we see and how you get to see the finished film beside the storyboard.

Special Feature: Character sketches [2014] [1080p] [1.33:1] [2:56] Here we get another peep into the archive of Halas & Batchelor, with character model sheets, sketches and action poses of the cast all laid out for the film. Here you get a short video showing some of the original black-and-white pencil character sketches of the key characters in the animation film that aided the animation of facial expressions that was eventually transferred to the finished animation film.

Special Feature: Poster Gallery [2015] [1080p] [00:46] Here you get to view three very rare specially designed colourful cinema advertising posters of the film ANIMAL FARM.

Special Feature: Clapperboard extract [1980] [480i] [1.33:1] [13:02] Here once again we dip into the archive of the Granada TV cinema television programme entitled Clapperboard. This is a fascinating interview with John Halas that is centred around the animated film ANIMAL FARM and gives his perspective of the film. It is interesting to hear how an irate Winston Churchill contacted the production team after the release about his caricature in the film. John Halas also talks about the key points of the film, including why the ending was added. But as a bonus you get to see lots of clips from ANIMAL FARM [1954], but sadly throughout this Clapperboard extract you get to view varying quality of the images, that goes from average to some washed out colour.

Special Feature: Image Gallery [2015] [1080p] [3:57] Here you get to view 80 stunning images, that includes black-and-white images of behind-the-scenes, also lots of beautiful colourful promotional items, stunning black-and-white and colourful of all of the artists sketches, beautiful colourful cells that went towards the making of the brilliant Halas & Batchelor award winning animation film ANIMAL FARM.

Special Feature: PDF Material [2015] All the Special Features are available via the BD-Rom drive on your PC or Mac computer.

Finally, ANIMAL FARM is a pretty good film, and the animation cartoon itself is technically first-rate. The animation is clean, and the colour image rendition is beautifully defined. The Halas & Batchelor team really knew their animation business in a very professional way. But don't make the mistake of thinking this is for little children, just because it is an animation cartoon, in fact it is aimed more at an adult audience, as some of the scenes would really scare and frighten children and give them nightmares. The idea at the heart of ANIMAL FARM are still very prescient to this to a very modern audience and that is why I really enjoyed watching this brilliant Blu-ray of ANIMAL FARM. I would without doubt recommend that people seek out ANIMAL FARM, and maybe even show it to young viewers at the right appropriate age, because its a very sophisticated adult story that should be helpful to young viewers when it comes to understanding the way the world works. One of the finest entries into The British Film collection yet, as ANIMAL FARM is an animation film loaded with lots of meaning. George Orwell and animation fans alike will greatly enjoy this. Whilst the United Kingdom has an incredible variety of animated feature films with its history of film heritage and definitely starts with ANIMAL FARM, which lasts as a testament to the professional talent of the day form of the very professional Halas & Batchelor team and as inspiration for the talent of the future. But most importantly ANIMAL FARM is a masterpiece of animation that still makes a pin-sharp point in today's society of increasing political and social inequality. Highly Recommended!

918107,5,6304601727,One of my favorite movies!  Shows how you can start out with a plan like our US Constitution and bit by bit it becomes almost opposite of it's original design.  I love how this illustrates the mechanics of how this deterioration happens.  I wish we showed this in schools!  We should all know to watch for this and call our elected officials to account and know when our own laws are actually contrary to our Constitution.

918108,5,6304601727,"There is a reason so many leftist-run public schools today avoid the book and this animated version of it - it runs counter to the narrative being preached in those schools where ignorance is the left's only real weapon against the truth so powerfully touched on in many of Orwell's works, including this one, 1984, and others. This animated feature is great for children to help them learn the consequences of socialism - an ideology borne of greed and cynicism. It demonstrates how revolutions of this kind pretend to be for all but ultimately are really just for the few elite who started them. The ensuing upheaval wrecks the lives of the ordinary souls who aren't granted special privileges and in the end, as the story shows, it becomes a case where some animals are more equal than others. The film reminds us all that the only thing a socialist regime is good for is to be overthrown - be it pigs in a farmer's house, Communists in Beijing or Havana, or Nazis in Berlin. The animation is very good and children and adults both will find it entertaining and compelling. I highly recommend this movie.",1451174400,,1107,4.653061224489796

First, probably 90% of it is narrated. The animals barely speak at all. Strange for a movie, and especially strange for a story in which verbal manipulation is the essential weapon that the pigs use to lull the other animals into complacency while they create a tyrannical dictatorship.

Second, they make some of the plot points even darker than in the book. Not what I expected from an animated movie from the 1950s. For example, in the book, the dogs chase Snowball off the farm and he's never seen from again. In the movie, the dogs continue chasing Snowball even after he leaves the farm, and they catch him and eat him.",1446508800,3,654,4.581196581196581

918512,5,6304601727,"This adult feature-length animated film (the first of its kind from the UK) is not for little kids. A friend of mine saw it as a child and it terrified him, as well it should. It is a graphic (literally and figuratively) representation of the abuses of political power, and provides a vivid portrait of how revolutions can go wrong (a deeply relevant issue in our current global politics). It is also a compelling examination of the dynamics of class and privilege, including the appropriation of the arts by power elites. The original George Orwell novel (on which this film is based) ends on a down-beat note in which the revolutionary farm animals end up just as abused and exploited by the ruling class pigs as they were by the original human farmowner. This animated version has been criticized for ending on a hopeful note (the animal proletariat rise up once again against their new oppressors), but this revisionist ending is fine with me. The down-beat allegorical ending works on the page, stirring protest in the reader against its unfairness, but film viewers receive images in a way that is different from how readers receive the images they create for themselves. Film viewers need to have different satisfactions provided to them in order for an artistic creation to work as an artistic whole, such as happy endings, even if these endings are tinged with irony. The novel, like Bertolt Brecht's plays, intentionally frustrates us with its emotionally ""unsatisfying"" ending in order to provoke new thought and action (like Piagets model of the growing child developing new conceptual schema in order to apprehend discordant experiential data).  But animated film, living halfway between metaphor and realism, works with us through a different dynamic.
When I first saw this film as a young man, it provided me with my first visual metaphors for analyzing corrupt political rhetoric, and for understanding the power of language in manipulating public narratives. I have always been grateful for these thinking tools. Remembering the image of the painted words: All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others"" prepared me well to unravel the recent linguist hocus-pocus of ""estate taxes"" being redefined as ""death taxes,"" and ""equitable access"" being redefined as ""class war-fare.""
One of the curious contradictions of this films production is the fact that it was funded as part of the American CIAs effort to discredit Russian Communism, yet uses almost campy Soviet style stirring anthems and heroic tableaus to represent enduring longings for freedom and justice. And that's just what the CIA got, as Soviet-style anti-socialists, for supporting the adaptation of work by an anti-Soviet socialist.",1393459200,10,2733,5.155405405405405
918513,4,6304601727,"The Story was written by George Orwell, as a way of explaining the truths about communism, but it also gives a moral on today's nepotism.  The plot is simple; the farm animals revolt against the owner of the farm and take over.  At first, this launches like a great idea, the animals draft their own bill of rights and become very productive.  However, true to any autocratic government, a specific group (the pigs) take full leadership of the farm, altering their bill of rights until they have none while plunging them into a ruthless, evil dictatorship.  The animal's pride all but evaporates, and they cease to be productive.  The animals realize that they were better off with the farmer.  Great story!

The reason this doesn't get a 5 is the poor video and audio quality.  The 4:3 ratio was cool with an older TV and the audio may have been satisfactory for 1954, but for today's HDTVs it detracts from the story.",1392768000,,919,4.62962962962963

One of the best parts is that early in the change from Manor Farm to Animal Farm, the pigs post a series of rules that sound good as far as they go. Then one by one they modify the rules to suit themselves.",1336694400,,667,4.414634146341464

Please don't watch the 1999 version, especially with children!

This animated feature is appropriate for younger viewers, while being fairly entertaining and educational for all ages. It is a pretty good reflection of the novel, since the barn animals in the movie do basically the same thing they do in the books. Just like the novel, it makes one realize the consequences of an allegedly ""equal"" society: there is still a distinction based on class, even if it's implicit; people in positions of power are still able to exploit the proletariat; and basically, there is no such thing as everyone being truly equal. The pigs even claim that ""all animals are equal, but some are more equal than others"". It's amazing how much both the movie and the novel can teach us about human societies through an analogy about barn animals.

The script is based on George Orwell's ""Animal Farm"" and retains much of its brilliance, and is narrated by Gordon Heath, with character actor Maurice Denham speaking all the animal parts.

Orwell wrote ""Animal Farm"" with the Stalinist Soviet Union in mind, but the tale could apply to any totalitarian regime, many which start with the socialistic ""one for all-all for one"" idealism and propaganda. The animation is fairly simple compared to what one is used to today, but the images are powerful, and very moving. The plight of Boxer the horse and his devoted friend Benjamin the donkey is wrenching, and beautifully drawn.

The sound effects are also excellent, as well as the score by Matyas Siber, which has some songs that imitate the Soviet military style, with one of them cleverly vocalized by animal sounds.

With that said, enjoy the film for what it is. It's a really deep and thought-provoking film about how the exploited often becomes the exploiter. In this case, a group of animals overthrow and evil farmer and create a new society called ""Animalism"" which stresses cooperation among non-humans. The Pigs wind up as the rurlers of this Brave New World and a pig maned Napoleon slowly and subtly beomes their dicator. Even those who are unaware that the story is based on Stalinist Russia will be moved by what happens to Boxer the horse (this scene is pretty faithful to Orwell's original) and be repelled by the corruption of Napoleon the Pig (aka Joseph Stalin).

Made by a British company in 1955, this was probably the first adult-oriented cartoon feature. CERTAINLY not for the kiddies, as they may find it overtly grim and depressing.

919027,2,6304601727,"Animal farm was a book written over 60 years ago by George Orwell. It has been converted into a child's cartoon film. It is a fable, which re-enacts the Russian Revolution, swapping humans for animals.
 It starts off with a speech by a pig called major, which represents Karl Marx. He influences the animals about rebelling against humans. Eventually the animals drive Mr Jones (who represents the former Russian leaders, the Tsars) off the farm, in order to start a communist community. Like most revolutions, people start to give themselves leadership. Eventually, the leaders start to turn into the former leaders, and things became as they started off.
 However, the film takes a twist at the end. The animals fight back against the pig leaders. This was a very bad idea because it destroys the connection with the Russian Revolution. It loses its effects.
 However, the sense of satire still remains because pigs represent the communist leaders, and pigs are usually unpleasant creatures.
 The film is only good as far as an entertaining cartoon, but after reading the book, I find it a very bad comparison as many major characters and parts are missed out, and the ending fails to follow that of the Russian revolution.",1058227200,2,1225,4.932038834951456

919031,5,6304601727,"Based on the novel by George Orwell, this animated film is for adults and means just as much now as it did when released in the mid 1950's.
Manor Farm is run by the often drunk Farmer Jones. The neglected farm animals revolt, thanks to the inspiring words of an old hog, who dies and becomes a sudden martyr. The remaining animals adopt some simple rules, and get along swimmingly.
Eventually, the animal utopia begins to crumble. The remaining pigs, led by the tyrannical Napoleon, begin taking advantage of the others' hard work. They dispatch enemies as needed, but still have enough power to rally the troops to fight off a violent invasion by Jones and his drinking buddies. As the pigs begin trading with a shady businessman from the outside world, the animals finally come to their senses and do what they should have done long ago.
Finally, an animated film for adults that actually challenges the viewer to think. No Disney-like cute factor, no songs by aging white British rockers, this is a fascinating film. Orwell's book was written as a lambast against communism, fascism, and dictatorships in general, yet many of the pigs' selfish actions could be applied to modern government today.
As a country, we get upset at every mention of pork barrel (ironic) spending, yet we send our representatives back year after year because it is always some other state or district's politician who is causing the trouble. ""Animal Farm"" illustrates in simple, yet not dumbed down terms, the way power corrupts, especially by those whose motives seem so sincere to begin with.
If anything, this film should empower you. This should not lead you to violent revolt against your congressperson, but it should force you to ask questions about where that income and sales tax goes. ""Animal Farm"" is important, entertaining, and thought provoking. I would match it up against anything Disney has released in the past fifty years. Yes, their audience goals are different, but as adults, it is nice to have something besides anime aimed at our heads. Great film.

919032,4,6304601727,"What you see in this animated film is animals, but not necessarily friendly to humans.  Or, they could be even sometimes very cruel to fellow creatures.  But of course they should be, because this is an animated film version of George ""1984"" Orwell's biting satire of Stalinism.  On the backcover you can see that this one ""May NOT Suitable for Kids.""  I would say, ""never.""  If you still insist, buy 1999 version of the same title, adapted with images friendlier to kids.  This older one may scare many of children, who expect every animal should live in peace.
Possibly, however, Wednesday of the Addams Family, who heartily disliked Disney productions, would love this film.  Certainly this film has the same unusual kind of humor and wit as that family has.  The story of ""Animal Farm"" concerns the rise and fall of the titular ""Animal Farm"" (formerly ""Manor Farm"") where poor animals were once tormented by tyranny of Mr. Jones, but no longer.  Under the guidance of Old Major, the Great Pig, they made a revolution against humans, and succeeded.  So, the liberated animals start their own life, with a pig Napoleon as their leader, but alas! they are not as wise as they thought.
As you can judge from the short running time that barely exceeds 70 minutes, this 1954 adaptation of George Orwell political satire leaves a lot of its original book behind, intent on drawing out its essential spirit.  Complaining viewers would find the change of the ending very lamentable, but the deed is done, and half a century ago, so let's take it as a kind of testimony of the time it was made when the Cold War is a very realistic thing.
The most recommendable thing about the film would be its techinical aspects.  The film is made with traditional skills of animation, and considering the time it was created, the images still retain its original power.  Though it often reminds us of Disney's achievement (such as ""Fantasia"" or ""Pinochio""), and probably owes much to this master of animation films, ""Animal Farm"" manages to impress us considerably, with its detailed descriptions of animals' movements.  The sly humor here and there is effective, and most of all, the film doesn't pull its punch when the story requires it to show the deaths of animals (though this part is exactly the reason this film may not be suitable for children).
The character designs are not inviting, with their faces that are far from cute and pretty, but this version of ""Animal Farm"" deserves our attention, not only for readers of George Orwell,  but also for those who are interested in the animation history.",1029715200,6,2589,4.786516853932584

7876518,3,6304601727,"A fairy tale or a nightmare? It all began with a dream by Major, a Middle White boar, of equality, and freedom from oppression. Maybe not in our life comrade, but eventually.

The dream brings a song. Intolerable conditions lead to revolution. As time passes things change; not exactly as planned.

There are two striking parts to this tale that stand out. First when Boxer is sent to the hospital and Benjamin reads the side of the van ""Horse Slaughterer."" Secondly there was a party in the farm house as the pigs were playing cards with the men, two aces of spades showed up.

At the end in the book, an argument ensues between pigs and man working together. Then the creatures outside looking in as they ""...looked from pig to man and man to pig, and from pig to man again drew a realization...""

In the movie the pigs stand alone; then the world is dissen-pig-ulated by the rest of the animals. Not really an ending.

It is suggested that the end of the movie was changed by the CIA who obtained the rights to Animal Farm. We notice pigs without people.

Gordon Heath is the narrator in this 1954 presentation of Orwells Animal Farm.
Maurice Denham was the voice of all the animals.

Between narration are long wordless views that stretches the film out to two or three times what it normally be with just the narration.",1510531200,,1324,4.514644351464435
