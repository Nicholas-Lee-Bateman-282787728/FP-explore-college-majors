998137,2,6305260621,"It got old fast watching the story of a junky, even though based on a true story. Ben Stiller did a good job in his role but he's been associated with comedic roles so much that he didn't 'fit' this kind of movie for me. I got bored early in the movie but watched it all, hoping it would get better. It didn't.",1463616000,,310,3.9365079365079363

998145,4,6305260621,"Some will agree but most will not understand this film. It's Raw , edgy , and a full frontal of the drug addition spiral that starts off with a good time and ends wondering if he will ever really regain his sanity. At some point you feel compassion for him , but mostly it's pain because the hits just keep coming. Acting was good , could have better with the right screenplay and cleaner editing. In a lot of ways I see why this story had to be told, and it ends without a sense of closure which is why my 4star rating gives me the imaginary control.",1457308800,,551,4.111111111111111

998204,3,6305260621,Found it to be very trite.  Sorry but Ben Stiller's acting wasn't polished enough to carry out the character needed for this role.  The celebrities seemed to be putting in cameo appearances and not given much thought to their parts,1455580800,,231,4.75

Well, I got a few, but this movie is a sleeper. It was an intense mystery type movie, that kept me on the edge of my seat (and from getting up for something to eat). Fast paced, well acted, and a real pleasure to watch. I can't imagine why it's rating was as low as it was, but I'm giving it 5 stars! Watch it, and rate it.

998448,3,6305260621,"Stiller's acting was restrained but he did a good job. The narcissistic character wasn't  consumed by the basic struggle of trying to scrape of enough money that is usually the beginning of the cycle drug addiction. He had the money and all the drugs he wanted without having to constantly place his life  in danger. He had the connections,  the ability to lie, and because of his privilege, seemed to have an air of entitlement to his drug use though at times he was forced to use in less than safe surroundings.  The safe and easy surroundings made it harder for him to see or feel that he was indeed in danger even as a privileged white guy. So much so that the delusion kept him waiting on a drug transaction in his car in front of a loud party with a tiny baby incorrectly in a baby seat with the sound of police sirens coming and going close by, continuing to search for his connection and finally make the ultimate of bad choices by still barely noticing that he still had his daughter.  Hard for a guy skating through drug use to see a downside or touch bottom enough for it to create any motivation to quit . In fact his quitting didn't seem to have been motivated by more than a half-hearted sense of entitlement to see his daughter after an unseen stint in rehab (we assume) and a job in polyester fast food uniforms. What a struggle! So glad it was shared. Scared ME straight...oh wait, I already am! Though he didn't make it look half-bad, the idea of a life working in fast food wearing a tiny red paper hat and smelling like fried fish will certainly keep me on the straight and narrow!  Oh No! Not the RED HAT!",1451088000,,1626,4.332236842105263
998449,1,6305260621,This one has to start out with two strangers coupling and making noises like they are constipated in the outhouse.  Tacky.  Probably no substance to this.  Just not worth my time to watch.,1449619200,,188,4.636363636363637

In my opinion, Ben Stiller is completely miscast in this role and I didn't find his portrayal of Jerry Stahl convincing at all.

Personal demons take hold of our main character Jerry. He has what it takes, but ends up throwing it all away to run from what's inside.

This is a side to acting I have never seen from Ben before and he does it well. The rest of the cast plays a shadow to him throughout the film and it may be because there was a lack of story from the other people this autobiography were involved with, or it may be that the story was aimed to show the life of a broken man who was given chance after chance to make the change for the better but never did and ended up alone hurt trying to recover for the rest of his life.

While the story lacks more dimension for the life we're enveloped in what he does. I would recommend seeing it just to have people see what the other end looks like to get a feel for the mind behind an addict. To see that it really is not something people do to hurt others intentionally, but to hurt themselves, or to escape the reality of the thoughts in their mind. To see that no one can really help someone through something and they themselves really need to want help and keep using their support to get through it.",1410825600,,1309,4.129411764705883

It will always become something you can't live without,it starts out as fun but then before you know it you can't get out of bed,eat,sleep,hell you just cannot live unless you get your fix..Then your body takes forever to recover from the damage done,Like the scene where he has sex with Maria Bello and unloads in under five minutes,and says sorry when I was on smack I was a stud,Very very true statement..I know..The quote""I shot smack so I could get up and shave""is very true, like I said earlier you cannot function once you become dependant on opiates..Then you get to see characters that are all to real in the underworld of drug addicts such as Gus(Stahl's dealer which he meets at a methadone clinic)none of them our your freinds and would steal the fillings out of your teeth if they could,but they become your only freinds because they're the only ones also on your level,and you see them more then your best freinds/family because you both only got one goal everyday and that is scoring and fixing. Then before you know it,it's all gone all your money,freinds,family,the woman you love,everything and you've got no one but yourself to thank..All of this is shown very graphically in Permanent midnight,fans of Stiller's comedy will be thrown through a loop,don't get it wrong there is spurts and I mean spurts of dark humor but in order to get it,you kinda have to have been or are an opiate addict. Enough preaching,Just see this overlooked gem of a film..It's got Ben's best performance ever,one of the best performances in the history of film,and by far the best portrayal of a man totally lost and dominated by this horrible disease..Beware tho lots of sex,cussing,and enough IV drug use to make any 80's band's Behind the Music look like a self help video..Just for everyone out there don't pick up the heavy stuff
it will take over your life and it will destroy it,but in bad taste I will say,and I think Stahl would agree if so ""Take passion in everything you do"" and if you need a little bit of gas to get to where your going thats okay to...",1315008000,,2697,4.7282377919320595

Owen Wilson plays the same spaceshot he always plays, and Elizabeth Hurley is a bit miscast as Jerry's wife for the purpose of obtaining a green card.

A typical, L.A. junkie writer who has gotten a piece of fortune and fame and naturally turns to heroin, Ben Stiller delivers a good performance which a lot of people didn't think he could pull off. Elizabeth Hurley and Owen Wilson were both good too but overshadowed by Maria Bello. The movie itself is not great but some of the scenes absolutely were, two in particular. One, when they're throwing their bodies against the glass windows all hopped up and two, when Stiller shoots up in his car with his baby girl in shotgun. Slow pacing and not the strongest story in the world but worth getting lost in for an hour and a half. Long live ALF!",1298419200,,793,4.401360544217687
999033,5,6305260621,"If you still want to do (hardcore) drugs after watching this, then it's Darwin's way of making sure you don't procreate. This was literally one of the first movies put out on DVD - this I know because I was one of the first people to buy a DVD player. (If any of you youngsters saw this thing, you would laugh your [...] off! It was as tall as a standard microwave, as wide as 3 DVD cases [lengthways], and weighed over 100 pounds!! Cost me **$[...]** as well!) Long story short, there were about 30 DVDs at the ""Best-Buy-type-shop"" where I got my monstrosity, and I bought about half of them. (And no, they were so **NOT** cheap - they ranged from $[...] to $[...] and up. And no, I wasn't rich, I was a university student that was depressed because no one got me anything for my birthday, so I kinda blew my student loan, and am still paying it off... 14 years later)

But the movies I did get (Permanent Midnight, Scarface, Doom Generation, Saving Private Ryan, etc.) I watched every little tiny extra/ easter egg/ everything on the disc. The reason I mention that is because the extras really expanded the (already) amazing story. I admit, I was ""hooked"" on Stahl's story from the time I found his memoir. The book shows you that you can go from stealing a few Percodan from your grandma, to shooting heroin into your neck and smoking crack, all while holding down an incredibly high paying job. The movie really emphasizes this - there is no ""moment"" where he goes from being a party guy to being a full out junkie. I realize (as Ben Stiller said when he was on SNL, ""Really? You guys liked Permanent Midnight? Wow - only like 12 people went to see it..."" [later on we find out they weren't cheering for the movie, but for the baseball team standing behind him]) that this was NOT a popular movie, but it is a tragedy that Stiller didn't win an Oscar for this movie. (Especially to lose out to Roberto Benigni! Edward Norton, nominated that year for ""American History X"", could have won and made me quite happy.)
BTW, wayyyyy back in 1998 (when DVDs came out), they thought that DVDs might replace Laserdiscs ONLY; that is, they would be a ""specialty item"" for more ""academic films"". I was reminded of this while looking at the 1998 Oscar List - American History X, Saving Private Ryan, Gods and Monsters, Affliction, The Truman Show, Out Of Sight, The Truman Show, Bulworth - were 8 of the 30 films out on DVD when I went & bought DVDs for the first time.

I do apologize, I realize I'm talking about everything BUT this film. All I can say is GET IT NOW! It was OOP for awhile, but it was reissued very recently, hopefully with more extras! This film will make you NEVER want to use IV drugs, but at the same time it also offers a note of redemption. Jerry Stahl has been clean for 15-some years now; he's into the ""fictional-book-writing-thing"" (having put out 5 or 6); he wrote ""Bad Boys II"" (I know - sometimes you just need the money); I don't watch TV any more, but when I did his name would pop up once in awhile, usually on ""CSI""... and none of the money is going to drugs.

If you're still with me at this point, then you'll care that not EVERY ""star-turned-junkie"" dies of an O.D. Tom Sizemore, who was, for over a decade, the frickin' POSTER BOY for ""he had it all - talent, connections, charisma... but then he pissed it all away for drugs"". As recently as a year or two ago, he was on Celebrity Rehab looking HORRIFIC. Last Sunday (Jan. 23, 2011) he was on C.R. again, but this time as someone who kicked drugs, and is working his [...] off to stay sober and stay in show biz. (And if you DON'T believe me, go to IMDB and see how many projects Sizemore has lined up for 2011).
  Another great example is Samuel L. Jackson. Everything filmed BEFORE 1991's ""Jungle Fever"" is filming a hardcore crackhead. He kicked the habit... right before filming for J.F. was supposed to start. Every one of his counsellors, sponsors, fellow ex-junkies... they all said that if you do this role, you will go back to your crackhead ways. Why? Because he plays a SERIOUSLY bad crackhead in J.F. But, lucky for us, he stayed sober, and if you ask him, he'll tell you, ""I work and work and work and that keeps me away from the crack"". In fact, the movies that Sam was in have made more revenue than the ""body of work"" of ANY other actor out there. It used to be Harrison Ford, because before movie ticket prices went to $[...] a seat, the ""top ten money making movies"" was pretty stable... and Harrison was in 7 of them (the 3 *REAL* Star Wars films; the 3 *REAL* Indiana Jones movies; and one that always escapes my mind).
  However, with current economics (i.e. - $[...] a seat), the sheer fact that Sam Jackson has been in (give or take) 130 movies - some very popular (Pulp Fiction, the 3 *FAKE* Star Wars films, Iron Man 1 & 2, etc.), some not so (basically 5 failed films for every one that hits the $100 million dollar mark). However, I'm sure Sam has enough money to retire, or even to choose to be in not-so-many cheesy flicks, but if churning out film after film after film keeps him sober, keep putting out ""Soul Men"" and ""The Spirit"". I won't see them, but can you ever picture Sam Jackson WITHOUT an acting job? Exactly.

His career and life in general was speeding downward because of his extreme drug use (private and public).

The cast is rounded off by owen Wilson and Genine Gerafalo as well as Elizabeth Hurley.  It is essentially a movie about a writer who goes from small town nobody to big stardom writing for Alf and other 1980s comedy shows, but his downfall comes through heroin addiction.  This is mostly a chronicle of this downfall, his shakes and endless search for another hit.  It is tragic but eventually the viewer stops caring, his life is not so interesting and it is not that compelling a story.  It is mostly just depressing, wathcing Stahl be arrested while driving high with his child in the seat next to him.

999039,3,6305260621,"This little movie, ""Permanent Midnight,"" almost makes it.  I had a four-star review going for it right until the final scene where what could have been a capstone moment, simply misses the mark. When Brad Delp, God rest his soul, former lead singer of Boston belts out in ""Peace of Mind"",""Now everybody's got advice they just keep on givin' / Doesn't mean too much to me / Lot's of people out to make believe their livin' / Can't decide who they should be,"" I think he must have had a movie like ""Permanent Midnight"" in mind.  The movie really has an identity crisis going...is it a redemptive tale, is it a cautionary tale that screams drugs just aren't all that great, or is it a love story?  The last scene where Jerry Stahl, aptly played by Ben Stiller, leaves one lost wishing that the movie had at least been one of those stories...not vainly attempting, and failing, to be all of them.

The movie is cool enough.  The soundtrack is steady, not stellar.  Does it glamorize the LA drug scene?  Not really.  When Stiller's character shoots up heroin again and again in bathroom stalls or wherever he can score a hit, and then sprays the bloody backwash from the needle over the bathroom ceiling the message is pretty clear...no one you know, love, care about should be coming any where near the drug scene.  Heroin and any other addictive illegal substances (and some legal ones too) has this innate potential to completely and utterly destroy lives.  As a drug movie, ""Permanent Midnight,"" falls just short of telling the tale of complete and other woe.  Movies that come to mind that really hit home the cautionary aspect of powerful anti-drug messaging are, ""Requiem for a Dream,"" which has several scenes that want to make you look away from the screen; Steven Soderbergh's excellent social and political commentary on America's drug war and drug culture, ""Traffic,"" and lastly but not leastly the movie with Nicolas Cage and Elizabeth Shue in Las Vegas where Cage ends up drinking himself right to death.  Those films work.  Those films are clear in their message, powerful in their story.  ""Permanent Midnight,"" starts to work on several levels but ultimately falls short in them all.

Ben Stiller turns in a very engaging performance as the Jewish writer, brilliant in his writing, but with a habit the size of ""Utah.""  When I first read that on the jacket descriptor...""the size of Utah,"" I thought it might be one of those Mormon-themed flicks that seem to be so popular of the last 2-3 years...but alas, ""Permanent Midnight,"" has really nothing to do with Mormons and everything to do with drugs and love.  Elizabeth Hurley is well Elizabeth Hurley.  Maria Bello is one of the finest actresses out there continuing to score in powerful roles in minor films so her career flies under the radar but she seems to pick and choose roles that work for her.  If the movie were a redemptive love story where Bello's ex-junky character creates some true catharsis for Stahl I would have been right there.  But as it is...I say look somewhere else film buffs for your love story, drug story, and ultra cool hip story.  ""Permanent Midnight,"" tries to be all these things in doses but in the end leaves you searching for blue veins...not with needles mind you but to find a pulse.  ...mmw",1175126400,2,3290,4.715034965034965
999040,3,6305260621,"Movies rarely hold the same allure as the books from which they arise and that's the case here. ""Permanent Midnight"" portrays the harrowing experinece of a television script writer that was also a heroin addict.

Ben Stiller stars as Jerry Stahl, whose autobiography is the basis for the film. Stahl appears in a brief role as a physician treating his own (through Stiller) addiction. This is an interesting insofar as the physician -- the real life drug addict -- is very downbeat about Stiller's chance of kicking heroin for its substitute.

Elsewhere, a lot of today's A-list actors -- Owen Wilson (who had a middle initial in the credits), Maria Bello (who got great reviews in ""A History of Violence""), Elizabeth Hurley, Sandra Oh, Cheryl Ladd and Jeanene Garofolo -- lend a lot of credibility to this episodic treatment. Probably most riveting, and most revolting, are Stiller's regular scenes of drug use...during breaks in meetings at work, in the bathroom during parties, while taking care of his child. In another scene, he interviews for a job with a TV producer while high. The flick concludes with sound bytes from interviews Stahl did with TV talking heads (Morey and Tom Snyder) with Stiller digitally added to the scene.

I thought Stiller transformed himself into a serious actor for the role and the good supporting cast clearly helps; still the film is too episodic to score higher than average. This biopic is mature fare and sometimes very difficult to watch, especially a scene where Stiller, in the car with an infant, mainlines heroin through a vein in his neck. It also loses points since none of the actors show any signs of age as its chronology progresses.

Still, there's often something interesting going on or something you probably haven't seen before by such name actors. There was a lot more drug use here than in ""Trainspotting"" where the cast was compprised 100 percent of heroin addicts. So check this out if you're up to it; you might find it rewarding.",1168387200,8,1991,4.881656804733728
999106,3,6305260621,"Admittedly I'm guessing here, but it would seem that the lurid fascination of drug-themed films has diminished considerably in recent years.  Or if I can only speak for myself, I guess I can say that their fascination for me has dwindled.  When PERMANENT MIDNIGHT came out (to mixed reviews) in 1998, I made a mental note that, while I probably wouldn't want to pay theater prices to see the movie, I'd make a point to catch it when it came out on video.

Well, it's taken me over five years to get around to finally seeing it.  Whether it was those mixed reviews or the fact that films about substance abuse have lost their ability to shock--or for that matter, to illuminate--I can't say.  But this is one case where the (majority of the) critics had pretty much gotten it right.  The movie IS worth seeing--mainly for the acting and for a few startlingly effective scenes--but it's probably not a must-see and certainly not a ""must own"" for most viewers.

As a supposed ""breakthrough"" role for Ben Stiller, the results are also kind of mixed.  Yes, he did pull off this demanding role, impressively so; and no, he hasn't done all that much dramatically since.  He's been in some very good films (ROYAL TENENBAUMS,especially) but hasn't had the chance to stretch significantly since PERMANENT MIDNIGHT.  That's a shame, but that's also show biz.  He keeps working, at least.

The rest of the cast is also impressive.  Elizabeth Hurley also gets a chance to prove her acting ability for once, and Maria Bello who perhaps is still best known for her years on ER, is pretty impressive in an underwritten role.  (She's essentially a framing device with a heart of gold.)  Owen Wilson is always worth watching. (Am I the only one who thinks he looks like a young, blond Dennis Hopper?  If anyone ever wanted to do a father-son junkie movie, they'd make for perfect casting.)  Janeane Garofalo and Cheryl Ladd make effective cameo appearances. And there's even a pre-GLADIATOR Connie Nielsen on board here as a rich German junkie who seems to revel in ""making love"" to a Jew.

It's all a little disjointed, which given the story's source is a recovering junkie, makes a certain dramatic sense.  Subplots--some kind of intriguing--are introduced, only to remain undeveloped.  (I was curious, for instance, as to just how and when that marriage of convenience to Liz Hurley's character developed into a love match.)  That kind of sketchiness also makes a certain kind of druggy sense.

I guess if you want the details, you need to check out the Jerry Stahl memoir on which the film is based.  That is of course one measure by which we can evaluate any film from an unfamiliar literary source (and I must confess that I had never heard of the book before--leastwise not that I recall).  If the film makes the viewer want to read the book, then it's more than done its job.

PERMANENT MIDNIGHT isn't a bad film.  On the other hand, it did not make me want to read the book.",1133654400,2,2965,4.664739884393064

999108,4,6305260621,"In PERMANENT MMIDNIGHT, director David Veloz smooths out the hard edges from Jerry Stahl's riveting autobiography of the same name.  Obviously he was going to try for some casting surprises, so a gang of comedians are brought in and asked to play serious parts, and if they're note funny comics, they're supermodels trying to act.  The spectacle of all these people trying to ""act seriously"" pushes the movie over the edge into spectacle; but that's better than your average movie which doesn't offer any spectacle at all.

Maria Bello tries to prove there's more to her than drop-dead gorgeousness on the Cybill Shepherd line.  Verdict?  Not in just yet.  In subsequent movies Ms. Bello has shown that she's competent, and in one or two something more, but here she doesn't especially impress.  Elizabeth Hurley looks beautiful, and actually manages to achieve a state of peevishness that looks convincing; maybe the director told her that her L'Oreal ration was being suspended.  And even Cheryl Ladd, top model of another era, is somehow squeezed into the movie I guess to remind us that in Hollywood, even tiny parts are filled by the good-looking.  The trouble is, this is something we found out years from Burt Bacharach songs: ""And all the stars/ that never were/ are parking cars or pumping gas.""  Such as Janeane Garofalo who made quite a few movies and then disappeared from the screen after Dennis Kucinich's candidacy sank like a stone.

The other point of PERMANENT MIDNIGHT is that heroin is bad for you and hurts the family structure.  However the hegemony of the US cinema by twin Pleaides Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson will never be destroyed, and their friendship here is a thing of intense contemplation.  Long ago they decided that each one was the psychic twin of the other, and ten movies later, they have outlasted Hepburn and Tracy as the screen's great love team.

It was like they were both big loser junkies trying to be big loser non-junkies together.  I really hoped that everything would work out between them.  But in the movie, I just really couldn't stand their relationship.  I just kept thinking, ""Jerry/Ben, get rid of her.  She's stupid, and she just doesn't unerstand you and your pain.  Forget her.""

Ben Stiller gives the best performence of his  career in this true story of TV writer jerry stahl's life and how he  screwed it all up by using drugs. Some of the moments are genuinly funny  ,others disturbing,and others sad. I haven't read the book but I've heard  it's even better. Awesome soundtrack too.

999177,5,6305260621,"Heroin.  Opiates.  Addiction.  Recovery.  For those who have faced such  challenges, PM is a movie that rings true in almost every aspect.  For  those whose lives have not been affcted by the ravages of drug addiction,  the movie offers a dramatic portrayel of Jerry Stahl, a writer known for  his work on the TV show ""ALF.""  Stahl was a writer with, a term  often overused, an edge.  His words drip with bite, secrete venom in their  descriptive prowess, and ultimately combine to bring about the writer's  crash into addiction.  Stahl moves to LA, where he gets a writing job,  makes alot of money, in fact way too much money for a writer with a habit,  and falls very rapidly downt he black hole of drug addiction.  In the  darkness, however, we also see the light of recovery, which is handled in a  true to life manner, displaying the sheer difficulty in dealing with the  insanity of addiciton.  Ben Stiller is excellent, adding dry comic wit to  even the most disturbing of scenes.  And there is a show stealing  performance by Peter Greene, who has been in many movies, including The  Mask, Pulp Fiction, and most reently Blue Streak, with Martin Lawrence.  Permanent Midnight stands on par with Drugstore Cowboy and The Basketball  Diaries in allowing the public an inside view into the harrowing, humerous,  and heart wrenching world of heroin.  The movie is a loaded syringe, ready  to strike into the most virgin of veins: Mainstream Movie America.  It is  so good, you will come back for it again and again.",960249600,,1520,4.7011494252873565
999178,4,6305260621,"I thought Stiller gave a credible impression here. Granted it was spotty in a few places, but most of the performance was first rate. I think Stiller has a future in dramatic roles and I am glad that this roll may  keep him from being type-cast.
Peter Greene was creepy in a very  believable way. Janeane did a fantastic job as the intimacy-challanged  agent -- ""You're coming back, right?"" Maria Bello provided a good  depth and range to her character.
The movie has enough subtlety and  depth that a second viewing is probably a good idea. I certainly enjoyed it  more the second time. Most of the characters were acted with more restraint  than we have become accustomed to and this may explain why the movie  becomes more enriched with repeated viewings.
But it was the music that  put the hook in me. I went out and bought my first Crystal Method and first  William Orbit CDs after watching this movie.",955411200,,907,4.577639751552795
999179,4,6305260621,"Hello, My Name is ..., and I have never shot Heroin.  I fear the needle (ignore the tattoo) and fail to relish in the sadistic reactions to the drug. However, were I to awaken to a new day of increased favor towards  needles and IV drug use, the viewing of this film, and the performance  handed to us by Ben Stiller, has already assured me that I shan't dive into  the abyss of said narcotic.  You hate to use words live  ""riveting"" and ""brilliant"", although clearly at ease  with his psychotic side, Stiller makes me believe that a man would attempt  to crash through a window post ""drug-induced-euphoria"". One  wishes Janeane Garofalo had a few more moments on-screen, but what she  added was probably enough.  I haven't read the book (an oddity for me,  actually), but I fear that I shall quite soon.  I was drawn into the story  from the get-go, though I wonder if that was due to the shooting by Veloz,  or by Stiller.  Either way, this ""dark comedy (from whence that title  came, I am still unsure)"" darkened my day, and caused a bit of thought  to occur - never a bad thing.",953683200,7,1082,4.406091370558376

Ben impressed me with his range here, and I have to say, he  sure looks like he's used before. Janeane Garofolo makes her mandatory  cameo as an agent who won't take ""Who cares"" for an answer. He  lands a stint as a writer on the TV show ""Mr. Chompers"" which  seems to be ""Alf"" in disguise. His uncontrolled freneticism gets  him fired after a few episodes however. Stiller is an amazingly realistic  desperate druggy in this dark tragedy. But there doesn't seem to be a  morale to the story. So, as I said, what's the point?",934329600,,678,4.333333333333333
