3876067,5,B002945DX4,"I am so very impressed by this series.
These 2 writers have managed to create something that American Comedy used to do in the 70's; manage to obtain the holy grail of comedy.
Creating a show that is funny as hell and still have social relevance.

I loved Absolutely Fabulous for its' sheer wit and 'over-the-top' characters.
But this series manages to take a real topic, exagerate it just abit and show us how silly we can be as a species.
WELL DONE LADIES!",1291248000,6,458,4.4523809523809526
3876068,3,B002945DX4,"I could have done with the 'F' word being said half as much
It was interesting and funny too
Nothing to get your panties in a bunch over, but glad to watch and pass it on to a friend",1286668800,4,182,3.6923076923076925
3876069,4,B002945DX4,"Everybody loves a good juicy comedy about how stupid and shallow the world of celebrity/showbiz is, but few of them have any real wit. One of the few exceptions is ""The Life and Times of Vivienne Vyle,"" a deliciously intelligent, razor-edged black comedy that pulls few punches... and even better, it has Jennifer Saunders as the love-to-hate-her TV host.

Vivienne Vyle (Saunders) is a daytime TV host who specializes in shows like ""My Son Calls The Wrong Man 'Daddy',"" overseen by her insane, frazzled producer Helena de Wend (Miranda Richardson). Then during a show, she's assaulted by a guest and a large security guard accidentally falls on her head. She also almost has a breakdown, leading a psychiatrist to be assigned to follow her during her work.

Having gotten a sudden burst of fame from her accident, Vivienne decides that she wants to take her show to the next level -- she tries to talk to the audience, has a disastrous interview with a tabloid reporter, wins ""Best Daytime Talk Show"" (only to ditch the awards ceremony), and suffers from an attack of ""success."" But being a host also means that her gay husband Jared (Conleth Hill) comes under scrutiny...

In case you're wondering, ""The Life and Times of Vivienne Vyle"" is not merely a showbiz version of ""Absolute Fabulous."" It's more like ""The Office"" -- a witty Britcom without a laugh track or punchlines -- but instead of looking at the world of commerce, it's focused on the entertainment world in all its sleazy shallow glory.

And just about everything on popular TV is mocked -- the bottom-feeding themes, the stars insulated from ""real life,"" the pathetic people who humiliate themselves on TV for a few seconds of vulgar fame. The dry sense of humor permeates the entire series (Jared's attempts to fix the plumbing) and there's plenty of darkly mocking dialogue (""Why haven't we started the production meeting?!"" ""Because you weren't HERE."" ""Does everything have to fall apart because I'm not here?"" ""You're the PRODUCER"").

The main problem with this show, however, is that it isn't entirely sure whether it wants to be a dry comedy or a drama. Most of the time it's darkly funny, but there are stretches that are just bleak (Jonathan talking about encountering the children of junkies) or pure belly-laugh (Vivienne having a musical hallucination).

Jennifer Saunders is probably one of the few great comedians of our times, and she succeeds in making Vivienne more than a caricature. Yes, she's an egotistical, ambitious, bratty woman who sees nothing odd about having a fifteen-foot photo of herself wallpapered in her apartment, but somehow Saunders makes you like her despite that, particularly during some touching moments with Jared.

Richardson is gloriously ditzy, dizzy and eccentric, a career woman who's getting nothing done (her kid only speaks Spanish and thinks the nanny is her mom) and always looks like she just rolled out of bed. Hill is rather sweet as Vyle's insanely patient husband, although I never figured out why she married a gay guy.

""The Life and Times of Vivienne Vyle"" is a satirical, biting show that sometimes vacillates between drama and comedy, but is still deliciously warped anyway. Not a comedy for people who like pratfalls and silly faces.",1279065600,16,3262,4.972477064220183
3876070,5,B002945DX4,"I really enjoyed this new six-episode series. Jennifer plays a daytime talk show host a la Jerry Springer- tacky and sensational. Her guests are the dregs of society and she showers them with abuse with the stated purpose of helping them. The real purpose being to generate ratings, of course. The series is full of Saunders' trademark dry wit spiced up with occassional camp pratfalls. She's even meaner than Edina Monsoon, though, which took a couple of minutes to get used to. I also enjoyed the supporting players. Her relationship with her gay husband is fun to watch, and in the sixth episode, there is a heart -touching (well, sort of) twist. If you like Jennifer Saunders (I LOVE Jennifer Saunders), you will enjoy this.",1262563200,10,728,4.832
3876071,4,B002945DX4,"Although this may not be for everyone, Vivienne Vyle presented us with an entertaining satire of American fascination with talk shows and celebrity through UK eyes. Jennifer Saunders was great, but thank god for volume control and the subtitled options. Very British in regards to the mumbling and undiscernable language. LOVED IT.",1260662400,4,331,5.384615384615385
3876072,5,B002945DX4,"First saw this on a Delta First Class flight out of Milan, Italy.  Never heard of it until I pressed the button for the show's viewing, and--well, I had to watch twice the one and only episode Delta offered.  Hilarious, daring, and sarcastically biting.  Loved it.  Bought the entire disc upon my return to the States, and thankfully Amazon, as always, comes through with every title you might dream of obtaining.  Great show.",1252022400,17,426,4.780821917808219
3876073,5,B002945DX4,"This is black comedy, a devastatingly funny, satiric look at ""reality"" TV a la Jerry Springer, with crazed guests and equally crazed backstage doings at a TV show.  Jennifer Saunders is sensational, and all others in the marvelous cast are also brilliant.  Each episode of the six can be enjoyed by itself, but it's best to see them all in sequence.  The last episode is the best half-hour I've ever seen on TV.",1250726400,33,411,4.602739726027397

3876081,5,B002945DX4,"I LOVE Jennifer Saunders - I would watch her in anything I must admit. She is hilarious and has an excellent supporting cast. Very funny, yet poignant message in this series.  Jennifer Saunders is a comic GENIUS!",1466208000,,212,4.72972972972973

3876084,4,B002945DX4,"I have always been a fan of AbFab and when I saw this I had to check it out. It' funny, but not as funny as Absolutely Fabulous series. But a good watch if you are a fan of BBC comedy and Jennifer Saunders and her work. She is Absolutely Fabulous. P.",1457568000,,250,3.826923076923077

3876088,4,B002945DX4,An excellent series starring Jennifer Saunders post-AbFab.  It's not very long and should have continued.,1417219200,,105,6.0
3876089,4,B002945DX4,"For those who can't get enough of 'Absolutely Fabulous' this short-lived series is the next best thing. Jennifer Saunders is in top form as the vitriolic TV talk show hostess whose life onscreen is only matched by her personal life. At first I thought her character's last name, Vivienne Vyle, was a pun on 'vile' but I read that it's actually based on Jeremy Kyle, a  real in-your-face talk show host. Take the worst aspect of every talk show host rolled into one and you have Vivienne in all her tainted glory.

There's plenty of behind the scenes stuff that will remind you of 'Ab Fab' as well as Vyle's home life. Miranda Richardson's role as her pushy producer gets to be a bit repetitious but she and her underlings will keep you chuckling. The sixth and last episode takes a dark turn as Vyle's homosexual husband (or is he bi?) gets in trouble when a reporter learns he attended a party where a rent boy (English for young male prostitute) died but leave it to the resourceful Vyle to save the day for everyone.

There's plenty of profanity and sometimes the English accents are hard to understand especially when people talk fast so I recommend you run the subtitles when watching the episodes. This series is a must for those who dislike or love sleazy talk shows and miss the nasty barbs of Patsy and Edina.",1411948800,,1318,4.552742616033755

3876094,2,B002945DX4,"This is a puzzling series; Saunders plays a rather nasty talk show host whose schtick is berating her guests (""You disgust me, and most of my audience!""); this premise could have been a lot of fun but falls pretty flat. The subplot of ""Viv's"" marriage to a flamboyant toady never really takes off either; while there was a chance for high camp reminiscent of Ab Fab, the moxy isn't there and the whole thing fails to deliver the laughs I would have expected. A harmless but charmless show which you probably won't watch more than once.",1397779200,3,535,4.583333333333333
3876095,4,B002945DX4,Funny and witty some episodes lampoon how the real talk shows would try anything for ratings if you like Jennifer Saunders this one is for you.,1397606400,,143,4.538461538461538
3876096,5,B002945DX4,"Another example pf how UK television beats the cinema offerings hands down. Witty, clever and tells the truth about trash TV and manipulation of the viewer. We should be thankful for Jennifer Saunders and for those who backed her in this work.",1396569600,2,243,4.809523809523809
3876097,4,B002945DX4,It is Jennifer Saunders so you can probably guess the feel of the show. There is a good bit of Eddie in Vivienne though in places you see a strength you would not expect from Eddie. It gets a bit too real / on the nose in spots but if you like AbFab you will enjoy this as well.,1393459200,,278,3.7288135593220337

3876100,4,B002945DX4,"Excellent. Yes, lots of the fearsome ""f"" word, but those who complain about it are missing the joke. It is a running gag! Part of the overall horrid nature of all of the characters, one might say. Saunders is just fantastic. Buy it and be prepared for some very edgy, very pessimistic humor from characters you can't help but hate. Not for kids!",1365465600,4,345,4.492063492063492
3876101,5,B002945DX4,"This was a pretty good show. The first 2 episodes weren't that great because I guess Jennifer Saunders wanted to set the whole story of her character up, but after the first few episodes the show gets really good. There are some extremely hilarious moments, dark moments, and heartwarming moments. It's really too bad it only lasted 1 season because I would have loved to see more.",1358208000,3,381,4.701492537313433

3876103,4,B002945DX4,"Jennifer came up with a good character! Vivienne Vyle. She is a talk show host with lot's of things to say to people. Lot's of f-words. Vivienne Vyle could go on forever. She is a character that is ballzy and offers her own view on different subjects. It does miss something! Other than that, you can really enjoy Vivienne!

3876107,5,B002945DX4,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this dvd.  I purchased it because I have enjoyed almost everything I have seen Jennifer Saunders star in.  This series was no disappointment.  It's a morose comedy which follows the life of a talk show hostess striving to cope with her own life, which, at times appears to be as dysfunctional as the lives of her talk show guests.  She is a vile woman; arrogant, mean spirited, selfish, and constantly stands in judgement of the people who come to her show for help with their lives.  The writing and acting is superb, and it is always interesting to watch a 'show within a show.'  I hope that there is another series.",1307232000,4,652,4.483050847457627
