1810198,1,B00007GZRU,"I was so disappointed with this dvd. I expected it to have better animation and thought the stories would be fun for my three year old daughter who loves Hello Kitty stuff. I guess I didn't know what to expect and now will not buy anymore Hello Kitty DVDs. She hates it and I really didn't like it much myself. There is no intro into the movie, it just kind of starts..no song, no nothing. Very odd.",1254096000,2,399,4.194805194805195

--------------------------------------------------

For those who don't already know, contained on this DVD are stories from the 1987 Saturday morning series ""Hello Kitty's Furry Tale Theater"".  You wouldn't know that by watching the disc because there are NO SERIES OPENING TITLES and NO SERIES END CREDITS!!!  Yes, you read that correctly.  They left out one of the most significant parts of a television series.  Remember the catchy theme song?  Well, all you'll have are your memories because that theme won't be found here.  There's a credits block on the back of the case that lists the voice actors and major crew, but it doesn't list the minor crew members.  Pity all of the poor animators whose work on the series now goes uncredited.

The series consists of 13 half-hour episodes with 2 stories per episode (26 stories total).  Yet only 25 of the 26 stories appear on these five discs.  Keep in mind that's only 5 stories per each 10.00 disc (that's the original price).  They could have easily fit the entire series onto two dual-layer discs for 20.00.  So not only are you missing a story, and NOT getting the episodes in their original 2-story pairs with the original series opening titles and end credits, but you're being bilked for what little you DO get!

The previous VHS releases in the late 1990s (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wizard-of-Paws-VHS/dp/0792838394/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wizard of Paws VHS</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kitty-The-Beast-VHS/dp/0792838386/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kitty & The Beast VHS</a>) were MUCH better than these five DVDs.  Sure they only included four stories each, but they included the series opening titles and end credits, which makes them a vast improvement over these DVDs.  I can only hope that someone at MGM wakes up and re-releases this series as a proper ""complete series"" set, but I doubt that that will ever happen.",1223683200,2,3862,7.4298245614035086
1810200,5,B00007GZRU,This was purchased for a grandmother to watch with her grand children.  The grandmother is having as much fun with Hello Kitty as the grand children are.,1187913600,,153,4.666666666666667
1810201,4,B00007GZRU,"This is a cute DVD for children. My son and daughter watch it over and over. Its a little silly and goofy in some parts, but its entertaining for young people. It's cute how they retell the classic fairy tales in ""Hello Kitty"" style.",1176336000,,233,4.318181818181818
1810202,5,B00007GZRU,The only thing I can tell you regarding this DVD is that it must be great.  My  21/2 year old granddaughter loves it.  She is constantly watching Kitty as she calls it and has picked up a great deal from the clips.,1168732800,,214,4.0476190476190474
1810203,4,B00007GZRU,"The cartoons are from the 1980's Hello Kitty tv series ""Hello Kitty's Furry Tale Theater,"" which are variations on popular fairy tales/movies. They feature Hello Kitty, My Melody, Tuxedo Sam, Chip, Catnip & Grinder, who are actors in the theatre.

Each DVD contains 5 fairy tales, and each fairy tale is about 10 minutes long and has its own unique take on the familiar stories.  They are also changed to be less violent, nicer and more suited for children (water balloon fights instead of guns).

The quality of the DVD's are more like TV broadcast quality and this is the reason I've given it 4 stars instead of 5. I think they could've enhanced the quality before putting it onto DVD.  It is also not recorded in stereo sound.  I already owned the 2 Furry Tale Theater VHS's (Kitty and the Beast, The Wizard of Paws), so I already knew what to expect.

I'm an adult Sanrio collector and I loved seeing these episodes, and I would feel good about letting my children see these too.

The following is the list of the episodes in this DVD:

""Hello Kitty Becomes a Princess"" has Kitty and the Beast, Snow White Kitty and the One Dwarf, Sleeping Kitty, CinderKitty, and KittyLocks and the Three Bears.",1119398400,25,1199,4.596244131455399
1810204,2,B00007GZRU,"Please notice the cover says for ages 2-5 - my 8yo daughter, who loves Hello Kitty, does not like this series from MGM.  That's all the review I need, but I watched it anyway.  It's cheaply done cartoon style is more reminiscent of the Saturday Morning cartoons from the 80s than the Hello Kitty my family knows and loves!  I would avoid this title.",1062547200,6,349,4.421875

1810219,5,B00007GZRU,"My grand-daughters Love anything Hello Kitty---clothes, books, DVD's, backpacks, pencils, purses, anything!  Most Hello Kitty items R a little overpriced; but, they will outgrow Hello Kitty in a short period of time ;0",1387238400,,218,5.606060606060606
1810220,3,B00007GZRU,This was a good video for little ones. once again over rated by Hello Kitty. Would not purchase Hello Kitty items again.,1380931200,,120,4.5
1810221,5,B00007GZRU,"I grew up loving Hello Kitty, and remember seeing some of these cartoons as a child.  My daughter thinks Hello Kitty is just awesome, and loves these little cartoons.  I need to buy her more!",1370649600,,191,4.428571428571429
1810222,1,B00007GZRU,"I'm unfamiliar with the Hello Kitty cartoons and am just familiar with all the cute Hello Kitty things you can get in the stores.  I was very surprised when I started watching this DVD and all the characters seemed to hate each other.  The only tolerable one was Hello Kitty, but she does not seem to be in the stories as much as the other characters.  Unlike other kids videos where bad behavior is pointed out by the other characters and frowned upon, these whiny characters just go on calling each other names to no end and threatening to hurt each other.  I spent most of the time talking to my daughter about how not to behave.  Not a DVD that I want my child to see often since it's kinda like getting stuck with the most annoying kids or people and not being able to escape.  Maybe other Hello Kitty videos aren't like this one, but I really don't recommend it for 2-5 year olds like it says it is geared towards on the front.  I'd give this less than one star if I could, and I really don't know if I will give Hello Kitty another chance.",1361664000,5,1046,4.226130653266332
1810223,5,B00007GZRU,My Grandaughter realling like this movie. It was clear. great quality. Very pleased with this purchase. Would reccommend this buyer,1358726400,,131,5.6
1810224,2,B00007GZRU,"Not what I expected. Did not care for it, and my granddaughter, who loves Hello Kitty and Princesses, didn't even watch it past the first couple of minutes.",1358467200,3,156,4.607142857142857
1810225,4,B00007GZRU,The remote to our dvd player quit working and cannot navigate to the other episodes so we have only watched the first one.  I wish the first option was to watch all episodes!,1358380800,,174,4.2727272727272725
1810226,5,B00007GZRU,I ordered this for my little cousin for Christmas. She just started liking Hello Kitty and she loved this movie.,1357344000,,112,4.65
1810227,5,B00007GZRU,I ordered this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it! Not a bad show at all. Shipping was quick and the packaging was outstanding.,1329782400,,136,4.48
1810228,5,B00007GZRU,"My daughters love princesses, and they were excited to get this DVD.  They adore Hello Kitty and like to watch this DVD on occasion.  However, the stories are not exactly like the originals.  Cinder Kitty is similar to Cinderella but very loosely follows the original story line.  My daughter was slightly disappointed that the complete stepsisters (there's just one stepsister)/ball concept wasn't part of this version like it was in the original, but it's still a cute story.  There's football and not dancing.  There's a shoe and not a slipper to fit.  Still the basic ideas are similar to the originals, just updated a bit (e.g., watch Cinder Kitty compete in athletic events!).  If your child can appreciate the different versions of the original fairy tales (modified in different ways from the original stories), she should appreciate this DVD.",1323907200,,851,5.071942446043166
1810229,4,B00007GZRU,My four-year-old daughter has almost worn out this DVD.  She loves it.  Very cute not educational at all...just pure entertainment.,1323216000,,131,5.5
1810230,1,B00007GZRU,"I've been aware of Hello Kitty for nearly 30 years and have always thought of her as a marketing idea more than an actual character, because really, where's the cartoon? No comic strip, no movie, but she's everywhere cuting the place up. I have no problem with that and think she's super cute. Naturally I steered my daughter toward her.

So we're walking through Target and see her movie. I hadn't heard of it and that alone tells me it's a bad sign. I mean, if it was any good shouldn't it be the thing that launches a thousand more Kitties? I've passed it by several times but my very little daughter convinced me it was worth the meager investment.

I popped it in and the titles seemed adorable enough. Each story started with the line 'Once upon a meow...', OK, I'm along for the ride... and there it ends. The next thing you know there's some evil cat in the spotlight calling HK a creep (literally) and some dopey dog who can't find his a$$ from a hand grenade. Each episode turns dark and lays the attitude on pretty thick. You barely even SEE Hello Kitty. So I'm wondering who in the world wrote this? Who let this one get made? It's terrible. It's nothing like HK should be. There's nothing cute about it. It is repulsive and I will be getting rid of it tomorrow. It just really gets me that there was such a HUGE opportunity to really have fun and make such a cute kids cartoon and instead we get bad animation and characters who have nothing in common with the fun, cute, artful ones we see all over the place. Such a waste.",1313366400,17,1537,4.333333333333333
1810231,4,B00007GZRU,"My 4yr old daughter loves this collection.  The actual animation is old, but she doesn't mind at all! It has the option to watch all, or just individually which is nice, and there's not a lot of previews before it starts as with other DVDs.  Nice collection of short episodes.",1312934400,,276,4.5
1810232,5,B00007GZRU,"Overall I am happy with the sender: I got my order very fast, without any damages.
This is my first purchase of Kitty cartoons. The DVD  containes 6 fairy tales adapted to the main character (Kitty is starring) and other actors - Kitty's friends. All stories shown as a theatre performances. This new look to the old classic fary tales is unic and refreshing idea, all stories are interesting both for adults and kids 4-10 y.o",1288915200,,426,4.605263157894737
1810233,5,B00007GZRU,My Granddaughter had lost her tape between Indiana and Georgia and I know she dearly loves it but maybe we'll run into somewhere. It was here in good time but poor little thing just can't find it. Sorry it was no fault of yours. So she's sooo sorry I couldn't write a review. She had picked it out cause she had seen it so much she wore the other one out. Thanks anyway for having it here. She was excited until she lost it. Jayne,1272067200,,430,4.070588235294117

7976481,1,B00007GZRU,My daughter LOVES Hello a Kitty. And princesses. So I thought this would be great for her third birthday. This is a horrible fake version of Hello Kitty. Doesn't sound or look like any of the other DVDs I have of Hello Kitty. I now see there are different companies that make Hello Kitty DVDs. This was an absolute waste of money.
