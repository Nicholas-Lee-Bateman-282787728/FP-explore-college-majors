3433219,5,B0019D31NK,I have loved this movie since I first saw it waaaaaay back when....have really enjoyed seeing it again...and of course the music is great.,1480982400,,138,4.791666666666667
3433220,4,B0019D31NK,"a nice little story about two  runaways who fall in love and end up having a baby together,the acting isn't bad for 2 young teens the movie itself is very dated but the saving grace is the beautiful scenery and the fantastic early ELTON JOHN soundtrack.i has  a BLUE LAGOON feel to it. Ienjoyed it for what it was.",1480636800,,314,4.305084745762712
3433221,2,B0019D31NK,"A friend of mine wanted me to see this in the worse way, I sat thru it along side her as she displayed a look of contentment and wanderlust. I on the other hand couldn't wait for this movie to end. Slow, bland acting in a total teenage fantasy with an ending that comes from a writer with suddenly nothing else to say. The only thing good about this movie was the soundtrack, early Elton John, can't go wrong with that.",1476230400,,419,4.185185185185185

3433223,5,B0019D31NK,I saw this movie when I was 17. It became my favorite love story. I heard it was shown on HBO in 1980's but I missed it. Never thought I would ever see it again. Finally a chance to buy it so I did. I have since converted it on DVD so I have it forever.,1468022400,,253,3.5357142857142856
3433224,4,B0019D31NK,A simple excellent coming of age story with some very adult implications. Nicely acted and great EJ soundtrack.,1465257600,,111,5.222222222222222
3433225,5,B0019D31NK,"A classic lost gem from 1971, brilliantly directed by Lewis Gilbert.  Known primarily for the brilliant score by Elton John, this story was told with the utmost honesty, and touches on the true meaning of love and levels of the human spirit rarely explored by any film released in today's world.  The visual symbolism is subtle and tastefully navigates its way through the emotional and sensual paradise of these two young lovers. FRIENDS pleases the viewer on every level with raw imagery, tangible characters, provocative innocence, as it takes you on a journey of true love, and the elusive meaning of happiness.  A fantastic film.",1462233600,,634,5.019047619047619

3433227,5,B0019D31NK,"The movie moves me today as much as it did in 71. At that age (18), I didn't expect a cinematic tour de force, I simply enjoyed the movie for what it was at the time, and it's memory has stayed with me since. As with most things of beauty, it's very simple, really - look too hard... and it will disappear. It also mirrors a relationship I had with someone I met at that age (the love of my life), lost for 42 years, and have since reunited with. I won't make that mistake again...",1456358400,,481,4.020833333333333

3433260,5,B0019D31NK,"Saw this movie when it first came out.  Of course the music by Elton John and Bernie Taupin were some of the best parts but after watching it again after many decades, I really enjoyed it.  The ending left me wanting so much more for this young couple!  Don't want to spoil it in case others decide to watch it.  The soundtrack is awesome if you especially liked Elton John back in the early days (early 70's)",1439164800,,409,4.2727272727272725

3433264,5,B0019D31NK,I saw the the original release of this film when i was 15 In Great Britain in 1969 . I was coming of age and i have to say that this was a very powerful romance film for my very first romance film. I cried at the end when it ended knowing that the father was going to find the boy and take him home. And now i have to say that there has never been a film as good as this. This is a classic and i am surprised it is still available. I saw the Blue Lagoon many years latter and it just was too typical Hollywood. The actors in Friends were excellent. The story increasingly realistic. The cinematography was great. As if it was taken by a professional still photographer. A beautiful coming of age film done in the beautiful countryside of France. When I came back to the US and it came out some years later i saw it like 5 times . . .  .,1433376000,,836,3.9176470588235293

3433287,5,B0019D31NK,"I saw this movie when I was a kid and thought how cool would that be and then saw the hard work he had to do to stay there with her and learned a lesson as a youngster, I enjoyed it just as much 40 years later and enjoyed hearing the Elton John, Bernie Tappin sound track, still waiting for that to come out in a affordable CD sound track. So sorry to hear that the actress that played Michelle died of cancer at 53. Watching it and an older man it almost felt like child porn with the 14 and a 1/2 girl finding out she was 17 when she played that part, still very young even though if she were alive now she would be 60. This is a movie that made me remember true love and filling young again.",1391904000,,694,3.8943661971830985

3433291,4,B0019D31NK,"I only saw this movie advertised once at a drive-in when it originally came out (actually, two years after, but I was too young to get in due to the ""R"" rating), but I stumbled across the soundtrack by Elton John (I was a big fan in my teens) and it was only $1.99, so I bought 5! It is a bit naive, compared to the fare of today, but that is most of it's allure. Better than Blue Lagoon, and good music!",1377907200,,404,3.8795180722891565
3433292,5,B0019D31NK,"The film is very touching and real, and I'm enjoying the fact that the French scenes are done in French with subtitles.

This is a rare little gem.",1371859200,,291,4.254545454545455
3433293,5,B0019D31NK,"This movie is phenomenal!  I saw it a long time ago in the movie theater and tonight I watched it again with my two children, my son Adrien who is sixteen and my daughter Sierra who is ten.  I loved it again; the beauty of two young kids, only 14 and 15 years old and the way in which they left a hard life and seemingly entered into a harder one but they made it look easy.  Why?  They were young and they were love and they had a baby and they grew up fast.  I loved the scenery and the animals; I loved the their cozy little ""apartment"" and the wilderness around them.  I also loved the beginning in the streets of Paris.  Mostly more than anything else I loved the way in which young seemingly children learned responsibility through love & attachment in such a unassuming way; it was precious and their innocence seemed to flourish with their growing family.  How did my children like it?  My daughter loved it.  My son was bored. You know what they say.  You can't please them all.",1371340800,,987,4.252688172043011
3433294,5,B0019D31NK,"Since the very first time I heard Elton John's soundtrack for this movie many many years ago, I was in love with the music and it was some of the first songs I ever learned to play on guitar. I had always wanted to see the movie but could never find it. In this day and age of computers, internet and Amazon streaming, I now have been lucky enough to see it. It is a beautifully simple film. Romantic, funny and charming. It brings back to me to folly of my own youth, when there was not a care in the world, and love was that all important unattainable thing. Funny, life doesn't change much because love is still that all important unattainable thing. The ending is appropriate because nothing last forever, even love. As much as you may want it to stay, somehow, love always leaves, leaving you with an empty  space in your heart for hopefully someone else to come along and fill.",1369353600,,883,4.351515151515152
3433295,5,B0019D31NK,"I watched this movie as a teen, about 15 years after it came out, and I was mesmerized by the acting , the story and its beauty. This film is poetry. I am so glad to have found it here. I had no idea that a sequel existed and I cannot wait to watch it now. Thank you, amazon.com, for finding this small work of art.",1367452800,,315,3.787878787878788
3433296,4,B0019D31NK,"I know people have their opinions about this movie. Yet, I think it's a sweet and heart touching love story. I think it only grows on you, in time.

I first saw  this movie in the 80's when I was about 14 or 15, then recently in 2013, I had a dream about it and I had to find it. I did some researching to find it on the Internet but I could not find it anywhere for sale on DVD in the USA. I was so glad that it was made available on Amazon instant video.

My one real hang up is: I wish that it had subtitles. Or an option to add or remove subtitles in different languages.  I would have liked it for the parts they spoke in French (I unfortunately do not speak the language).

Anyway, I'm very happy with the quality of the movie and the sound.  I watched it both on my PC and my iPhone. For me it was money well spent.

I was also pleasantly surprised to see a passage by Sean Bury on the posting. If he ever does read this I'd like him to know that this movie and your work was touching for so many people. I know others will have negative things to say but I think that this movie meant allot to me and millions of other people. So from me and I'm sure others: Thank you.  It is one of my favorite movies and something that I feel took me right back to the wonderful feeling I had watching it in my youth and those first feelings of love. It was a wonderful story and film.",1363737600,,1379,3.9
3433297,5,B0019D31NK,"I saw this film when it was first released (oh so long ago). It moved me so much, I saw it three times before it left town. Loved it then and for me, nothing about it has been diminished with the passage of time. In fact, I might appreciate it more now due perhaps to the innocence of the ""friends-turned-lovers"" story told, acted and shot so well. This is a low budget film but that is in no way a distraction. Nothing about it beats you over the head or overwhelms your senses. But it has made a lasting impression on me. I don't know if ""Friends"" could be made today but I'm very happy it is still around for people to enjoy. Just wish it was available on DVD. I've searched for it in that format over the years so was happy to find it on Amazon instant video and didn't hesitate to pay the 10 bucks for it.",1355788800,,810,4.06875

3433299,5,B0019D31NK,"""Friends"" is an all-time favorite of mine; a lovely coming-of-age story of two young people running away from troubled lives to make a life with each other, and coping with the unexpected.  The indoor shots look like old master paintings, and the outdoor landscapes of the sea and the seaside are wonderful.  The whole effect is completed with some memorable poetry and excellent music by Elton John.

3433302,4,B0019D31NK,"So many reviews have stolen my thunder as to why I like this film. I always like the Elton John music that sticks with me and the excellent scenic photography when Paul and Michelle run through a wild slough area to hug after a bitter argument. It surprised me that the actress playing Michelle was over 17 according to her biography, thus kind of a rebuttal to critics who considered it exploitive underage sex. What I like about the film is what it is not.  It is not violent, cruel or insensitive. It is not some kind of mechanically constructed video game fantasy spinoff.  It is not a teenage sex comedy with 50 bathroom jokes. It is unlike what American cinema churns out today. Yet reviewers of the time thoroughly trashed this film.",1316995200,,740,4.556390977443609

3433304,5,B0019D31NK,"Times of innocence innocence!!

I wouldn't want to lecture anybody but I do feel the urge to say some things I consider important about this BEAUTIFUL film. I saw it for the first time in 1976 (I was 14) and then one more time a year later. That was it. The rest of it was the pink LP of Elton John's soundtrack getting the music and the story deeper and deeper inside my heart. How deep?

A week ago my cousin gave me a VHS copy as a present. (No DVD's yet).

Boy....was I surprised!! Poets have always sustained that deep childhood and adolescent experiences of beauty, love, God, idealist pursuits, stay with you forever. Since they occur mostly at the heart's level (no intellect yet!), they define your soul's contours like a sculptor would do with a stone. If sometimes we didn't tend to forget how right they are perhaps we would do better in understanding the meaning of every minute, of every decision, of every turning point of our lives.

So, I confess I feel nostalgia. But the fascinating part of this is watching the film again, and through this trip back in time, enriching that understanding of why we, people from the 60's, grew up as we did. The spirit of those times is all here: a Genesis created far from the official world of consuming and economic success, make love not war, the beautiful pop ballads, the poetry of the lyrics, a totally romantic view of adolescent rebellion with the awakening of sexuality carefully wrapped in tender and chaste love, these two lonely spirits still full of childhood innocence growing together as they learn mutual commitment and turning into ""adults"".

I showed the film to a group of school youngsters and they abounded with such simplistic and cynical comments regarding it as nave and foolish. Guys, be serious!!  Cinema is an art and as art it reflects not only human emotions but historical moments. And this is exactly what ""Friends"" does in a masterly way.  It reflects an idyllic idea of rebellion and new beginning we all dreamt about when we were 15. I'm now a musician and I feel some of us, artists for that matter, still dream about it!! How else could we live? That's ""Friends"", that's ""Brother Sun Sister Moon"", that's ""Hair"". Those were the times, still alien to AIDS, alien to explicit and vulgar texts in pop songs with no melody,  to pornography presented as ""sexuality"", to this barbaric new ""world order"" growing after September 11th.

What a heart warming experience to see Paul and Michelle again, timidly and tenderly exploring the new fantasies of their romantic world. What a trip back to the very core of our hearts: to Paris, to Elton John at his best, to the 2 CV Citron and the VW Beetle. What a fresh air from the peaceful cottage in Camargue, surrounded by fishing ponds and wild horses. They made us who we are, as did Serrat in Spain, Brel in France, Peter Paul and Mary, Joan Baez, Luther King, the Beatles, the early Bee Gees, Belafonte's Spirituals, Gandhi, the Gospel of Elvis.

People still hoping: get this picture. Start with innocence and grow from there. You'll find out what it's all about. And from there you'll have a solid and more truthful foundation; some ideals to look for in life, a way to handle personal and world affairs. We need so much of this today!  Give yourselves the chance and maybe someday the time of cynics will end.

3433305,3,B0019D31NK,"What this movie has going for it is the touching story of two early-teenagers who meet and together flee from their troubles at home and struggle to make a life together and in the process fall in love.  There is nudity and simulated sex, but it is handled naturally and tastefully.

The problem is that the screenplay in which this affecting story is couched has some severe mistakes:  First, the gut-punch ending.  I won't reveal the ending, but it is both a major downer and not at all credible.  What the boy could have done and would have done is fairly obvious to anyone who is watching and taking the story seriously.

Second, the main character.  Deciding to have a main character who is obnoxious at first is a ticklish move for a story to make.  This is not the place to discuss how to make this move, but briefly, something has to be done to add an appeal that counterbalances the brat behavior.  I would have introduced the new wife and her despicable son at the beginning.  Then, the boy's juvenile-delinquent behavior would at least be understandable.

Third, stopping the story every fifteen minutes for a music interlude.  This move has been tried from time to time in movies, going all the way back to ""Pot of Gold.""  It has never worked, and is rarely attempted.

Someone should put this movie and its sequel on a single DVD and include the music as a separate music video and get it out of the movie.

Even if these problems were fixed, the movie is still too slow, probably because the screenwriter did not come up with enough events and had to stretch the ones he had.  In short, the script is ""nothing to be proud of.""

Still, if the story appeals, this movie is worth seeing, and the fact that it is still around after 35 years shows that it has lasting appeal.",1149811200,,1784,4.473684210526316
3433306,5,B0019D31NK,"My husband of 26 years & I saw this as Juniors in HS. Yes, he was my boyfriend then and still continues to be. I think we both cried our eyes out. I think possibly we were drawn to the movie by the Elton John music in it, but were then swept away by the teenage angst of it all. Paul and Michelle were just about our ages when we saw the movie- so very easy to identify with!!
It is wonderful to hear that Sean is doing well, I am also in the ""helping professions"" (an RN). I thought his performance was good and very believable. ""Michelle"" came across as very sweet, fragile and vulnerable. I think the main theme is that if they didn't have to deal with the ""real world"" then they could be happy and continue to be in love. How many times have all of us wanted to just have a ""Calgon moment"". If we all had no outside worries  and could just deal with our ""basic needs"" it could be somewhat easier. I have a 15 yr old daughter and wouldn't have a problem with her seeing this movie.. Kids see so much worse these days that this is very tame.
For those of you who are trying to locate the CD my husband (a huge Elton John fan) was able to get a 2-CD set which came out in 1992. It is called, ""Elton John-rare masters"" Polygram studios. This has all the friends songs as well as many others. As far as we know this is the only CD with the ""Friends"" music. We also had the LP years ago and were thrilled to find the CD. Good luck.
I recommend this movie for anyone who loves the ""young love"" theme. I only wish it was on DVD now!!",1105660800,,1529,3.996732026143791
3433307,5,B0019D31NK,"I can't believe that such a small budget film that Anicee and I had the good fortune to make all those years ago, is still receiving your kind attention. Thank you for all your comments, I assure you it was great fun to make ""Friends"" and an honour to work with Lewis Gilbert who has continued to make some super films.
I shall always remember Lewis's words after the Preview showing...""Sean"" he said as he came up to shake my hand,""you have nothing to be ashamed of !""..(I heaved a sigh of relief)...then he added.. ""But nothing to be proud of either!"". Years of dedicated training as a young actor just went down the pan!
I now work with people with special needs , the money is terrible but the smiles are the best! I have been lucky enough to see both of these 2 very different worlds. One feeds upon the attention it seeks and the other is just happy being, and getting on with things quietly, but both are exciting,fun and challenge one to do better. May your gods be with you all !",1090108800,,988,4.317204301075269
3433318,5,B0019D31NK,"This movie captures the innocence and idealism of two very young teenagers in England & France. I first saw this movie while over in Italy in the Military in the early 70's. Elton John's soundtrack is unbelievably set perfectly to the movie.
If only life could still be this innocent and sweet. There is nothing dirty or foul about the movie. Two young kids fall in love and experience life, howbeit, the difficult way in southern France.
This movie brings back ""those"" memories of the 1960's and early 1970's. If you listen to the soundtrack, that is the words you will note how very well they depict the thoughts and imaginations of these two young teens. Anyone not having a copy should get one.",1078963200,,698,4.637096774193548
3433319,5,B0019D31NK,"Ditto as Tim just reviewed.  This movie played the 'midnight show' circuit in the 70's before Rocky Horror became the rage, and I missed it somehow.  I searched for so many years but no luck finding anywhere in video stores.  They never heard of it and had no record of it.  Have wanted to experience the movie to go with the beautiful soundtrack of Elton John that I have enjoyed for 30 years.
  This movie will bring back visions and memories of college days and first love from that era.  Although 'Animal House', 'Fast Times', and 'Ferris Bueller' might be the generation films from the 70's and early 80's, ""Friends"" should be the 'love' film for the early 70's 'peace' generation to yearn for. (I never think of the lame TV show, only this movie and the wonderful soundtrack).  Buy it before it disappears once again.  You will be so very happy for the experience.",1074729600,,870,4.561290322580645
3433320,5,B0019D31NK,"In Paris, surly Britisher Paul Harrison, 15, suffers from a businessman father who's getting married and gaining a stepmother and a prim and proper stepbrother Gerald.  Cute brunette Michelle Latour, 14 and a half, whose father's death has left her an orphan, flees from her cousin and her abusive live-in Pierre.  Paul and Michelle meet and after a few days, run away to a countryside cottage Michelle and her artist father used.  Both are fed up with adults who don't seem to want, understand, or care about their feelings.  ""Adults.  They're all the same.  As long as you don't bother them..."" Paul says.  Later he contends that ""if we were old enough, they might leave us both alone.  Nobody's gonna find us no matter how hard they try.""  Late twenties onwards is considered old for them.
It's a nice, cozy two bedroom, one living room with fireplace, cottage.  And it's apparent that Michelle is in her element in the countryside.  Even though Paul's the one who decides to run away and tag along with her, Michelle's knowhow proves that she's more responsible than he, although he learns from her and from experience.  She knows how to cook and wash so her abilities as a  housewife are in plain evidence.  Paul is educated, but that doesn't do him any good where they are.
The world Paul and Michelle create isn't that far removed from the adult world, because necessity dictates Paul to find a job in order to buy food.  They go hungry together, become disillusioned at times, and even their idyllic union is briefly threatened in a war of words.  But they triumph and soon fall in love, and beyond.  Michelle is very gentle and is quick to stand by him when his job hunt yields nothing.  She assures him he'll have better luck tomorrow.  And the horrid women of today are quick to brand their boyfriends or husbands losers if they have that trouble!  Give me a girl like Michelle anyday!  The cottage in the idyllic countryside instead of the busy streets of Paris works in their favour.  Here, they have their Eden.  Sure, the long walk Paul has in the fields or in town is quite a trial, but it makes a man out of him, plus he feels the esteem in getting money and having Michelle to come home to.
Their outlook and message to the world is encapsulated in this exchange, when they are having a picnic.  Michelle asks Paul, ""What is the future?""  To which he replies ""It's here.  It's us.  Until we're properly married.... Until we're old enough.  No one to say that we're too young.""
Lewis Gilbert directed this movie and its sequel, Paul And Michelle.  His better known efforts include You Only Live Twice, The Spy Who Loved Me, Moonraker, Educating Rita, and Shirley Valentine.  And Elton John's score and love songs add to the magic, particularly the title track and ""Seasons"" which Heart did on their Road Home album.  ""Funny how young lovers start as friends"" he sings.  Funny, and wonderful.  And the old English lady Paul helps in the bookshop is Joan Hickson, who played Agatha Christie's Miss Marple in the BBC TV series in the 1980's.
 Both leads are great here, making a loving and ultimately responsible couple in their Eden.  The controversy this film aroused for portraying mid-teens as parents isn't justified.  Although Anicee Alvina does indeed do a great job of looking fourteen, (she was 16) and her topless scenes may have caused a stir.  She is very cute and darling, a cross between Judy Garland, especially when wearing pigtails, and Drew Barrymore.  And her voice is so girlish and cute French accented English.
A sense of emancipation exploded in the 1970's, such as the youth and women's liberation movement, and Roe v. Wade was two years to come after this film.  Despite this being an English-directed film, the childbirth here reflects the illegality of abortion in France, which continued until 1974, but also a return to the idyllic romanticism that the above movements sundered.  No, I'm not saying this is something the right can rally to, but more a return to nature, away from the stifling metropolis and authority.  A sweet little film whose sequel I can't wait to see.",1070236800,,4116,4.708683473389356

Most people after seeing it, say ""Thats the way it ought to be"".
Certainly the story line has some sad bumps for these teen lovers, but they way they fall in love and explore the issues of life, and love is the way that anybody would want it to happen to them.  If anything- this is love story for couples.  The scenery is beautiful, but teen actress Anicee Alvina is not sexy like Britany Spears, her face is one that guys fall in love with at first sight, and never forget.",1000684800,,538,4.37
3433323,2,B0019D31NK,"Well, for quite some time, I had been hoping I would eventually come across this movie. I was curious because I enjoyed some of the songs on the Elton John Soundtrack, and I wanted to see how the music fit the story....Let me just say, I was real impressed that Amazon had it, I had not been able to find it anywhere, and the picture quality, sound quality was great, but.....that cannot save a bad movie, and that is what this was. Everything just happened to quick, it was simply lame, I can't really think of any other way to put it. Yes, I am a guy, but even I can enjoy a truly heartfelt romance, which this was trying to be, but didn't make the grade. Before I saw the movie, I had all of these images in my mind, when I would hear the music, picturing what a great story this could be, I really hope someday I will be able to hear the music again, without it being horribly tainted by this film.

3433329,3,B0019D31NK,"Tacky camera techniques are one of the identifying features of '70s cinema and Friends suffers from this.  Lewis Gilbert's addiction to zooms can rival even Jess Franco's or Lo Wei's, and his attempts at virtuoso camera  movements (even more so in the sequel, Paul and Michelle) hurt this  sensitive, small study of a teenaged couple's sexual awakening and romantic  journey.  Anicee Alvina and Sean Bury play their roles well and if the  script hadn't been so lacklustre could have made Friends a minor classic.
