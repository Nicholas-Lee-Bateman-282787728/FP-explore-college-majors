902494,5,6304496672,"One of the best opening scenes ever shot in a Kung Fu movie. Jet Li moves with ease dispatching Japanese toughs with magnificent traps and locks leaving dislocated arms, legs and jaws in his wake. Fist of Legend is a worthy tribute to Bruce Lee's ""Fists of Fury"" set in Japanese occupied China.
Jet Li is a member of the Chinese National Wu Shu Team so the Kung Fu you see on screen is for the most part real. Sit back in your easy chair with the remote and be prepared to rewind and watch the fight scenes again and again. If your good enough you might even learn 'Hua Fist'.  END",899164800,,581,4.1875

The movie is rougly hour and 45 minutes and the movie is very fast paced expect a few scenes, this movie proves where your loyality lies when it comes to protecting the people who care for you and you care for them.  For an older Kung Fu movie from 1994 this movie still keeps me watching time and time again.  I watched it a long time ago on tv and found it at FYE for four dollars so choose to buy it and watched it tonight and doing review now.

902774,5,6304496672,"I first bought  Bruce Lee's ""Fist of Fury"", as it is the original version, and although he is amazing to watch, Jet Li's  ""Fist of Legend"" is simply better. It is probably the best Martial Arts Movie that has ever been made.  And much of is due to Jet Li's personality, never to start a fight but to stand up for what  he thinks is right.
And then there is the relationship with the young woman in Japan while Japan is occupying parts of China from 1931 to 1945, Japan's unconditional surrender, who is being rejected by the Chinese, not even allowing them to get married (Japan also refuses to let them get married) with the result that Jet Li is forced to leave ""Jing Fu Men"" as he does not want to leave the woman he loves.  There is a warmth in ""Fist of Legend"" that just does not exist in Bruce Lee's.
All in all, there is no weak point in this movie except for the Japanese solders who look absolutely ridiculous.
I have watched ""Fist of Legend at least a  dozen times.",1441238400,,975,4.243243243243243

902806,4,6304496672,"One of the best fight scenes ..... EVER.  I liked just about everything in this movie.  Definitely better than Bruce Lee's take.

WHAT I LIKED:
Story:
- Excellent.  Believable with a clear story to tell.
- I like that it show good in bad in the Japanese characters, particualarly in a WW2 anti-Japanese culture
- Amazing fight scenes.  Jet Li is the gold standard for Chinese martial arts actors.  He emotes in his acting and delivers in his martial arts.
- The fight scene in the Japanese club is the best ever!
Actors:
- Great martial artists, great acting to boot!
- You care about the actors.  They are telling a story you are going along for an emotional ride
Setting:
- I like the different locations they picked

WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE:
- I'm upset that the trailer I saw on Amazon was Cantonese WITH English sub titles.  That doesn't exist in my version.  I have no subtitle choices.  You either watch in English or in Cantonese.

If it weren't for the fact that I can't watch this in Cantonese WITH English sub titles I would give it a 5 star rating.",1436832000,,1055,4.409326424870466

The Kung-Fu in this is first rate even with the wire-work that goes with it as you'd expect to see.  Worthy of stting on the shelf right next to the original Bruce version.  Bruce had his own style and acting style and creative influence on his films that NO ONE can duplicate and they are told in such seperate ways, you don't feel like you just watched a ""re-make"" of a classic.  I'll fully endorse getting this Jet Li version.",1429142400,,620,4.3652173913043475

902870,4,6304496672,"While in school in Japan, Chinese martial artist Chen Zhen(Jet Li) hears the news of his master's death at the hands of a Japanese martial artist. He returns to his school and later feuds with his master's killer. After very easily defeating him and his students. He then learns there was more to his master's death than first believed.-summary

Even though this is billed as a tribute to Bruce Lee's Chinese Connection aka Fist of Fury. It's hard for to me see it as a tribute film. In fact, I don't look at Fist of Legend as a tribute at all, to me it clearly aped Bruce's classic with intentions on making money, and there's nothing wrong with that especially in a world where almost no idea is original; but I'm glad to see this twist on a classic was very well pulled off. I'm also glad to see this film re-mastered.

I really do like this film better than Chinese Connection in terms of story. I feel the film does a better job in its characterization when painting a picture of the Japanese race. Unlike Chinese Connection, the Japanese aren't all painted as an evil power hungry and abusive race. The film does an excellent job portraying the good ones in the race, such as characters Mitsuko Yamada(Nakayama Shinobu) and Fumio Funakochi(Kurata Yasuaki). The storytelling has its interesting moments when displaying people's racial hatred as well as hinting towards a military conspiracy. It adds quite a bit of meat to the story removing it from a one dimensional feel. The only weakness to the film would be the predictability. Most of the characters actions and plot elements are as predictable as the sunrise. Therefore, when the plot begins to unfold there's very little in the way of surprises.

Now for the major selling point which happens to be the fights. The action scenes are very cool to watch with some good exchanges and weapon combat. There's also quite a bit of variety with other martial artist getting an ample amount of screen time. One fight in particular which stands out for me happens to be Chen Zen vs. the older and wiser Funakochi. This battle stands as the best for me, due to the story being told during the fight with very little dialogue. The two highly trained martial artist are speaking through their actions. The fight choreography overall is well directed with some very good one on one battles, one against many, and a school vs. school all out clash. The film is definitely no slouch in the action department. Action junkies will get their cash worth for sure.

The film also has a very intimidating lead villain in the form of General Go Fujita(Billy Chau). This guy just has that look and the voice of a killer, plus he's very well built up as a threat and helps deliver a damn good final battle. However, as good as the battles are, I have to lean in favor of Lee's film in this area, due to Chinese Connection being the more realistic of the two. As good as Fist of Legend is, wire fu just isn't realistic combat and there's a bit of wire work here. Thankfully it doesn't come off incredibly ridiculous though.

The language settings are the only mixed bag for me. The English cast dub is ok at best, at times it has a rather disjointed feel. While the mandarin language felt a lot smoother. The latter also possesses what I think to be the more superior soundtrack. The sound effects are pretty good, and doesn't consist of over the top and highly exaggerated fist to face sounds from the 70's - 80's that we all know and love.

The features located in the extras are also worth mentioning. Now I don't always review extras and I'm not going to now. I'll just list them without breaking them down. My intention is only to avoid spoilers because everyone should come into them completely fresh. This is one of those rare cases where the extras are worth sitting through for me. They're definitely worth checking out.

The Man Behind The Legend: Gordan Chan
Brother in Arms: Chin Siu-Ho
The Way Of The Warrior: Kurata Yasuaki
The School of Hard Knocks: A screen fighting seminar at the celebrated Kurata action school
A Look At Fist of Legend: Brett Ratner & Elvis Mitchell

If your only Jet Li exposure is his american Hollywood releases. Then do yourself a favor and pick this up, personally I find it to be among his best especially after revisiting both the Tai Chi Master and The Legend of Fong Sai Yuk. I'll just say those two weren't on the same level as this for my taste.

Pros: Good characterization & fights, Excellent DVD extras

Cons: A minor issue with the dubbing, way too predictable",1427587200,,4548,4.5899014778325125

Fist of Legend is a pale comparison of the original Fist of Fury.  Fist of Fury was - at the time - unique & to Australian audiences came from virtually nowhere.  In Australia we had had a marvellous season of Kung Fu (the TV series with David Carridine) & as kids at school it was all we could talk about - those incredible & unusual kung-fu fights scenes.  Little did we know what was about to be unleashed on the big screen.  I recall watching TV one night when an ad came on for Fist of Fury, the voice over: THIS is the REAL King Fu and the image of Bruce Lee with a flying kick etc. I sat there gob-smacked and at 12 years old I simply had to go to see this movie much to my mothers chagrin.  It is the greatest ever Kung Fu movie  nothing since has been its match - & Im sure to have plenty of detractors on this.  Bruce Lee was elegant, fluid, fast & unstoppable.  Anyone could see the craft, the inimitable skill-level and most of all Bruce Lees presence.  All audiences knew that they were safe to back Bruce Lee  he was indefatigable & undefeatable.  Fist of Legend lacks this magic & Jet Li has no such presence. I grant you that the fight scenes are frenetic but so compactly scripted, so rigid & so tightly edited that what the audience engage in is a mash of scenes more expressing the skill of the technical crew & less so of the prowess of the protagonist.  Jet Li is more the dancer than the fighter. The camera is often slowed down to speed up his reactions, in fact if you placed as many edits & thwack sound effects in Swan Lake youd have a similar effect.  I like Jet Li movies  well  some of them.  And in fact I pick this movie as one of his best.  But just remember, its a remake of Fist of Fury & frankly lacks the imagination & magic of the original. 3 stars (original 5).",1419292800,,1972,4.064766839378239

Some of the fights were cool but not enough of them, in other words too much plot makes the movie boring. The story is pretty similar to original might even be better but doesn't really matter in a Kung Fu movie. If you love the original you might like this movie but I didn't. Fists of Fury is a master piece and Jet Li is no Bruce Lee. That being said the fights aren't terrible and some scenes are really interesting and well choreographed.

903149,3,6304496672,"This is very simple. While easily the best this film has ever looked at home, the sound and subtitles are a huge issue. First of all, the subtitles are DUBtitles. The English dubbed track verbatim, word for word. As such, the script is dumbed down and at times, laughably bad. This title deserved a proper translation and since such translations are out there, even among the fansubs, this is inexcusable. Even more so when you realize plenty of true fans would offer to redo the subtitles for free, just so that this release was proper!

Also of note is the sound, which despite claiming original mono, is not. This is a remix, dumped to mono. The soundtrack on the old laserdisc is far superior sonically. The remix, be it presented in mono or 5.1, is shrill and has none of layers inherent in the original mix. And in case you are wondering, the English dubbed tracked does not exist in this dojo!

And finally, there is the issue of the opening credits and close of the film. They are from the American version, so the credits look like they were created on someone's old Macbook in Paint Shop Pro (it's really laughable) and the final moment of the film is removed, which is a shame. As it is a spoiler, I don't want to say exactly what. Those of you who know the film will understand.

Dragon Dynasty never got a single release right prior to this one, so I guess we should have expected them to drop the ball. And they did. What a shame.",1354147200,3,1444,4.421052631578948

903154,3,6304496672,"Fist of Legend, the movie, is a solid 4.5 star event.  Jet Li is fast, fast, fast.  The fights are not too repetitive and the story isn't annoyingly bad.  I probably have a soft spot for this movie, but I really can't think of too many pure martial arts flicks in my library that are better (maybe Drunken Master).  But FULL DISCLOSURE I don't practice martial arts and probably could not tell you the first thing about it.  All I know is that this is entertaining and head-and-shoulders above a good deal of Li's later, blockbuster-type stuff.

Now the real review and the reason for giving the Blu-ray 3 stars overall.  Most of the movie looks great, and certainly better than the VHS copy I have been working with since high-school, but that's just what you would expect.  The last third of the movie, though, looks pretty bad.  There is a light, black line running vertically along the right side of the image in about 5 scenes.  During the last fight when Chen ends up in the small courtyard there are artifacts all over the image - it looked like rain at first - but it's just a light dusting of ""snow"" on the image for most of that scene.  And, finally, the subtitles and audio are a major step down from my old copy.  I don't speak Cantonese or Mandarin, so I'm not evaluating faithfulness to the spoken language.  My beef is with the subtitles being out of sync with the audio and characters having multiple voice actors (it seems!).  Also, referring to Japanese swords as ""Sabers"" seems weird, especially when the person talking is Japanese.

At the end of the day you should be watching this for the martial arts, which are at least worth 4 stars, but when you buy a Blu-ray it seems reasonable to have certain expectations regarding the video and audio.  Since those expectations weren't fully met, I give the Blu-ray 3 stars overall.  If there were half-star ratings I would give Fist of Legend 3.5 stars.",1328918400,,1918,4.545189504373178

I've tracked down and seen every notable martial arts film made up until now from all corners of the earth. When I first saw this film in 1998, I hailed it as the greatest martial arts film I've ever seen.  There have been a plethora of films released since then but this film still stands as the greatest in the history of this genre.

The fight scenes are an example of exactly what a martial arts film is supposed to be.  Flawless choreography, pin-point execution, blinding speed, unique and innovative techniques. Every fight scene is well detailed and perfectly shot, none are too long and none are too short. The main thing that sets this film above all others however is that each fight scene tells a story in and of itself.  It's just absolutely brilliant and breathtaking to watch.

Now the movies have too much special effects which takes away from the the plot, drama, humor, etc. The reason why we used to run in the house & anxiously wait in front of the TV for those Saturday afternoon classics @ 3 o'clock. Jet Li was the last to bridge that gap between that era & the new martial arts generation. Don't get me wrong, I think Donnie Yen has definitely taken the torch passed on by Jet Li. Fist of Legend for those who don't know was a remake of Bruce Lee's classic Fist of Fury. Not too many people can pull off a such an ambitious project. The thing about this movie that makes it special is the humor mixed with incredible martial arts, and I don't mean that Jackie Chan type of humor. Jet Li pulls off not only a worthy remake, but a classic in its own rite.

903285,5,6304496672,"Since Fearless is my favorite movie of all time, you'd think it would also have to be my pick for the best martial arts movie of all time. However, if I'm to choose the best example of the genre, I'd have to go with Fist of Legend. It's really everything that you want in a martial arts movie: a thin but serviceable plot, decent characters, acting that may sometimes seem stiff but never makes you completely gag, and - most important - lots of great fight sequences. Further, the film is directed and shot in order to best highlight the moves of the martial artists. Sometimes this makes for a rather crude look but it's just a sign that the director has his priorities straight. The master/student dynamic receives screen time, including some discussion of martial art technique and philosophy. What more could you ask for?

Of course, since the movie was made in the early nineties before Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon ushered in the age of more technical martial arts films (both wire-fu and true genre films), there is also ill-fitting music, cheesy sound effects, and strange dubbing. Personally, I do not watch martial arts movies with the English dubbing, though sometimes it's tempting so you can watch the moves more closely. I did check out Fist of Legend's English dub and the voices were not too bad (as far as that goes). Actually, I'm not sure what language this movie was originally shot in because the soundtrack in Mandarin and Cantonese does not match the lips of the actors any better that the English version! Strange!

In terms of fights, you will get your money's worth. You get not one, but two scenes of Jet Li taking on a crowd of adversaries. Add to that a fight between Li and co-star Chin Siu Ho (Tai Chi Master). By the way, Ho also gets some great action scenes of his own, which is great. There's a fight between Li and a Japanese master, as well as the final showdown with the Japanese villain. The plot is amusing enough to hold your attention until the next fight scene, and none of the fight scenes are overlong. Warts and all, Fist of Legend  is pretty perfect.

Another thing I like about this movie is that - even though it was filmed more than a decade before Fearless - it is actually a kind of sequel to that film. Li's character Chen Zhen returns to China to uncover the conspiracy behind the death of Huo Yuanjia, the master Li played in Fearless. Of course, the movies were not planned to fit together so there are plenty of things that don't gyve. Ho plays Huo Yuanjia's son, which will throw people who watched Fearless as in that movie Huo Yuanjia only had a daughter. Also the name of the Japanese martial artist who challenged Huo Yuanjia is different in this movie and his fighting skills are in question.

But these are minor quibbles (and are actually part of the endearing charm of this rough gem). Fist of Legend  would be my pick for best martial arts movie of all time, and I recommend it as a starting point for people who want to see a real representation of the genre as Li and Ho are in top form!",1294272000,,3059,4.5027027027027025
903286,5,6304496672,"Technically, ""Fist"" is a remake of Bruce Lee's ""Chinese Connection"", but most specifically in its fight scenes-- the themes of racism and its self-destructiveness are greatly expanded and more complexly presented in the Li version. But those fight scenes! The setups and even some of the action are virtually identical, creating the opportunity to directly compare the two superstars' interpretations of on-screen action. Here, a LOT of credit has to be given to Lee, who really originated the application of dance-oriented techniques such as personal pace, rhythm, and flow to put his unique stamp on the action. Li, on the other hand, had the inspired choreography of Yuen Woo Ping (""The Matrix"" martial arts director) to rely on. Both men deliver spectacular results on-screen, but if one is to rely on Bruce's dictum that ""emotional content"" is everything when delivering a punch, then Jet actually comes out ahead in the comparison: there are times when Bruce appears to be in danger or faltering during a battle, but that combination of fury and disdain he exudes makes all his opponents seem inferior and bound to lose; Jet, meanwhile, seems much more likely to fall, until his ""emotional content"" rises to the occasion. Bruce wins with the ""Shock and Awe"" approach, Jet wins with stealth and inventiveness, but the real winner is the audience who gets to experience both of these incredibly gifted performers in their primes.",1293321600,,1433,5.102127659574468

However, if you don't speak Cantonese, you want to buy the DVD version, not the BD. In the DVD, there is a decent translation for English subtitles. The English overdub is heinous though. It changes the movie, making every scene campy and trite. Not because of the voice acting, or even the awkward, out-of-synch lip motions, but because the dialogue is completely changed, for no apparent reason. It's really bad. Now for the BD, they totally ditched the subtitles from the DVD, and just transcribed the words from the English overdub. It gets pretty ridiculous, because there are parts of the movie in English, and the subtitles(also in English) don't always match. Actually, I don't even speak Cantonese, so I can't tell you how accurate to the original any of it is, but I do know that the English subtitles on the DVD I saw made this into a real movie; while the English overdub and the BD subtitles(which, again, were the same, or at least very similar) made the movie barely watchable, and then only for the fight scenes. If the translation from the overdub was accurate to what the actors were saying, the movie never would have made it overseas. It wouldn't even have the same cast, or director, or choreographer, because none of them would have taken it seriously enough to sign on for the project. I preordered the BD a while ago after seeing the DVD, and now that I finally sit down to watch it, months after it has arrived, I am sorely dissapointed.

The Movie : the story is not to difficult to be known, the fighting sequence is very awesome, the angle of camera is very attractive for Asian movies martial art on that yearrs, so.. that's ok, it's good enough

The Subtitle : the english subtitles sometime is different from the language that it spoke from the actors/ess, but if u don't understand about chinese language, there's no problema at all.

If you are just looking for epic fight scenes then this movie is great, but considering the prowess of Bruce Lee I'd say that the only things that came close were Jet Li's ability and the fight choreography.

I am a huge fan of the original soundtrack but sometimes I watch it dubbed which isn't bad but I find that anytime they dub movies like this the replace the music and it totally changes the movie.

The video, while not reference standard quality, is probably the best you will find of this film.  I am happy that the original cantonese language track is included. The Japanese characters actually speak, for the most part, in actual Japanese on the cantonese track!  There are also Mandarin and English audio options.  But I highly recommend watching it in Cantonese (with English subtitles).  The are a decent amount of extras including delete scenes.
My only real gripes are that I wished that makers of this disc used the original opening credits and music track; And that the certain minor liberties were taken with the literal translation of the film.

The movie's still as great as ever, both picture and audio.  However the subtitles for the movie are horribly inaccurate. As a Cantonese speaker it feels as if the people the wrote the subtitles watched the movie on mute and were just guessing at what the actors were saying.  So while I could get along fine with Chinese audio alone, I depend on the subtitles for the Japanese parts. Since the Chinese parts were so off I can only assume that the Japanese parts may well be too. I'm sure the subs would probably convey a cogent story, but just know that it may not be exactly the one the director intended it to. If it weren't for this I'd probably give it a 5 but since the subtitles are probably needed for the viewers who don't understand both Chinese and Japanese, 3 stars.",1271721600,65,915,4.163841807909605

There was NO kickboxing in this movie. There was a tribute to Bruce Lee, who starred in the original movie (this is a remake) - wherein Jet Li attempted to use Jeet Kun Do, the fighting style that Bruce Lee created. Sorry some people didn't understand this, but for those who did - it made this movie even better and more amusing; and it was a worthy tribute even though Jet Li clearly struggled to understand that style.

This movie was great. The fighting sequences were great. I wish they hadn't sped up the footage - but that's okay. The music was pretty good, the choreography and sequencing was excellent. I DO agree that Jet Li could have done a better job portraying Chen. More emotion would have been better, as Chen was a rebel... but he did a decent job and his immaturity was showcased on several occasions.

If you don't know anything about martial arts or martial art movies - well then you might want to pass this one up. BUT if you know a thing or two before watching, you can definitely appreciate this as a great remake of a great classic.",1265673600,,1202,4.429864253393665

903445,4,6304496672,"I love jet Li and enjoyed this film greatly. Fantastic fighting scenes,many of the supporting martial artist did a fantastic job not just Li. It has a pretty good story line considering the genre. Jet Li comes back to the school he left to find his teacher dead and the Japanese lording it over his fellow students and trying to close the school down. Also you have a little competition with his best friend who is in charge of the school now. Many of the people in the school look to jet's character as the leader and not his friend causing conflict between them. One of jet Li's best films in my opinion. If you are a fighting film fan then you will enjoy this one. I also like the fact that the film has a few good Japanese characters unlike the original film that it was based one. And I thought his biracial relationship with a Japanese woman and the racism they dealt with was a nice touch.

Not much that I didn't like about this film to be honest. Their were a few changes from the Bruce lee film that I didn't like. In the original Lee really was killing Japanese. He hung at least two people and killed a good number of people. I felt that they wanted to make jet's character more of a good guy and just had him framed for murder rather than really killing Japanese. also the original film didn't have a happy ending with Bruce lee getting shot up which made it stronger in my opinion.  The fighting is better in this film that the original because the supporting cast fights a heck of a lot better than the ones in Bruce lee's version,but I liked some elements of the original better like lee being more of a ruthless violent killer who had had enough and was going to kick some butt and kill whoever got in his way.

Most would agree after watching ""Romeo Must Die"" and ""Kiss of the Dragon"" then viewing ""Once Upon a Time in China"" and ""Twin Warriors."" But ""Fist of Legend"", a remake of Bruce Lee's ""Fists of Fury"", blows them all away. The fight scenes are unbelievable.

The transfer, I concede, was dark in some places and fluttery in others, as another reviewer notes.  The digital remaster of another great Jet Li film, The Tai Chi Master, suffered the same shortcomings which, in this day and age, I find difficult to justify.

903575,5,6304496672,"...that's the way Gordon Chan's ""FIST OF LEGEND"" was dubbed before; it displays Chen as a little  cocky, a little arrogant but honorable young man. Dragon Dynasty has restored the film's original language track with excellent subtitles. You would not believe just how bad dubbing can affect a film, the only thing that the Dimension release had going for it was its great music, and it is uncut and titled the same. The film has been hailed as Jet Li's best film. The story behind ""Fist of Legend"" is loosely based on real life events and the film itself is a remake of Bruce Lee's ""Chinese Connection"" (Asian title: FIST OF FURY).

Chen Zhen (Jet Li) is a young martial artist sent to Japan to study and find new skills and methods so that the Chinese may combat the Japanese more effectively. While in Japan, Chen receives word that his master had been killed in a duel with a Japanese master named Akutagawa (Jackson Liu). Chen returns home to Shanghai to pay his last respects and decides to get to the bottom of his master's death. After a quick fight with the Japanese master, Chen determines that Akutagawa couldn't have beaten his master in a duel. The military soon becomes involved to discredit the school, and social differences threaten to take the school and its masters apart. All the more setting events in motion that would set Chen and the Jing Wu school on a collision course with Japanese authorities.

The film's main premise would be the conflict between the Chinese and the Japanese, or rather, who are the best fighters? But the film does delve into something much deeper. The film also explores the differences and social tensions between the Chinese and the Japanese. The film is well-acted (if you use the real language track) and characters are nicely developed. The court drama in the first half may be a little lacking and far-fetched, but I thought it wisely represented the social differences between the two countries. Mitsuko (Nakayama Shinobu) is a blessed presence for Chen and wow! Jet gets a beautiful Japanese leading lady. The tensions between Jing Wu's new master Ting-An (Siu Hou Chin) were excellently played. Chen's encounter with an honorable Japanese master named Fuimo Funakashi (played by Yasuaki Kurata), different styles are on display even blindfolds as they fight to prove their superiority which ends in a resolution that reinforced their respect for each other.

Well, all these intricate storytelling are set aside for numerous fight sequences which is the film's main draw. Legendary fight choreographer Yuen Woo-Ping (Kill Bill, Fearless)  earns his paycheck, the fights are nicely shot and excellently executed. Jet Li fights a bunch of students in Akutagawa's dojo, is just a great sight to behold under a masterful hand, it also brought back memories from Bruce Lee's original.  The moves are on display and the techniques are perfect. While some films use action scenes to delay a film's resolution, ""Fist of Legend"" uses action to get to the films' resolution. The majority of the fights looked very realistic while some are the usual wire fu that Jet Li does.

The fight sequences are excellently placed and does further add to the film's strengths. The fights are quite long and radiate sheer intensity. The fight between Chen and Fuimo is arguably the best one. Fuimo's experience and ability to adapt to Chen's style may have given him the upper hand, and I really thought that this fight represented what true Martial Arts should really be about. It is just so incredible to see the two styles clash that maintains a certain amount of honor and sensibility. Chen's climactic encounter with General Fujita (Billy Chow) may well be etched in action fanboys' memory as one of the best fights ever captured on film; the final fight is long and at times brutal. The only reason why I preferred the Chen/Fuimo fight to the Chen/Fujita fight is because while the final fight was also spectacular, I was a little turned off with the use of a belt(?) against a katana. Realism was thrown out after all the hard-hitting precision, I felt that it deserved a better climax. Sorry, it just takes a nose dive, a nunchaku would have been more believable as in ""Chinese Connection"".

Yes, this film has been hailed as one of Jet Li's best films and it is a loosely based prequel/sequel of sorts to ""Fearless"". The film is the living epitome of Li's younger days and a worthwhile display of his skills. There is just such ""guilty pleasure"" when you see Jet Li beating the tar out of everyone and he does it so--looking precise and cool. The film just has boatloads of action and is sure to please martial arts fans!

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! [4  Stars]

VIDEO/AUDIO: 1.78 excellent anamorphic widescreen.

Interview with Gordon Chan: a must-see! The Director behind the 'Legend'.
Way of the Warrior- interview with Japanese legend Kurata Yasuaki: a must-see!
School of Hard-knocks- screen fighting seminar at Kurata's school.
Brett Ratner and Elvis Mitchell gives their two cents for the film??",1221350400,19,5641,4.927368421052631
903576,5,6304496672,"When you take a look at Jet Li's career, there might be a big debate about which is his best performance, or which one of his movies has the best plot, or the best cinematography. But when it comes to action, there is only one film in his career that maximized his potential, and that is this movie...the classic...Fist of Legend.

This movie is unquestionably Yuen Woo-Ping's best work, and one of the greatest, if not, the greatest martial arts movie ever. Unlike other films where wirework is predominate, Gordan Chan literally lowered the ceilings and kept this film grounded throughout. The result is a kinetic picture, a tapestry woven by hardcore punching, kicking, grappling, and weapons combat. Three of the one on one fights could be placed in the best all time fight sequences anywhere anytime. Even so, the best fight scene in the movie might be when Jet Li walks into the Japanese school and destroyed everyone.

The truth is, if you never seen this movie, you are not a real martial arts fan. It is cliche, but it is one that rings true.",1221177600,,1051,4.645161290322581
903577,5,6304496672,"I remember as a kid I used to love these kinda movies; back in the 80s I think it was on FOX every weekend they would show some Martial Arts flick and I was always amazed at the fight scenes. But as time went on I got into other things and honestly I cannot remember the titles of these movies I saw as a kid. So getting back into these movies is very tough since it's like ok where do I begin? I figured Jet Li's flicks are as good a place to start since I've pretty much enjoyed most of his work (well his Hong Kong flicks and only a couple of his American movies).

A lot of these Martial Arts flick aren't great movies in the traditional sense. It's the action scenes that elevate these movies from being enjoyable to greatness. While many of these movies are good when there are no action scenes, but in general that is what elevates them. I guess you can see these movies as sort of like horror flicks. You don't need a great screenplay to make a great horror movie, but when you get a great script it makes the movie all the better and that brings us to Fist of Legend. Fist of Legend is one of the greatest Martial Arts movies and one of the all time great movies period. When there is no action the movie is still great and than on top of that we get some of the greatest fight scenes ever captured in film.

The screenplay by Gordon Chan, Lan Kay Toa & Kwong Kim Yip is actually very well written for this kind of movie that can often get away with an ok script. Chan, Toa and Yip write a great screenplay with excellent characters that are very well developed overall and even the ones with less depth all add to the plot. The story has some nice twists and turns and has a lot more going for it than just the action scenes.

A lot of these movies the directing is always very good in terms of action, but the storyline is often not handled as well, but where other directors might have failed Gordon Chan delivers. He handles the story aspect very well, and delivers an excellent movie even without the action, but when it comes time for the action, Chan captures it with perfection and delivers the thrill ride of a life time. The tough thing about these movies is actually the action scenes. If you have too many it gets harder to top the previous so you need the right blend of story and action and again Gordon Chan delivers big time.

The performances were all very good and Jet Li was amazing; the ultimate clich is if you are Asian you must know Martial Arts and sadly Hollywood has played up to that. Asian actors mostly get a raw deal in Hollywood they are either Martial Arts experts or the nerdy character. Since coming to America, Jet has never really been able to show off his acting skills with the exception of Unleashed where the movie relied more on his acting rather than fighting and Jet is a very good actor. First off, English isn't his first langue so you gotta cut him some slack, but he's much underrated and here in Fist of Legend he gives a great performance, while his line delivery is very good what makes Jet Li shine so much is his eyes. He really shows so emotion; Li is a very gifted actor and hopefully one day Hollywood takes notice and gives him a chance to show his range.

While Jet Li is one of the best at these kinds of movies I think we can all agree Bruce Lee was the master of the genre. Without him most of these movies would never have come to be (this movie in particular since it's a remake of a Lee movie). But quite honestly I would rate Jet Li as my favorite. I can watch this guy over and over again and never get tired, so while Bruce Lee was the best and you can make a case for several others as well, for me Jet Li takes top spot

The fight scenes were done by Woo-ping Yuen and simply put this guy is a legend! He's done some of the greatest action flicks of all time. When this guy is involved the one thing is for sure is that you're gonna get one hell of an action sequence. Fist of Legend features some draw dropping fight scenes and no doubt nobody can do this type of movie better than Woo-ping Yuen.

The new DVD from Dragon Dynasty is excellent 2-disc edition and has plenty of features so if you only have the super lame Dimension films release get rid of it and upgrade. The transfer is also very good. This DVD delivers.",1221091200,9,4299,4.184782608695652

903624,4,6304496672,"This movie contains two of my favorite fights of all time:  Jet Li vs. Chin Siu Ho, and Chin Siu Ho and company vs. a buttload of Japanese fighters.  Just astonishing.  The film is a remake of Bruce Lee's ""Chinese Connection"" about Chen Zhen, the fictitious student of the real Huo Yuan Jia, who Jet Li would later portray in ""Fearless"".  This movie differs from Lee's in that some of the Japanese characters are sympathetic to the Chinese, plus the addition of a complicated romance and the school's internal conflict.

The Japanese have set up shop in mainland China.  Jet is studying in Japan when he learns of his master's death back in Shanghai, from a match with the master of a rival Japanese school.  He comes home and immediately sets about getting his school's reputation back and letting the Japanese know who the best really is.  The trouble is that Master Huo's son (Chin Siu Ho) is now in charge but everyone wants to follow and learn from Chen Zhen.  Complicating things further is a plot to implicate Chen in the death of the instructor who killed his master, and a Japanese woman who is in love with Chen and sacrifices her life in Japan for him.

This may be Yuen Woo Ping's best choreography, though it is not completely flawless.  Too often props are broken rather ridiculously, and some scenes are a little too heavily edited.  It's a minor complaint though and you won't care until you're on about the 22nd or 23rd viewing.  If you don't already own it, BUY THIS.  English dubbed only.  4.5/5

In terms of fighting, I absolutely agree. It might be in part because of the filming technique of Bruce Lee's era (the 70's). The fighting scenes of that time look very slow compared to today's. However, Bruce's acting is more engaging in term of emotion.

903697,5,6304496672,"I'm sure some people have made the connection already but I think I'd just point it out now and say that Fist of Legend is pretty much a fictitious sequel to the turn of events that occur in Fearless, the story about Huo Yuanjia and how his death turned up as a explosive dilemma in Chinese culture during that time and this movie runs about the same era... if not the SAME story.

Where I'm getting at is that the story of Fist of Legend is that a martial arts student, Chen Zen, of the Jingwu Federation finds out their master has been killed in a comptetition... Jingwu was founded by Huo Yuanjia himself and when Chen Zen fights the Japanese man who fought supposedly fought Chen's master, he even says he'll fight the Sensei with the Huo fist, his master's fist. HUO YUANJIA's style.

There are some strange connections that lead up by connecting the two movies but if you make the distinctions clear enough to understand, they do match up, which was pretty neat. Other evidence that follows up that Fist of Legend is a presumable sequel is when Chen Zen goes to pay respects to his dead master, there at the temple is the picture of Huo Yuanjia. Seriously.

Alright aside from tid-bitting self-produced facts and such, Fist of Legend is a movie that's timeless to Jet-Li's other performances. I only wish I could find an english subtitled version of this movie or something because the dubbing does NOT serve it justice! I won't knock its rating down just for dubbing, that'd be a shame to do because everything else about the movie is fantastic. Action sequencing is profoundly neat, that mediocre type of filming chinese movies seem to use for a broad majority of their films is actually quite good in this one, not quality, but by execution and performances really get you in to know each character and who they stand as.

I can't think of a reason why anyone wouldn't get this movie if they're a big kung fu movie buff, action movie lover or Jet-Li fanatic, or someone who just wants some unique exposure to these realms. Fist of Legend is definitely a reamarkable piece of work and entertainment.",1169251200,,2107,4.595744680851064
903698,5,6304496672,"This is another twist on the Janpanese versus Chinese ongoing feud movie, with the Japanese being the bad guys. Usually these scripts start with the foremost Master being killed and their finding there was foul play in the death. So does this movie.

The initial part of the plot is to find the killer. However pride and envy become the downfall of the new Master who is jealous of Chen (Jet's character), the former Master's best student.

Although I LOVE Bruce Li's version of this story, the fight scenes were better in THIS one - namely because there were fighters of equal magnitude to Jet all throughout the movie.

Most memorable in this movie is the blindfolded battle between Chen and his Japanese girlfriend's uncle...and how each comment on their fighting abilities. Jet learns from this Japanese Master. Their interplay was quite amusing...and you just marveled at each's skill.

Jet's posture early in the movie sets the serious tone of his character. The really big bad guy shows up face early on in the movie and you know the battle will be with this killer, the General, in the end. He even kills his own people.

The movie is worthwhile to see the skill of the excellent fighters involved and the multiple styles that are showcased.

The final fight scene is a bit long...but you anticipate that defeating the General would not be an easy task. If you are a Jet Li fan, this is one deserves to be in your collection.",1168128000,,1433,4.666666666666667

903700,2,6304496672,"Can someone please tell me where to get the re-mastered DVD version of this film with Chinese audio and English subtitles?  The recent Hong Kong Legends release is crazy: Chinese audio, or English audio, but NO English subtitles!

I have the original Chinese language/English subtitled (the subtitles are imbedded) version of this movie on a Universe VCD and, based on the merits of its available Chinese audio/English subtitles alone, it is a better movie--by magnitudes--than the one(s) commercially available to the (hapless) U.S. market.

The English dubbing on this DVD, even though well synchronized with the actors' lips, takes so much away from the film nevertheless, especially its ""Chinese-ness,"" which is a major reason I enjoy this movie genre.  Take, for example, the scene where our hero first returns to Jing Woo School after learning of his master's death and sees First Senior fight a challenge match with a visiting master.  After handily defeating the challenger, First Senior actually saves face for the beaten master which the English soundtrack completely (and deplorably) misses.  Also, at the very end of the U.S. release film, Chen says he is going back to his Japanese girlfriend.  In the original, Hong Kong release, he actually goes off to fight the Japanese with the resistance movement.  Between these two examples, there are many such, gross audio mis-cues; enough, at least, to take three stars away from an otherwise five-star martial arts film: the best of Jet Li's filmography, and perhaps the best of the ""modern"" Martial Arts genre, period.

The same criticism holds true for Jet Li's The Tai Chi Master (released in the U.S. as the English-dubbed Twin Warriors).  It's an English soundtrack superimposed over a Chinese movie, often stripping the film of its unique cultural content/identity/nuance, forcing the film through an American ""knock-down-shoot-'em-up"" template and reducing the potential for mental (as opposed to strictly visceral) enjoyment to a pitiful minimum.  We end up with a film typically devoid of humor, character development and silver screen ""intimacy,"" a film precariously out of balance with, and far flung from, its careful directorial intent.

If you value the full content--visible and audible--of Chinese martial arts films, but lack facility in the host language, then the next best thing is a well-subtitled, original language version.  And this release clearly is not that--by a long, long, long shot.",1161820800,3,2471,5.305128205128205
903701,5,6304496672,"Fist of Legend is an absolute best for the martial arts fan.  This movie is right up there with Enter The Dragon and The Legend of Drunken Master.  Fist of Legend has one of the best fight scenes ever in movie history.

Fist of Legend is considered by many to be Jet Li's best film.  There are a lot of fights from the beginning to the end, with each one becoming better than the first.  Some of the scenes are awesome one on one's, one on many, or group fights.  In addition to the large amount of action, the movie has a good story, focusing on the era with the Japan and China conflicts.  The movie begins with info regarding the death of Chen Zen's (Jet Li) master. Jet Li sets out to find out who commited the crime, but the story evolves much deeper than the average avenge story.  There is even a bit of Romeo Juliet tied in, as Chen Zen's girlfriend is Japaneese, and he is Chineese.

The fights though, are what make this movie an action powerhouse.  Every fight is beautifully choregraphed and most of the fights are several minutes in length.  Jet Li has 2 great, lengthy one on one fights near the end of the film.  The final fight is against Billy Chou, tall and quite physical actor.  The nearly 10 minute fight scene is more than just kicking and punching, but involves lots of objects breaking.  Ultimate Fights called this fight one of the best ever in movie history.

As with Jackie Chan's films, all the fight sequences in the movie are speeded up slightly, giving them an air of incredible speed, and look spectacular. While Lee's used a trampoline and wires in one or two sequences in the original (there's no speeding up of the fight scenes), the use of wires in Fist of Legend is evident in a number of scenes.

This being a remake of Lee's Fist of Fury (a.k.a The Chinese Connection), I wasn't sure what to expect. The story line follows a similar plot, but the picturization is totally different. The fight sequences are good, and that's about it. The initial fight in Kyoto resembles Steven Seagal's style (one shot and you're out); the confrontation in the Japanese school is nowhere as ferocious as Lee's; I won't add any more spoilers here, but the movie failed to impress me as much as Lee's.

Jet Li does a fine job as Chen Zhen, and Yasuaki Kurata is wonderful as the deep Japanese Karate Master, Fumio.

Although this film is an unapologetically patriotic Chinese production, it does not present the Japanese in an entirely unsympathetic light.  This film seems to recognize that the Japanese militarists were responsible for the invasion of China.  There are honorable Japanese characters, such as Chen's Japanese girlfriend (Shinobu Nakayama) and her uncle, a karate master (Yasuaki Kurata).

Most importantly, the action is outstanding.  If you're looking for an energetic, kinetic martial arts movie, I recommend this one over art house favorites like ""Hero,"" with its color-coordinated fights and combatants drifting in the wind like daisies.

Part of the reason they are so interesting is that each character has a cleary defined style and attitude.  Beyond even that through each fight seems to have a theme.  The first one for example displays a lot of grapiling (probably didn't spell that right) techniques.  The ending was a little weak but didn't bother me.

Not just because he's a true martial artist who's skilled at showcasing his craft on-screen, but also because he played his character very well in this movie.  But wait, let me not forget to say that this movie also has a story, yes, a story that's based on meaningful historical context, and also of an unlikely couple in love.

This film is a remake of another earlier seminal Chinese martial arts film, ""Fist of Fury"", starring the great Bruce Lee.  For those of you who are just looking for some martial arts choreographic eye candies, you'll get plenty of that in this remake.  ""Fist of Legend"" is different from other Chinese martial arts movies though, in that it falls in the realist category, as opposed to productions like the ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"".  A minimal amount of wire work is used, most of the fighting stays on the ground, which has its upsides because you can tell the moves are very realistic, and I promise you, knowing some of the actors in this movie from numerous other films, I know many of them have had true martial arts training, and are not just actors who've been taught to move gracefully flying in the air.  For all of you ""Matrix"" fans out there, you will find some of the moves used by the actors and set-ups in the film very reminiscent to the ones in the sci-fi action flick.  That's because the martial arts choreographer in ""Fist"" is none other than Yuen-Wo Ping, who was hired as the martial arts director by the Walchowski brothers after they had seen his work.  Take special notice of the fight scene between Li and karate students and master in the dojo, and the final duel scene between Li and the Japanese general.  The action is simply fantastic!

Now onto the story if you've cared to read this far.  Like ""Fist of Fury"", ""Legend"" is set in China in the 1930's.  A period when Japanese imperialism in the Pacific was at its height, and the independence and well being of the Chinese people were truly at stake.  Li's character Chen Zhen, who is a martial artist educated in Japan (ironically), emerges as a symbol of freedom and the struggle against injustice by standing up to the Japanese martial artists and military, who are clearly there to assert their dominance over the Chinese people.  This was a message that was brought out in Bruce Lee's version as well, however, it's worth noting that there are several key differences between the two films.  Whereas Bruce Lee's interpretation of Chen Zhen tended to be very one-dimensional --- he was basically a can of ""whoop-a$$"" filled with rage, ready to take down any agressors who even dares to look at him in a funny way, Li's portrait of Chen Zhen's character is one of depth and moderation.  Li's Chen Zhen dislikes the Japanese imperialists, but also realizes that for China to be powerful, it must learn from others, understand its own weaknesses and combine the strenghs of others.  He does this by incorporating elements of other martial arts such as boxing and karate into kung fu.  Moreover, that Jet Li's love interest in the film happens to be a Japanese university student confirms that the director of this remake is promoting the message of possible understanding and reconciliation between the Chinese and Japanese people, despite all that's happened.

The only regret that I would have with this DVD is the fact that it does not include the original Cantonese soundtrack (which also has authetic Japanese dialogues in them).  I personally find watching dubbed foreign films to be unbearable, but that could simply be a preference.  In addition, I suspect that some elements from the original Chinese version was cut in this version, as is customary in American Hollywood style releases, in order to keep the film ""short and sweet"", so to speak.  Other than that, I would highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a solid martial arts flick that's also got substance.",1104624000,5,3993,4.738439306358382

903924,5,6304496672,"""Fist Of Fury"" (or ""The Chinese Connection"", as it was released in Western markets) is arguably Bruce Lee's most popular movie among Asian audiences.  In other words, the target audience at whom martial arts movies are aimed tend to elevate that one above most others.  Which means it takes a lot of guts to try to remake it.

Having a talent like Jet Li available to play Bruce Lee's part helps a ton...but talent alone is not what places this remake above the Bruce Lee original.  Simply put, this is one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen.  The colors just jump off the screen, much as they are used to similar spectacular effect in Jet Li's later success ""Hero"".  The costuming is top shelf, and the fight sequences are worthy of Bruce Lee's original (particularly the final showdown), and as noted in a previous review, there is significantly less wirework in this movie than in other Jet Li movies from the same era.  The result is that the fight sequences, while awe-inspiring, are realistic and believable.

The characters are also well-delivered in spite of potentially crippling English dubbing that plagues most martial arts DVD's available in the West (Dimension should be better about this than most; this is not a low-budget distributor); you tend to feel good about the good guys and bad about the bad guys.

And the twists that separated the remake from Bruce's original are also very interesting and help to give this movie a strong identity of its own...the romantic ties involving both protagonists add a layer of depth unseen in most similar movies (the contrast between both female romantic leads is interesting and adds much to the substance of this film, absolutely shading the original) and before you know what's hit you, you find that you're actually watching a morality play concerning the evils of bigotry and racial intolerance (this was also a theme in Bruce Lee's original, but the remake does a better job of detailing how this is also a two-sided problem).  And I much prefer the ending of the remake to that of the original, though there are those who will complain that the remake is more of a ""Hollywood""-ized bastardization of the Asian soul of the original.  But to me it just feels more satisfying.

This is a good recommendation to people who remember ""The Chinese Connection"" warmly and are skeptical over the notion of remaking it, as well as old-skool martial arts fans who believe that wirework is an abomination to the genre.  And if you're at best a casual martial arts film buff, see this just for the care that was taken in its filming; truly a beautiful film, very easy on the eyes.

This movie was made in 1993, but looks like its from 1950.  The quality sucks terribly and is unbearible, the sound is hiddious, and the way the people talk is laughable, they open their mouths once and an entire sentence is heard and 2 sentences pop up on screen in the subtitles, the only bearable thing about the movie is the fights, of which are many but short, but good none the less.  But even the fights have flaws, lots of people say there is no wire fu, not that im against it, but theres tons of it in this one, everytime somebody gets hit they go flyin, and the fights are almost cartoonish, definetly not Yuen's best, they look more fake then anything ive seen and have ridiculous camera angles and some of the moves are just plain funny, but they're slighty average and watchable for fans of Bruce Lee's gay movies (i mean really why does he fight some 8 foot tall black guy with an afro who moves slower then MOlases and have a hard time in one of his movies thats funnier then anycomedy ive seen).  When there isn't fighting there is some poor attempt at a story, but its just a plain bad excuse for a movie, i say its a better comedy because its so much like a bruce lee ""film"" its almost impossible not to laugh.  I would suggest CTHD, the matrix trilogy, or Kill Bill if your lookin for good Yuen Wo Ping fights, and they are also much better overall films then this.  The guy from Napoleon Dynamite could beat up Bruce Lee, o yeah Comedies suck, but this has got to be one of the best, ive never laughed so much in my life, sorry Yuen im a big fan but maybe this movie was destined to suck, it is a remake of a Bruce movie afterall.  1 out of a 10 for the fights, but they could have been better.",1093564800,2,1935,4.157754010695188

Jet Li performs multiple kung fu styles and astounds you with each one.  A great thing about this movie is it all takes place on the ground.  There is no unbelievable flying through the air or leaping thirty feet up to a rooftop.  Although that is cool when done right.

As for the DVD itself, the picture is in widescreen but not anamorphic, but is still a very high quality.  I would say it is the same as Twin Warriors(Tai Chi Master).  The sound is dolby 2.0, which is just fine for this movie.  There is no need for incredible surround sound.

let's face it. american distributors simply have to stop editing these foreign films, dubbing them into english, and assuming it won't make a difference. it makes a HUGE difference, and this is glaringly obvious through this DVD release of fist of legend. while the english dubbing in this film isn't as awful as it could have been, it still takes away immensely from the film. the mood is totally thrown off by the english dubbing, and it's almost hard to take the movie seriously as a result of this. do yourself a favor and hunt down the taiwanese uncut fist of legend DVD with the original language tracks and english subtitles!",1085616000,,937,4.826086956521739

Unlike its original counter-part, Fist of fury (AKA The Chinese Connection), Fist of Legend has a more realistic story that does not portray all Japanese as cold-hearted imperialists.  One of the best examples is the love between Jet's character and a Japanese woman.  All of his other Chinese friends denounce her and say that she cannot be accepted.  However, the master of Jet's school falls in love with a prostitute.  She is later bought out from the brothel and begins to live at the school.  A maid makes a comment that Mitsuko (the Japanese woman) should have been accepted as well.  One of the older men of the school makes an excuse by saying that she is Japanese, and therefore, cannot be accepted.  I believe that the writer and director wanted to make a political statement, as well as an entertaining film.  Just because a country is at war with another, that does not mean that every single person is an enemy.  There are some who cannot help the way their country operates.

903993,5,6304496672,"This is one of Jet Li's finest showcases to date.
Jet Li plays a Chinese student studying abroad in Japan during the time of the Japanese occupation of China.  While there he falls in love with a Japanese girl who follows him back to China when he hears his sifu has been killed in a martial arts match against a Japanese karate exponent.  His worst fears come to fruition as he learns upon exhuming his master's grave that his teacher died not from blows caused during the grudge match as originally reported but by a slow working poison.
Jet Li seeks retribution, but not before encountering many obstacles along the way.  For starters some of his classmates feel that Jet Li's character, much to his chagrin, rightfully deserves the position vacated by their late master.  This causes a one-sided jealous rivalry between he and the newly appointed head of the school.  There's also plenty of prejudice directed his way by both Chinese and Japanese alike over his choice of a  Japanese girlfriend.  To top it off he must do battle with top Japanese martial artists as he tries to piece together the murder of his master, all of this in a country taken over by Japanese military law.
This one has everything, an emotionally involving story, two dimensional characters, and some of the fastest, all out powerful fights to hit the screen.  Memorable moments include Jet Li taking on a schoolful of Japanese college students at the beginning of the film using chin na (joint locking) techniques, an emotional fight involving ""the saving of face"" between Jet and his former classmate who's the new head of his school, a beautifully realized and lesson-filled match set to windy sand gusts between Jet and an older Japanese sensei (played by the wonderful Yasuaki Kurata of so many old school kung fu flicks fame), and a knock down drag em out slugfest against a mean spirited general played to evil perfection by high kicking superstar Billy Chow.
This story was the perfect vehicle for Bruce Lee in FIST OF FURY (aka CHINESE CONNECTION) and the update proves a perfect vehicle for Jet Li.  HIGHLY recommend (though if you don't mind subtitles I would recommend the original, widescreen, uncut and unaltered Cantonese version even more which is translated a little better than the English dub).
For another great take on Japanese versus Chinese martial arts see SHAOLIN CHALLENGES NINJA (aka HEROES OF THE EAST) starring MASTER KILLER himself, Gordon Lau (aka Lau Kar Fei, Liu Chia Hoi).

904034,5,6304496672,"Jet Li remakes Bruce Lee, and the result is great. It's a movie with both a) great martial arts and b) a social conscience, which is more than most kung-fu flicks can boast. Only rarely does amazing kung-fu action meet up with a solid story in the same film. Normally, this genre showcases a whole lot of kicking and crowing, with little else in the way of plot. But Fist of Legend, a remake of the 1972 Bruce Lee film, Fist of Fury, is a marvel to watch. The gravity-defying fight scenes are virtually non-stop, but what makes this film stand out from other kung-fu flicks, is that the story is pretty good. The strong point of this film is the cinematography of Derek Wan. The images are imbued with the rich, vibrant color which has become a hallmark of modern Chinese films. While this may seem to follow the typical you-killed-my-teacher-now-I-must-kill-you plot, Fist of Legend delves deeper. This film demonstrates some pretty impressive storytelling techniques. It has an interesting political sub-plot and by the end, the character of Chen Zhen is legendary. It's a fine movie.? Jet Li is in fine form, with minimal wirework and only subtle under cranking necessary to enhance his skills. All credits of all the terrific and pitch-perfect fight scene should be given to Matrix Action Director - Yuen Woo Ping. With the combination of Yuen's fights direction and Jet Li's presence and skills, notable fights were all over the place. One highlight is when Li takes on a whole class of Karate-Jap students, some of the overheads shots will remind many Matrix's fans, but in fact this was made almost 10 years ago is even more a classic. In some ways Fist of Legend is very much like the Matrix, especially of many philosopher's sayings like 'Japan is like an venous insect biting an elephant (China)' and a quote that I will always remember is eventually how and why Jet Li won his final fight against Billy Chow - 'If you learn to adapt, and to be fluent, then you will always be invincible'. The final fight, is probably as good as it can be and most likely the best fight scene ever filmed on camera. It was so well directed by Woo Ping that it push the already HK martial arts classic Fist of Legend to even greater heights. It also defy the fact that remakes are usually bad, but this remake of Bruce Lee's Fist of Fury, is as good as it can be and some even say it surpass the original, but no matter what the case is, Fist of Legend is just the best of the best and a must for all HK cinema starters and fans alike.?",1058227200,,2529,4.5119825708061

If you pay attention, you will notice the student kicked by Chen Zen didn't fly backwards in summersaults - as they often did in other martial arts films - but flew back plainly and then fell on the ground facing down. This is the best effect - seemingly no effect.
Something about Jet Li: He is the most skillful kung fu master. When he made his film debut in 1979's Shaolin Temple, he had already won numerous championships in China's martial art contests. He was only 16 at that time. In Shaolin Temple, which I highly recommend, he displayed his unbelievable skills in different styles with different weapons. Maybe he is not as funny as Jackie Chan, nor as handsome as Chow Yun-Fat (who is actually a layman of martial arts), but he is definitely the greatest martial artist.
BTW, as great as Jet is, he is not the inventor of fighting with a belt. There is a traditional Chinese weapon called Jiu Jie Bian (Nine-Chain Whip), which looks like a long iron chain.

I rented this movie once on a whim a couple of years ago when a friend of mine and I were having a martial arts movie night, and what I witnessed on that DVD was pure, raw, kung-fu and karate action! The Fist of Legend is a sort of unofficial remake of(you guessed it) the Chinese Connection. This movie really shows off the talent of the young martial artist, Jet Li, whose movies in the United States have done him no justice and, in my opinion, nearly blemished his career. Take all that ""Romeo Must Die"" and ""The One"" crap, toss it out the window, and watch this movie with a fresh look on Jet Li, and you will understand what I'm talking about. No one can deny that Bruce Lee executed the Chinese Connection perfectly, however The Fist of Legend falls short of that only by a hair.
Jet portrays a college student in Japan named Chen Zen who gets word that his master in China has died. He drops his studies and hops over to China for his master's funeral, but when he arrives he smells corruption lurking behind the strange and untimely death, which was after a martial arts duel against a karate dojo-master of lesser talent. Things begin to heat up when Chen Zen discovers that his shambled kung-fu school is only the tip of the iceberg, and the military is involved with his master's slaying. Billy Chau plays a military general bent on squandering Chen Zen's attempts at unearthing the truth, and it's an all out battle-royale! The movie consists of several explosive and lengthy action sequences that leave you thirsting for more. The final battle between Jet Li and Billy Chau is a hardcore deathmatch that lasts nearly ten minutes long! Phenomenal is the only word I can use to describe this high-flying martial arts frenzy by Yuen Woo Ping, and although it doesn't top the Bruce Lee version, it may be the next best thing. Die-hard martial arts fans need not bother with renting this movie prior to viewing, for you will not be disappointed!

At school he meets a girl, Mitsuko and they develope feelings for each other.  But before he can follow his feelings he must avenge the death of his master in China.  He realizes during his quest that his former Kung Fu school is in ruins and his hopes of being with Mitsuko might be dashed because he must protect his school...
They are happy but fate drives Chen Zen back to what he must do, avenge his master and save his school.  Can he do it?  Will love win out?  Will his brother betray him?  Many questions evolve as the movie goes on.  Of great interest were the varying fighting styles that drove this movie.  The fight scenes were outstanding.

904163,3,6304496672,"You know, I am amazed. How can people say that Jet is a better fighter or that this is a better movie than the original Bruce Lee? Bruce had character and charisma. Watch the original Chinese Connection{Fist of Fury}. Bruce brought an intensity to his role. Jet Li doesnt bring that intensity. Every punch,every kick,every scream Bruce gave was like an animal unleashing its fury upon its victims. In my opinion, The Chinese Connection was Bruce Lees best film.
 This remake lacks the intensity and flare of the original.
 And it lacks Bruce Lee. Jet Li is a great action hero. Probably the greatest action hero alive{just watch Once Upon A time In China} But compared to Bruce Lee, he just doesnt live up to his standard.
 A good movie, not even as great as the original Martial arts classic.
 My favorite Martial Arts Masterpieces are :the first 2 Once Upon A Time In China's and The Chinese Connection

904164,4,6304496672,"I have both the Chinese *rare* Ritek DVD, and the English DVD.  Just thought I'd share my comments:
-The English DVD has much better video quality
-The Chinese DVD has terrible music
-The fight scenes are better in the English DVD, as the music and sound effects are more dramatic
The thing is I always prefer to see chinese movies in chinese audio with english subtitles.....and I hate dubbing.
However, I have watched both and this is my favorite movie.  Having said that, I'd say the experience is better watching the English version, because you feel much more emotionally into the fights and drama as the music is much more appropriate.  The chinese DVD music is terribly wrong and doesn't suit the movie at all.  It totally wrecks the final fight scene.  Imagine watching an amazing martial arts fight but listening to some really cheezy 1970's drama music.  It's terrible.  The English DVD doesn't play music during the fight scenes.  That is the way it should be.
The video is much better on the English DVD. Its flawless and colorfull.  The Chinese DVD is dull greyish, and it has the snow white flakes all the time as if it was recorded from a movie theatre reel.
It would be really nice to have Fist of Legend with the Chinese audio and English subtitles, but the English DVD video quality and also to remove the music from the fight scenes.  That would be perfect =)",1030406400,3,1378,4.610655737704918

The video is remastered (widescreen) and includes Cantonese, English and French audio tracks.  Subtitles in French only.  Bonus DVD includes photos, interview with Gordon Chan and a whole lot of other stuff in French.  Video quality is very good.
I haven't listened to the English audio track yet so I don't know if it's the same one in the US DVD.  This movie is simply fantastic and this DVD from France should be a lesson to Buena Vista Home Entertainment as to how to release a foreign film on DVD.  Now I can retire my VCD version.

Now with this remastered DVD it makes this movie even more of a necessity. Jet Li just lets it fly in this movie. Excellent choreography by the legendary Yuen Woo Ping who, surprisingly, used very little wire work in this movie unlike his others like Iron Monkey and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. It truly is Jet Li in his prime at his best. There is no one who could pull off a remake to a Bruce Lee movie and make it work this well except Jet Li. Although I must warn you of one thing, don't blink during certain fight scenes because you will miss a move or two and yes Jet is that fast.

904238,4,6304496672,"First off, let me say that this film is a classic. While Jet Li isn't as sleek or as menacing as Bruce Lee, he certainly managed to pack more action into this version of ""Fist of Fury"", aka ""Chinese Connection."" Jet takes on the role of Chen Zhen, the martial arts student who wages a one man war on the local Japanese when his master is murdered. The fights come fast and furious here, and the final scene where Chen fights the Japanese general Fujita is worth the hefty pricetag alone. However, I can't really bring myself to watch this version. The dubbing is horrible, and for no discernible reason, 3 minutes have been cut and lines have been changed. After I watched the American DVD version, released by Dimension, I wished that Columbia TriStar had acquired the rights instead, after the bang-up job they did with ""Fearless Hyena"", not to mention the other Jet Li epics, the ""Once Upon a Time in China"" series. Until Miramax/Dimension gets the original Cantonese language track and some subtitles in here, or until they release it in Asia, I'll probably just stick with my 8-year-old Chinese VHS version. The tape may be close to breaking by now, but it's also in letterbox, and the original version just seems to have more heart... corny music and all.",1016841600,4,1261,4.6591928251121075
904239,5,6304496672,"Fist of Legend is a true powerhouse of a Kung-Fu movie, where 2 minute dialog scenes only serve to bridge the most amazing martial arts fights you will ever watch.  This movie is a remake of Bruce Lee's ""Chinese Connection"", which is appropriate, because Jet Li deservingly surpasses the Master in skill and talent with his performance in this movie.  Forget dialog and acting, the fighting absolutely rules this movie, and the story is told thru the fighting, like any good action movie should do.  I consider this film to be the Best Matrial Arts movie ever made.
Jet Li plays a star kung-fu student returning from afar to avenge his master's death.  Along the way, he fights just about everyone he sees.  While there are a couple of large-scale gang wars, most action scenes are 2 man duels.  These duels advance the plot and develop the characters while they dish out the action, just like the kung-fu in the Matrix, or the lightduels in the Star Wars films.  These fighters dig deep into themselves, get out old grudges they have with old friends, and learn about the mysterious ways of the universe as they watch it flow through their bodies.  Everything is present in the punches and kicks of this film - power, grace, spiritual peace, comedy, raging emotion, revenge, personal courage.  Wire-work is subtle and restrained, and takes a backseat to Li's amazing speed and precision.  If you are reminded of The Matrix you have a sharp eye, because the same choreographer worked on this film, and it shows.  Many of the little touches in the Matrix were lifted from this movie, in homage to its genius.  One unbelievable moment has Jet Li fighting a Japanese master while both are blindfolded.  The finale is a gruelly 40 minute duel between Li and an absolute evil bad-guy, two towering masters giving their absolute 100%.  In the end, you are just as exhausted as the fighters are, but you certainly had more fun.

It's like they made a bunch of white people sit in a room to watch the chinese version, and afterwards, they let them make up the english dialogue whatever way they want. Another reviewer said a lot of the deep martial art meaning has been lost and that is so true. Sometimes, they even get the chinese writing wrong.. For those who have seen the movie, the one sign that they said was 'acceptance' is actually 'tolerance'. The sign that the general held and said was 'jin wu school is closed down' actually  meant 'sick men of china'.  it's little things like that they annoys me. Of course, if you don't care what the director originally wanted you to see, this wouldn't be a problem. Dubbing killed this movie..",1011225600,3,1036,4.518716577540107

904310,5,6304496672,"Jet Li's Fist of Legend is a wonderful remake of the original Bruce Lee movie. It takes place in China and Japan prior to World War 2. Jet Li is a talented martial artist from China who goes to Japan for school. When he hears that his master has been killed, he goes back to his old school, investigates his masters death, and many spectacular fights ensue.
One of the reasons I enjoyed this movie so much was the plot. It wasn't a complex plot, but it wasn't  a generic movie plot, and it didn't get to complex to follow in a translated version. There was a sub plot with a love interest, but it didn't take up much of the time which could have been filled with fight scenes.
Where this movie really excels, is in the fight scenes. Unlike many Hong Kong movies, Fist of Legend didn't rely on wires and other corny special effects. Each of the fight scenes were cool because of the martial arts being used. This is what sets this movie apart from Iron monkey, Lord of the Wu-tang, Deadly China Hero, and many other popular Jet Li movies. For all of the fights, you could see each of the manuevers in great detail. When someone threw a punch, the camera would zoom in and you could see exactly how it was blocked or counterred.  Another cool thing about the fight scenes, is that the different styles played an important part. You could see when Jet Li changed from Chinese to Japanese styles and how it affected the fight.

Fist of Legend is also one of the few kicking-of-the-butt movies that I have seen that actually makes me think about the plot.  I am as ignorant about Japanese and Chinese history as I am about abstract art, but for some reason I am inspired to learn more to understand the conflict between the two contries that hosts the story of Fist of Legend; that is rare indeed.
I would give you a summary of the plot, however I think it all too likely that someone else has already done so, and thus why waste the time reiterating what has been said?

This is one martial arts fans will definitely want to watch repeatedly for its fantastic (mostly wire-free) fight scenes, and it has a decent story as well, with an underlying theme on the evils of racism.

The wire work in such movies usually spoils the action for me, too.  If there is any wire work in ""Fist of Legend, however, it is not at all apperent.  What makes an action movie entertaining is its ability to convince the audience that it isn't a movie.  Seeing ""Fist of Legend"" makes me believe that what Jet Li does on camera is the same as what he does in real life.
The fight sequences in this movie are also much more ""down to earth"" than in other typical Chinese movies.  We don't see the hero, Chen Zan, for example, knocking out fifty OTHER kung fu masters with a single swing of a quarterstaff (as in ""Twin Warriors"").  Instead, when confronted by multiple assailants, he has to fight to disable each one as quickly as possible by breaking their arms and legs etc.

It only vaguely resembles 'Chinese Connection' and I didn't think of that picture at all while watching this beautifully shot film. Fist of Legend delivers not only as an action film, but as a morality play. Although it uses many old plot devices to get the best fighters into their cloud of fists, Fist of Legend does so with an evenhanded measure of respect. One can see the admiration of foes. The conflict over the status of women and the treachery of subordinates also figure in the larger drama of racial conflict between Chinese and Japanese. There is even a scene in which the hero, a Chinese is mistaken for Japanese - something almost unheard of to these American ears. The pacing of this film is unusually good. There is not so much grumbling and posturing by wise old uncles. Even on multiple viewings you are not so likely to fast-forward to the fight scenes to get over mumbling in the middle. That said, the fight sequences are extraordinary. Li uses a varitey of styles, even a bit of Bruce Lee's own Jeet Kune Do. The match against the Japanese master is breathtaking, and in my opinion, a far better show than the final battle. A fabulous set of hand grabs and unusual moves (not to spoil it) are displayed that I have seen nowhere else. Li's own stoic attitude works excellently here where in other films it just makes him distant. In his black tunic, he is the picture of young, harboiled arrogance, only softening his resolve for his lady. Even though it is rated R for violence, I found myself wanting my 7 year old boy to see how people can conflict and still respect each other. This is a fundamental tenet of any warrior code but it is often lost in Western action movies in which conflict (and destruction) is eagerly enjoined for its own sake or for the sake of some machiavellian end. In Fist of Legend despite the fact that there are clear heroes and villians you can clearly see the reasons combattants fight and respect those reasons. All in all this period piece is a great movie experience. The fights are brilliant, the gore is mimimal, the drama is good and the film itself is state of the art - no blurry off color stuff here.

I've seen the English dubbed version on tv once, and I have to agree with a lot of people on this, it's not that good. If you can find the DVD of this in Chinese, buy it. The dubbed version is irritating to listen to. ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", a good movie is irritating to watch when in English dubbed. This only proves that Chinese movies in its original language is way better. The English version also have scenes cut from the original Chinese version. ""Fist Of Legend"" is a remake of the original movie by Bruce Lee called ""Fist Of Fury"" or ""Chinese Connection"" (English dubbed) where Li plays Chen Zhen, a Shanghai hero who rebels against the Japanese during the Japanese occupation in China. This movie and the original Bruce Lee movie wasn't made to bash the Japanese, but it is used to paint a picture to show us how it was like in China before the second world war. The Chinese version of the Bruce Lee classic is also better than the English version. Anyway, ""Fist Of Legend"" is suppose to be a tribute to Bruce Lee and in a way, Jet Li has enhanced the story line and the fighting, not to take anything away from Bruce Lee's masterpiece. Jet Li does immitate Bruce Lee's style of Jeet Kun Do when he fights like a boxer shuffling his feet, and when he shows his fellow students his training style, which is very Lee. But we also see Jet Li's style blended in with his training in the Northern Shaolin style. We see Jet Li doing fancy kicks and punches which Bruce Lee doesn't emphasize on when he fights in his movies. In that sense, Jet Li makes it more fun to watch and more intense at times. It's obvious by the way the fights are choreographed that Yuen Woo Ping is the one responsible, and I think Yuen Woo Ping is an excellent martial arts choreographer. The story behind the movie is a Bruce Lee original, but now, it's also a Jet Li classic. I highly recommend you seeing this, in it's original Chinese language of course. I also recommend you watching Bruce Lee's original film to see where it all came from. I've read that Donnie Yen who stars in a television show in Asia called ""Fist Of Fury"" is going to make a movie called ""Donnie Yen's Fist Of Fury"". He will play Chen Zhen and will re-make it like Bruce Lee's original movie. I don't know if you have seen Donnie Yen in action, he is awesome and a big Bruce Lee fan, so this future movie should be amazing. ""(Bruce Lee) Li Shao-Lung is a hero over there (Mainland China), just like everywhere else. Many young Chinese admire him and want to be like him. I'm not doing this film to say: 'Hey look, here is the new Bruce Lee!' No, it's to show my respect for his memory.

Jet-Li really seemed to have set out to move like Lee in this movie, and I was impressed by how well he pulled that off.  Yes, there's a lot of 'arms flailing' showy technique, but there are little gems here and there that are definate tips of the hat to Bruce. From the over-riding theme of adaptability in combat (as taught to Jet's character by Funakoshi), to Jet's footwork, to the very opening punch of the movie (an interception if i ever saw one) bits of JKD can be seen in this movie.  If i'm not mistaken, there's even a Muay Thai-style clinch-and-knee in one scene, which is rare for a Gung Fu movie.

His teacher dies during a challenge match at the hands of the Imperial Japanese ultra-nationalists, and Chen is out to restore the name of the Jingwu School.

904569,5,6304496672,"Well, there's nothing more i can say about this movie that everyone else hasn't already said. Yes,the dub and translation is horrible, but this is honestly the best version you're gonna get picture and sound wise unfortunately. I own both the US and the uncut HK version, and I personally prefer the uncut version which is in the original chinese language with english subs. Dubs don't cut it for me anymore. What you're missing from the uncut version is an opium smoking scene and it's not that big of a deal. The US version, however, has a much better sound in every category (effects, score, etc) and the picture is better as well. I couldn't choose one, so I own both. This is the remake of Bruce Lee's Fist of Fury (Chinese Connection in US), and it has the honor of being called a great one at that. Jet plays Chen who returns from studying in Japan after discovering the death of his master...he's convinced that he was murdered and sought out to discover the truth. He discovers a Japanese general was involved, and Jet must fight to avenge his master. Let's get to the point, Fists of Legend is by far the best work of martial arts caught on film. There is no disrespect to Bruce Lee here for Bruce was great in his own genre of fighting, which was more hardcore and real. Not all the fighting scenes in Fist of Legend are physically possible if one really thinks about it, but damn, the choreography (Woo Ping once again) makes it look so real and awesome. No other film has so many classic fights and this has major replay value. I'm a major fan of Jet, and in my opinion this is his best film ""fighting-wise"" period. Don't get me wrong,Tai Chi Master(Twin Warriors),Fong Sai Yuk(The Legend series),Once Upon a Time series, and Swordsman II were all awesome, but a lot of them have a lot of unrealistic stuff(like flying).This is a must watch for anybody.

Fist of Legend is by far the most action packed kung-fu movie I have ever seen.  As far as story goes it has a decent story to support the fight scenes in the movie.  But story is not important the fight scenes are what we watch these movies for and Fist of Legend has some of the best fight scenes in any movie peroid.  Woo-Pings choreography is second to none in this particular movie out doing even himself. Actors Jet li and Kurata(Funakoshi)deliver the best fight scene seen in any kung-fu movie.  While there is some wire work involved the way the scenes are shot and the speed with which they are delivered make the action very belevable. The other noteable thing to mention about the fight scenes is the camera angles and how frequent they change.  It seems that you are viewing the action from three angles at once which gives the viewer some awesome perspectives.  In addition there are a lot of little nuances that make the action so enjoyable.  I highly recommend this movie to any one who enjoys really good martial arts.

I'm going to have to disagree with a lot of the other reviews and say that Yuen Woo-Ping's choice to include slow-motion scenes, etc. only add to the film.  Jet Li's raw energy and athleticism, combined with his finesse and elegance, have always been his strong point.  Add to that a ferociousness that most other martial artists on celluloid today lack, and you have a powerhouse fighter who is simply UNSTOPPABLE on the screen and in the box office.  All of that still shows through in this film.  The fight scenes are packed with blinding action and are definitely above par.  The scripting and plot are well-done, along with an unusually successful portrayal of Chinese xenophobia (and Japanese aggressiveness).  It's a shame they removed the original soundtrack--as cheesy and MIDIfied as it was, it still complemented the film better than the new soundtrack (far too percussive and heavy-heanded).  Also, I'll never understand why everyone's dubbed voice is accent-free except for Jet Li's.  With Jackie Chan at least it's his own voice...",987292800,,1108,5.032967032967033

With every other film available in 3 other languages, I guess I assumed that this too would be available in at least ONE Chinese dialect (and subtitled of course).

904687,5,6304496672,"The problem with a movie like this is conveying the utter awe that I feel. This is the perennial ""martial arts flick""; utter perfection in its style.
The mythology is strong, and the sense of history evoked is excellent. The plot is simple, but enjoyable. The performances are good, but diminished somewhat by the nuances lost in the translation.
The movie distinguishes itself in the action. The fight scenes left me stunned; the choreography is beautiful, intense and intelligent. All the little details are there: if you watch closely, you can see that the characters are adapting to each other's style in mid-fight, and smiling at the adaptation! While the primary review laughs at how the action ties into the plot, I found myself emotionally engaged by the acting throughout the movie, including the action scenes.
It seems that the other reviewers' main problem with this version is the dubbing. I agree with them somewhat, but at least the dubbing studio seems to use the same voice across all of Jet Li's movies. So for an American fan who might not be able to get ahold of original audio (like me) for his work, the dubbed voice is consistant. And to be honest, the Jet Li dubbed voice isn't that bad, it's the surrounding cast's dubs that fall apart.
Also, for those who are curious, this is a bare bones DVD, with no extra features to speak of.

The story took place during the Japanese invation in 1930's. The movement of saving the nation was to burst. Chen Zhen (Jet Li), a patriot with deep thoughts had to face the constrast between national conflict and personal love. The movie successed in not only for the fighting scenes, but also the portray of Chen Zhen's character in such a complex historical content.
I have watched both the original version and the dubbed DVD version of the movie and favoured the original one. I believe that dubbing and editting lets the film lose too much of its essence and even makes it a little strange. Believe me, go and watch the VHS edition.

The length of the final fight scene which is the climax of the movie is one of the longest and best choreographed I have seen in his movies.  Yet this is actually this is only my second favorite fight scene.  The scene where he is fighting the karate master that has traveled from Japan, appeals to me the most.  The reason is simple....it is more spiritual in nature.  The fight is more about testing and showing off each other's fighting style and the sheer admiration from both fighters is something worth experiencing.  The story line is actually a remake of an existing one in Hong Kong.  Yet the revamping of the story line does not destroy the feeling of contempt for the Japanese that is felt throughout the Chinese society at that time.  This rejection of anything Japanese plays an integral role in this film.

904864,5,6304496672,Fist of Legend is easily one of the best martial arts films ever made. The fight sequences and set pieces are amazing. This is an excellent introduction to the talents of Jet Li. Its a far better film than either  Romeo Must Die or Black Mask.  This is a rather serious martial arts film.  Its a tribute to Bruce Lee and is based in part upon Lee's film The Chinese  Connection (aka Fist of Fury). Its a story of revenge and honor that also  incorporates a Romeo and Juliet type subplot involving Li and his Japanese  girlfriend. However the story takes a back seat to the amazing action  sequences which are among the best ever filmed.  The only major problem  with this version is the english dubbing. I wish that they would give you  the option of the original language track on the dvd.,960163200,3,790,4.423611111111111
904865,5,6304496672,"An absoulute masterpiece.....in my opinion, the best martial arts display of all time. Although the storyline misses the mark at times(because of loosely basing it on Chinese Connection),Jet Li's skills never do. I've  studied tae-kwon-do, have idolized such martial art classics as Fists of  Fury, Five Fingers of Death, and Five Deadly Venoms. No doubt, this is the  best of the best. This is the fourth Jet Li movie I've seen (LETHAL WEAPON,  ROMEO MUST DIE, BLACK MASK), so I'm looking forward to his entire library.  I can't see how he could possibly top this effort, but Bruce will always be  the standard when it comes to martial artists, but Jet Li takes it to  another level. All hail the man......Jet Li!  If you like ""blackbelt  theatre"" this is one of the feature presentations!",959904000,,790,4.835820895522388
904866,5,6304496672,"I watched this movie with my friend one night and I loved this movie, its the best kung-fu movie I have seen since Black Belt Jones that did not get boring after a while, like bruce lee's Chinese Connection (its a gret  kung-fu movie but it got boring after a while). This movie has a very good  plot and is action packed with karate kicks and chops. Very good tribute to  Bruce Lee, i think? BUY THIS MOVIE NOW.",959558400,,412,4.189873417721519

904868,4,6304496672,"I'd rate this film as Jet Li's best with second going to Tai Chi Master, Fong Sai Yuk 1&2, and Bodyguard from Beijing. The transfer is really good which is to be expected. However, the dubbing isn't spectacular though  I found it just above the horrid dubbing done to Fong Sai Yuk 1/2. There  are some events that lost something in the translation such as when Jet  enters his kwoon for the first time again and sees his sihing(older kung fu  brother) being challenged. But still, for anyone viewing this for the first  time, it's a great picture with alot of more down to earth, bone breaking  martial arts than high flying wirework. Of course, people will compare this  to its predecessor, Bruce Lee's Chinese Connection. I think both are great  films, and they both stand on their own as their approach to the basic plot  is different. I'd recommend this film highly...if you can get the HK  version and don't mind reading subtitles(Let's face it, we don't really  watch HK martial arts films for great dialogue) I'd recommend that a bit  more than the dubbed US version.",957744000,3,1074,4.654255319148936
904993,5,6304496672,"Jet Li is an accomplished martial artist, having won 5 consecutive all-China tournaments earlier in his career. In addition, he has top-quality style and an impressive screen presence. Fortunately, these qualities are being recognized by the film industry -- and this is a major  breakthrough for the martial arts genre. The last martial arts hero on the  screen was Bruce Lee, who, though admired universally for his exceptional  talent, his skills in acting and fight-scene choreography, and his screen  presence, was never taken too seriously by Western film-makers (his only  break in the industry was Enter The Dragon -- certainly a fantastic movie,  but not enough to open the doors for him as they should have been). It  looks like the doors may open wide for Jet Li. He may well be the new Bruce  Lee, now with all the recognition and glory that his predecessor had been  denied.
Li's martial arts skills are showcased nicely in Fist of Legend.  Li is thrilling to watch -- he's a master of many forms and has great  aptitude with a variety of weapons. The plot is a little bit thinner--and  the dialog a little cornier--than typical Western action-thrillers (though  it does have more subtlety than typical martial arts flicks).
The basic  storyline of the movie is that Chen Zhen (played by Li) during his stay in  Japan as a student, learns of his master's murder. He returns to a  Japanese-occupied Shanghai, discovers that the guy who supposedly defeated  his master in battle is really a wimp, and tracks down the real plot behind  his master's death -- all the while inflaming the Japanese authorities who  are determined to bury the investigation. Many awesome brawls must be  fought along the way.
This movie is probably does the best among all of  Li's films in showing Li's martial arts prowess. His recent movie Romeo  Must Die is a much more polished Western movie -- better plot, better  dialog -- but the martial arts in Romeo Must Die always border on the  peculiar (though very entertaining). By contrast, Fist of Legend gives the  martial arts fan what he/she is looking for in  a martial arts film.",957225600,5,2125,4.8171745152354575
904994,5,6304496672,"One of the things I liked most about this move is, even though it's a remake of a classic Bruce Lee film, Jet Li never tries to imitate Bruce's mannerisms or fighting style.  Instead he relies on his own charisma and  fighting skills to carry the movie, and pulls it off nicely.  This is  probably the best martial arts film I've ever seen, excepting Bruce Lee's  stuff of course.
Like a lot of other people I saw him first in Lethal  Weapon, then again in Black Mask, but I wasn't really blown away until I  rented Fist Of Legend - now I plan to buy every one of his movies I can get  my hands on.  My favorite scene in the entire movie was in the second  (third?) fight scene when he punched the guy in the foot - that was  awesome!  Talk about making a statement.  I also enjoyed being able to pick  out the different styles used in the fight scenes.  Especially the last  fight with the General, with his straightforward, powerful striking style,  the whole thing was very well done.
By the way, I just saw ""Romeo Must  Die"" this weekend and it was great.  Very well produced, with a good plot  & lots of great actors, some welcome humor (not at Jet Li's expense, of  course) plus the incredible fight scenes we've come to expect.

I mean this is one (if not thee) the finest Jet Li movies, and yet it gets a crap release on DVD...  I'm not even going to mention the dubbing & the special features - that's a joke in its own right.
The only decent thing about the DVD is the picture quality, its nice and crisp - just goes to show Disney can do something right for a change!

It was the first time I saw a Jet Li film. The fight seens are  very good a 5 star for the film, but the DVD is a major let since its been  ditributed by Disney who haven't heard of extra features and think scene  selection and interactive menus which aren't interactive at all are special  features.

WHO CARES!  be astounded by the actual fights!  The movie had a good plot, and the transition from scene to scene was smooth. It wasn't slow and didn't waste a lot of time on certain scenes like a lot of movies do. Every minute of this movie was very entertaining. Nearly every scene had a fight sequence which made the movie even better.

This movie is entertainment, pure and simple. It's got a decent  plot, excellent fight scenes that were well choreographed (another good job  by ping). The music was fine, ambient enough that if you don't like it, you  could ignore (though I enjoyed it for what it was). As for Jet Li's acting,  it was fine, and in my opinion it gave the impression that while yes, he  was hot tempered and all that, he was ultimately in control of himself,  something perhaps he gained while being away at school. So, this movie is  defintely worth watching if you're in the mood to be entertained, and enjoy  well choreographed fighting scenes. A must have for any Jet Li fan.",954547200,,898,4.426829268292683

905057,1,6304496672,"ok there are many things to complain abt this movie.  i'll start off w/the character chen zhen...like one of the reviewers who posted earlier...chen zhen is a patriotic hot-tempered individual w/an unorthodox fighting style.  jet li played this role too cooly which takes the patriotism of chen zhen  out.  there was a lack of emotion from jet which chen zhen is very  emotional and tempered by just abt anything.  jet li was worse than dead in  this role.
second...the fighting...my god was that suppose to be jeet  kune do or something similar to an unorthodox fighting style?  HHHHHHELLLLL  NO!  jet li was jumping barely one inch off the ground when bruce lee  jumped like three inches, and he jumped around as if he was gay or pregnant  *shudder*...i still can't get that image out of my mind.  and whats with  the fist like that...chen zhen would have held his hands as loose as  possible so as not to let his opponent know of his next move...whats w/jet  li holding it up to his face like that?  what is this  ""streetfighter"" or something?
third the music...very weak.  there was nothing that stirred up emotion, nothing that arouses ppl's  attention, it wasn't even fast paced dammit!  and it doesnt matter whether  its dubbed or not, i saw both versions, and they both lack  substance.
before seeing fist of legend, i saw the chinese connection  from bruce, and ""fist of fury"" from donnie yen, a tv series.  and  i must say both versions are much better than fist of legend.  in  ""fist of fury"" the tv series, donnie yen's goal was to relive the  bruce lee classic and his portrayal of chen zhen was emotional, heart-felt,  and he was a rebel and hot-tempered, playing it the way bruce lee did and  it was great...he even used the nunchunks and those scenes were beyond  amazing...i wouldn't waste my time w/fist of legend and i'm sorry that i  did.",953683200,2,1858,4.632716049382716

I own the subtitled version and just got to see the  Dubbed version. All the greatest lines are lost and the musical score  supernaturally makes the end bad guy look weaker than Jet Li throughout the  entire fight, and in the subtitled version thanks to the music, he seems  invincible. When JEt fights the blindfolded master in the subtitled  version... before and after the fight there is some incredible philosophy  on martial arts and fighting... which was complaetly lost when it was  dubbed over.

as noted by other reviewers, the dubbing is sub par and disappointingly, this DVD doesn't include tracks in Chinese.
the story itself pales in comparison to Bruce Lee's The Chinese Connection; Jet Li seems miscast for the role of Chen Zhen. by many accounts, Zhen was an unorthodox fighter and very hot tempered... a good fit for Bruce Lee but appeared disjointed when portrayed by Jet Li, who is at heart an extremely traditional martial artist.
oddly, Jet Li's first fight sequence at the school was, i thought, a very good intepretation but then his 'Zhen' became too reflective and composed.
the intensity of the character and the events is entirely missing in Fist of Legend -- missing as well is notable incident regarding the proclaimation of 'no dogs or Chinese allowed.' an integral signpost to the cultural legend of Chen Zhen.
interestingly enough, this version does give a popular alternative to Zhen's 'death' which is different than the one given in the Chinese Connection.",953164800,,1181,4.91

For instance, in one  scene he is fighting a master. Jet Li changes his fighting style and the  maser says ""Huh? What style is that?""

905153,1,6304496672,"Let me start by saying the Chinese version of this film is my favorite movie of all time.
Dimension's dubbing and the liberties they take with the orginal script is both shocking and tactless. North American viewers  who watch this version only see about 70% of the actual script. The rest of  the sub-plots are all lost (particularly with the cook and the Dizzy Star  House) and the simplified story also leads you to believe that Chinese  Wushu is just a poor imitation of Japanese Karate when in the original  script both country's martial arts were put into a positive light.
They  can't even get the translation right at the end of the movie. The sign  clearly reads,""Sick Men of Asia"" and the dubbing has General  Fujita pointing at his sign saying ""I have a sign here that says  'Ching Wu is closed'.""
Either the editors were saying that the  Japanese General was an illiterate moron or, more likely, the American  dubbing team didn't even bother looking at the sign before they translated  the story.
You can buy this version, but my recommendation would be to  watch it as a silent movie with the mute button on at all times. But you  really are better off buying the VCD or VHS versions instead of this  travesty.",951436800,10,1223,4.597222222222222

While Jet is not the fluid and funky martial arts specimen that Bruce was, his more stoic style has it's own charm.  Nevertheless, Jet  does include some obvious references to Lee's fighting style that the  cognoscente should recognize and appreciate.  Fist of Legend also benefits  from being one of the better looking Hong Kong films of recent times, as  the print used for this DVD looks gorgeous.  Frequently, even fairly new  films show signs of fading and damage on the source materials, but that is  fortunately not the case here.  My one complaint in regards to the overall  quality of the disc itself is that subtitles and an option for the original  language soundtrack are not available.  Now, as for the fight sequences  themselves, they are all quite ably choreographed by the master, Yuen Woo  Ping, who many will recall brought true Hong Kong flavor to last year's The  Matrix.  Two fights in particular that stand out, are the one's in which  Jet Li battles a Japanese master while both are blindfolded, and the  intense closing fight with the ever capable Billy Chau.

905160,3,6304496672,"Well, this review is mainly written for those who are already familiar with the movie and have yet to see this DVD version of it. First the good news. The picture quality is better than I have ever seen it on video,  which is to be expected from the transfer. The colors are vivid and the  lines are sharp, and overall the picture is cleaned up considerably. Also  the sound is much clearer and in stereo, although there are moments where  it seems the foley and looping are a little bit off (I'm hoping it's not  the notorious DVD lip-synch problem, although since this movie is dubbed  it's difficult to tell). That's about all for the good.
Now the bad.  First off, as I mentioned, this version is dubbed (and no there isn't an  original language option), and quite badly at that. This is regrettable  considering that one thing that made the original so great was that it was  multi-lingual, where Japanese spoke Japanese, Chinese spoke Cantonese and  the Westerners spoke English. Here everything is dubbed into English, so  the character differentiation is lost. Plus the voiceovers are wooden and  unnaturally stilted, and the gist of the dialogue often strays from what is  written in the subtitled version, which sometimes causes key thematic  material to be lost (ie. Chen's lecture to the other students concerning  the importance of a powerful attack). This, of course, is a common problem  concerning dubbing.
Secondly, that great title music has been wiped out  and replaced with something more typical, more ""dramatic"" in  terms of Hollywood thinking, I suppose.
Finally, and I think this is the  most unforgivable thing, the ending has been truncated and the dialogue  overtly distorted to completely change the context. I won't say what it is,  but I'll just say the original ending had much more resonance than the new  one. Also, the new ending cuts out the segment that shows what becomes of  the Jing Woo school. I have no idea why they chose to cut that part out--it  doesn't even detract from the new ending, so what's the point?
Still, the  fight scenes, which are among the best ever filmed, are in their entirety,  and they look better than ever, and I guess that's most important. It's  just too bad that they felt the need to tinker with the movie, making it  overall not as strong as the original.",950486400,38,2326,4.745
905266,5,6304496672,"Jet Li has succeeded in picking up the legacy Bruce Lee left behind. WOW... I saw this movie, expecting another ""Black Mask"" type movie and was floored. The story, the music, the acting, most of all, the  fight scenes...superb. Bruce Lee would be proud.
P.S. For those this may  concern...I was intrigued by the slow, fluted music played throughout the  movie and would love to know if it is obtainable. Please let me know.",950486400,,423,4.6891891891891895
905267,5,6304496672,"Jet Li, affectionately called Boss Li in Hong Kong, stars in this remake of Bruce Lee's Chinese Connection (a.k.a. Fists of Fury in China).  The difference is this one's better.  You don't agree?  I'll do my best to convert ya.  Li stars as Chen Zhen, a student in 1930's Japanese occupied China.  He returns home upon receiving news of his master's death, who was supposedly beaten by a Japanese master in a challenge.  Li smells a rat and challenges the Japanese master in return, to find the master's fighting ability's terribly inadequate to have defeated his old master.  Li has the body exhumed and tested for poison, and we find that the old master was indeed murdered after all. And Li wants revenge.  This is a truly amazing flick.  The fights, performed with minimal wire work as found in other period martial arts pieces, are a showcase for the stupifyingly amazing martial abilities of it's star, and standout moments include the opening fight between Li and a slew of Japanese fighters and the duel between Li and his japanese girlfriend's uncle, an older, wiser fighter who, before the duel, insists that older fellas need a minute or two to warm up. Unlike the Bruce Lee film the Japanese are not presented as monsters, and this film goes out of it's way to prove it, whereas the Lee film goes out of it's way to show how heinous they are.  Jet Li is a true phenomenon, and to quote the Hong Kong movie oriented book,...'Nuff said.",950313600,,1446,4.635294117647059
905268,5,6304496672,"To begin with, I am only a luke warm fan of modern Hong Kong action. That clarified, I must say that I was amazed when I watched FIST OF LEGEND (VHS). The quality of the film was astounding! Sharply focused visuals,  superb action shots, great color, good transitions, almost no distracting  jumps and zooms, etc., etc. I cannot add anything to other's comments about  Jet Li, he is remarkable. However, this video places him in a fantastic new  (for me) context where he looks even better. Few were the rough spots,  obvious speedups, obscure references, and strictly regional idioms that I  find so distracting or confusing. There were only a couple abrupt  transitions and most of the story flowed smoothly through realistic sets  and backgrounds. Truely, this was the genre at its visual very best.",950227200,,802,4.888888888888889
905269,4,6304496672,"This remake of Fist of Fury is done with such incredible detail and loaded with the best martial arts seqences since the Bruce Lee movies.  Bruce Lee paved the way, but with Fist of Legend, Jet Li adds another dimension of  depth and meaning to the martial arts scenes.  The story is incredible and  realistic, the action is justified and the politics of the movie remind me  of Citizen Kane, Glory, Apocalypse Now, Last Emperor, and other films  throughout the decades that deconstructed the politics of the times now and  past.  A must see for any film lover of any genre.",950054400,,574,4.6138613861386135
905270,5,6304496672,"When you watch this movie, you will know why I rated it as 5 stars.  Even for non-action fans, I'm sure that they will be impressed with the excellent choreography and martial art skills displayed in this movie.  I  only wish that this movie can be released in America because I'm sorry to  say, but Lethal Weapon 4 and Black Mask does not do Jet Li any justice.  This is by far the best martial arts movie (next to Jackie Chan's Drunken  Master II) I have ever seen, and I have seen many good ones.  Although the  plot seems like a typical martial arts movie (it is Jet Li's tribute to  Bruce Lee), there is plenty of second-to-none action scenes to keep you  hooked. This is a must see for all martial arts fans and anyone, especially  for those who have only seen his American movies!",948412800,,787,4.321917808219178
905271,5,6304496672,"Being a big fan of Jet Li, I first saw this movie a few years ago and my opinion has not changed since. If you are a fan of Jet Li's flawless fighting form, then THIS is the movie for you. Some of his best fight  scenes are in THIS movie and you WILL NOT be disappointed when you buy it.  If Lethal Weapon 4 and The Black Mask are the only movies of his you have  ever seen, all I have to say is, ""I'm sorry"". Although those  movies were good, they DID NOT show what 'The Man' is capable of. This is  one of the few movies where he is able to show the full extent of his  breathtaking talent and unblemished form. I can't say enough about this  movie! It is a MUST SEE for all martial arts movie fans!",948240000,6,701,3.86013986013986
905272,5,6304496672,"Some may balk at the fact that this movie is a remake of the Bruce Lee classic, ""Chinese Connection"" (originally entitled ""Fists of Fury""--the current ""Fists of Fury"" was originally entitled  ""Big Boss Man""--don't ask me why they created this confusion),  this is perhaps one of the best martial arts movies of all time, and  certainly one of Jet Li's best offerings.
It would be nothing less than  gross negligence for a self-respecting martial arts fan to go without  OWNING this movie.",947376000,,488,4.902439024390244
905273,4,6304496672,"Fist of Legend is one of the best films I've ever seen from Hong Kong industry. With the star of ""Once upon a time in China"" - a highly recommended film, the story is very interesting.
It would be good to  mention the bilingual all-the-time use of japanese and chinese in the film.  Also, the no-prejudice view of japanese and chinese is very important.
But, there is one strange thing: uniforms of japanese soldiers, in that  age, if I am not wrong, were black, not dark-green. It seems to me that the  japanese uniforms in this film are from the Popular Army of China.",940550400,,570,4.451923076923077

May I recommend INVINCIBLE  ARMOR one of the best Kung-Fu movies ever, and blows this movie away in a  heartbeat.",937353600,,376,4.194444444444445
905384,4,6304496672,"The fight scenes in this movie were much ballyhooed.  To me, it's the same slow-motion, often sluggish execution as Lo Wei's chop-socky granddaddy films.  Director Gordon Chan has shown his remarkable good taste and deft  action direction in The Final Option and First Option, so I'd have to  attribute the poor execution to choreographer.  Yuen Wo Ping.  In an  interview with Chan he's also mentioned how Yuen would interfere with the  cinematic handling of the fight scenes (eg. ""We gotta shoot this one  in slow-mo"", and so on).  That would explain the dated execution of  the martial-arts sequences.
That aside, this is a remarkable martial-arts  film -- in-depth characterization, a refreshing lack of xenophobia  (finally, a Chinese fight movie that doesn't portray the Japanese as  foaming, brain-dead villains), good solid dialogue, and good acting all  around, even from the token love interest.  Jet Li is lovable as well as  kinetic, mixing aggressive tendencies with his trademark endearing  presence.  And Chan's script is high-quality, leading to the final  confrontation gracefully (until the bad editing and cinematic choices,  unfortunately, make this final confrontation unsatisfying and  clumsy).
However, definitely one for the history books, if only for  bringing so many non-martial-arts-film virtues into such a firmly  martial-arts movie, transcending its innate generic conceits.",935884800,5,1405,5.580952380952381

Better acting, more beliveble characters,better fight scenes, and an imppresive production. Indeed, one  of Jet li's best, and an overall MASTERPIECE.",931564800,,267,5.512195121951219
905473,5,6304496672,"After seeing Leathal Weapon 4 I wanted to see more of Jet Li.  So I visited numerous Jet Li sites on the Web to decide on what movie I should see.  Nearly all the sites I visited ranked Fist of a Legend amoung the  best Jet Li movies (Quite often it was the highest rated).  So I purchased  it, here, from Amazon.
Now, after watching it I can say it deserves all  the praise it gets.  Since then I've seen several Jet Li films, and this is  far and away the best.
It is a remake of the classic Bruce Lee film The  Chinese Conection.  It takes it a step further though, improving on the  plot and, yes, even the martial arts.  The action choreographer is  definitely one of the best in the business also being the fight  choreographer behind the great Jackie Chan movie Drunken Master, and more  resently he even made Keanu Reeves look good in The Matrix.
Most modern  Kung Fu movies (besides Jakie Chan movies) seem to use a lot of wires.  What this means is that people seem to fly through the air during fight  scenes.  To me the effect all too often looks cheesy.  Well, this movie  seems to use fewer wires, and the wires they do use look alright.
Jet  shows his amazing abilies throughout the movie, and he is defitily one of  the best I've seen.  I'd put him right up there with Bruce Lee and Jakie  Chan.
In conclusion... See this movie.",923702400,4,1344,4.258964143426295
