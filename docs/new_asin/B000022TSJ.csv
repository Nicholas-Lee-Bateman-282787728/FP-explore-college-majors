1250415,2,B000022TSJ,"This was supposed to be part 2 of the original Universal Soldier with Jean Claude returning as the hero. Note that there was already a low budget knock off of #2 and #3 previously released without Jean Claude.  Unfortunately, this low-budget sequel had none of the ambiance or realism  that the original movie contained. In fact, if not for the title, you would  not have known that this was the second part. Nothing from this movie  linked the first movie (except for an occasional flash back). The weapons  and outfits were poor. The premise was weak and and the special effects  were either poor (as in bullets bouncing off car windows) or non existent.  The only thing that carried over from the last movie (and all his other  movies) was Jean Claude getting beatup through-out the movie in spite of  the fact that he was supposed to be a ""Universal Soldier""  hinself. We were are pretty dissappointed with this one. It was a comedic  ripoff of a good film.",946857600,,961,4.627218934911243

1250461,4,B000022TSJ,"Universal Soldier: The Return is the 1999 installation of the Universal Soldier series and the second sequel of the Universal Soldier series, following the 2 1998 made for TV films.

In this 4th installment, following the events of the 1992 film, ex-Universal Soldier, Luc Deveraux is now human again and is working alongside his best friend, Maggie, and scientist, Dylan Cotner to create a newer, stronger, and safer army of Universal Soldiers. The soldiers are connected and programmed through an artificially intelligent computer named S.E.T.H. standing for Self-Evolving Thought Helix.

Unfortunately Dylan's project loses its funding and S.E.T.H. is scheduled to be shut down due to budget cuts. When S.E.T.H. becomes aware of what's going to happen, it shapes itself into human form, turns many of the UniSols against the organization, and works with the  powerful Romeo (Bill Goldberg) to destroy all of mankind. When the conventional military fails to ensure the safety of humanity, Luc teams with the general of the organization, General Radford to shut down S.E.T.H. and restore order among the Universal Soldiers

Overall: I don't see why many people like to bash this installation of the Universal Soldier series. The Return is actually a really decently made movie. The pace tends to go back and forth between slow and fast at times but the plot is still good enough to watch and enjoy.",1430784000,,1399,5.149779735682819

1250494,3,B000022TSJ,"Jean Claude Van Damme returns to one of his most popular roles in his first sequel, a film that ignores two made-for-television sequels, and would itself be completely ignored by the subsequent releases in the series.  For the greater good of the entire franchise, I'm totally in favor of that.  While the sequels that eventually followed are totally superior (in my opinion) to this and the original, this is still a fun movie that doesn't take itself too seriously.  The cast hams it up and the general awesomeness of Michael Jai White (Blood & Bone) shines through as usual.

What is a Universal Soldier or UniSol?  UniSols are reanimated dead soldiers who are designed to be stronger, faster, and more obedient than the average trooper.  Van Damme plays Luc Deveraux, a former (?) UniSol who now helps the U.S. military control and train the current crop of corpses for general warmongering.  They no longer have any fear of the UniSols going ape-scat because they have developed an A.I. computer system called S.E.T.H. (voiced & eventually embodied by Michael Jai White) to keep them all in (and on) line.  The viewer doesn't have to be too familiar with the works of Asimov & Crichton to see what's coming.  Adding to the chaos is an ambitious/aggravating reporter (Heidi Schanz, Se7en) determined to get her ""scoop"", no matter what the cost.

This flick raised a few questions that are never really answered, like: How is he a ""former"" UniSol?  Is he no longer (un)dead?  How on earth does he now have a daughter?  If his daughter was fully grown that would make some sense but she's like 10.  I know I should have my head examined for even suggesting a movie like this explain anything but it's hard not to speculate.  This is why the John Hyams' flicks that followed tried to pretend that this film didn't exist.  But the questions this flick raises still don't end!  Why is it that the normally silent Van Damme plays a character who's more chatty than any he'd ever done, in a sequel to a movie where he hardly said a word?  Is the guy who plays Squid (Brent Hinkley, Falling Down)  somehow the hellish offspring of Bill Paxton & Tim Blake Nelson?

The action is never great but it's decent and, again, fun.  Wrestler Bill Goldberg is no adequate replacement for Dolph Lundgren but seems to have a blast blowin' stuff up and getting repeatedly kicked in the face.  Probably a lot like his day job.  The action gets a little bit better once S.E.T.H. becomes personified.  MJW & JCVD show some cool kicks but their climactic brawl still leaves a lot to be desired.  I've never been a huge fan of Van Damme, especially as a screen fighter (excepting ""No Retreat, No Surrender"" of course), so, considering that, it's not bad.

This could have been a lot better with some minor improvements.  The soundtrack is saturated with Heavy Metal music of the day and would've been better with a little variety.  Its inclusion makes more sense than it did in, say, Dario Argento's ""Phenomena"", but gets to be too much after a while.  Also, I despise sexism, but when you have an annoying female character whose presence adds little to the proceedings beyond eye candy, she should probably remove some garments at some point.  I'm just sayin'.

The DVD from Sony/Tri-Star has good picture quality but is, unfortunately, fullscreened. Oh, well.  It does little harm while viewing.  The run time is 83 minutes and has a decent amount of special features, including a ""making of"" featurette, talent files, interviews and more.  I can't recommend this (or really even say that it's good) but I liked it anyway and as a vehicle for Van Damme one could do much worse.  2.5 out of 5.

1250506,2,B000022TSJ,"""Universal Soldier: The Return"" starts out with a quiet, peaceful swamp scene which is very suddenly interrupted by a chase involving about a half-dozen speed boats. It's startling and rather well done. Enjoy it. That's the highlight of the movie. From that point on the movie is a snorer. The acting is bad, at best. The plot is based on hocus-pocus science fiction where super-humans are manufactured and re-manufactured. Yaawwwnnnn! I could hardly wait for the closing credits. Well, in between  there was fighting and more fighting, machine  guns blazing and explosions tearing material objects to shreds. If you really enjoy seeing things destroyed, then this is your kind of movie. Oh, and if  there's a star in the movie, it's a fellow named Romeo. Go ahead and  suffer, but don't say you weren't warned.

1250509,3,B000022TSJ,"Universal Soldier: The Return is set several years after the events that occurred in the first film. Luc Devereaux (played by Jean-Claude Van Damme) is no longer a Universal Soldier, but he does run the new advanced program for the government. The new soldiers are stronger and faster. They are controlled by an advanced computer program called S.E.T.H. When the government wants to shutdown the program, S.E.T.H. takes control of building and the soldiers. Luc Devereaux is the only one that can shut down the program, but S.E.T.H. is one step ahead of Luc, as the UniSol Romeo (played by Bill Goldberg) kidnaps Luc's 13-year-old daughter Hillary.

The Universal Solider franchise is hard to follow as The Return ignores the two previous made-for-TV sequels and The Return is ignored by the two newest sequels, Regeneration and Day of Reckoning. The Return's plot is really thin. I'm not for sure why the producers wanted to change the tone and ignore a few facts from the first movie. The acting and dialogue is B-movie quality, but the movie does have some great action scenes, starting with the boat chase in the opening and ending with Van Dame fighting Goldberg.

1250511,4,B000022TSJ,"Universal Soldier-The Return(released August/99)is certainly an underrated sequel to the first Universal Soldier. The film is filled with lots of action and suspense mixed with a nice on going sub plot concerning the value of family and love. Van Damme is certainly on top of his acting game in this one.
The story concerns the Uni-sol project and Luc Deveraux(Van Damme)who this time around is a consultant and trainer for the project. His wife has passed on and he is a single father who has one daughter Hillary(Karis Bryant)who he dotes over lovingly. One day the overseeing General Radford(Danile Von Bargon)informs the project team that he has to pull the plug on the project. It has become a liability and the government won't stand for anymore mishaps. SETH,the artificial intelligence that runs the computer systems including commanding the Uni-sols themselves,decides this is against protocol and initiates a defensive posture. He takes over total control of all systems and instructs the soldiers to clear the facility in preparations for a total assault on the outside world.
Luc possesses the code which would be able to terminate SETH and with his help the General tries repeatedly to shut things down but without success;with much loss of military life in the process. In the meantime SETH has gone from a computer based intelligence into a human host(Michael Jai White).He also kidnaps Luc's daughter from her hospital bed and holds her as a bargaining chip. In the finale of the film Luc and SETH battle toe to toe until Luc manages to turn on the cryo freezing unit which turns SETH into a human popsicle;this in turn enables Luc to give one last high flying kick which disintegrates SETH into pieces. As Luc runs from the building he shoots and ignites explosives which destroys both the building and the remaining Uni-Sols. The film ends with Luc reunited in his daughter's arms.
As I mentioned above Van Damme was definitely on his acting game in this one and it is especially evident in his on screen relationship with his daughter. He emotes all the right feelings at just the right moments throughout and this is one of his better moments on the screen in that regard. Michael White makes for a very menacing SETH and ex football player/wrestler Bill Goldberg makes a fine antagonist to our hero Luc. Fine acting,supporting and lead,all the way through makes this an enjoyable action romp. Once the action starts there is no let up.
Technically the film has been transferred well and the picture is crisp and clear. There is a little inherent graininess now and again but nothing major. This DVD is a dreaded DDD(double sided disc) so be very careful re scuffing and scratching. One side has the widescreen version and the other the full screen. The film is also available in Dolby 2 and 5.1 sound. Extras include the trailer,talent files,an almost 4 minute look into the work out routine of Mr. White,a making-of featurette and a look at some of Van Damme's other film product for Columbia Tri-Star with comments by Van Damme on them and his career.
In conclusion I do recommend this film/DVD.A very nice fast moving action packed sequel to the original,with Van Damme on top of his game.",1275782400,,3213,4.875685557586837
1250512,5,B000022TSJ,Excellent movie! A must have along with the the other two sequels: The Return and Next Generation.,1271376000,,98,4.823529411764706
1250513,1,B000022TSJ,"Seven years after the original ""Universal Soldier"" was a worldwide box office success, and two made for TV sequels bored audiences at home, Tristar Pictures released ""Universal Soldier: The Return"". Serving as the first ""official"" sequel to the 1992 original, this film brought back star Jean-Claude Van Damme, but even his presence wasn't enough to bring back repeat business for this lackluster film.

""Universal Soldier: The Return"" picks up several years after the events of the previous movie. Now, Luc Deveraux (Jean-Claude Van Damme) is a technical adviser/trainer for the next generation of UniSol's. Led by a powerful supercomputer named S.E.T.H. (Michael Jai White) this new crop of soldiers is more controlled, faster, and deadlier than their predecessors. However, when the government seeks to cut the funding to the UniSol program altogether, S.E.T.H. takes drastic measures to protect his army and ensure his survival no matter the cost.

You know, it's never a good sign for a movie, when the moment the first scene ends the viewer is already rolling his eyes at how ridiculous everything has been thus far. From that first scene alone, which was also the film's first action sequence (talk about not wasting anytime), I already had a growing suspicion that I was going to regret watching this movie. Of course, much to my dismay the remaining hour and twenty minutes or so managed to prove my suspicions correct; leaving me with 90 minutes of my life stripped away with nary an ounce of enjoyment from the experience.

The story for ""Universal Soldier: The Return"" sounded like a promising follow-up to the vastly superior original film. Yet, a promising story does not always make for a good movie, and screenwriters William Malone (""Supernova"") and John Fasano (""Darkness Falls"") saw to that. The plot for this entry is so riddled with holes and inconsistencies that it is borderline incoherent and I for one was stunned that the studio even allowed this movie to see the light of day. Events in the movie would repeat themselves, bits of information previously brought to light in an earlier scene would be rehashed (with the same characters present, mind you) as if the information had never been heard before. Not to mention, the dialogue is so amateurish that it is more cringe inducing than the worst written daytime soap opera or your typical tweens show on the Disney Channel.

The action sequences are average at best, some of them were exciting, but for the most part even they felt tired and boring. I would have never suspected that fight scenes could become so generic that I could almost doze off, yet somehow this movie found a way. What's surprising about how run-of-the-mill the action in this film was is that two skilled martial artists are involved in the movie, Jean-Claude Van Damme and Michael Jai White. One should feel fairly confident in the assumption that with two martial artists on the set, that one of them could have ensured that at least the action sequences would be top-notch. However, that assumption would be incorrect. Not to mention the director, Mic Rogers, is no stranger to action movies having served as Assistant Director on several high-profile films, such as ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" and ""Wanted"". Apparently, no matter who was involved in this production, with horribly written material as the backbone, it was only a matter of time before the rest of the movie would begin to suffer.

Speaking of other areas that suffered in this movie, the acting in this film was laughable at best. Sole returning cast member Jean-Claude Van Damme was given far too many comedic moments (whether intentional or not) that his character didn't even remotely feel like the same man from the original. I just have a hard time picturing the Luc Deveraux from the first film, whether an active UniSol or not, kicking and/or punching some bad guy, then spouting off some lame one-liner. Also, I guess no one noticed that in the first movie, Jean-Claude's dialogue was kept to a minimum to disguise his thick accent that didn't fit his namesake; however, in this film no such effort was made and his accent was a definite distraction.

As if the problems with Jean-Claude's performance weren't enough, the movie's villains didn't fare any better. Serving as the main antagonists to Jean-Claude are former WWE wrestler Bill Goldberg (""Half Past Dead 2"") and martial arts expert Michael Jai White (""Spawn""). Bill Goldberg must have been under the impression that the method of ""acting"" used in the WWE is the same for movies. Because every line he speaks or grunts or whatever, sounds as if he's giving a sound bite from a cue card on ""Monday Night Raw"". His lines all fall flat and his acting is so wooden that he makes Keanu Reeves look lively.

As for Michael Jai White, his fighting ability looks to be above reproach as he believably holds his own against the skills of Van Damme. As for his acting it's not nearly as impressive in this film. I've seen him in other movies, and typically he turns in a solid performance, but like everything else in this abysmal film, his acting manages to fall well short of expectations and/or talent.

I feel fairly safe in saying that if given the opportunity, every single person associated with this movie would go back and undo the damage this movie did to the franchise, and potentially to their careers. This is especially true for Jean-Claude, who shortly after this film's release began to see his movies making their way to Direct-to-DVD shelves everywhere. This movie is a prime example of what can happen when money talks more than quality, and the end result is nothing short of terrible.

Lastly, ""Universal Soldier: The Return"" is one of those rare films that will make you question your sanity for even bothering to finish the movie. Very few action films will make you long for the most brainless Direct-to-DVD efforts, but this one does its level best to do so.

""Universal Soldier: The Return"" is rated R for violence, language, and nudity.",1268438400,2,6036,4.8857421875
1250514,2,B000022TSJ,"The official sequel to Universal Soldier (1992), Universal Soldier: The Return (1999) is a lower budget continuation of the saga that offers little that is new, and is disappointing in most every way.  Granted, the original film was like a comic book, and far from classic science fiction, but the concept was somewhat interesting.  Unfortunately, the quality of script and production values of the sequel, is several levels below the original.  The opening action sequence involving a boat chase in a swamp, is actually the most exciting and well-executed action scene in the entire movie.  Nothing that follows makes much sense, or seems very believable.

Jean-Claude Van Damme returns as Luc Deveraux, the former universal soldier (Unisol), is now an advisor for the revamped UNISOL 2500 program.  Once again there are problems, both with unisols going berserk, and with the master computer named SETH that is in control of each Unisol.  When the Department of Defense decides to close down the Unisol program, SETH acts to keep the Unisols viable, employing Romeo (Billy Goldberg), a hulkish unisol with an evil grin, as his point man.  SETH is a talking computer, voiced by Michael Jai White, who mechanically issues audible commands.  Even in 1999, a talking computer used a device to explain plot elements, was pretty lame.

The storyline in the sequel is that Deveraux married reporter Veronica Roberts, played by Ally Walker (Profiler) in the original movie.  Veronica has died, leaving Deveraux with a daughter, Hillary.  Fitness expert Kiana Tom (Bodyshaping) makes her feature film debut as Luc's assistant Maggie.  When SETH takes over the facility, Maggie gets Hillary to safety, although the girl is injured and requires hospitalization.  Meanwhile Deveraux continues to have a thing for reporters, this time it is Erin Young (Heidi Schanz) who has lost her cameraman and needs rescuing.  Schanz is dressed like TV's Nancy Drew, and bears a slight resemblance to Ally Walker.  Her character is soon in the familiar role, of the scared chick tagging along for the ride.

The best is yet to come, as SETH takes human form, inhabiting Michael Jai White's fabulously well built body.  Led by Luc, the army mounts an assault on the facility, with disastrous results.  Needing a secure computer line, Luc and Erin naturally wind up at a strip club, for some gratuitous nudity, and bouncer ballbusting.  SETH needs a security code from Deveraux, and kidnaps Hillary from the hospital.  Romeo continues to inflict damage, claiming Maggie as one of his victims.  Back in the lab, Deveraux's battle with SETH features some athletic maneuvers and fancy footwork, with almost a dozen glass panes shattered along the way.  Too bad for SETH, he winds up in pieces himself.  For all his talk, he accomplished practically nothing.  Without making sure his daughter is safe, Luc sets off a huge chain reaction explosion that takes the down the whole facility, and the remaining unisols, bringing this poorly written and acted mess, to a close.  Action fans may get a few laughs from The Return, but if this atrocious film is memorable, it will probably not be for a good reason.

The dual sided disc contains both widescreen and fullscreen versions,  and also has a few special features, including a Van Damme featurette, some workout tips from Michael Jai White, and short making of featurette.

1250527,4,B000022TSJ,"The Jean Claude Van Damme Review Matrix (JCVD-RM)

1. Who is he? Luc Devereaux, the only remaining Universal Soldier (UNISOL) from the first experiment.  He now serves as technical expert to UNISOL 2500, the second generation, which has resulted in a stronger, faster, more deadly warrior.
2. Which family member/friend must be avenged? Not only does Dr. Dylan Cotner (Xander Berkeley) - the lead project scientist - get fried, but his daughter also falls into danger.
3. Does he take his shirt off? No, but Romeo (professional wrestler Bill Goldberg), the alpha male of all the UNISOLs, is constantly shirtless.
4. Does he have sex with a C-List actress?  I hoped that there'd be copulation with his partner Maggie (Kiana Tom), but sad disappointment hit me when the credits rolled.
5. Is there a tournament? No structured tournament.
6. Is training needed for this tournament? As a regeneration from the first experiment, JCVD has all the training he needs
7. Does he do the splits in training or in the tournament?  The splits are in full force when JCVD delivers a sack-stretching spin kick to SETH (Michael Jai White) - Self-Evolving Thought Helix - the advanced computer system controlling the new genetically enhanced soldiers that implanted its programming and consciousness into human form.
8. Does he punch someone in the balls?  Since the UNISOLs don't feel pain, but need to breathe, the throat-shot replaces the groin-shot in this one.
9. Does he do a series of flying or 360 kicks?  OMG!  I'm dizzy!
10. Is his enemy unbeatable? SETH isn't quite SkyNet, and the UNISOLs aren't quite Terminators; so, JCVD has a manageable, yet difficult foe.
11. Does he overcome an injury or other hindrance?  While Luc is battling the new and improved UNISOL army, he has to contend with an beautiful but irritating reporter named Erin (Heidi Schanz)
12. Does he win?  Judgment day averted.

After one of the most ridiculous opening jet-ski, machine gun scenes in cinema history, Kiana Tom's shirt got ripped open for a bra shot.  I immediately thought this movie, like Kiana, had potential.  I was not disappointed.

When a Pentagon General (Daniel von Bergen) gets the nod to shut down the UNISOL program, SETH takes action to defend itself.  Exhausting all options, Devereaux and gang try to shut SETH down manually and face resistance.  Without a secret code, known only by Devereaux, SETH will shut down in eight hours; so, the computer begins military actions and decryption of the code ala the WOPR in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/War-Games/dp/0792838467/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">War Games</a>.

This is an enjoyable JCVD flick, but there are four problems I had with it.  One, SETH was supposed to be five-times as fast/strong/etc. as a person, so regardless of how awesome JCVD is, it should have been a mismatch.  Somehow, however, SETH doesn't avoid an awesome JCVD flying 360.  Two, all of Bill Goldberg's lines should have been grunts.  His physique is imposing, but his acting is terrifying.  Three, the reporter Erin was completely unnecessary, and at times blocked the movie's flow like an infected kidney stone.  And, four, Kiana didn't get naked (this may not be a valid argument).

Overall, this is JCVD fun.  Tons of kicks.  Even more gun-fighting and explosions.  Decent acting, albeit with a diluted plot, makes this a good follow-up storyline and a mid-level JCVD movie, which makes it better than most action movies in general.  Guilty pleasure awesomeness.",1243728000,7,3528,5.154657293497364
1250528,2,B000022TSJ,"Usually, the fall of an action hero has nothing to do with the quality of his work...but in the case of Jean-Claude Van Damme, you can argue it both ways: while the man certainly still had a lot of fuel in his tank, ""Universal Soldier: The Return"" was so poor a vehicle that the juice didn't even find its way to the ignition. Though it was shot on the relatively meager budget of $19 million, it barely made back $13 million during its theatrical run, thus giving the big-name studios cause enough to oust the Muscles from Brussels from Hollywood...and in this case, I can't help but agree with them.

The story: seven years following the events of the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Universal-Soldier/dp/B00005O6Y3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Universal Soldier</a>, Luc Devereaux is now developing better and more reliable Unisols alongside the military and an artificial intelligence program called S.E.T.H. However, federal budget-cutting decrees the entire project be shut down; when S.E.T.H. realizes this, it puts a plan into motion that includes taking control of the existing Unisols, pitting them against their human engineers, and taking a human form of its own.

The film's very premise is unbelievable, even when taken on its own terms: after the first movie, it's hard to believe that Luc would buddy-up with his creators. He explains himself by saying ""I died... [They] brought me back. [They] saved my life""; this is fine and good, although he seems to have forgotten that the same folks who saved his life used him as an expendable killing machine and that they are now teetering on repeating the same mistakes that brought about the catastrophe of the first film. Also, the fact that S.E.T.H. (voiced and eventually played by Michael Jai White,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Undisputed-II-Last-Man-Standing/dp/B000K7UC2Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Undisputed II - Last Man Standing</a>) changes its goal from merely protecting its own existence to replacing the human race with Unisols is never explained. Kind of a drastic jump for a computer, don't you think?

Even the most braindead action flick can be salvaged if it lives up to its genre and delivers the big thrills. I'm sorry to say that this is not the case with ""The Return"": even though the film provides two surefire aces in Van Damme vs. Bill Goldberg (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Longest-Yard/dp/1415709351/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Longest Yard</a>) and Van Damme vs. White encounters, these aren't entirely realized. While it was a bit of a treat to see the latter two trading kicks, Goldberg barely fights Van Damme, spending most of his time attacking non-stars and displaying more personality than any UniSol before him. The amount of actual kung fu is limited: while the aforementioned Van Damme/White battle is an exception, you won't see Van Damme throw so much as a kick until at least the second half of the movie. The gunfights are uninteresting and repetitive beyond any need for description.

Considering that it's an action flick, the acting isn't about to save it, but let me cover it just in case you were wondering. Van Damme gives his usual kind of performance, though with less exaggerated expressions and limited screaming of ""Nooooo!!!"". Heidi Schanz (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Truman-Show/dp/6305252521/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Truman Show</a>) co-stars in an attempt to recreate the relationship between Luc and the female reporter from the first film, but her irritating offering is laughable even by the standard set by Ally Walker. Michael Jai White outshines just about everyone and proves himself a decent villain while Goldberg overacts every single line fed to him; I really wish the filmmakers had made his character mute. Xander Berkeley (""24"") and Daniel von Bargen (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-General-s-Daughter/dp/0792159659/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The General's Daughter</a>) don't do too much wrong in their supporting parts, Karis Bryant is fairly good as Luc's daughter (yes, the reanimated dead can reproduce), and fitness model Kiana Tom is atrocious as Luc's doomed buddy.

If the scenes in the strip joint had been cut out and the blood removed, this may have made a decent action flick for kids, since it embraces the ""we don't have to explain/justify nothing"" mentality that Van Damme's ""Street Fighter"" flaunted to a profit of $100 million. However, even though director Mic Rodgers had worked on films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Braveheart/dp/B00003CX95/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Braveheart</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lethal-Weapon-4/dp/0790738953/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lethal Weapon 4</a>&nbsp;as second unit director prior to this, he brings none of the style or flair of his previous work to his first and only go-it-alone project.

1250532,1,B000022TSJ,"There are bad movies, and then there are BAD movies. ""Universal Soldier: The Return"" is a cosmically bad movie, a movie so poor in every aspect of its execution that one would have to look to ""Manos: The Hands of Fate"" for comparison. The first ""Universal Soldier"" film was a moderately entertaining shoot 'em up flick starring action stars Jean-Claude Van Damme and ""Rocky"" refugee Dolph Lundgren that essentially accomplished what it set out to do: people perished in violent ways, stuff exploded, and Van Damme and Lundgren beat each other into bloody pulps at the end of the film. Even the presence of the charming Ally Walker as Van Damme's female sidekick greatly helped the film. The movie garnered enough attention and fans to merit the release of a special edition DVD some time back. It unfortunately also garnered enough attention and fans to merit this unredeemable piece of trash sequel. The second, and one hopes final, installment in a franchise that should never have become a franchise achieves such heights of utter banality and stupidity that I sat in open-mouthed awe watching it. I think I can safely say I am less of a person for having sat through this atrocity. Expect to spend a few days in a coma after the credits roll.

Van Damme returns as Luc, the reanimated soldier who triumphed over the forces of government sponsored evil in the first film. On this outing he now works for Dr. Dylan Cotner (Xander Berkeley), a scientist who reconstituted the universal soldier program with the help of his supercomputer S.E.T.H. Luc, with his female sidekick Maggie (Kiana Tom), helps design and run training missions for a new batch of super soldiers. The film opens with what the filmmakers hope is a pulse-pounding jaunt up a river, a jaunt filled with explosions, stunts, gunfire, and the briefest glimpse of Tom's incredibly fit form. As the mission grinds to a halt we learn several important things: Kiana Tom is incredibly hot but can't act her way out of a paper bag, Luc has a daughter named Hillary (Karis Paige Bryant) who you just know will get into trouble at some point, and the only soldiers we must pay attention to are Romeo (Bill Goldberg) and the one played by Michael Jai White. Frankly, turning off the film immediately after glimpsing Tom's amazing physique is probably a good thing. Everything that follows is dull, predictable, and so full of plot holes as to defy description. ""Universal Soldier: The Return"" feels like eighty minutes of dental surgery rather than an action film.

Sure enough, Cotner's computer goes on the fritz and unleashes the killing power of the universal soldiers. In the resulting conflagration S.E.T.H. implants its consciousness in Michael Jai White, Luc and his loved ones flee from the compound, and the military swoops in to contain the problem. An extraordinarily untalented actress named Heidi Schanz also pops in as nosy reporter called Erin who is interested in exposing the government's latest shenanigans. Predictably, Van Damme and Schanz team up to track down...er...well, track down something to defeat the supercomputer. I think they need some code to shut the system down, but in the meantime the film takes them all over the place so that a wisecracking Romeo can follow them around while absorbing all the abuse Luc can hand out. Even throwing in a few scenes set in an adult's only club can't make this turkey fly. It's dull, folks, and painfully so. By the time the film grinds to its inevitable showdown between Luc and S.E.T.H. back at the shattered compound--with an injured Hillary's life balancing precariously in the background to serve as motivation for an overwhelmed Luc (Geez, what a surprise there!)--I knew I just wasted far too much of my life with this car wreck. How bad can it be, you ask? Read on...

Plot holes in this film are innumerable, as uncountable as grains of sand on the beach or acne on a teenager's face. For example, Luc explains to Erin that he was once a universal soldier just like Romeo but Cotner ""cured"" him by restoring him to life; he no longer needs injections or ice or any of the other devices used by the soldiers. What the heck are we doing marveling at this amazing supercomputer when Cotner just performed a miracle of biblical implications? He brought someone back from the dead! How exactly did he accomplish this feat? We don't find out from Van Damme, who simply smirks his way through a few lines of dialogue that simply boggle the mind with their monumentally idiotic implications. I could go on, but let's discuss the performances instead--or the lack thereof. I should say I adore Kiana Tom; she's a drop dead gorgeous babe with a body that could stop the earth's rotation, but watching her stumble through dialogue is like having your appendix taken out through your mouth. Another problem is the lumbering Bill Goldberg, whose ""funny"" lines are anything but. And the more I think about Heidi Schanz, the less I think of her. You have to wonder about a film where Jean-Claude Van Damme is the best thespian in the cast.

You might think a movie this foolhardy shouldn't contain any bonus features on DVD. You would be wrong. Trailers for this film, ""The Return,"" ""Double Team,"" ""Desert Heat,"" ""Knock Off,"" ""Maximum Risk,"" and ""Nowhere to Run"" showcase the dubious career of Jean-Claude Van Damme.

Try to Stomach That) The Love Interest (an Exact Copy of the Love Interest in the Original, but Far more Aggravating) and Plenty of Action...

Don't ever see this movie its a waste of your time if you do youll be like ''dang he told me not to watch it'' don't beileve any of ''the movie was ok'' that movie........... bad i don't feel good when i think about it this movie was that bad. Theres only one way to buy this movie if you have an enemy who you don't want to hurt physically you could always tell them to watch the movie (thats if you really want to waste your 2 bucks on trash)i don't even feel like typing this and i don't feel good now it brings back the memories of how bad this film was i just wish a scientest would just erase this film out of my memory it was so bad i don't even want it to be in my brain for the rest of my life Literally,987465600,2,1766,3.8677685950413223
1250569,4,B000022TSJ,"The Plot:After 13 years. Luc(Jean Claude Van Damme) is having an normal life, he has a twelve year old daughter, a job for the military and he more human than ever but he lost his wife from the first film. Everything is about to fall about when Seth(Micheal Jai White), a supercomputer controlled warrior, has control another Unisols to save and defend themselves. But they are dangerous, will be anything sent they goals. But Luc how to stop them, because he was the original Unisol. Bill Goldberg steals the film, when he appears in a scene, he gives an outrageous entertaining comic performance as Romeo, he`s one of the Unisols in the film.
DVD`s has a good anomorphic widescreen(1.85:1) transer and Pan & Scan is also alivable. Excellent Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround with Strong .1 Lfe Bass just like Original Universal Soldier DVD. Including 3 Different Feaurette and Theatrical Tralier.",982454400,,891,4.946666666666666
1250570,2,B000022TSJ,"The first movie was a neat action flick with a simple plot. This is garbage. NO... the fight with Mario Van Peebles was good the fight between Van Damme and Bill Goldberg (playing re-animated corpes based cyborg Romeo) that fight was okay, but using terrible camera shots to make it look like Goldberg could throw a high sidekick, which no one really expects him to do. That's bad. or kicking a super-soldier into a dryer and turning it on rendering him powerless. That also is bad.
Or the fact that common hospitol security looks like navy seals built like Goldberg and are allowed to work without sleeves and show off their tattoos, or here's a good one... Van Damme's charicter (he is alive in this one) is held in the air by his neck from a reannimated soldier, in a dying effort he grabs hospitol shock pads, and while the soldier is still holding onto his neck he with 3,000 volts, SHOCKS THE SOLDIER!! Van Damme's charicter is fine. The soldier who is supposed to have unlimited pain tolerance is stunned and lets go only to stand still and wait for blows. It's subtle things like these that concern me about this movie.
It is not charming, or cool. All the fights except the final two are jokes. The robotic charicter of the blank soldiers is lost as these cyborgs make wise cracks, check out the ladies and hold grudges. Not the traumatic life into death type of grudges but the ""he beat me in the simulater game room and I want him to know that Im better"" type grudges. This also concerns me.
If I could grade only mario van peebles's performance (one fight) I'd say five stars. but with all of these additional concerns I cant lawfully give it more than two.",982368000,,1669,4.493421052631579
1250571,1,B000022TSJ,"I bought this garbage thinking it would be a decent film to watch , i was very wrong .the things the characters say and do are so lame , predictable, stupid, example:when the computer called SETH  goes haywire they try to cut the power by flipping the GIANT on/off switch,I laughed so hard i was crying.you would think the director would have some cool stunts up his sleeve since he worked on lethal weapon  4 recently, but, no such luck here.",970963200,2,443,4.45679012345679

1250573,5,B000022TSJ,I would like to clarify that this is NOT UNIVERSAL SOLDIER 2. Many reviews mention that this is US2 but they are wrong. There IS a US2 which does not  include Van Damme - but this is not it.,966384000,,190,3.871794871794872
1250574,4,B000022TSJ,"This was definitely a beyyer movie than the original Universal Soldier. Van Damme plays the role of the hero very effectively. Michael Jai White  plays the role of Seth in a human body to the point of being scary. Bill  Goldberg ia also a very effective villain in his role as Romeo. This small  army of super soldiers are turned bad by Seth the super computer. The main  killer soldier, played by Goldberg, wreaks havoc. Seth the super computer  takes on a human body and openly begins a manhunt for Van Damme because he  has the secret computer code that Seth has to have. After battles all over  the landscape Van Damme finally prevails. This is a good action movie with  entertaining actors. See this film for entertainment purposes.",966297600,2,737,4.658914728682171
1250575,2,B000022TSJ,"I enjoyed the original Universal Soldier, but like most sequels, this one has much to be desired.  I'm a big wrestling fan, so it was fun to watch Goldberg attempt to act out of the ring.  He's about as talented actor as  Van Damme himself (heh).  The movie has a lot of action, so it gets some  high points there, but the story line really isn't that good.  It's an  entertaining movie, but the original is far superior.",963360000,2,421,4.32051282051282

1250577,1,B000022TSJ,"This should have a minus rating, easily Jean Claude Van Dammes worst movie, (took a lot to take Street fighter off the number one spot! , Im amazed! )
Believe it or not I don't happen to hate Jean-Claude, on the  contrary I enjoyed his earlier work though not great, is very watchable.  Unfortunately Universal Soldier 2 falls short, lack luster performances,  and too many obnoxious scenes that make this movie too ridiculous to  watch!
I hope you will find yourselves something far more entertaining,  like cutting your toenails its better than this, believe me!  So try some  of Jean-Claudes earlier work like No retreat no surrender or Bloodsport  certainly better and more interesting that what is on offer!",958176000,2,712,4.92436974789916

1250579,1,B000022TSJ,"This is one of those few, select movies which I actually feel stupider for having wasted my time watching.  I can't imagine what the producers were thinking putting money into the project.  It was plotless, brainless, full  of bad action, bad jokes, stupid no-brainer one-liners from one of the  least menacing bad guys I've ever seen.  It's so pitiful that they have a  huge fight scene in which the enemies are the bouncers at a strip club.  Definitely do not waste your time or money on this movie.  Where the first  was a decent, neat, somewhat thoughtfully made movie, this is just a  blemish to be ignored or erased.",954374400,3,622,4.623853211009174

This film just does not deliver, it has 'A-team' violence  (loads of bullits flying and explosions but knowbody actualy getting hurt!)  , stupid characters (most of them seem to have come from WWF or something)  and I have to say Van Damme plays a block of wood, I also got the  impression that I was watching Sunset beach or something with every simple  aspect of the film being explained out for me, like the audience were  retards. Its a 'watchable' film if you aint doing anything interesting but  I wish I had not spent the money on buying it. Save your dosh and buy  something cool.",949104000,6,750,4.423357664233577
