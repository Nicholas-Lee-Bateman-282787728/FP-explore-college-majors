8461473,5,B0058E9NO2,"I have been learning belly dance for 2 years, and have been trying to buy a few videos along the way to enhance my learning.  Well frankly when you don't quite know what you like, or even enough about belly dancing to make informed purchases, you can end up with a lot of junk.  Well, as I have recently approached the intermediate level, and my teacher has us trying to choreograph, all my beginner tapes, and other junk just weren't cutting the mustard for me.  I needed something that I could actually, not just learn a few moves, but learn a style that I really liked and felt comfortable with.  Sandra is a beautiful dancer.  She has a modern twist that really shines out.  She is a good teacher and is comfortable in front of the camera.  Not cheesy or stiff like a lot of teachers are.  Plus she's beautiful. I bought three dvds all at once, Modern oriental, by ronya ranee, and captivating belly dance by amar gamal. I have to say, I did make 3 good choices, (finally) but my favorite is this one.",1376524800,4,1005,4.365591397849462
8461474,5,B0058E9NO2,"I liked it very much! Sandra explanations are clear and helpful so basic and intermediate levels can easily come along with it .
I sugest this teacher to make a veil dvd as i 'd liked very much the few tips she shows in this one not found in other dvds.
Very nice coreography for many levels.",1373155200,,292,4.140350877192983
8461475,4,B0058E9NO2,"I first read Martha Duran's review about the DVD in ""Gilded Serpent"" and thought it sounded interesting.  At first the DVD was a little slow (great beginner technique) then picked up tempo when Sandra got into the Egyptian technique.  There were some problems with the angle in which the video was shot although it was apparent they were trying their best to show the movements.  I liked the menu breakdown (chapters) for the technique so I can go directly to the section I want to work on.  I would recommend this video for dancers who are at an intermediate level and above.",1358553600,3,576,4.617647058823529
8461476,4,B0058E9NO2,"This choreography is wonderful! Sandra is a beautiful dancer with her own fluid style. I loved the choreography and the way she broke it down. This is a suitable choreography for begginers who are up for a challenge and intermediate dancers looking to learn new things. Advanced dancers...it's good if you are looking to incorporate her stylizations in with your own. Before i wax too poetic, I just wanted to say that I was looking for a ready made choreography because I had my hands full with other choreographies for this year's venue. I bought the song from amazon's MP3 store and went to go practice what I had learned from the video. TOTALLY DIFFERENT CUT OF MUSIC. She is using a personal edited version that is not available to the public. That said, be prepared to work. As I said, I wanted the lazy option. This video is a great choice for those of you who need a loose skeleton to work with or who like the ability to use your own interpretations with the beautiful choreography Sandra provides. Remember, the choreography will be split up from the way you learn it in the video due to the difference in music, but it is a wonderful start to creating something you will really enjoy. the clip for this video can be found on youtube. It is her peformance interpretation. She has turned it into a student's version for the choreography video. Very nice",1341360000,6,1362,4.586065573770492
8461477,4,B0058E9NO2,"Very beautiful.  I really like the choreography.  It will provide me with a challenge, especially the veil work.  Definitely for intermediate level.",1330300800,2,148,5.636363636363637
8461478,5,B0058E9NO2,"I usually do not buy videos that teach a choreography to a particular piece.  I prefer choreography strings that can be practiced or utilized in more than one piece.  However, the breakdown on this video, even though it is geared for a particular composition, is useful, with a few edits, for other compositions as well, making it if more value to me, and for teaching my students.",1328486400,2,381,4.6716417910447765
8461479,4,B0058E9NO2,"Sandra is a beautiful dancer who has a graceful, traditional style with a playful flair. The video is presented clearly and is easy to follow and user friendly.",1327104000,2,160,4.75
8461480,4,B0058E9NO2,"I received a few Amazon gift certificates for Christmas, so one of the things I picked up was Enchanting Bellydance Choreography with Sandra.  The choreography has a lot of variety, as the music Yasamina is a mergenci, beginning with a stately and mysterious veilwork introduction, into a more baladi sensibility, some chiftetelli, alternating between fast hips and turns and slow luxurious undulations and mayas.  The choreography both travels and stays in place at different times, and utilizes level changes for dynamism.  The full choreography is danced - in costume - by Sandra - so that you can see just how lovely it is.  This DVD also includes a bonus performance by Sandra to one of my favorite songs - Bitwannes Beek.

This video, produced by Hollywood  Music, exceeds their previous choreography videos in a few ways.  For one, they teach the combinations that make up the choreography to the music that will be used to dance with it.  So, unlike some of their other videos, where you practice combinations to unrelated music, this one has you practice with and without the actual music.  Best of all, they finally added the ""from the top"" runthrough after each new combination is added.  Without this feature, a dancer - like myself - forgets the first combinations by the time I get a chance to run through it from the top at the end.

Each combination is an opportunity for Sandra to impart knowledge and technique, and she breaks down any new technique first - before teaching the steps.  I do think that more attention needed to be paid to the footwork.  Often it was rushed through.  While it may seem easy to do a grapevine, a grapevine with multiple weight changes and direction changes is difficult to follow. Now, granted, having a small room within which to practice, I find myself running into the furniture so that impeded me a bit.  I would love it if she had had the time to teach footwork first, then isolations added, as I have seen Sandra do on some of  Michelle Joyce's DVDs.  So many times, a quick turn or weight change was explained quickly or demonstrated without any explanation - whereas a longer time would be spent on how to execute a chest circle or layer on top of a hip movement.  A dancer with a ballet background may have an easier time at it than I.  For me, it is the bellydance movements that require no explanation - but the fancy foot patterns do.

Another slight flaw a careful viewer will notice is that occasionally Sandra would change her own choreography in the run-throughs.  In DVD production, they could have used a single runthrough - cut at different points - and it would have solved this issue.  I don't  blame her for ""messing up"" - it's really hard to dance something the same way every time! To her credit, she never calls attention to it - she just keeps dancing.  I didn't let it screw me up - I just kept doing the choreography.  Other times, she just added flourishes and flair - to me, this was a bonus - I noticed them and incorporated them myself once I mastered the basic choreography.  I hate to be anything less than positive when I have a DVD that I am this satisfied with, but I do believe it is helpful to the producers in putting together their next DVD.  On that note, Hollywood Music could learn from World Dance New York's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bellydance-Egyptian-Style-Modern-Oriental/dp/B001JGK4BE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bellydance Egyptian Style - Modern Oriental</a>&nbsp;- it has a wonderful section where you can practice the combinations over & over.  Of course, I can do that on my own - and I plan to.  This choreography is just too beautiful not to try and master; I would like to get some of these movements into my  muscle memory.

Sandra has always been one of my favorite American dancers to watch.  She is graceful, cute, and fairly distinctive in her styling.  While she may not dance just like an Egyptian, she has an Egyptian-influenced style with an American flair that I appreciate.  In this DVD, I finally learned to do some of the beautiful movement combinations I have seen on her performances.",1325376000,10,4155,4.813822284908322
