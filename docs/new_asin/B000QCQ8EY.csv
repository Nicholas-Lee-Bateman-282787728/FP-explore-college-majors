8195655,1,B000QCQ8EY,"OK,to put it plainly It's not worth my money. Look if I am going to pay out of my hard earned money, you better give a respectable lesson. What did I learn? Nothing! The DVD starts out with a brief history but then when it comes to the form you learn nothing, he does not tell, what he is doing, and why he is doing it. No explaining nothing. In short I wonder if he even knows himself. MY suggestion go with Steve Desmasco Leopard form, if want to learn anything. Then find a school!",1329264000,4,484,4.105263157894737

8195657,4,B000QCQ8EY,"This is a beautiful production, and I think the best one so far in the Five Animal Kungfu series dedicated to Tak Wah Eng's art. The main form is clearly shown, and can be easily learned from watching the performer. Added to this is a comprehensive basic training set to develop strenght, and flexibility, and a few fist techniques are shown in addition. Ideally, this series should delve into just that, and show short techniques based on the animal styles that could be used for two-person drills. What is shown is quality, and the only criticism I have is that I want more of it. This DVD uses the same beautiful score as the other DVD's within this series, and features high quality editing (an advance compared to earlier productions in this series). I'm looking forward to see a Crane and Snake production!",1206316800,9,812,4.685314685314685
