7997763,5,B0000AOX0P,My sons may need to go to rehap for Vol. I. These are all they watch. The stories are very cute...I can even watch them and enjoy.  We have Vol. I and Vol. II and love them both.,1192320000,2,178,3.6842105263157894
7997764,5,B0000AOX0P,My both kids - 9 years and 2 1/2 years love those cartoons. I recommend them for any age.,1186704000,,89,3.736842105263158
7997765,3,B0000AOX0P,"Good package for your money. The movies are not that exciting and haven't kept the interest of my children or their friends. Supposed ""bonus features"" are non existent. Not the fault of the supplier, at all.",1179878400,,207,4.777777777777778
7997766,5,B0000AOX0P,"Our 2 1/2 year old twin boys can't get enough of these movies.  We've had them for over two months now, and every evening they still ask if they can watch a dinosour movie.  A couple of the movies have a scene with a ""sharp tooth"" that is a little scarey for young ones (we make sure to be in the room during these scenes), but otherwise they are great for all ages.",1140739200,4,366,4.0
7997767,4,B0000AOX0P,"While it's not necessarily great cinema for adults, it entertains my preschooler.  My preschooler especially loves film #2 with the baby T-Rex.  I think the films also teach some good values lessons.  My only complaint is that film #1 (the original Land Before Time film) in this set was not digitally re-mastered so if you have a high definition TV, even with progressive scan on the DVD player, film #1 can be a bit grainy.  Films 2, 3 and 4 all look great on an HDTV and the sound for all 4 plays well on a home theater system.",1130198400,9,530,4.3232323232323235
