The story holds together well and Richard Harrison is one of the better actors of the peplum series. Also this film is notable as it features 2 monsters created by Carlo Rambaldi, who would go on to work on Alien 1979 and E.T. 1982. The print is decent for films of this era as well.",1336348800,,724,8.177215189873417
