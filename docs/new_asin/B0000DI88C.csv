1924937,5,B0000DI88C,"I used to do this yoga back on VHS and could never find this on DVD.  It was out of print and extremely expensive.  Luckily I searched again recently and saw it was now readily available and at reasonable prices.

The Yogi's voice matched with the music is sort of 'trance-like' and that does not bother me. If you have yoga basics under your belt already, his instruction is very straight forward and the movements flow.  It's just about 45 minutes and I never feel like it's that long, it's over before I know it.  I know the flow very well and I don't watch the DVD as I'm doing it, but scenery is beautiful.  Great DVD.",1498521600,,623,4.282051282051282

1924942,5,B0000DI88C,"A beautiful yoga tape. Actually legendary among home yoga DVDs due to  its excellent production values. The poses include the standard hatha yoga ones  as well as some others not always found on yoga DVDs. The music, stunning camerawork,  the variety of landscapes, and the diversity of the yogis practicing with Ali McGraw make this a tape for the ages. I've been using it in VHS for years and decided to buy it again in DVD so that I'll have it once the VHS player gives out.",1486166400,,477,4.459770114942529

1924949,5,B0000DI88C,This video was exactly what I needed. From start to finish it gives you a well rounded practice. I felt that every muscle had been stimulated and brought to relaxation by the end of the video. The music was relaxing and the poses were easy to follow with the instructors guidance. I would recommend to anyone interested in starting a beneficial yoga practice.,1482796800,,359,4.714285714285714

1924951,1,B0000DI88C,"This is not for beginners,of  which, I am.  My one friend who is a yoga instructor told me get it, it's ""friggin"" amazing.  It is if you are advanced. I cannot do most of the poses.  Glad I did not spend a lot of money on it.  Maybe one day I will be able to do the poses.",1481673600,,272,3.6206896551724137

I have actually met and spoken to her twice and she is as sweet and kind as can be, she actually wrote down her yoga master for me she goes to here in NYC. She looks great for her age, yoga and healthy living is one of the reasons why.",1481500800,,322,3.791044776119403
1924953,5,B0000DI88C,"Full disclosure - I'm not a frequent yoga practitioner, just a dabbler. This is one of the best videos I've come across for several reasons.  The imagery is beautiful, the Dead Can Dance soundtrack is awesome, and Erich Schiffman is so good with instruction, after the first couple of times through it you can literally do this video with your eyes closed.

I bought this because I used to have the VHS tape, and the DVD experience is even better because there is somewhat of a lengthy introduction - now I just jump right in at the beginning.  Some of the poses are more difficult for a beginner like me, I just do what I can and try to get better each time.",1478736000,,659,4.341463414634147
1924954,5,B0000DI88C,"I had this CD years ago and when it came time to bring yoga back into my life...this was the only CD I considered. It does take some work to do a small section of the routine but like with any yoga practice, you will work up to the poses. Great music. Nice meditation section at the end.

1924960,3,B0000DI88C,Highly recommend by a friend but I found it too advanced in some ways and too slow in others.  I would say this is more than just exercise and requires some experience with yoga as there is not much instruction.  The pace is very slow and the voice very hushed.  If your looking for a meditative but tough yoga DVD this just might fit the bill.  I've done it once and will try it again.,1471478400,,386,4.1066666666666665

1924969,5,B0000DI88C,"This is my all time favorite yoga video and I have tried many. Very soothing and calming for the mind. This is not power yoga!  The visuals, music, and cinematography are a perfect blend of artistic, sophisticated and reflective. I am so happy to find this on Amazon as I use to own this 20 years ago and lost my copy during a move. It was selling on ebay just a few years ago for $100-$200 dollars.

1924974,5,B0000DI88C,"I'm just beginning my yoga practice and wanted something to follow from home so I don't feel so silly in classes. This DVD is great for beginners like myself. The woman in the video has a great way of explaining each pose. The positions she teaches us in the video are easy to follow. It did take me several times to fully get comfortable and find a flow going from pose to pose but I felt more comfortable having this happen at home than if I were in a public class. I now find I can stay more on que to her movements instead of falling behind since I've become familiar through use. It's not strenuous, instead it's very relaxing. It has given me more confidence in going to my classes since I actually have caught on to names of the poses and how to transition to them.",1459382400,,772,4.222972972972973

1924976,5,B0000DI88C,"An oldie but a goody -- my all time favorite yoga tape set against white desert sands, beautifully choreographed and taught by Erich Schiffman, lovely background music, diverse students to embrace everyone, and an achievable practice for beginners (still challenging  enough for seasoned students as well). I believe this originally came out well over two decades ago in VHS format, but for me, it is timeless. It is a ""feel good"" practice and I love it.

1924979,3,B0000DI88C,"I found this video to be a little strange. The setting and clothes seem dated as well. I did still like the yoga itself, but the way it is filmed was actually very distracting for me. Maybe if I memorize the sequence and ignore the tv screen it would be a great DVD",1454371200,,265,4.018867924528302
1924980,5,B0000DI88C,One of my favorites and I have a large growing variety of YOGA DVD's. Slow meditative flow and the location on white sand is calming. This one has stood the test of time for me and its tough to beat is you want a nice 50+ min yoga workout- not too easy and not too tough.,1453507200,,271,3.857142857142857

1924983,3,B0000DI88C,"It's visually beautiful, but the editing and music are not conducive to a calm practice session. It's fine to watch as a video; however the music has a beat to it that's agitating, not calm. And there doesn't appear to be a 'voice only' option.  Erich's beginner and backend dvds are much better practice guides. (It is beautiful, though)",1445126400,,338,4.728813559322034

1925014,5,B0000DI88C,"I love this workout and I always finish it feeling so flexible. The more days in a row you do it, the more flexible you become. I have had this on a VHS tape since about 1999 and decided to upgrade to a did.",1424217600,,207,3.727272727272727

1925016,5,B0000DI88C,"I originally bought this video on VHS and purchased it again on DVD. After lending the DVD to a friend and not getting it back, I purchased it again. I LOVE THIS VIDEO!!! It offers a continuous workout that doesn't break the flow with too much information. This video features the actress Ali McGraw who participates with other yoga students while they follow instructor Eric Schiffman through a continuous series of poses. This visual treat also features students of various shapes and sizes, color and age, who are all extremely flexible. For instance, there is a woman with white hair, a black man who looks amazing against the white sandy background. I recognized Jennifer Grant, the daughter of Gary Grant and Dyan Cannon. She looks younger than she was in her appearances on Beverly Hills 90210, so that shows that this video has been around for awhile.

To tell you the truth, I've never been able to do every single pose, and my quads are very tight, but I could listen to Eric Schiffman speak all day. He
has a soothing voice, and his choice of words adds to the tranquil nature of yoga. I haven't done yoga for awhile, and there are easier, more basic yoga DVDs available, but I recommend this DVD if you have a knowledge of yoga, and you can judge for yourself if a pose is too difficult. Yoga is generally a very safe exercise if you listen to your body and only stretch as far as your body can go (and maybe just a bit further). You can hurt yourself if you consider yoga a competitive activity.

I've purchased other yoga videos that are filmed next to a waterfall or beach, but I always return to this one that was filmed in stunning white sand. The atmosphere is different from any other DVD that I've seen. I always return to this one. I am so happy that this DVD was re-released.",1422316800,,1797,4.492354740061162
1925017,5,B0000DI88C,"I learned the rudiments of yoga from this video in the VHS dark ages. So glad it's available/affordable on DVD now. It's just as good as I remember. The Dead Can Dance songs are energizing and appropriate to the poses, and the setting is unparalleled for serene beauty. MacGraw has a nice but nonessential intro, and the routine features her and four other students following Erich Shiffmann's routine. Even though the whole group does the routine together, the camera focuses on one student at a time so that it's easy to see & copy technique. Shiffmann gives helpful, well-timed instructions via voiceover. Sometimes at random moments in the day my brain replays his dreamy-toned encouragement during tree pose:  ""If you start to sway, don't give up. Treessway""",1421452800,,763,5.0078740157480315

My one complaint is that this re-issue is supposed to include a new interview with Ali Macgraw and this is nowhere to be found on the DVD! It appears this is merely an exact copy of the original disc which is fine but should be advertised as such.",1421107200,,532,4.2254901960784315

1925022,4,B0000DI88C,"This is probably the most visually pleasing yoga DVD I've ever seen.  The scenery is gorgeous, and the wardrobe, film angles and background music all add up to a beautifully styled whole.  The practice itself is a solid 45 minute class that covers all the usual components:  sun salutations, standing poses, hip openers, forward bends, etc.  The pace is a little slow and the flow isn't as smooth as some similar offerings (eg. Rodney Yee).  The poses are mostly basic and the level of intensity relatively gentle.  Erich Schiffman gives clear instruction re alignment and clear cuing.  I find his voice a bit abrasive and nasally, but that is a minor distraction.  I think my expectations were raised because when this DVD was ""out of print"" so many reviewers were gushing about it being their favourite and so amazing and people were paying very inflated prices for it.  It's just been re-released and may not live up to all that hype, but it's still a very solid and pleasing practice that I'm happy to have added to my collection.  Plus Ali McGraw is just plain cool.",1417996800,,1071,4.709677419354839
1925023,5,B0000DI88C,"Finally was able to get a reasonably priced DVD.  Long story on this one.  I had the VHS since 1997, when I first started doing yoga, teacher recommended it.  I used the hell out of it.  I eventually replaced it, was a DVD probably around early 2011, since I started using my laptop as my player.  I know at the time I didn't pay much more than $20 for it.  Both the VHS and the DVD, along with everything else I owned, burned in the Bastrop, TX forest fire on Labor Day 2011.  When I went to replace the DVD, I was shocked that they were extremely hard to find and cost over $100.  Since we replaced our video recorders, I bought a VHS, played it on my kitchen TV VCR, but I couldn't see it from the yoga room, I could just hear it.  I kept checking on the DVD but prices were still crazy.  Finally, on a whim, I checked again, when I was on Amazon buying another movie, and there it was for about $20.  Snapped it up, it plays on my DVD player that I use in my yoga room, and it's like an old friend.",1417824000,,1002,3.96

1925026,4,B0000DI88C,"I originally bought the videotape of this program, prior to a weekend class by Erich Schiff-mann. I had been looking for the DVD version for over a year, but didn't want to spend the $90+ most sellers were asking. I finally found a copy that while still expensive, was considerably less. Ali McGraw is a student who introduces the class which is taught by Schiffman. This is a comprehensive class, which includes ujjayi breathing and a variety of  poses, including tree pose, sun salutations, a vinyasa that includes triangle pose, half moon, side angle, Warrior I and pyramid pose. He includes several back bending poses, including locust, bridge and the more challenging bow pose. He cools you down with a supine twist, seated forward bend and half bridge before leading you into savasana for deep relaxation. Although this is an older work by Schiffmann and does not include the free flow yoga he is currently teaching, it is still a good DVD if you are willing to pay what sellers are currently asking.",1416960000,,1006,4.815028901734104

The sequence is really nice and flows in a sensible order, progressively moving into more difficult poses.  It is very fluid and allows you to practice various different poses.  It starts with sun salutations and moves into warrior poses.  Then, you do more difficult postures like back bends and standing tree pose, finishing with a resting meditation.

I watched the entire tape, tried a few poses before diving in so I wouldn't be lost. Maybe other folks didn't do that and that contributed to their bad review.  Over time, I felt my balance and strength improve. I was able to hold poses, stretch further and really calm my mind. It taught me to quiet my mind in order to focus on the poses and the cool down at the end works well.  The music is energizing yet soothing somehow and I really enjoy it. Not everyone may. However, when my mind is focused, the music seems to fade away and I don't even notice it.  This is a pretty old video at this point but it is still my favorite.

The positions are difficult to see because of the camera angles, and there's very little verbal instruction to guide you. Also, some positions are challenging.

Whoever put this together put a lot of thought and effort into in to make it a well balanced session, visually pleasing and serene. I don't do the beginning breathing exercises but I do keep my breath throughout the session which makes the practice all that much better.

It is considered intermediate yoga, which I didn't know when I originally bought it so many years ago.  But it is a great video to work on your yoga practice even if you're a beginner.  There is one section with more difficult poses, but still helps with your practice.  If you get hooked on this, you will have learned LOTS of basics, then go to a class and have an instructor teach you everything you've been doing wrong.  Ali MacGraw is prominent in the video, but the instructor, Erich Schiffman, has a perfect voice and tone to help you get through the practice feeling relaxed and refreshed afterwards.",1299801600,,775,4.347222222222222

1925099,5,B0000DI88C,"I absolutely love this DVD.  In fact I first bought this many years ago on VHS and still find that I keep returning to this program.  The setting is beautiful and the instruction is a very mindful yoga practice by Erich Schiffmann.  This DVD is in fact more about yoga as a practice than as a workout.  So while it will improve your health, it is just as much about your mind/spirit.  If this is what you're looking for, then you'll enjoy the DVD, if not, then you might be disappointed.  Personally, I originally bought it as a workout video and then discovered that I loved the mental benefits of yoga as much as the physical.  Also this has the best savasana of any yoga DVD that I've done, or live class that I've taken for that matter.

I see that there are a lot of comments about the music, both positive and negative.

I began using this video when I was only 12 years old and still didn't have an issue with it.  In all honestly, I enjoyed this video more than the beginners yoga classes I attended in the following years.

1925123,5,B0000DI88C,"This video is Great! The instructor is very specific about how to do the poses.  His emphasis on breathing techniques is a great reminder about this fundamental aspect of yoga that is often overlooked in some videos and in classes at the big mainstream gyms, etc.  If you're a complete beginner, though, this might not be the best video for you.  In fact, I highly recommend for any beginner to take some in-person classes with a qualified instructor before doing anything on your own with a video.  An in-person instructor can really look at how you're doing the poses and make adjustments as you're doing them, so you learn it correctly from the beginning. But once you've gotten some good instruction in the basics, this video is wonderful!  The landscapes are beautiful and relaxing, and the music is amazing and well-matched to the pace of each section.  I also own some videos put out by Giaim, including some with Rodney Yee.  Even though Rodney Yee gets a lot of hype, has been on Oprah, does all his videos on the beaches of Hawaii, and is certainly not bad to look, I think that Eric Schiffman is a far better instructor. FYI - Ali McGraw doesn't do any of the instructing in this video - she's just one among several ""participants"" in the routine.  She says in the intro that she just really loves yoga & really respects this particular instructor.  HINT:  I actually rented this from a video store before buying it for myself - it's pretty much the only way to ""preview"" a DVD/video since you can't return after opening.",1239667200,,1532,4.619926199261992

The video offers that and more. Routines at the back of the book differ slightly to the one presented in the video. However, one gets the exact feel that Erich is trying to achieve. I agree that he has a great voice which fits perfectly over the lovely music. The sand dune backdrop is magnificient. The elegance of the Yoga performers is inspiring. It's almost like Tai Chi. Learning from a video requires patience. It's best to master 10 minutes of the video and build from there if you are a true beginner. There is no quick fix in Yoga. A video is a useful tool, along with daily practice and plenty of reading. Once you learn the routine you can lengthen the workout to suit your own needs. I recommend you buy the book as well. The book is super. Self-learning requires patience with oneself. These videos and books show people that have been doing Yoga for years. The flexiblility is a tribute to their patience and perseverence. Vanda Scarvelli is a prime example of it's never to late to get really flexible.

You Might also like to try out some standing Qi Gong Routines. If you check my reviews I've suggested a few.",1221782400,,1274,4.421276595744681
1925143,5,B0000DI88C,"I've had this video since it came out over 10 years ago.  It remains a classic.  Way back then I was a semi-experienced beginner and it was challenging but very accessible.  I still enjoy it today, now that I've had  yoga teacher training and all those years of class and practice under my belt.

This is a shortish routine (40+ min. I think) and begins with some back limbering and then precisely executed sun salutations and a lovely vinyasa sequence of standing poses.  Then you work into backbends and leg stretches savasana.  I know: same ole stuff -- but Schiffmann still makes it look mint fresh.

Some of the camera work is a little dated-arty but I love it.  The music is partly by Dead Can Dance -- really wonderful.  The setting (White Sands) is exquisite.

As a complete beginner, I didn't find it too complicated and it continues to inspire me as my skills have improved.  It took me many, many times to stop feeling like an ugly duckling and start to feel like a graceful swan while I was doing the poses.

I've finally worn it out and I'm purchasing a new copy (I gave my spare copy to a friend years ago, and she still uses hers regularly). The reason this is the best yoga video ever is because: 1. the beautiful scenery and visuals (I can relax and zone out while I work out); 2. the perfect yoga music which never gets old (and the music is not just peaceful, it also becomes powerful and motivating during the challenging poses and flows) 3. the sequence and poses always remain challenging; and if you're not up to a full routine you can just do the first 20 minutes (warm up, sun salutations and one balance pose) and be finished with a great work in no time. This dvd is NOT great for someone new to yoga, as it does not focus on teaching yoga. The focus here is on DOING yoga once you've already had professional instruction on all the basic poses.",1218672000,,905,4.267441860465116

As most said, it is a stunningly beautiful DVD but I found the music very distracting.  There are some tribal music, middle eastern type music which I don't find particularly suitable for Yoga. Also, the music is too loud and I can't hear the instructions very well.  If you are very experienced and don't need any instructions you should be able to turn down the music but if you like to hear the instructions, you will find very difficult to listen to.

Overall, I would not recommend unless you are a very experienced with Yoga and don't need any instructions (so you can turn down the sound).",1217980800,,670,4.558333333333334

1925165,4,B0000DI88C,"The torrent of highly favorable reviews speaks is silent testimony to Ali Macgraw's Yoga video. This reviewer agrees with most of the following comments but includes some cautionary remarks: My VHS version had very high production values indeed. The music was clear and peaceful, as was the desert scenery. The verbal commentary is helpful and calming.  The cautionary news is that I found the workout too advanced. The stretches were held for too long and the poses too challenging. I have had back problems and was afraid to use the full range of motions offered here. I retreated to my admittedly very basic Rodney Yee tape. That stated, those previous positive review comments should stand. Ali's tape should be a very safe purchase for most folks- it just did not work out for me. And by the way, those looking for the preppy, collegiate Ali of ""Love Story"" and ""Goodbye Columbus"" won't find her. Time has moved on --
but the years have made Miss Macgraw an even more attractive lady than she was in the 70s. More power to her! Ali does take the lead on camera here, but shares part of the spotlight with four other individuals. This tape is apparently only available via 3rd party purchase.

This requires a little bit of strength, but you can always modify it. Set in  1994 with yoga trainer Erich Schiffmann who has a wonderfully calming, confident, clear voice.
Starting very slowly with cat/cow on all 4s after the intro up to the 7 min mark.
Next is sun salutations, mostly mountain/standing fwd bend at first, then adding on downward dog, plank & cobra for 10 min.
Standing poses: bound triangle, kinda half moon 1 leg hip stretch, side angle & warrior 2.
Floor - cobra, bridge & bow, knee to chest, reclined straight leg stretches, reclined spinal twists, seated double leg fwd bend & ends with baby bridge. Ends in meditation.
The actual work is 47 min, minus 10 min for the very slow cat/cow stretching, so it's really 37 min w/o mediation which can fit in most schedules.

I LOVED the music, it helped me center/calm, the scenic scenes were a little too long for me between sections & I didn't want to rest, so I just FFWed... I'd love to see more from Erich.

The desert scenery was indeed, beautiful, as well as the music.  However, the music, for me, was not conducive to a relaxing, focused feeling.  I prefer music to be more meditative and slow in a yoga class.  I did not feel relaxed at the end of this class.  It was somewhat disjointed.

The way the DVD was shot, was extremely distracting.  Constant flashes of desert scenes, then back to the students in the class, then several different flashes of some clouds, then back to the students, all in a matter of 10 seconds.  Almost as if someone were taking snapshots of nature, and flashing them all onto the screen.  Sometimes when you need to look up to see what they are doing, there's a flash of a cactus. I'm sure if you do the DVD enough times to know what happens next, this won't be an issue, and you won't even need to look up. But it left me feeling agitated at the end.

The class itself was pretty good.  I enjoyed the narration.  Simple and clear instructions.  There were times when it was rushed, all of a sudden everyone in the class is standing up, when 1 second ago, they were on the ground.  There are some shaky transitions.  I found myself having hard time keeping up with what they were doing.  Sometimes I had to change the position of my yoga mat, and race to catch up.

I think if they would have tried not to be so fancy in the shooting of the dvd, it would have been better.  The class all by itself, without all the flashes of scenery would have been fine.",1183507200,,1646,4.358552631578948

You have to keep in mind that you need to work up to the level of the people on the DVD and only go into the twists and back bends until you feel a light stretch and slowing work up to it.  Otherwise you my get injured.  But you will not get bored as this DVD is something to keep growing with.

Beginners - There is no explanation of how to do the poses, but you should not practice until you have read something or taken a class any way.  While it isn't simple, if you watch it once you will do well within the first 2 practices.

I have other Yoga DVD's I like, but this one ends up in my player over and over again STILL.  Excellent music, with a workout that is good for a beginner and challenging enough for a more advanced practitioner.

I've bought many other tapes I like and use (Rodney Yee's, for example), but this is the one I like best.  It is challenging and yet not overwhelming (good for beginners and for people who've been practicing for a while) and it makes possible a vivid sense of renewal and peace. Unlike many yoga programs, it focuses on breathing.  Focus on breath would seem to be a no-brainer with yoga videos, but unfortunately it isn't; many yoga videos seem to treat yoga as if it were simple stretching.  This video can seem long from the description (at least when compared to half-hour yoga videos) but I've never had it seem long in practice.  The practice time actually flies by and is very enjoyable.  I'm hopeful that Eric Schiffman (the yoga master for this Ali McGraw & friends video) will create another yoga video one of these days ... ;)",1178236800,,916,4.5212121212121215

I even broke the first VHS paying it so often and had to buy another.  So when I found the DVD I was truly grateful and purchased one for my mother and myself.  My mother was newer to yoga than I and noted how challenging the DVD was, but after just a couple of weeks of careful practice she called me and told me how much she loved it.

This may be an old recording, but it is by far my favorite practice.

I highly reccommend this DVD.",1176681600,,608,4.025

The beautiful  scenery and Erik's soothing and calming voice inspire me to reach further into poses and perfect my form. The soundtrack is also a big plus (Dead Can Dance) and encourages me to open myself to the sky. I practice this DVD every evening (sometimes twice a day if time allows) and at least do the sun salutations after my morning run.

After a couple workouts the routine is memorized and natural, I don't have to ""watch"", just listen.

I would not necessarily recommend the DVD to someone who has never taken yoga before, as it does not offer any modification instruction, but if you already know the basics, you'll enjoy it. It's also a nice relaxing workout for those who are at the intermediate level. Advanced yogis might be bored, unless they are looking for something slow, simple, and relaxing. I bought it to use as an instructional for my husband, who, with my help, is just learning yoga.

Over all, a very nice DVD. The workout itself isn't particularly physically challenging, but it does offer a routine that will help you connect.",1133222400,,786,4.772058823529412

1925242,5,B0000DI88C,"I discovered this video back in the early 90's.  I can't even remember anymore how long it has been that this video has been in my life, over 10 years.  I have used up 3 copies of this video and am on my 3rd DVD.  It is the most amazing yoga video on the market right now.  I have bought copies for all of my dearest friends.  Ali MacGraw used her connections in film production to pull together a beautiful work of art.  It was shot in White Sands, New Mexico with a soundtrack by Dead Can Dance.  It is timeless in every aspect.  She is not so arrogant to assume that she could lead you through this video, but brought on Erich Schiffmann, a master of Iyengar yoga, to calmly lead you through the poses.  Though I started with this video, I would not suggest it for everyone.  It assumes that you know the poses.  It is a wonderful tool to use inconjunction with class instruction.  Without some class instruction you might continually do the poses wrong and never know.  It is a solid practice that I never seem to become bored with.  My video library holds atleast 15 to 20 videos that are rarely used.  The only other one that holds a candle to it is Rainbow Mars 4 video series.  The beautiful thing about Ali's video is that it is very rounded with a solid 45 minute workout.  If you do it regularly for atleast one month you will see a change in not only your body (what we are all really trying to work on) but your mental state.  After just a few practices with this video I do believe you are able to attain a serene state more often.  Not only that, but this video really unlocks your body if you are feeling tight and stressed.  Most of the poses are covered in any basic Iyengar or Hatha class so you should be able to master them quickly.  If you need a book to assist with the video I suggest ""Yoga, The Spirit and Practice of Moving Into Stillness"" by Erich Schiffman.  You can not go wrong by having this DVD in your library.  I turned my husband onto it 7 years ago and he does it religiously.  It will greatly enhance your life.  And, if nothing else, it's really nice to just watch.  Something I suggest you do a couple of times before practicing to it.",1123286400,,2174,4.216019417475728
1925243,5,B0000DI88C,"I'm a beginner, but I have owned this video for about 7 years. I'm buying on DVD now that I actually practice yoga more regularly. When I first tried to move with the video, I found it VERY challenging, but at the time I was trying other yoga avenues, books and magazines, and found those difficult, too. In other words, at the time I found YOGA difficult, TOO difficult to bother learning.

Since then I have developed fibromyalgia and back problems, and have found incredible relief from yoga. I love this video for the music (awesome), the visual imagery (beyond beutiful), the interesting and varied physical appearances of all the perticipants, and the incredibly soothing, assuring, pleasant voice of Erich Schiffman as he guides your practice. I continue to be enthralled by his voice, and seek more of his instruction. Ali MacGraw's introduction is a good one, and it is obvious that her practice of yoga has done right by her all these years.

I think this is a great addition to any yogi library, regardless of your experience level.",1122940800,,1043,4.788888888888889

I don't think this could substitute for an advanced student's practice, but it provides a light alternative now and then.  I don't find it boring after doing it so many times: the production is top-notch and the instructor has a nice (male) voice.",1122336000,,432,4.5256410256410255

While some people don't feel that it's good for beginners, I disagree. I was a complete beginner when I bought this, and though frustrating at first (isn't everything hard the first time?), I was patient and willing to work at it. The rewards have been great thus far, as I now practice Ashtanga regularly.

Over the years, I bought numerous videos and DVDs, looking for the right yoga style for me. Ironically, I kept coming back to this video. Erich Schiffman's instruction is inspiring and encouraging and the music (lots of Dead Can Dance) is perfect. I suppose it was instinct that brought me to it in the first place. If you really want to make yoga a part of your life, listen to your heart and go with the yoga that calls to you, no matter how difficult or challenging. You should always have something to strive for.

I believe that this DVD is for people who want to practice yoga on a spiritual level. If you're just looking for a workout, it may not appeal to you, so be forewarned.",1117843200,,1125,4.37799043062201

While I will admit that some of the poses are not the easiest, the truth of the matter is that they shouldn't be! I truly feel that this video, in taken in the context that it is just a video, is as close as you can come to a studio session. I have also purchased various different yoga videos and find myself constantly coming back to this one. I found the music calming, the photography soothing (although it does jump a little), and, and, and... there are just too many good things to say!

Like I said, I liked it so much, I own both the VHS and the DVD and I'm considering making this a DVD that I would give to those I really care about, as a way of helping them along their journey.

I find that this video is great to relieve back pain. And if I just need to relax, I do this before bed and it feels like someone gave me a back massage afterwards. It's awesome. That's all I can say. It is timeless and is fine for beginners or more advanced people. If you are a beginner, then just do what you can. That means only go into the poses as far as you can and if you feel pain or discomfort, pull back. Concentrate on your breathing and focus on just improving a little bit at a time. Of course, more advanced people will have absolutely no difficulty really stretching into the poses. This isn't the most difficult yoga video as far as the poses go, but it's definately RELAXING!!

The scenery, the music, and especially the sequences of poses, leave me feeling pretty blissed out.

1925258,5,B0000DI88C,"This is the very first yoga DVD that I have purchased and am extremely pleased.  After having my first child, I wanted to try something that was physically challenging, that would assist me with becoming more flexible and help to ""clear"" away all craziness I encounter in a day.

This routine has really helped me to regain core strength after having a child - my back feels much better and my abs are more defined and strong. Although I get physical workouts in the gym several times a week, regular body workouts do not make me feel the way that I feel when I am finished with this one.

This workout allows me to concentrate on strengthening and stetching my body - and leaves me with a clear mind afterwards.

I have found that having a little one saps a lot of my energy, and I need time to decompress after my day.  This product really helps me to clear the days activities (and everything else on my mind) and prepare myself for bed.  I am also sleeping much better since I started.

I would definately recommend this product to other beginners who are already physically active (and new moms!) - it takes some time to learn the poses enough to truly engage in them.  I would also recommend using this product in the evening - it is a fantastic way to ""wind down"" after a long day.

1925259,5,B0000DI88C,"Ali McGraw: Yoga Mind and Body is, as the name suggests, a tremendously good workout for mind and body. Although Ali McGraw is the celebrity spokesperson, the yoga is actually lead by master yoga teacher Eric Schiffman. He arranged the asanas in a logical sequence, progressing from a good, relaxing warmup to more vigorous sequences. Although the DVD is pretty long, it's easy to choose just one segment when you have time constraints. Production is beautiful, filmed in White Sands National Monument with a soundtrack mostly by Dead Can Dance.  It might look unnervingly artsy to people used to Yoga Journal's bluescreen-and-synthesizer productions, but after using this DVD a few times, it's hard to return to Rodney Yee.

I love the music and the scenery. Yes, doing yoga in the desert is a little hokey but it's very visually appealing. I like the length of this practice. I think it's about 45 minutes and I don't always have 60+ minutes to do yoga, so I tend to use this more often than some of my other dvd's.

Erich does not go into a great amount of detail on each pose, so I would say this is not for a person totally new to yoga.

The routine is a good, solid, respectable yoga practice.  As a fit intermediate yogi, the poses and pace were easily accessible, but not overly challenging.  This is also a good opportunity to see Eric Schiffmann at work.

I would not recommend this DVD to anyone who's been doing yoga for years, because they would not find it challenging enough. If you are very new to yoga, I wouldn't recommend it...however if you consider yours self and intermediate beginner, or a beginner who familiar with yoga modifications then go ahead and buy it.

Visually it is a beautiful, but in all honesty after you've done the routine two times you stop looking at the film and follow Erich Schiffmann's instructional prompts to move you into the next pose.  The music is calming and relaxing, the standing poses in the middle of the film are challenging.

The video is set in a staged desert environment - no mats - so you never know which direction to set your mat at the beginning of the workout. Also, the transitions are terrible - the video stops filming the people and shows the sand and plants - but the descriptions of what is going on is less than useful so by the time they start showing the people again, you are hurrying to get into the position the individuals are in. I much prefer learning the names of poses and then walking through them - with constant video of the individuals so you can see what is going on. This is terrible.

If you're mid-range to advanced in your yoga practice, this is not a particularly challenging routine.  But the well-balanced/flowing sequence of postures, fabulous cinematography, and spiritual (yet not too much so) emphasis more than make up for that.

The breathing exercise at the begining of the tape really puts you in the perfect mindset for yoga practice, the insructor's voice is soothing, and the imagery is breathtaking.

1925296,5,B0000DI88C,"Yoga Mind and Body is a classic yoga video which stands the test of time.  It is designed for those already familiar with yoga (ie, there is little instruction on how to perform each pose), and it will gently challenge you while also providing deep relaxation.  The practice begins with instruction on ujjayi breathing, a basic form of yogic breathing to accompany asana (posture) practice.  The warm up then continues with a cat/dog tilt series to open the spine.  This beginning section lasts about 7 minutes total, but once you understand the breathing, you can skip over that segment.
Sun salutations comprise the next 10 minutes of the practice.  You will begin with simple breathing and forward bends before adding lunges to the sequence.  After practicing tree pose for balance, you will continue with another 10 minutes of standing poses performed in steady flow; postures in this segment include warrior, triangle, and side angle. The next 14 minutes of the workout involves floor work.  You will begin on your stomach for cobra and bow, then switch to your back for leg extensions, lying twists, and bridge.  The only seated posture is a single seated forward bend, and then you will return to your back for a relaxing 1/2 bridge pose.  The practice ends with approximatley 4 minutes in shavasana for a total of 45 minutes.
Although others have complained about the background music, it didn't bother me--when I even noticed it, it seemed to fit nicely with the postures, as it varied from being upbeat to more soothing.  One minor criticism I have of this video is that although the scenery is beautiful, the cameras sometimes focused too much on scenic views when I wanted to see close-ups of the poses being performed; similarly, there was a bit too much shifting between cameras for my liking.  However, this issue did not detract from the fact that this is an excellent yoga practice which I will enjoy for a long time to come.",1079049600,,1942,4.819277108433735
1925303,3,B0000DI88C,"Sorry folks, but I just don't see what's so great about this video.
 Maybe it's because I am a sound - sensitive professional musician, but I just coudn't get into this video with all the background commotion. Conga drums going wild like Carnival at Rio, electionic oms rising in volume and drowning out the speaker during the final relaxation, synthesized rock beats, chanting, native american flutes, electric guitars, ominous electronic wind noises....really I couldn't wait for the video to end. I could have used less art and more yoga.
 Too bad, because the workout is decent. Standard stuff...sun salutation, standing poses, cobra, bow, spinal twists, etc. Lots of edits and cuts. At one point I looked at the screen to check a pose, and the camera was pointed at the sky.
 I will stick with my Yoga Zone vids, Sarah Ivanhoes Dummy Series, Yoga for Surfers Power Yoga, and Rodney Yee.

The poses are challenging enough that you will be able to use this dvd for your whole yoga practice from your first days to when you are limber. I suggest that you get some yoga props to help you in the begining, as the poses are a challenge.
Of all the yoga videos, and dvds that I have tried I always come back to this one. Not only is it beautifully made, but it is the one that makes me feel the most like I have really done something. This tape also keeps the focus on the breathing, and the poses, which is the heart of yoga practice, which is missing in so many other yoga videos.

I had some previous experience with yoga and some of the poses were a little bit difficult for a beginner, but after doing the tapes a few time I can alredy feel improvement.

1925310,4,B0000DI88C,"Erich Schiffman, one of the yoga community's finest instructors, guides us through this 45-minutes workout set in the White Sands desert.  Ali gives a brief introduction at the beginning of the tape and joins the rest of the students in demonstrating the poses.  As you begin this workout you will focus on ujayii breathing to prepare for the more rigorous poses.  You will also learn a modified verson of the Sun Salutations (surya namaskar), different versions of the bridge pose and appropriate counterposes.  The workout ends in Shavasana (corpse pose), argued by many to be the most important pose in any yoga practice.
Many aspects of this workout make it a keeper for the intermediate yogi.  First, many reviewers have discussed the beautiful scenery; this is wonderful for any yoga program although you may not look at the TV often.  At least you can enjoy it when you do look up!  Another great part of this workout is Erich's soothing instruction, which upon hearing would make anyone want to relax.  Note for advanced yogis/yoginis: he does not call the poses in their sanskrit name, and infrequently by their English name.  He just does a great job at describing the movement.  Lastly, for those who do not mind new-age music, the soundtrack provides a wonderful background sound perfectly balanced with Erich's cueing.
The ideal person for this workout is someone who has done the beginner level yoga workouts and is looking for something more from their yoga practice.  You will not break much of a sweat but will generate some cleansing heat in your body.  The slowness and steadiness of the movement really makes you think about your form and focus on breathing.  For those who are looking for a tougher ashtanga workout, this may not be what you're looking for (I might suggest Bryan Kest or Baron Baptiste instead).  I would highly recommend this workout as a more gentle practice in between ashtanga sessions or as a meditative stretch after a strength-training workout.  If you do decide to pick this one up and have minimal exposure to yoga, I would suggest that you read an introductory book to understand the proper form.  Namaste!",1072137600,,2154,4.892561983471074
1925311,5,B0000DI88C,"I bought this on vhs when I was 17 and had never done any yoga. At the time there weren't very many videos (and certainly not dvd's) out on the market for yoga. Well I have to say that it went way past my expectations.
I did watch the tape the first time before trying to do any of the poses like it suggests and I was definately intimidated. But I tried it and I wasn't any good. Certainly over the past 9 years I have gotten better. But there are still many poses  that I cant do as gracefully as I could so I am constantly learning.
I have scoliosis and there are many tapes I have tried that hurt my back. This is not one of them. A week doing Taebo and Im back into physical therapy. I can do this 7 days a week and theres no problem.
This is a challenging, relaxing, invigorating and wonderful yoga practice. I highly reccomend this to anyone wanting a little more than what most other dvd's and video's give you.
The video is beautiful. The music is relaxing and calming. The instruction is wonderful. There isn't anything about this that I can say is bad. To have used this tape for 9 years and not be annoyed by the music or instructor has to tell you something.",1068163200,,1171,4.158590308370044

Since then I have seen many more videos and this is the one I decided I must own. The workout is the perfect length, the scenery is beautiful. When I first started, one of the poses seemed difficult but just enough to be a challenge and keep things interesting. Now I love that pose. The instruction is perfect, not too much explanation which can get old when you do the same video again and again. If you have never done yoga before, I suggest getting something basic like ""Yoga for Dummies"" from the library to learn the poses, then BUY this one. It is really wonderful.

You can not be in a distracted mood when you do this.  For me, my breathing is not as relaxed if I am thinking about what I need to get done after the video.  The music is very motivating to me.  The scene is beautiful, but often my eyes are closed or I am not facing the TV, so the scenery is wasted on me.  The music, which is a sort of new age flowing type, helps me to get into the flow of doing the warm up sun salutations.  Some poses I found a little difficult to maintain at first, (the tree), difficulty holding the balance, but I got better at it as I practiced more.  I could really feel the toning effects in my legs, (bridge pose), and arms, (downward dog).  So, this is not a hurry up and get your cardio workout video, but you will get a good, different workout.

After I mastered those I tried many others, including a couple of popular power ones.  Yes, those are a tad beyond me but I'm trying.  What I've found since graduating from the Dummies, is that I want a QUIET, SOOTHING, flowing workout sometimes. On most of the tapes I have the instructors jabber and yak non-stop, going beyond simple instruction.  That grows old and irritating.  And there are times I am just not into sweating and huffing with a power tape.  WELL!  This Yoga Mind and Body is exactly what I was looking for.  The scenery is great, and even tho I am not really into new age music, I love the music on this video.  And Erich's voice is quiet, slow, kind of monotone in a wonderfully soothing way.  The workout itself is great, and you can make it whatever you are into for that particular practice.  I see myself falling back on this tape for years to come, no matter how advanced I get.

The tape is especially good for students who have some foundation in the basics of hatha yoga who want to begin to expand their practice or supplement studio work with at-home yoga.  While initially I found some of the pose flows to move too fast for me, I found that as soon as my body understood the poses, I was able to align my breath and movement and really work into the postures in the time allotted.  Unlike some of the ashtanga/power yoga classes and tapes, Eric Schiffman has you breathe mindfully in each pose which I find promotes strength more effectively. The instruction on achieving alignment and working into the poses is strong. In addition, the music and scenery on the tape and the diverse group of students working with Eric are all beautiful.  A few minor disadvantages are:
 - there is very limited instruction on how to adapt the poses if you are not yet ready for them, such as using blocks, etc.
 - there are a few instances of misalignment among the students that show up in the tape - Ali, for instance, has her knee at an acute angle rather than the perpendicular in some of the lunging poses, which can be damaging to the knee.",1041984000,,1201,4.465753424657534

This video has very good breath prompting and the dead can dance (music) is extremely calming.

It took a while for me to be able to do it right, but I always wanted to put this video in becuase even though I didn't know how to do all the moves I felt so calmed energized and like I had really done something afterwards.

When I can't make it to my yoga class, I prefer this video to the others I own.  At close to an hour it may seem long at first.  However, I have found that after practicing with this program anything shorter is not long enough for me to fully ""let go"" of my day and immerse myself in my practice.

While watching these performers, I become relaxed enough to ""space out,"" and in this day and age, anything that helps people deal with life's uncertainties is worthwhile.

1925333,5,B0000DI88C,"After boughts with anxiety attacks, my wife talked me into trying out yoga using this tape.  I was very skeptical at first, but after the very first workout, I already saw the advantages of yoga.  As a beginner, I found this tape to be somewhat strenuous, but not so much that I was put off by the workout.  I worked and worked and continue to work, and the tape gives me great satisfaction.
I would highly recommend this to anyone thinking of trying yoga or expanding their existing horizons.  Although Ali McGraw may have been 52 when she made this tape, I think most participants will be hard pressed to match her agility and prowless.  But as she indicates at the beginning of the tape, ""Yoga is not a competitive sport"".
I've tried a few other tapes, but most of them (AM/PM yoga especially) are full of advertisements and attempts to push products on you.  AM/PM starts with 15 minutes of advertisements that you either sit through or fast forward through.  That was not something I was particularly fond of when I sat down to begin the workout.  Seems a little contrary to the Yoga spririt to me.
This is a tape devoted to a nice relaxing workout that flows from the very beginning to the very end, with no added ""junk mail"".  A+ for Ali McGraw and Eric Schiffler for a great tape. The complaints from other reviewers about the production may be true, but after the second or third time through this workout, you really don't pay attention to the video itself.  You're able to do the workout and concentrate on your breathing and technique. The volume of the music does seem to overlap the voice of the instructor in parts, but again, after you have been through this tape a few times, you are really only using his voice for cues instead of instruction.  You will prefer the music more at that point.",1022025600,,1808,4.515337423312883
1925334,5,B0000DI88C,"Ali MacGraw an inspiration for the over 45 set --- she was 52 when she made this tape !! The entire tape is a blessing --- the music is beautifully eastern, but upbeat ... it keeps you moving during the posture flow sections. The setting is the wonderful White Sands National Park, they use long, slow moving shots of the dessert between sections of the tape. It is fun just to watch.  The group in the class is very mixed -- young girl/old woman/black guy/Ali is very flexible, but she is not stick thin -- it makes you feel anyone could be able to do yoga.
What I like best about this tape is that it can be used for one long yoga workout (53 mins) or it is very easilly divided into three major parts. First there is an intro into breathing techniques and an easy to follow sun salutation set. Next is a great standing flow (triangles/warriors...) That part is very slightly strenous, but it can be smoothly done after a bit of practice, plus it is good to get the heart rate up a little. The tape ends with a group of floor postures. The three parts are divided by a brief balance posture or breathing. I like inserting part of this tape into my daily practice to keep  from getting bored.
 This tape is OK for beginners who can follow insturction or better yet for students who have had some classes and are looking for something to inspire them on.

I need not impress any one and need not worry that I can't do the movements as Ali does them. Yoga is a great experience and my body feels so much more whole after I do this video. My only regret is not enough time to do it daily. Still, once or twice weekly makes a major difference in my stress level and attitude.

1925340,5,B0000DI88C,"When I first got this tape I was at first put off by the slickness of the production and the music (which I felt was too intrusive). While I still think the music is a bit too loud and sometimes compete's with Erich Shiffman's instruction I do really like this tape overall. Even the music has become more enjoyable to me as I've gotten more used to the routine and have to concentrate less on the verbal instruction for cues.

 I have been doing yoga daily for almost 9 years and found this routine to be quite different from other tapes I have (and I have over 70 and counting). It's a nice change of pace to help bring variety into one's daily practice. It's excellent for days when you don't want something as intense as an Ashtanga routine but still want to be challenged. It covers all the basic movements/countermovements that will leave you feeling quite thoroughly stretched and strengthened.

 Ali Macgraw is definitely a serious practitioner of yoga and has wonderful grace and form. Her sincere comittment to yoga comes across clearly on this tape and I found her inspiring. Eric Schiffman did a great job designing this routine and leads you through it smoothly.

 I would agree with the other reviewers who recommended that one start with a beginning yoga tape before trying this one. Also, in spite of the fact that there are several ""students"" in the video there are no modifications shown which is a major drawback for someone new to yoga.

 For example, I often modify several parts of the sequence depending on how I feel on any given day. I like to work the Sun Salutes incrementally, starting with the first lunge with my hands on the floor, the next salute with my hands on my knees during the lunge, and then I move into the lunge (3rd salute)with my arms overhead. Most people may not need to move into the salutes like this but first thing in the morning I generally need to open up slowly in spite of the warm ups that are done before that part of the program. I also do the same with the plank poses, first on my knees as I lower down and then working eventually into a full chaturanga (lower pushup position)in the last repetitions of th Sun Salutes.

I would recommend that beginners start with ""Yoga for beginners"" by Patricia Walden which is an excellent and thorough introduction, or Yoga Zone's Basics tapes (the five tape set is fabulous) to get started.

 Also there is a new series of Vinyasa Flow style tapes by Rainbeau Mars. The collection is called ""Sacred Yoga"" and the first two tapes are ""For Beginners"" and ""Pure Tranquility"" which are excellent gentle practices, the last two tapes ""Pure Power"" and ""Pure Sweat"" are much more challenging and all are beautifully done and highly recommended.

 The ""Total Yoga Flow Series"" by Tracey Rich and Ganja White are also excellent. If you're newer to yoga try ""Earth"" and then moe on to ""Water"" (which is about the same level of difficulty as the Macgraw tape reviewed here). The last tape ""Fire"" is very challenging and advanced.

  Also I would recommend buying Eric Schiffman's book ""Yoga, the practice of moving into stillness"" which is the best book I've seen on the subject. He gets into the deep levels of yoga that make the practice much more meditative. You will also learn how to make the practice more of your own in terms of working with your own specific physique.

 Another amazing book is Donna Farhi's ""Yoga Mind Body and Spirit"". That and the Schiffman book are the best I've seen!",1012003200,,3484,4.610032362459547

It is a aeshetically beautiful tape, and I really enjoyed the music because it isn't generic.  Some poses are difficult, but I felt that all were fine for a beginner, and challenging enough for intermediate.  I did find that there was not enough instruction and modification for those who aren't as flexible.  I bought another beginner's tape and thought, ""I can't believe I have been doing the Ali Macgraw tape, with so little instruction, for this long!""  I found that if I had done the other tape first I would have had an easier time, but alas . . . I have read other reviews that state the poses aren't difficult, and they aren't per se, it is the lack of instruction that makes this a tape for people that have had prior yoga experience.  For example, for some of the floor poses it would have helped to use a strap, I have very short hamstrings and I felt really discouraged. But the tape does not mention this. I would say this tape is perfect, if not for the omission of INTERMEDIATE in large letters on the box.  And Ali Magraw is great, it is not one of those tapes with a gratuitous celebrity.  Yoga is life-changing for her and this tape can be for you!",1010620800,,1289,4.293388429752066

You will become aware of the improvement and changes that take place very quickly with your body. Erich Schiffmann narates over the video and his voice is soothing as he throughly explains what you should be doing while encouraging you to hold wonderful poses and to become focused and aware of what your body is doing and how it feels.

As in the relaxation at the end when Mr Schiffman says ""Love is what's left when you let go of everything you don't need"".  Upon reading his book, I discovered that Mr Schiffman was a student of J. Krishnamurti and taught yoga for several years at a Krishnamurti school.  If you are familiar with the ideas of Krishnamurti as well as a practicioner of yoga, this video offers a uniquely valuable insight into the practice of yoga.

I remember finding a couple positions above a beginner's level, but it didn't take long before I could do them after some consistent Yoga sessions.
The moves are at just the right pace & speed, allowing sufficient time for breathing, meditation, stretching & full relaxation- unlike several Yoga tapes I've tried out since finding this one.
I tend to either have a nap or at night, sleep after, so consider it a warning not to do this tape before going to work. It will completely relax you into a peaceful state. You will just want to sleep, or be.",994118400,,679,4.573770491803279

THIS is by far the best yoga tape out there - and I wished it was higher up in the ratings, above the RODNEY YEE videos.  In comparison, this is YOGA - peace of mind, working the body.  Rodney Yee's videos usually turn into jumpy moves, and desperate attempts on keeping up.
ALI Macgraws video may be slower paced, but you hold the poses longer, which leads to great flexibility in the end.  Not for the out of shape beginner.

Frankly, some of the poses are a bit difficult at first. However the breathing exercises in the beginning of the tape are just fabulous.  This means that even if you can't do all the poses you can use this for relaxation and improved breathing, and that's what I often use this tape for.
Once you take a class and get some instruction, the most difficult poses can be done by nearly anyone. These are classic poses and this is a good overall workout on a tape that you won't be shoving in the drawer to gather dust.",987379200,,629,4.469565217391304

The workout itself, is not for a total beginner, but I had no trouble catching on and aspiring to do the poses to the best of my ability. Erich's voice is so calming and Ali and the other students look like they are throughly enjoying themselves!! Of course they are!! I throughly enjoy myself too when I do this tape!!

I do admit that an intro with a smidge of safety and beginner info would push it up to 5 stars for me. It is the video I have been seeking since beginning Yogo.

It is visually appealing - white sands, nice video effects, etc.  However, very little instruction about the poses was given.  Watching the tape several times, you can sort of figure out what to do, but unless you know these poses prior to the tape, it could be dangerous for your body.  Precautions on the poses weren't given.

I try to do it two or three times a week.  The tape  really shows you how to get into position and the breathing is very loud so  you don't forget to keep doing it.  The instructor does a decent job of  making sure he is talking throughout all the positions.  I would recommend  getting a yoga book of beginning positions just to make sure you are doing  them all correctly.  Keep in mind that yoga as with any exercise should be  approached slowly.

If you are of my  generation, you will remember her with that tight black cap as she pulled  into Ryan's hospital bed in 'Love Story.' Ryan had terminal cancer in the  picture. There wasn't a dry eye in the house.
In her video, you will not  be crying, you will be laughing because you will feel and look great with a  not too strenuous excercize regime. I highly recommend this video and am  hyping it on my new website USDocSearch.com ( a free service to patients,  because finding a doctor shouldn't be painful.
It is the best solution  for the 'bad back'or a back ache. Too many of these videos go through such  an exausting regime that by the time you finished, you are too tired to  turn the set off. I like the New Age white. The color in itself is calming  and adds to the complete feeling of well being you get after watching the  video.

About a year and a halp ago I recived an internal infusion pain pump.  It worked great,  for the first time I was able to do things again (with in limit).  Their  was one problem, I was so out of shape that even my lower back was killing  me. When you stay in bed your muscles start to lose their tone and become  like jello.  Belive me when I say I did not want to go back on pain meds.  or muscle relaxers after getting the pump.  I'd had enough! My doctor told  me about Yoga, he said it would be the best thing that I could do to get  back in shape.  Of cours, he was wright.  I can now do things that I could  not have done even when I was younger. No one knows what it is like to lose  everything you have every done frome pain unless they have been their.

It even helps  on those days that I have an anxiety attack, or feel depressed.  Things are  starting to look up now and yoga has had a part in my return to the real  world.  I do this tape at least 4 times a week, because if I don't I'll  start feeling like a wreck again. I have enjoyed this like no other  exercise tape that I have ever done.

To think clearly you must know yourself.  To know yourself you have to go to a place you can learn who you are. Yoga invites you to do this.  I don't get into the deeper spiritual side, but prefer to indulge in the stretching and relaxing techniques.

At night, light a candle and practise this session in the evening before you go to bed. In the morning you can push yourself a little harder and warm up your muscles for maximum stretching potential.

I can't do all the poses yet, and I certainly  can't do them to the depth the actors on the video do. But with yoga you  have to be patient and do what you can. Progress comes if you stick with  it.
BTW, Eric Schiffmann is currently working on another book and video.  It's hard for him to do because as you can see from the schedule posted on  his website, he travels frequently all over the world and seems to be  booked a full year in advance!
I recommend this video to those with some  light experience and patience. I alternate this one with the Rodney Yee AM  yoga and also take group lessons twice a week. I think this video is a good  addition to your arsenal for mixing up your yoga practice to prevent  boredom and to get a feeling like you're making progress.
