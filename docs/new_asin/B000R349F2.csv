8205669,5,B000R349F2,"Available in paperback and DVD, Harold ""Noonie"" Ward's Gangster with A Heart of Gold is a true and riveting account of Noonie's childhood, how he became a part of the street gangs, and the good fortune that turned his life around. Both ends of the spectrum are covered as Noonie helps the audience see the Altged Gardens, his `hood, ravaged by senseless violence, from his perspective.

Thematically, Noonie G has become an icon of resiliency, rising from dire beginnings to success in life. Respected by all, he describes his very first exposure to violence--as a child spectator--when a woman opened fire on her husband during an argument outside his elementary school.

Noonie sets a good example for children from the projects by demonstrating that it is never too late for redemption, ""your past doesn't determine your future."" Despite being a former top-ranked figure of Gangster Disciples, noted to be the largest criminal organization in the United States, Noonie found a way to break away from a destructive lifestyle and make a positive mark on society when he trusted in God to look out for him.

Gangster with a Heart of Gold is not only about how Noonie came through for his `hood and community, but how today's parents and authority figures need to wake up and become good role models for their own kids. Violence is not the answer, Noonie says, but ""for some of these youngsters going to jail or taking a life makes them feel like ""somebody."" More than anything else, Noonie pleads with people to give kids the requisite guidance, attention, and love they so desperately need. Otherwise, kids will turn into ""monsters"" and projects like Altgeld Gardens will go on from generation to generation, playing the ""same game"" of death, ""just different players"" who have no respect for themselves or their community.

From ""The Ten Commandments of the Streets,"" and becoming an agent for positive change--through his entrepreneurial endeavors and role in public affairs--to providing a wealth of REAL advice for today's youth, Gangster with a Heart of Gold is all about redemption and Noonie's unyielding desire to end the cycle of destruction and death that has become a predatory fixture in our society.",1303948800,,2212,5.002717391304348
