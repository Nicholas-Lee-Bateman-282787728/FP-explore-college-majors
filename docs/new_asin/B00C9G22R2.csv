5707545,4,B00C9G22R2,"I have been waiting in great anticipation for a couple of years to finally see this film and it didn't disappoint. It's definetely a Wong Kar Wai classic.  The only complaints I would make about this dvd is that it is the shorter 120 minute version, instead of the 130 minute full version.  Also, the subtitles are not the best in interpretation.  Having seen the longer version, this is a major thing, as it leaves out much of the clarity of the plot and that's a major thing because Kar Wai is notoriously very vague in the details of his film storylines.  Minus these points, I love it as it definetly takes on the themes of the martial arts within the characters and is very beautiful in cinematography.",1373328000,5,707,4.5
5707546,3,B00C9G22R2,"""The Grandmaster"" is Kar Wai Wong's first film in about six years since ""My Blueberry Nights."" His latest film chronicles the life of Yip Man, a legendary martial arts master who had become internationally famous by a 2008 Donnie Yen film. (It took about eight years for director Kar Wai Wong to complete the film since he announced his intention of making this film in 2004.)

""The Grandmaster"" begins with beautifully shot martial arts sequence of Wing Chun master Ip Man (Tony Leung Chiu-Wai) and his foes (choreographed by Yuen Woo-ping). You will soon realize, however, that the director does not really intend to make an action film.

During the fight scene that is set in dark rainy night, every single shot is meticulously framed and perfected to the point where, with so many slow motions and close-ups, the film's highly stylized ""action"" sequences are less dynamic and more graceful than those in Donnie Yen films.

Kar Wai Wong, it is clear, wants to put emphasis on Ip Man and other martial arts fighters as a person, including Gong Yutian (Wang Qingxiang), a retired martial arts master from northern China, and his daughter and martial arts fighter Gong Er (Zhang Ziyi). She is romantically attracted to Ip Man, who is a married man.

I know storytelling is not Kar Wai Wong's forte, but the film's narrative is too uneven and disjointed, making some of the interesting characters such as Ip Man's wife (terribly wasted Song Hye-kyo) virtually invisible. Not only that; at certain points the film itself has almost become a story about Gong Er. Well, I didn't mind that, but I thought this film is about Ip Man.

After all, this is a film made by Kar Wai Wong, director renowned for his visual style. With action scenes that look more like dance scenes, his latest film will satisfy his avid fans, but for those who are interested in action or Ip Man himself as a person, the film is ""The Grandmaster"" is a little disappointing.

5707549,5,B00C9G22R2,"THIS IS A REVIEW ON THE ORIGINAL CHINESE UNCUT (130 min.) VERSION!

It was finally time for the great iconoclastic Hong Kong director to turn to martial arts action in his intense and atmospheric telling of the great grandmaster teacher, Ip man, and he doesn't disappoint.

Wong Kar-wai brings the poetic beauty of his cinematic genius displayed in such works as ""In the Mood for Love"" to martial arts action executed with a precise rhythmic heightening reminiscent of Sam Peckinpah at his best, bringing out the sensations of living through the Japanese invasion of China during WWII. The cast is magnificent, especially Tony Leung as the Ip man, and Ziyi Zhang as Gong Er perfectly embodies a kungfu mistress trying to avenge her father. A masterpiece by Wong to put on a level with his finest work.

My only gripe about this Blu-ray release (which looks stunning in its clarity of picture and color, highlighting Wong's penchant for rain and darkness) is that the special features (unlike the feature itself) do not have any English subtitling -- so unless you read Chinese you won't be able to know what Wong or his crew and cast are talking about.  The feature does, however, have full subtitling.

A worthy addition to your Blu-ray library.

PS: One other reviewer criticized the editing of this film which, to me, smacks of putting down the film for not being more conventional.  Sometimes it is difficult to put aside expectations of what one wants a film to be in favor of what the actual film on the screen is.  ""The Grandmaster"" is, in fact, brilliantly edited.  Wong is, if nothing else, a perfectionist in taking years to mold his assembled footage into his own personal rhythmic poem, idiosyncratically emphasizing downbeats and rests as precise as a great composer.  What you see here is Wong Kar-wai's personal vision, take it or leave it.  But let's not denigrate it for not being a conventional action picture or someone else's Ip man film.  I wouldn't change a frame, or a single edit.  It strikes me as a perfect diamond for this exceptional, if eccentric, cinema artist.",1369353600,51,2091,4.823529411764706
5707550,4,B00C9G22R2,"I suppose being Bruce Lee's former teacher and someone who had made the martial art Wing Chun known around the world, the curiosity around his life became so strong that directors Wilson Yip and Herman Yau had their turn in bringing his life to the big screen. Wilson Yip's ""Ip Man"" was a film with a lot of fiction around it, which focused entirely on action sequences with Donnie Yen in the title role. Herman Yau's ""The Legend is Born: Ip Man"" was an unspectacular martial arts drama but a little more subtle and certainly not as bombastic as Wilson Yip's films.

Well, finally the highly anticipated biopic about Ip Man directed by Wong Kar-Wai has finally arrived. A little different from his usual films, as the film goes for refreshing ideas and themes rather than decadent emotions, it is a film that has a lot of hype as with any other film directed by him. People should be aware that one needs to temper their expectations with Wong Kar-Wai's ""The Grandmaster"". It is a film about a true-to-life figure and is a period piece that brings the concept of how martial arts can apply to living. Wong Kar-Wai takes on a premise that he has not done before that his fans would have reason to celebrate. This review is based on the 130 minute film released in Asia, I have heard that another cut of the film was debuted internationally.

 1930s China. Ip Man (Tony Leung) is a rich, young martial arts master who does not want to compete and yet he finds himself thrust into the limelight as his peers push him into a sparring match with Chinese Martial Arts chairman Gong Yutian (Wang Qingxiang). The match was more technical than a display of skills as Ip Man asserts his inner skill to get the best of Yutian. As a result, Yutian's daughter, Gong Er (Zhang Ziyi)  who is also a master in her own right of the 64 hands, issues a challenge to Master Ip as to restore her family's reputation. The two spar in a flow of rhythmic movements that almost looked like poetry. This is only the first few minutes of the film, as Wong Kar-Wai co-wrote the screenplay to include certain periods in Ip Man's life. If life has four seasons, then the first 20 years is spring, but then his life takes a turn to winter during the Sino-Japanese war.

Wong Kar-Wai intentionally made the film to feel rather convoluted and episodic. Perhaps in an effort to express his themes and metaphors, and to cover as much of Ip Man's life as best he could. Wong does not primarily takes his focus on Master Ip's life, but rather he brings into the fold the way each period was in his life and how certain people have influenced his life both directly and indirectly. The writing in the film was definitely trying to bring forth the concept as to how the teachings of martial arts could be applied to the living of one's life, as Tony Leung clearly elaborates in the first few minutes in the film; ""It is all about the horizontal and the vertical"". I take it that one is left standing while the other is laying down in martial arts. Such is something that could certainly be seen in life. One stands while the other lays down, perhaps one needs to learn how to lay down in order to stand, and also at a mirror image, one needs to learn to lay down in order to stand.

Wong Kar-Wai has some rather heavy themes going around here. There is much to take in the film, the dialogue is often filled with philosophical meanings and metaphors, but we all know that it is usually what a Wong Kar-Wai movie is all about. The characters in the film move about its themes, and while its structure felt a little loose, the resonance for each of them is pretty crystal clear. Ma San (Zhang Jin) and Gong Er make choices that often feel that they were based on emotions such as pride, anger, honor and love. The theme of vengeance that comes with the two, was something that keeps them from fully reaching the peak of kung fu. This brings into its narrative as to there are three levels that signify the highest achievement in martial arts: ""being, knowing and doing."" This lesson comes from Master Gong to Ma San, and strongly expressed through Gong Er's life that she had taken a vow that kept her from becoming a wife and having children in order to avenge her father. Ma San and Gong Er chooses from a very straight-forward emotional level that chooses their destiny for them.

Now, Master Ip also has potential for all these emotions, but he is more passive. His approach to life is a more peaceful one, as his love for Gong Er remained inside and that such a thing could not be in the past. Master Ip is married to Wing Sing (Song Hye-Kyo in a limited screen time) while Gong Er was engaged. Ip Man choose to rise above such desires and ambition, that he approaches life from a less than aggrandizing path. There is a subtle subversive message around its narrative, and yet it sees things from a humanist point of view. Life has its regrets, and yet, here, it is not something that drives its narrative but merely a consequence. Wong places the film's priorities on the world around the individual rather than what the individual does to the world.

As with Wong Kar-wai's usual style, the film is very lush and a little pretentious. This is not a negative comment, but rather something that I have just grown to be fond of when it came to Wong's films. Wong uses slow-motion with overblown art direction and redolent details to bring the power, the beauty and the flair of the martial arts. All angles were utilized to display the moves and even some close ups to bring forth its effects and intensity. It is a true visual feast but I could've done without the `fighting in the rain' since it had been done so much in other films. The cinematography and the atmosphere of the film fit just should be expected of Wong Kar-Wai; this is after all a style all his own and what made him the renowned filmmaker that he is today.

The screenplay in ""The Grandmaster"" is pretty strong, and yet it does not come with some issues. I mean, I know this is meant as a biopic, but one is left to wonder if this is Ip Man as seen through his eyes, or is it Master Ip as seen through Wong's viewpoint? I know the film's intentions was a less than fictional one, but really, it feels a little unfocused at times. The script takes some detours that I thought unnecessary, I was a little dumbfounded how a nationalist agent turned ass-kicking barber called ""the Razor"" could've made a good device to further Ip Man's transitions and yet he was only in three scenes. Chang Chen's the Razor was shamelessly used and felt like a `filler' since the film could've gotten along fine without him. I also thought that the narrative played a little too heavy on Zhang Ziyi's character rather than its supposed main protagonist.

""The Grandmaster"" could've easily been called ""The Grandmasters"" as in the plural form. It feels little unfocused to be a biopic on Master Ip, and truth be told, its messages could've easily been delivered in a film by any other director about a martial artist's journey experiencing the same things in the world. Tony Leung does a great job as the lead, as he felt a little smug and yet, tempered. Stoic, yet filled with emotions. His performance was certainly better than Donnie Yen's. It was also great to see Zhang Ziyi's to once again do her thing; she was elegant, beautiful and graceful as always. Despite some flaws, ""The Grandmaster"" is a good film that deals with devotion, humility and humanist ideas, and rather than using love as a driving force, it is a mere upshot.  It is about just what it means to stand upright, that how one chooses the right path is often the one left standing. This message is truly complete and grown-up that this film gets a High Recommendation from me.

The cast is magnificent, especially Tony Leung as the Ip man and Ziyi Zhang as Gong Er who perfectly embodies a kungfu mistress trying to avenge her father.

But the star of the film is Wong Kar-wai who parades before us a non-stop gallery of brilliant images in which virtually every shot is a great painting, and a story wonderfully trumped by a nuanced style that, while all his own, ranks with the finest filmmakers of all time.

Anyone who loves how filmmaking can provide insight into the human experience needs to see this work of art by a Hong Kong filmmaker who seems to be showing the rest of the world how great films should be made.",1368057600,5,1224,4.700934579439252

The picture quality was bad and looked bootlegg. The subtitles were too fast, not accurate and didn't fit on the screen so you couldn't read everything that was being said, which made the movie very hard to follow. Due to the fact that it was hard to follow, the story didn't make a lot of sense and it seemed like there were missing parts. There was very little action and most of the fight scenes were in slow motion to hide the poor choreography. The music was good and original language spoken by the actors was well done but overall i wouldn't recommend this dvd.

5707554,5,B00C9G22R2,"Splitting quan into soft and hard, the dialectics reflect each other, but in the end they destroy each other in a fatalistic and karmic cycle. Circular in structure mirroring the movements of bagua and its 64 palms, the movie breaks and temporal cohesion seem to skip and jitter. Perhaps also mirroring the broken and non-linear movement of the mind, the movie's internal structure and story-line can easily confuse a literal and linear-minded audience, as easily as a circular-palm disorients a clumsy opponent.

Supposedly in the end, the 2 different styles of Bagua and Xing-yi are fused and unified into the modern representation of Wing chun through Ip Man, but the true Grandmaster, Gong Er dies before she can pass her art to another heir.

Hidden and mysterious masters are linked through a tangential path weaving the cobwebs of the mind with the dark alleys of Hong Kong, as the movie moves serpentinely through history. It is a highly complex and artful movie made by one of the greatest living directors today. Spending over 13 years of research and a decade to make, this movie is truly a masterpiece, that can only be appreciated by a discerning viewer.",1366416000,31,1167,4.918781725888325

this is one of the rare and select Chinese Martial arts films that transcend being a mere vehicle for the superficial gratification of elaborately staged combats.
This fim is cinematic poetry; and as Ip Man observes, the story of the lives of the two protagonists in this film is likened to an opera; that being said, with an outstanding corps de ballet in the finest traditions of theatrical artistry.

Overall, the film is a masterpiece of visual and spiritually evocative parlance, with select scenes that rival the western biographical film about the painter Vermeer;  ""Girl With A Pearl Earring"" or certain Peter Greenaway films.

This, however, is no fusion of Eastern and Western traditions, nor does it's Asian roots offer challenge to it's Western counterparts; to understand this is a prerequisite to the comprehension and appreciation of what is being presented to the viewer .

So much wasted talent here, like most of this director's over-rated career.  Most of the secondary films about Ip Man are just exaggerated baloney. This one is not just typical, it is an example of crap to the extreme.  Even the choreography of Yuen Woo Ping can't raise this one out of the bottom of films about Ip Man.  This reminds me of U.S. garbage like CW comic heroes - a lot of actors pretending to be martial artists, none of them are any good at it, and the best fight choreographers on the planet can't make a difference.
Absolute crap!!! At least the director didn't shove the Mamas and the Papas down your throat this time around.
Garbage, crap, piece of cinematic dung. I can't say more without getting this review rejected. I bought this at a chain store, a couple of months after it was released in the U.S. and only paid about 3 bucks for it.

5707645,3,B00C9G22R2,"IMHO, this is a really bad movie, but it does have a few redeeming qualities.

First off, as of today 9March2016, there are 3 different 'tracks' on the ""ip Man"" story.
-  There are 4 Ip Man movies that Ip Man's eldest son, Ip Chung was involved in. The original Ip Man had input from both of Ip Man's sons, and the elder Ip Chun actually had cameos in ""The Legend Begins"" and ""The Final Fight"". And on Ip Man 2, I saw an interview with Donnie Yen saying that he talked with Ip Chun again. IMHO, these 4 films wildly diverge from Ip Man's actual life story, and I guess I would say than maybe they are somewhere around 5-10% related to actual events. But what I guess, is that it provides an accurate portrait of the kind of person that Ip Man actually was. Donnie Yen has said repeatedly, that he worked incredibly hard at getting the personality right. For me, these are all Great
-  There is a not yet released, Ip Man 3 movie that I've seen on bootleg. For me, that movie is horrible. Donnie Yen had previously said that after Ip Man 2, he wouldn't do any more of them because he felt ""unwilling to sign up for any more Ip Man movies, with the shameless repetition that is happening in these films, even the most ardent fan would be tired"". THIS MOVIE IP-MAN-3 is exactly what he was concerned about, and I'm still not clear on why he came back to appear in this nonsense film
-  Then there is THIS MOVIE, ""The Grandmaster"". It does have very tiny bits of Ip Man's personality that matches up with the Ip Chun's flavored films, and a tiny bit of historical data.  What this movie really lacks is good martial arts. WireWork everywhere almost no full shots of any real action, instead almost everything is super-close cut shots, with very increase camera speed to give the ""illusion"" of martial arts. And the movie is FILLED with stupid stuff (ie the love-interest ""Gong Er', says that in order to AVENGE her father's death, she vows never to marry or teach martial arts)
HOWEVER, the REAL heart of this movie is actually a really distant unrequited love affair between Gong Er, and Ip Man, This was a made up character, but there were aspects of it that were touching. For me, I don't see why it took YEARs to make this
-
REALITY-CHECK= If you want to know about the REAL Ip Man I have 30 page document of sometimes conflicting information regarding his bio on this site= www-zipz-services-com/public/Ip-Man/  His story IS extremely interesting, especially when you check it against the 4 Ip Chun associated movies. Note even those movies are massively unhistorical, The original Ip Man has him chased from Forshan by the Japanese, actually it was the Chinese Communists under Mao,but for political reasons, that couldn't be in the film.  ALSO, those movies touch on his wive, and especially the the first one. In terms of real data, almost nothing is known about her at all except her name, and she came from a well established family, and died in a certain timeframe. They had 2 daughters, and about all that is known about them is their names, while his two sons both turned out to be VERY important Wing Chun Grandmasters.  THIS MOVIE, ""The Grandmaster"" say that the 2 daughters died of starvation (under Japanese occupation?)",1457481600,,3233,4.542955326460481

5707661,4,B00C9G22R2,"Perhaps many reviewers here have expected the movie to be another biography of Ip Man. Perhaps the US marketing has led viewers to expect a classic martial arts movie. But this film is neither because it is a very serious drama about martial arts. The movie title is ""The Grandmaster"" and it uses Ip Man's life as a premise to explore and question what constitute a Grandmaster. Martial arts at its core isn't about fighting but an art, and the rare few who cultivate it to the highest level become grandmasters. The fictional character (played by Ziyi Zhang) is a contrast / counterpoint to Ip Man, and their interaction probes deeply into the paths and choices that martial artists must face at critical junctures of their practice. The depth and knowledge about martial arts conveyed by Wong Kar Wai is unfortunately too sophisticated for most viewers to grasp.

Sadly, The Grandmaster, which supposedly was""inspired"" by the life of IP Man is a movie that wasted 107 minutes of my life I can never get back.

Ip man isn't as visually stunning as The Grandmaster, but the story is exceptional, and the acting is very well done, except for one minor character that is a bit over the top. The Grandmaster's has the stunning visuals, but the dialog and story line are so bad I couldn't watch this abomination in one sitting. The acting? Words fail me.

The only redeeming feature is that the leading lady is beautifully stunning, and she is the only character that isn't badly acted.

5707729,4,B00C9G22R2,"This is a 5-star movie, docked 1 star solely because the video encoding was made far, far too dark.

This Blu-Ray is the US theatrical release. This particular edit is, in my personal opinion, superior to the China/Hong Kong edit. Yes, there are missing scenes, as well as added scenes, but that is not so important as how the narrative has subtly changed for the better. No longer is the focus on Gong Er's revenge. Instead, it is on Yip Man's journey from China to Hong Kong and what that means for the future of his Kung Fu. Indeed, the newly edited 3D version (released in theaters in early 2015 in Asia) is largely based on the US edit.

Unfortunately, picture quality is seriously compromised by the publisher. Every image from start to finish is 20% too dark and the frame is slightly cropped from the HK Blu Ray release. I have both US and HK versions and have attached pictures to show the difference, side by side. Blacks are  almost completely crushed.

I had attached a screen grab comparison showing the side-by-side difference, but since Amazon has essentially wrecked customer images, there is no way to properly view the image. FWIW, the stretched image they DO display is actually from the HK version, not the US version, which is again much darker.",1421020800,,1266,4.663677130044843

I loved the range of matches and styles as he fights for supremacy as the head of martial arts in China, but then goes into what he sees as exile in Hong Kong as the world he knows vanishes utterly. It will of course draw comparisons with Donnie Yen in the Ip man films, but they are different visions of the same man and what he achieved.  Donnie is great too, a real action film actor, but there is nothing like the quiet power of Tony Leung as an actor.  The chinese version is very long, perhaps too long for some who want non-stop fighting, but the film is called Grandmaster for a reason-he masters himself, others, and is like a skilled chessplayer as he deals with all of his challenges. Beautifully filmed, with wonderful music, this is a masterpiece on many levels, but again, not a typical martial arts film.  More like this, please!  One other point-Donnie and Tony are both in their 50s now!! Whatever they are doing to stay so young looking and fit, I want some!",1420502400,,1216,4.463963963963964

5707738,3,B00C9G22R2,"The two big draws for this film are: a) That it is inspired by the life of [or in other words, a much fictionalized version of] the earlier years of Ip Man, who taught Wing Chun style Kung Fu to Bruce Lee, and that b) The fights were choreographed by Yuen Wo Ping (who choreographed, among other films, the Matrix series and Kill Bill).

If you want more of the history of Ip (or Yip) man, perhaps you should watch Ip Man, Ip Man 2 and The Legend is Born (though all of them also are partially fictionalized) and if you just admire great martial arts, to this day it remains difficult to beat Enter the Dragon.  I found little new to make this film worth watching.  Rather than the Kung Fu, perhaps the historical context is worth emphasizing (which the film leaves in the back seat): that many wealthy and talented Chinese fled to Hong Kong to avoid the Communist regime, which made it a very successful island with one of the highest population densities and average net worth in the world; and that earlier in life Ip Man started out in Foshan in Guongdong province, China.

5707744,1,B00C9G22R2,"It should have been called The Grandfather  it is very slow moving.  Very stereo typical martial arts movie. The old tough boy grimacing faces,the old roundhouse kicks, unbelievable fight scenes, so fake. Pretty blue and yellow color photography, reminded me of: The Sound of Music. A lot of out of focus shots, bad framing. The best is the steel sound when the swords are drawn from the leather scabbards.
  I would like to see any of these feather-weight fairies up against Ali,Leonard,Frazier,or Joe Louis in their heyday. None of these flyers would stand a chance. Always beats me why they throw their punches into the air, when no-one is there. What a waste of energy. When Ali throws a punch, there's a jaw to take it. None of that stupid screaming and air chopping nonsense.  The Grandmaster gets his a@@ kicked by a 95lb waif and deserves it. So predictable though, from the first minute of the film. Not much actor vocal range either. Limited by two tone whispering or screaming,a really annoying way to communicate. What I did like,was the 1950's found footage. Harvey was right in cutting it down, but should have lopped of another 40. It may have done better as a short.
  Fine for a 5 to 8 year old, but not for me. It's my first by this director, and most probably the last.

5707771,3,B00C9G22R2,"I'm a martial artist, not  a martial arts film fan, so when I rent a film on this topic it is rare and with high expectations. The action quickly opened up with way too much violence ala Tarrantino in Kill Bill.  (I bet money the director drew from that movie in his fighting sequences.)  I saw the REDBOX version so Im not sure which one this was. That right there made any REAL Wing Chun almost non-existant, as Wing Chuns main advantage is that it is  a smothering art, an art that tries to quickly shut down an attackers ability to punch or kick at all, and yet we saw the opposite in the fighting sequences.

The frustrating part was that the movie ends in 1953. Ridiculous.  Was it intentional or he ran out of authentic data on the man and didn't want to throw B.S. in as filler? And the last sentence of the movie was kinda ridiculous too. Ip Man was  a very aloof guy and yet was not portrayed that way,which was  a very bad mistake in this movie, I say. Always sitting down in 90% of his photos. I suspect by the time Bruce found him he was apathetic and worn out by life. (Does anyone wonder if Bruce could have beat him right before he died at 33?)  I was really hoping it would have ended maybe with something like this: He is older and not really interested in teaching much anymore. And as he smokes  a cigarette a knock comes at the door and his servant goes...""Master, it is someone named Bruce, do you want to see him?""  And then wearily he gets up and mutters to himself......."" Who could this possibly be?""  Now that would be the bomb!

That said, I feel that seeing how much the man suffered from the Japanese occupation, I was very moved and inspired. And even though I am not going to rate this movie highly for entertainment(the constant darkness was enough to make one depressed)  I think if every father watched this movie with his teen-aged some and said either..........""Every time you complain about your life or feel bad when some girl turned you down you'll never think about again in  a few days, think if you would trade places with this mans tragedy.""  Or............""Son you talk about wanting to do so many things, but this movie shows you whats out there waiting for you...men who devote their life and then some, to one thing. Are you ready for that?""  TO ME that is what this movie was made for. A teaching tool. In fact, it could even be shown in junior high schools(high school is too late) as  a biography lesson. And as well.....something we all never learned in school but should have, lessons on being grateful.  I myself, an ex Wing Chun guy,not knowing when I was young 25 yrs ago when I first started Wing Chun,that so many men in that era especially, trained all day and night at their chosen style,  to us modern westerners would seem almost unbeatable. This film would have either made me train much harder, or....have much  more realistic expectations and do it more for the just the joy of training in this art.  In real life Ip Man was said to be able to ""shut down""  any mans attack, according to men who had traveled to meet him from the US or knew men who had. Id like to have seen that brought out as Wing Chun is ""a smothering""  art as I said. All the fighting choreography was totally not the way wing chun men would fight, yet...the depiction of the other styles seemed very realistic. Go figure.",1408060800,2,3357,4.368760064412238

I'm just now catching up on this recent film by Kar Wai Wong. The last film of his that I saw was ""2046"" which I didn't like. ""The Grandmaster"" is yet another film about Ip Man, who was born Yip Kai-man, who was a student and master of the Wing Chun style of Kung Fu. Bruce Lee was his best known pupil. This film begins in 1936 just prior to WW II and a Japanese invasion is likely.

Recognizing the northern region of China should be more compatible with the southern region and share fighting styles, Master Gong Yutian (Quigxiang Wang) takes his confederates to their leader. He is about to retire with Ma San (Zhang Jin) as his successor. As was apparently the custom at the time, Gong solicits a challenge from the best of the south. This turns out to be Ip Man (Tony Leung). The challenge isn't a fight however, it is to crack a cookie in half being held by Gong. Ip Man manages somehow to do it using some hand gestures and swift movements.

A rematch is insisted upon by Gong's daughter, Gong Er (Ziyi Zhang). In one of the sexiest Kung Fu fights I've ever seen, Ip and Er engage in a Kung Fu ballet of beauty, where Er even seems to take flight. This isn't blood sport. It is to see who can win without breaking anything in the house. It is totally mesmerizing. In fact, I found the whole movie to be mesmerizing.

In the film's opening scene we see Ip in one of those battles against hordes of attackers during a rainstorm. For a minute I was thinking, didn't I just see this in ""Raid 2""? Well, yes and no. Sure the rain provides an excellent opportunity to show off the fighting skills, but this isn't head cracking, blood spurting violence. It's beautifully choreographed by the great Yuen Woo-ping (""Kill Bill: Vol. 2""). The film is beautifully shot by Phillipe Le Sourd providing visual eye candy throughout. The film is loaded with great color and includes an amazing soundtrack by Stefano Lentini. Bits of orchestral flourishes and operatic arias add a certain sophistication and grace to the fights. Trust me, it all works.

I would be remise by not mentioning the great fight scene between Er and Ma San. Ma San was Gong Yutian's pupil and adopted son. When he turned on his Master, he also took his title and his home. So a big showdown features the two, dressed in winter finery, duking it out in a snowstorm beside a speeding train. Another beautifully created scene. As much as I like this film, it is a bit confusing in terms of the narrative. I suspect something is lost in the cultural translation, but it may also be because this film runs about 22 minutes shorter than the original Chinese release. This film shares a conceptual beauty with Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."" If you liked that film, you'll like this one. Highly Recommended.

I did watch this movie on Blu ray which does not include the original 130 minute version. It looks great. Shot using a 2.35:1 aspect ratio and the usual 1080p resolution, I have no complaints. The detail is excellent. The multicolored Chinese clothing produces examples of clarity and contrast. Black levels are good. I will admit to being wowed by the film itself and may have missed some mistakes, but none I could remember. The audio is even better. The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 in Mandarin is dramatically better than the Dolby Digital 5.1 English dubbed track. Go with the DTS. The English subtitles are easy to read. Other subtitles are available in Spanish and English SDH. You will get a sense of the quality of the audio in the aforementioned early fight scene. The rain, splashing puddles, fight blows and body thuds dance around the surrounds. The excellent soundtrack is beautifully displayed throughout the film. Dialog is properly centered and clear. This is demo quality.

The following is from the longer 130 minute Chinese version:

Having seen and reported on the American 108 minute release, I thought watching this Chinese 130 minute release would help sort things out. Technically, either version is a masterpiece in filmmaking. As far as the Blu ray treatment, I found little difference. Memories of this sort are fleeting by nature but I thought the visuals in this longer version was just a bit hazier than the U. S. release. So what are the differences? I think some are significant and others not so much. Here are a few of the more important ones.

It is clear that the 108 minute version is much more linear in the storytelling. The 130 minute version skips back and forth several times, always with inter-titles to keep things orderly. The American release spends much more time with Ip Man than with Gong Er. In the longer version, the story gives almost equal time to each. While the American version hints around the edges of romantic sparks between Ip and Er, the longer version fleshes out their feeling in additional scenes together. Not that they ever act upon them, but the sexual tension is always there.

The American version jumps into the story with a series of title cards letting us know what is going on that led up to the events in Foshan where the story begins. The Chinese version has a long lead up using various scenes. I don't remember either version addressing what happened to Mrs. Ip. There is a scene just prior to the fight involving Gong Yutian and Ip in the Chinese version which adds some context to why Gong chose to challenge Ip with the cookie.

The Chinese version includes a long scene where Gong Er is riding the train alone, when ""Razor"" sits down across from her. He is evidently a spy or something and is badly wounded. Japanese soldiers board the train and demand ID's. Er switches seats and cuddles up to him hiding his wound with her fur coat. They appear as a loving couple and the Japanese abruptly call off the search. ""Razor's"" character only pops into the film 2 or 3 times. I'm still confused as to what his role represents. Another side of Ip perhaps?

The Chinese version makes a big deal out of Gong Er's decision as to whether to challenge Ma Sun who had killed her father and taken control of the 64 Hands. Revenge would be counter to her father's wishes to seek a peaceful life as a wife (she was engaged but broke it off but in the American version, I don't recall it being mentioned) and/or doctor. After the terrific battle between Gong Er and Ma Sun, she is seriously injured leading to her Opium addiction. The American version only hints at it. The Chinese version is more explicit.

The Chinese version spends more time showing the love between Ip Man and his wife. She washes his chest. He washes her legs. So which version is preferred? I like the longer version. It fills in some gaps and enhances all of the relationships. I can see where the American version was thought to satisfy more audiences. It is shorter, keeps much of the subtext and inherent romance in check but still is an excellent film. But potential viewers expecting non-stop martial arts fighting will be disappointed with both versions. But for me, it's the longer version is just perfect and the shorter version comes up just a bit...short.

Here are the extras from the 108 minute version:

5707795,4,B00C9G22R2,"I've been a fan of Wong Kar Wai since the film 2046, one of my favorites of all time. He does not disappoint in this tale of Ip Man, on of China's most legendary martial arts masters. Although the trailers deceivingly advertise this as an action film, it is more of a romantic drama. That is in line with Wong Kar Wai's film style, but might not be what some viewers expect. Not to say that there was no action, but simply that the film is not FOCUSED on action, but instead what Ip Man may have been as a man, and a possible romantic relationship with another master, played by the beautiful and talented Ziyi Zhang.

Tony Leung is an outstanding actor, and doesn't disappoint here. But the true magic is in the film-making, where Wong Kar Wai paints with his poetic brush, giving every moment a kind of magic, even in stillness. Truly lovely cinematography makes this film a joy to take in. I would have liked to see the fights performed more realistically, which is the only reason I gave it four stars out of five. Since it deals with an actual person, I thought the slow motion and wire work detracted a bit from what could have been more believable fight scenes. That is a small quip, however, and definitely not enough to make this anything but a fantastic film.",1401062400,,1269,4.423076923076923
5707796,1,B00C9G22R2,"I was so very disappointed with this movie. It was more like a soap opera than an action movie. There was only one action scene

5707799,4,B00C9G22R2,"Overall The Grandmaster is a good movie, particularly with the authenticity and philosophical essence of the martial arts that are reflected in this movie.

5707811,4,B00C9G22R2,"This is a wonderful movie. Wong Kar-Wai's gorgeous visual style and Yuen Woo-Ping's masterful choreography are a match made in kung fu heaven. However, if you want a fast paced, edge of your seat action movie, look elsewhere. The Grandmaster has some breathtaking action, sure, but it is first and foremost a drama, but it's a good one, so hopefully that won't be an issue for you. A lot has been said in these reviews of the difference between the Chinese and American cuts of the film. I have watched both many, many times, and while I prefer the original, the American edit is also very good. It is more streamlined, plot-wise, has some scenes in a different order for the sake of clarity, and more/different voiceover and exposition. Each version includes some footage that the other does not, but the Chinese cut is longer overall. I wish both versions had been included on the American blu ray release, but they were not. I'm hoping they'll release a ""director's cut"" or ""international version"" at some point, but I'm not holding my breath. If they do, hopefully it will have some decent bonus features, which is the one area that this release is sorely lacking in.",1398211200,,1171,4.717073170731707
5707812,3,B00C9G22R2,This was a good movie to watch but after a while it seems like you get lost in the time line of the movie. Tony Leung was a good Wing Chung teacher.

The only movie I've every watched twice and was equally enthralled the second go around. This movie is so subtlety complex. The biographical story, the kung fu, the actors are, dare I say, just a sub context of ""the movie"". It's the visuals which enthralled me.

The best I can explain it, it's much akin to visual art in motion. Good descriptive words: Russian ballet, Ansel Adams, Leica camera, Leonardo Da Vinci, the Wachowski bothers.

Much like looking at a piece of renaissance artwork in a museum, you just stand there and stare, for a long time.

5707819,5,B00C9G22R2,"So beautiful..so lovely... Foreign films never ceize to touch the heart deep and tug at the soul to create that feeling of butterflies in the heart. They are not shallow and opposite of most martial art films. The film is filled with action and a lot of fighting nothing too spectaculiar but good enough. I don't know why but zhang ziyi never disappoints she is one of the best actresses around and maybe the best in her country. I love her. Such grace and beauty to this role. I love how she brings to life the love and beauty this film expresses through the poetry of words, skill and the art of fighting. What a lovely film. My only pet peeve is how foreign films always have this hint of dark kamikaze, depressing parts and twist as if it's forbidden to have any sort of happiness or happy ending. It leaves a bad taste in your mouth. This film is genuinely ""salt"" as in colorful and has a sense of value and worth, the opposite of garbage and junk which many films I've seen recently are. The film is about a 4 or 4 1/2 star film I gave it 5 because it was at 3 1/2 and I wanted to bump it up to 4 because I felt the beauty of the film surpassed in many ways deserving of a solid 4 star rating! In terms of lp man and martial arts it falls short to the lp (Donnie yen) films by a large margin but this is still a great film!.

""The portrayal of emotion, the portrayal of right and wrong, the portrayal of the characters all spoke through the movement of the martial arts it 's so beautiful~Shannon Lee (about this movie) pretty much sums it up

Having been a fan of Bruce Lee's Enter the dragon back in the day, I was eager to see the story of Ip Man.  After watching, I found that the movie at times was a bit confusing and the story not always clear and not because it is a Chinese movie with English subtitles.  I didn't realize until after watching the movie that there are two versions of this movie, one of which, was edited and changed and one longer length version that was seen in Asia.  Suddenly it all became clear why some of the scenes of the shorter version I watched seemed chopped and sometimes hard to follow.  Its a shame too as the movie had a good story but in the international verison, they chopped some of the scenes that should have stayed in and left some scenes that could have been cut a little.

The fight scenes were very nicely choreographed and very well done and definitely the highlight of the movie.  Unfortunately the chopped up version I saw made the story hard to follow and confusing, therefore getting the rating it does.

The americans built theaters and there they showed their movies, to sell their values, their way of life, their heroes. And for a very long time they succeeded! The chinese, now that they became this great nation of today,  are doing just the same: showing in their films heroes like Confuncius, Ypi Man etc. I have already seen at least half a dozen films about Ypi Man: as the great chinese hero in the war against the japanase, or against  european imperialism, or as Bruce Lee's teacher etc. He is always a just man, he is a sage, he sacrifices himself for the whole of society etc. Wonderful!  But THE GRANDMASTER is, most of all, a Wong Kar Wai movie. He is one of the greatest directors of our time, with a very special style, his very own language, a peculiar use of colour and music, exquisite camera movements and beautiful and sad stories of unhappy love. You may also say that he is, like Ypi Man, a great chinese hero, a very personal moviemaker in a collective society, a genius of cinema in a place where to be a genius may be very dangerous. It is a beautiful film. Don't miss it! Oh, and the fights are great! (PS: The real Ypi Man never wore that white hat. It is the director's creation and great too.)",1396569600,,1325,4.422131147540983

This film blends docudrama with Victorian English romance-tragedy writing with Chinese opera.
It utilizes camera angles to create action and mood more so than most martial arts films and with far fewer wire and blood action scenes. It also emphasizes rain, darkness, shadow, sound, music and early 20th century sets (e.g. steam trains with lots of steam) to heighten mood.

Story traces martial styles and philosophies as they influenced Ip and subsequently Bruce Lee. As an aside, I remember Bruce as a pretty good bball pickup player at the UW.",1394928000,,791,5.2204724409448815

5707844,2,B00C9G22R2,"I still remember rather vividly my first impression of Kar Wai Wong.  It was late, my wife and daughter were in bed, and I decided to take Chungking Express out of the Nexflix package and pop it in for some me time.  Id been excited to wrap my head around the beloved hype that surrounded Wong as a director, but especially the film itself, which is often raved as his finest.  I sat there for the entirety of the film with wide eyes, basking in the beauty of it all, and then as it ended I found myself shaking off the veneer of visual splendor to declare the film a mediocre shame.

THAT WAS IT?

I know that my opinion of that particular film is a rare one (but I am not alone, I know that for sure) but it is my opinion and remains that way.  Sadly, my first experience with Wong was not the one I wanted it to be.  My second was much better, for the next film I saw was My Blueberry Nights, and once again it was visually stunning and yet confused, messy and somewhat vapid.

They say third time is a charm for a reason; and In the Mood for Love is that reason.

Since devouring that film, Ive quickly consumed all things Kar Wai Wong, and I continue to look forward to his works despite the rare hiccups.  His trilogy (Days of Being Wild, In the Mood for Love & 2046) remains my favorite trilogy of all time and his stunning ability to portray the hostilities, frailties and honesties of love in the most languid and richly beautiful ways has made films like Happy Together so utterly refreshing.  Having recently seen Ashes of Time, I felt good and ready for Wongs take on the Kung-Fu genre (yes, Im fully aware that Ashes of Time is NOT a Kung-Fu movie, but you can ascertain the similarities).  The fact that this received relatively strong reviews and even racked up a few Oscar nominations (and came close to a nomination for Foreign Film) had me even more excited for this to be a needed comeback for the director.

Honestly, he hasn't made ANYTHING since My Blueberry Nights!

Sadly, for me at least, The Grandmaster was not the sweet redemption I wanted it to be.  Instead, this was kind of a tedious bore.  I will admit that walking in, I was not aware of any of the backstory of history of biographical shades to this story, so I was learning as it went along.  I wasn't really interested.  Maybe I should have been, but I found it really hard to.  I think that this is one of those instances where a more linear or direct narrative would have benefited the film.  Instead, Wongs signature visual style and flow is a distraction and makes this rather involved storyline feel empty and soulless.

It just kind of floats visually but falls flat narratively.

The layered storytelling, with flashbacks and narrative jumps, gets lost in the stylized visuals and becomes choppy and incoherent.  The story becomes increasingly more difficult to follow, the fights difficult to differentiate and the characters and ultimately the story itself almost impossible to care about.  Despite some rich cinematography and interestingly choreographed fight sequences (not to mention a beautifully tapered performance by Ziyi Zhang), The Grandmaster become an exercise in my patience as I try desperately to attach myself to it in some way.

Instead I walked away thinking to myselfTHAT WAS IT?

And now were back where we started with Wong.",1394582400,,3340,4.5620805369127515

Since the movie deals with a real-life person, the details provided are important, but the best part of this film is the beauty of the camerawork. You see Wong's vision of each scene through the camera: how each shot is planned and set up to the smallest detail.  The fight scenes in the rain are exquisite, with the eye following splashes and drops as they fly in slow motion off the actors  against the gorgeous musical score.  The visual element of Wong's films is always stunning, and Grandmaster does not disappoint.  The other familiar element of Wong Kar-Wai's films is how he gets under the skins of his characters to reveal both their strengths and their weaknesses and, most of all, their humanity.",1394496000,,851,4.722972972972973

5707870,5,B00C9G22R2,"I've seen the U.S. version of this film about a half dozen times in theaters. Needless to say, I'm a huge fan. But I've been wondering if, as some have suggested, it's a ""dumbed down"" edit for American audiences compared to the longer Hong Kong release. So when this Blu-ray's launch date was delayed, I decided to buy the HK version and I was surprised by the differences in ways I did not expect at all.

Let me start with the bad news first: if you're a fan of the film, you really need to own both versions. Both have important strengths, and neither one is a wholly satisfying substitute for the other. BUT if you forced me to pick just one, I'd have to say the U.S. release would be it, and that's not the conclusion I expected to reach. Here are the pros and cons of each:

HK PROS:

1) It fully fleshes out a few characters who have been edited down to cardboard cutouts in the American release. In particular, you'll be astonished at how much more there is to the stories of The Razor, Madame Ip and Ding Lianshan (the guy who only shows up in the cigarette lighting scene with Ip in the U.S. version.)

2) There is just a little more background information to many things throughout the film, which makes for a more complete story.

HK CONS:

1) It eliminates the amazing scenes of Gong Er, both as a child and an adult, practicing martial arts in the snow!!! These are some of my favorite scenes in the whole movie, and I was shocked to find them gone in the longer version.

2) It doesn't mention that Ip Man trained Bruce Lee! Again, I was shocked, since this is such a key revelation in the U.S. release, and it brings Ip's story full circle. Maybe the assumption was that Asian audiences would just know this.

3) The HK version just doesn't feel as taut and powerful as the U.S. release. Yes, this is a very subjective comment, but I thought the longer lengths of just about everything in the film left the pacing feeling sluggish and ""off"" by comparison.

HK DIFFERENCES (not pro or con, just different from U.S.)

1) The U.S. release focuses on Gong Er's later opium addiction, and is clear that she died from it. The HK version mentions but doesn't focus on the addiction, and is vague about whether she died from it it's presented as just one possibility rather than a certainty. I'm not sure which version is the more accurate.

2) Gong Er is more focused on vengeance in the HK version.

3) In the key early scene where Ip Man breaks the cake in the hand of the Northern Grandmaster, Ip says something very different after breaking it than he does in the U.S. version.

U.S. PROS:

1) Ultimately, while you lose what I've mentioned above in this edited version, the editing makes for a tighter, better paced and more powerful film. And this is why I'd pick this release if I could only choose one.

2) There's a difference in the scoring of the U.S. version (though not a new score)--probably driven by the differences in editing--and it also contributes to the U.S. release being more powerful.

3) It contains the unmissable scenes of Gong Er practicing in the snow.

4) It contains the important info about Bruce Lee.

U.S. CONS:

1) Poor development of a few important characters (see above)

2) Less background info throughout (but the story is still completely understandable)

Well, there you have it! Thanks for taking the time to read my review, and I hope you find in helpful in making a buying decision!",1392681600,113,3436,4.4743589743589745
5707871,3,B00C9G22R2,"I'm not fit to judge this film because I'm just not a fan of the genre.

So I must admit that to me, the whole karate, kung fu, whatever stuff seems rather silly, save the ""self discipline"" part.  I do respect that part.  But otherwise, much ado about nothing.  Maybe I just don't ""get it"" somehow 'cause I'm on the same wavelength as Chris Rock when he said, ""Russian tanks could be rolling down Flatbush Blvd, but I ain't fightin'.""

Anyway I just watched the film because it was nominated for a couple of Academy Awards (cinematography and costume design), but I fell asleep briefly several times.  But I'm guessing fans of the genre really liked the film 'cause it gives some history of two of their heroes, the guy (Ip Man) who apparently trained Bruce Lee and some girl, Gong Ir.  I did learn a little history of this sort of stuff.

Not sure why this film was nominated over others for cinematography.  Seems like so many of the scenes were dark and often rainy and the costumes just were not memorable to me.  But likely I should have paid closer attention.  The film just didn't grab me.  But again, when it comes to this genre, I'm just not so smart.

5707879,5,B00C9G22R2,"are a whole other universe.

Zhang Yimou is consciously a visualist in film.  Wong Kar-Wai is consciously a visualist in film.  Zhang Yimou is entirely normal in substance.  Wong Kar-Wai is untethered from norms, usualities, expectations, in substance.  He is anomalous, progenitor of the distinctively anonymous.

This is a grand film visually; a grand film substantively.  A film which predicts nothing, but from which one perhaps can be expected to learn, even if that is opposed to one's hynotization to entertainment.

There is an ""Eastern"" ""philosophical"" ""maxim"" along the lines of:

The wheel is composed of an outer rim, and spokes which array the power from and to hub to rim, rim to hub.  But at the center of the hub is emptiness, nothing, around which the wheel revolves.  The wheel works because of nothingness.

Western philosophy is outward aggression -- proof and fact.  Eastern ""philosophy"" is a knowledge of the unknowable -- ""knowing"" and intuition tensioned against each other.  He said,

""What!?""

""Nothing.""

This is not an action film.  This is a contemplation for those who know that thought-understanding is a limitation.

And all of that is speculative nonsense called (in the West) ""philosophy"".

In prosaic terms, this film is stunning, visually, and in inferences, or impartations, from dialog.  Watch and listen without getting one's analytic thinking in the way.

With subsequent viewings, one can begin to appreciate the very fine acting, the wonderful cinematography, the powerful soundtrack, and the film-maker's mastery. The fight sequences were beautiful to watch, marvelously choreographed and filmed. I think the success of the film, however, hinged mostly on Zhang Ziyi's portrayal of the noble and tragic Gong Er, a difficult character to flesh out in the short duration of the movie especially with Ip Man's character dominating.

What I couldn't get past was Zhang Ziyi speaking in Mandarin while Tony Leung spoke Cantonese... and the English subtitles often don't capture the true meanings of their dialogue. It's basically 2 people speaking different languages and the subtitles are written by a lazy interpreter. With the understanding that during the early part of the 20th Century, multiple dialects were used in China along with numerous different currencies. One of the first things that Mao accomplished was to unify currency and language. However, for the intent of the movie, I felt it would have been better if they used one dialect for the dialogue. Zhang Ziyi was really the highlight of this movie, although her character doesn't have as large of a role.

5707908,5,B00C9G22R2,"(A repost for the same movie. Not a review but ... this is what I feel.)

I regret missing this movie in a big cinema.  After watching the freshly arrived Amazon purchased DVD last night, I still do not want to let go of the residual fragrant of the Grand Master from Won Kar Wai.  It was as if I took a little trip back into a dream world, only got woken up all too soon.  I want to go back.  I have not had enough.  I want to relive the journey again.  And I want to experience and feel it all.

Much has been read before I watched the movie.  Many has analyzed, dissected, and criticized the movie.  They had not damped my anticipation.  And still the journey was more than worthwhile.

I supposed it helps if you are Chinese or brought up in the Chinese culture.  I speak and prefer Mandarin over Cantonese.  I nearly panicked when the cover of the DVD reads, Language: Cantonese.  Fortunately, the only language spoken on this disk is Mandarin.

Yes, for me nostalgia is a big part of the charm for the movie.  It is more Chinese than the world I grew up in, and it exists only in dusty books and tales I read about.  The color, the mood, the mannerism, and the language together played a symphony in my heart.  Oh, the language and the richness of the words spoken... this is what I would go back for.  The beautifully crafted words have layers of meaning and connotation.  I was able to capture some but not all.  Using the old language like that is pretty much a lost art in our literal modern world.  How I wish I could have a sliver of the talent to craft words like that.

If you are able to let go and fall into the intriguing world of these masters you will be mesmerized by this epic journey into Chinese martial art world.  I did.

xxxx

Still loving the Grandmasters after the second viewing. This time something else captivated me.

In the past, at one point, people actually kept their words, and lived according to a high moral standard.  One would repay a single kind act with one's whole life. Like the Gong Er's servant, who served and dedicated his whole like to the father and the daughter because Master Gong saved him from drifting in the street.  People like that actually existed, I knew from my parent's generation. That world has vanished, except in movies like this. I revere the integrity of these people, and I mourn for bondage they carried, and the weathering of time.

I am thankful, for this movie keeps that world alive, if only for a couple of hours at a time!",1390089600,2,2499,4.332613390928726

No. For one thing, I don't really care for the martial arts movies that have people walking on tiny tree limbs or jumping backward onto stair railings that are angled down without sliding. Don't get me wrong, 200 guys with swords against one isn't realistic but that is just too much for me.

This was made far too dramatic...and the drama was from staring at one another without saying anything and music...not dialogue or action or situations that were thought provoking.

This should have been filled with a lot of ""ohs"" from the martial arts moves. Well, I guess it was, my wife and I were like, ""oh, what a waste"", ""Oh my god that was terrible"", ""oh man, that's six hours (or however long the movie was) that we'll never get back.""

5707953,1,B00C9G22R2,"Rains drops that shine like diamonds. A choreographed battle becomes a dance of graceful, powerful movement. The violence becomes beautiful. With this incredible fight scene director Kar Wai Wong opens The Grandmaster.

Then Wong replicates the same techniques over and over again ad nauseam, expecting fancy camera angles and beautiful set designs to carry an entire 90-minute feature. The result, a film where absolutely nothing happens.

Phillipe le Sourds cinematography here resembles that of Christopher Doyles in Hero (2002). That is to say, its amazing, but just in case we didn't recognize its amazingness in the first scene, the second scene, or even the tenth scene, Director Wong insists that we better recognize. Wong pummels the viewer to death with le Sourds blazing techniques. Identical shot after identical shot render le Sourds imagery utterly meaningless.

This film stars the great of Zizi Zhang of Crouching Tiger (2000) and Hero fame. Here she plays a supporting character, and, oh yeah, is totally wasted as an actress. The disorganized mess of direction spends more time showing slow motion side angles of her pretty face than probably any other single device in the film. Zhangs combat is graceful as always, but this gets boring fast as there is no discernable purpose to all her fighting.

The main character Ip Man flees whatever Chinese town hes from as the crisis of a Japanese invasion occurs, but we don't even care. Eventually Zhangs character and Ip Man magically meet up in Hong Kong, but by this point, thanks to the miasmic mess that has spewed fourth since the beginning of the film, the only think we do care about as viewers is the amount of time left until the credits roll.

5707955,5,B00C9G22R2,"This is a Wong Kar Wai film. If you know and like his work, you won't be disappointed with this one. The style and quality are consistent with his previous films, the acting is fine, the characters are interesting, the drama is compelling enough. Fans of his work typically enjoy his films for their style, atmosphere, and photography. Here all three are done well, the last of which is arguably as good if not better than it's ever been with French DP Philippe Le Sourd rather than Christopher Doyle, who famously shot In the Mood For Love. Tony Leung is excellent as usual in the lead role, if for no reason other than that he is a damn good-looking man and gets the job done. My only general complaint is that the film lacks a clear cut objective from the onset. Instead it sort of rambles on about the two central characters and the context in which they struggled to exist. It's typical of the director to be honest, so Wai fans will not be surprised by this. Fan or newcomer, the viewer at least has magnificent images to lose oneself in from start to finish.",1388361600,,1065,4.438775510204081

The trailer is to die for! Who wouldn't go see a film with moody, dark shots in rain storms. Fists and feet flying! A really upset looking Chinese dude fighting hordes of nameless Kung Fu fighters!  In the rain! In the dark! Splish, splash, kung fu blood bath! Sign me up!

Okay, watched it. WISH I HAD MY MONEY AND TIME BACK.

If chick flicks with lots of rain, pretty colors, extreme depth of field shots of people looking serious, and slow motion montages of unidentifiable body parts making turns and twists--Is your thing, then this film is for you.

God, enough with the slow motion and rain already! Spare me you self absorbed, narcissistic, over blown bitch of a movie.  OH, SORRY: SPOILER ALERT. LOL!

If you want a classic martial arts film with excellent choreography (Shame on you Yen Woo Ping), fast pacing and an engaging cast of characters, this will sorely disappoint you.

It's actually a drawn out love story pretending to be the story of Wing Chun master Ip Man. What this should have been is a superior update of Jimmy Wang Yu's CHINESE PROFESSIONALS.

Instead it become a self absorbed pseudo Greek tragedy, replete with characters doomed to die before they complete their life's mission, with little to offer other than depth of field photography and way too freaking much slow motion employed during the curiously vague and unimaginative fight scenes.

There's a boat load of interesting characters, including an imposing fighter who uses a barber's razor to inflict severe pain and death upon his opponents. He is quickly dispatched with what appears to be a nail with a chain attached, and he's gone from the film. WHAT!?? In fact, most of the more intriguing fighters in the film, are all looks an no show. Too bad, because the film would have won me over had they played a major part in the film.

The story touches---or attempts to touch-- on the Japanese occupation before and during World War 2, but sidesteps dealing with their atrocities in a few flashbacks, instead driving us to drink with the absurd love story backdrop of this scattered mess of a movie.

Of all the Ip Man films now out, this ranks near the bottom. For insomniacs, it's a sure fire winner. For those of us trying to find a well done action film with a good story, it's like watching paint dry.

You know the magician who holds shiny thing in one hand to distract you from the real ""point""..? Yep, that's this film in a nutshell.

Hey Wong Kar Wai: how about tossing the shiny thing aside and working on making the REAL THING--the story, worth our time.

5707983,1,B00C9G22R2,"After watching and purchasing all the other Ip Man movies as l came across them, I have to say this particular offering left me sort of cold. Tony Leung and the rest of the cast all did well in their respective roles, and the focus on the fighting was as expected, but the storyline disappointed me. The faulty philosophies which seemed to only contribute to defeat and denial frustrated me. Each person who was supposedly ""undefeated"" in their field, were immediately defeated in the next breath due to the imposition of an outside factor which actually had nothing to do with the actual challenge. The continuous intrusion of abounding pride, thinly veiled by elaborate pretension of humility caused each one to be categorically blind to personal flaws of judgment and skill, as well as ignorant of any analysis regarding deeper motivational forces of their opponent. Through overweening pride and inability to reach past their own skin, each one suffered far greater personal loss, permanent loss, than any brought about by the actual outcome of a match. Passion contained and extinguished is passion wasted. It turned a story of martial arts into a tragedy, or tried to. Not my idea of a love story.",1386979200,4,1203,4.931034482758621

5707989,1,B00C9G22R2,"I am a huge fan of Wong Kar-Wai's films, and was eagerly awaiting my chance to see this one, as I am also a huge fan of martial arts films.  What a huge disappointment it was.  It is the worst film I have seen in a long time.  It was like WKW was on really bad opium.  What an ugly dream he had!  The whole film is bathed in mucky muddy water.  The photography is so dark that, at times, the only way you knew there were people on screen was when their faces were caught in what feeble light there was.  All of the fight sequences were shot primarily in extreme close up so that all you were given to see were blows landed and the reactions to them.  The camera seldom pulled back far enough for you to actually see the action of the fighting itself.  THIS IS NOT A MARTIAL ARTS FILM!

Given WKW's rep. as a truly great cinematic artist, one could have hoped for at least something fabulous in terms of visual style, great story telling, and fine acting (especially given the lead actors).  But none of that appeared on screen.  In some respects it reminded me of his incomparable masterpiece IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE: lots of slow motion, lots of ""restraint"", lots of rain, bla bla bla.  There it all worked because it was part and parcel with the story.  Underneath that surface was a story of astonishing power.  One CARED hopelessly about the hopeless love the two characters imposed on themselves.  The gorgeous surface was the ocean on which their ships of love sailed off in different directions.  In GRANDMASTER the surface was nothing but dirty rain water in the street thru which we tried in vain to see anything but the artless, studied ennui that's all there is to be seen.  The leads, Ziyi Zhang & Tony leung (both of whom I like a lot) just walked thru their paces as if they were bored having to do the same old thing yet once again.  When it finished I said to myself, surely this can't be a Wong Kar-Wai film.

Inevitably GRANDMASTER gets compared to Donnie Yen's IP MAN.  There is no comparison.  IP MAN is the superior film in every respect.  Yes, the storytelling is a bit clunky and overly sentimental at times, but still it moves you, and it is visually quite satisfying.  It's not ""beautiful"", but the times then in China were not beautiful times.  But what makes that film so superior to GRANDMASTER are the fight sequences, of which there are many, which are shot with consummit skill and  with enough distance from the action to allow the viewer the opportunity to really witness the skills and techniques involved.  And they're not gratuitous show pieces.  They're actually an integral part of the story.  And they're amazing!

Where both films are utter failures is as bio-pics.  The only resemblence either film has to the actual Ip Man, is that the both portray him as a master of the wing chun school of martial arts and that he ended his life in Hong Kong where he eventually opened a school from which his star pupil Bruce Lee was to emerge.  Everything else in both films is fiction.  But at least in IP MAN the fiction is true to the times, whereas in GRANDMASTER the fiction is nothing but pseudo-oriental philosophical drivel which made no effort whatever towards a believeable veracity.  In IP MAN, Donnie Yen created a believeable person.  In GRANDMASTER Tony Leung was just tired old Tony Teung.  From what I've read online, the real Ip Man was just a policeman in his Chinese home town.

I think all the glowing reviews for this film are like the Emperor's courtiers swooning over his ""new clothes"".  Face it folks: in this case the Emperor was naked and a big mess.

Not being overly familiar with the story of IP man, I found myself scratching my head as the tale seems to assume you know it as well as knowing Chinese culture. I do not and for that reason, I didn't get much from the film which was lengthy and at times a docu-drama. If people weren't fighting, they were talking. It appeared as if China took old newsreels, colorized them and stuck them into this production. The film also includes some ridiculous anti-gravity fighting.

This is nothing at all like what those trailers suggest.

The Grandmaster is moody, epic, romantic, esoteric, and gorgeous. Everything one would expect from Wong Kar-Wai. It just so happens to have some excellent martial arts scenes throughout as well, which is made all the more impressive by knowing the lead actors did their own fight choreography for the film.

This is not a movie for people who like high octane martial arts gorefests. This is a martial arts movie for people who like art house Chinese cinema. Be warned, and seriously, give it a chance if you're skeptical. Just know what you're getting into up front and you may be pleasantly surprised.

For those who're fond of Kungfu/martial arts movies or simply interested in the life of Ip Man, you might feel disappointed as this is not a typical Kungfu movie.  The story is very much fictional and not at all a documentary of his life.  Cultural gaps might impede understanding also: all those historical events (e.g., republic, warlords, anti-Japanese war, civil war) caused tremendous changes to Chinese history and culture.  Individuals were so powerless and resigned to the arrangement of fate.  When those characters had to flee from the mainland and ""disguised"" as a barber or a doctor in a new place, I feel it's a sad salute to their glorious past.

The key word of martial arts has always been ""arts"" in literature and movies, so the movie incorporates lots of cultural and aesthetic elements which may not seem martial/action at all to some audience.  I like what Gong Er said in the end that what she saw in her father was rather ""a code of honor.""  She was the one who refused to move on with time, obsessed with the elegance and decency of the past time.  I bet you find people like this in every place and every generation, like Miss Havisham's clock...

Wong Kar-Wai's romances are always about missing out the person/time/opportunity, and that's still my favorite part (e.g., coat button).  A good movie speaks of your unspoken pains.

I'm a bit disappointed that the movie is titled ""The Grandmaster"" in the US instead of ""The GrandmasterS"" (the original English title I believe).  Like I said, it's a salute to a generation of people, to their spirits, passions, code of honor, and of course, the lost love.",1385856000,3,1845,4.853035143769968

It describes the man who influenced Bruce Lee, and also provides an insight into martial arts as a life discipline which was graciously granted to few and only if invited. I liked how each master was portrayed - skillful, controlled, calculated... But even a master is not shielded from tyranny of other - however, they have trained themselves to act according to the martial arts philosophy, and it assists them to proceed despite difficult circumstances.

I wasn't aware where kung fu originated from, and that it even had such deep roots. To me kung fu was a cheesy movie from the seventies, and a skinny fourteen year old sarcastically flinging his limbs in a un-coordinated cacophony until his fascination passes to the next cheesy thing he sees on the tube.

This movie is quite a masterful artwork of visually beautiful depictions of the life story of ""the grandmaster"". Martial arts is described as a way of life, which one is to dedicate themselves to early in life, and adopt its traditions, understand its complex teaching, practice, and strive for excellence, goodness, and altruism as a human being. It was like the master was a Buddhist teacher helping a grasshopper along the way with koans and instilling firmness of character by their wisdom.

I really enjoyed this movie, not only because it was so steeped visual beauty, but more that it captured the essence of such an interesting human being as ""the Grandmaster"". Also, it was unusually and refreshing to see a movie where most meaning is conveyed by stillness, and that which is spoken is often weighted carefully by the speaker. The combat scenes are showed as two individuals comparing strengths, with no intention to kill, unless truly they have a good reason to. There is no aggression, no show for entertainment, no force greater then necessary, each move is performed with precision, and each move carries meaning in this movie. The combat is more like a dance, a battle between two skillful minds, and its outcome is already decided even before a single move is made. Characters are filled with stillness and no word is wasted, while the combat is faster than one can capture with ones eye. I liked that contrast in this movie.

This movie taught me/ showed me that a master is not who conquers others and uses force (Japanese), but one who masters themselves and understand their obligation to use their life for the good of others. It was quite an interesting movie. It does have sub-titles, and sometimes I didn't have time to read the whole sentence. The only reason I didn't give it five stars, is that it was sometimes too much for a viewer which has been consuming the mediocrity and simplicity of Hollywood. Great movie!

5708033,4,B00C9G22R2,"I suppose being Bruce Lee's former teacher and someone who had made the martial art Wing Chun known around the world, the curiosity around his life became so strong that director Wilson Yip and Herman Yau had their turn in bringing his life to the big screen. Wilson Yip's ""Ip Man"" was a film with a lot of fiction around it, which focused entirely on action sequences with Donnie Yen in the title role. Herman Yau's ""The Legend is Born: Ip Man"" was an unspectacular martial arts drama but a little more subtle and certainly not as bombastic as Wilson Yip's films. Please take note that Wong Kar-Wai's rendition of Master Ip's life was never meant as a martial arts action flick.

Well, finally the highly anticipated film about Ip Man directed by Wong Kar-Wai has finally arrived. A little different from his usual films, as the film goes for refreshing ideas and themes rather than decadent emotions, it is a film that has a lot of hype as with any other film directed by him. People should be aware that one needs to temper their expectations with Wong Kar-Wai's ""The Grandmaster"". It is a film about a true-to-life figure and is a period piece that brings the concept of how martial arts can apply to living. Wong Kar-Wai takes on a premise that he has not done before that his fans would have reason to celebrate. This review is based on the 130 minute film released in Asia, I have heard that another cut of the film was debuted internationally.

1930s China. Ip Man (Tony Leung) is a rich, young martial arts master who does not want to compete and yet he finds himself thrust into the limelight as his peers push him into a sparring match with Chinese Martial Arts chairman Gong Yutian (Wang Qingxiang). The match was more technical than a display of skills as Ip Man asserts his inner will to get the best of Yutian. As a result, Yutian's daughter, Gong Er (Zhang Ziyi)  who is also a master in her own right of the 64 hands, issues a challenge to Master Ip as to restore her family's reputation. The two spar in a flow of rhythmic movements that almost looked like poetry. This is only the first few minutes of the film, as Wong Kar-Wai co-wrote the screenplay to include certain periods in Ip Man's life. If life has four seasons, then the first 20 years is spring, but then his life takes a turn to winter during the Sino-Japanese war.

Wong Kar-Wai intentionally made the film to feel rather convoluted and episodic. Perhaps in an effort to express his themes and metaphors, and to cover as much of Ip Man's life as best he could. Wong does not primarily takes his focus on Master Ip's life, but rather he brings into the fold the way each period was in his life and how certain people have influenced his life both directly and indirectly. The writing in the film was definitely trying to bring forth the concept as to how the teachings of martial arts could be applied to the living of one's life, as Tony Leung clearly elaborates in the first few minutes in the film; ""It is all about the horizontal and the vertical"". I take it that one is left standing while the other is laying down in martial arts. Such is something that could certainly be seen in life. One stands while the other lays down, perhaps one needs to learn how to lay down in order to stand, and also at a mirror image, one needs to learn to lay down in order to stand.

Wong Kar-Wai has some rather heavy themes going around here. There is much to take in the film, the dialogue is often filled with philosophical expressions and metaphors, but we all know that it is usually what a Wong Kar-Wai movie is all about. The characters in the film move about its themes, and while its structure felt a little loose, the resonance for each of them is pretty crystal clear. Ma San (Zhang Jin) and Gong Er make choices that often feel that they were based on emotions such as pride, anger, honor and love. The theme of vengeance that comes with the two, was something that keeps them from fully reaching the peak of kung fu. This brings into its narrative as to there are three levels that signify the highest achievement in martial arts: ""being, knowing and doing."" This lesson comes from Master Gong to Ma San, and strongly expressed through Gong Er's life that she had taken a vow that kept her from becoming a wife and having children in order to avenge her father. Ma San and Gong Er chooses from a very straight-forward emotional level that chooses their destiny for them.

Now, Master Ip also has potential for all these emotions, but he is more passive. His approach to life is a more peaceful one, as his love for Gong Er remained inside and that such a thing could not be in the past. Master Ip is married to Wing Sing (Song Hye-Kyo in a limited screen time) while Gong Er was engaged. Ip Man choose to rise above such desires and ambition, that he approaches life from a less than aggrandizing path. There is a subtle subversive message around its narrative, and yet it sees things from a humanist point of view. Life has its regrets, and yet, here, it is not something that drives its narrative but merely a consequence. Wong places the film's priorities on the world around the individual rather than what the individual does to the world.

As with Wong Kar-wai's usual style, the film is very lush and a little pretentious. This is not a negative comment, but rather something that I have just grown to be fond of when it came to Wong's films. Wong uses slow-motion with overblown art direction and redolent details to bring the power, the beauty and the flair of the martial arts. All angles were utilized to display the moves and even some close ups to bring forth its effects and intensity. It is a true visual feast but I could've done without the `fighting in the rain' since it had been done so much in other films. The cinematography and the atmosphere of the film fit just should be expected of Wong Kar-Wai; this is after all a style all his own and what made him the renowned filmmaker that he is today.

The screenplay in ""The Grandmaster"" is pretty strong, and yet it does not come with some issues. I mean, I know this is meant as a biopic, but one is left to wonder if this is Ip Man as seen through his eyes, or is it Master Ip as seen through Wong's viewpoint? I know the film's intentions was a less than fictional one, but really, it feels a little unfocused at times. The script takes some detours that I thought unnecessary, I was a little dumbfounded how a nationalist agent turned ass-kicking barber called ""the Razor"" could've made a good device to further Ip Man's transitions and yet he was only in three scenes. Chang Chen's the Razor was shamelessly used and felt like a `filler' since the film could've gotten along fine without him. I also thought that the narrative played a little too heavy on Zhang Ziyi's character rather than its supposed main protagonist.

""The Grandmaster"" could've easily been called ""The Grandmasters"" as in the plural form. It feels little unfocused to be a biopic on Master Ip, and truth be told, its messages could've easily been delivered in a film by any other director about a martial artist's journey experiencing the same things in the world. Tony Leung does a great job as the lead, as he felt a little smug and yet, tempered. Stoic, yet filled with emotions. His performance was certainly better than Donnie Yen's. It was also great to see Zhang Ziyi to once again do her thing; she was elegant, beautiful and graceful as always. Despite some flaws, ""The Grandmaster"" is a good film that deals with piety, humility and humanist ideas, and rather than using love as a driving force, it is a mere upshot.  It is about just what it means to stand upright, that how one chooses the right path is often the one left standing. This message is truly complete and grown-up that this film gets a High Recommendation from me. [4  Out of 5 Stars]",1383350400,,7890,4.487465181058496

The movie starts with a big fight scene between Master Ip Man and a huge group of guys. I didn't like how it was filmed at all. Either: too blurry, too close, too slow. Add to that they never told us why they were fighting. I thought the movie would be about Ip Man and showcase his life and arts better. It seemed like he was a side character and the movie was about the character Gong Er (daughter of the retired Grandmaster). She had the best fight scene at the train station and seemed to be more fleshed out than anyone else in the whole movie. They hinted at some interest between the two, but never crossed the actual line with it. Then again, he had a wife and kids that he left somewhere, never to be seen again.

So if one wants a more complete version of The Grandmaster, then one would have to buy both versions.  The director, Wong Kar Wai, is never finished in terms of editing the film.

5708039,5,B00C9G22R2,"Beloved and lovely Northern Chinese - if you want to see why the Southerners light up with their visits, see this movie.  All of their integrity and moral NOBILITY is on display here in the performances of Zhang Ziyi and the rest of the Mainland actors here.  I have the original cut but I WISH there was a Director's Cut with all the missing scenes tantalizingly reported in the Chinese press.  The Southern Barbarians LOVE the Northern Han.

In my double disc version, the features offer a computer graphic of the map of China with the names of the different participating regions appearing in brush strokes and as they appear, I realized that this is the hint of the united front of all the provinces, all the clans, all the socalled ""ethnicities"" of the Chinese united against the Japanese invasion.

The story looks like the moving of Chinese kungfu ever Southward until it reaches the haven of British-controlled Hong Kong.  It doesn't make any sense/profit that they are all on the same street in Hong Kong if you don't wonder if these are all Japanese guerrilla fighters.

The wife of Ip Man is played by a famous South Korean actress the casting of which despite her lack of lines indicates the Chinese position on Korean women in contrast to that of enemy Japan.  She actually has very similar underlying facial structure to Zhang Ziyi but the exterior is different.

The Southern natives will never secede from The Greater Whole.  The Yuet people welcome the Han; all doors are open to them even without undeserved honors like the title of Grandmaster.  It's on the house just like the Southern pronunciation of poon choi and that is why every emperor worth his salt spent at least 90% of the national budget on building and reinforcing The Great Wall.

If you like puns, Foshan sounds like volcano in Cantonese and the Mandarin pronunciation of Dongbei sounds like ""east evades"" more so than ""cold and sad"" in Cantonese.  Curiously, Ip Man's given name ""Man"" means ""question"" in Chinese so his name is Leaf Question(s).  What is he asking?

When the Accounts Department greet Ip Man 26 minutes, I am reminded because I do need to be reminded that on the matter of Namibia alone, the monsters will pay and it will be by the hand of a precise and just hatred with no silliness.  Why was Michael Jackson a Jehovah's Witness if not because they shared the same murderer as the Namibians?

SPOILER:

the fight between ZZY and Ip Man resulted in a fair win because ZZY showed at least twice that she was willing to die/fail fighting and if Ip Man had responded unchivalrously, he would have been defeated thoroughly down the road - according to Chinese rules, Ip Man had no other choice than to act as he did.

ETA 5/11/2014:  the existence of the Japanese Genyosha (see the wikipedia entry) creates a different view of this film.  The Northern successor becomes a collaborator.  The Southern one to his and his own family's fatal peril refuses while everyone all around him seems to have no problem with doing so.  The proceedings take place at a brothel in the beginning of the film, in the best brothel and the genyosha were known to have set up high end brothels to gather intelligence on wealthy and empowered locals.

So they would have known everything.  They would have known about Zhang Ziyi's character as well as Ip Man's.

No privacy indeed.

So no sympathy for all the alleged suicides occuring amongst the corrupt officials today.  If the central government does not fix this problem, they become the rest of the world's problem.

5708046,3,B00C9G22R2,"Wong Kar-wai writes and directs The Grandmaster, starring Tony Leung Chiu-Wai as the legendary Wing Chun martial artist, Yip Man (or Ip Man).  The film chronicles the life of the man most well-known for training the legendary Bruce Lee - taking place mostly during the 1930s.  However, long before he trained Lee, Yip Man lived a once peaceful life with a wife and children.  But, when a grandmaster, Gong Yutian (Wang Qingxiang), retires, a martial arts civil war breaks out between North and South China. Yip Man is chosen to represent his country in the South, eventually defeating the master, which prompts his daughter, Gong Er (Zhang Ziyi) to reclaim her family's honor by facing-off against Ip Man.  The two are intrigued with one another, and attempt to stay in contact.  Eventually, the Japanese invade China and force him to abandon his comfortable life, choosing to face down a life of poverty and become a martial arts teacher.  Chang Chen, Zhao Benshan, and Song Hye-kyo also star in supporting roles.

To be honest, this is a film that will try your patience as a movie lover in more ways than one.  Since this is a Chinese film, the film is completely subtitled (that's not a knock, just a vital piece of information that you should be prepared for, especially if subtitles aren't your cup of tea).  Aside from the subtitles, this is a film that bounces around quite a bit as a great deal of information is covered and interpreted in a relatively short amount of time (depending which cut of the film you see - since there are three).  The film focuses mainly on Ip Man, but also intertwines with Gong Er - portrayed by the emotionally-engaging Zhang Ziyi.  From the get-go, The Grandmaster describes how each martial artist uses his or her own fighting techniques, often incorporating more than one style - and adapt it to their own.  This vital information (seeming irrelevant at times) is vital to the overall understanding of these historical figures.  In the event that you're not familiar with martial arts (and I'll happily admit I was pretty clueless), this film can be unexpectedly difficult to follow.

Admittedly, The Grandmaster can quickly lose your attention with its scattered plot and quick movements, and it's understandable if you end up checking your watch a few times.  But, just when you think it's lost its way - the martial art action kicks in to save this film from the abyss.  In fact, the opening sequence is by far the most enjoyable sequence of the film as Yip Man quickly squares off against an endless amount of ""bad guys"" - in the rain, no less.  It will quickly feel reminiscent of the fight sequence between Neo and Agent Smith in The Matrix: Revelations - only without the endless amount of buildings being destroyed.  Regardless, this sequence is a wonderful piece of choreography (as is the entire film), which highlights the attributes of the film's star - Tony Leung Chiu-Wai.  Ip Man is portrayed as a cool, calculating, and absolutely confident in his skills - all of which are lightning quick, not to mention lethal.

The most outstanding element of this film (behind the acting of Tony Leung) is the soundtrack, composed by Shigeru Umebayashi, Nathaniel Mchaly and Stefano Lentini.  With so many different details in modern films, the music has lost a great deal of recognition - unless it includes a big name musician singing a song at the end of the credits.  It seems to be a rarity that music score stands out, but in this case, the music sets the tone for this film.  From the Chinese opera to the exquisite themes throughout, the music contributes the constant shift in mood and tone.  Most film scores are simply average, but this particular film thrives largely because of such an emotional musical composition - so much so that it wouldn't be the worst idea to add this soundtrack to your music collection (assuming you're into classical music).

Over the years, there have been several interpretations of Ip Man's life, including a handful of popular films, including Ip Man, and Ip Man 2 - not to mention several TV projects.  This film focuses on the intertwining characters that defined the important moments of Ip Man's life.  Thankfully, it balances dramatic turmoil with a significant amount of action - which should be enough to attract causal fans of martial art combat.  Although the film is choppy and quick paced (from year to year), it has the ability to briefly enlighten movie-goers about the man responsible for training an entire generation of martial artists - one of which is Bruce Lee.  However, Lee's characterization in this film is brief and only as a child, so those hoping to see that portion of Ip Man's life will be disappointed.  Regardless, if this film had to be described by using only one word, the word would be elegant.  And, if nothing else - The Grandmaster will show you the importance of a button (yes, a button).

What's not: Plot, lack thereof. A meandering sequence of events isn't a plot.

5708048,1,B00C9G22R2,"I went to the premier of this movie with my kung fu classmates and Sifu. The movie starts with Sifu Ip surrounded by a group of thugs in the middle of the night during a rainstorm. The fight begins, we are given no reason as to why this is happening its just ready GO. Right away I notice the scenes are very cinematic with lots of abrupt cuts and angles followed by, what I feel, an overuse of slow motion scenes. At one point a fighter and Sifu Ip takes turns kicking a carriage at each other kicking it so hard until they crunch it like a soda can. There's also a lot of punching you so hard i send you flying 50 feet and take out the 5 guys trying to catch you. The fight ends with Ip-Man as the victor. Its at this point that I start to worry about the film. Wing Chun is known for its great speed not crushing power so already the movie is inaccurate to the style.

What follows are very disjointed scenes with very little exposition other than narration. If I had not seen both Ip-Man 1 and 2 I would have no idea what had happened given the small amount of exposition given. We jump from his family home, to a forced move to hong kong, to him opening his school, etc. Years pass in between these scenes leaving you with a lack of sense of whats going on. For some inexplicable reason the last third of the movie focuses on a different character all together and Ip doesnt even show up. The ending felt very abrubt and it felt like the director said ""oh crap I didn't show Ip-man for the last thrid of the movie"" so he procedes to smash clips from all of his very short fight scenes in the last minutes.

The movie suffers from very poor execution in my view. Scenes feel very disjointed with little exposition as to where we are or why something is happening. As one reviewer has mention this is more Asian film art than it is an action martial arts movie. The film also for some reason focuses more heavily in the Baguazhang style than the Wing Chun style that Master Ip is known for.

If you're looking for an action movie along the lines of the Donnie Yen's films you will be sorely disappointed. If on the other hand you are looking for a more historical cinematic experience then this may be more to your liking.",1378339200,3,2225,4.21830985915493
5708049,1,B00C9G22R2,"Grandmaster is a poor excuse for a documentary. The movie scenes jump from one
place to another with no smooth flow. The entire movie is dark and most of the
fighting occurs indoors with poor lighting, or outdoors at night in the rain.
So you don't really get a clear idea of the moves they are using.
Most of the time the characters are communicating to each other by using
Chinese proverbs. So you sit there trying to figure out what the proverb means,
while missing the responding proverb. Very frustrating to watch. What makes
the movie even worse is that it's boring! I walk out of the movie. 0-stars!",1378252800,3,606,4.5181818181818185
5708050,4,B00C9G22R2,"The cinematography was worth the price of admission alone, and I can honestly say that this film was a study in creativity and the beauty in each movement.  For the first half of the movie, there was almost a  meditative quality in every action.  About half way through the film, when the Sino-Japanese war starts, the movie becomes a bit of a downer...  which of course can be life and war; but if you like happy movies, this might not be the flick for you.  There was another comment I read where it noted that about 20 minutes of the film was cut out for American audiences.  After reading what was cut, I would say that it was integral to the plot and should have been kept.  Without knowing what was missing from the film, the depth of the relationship between Ip Man and Gong Er doesn't make a heck of a lot of sense.  (The edited version makes it seem like one of those old movies where the boy and girl have one dance and all of a sudden they're in love.)  So if you watch knowing that, it will help make the movie a little less confusing.  Overall, I found this to be an interesting and insightful look into the ravages of conflict and the humanity of people who are esteemed as masters.  This is one of those movies that kind of gets to you at your core and makes you think about life. So, if you're looking for pure escapism and fun, you most likely will not enjoy this movie.  Also, it has subtitles, so if subtitles aren't your thing, you might not enjoy this film.  But, if you are in the mood for something less ""entertaining"" in a modern sense of the word, and instead a slower moving, deeper experience, than you will walk away feeling it was well worth it.",1377907200,2,1674,4.276190476190476

5708052,5,B00C9G22R2,"Make no mistake, when a film is directed by Wong Kar Wai (""2041""), it will be artistic no matter what audience expectations may be. Naturally he includes martial arts, but as we already know, most martial art films depend heavily on visual and audio editing. Remember ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" with the gravity-defying action? There is a bit of that here as well. But the visual editing is perfection: each scene is framed with loving care and a careful eye.

The film is loaded with Eastern aphorisms which floated in one ear and out the other, although I liked the one about two martial elements: horizontal and vertical. If you are vertical at the end of a bout... you won. Even I can understand THAT one!

Along with the visual excellence I always expect from this director, I had the pleasure of watching two of my favorite Asian actors:
  * Tony Leung (""In the Mood for Love"") is Ip Man, our martial arts master who, after fundamental changes and loss in his life, eventually ends up in Hong Kong and establishes the school where Bruce Lee trains.
  * Ziyi Zhang (""Memoirs of a Geisha"") is Gong Er, the gifted daughter of a martial arts grandmaster who had the misfortune to be born female. She is the master of a specialized school of martial arts but swears to never disclose her secrets.

If you have been lucky enough to see ""In the Mood for Love"" you know not to expect gunshots or sweaty bodies but you also know there will be an achingly poignant love story. The sound track has a touch of western music that we recognize, plus some eastern pieces, as well.

We see our star-crossed lovers as they and their families are caught up in the invasion of China by the Japanese, WW II and a sea change in the way Hong Kong is governed. We see starvation and cruelty, elegance and beauty, i.e., the full panoply of Far Eastern history in the mid-1900s.

And those actors are STILL two of my favorites! This will go in my collection from Amazon.",1377043200,4,1957,4.521246458923513
5708053,1,B00C9G22R2,"I will keep this review/opinion succinct.  Among viewers of Asian cinema, there exists hardcore martial arts fans and fans of cinematic Asian art-house. I consider myself a member of the former, so please keep that in mind as you read this review. Trailers for THE GRANDMASTER will mislead many martial arts fans into thinking that it is a kick-ass martial arts movie that adds to the developing canon of films depicting the life of Bruce Lee's teacher IP MAN. In actuality, this film is a sizable chunk of Asian art-house with an historical focus. IP MAN just happens to be one of the characters in the film.

Anyone looking for action and knockdown-dragout fights in the vein of Donnie Yen's IP MAN films will be devestatingly disappointed. The actions sequences in this film are very few, very scarce, and nothing at all spectacular. Not only is the IP MAN character absent from a large chunk of the film, but we are not even offered any kind of final epic fight at the end. None of the film's skirmishes are at all lengthy.

I am not an idiot who only watches wall-to-wall bloody action. I understand that this film was intended as historical and philosophical drama and high-end art--I understand that after having seen it. But had I known that from the start, I probably would not have bought this film at the WizardWorld comic book convention in Rosemont. I believe Director Martin Scorsese has agreed to officially present this film for American distribution, and given the type of historical and epic scope the film illustrates, I can see and understand Scorsese's appreciation of its beauty. I am not a hater of the arts and I certainly recognize that this film was not intended to be a Shaw Brother-type of escapist action. However, the trailers present the film as exactly that, and I think many fans of the Shaw Brothers escapist fun--such as myself, will feel very cheated after sitting through this film.

So to conclude, if you are into artsy foreign films, you may find much to love about this movie. But if, like me, you just want some great and spectacular, death-defying battles, with unbelievable stunts, bad dubbing and mad blue-screen effects, don't waste your time on this long, talky, forlorn flick.",1376784000,7,2224,4.798955613577023
5708054,4,B00C9G22R2,"First, I hope you find this review helpful from a U.S. fan of foriegn cinema.  I have a large collection of foriegn films with most of them originating in Asia, and this film moves into my top 10 of historical action / drama.  If you've haven't seen ""IP MAN"" 1-4, then I suggest watch those first before you  see a semi matserpiece like ""Grandmaster"".  You may see mixed reviews for GRANDMASTER, but that is due to martial arts actor Donnie Yen setting the bar so high for martial arts action in IP MAN 1&2.  IP MAN films 1&2 where higly inaccurate in regards to the history of Yip Man, but was quit entertaining due to the skills Donnie Yen executed on screen.  Wont talk to much about IP MAN 3&4 because you want to hear about GRANDMASTER, but they wereok films to watch.  GRANDMASTER had more then enough fignht seens in it to establish itself as a great martial arts film.  The fight scenes portray the proper artistic execution of kung fu, and do not shy of creativity.  The acting is executed with perfection, and i really didn't expect it.  The only issue I have with the film is that it seems to jump all over the place sometimes, but this is probably due to me watch the IP MAN series.

This was, incredibly, the first one that mentions he was the teacher of Bruce Lee, and it was the first I had seen with a romantic element. Typical of the director, the choreography and cinematography is artistic and there is some great, clean, clipped dialogue as well. It was fun to be given brief synopses of the different styles of martial arts and to learn more about this famous man, even if it was a bit romanticized, I'm sure. It was also nice to get the perspective of a very tough and admirable female character, the love interest, played by Zhang ZiYi, who finally grew on me - I usually find her too snobby, and she is in this too, but her character evolves very nicely into someone impressive and who elicits sympathy.
