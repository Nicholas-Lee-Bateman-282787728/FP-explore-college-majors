4830366,5,B005LVIP1E,"This is another classic western released by Timeless Media Group. They had released versions of this series before, but they were selected episodes from each season. Here they have released  the complete first two seasons. I hope they will release the rest. Another nice touch from this company it that they release these series in special embossed collectible tins which is very impressive. There is also an interview with Dale Robertson on this DVD.This is a well known western so I won't go into detail about the show. But I would like to say that I am enjoying watching this series once again. Action-packed all the way. If you like westerns you'll like this. It's everything that a western should be.",1321747200,8,705,4.8264462809917354
4830367,2,B005LVIP1E,"I was wondering which episodes of Wells Fargo would be included in this new set from Timeless Media.
Having now gone to their web site, where all the episodes are detailed, I regret to advise that,as far
as I can tell, 39 of them are included in the 6 disc set that Timeless produced in 2009 under the title
of The Best of the First Five Seasons.

This is a great pity because I was considering buying this new set. It appears that you are only getting
13 new episodes (apart from the tin box that they come in).

I will let any prospective purchaser decide whether this new edition is worth it, if they already own the
previous set.",1321315200,60,633,4.266666666666667

First season really consisted of 13 seasons, the second season has 38 Episodes. I presently have what is offered as considered the whole series. The Show was on from 1957-1962 consisting of 200 episodes. Would like to know if they will actually update what was actually shown and put on DVDs."" Wells Fargo"" is presently being shown on the western channel, so what I don't already have, I have to watch the originals on that channel! This is one of the best Western series and holds it's on amongst the others. Just thought some would like to know.

The stories are narrated individual vignettes, some stronger than others, but all enjoyable.  Guest appearances by budding stars such as Michael Landon, Dan Blocker, James Coburn, Lee Van Cleef, and others, add to the flavor of the series.

4830457,3,B005LVIP1E,I give this 3 stars not because of the videos themselves but because of the case they came in. I bought this as a gift and when I received it the two inner dvd holders were snapped off the case so they were loose in transit. I watched each dvd to make sure there was no damage but then not being able to replace the case I ended up putting each dvd into a paper sleeve and putting those in the tin.  Good thing I had the tin or there wouldn't have been a way to present them to the recipient.  Other than that the shows themselves are great.,1417824000,8,541,3.9541284403669725

4830475,4,B005LVIP1E,"This order Came with Two (2) sets of 52 episodes Season 1 and 2. Most buyers usually do not get 2 sets of the same identical
season 1 and 2. I know I purchased them this way thinking that 2 sets one was Season  (1)the other was Season 2. Was their a reason for this and charging more for identical sets. I do have the other sets of ""Tales of Wells Fargo"", more or less completing the
Complete Series. Just thought I would relate this back to you in case some other buyers found the same thing.
Otherwise I still i still enjoy this Western series. Also because I was a postal carrier for the US Postal service for 20 years and I had
the opportunity to deliver and meet Dale Robertson at his Mothers home at that time in Northwest Oklahoma City, Ok. That would
have been approximately 25 years ago.",1387497600,2,796,4.2368421052631575

4830477,5,B005LVIP1E,"I have never been a fan of the TV western. I've tried, but it just didn't cick with what I consider enjoyable entertainment. One morning, I saw a show on MeTV called ""The Tales of Wells Fargo"" and thought they clearly struck the bottom of the barrell. I mean cimbining the TV Western with a show about ""shipping"" - I actually watched to see how bad this was going to be. THEN I WATCHED MY FIRST EPISODE...AND I WAS ABSOLUTELY HOOKED!!!!!! This show is incredible. I immediately subscribed for all the shows airing on MeTV and watched in utter glee. What a fantastic show! What agreat idea to combine the classic TV western with a show about shipping the gold from the rush in CA.

When MeTV switched line-ups, Wells Fargo was left off the schedule. I immedately ran to my computer and ordered this collection of the first two seasons - 52 episodes in all. My only complaint is, like the gold miners, I want more!!!!!!! What about the remaining seasons????",1385769600,7,955,4.5523255813953485

Reality programs?  Absolute trash.  I am 51 years old and too young to have seen ""Tales of Wells Fargo"" 'when it originally aired, but the black and white show is more entertaining to me today than 99 percent of the product they produce on broadcast or cable.

I watched this show as a kid, and in fact went on to rob a stage coach my self playing Charlie MacLeod in the tv Pilot
""Eyes of a Cowboy"" in 1997.  I have a 4 up team of black draft cross geldings that work in the movies. So the stage coach and the horse action are right up my alley",1359331200,12,399,3.7951807228915664

4830495,5,B005LVIP1E,"As one other reviewer has already mentioned most of the episodes have already appeared in the best of... series. For me though, it was worth the $28 to get the rest of the episodes.  Some of which interestingly, have a different theme music. Memory tells me neither are original, then again I haven't trusted my memory in a long time :-).

The show itself is enjoyable and brings back memories.  The stories usually hold up well, character development is as good as I reckon can be done in 25 minutes and I like the way some of the ""baddies"" of the old west are given a different perspective. They become real people, not just vilified cardboard cut outs.

I cannot finish without mentioning how I do love the tire tracks seen on the road in some of the head on shots :-), Jim Hardie's ability to shoot from the hip and the nifty tin the set comes in, it adds to the charm.",1335052800,5,873,4.337423312883436

8478657,5,B005LVIP1E,"Great first two seasons of Wells Fargo. Dale Robertson (Jim Hardie) is at his most prime as a man, an actor and a star. Seasons 3 - 5 are also good, but they're not out on DVD, yet. Strong western stories and tight-knit suspense. Acting is first-rate with Jim and a host of recognizable TV and movie stars. Also watch the series on StarzEncore (a.k.a. the Western channel).",1517961600,6,373,4.5
