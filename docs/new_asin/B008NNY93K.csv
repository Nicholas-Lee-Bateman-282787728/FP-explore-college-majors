5170718,1,B008NNY93K,"Let me start by saying I love the mock documentary horror genre. I try to watch any movies of the genre I can get a hold of. While a lot of them copy off the few gems and even the copies are half way decent.

This one is absolutely awful. The special effects are just terrible if not non-existant. The video is a complete disappointment - shaking the cameras, spinning them around and hitting them to get them to de-digitize to mock them running around and being scared. If you have seen even one or two horror movies your not likely to get scared at all during this entire movie. This movie is more about three people acting like children and trying to scare each other.

A most challenging thing about this movie is trying to sit through the entire thing. Save your money and watch grave encounters - its very similar and a lot better made. These guys should be ashamed of themselves for making this piece of garbage.

I would give this a zerp or maybe half a star but I had to give it one.",1359936000,,992,4.26595744680851
5170719,1,B008NNY93K,This was the worst horror movie I have ever seen in my life. I love horror movies. I have over 2000 in my collection. The story had such a great potential and was wasted on this director and his crew. The cast did their best with the worst director and crew ever. Sadly the movie should be redone with a real director and a crew that actually knows how to shoot a movie. This one is a waste of time and money!,1353542400,2,409,4.0
5170720,1,B008NNY93K,"i must say i was looking forward to this movie, but after watching it, i realized i should of just burned my eyes out with a cig. nothing happens within the whole movie except some so called shadows that look like cardboard cutouts, and the ending doesnt show or tell you anything about y what happend there did. the the so called actors/co writers where so annoying i wanted something to happen to them. if you must watch it, just rent it,",1352764800,,440,4.378048780487805
8529202,3,B008NNY93K,"This was OK at most.

Obviously the directors father would play a small role in this which is Oliver stone. That was a tiny Easter egg basically.

The sousaphone man plays an incredible role. Any time something even slightly scary happens his musical score plays a wild tone. Gets really annoying really fast.

And they kept up with the weird flashbacks to historical documents way too much early on.

Scary environment. I guess.",1513987200,,429,4.835616438356165
8529203,1,B008NNY93K,"I couldn't watch it. I heard everything, I just could never look at the screen. I've never gotten so motion sick on a boat. Between the constant strobe lighting and the camera never being still, I was dizzy and sick to my stomach the entire time. Somebody should have put a seizure risk warning somewhere. My only consolation, was that I saw this pile of crap for free, so I'm not out any money.",1501459200,,395,4.351351351351352
8529204,5,B008NNY93K,oh man this is the best found footage film ever made a must see for all horror fans,1417132800,,83,3.6666666666666665
8529205,5,B008NNY93K,This movie was great! Definitely a different direction than most movies involving Mental Institutions. Kept me on my toes and had me jumping.,1394841600,,141,5.173913043478261
8529206,2,B008NNY93K,"I'm going to keep this short.  Three friends decide to spend the night exploring the supposedly local haunted hot spot, this one being an abandoned lunatic asylum, and scary stuff goes down.

That pretty much sums it up.  Famed director Oliver Stone's son Sean takes the helm as co-writer, director, and co-star in his first movie.  His father, whom I suspect is the only way this movie got made in the first place, even has a cameo playing himself in the beginning.

While its not the scariest movie to come out, Greystone Park kept my interest throughout it's short run time.  Overall the movie was a decent effort but you won't be missing out on anything if you decide to put it back on the shelf.  In fact, it seems vaguely like it's trying to be an artsy remake of the more superior Grave Encounters.  The actors play themselves ala The Blair Witch Project and there are enough surprisingly startling images that pop up on screen that add to a fairly realistic feel to the movie.  The main problem I had was that you never get to know the three leads so you simply don't care what happens to them.  We get that Antonella and Sean have a thing for one another but you've got to ask yourself why?  She's pretty but she's such a dull Mary Sue character.  He's good looking but he talks in such a condescending manner to the people around him that are supposed to be his friends that it makes him come across as just another spoiled Hollywood brat coasting on Daddy's successful coattails.

Despite my misgivings, I recommend it maybe for a late night watch if you have nothing better to do.  Just be prepared to be scratching your head at the ending.  Trust me, it makes absolutely no sense.",1386115200,,1693,4.4869281045751634
8529207,3,B008NNY93K,"I ordered this movie knowing about the bad reviews, but wanted to see it anyway. To me the acting wasn't all that bad and from a scale of 1 to 10, I give a 5 just for the acting itself. The reason I ordered this movie is because I like horror movies dealing with abandon mental hospitals. But I was disappointed with the camera shots and it constantly moving and shaking where you can't get a good look inside the hospital. I thought the movie was filmed entirely inside Greystone Hospital and I found out it wasn't. Another reason I ordered the movie is because Greystone is in danger of being demolish and there is a group trying to save and preserve it. I have to say other abandon mental hospitals movies like Grave Encounters and Session 9 is better than this one.",1381276800,,769,4.384615384615385
8529208,2,B008NNY93K,"Greystone Park follows Sean Stone, Alex, and as they enter the Greystone Psychiatric Hospital to find evidence of shadow people. With only a few spooky scene, Greystone Park is ultimately held back by found footage clich&eacute;s.

Greystone Park has a very familiar story; a group of friends decide to visit a haunted mental hospital to find ghosts. There are a few scenes in the film that are creepy thanks to the setting and the use of shadows - sometimes you'll see a ghostly figure in a subtle manner. I think I creeped myself out more than the actual film did most of the time. Eventually, the film turns into a clich&eacute; found-footage mess. A lot of running from things we can't see, a lot of loud noises, a lot of shouting. Much of the film consists of choppy/shaky camera work and malfunctioning footage, so you rarely see anything scary. Considering Sean Stone plays Sean Stone in this film, you'd expect him to be a bit better at handling a camera, or at least have better equipment - then again, I've never recorded a ghosts, so maybe they do mess with the footage? The acting was okay from the cast; they play very generic insane people at times and very plain regular people during others, save for Alex Wraith who did a better job.

Overall, Greystone Park can be a spooky experience, if you haven't grown tired of the haunted hospital found-footage films. The film probably would've been more entertaining and frightening as a documentary. As of 5/13/13, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, a rental is recommended for fans of the genre, purchase with caution.

Greystone Park has some blood and violence.",1368662400,,1634,4.76678445229682
8529209,1,B008NNY93K,"Folks, don't waste your money buying this or your time watching it. The entire movie was dark, you see no action, you only hear the thrillers, its just no good! BOTTOM LINE!!! I didn't even wanna give it 1 star.",1363651200,,211,4.3
8529210,1,B008NNY93K,"First to say, I am peruvian. Normally in Peru, people love all kinds of horror movies even if they are complete failures. Recently, this movie came out with the title ""presencias paranormales"" (paranormal presenses) and went to watching this movie on a full theater, everyone of us hoping to be scared and entertained. This movie achieves none of them. Instead, we received a movie so nule, so dark, so boring, that we all agreed that this was indeed the worst horror movie we've ever seen. At the end, the whole crowd started ""boo""ing in the theater. I think even louder than when you americans booed at the film ""the devil inside"" (although that film is one of the top horror films ever made in Peru).

As you can imagine, we normally like good and bad horror movies because most of them are quite entertaining.
But this is the one movie were everyone from all over the world will start talking about how bad it is.

Leave it as it never happened.",1360195200,3,949,4.543859649122807
