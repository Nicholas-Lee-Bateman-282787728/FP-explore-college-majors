4689691,5,B005G815S2,"This is a touching movie.

Hutto reveals how Turkey's and Nature can teach us true Love and Peace by being ""present"" in the moment.

You'll never eat another Turkey without thinking of ""Sweet Pea""!
Enjoy!",1321488000,7,204,4.8
4689692,5,B005G815S2,"Simply amazing. If you have any affinity for birds or wildlife you will be entranced, as was our whole family as we watched this.",1321488000,11,129,4.416666666666667
4689693,5,B005G815S2,"What a wonderful, moving story of a man truly communing with nature. I loved how he instantly knew he was to be the mother of these little turkeys as soon as they hatched, and he dedicated his life to the turkeys for as long as they needed him. I was amazed at how the turkeys seemed to have a group concencus about when it was time to roost, leave the coop, and move on. For an even fuller picture of this story, read the book ""Illumination in the Flatwoods"". You'll love it!",1321488000,20,476,4.184782608695652
4689694,5,B005G815S2,"I'm also an artist and share Mr. Hutto's fascination with the wild turkey. Unfortunately my encounters with the world of turkeys have been too brief - sightings here and there while on hikes or driving through the countryside. Because of that I was really looking forward to viewing this program, and I'm so glad I did!

This is an amazing story and extremely well done. The cinematography is stunning, but the story is even better. I already knew that turkeys were pretty darn intelligent birds, but I had no idea of their innate intelligence...I had guessed that their behavior (including vocalizations) was learned from their parents. Not so - according to what Mr Hutto experienced, these birds are born/hatched with a wealth of knowledge already inside of them, from predator identification, to knowing what to eat and what to avoid, and something akin to a language (specific vocalizations that mean specific things).

This is a wonderful view of wild turkeys from someone who found a rare opportunity to step inside of their world and had the humility to observe and learn with an open mind.",1321488000,9,1098,4.92972972972973
4689695,5,B005G815S2,"Saw the first half of this program at a Nature 30th Anniversary celebration here in NYC and can recommend it based on what I saw. Mr. Hutto hatched 16 wild turkey poults from eggs he received and purposefully imprinted them as their mother, then spent over a year playing mother (turkey) hen to them from before dawn to full dark every day to the exclusion of all else in the deep woods in northern Florida. His book about this experience,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Illumination-in-the-Flatwoods-A-Season-with-the-Wild-Turkey/dp/B001O9CDKG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Illumination in the Flatwoods: A Season with the Wild Turkey</a>, was discovered by a British producer and RECREATED on film with an actor playing Mr. Hutto's part (who looks like Mr. Hutto) on a ranch in a different part of Florida. The overvoice speaks Hutto's descriptive words. The actor onscreen does not talk much, but occasionally makes turkey sounds as he learns the turkey lexicon. There is nothing fake about the recreation, least of all the young turkeys, and you cannot TELL it is a recreation, period. The cinematography is stunning and the story will captivate you. (You will understand why Ben Franklin wanted the turkey, not the eagle, to be the national bird!)

My own experience with a family of wild turkeys in South Dakota had already convinced me of a lot of behavior confirmed by this program. When I stopped my car near them at the side of the road, the family dashed through a hedge and up a hill towards the woods, except for one poult who missed his cue and got separated. He was running in a circle peeping his head off on my side of the hedge. Meanwhile the family waited on the hillside and called to him over and over. Eventually the poult dashed through the hedge and rejoined the family, and they fled into the woods together. When I described this behavior to Mr. Hutto he confirmed it as well as the type of peeps a poult would make under these circumstances.",1320710400,41,2009,5.069486404833837
4689696,5,B005G815S2,"Imagine that you can see the world as a bobcat sees it, or a deer. Professional naturalist Joe Hutto didn't imagine it, he lived it for a year with a flock of wild turkeys in north Florida, and they opened his eyes and heart to a new way to see the woodlands that he thought he knew so well.

4689702,5,B005G815S2,"I loved this video when I first saw it on PBS. So many points I related to; the cabin he lived in was much like the cabins at the girl scout camp I went to in Florida, the scenery was much like Florida where I grew up and roamed, my grandfather gave me three ducks when I was just over a year old and could hardly stand up and try to pet them. Since I had essentially imprinted on them, I have always been fond of all kinds of birds and gave in to my daughter when she brought home first doves, then a gosling, then a rescued duck, then three more ducks, then another gander and finally a raven.

I taught her to love all critters. I purchased this to show her and my grandchildren places similar to where I grew up and some of the gentle ways one could feel about a turkey... like we felt about Gozzy Ganderling Whitefeathers, the gosling she brought home. A year in a similar cabin and location alone observing nature appeals to me. A nice fantasy.",1485907200,,950,4.163043478260869

It is more than a chronicle of the life of turkey chicks with one man.  It reminds me of the 60's book Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.  It is both engaging and informative.

DOMESTICATED TURKEYS: These are not attributes but symptoms. These symptoms are not just simply due to a difference in the breed. It is because we have aggressively engineered domestic turkeys to point of deformity.
1. They weigh twice as much because industry-bred birds have unusually large breasts (so the sellers can make more money). These severe abnormalities have caused serious health problems such as, collapsed lungs, swollen joints, crippled feet and heart attacks.
2. They cannot fly and are ""poor runners"" because we have engineered their breasts to be so disproportionate with the rest of their bodies that they have trouble running, standing, and even walking, as for mating -- these turkeys rely on artificial insemination for reproduction (you don't even want to know that process).
3. They are ""noisier"" because they begin life hatched in incubators, have their upper beaks and toenails clipped without anesthetics, and spend their days and nights eating fortified meal and antibiotics in a barn full of hundreds of turkeys-so packed, most cannot even spread their wings. Industry turkeys are abnormally fast growing, and by the time they're 12 weeks old, they're shipped off to the slaughterhouse. Their vocalizations are stress related-as they are still infants.
4. Their feathers are white because the follicle of the feathers are less visible on the carcass and it is less offensive to those cooking them. Thanks Anna Fiona.",1417132800,2,2047,5.823333333333333

4689766,5,B005G815S2,"Okay, this sure doesn't sound like an appealing DVD, for what on earth could be interesting about wild turkeys?  But Hutto's patience is extraordinary and despite what seems like wasted time, it turns out that the guy is actually a scientist (he follows this up by living for seven years with a mule deer population).  And before long, you find that his observations are quite captivating (for one, turkeys seem to instinctively know what to --and not to-- eat, avoiding poisonous insects and predators, while gobbling down other spiders with haste).  In one scene, the baby turkeys immediately sense the difference between a long dead harvested tree and one which has fallen naturally.  And once time moves on, so does nature as one by one, the turkeys leave ""mom"" to move onward, sometimes showing little mercy at this now-competitor for dominance.  Hutto is stunned, as are we, at the complexity of what we thought was so simple an animal.  If you want ONE crash course in understanding the wild, take a peek at this, for this is NOT a one hour glimpse of an animal's life filmed by National Geographic, but rather a time-consuming year taken from birth to adulthood AMONG an animals' life.

It is the first-person presentation of the story of a Naturalist, living in northern Florida, who was interested in the natural life and habits of the wild turkeys that were native to his area.  The film goes through all aspects of the steps required for him to gain the insight that he was trying to achieve, from the point of how to handle the eggs and steps needed to get them to hatch; to making sure that he was there when they hatched, to be sure that the chicks bonded with and accepted him as their ""mother;"" and then to fully taking on the role of the chicks' surrogate parent; up until their adulthood and separation.

4689814,5,B005G815S2,"Are wild turkeys sentient?

This is an impressive documentary film based on a true story of a man who raised sixteen wild turkeys who had to play mother to them so much so that he had to learn wild turkey language such as cluck, purr, cackle, putt, cutt and yelp including their varied intonations.

Joe was also surprised and astonished at the concept of loyalty, instinct, sixth sense, and sovereignty in the presence of the illusion of time these wild animals exhibit, for instance among other displays of cellular intuition the creatures are able to distinguish between a poisonous snake and those who are harmless.

Interestingly Hutto discovered the turkeys' noticeable independence from the limitations of time that humans are subjected to: apparently since they are not constrained by clocks, watches and calendars those wild turkeys live in the NOW enjoying, and this is serious and important, the moment without worries about a possible future.

This brings up other questions of the possibility most animals and plants might have a totally dissimilar concept regarding the illusion of time. In addition telepathy among themselves, other animals, and with humans was definitely corroborated with this important experiment.

Are wild turkeys sentient? This well done research has proved, in my opinion, that they in fact are sentient.

I recommend this great documentary to all especially nature and animal lovers.",1377907200,,1423,5.274336283185841

They both liked it and said that it was really interesting how the man was able to make the baby turkeys imprint on him, and how much time he took raising and protecting them. They liked how he stayed out in the woods with his babies.  They also got a kick out of the baby turkeys playing with a young fawn. They even said that the man ate what the turkeys ate, so be warned!!! Could be gross.

But this is a true story so there is death. Not all of the young turkeys survive but Mama and Daddy said that the deaths were handled well. This is a re-enactment, I think, so I guess the turkeys that died were 'actors'. And the ending was a little sad when the man meets one of the grown toms for the last time.

4689849,5,B005G815S2,"This came on our local PBS station a while back under the Nature shows.  It was so interesting, I immediately ordered it for a Christmas Gift.  When the person saw the title, the whole room exploded laughing, but when I got their attentnion and gave them a brief synopsis of what it is about, their attention mood changed.

This is a naturalist who had someone leave a clutch of wild turkey eggs on his porch and he read up on everything about the subject, and when they hatched he literally became their ""mom"" leading them into the forrest.  However he ended up learning more than he taught, from them.  He lived with them 24/7 to protect them until grown  after he lost one chick to a snake.

He named them, and his favorite female was Sweet Pea, which also happens to be the name of my daughter's female cockateel.  That caught her attention.  She had company coming in, so waited till they were there to watch it, and she also said it is a fantastic work.

I was telling my teacher in the late 50's about the film, and she said they do not have PBS in central Ohio on their T V, so I then ordered another copy of this film to send to her.

This is very highly recommended by myself and my family.  Am glad it was available at an affordable price on Amazon.com  It always pays to check out their prices before purchasing something.",1356307200,,1334,4.330645161290323

4689852,5,B005G815S2,While this is a reinactment the story line is fascinating. A man raises a clutch of wild turkeys from eggs to when they take leave of him as their mother. The fascinating part about this story is that wild animals not associated with the clutch also treated the surrogate mother as a turkey and were not afraid to venture very close to him as he led his brood within the forest. I had taped this from TV on my DVR but wanted a real copy just in case my DVR ever failed. This is truly worth a yearly watch to understand and appreciate nature and the potential impact we as human can have on it.

4689854,5,B005G815S2,"This film convinced me to buy the ""Illumination in the Flatwoods"" book, and the book is wonderful, but the book is not a replacement for the DVD.  I own both for myself, and I am giving them as a set to my sister.

Like the ""Illumination"" book, ""My Life As A Turkey"" provides practical guidance for raising any bird and protecting them from their predators, and provides insight into the joys and heartaches of being close to feathered creatures.

The visual impact of watching these turkeys growing up and interacting with their environment is awe-inspiring.  For me, their expressions and vocalizations are so much like those of chickens, and the experience of raising them is so similar to that of raising chickens, that I would recommend this DVD to anyone raising chickens.  I especially recommend it for children and for those starting out in raising birds, in part because the inevitable deaths that occur in young flocks are handled sensitively and with respect.  I believe that provides a valuable guide for 4H, FFA, and other youngsters embarking on the care and raising of young animals in how to understand and manage their feelings about the animals in their care.

What you get in this film that I don't get from my chicken-raising experience is the close interaction of these turkeys with their natural environment, and a sense of the history of their interaction with nature and with us.",1355011200,,1403,4.869747899159663

Joe takes us through a journey with these intelligent and beautiful (yes beautiful) birds that keeps any animal lover glued to their seat.  This re-creation based on his wonderful book ""Illumination in the Flatwoods"" is a must see.  This DVD is a compliment to the book.  The story is one part scientific exploration into the life of wild turkeys and one part love as Joe finds himself emotionally ""falling"" for these exquisite and secrective creatures. Joe was only too aware that as the birds grew, the relationship would have to change and it did.  Joe was a very successful ""parent"" and it is apparent he will relish this experience throughout the years. I like to think that his young charges were also just as grateful to have Joe in their lives. There were some harsh realities to face along the way, life is not always kind nor fair.

I had assumed that turkeys would learn from their mother, but it turned out they knew the snakes to be aware of and the snakes that were nonthreatening.  They knew when it was time to roost in trees.  They knew which bugs to eat.  Joe Hutto was pleasantly surprised at how much he learned while living as a turkey mother.

4689863,2,B005G815S2,"First I read the book, then I wanted to see the story told in a different format.
The format of the DVD, a re-enactment, was dull and surface compared to the book.  The end of the DVD was confusing at best.  In the book, Hutto and Turkey Boy resolved their differences and eventually Turkey Boy drifted off into the woods to be a turkey among turkeys.  Hutto writes a beautiful epilouge that ends on a hopeful note.  The DVD ends with Hutto hitting Turkey Boy in the head with a stick and last sees the bird running (I presume in freaked out fear) into the woods never to be seen again, then the story just drops.  Boom. It's over.  Just this final violent interaction between human and bird, with human winning (gee, what's new, don't we always when it comes to Nature?).  It smacked of an unethical violation of trust. And ending on this note of violence was a bummer. A complete bummer.

If you really want to get a fully detailed, insightful and compassionate story about Hutto's life as a turkey, read the book, Illumination in the Flatwoods, and skip the DVD.",1334016000,14,1065,4.481865284974093

It is a truly entertaining and gorgeous work of film making, and the book is even better in its detail. Joe has a unusually poetic voice, and his appreciation of the natural environment and its wild inhabitants is profound in its nuanced understanding of the intricate and sophisticated relationship between wild animals and their habitat, but exuberant with sense of wonder that most of us lose after childhood. You feel as if you are experiencing the discovery of something amazing along with him as he recounts the surprise and bewilderment of each aspect of wild turkey life that his brood reveals during the year in which he was their surrogate mother/odd companion.

4689870,5,B005G815S2,"This documentary gave me a different perspective about turkeys in particular and animals in general.  Many people do not believe animals have feelings.  I am an animal lover and I believe all creatures have emotions, a God given purpose for their actions, various degrees of intelligence, and feel physical pain.  Since humans supposedly have the greater intellignce, we are not able to relate to the emotions, actions, and pain of other creatures.  The movie did a very good job of making you realize the human experience with animals is a wonderful thing.  The movie also helps one realize animals live in the moment and serve their part in nature as it is intended.  Joe Hutto's experience with the wild turkeys was a gift from God.

The cinematography is superb.  It does a good job of capturing Mother Nature and seeing the world through the eyes of a turkey.  I will watch this movie more than once.",1323734400,,905,4.75

You feel like you are part of it in a way, not just sitting in your house. The little turkeys have amazing personalities! And I don't know how Hutto was able to go through this all...it must have been both very difficult, exhausting and exhilaring! The experience of a lifetime. In recreating Hutto's feat, the people involved in it managed to make it feel ""real"", which couldn't have been easy, considering!

This helps convince me that science accompanied, complimented by artistic sensibilities, as practiced by such paradigms as Hutto, is more than any other ""ism"" or way our best guide into the future.

4689873,5,B005G815S2,"This is sort of a real life ""Fly Away Home"" in which newly-hatched turkeys, rather than geese, imprint on a human, in this case a wildlife artist named Joe Hutto. Actually, one interesting thing about the baby turkeys (called poults) was that they started communicating with Joe Hutto FROM INSIDE THEIR EGGS.  The film is relatively short, which I appreciated, because the excellent editing meant that each scene was truly engaging and packed with fascinating information about these phenomenally intelligent and impressive birds. As in ""The Wild Parrots Of Telegraph Hill,"" the bird-human bond becomes a major theme of the film and Hutto's relationships with a couple of the more human-oriented birds is as moving as anything I've seen along these lines. the scenery in this particular area is also very beautiful and the camera work captures it brilliantly. I really couldn't ask for more in a wildlife film. Anyone who watches this will surely never use the word ""turkey"" as a pejorative again.",1321574400,15,997,5.079268292682927
4689874,5,B005G815S2,"I'd like to reiterate that this film was not a documentary but a re-creation of events that took place in the late 1990s.

The photography was so beautiful and misty, that I was puzzled about how they were able to get such incredible shots until I did research and found out how they made the film.

And as incredible a story as it is, what is also equally remarkable is that wildlife photographer Jeff Palmer--the ""actor"" they used to portray wildlife artist/naturalist Joe Hutto--was also given a cache of eggs, and the hatchlings imprinted on him...and the filmmakers then followed the re-created, yet real-life growth and relationship that developed with Jeff Palmer as Joe Hutto.  So, you see?  This was not just a one-time thing that happened to Joe Hutto...this is something that can be created again and again with turkeys--and doubtless, other animals.  Proof of a strange, magical interconnectedness of all animal species.

I was so moved by this film and the obvious consciousness and sentience of the turkeys and the way they communicated not just with Jeff Palmer/Joe Hutto--but with each other and the other animals of the forest. Hearing their myriad and specific vocalizations, seeing their ability to learn and their pointed curiosity--was mind-blowing to me. Watching them puzzle over the remains of a dead turkey was like watching elephants hover their feet over bones in an elephant graveyard.  I couldn't get over how, well...HUMAN they seemed.

I am not a vegetarian, but after watching this film I don't think I'm too far off from never eating turkey again.  The vegetarians always say don't eat anything with a mother or a face, and after looking into the faces and eyes of the turkeys portrayed in this film, to kill and eat them to me would feel like killing and eating my beloved cats.  That last remark may sound extreme, but that's how wonderful a job the filmmakers did in re-creating Joe Hutto's experience.

In spite of some sad, brief scenes, there is no real blood or scary violence, and I highly recommend this film to people of all ages, from 9 on up.",1321574400,28,2087,4.834269662921348

some of them....Swee-pea, Turkey-Boy, and we care.....and it is magic....to see Joe Hutto's ""children"", soon grow, thrive, and eventually, outgrow their odd relationship with Joe, and ultimately, their natural wild behaviour. It is revealed towards the end, that all the communication, relationship bond, was perhaps a fortunate,or un-fortunate, temporary thing...........as the turkey dna clicks in and reminds them they ARE WILD, and the results are both sad and wonderfull, and very heartfelt......but filmed with respect and magic, for both , the wild turkeys, and their adoptive parent.
