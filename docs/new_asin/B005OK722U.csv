4852881,4,B005OK722U,"""Place your bets"" When a group of friends decide to have their bachelor party in Vegas they get more then the expected. For those that have seen the other two in the series you will pretty much know what to expect from this one. This one did have a different aspect to it that made it a little more twisted. An eBay type auction is set up with a picture of the person and the bidders are allowed to to it over their phones. Instead of doing the killing in a old warehouse this one is in a sophisticated room with glass where people can sit and watch (and order food and drinks). While the ""Dr."" is working people are allowed to place bets on different aspects of the ""performance"" such as how long until the victim brings up his kids. While this is about the same level of gore as the other two this one is a little more disturbing based on the fact that the killings were more like a reality show then for ""fun"". I will say that even though this is a different crew then the others it is not a huge drop off in quality. Overall, if you liked the others you will like this one. I give it a B.",1324425600,27,1092,4.060185185185185
4852882,4,B005OK722U,"The `Hostel' films are movies that I kinda wish were never made. They touch on death, pain, and solitude in ways you'd rather not think about - on situations you'd really rather not ever find yourself in. However, they're so disturbing in their themes and setpieces that it's kinda like a bad car wreck - you can't help but watch.

The first Hostel film was a masterpiece in my opinion - it brilliantly set itself up like a typical mid-2000s teen sex flick, replete with oodles of sex with sensual pop music playing in the backdrop and such, before plunging into the hopeless abyss of pain, misery, solitude, and death, all in a creepy foreign land rife with corruption and lacking law and order.

The second film was average with exception to the excellent character study of the two clients, and this third entry comes off as a pretty typical ""numbered sequel""; the characters are pretty paper-thin, some of the setpieces seem recycled, the editing and pacing is super-fast, etc, and these are GREAT things in my opinion for this type of movie. These characteristics define typical horror sequels, and people complaining about them are watching the wrong movie. This wasn't meant to win any awards, but to be a quick trashy watch.

Three buddies go to Las Vegas for a pre-marriage bachelor party for their buddy who is getting married the next week. It isn't long before familiar things start to happen, and our valiant heroes are enticed by two escorts to a party far off the strip, where things start to go wrong as one can predict. Most of the violence and disturbance-facotr in this entry is, as some early reviews said, tamer than the prior two entries, with the exception of one particularly nasty torture/death early on which seems to have been cut down seriously from what it could have been., and seems almost out of place compared with the rest of the setpieces.

I don't know why I watch these movies - these are things I don't want to think about, and are really negative and depressing. But hell it's the horror genre. A decent entry in the series and a good ""numbered-sequel type"" horror film in general.

P.S. My favorite character in this movie has to be the (Ukranian?) guy who's in the prisoner cage for most of the movie. He gets some awesome scenes near the end and is a total badass.",1324252800,13,2306,4.642156862745098
4852883,4,B005OK722U,"Sure, Eli Roth has nothing to do with this film, and that had me very skeptical from the time I heard another sequel was being made, and Roth had absolutely no involvement in it at all.
It seemed like ""Hostel 3"" was just going to be another sequel made for money. One that was only made to cash in on the success of it's predecessors, had nothing to do with the ""Hostel"" world us fans grew to love, and would just have the famous name slapped onto it to help sell the movie.
With all that said, and now have actually seen the film, I can say it's none of that. The film is different from Eli Roth's ""Hostel"", and ""Hostel 2"", but that's to be expected when someone else takes over on a project.
The game has changed in this film. Instead of taking place in Slovakia, it takes place right here in America. Vegas to be exact. As you know: What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas....
As apposed to people all over bidding on people to kill, like a twisted/psychotic version of eBay, Hostel 3 is a gambling game. People betting on how, and when the victims will meet their demise.
This film isn't as dark as the previous installments, but it's not the crappy film I thought it was going to be.
This is definitely a film I support!

I give it 8 and a half out of 10 stars.",1323907200,13,1263,4.176229508196721

OK, as far as I am concerned the Hostel series is very good in suspense in that you are next certain what tricks the writers have up their sleeves; therefore, you will always be curious.

I really enjoyed the movie. The first two movies have almost the same plot, young American tourists wind up getting abducted and sold to be a victim in a torture/death club.

I get why people would stay at the Hostel in the first 2 sequels but this one was the most ridiculous. I didn't care if they all died. So stupid... You kind of are 2 inches away from being beaten from tha stupid stick if you arrived in a dark alley and decided to knock hard on the back of some creepy dark factory door,and then to walk down dank dark hallways for some hookers? They all deserved death! Every single one of them. I was disappointed the couple that was going to get married weren't killed. Wished they did...Trust me! That wasn't a spoiler alert.

The group bids on the victim but the winner doesn't take any sort of ""hands on"" approach to killing/torturing the victim.  Also, the torture parts are extremely tame compared to the first Hostel.  One guy gets his face cut off with a scalpel (all the guy does is cut a circle and pull flesh...lame), another involves a girl getting sprayed with a sweet liquid and then roaches crawl on her and in her mouth and another guy gets shot by arrows.  The ending was predictable and the motive for his friend's betrayal pathetically weak.  The movie bites and if you enjoy the franchise then stop watching after Hostel 2.  The first Hostel was more enjoyable and the second was watchable, the third is just an insult.",1381536000,3,957,4.594117647058823
4852974,3,B005OK722U,"Hostel Part III (Scott Spiegel, 2011)

Before I start dwelling on the bad things about this movie, which I'm relatively sure I will be doing by the third paragraph, I want to make something perfectly clear: I liked Hostel Part III way, way more than I expected to based on (a) Netflix user ratings, (b) the reviews I'd seen, and (c ) Hostel Part II. I am a big fan in general of movies that say oh, hey, we've taken a look at the expectations you will have based on your viewing of the previous movies in the series, and we're going to write this script with every thought towards turning those ideas on their collective head. Hostel Part III comes roaring out of the gate that way in the very first sequence, as we see country bumpkin Travis (Little Birds' Chris Coypossibly playing to character, as IMDB notes he was born in Louisville, KY) stumbling into a room in a hotel already inhabited by a lovely Eastern European couple where the woman looks like a hooker and the guy like a thug. If you've seen the first two movies, this is obvious setup, but then screenwriter Michael D. Weiss, who specializes in bad sequels (I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer, Octopus 2: River of Fear), turns things around, and while this is a minor spoiler, the opening scene is mostly there for set decoration anywayTravis is the hunter, the right-hand man of Flemming (Der Untergang's Thomas Kretschmann), the head of Elite Hunting Club's Las Vegas branch. Turns out Travis cleans up pretty nice.

But that's not part of the actual plot, which involves Carter McMullen (Thirteen's Kip Pardue) hauling his best friend Scott (Client List's Brian Hallisay) off to Vegas for his bachelor party after assuring the fianc&eacute;e (Kelly Thiebaud, now a regular on General Hospital) that they're off for a weekend of golfing in Palm Springs. Once in the City that Never Sleeps, they hook up with two of their other friends, Justin (Shutter's John Hensley) and Mike (The Rules of Attraction's Skyler Stone), and the four of them get ready to party down with a number of lovely escorts, including Kendra (Whip It's Sarah Habel), who ends up having a deep and meaningful conversation with Scott after he decides he's going to stay faithful, they bond, blah blah blah, you know where all this is going.

I wouldn't necessarily describe it as clever, but given my expectations given that it's a third movie in a series etc., it was far more intelligent than I thought it would be, pointed and fun and never forgetting that the backbone of the entire series is Eli Roth's very, very black sense of humor. But there were some things about it that range from just not ringing quite rightthere seems as if there's going to be a romance subplot that just kind of withers on the vine, for exampleto the outrageously awful (oh, that soundtrack). A computer crash just lost me the last paragraph and a half of this review and I'm too frustrated to retype it all (not to mention I'd written it in fits and starts over the course of the previous hourthe irony is that LibreOffice's autobackup procedure is what caused the crash in the first place), so the short answer: the stuff I've been harping on in this paragraph, which is annoying and often beggars suspension of disbelief, is still not enough to say avoid this if you were a fan of the first film; Spiegel (From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money) is certainly no Eli Roth, but go into this with low expectations and you might find yourself pleasantly surprised. ** ",1381449600,2,3496,4.64297253634895

Travis (Chris Coy) is walking in a hotel in Las Vegas. He walks into a hotel room. In the room is a blonde woman, Anka (Evelina Oboza) and Victor (Nickola Shreli). Victor is really horny for Anka. When Travis asks where they are from, Victor replies, ""Ukraine"". Victor offers him a drink of Vodka. Travis has some cold beer in his tote bag. He shares the beer and Anka goes to take a shower. As Victor discusses getting a club card for Travis to see the ""chicks"", he goes into the bathroom to ask Anka, but something is wrong. He asks Travis for his help. She is naked and not responding.

Folks, the reason why I give this flick such high marks is because it covers all the 'basic grounds' of what a 'scary movie' should have, while at the same time it is believable, credible, like you could know these people as if they were your next door neighbor or something. The script is believable, the acting is commendable and to me, this is one of the scariest horror movies to emerge in quite some time (watch it the 1st time with the lights on, among trusted friends...).
  One thing I would like to say, in defense of horror movies: Don't judge people who like this type of thing, please don't play God or Jesus with us. Hey, I sat through Jason Vorhees, Michael Myers, Freddy Crougar and many other imaginative dark characters, all while going to church and singing in the Catholic choir. Some horror movie fans DO know the difference between right and wrong; and for those of you hellbent on judging us, you might be surprised to learn that movies like 'Hostel III' keep us staying good, as opposed to what you might think. Please - there are plenty of good-hearted souls who enjoy a good scary movie here and there, so if you want to be frightened, (and remember that evil does exist in our world), I highly recommend this movie. This is one of the scariest movies I've seen in quite some time; and after seeing it, if anything, it only strengthens my belief in Jesus, in the Afterlife, in spirit guides, in the wonderful world that awaits most of us who pass successfully into the Other World after our Physical Life has ended.
  Good job to all the actors, actresses, casting directors, filming directors, makeup artists, producers, etc... great movie.

4852979,4,B005OK722U,"Reviewed by Amanda Jane Volovik ""Chava"": I was reading over reviews and this movie IS more shallow in plot and acting than the other Hostel movies. The Hostel concept progression is logical, the other two Hostels had to be taken to the next step. I don't know where Eli Roth was, it was still very grossly entertaining. The producers had to up the ante for torture saturated watchers with made-to-order, sadistic/snuff 'plays behind glass'. This all for the enjoyment of an audience of vile, salivating, psychopathic aristocrats (I would love to have seen them get their debut on the snuff stage). I thought a guy's face being peeled off while he was alive was horrific enough, I think other reviewers found it to be G-rated fare, God help us what they think is 'over the top'. This is entertaining and delivers. A good ironic statement on what Vegas does to people anyway. 4 stars for 'this is quite good for a third installment of a horror snuff sequel'.

It has been sanitized to a degree similar to the hack job on Ed Gein (1957 body snatcher) that grade school kids could watch, if they could stay awake. We owned a typically small grocery store (20'x20' typical 40-50's) when Ed was grinding up his supply of meat and making lamp shades and furniture out or skin and the real chill was so bad we could not sell ground meat without proof we bought it from a SAFE vender and still sales lagged for several years. As a rule I never watch ghoulish videos except for Friday the 13-I and Halloween and like those I watched ""Hostile I"" as a curious fluke. My skin actually crawled from what I saw. ""Hostel I"" actually had a very good ghoulish story and number II was so-so ok, but this video had no real story, no scary moments and its tortures lacked skin crawl and blocked all scenes (like in Ed Gein) that would be offensive and God forbid create little Columbines.",1363824000,,1010,4.349206349206349

The first two films were about a bunch of travelers who got kidnapped and killed by millionaires, who were part of some human hunting club, but they didn't go any further than that. Finally, in Hostel III, we see inside the elite hunting club and learn it's purpose. Also unlike the first two films, this Hostel has a plot, that's interesting and apathetic. Featured in Hostel III is Kip Pardue, a veteran b-movie actor, and newcomer Brian Hallisay. They were humorous, likeable, and perfect for this type of film. After two insane gorefests, Hostel finally grew up and learned to combine the shocking violence with a good story, and a likeable cast. This was the by far the best Hostel film so far and one of the best horror movies I've seen all year. If you like horror, don't miss this one.

4852990,2,B005OK722U,"The stakes turn deadly for four friends when their bachelor party lands them in a seedy nightclub off the Las Vegas Strip that is run by the secretive Elite Hunting organization! With creator Eli Roth out of the picture for the third film in the popular HOSTEL franchise, Scott Spiegel seemed like an ideal candidate to take over in his place. After all, Spiegel has worked closely with childhood friend Sam Raimi on numerous pictures, and even directed the cult Slasher INTRUDER, a film in which he deployed the same twisted sense of humor that is often found in the HOSTEL series. Despite these facts, Spiegel turns out a painfully stupid and uninviting sequel that is completely devoid of the most entertaining elements of the original. The dark, Eastern European setting has been exchanged for the bright lights of Vegas, only the majority of the film takes place off of the strip, making the location of the events irrelevant. None of the characters are perceived as being heroic or even remotely likeable for that matter, making their prolonged deaths a matter of celebration. And if that weren't enough, the inventive torturing devices for which the series has become notorious are reduced to the same tired methods of dispatch that you could find in any dollar bin DVD. With SAW already on its ""final chapter,"" it seems that the Torture Porn genre has finally run its course, so HOSTEL may be closing its doors for good after this disaster.

Story: A group of friends go to stay at a Hostel in vegas. There's the first problem, this should be taking place in europe, like the previous films, then again, this is a straight to video release, so they were probably on a budget. So like the previous films, everything goes wrong. Basically a bunch of crazy rich people kidnap them and tourture them on a stage infront of everyone. The kills were pretty bad. I mean shoving cocaroaches down someones throat? Not a hostel kill, seems pretty cheap. In the end of the film, when one of the guys get chainsawed, they don't even show it, you just here the guy screaming outside the house. Not gory at all. The only gore scene is when the guy's arm gets cut off, I gotta admit, I was pretty impressed. I'll admit the twists were good, but that doesn't make up for the lack of tourture that hostel is supposed to be. I won't give any spoilers away.

Special effects: The special effects weren't bad, they just cheaped out on them. Even when the guy's arm gets cut off, there is little blood loss. Not scary at all.

Acting: Ugh, slightly better than the syfy, but hammy. Again, when the guy's arm gets cut off, he shows little emotion, the only reason I gave that scene a thumb up was because it was the only ""gory"" scene in the movie. The villains sounded like they were reading off a script, but I guess I should have expected the from a straight to dvd release, and the fact that neither Takashi Miike were involved, or Quentin Tarantino. Even the female actress in the film was bad, the girlfriend.

Verdict: Now before you go making your purchase, really think, If I were you, I would watch this either on netflix, or on a website somewhere. Seriously, I don't even know why they bothered making this, If you are a hardcore hostel fan, then buy it. Even the second film was bad, not horrible, but bad. And I bought the second film on dvd without thought because I loved the first film so much, and sadly, I felt let down. The idea was constuctive, turning an entire tourure into a show. There are good straight to videos, and there are bad ones, this one falls in between. If you want to see a REAL good straight to video release, check out ""Captured"". I may just by this for the collection since I have the first two, but other than that, It's a complete waste.",1357516800,,2525,4.331923890063425
4852995,5,B005OK722U,"Before I watched this movie I left the following review. I couldn't say I never saw it, because then no one would have took the review seriously, but I just basically gave some facts about the director/producer which is all still true. I just want to add that I actually did like this movie. I guess it can still be considered a let down to true hostel 1 & 2 fans, but as a horror movie period, I thought it was really good. Definately worth a watch in my opinion, but as far as the people leavig negative reviews, I can hear them out too because if you read the following review which I left in the past, you'll learn this producer's history of botched sequels. I rated it 5 stars, but left my old review so you can consider the facts. keep in mind I rated this movie as a standalone film, not as a seguel. You can watch this if you've never seen the 1st two and it will make perfect sense. Here is the old review:

I breifly skimmed through some other reviews and I saw more negative than positive, but in the negative reviews, all it seemed like people were commenting on was the surprise in let down from a sequel and the poor plot ect. What it seemed to me a lot of people didn't know is that this third installment is actually not even made by the same people at all, which I thought was weird and a turnoff right from the start. Hostel one and two are written and directed by Eli Roth. Roth is probably best known for hostels 1 & 2 and the movie Cabin Fever. The first two also featured the movie master himself Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, Inglorious Basterds, ect.) as an executive producer. What is strange and sort of a red flag about hostel 3 is that both writer/directer of the entire hostel series (Roth) did not make this sequel and producer Quentin Tarantino was not involved. I'm not sure the specific story of how it happened, whether the hostel franchise was sold or whatever, but knowing that definatly set my expectations low. Especially knowing that roth and tarantino are very hard acts to follow. Another reason to set your expectations even lower is that the ""Roth Replacement"" on Hostel III is Scott Spiegel. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not very familiar with Spiegel and I don't want to say he's never made a good movie, but is anyone reading this review familliar with the From Dusk Till Dawn movies? I looked into Spiegel briefly and noticed he was the one who directed the sequel to From Dusk Till Dawn. In that case he was playing a ""Robert Rodriguez replacement"" and anyone who has seen From Dusk Till Dawn and it's sequel knows that the sequel was a disaster. The first one was a good movie as produced by rodriguez and starring clooney, tarantino, Keitel, and Lewis. Therefore, it has come to my attention that not only was the hostel story passed onto new and less capable hands, but those hands have sort of a reputation for pulling botched jobs on hand-me-down films. Anyway, I just thought that if people were considering buying this based on the previous films that they should at least take these facts into consideration.

I wanted a decent story with adequate acting and special effects that weren't terribly cheap-looking. It met these qualifications, and I enjoyed it enough to give it three stars.

The film takes quite a while to get going - more than 30 minutes - after a series of fake-outs and false starts. That wasn't a bad thing, and I was genuinely surprised a couple of times. The plot is more than a little influenced by ""The Hangover,"" with a dose of ""Taken."" The gore is minimal, likely due to the cheap budget, and there are no real scares. There was one twist that worked OK, but the final twist was very predictable.

It finds our lead characters heading towards Sin City for a wild bachelor party! Obviously having the title ""Hostel III"", they run into a bit of trouble. This movie retains all the gore elements that made the first such a crowd pleaser, but it falls behind in story and overall character likeability. This film just lacked in all those overlooked horror details that made the first so great. The language barrier, the lawlessness and uncertainty of foreign countries. Plus the characters are just jerks! You are almost rooting for the killers in this one, as not one of them really makes that attachment to the audience. But, ohh well.

So, this isn't awful, and if you were searching for a Hostel sequel. This is unfortunately it. But it really isn't horrible and is exactly what is described in the movie summary.

This version seemed like it was trying to cater to the Scream/teen masses. Perhaps because of all the wonderful vampire movies lingering out there? They need people to watch..

It would seem this version jumped the shark so bad, it can hardly be called the same ""Hostel"" series. The beginning starts off slow with acting that would make an incoherent drunk cringe in boredom. There is endless build up, only to be let down at every turn. It's as if 1 and 2 were covered SO WELL, that they were struggling to even come up with a plot this time around. Let's face it, the mystery was gone in part 2. Which one would expect.

This one takes place in Vegas, a true tragedy from the beginning. The original point of this movie, is that it was hidden in Slovakia, away from prying eyes and many times, any sort of authority.

If your looking for gore, look elsewhere. The effects were so bad and unrealistic (deaths) that I almost turned it off many times due to the cheesiness. The cockroaches ravenously entering the girl's mouth to CHOKE her was just too ridiculous and unreal that I had to laugh. This could mostly be shown on TV unedited, most of the time the gore and blood was out of focus or not in frame. I'm guessing because it looks so bad, the director didn't want any more embarrassment.

When I saw this, I thought it was a ""SyFy original"".. yes that bad.

4853002,2,B005OK722U,"I slightly enjoyed Hostel and Hostel: Part 2, so I was somewhat excited to see Hostel: Part 3. It's basically the same story as the original two, but this one changes the environment to Las Vegas and adds betting into the equation of the Elite Hunting organization. Changing the formula seemed like a great idea, but it ultimately fails in every other department.

What did I like? Some of the kills were original and innovative. The Vegas environment was also a somewhat welcomed change. It had some tense scenes.

What didn't I like? Hostel: Part 3 has some very weak effects which hurt the overall tone of the film; for example, the roach scene looked promising but actually sucked due to the effects. Also, although I enjoyed the Vegas setting, I feel like it took away from the fear of backpacking across a foreign country and getting abducted while doing so. The acting was weak from some characters, and I didn't like the ending. It wasn't as scary or tense as I expected, either. Also, for an unrated, straight-to-DVD film, you'd expect it to push the boundaries or try something new, but it doesn't

Do I recommend this movie? No, I was disappointed and I'm not even a big fan of the series. The movie fails more than it succeeds. If you must watch this, it is available on Netflix streaming as of 6/25/12 and I recommend you check it out there instead of paying full price for it.",1340582400,2,1390,4.57429718875502

4853016,3,B005OK722U,"I had no expectations for this movie.  Not a fan of the series in general for a couple of reasons the main reason is that it's mindless horror (horror for the sake of being horror).  I view them as using gore to mask what is a bad premise/bad movie underneath.  Most of the series-horror movies eventually revert to this (or parody) when the premise wears thin.  If you develop the story and characters enough (even in a horror movie) you don't need much if any gore by definition because it becomes paradoxical to develop a character then cut him up 5 minutes later.

Anyway, this particular sequel isn't that bad but it's still not good.  Characters are bland, premise is ultra thin, excessive plot holes, and ultra violent (but less so than the other hostel movies).  This is still a watchable ""better b"" movie just don't expect a masterpiece.  I think this is one of the cases where the budget doesn't match the ideas.

4853023,3,B005OK722U,"In Hostel (2005), Eli Roth (writer/director) spun the story of an Eastern European Mom'n'Pop farmhouse business where private members would pay top dollar to torture American tourists.  Like any murder movie of the time, it was told through the eyes of the victems.  Roth (again, writer/director, and now characters/producer) changed things up a little in Hostel II (2007), in which the viewers got a taste of the abductors' and torture club members' perspective.  For extra flavor, Roth peppered in some international membership from America played by Roger Bart and Richard Burgi, two upperclass white family men.  I doubt that it is any coincidence that both of these actors were from Desperate Housewives.  In this third installment Roth has little involvement--only a character writing credit--taking a back seat to a writer and director who have had little major success.  This had me very skeptical, however the director did have a writing credit on Evil Dead 2 (his only claim to next-to-fame) and the production value and acting look good.  If only that were enough.  The loss of Roth should be considered the loss of the franchise.

 John Hensley (FX's Nip/Tuck, Teeth) plays the opposite of his typical casting: lame, passive, and conservative; the Ed Helmsley of The Hangover.  Kip Pardue (Drive, The Wizard of Gore remake-2007) plays more like The Hangover's Bradley Cooper.  Then there's the well-to-do but possibly corruptible bachelor and the driven-bitter-by-marriage guy who seeks excitement.  These four are having a bachelor party in Vegas.

 After a few drinks and hands of blackjack they are invited to a wild venue way off the strip with a couple of too-hot-to-be-talking-to-you local chicks.  They go.  Then, long story short, they have someone play ""Operation"" on them.  This flick truly is like a tutorial for girls and guys to NEVER take a drink from ANYONE.  Not even if they open the bottle in front of you because, evidently, they bought the Ruf & Chandon Brut Classic for your champagne toast.

 The theme is more high-tech than parts I and II.  There's a sterile ""hobby"" room, an audience with cocktails and laptops looking into a glass exhibit room, and everything is managed online.  It all seems a little too sophisticated, kind of like the drugged-up chick auction in Taken--sparkling wine, Armani and high rollers.  There are some attempts at goring us out including a pretty serious scene pulling off the skin from someone's entire face.  But other than that one ""moment"" of awesome, I really felt like this flick missed the point of the Hostel franchise.  The story was told from the director's perspective, not through the eyes of the victem or assailant.  The torture scenes were short and limited to a gimmick (for example, shooting someone with a crossbow until they die), we didn't ""see"" enough happen, and there was no relationship between the tortured and the torturer, as in terror and fear met by a sick rush of euphoria.  As if it wasn't mediocre enough, the writers tried to slap almost half a dozen twists on us--none of them were well-received.  Really, they didn't make a difference to me at all.

 I'm not denying that I was entertained, but I'll never watch this movie again.  In fact, this movie was recommended by a friend of mine.  I'm currently re-evaluating that friendship.  LOL.  Hostel (2005) and Hostel II (2007), by all means, have the gore and intensity you wanted to see when you rented this by accident.  I'd also refer you to franchise flicks from Saw and Cube.

4853036,2,B005OK722U,"I had read a few good reviews of this movie before picking it up, and I guess I had my hopes set pretty high.  In the end I found myself fast forwarding through this movie just to get through it.

Hostel part 3 never needed to be made.  Parts 1 and 2 were created to compliment each other, using male and female view points.  They weren't works of art, but Eli Roth packed them full of subtext and psycho-sexual terrors.  This movie lacks that.  Instead we get a very dull ""torture porn"" film that tries to be creative, but because of limited budget, ends up feeling stale and pointless.

The main plot is simple.  A group of guys throwing a bachelor party in Vegas get caught up in some Hostel style hijinks.  Screaming and bloodletting ensues... eventually.  First we have to spend thirty minutes ""getting to know"" these guys.  I'll break it down for you.  We have the honest, groom to be.  The handicapped guy with a good sense of humor.  The miserable married guy who complains about his wife, and finally the rich best friend who you know is up to no good.  Throw in a few well meaning, and always fully clothed prostitutes, and a guy with a non-descript eastern European accent, and you have our cast.  The film spends thirty minutes telling the viewer what I was just able to tell you in a couple of sentences.  Did I mention that other than the handicapped guy and the groom, almost all the characters are unlikeable, and usually only communicate through dialogue that involves a constant barrage of a certain curse word that starts with an F?  Now, the actors themselves don't do a bad job.  The majority of the cast actually turns in fairly good work.  The problem is that the characters that they are stuck playing just aren't people you would want to spend any time with.  Even when you know that the majority of them are going to die in horribly violent ways.

Once the violence does start things seem promising.  The majority of the effects are practical, and look very good... when they show them.  This movie, while still fairly graphic and gory, is probably the driest of all the Hostel films as far as blood flow goes.  Don't get me wrong, this movie is bloody, but there are more than a few moments were the camera just misses the gore pay off, and instead the audience is given a shot of blood splashing on a wall, or a lamp or something.  It also doesn't help that the set ups for the kills, while most likely intended to be creepy, come off as silly.  Mostly this is due to the overly hammy acting of the killers.  Although the ""arrow"" scene is fairly effective, due to some creative wardrobe choices.  In the end though, even that scene turns out to be a clunker, and feels dragged out.

So, why did I give this two stars instead of one?  Well... The last fifteen minutes of the movie actually turned out to be okay.  Not great, mind you, and certainly not good enough to warrant picking up this film, but they were exciting, well staged, and sadly just make the first seventy five minutes look that much worse.

Skip Hostel part 3.  There was potential in the idea behind this one, and a few interesting and well done moments, but in the end the movie is just painful to sit through, and those moments aren't worthwhile enough to sit through the rest of this train wreck.

Oh, and whoever thought it would be a good idea to have the guys stay at a ""stripper"" hotel (I use the term loosely since most of the ""strippers"" remain fully clothed) needs to grow up.  (I'm not kidding.  There are random stripper poles all over the hotel the guys stay at.  It's so random it's comical.)",1326412800,2,3602,4.434451219512195
4853040,4,B005OK722U,"There is no way to top a movie franchise such as the Hostel movies. The first movie was shocking, revolting, controversial, gory, sexy, and just down right wrong. Hostel part II was more tame in my opinion (except for the bathtub scene...*shiver*), but being a fan of the first, I feel it was a good continuation to the first movie. Hostel part III, however, is different than the first and second movies primarily because the rich people don't kill the people themselves, it takes place here in America, there is much less sex/nudity, much less gore (but i believe the number of victims is the largest in this film), and there was actually some shocking twists that I never saw coming.

I felt this movie was the least gory/bloody/horrific of the trilogy. Having said that, there are still a few scenes that made my skin crawl.

All in all, I feel people were too harsh on this movie. You paid to watch a movie about rich people trampling over others by ways of torture and pain, and it was delivered. I give it 4 stars because of the original deaths, the shocking twists, the chills on my skin, and the simple satisfaction that another scary movie will keep me up until 5am tonight. :)",1326326400,2,1187,4.542056074766355

And from after that point (taking up perhaps the first 10 minutes)...drudgery you could eat with a fork.

For any nephews out there who think they'd like to graft a script onto a successful franchise, it is imperative that you understand the reason for that franchise succeeds.

But if you are actually capable of that level of bold creativity, why are you doing bad horror series fanfic in the first place?

If you simply must do a sequel to something successful (not good, I'm not saying that--just successful), then study WHY it is successful.  In the case of Hostel, the elements are that the people are ABROAD and therefore less sure of whom to trust, or the customs, or the geography, or perhaps most saliently, the LANGUAGE.  It is also important that, give or take a best friend or two, the main characters must not have people they know with them.  Isolation is crucial here.  Another element: People must pay to do their own killing.  This is the central conceit of the first two Hostel movies, and it is responsible for three-fifths of the OMG factor.  That there are people walking around--powerful, handsome, outrageously wealthy people--who enjoy torture and brutal slaying as a way to let off steam.  Merely having people wager on acts performed by a professional, full-time torturer/killer blunts the skin-crawl factor by about 47 percent.  No, make that 49 percent.

And finally, apart from a message about treating other people ethically rather than as objects of pleasure which provided plausible ethical and intellectual cover for submitting oneself to this level of suffering and gore (whew!), the only real reason to see movies like Hostel or Saw is as an act of courage.  How much can we stand?  Will I flinch?  Will I cover my eyes?  Will I vomit (two girls did when I saw the original Hostel at an opening-night showing at the multiplex).  Whatever money you thought you should spend on catering, locations, hell, actors...should be pumped directly into prosthetics.  You will need eyeballs, hands and feet, and for Hostel II...I can't say.  It's a spoiler.  I wonder if they used the same one for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Piranha/dp/B002ZG98KK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Piranha</a>?  'Nuff said.

I guess I will say one more nice thing about Hostel III.  Someone quipped that if you can't be a role model, at least be a cautionary tale.  Hostel III is a wonderful cautionary tale.  It's an exemplar of what can happen when those who don't understand horror are given enough money to try to create it.  And to all looking for genuinely INTERESING horror--forget the United States for the most part.  All the really good horror is coming out of Japan, England, Spain, and Scandinavia.  I can't remember the last American horror movie that made me proud of my country.",1326326400,,4768,5.440654843110504
4853042,1,B005OK722U,"Honestly, I wasn't expecting much from this movie... direct to DVD, the biggest ""star"" in it was Kip Pardue, not even a production credit from Eli Roth... but I had no idea it would be so aggressively stupid and just plain insulting to the intelligence of its audience. Hostel was popular not just due to its gore, but because it played on American fears of that dark and alien place that is eastern europe, as well as themes of xeno and homophobia. In short, it was torture porn that was smarter than it had any right to be and that is why it was such a success. Then along comes Hostel II with slightly less provocative gender themes, misogyny and one of the most disturbing and graphic death scenes to grace cinema theaters in a while. Now we have Hostel III, a movie that is so distant from its predecessors that, as I stated before, it's just plain insulting to viewers.

Hostel III follows the Elite Hunting Club's continued booming business of torture and murder, this time taking us to the U.S. (mistake number one) Las Vegas (what happens there stays there, get it?) to be precise, where club members not only get to indulge in acts of carnage, but also have the option of watching and even placing bets on the dismemberment. A group of guys, lead by hasbeen Kip Pardue (you know how I know he's a hasbeen? cause he's staring in Hostel III!) out celebrating their buddy's impending wedding. While this premise sounds mildly promising, it isn't, not even a little bit. This movie fails for one main reason: it betrays its source material completely and utterly. Even with the limited budget of a direct to DVD release, one would at least expect to see some decent gore and disturbing carnage, right? Think again, instead you'll be treated to some of the most bloodless and stupidest deaths you've ever seen.

Number one: a person does not die from having their face peeled off.

Number two: hissing cockroaches do not crawl into people's mouths by the hundreds to choke them to death.

Number three: why on earth is there an unrated version of this? I didn't see anything that was disturbing or horrific enough to even warrent a hard R rating. I'll tell you why, it's a sales gimmick.

It's crap like this that is so insulting, to think that this garbage's makers believed that they could piggy back off of decent horror films like Hostel and Hostel II, and try to sell audiences cheap toilet paper like this is just a slap in the face. The worst SAW movie is leaps and bounds better than Hostel III, which is a truly sad and accurate statement. I actually feel dumber for having watched this movie. Save yourself some angst and a few brain cells and skip this movie. Rewatch the first two instead.",1326240000,81,2706,4.5711340206185564
4853043,1,B005OK722U,"I wasn't expecting something like the first 2 movies, since Eli Roth had nothing to do with it, and it was direct to dvd...but, wow..this just wasn't even close.
It actually has a good opening scene. Kind of giving you the tense feeling the other 2 did. A nice twist to start things out, so I was hopeful. But, way downhill after that. Characters and the actors who play them are awful.
But, even good characters probably wouldn't change it.
The beauty of the first 2 movies are lost here, when the locale is changed to Vegas. ""Hostel"" and ""Hostel II"" have our victims in a small country, where the police are in cahoots with the people behind Elite Hunting. I get the feeling that this can actually go on, and go on for a long time. I don't think it is too much of a stretch to imagine that it would be hard to track down info on missing backpackers. But, I do find it hard to imagine that a it could go on in a city like Vegas. Cameras everywhere, lots of high rollers, and it isn't exactly like they were doing this in a super secret place. I mean..the first 2 people disappear after a night of partying at this ""club"". So, to keep the ""club"" secret...they let 4 of the group go home? If my friend goes missing in Vegas, and I can't get ahold of him..I will probably be calling the police, and directing them to the last place I remember being at. Boom..game over.
Anyhoo..I digress. The rest of the movie is filled with nonsense where they try to link gambling to the torture. And then a twist about 3/4 of the way through, that is poorly done. And another twist at the end...that can be seen coming from a mile away, and as unbelievable as the concept that a club like that, could be be run by a dude that looks like he is probably 22.

No. It's a horror movie, of the 21st century torture/revenge variety. For what it was, this film turned out fantastic! People don't like that Eli Roth didn't put his touches on this one, but you know what? It's time to move on from what he did. It's  time to hand over the baton that we all knew would be passed sooner or later. Who did he give it to? Some new guy who would ruin the film franchise? Some up and coming pretentious twit? No way. He gave it to Scott Spiegel, long time Sam Raimi Collaborator, producer of Hostel I and II, and DIRECTOR OF INTRUDER! One of the best slasher films of all time! Everyone needs to calm down and see this film for what it really is: a cult following aimed horror film. Will the fans of Twilight or Avatar applaud this effort? Maybe not. Will the art crowd or, dramatic theater actors rejoice in Hostel III? Well it would be a step in the right direction surely! But this film isn't appealing to them, nor is it trying to.

4853066,2,B005OK722U,"A few weeks ago in my review for ""Wrong Turn 4"" I mentioned how horror fans are willing to watch just about anything. They live and die in the horror genre. ""Sure ""Wrong Turn 3"" sucked but 4 has to be at least a little bit better...right?"" It doesn't matter how many awful sequels we get, we are more than willing to watch another one. The same is true for direct-to-dvd horror. Mostly just franchises the studios realize they can no longer make money at the cinemas with, they cut the budget, release it on dvd, and watch the profits come in.

Case in point, today's entry in the direct-to-dvd horror sequel lottery, ""Hostel: Part III."" I will confess that I was not the biggest fan of the original ""Hostel."" I found the characters to be obnoxiously shallow and its 45 minutes of nudity mixed with 45 minutes of gore just didn't sit well with me. Nonetheless, I was pleasantly surprised by just how good ""Hostel: Part II"" was. It took all of the mistakes about the first one (unlikable characters, no villain backstory, too much nudity) and turned out to be a delicious black comedy with a perfect ending. Now, we have ""Hostel: Part III."" Does it live up to the expectations set by the second entry or does it die trying like the original?

""Hostel: Part III"" begins with a fake out that is actually pretty ingenious. A young man is brought back to a hotel room by a slutty blond stripper and her beefy, bald boyfriend. One thing leads to another and two of them end up drugged and taken away. To say which two would ruin the surprise. Next, we have a group of four friends attending a bachelor party in Las Vegas. These characters are the typical beer guzzling, horny jocks that have become standard place in most horror movies and comedies today. Seriously it is that hard to write likable characters? I guess so. Okay, not off to a good start and we are only fifteen minutes into the movie. The overgrown frat boys are enticed by two sexy escorts to join them at a private party off the Strip. Because, as we all now, whatever happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. Once there, they are horrified to find themselves the subjects of a perverse game of torture, where members of the Elite Hunting Club are hosting the most sadistic show in town.

Blah, blah, blah. ""Hostel: Part III"" brings nothing new to the torture table besides a few half-hearted twists and some lame deaths. What is the point in watching a ""Hostel"" film if nearly ALL of the deaths occur off screen? Not only that, but the few deaths that we actually do get to see are ruined by awful CGI. Note to filmmakers, CGI is easier and cheaper but note that easier and cheaper doesn't always mean better. The final twist in the last five minutes is just insulting. Think of it as a maggot on the top of a rancid ice cream sundae. Skip it.",1325030400,,2798,4.439688715953308
4853067,2,B005OK722U,"I am not sure if we were all watching the same movie. The Cinematography is abysmal and the acting is laughable. The kills are insipid and very cost effective. I really saw minimum gore in this film to say the least. And when you find out that the subject mater revolves around a woman it just kills it. Its reguarding a person that is barely in the film. Its quite obvious this was on a smaller budget or lack there of.

 I just feel like Eli Roth visually is a better director and cinematographer. This movie appears to be divided into two chunks and when you get down to the last chunk it loses momentum. The actions sequences are insipid and the explosions look CGI'ed. Watch this only if you are bored.",1325030400,,707,4.348484848484849

In fact, if Skyler wasn't in it, I wouldn't have seen THIS one.  However, after the first five minutes, I found myself watching the performances intently to see if Skyler did a good job against the other actors in his scenes.  I must say, he deserves to be in much better films.  His acting in this film compared to the other actors is great.  He is funny when he needs to be and yet his performance turns into complete terror when the moment called for it.  His performance is the only thing worth seeing in this film.  The film lost a lot when ""Mike"" died.  Unfortunately for the Hostel series, I don't think he will be back.  LOL!  That's too bad because movies in general need better actors like Skyler in them.
