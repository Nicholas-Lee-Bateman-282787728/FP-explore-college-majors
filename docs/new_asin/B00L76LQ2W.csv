8664196,1,B00L76LQ2W,The claim is that buy purchasing this DVD series the moderator (an architect) will talk you through the entire process and you should be able to do this without any construction background-after 15-20 minutes I sent it back.  hoMe is a nice idea but before I attempt this little project again I need to either hire a laboror or take a course just to be familiar.,1493510400,,362,4.484848484848484
8664197,5,B00L76LQ2W,"Finally! Here is some tiny house instructional that's actually instructional! It does not go into every single possible detail, but it does give you a LOT of very practical advice from someone who (a) clearly knows their stuff and (b) knows how to present it. This is not really suited for the rank beginner (he doesn't tell you how to use your power tools), but if you are already generally a bit handy and want some solid guidance before embarking on a THOW build, buy this set and watch it a few times. This instructional is absolutely worth the $60 I paid. I'd say it's worth at least $200, honestly. Good stuff, no fluff. The information is solid and the presentation quality is equally good.",1484352000,3,697,4.584

8664199,5,B00L76LQ2W,I liked the dstep by step and attention to detail.,1474156800,2,50,4.1
8664200,5,B00L76LQ2W,"Very interesting 6 hours!  If you are planning on building a Tiny House, I definitely recommend you buy this set and learn from it.  It covers many aspects of the built, from selection of their trailer, framing, roofing, plumbing, electrical, interior and exterior sheating, etc. until the finish product.  Well produced!",1424822400,5,321,5.254901960784314
8664201,5,B00L76LQ2W,"I just finished watching this video series and was very pleasantly surprised. Andrew obviously has building experience (as opposed to only  building his own tiny home) and an understanding of safety issues, codes, and solutions for tiny-home-specific problems. While I wouldn't suggest that someone with no experience should build their own home using only this resource, I strongly feel this video series is well worth the money and would be helpful to anyone heading down this road.",1421971200,5,484,5.285714285714286
