I too had the same problem. I tried it on three diferent blu-ray players. Panasonic, Sony and a computer. I requested an exchange, thinking... Perhaps was just a bad disk. When the new one arrived. I played both back to back on two players. Sound but no video or at best intermitent. I checked cables,firmware and zone. Very dissapointed. So I returned them both today for a refund.",1341014400,,570,4.653465346534653
