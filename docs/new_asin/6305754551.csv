1065700,4,6305754551,"Scottish themed story with a lot of charming qualities.

The model work in this episode was much higher than in many other episodes. The close up of an oil rig was very good for the time this story was created. Another scene that shows the Zygon ship leaving Lochness was also well done for its time.

While the models are very good the Lochness monster was a dud, though it can be partially explained away since it was suppose to be part cyborg. The Zygons themselves are respectable and it was a brilliant idea to have them whisper orders instead of shout, it makes them seem more alien.

The bagpipe music helped add to the atmosphere and enjoyment of this episode, and this is a fun one to watch. It has some influence perhaps from 'The Invasion of the Body Snatchers'. I like the fact that the Zygon ship is organic and the interior set of the ship is quite convincing.

This marks the last episode that featured UNIT, though the Brigadeer does return by himself in 'Mawdryn Undead' and 'The Five Doctors'.",1179964800,,1011,4.508196721311475
1065701,4,6305754551,"The opening story of the thirteenth season has the Doctor, Harry, and Sarah responding to the Brigadier's emergency call that he got at the end of the previous story.  Three rigs by the North Sea have been destroyed in one month.  First there's a radio blackout, then a weird sound that comes in, and then the rig is destroyed.  UNIT is stationed in the nearby village of Tullock, Scotland to investigate.
Some curious markings from the wreckage of the Bonnie Prince  Charlie, the rig destroyed at the beginning of the story leads the Doctor to do a study in orthodontology, with a cast of ""a set of giant molars than can chew through solid steel as easily as paper.""  Could it be a manifestations of evil spirits that Angus McRanald, landlord of the inn UNIT is occupying, tells about to Sarah?  ""Bad luck comes to them who set foot on Tullock Moor"" he tells her.  But do evil spirits destroy oil rigs?
Another character is the Duke of Forgill, a cynical-looking man with a withering look who is not very pleased with the oil company for two reasons.  One, most of his servants have left his employ to work for the oil company, making Forgill Castle a lonely place.  Two, roughnecks from the oil company keep trespassing and poaching on his land.
Things get going when Harry is shot while attempting to help the survivor of the Bonnie Prince Charlie, and the climax of Episode One has a Zygon reaching out for Sarah while she's on the phone to the Doctor.
What makes this story interesting is the fact that the Zygons are shape-shifters, and the special effects of their transformations are well-done.  The Zygons are aliens who like so many alien invaders, want to conquer Earth.  However, the way they intend to do it involves a creature from ancient legend.  Hint:  UNIT are stationed six or seven miles from Loch Ness.
The Doctor's dismissive comment on oil is clearly inspired by the effects of the 1973 oil crisis.  ""Oil, an emergency?  Huh!  It's about time the people who run this planet of yours realize that to be dependent on a mineral slime just doesn't make sense!""
One error is the Doctor telling the Brigadier he's come 270 million miles just to help him.  The outermost of the satellites of Jupiter, where the previous story took place, is 370 million miles, so he's off by a factor of 100 million.
The Zygons themselves are well-realized, macrocephalic, fetal-looking aliens with suckers on their body and prominent rib-cages.  They were modelled after half-formed embryos in amniotic sacs.  As for ""Nessy"", the director was not too happy with the model realization, so much of the script was rewritten in order not to see much of it.  The interior of the Zygon ship, organic like that of the Axons in Claws of Axos, is very realistic and alien.
This would be the last appearance of Nicholas Courtney (the Brigadier) for eight years until he reprised the character in Mawdryn Undead and The Five Doctors.  There would be two further UNIT stories without him--The Android Invasion and The Seeds Of Doom.  Other trivia:  the two bagpipe tunes heard playing are ""Strathspey Reel"" and ""Flowers of the Forest.""  Also, as location shooting in Scotland proved too expensive, shooting was done around the village of Charlton in Sussex.
Not a bad opener for the season, with the usual cast solid and the Zygons and their ship well-realized, but there isn't that extra oomph to make it a great story.",1074988800,20,3408,4.717905405405405
1065702,5,6305754551,"After a very subpar Cybermen story,the Doctor, Sarah and Harry come back to Earth to help UNIT investigate destroyed oil rigs. What they find are people who aren't what they appear to be, an alien threat and one version of the Loch Ness Monster.  This story is full of nice touches, including the Doctor's indignation at being called back about ""mineral slime"" until the Brigadier reminds him of the loss of life, a look at the Brigadier's Scottish heritage and Harry not being an imbecile. The Zygons are well written with a fascinating technology and deserved to come back, which sadly never happened onscreen. However, their one appearance is well worth getting.",989884800,18,665,4.9375

1065705,5,6305754551,"This story has be rated as one of the best ever.  Not only are the monsters among the series most convincing (by 1970's Dr Who standards), but the overall atmosphere generated by the direction and production is  extremely powerful.  Adding to this wonderfully eerie feel, is a superb  score by Geoffrey Burgon - the tension created by his music is incredible.  For me John Woodnutt steals the show, playing two parts as the lead monster  'Broton', and the 'Duke'.  His whispering delivery of the aliens' threat to  the world ranks as one of the series most remarkable performances.  Some  feel that the story is let down by some badly executed animation used for  the 'Skarasen' (The Loch Ness Monster).  But for me, this only further  enhances the appeal of the story: It's not Hollywood special effects that  make it work, it's a superb mix of deep characterisation, thoughtful  direction and above all, spine-tingling performances from all involved.",959990400,10,952,4.974522292993631
1065706,4,6305754551,"The Doctor, Sarah and Harry arrive back on Earth after the Doctor receives a message from the Brigadier that things aren't right at Loch Ness. An incredibly inventive story that has the feel of a Troughton adventure, possibly due to Camfield's careful direction and camera angles. And it looks as though the production team is still trying to feel their way around(as well as Baker) in establishing the Doctor's fourth incarnation. The Zygons themselves are presented to the audience very well, and the story has some effectively scary moments. There is some overblown dialogue here and there, but certainly doesn't distract the viewer. The special effects are ""night and day"", and shouldn't take away from the enjoyment of this adventure. And even though the bonus video at the beginning isn't as long as ""The Face of Evil"" or ""The War Machines"" release, it's still enjoyable, especially in its episodic format.",957830400,,912,5.086666666666667
1065801,5,6305754551,"The deleted arrival scene in Episode 1 is a fun addition to see after so many years. The crowning achievement of this DVD is to be able to hear the show in surround sound.

The theme starts on the center channel and then the entire soundscape opens up as the TARDIS rushes towards you in the credits. The sound effects are utilized extremely well on all audio channels in each episode.

1065860,4,6305754551,"The Terror of the Zygons began Doctor Who's 13th Season and was Harry Sullivan's last serial as a companion. The serial has a lot working for it. For one thing, the aliens look far more realistic than anything else to show up in 1970s Who. Compare this to Season 8's Claws of Axos or Season 10's The Three Doctors and you can see some great progress made in special effects. The Scottish setting is nice, though why the Doctor wore a Balmoral cap for one scene and then discarded it, who knows. The story also had a some pretty chilling moments in the first two parts and a pretty decent conclusion.

If I had any complaint, it's that serial felt padded even for a four parter. Compared to the pace of other 70s Four Parters such as the Time Warrior, Robot, and Ark in Space, these seemed to be a bit slow. Still, overall an enjoyable program that kicks off Season 13 with style.",1406505600,,879,4.359756097560975

1065866,5,6305754551,"I dunno what took them so long to get Terror of the Zygons out on DVD, but it was well worth the wait!

The Doctor and pals Sarah Jane Smith and Harry Sullivan arrive in Scotland in response to an emergency signal from Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart of UNIT. No one is there to meet them, but fortunately a Range Rover being driven by none other than the Duke of Forgill happens by, and the Duke agrees to take the three into town.

TArriving at their destination, a pub where UNIT has set up its field headquarters, the three are told that something has been attacking and sinking American oil rigs off the coast and the company's representative in Scotland, Huckle, is hopping mad and demanding answers from UNIT. There's tension between the Scottish locals and the oil company. The loss of the rigs has only escalated the feelings of mutual discontent - which, weirdly, the Duke of Forgill seems intent on fomenting, resenting the presence of the Brigadier and UNIT.

Initially, the Doctor is loath to help because he disapproves of 1970's-era humanity's dependence on what he refers to as a ""mineral slime."" But the plot thickens when Harry finds a survivor from the latest sunken rig washed ashore. As he struggles to tend to the men, both of them get shot by someone from afar. The rig worker dies, and Harry is left in a comatose state from a head wound. This, combined with the discovery of bite marks in the wreckage recovered from the destroyed rig, now has the Doctor's full attention. Harry is left in the care of a nurse, but when Sarah Jane returns to his hospital room, having forgotten something, she is attacked by an alien creature which locks her inside of a pressure chamber used for divers. Harry is then taken away and imprisoned aboard their ship, where he finds the Duke, his servant and the nurse from the hospital inside some kind of stasis chambers.

The Doctor is also captured at the hospital and shut inside the pressure chamber when he comes looking for Sarah, and the alien turns the pressure up, intending to kill them. The two survive using a meditation technique the Doctor teaches Sarah, and, before they die, they're found and free by Sergeant Benton from UNIT. After this particular encounter, the Doctor realizes they're dealing with Zygons, aliens which can assume the form of humans they have captive. It soon becomes clear that the aliens, led by the determined and cunning Commander Broton disguised as the Duke of Forgill, have control of nothing less than the fabled Loch Ness Monster and are using it to attack and destroy the oil rigs! But to what purpose? And can the Doctor find and rescue Harry and the other captured people before it's too late...?

Definitely a classic, Terror of the Zygons is a callback to the Jon Pertwee-era UNIT stories that were few and far between during Tom Baker's run. It's great to see the Brigadier, Benton and the gang again, the Scottish setting is a lot of fun (both the Doctor and the Brigadier wear traditional Scottish outfits in this story while Harry wears the Doctor's trademark scarf, and we even learn that the Brigadier himself is of Scottish descent).

The Zygons are wonderful villains. Broton in particular is a surprisingly genre-savvy bad guy who, despite not knowing who the Doctor is, instantly recognizes him as a threat and takes great pains to eliminate him as quickly as possible, as opposed to mostly just ignoring him like so many other villains. The side characters of Huckle the token American and Angus the Scottish pub owner are also a lot of fun, and the Duke, whether being impersonated by Broton or not, is a memorably understated and lovably snobby guy.

The special effects are hit and miss. The Zygon ship is great, and so are the Zygons themselves. Seriously, those are some great monster costumes! The effect of them transforming into humans, though, is a little iffy, and then there's the Loch Ness Monster itself. Given the budget I guess they did the best they could, but it just looks really goofy. The scene where it chases the Doctor across the moor after his Land Rover breaks down is really tense and suspenseful, but the climax where it's supposed to attack London is a real letdown. As is the demise of Broton. Oh well. At least the Brigadier finally got to find himself faced with an alien menace that wasn't bulletproof!",1394323200,,4348,4.72068511198946

The Doctor arrives in Scotland, dressed appropriately for the location. He soon learns that the shape-shifting Zygons are behind the attacks, using a local legend to do their dirty work. It's all a plot to take over the Earth of course, and the Doctor must find a way to foil them.

The Zygons are iconic monsters, which have of course re-appeared in the 50th Anniversary. This is their only previous appearance, and they are realized pretty well for their time. Less well realized is the larger monster they control. Their ship is pretty interesting, the design did all it could with a very limited budget. The exterior model-shots of the ship are very good though, being shot from miniatures.

There's lots if nice extras on this one, including a unrelated short film ""The Fuel Fishers"" featuring Elizabeth Sladen visiting off-shore oil platforms and showing how they work.

What I will say is that it was an absolute blast watching this story again. There's nothing about this that doesn't work - the story, albeit a very familiar one is great, well-written and delivered perfectly by the cast.
The Zygons themselves are terrific and the ""organic"" sets are a delight, lit to perfection.
The extras are also well worth a look and it's good to see Tom Baker not so distant from the show. His reminiscences are such fun!
There is one thing that keeps annoying me, though. Towards the end of episode one, the Doctor is standing outside the Hiberian Oil Co. Lt. Sickbay. If they meant ""HIBERNIAN"" then the oil company would have been Irish. If they had meant ""IBERIAN"" then the company would have been Spanish or Portuguese, Andorran or Gibraltarian for that matter. As it goes, with this mish-mash, the company probably originated in the Atlantic...somewhere. I haven't read a review yet that's noticed this.
It annoyed me then and it annoys me now but it still doesn't detract from a first-rate story that shows the heights that Doctor Who could reach when it was on form.
Fun stuff, recommended.",1382572800,,1267,4.737556561085973
1065967,4,6305754551,"It's the middle of the night. Off the coast of Scotland, on an oil rig in the North Sea, Munro talks to HQ over the radio. Suddenly the radio cuts out and the giant rig starts shaking. We watch as the whole thing crashes and smashes and falls into the sea.

It's quite an introduction! In the morning, the Doctor (in a merry plaid Tam o'Shanter and scarf), Harry Sullivan and Sarah Jane disembark the TARDIS on the coastal Tulloch Moor. They're set to meet Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart, who's called them across 240 million miles of space to help him solve a puzzle. Three oil rigs have collapsed and it's a UNIT matter of national security. At the hotel where the Brigadier is staying, Sarah is talking to the landlord. Suddenly, we are watching their conversation on a giant screen. Someone is spying on them. We catch a partial glimpse of the watcher. Whatever it is, it isn't human.

In the meanwhile, Harry finds Munro near the ocean, alive but delirious. But they're being watched, too. It's a man in a kilt, and before you know it, he's shot Munro dead. Humans are working with aliens?

After a 4th oil rig is destroyed, UNIT recovers a piece of a column. It has big conical holes.  The Doctor makes plaster casts of the holes, and shows the result. The rig manager doesn't think he's serious: ""Let's get this straight. Are you trying to tell me those rigs were chewed by a set of giant molars?""

Now we know why one of this series' working titles was ""The Secret of the Loch"".

""Terror of the Zygons"" is a 4-parter that first aired Aug/Sept 1975.  This is a review of the 10/2013 2-disc DVD release, the first time it's been available in that format.  It's the last series with Harry Sullivan as a companion, and the last we see of the Brigadier until he shows up again in the 1983 series, ""Mawdryn Undead"".

Disc 1 Special Features:
1.  Episode 1 Director's Cut. This adds back one deleted scene, totaling 1 min 43 seconds. Right after the crashing oil rig in the intro, the TARDIS materializes, but it's invisible! The three crew seem to step out of nothing. The scene wasn't used because the two halves of the scene were filmed at different times of day and the lightings didn't match. Nowadays, it would be quick fix with the computer, but not so back in 1975.

The commentary audio option is moderated by Tony Ayres, with George Gallaccio (production unit manager), Robert Banks Stewart (writer), Dick Mills (special sounds), Philip Hinchciffe (producer) and Sylvia James (makeup).
Hinchcliffe says, ""I think they were one of the best monsters ever.""
On the other hand, Stewart says: ""When I saw them, the Zygons, they seemed like shrimps to me. Very large shrimps.""
I am with Stewart.
3.  Information Text.  The monster, spelled Skarasen or Scaracen, is a genuine let-down, compared to what could be done at the time with stop-motion. Info Text agrees: ""Everyone involved in the production remembers the disappointment of how the Skarasen effects footage turned out. `We were badly let down on the crucial question of the Loch Ness Monster itself', wrote Philip Hinchcliffe after the event."" As noted in the Making-of feature on disc 2, it came down to money and time. I usually enjoy the Classic Doctor's occasional goofy alien costumes or special effects, it's part of the fun of the show, and, after all, usually they did a good job. But I just couldn't help being disappointed with this one.

Disc 2 Special Features:
4.  ""Scotch Mist in Sussex - Remembering Terror of the Zygons"" (31 minutes) This making-of featurette is so good that after watching it, it raised my opinion of the series as a whole.  Commentators include Philip Hinchciffe (producer), Robert Banks Stewart (writer this series), Simon Farquhar (writer and TV historian), Nigel Curzon (designer), Steve Bowman (visual effects assistant), John Levene (plays Sergeant Benton), James Acheson (costume designer, from a 1999 interview) and John Woodnutt (plays Duke/Broton, from earlier interview).
Hinchcliffe on the Scarasen: ""Stop-motion animation technique, the Harryhausen technique, can work quite well. But you need time."" And they just didn't have the time or the funds.
Levene on the changeover from Pertwee to Baker: ""When Tom took over the Doctor, his approach was so utterly different [from Pertwee], it did momentarily throw us. When an ego is that big, there is no way little men like me - it's like an ant on an elephant's leg. He was a force to be reckoned with.""
5.  ""Remembering Douglas Camfield"" (30 minutes) Camfield, who passed away in 1984 at only 52, was a popular director. Narrator Glen Allen is joined by commentators Robert Banks Stewart, Joggs Camfield (Douglas' son), Graeme Harper (director, classic and new Dr Who, though not this series), Peter Purves (plays Steven Taylor), John Levene, Philip Hinchcliffe, Celia Imrie (actor) and Jonathan Newth (actor).
6.  ""The UNIT Family - Part Three"" (26 minutes) This last of three parts covers the end of UNIT stories (for the most part) in Classic Dr Who. Commentators include Terence Dicks (script editor), Barry Letts (producer), Richard Franklin (plays Captain Mike Yates), John Levene, Tom Baker, Philip Hinchcliffe and Nicholas Courtney (plays the Brigadier).
Franklin muses: ""Everyone always says, `Why were you a traitor?' and I wasn't a traitor.... I have to explain it endlessly.""
7.  ""Doctor Who Stories  - Tom Baker"" (23 minutes) A nice long interview with the 4th Doctor. Barry Letts moved on after producing two shows with Tom. ""Barry was quick to spot my kind of lunacy. My benevolent lunacy. I remember he left in a joke, very early on, when some creature was pointing at me, [and I adlibbed] `Is that finger loaded?' ""
8.  ""Doctor Who Stories  -  Elisabeth Sladen"" (20 minutes) A nice interview with a charming lady. ""The Daleks, I think, were my favorite.... I didn't like the Cybermen. I couldn't believe in those silver Wellingtons.""
9.  Subtitles. Subtitles are available in English.
10. ""Merry-Go-Round - The Fuel Fishers"" (19 minutes) This is an episode of the children's show with guest narrator/star Elisabeth Sladen. She boards a helicopter to visit an oil drilling rig 160 km out into the ocean.
11. ""South Today"".  A local reporter interviews Tom Baker on location in Sussex, standing in for Scotland.

1065968,5,6305754551,"""Terror of the Zygons"" isn't a deep, philosophical Doctor Who story - but it is an awesome one. The plot concerns a race of shape-shifting, octopus-like aliens who are manipulating the Loch Ness Monster into destroying oil rigs in the North Sea. The intrepid Doctor must team up with his military allies in U.N.I.T. to stop the aliens; but which of his friends have been replaced with sinister Zygon duplicates?

Long regarded as a classic Doctor Who serial, ""Zygons"" took forever to come out on DVD. Fortunately, it was worth the wait. The DVD features a good print (considering the age and origin of the source material), clear sound and a ton of special features, including:

- An excellent making-of special that covers the story's production history and major themes;
- Lively 2003 interviews with stars Tom Baker and Elisabeth Sladen;
- A 1970s interview with Tom, shot during the making of this story;
- A tribute to director Douglas Camfield, who shot many of Who's classic episodes; and
- A vintage TV program featuring Lis Sladen touring a real oil rig. No way!

There's also an option to watch a special extended edition of Part One, featuring a previously unreleased scene of the TARDIS crew arriving in Scotland. I enjoyed this particularly, because it's awesome to see new footage of the lovable 1970s Who crew.

Alas, I do have one quibble about this release. The DVD is missing an obvious special feature that many fans had fervently hoped for - new CGI effects to replace the ridiculous puppet Loch Ness Monster from the original broadcast. The Beeb has splurged on new special effects for Doctor Who before, most relevantly in the case of ""Kinda,"" where a stupid puppet snake monster was replaced with a superb CGI alternative. However, in this case the silly Loch Ness Monster - the only bad special effect in the whole story - was allowed to remain and blight an otherwise excellent production. Bah, I say.

But I complain too much; arguably, a CGI replacement for the Loch Ness Monster would look anachronistic anyway. As it stands, the original production of ""Terror of the Zygons"" is still 95% awesome, and well worth owning on DVD. And with the Zygons due to return next month in Doctor Who's 50th anniversary special, this is a particularly good time to catch up with their classic debut...",1381363200,11,2315,4.806532663316583
1065969,4,6305754551,"""Terror of the Zygons"" is not just an excellent story, but the first story to truly reflect the darker and more adult tones introduced by Producer Philip Hinchcliffe and Script Editor Robert Holmes- whose would see the already formidable success of the show reach in greater heights, with 20-25% of the entire British Public regularly tuning in to watch it.

The script, by Robert Banks Stewart, is tightly written with superb dialogue and memorable one-liners from both the regulars and the guest cast. Douglass Camfield (having directed several classic during the 1960s) returns to directs the story with the same stunning visuals and atmosphere that made him a legend of the series. Having served in the military, Camfield depicts UNIT as the elite military force it was meant to be- especially poignant, as this would be the last 'proper' UNIT story until its revival fifteen years later in 1989's ""Battlefield"". As always, Nicholas Courtney is superb as the iconic Brigadier, as is John Levene in the role of the ever-faithful Sergent Benton. Ian Marter, in what would be his last story (barring a brief cameo later that season) gets some great moments- showing the old-school class of the real Harry Sullivan (the embodiment of the ""English Hero"" that defined a previous era) and subtle menace in his portrayal of the 'Imposter', culminating in disturbing and memorable cliffhanger. Even the costumes are made by future Oscar-winner James Acheson!

The titular Zygons are realized brilliantly- both in their truly 'alien' appearances (brilliantly realized by VizFX masters John Horton and John Friedlander) and their chilling whispering voices (the Leader, Broton, played masterfully by veteran DW guest actor John Woodnutt). The Zygons, being ""shape-shifters"", morph between their true selves and (to their own disgust) their assumed human identities, meaning that ANYONE could potentially be an alien infiltrator! There are a number of genuine scares throughout, and ever-present unease for the viewers, aware of both a known danger and a possible threat.

Overall, the production values of this story are high, usually managing to overcome the criminally low budgets allotted to the series by the BBC higher-ups. However, this was made in 1975, and the limitations- financial, technical, and time- must all be considered when watching this. Any shortfall should be viewed with the knowledge that for as much money as the show made the BBC, they couldn't be bothered to spare any extra funding for this ""children's show"" (even though it was being made by the Drama Department, much to the outrage of the big wigs in children's programming!). Doctor Who is not a show to be watched ironically, nor is it meant for jaded and cynical post-ironic hipsters who now reject their childhood, and it not for people looking for a show they laugh at while telling themselves they're above it...

However, if you want to watch a show with a positive message- that good people help those in need because it's simply the right thing to do, that to simply sit back and allow evil to prevail is wrong, and that being the ""Hero"" means always doing what's right and not what's easiest- then Doctor Who is a series you'll enjoy. Ever since I was 4, when I first started watching the classic series in 1988, the Doctor became THE Childhood Hero that I could believe in. And twenty-five years later, I still believe in what he stands for.",1379721600,2,3425,5.035273368606702
1065970,4,6305754551,"With this release, all of the Doctor Who stories from Tom Baker's era have been released.

Others have talked about the plot, so I won't, other than to say I remember it with fondness; enjoyed the exchange between the Duke and the Brigadier at the end.

Most people seem to remember the not-terribly-good Loch Ness monster; however, this DVD is worth getting because it is the last real UNIT show (there are subsequent UNIT shows, but more with the Doctor bumping into them by accident).  This is Harry's farewell as a companion. It's goodbye to the Brigadier for many years, too. So, I'd get it just for these events if nothing else.",1375056000,8,634,4.642857142857143
1065971,5,6305754551,"This was one of the first episodes of ""Doctor Who"" that I remember watching. Roughly, the story is a creepy one about an alien plot to replace the members of Parliament with disguised aliens called Zygons. Their backup plan: unleash the Loch Ness Monster, a cyborg they brought with them, to destroy Parliament and sow chaos. Though the special effects are understandably campy by modern standards, there are plenty of fascinating concepts and the whole thing is pulled off very well.
This is a story from the early days of Tom Baker's tenure as the Doctor - I believe it was the fifth story he starred in. Yet he has already developed the character's personality which has made him the favorite classic Doctor in the United States. It didn't hurt that his were the only episodes available to us Yanks for many years.
Like most of the 1970's stories, parents should be aware that there are some elements which may frighten young children, yet don't let this keep you from trying them out on it! Historically, since 1971, ""Doctor Who"" had a history of eliciting angry letters from parents claiming their children were so scared that they hid behind the couch. Yet those same children, once they found out that their parents were trying to get the show canned, wrote in pleading the BBC to keep the show going - they actually LIKED being scared. In fact, ""Terror of the Zygons"" is not really all that scary when you compare it to later episodes like ""The Talons of Weng Chiang"", ""The Robots of Death"" or ""The Horror of Fang Rock"".
In the cannon of Doctor Who, this episode is not THE best, but I have always included it in my list of ten must-see episodes alongside ""Genesis of the Daleks"", ""The Pyramid of Mars"", ""The Face of Evil"" and ""The Sun Makers"". The last three, in case you're wondering, are ""The Green Death"", ""The Deadly Assassin"" and ""Spearhead from Space"".
**Update**
The Zygons are returning to the new series in ""The Day of the Doctor"" which premiers on November 23rd. Thus any really hardcore fans will want to see this episode before that date if possible. Note that Zygons have been mentioned in the new series several times, most notably in the Christmas episode ""A Christmas Carol"". See if you can find the others.
I should also mention that this is a Sarah-Jane Smith episode and Zygons are also mentioned in ""The Sarah-Jane Adventures"".",1367625600,,2356,4.693236714975845
1065972,5,6305754551,"In the history of any iconic television, movie or book series there are sentinel moments that define that serial and give it the weight ( or gravitas ) to propel the  program beyond it's limits into true iconic/cult status. That I believe is the case here with Robert Banks Stewart excellent classic Doctor Who story from the very early Tom Baker era (1975).
(then) Producer Philip Hinchcliff weaves author Stewart's excellent script into a nail bitting, suspenseful master-class of television viewing. With Hitchcock like prersiccion and timing Director Douglas Camfield and Hinchcliff  use dialog, pace and attmosphere to drive the story which takes some of the pressure off the actors and villains to do so. The main protagonist are the alien Zygons (beautifully realized by costume designer  James Acheson and visual effect guru John Friedlander) with their octopi/tentacle like appearance and serpentine, hissing voices there is no doubt that they are ""not from around here"". Marooned beneath Loch Ness in their crippled starship having escaped from their dying world, the Zygons have been hiding beneath the surface waiting for the right time to strike humanity a fatal blow and claim the Earth as their new home.  This was not a new theme to Docotr Who but it works wonderfully here. Despite their lack of numbers the Zygons have two advantages to secure their dominance. 1-The ability to shape ship (or mourph) into any living human form that they wish ( a plot device that really works well here) and 2-their mechanical sea creatue they call the ""Skaresen""  which has come to be know as the loch ness monster over the years by humanity (This is one of several explanations for Nessy that doctor who produced over the years..but clearly the best). This Kracken like beast remains mostly hidden for the first two episodes (only being heard). And much in the way we did not see the shark in Jaws well into the movie, the Skaraseens delayed appearance creates tention well into episode two without a single view of the creature ( a skill lost by todays tv/films makers who have the advantage??? of CGI). When the creature does finally appear it is every bit the cheesy Doctor Who Monster we loved to see ""Back in the day"" with classic Doctor Who. The Skaresen's glides across the screen with that Ray Haryyhausen like/stop motion animation that was so prevalent in the 60s and 70s (and early 80s Medusa in Class of the Titans). Despite the stilted motion of these effects/monsters, there is quite a old school charm to them and you just have to admire the diligence and patience of the filmmakers who produced them.
  The rest of the story unfolds from here with the Zygons and their creature starting their conquest of the Earth  in London ( of course).  And It is up to the doctor and UNIT to stop them.  I don't want to give away too many plot points but trust me when I say that this is way more than just another UNIT story. It is classic Doctor Who at its ultimate best. Story, directing, acting and set/costume design are the best the classic series could/would ever see. The Zygons are as believable an alien as you would see in any age of science fiction; I was always surprised they never made a second appearance in the classic series. Also ( and most important) this is a bench mark performance by  lead actor Tom Baker and you will see that if ever there was a man born to play Doctor Who it was He. Baker is in full stride here (although only his sixth story) and just exudes alienness with his awkward gaze, curling hair hidden under that brown, frock hat and wrapped in his trade mark scarf. He strides across the fog filled marsh lands of Loch Ness with the same determined confidence of Gandalf riding across middle earth...with little doubt that he will ultimately succeed. I/We could spend days taking about Baker's brilliance in the role. But just trust me that he is at his absolute best here. In addition Lis Sladen is no less brilliant as she ever is/was as companion Sarah Jane Smith and second companion Ian Marter (Harry Sullivan) gives his best performance in the role (which is saying something because he was excellent and consistent in ever scene he was ever in). And not to be over shadowed was the wonderful Nicolas Courtney who makes his final appearance as the Brigadier in the ""UNIT era"" ( He did appear 3 additional times many years later after the unit era passed). Courtney was every bit the consummate professional in this story (He never mailed in a performance).
In summary this is classic doctor who at its absolute best with no obvious faults. The story itself, Tom Baker and the truly alien Zygons are the stars of the show. If this story is not on your shelf then you Doctor Who collection is not complete. In short: buy it....and then buy a second copy to donate to your local library so others can see what a truly great show Doctor Who was and is!!!

On a personal note this is my last review on Classic Doctor Who and I just wanted to thank Who fans every where (even those I have disagreed with) for supporting this fantastic show that is (in my opinion) the greatest television show of all time. If you like Doctor who than that means you ""get"" Doctor Who. And if you ""get it"" that means you are an intelligent, multi dimensional thinker who can see beyond the everyday. And if you are this type of person than the world is a much, much better  place with you in it........
