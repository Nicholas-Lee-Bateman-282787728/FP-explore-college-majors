8214747,5,B000UTBPUK,"One of Andy Milligan's more ""upbeat"" films (very rare for him!), that can be a little too 80's at times. Its still a really fun film. If you've never watched Andy Milligan movies, or enjoyed any that you might have seen, you would be better off avoiding this. You'll probably hate it.

Comparing it to other works from him, it's not as strong in direction and story. It's a little goofy, even by Andy's standards. It goes full Milligan in the last 20 minutes of the film though (ultra violent!), so that's a plus. It's still a worthy addition to any Milligan fan's collection!",1432252800,,576,4.538461538461538

Well, this movie definitely lives up to it's title. It's weird as [...]!!! Imagine if Forrest Gump and that retard from SLING BLADE were brothers, but they had a third, more retarded brother. His name would be Donnie and this is his story...

Donnie is dumb as a bag of retarded hamsters and he lives with a nice old lady who takes care of him. He spends a lot of time walking around in the woods collecting [...]. There's also a gang of local tough guy's who beat him up every once and a while. One day while out wandering around a creek a teenage girl wearing leg braces comes up to him and just starts talking. Her name is Jenny (just like Gump's girlfriend) and soon they are inseparable. Nothing really happens for a long time, just your standard soap opera stuff (retarded philosophy, clumsy sexual fumblings, priest copping a feel of Jenny, etc.), but yet I couldn't stop watching. The entire time I felt there was something sinister lurking just below the surface...and I was right! During the third act the movie goes from zero to [...] Insane in the blink of an eye and it just gets wilder and wilder until finally at the end it blows it's retarded load all over the place!

One afternoon Donnie is forced to go visit his [...] of a mom and she tries to sell him to some creepy guy so Donnie goes [...] bonkers and beats the [...] out of her then chops her head off and stabs the dude through the neck with a rake. After that he goes on a [...] rampage and kills pretty much everybody in the movie! Even the people that were nice to him. It was [...] great! I was laughing so hard my sides hurt. Especially his final act with his girlfriend. I literally yelled ""Holy [...]!!!"" so loud my neighbors probably heard me.

I'm not saying you should watch this movie (so don't send me a bunch of hate mail saying I'm stupid). This movie is a piece of [...], but I actually enjoyed it and would love to watch it in a crowded theater full of bad movie junkies.

If you are looking for a THE WEIRDO drinking game: take a shot every time somebody gets slapped. This movie is [...] slap happy.",1273104000,2,2160,4.349875930521092
