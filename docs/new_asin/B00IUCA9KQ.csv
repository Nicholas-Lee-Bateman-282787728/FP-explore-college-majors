6297367,3,B00IUCA9KQ,Buttwhistle is a strange movie in that it seems to have some rather large plot holes. I guess what bugs me the most is the negativity. I watched this movie on the strength of seeing Analeigh Tipton (Crazy Stupid Love) as a costar.,1433894400,,230,4.372093023255814
6297368,2,B00IUCA9KQ,I love Trevor Morgan but this movie was very confusing and the acting besides Trevor was very bad. There was a lot the I didn't understand and honestly my friend and I only made it half way through the movie.,1429315200,2,208,4.225
6297369,2,B00IUCA9KQ,"A part of my brain shriveled and fell out of my nose as this film rolled to an end. The other person reviewing this obviously has some sort of crush on the failed child star doof playing the pushover lead roll. This movie makes little sense, follows no structural guideline, and ends with two cops talking about putting things I eachothers places in their car.. No explanation to the story climax or how we got from point A to B, just two cops chatting about finger blasting eachother. I gave it two stars instead of one because the actors aren't completely horrible and the female lead( who I think was a figment of the leads imaginations, not sure how she died or who she was for that matter) is gorgeous, fully clothed the entire film unfortunately, but gorgeous. A drunk director mixed up the pages of this script, lost a few and phoned it in. Watch it at your own risk I guess.",1427241600,8,882,4.41717791411043

8645512,1,B00IUCA9KQ,"This was a terrible movie in my opinion! Not one I recommend or would watch again. I even wound up selling it at Trades Mart!! I guess I made the mistake of buying it before watching it. It was mostly because I am a fan of Trevor Morgan, but didn't realize how terrible it was until watching it.",1477612800,,295,4.103448275862069
8645513,5,B00IUCA9KQ,"Just because you don't understand a film, doesn't make it bad. There are a number  of ways to interpret Buttwhistle. At face value this is simply a movie about a good hearted college kid ,Ogden played by Trevor Morgan who's  girlfriend Rose played by Analeigh Tipton dies of cancer, yet he gets on with life the best he can. In his effort to help anyone and everyone, Ogden saves the life of a suicidal runaway Beth played by Elizabeth Rice. Beth ingrains herself into Ogden's life while the ghost of the dead girlfriend periodically appears and offers Ogden advice or commentary, Beth slowly begins to exhibit psychotic behavior, from cutting up old photos , throwing a selection off his clothes away and stealing his cash. In the end she goes as far  as framing him for a double homicide. If this is your version of the movie then yes it might move a little slow and seem a lot like Fatal Attraction without the thrill of boiling bunnies.
There are however different ways of  viewing this same material.  Ogden is slowly coming to terms with the loss of his girlfriend and is coping by imagining she appears to him and encourages his moving on with his life. He rescues the missing daughter of a rich prominent executive who may have been fleeing from blowing up her daddy's head at the time. Beth decides to hide out with the good natured Ogden, but her own psychosis makes her begin to repeat past behavior. She damages the family car, steals money and cons her daddy substitute's friends. As Ogden begins to catch on to her duplicitous actions she does the double homicide and frames him to get rid of him and move on. I guess that's better than having your head blown clean off.
Still a third way to interpret this film is the occasionally cross-dressing Ogden is not quite sane. He's never had a girlfriend at all but both Rose and Beth are aspects of his own personality. sort of the angel and devil on his shoulders. He tries to suppress Beth the his own bad side to the point of imaging wrapping her face with duct tape. In the end those bad instincts win out and he kills two of the young women who he has seen in the neighborhood , but found unapproachable for various reasons.
Any one of these could be what Buttwhistle is actually about. Or none of them. There is evidence here to support all of these ideas and more. What some folks are seeing as shoddy film making with a story that wanders and makes no sense,might try to  open your minds and let a movie challenge you to put the pieces together/. If you are looking for a romantic comedy where boy meets girl and hilarious complications ensue, or an action flick with lots of explosions and plot holes you could drive a Buick through truly this is not that movie. If you enjoy a movie that will challenge your perception no matter how many times you watch it. then give writer and director', Tenney Fairchild's, Buttwhistle a viewing. (or two or three)",1469923200,,2920,4.510396975425331

8645516,1,B00IUCA9KQ,"Buttwhistle is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The plot line goes nowhere. Trevor Morgan is stuck in a dead end movie. If you have paid fifty cents for this movie, you have paid too much. Pass this one up. I had to fast forward through this terrible tripe.",1460246400,2,266,4.134615384615385

8645518,5,B00IUCA9KQ,"A truly amazing movie.

Most movies are terrible.  They lack substance, and yet still have to spend an hour and a half spoon feeding a whole lot of nothing to the audience.  This movie isn't one of those movies.

Deep down, the plot appears pretty simple: don't scorn a woman.  But the telling of that simple plot is simply amazing.  And I've only watched it once.  I could have completely misinterpreted the movie!

EDIT: after sleeping on it, this isn't a movie simply about scorn.  This is a movie about a cruel woman who sabotages a man's life just because she feels trapped, but she is only trapped because she feels like she owes him.  He's a nice guy though, and doesn't think she owes him anything.  So, like any woman would, she moves in with him, ethers his grandmother, etc.  He just smiles and carries on like everything is fine.",1453161600,2,841,4.496688741721854
8645519,4,B00IUCA9KQ,"An unusual film.  i'm still not sure what it was about, but it  was  entertaining.  The guy seems to have a ghost and a girlfriend.  What's happening is another question.  But it is an  enjoyable journey with some laughs.",1447718400,,221,4.512820512820513
