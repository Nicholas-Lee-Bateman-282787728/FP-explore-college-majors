4464285,4,B004SQFRZA,"The real value is the numerous recordings by the actual people: Oscar Levant, Paul Whiteman, Anne Brown, and others.

I read a review that said that the movie is not true to history, which is unfortunate, since telling the actual history would be far more interesting at this point than telling a good story.  But I bought it for the historical recordings and was not disappointed.",1348876800,,381,4.757575757575758

4464287,3,B004SQFRZA,Rhapsody in Blue I had recorded it serveral days ago on my dvr ans decided to watch it after about 30 mins I turn it off because I thought it was boring and in some parts it was. I think about 30 mins could have been cut from it and the movie would have been just fine.  The Love interests in the film according to Robert Osborn of TCM network said it was fictional & he was a lady's man to be sure. However music was his whole life and the viewer like myself kept thinking he never reach his zenith and was always searching for perfection which never came. It is a good film for those who like history and music.,1342396800,,613,4.024590163934426
4464288,4,B004SQFRZA,This New DVD has no Chapter list in the menu?  Why would someone not include this in the menu?  The only options are Play and Trailer.,1336953600,,134,4.115384615384615
4464289,4,B004SQFRZA,"At one time or another we've probably all wished to look in the eye of the person in charge and ask something like, ""what the hell were you thinking man?""

The decision of distributing a ""duplicated"" (DVD-R) rather than the normal ""replicated"" DVD-V was put into the hands of a human being (though these days we can never be sure) whom it seems decided that he would save the company some $$$ by duplicating a small batch at a time rather than having a short run of 500 replicated. Aside from the fact that we're talking about a major film about a major American composer with a cast of major stars, the economics of a decision like this is imbecilic.

The manufacturing costs of DVDs and CDs today are incredibly low. (I'm not referring to the content costs, which can run into the millions, so you pirates out there aren't getting any help from me.) Anyone off the street can get 500 replicated DVDs, with a full color cover in a standard ""Amaray"" case, for under $1200.00. That's about $2.40 each for properly replicated DVDs, which have a very low failure rate and will be compatible with just about any player.

To have the same project ""duplicated""- i.e. run off just a few copies at a time - by a reputable business, costs somewhere between $2.50 and $8.00 for each copy, depending on how many are done at a time. Usually 300 copies will cost about $750.00, or about $2.50 each.

I guess the geniuses at whatever company is responsible for this amateurish sham (please tell me Warner wasn't responsible) not only decided that they'd never be able to sell a few hundred copies of Rhapsody, but that it's worth the trouble of having to deal with all of the returns that are sure to come, because DVD-Rs are very picky about which players they like. The DVD-R format is fine for passing out a very limited amount of copies within a business or family, etc. or testing projects - concerts, shows and the like - to see if everything is working properly before going to the final (replicated) DVD. But unless you know that you're dealing with something with such a limited amount of sales potential, going to DVD-R is just false economy. What a shame this company has so little faith in something they've decided to make available to us!

And a shame it is, for what a marvelous treat to have this film available. Yes, sometimes the script gets a little too gushy for our 2012 tastes. The constant smiles, everybody so agreeable with each other, especially early on, might cause a few eyeballs to roll. And staying a bit more faithful (but less entertaining?) to some historical facts might be nice. But we're dealing with Hollywood here, so considering what else they give us; it's really a small price to pay to witness so much brilliant performing. Seeing and hearing the likes of Hazel Scott, a major leaguer both vocally and at the piano, was astonishing. The short sequence from Porgy and Bess with Anne Brown, who starred in the original production, singing Summertime is worth the price of admission by itself. Hearing and seeing Al Jolson, in his prime (even though his performing in ""blackface"" will be a turnoff for some) reminds us that he really could sing. I never realized what a great low register he actually had. The orchestral performances, even though truncated, were excellent. Indeed, they hold up very well over 60 years later. Though watching Paul Whitman, with what looked like a 4-foot long baton, as stiff as could be was a scream! The mono sound is very listenable.

I not only found Robert Alda a credible George Gershwin, but also was amazed watching him at the piano. While there were some places where it looked a bit fishy, they tended to be the ones where you couldn't see his fingers. Maybe his shoulders weren't quite moving with the direction of the music. However when he was entirely visible, including fingers, it was so convincing that I couldn't believe Oscar Levant was actually on the sound track. And listen to Oscar's performances. Even though he was such a character, his playing contained none of the affectations that we have grown accustomed to with our current crop of wunderkinds. Performances by Charles Coburn and Joan Leslie, who had a lovely singing voice, were also credible. But first and foremost we're reminded that there's a good reason why Gershwin's music is as alive today as it was 80 years ago.",1336867200,2,4361,4.679269882659713

4464291,3,B004SQFRZA,"This movie is allegedly the life story of George Gershwin. Why (tell me, please) when a biography of a composer is presented in chronological order cannot the music be likewise chronologically correct? Example: The Gershwin family are living in a rather luxurious apartment on Riverside Drive (after countless slum dwellings in Brooklyn and The Bronx), paid for entirely by income from Gershwin's various song successes, the most recent of which (seen in a lavish production number) is ""'S Wonderful."" Then, later on, we see brother Ira fooling around with lyrics and George thinks it's a great idea for them to collaborate. Excuse me, Ira, but weren't you the one who wrote the ""'S Wonderful"" lyrics? I thought so!

In the movie, there are only two Gershwin offspring: Ira and George. Whatever happened to brother Arthur and sister Frances? (Ira's first lyrics were written under the pseudonym of ""Arthur Francis,"" a name derived from the two other siblings, so as not to appear to be cashing in on George's success.) I wonder how they felt about being completely written out of existence? In similar fashion, Fred and Adele Astaire, for whom at least three shows were specifically written, no longer exist. However, two ""love interests"" are there. Okay, so George purportedly had a 10-year ""affair"" with composer Kay Swift, and supposedly a fling with actress Paulette Goddard. But as far as I'm concerned, he was a closet homosexual, something which, if true, brother Ira would have denied vehemently. (In fact, I believe he did, in print, many years later. At any rate, George certainly wasn't pursuing the two women in the movie!)

The music, of course, is the main and perhaps sole asset of the movie. The writing and too often the acting sucks. Unfortunately, due to time limitations, his major compositions -- ""Rhapsody in Blue,"" ""An American in Paris,"" ""Concerto in F"" -- are all truncated. There's a running bit with George's father timing each composition and saying such things as ""Fourteen minutes. A very important composition!"" He says this about the rhapsody...except that if they hadn't shortened it for the movie, it would have been closer to 20 minutes. (The premiere performance lasted longer than the usual 17 minutes because a whole section which would later be cut was still included.)

""An American in Paris"" is the only Gershwin concert work that doesn't include a piano part. (There's a brief celeste solo in the blues section, which Gershwin himself played on the premiere recording since they'd forgotten to hire anyone.) In the film, when the piece is first performed, there are two pianos and pianists onstage. Wonder what they were playing...?

But the movie does end with that shot of the camera looking down on Oscar Levant's hands as he's playing the rhapsody, then craning up and up until the entire Lewissohn Stadium and its packed audience are a speck on the landscape. (I remembered it as the Hollywood Bowl, but hey, it was 50 years ago when I first saw this film!)",1333497600,2,3004,4.954365079365079

4464298,5,B004SQFRZA,"I found this to be the best ""print"" of this film I have ever seen.  Most people carp at the fact that this is a fictionalized account of Gerswhin's life...what biopic isn't fictionalized?  But the ""big"" facts are all accurate.  Relationships -- particularly love interests -- are are the main fiction elements.  But when I saw this movie on late-night TV at age 14 it spawned a deep interest in Gershwin, to begin with, then the entire world of classical music beyond...to the ""tune"" of about 30,000 tracks of the stuff.  So, fiction or not, this film was a milestone in my life -- 60 years ago (when it was already 25 years old).",1470873600,,630,4.491228070175438

4464302,3,B004SQFRZA,"This film succeeds well as entertainment but is sorely lacking as biography or history.  Robert Alda is convincing and appealing as George Gershwin.  Joan Leslie is wonderful as ""Julie.""  In fact, aside from the full performance of the Rhapsody in Blue, Joan Leslie's ""Somebody Loves Me"" is perhaps the most appealing number and seems to convey much of the original spirit of this '20s song.  Also, Hazel Scott is fantastic as always.  Speaking of this, though, a big problem for me is the way in which authentic '20s and '30s women's styles -- clothes, hair, and make-up -- are sometimes half-heartedly approximated but, more often, ignored all together.  In some scenes, such as the first big party in Paris, a clumsy but laudable effort is made to show '20s style dresses -- ostrich feathers and bangles and the like -- although the dresses are fitted more '40s style and the hair is never bobbed but just bunched and piled to look shortish but still basically '40s in its effect.  In other places, such as on stage, the situation is far worse.  The chorus girls looked like they were emulating not Clara Bow or Louise Brooks but rather Rita Hayworth!  No film that I know of really started to get the '20s until ""Singin' in the Rain"" in 1952.  In summary, there's a lot that's good in this film, but I'm still waiting for a movie that captures the wonderful spirit and look of the times in which George Gershwin was doing his most important creating.",1466208000,,1454,4.666666666666667

4464345,4,B004SQFRZA,"While this film presents a highly fictionalized account of George Gershwin's life, the recreations of numerous performances of his incomparable music preserved here are very important. Highlights include Gershwin's operetta 'Blue Monday,' cut from a review show after only one performance; Al Jolson introducing 'Swanee' to his adoring audience; Paul Whiteman, who commissioned 'Rhapsody in Blue,' conducting the original arrangement for piano and band from its debut at Aeolian Hall; Anne Brown, the original Bess, singing 'Summertime' onstage surrounded by the sets from 'Porgy and Bess'; extensive excerpts from orchestral works 'Concerto in F,' 'An American in Paris,' and the lesser-known 'Cuban Overture'; and of course many sublime Gershwin songs, well-known and obscure. Oscar Levant, concert pianist and friend of the Gershwins who plays himself in the film, recorded the Gershwin piano numbers for lead actor Robert Alda, and there was no one better qualified at that time to embody Gershwin's technique and dynamics. The script was a victim of the era: The fact that Gershwin was Jewish is strictly avoided, several other details on his life are inaccurate, and Gershwin the legendary womanizer is replaced by a man torn between two fictional females. But the great virtue of this movie is the lavish amount of time spent presenting George Gershwin's music: the expectations for an audience's attention in the 1940s could help nurture more respect for the art of music today. There are sadly no DVD extras on the making of the film, and no commentary. Robert Alda is curiously listed last in the credits online, even though he is featured in nearly every scene from George Gershwin's adult years.",1391126400,4,1707,5.302583025830258
4464346,5,B004SQFRZA,"Some customer reviews have done this long-overdue and gloriously welcome DVD a gross injustice by posting warnings that it is supposedly an inferior bootleg, pirated DVD or supposedly a foreign-produced DVD with annoying Japanese subtitles.  Don't believe it..

That's total baloney -- perhaps caused by Amazon inadvertently posting customer reviews that related to earlier, bootleg copies during the agonizingly long 15-year wait for this truly great musical to be legitimately re-released by Warner Brothers on a high-quality DVD.  Those totally outdated reviews should be removed from the Amazon Website.

On the contrary this is the genuine article direct from the major Hollywood studio that made the film in 1945-- labelled as a ""remastered"" DVD re-released in 2012 by Warner Brothers as part of their ""Warner Brothers Archive"" series.  True, it's not Blu-Ray, but it is a high-quality DVD transfer.

I held off buying this priceless gem of a movie for two years because of those reviews that erroneously warned people not to buy a supposedly bootleg copy.  Those erroneous reviews caused me to lose two years of sheer pleasure, after waiting so long.

It even includes what appears to be the original ten-minute ""overture,"" -- a lush, symphonic medley of Gershwin's greatest melodies which was shown on a black screen before the curtain rose, but only in the first-run ""movie palaces"" at the end of World War Two when the film was first released.  Those who saw it 70 years ago in small neighborhood theaters and second-run theaters probably never heard the overture, which beautifully sets the scene and the mood for the film..  The overture treatment was reserved for just a few of Hollywood's biggest blockbusters like ""Gone With the Wind.""  So it's probably no coincidence that the man given credit for the film's orchestrations was none other than Max Steiner, the legendary Hollywood film composer who won enormous acclaim for his memorable score for ""Gone With the Wind.""  The sparkling sound quality on this overture sounds like an original track that may have been stereo-enhanced for DVD release.  The sound on the rest of the film, including the music, is quite good,considering the film's 70-year age.  The picture quality apparently is not digitally restored, but it was ""remastered"" and therefore is surprisingly good.

Gershwin experts may quibble.with some of the dramatic liberties the screenplay takes with Gershwin's life, as most biopics do.  But it's still a really great story.  And those who think Hollywood has forgotten how to do really great movie endings will get goosebumps from the great closing scene where a supposed broadcast of one of Gershwin's great symphony compositions is interrupted by the conductor to announce to radio listeners around the world that Gershwin has just died from a brain tumor.  When the orchestra resumes playing, the camera -- in one of ""Old Hollywood's"" best special effects endings -- gradually rises above the stadium and soars above the clouds as the symphony orchestra continues playing to signify that ""now he belongs to the ages.""  I guarantee a lump in the throat. They just don't make 'em like that anymore.

One of the best reasons to view this film is to see historic performances by some of the greatest artists associated with Gershwin's music -- the actual people themselves -- including Gershwin's champion and close friend, pianist Oscar Levant (who helped to popularize ""Rhapsody in Blue"").......legendary bandleader Paul Whiteman (the man whose jazz orchestra first introduced ""Rhapsody in Blue""....George White, the producer of ""George White's Scandals,"" a series of long-running Broadway ""reviews"" in the 1920s and 1930s.........the legendary Ann Brown (the African-American singer who originated the role of Bess in ""Porgy and Bess"" and who first sang that role on Broadway)....Hazel Scott, the famous jazz pianist of the 1930s and 1940s....and the legendary Al Jolson (who gave Gershwin his first big break by singing Gershwin's alltime biggest pop hit,  the minstrel song ""Swanee""....in blackface, no less.  The blackface may offend some viewers -- but the film would not have been historically accurate without it.

The film is in black-and-white, which probably adds greatly to the mood and the feel of verisimilitude, since it deals largely with a time in the 1920s and early 1930s before Technicolor became popular.

The film is a roller-coaster ride through dozens of great Gershwin compositions as it follows his career from early jazz and Broadway show tunes to classical music.  It just may be the single best film Hollywood ever made about the life of a composer.  This film is one to cherish in your home video archive.  Grab it quick -- lest it go out of print again for another 15 years..",1389744000,37,4789,5.169689119170984
4464347,4,B004SQFRZA,"This very long (for its time) picture is memorable more for its musical content than its motion picture artistry, but it is a compelling view backwards in time.  The direction of Irving Rapper is discreet and unmemorable, most of the interest being contributed by familiar character actors such as Charles Coburn and Oscar Levant, playing himself.  Robert Alda, as Gershwin, is not persuasive, though he mimes well at the piano.  But it is fascinating to see such Broadway and Hollywood musical personalities as Al Jolson, Paul Whiteman and of course Levant playing themselves.  The music, including an overture, is superbly played and recorded, and worth the price of admission, and the final shot, an infinite track back into the stratosphere, the sole memorable shot but also unforgettable.  Made in 1943 at around the same time as ""Mission to Moscow"", and similar in its photographic effects, the picture wasn't released until 1945.  It is a fascinating biopic, worth viewing with the equally historically dubious ""Night and Day"", by the indefatigable Michael Curtiz.",1389312000,2,1071,5.233918128654971

4464349,5,B004SQFRZA,"You cannot watch this film and come away dissatisfied. The punch line alone should send you home (or to sleep) at peace with the world. The punch line? The title song itself. You cannot listen to ""Rhapsody in Blue"" without filling you heart and mind with the wonders of creation, in this instance, from the corresponding heart and mind of George Gershwin. As a writer myself, I am always conscious of how one word follows another in order to create a meaningful sentence. And, a series of sentences to make a paragraph, and a chapter and, finally, a book. It is a wonder that George Gershwin put together this particular combination of notes to create a unique composition of music. Unique because it is remembered and will be remembered until the world is so changed as to be unrecognizable by today's standards.",1387584000,4,813,4.732394366197183

4464358,4,B004SQFRZA,"""Rhapsody in Blue"" is a fictionalized biography of American composer George Gershwin (Robert Alda) that traces Gershwin's rise from song plugger for a Manhattan music publisher to the heights of fame.  After his first hit, ""Swanee"" -- performed here by the man who introduced it, Al Jolson -- Gershwin turns out hit after hit for Broadway and the movies along with his brother Ira (Herbert Rudley).

While pursuing tentative romances with fictional women, musical comedy star Julie Adams (Joan Leslie) and socialite Christine Gilbert  (Alexis Smith), George composes such classics as ""An American in Paris,"" and ""Porgy and Bess.""

The film co-stars Gershwin's longtime friend, pianist Oscar Levant as himself. Though hardly a definitive biography, ""Rhapsody in Blue"" contains terrific music, including the songs ""Embraceable You,"" ""Fascinating Rhythm,"" ""I Got Rhythm,"" ""It Ain't Necessarily So,"" ""Liza,"" ""The Man I Love,"" and ""S' Wonderful.""  There are no bonus extras on this DVD release.",1366502400,11,989,5.480263157894737

8440106,3,B004SQFRZA,"I was very disappointed.  I didn't much care for Robert Alda (who looks like his son, and was the original Sky Masterson in Guys and Dolls).  The dialog got very Hollywood-type meaningful.  All of the Rhapsody was played, I think.  Because of this movie, I'm going to listen to American in Paris again.  I never liked it before.  The excerpt from Porgy (the opening scene) was not done as it actually is.  I didn't like the remark that Gershwin would ""make opera entertaining"".  I always thought it was.  I really wish (a lot) there had been more songs in it.  Dates (like when songs were written) were all screwed up.  For instance, Gershwin wrote the tune for Love Walked In for a concert piece, but died before he used it.  Ira wrote the words after he died. The best parts (the only two good parts) to me were Jolson singing Swanee (a chance to see him actually perform).  And the wonderful song and dance of Somebody Loves Me.  The most significant thing in the flick to me was wondering how they made it look like Alda was playing the piano.  It was heavy on patriotism, family love, and something - the view of the sky (heaven?) that ended it.  Some real people played themselves in it.  Paul Whiteman, George White and Oscar Levant, among others.  I've always wondered what Levant felt and how he got through playing himself in this.  He and Gershwin were very good friends. Finally (I've got to say this) - it was silly watching a grinning Gershwin with a cigar in his mouth play arpeggios for a fascinated Ravel.  I think the whole 2 1/2 hour flick was not so much a make-believe bio-flick as a tribute to Gershwin.  Made with real affection.",1525564800,,1652,4.494949494949495

Oscar Levant(Gershwin's close friend in actual life)plays himself, adding a comic dose of irreverence for which he was famous.  There is also a great, impressionistic sequence to Gershwin's An American in Paris, which I'm certain influenced Gene Kelly's academy-award-winning version 6 years later(1951).",1524528000,,587,5.511111111111111
