He does not look well at all, and I am sure it was an effort for him to even make an appearance.  Stomach cancer is a horrible way to die, extremely painful, and no doubt ""Pappy"" Ford was experiencing pain and was even perhaps on pain-killers.  This aside, the show is memorable for those who were there to honor the great director, and winner of 6 Oscars for directing.  Guest stars included an all-star cast of Clint Eastwood, Henry Fonda, Cary Grant, Charlton Heston, Jack Lemmon, Lee Marvin, Roddy McDowall, Maureen O'Hara, Rosalind Russell, Steven Spielberg, George Stevens, Jr., James Stewart, Leslie Uggams, Robert Wagner, John Wayne, and Richard Widmark. Richard Nixon, President at the time also salutes Mr. Ford.  Knowing that death was imminent, many of the guests were quite emotional in their tributes, with Maureen O'Hara and John Wayne tearing up noticeably.  Wayne loved Ford, despite Ford's harsh treatment of him on movie sets.  Wayne always credited his film success to John Ford, who launched his career in Stagecoach.

This will appeal to the older crowd who still remembers the great movies and stars of the past.

I recommend anything besides this show. I wish I had known and spent the money on fly paper. Seriously, BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD!!!",1109289600,,291,4.214285714285714
