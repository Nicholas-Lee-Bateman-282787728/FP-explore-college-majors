8232996,1,B000YIT4ZU,"As a beginner, the only portion of this dvd that I found helpful was his instruction regarding the forehand and backhand grip.  That was about 1 minute's worth of the entire video albeit clear and concise. The format for the video consists of watching Shane Vanderson practice his favorite drills.  There is no instruction on this video, only watching him as he hits the ball. His target audience is unclear.  However, it is clearly not for a beginner. He does not cover equipment, rules, positioning, serves, strategy, nothing but how to properly grip the racquet. I can't see how an intermediate or advanced player can find this helpful because he does not get into techniques or strategy. He does show how to use tape on the wall as a method of practicing aiming shots, another one-minute-worth instruction.  Otherwise, we watch as he simply calls out his shots and counts how many he gets out of a set.  Vanderson may be an established player, but he does not exhibit any evidence of coaching or teaching skills or experience. I was so disappointed. Not only was it not helpful, now that I've opened it I cannot return for full refund. Waste of time and money.",1281916800,3,1164,4.714285714285714
