8428663,5,B004GEB6F4,"Just received my copy of Bittersweet Volume I and I have to say it is just that, bittersweet. There is so much raw energy and emotion in these performances it really showcases where Nathan was headed with his music before he died.

-------------------
Pros:

The live performances really spotlight the on-stage energy and emotion of Nathan and his songs, I got goose bumps watching the performance of ""Long Way Home"".

The music videos are done quite well, not sure what kind of footage was available since these videos seem to pull mostly from the live performances but combined with the studio recordings underneath they feel like a gratifying bonus.

The menus have tons of easter eggs for fans and friends of Nathan's, and can provide some insight to newbies with venues he played, pieces of songs playing in the background, I wish there was more notation on the disc or cover about what some of it means or where it's from.

The discography pages have 1 full song from each of Nathan's albums, which is really nice and they are interactive with the biography pages which is unique and thoughtful, it allows you to really track Nathan's growth as a songwriter and performer.

Cons:

The quality of some of the live performances can be a bit spotty but the disclaimer at the start of disc says something about these shows being taped for a different purpose and they cleaned up the audio and visuals best they could.

Watching on an older TV doesn't do the disc justice, but I've seen disc from more established musicians that have the same problems with text interlacing and hot colors. I tried it on my laptop and WOW, the disc looked great even on my PC's HD settings.
Finally the biggest con, too short I want more!, Though the disc does say ""volume I"", hopefully there is a volume II coming.

If you want to watch a really phenomenal indie musician with some songs that can give the best of them, Springsteen, Dylan and Cash a run for their money, this is a must have in your collection.",1293667200,,2017,4.659154929577465
