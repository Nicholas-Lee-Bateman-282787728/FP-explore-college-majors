3417975,3,B0018ODXYC,"Its pretty much what you would expect from the all-american band that kicked your aszz on the first dvd. Its a must for any true LOG fan, but i have a few complaints about it. The live set-list is great, but for the awesome amount of songs LOG does well, you get 8 or so here, repeated over 2 discs. I love the documentary process and seeing the behind the scenes of the band, but i also want to see the live experences of the new cd and such. The set list isn't listed on the outside of the case, and once i bought it and opened it, i realized the same songs are repeated live on each disc...eh...somewhat of a let down for someone that is looking for a 5.1 live dvd representation of what LOG is truely about...METAL.",1215302400,,719,4.142857142857143
3417976,5,B0018ODXYC,"'Walk With Me In Hell' is an awesome 2 disc dvd set of tour footage,live performances and a new documentary. Truly a no brainer 'WWMIH' is packed with fun, metal and lots of laughs. Not to mention precision playing from our favorite virginians. Clocking in at 2 hours 'WWMIH'(the doc) chronicles the tours in support of 'Sacrament'. You see the boys trekking all over Europe playing to large and larger audiences. With killer support from countries they have never even played in. Gone is the fist fights and drunken stupor....well not totally. There is some boozing and slapping. Where the 'Killadelphia' DVD is more of a concert than documentary, 'WWMIH' is the storytelling of 5 guys in support of 'Sacrament' their lastest album. As well as the doc you also get them performing live from all over the world. TOP NOTCH!
Disc 2 continues the splendor with 'The Making Of Sacrament' which was released as a special edition on the album. Certainly a must see if you don't already own it. Clocking in at about 77min. you go through the whole creation process with Machine(producer) and the boys. You also get the video for 'Redneck' as well as 'The Making Of' which is very cool.
Then there is about 40 min. of deleted scenes from the documentary which is very, very funny. Check out the boys playing 'The Family Feud'......governor.......governor. Then what everyone seems to be buzzing about...the full set of Lamb Of God at the Download Festival.
This is where they prove that they are at the TOP OF THEIR GAME. With a stunning and blistering performance in front of 70,000+ rabid fans. Playing such rockers as 'Pathetic','Blacken The Cursed Sun','Now You've Got Something To Die For, as well as 'Walk With Me In Hell' you will learn why they are now the target as C. Adler stated. Props go out once again to the man with the cam............Mr Doug Spangenberg who also did 'Killadelphia' and ""the Making Of Sacrament'. Excellent job he has done again. So after nearly 2 years on the road LOG gets a break. And they deserve it. All their hard work and persistence has payed off.......the result is this DVD. The only downside is the setlist on both discs are almost identical.",1215129600,8,2178,4.764550264550264
3417977,3,B0018ODXYC,"Most everything that made Killadelphia a gripping watch is missing here.

On the main feature I miss interactions with the road crew. Additional remarks, observations and musings that were filmed a day or so after the events have been replaced with studio shots the look they were filmed after the tour was over. I thought that gave it a sterile feel to it. There is little to no drama build up. Just guys hanging out, doing some silly things, hanging with fans, seeing the world and catching it all on tape.. if it sounds like a nicely edited vacation tape you might find akin to a wedding video you're on the right track. Sadly, just like that wedding video, I cant see myself replaying the main feature very often.

""The Making of Sacrament"" footage is the same as the DVD you get in the deluxe CD package, which was a lot of fun as you get into the creative process of the band. In fact, watching this right after Killadelphia is very satisfying. You see each band member out of the band element and again its interesting to watch.

The big draw here is the live sets. Showing the band on in top form with bigger and bigger crowds. The Download set is amazing and worth ripping to your ipod.

The DVD is good but could have been so much better. If you had to choose, Killadalphia is the better choice. This one can wait.",1214956800,4,1324,4.391836734693878
3417978,5,B0018ODXYC,"Killadelphia was a perfect dvd to compliment Lamb Of God not only for their live performance, but the honest ""warts n' all"" portrayal of the band during the documentary footage (see infamous Glasgow fistfight for example). Here we are 3 years later after the release of Killadelphia, and we now have Walk With Me In Hell, a 2 hour documentary on the release of the much anticipated Sacrament and the tour that followed. While there's not so much fighting or drama here like Killadelphia, this dvd doesn't shy away from the realism. If 2 hours isn't enough for you, extras include live performances, plus the complete show from the 2007 Download festival, the making of Sacrament (the same documentary featured on the bonus dvd included in the special edition of Sacrament, perfect for anybody that doesn't have it), the official video for Redneck, and making of the video. While there are other killer band dvd's that are out (Unearth, God Forbid) and coming out (Cannibal Corpse, Nevermore) this year, this is simply one to get.",1214870400,12,1029,4.885714285714286
3417979,5,B0018ODXYC,"Anyone who has seen Lamb of God knows what to expect from them. These guys are at the top of the hardcore genre. Live they're one of the best acts around. Finally America has someone to cheer about. If this DVD is anything like ""Killadelphia"",it's well worth your time..",1214092800,2,270,4.530612244897959
3417980,5,B0018ODXYC,"Enjoyed the interviews, studio time, live sessions, and everything else on these discs. Buy it, better than most new movies out there!",1369353600,,134,5.136363636363637
3417981,5,B0018ODXYC,"If you even like the band a little bit, you must buy this DVD. It's a great doc of the band's progress and development. I enjoyed the entirety of the DVD.
The extras aren't new; from memory they all came with the special Sacrament cd album release.
Still, a very worthwhile purchase.",1323734400,3,283,4.461538461538462
3417982,5,B0018ODXYC,"THANK GOD!! Finally a bands concert footage that isn't 3 hours of walking through airports, setting up gigs, and pratical jokes/wastes of time.  This video really lets you into the band and you feel the struggles of the road, plus there are some hillerous moments.  This is by far my favorite band of all time and this video delivered on all ends, after you watch the actually tour dvd you pop in the second disk and watch the download festival set and making of sacrament, its like a whole different movie, they could have easily of split those 2 disks into 2 dvds and sold them seperatly but the fact that they threw it all together shows how much love they have for their fan base.",1310860800,,684,4.420634920634921
3417983,5,B0018ODXYC,I RECENTLY BECAME A BIG FAN OF THESE GUYS. GREAT DVD AND SONGS. IT GIVE A PREVIEW OF WHAT THEY ARE LIKE LIVE IN CONCERT. I'D HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DVD TO ANYONE,1297382400,,160,4.03125
3417984,5,B0018ODXYC,"Walk With Me in Hell is a fantastic DVD for fans of Lamb of God, full of honest and informative interviews, storming live performances and footage from all around the world.
The DVD features four and a half hours of content; including The main feature, the 117 minute documentary `Walk With Me in Hell ,' as well as six entire live songs from various tours that were featured in the documentary. The Second disc features the fantastic 77 minute `Making of The Sacrament,' documentary,' and an entire 40 minute Set from Download and lastly the music video for Redneck.
The main documentary is brilliant, following the band from just having finished recording their fantastic Sacrament album and embarking on a world tour full of interesting encounters, mishaps and mild adventures. Interviews unravel a tale of ups and downs, of bad luck and of increasing success and really give you an idea of what life is like for a touring metal band. From adjusting to foreign food, being cut of from your family and living in a cramped bus with band and crew members for months on end to photo shoots merch signing sessions and radio interview obligations.
The band are both really candid and entertaining, giving honest impressions of situations and not being afraid to look bad, while also cracking many jokes or playing a few childish pranks that never fail to raise a few laughs. Where some band DVDs may over emphasize the comedy aspects, Walk With Me In Hell is very tasteful and has the balance just right.
The whole documentary is full of Lamb of God music, both recorded versions playing over footage of busses or set ups, and snippets of excellently shot concert footage that can last up to a minute or two.
Redneck, Again We Rise, Walk With Me in Hell, Now You've Got Something To Die For, Blacken The Cursed Sun, and Pathetic can be seen in full from these various performances featured in the documentary, a nice way to augment Killadelphia without repeating it.
`Making of The Sacrament,' documentary is of the same very high standard, and features a lot of the decision making processes, actual song writing and much footage of practicing and perfecting songs that would eventually make up the album. The band also talk a lot about their place in the world of metal, their music and how each album differs from the last, very interesting stuff for a fan to watch.
The Download set is a real highlight here, the excellent audio and visual quality and extremely energetic performance by the band make for an amazing show. The track list is: Laid To Rest, Again We Rise, Walk With Me in Hell, Pathetic, Now You've Got Something To Die For, Blacken The Cursed Sun, Redneck, and Black Label.
Overall this DVD is highly recommended to fans of the band, featuring tones of content, really interesting documentaries and very well shot, edited and performed live material focusing heavily on The Sacrament album so as not to just repeat the band's previous two DVDs.",1288137600,,2960,4.771929824561403
3417985,5,B0018ODXYC,"Great DVD.
It came quickly and was wrapped in plastic, all nice and new.
Only problem I had with it was that it skipped near the beginning of the movie and took me back to the dvd menu.
It only happened once though, so, I believe it was just my old PS2 being an old PS2.
If you love Lamb of God, or documentaries, buy this.
Seriously.",1286496000,,334,4.0
3417986,5,B0018ODXYC,Amazing DVD over 5 Hours of Lamb Of God and I only paid $11.00 plush shipping for this DVD well worth the money and cheaper then buying it from the bands website. Definitely worth checking out if you are a Lamb Of God Fan.,1270598400,,222,4.068181818181818
3417987,4,B0018ODXYC,"this is a great dvd for anyone who likes LOG, 4 hrs of music and candid footage of the band and thier crew, backstage, on-stage, on the bus etc..
I would reccomend it to any metal fan.",1269561600,,184,4.0

3417989,5,B0018ODXYC,"Amazing. The performance is great, especially walk with me in hell. The making of DVD is just fun to watch, and it really gives you a good insight into the recording process. The documentary is a complete knockout. I can watch it over and over again without getting tired of it. I've come to love the guys in teh band like I actually knew them. John and Willy just seem like such funny guys, and they seem like they would be great to hang out with. I'm not a die hard fan in the slightest, in fact I didn't even really like LoG all that much when I picked this dvd up. I had just seen a trailer on youtube and decided to give it a try. It was worth every penny. BUY THIS NOW, WHETHER YOUR A CASUAL FAN OR NOT! It is one of the best purchases I have ever made.",1242950400,,759,3.9673202614379086

3417991,4,B0018ODXYC,"They are the quintessential METAL band of today. If you're already a fan of this band, this is a must have DVD. Only about 40 minutes of a actual concert show, but a good selection of songs none the less. The documentary gives you good insight into what makes this band tick. HEAVY, HEAVY, and HEAVY, awesome guitar riffs, unbelievable drums, and the vocals took me a little while to get used to, but Randy knows how to growl. Buy this DVD NOW.",1229212800,,444,4.36144578313253
3417992,2,B0018ODXYC,"This DVD is OK but definitely not a must have. If you like LOG, fine. If you're semi-fan, don't even go there and buy it. Cheap production overall, not worth the money. Sure, there are 2 DVDs so you may perceive it to be a good deal but the second DVD is the one you already own if you bought Sacrament Spc. Ed.

Listening to them bitching about touring conditions gets annoying after a while. Well it's metal you're playing, if you want thefancy hotels with superb logistics at concerts, convert to orchestra.",1219968000,2,510,4.483870967741935
3417993,5,B0018ODXYC,"It's a lot of footage, but they do well to keep it interesting.  The group dynamics and individual lives and personalities are great to see.  And the music is phenomenal, they kick serious butt live!",1218240000,,199,4.6571428571428575
3417994,5,B0018ODXYC,they have made another killer dvd  doesn't have as much live footage  but makes up for with the making of sacrament  and going into details of the band and their normal lives,1217462400,,174,4.375
3417995,5,B0018ODXYC,"If you like Lamb of God you'll love this video. It is an indepth look at the band, their lives inside the band aas well as outside, plus awsome footage of concerts,studio work,  and other cool stuff!",1217376000,,199,4.378378378378378
3417996,3,B0018ODXYC,"Killadelphia gave us quick glimpses of the life, and Walk With Me In Hell takes us through it. From some descriptions I wasn't expecting that much, but as always, the band delivers - the intensity, devotion, the unlucky times (could they be..cursed?) and the laughs (plenty of them - being that it's my home, I especially liked the segment about weird Swedish food). Overall it's a very entertaining ride - with downbeats and upbeats, but just a little sense of what it's like to be doing metal-shows on a three-month tour of the world.

I haven't had a chance to check out the Download-show yet, but I'm sure that won't disappoint either (could've been longer, but throw on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Killadelphia/dp/B00092ZM0W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Killadelphia</a>&nbsp;before this, and you'll have plenty). I'm also very glad that The Making Of Sacrament is included - a very informative and interesting documentary on the complete making of an album, that was unfortunately delivered on a bad disc, which doesn't work for me anymore. So - problem solved!

If you want to step into the world of Lamb Of God, see the Making Of-documentary first, and follow it with this main feature. You'll laugh, be intrigued, and rock out for sure.",1216252800,,1290,5.381188118811881
3417997,5,B0018ODXYC,"Once more the guys from Richmond Virginia slams you in the face with possibly the best metal DVD for 2008. It's just LOUD, great performance after great performance for one of the greatest American Metal Bands around. On top of the great DOWNLOAD concert you get access to a long and quite funny documentary of Lamb of God on Tour, the making of SACRAMENT plus live performances from Gigantour, The Unholy Alliance, Ozzfest and much more. A great DVD to my collection.",1216080000,,468,4.719512195121951
3417998,5,B0018ODXYC,All in all just an awesome DVD.  A gret follow-up to Killadelphia.  You won't be disappointed!!,1216080000,,95,4.875
3417999,4,B0018ODXYC,"Lamb of God is back with another DVD for fans to enjoy, this one chronicling their post-""Ashes"" ascension to Actual Fame with the release of their cd ""Sacrament."" While entertaining, and interesting to any fan of the now-mega metal band; it's no ""Killadelphia,"" and there's less intimacy with the band, as well as less live music overall.

The length is what should sell you on this... The DVD contains about 4 hours of material over two discs. There are two documentaries; one is generally about the band's touring endeavors and rise to metal stardom, the other is about the making of ""Sacrament,"" which was included in the special edition of that album. Also included are couple of versions of the video ""Redneck,"" and their live set at the Download Festival.

The Festival live set was a little short (but extremely well- recorded and edited), and the main documentary was more about a band ""making it"" than a band struggling. An ironic oft-repeated complaint by the band is how ""bad luck follows them around,"" and then they get nominated for a grammy. Tough luck, yeah. Also no fist-fights (sort of... see below) in this one, Randy is on his best behavior throughout. On the plus side, the documentary had me howling with laughter a couple of times, especially the Campbell-Willie slap fight.

Again, if you like this band as much as most metalheads do, you will enjoy this vid. Highlight: live version of ""Blacken the Cursed Sun."" It's one of the heaviest songs ever, and the band knows it. It's an absolutely sick performance of a killer song.",1215993600,,1549,4.794007490636704
