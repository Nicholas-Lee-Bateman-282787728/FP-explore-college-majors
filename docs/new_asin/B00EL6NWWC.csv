5926875,5,B00EL6NWWC,"Outstanding Performance , all my favorite songs . Doug Henthorns back up vocals on JOCKEY FULL OF BOURBON  and DRIVING TOWARDS THE DAYLIGHT  add a mellower note to these song . The band  is having fun Carmine has a mile wide smile and the are really into the show .",1388707200,,265,4.26
5926876,5,B00EL6NWWC,"Although this is the last of the 4 night Tour de Force that I watched, it was actually the 3rd night of 4 that Bonamassa played in London in late March, 2013.  Joe starts out small with an acoustic guitar, his drummer Tal Bergman on bongos and keyboard player, Arlan Schierbaum.  On a darkened stage, the first 4 numbers or so are beautifully played but restrained.

When the rest of the band joins in, things really get rocking on ""Woke Up Dreaming.""  Most of the songs are Joe's and some, very familiar.  But he also covers Tom Waits, Howlin' Wolf, Led Zeppelin and ZZ Top's ""Just Got Paid"" which he blisters at the end of the show.  Like the other 3 shows in this 4 night experiment, this is a winner.

It sounds and looks excellent.  The concert runs 123 minutes and is presented in 1080p resolution and a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  The sound option includes DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and can and should be played very loud.  Direction is excellent with no dizzying jump edits.  Extras include a behind the scenes look, part 3 of ""making of..."" and a Hammersmith Apollo photo collection.",1388534400,,1084,4.536082474226804
5926877,5,B00EL6NWWC,Anyone who likes Joe Bonamassa can't be disappointed! Wish I could have afforded the other three also. It is just like being at his concert.,1388448000,,140,4.64
5926878,5,B00EL6NWWC,The best way to appreciate Joe Bonamassa is live. His CDs are great but his DVDs are a better way to get the feel of the music other than actually being there.,1388275200,,159,4.0
5926879,5,B00EL6NWWC,"Sorry for the title, I was just about to write this review and I saw a news story about 75 people injured when the pieces from ceiling of the historic Apollo Theater began to fall on the audience!! Actually, I can see how high intensity music in an old hall would shake the rafters (a stage play was actually happening when the ceiling collapsed)

Joe chose to record his Tour de Force videos at four historic venues - the Hammersmith Apollo being the night for Joe's Rock Show. I own all 4 of the dvds and this is my favorite.

This is my favorite Tour de Force DVD - or maybe the Royal Albert Hall show is my favorite ... except I really should watch the Sheppard's Bush blues night dvd to be fair to that venue .... it's hard to choose but you won't be disappointed in any of them. The Apollo show is a great rock night.

Do I even have to comment on the video quality or the sound? It's done by Kevin Shirley. That man really CARES the way the music sounds. You will like it. I love the World's End theme by Kevin for the series.

My only ""complaint"" about any of the Tour de Force DVDs is that I wish they had done more of footage of the venues themselves. I am a historian and I would have liked to have learned more about these famous halls. They show a bit but the documentaries seem a bit rushed and completely focused on Joe and the Band That is great, except that that the packaging of the dvds highlights the venues where they were recorded. If you recall one early Joe Live recording is called Live from Nowhere in Particular, but the venue seems to be very important to this series.  The docs are about an hour+ and well worth watching despite my minor gripes.

BTW, my name comes from an old Yahoo list for Jimi Hendrix fans. It was the first major internet blog on Hendrix and many researchers and hard core collectors were on it.",1387584000,,1846,4.230113636363637
5926880,5,B00EL6NWWC,Joe Bonamassa plays so many styles of music incredibly well. The set of Tour de Force DVD's is a perfect example of what Joe is and has been all about foe over a decade. If you are not a fan you will be after watching the set of 4.,1387497600,,231,3.7346938775510203
5926881,5,B00EL6NWWC,"Wow. Blown away by this show. Everything you could want is here - an acoustic opening followed by a powerhouse electric set with Joe at his finest. The song list included a few that I had not heard live previoulsy, and the performance of Just Got Paid may have been the best I've ever heard. By far, my favorite of the series to this point.
Now on the the Royal Albert Hall.",1384905600,5,374,4.208333333333333
5926882,4,B00EL6NWWC,"Well, I bought the whole set and I'm going to try and leave at least a blurb or two for all of them as I watch them. The set list here is similar to the RAH disc. And apparently this was the night before that show but night 3 of this 4 disc catalog all in a row. I love this guy but this is far from his best show. I think they are tired and fried and it shows. The whole band is not their usual focused happy selves. They all seem subdued and not too into it. Audience too. Laid back even for an English crowd. All in all the playing is still good and the sound and picture are adequate. But they're just sort of going through the motions. Worth having if you're a fan but otherwise get any of the RAH discs.",1384560000,5,709,3.863013698630137
5926883,5,B00EL6NWWC,If you have seen Joe Bonamassa live you would understand !! He is just a great on DVD as in person. I have seen many live performances of his and have met him on several occasions and I would recommend any of his dvd's. What a awesome performer. Such artistic talent! Music to the soul!,1383609600,3,286,4.218181818181818
5926884,5,B00EL6NWWC,"I'm putting almost the same review up for all 4 BR/DVDs and I hope you don't mind but they are consistently excellent and I'd be redundant anyway.

I just picked up all four BR sets and am so thrilled.  When I first saw these ""coming"" at my local record store (yes I'm lucky to have one near me Fingerprints in Long Beach CA) I thought, why bother putting out 4 videos from 4 shows on the same tour... and it struck me as overkill or as one review thought a runaway ego.  Yesterday I picked them all up and noted that they are 4 shows, 4 different bands, 4 venues and 4 concepts..

They are all great and for different reasons, but they all share things in common, great visuals, great sound, great playing and great value for money. All come with 28 page booklets full of excellent pictures and information and all come with bonus features about the shows that are consecutive in nature (4 part making of that add about an hour to each DVD!).

Favorite moments for me are Joe's treatment of the late Gary Moore's ""Midnight Blues"" both on his Blues night at Shepards Bush and his night at The Royal Albert Hall. ""Spanish Boots"" on the trio show is also a killer. From the first show which features his TRIO days sound to the blues w/horns at Shepards Bush to the Rock show at Hammersmith and the final big night at the Royal Albert Hall these shows (ranging from 1 hour and 40 minutes to over 2 hours each) are wonderful expressions of a love of music by one of this generations greatest guitarists and for me to have this much classic Les Paul guitar playing is heaven.

I'd caution folks who think its too much, what would you give to have the same treatment by Gary Moore? Eric Clapton? heck...instead of highlights from the CREAM Reunion , what about a BR disc for every night? Complete? Would you want this from Peter Green at his best? Of course. I think that an artist like Joe Bonamassa who is certainly at a creative peak and has music and ideas flying off his fingers should capture as much of this as possible before he's too darned tired or burned out!!!

You can view each individual show to see if there is a song or set list that has more appeal to you. Personally I am in the mood for rock sometimes, blues with horns other times, trio work others, so I'll return to these depending and I'm glad I have all 4.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",1383004800,7,2345,4.337899543378995

I bought all 4 of the Tour de Force DVD's and am unable to say which is the best.  I enjoyed all of them, equally as much as the original music I heard at work.

5926910,5,B00EL6NWWC,"Another great set of discs from one of the most surprising and amazing guitar players of all time! Joe and his mates deliver such a  marvelous list of songs, played like the bands in the seventies used to do: with passion and perfection. It is really good to see that the blues rock genre has, finally, a true king! Buy all four; they're all sensational. One of my favourite tracks: ""Tea For One"" (by Led Zeppelin).",1394582400,2,415,4.4605263157894735
