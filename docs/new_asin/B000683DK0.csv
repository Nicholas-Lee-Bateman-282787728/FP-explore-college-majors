2174994,5,B000683DK0,"I saw this on the Disney channel back when it first came out in 1985. At first I was bothered by Jonathan's (Huckleberry Fox)70's mullety hairstyle. Was he a boy or a girl? That and the fact that I walked in on the middle of the show where he's dressed in old-fashioned clothes must have added to my confusion on his gender, therefore leading to my initial biased opinion.
  But I was eventually drawn to it as my grandfather loved airplanes and had one of his own that he had built. I was drawn into the movie. I am not much of a sci-fi person so I find the thought of time travel very bizarre and hard to comprehend. So the movie was a bit strange, but really quite good.

  When it first came out on Disney, it was known as ""The Blue Yonder"", after pilot Max Knickerbocker's biplane. However, they later revised it and added more scenes (or maybe just added clips they cut out of Blue Yonder) and released it as the Disney Sunday Movie known as ""Time Flyer"". I liked that version best as it made more sense.

  Jonathan goes back in time to meet his grandfather Max and he is WAY out of place in his grandfather's world--including his 1980s flamboyant clothes. He acts like a goon! He should know he is in another time but of course he is just an ignorant kid. It is funny and interesting. One of my favorite scenes which was not on the original movie (Blue Yonder) was in ""Time Flyer"" when Jonathan walks into a MacDonald's and asks for a quarter pounder. Apparently MacDonald's didn't sell quarter pounders in those days!! (Or maybe that MacDonald's had nothing to do with the fast food chain--apparently if I remember correctly, it was a grocery store, and the fast food chain is spelled ""McDonalds""). I guess he goes back to the 20's...He eventually meets up with his grandfather Max, who shows Jonathan the ""smallest radio in the world"" with is gigantic to Jonathan, since he is from another time!! Jonathan sure gives himself away with his ignorance of that time era!!

  Max Knickerbocker is another Amelia Earhart; a male version, that is. He had set out on a flight and vanished, so Jonathan had gone back in time to try to stop him from making that fateful flight.
  Sad bittersweet movie!! Weird, thinking of going back in time to meet your grandparents who died before you were born, and to see your grandmother pregnant with your own father--and being able to tell your grandmother that yes, she is having a boy, because it's your father!! Fortunately Max finally believes him. After all, it is Max who thought up the theory of time travel, and years later his best friend (Jonathan's neighbor) Henry, who was dying of heart failure at the end of the movie, I guess had built the time machine but never tried it out but Jonathan decides to step up to the plate.
  It is good but I can't stand to watch it, it makes me cry too much!! Especially when Henry, at the very end, says. ""Goodbye, Jonathan."" and you KNOW he is going to die--so heartbreaking for a child!!",1293753600,,2979,4.480591497227357
2174995,5,B000683DK0,I have this movie on VHS and I love this movie and it plays great.  I wish it was on DVD but no dice yet.  I love it just as much as I did when I was a kid.  Jump at your chance to grab this classic which Disney seems to have forgotten about.  I have had the VHS in my possesion for about 10 years now still love and pull it out every once in a while to relive my childhood.  It was pretty tough to trach down back then it because it was discontinued.  Every home Disney should not be without it. Buy it buy it now.,1256774400,5,515,3.6788990825688073
2174996,5,B000683DK0,"I watched this movie when I was a kid only once but impacted me so much that I never forgot it and to this day I have never been able to find it until now, I thought I was imagining it. Every time I search anywhere under ""time travel"" this one has never come up. Disney made a LOT of really great movies that were on tv when I was growing up that you just can't find any more. I don't know what they are doing with them now, or if they are just forgotten completely in a storeroom??? I would buy this but I can't get myself to spend so much when I don't know if I will even like it now as an adult. If it were $10 or $12 I would buy it for SURE.",1233100800,,645,3.681159420289855

2174999,4,B000683DK0,"I saw this movie several years ago on TV. Sadly Disney has not seen fit to put it on DVD yet. One can only hope they will since they are releasing several of the other movies now. Peter Coyote, Art Carney, and Huckleberry Fox all turn in wonderful performances. Henry played by Carney plays the part of Jonathan's grandfather. He tells him stories of how his great grandfather, played by Peter Coyote, tried to cross the Atlantic by plane before Lindbergh did it. Jonathan uses a time machine to go back and try to help his great grandfather succeed. A great movie for the whole family. I sure would buy it if I could get it on DVD. Another fun movie for the family sitting in Disney's vault that should be returned to print on DVD.",1109894400,10,732,4.389705882352941
8040041,5,B000683DK0,This is a great movie and encourage all to contact Disney about releasing it on DVD or bluray. Love watching this as a kid in the 80s. My 10 yr old son thinks the movie is awesome.,1483315200,,180,3.891891891891892
8040042,3,B000683DK0,"I was thinking of movies I grew up loving to watch so I could share them with my nephews. Right away I thought of this movie, even remembered the TV title. I'm so sad it's only available on VHS.",1476748800,,194,4.0
8040043,5,B000683DK0,I bought the vhs recently and it was everything I remembered.  Except the scene where he walks into a butcher shop called McDonald's and ask for a quarter pounder was not in it. Was it cut from the vhs?  Was it only allowed on tv when it aired originally ?,1455580800,,256,4.1
8040044,5,B000683DK0,"I saw this movie years and years ago. It has a scene where the boy walks into McDonald's Mercantile. The boy thinks it is a McDonald's restaurant.  He orders a hamburger and the owner tells him he doesn't serve hamburgers. The boy explains the current day McDonalds and walks out. The owner verbally toys with the idea then says ""Naw. You'd have to sell a thousand of them"".  That scene us no longer in the movie but it was cute.
The kid also asked for candy. He asked the store owner if it was ""sugar free"" and the owner said no, you have to pay for sugar. That too was a cute scene but it too has been cut.
Too bad because both scenes added to an excellent movie.",1449964800,,665,4.147286821705427

8040048,5,B000683DK0,"I was delighted to find this movie at Amazon.  Many years ago I was able to make a poor quality VHS copy from one of the movie channels.  I had this movie along with another on the same tape.

Amy, the gal that sent me the Disney movie on the VHS tape was most kind as she sent along a note telling me to let her know if I was the least bit unhappy.

The package arrived, overpacked to protect the tape and in excellent condition.  I have since moved the tape to DVD so I can play it on all of my digital equipment.

I am a 72 year old kid and this movie takes me back to my days in the Civil Air Patrol where I got to fly in small planes often.

Many thanks, Amy and many thanks Amazon",1318636800,,686,3.788732394366197
8040049,5,B000683DK0,"I recently watched ""The Blue Yonder"" on VHS.This was the first time I had seen it since it aired on TV in 1985. I still love the movie as much now as then. This is an Adventure/SciFi movie about a young boy (Huckleberry Fox) who goes back in time to try to save his grandfather who died while trying to become the first person to fly across the Atlantic. There are great performances by Peter Coyote (as the boy's father) and Art Carney (as a friend of the boy), but for me, what really made this a first rate production was the masterful direction of Mark Rosman and the incredibly believeable performance by the very adorable young Huckleberry Fox in what may possibly be his greatest role ever. This is a movie for anyone who needs encouragement to follow their dreams and believe in their own vision. This movie soars with adventure, and when you watch it your spirit will soar as well. (I am hoping and praying that Disney will release this wonderful film on DVD.)",1300147200,,969,4.480225988700565
8040050,5,B000683DK0,"In true Disney fashion, a purely entertaining film/adventure that revives the child in all of us.
It allows us to forget the maddening pace of society today!",1294790400,,157,4.851851851851852
