8181710,3,B000NVI0EO,Decent enough for micro low budget. It's a keeper.,1473811200,,50,4.666666666666667
8181711,3,B000NVI0EO,"This movie exceeded my expectations.  It had a few good scares, several good laughs, and some hot chicks to top it off.  It's not going to win any awards but I definitely enjoyed watching it.  Check it out for yourself.",1191974400,2,219,4.425
8181712,1,B000NVI0EO,"In details, the storyline is very weak, the mental crazy patient is only a small size girl, it seems she has the blue-print of the house that she seems to know every corner of it.
All the victims seem to have no instinct to protect themselves and fight, just sit there and wait to be killed.
The to-be-married man looks smarter and fooler than the otners, how can he, might have knocked the mentally-ill patient unconcious for only a moment, can be that happy as he knows the girl has killed his friends and innocent people brutally, not sure how the girl is and immediately act stupidly, raises his hands, turns his back on the girl...I am pissed and think he deserves to be killed...

The ending is senseless too, somewhat like ""Black Xmas 2006"", and should be deleted.

Don't believe me, rent one and see it yourself before you decide to buy.",1185494400,,845,4.516339869281046
8181713,4,B000NVI0EO,"Interesting twist to a age old movie storyline.  The dialogue is real and funny.  The actors are believable.  No it's not Citizen Kane, but it is fun.",1184457600,4,150,4.481481481481482
