1882421,5,B00009AV7P,"Great acting, and ability to capture the essence of larger than life figures. I would recommend it to any student of history or politics.",1355961600,,137,4.75
1882422,5,B00009AV7P,"Since I work in a library, I always 'test-drive' a book or a movie beforehand to see if it's a must-have. THIS is a must-have. DAMN! Harry Lennix (one of my favorite actors) handles his bidness! In any bio, I love when an actor/actress channels the subject and becomes the subject, yet not a caricature. He deftly portrayed the late Harlem congressman, from the accent (I love his raspy voice) to the chain-smoking hep cat and liberationist preacher (really, how many congregants had a pastor like THAT!?!)--right down to using his right hand (Lennix is a southpaw).

From what I've read and learned about Adam Clayton Powell, Brother-man was not to be played with--whether that's arrogance or confidence, is up to the observer, but one thing he was NOT was bought. Seems like the word ""smooth"" had to be invented just to describe him! Lennix oozes wicked cool, and chews up some scenery (I swear, he had either a pipe, cigarette or cigar in EVERY scene!) even in the instances where some of his maneuvers are questionable (re: attitudes towards icons A. Philip Randolph and Martin Luther King). Say what you will, there's a smattering of hypocrisy in even the noblest among us, but there is no doubt nobody worked it like Adam Clayton Powell. ""Papa Don't Take No Mess"" might have been a good subtitle!

You have got to check out the scene in the House of Representatives with his 'distinguished colleague' from Mississippi--IT IS HYSTERICAL!

I'd strongly recommend watching and OWNING this one. It's a repeater.",1284422400,,1513,4.8565891472868215
1882423,3,B00009AV7P,"Although the film was poorly cast, I still wanted to give it a chance because I wanted to gain a better understanding of the life of this great man.  I was disappointed. In an effort to be ""fair"" or non-biased, the script neglected to truly capture the tenor of the times and the innate passion that fueled this man's life.  I understand that Powell's sons were involved in this production.  I hope that the project is taken up again by someone who isn't so close to the subject.",1217116800,,479,4.420454545454546
1882424,5,B00009AV7P,This is a great piece of history I love this movie.,1154908800,3,51,3.727272727272727
1882425,4,B00009AV7P,"I had really waited for a movie on the great ""Adam Clayton Powell"" for years.  When most politicians die there is a movie out on them right away....Not Powell, I had to wait for this one and it was worth waiting for.  I followed the politics of Mr. Powel when I was quite young and was always impressed with his brillance and nerve to always speak out on things that lots of others were afraid to speak out on.  I really enjoyed this movie and found the cast quite well assigned.  If you have an historical section as a part of your collection, this is a must have. You won't find a whole lot of his actions and promotions in your average american history book.  You'll need to put roles played by our folk in your own History Book.  This is one of the chapters.",1131494400,11,762,4.220689655172414
1882426,5,B00009AV7P,"HARRY IS FINE!

5 STAR MOVIE *****",1118793600,,132,4.521739130434782
1882427,3,B00009AV7P,"The cover is deceptive.  You would think the heterosexual embrace between Vanessa Williams and Harry Lennix is a sign that this is a Harlem Renaissance romance.  It's not: this is about the life of Adam Clayton Powell, Jr..  It's a biopic.  Williams' presence on the cover must have been based on her popularity and as a way to seduce apolitical viewers.

The history of 20th-century black leadership is rich: it doesn't just start and end with Martin and Malcolm.  This movie shows that Powell came before Dr. King and had tensions with him.  The idea that black leaders have tensions with each other, have strong connections with black churches, and are caught in sexual scandals will resonate with those who are thinking about the current scene in black leadership.  The film shows Powell arguing with his famous father.  Again, modern black leaders have heated father-son dynamics and any man who has similar tensions with his father or his son will be able to relate.

Harry Lennix is often cast as the bad guy.  His roles in the ""Matrix"" and ""Barbershop"" sequels are examples.  I think it has to do with his green eyes and cleft.  Finally, he gets a lead role where he can use his sinister looks to gain sympathy with the audience.  Powell was a wheeler-dealer, self-promoter, and womanizer.  A sneaky, but sexy, man like Lennix was ideal for the role.

This movie shows how Powell threatened to accuse Dr. King and Bayard Rustin of being lovers if they didn't do what he wanted.  First, I love that ""Boycott"" showed that Bayard Rustin, a black [...] man, played a critical role in the Civil Rights Movement.  Second, I love how this movie shows the rampant homophobia thrust against him.  I'm glad that movies are beginning to portray the triumphs and struggles of black [...] men and black lesbians.  Though Powell is NO hero of mine, I enjoyed this flick.

The title points to an interesting fact.  It's amazing to see a man who was elected Congressman speak in ""daddy-oh"", hep-cat, jazzy language.  Like many black leaders, Powell rubbed elbows with white elites at the same time that he was familiar with the black vernacular and what we now call ""keeping it real.""

Adam Clayton Powell the fourth is a co-producer of this film.  Thus, his heirs must have approved of the portrayal.  I wish this DVD had subtitles.  There are many blacks in Harlem, which Powell represented, that only speak Spanish or French and will miss out on this history because of this oversight.  The journalist character who narrates the story has something in common with the description of Steve Buscemi in ""Fargo.""

I recommend this biopic strongly.",1099872000,15,2638,4.8
1882438,5,B00009AV7P,"Delivery was timely, and the item was professionally packaged.  I viewed this movie once on HBO, and never saw it again, I wanted my young son to know who this man was, and the role he played in America's political system, and this movie gave him great overview, as well as it being quite entertaining.",1411948800,,302,4.490909090909091

7990426,5,B00009AV7P,"I learned a lot about Mr. Powell, this movie made me realize how little I knew about his career and the actual impact he had. The movie kept me interested enough to stay up until 3:30am and I have to work in the morning, lol. Definitely worth watching. Great cast as well!!!",1455667200,,274,4.288461538461538
7990427,5,B00009AV7P,"Harry Lennix proves once again that he is one of the best and most under-recognized actors today. This is the ""Hollywood"" version of some of the Civil Rights congressman, Adam Clayton Powell's life in and out of Congress. Accurate depictions of Fiorello La Guardia and others who figure prominently in the history of New York City and Civil Rights struggle in the 1940s and 1950s are shown. Vanessa Williams plays a charming and credible depiction of Powell's wife, the acclaimed musician, Hazel Scott.",1450051200,,502,5.0602409638554215

7990431,4,B00009AV7P,What a fascinating man of action. Sometimes he was his own worst enemy but still kept up the fight for justice and racial equality.
