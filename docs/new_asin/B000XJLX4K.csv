8228627,5,B000XJLX4K,"I have viewed this DVD on several occasions and always come away freshly entranced by the views of the Imperial city.  Much of the scenes are shot from the water, as if from a cruise boat, giving extra depth and reality to the journey through St. Petersburg's waterways.  All of the main sites are well covered and the scenes will stay fresh in your mind.  The DVD only increases the desire to visit this beautiful city.",1354665600,,420,4.5
