3789335,5,B001TGU6IK,"This is a beautifully made family film.  Joe Mantegna and Ann Archer are just spectacular in their roles as a loving married couple trying to achieve the American dream lifestyle for themselves as well as their 2 teenage children. Uncle Nino's visit from Italy instills the love and warmth of european old world family values through tenderness, love  and music, thus reconnecting the family.  The well scored and orchestrated music compliments the gorgeous film work. Highly recommended for family members of all ages to watch and enjoy together. Sit back, relax and enjoy every element of this movie.",1243296000,15,602,5.122448979591836
3789336,5,B001TGU6IK,"We have been waiting for Uncle Nino to be released on DVD since we saw it at the movies. We had told our whole family about it and promised our grandson, who was in a high school band at the time, that we would purchase it for him. We tried to find out about the release for a very long time, but to no avail. We were so thrilled when we saw it was available on Amazon and immediately ordered two copies. It is a very sweet and heartwarming story and all of the actors brought it to life. Our grandson is now in college, but we will be watching it with him very soon.",1241654400,,567,3.9391304347826086

3789338,1,B001TGU6IK,"As an Italian American, I find this movie incredibly inaccurate.  If Mr. Micelli was truly concerned about his Uncle Nino, he has a poor way of showing it.  He and his wife were not aware of his arrival?  His wife picks him up at the airport, drives him to their beautiful home, and feeds him, this is the best part,Chinese food.  Wow,an Italian uncle on his first visit to America, and his niece offers him Chinese food.  The man has never seen Chinese food much less ate it.  Does not provide a fork, and the poor guy has to negotiate chop sticks.  Mr. Micell is the only Italian I know of that does not have a bottle of red wine in his house, so Mrs. Micelli dusts off an old box of Almaden red wine, ouch, I want to puke.  If I was Uncle Nino, I would have taken the next flight back to Italy. One of the worst movies I have ever seen, and a disgrace to all Italians.  Go to PBS and watch Lydia's Italy, for real taste of Italy.",1240099200,4,932,4.076923076923077
3789339,3,B001TGU6IK,"A charming family film -- better suited for teens than younger children. It seems more like a TV-movie to me, although it's not. While I enjoyed its wholesome family emphasis, the script seemed a bit too contrived for me.  I think, though, that most family film fans will enjoy this one.

Mascarino was endearing as Uncle Nino Micelli who travels from Italy to visit his nephew Robert (Joe Mantegna), a workaholic executive who lives in suburban Chicago. The purpose of Uncle Nino's visit is revealed late in the story and prompts Robert to re-evaluate his priorities. Young Gina Mantegna (Joe Mantegna's real-life daughter) makes her film debut here and shows promise as an upcoming young talent in her role as the young daughter of the Micelli family.

While much of the story is predictable, the acting by the main characters compensates for this shortcoming.  My favorite scene is the Carps' debut in the high school ""battle"" -- the group's performance seemed convincing & very upbeat.

The film has its happy and sad moments, but, as is typical of movies of this genre, the wholesome nature of the film is the main reason to see it.",1239580800,13,1137,4.81025641025641
3789340,1,B001TGU6IK,"I am at a loss to explain the emotional reaction to this deranged movie; perhaps it is a form of mass hysteria, attaching so much emotional baggage to such a trifle of a picture.  And the right wing justifications for this movie's existence - from one of the co-stars, yet - are over the top:  it was Anne Archer who, in a Newsweek article, stated that ""'Uncle Nino' is for those people who elected George Bush.""  And in his customer review Kerry Bean stated that the film played for an entire year in Michigan but fails to inform us that it played once a week - for a year.  This does not explain why the film languished in the shelves for two years before opening nationally, to the tune of a pitiful $100,000 box office its first week - and sat neglected with no DVD release for another four years.  In short, nobody cares about this film, nobody wants to see it, and everyone avoided it.  They probably know something the rest of us should know.  A stinker is a stinker.

For some reason it seems that the most fascistic individuals are the ones who embrace sentimental movies such as IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE and crap like UNCLE NINO.  They force them upon us as role models and tell us we could do better.  But who are we to resist?  Why even Hitler loved Mom, apple pie and puppies.  Which brings us to Pierrino Mascarino's cloying performance as Uncle Nino.  Much has been made of how Mascarino ambushes audiences for this film and insists on hugging everyone in the theater as they exit.  I saw this performance at a free Century City screening one morning.  Frankly, I was embarrassed at seeing my neighbor willfully lower himself into a screaming, red-faced Mussolini on behalf of the family values movement.

The title performance by Mascarino is terrible.  He is one of those actors who has to turn every emotional subtlety into World  War III.  You would think the Sensurround and Rumble-Rama subwoofers were turned on high.  And when he is required to be hysterical - well, it is hysterical, all right.  Fortunately for the audience, when Pierrino Mascarino gets his head chopped off in TEARS OF THE SUN, the camera cuts away to a shot of birds in flight.  A cheap clich, to be sure, but better than having to watch every contortion of yet another hammy Pierrino Mascarino performance.

There is something of a dead weight attached to UNCLE NINO.  The film has no momentum, no direction.  It is dark and depressing and shallow, considering the cheap alternatives the film gives us for lives of chosen emptiness.  The director, Robert Shallcross, has worked in slimy, feel-good movies before, so this is familiar territory.  However, I was not convinced by the characters' misery.  It is not as if they are engulfed by circumstances beyond their control.  In fact, they have chosen the odious lifestyle that has entrapped them.  When the mother, Anne Archer, breaks down into tears by a life devoid of meaning yet full of toys such as cell phones and big cars and big hair, I could not feel a drop of empathy for her or her family.  This was entirely their decision.  Completely lacking in any self awareness or self-reflection, these unhappy individuals are supposed to be sympathetic, not part of a national problem.  And the film expects us to suspend our disbelief to the point to where we believe that a vain actor - er, uh, a moronic foreign relative, can rescue these lives and introduce another grubby lifestyle as a fresh alternative.

I don't know what kind of a dead-end those who celebrate this picture have entered into.  I can certainly think of dozens of other movies that are more moving, even in a cheap, knee-jerk fashion.  This picture is for the idiots who say the world is moving into the future too fast; this picture celebrates the past and cheap solutions.  And I am sure the small minds of those who play roles in this film think they are onto Something Big.  Instead, they are onto something stupid and venal.  In an ideal world these characters would all be on Prozac or in jail.  I don't know what kind of drug would cure an Uncle Nino; perhaps Ritalin would do the job.  This picture is eye candy for lowlifes.",1239321600,4,4150,4.607094133697135
3789341,5,B001TGU6IK,"I can't believe this is finally out on DVD!!  I've been wating years for this!  My wife and I were fortunate enough to see this film in it's very limited theatrical release after I saw an article in our local newspaper about the film which was about to end it's year-long run in a local theater.  Granted it was a small theater in a megaplex, but how many films do you hear of in this day and age running for a year?!?

We were both deeply touched by the film, but even more touched after the film ended.  The actor who plays Uncle Nino, Pierrino Mascarino, stepped out to a standing ovation and spoke to the packed house about the film and how important it was to him.  He insisted on hugging everyone in the theater as we exited.

If you're a typical American family with 2.3 children, a dog, and are working parents who seem to spend most of your time working, running errands, and seeing your children on the way to bed, I strongly recommend you see this film.",1239062400,38,964,4.292817679558011

3789378,5,B001TGU6IK,"just what others have reported: good feelings. It's a feel-good movie. The pace is slow and even for most of the movie and then it delivers. This is definitely worth waiting for. The scriptwriters hope that you like Uncle Nino by then and you do - what's not to like?

I am vaguely reminded of a movie that was one of my favorite italian language films years ago: Lo Zio Indegno. It was a much darker film, if you can imagine that (think of how the title translates: The Sleazy Uncle). Vittorio Gassman played the uncle of the title  (Giancarlo Giannini played the nephew) and it truly challenged you to form an opinion of him. But it was very very good. Unfortunately, it's hard to find these days! Worth looking up and watching if you can - but keep the kids away even if they want to test their Italian skills!

I don't know that this film was inspired by that but it could have been. There is no mention of Lo Zio Indegno anywhere, so who knows?",1513382400,,949,4.320224719101123

3789387,5,B001TGU6IK,There really aren't many movies today that can make you laugh and cry at the same time but then comes Uncle Nino. Well worth the time to enjoy a good old fashioned family movie of years gone by. This movie makes one understand what is truly missing in the American family today and why it is so important not to take for granted the truly simple things in life that we never seem to see because we never take the time to notice.

3789388,5,B001TGU6IK,"This is a family-friendly story of an Italian uncle who visits an upper-class nephew in the United States.  Nino doesn't speak much English and it's his first visit to the area.  He's happy and tries his best to learn English.  He quickly discovers that family time in this wealthy home is limited: The father is too busy with his job and trying to get promoted, and the wife ends up eating dinner alone. He slowly warms up to the family, especially to the wife. He sees what the family is lacking: honest talking with one another and spending time together as a family. He slowly becomes a part of the family. He's allowed to plant a garden.  He plays music with the son's band. That gets the neighborhood riled up. Only the music-crazed son seems to show an interest in Nino.  It's music that gets this family to get together and work out their differences.

Uncle Nino has a secret, though, that isn't revealed until the end.

This is a story of love and redemption.",1504224000,,969,4.502857142857143
3789389,1,B001TGU6IK,"A whole lot of time taken up for contemplating, sighing, crying, apologizing, doing stupid things by Nino as though he knew already that he wouldn't get away with what he did in Italy or America.  They tried to pass off his chaotic foolery as innocence was just as annoying as the son's obnoxious acid rock music.  The ""gift"" that Nino left looked like hell and the overdone story line of unhappy, disconnected family that miraculously becomes enormously happy was fake, fake, fake.  I didn't care about the characters at all, none of them were a match as a family and too much stressful arguing at home and at work.  NO, I didn't have a good time watching this hollow movie and wasted another two hours of my life.",1503619200,,715,4.5625

Some of the plot elements and twists are predictable; however, using a great uncle from Italy adds both humor and a different perspective of the usual American life. The story was a bit slow in the beginning, so I encourage you to stick with it. Overall, I found the message a good one, and I enjoyed the overall pace (a bit slower than an action movie). I recommend this movie primarily as a stimulus to get you to reflect on your family life.",1484956800,,602,4.635514018691588

My only problem is that, like many movies, money is no problem for anyone; not, perhaps, a fair reflection of real life. But hey, this isn't real life, this is a feel good movie, so take it on its own terms and, well, feel good.

As I said, it is a very nice story for our ""Fractured"" Families now to watch and see what life should be all about - as a family. It really makes you think about how far apart our nuclear family has split just by the way the world has changed over the past few years.
Family life can be great and this movie shows how important that fact is to a well-balanced base to the growth of the children that come from that family, as well as keeping the parents well grounded with each other and their children.

Joe Mantegna plays a workaholic whose trying to climb up the career ladder, while his family is in the brink of falling apart.  Anne Archer is the loving wife trying to keep some sense of family in their household.  Pierrino Mascarrino plays the loving Italian uncle that serves as the catalyst that brings the family together and makes them realize the importance of balance in their lives.

Uncle Nino comes from old Italy to visit his nephew in the suburbia USA.  This is a family disconnected with no heart in it, until this well meaning Nino joins them and pulls the family together again.
He teaches them how to ""be a real family"" and  enjoy the pleasures of life just by being himself.  Very likable genuine character, ...wish these was one in every family.

It is not a high budgeted film, but it is well acted and believable.

It made me realize that LESS IS REALLY MORE. We didn't have big fancy homes, new fancy cars, fancy clothes and all the luxuries we have today, BUT, we sat and ate dinners with family every day and talked to each other, no texting.
Those over 50 will relate to this movie. Most of us will agree that we were much happier when we had less but had more family ties.",1408838400,,528,4.086538461538462

3790287,4,B001TGU6IK,"Being Italian it is easy to relate to Uncle Nino and also in these busy times to the busyness of the family portrayed too. It is a perhaps slightly dated from a few years back and plays less like a feature film and more like a made for tv Hallmark movie but we enjoyed it and the message it sends. Great for a family movie night. We rented it for sentimental reasons because an older relative, like Nino, had suggested it once but we never saw it . The character of Uncle Nino was sweet and believable too and Joe Mantegna always comes across as expressive and genuine even in this simple story. He has a sweet scene with his real daughter who plays the daughter and in it he conveyed being a very loving dad, whether onscreen or off.

The rototiller scene was VERY believable though at times Ann Archer seemed a bit out of place with her glamour.",1392595200,3,847,4.29375

There is more to his character than first appears and I like how he is fleshed out during the movie.  Also good to see the family come together and learn from their Uncle Nino.  The movie is a little slow at times, but not much and is worth the watch.

3790311,5,B001TGU6IK,"There is a DVD bonus feature of Joe Mantegna (""Robert"") and his daughter -- Gina -- talking about the making of the film, which was
helpful in the writing of this review.

 ""UNCLE NINO"" (Pierrino Mascarino) -- filmed in Italy and Northern Illinois -- also features Joe Mantegna as an out-of-touch, out-of-
the-house, father more concerned with his career than family. Joe's real-life daughter, Gina, plays Gina, his eleven-year-old daughter.
The 11 year-old, played by a 12-year-old, looks about 14 on the DVD cover. Entirely possible, as this 2003 movie ran for a year in a
Michigan theatre before its 2005 National release.

 Also features Anne Archer (PATRIOT GAMES) as Joe's wife; and, rebellious 14-year-old son, Bobby, (Trevor Morgan JURASSIC PARK 3).

 An old-world Italian with old-fashioned ways arrives the same day a three week-old letter is found in his nephew's briefcase(""Robert"").
The old man is a neighborhood curiousity and a pain in the butt to Robert. The old man is just another distraction in a patient wife's
life that has an empty space where her husband should be. Uncle Nino becomes her ""oldest kid"" as he needs a little ""adult"" supervision,
himself. When Uncle Nino is left to babysit the kids, everybody knows something ""interesting"" will happen -- but Mom and Dad.

 UNCLE NINO slowly turns everybody into a REAL family. He even gets a highschool freshman to quit smoking.

 UNCLE NINO is rated PG, has no objectionable words or pictures -- unless Abraham Lincoln is offensive to you.

 This family film appears to be a work of love by the cast and crew. Of course, I've seen BETTER, and I've seen WORSE films, but this
is one that leaves a peaceful feeling in your heart. When the final frame flickers off your screen, you just might find a f-o-r-e-i-g-n
particle in your eye.
 The price of the double disc Blu-ray/DVD is such that this film is a keeper... not a rental.

3790327,4,B001TGU6IK,It is so difficult to find a movie that appeals to children of different ages and adults.  This is a good find!  There was only one minor thing I didn't like for younger children towards the beginning.  I can't remember if it was a bad word or what but it was minor.  Otherwise the movie is excellent.  It has a good message and was very entertaining for all of us.  I didn't want it to end.,1256169600,,391,4.078947368421052

3790330,4,B001TGU6IK,"Uncle Nino really illustrates the differences in American culture and that of an elderly man from a small Italian town; but how each culture adapts and learns from each other.

The children were spoiled and had no manners to speak of; the family was so disfunctional that it was pathetic. Uncle Nino arrives and things begin to change for the better. The actors all do a credible job, especially Joe Mantegna and Pierrino Mascarino. It's not ""The Parent Trap"" but it is very watchable.",1253664000,,485,4.773809523809524
3790331,5,B001TGU6IK,"Myself and my family really loved this movie! It is the type of feel good movie for all to enjoy! Being italian, it really hit home.

It is a moving film.  By the time the movie was over, even my 12 year old son was in tears.  It provides a clear reflection of the ""perfect American family"" -- and how confused our values have become.

This is a deep, thoughtful film.  It's not about Italians or relatives or high school or smoking or rock music (although all appear in the film).  Its about family and discovering what really is important in life.",1248048000,,491,4.46067415730337

8341181,5,B001TGU6IK,"What a great movie about love, ""punk rock"", American dystopia and how to overcome it -- edgy and emotionally cathartic without being profane -- just the thing after a long week!",1521244800,,177,4.741935483870968
8341182,1,B001TGU6IK,"With all the 5 star reviews, and after watching the movie, there was a lot of daylight between the actual quality of this movie and the ratings people were giving, so I started reading some of these reviews specifically and noticed a lot of the same things repeated by supposedly different people; paragraphs that were cut and pasted by dozens of ""verified individuals"". Very suspicious.

In reality this movie was poorly written and chalk full of cliches and stereotypes. One such stereotype is the Gissepi ""Uncle Nino"" character: the kindly Italian man from the ""old world"" with the heart of gold who looks (and talks) like he just jumped out of a Mario Bros. game, or off the poster of a campy pizza ad from the 1970s. Every time Mario--err I mean Uncle Gissepi--err I mean Uncle Nino has screen time, an annoying accordion tune is played--music the director--or whomever wrote the script, must imagine all people from Italy listen to: they all rock out to the type of accordion tunes played at stateside spaghetti restaurants while eating Chef Boyardee and wearing suspenders. Yes, the movie is that bad.

The crux of the story surrounds an upper middle class family, whom it's difficult to care about, nor their 1st world problems as their worst day in this fictional neighborhood in their fictional McMansion would be heaven for those of us who work for a living.  Anyway, it's up to our friend the magical foreigner, uncle Gissepi--err I mean Mario, err, you get the idea, to teach them the error of their ways through his good-natured bumbling, and parroting the kind of truisms that would have been cliche even if this had been an after school special in 1988.

Summary: The movie is as vapid as it is predictable, and its premise is an insult to our collective intelligence. That they went out of their way to commission so many fake reviews indicate they know how bad it is, and they don't want YOU to know until after they get whatever compensation that comes about from having your eyeballs on the screen when this plays. Save yourself an hour and a half and go watch grass grow instead. Or paint dry. Or go watch Things Change with Don Amiche if you really need a fix of this particular trope.",1520985600,3,2207,4.680412371134021
