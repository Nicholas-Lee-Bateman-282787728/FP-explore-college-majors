6403055,5,B00K5U722Y,"Like the title says I saw this movie at the sold out premiere at The Blue Note in Columbia, Missouri. If this town has one thing, its talent. This movie is laugh out loud funny from the start to the end. It might not be a movie to watch with mom, but if you make a drinking game out of it with some buds, everyone wins.

1) If you see a girl you would bang, cheers and drink.
2) If you have ever or think you might use one of the pickup lines, drink.
3) If there are tits, everyone cheers and drinks.",1403654400,,500,3.854368932038835

6403065,5,B00K5U722Y,"A young virgin named Fred is in love with the girl next door Veronica but he cannot win her love. Fred's parents have a problem, the Father's brokerage tanked and their home is near foreclosure. Unsure of how to help, Fred and his friends Suresh and Black Magic think up ideas to help their friend. After winning big at the roulette tables the boys invite some women back to their suite. The sneaky girls have a plan to drug the boys and take their winnings. Distraught about losing the money Fred and the gang head to a strip club where they meet Alex and Nico, two high rolling hit men who bet on everything. Nico bets Alex $1,000,000 that he can't teach a loser to sleep with 30 girls in just 30 days. Alex finds Fred and tries to teach him how to be a douche bag pick up artist. If Fred is successful in sleeping with 30 girls in 30 days he will earn $250,000! Hilarity ensues as Fred tries every pick up line in the book but it isn't until he fixes himself up and starts getting his game in working form. Meanwhile, Nico and Alex have their hands full with a Vegas drug dealer and his waves of assassins.

This raunchy comedy has loads of sexy topless women, great pick up lines, strong sexual content and adult language. It is intended for mature audiences only. Viewer discretion is advised. Rated R. NSFW.",1404172800,25,1313,4.359183673469388

6403067,1,B00K5U722Y,"I saw this movie in theaters and, I must emphasize, thank God I had been drinking because I couldn't have gotten through this cringe-fest otherwise. The plot follows a mid-20's aged virgin, whose parents are losing their home because of some debt or something (gives you an idea of how forgettable this going to be). Enter some random rich playboys, who make a bet that they can teach said virgin to sleep with 30 women in 30 days. The plot seems ripped straight from a porno film, with a romantic subplot that is just plain awkward. Character development is an issue as it moves from Point A to Point Z, skipping the rest of the alphabet entirely, or is completely nonexistent. The actors are either very wooden or over exaggerated, especially when it comes to the ""sex scenes."" I use quotations because this is the most cringe worthy part of the movie, because the characters seemingly (as the director would have you believe) have full blown sex...while keeping their clothes on. Needless to say, goodbye any sort of boner the director was trying to rise out the male audience. Actually, I'm 99% certain that none of the actors are actually actors and are either strippers or just friends of the director. Almost as bad as the clothed sex was the dialogue, which is comparable to that of Japanese hentai movies. But I could've forgiven all of that if it wasn't for the terrible cinematography, which makes this movie look as though it was shot on a Sony CyberShot. And to top off all this terribleness is that the sound editing sounded like it was done by someone who was just figuring out how to use Audacity for the first time. Volume levels were all over the place, with moments where the background was so loud that you could barely hear the actors speaking. Was it not in the budget to afford boom mics or lapels? Oh yeah, there were also special effects, which I'm pretty sure they were done by a high school film student...wait, that's an insult to high school film students, more like pre-school film student effects. After the movie ended I left the theater as quickly as possible to avoid any further brain cell damage. Do yourself a favor and ignore this movie, let it sink into the abyss that is the internet and never be heard from again.",1403740800,22,2254,4.609452736318408
