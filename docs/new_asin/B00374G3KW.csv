I find there is silly funny, sexy funny, slapstick funny but let me tell you here is a new category NOT funny. the guy playing the beach bum burnout? Why...painful to watch. Pamela Anderson....Really?? why??? I fell sorry for the kids on this, no talent though they are...they never had a chance. I don't even care who directed, wrote or had any part of this intestinal malfunction.",1445817600,,509,4.604395604395604

8390276,3,B00374G3KW,"Goofy and sucky movie, I just bought it cause it was cheap and wanted to add it to my
Susan Ward collection, unless your a Susan fan, I would skip this.",1367366400,,152,3.935483870967742
8390277,3,B00374G3KW,The movie was just above a grade B movie. What I like was seeing Costa Rica again. Went there 2 years ago on a long awaited 10 day trip. It was fun picking out local stuff I saw while there. It didn't hurt that the ladies in the movie was very pretty.,1366761600,,251,3.8461538461538463
8390278,1,B00374G3KW,Basic teen movie with a very basic plot around relationships.  Pam Anderson's acting was typical of a by watch type of film.,1366502400,,124,4.636363636363637
8390279,1,B00374G3KW,"My fault. I suspected going in. But usually these kinds of movies have some entertainment value.
It has been a long time since I have seen acting this bad. And the totally expected cliche story line. No surprises here.
Inane. Not even up to my low standards.",1360627200,,258,4.51063829787234
8390280,2,B00374G3KW,"It's pretty sad when toward the end of the movie I realized there was probably more in the previews that kept my interest than in the movie itself.

This seems to want to be one of those American Pie, The New Guy, etc movies but it never gets close to that level.  There's just little to no funny in it.  As far as sex appeal goes there are two girls that get topless semi-frequently thru the movie.  They are decent but their accents are so annoying that I was basically glad they weren't in it much.  Pam Anderson's part was a total joke.  The way the end challenge resolves was super laim.

Susan Ward was the only redeeming part for me as a fan of hers but I'd rather just watch The In Crowd if I want to watch her in a sexy role.  Shallow Hal is a much funnier movie if I want to watch her in a more sweet & innocent type of role.

I'm glad I only searched this movie out so I could get combo shipping on other items I ordered because it isn't worth much at all.",1324080000,3,967,3.9947916666666665
