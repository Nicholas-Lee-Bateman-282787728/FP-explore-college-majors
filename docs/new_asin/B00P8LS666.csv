6790242,4,B00P8LS666,"This film is the ""Groove Tube"" of Zombie films. It consists of a newscast reporting on outbreaks in different parts of the world making for a disjointed film. Places include, Ireland, U.S., Australia, Canada, and Spain. They are all short subjects . There was even a good episode from West Virginia that didn't have a zombie. I enjoyed the public service announcements especially the guy killing zombies with a bicycle seat. The first episode was my favorite, it was in Spanish as Jesus raised the dead causing the first zombie outbreak. Jesus and his side kick Judas must fight off peasant, Roman, and cowboy zombies with fish in an over-the-top episode. Unfortunately the film didn't stay at this level and many episodes were just disappointing such as Ireland, the Cam episode, and even Australia.

The zombies range from foot dragging brain lovers, to fast running intestine eaters.

This is a hit and miss film. Walmart $9.96 I liked it but don't recommend it if you got to pay for it.

6790244,2,B00P8LS666,"Ok,... I hate buying a movie from just one review and I have no one to blame but myself, so here we go:
1) This movie was BAD. If you like laughing at BAD movies, you might like it, I would have prefered to have seen it for far less $$, but I'm grateful I didn't spend 12 buck at a theater.
2) The absurd scene with Jesus and Lazarus being the first zombie was absurd and I laughed through the entire scene.  It was hilarious, and it deserves the second star for this alone. The way this country is going I expect this to be included in the gospels in no time, but if you're insulted by religious stuff, either pro or con christian this might offend you. The only thing funnier than the Romans in this scene was that the whole ting was subtitled and spoken spanish like a spanish gay porn.

6790276,2,B00P8LS666,"""Zombieworld"" is an interesting conundrum, a movie that ultimately exposes how overdone and routine the undead genre has become by making obvious strides to give us something new and still coming up with familiar results. It is an anthology of sorts, all revolving around what has become one of the most tired topics in modern horror history( the zombie apocalypse) that is part grindhouse, part comic book, occasionally tongue in cheek and at other times played straight. It's an ambitious range, one that is worth admiration for the scope of its efforts, and worth praise for mostly succeeding in accomplishing.

Some of the stories are intimate (a tale involving a personal battle for a wife to kill or let her recently turned husband or let him live plays it straight and has a Lucio Fulci charm) and another, a commercial about finding romance among the zombie apocalypse has a more parody-like turn but works just as well.

Despite this, it is when ""Zombiewold"" embraces its epic scope when it truly soars. One of the first segments , after one involving a reporter was slowly turning into a zombie but still wants to stay on air which is an obvious wink at the opening of George Romero's 1978 masterpiece ""Dawn of the Dead ""( they provide a further blanket the audience by recycling the tagline of the movie at a little over the hour mark and it seems more groan-worthy than enjoyable ), called ""Fist of Jesus"" and involves a Spanish speaking version of Jesus being the first to fight the zombies 2000 years ago is hands-down one of the best bits in this feature's 100 minute running time. It provides humor that actually works ( many of the earlier jokes seem a bit forced up until this point), a smirk inducing concept that gives this movie one of it's intermittent moments of true creativity and the showcase of great zombie makeup and wall-to-wall door for those who seek such things in their zombie opuses. The final sequence, involving a group of zombies that slowly rise from the waters of the beach and prey upon unsuspecting victims who are trying to enjoy a sunny day at the beach, has the aforementioned comic book quality ( and also the look and feel of another George Romero masterpiece: ""Creepshow"") that not only soars in camp value and enjoyment, but offers further proof that this movie is at its best when embracing the scope of the world running rampant with the undead.

It was a wise move to keep the two best segments as the beginning and the end because it grabs our attention and offers a suitable climax ( giving us the buckets of Gore many viewers will be expecting for a finale this motion picture ) to wave goodbye to its audience. In retrospect, the only segment that really doesn't work is the reoccurring scenes of the slowly transforming reporter and one where someone talks to his friends right before he transforms in a flat. These scenes are obvious, too routine and lack the creativity at the rest of the movie seems to be going out of its way for and therefore fail miserably in their endeavors.

The film opens with someone running from an unseen force and it provides a perfect symbol of the frantic nature of the chaos going on in herein and , simultaneously, it's lightning pace throughout. It piles one idea upon another, about as many that work that do not, that you don't have time to notice the holes and how recycled some of what it utilizes is until it's completely over (for the end credits offer some nice post-war story visuals). ""Zombieworld"" is a distraction, an assault on the senses and this solid proof of the fact.

We meet so many characters that we are offered no time to get to know them. In most movies this lack of development, time getting to know the personaloties on-screen would be a problem. That is not the focus in ""Zombieworld"" and it is more refreshing than distracting. What I can say is that,as should be expected, the characters are really all plot-serving archetypes. I guess, they have to be in a story structure like this.

The zombie make-up is excellent and often reminiscent of the Italian entries in the undead genre from the 1970's (namely Lucio Fulci's ""Zombie""), the cinematography is hit and miss (in some episodes gritty, others crisp and clean, more often than not it was obviously done on a budget) and the same can be said for the writing and the acting. It's these inconsistencies which make ""Zombieworld"" miss its mark and not gel as well as it obviously would like to and become the cult classic the film-makers could have had on their hands.

 As it is, ""Zombieworld"" is a fair tread through familiar territory. It may have a few more unique steps than others but one cannot shake the feeling that it's really window dressing. Maybe if zombies weren't such a prevalent pop culture sight and a so often harped upon subject the final result might've been better. In the end, it's ideas are window dressing and the structure of what is in is the same. We find ourselves approaching the attempt more than the whole and that, another common problem in films in general, brings us to a whole other conversation about familiarity altogether.",1430784000,,5133,4.682926829268292
6790277,5,B00P8LS666,"This movie is AWESOME!  Honestly, I'm not usually a fan of Zombie flicks (with exception to Shaun of the Dead).  That said, I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film, and I now own a copy, which will be watched over and over and over...

I love how it's set up as a series of vignettes, because my ridiculously short attention span doesn't usually permit me to sit through entire zombie movies.  In this case, each film has its own angle and overall tone.  Some of are quite funny, some are really bizarre, and some are downright repulsive!  As far as the repulsive ones go, I'd expect nothing less from the team at Dread Central :)  Blood, guts, slime, sound effects...all are top notch!

The pacing is really well done, too.  Just when I was ready for a break from goopy, seeping entrails everywhere, there would be a short film with a more creepy or funny vibe.  Then it was back to the intestines!  I just really enjoyed the timing and overall flow of the entire film.

My husband watched the movie with me, and he really dug it, too!  It was pretty entertaining to watch the TV anchorman (the connecting theme throughout the film) slowly descend into zombiedom.  Just an overall awesome film that doesn't take itself too seriously.  Check it out!!",1429228800,,1250,4.592760180995475

8686912,2,B00P8LS666,"Zombie World (2015)

 This isn't a movie, it is a collection of unrelated short films by more than a dozen different directors and writers smooched together with some extra film as a connector.  And one of the shorts isn't even about Zombies, just a cute little very weird short about a little girl who tells whoppers.
 But some of the shorts are very good (some are tragically bad however).
 The film opens promisingly enough.  A lot of people run around in confusion and panic, not quite knowing what the heck or who the heck will want to kill them.  Fast Zombies drag people down, people scream and the Army careens around with machine guns mounted on jeeps slaying any and all comers.  We see a citizen go down to the ghouls from his point of view as they eat his guts right before his eyes.  Cool, we say as the title comes up, this might be good.
 Open to a news studio declaiming on the Zombie apocalypse now under way.  They have the ribbon crawl on the bottom of the news screen with stuff about the Kardasians still being more popular than the news, even with all the carnage going on.  Ok, that made me smile.
 Then we get a satiric send up of Christianity when Jesus raises Lazarus from the dead-but as a Zombie.  This makes for all sorts of trouble as Jesus and Judas use miracle fish to dispatch the undead.  Buckets of blood, Jesus throws fish at Zombie centurions and Judas gets a swordfish to fend off the fiends.  Oh, and the whole thing is in Spanish with subtitles.  I began to feel that someone has taken me for a ride.
 And so it goes, with little PSA announcements from time to time on how to survive the Zombie hordes, as done by the government.  A good bit that.  Then some inane chatter from the news anchor and then we go to Ireland or Australia for a short from that place.
 I would have liked it better if the makers had said up front Zombie film shorts of mixed quality sold here.  I would watch it any way-it is my job to watch these things-but I wouldn't feel ripped off or lied to.
 The shorts cover a range of years and nations of origin.  I can't rate it as a movie but as a collection of shorts mostly about Zombies I give it a mild two brains.  It should be rated R for gore and SMB for Some Funny Bits.  The most interesting short came from Australia and made no attempt at humor, it dealt drama straight up, did it well and without any dialog.
 This will be of interest only to stone film buffs and serious Zombie flick fans.",1435190400,2,2464,4.265658747300216
8686913,4,B00P8LS666,"This is not a feature film at all its a compilation of short zombie horror tales, the average movie goer will not find this at all interesting but the hard-core zombie fan should certainly pick this up, there are a few bits that are stupid to fill out time like the news reporter scenes, most of the short films are really good and very clever and original visions of zombie outbreaks, especially the ones directed by Adrin Cardona and David Muoz, you get the entire version of fist of Jesus for a start which is awesome and worth buying this DVD for alone, a biblical zombie epic that has so much blood and gore packed into it, these are mostly good old fashioned practical effects too which look great, also from the same directors you get their short film Brutal Relax which is another brilliant short film set on a beach which is packed with cool old-school effects and plenty of gore!! there are some other notably good shorts too like Teleportal and Certified, its certainly worth picking up this DVD if you love this genre, its gory, it has some good humour too.",1434240000,2,1069,4.515463917525773
