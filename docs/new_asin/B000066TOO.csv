Be AWARE that this is a VHS tape that you are purchasing.
You NEED a VHS machine...this is NOT a book... (does anyone still have VHS machines ??)

There is NO mention of it being a VIDEO or even less, a VHS tape.

After carefully LOOKING for it, I found that the format (written in Font size 6 or 7) states ""VHS Tape"" somewhere BELOW the title, but it is not mentioned in the description.

Will try to return it...lesson learned...caveat emptor (buyer beware)...",1393632000,,511,4.707865168539326
