623420,5,6303333079,"A great movie, especially if you find everyday working life far from your true purpose in this world.  The goals and drive of materialism leaves little room for anything else, including peace of mind.  The main character  is a war veteran and learned first hand how valuable life is and that it is  more precious than to squander it in pursuit of ordinary life. Ultimately,  he is searching for God. His search takes him to Paris and eventually to  India - far from materialism.  With the help of a sage, his hikes through  the mountains aid in his feeling of oneness with Nature(God), thus ending  his search. He returns to Paris only to find his old acquaintances' souls  in shambles, while his life is peaceful and  content.  The main character  devoted his life to wisdom and knowledge, while all the others devoted  their lives to avarice.",948758400,,844,4.691780821917808
623421,5,6303333079,"After seeing this movie you will question your life, the meaning behind your life.

623422,4,6303333079,"It is an excellent adaption of W.Somerset Maugham`s book. The narration by Herbert Marshall is ""Top Notch"".Tyrone Power is probably the perfect Larry Darrell. Gene Teirney gives an awesome perfofmance as the  woman who does`nt get the the man she loves. Ann Baxter is terrific,Clifton  Webb is at his best as Elliot Templeton and John Payne as Gray is also very  good. This is one of the best book to movie adatations I have ever seen from  the 1940`s,besides who would you rather see as Larry Darrell Tyrone Power  or Bill Murray from ""Caddyshack"" fame.",927072000,4,554,4.7894736842105265

623552,5,6303333079,"For those looking for answers to life's most difficult questions - this film points you in the right direction. Somerset Maugham has wriiten a literary, timeless masterpiece that: 1) defies Western culture, 2) challenges the basis of capitalism, and 3) offers a path for experiencing spiritual bliss. He turns these concepts upside down and shows us the wisdom of the East, a rejection of greed, and how to find tranquilty within. This is the ultimate film for those on a spiritual quest who have a relentless desire to find truth and consequently; have a ""peak experience."" The universal nature of the story focusues on spiritual awakening, transcendance and the self-less sharing of perennial wisdom with others. Larry's journey is a lesson in opening the heart and mind while reserving judgements based on Western upbringing and societal norms. The film helps the viewer to question everything about monetary success, social acceptance and the nature of happiness. We witness the transformation of a young man who takes ""the path less traveled"" and who finds true meaning and ultimate purpose in life. ##  An advisory note --- avoid the Bill Murray re-make - the major themes are ""Lost in Translation.""",1511568000,,1205,5.116751269035533

623560,5,6303333079,"In 1946 this movie won the Academy award for best supporting actress ""Anne Baxter."" There is an all star cast including Tyrone Power and Gene Tierney. With all the star power the actors did not outshine the characters they were portraying. I will always think that Somerset Maugham looks like Herbert Marshall.

The screenplay by Lamar Trotti stuck close to the book by the same name and message of W. Somerset Maugham. A few adventures were compressed and maybe an improvement as far as this media goes. Tyrone Power ...Larry Darrell did get to do some things that were acts of W. Somerset Maugham in the book and it was difficult to imagine Gene Tierney ...Isabel Bradley was supposed to be a pudgy child.

Over all this is a story of different people from different backgrounds and how they deal with adversity. The main character has to figure out in his mind, why someone else had to die to save his life at the very end of the war? In the process of looking he goes to India and seeks help in understanding the way the world works. There alone in the mountains on the edge of dawn he has a revelation. He now must go back to the world and apply what he has learned.

Does he figure it out his dilemma?",1501459200,,1207,4.403587443946188

what i i don't like is that i am unable to resolve the issue of accidently renting this movie.  i meant to buy this movie one evening when i came home from work.  i know this movie well and before it even just barely began with intros i realized i was renting not buying this movie;  there is no undo button once the movie is started and Amazon is trying to charge to a cancelled credit card.  i suppose that now i have some silly black mark on my credit history when i in fact am trying to be responsible;

Tyrone Power plays a former WWI pilot trying to find peace in post-WWI Chicago, Paris, India, and the French Riviera always pursued by Gene Tierney, a rich, spoiled, self-centered girl who never grows up or give up her demand for money.

The scene which shows her gliding down the stairs to him in that black dress with the fringed shawl just takes your breath away. The two of them were so beautiful! And Clifton Webb?

A man suffering from war-time PTSD searches for peace of mind. Yet, when we think he has recovered, he is deceived by the shallow and cruel fianc. It is a test of his ability to understand those who are consumed by materialism. Yet, the story oversimplifies the drive in most humans to live well and be happy. It is a religious film, no doubt, which teaches the lower class to be happy with its lot.",1481932800,,530,4.363636363636363

Though not quite as good as the book, performances by actors such as Clifton Webb help make up for it.

623733,5,6303333079,"I would call this mid-century Schmaltz, but with great direction, fabulous source material (well transferred to screen) and a to-die-for cast, how can I? I am reminded, watching this, what a great actor, and leading man Tyrone Power was. I mean, come on, was there ever a more handsome man on the sliver screen? And Gene Tierney? Be-still my beating heart. What makes this Hollywood System production more than just another assembly line effort is, again, the story. The source story -- about a young man, home from WWI and literally wandering the world to find meaning -- is from W. Somerset Maugham, who becomes a character in the film, played fabulously by the late, great Herbert Marshall. Another seemingly forgotten star, John Payne accepted, and plays quite well, a secondary part. And, two words: Clifton Webb. The guy pretty much defined ""great character actor"". But the headline here is Power, and Anne Baxter's Oscar-winning turn as a woman who descends into alcoholism and worse when a great tragedy (no spoilers) befalls her. Top notch American Studio System stuff.",1478995200,12,1078,5.027932960893855

The Pros: Anne Baxter, the sets and Gene Tierneys dresses.
The Cons: Everything else.

 I haven't read William Somersets novel so I don't know if it was different but I hope to goodness it was. When I read the premise (an average Joe with a case of deer in the headlights searching for truth and adventure) of this film I thought I was really going like it but it only turned out to be a boring, irritating mess that doesnt mesh well or add up to anything worthwhile. It was horrible!

I kept waiting for all the aristocratic surface blow jibber jabber to simmer down and the story to start picking up and creating tension and conflict but anywayWOW. Ten minutes, twenty minutes, thirty minutes, forty minutes you could tell it was not going anywhere. I kept looking at the box and the second hand on my DVD player thinking Good grief. When is this going to get interesting?

The screenplay never really scratched underneath the surface and I didn't get to know enough about the psychology of these characters to make me care about themexcept maybe Anne Baxters good girl turned fallen woman Sophie.
Edmund Goulding (the director) could have spent more time:

1. Delving into Larrys philosophical questions (does he want to know if God exists or not, if so then why do bad things happen, is man basically good or evil, where does he come from, who is he, where is he going? Is he a Christian, Atheist, Deist, Pantheist, Relativist, etc?)

2. Showed more of the details of his adventures (more of what EXACTLY went on at the mountain)

3. Given Sophie more screen time and development

4. MOST IMPORTANTLY cut out about NINETY PERCENT of the family soap opera with Gene Tierney and Clifton Webb and we would have a MUCH BETTER FILM. I have no use for the idle rich and their whining about the problems with their romances and everyday lives. And it just went on and on to nowhere.

THE FILM HAD NO ENDING EITHER! Edmund Goulding didn't know how to end it! It was without crescendo or impact at the final!
The editing is pathetic. Too many unnecessary boring scenes drawn out. The ballroom at the beginning could easily have been trimmed down to two minutes. Ditto to the scene where Tyrone Power (Larry) and Gene Tierney (Isabel) are on their second dateyou know the scene where shes wearing the black dress. After the actors exit a scene, we get a ten second stare at the blank screen with nothing going on until a very slow dissolve.

Ever seen worse visual effects?the soundstage Indian mountains and lakes outside the windows?

Also, some of the most putrid acting everSoporific Power, (all good looks with a monotone voice) Syrupy Tierney and Wooden Clifton. (His death scene was obviously supposed to evoke sympathy but I just wanted to him to shut up and leave the screen.)
Only Anne Baxter (Sophie) brings some class to the proceedings (her descent into madness and dissipation in the bar and bawdy house and confrontation with Tierney are the most genuine moments) but she couldn't save the film for me since everything else was just so darn terrible.

Avoid this campy movie.",1421625600,6,3339,4.766031195840554

Larry starts on a  journey for the eternal ""why"" these things happen.  I can't recount the entire plot here but it is a movie that makes you think.  The cast is one of the finest ever assembled: Herbert Marshall, Clifton Webb, Gene Tierney, Anne Baxter (won Oscar for her portrayal)and  John Payne. (Yes John Payne...)

I think it has one of the finest musical scores ever written for a picture.

The cast, headed up by Tyrone Power, Anne Baxter, a radiant Gene Tierney and the always great Clifton Webb, is first rate. I enjoyed the film for the dynamics between the clearly drawn characters.

624329,5,6303333079,"I refer you to the excellent review by Michael C. Smith. I've seen ""The Razor's Edge"" several times and enjoyed it each time. As other reviewers have said. Tyrone Power's looks get in the way. It is hard to imagine a man so physically gifted looking for a purpose to life. The story takes place just after  World War I- and appears  as a raucus madhouse with people in carbarets, restaurants, on the streets, everywhere hyperactive, somewhat hysterical, as though it had been ordained the world was about to end. Tyrone Power is two different men in this film: the sophisticated tuxedo-clad  lover of the shallow socialite Isabel, and the bohemian with a beret on his head mixing with the masses and climbing the Himalayans all the while seeking truth.  Like Father Perot in ""Last Horizons"" far eastern gurus seem to possess a great knowledge not shared elsewhere on the planet. Of course  many famous people have visited the far east in search of enlightenment. But would Tyrone Power's Larry? Tyrone Power nevertheless does a splendid job and you will agree with narrator Somerset Maugham's (Herbert Marshall) remark that if there is goodness in the world, Larry has it. Gene Tierney is perfect as Isabel. She plays the spoiled socialite so convincingly you almost feel she is playing herself.

Two performances in ""Razor"" deserve special attention: Anne Baxter's Sophie and Clifton Webb's Elliot. Anne Baxter is required to portray a rather dowdy girl looking definitely homespun next to the elegant Isabel, her friend. This would be a role many actresses would shun but Anne takes the bit in her teeth and delivers a superb performance of the emotionally disintegrating girl whose sufferings will grab at your heart. (She won the Academy Award for this portrayal). Clifton Webb is perfect as the prissy,old-maidish  Elliott, Isabel's uncle, who loses his vast fortune in the Stock Market crash of 1929.

 Clifton Webb has the genius to make you laugh and at the same time love him. The scenes of his clothes expedition in a tony men's boutique are simply hilarious but you will feel for him when he lies dying alone, his aristocratic friends shunning him. He remarks, though that he is sure to find a posh existence in heaven. Herbert Marshall as Somerset Maugham expertly and comfortably narrates the story and holds the many strings of the plot together. ""Razor""  is a very elegant production, woven with a great deal of loving care and full of nuances that will delight you if you pay close attention. Perhaps the story can be broken down to the age old conflict- good (Larry) vs. evil (Isabel). It is a masterpiece.",1350604800,,2623,4.874157303370787
624330,5,6303333079,"I must disagree with the reviewer who felt that Tyrone Power was too old for this role. Nobody came back from WWI looking young. And, too handsome??? Why would Isabel fall so passionately in love with him and stay in love with him for so many years if he wasn't handsome. I consider Tyrone Power to be the handsomest man I've ever seen - anywhere. That face, those eyes - they are what make this man's behavior so believable. This movie would be nothing without Tyrone Power. He makes the whole thing believable. I have a friend who saw him in person once and she said he had a triple row of eyelashes and was just as handsome in person as he was on the screen. I damned near went into mourning when he died...Now, he was, indeed, too old for The Eddy Duchin Story.  All that cavorting around like a college kid in the first part of it was ridiculous considering the fact that he was much older in that than he was in Razor's Edge.  R.E. is another of those wonderful B&W movies photographed and acted perfectly with a wonderful script. Thanks to the studio for not throwing in a happy ending for Sophie as they were so prone to do in those days. I will look at this movie over and over just for that wonderful Power face and for the magic that Clifton Webb can create so easily apparently. Herbert Marshall, a much under appreciated actor incapable of giving a bad performance, is perfect.  I have never seen the Bill Murray version as, of course, he was neither handsome enough nor young enough for the role and certainly not capable of performing the role done so brilliantly by Tyrone Power.

I love two parts of this movie - first, when Isabel condemns Sophie (Anne Baxer) as being ""bad, bad, bad - she's soused from morning 'til night"" and Somerset Maugham says to Isabel ""I call a person bad who lies and cheats and is unkind.""  In actuality, that's what Isabel is/does - she lies and cheats and is unkind, but the irony of that statement doesn't dawn on her.

The second best part is when Larry meets the Indian spiritual guru and the guru reiterates what most religions say about paths to God - ""three paths lead to God:  Faith and worship - good works performed for the love of God - and knowledge through wisdom."" The secret - ""the three paths are but one path"".",1331856000,2,848,4.451612903225806
624332,5,6303333079,"I have admired old movies since I was in high school.  Now in my 50's, I have seen many of the acknowledged classics from Hollywood's Golden Age of the 1930's and 1940's.

But for some reason, 1946's ""The Razor's Edge"" eluded me.  It's not as well known as staples such as ""Casablanca"" and ""Gone With The Wind"".  It was not often shown on television at least when I was watching.

Thank goodness for Turner Classic Movies and their splendid program ""The Essentials"" with film historian Robert Osborne and co-host this year Drew Barrymore (of the John, Ethel, and Lionel Barrymore acting dynasty). This program featured the ""The Razor's Edge"" over the  weekend.

Within minutes of the opening credits, I was drawn into the world depicted by W. Somerset Maugham.  As Arthur Miller's vivid, fluid camera glided across a backdrop of well-appointed young men and women in 1920's finery dancing in a moonlit garden, I felt an immediate intimacy with these folks from a bygone age. I wanted to immerse myself in their lives.

Most people are familiar with this story about a man's search for life's meaning.  Suffice it to say that it is magnificently and tastefully translated into film in every department from the aforementioned photography to the direction, acting, music, sets, costumes, and so on.  Moviemaking at its finest.

Maugham was a master storyteller and his dialogue is graceful, often pungent, and sometimes satirical. Yet you feel that he empathized with his complex characters despite their frailties.

As I mentioned, this production is superb in every way.  In reference to the acting, it is uniformly brilliant by a sterling cast.  I was especially touched by Anne Baxter's Sophie.

Sophie could have easily been made into an obnoxious caricature-the drunken slut.  But through Baxter's intelligent and sensitive performance, you truly feel the depths of Sophie's despair from the deaths of her husband and child.  You recognize that Sophie is basically a good person trying to escape terrible pain by indulging in alcohol and promiscuity.

To me, there aren't many great films being made today.  And there are no more great STARS.  The old movie stars had talent and then some.  They were classy, dignified, and magnetic.  They knew how to carry themselves, how to speak, and even how to dress.  They brought a kind of elegance and beauty to the screen which no longer exists.

It's too bad.  But at least we have DVD's to remind us of a more cultured and glamorous time in the movies.  And thanks, Amazon, for making these DVD's available to customers at an affordable price.",1331424000,4,2592,4.939814814814815

Directed by Edmund Goulding

After several years' service with the Marines in World War II, Tyrone Power made his much anticipated return to the screen in The Razor's Edge. Power is appropriately cast as disillusioned World War I vet Larry Darrell, who returns from hostilities questioning his old values. To find himself, Larry joins several other members of the Lost Generation in Paris. He is disillusioned once more when the society woman whom he loves, Isabel Bradley (Gene Tierney), marries another for wealth and position. She returns to Larry's life to break up his romance with unstable, alcoholic Sophie MacDonald (Anne Baxter in a powerhouse Oscar-winning performance). After Sophie's death, Larry determines that the life offered him by Isabel is not to his liking, and continues seeking his true place in the scheme of things.

The Razor's Edge was based on the novel by W. Somerset Maugham, who appears on screen in the form of Herbert Marshall. The film re-teamed Tierney and Webb two years after their appearance together in Laura (1944)

The Razor's Edge garnered an Oscar win for Anne Baxter and nominations for Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (Clifton Webb) and B&W Art Direction.

624426,5,6303333079,"What do you want from life? What does it all mean in the end? Why should one man die & another man live? Is it all just arbitrary?

Here's a sumptuous adaptation of the Somerset Maugham novel about one man's search for answers to those questions. It's done in grand Hollywood style, with a fine cast, beautiful sets, and sharp dialogue. Granted, it takes some minor liberties with the source material, and the acting style isn't as naturalistic as modern viewers might expect. But I think those are quibbles, and don't interfere with the movie as a whole.

Tyrone Power has the most difficult part, in that he has to play the seeker Larry Darrell according to the stylized conventions of screen piety at the time. Even so, his slightly stiff & detached performance does convey the sense of someone not quite in synch with the everyday world, someone who's still looking for something solid & real. He never comes across as a prig or stuffed shirt -- rather than seeming above everyone else, he seems apart from everyone else. He's naive in some ways, but he's not stupid. And his empathy for & acceptance of his friends, just as they are, is obvious.

The rest of the cast is quite good as well. Gene Tierney's Isabel is stunningly beautiful, with just the right balance of coolness & yearning ... and as we see later, capable of vindictive cruelty. John Payne's millionaire could easily have been a stock villain, the Crass Rich Man, but instead he's simply a decent human being whose temperament lends itself to the business world. Anne Baxter may be a little bit over the top, but her character has earned that right. Certainly her self-destructiveness is all too familiar to many of us.

And then we come to the standout performances, to my mind: Clifton Webb's wonderfully waspish snob, Uncle Eliot, and Herbert Marshall's depiction of Somerset Maugham himself. Webb manages to make a vain, essentially shallow man somehow as endearing as he is annoying, while Marshall makes the presence of the author within his own story (as in the novel) totally convincing.

Again, modern audiences used to location shooting might wince at the studio sets of India, or the white actor playing an Indian spiritual teacher. Well, this was the custom at the time, and allowances should be made for it. And the guru of no fixed ethnic background works on an archetypal level: the Wise Old Man. Taken as a symbol, rather than as an individual, he's quite acceptable, not unlike Sam Jaffe's elderly monk in ""Lost Horizon.""

It's also fascinating to see how much adult material they managed to include, despite the restrictions of the Hays Code. Without being explicit, they make clear Isabel's intention to trap Larry by getting pregnant. And in Maugham's encounter with a worldly French police officer, the novelist's homosexuality is discreetly & sympathetically referenced. The grown-ups in the audience would understand it all immediately, while such material would simply go over the heads of any children.

Some may prefer Bill Murray's remake, which is certainly more authentic in its Indian scenes. But overall, it's not as strong as the original, and Bill hasn't quite found the balance of comedy & drama that worked so perfectly in ""Groundhog Day."" Sometimes a bit of artifice just winds up working better than authenticity.

For those who wonder if there's more to life than money & status, this is an indispensible film. Most highly recommended!",1219363200,11,3444,4.895368782161235
624427,4,6303333079,"The film version of W. Somerset Maugham's novel ""The Razor's Edge"" must have been another of Darryl F. Zanuck's shameless bids for a best picture Oscar, an obsession with the producer from the moment his 1944 film ""Wilson,"" a biography of the U.S. president, failed to win the gold. The Academy had demonstrated, as they continue to do, that ""prestige"" pictures, movies that aspire to more than entertainment, were favored over lighter fare, and Zanuck made it a point to have at least one such attraction made at 20th Century Fox each year until he got his hands on the top prize.

""The Razor's Edge"" earned a best picture nomination, but failed to reach the finish line (""The Best Years of Our Lives"" was named the year's best). Few films of the era were as ""prestigious"" as this one from Maugham's acclaimed philosophical novel, but its ""importance"" seems forced.

The studio's number one glamour boy, Tyrone Power, plays Larry Darrell, a man so disillusioned by his experiences in World War I that he now rejects society, as well as the love of his socialite fiancee (Gene Tierney), in favor of loafing in Paris and investigating spirituality in India.

It's an unlikely theme for a glossy studio film, but as noted earlier, Zanuck wanted that Oscar, the kind of worldly honor Larry Darrell finds so meaningless. It was Anne Baxter, as a woman who turns to the bottle and whom Darrell attempts to save after her family is killed in an automobile accident, who took home an Oscar. Others in the cast were equally deserving.

Clifton Webb is as wittily acerbic as Tierney's uncle as he was as her employer in ""Laura"" two years earlier. Webb was one of Hollywood's most uncloseted homosexuals in his day, and the veiled references to homosexuality are among the most intriguing aspects of ""The Razor's Edge."" Author Maugham was another homosexual who broke free of the closet years before mainstream society had heard of Gay Liberation, and he turns up in the film as narrator and a principal character. Played by Herbert Marshall, Maugham's sexuality is referred to in the kind of subtle manner characteristic of 40's cinema. ""I always get the queerest feeling from Mr. Maugham,"" Tierney says, and when he's questioned about his involvement with a murdered woman, he is easily cleared of any suspicion that he was romantically involved with her. With an arch of an eyebrow, the policeman tells Maugham that, from all he has heard about the writer, it's obvious she was ""not his type"" (nudge, nudge).

For all its pretensions, ""The Razor's Edge"" is still a good show. All that gloss would normally make me retch, as would all that highbrow philosophy, but together they make an interesting combination.

624462,4,6303333079,"Well directed and acted, The Razor's Edge is a minor epic of sorts. It is polished, classy, lavish; has a large budget and cast (but not of thousands); and spans a series of earthshaking events of historical significance. W. Somerset Maugham sees us all living on the edge of peril in one way or another. Most do so unsuspectingly; a few as a matter of volition. Maugham takes us on a journey through the lives of a group of friends from their post-World War One, halcyon days to the dark years following the 1929 stock market crash.
  As the story begins, the main characters, unaware of their fate, live precariously close to the edge of ruin. For Isabel and Gray Maturin (Gene Tierney, John Payne) it is financial; Sophie Macdonald (Anne Baxter) has no bulwark against the whips of `outrageous fortune' in her family life; and Maugham's good ""chum,"" Elliot Templeton (Clifton Webb), the persnickety, unmarried uncle, draws nearer to the end of his time on earth.
  Maugham fixes the source of human tragedy deeply within the heavens, not any flaw in individual character. Circumstance and the times we live in govern destiny, as mortals skirt the brink of disaster, helpless to prevent being sucked into a maelstrom of adversity. At one point, shocked and stunned by the news of Sophie's life of despair, Larry Darrel remarks, ""She was as normal as any person I know.""
  Only Darrell (Tyrone Power) embraces hardship consciously after undergoing a spiritual transformation brought about by the death of a friend who died saving his life during ""the war to end all wars."" He willing sacrifices love and career to `the death by a thousand cuts' by going on a life's journey, choosing the path of a wandering ascetic, working hard, parlous jobs; and seeks enlightenment from an Indian holy man residing on a remote mountain top to discover himself, and meaning in life. This element of the plot provides a few awkward moments for an otherwise entertaining film, but nevertheless, concerns a passage undertaken by like-minded mendicants since ancient times. Larry, above all, abides by the proverb ""Physician heal thyself,"" and acquires a measure of spiritual power to rejuvenate spent souls. But, he is no match for the cunning, `unenlightened' Isabel.
  The Maturins, living like the fable halcyon perched near the jagged edge of a precipice, have made their nest too close to a raging sea. After the great crash, they discover there is nothing sure to build on; as did Sophie Macdonald, cruelly woken up from her dream of domestic bliss. Maugham's world is one great paradox, as observed by Duke Vincentio in Shakespeare's Measure for Measure: ""...merely, thou art death's fool; For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun, And yet runn'st toward him still."" Maugham's keen sense of irony is at its sharpest; for Larry Darrel, the enlightened warrior for peace, avoids the worst by holding the blade securely to his bosom; not letting it slip.
  Tyrone Power as the saintly, nave Larry Darrel appears to lack depth, but child-like innocence is characteristic of 'the pure in heart;' and is highly effective in his fair share of shock and revelation shots. Gene Tierney, Maugham's choice for the part, is at her best (it is hard to take your eyes off of her) and displays a variety of acting skills; likewise for Anne Baxter's moving performance as a fallen angel. Good-tempered, as in real-life, W. Somerset Maugham, flawless played by Herbert Marshall, is observer, and acts as advisor, mentor and councilor.
  The Razor's Edge is a very good piece of filmmaking; and, in spite of few weaknesses, never fails to entertain. This film combines a dramatized version of Maugham's insights into the human condition with some exceptional cinematography, making it a marvelous movie to watch.",1189814400,5,3789,4.958990536277603
624463,3,6303333079,"I am a huge Maugham fan and the novel on which this movie is based is nothing short of beautiful... he creates an entire world out of an admittedly artificial plot that would in the hands of lesser writers fall flat.

Sadly, that's what happens in this movie... the classic Hollywood actors, while charismatic in their own right, just don't pull this off.  Tyrone Power is the WORST choice for Larry that could have been made (he looks like a banker here with his stiff posture and slicked back hair, certainly not like a vagabond loafer).  Gene Tierney while perfect appearance wise for Isabel, played her far too coldly and one dimensionally.  The actor who played Elliott was really good though.

Still, the movie is avant-garde for its times in certain scenes, and was enjoyable enough to watch.  I'm just begging you to read the novel if you haven't already; there are some essential scenes that were left out of the movie, and the incredible detail of the book puts Larry's improbable spiritual journey into context (while in the film the enlightenment thing comes off laughably random).  This movie simplifies way too much for my liking, in favor of overacting and the pace of an adventure movie.",1183248000,3,1203,4.782608695652174

624465,3,6303333079,"The author of numerous novels, plays, and short stories, W. Somerset Maugham (1874-1965) was considered among the world's great authors during his lifetime, and although his reputation has faded over the years his work continues to command critical respect and a large reading public.  Published in 1944, THE RAZOR'S EDGE is the tale of a World War I veteran whose search for spiritual enlightment flies in the face of shallow western values.  It was Maugham's last major novel--and it was immensely popular.  Given that the novel's conflicts are internalized spiritual and philosophical issues, it was also an extremely odd choice for a film version--but Darryl F. Zannuck of 20th Century Fox fell in love with the book and snapped up the screen rights shortly after publication.

According to film lore, THE RAZOR'S EDGE was to be directed by the legendary George Cukor from a screenplay by Maugham himself--and it does seem that Maugham wrote an adaptation.  When the film went into production, however, Cukor was replaced by Edmund Goulding, a director less known for artistic touch than a workman-like manner, and the Maugham script was replaced with one by Lamar Trotti, the author of such memorable screenplays as THE OXBOW INCIDENT.  Tyrone Power, recently returned from military service during World War II, was cast as the spiritually conflicted Larry Darrell; Gene Tierney, one of the great beauties of her era, was cast as socialite Isabell Bradley.  The supporting cast was particularly notable, including Herbert Marshall, Anne Baxter, Clifton Webb, Lucille Watson, and Elsa Lanchester.  Both budget and shooting schedule were lavish, and when the film debuted in 1946 it was greatly admired by public and critics alike.

But time has a way of putting things into perspective.  Seen today, THE RAZOR'S EDGE is indeed a beautifully produced film--but that aside the absolute best one can say for it is that it acheives a fairly consistent mediocrity.  As in most cases, the major problem is the script.  Although it is reasonably close to Maugham's novel in terms of plot, it is noticeably off the mark in terms of character and it completely fails to capture the fundamental issues that drive the story.  We are told that Larry is in search of enlightenment; we are told that he receives it; we are told he acts on it--but in spite of the occasional and largely superficial comment we are never really told anything about the spiritual, artistic, philosophical, and intellectual processes behind any of it.  We are most particularly never told anything significant about the nature of the enlightenment itself.  It has the effect of cutting off the story at its knees.

We are left with the shell of Maugham's plot, which centers on the relationship between Larry and Isabell, a woman Larry loves but leaves due to the growing ideological riff that opens up between them.  Tyrone Power and Gene Tierney were more noted for physical beauty than talent, but both could turn in good performances when they received solid directorial and script support.  Unfortunately, that does not happen here; they are extremely one-note and Power is greatly miscast to boot.  Fortunately, the supporting cast is quite good, with Herbert Marshall, Clifton Webb, and Lucille Watson particularly so; the then-famous performance by Anne Baxter, however, has not worn as well as one would hope.

With a running time of just under two and a half hours, the film also feels unnecessarily long.  There is seemingly endless cocktail party-type banter, and indeed the entire India sequence (which reads as faintly hilarious) would have been better cut entirely--an odd situation, for this is the very sequence intended as the crux of the entire film.  Regardless of the specific scene, it all just seems to go on and on to no actual point.

As for the DVD itself, the film has not been remastered, but the print is extremely good, and while the bonus package isn't particularly memorable neither is noticeably poor.  When all is said and done, I give THE RAZOR'S EDGE three stars for production values and everyone's willingness to take on the material--but frankly, this a film best left Power and Tierney fans, who will enjoy it for the sake of the stars, and those whose ideas about spiritual enlightment are as vague as the film itself.

624470,4,6303333079,"Larry Darrell (Tyrone Power) is back from WWII with an insatiable desire to see the world, in search of himself and the meaning of life. Isabel Bradley (Gene Tierney) wants to marry, have children and build on the capitalistic advantages of post-war industry in the U.S. Like oil and water, the two ideas don't mix so Larry becomes an international ""loafer"" and to the delight of Isabel's self-absorbed uncle Elliot Templeton (Clifton Webb), she marries millionaire Gray Maturin (John Payne). It seems like a short and tidy story but this two-and-a-half hour epic had a 4-million dollar budget for 89 sets, 136 supporting actors and 16,000 extras.

In the beginning Isabel is meek and compassionate. As time progresses she becomes firm and decisive. But watch out when her possessiveness sees the light of day. Dock your boats; lock up the booze; hide anything remotely dangerous. Gene Tierney is in the house!

Some fault the performance of Tyrone Power. Like Glen Ford, James Stewart or Gregory Peck, Power is no character actor. What you see is the real him, even if it appears a bit melodramatic from his broadway background. The most dramatic role I've seen Power in is WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION. Though THE RAZOR'S EDGE requires less range of emotion, Power is quite similar.

THE RAZOR'S EDGE delivers the requisite intrigue to earn an Academy Award Oscar for Best Actress in a supporting role, two Golden Globes, and several nominations. There are times when Larry Darrell's indifference is irritating but that's why Isabel thought she dumped him. Despite some slow spots THE RAZOR'S EDGE includes enough suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat.

624471,4,6303333079,"With the ending of World War 2, the American film moved to a more mature product which suited the postwar gravity and no studio was more at the forefront than 20th Century Fox. Many of their films of this period stand up better today than any other studio's output. ""The Razor's Edge"" is a long version of Somerset Maugham's novel in which Larry Darrell, played by Tyrone Power, explores ""the meaning of life"". The novel was probably unfilmable so if this version is not completely faithful, it certainly cleverly ""adapts"" the story.

The film celebrated the return of Tyrone Power to Fox after war duty and although he had matured as an actor, he gives a monotonous and wooden performance as Darrell. In fairness, the role is probably impossible. There are some deep and meaningful monologues which Power delivers with suitable conviction but it is never clear exactly what he is looking for or what he finds along the way. The screenplay has too many holes. It seems to be God/religion but this may have been impossible to expound in 1946 Hollywood. In the end, Power is described as a truly good man which seems a little thin after such a long journey.

More intelligible is Larry Darrell's rejection of materialism and this theme still resonates today. Gene Tierney plays Isabel who loves Power but gives him up for money and social position. Tierney's character symbolises a shallow and and selfish existence. She perfectly captures a manipulative predatory female beneath good looks and gracious manners. She is also spectacularly photographed and gowned. Anne Baxter won an Oscar for her portrayal of the tragic Sophie and she is touching, if somewhat overblown. Her scene with  Tierney, who is like a serpent in the garden of Eden, when she takes to drink is riveting. When she finally succumbs to temptation, it is done with a minimum of histrionics. Clifton Webb as Tierney's snobbish uncle and Lucille Watson as her mother are excellent. Herbert Marshall plays Maugham himself and although he looks ill and haggard in some scenes, his commentary of the action is vital to the flow of the drama. John Payne plays the man Tierney marries for money and he is hopeless.

The film is sumptuously made with the exception of some poor backdrops in India which really undermine these crucial scenes. When Power leaves the hut in the mountains, the visuals are really over the top, heavy with symbolism and all but the angels singing! Edmund Goulding's direction uses long takes and sometimes you get the feeling that the movement of the actors, particularly Tierney and Power, is unnatural - move to position A, read lines, move to position B, turn etc. It is more like direction for the stage and it contributes to the static feeling the film engenders.

The DVD print is excellent and there is a worthwhile commentary which is neatly paced so you can watch the film at the same time. Two commentators share duties and they particularly remind us that Somerset Maugham was a giant in the literary world at the time the film was made. The other extras are minor. The film can be viewed as a biblical allegory and as such is quite successful. Otherwise, it may seem stilted and boring.",1156291200,5,3187,4.8083941605839415

What I need you to understand is that the film's central theme, that the life handed to us by society, that the life we are programmed into accepting unquestioningly and unreflectingly is one big fraud, is more relevant today than ever.  This film, more than any other, dares to ask the right question and shows us one man's search for one right answer.  It is a search that Tyrone Power's character begins in himself, and concludes in a world filled with friends who live falsely rather than truly, and have chosen the illusion of happiness over truth with the possibility of despair.  Take that journey with him ... you won't be disappointed.  That life of tirelessly struggling for wealth, power, fame, and pleasure cannot help us achieve real happiness, even though to rule over us in the name of order and organization, the structures of society must do their best to convince us that it will.  The answer to the question, why do we behave as we do, and live as we do, has got to be more than what we are told almost from the moment of birth ... why not.  This film says, living a good life, a happy life means walking on the edge, walking the tightrope from illusion to truth.  We can never hope to get all the way across, but, like any real-life tightrope, to stop means to perish.",1152662400,4,1419,4.4517374517374515
624516,4,6303333079,"A wonderful, home-hitting post war film that definitely succeeds in its touching and sometimes searing portrait of a young man searching for the meaning of life after witnessing such suffering, pain and sacrifice. After serving and surviving WWI, he is at a loss as to where to go from there.

Larry Darrell wants to find himself, but his need is not understood or appreciated by his fiance, the beautiful but selfish Isabel, who wants a good society position and money. Her stuffy, snobbish uncle Elliot wants Larry out of her life for those exact reasons - he's not wealthy enough. So we have the foundation for a watchable drama.

Gene Tierney looks lovely, and Tyrone Power (who, along with Dana Andrews, was one of her best leading men) more than matches her, and they look gorgeous together. Their performances are superb and flawless, and the same can be said for Clifton Webb, Herbert Marshall, John Payne, and of course, the Oscar-winning Anne Baxter as the ill-fated Sophie.

Biblical symbolism is evident in many of the scenes, and one cannot help but compare Isabel to Tierney's Oscar-nominated performance a year earlier in ""Leave Her To Heaven"". Isabel, like Ellen, is a manipulative, controlling and jealous woman, who wants Larry all to herself, even after she marries the gentle, wealthy Gray (John Payne), who doesn't realize how he's been used. Tierney's character is dressed in black and a floppy black hat when flaunting a drink in front of Sophie, tempting her like a serpent. And when Larry asks her about this incident, she proceeds to spin a lie, trying to make it look like an innocent misunderstanding, until he calls her on it. As with LHTH, she admits the truth with the line, ""I did it and I'd do it again!"", and goes into detail of how she did this for his own good, all for the love of him, trying to ""save him"" from what in her view was a disastrous mistake. How she could turn on a woman who was once her close friend is a question that, besides the jealousy factor, isn't really explained.

Baxter's portrayal of Sophie is brilliant, and she justly deserved the Oscar she received. Sophie is like Mary Magdalene or Eve, tempted by the demon liquor (no thanks to Isabel) and lured into prostitution, and Larry tries heroically and compassionately to save her. Her death is something that she began seeking after the tragic accident that claimed the lives of her husband and baby daughter. It is so easy to tear up during the sequence in the apartment when Sophie looks at the photograph of Isabel and Gray's eldest daughter and thinks about her own little girl that she lost, and Isabel almost looks sympathetic. After Larry tells a shocked Isabel of Sophie's demise, he compassionately and gently states, ""There's no need to be shocked about Sophie any longer, Isabel. I've had the feeling all day that Sophie's where she wants to be most - with Bob and Linda. I know that's a simple way to look at it, but it's comforting."" Marshall is wonderful as Maugham, the narrator, who observes all this drama and who comments on it, and who even goes so far as to appeal to Isabel's vanity in order to get back on her good graces. The scenes with Isabel and Gray's children are very sweet, with Isabel speaking to them in French (Tierney was fluent in that language, as she attended a finishing school in Europe). Larry can't bring himself to be angry with Isabel, despite what she's done, and Isabel can't bring herself to hurt Gray, as much as she loves Larry. And Larry's travels (although those bogus backdrops do little to convince that he actually is in those exotic locations), are a definite plus, his experiences shared with the viewer in order to find what he's looking for, and in a sense, to help us discover the meaning of life too. ""Do you know what it's like to see another man give up his life for you? That someone deliberately died so that you might go on living?"" Larry asks Isabel, who obviously has never experienced what he refers to. Even as she declares her love for him, regretting how she rejected his marriage proposal years before, we know that a life with Isabel is no longer in the cards. And when Larry says, ""Goodbye, Isabel, and take good care of Gray. He needs you now more than ever"", it is a fitting exit line as Power decides to continue on his journey of self-discovery.

""You see, my dear, goodness is no doubt the greatest force in the world, and he's got it,"" Maugham explains to a sorrowing and astonished Isabel, letting her (and the audience) know what quality Larry possesses and what he is in search of - goodness.

And we watch as Maugham's protagonist boards a ship, still in search of himself, but much more at peace.

It's well worth the running time, although the novel was very difficult to adapt to film, and it's a rewarding experience for those willing to sit down and absorb the message of ""The Razor's Edge"".",1141171200,13,4892,4.64203233256351
624517,5,6303333079,"I've taught this film in colleges for thirty-plus years.  Even back at the earliest screenings, traditional-aged freshmen had trouble with it (a) because it was in b&w, and (b) because the dimensional characters didn't telegraph plot advancement but instead used irony, wit, or assumptions that would later be proven wrong by subsequent events.

The first of these objections stunned me when they couldn't appreciate Gene Tierney descending the stairs to seduce ""Larry"" in a gown relegated to grays.  The second objection (young auduence confusion) just made me sad about the impact of television ... but you already know that story.

As with Hollywood's THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY, released in during the same general period, I personally appreciate the ""epic scope"" of the narrative, enhanced by remarkable set direction detail.  And I appreciate even more the depth-of-focus photography in both of these films, which enriches viewing by sharp images at several planes of action within the frame.  It's a story well-told at the visual level.

I've read complaints about Tyrone Power's ""dated"" acting in this performance, NIGHTMARE ALLEY, etc.  But again, I suspect this is from a generation more comfortable with MTV editing than with theatre as an entertainment criterion.  Power is given a series of difficult monologues to recite about uncinematic spiritual/ philosophical themes, and he pulls each off brilliantly.  As with Olivier's opening scene in RICHARD III, it's interesting to watch how these monologues have been directed to use a pacing movement of the actor within the frame as a ""paragraphing"" punctuation.  The lengthy, uninterrupted takes and consequent fluidity of camera movement within these shots not only enhances the impact of the monologues but also makes sly commentary on characters/ themes as continuous camera includes other characters in medium close-ups.

Herbert Marshall's Maugham is interesting and underplayed almost as masterfully as Cedrick Hardwicke's performance of ""goodness personified"" in ROPE.  The close-ups of ""Maugham's"" eyes to communicate ironic plot points may seem obtrusive, but they're true to Maugham's voice in the novel.

Further, they emphasize the ill-advised decision to omit this narrator's perspective in Murray's hapless remake.  That later film fails in no small part because the female characters are virtually indistinguishable visually, and because the studio (which only made the film to entice Murray to make GHOSTBUSTERS II) invested no interest in producing a good movie script.  Pity, since Murray could have done okay.

Two less successful scenes in the 40s version are the ""Baby!"" hospital melodrama and the ashram Jehovah sequences (not including the remarkably visual spiritual moment in the mountains).  But the supporting cast remains superb throughout--especially the bracing comedy of Webb and Lancaster, and the moving subtlety of John Payne and Lucille Watson.

Tierney's richest moments are linked to the plot:  ""That's all right, Larry.  It might be less than a year""; the wedding announcement over the phone; the camera-narrated scene where Isabel ""seduces"" Larry's fiancee; and, of course, the climax with Larry at the end.  And, by the way, she's as gorgeous as Tyrone Power!

How much more value can one expect from an entertainment that succeeds so well with complex, mature themes of spiritual redemption in a society of capitalist myopia?",1140134400,16,3428,5.450757575757576
624518,5,6303333079,"The plot synopsis above tells you the story line, and this very unconvential story is remarkable in having been made.  At a time when some other movies were being made in color, this was still in black and white, which tells you where the movie moguls placed it in ""rank"".  Color was reserved for block busters, and despite the epic sweep of this story, they didn't expect it to sell.  (Also, ""serious"" dramas were often done in B&W.)  It fits very well in black and white, both with it being set in the 1920s, and much of its story line is dark.
  Tyrone Power does some of his best acting work in this film.  Perhaps his military service deepened him, or the story line seemed more important and personal to him, but I believed his quest for something beyond the conventional, comfortable life.  Unfortunately, as a fan of Gene Tierney, I find this her worst work.  Even at her best she can be alittle blank, but here, a level of mental machinery is required of this manipulative, calculating character, and we are left always seeing only an beautiful empty surface.  Her eyes betray no inner life.  And yet, as soon as you dismiss her as an empty shell, she will have a really lovely moment of total truth, ususally in the most odd places.  She is perfectly cast as the pampered, narrow minded patrician.  She does look a bit like Kathryn Hepburn, who was considered for the role, but determined to not have enough charm -  and it is true.  Hepburn in this role would have had more fire and spirit, but not this genteel icy sweetness.  We do see why he loves her inspite of knowing how rotten she is.
  Contrast Tierney's blankness with a very young Anne Baxter who has a very demanding role; first mousy and insecure, heartbroken and heartbreaking, and then alcoholic and defeated.  She did deserve an award for her work here, and it should have been a lesson for the mannered, self-conscious diva she became in her later work.  This is some of her best, risk taking, work.  In a role that could have been a wallpaper tearing scene stealer, she is very contained and her struggle is with herself, inside.
  I saw the version with Bill Murray when it was in theatres.  I understood completely why he would want to make it, and he simply was not right for the role, not his acting ability, nor his personal qualities.  Tyrone Power, usually too pretty, hits just the right notes.  It is worth mentioning that the studio fought constantly to take religion out of this story which, ultimately, is about a religious quest - the way to live a life of meaning and rightness.  The resulting restraint, as with many classics, work in its favor.
  The commentary is very good on this DVD, discussing details like the long takes of the director, and how that influenced all the technical aspects, from lighting to acting style.  But the overwhelming stand out of this film is the story.  Thoughtful, different, and interesting, it overcomes any elements of dated presentation to make it remain a classic worth continued viewing.",1136937600,34,3021,4.62218045112782
624519,4,6303333079,"W. Somerset Maugham's brilliant novel, ""The Razor's Edge,"" was first brought to the big screen via this 1946 adaptation.  Tyrone Power stars as the idealistic Larry Darrell, with Gene Tierney taking a turn as his sometime girlfriend, Isabel Bradley.  As the film opens, Larry and Isabel are engaged and madly in love, but Larry's plan to ""loaf"" and discover himself soon breaks them apart.  Of course, this split is helped along by her family, particularly her snooty Uncle Elliot (Clifton Webb).  However, all participants involved find themselves meeting again and again over the years - sometimes in unlikely places.

""The Razor's Edge"" has many undeniably good qualities.  First, it's just a gorgeous looking movie, with a multitude of amazing sets; the movie deservedly received an Oscar nomination for art direction.  In addition, the direction by Edmund Goulding (""Grand Hotel"") is good, and the story zips along nicely despite its length.  Ultimately, the movie was rewarded with an Oscar nomination for best picture.

Unfortunately, the casting is questionable and the acting often less than stellar.  Tyrone Power has the requisite blandness to play Larry, but he sometimes actually exhibits a bit too much edge.  Larry is supposed to be nave: the paragon of goodness.  However, Powers can't quite pull off this difficult task and become the ""remarkable creature"" about which Maugham wrote.  Anne Baxter won an Oscar for her supporting role as the alcoholic Sophie, but she actually comes off worst of all.  She simply does not possess the range needed to portray Sophie, as is painfully clear in the Paris nightclub scenes.  Clifton Webb also received an Oscar nomination for supporting actor.  He's appropriately bitchy, but his performance is over-the-top in his critical final scenes, draining much of the pathos from the finale.

The script by Lamar Trotti (""The Ox-Bow Incident"") is quite faithful to the novel, which is unusual for a book with such a complicated storyline.  Unfortunately, in including so much of the basic plot, the soul of the book has somehow been diluted.  The book tackles issues of philosophy and life, but the movie focuses a bit too much on the surface, resulting in a soap opera rather than a soul-searching treatise that the book manages to be.  Of course, criticizing a movie because it doesn't live up to its source material is not completely fair.  In addition, overall ""The Razor's Edge"" is a fine movie that is likely to be enjoyed by many audiences, whether they have read the book or not.  Despite its flaws, ""The Razor's Edge"" is solid 1940s filmmaking.  Highly recommended.",1119225600,14,2626,5.08411214953271

as for the DVD, it is a good clean transfer. the only true extra is the commentary. it is still well worth the money.",1118793600,57,660,4.7894736842105265
624521,3,6303333079,"The beautiful Gene Tierney is lucky to have ""Laura"" and ""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir"" to her credit because the wicked women she plays here and in ""Leave Her to Heaven"" (in both she engineers the deaths of sympathetic characters) might have typecast her. She has never been more ravishing  than she is in ""The Razor's Edge,"" which makes her various manipulations all the more cunning.

And in this story of a privileged young loafer in search of, well, maybe his soul (it's never made clear), it is Miss Tierney who nails the character in a single line: ""Oh, Larry, what you need is a psychiatrist!"" It would seem so. After almost two hours of rejecting her and lucrative jobs, we last see him alone on a tramp steamer bound for America to become a taxicab driver. This is a happy ending, by the way.

Tyrone Power is certainly sincere as the soul-searcher, and he does get to kiss Elsa Lanchester, with whom he would much later appear in ""Witness for the Prosecution."" Somerset Maughm made himself a character in the novel on which the film is based, and Herbert Marshall acquits himself nicely in the role. Clifton Webb is unusually effective as the kind of insufferable snob he also plays (with Tierney) in ""Laura.""

Maughm's stories are always engrossing, and this all-star screen adaptation is sinfully entertaining, given the restrictions at the time of Hollywood's production code and the Catholic Church's Legion of Decency. It is told on a broad canvas that cries out for real locations (Paris! London! India!) but is confined to lavish studio settings. Up for numerous Academy Awards, only Anne Baxter in a supporting role, as a dypsomanical widow, walked off with one.

Although Edmund Goulding directed, producer Darryl Zanuck called the tune, except for (literally) a little song Goulding composed that later became popular as ""Mamselle."" The black-and-white cinematography in this DVD transfer looks terrific, and there's a spare but gossipy commentary. Would that the script had more spiritual clarity and less moralizing. But at least it's better than the dismal 1984 remake (on actual locations this time) starring, of all actors, the comedian Bill Murray in his first dramatic role.",1117843200,6,2196,4.9727520435967305
624522,5,6303333079,"The newly released DVD of 20th Century Fox's production of W. Somerset Maugham's ""The Razor's Edge"" is a cinematic treasure. The direction by Edmond Goulding is top notch and captures the glamour and decadence of post World War I Paris in glittering perfection. Much praise must go to the art and set direction by Richard Day and Nathan Juran. Over 80 sets were constructed; some only glimpsed for a few moments evoke the period and splendor of the time and place. The production values of this picture are of the highest quality of this, Fox's ""Important Picture for 1946"".Goulding was famous for long takes and he is aided by the brilliant cinematographer Arthur C. Miller. The score by Alfred Newman is magnificent though surprisingly sparse for a film from the 1940's His use of source music and songs of the period help to inform the viewer of character and mood. His main theme is majestic and stirring and its reprise at the end is something near to epic played against a close-up of Tyrone Power and dissolves into the crashing waves against a tramp steamer.

  Though a little too old and too handsome for the role of Larry Darell Tyrone Power, turns in a beautifully felt performance of a man in search for himself and his place in the world. A very modern and complex idea for the 1940's involving a trip to India and consultations with a guru. Gene Tierney is perfect as the woman who loves him and will stop at nothing to get him. This underrated beauty gives one of her best performances in an unsympathetic role.  Anne Baxter, who won her Oscar as Sophie, is at times touching, real and yet manages to chew her share of the scenery toward the end of the picture. She is just plain fun to watch.  But the picture is completely stolen by the wonderful, prissy and perfect performance of Clifton Web. His bravery as an actor in his last scene when he cries ""There are going to be fireworks"" is to be applauded. He perfectly captures the futile collapse of a shallow man as not many in Hollywood at that time might have dared.

  There is one scene that epitomizes the skill and craft of film making in the end of the golden age and that is the chapter on the DVD entitled ""Last Fling"". All the powers of the actors, director, cinematographer, set designers, lighting technicians, and composer come together in this nearly silent montage and the subsequent scene at dawn in Tierney's Paris apartment. Larry's and Isabel's night on the town moves through a sumptuous Paris nightclub, to a Russian restaurant, and on to a hot jazz club where a fist fight ensues. Watch the extras in this scene. They are the stars here and each have a tale to tell in there brief moments on screen. I was reminded of Scorsese's Coconut Grove scenes in ""The Aviator"" by this impeccably directed montage and wondered if it had in fact influence him being the film historian he is.

  But the best is yet to come, upon arriving home Isabel and Larry move through a brilliantly choreographed scene that leads up to a kiss and then a rejection. There is no dialog, only the pantomime of the actors and the accompaniment of the musical score. In this we learn all we need to of her motives and desire and his reaction and acceptance. It is very sexy and intense and the only bit of clothing that is lost is her shawl.

  It is brilliant and movie storytelling at its best.

  There is also a wonderful commentary by film historians Anthony Slide and Robert Brichard. Also included is a Fox Movietone News reel of other aspects relating to the film. Don't miss this wonderful classic from Fox's brilliant Studio Classics collection. They really know how to present their treasures to us as few other studios do.",1117065600,131,3696,4.601217656012176

He was looking for self-realization and god-realization.  His journey began in the war.  Why was he alive and others died?  What was his purpose? It had to be more than this daily existance.  His experiences had given him reason to ponder more than the ordinary life.  He had to find the finer path to walk, that razors edge.  Not quite here and not quite there. With what he learned he also was trying to help others as well. The coin with Sophies husband got him back on his feet.  The invitation before the death of the Uncle.

They did not understand my feelings for the movie but still enjoyed it.  I am now going to read the book again (I lost the book twice and had to hunt to purchase two more copies!)

The first 30 minutes were superb -- as was Clifton Webb as Elliott Templeton.  Tyrone Power just didn't seem like the right match to me -- he was perhaps a trifle guarded and meticulous in his portrayal of the winsome and quixotic Larry Darrell.
Also, too many totally unnecessary, not to mention disconcerting, deviations from the text result as well.  These include, but are not limited to: Larry's supposedly rough and bearded appearance when he returns from India (he comes back not only clean shaven but in a suit), Isabel (instead of Larry) recommends the vulgar bar where they meet Sophie, Isabel leaves to the dentist AFTER (not before) Sophie arrives, Larry accuses Isabel of getting Sophie drunk (instead of Maugham), Isabel and Gray arrive before Elliott dies (instead of after), and last but certainly not least, Suzanne Rouvier, a rather paramount character in the novel, is conspicuously absent from the ENTIRE movie.

624547,5,6303333079,"I've just been rewatching this with my daughter.  It's an example of a film that does justice to its book.  No, it exceeds that.  The film's structure is leaner than Maugham's book.  You know, less 'novelistic' and more 'cinematic'.  In this case, the heightened drama helps contrast the high-societal nature of Paris/Chicago with proletarian life (anywhere) and spiritual life (Indian Himalayas and inside).
It was sheer chance, at age 16, that I turned on a very early a.m. broadcast channel in Los Angeles and saw this for the first time.  Actually, it had begun already, and I saw very soon the 'sunrise scene' which serves as an objective correlative for Larry Darrell's (Tyrone Power's) enlightenment.  I started 'seeking' from that point.
Maybe this is what 'critical theorists' mean when they urge us to ferret out contradictions: the irony that Hollywood 'sells' the repudiation of material acquisition.
I bought the message.
Wonderful performances by Ty Power (catch him reading Keats!), Gene Tierney, classic Clifton Webb, great voice-overs by one of the greatest film voices, Herbert Marshall (as Maughm), and young Anne Baxter as the lost Sophie.  Post WWII 'dark' recuperation at its best.

624548,5,6303333079,"Words fall short in the praise of this remarkably uplifting and thoroughly enjoyable film that dares to show an individual in pursuit of the Sublime -- that elusive commodity explored by the classical Roman Longinus in his treatise, ""On the Sublime,"" a seminal work of inspiration to the Renaissance over a thousand years afterwards. This landmark movie might have anticipated the Sixties idealists who tried, however tragically and unsuccessfully, to turn away from monetary and social success to find their souls -- only this movie's hero, admirably portrayed by Tyrone Power, does not fail.
The film goes where venal Hollywood rarely ventures: the spiritual longing in all our hearts that demands that we take ourselves away from the distractions and illusions of success that Society dangles before us. This movie is a defining work on the pursuit of inner peace and perfection in the real world, the heroic, quixotic pursuit of the ""Life Worth Living."" It explores with dazzling creativity -- plot, script, casting and direction -- the timeless ""what if"" proposition. What if a man with everything going for him -- good looks, a ""goddess"" for a fiance, money, social graces and social position -- realized that Holy Scripture was right when it said, ""Vanity, vanity, all is vanity""? What would happen in the 20th century if, like Eliseus when the prophet Elias threw his holy cloak over him, our protagonist turned away from the pursuits of the world to pursue Truth alone -- without compromise in any way?
If you have ever wanted a little encouragement in thinking on the level of the sublime, ever yearned to live your one-and-only life in accordance with God's holy plan, then this film is for you. Oddly enough, it doesn't preach -- that's for non-artistic bumblers like myself futilely trying to capture the essence of the film to do! -- and even more oddly enough, it is ultimately a ""feel-good"" film. It never compromises, but remains intellectually and artistically honest. A masterful tour de force of the human spirit seeking to triumph over the profane, ""The Razor's Edge"" is for us all. How can we do other than rejoice with the inspired cast, crew and director who told this tale of the spiritual ""knight errant"" armed only with his curiosity and a seeking heart to find meaning in life? How hard has each age sought to find meaning in our short span here on Earth? And if this movie does not give us the final answers -- again, it doesn't preach, and so it never pretends to answer the questions -- it holds aloft some of the essential questions. It is, after all, up to us to answer them as the Spirit moves us individually.
Bravo to those who had the courage and integrity to make this epic film for us. We are the better for it. How rarely does art ever try for the Sublime -- then make it so thoroughly enjoyable! How fortunate for us when art like this succeeds. Longinus, your quest continues!",1077667200,5,2918,4.78019801980198
624549,5,6303333079,"I heartily recommend this film for fans of the ""classic hollywood"" genre. Yes, you can find minutia to criticize as with everthing, but really, for a film to capture the ""times"" of the 1920's and 1930's, this film does a fine job. If anything lacks, it's the budget. I really wish the production had more money and the director could have actually filmed in Paris and in India. You can tell that all of the scenes were essentially shot in Hollywood on staged sets. But I loved the acting from all of the characters. I think Anne Baxter deservedly earned her academy award. She does not overact at all! She does a beautiful job of acting. And Tyrone Powers, while understated, does a fine job. And Tierney is beautiful and emotes every bit of the cunning and ulterior motives throughout this film. I also thought the actor who plays Maughm does a masterfully subtle acting job that makes you think he really is the actual author!!
What's so masterful about this film is that it focuses solely on the characters portrayed and you want to find out what happens to Larry. I wish the film could have gone into greater detail about Larry's experience in India. It's a bit too superficial but then, for hollywood, what do you expect??
I also care about Larry and I really wanted to see Ann Baxter's character saved. And the important moral lesson is that you can't save everyone in this universe! And not everyone is bound for ""success.""  It's not in the cards. And that's a very powerful message that seems to be forgotten today. We glorify tragedy but films don't explore what Larry explored. What does it all mean????  American Beauty was a more modern attempt at it, and I liked that film.
But The Razor's Edge makes you think about the metaphysical and what your purpose in life is all about. If you are cocky and arrogant, then you will never find wisdom. If you are humble and are filled with questions, you will get closer to enlightenment. Death does make angels of us all and Ann Baxter's character found peace once dead. May seem tragic but
life is not fair nor just. Life is not ""what should be"" but what is.""
See this film. It's good for the soul and the mind.",1065225600,13,2166,4.5229591836734695
624550,4,6303333079,"This film has achieved ""classic"" status, yet it looks a bit shop-worn and creaky in some respects, when approached from a modern perspective. This is, overall, a highly stylized treatment of Maugham's novel. Scriptwriter Lamar Troti definitely focuses on the melodramatic elements of Larry Darrel's spiritual odyssey. Maugham was a highly realistic novelist. His subtle wit and sharp observations are buried under here in the moviemaker's wallowing in the bathetic.
  The performers, with the exception of Clifton Webb as Uncle Elliot and Herbert Marshall as Somerset Maugham, are decidedly from the ""studied"" school of drama. Tyrone Power, in particular, is at times painful to watch, especially in the scenes opposite Tierney. Such emoting might work on stage, but before a camera, the overblown gestures, lack of facial expression, and wooden delivery border on the farcical. Tierney is a delight to look at, but her emotive range is severely limited as well. She seems to have two modes: coquettish or angry. Sure, this stylized sort of performance was the order of the day in 40s Hollywood, but it looks really dated these days. And there were exceptions, even then. One can well imagine what actors the caliber of Olivier and Leigh would have done with the roles. Anne Baxter, who received a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her performance as the unfortunate Sophie, is also guilty of overacting, at least by naturalistic standards. She could have used a dose or two of Ibsen.
  Which brings us to the two bright spots, performance wise. Clifton Webb probably would have won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar, had he not received one two years earlier for his work in ""Laura."" His death bed scene, though maudlin as all get out, is nonetheless unforgettable. The man had a knack for line delivery. He made a character with despicable motives and questionable morals, somehow sympathetic, even loveable. Herbert Marshall delivers an understated, brilliant portrayal of author Maugham. As reviewer Bernie mentions, it's easy to make the mistake when we envision Maugham in our mind's eye as looking identical to Marshall. I thought the first time I viewed the film that it was Maugham playing the part, as it's not a polished or studied performance in the least. He acts as if he's too shy to actually face the camera in most scenes, which fits the character perfectly. Most of the time he is the half reluctant, frequently uncomfortable observer, standing on the perifery, making mental notes for his next novel. A great piece of acting.
Even though the lead actors turn in stagey performances and the script may not be true to the tone of Maugham's novel, the movie still ""works"" on many levels. It's too good a story to completely mess up. If you can accept it as a product of cinematic trends of the era and allow that audiences of the time bought into the concept that over emoting and over gesticulating was something screen stars were supposed to do, you may find, as I did, that this is still a very enjoyable film

The performances of all involved were overblown to the point of parody and the only relief was the dry ascerbic wit of Clifton Webb. The scenes of Tibet (?) were laughable with hokey backdrops and a fake Guhru. I suppose that for its time it had sincerity and believability, but even allowing for movie nostalgia, it is hard to swallow today. I got the impression that despite this being a tale of one man's quest for enlightenment the whole topic was so alien to both actors and production crew that they had no idea how to interpret it.  Our hero, wanders the world with some vague perception that there is something more to life than the world of American commerce, but appears to have no focus or destination. He does not write, nor does he paint.  He spends the night on a mountain and sees God in the light of dawn. It's that easy? Whoopee.

This version is also a little dated.  The setting is still the same, after World War I, but the movie-making is a little behind the times for me.  I prefer to see as much realism as possible.  For instance, our ""hero"" treks to India to study with one of the masters.  In this version, the guru is played by a ""tanned"" Englishman rather than a true Indian.  Given the time this was filmed, this is fairly standard.
Given that this is from the Maugham book, I really can't say that there are any memorable performances in this film.  Most lines I attribute to the book rather than the film.

 - As its primary theme the central problem of every individual life - to pursue one's own unique self-completion in life, or fall away and join the herd.
 - At least six characters written and performed more deeply than the lead character in almost all of the films found in AFI's puerile gen x list.

624583,5,6303333079,"This inspiring film bears repeated viewings. Five stars, 5 reasons:
1. It is UNIQUE.  No other A-list Hollywood film of the era, to my knowledge, (and few since) specifically portrayed a man's quest for spiritual truth as the central plot.  A handful, such as Capra's ""Lost Horizon"" and ""Wonderful Life,"" have heroes who stumble upon spiritual truth, but they don't spend the entire film rejecting conventional values solely in order to undergo a philosophical quest.  Later period films such as ""A Man Called Peter"" and ""A Nun's Story"" frame their spiritual quests within strictly Christian contexts; many others offer Christianity within war stories or adventure tales (""Joan of Arc"" -- ""Ben-Hur"" -- etc).  Since ""Razor's Edge"" conspicuously lacks these typical story values, it is astonishing that this film got made at all...just slightly less unlikely than if MGM had decided to turn ""Thus Spake Zarathustra"" into a movie.
2. It's a glossy, prestige production of a novel of artistic merit.  Reviewers here offer mixed opinions on how faithful to the book it is; I say it's a superb adaptation.  Larry, the central character, is off-stage for much of the book; the screenplay puts him front and center and dramatizes his quest.  That necessitates invention, but to my mind the film's additions were faithful to the book's spirit.  For fans of the Campbell-Vogler ""Hero of a Thousand Faces"" paradigm, it's intriguing to see how ""Razor"" fits that dramatic structure perfectly.
3. The portrayal of Larry's spiritual quest, his questions and the nature of the answers he finds, are indeed left a bit vague but that's a strength, not a weakness.  First, it meant Fox avoided provoking the Bible Belt of that day. More importantly, Speilberg and Kubrick kept the godlike aliens of ""Close Encounters"" and ""2001"" vague for the same reasons -- it's hard to portray the transcendent convincingly on screen.
4. Some viewers complain that since Larry achieves enlightenment halfway thru the film, there's no real drama once he comes down from the mountaintop and rejoins society.  Au contraire; although Larry is not tempted by Isabel's maneuvering, he does try to save a few souls (or at least heal a few wounded hearts) and he sees two good people die.  Antagonist Isabel commits murder, or its moral equivalent, to win Larry and fails.  Pretty dramatic stuff.
5. Although dated by contemporary sensibilities, the acting -- photography -- sets -- costumes -- and music are just plain terrific for fans of old school Hollywood at its finest.",1013904000,15,2535,5.0673076923076925
624584,4,6303333079,"Goulding's intrepretation of Maugham's novel is elegant and visually alluring. It doesn't hurt to have Tyrone Power as Larry and the stunning Gene Tierney as Isabelle. Anyone that loves dramatic cinema that is thought-provoking and leaves you feeling satiated will enjoy this movie. Although most movies don't compare with the novels they are based on, this one comes close.
This is a movie about a non-conformist; Larry doesn't want to live the life society expects of him, he wants to savor life on his own terms. Isn't that what your life should be about anyways? Somehow you sense that in the 21st century Larry would not be driving an SUV and a gas grill would not be sitting on his patio underneath the satellite disk. Perhaps it would be more accurate to state that Larry is his own man and that he is more concerned about what he thinks of himself versus what others think of him. Clifton Webb is perfect as Elliott Templeton, the quitessential snob who is catty and generous in equal turns. John Payne is a self-effacing Gray and Anne Baxter shines as Sophie. At the movies conclusion, the only person you can envy is Larry, because he is living life exactly the way he wants.",1004572800,47,1185,4.6746411483253585

The scenes in India are the worst, music swelling as Larry is supposed to be having an epiphany while a light bulb in the studio is turned on representing the sun rising.  A silly British guy plays his supposed Indian guru, a horrid Hollywood sterotype of a positive Indian stereotype with a ""(w)acccent.""  The screenplay and dialoge is horrid, the way actual dialogue is actually worked into the movie is almost blasphemous, and overall, the movie is long, melodramatic and serves to take the weaker moments of the book and exploit them to the fullest, while never bringing out any of the true messages of the book.

Gene Tierney stars as the girl who loves him, but  can't understand what he's all about.  Anne Baxter gives a great  performance as Tierney's friend, who through personal tragedy, turns to  alcohol and loses all purpose in her life.

I'd just finished the book, about which I can't say enough-- colorful, clever, moving, unsentimental, funny, mysterious-- and called up the video store to see if they had it, ran right over to get it,  and watched it immediately. A word to anyone who's read it: DON'T see the  film. I almost pulled a muscle from repeatedly rolling my eyes! There were  so many bizarre liberties taken with characters and story (including  missing the entire POINT of Larry's experience of ""God,"" i.e.  that it wasn't the Western concept of ""God,"" contrary to the  saccharine way it was presented in the film) that Maugham must have wept  when he saw what Hollwood wrought. I read in the foreward (of the Penguin  ed.) that he himself had written a screenplay, at Cukor's invitation,  asking for NO FEE-- the studio gave him an Impressionist painting as a  gratuity (ironically,  you'd never know from the film that art, esp.  painting, had so much to do with the story), and yet they abandoned his  screenplay as well as Cukor-- how tragic! I'd give a lot to see that  screenplay. I found the acting, esp. of Power and Tierney, to be mannered  and not at all appealing; as is so sadly typical of US films of the period,  the costumes and makeup were comically anachronistic, and that's quite a  feat when the story takes place only a couple of decades prior to the film  being made! Dear people who love this film: do yourselves a favor and read  the book! It has none of the syrupy sentimentality depicted in the film;  Larry is a strange and elusive character; Isabel is much more interesting  for not being gorgeous UNTIL her later years...

I give it a couple of stars for the possibility of its severely  diluted message sending the occasional viewer to the book.",959644800,13,1881,4.613293051359516

The best cinematography. And glamour. Lots  of. And it worked very well all together. It does not matter wether we talk  of The razor's edge or All about Eve, the results could not be in any other  way during that decade. And as for the tape, brightness and definition is  as high as possible. The master quality of this wonderful movie is  excellent. Sound is okay, as it is proven in the credits' music (I have  bought some other tapes from other sources with a very very poor sound  quality). So, a highly recommendable movie in a very good condition to  enjoy again and again.",956016000,2,756,4.631578947368421

7843377,5,6303333079,"I liked this book because Maugham actually went to meet a sage in India who I now know was Ramana Maharshi, one of the most respected and profound masters of non-dual awareness of the 20th century. He fictionalizes his meeting with the sage by sending Larry (the protagonist in the story) off to meet him and the sage sending him off to be alone with himself. This part of the movie  had the most impact on me when I saw this movie in my youth one late and lonely night and it had a similar impact this time knowing full well what Maugham was representing and understanding (?) what life lessons he was try to represent.",1523232000,,620,4.344827586206897

I read the book as well and while I really enjoyed that too, it gets into a lot of philosophy, which the movie certainly touches on, but can't get into as much depth as -and I kind of liked that. I just really enjoyed the story, the dialogue and the philosophy it did touch on. I know I'll sound old, but they really don't make movies as good as those from the 40s and 50s (and by the way, I wasn't around then).",1522540800,,435,3.9545454545454546

7843382,5,6303333079,"Six years ago, I found this film on TV, but the film had already started and progressed to about 10 minutes into the story. I noticed that there was a stellar cast, this was an interesting topic, and I had heard of the book. I ended up buying this DVD to watch the beginning of this film because I had missed the intro section while channel surfing. I sure am glad that I bought it!

This 1946 film starred Tyrone Power as Larry Darrell, Gene Tierney as Isabel Bradley, and Clifton Webb as Elliott Templeton and was shot in black and white.

The film had ridden the same wave of the wildly-successful 1944 book by the same name. With the Tyrone Power triad of actors in the lead, its storyline and the dialog interactions amongst these 3 characters (and stars!) were tightly crafted, stunning, and gut wrenching. This is one of the classic films about life, what it is, and what is important.

Another actress in a subplot, Anne Baxter as Sophie MacDonald, dutifully kept up with the main triad of stars. Baxters portrayal of Sophie, who had a successive series of downfalls in her life, was so poignantly played by Baxter that she won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Each of Sophies downslides tugged at my heart and Baxters acting skills almost made me feel that she was real.

After I had started watching the DVD, especially to see the beginning, I learned that Larry had had a combat jolt in WWI. He had survived an attack, while his friends hadnt. This was the main driver of the film: Why did Larry survive? What could he do after having experienced this? Seeing the beginning of the film better helped me understand the remainder of the film that I had watched on TV.

Tyrone Powers Larry had honesty and gravitas, a great foil to Gene Tierneys Isabel: flighty, gratingly snobbish, selfish, and materialistic. All of their scenes together were tightly-scripted to show their contrary behaviors beamed back and forth at each other in repartee. Larrys great seriousness and grit to learn about what life truly should be was played off of Isabels opposite behavior. It was mesmerizing to see them both on screen engaging in this type of dialog.

Clifton Webbs Uncle Elliot was pitched as a higher octave of Isabels  another artistic foil to Larrys persona.

In trying to learn about why he had been spared from death during WWI combat, Larry found himself back in Europe. He then travelled eastward, all the while contemplating how to reach and then later learn lifes secrets from Himalayan masters. After some time there, the masters agreed that he would be allowed to find out these secrets by ascending the mountains. When the journey became arduous, he found a shack near the summit to contemplate, read holy books, and think about the direction that his life should take. When the pre-dawn light started to slip over the horizon, he left the shack, reached the summit and was illuminated, as was the valley below him.

After having experienced this blinding illumination by spiritual light, this process changed the perspective of what Larrys life had to be for him. This means that he had to let some people, activities, and things go, so that he could best carry out the mission for which he had been searching: he learned that the path to enlightenment is as sharp as the razors edge.

I had experienced many strong emotions watching this film because there was a lot of tension in the dialog and in the character personalities, some of which were contrary to each other. After I had seen this film, I needed time to digest it and decompress.

Watching this film compelled me to then read the 1944 W. Somerset Maugham book of the same name. The book was even more gut-wrenching, with many more details to make this film clearer. (Please read my Amazon review of this book:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Razor-s-Edge/dp/1400034205/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Razor's Edge</a>

Timing is everything. If I could experience these 2 artistic forms again, I would still start by watching this 1946 film first and then working my way backward to reading the 1944 book by W. Somerset Maugham because the original book is almost always better than the film. If I had read the book first, I would have had interference with the film and might not have liked the film as well as I did. I truly loved both the film and the book.

Today, with our current HD video format and so many vivid and creative ways of filming scenes, I would like to see a re-make of this film, by producing it in multiple sections to create separate films in a series (like the Hobbit/ Lord of the Rings books and films), so that more of the books original details could be included.

I thoroughly recommend this film and give it a 5-star rating because of an outstanding script and acting, taut tension throughout many parts of the film, and many superlative scenes.

Terrific acting You could really could feel the male lead and his story. Jean Tierney played her part well. They all did. Personally I was much more interested in his quest than the tragic story of his childhood friend who fell hard after her deep loss;... but overall you felt like it was a page out of Somerset Maughman's life and that was what went on in that whole circle of friends he met.",1515369600,,514,4.4787234042553195
