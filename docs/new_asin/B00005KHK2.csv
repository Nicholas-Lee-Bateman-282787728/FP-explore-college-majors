1619877,4,B00005KHK2,"Don't judge a DVD on the cover! Air Rage's main character isn't Matthew Marshall (Ice-T) but the stewardess played by Kim Oja. Unlike most ""feminine Die Hards"", who are poor actresses spending most of the movie in the buff, Kim keeps her clothes on (except for a tame striptease at gunpoint) and shows us real acting talents, portraying a courageous, yet vulnerable, girl next door who finds herself fighting an elite force of rogue marines. Another good surprise are the characters' personnalities which are not caricatured (the only exception being the unbearable passenger). As for the script, despite many implausibilities, the suspense works well and some twists are really unpredictable. A good B-movie!",1002585600,7,709,5.283185840707965
7943230,5,B00005KHK2,"The five stars indicates that I enjoyed the story; not the technical data. I requested a list of adventure action movies that could have been any quality. Yesterday I enjoyed a 4:3 that was not 5.1 surround. This one was surprisingly 1.85:1 and also stereo. I never dozed because there was lots of tension. There was plenty of shooting, punching, kicking and stabbing. I was a little dismayed by the 'war' designation. I assure you that you can completely disregard the war designation. The end was so intence that I cried alot of tears. I'm getting quite good at picking movies because I know how to set the search parameters. I just paid another $99 for Amazon Prime and I think I am getting some very good service.",1517184000,,717,4.609375
7943231,1,B00005KHK2,"Ok as a Marine I find this movie insultingly bad, acting was terrible plot non existent. Just an all around lousy flick. Dont waste your time",1511481600,,141,4.461538461538462
7943232,5,B00005KHK2,I like this film. I saw it on tv once. Think of small budget executive decision. It works. Ice-t is just right in the film. This film has a slight sense of humor which helps carry it. The surprise here is the stewardess. She comes across as strong and funny at the same time. I think it is worth watching several times.,1504051200,,319,4.161290322580645

7943234,1,B00005KHK2,"I saw this movie on some random DTV station. Its was labor day so I though why not. After a while it seems like it was not such a great idea. First off all the hijackers were carrying what I think they were automatic weapons (sometimes they were rapid fire sometimes they were not) which should cause you to stop right there being that if one, only one bullet would penetrate or even dent a part of the plane, the air pressure would cause the hole to expand and the speed of the plane would have caused everyone to fly out of the plane as the hole continued to expand. However in the movie nearly 50 random shot were fired and amazingly none of them penetrated the plane's cabin or even the furniture that was shot at. There is also the fact that one of the hijackers of the plane opened a bathroom stall with a hunting knife. First that should not be possible and second how was he allowed did he get a hunting knife on the plane in the first place along with all of the guns and radio equipment.

There is also the crazy part about the black-ops team using an SR71-blackbird to board a moving commercial plane at a altitude of above 10,000 feet by attaching to the SR71 perfectly above some magical hidden hatch leading to a random cargo hold separate from the plane's luggage department. I nearly lost it that after they were attach to the moving plane with some extended tunnel thing on the SR71 no bigger that 100sq ft that was able to line up perfectly with the magical hatch on the plane, the leader of the black-ops pressed some buttons on some random panel and said that two planes pressures were matched before they even opened the hatch of the moving plane. Minor detail but still off the wall.

The rest of the movie is just this one girl going die hard and stuff, killing all the accomplices of the leading hijacker and finally killing him in the worst scene of the movie where in the last scuffle the big escape attach you see on every plane gets opened and the hijacker slips and falls out of the plane but is still holding on to a random bar on the plane. I know that he was supposed to be an ex-marine but the plane is moving at nearly 900mph. The girl throws something at him and he lets go and flys away then she trips on something nearly falls out of the plane but magically regains her balance (remember the speed of the plane) , goes back in the plane's cockpit and without closing the hatch lands the plane in Atlanta, Georgia.

There is also the question, the SR71 was able to catch up to the plane in about 10 minutes As in the black-ops team talking, boarding and taking off. The F-15's took about 35 minutes even though there are F-15's in numerous Air Force bases across America. Very strange.

The whole movie was just quite hilarious to me, don't spend more than 2 dollars to watch it.",1378080000,,2815,4.325757575757576
7943235,1,B00005KHK2,"I caught the last half of this movie on TV, and it was appallingly bad. Just about every plot contrivance is stolen from other movies. The production values... wait their are NO production values. I paid $3 for it on Amazon(probably the movies entire production budget;-), just to endure the first half of the movie I missed... it was just a bad! This is the kind of movie the MST 3000 gang should get a hold of. For $3 dollars I have one of the best ""zonk"" gifts for a Christmas gift exchange. It was released about 6 weeks before 9/11...and given it's a hijacking plot, you can imagine it was quickly pulled from the market. As someone once said, this one wasn't released, it escaped!",1332979200,,686,4.4523809523809526
7943236,2,B00005KHK2,"This is pretty much a copycat of PASSENGER 57, which is a better movie...

If it wasn't for ICE-T I wouldn't have cared to follow the movie through... Besides him the movie is pretty much a waste of time and money...

Ice-t Does NOT have the lead in the movie which I thought, his character doesn't get in the movie until like 40 minutes has past, Kim Noja (or whatever she's called) has the leadand she isn't to great (u might know her as the flat one in SON OF THE BEACH)...

I'd recommend you watch STEALTH FIGHTER if u want to see a movie feautring planes and ice-T instead... Not the best movie neither but it sure is funny...",1119657600,,631,4.241666666666666
7943237,1,B00005KHK2,"The highlight of the movie:  Kim Oja is cute and she is a serviceable actress.  It's all downhill from there.

Some have noted that this movie uses tons of stock footage.  Not surprising since if they had a budget of more than $10,000 it doesn't show up on the screen.  The FAA will let movies shoot some background and limited principal shots in its air traffic facilities, but the producers here don't even bother.  They just badly dress up a room with stuff that has no relation to reality.  The action is supposed to take place on a 747, but they couldn't even spend the money to shoot the cockpit scenes in a real 747 or rent one of the mockups that have appeared in numerous other movies.  The cockpit is an obvious thrown together cheap set done by someone who has absolutely no idea of what they're depicting.  Poorly directed, indifferently acted (except by Ms Oja) and completely unresearched.

In order to not either laugh or throw something at the screen when you watch this, you have to have no knowledge of aviation, air traffic control, the military, piloting requirements, what anything in a cockpit is, the military, guns, how humans breathe  (you can breathe without aid at 10,000 feet, there's no reasons to rapidly descend from there),  security, etc.  Come to think of it that describes the writers.  For example, in the big climax, you're expected to believe that every air traffic controller knows exactly how to fly a 747 and can teach virtually anybody how to land it and that your average flight attendant knows where all the controls are and just how to work them.  In this big sequence, the writer and didrector don't even bother to learn what controls do what to attempt to  inject even a modicum of realism in an unbelievable sequence Controller:  ""Now pull that throttle back as hard as you can"".  Whereupon the flight attendant pulls back only one lever (there are four on a 747, one for each engine) which isn't a throttle lever anyway.  There is not even the slightest attempt in this movie to get anything right.  So, this movie does exactly what the plane would do in real life:  Crash and burn.

Yes, Passenger 57 and Executive Decision (from which this movie copies)  weren't very realistic either, but at least they tried, and if you could get by the silliness were exciting.  This movie doesn't even bother, and neither should you.",1105228800,4,2371,4.671497584541063
7943238,5,B00005KHK2,"Unknown actors and actresses (to me) ...but I thoroughly enjoyed the film. Some scenes were a little ""far fetched"" but that's what entertainment is all about ...huh??",1087344000,,166,5.185185185185185
