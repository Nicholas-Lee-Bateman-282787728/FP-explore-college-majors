After spending six ""wonderful days at the Plaza"" as miss Fonda so well put it they go home to start the marrige. They move into a one room apt. on the east side of new york and it's a walk up six flights. in the film we meet some very funny charecters like Victor Volasco and Corrie's mom who happend to still the hole film.

258870,5,6300216241,"Neil Simon's hit Broadway play ""Barefoot In The Park"" was brought to the big screen by Paramount Pictures in May 1967, and it's a romantic comedy that is rich in '60s New York flavor, first-rate performances by a fine cast, a funny script, and an uncredited ""extra cast member"" which delivers quite a few laughs in its own right -- i.e., a difficult-to-conquer New York City five-flight walk-up apartment.

Robert Redford, Jane Fonda, Mildred Natwick, and Charles Boyer are the stars that ease their way gracefully and ""breathlessly"" through ""Barefoot In The Park"". (Several members of the cast are literally ""breathless"" in many scenes because of that doggone five-story march up the stairs to reach the newlywed couple's just-rented 'flat'.)

Redford and Fonda (ages 30 and 29, respectively) are the amorous newlyweds who struggle to make themselves happy in that top-floor crackerbox, which comes (in)complete with no heat, no bathtub, a hole in the glass skylight that affords Mr. Redford (""Paul Bratter"") the opportunity of shoveling snow out of his living room when such wintry weather warrants, and a bedroom so small that the couple has to ""turn in unison"" in order to fit into the room at the same time. :)

But it's all good fun and handled with realistic humor and style by this excellent cast. Robert Redford is very funny in this film, proving without much doubt that he can certainly hold his own in a comedy. He lets loose with many hilarious quips throughout this flick, and does so without the lines seeming to come from a ""script"".

Some ""Redford Funnies"" that I enjoyed from ""Barefoot"":

""{She's gonna get} a dog! That's a laugh! Wait till she tries to take him out for a walk....he'll take one look at those stairs and go right for her throat!""

""The radiator's the coldest thing in the room!""

""There's a brisk northeasterly wind blowing in this room .... I'm not getting sarcastic; I'm getting chapped lips!""

~~An LOL break is needed at this point~~ :-)

After realizing there's no way to plug up the hole in the skylight that's causing the ""brisk northeasterly wind"", Paul Bratter (Redford) unleashes another good one.....""That's twenty feet high; we'd have to fly over in a plane and drop something in.""

Later in the film, after the newlyweds have a major spat and Corie (Jane) insists that her brand-new hubby find other lodgings, this exchange of dialogue comes up:

CORIE -- ""You could stay at your club.""

PAUL -- ""It's not that kind of club; it's a locker room and a handball court. To sleep over, I'd have to keep winning the serve.""

-------------------

Mildred Natwick, as Jane Fonda's mother, is in tip-top acting form, too. And she's given quite a meaty part here as well, as she reluctantly becomes somewhat (shall we say) ""involved"" with the ""neighbor upstairs"" (he lives in the attic above Jane and Bob's place). The neighbor is played by 67-year-old Charles Boyer, and he's just as good as the remainder of this roster of finely-tuned players.

Screenplay writer Neil Simon gives Mildred her fair share of witticisms throughout this script too, such as the quote I've used for the title of this review (which was spoken after yet another Mount Everest-like climb to get to Paul and Corie's dwelling).

The scene featuring the ill-at-ease telephone repairman is also a highlight.

While I enjoyed the feel-good, ""all's-well"" rooftop ending of the film, I felt a tad bit disappointed by it at the same time. Instead of the movie's last shot showing the couple on the roof from a lengthy distance, I would have liked to have seen one short scene added to the finish that would have capped the proceedings off nicely (IMO) -- that being:

A shot showing a smiling Paul and Corie happily squeezing into their tiny bedroom, followed by the door slamming right in the camera's face (eye). Then the end credits could be placed over the top of the closed bedroom door (with, perhaps, a few giggling noises being heard from behind the door once in a while as the names scroll across the screen).*

* = The giggling is strictly optional. ~wink~

-------------------

This 1999 Paramount DVD version of ""Barefoot"" delivers a crisp, clear picture (in Anamorphic Widescreen 1.85:1). Colors look terrific and natural. And the film sounds very good too, via the disc's Dolby Digital 2.0 English Mono audio. A French 2.0 Mono track is also included; as well as English subtitles.

The lone extra feature on the disc is a Theatrical Trailer (length: 3:11). The trailer is shown in Widescreen format, but it hasn't been ""enhanced for 16x9"".

The DVD's Menus are anamorphic, non-animated, and silent. A one-sheet paper insert is included, which offers a chapter list (there are 18 chapter breaks).

-------------------

So, take this ""Barefoot"" disc for a walk in the DVD-playing device of your choice. It's a walk that won't make your feet ache at all. (It might make you slightly out of breath once in a while while watching it....but the laughs from Mr. Redford and company more than make up for any lack of oxygen.)",1006992000,,5040,4.852975495915986

  Jane Fonda is adorable in this Broadway hit play by  Neil Simon converted to the big screen. Fonda and  Robert Redford are Corie and Paul Bratter,  newlyweds adjusting to their newfound married life.  Corie is carefree and vibrant, whereas her husband,  Paul, is prim and proper. Together, they make a  dazzling team that answers the question: Do  opposites attract? The script rarely leaves their  hilariously small apartment, located on the fifth floor  of a building with no elevator. This adds for some  laughable moments in the movie as visitors have to  walk up five flights of stairs to reach them. Mildred  Natwick plays Corrie's concerned mother, and she  livens up the script with her dry wit and humorous  lines. This is a wonderful romantic comedy that will  lift your spirits. I just wish the movie was a bit  longer. . . I would have loved to see what became  of this lovable couple",974505600,29,937,4.74375
258872,4,6300216241,"An old friend (and fan of goofy romance) recommended this film to me.  It took 6 months and I finally got around to seeing the DVD. The DVD has the original trailer and looks great.  The sound is solid, but you aren't buying this DVD for the effects.  You are buying this for the film.
Pauline Kael called this film, ""a trifle and almost amusing in a harmlessly, pleasantly stupid way"" (5001 Nights at the Movies).  She missed the whole point of the film.  You don't take a movie like this seriously.  You let the charm of Jane Fonda, Robert Redford, and the bouyant Charles Boyer take you away.  You just laugh and enjoy.  The story of two young newlyweds is age old.  You can see where Dharma and Greg get their inspiration, and the 90 minutes of this film are far better than any episode of that show.  I immediately fell in love with Fonda's Corrie.
Charles Boyer steals the movie.  At times it is a bit dated (like Corrie's mom's advice about making a happy marriage), but that is no matter.  If you want to smile and fall in love, see this film.
It looks great on DVD. Do yourself a favor, ignore the junk playing at a theatre near you and enjoy this one at home as winter comes.",972259200,8,1185,4.288288288288288

Paul and Corrie Bratter are two newly weds who move into a fifth floor  apartment of a building with no lifts. She is extrovert, bubbly and a  little naive always wanting to try new experiences while he is a staid  advertising executive on a fast track to being very boring. Inevitably  there is a clash of personalities. Somehow in these more liberal times such  an outcome could easily have been avoided,nevertheless... There is an  interesting bohemian character next door who serves as a catalyst for  finally bringing out there differences to the fore. A Mr Victor Velasco  played with great relish by Charles Boyer. When he invites them all to  dinner including Corries mother and serves a hot dish of lychees, the story  takes a different turn. It also aroused my curiosity enough to go out and  try this tasty asian delicacy myself. But I digress. The 'barefoot in the  park' literal ending is both touching and romantic. Enough said. This is  not a great comedy as comedies go but extremely watchable for those have us  who have a nostalgia for the 60's when cohabitation outside wedlock was  still a novelty. Both Boyer and Natwick manage to upstage everyone with  there spot-on characterisations. No over acting here.  I sometimes wonder  if Fonda and Redford had not gone on to bigger things that maybe they would  have ended up on some similar tv sitcom of this genre.

I must own that in his work I would like to see Simon get laughs by introducing a few more comic situations and perhaps be a little less  reliant on his patent New York one-liners--the kind that go along with a TV  ""laugh track""--although few are better at it. For all that, ""Barefoot In  the Park"" is nonetheless undeniably enjoyable (if a bit slow-starting),  funny, and peopled with amusing characters.

259028,2,6300216241,"Review of Barefoot in the Park
Hot Toasty Rag, September 25, 2017

Everyone knows Robert Redfords acting style is perfect for the camera, rather than the theater. Hes subtle; the slight raise of his eyebrow means volumes. That being said, would you be surprised to find out he originated the lead role in Barefoot in the Park on Broadway? I was.

In Neil Simons romantic comedy, newlyweds Robert Redford and Jane Fonda ride out some early speedbumps in their marriage. Bob is an uptight lawyer, and Jane is a free spirit. Their arguments are legendary, and chances are youve seen a clip in a romantic film montage. Robert Redfords I have a case in court in the morning line has become a household phrase in my family.

While this is a pretty famous romantic classic, I actually really didn't like it the first time I saw it. Jane Fonda is absolutely adorable beyond belief; this is definitely one her cutest roles. But Robert Redford was too convincing in his role, and I couldn't stand him! I realize now that my hatred of him was a compliment to his acting, but at the time, I couldn't separate how much I hated his character from his acting ability. It wasn't until I watched The Great Gatsby that I fell in love with him.",1506297600,,1225,4.53393665158371

The story is of a newly married couple Paul and Corie Bratter (Robert Redford, Jane Fonda) living on the top floor of an apartment house. They are trying to cope with each other's quirks and relatives. Toss in the strange Victor Velasco (Charles Boyer) a gregarious border in the attic.

Yep, I enjoyed this movie when it first came out. I could relate to the newly weds as many people start out in similar environments. This movie version of the play has spoiled me to the point that other attempts at ""Barefoot in the Park"" fall short of my expectations.

A part that I thought was funny but had no relationship to, was the ""little pink pills"" that Corie's mother (Mildred Natwick) had to take to handle the rich food and drink environment. Now I take little pink pills.

259479,2,6300216241,"Had never seen it, and expected to enjoy it, but was disappointed, despite the assets of a young Jane Fonda and a young Robert Redford as newly weds.  The movie essentially lost me by trying to get humor out of the difficulty of climbing the stairs to a fifth floor walk-up apartment.  Over and over again.  Delivery men, visitors, etc.  I mean, even the 26 year old Redford was supposedly exhausted by the effort.  The opposites dynamic of the free-spirit Fonda character and stuffed shirt Redford character also was weakly written and performed.  Perhaps a better comic actress than Fonda could have pulled this off, and added the kick that was needed.  Of course Redford is not especially a skilled comic either, but he did star in the popular Broadway version of this.  In any event, it all seemed dated, and the Neil Simon humor somewhat thin.  In the end, I watched the movie for the portrayal of marriage, gender roles, and NYC circa 1967, and for Charles Boyer's madcap, eccentric performance.  Yes, an Albanian character with an outrageous French accent.  A more silly comic like Mel Brooks would have mined that for humor.",1445904000,,1132,4.783505154639175

She accuses him of being a stuffed shirt because he won't walk barefoot in the park with her or other silly things. To complicate matters, their upstairs neighbor is just as whacky as she is; they introduce him to her mother who has her own set of neurotic habits and those two take off on a date and she doesn't come home all night. She is found upstairs sleeping comfortably without her board in the mattress and without having to take her nerve pills. After Jane throws him out, Robert goes on a drinking binge, gives his coat to a vagrant, takes off his shoes and by the time Jane has found him has caught a bad cold. Now, their roles start changing. She starts becoming more practical taking care of him and in his drunken stupor tries some of the crazy things she's been suggesting like walking barefoot in Central Park and climbing up on their roof where she's sure he's going to fall off if she doesn't rescue him. In the end, they both learn to compromise and take on a little bit of the other's ways to become a truly blended couple.",1436227200,3,1218,4.393805309734513

259799,3,6300216241,"Barefoot in the Park (1967) is a romcom starring Robert Redford and Jane Fonda as newlyweds in Greenwich Village, Manhattan.  The former is conservative while the latter is free-spirited and their differences come to the fore after a few days of marital bliss. Mildred Natwick plays the mother of Fondas character and Charles Boyer plays an eccentric neighbor, Victor Velasco, who lives in the attic of their apartment building.

This movie is good as a mid-60s period piece where you get to view a 20-something couple who are just a bit too old for the counter-culture, albeit somewhat hip."" Its an amiable and innocent sitcom with a few amusing moments, but it was a chore for me to get through. The story and characters just never engaged me. The film only perked up when the eccentric neighbor was around, Velasco. Another problem is too much of the movie takes place in the apartment -- like 90% -- which means the setting is one-dimensional. Of course, this wouldnt be a problem if the story and characters were interesting. Also, Natwick, as the mother, is too old for the part because the characters supposed to be like 53 years-old while Natwick was 61 during filming and looked like 63-65.

While Barefoot is a must for serious fans of Redford and Fonda, 1979s The Electric Horseman is the far superior choice if you want to see the two starring together.

The film runs 106 minutes and was shot in Greenwich Village, Manhattan.

I could hardly believe this was a Neil Simon screenplay, after watching just the Out of Towners, a total screamer, I found BITP absolutely charming! Although Redford's character is supposedly a stuffed shirt, he was so comical and spontaneous I could not fathom when he lost this ability in later productions.

Fonda's portrayal of a light hearted lover was a perfect foil to her family, neighbors, and friends. It was an interesting aspect that she always lit up when referencing their five day love nest Honeymoon at the Plaza. I think I could crank it up to 14 if I had the scratch.

The only annoying part was the constant singing of that Sharma song, how is that funny or moving the plot along after a few bars? I had to turn the sound off it was that offensive.

260191,5,6300216241,"This film is a cleverly written, wonderfully acted comedy that stands among the funniest I've ever seen. Ever. Though it mostly sticks to convention, partially as a product of its time, Neil Simon's screenplay is a perfect example of how to do comedy well, based on characters and dialogue and not the toilet humor that too often passes for ""comedy"" nowadays. Robert Redford (reprising his stage role) and Jane Fonda are brilliant as the two lead characters, a newlywed couple who are adjusting to their new life together. The chemistry between them was palpable and very real. Charles Boyer and Mildred Natwick also give fine supporting performances as an interesting neighbor and the bride's mother, respectively. One thing I loved, besides how funny this film was, was the way in which it treated even the smallest of characters. Sure, there could have been more exploration of the many residents in the apartment, but what was in the movie worked well. And, I also liked the economic (and organic) use of physical comedy to complement the nearly nonstop verbal acrobatics. Truly a masterpiece of comedy for the ages, and a heartwarming look at young love.",1404777600,,1159,4.979381443298969

The supporting characters are limited and do their job as comedic support to the newlyweds.  The dialogue is fast and furious--an emotional roller coaster propelling the action at a frenzied pace.  The story line is resolved in an amazingly short time.  This does not hold up in comparison to other more contemporary romantic comedies or quirky independent pieces--it does feel dated (cinematography, lighting, extremely limited use of space, etc.), but that doesn't make it less enjoyable.

The supporting cast is superb and lends to the hilarity of these two newlyweds getting off to a rocky start with challenges such as opposing views on what an apartment should have...such as decent heat, a bedroom big enough for two, and an eccentric neighbor who uses their apartment window as the way to access his loft apartment above.  Redford and Fonda are a terrific twosome who are so believable in their roles as a couple coming to terms with hilariously different points of views on what constitutes a great new relationship!

260374,3,6300216241,"We had never seen the movie when it came out and through the years never considered seeing it, maybe because Jane Fonda is not among our favorites.  The story was a bit cutesy with a 60s-70s ditsy touch but amusing at times.",1387324800,,224,4.333333333333333
260375,5,6300216241,"This is the story about a newlywed couple who can't keep their hands off each other - literally. Eventually the husband has to get back down to earth and go back to work. His wife now begins to miss him and wants to keep him home with her. From here the story gets bogged down when their parents come to visit but in a funny. It is really hillarious. So if you want your funny bone tickled, I recommend this movie. If you don't laugh or cry during this movie, you don't have any feelings.",1387238400,,488,4.147368421052631

260389,4,6300216241,"In terms of plot, BAREFOOT IN THE PARK is quite hackneyed, involving the trials and tribulations of newly-wedded couple Peter and Corey Bratter (Jane Fonda, Robert Redford).  The sentiments are very Sixties, with the wife expected to stay at home and look after her husband, and sacrifice some of her self-esteem to ensure his collective well-being. However as with most Neil Simon plays that were turned into film, Gene Saks' production has been rescued by a series of snappy one-liners and two strong central performance. Fonda is particularly good as the apparently self-centered yet vulnerable young wife, complimented by Redford's more edgy spouse.  The studio sets jar a little - especially the use of back-projections of late 60s New York, but there is a good climactic scene where Bratter actually walks barefoot in the park, set in Washington Square.  Worth a watch, especially if viewers fancy something comically diverting.",1383609600,,934,5.25503355704698

260391,5,6300216241,It's a delight to visit this old classic.  Simon's timeless style of comedy is sometimes strained in some examples looking back from 2013 - but contains more than enough clever gags and motifs to enjoy.  Tremendously entertaining performances by the stars and supporting cast and enough quotable dialog that it's surprising to hear it so seldom these days.  Wonderful!,1382227200,,368,5.203389830508475

Jane Fonda plays the over zalest bride and Robert Redford her annoyed understanding husband. I like it when he tell her I love you even thought I didn't like you sometimes. She was way over the top sometimes. A brillant beautiful movie. I love when he gets drunk and she goes searching for him and finds him barefoot in the park. He did everything she wanted him to do but he was drunk. Just to show her how her idead were stupid. She was a twit. But in the end love prevail. Awesome movie.,1376956800,,583,4.214285714285714
260408,3,6300216241,"Ok, I've seen this movie about 25 times--mostly for the NYC scenes and feel, and for the period of time it's supposed to represent.  And, of course, Neil Simon was and always will be a genius.  My main problem with this movie is, and this happens a lot for me, I wish they'd use more unknown actors.  When they use ""famous"" actors for parts, those actors usually bring along their own baggage (persona, history, fame) which gets in the way of the characters they are supposed to be playing.  I want to see this when the actors are little-known or completely unknown so the characters as written can be the celebs.",1376611200,,613,4.495495495495495

Redford is rather conservative and Fonda more of a free spirit--until the tables turn.  The dialogue is hilarious.

Rented it a few times and have always thought it was a great little romantic comedy, and fairly accurately portrayed the funny differences between guys & gals.  Of course, Neil Simon was no slouch as a play writer, and this is a good screen adaptation.  I've also enjoyed Redford & Fonda's work together.

According to the book, Jane Fonda was having a tough time in her personal life while this was being filmed, and got a lot of support from Redford. Redford does a great job in his role, because he's playing a smart articulate guy (which is the only kind of guy he can play convincingly); his character is also kind of uptight and conservative (at least on the surface), and surprisingly, he pulls that off too. But the real revelation is how fearlessly Fonda throws herself into the zany, silly character she plays, and makes us believe in her and root for her. You would never know she was going through a harrowing time in her personal life. They're finely matched and the movie has many lines that are still LOL funny, with superb work from the supporting duo.",1355356800,,832,4.553333333333334

260636,5,6300216241,"""Barefoot in the Park"" is one of the best and most successful examples of the filmed Broadway romantic comedy.  It features Robert Redford on the cusp of stardom as he repeats his Broadway role as Paul Bratter, and Jane Fonda as Corie Bratter fully realizing her potential as a fine light comedienne.  For the whole premise of these totally opposite newlyweds beginning life together to click there has to be a vibrant magnetism between Paul and Corie.  This Fonda and Redford have in spades, they could rival great film teams,  Tracy and Hepburn, Wayne and O'Hara and Loy and Powell they way they generate sparks.

The plot is slight; Paul and Corie Bratter, after a rapturous six-day honeymoon at the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan begin married life in a tiny flat on the fifth floor of an old Greenwich Village brownstone.  Corie is an exuberant free spirit, eager to experience all life has to offer; Paul on the other hand is more reserved, practical and cautious as a young lawyer just beginning his career.  While Corie views their cramped, antiquated apartment as a little piece of heaven, Paul sees the flaws; the five long flights plus the front stoop, the hole in the skylight, no bathtub, the leaky closet in their bedroom that is so small and narrow it can only fit an oversized single bed, not to mention their offbeat neighbors.  One of the most notorious is Victor Velasco (Charles Boyer) an older, chipper rou who lives above them in the attic.  Corie and he turn out to be kindred spirits, and she gets the wild notion to set up her gentle, sedate widowed mother Mrs. Banks (Mildred Natwick) on a blind date with him.  At the end of a very bizarre evening, which includes a ride on the Staten Island Ferry to an Albanian restaurant, both Paul and Mrs. Banks, numb and weary are more than ready to call it an night.  However, Victor insists on seeing Mrs. Banks, to her dismay, home to New Jersey.  After they leave, Paul overtired and disgusted by the whole interminable business takes Corie to task for what he feels is a cavalier attitude towards her mother's discomfort.  Corie annoyed, responds to this by accusing Paul of being a watcher not a doer in the game of life.  This leads to a beaut of a rip-roaring fight that climaxes when an agitated Corie tells Paul she wants a divorce since she suddenly realizes, that except for those six days at the Plaza, they have absolutely nothing in common!

Neil Simon based the play on his own newlywed life with his first wife Joan in a five-floor Greenwich Village walk up, and it works because it is so true to life, and the adjustments people have to make in a marriage.  It was his first smash hit and ran for 1530 performances on Broadway.  He skillfully adapted and opened up the play in the screenplay showing the Bratters in a horse drawn hansom cab blissfully riding to the Plaza just after their marriage, their honeymoon, the disastrous dinner out, and Paul, happily drunk, walking barefoot in Washington Square Park to prove to Corie he's not a stuffed shirt.  The one-liners and zingers abound, but the humor is affectionate not malicious, toward one and all, and always faithful to the character and the situation.

In the first seven years of the 1960's Jane Fonda was one of the first choices to play the ingnue in cinema adaptations of Broadway plays, and she won this role over such potential candidates as Elizabeth Ashley the original Broadway Corie, Marlo Thomas who played it in London, and Natalie Wood.  This was her 5th time doing a Broadway transfer, and by far her best; she's a charmer, delectably pretty with her mane of russet hair, and her slender, coltish figure that looks sensational by the way when she strips down to bra and slim trousers to tempt her absorbed husband by performing an ""original Cambodian fertility dance"", ditto when she does an alluring little wriggle as she slips into a dress!  You had to love her, despite her little quirks, particularly if you were a hormone ridden adolescent boy the way my friends and I all were the first time we saw it.  She also has a sure touch with the witty Simon dialogue making every word count, she's smashing, to use a Swingin' Sixties term!

This was Redford's sixth film and it was lucky for him, the first true hit after a string of flops, and the one that would ignite his career in films.  His role is less showy than Fonda's, but he more than holds his own with her.  I very much identified with his character, the slightly stuffy, restrained introvert.  Still, Paul has a quiet strength, and he has plenty of red corpuscles that get the juices flowing for his seductive young bride.  As mentioned earlier, there is palpable electricity in these two opposites attracting.  Redford gets his chance to show his talent for slapstick comedy in the last part of the film when he tries to shuck off his inhibitions along with his socks and shoes with the assistance of a bottle of Scotch!

Mildred Natwick was another of the original Broadway cast, and she has a lovely gracious dignity as Corie's mother.  She's endearing and maintains her aplomb throughout all the crazy misadventures to which Corie and Velasco subject Paul and she.  Like Fonda and Redford, she gets a chance to comedically twinkle, and does it so well that she was rewarded justly with an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress of 1967.

As Victor Velasco, Charles Boyer had the opportunity to affectionately spoof his continental lover image, which he does with relish.  I can't forget the final original cast member Herb Edelman as Harry Pepper, the hapless telephone repairman, who proves the old bromide true, ""there are no small parts, only small actors.""

Quick words of praise to director Gene Saks, in this his initial outing; he had an affinity for the works of Neil Simon in both stage and screen.  Also, Neal Hefti's bright musical score, with its jazz influences, is a definite asset.

Bad news, no extras except for the original trailer, a commentary with both Fonda and Redford would have been an additional bonus.  Still, the movie is strong enough to stand on it's own, and in it's charming innocence and sweetness will always appeal to the young at heart.",1283040000,3,6198,4.695009242144177

260688,5,6300216241,"I just love this movie. I first read and saw the play when two people in my high school drama club performed a scene from it. Very soon after that, they showed this movie on AMC (or a similar movie channel) and I fell in love. It was made before I was born (my parents, for that matter, were little kids when this was made) and so at times it can seem kind of hokey to me, but it's sweet and very funny. Robert Redford plays uptight Paul while Jane Fonda is very funny as the upbeat optimistic Corie. Plus, I just love her wardrobe. Can't say it'd really work in my life, but I wouldn't mind a couple of those dresses.

Dharma & Greg has a similar premise (though obviously BITP is done much, much better than D&G!) -- a couple gets married after only knowing each other for a short while, she's a little flighty, he's a little uptight, hilarity and drama ensues as they deal with married life and living together in the big city. I love this movie. If you like Neil Simon, older movies, romantic comedies, or just want to see what all the fuss was about for the leading actors (Redford was a dreamboat and Jane Fonda is so pretty), I'd say give this a try.",1234742400,,1157,4.211711711711712
260689,4,6300216241,"`Barefoot in the Park' is not a perfect rom/com, but it is a delightful one, that is for sure.  There is so much to love here that it's small and sparse downfalls are easily overlooked, sometimes missed altogether.  Thanks in large part to some very surprisingly engaging performances and a spot on script, `Barefoot in the Park' may make you want to do just that; run barefoot in the park.

The film tells the story of newlyweds Paul and Corie Bratter.  Paul is an aspiring lawyer who is reserved and conservative.  Corie is loud and vivacious and flirtatious and just completely his opposite.  The two move into an apartment that they never got to see to find that it is practically falling apart, but being to optimist that she is, Corie makes the best of things, determined to have a happy home.  Paul is a little more put off by his newfound surroundings, but he desires to keep his wife happy.  Their building is populated by some strange individuals, not the least of which is Victor Velasco who just so happens to live in the attic.  While Corie is busy making friends and spreading her wings, Paul finds himself recoiling.

Will these differences end their marriage before it even begins?

Parts of the overall scheme of things may not seem to fit all that soundly, especially when you consider the fact that Paul's conservative side seems a new thing for Corie, who most definitely would have known this man before marrying him, but it is easily forgiven or all around forgotten thanks to the wonderful acting.

That acting is also quite surprising.  To be honest I find both Robert Redford and Jane Fonda to be rather dull, especially when considering all the praise they receive from rabid fans.  Redford is like Gere for me; a heartthrob who has no right to be a heartthrob, but here he is wonderful.  He is the right amount of conservative and the right amount of charming.  He comes off like the average Joe, which is exactly what the film called for.  Jane Fonda is even better, much better.  She is so infectiously charming, oozing all over each scene with pure blissful chemistry.  Charles Boyer is hilarious as Victor and Mildred Natwick works well as Corie's mother, but I will say that her Oscar nomination was a little unnecessary.

The film, like I said, is not perfect, but it is charming and enjoyable.  It does feel very much like a stage play in scenes, and this comes off a little wooden, but it is short lived thanks to Fonda and Redford.  The final resolution will make you happy and giddy and the way the actors devour the script is a joy to witness.

The film even has one of those hysterical `ROUS' moments (watch `The Princess Bride' if you don't know what I'm referring to) when Corie's mother first visits the apartment.  If you watch carefully you'll see that the door opens and Natwick is just standing there, still as can be and then she just runs full force into the door jam.  It's one of those comical moments that is funny for a purely unintended reason, and one of those scenes that you just want to rewind and watch over and over again.",1227139200,,3081,4.5683060109289615

Now both of the lead actors are in their prime in this movie and they are both very good looking.  Robert Redford bears an almost uncanny resemblance to Bill Clinton, although, even better looking.

He really seems to capture the challenges of a young couple adjusting to marriage once past the heavenly 6-day honeymoon at the Plaza, especially since the bride and groom seem at times to come from different solar systems.  The groom, Paul, (Robert Redford) is down-to-earth, solid, sensible, a handsome rising young attorney who is hesitant to try anything new or do anything wild and crazy, a bit of a 'stuffed shirt'.  The bride, Corie (Jane Fonda), is a beautiful, sexy, free-spirited young woman eager to begin their life together in their tiny new walk-up apartment on the top floor of a 5-story building (not counting the stoop).  It's easy to see what attracted them to each other but is there enough substance to hold them together?

To add more flavor to the mix, they blend in Corie's 52-year old straight-laced mother, Ethel (Mildred Natwick) and their 60-ish Bohemian neighbor, Victor (Charles Boyer), who dwells in the attic and lives a very uninhibited lifestyle.

The casting is excellent, the script is great.  I love what Redford and Fonda bring to these roles.  I thought Boyer and Natwick were wonderful, too.

260833,4,6300216241,"Romantic comedies don't come much lighter than this early Neil Simon confection based on the early days of his first marriage. With Broadway in such a desperate state to open a revival of the original play this past week (and to rather abominable reviews), it's worth revisiting the 1967 screen adaptation starring the youthful, fresh-faced pair of Robert Redford and Jane Fonda. They convincingly play Paul and Corie Bratter, hot-to-trot newlyweds who after spending seven passion-filled nights at the Plaza, find the everyday trials and tribulations of marriage rather rough going. Corie has secured them a sixth-floor walk-up studio in Greenwich Village surrounded by eccentric neighbors, chief among them an aging lothario, Victor Velasco. Her widowed mother comes for dinner, which Corie transforms into a blind date with the wily Velasco. In the meantime, the personality clash between the button-down Paul and the free-spirited Corie comes to a head with Paul walking out drunk and sick with a head cold. The ending for all four characters is inevitable, but the journey there generates some nice giggles. It's all pretty generic and filmed rather flatly by Gene Saks as a movie barely opened up for the movie screen.

The young leads show why they are still around nearly forty years later. This was the second of three screen pairings for Redford and Fonda, albeit they barely had any screen time together in 1966's ""The Chase"", a legendary bomb documented in dishy detail in James Robert Parish's just-released ""Fiasco: A History of Hollywood's Iconic Flops"". Luckily, they are more in their element here as Redford repeats his hit Broadway performance with rueful, self-effacing wit. He makes his staid lawyer character likable in spite of his initial rigidity and seems to regale in the liberation Paul experiences when he walks out. In what was her last Hollywood ingnue role before Barbarella and political activism beckoned, Fonda is a ball of energy as Corie, effortlessly sexy and flirtatious but surprisingly pure of intent in becoming a housewife. Charles Boyer is ideally cast as Velasco, using his well-worn boulevardier style to great effect, and Mildred Natwick plays Corie's jittery, pink-pill-popping mother with genuine warmth and crack timing. It's worth another look if only to see two stars well before they became icons. Within a couple of years of the film's release, Redford would explode in ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"", and Fonda would turn in startling work in ""They Shoot Horses, Don't They?"". The DVD has no extras except for the trailer.",1140480000,2,2583,5.179425837320574
260834,4,6300216241,"Neil Simon's BAREFOOT IN THE PARK remains to this day a breathless comedy delight, the universal story of two newlyweds and their rocky road to marital bliss.  Following a 6-day (and night) honeymoon at the Plaza Hotel, conservative young lawyer Paul Bratter (Robert Redford) and his vivacious wife Corie (Jane Fonda) settle into domesticity in a fifth-floor walkup apartment building in New York, filled to the rafters with veritable kooks!  Corie's mother Mrs Banks (Mildred Natwick) finds herself being wooed by worldly neighbour Mr Velasco (Charles Boyer) , whilst Paul and Corie slowly adapt themselves (hilariously) to married life!

Robert Redford amiably recreates his Broadway role of Paul and Jane Fonda is just about perfect as Corie.  Mildred Natwick is a hoot as Mrs Banks (and adds a lot of depth and drama to her comedy).  Charles Boyer, in one of his last films, gives Velasco the flash and eccentricities the role requires.  Neal Hefti composed what has become one of the most loved and admired film-scores of the 60s.

Sensational film version of the Broadway hit, which opened in 1963, originally starred Robert Redford and Elizabeth Ashley, and ran for over 1,500 performances.",1130025600,8,1197,5.139175257731959
260835,5,6300216241,This is a classic to beat all classics.  A great story (though very dated - with Fonda trying to be a great wife (and nothing else) is funny in every scene.  The actress who plays Fonda's mother steals the show.  Great entertainment.,1125100800,2,233,4.5
260836,5,6300216241,"This is a classic!  I first saw the 1981 HBO special (on stage with a live audience) with Bess Armstrong and Richard Thomas (John Boy from The Waltons) and liked it. So naturally when I saw the same title airing on Turner Classic Movies years later I was curious to see the movie version. I loved it!

The timing of the one-liners and the actors' facial expressions are priceless. Especially with the running gag of the newlyweds living on the top floor of building with no elevator. The delivery man and the telephone man in the beginning are funny. Jane Fonda, Robert Redford and especially Mildred Natwick have excellent comedic timing. I laughed from beginning to end. Who can forget when Robert Redford's character and Mildred Natwick's character go to a restaurant on Staten Island have dinner and drinks then can't make a fist and their teeth feel 'soft'. HILARIOUS. Another memorable moment is when Mildred Natwick's character assures Charles Boyer's character that she's okay to walk without holding on and then proceeds to tumble down a flight of icy stairs. (I had to rewind this a few several times while laughing). That in itself is worth watching.

Top notch performances by all in this film. A must-see.",1123891200,,1218,4.846153846153846
260837,5,6300216241,"I had forgotten how funny this movie really is until i got it in the mail and watched it the same night. Robert Redford usually not really known for comedic roles, shines in this flick as the straight guy. Jane Fonda, known for being a little eccentric in real life, has no trouble playing one in this movie. The rest of the cast fits their parts to a tee, including the mother-in-law who's comedic delivery and timing is superb. This movie is and will always remain a three generation family favorite. I only wish my mother had lived long enough to watch it again with me.",1123286400,3,573,4.415094339622642
260868,4,6300216241,I really enjoyed this movie. It was fun to watch! The characters are quirky. The movie takes the viewer back to a more innocent time although it was probably ahead of its time on some of the scenes. It's interesting to watch Robert Redford and Jane Fonda in a movie when they appear to be so young! It's the kind of movie that lifts you up!,1121904000,,340,4.166666666666667
260869,3,6300216241,"Having played Velasco in my local community theater productions of BITP, I was curious about the movie.  Unfortunately I was rather disappointed.  It's still the same sitcom plot, you have to accept that, but opening it up destroyed the magic for me.  In the play you never see Velasco's apartment or the wild restaurant.  They're just talked about, and your mind has to create them.

The other major problem is the casting of Jane Fonda - WRONG, WRONG, WRONG!  She just doesn't display the zaniness required for Corie.  Her deep assertive voice makes her seem like more like a corporation exec than a 60's housewife.  There was another actress at the time who would have been perfect - Goldie Hawn.  However, the other actors are terrific.",1121385600,,740,4.809523809523809
260870,4,6300216241,"""Barefoot In The Park"" is, as has been mentioned a zillion time below, Neil Simon's adaptation of his stage play, starring Robert Redford (in the role he created on Broadway) and Jane Fonda (brought in for ""star"" power).

I am not as enamored as the other reviewers...I don't have the natural affinity for the material that they seem to have.

I think it's still pretty ""stagy"" and has not aged as well as many of the other films from the period (1967).

I agree that it's a total kick watching young acting masters like Redford and Fonda in their early phase; it's like watching young colts learn how to gallop. They don't quite have the polish and presence they would soon have, but it's kinda exciting to watch them get there.

Mildred Natwick and Charles Boyer are superlative in their supporting roles...they don't waste a line.

A funny thing happened while I was watching this movie.

I really really didn't like either one of the main characters. At all. A half hour into the movie I could have cared less about either of them...

...and then, without me realizing it, I needed to know how this film was going to end! I ignored some of the flat lines; the plot contrivances didn't seem so contrived...

...I was fully engaged by the end credits. Happily.

I think this will be a nice little surprise to fans of 60s films who haven't yet familiarized themselves with the early careers of either Redford or Fonda.

The disc itself has a decent if not eye-popping picture, and the sound seems to have been cleaned up. There are some great shots of NYC that are not almost 40 years old...

If this means anything, when I started the review, I gave this film three stars, but as I finished writing this little blurb, I had to go back and bump it up one. I've become quite fond of this little film.",1113696000,7,1800,4.49079754601227
260871,4,6300216241,"Neil Simon is a master storyteller and has such an amazing way of creating complexity out of simple characters. I found this film to be one of his better stories.

This movie is timeless and for anyone nostalgic for the 60's it is a walk down memory lane. The story is found in the relationship between two young people who marry and move into a Greenwich apartment. Both the apartment and the relationship need a bit of work and throughout the movie the characters strive for a better living arrangement.

Robert Redford is a bit stiff in his role as the serious lawyer husband to Jane Fonda's perky and ever curious wife. Together they are a mismatch that somehow works or at least you hope it will. The scenes are deeply written with lots of twists and turns and comedic outlets to maintain the viewer's interest. The funniest parts of the story arrive during the scenes with Fonda's mother, Mildred Natwick, and their Hungarian neighbor, Charles Boyer. Opposites attract from all angles and Simon's writing brings all of the mismatches together with an interesting flair.

If you love New York, Redford, Simon or Fonda or just a great old love story with a few laughs this film is for you. So kick off your shoes and enjoy this walk in the park!",1090886400,10,1249,4.617117117117117

260873,4,6300216241,"I watched this movie several times. Each time I watched it, I became more and more enchanted with it. It is very fast-paced and funny, and Robert Redford and Jane Fonda are charming enough to make me reconsider my bachelorhood. It is one of the weirdest movies I have watched in a while, but that is what makes it awesome.",1062979200,2,322,4.383333333333334
260874,5,6300216241,"This one is a winner.  The script is bright, witty and romantic.  Fonda is so cute you can't decide whether to kiss her or kill her - but it works.  Mildred Natwick steals the film from the younger set as Fonda's widowed mother, every scene she is in is laugh-out-loud funny.  Dated, yes - 1967 New York.  In a way though it almost plays better with age.  If your a New Yorker or New York fan, it's a hoot to look at the city scenes from then.  A true feel-good comedy. Highly recommended.",1041206400,3,489,4.193548387096774
260875,4,6300216241,"I thought of this movie often while living my first 6 months in Vilnius in a cold, dank apartment, impatiently waiting for Spring to arrive.  I finally broke down and bought ""Barefoot in the Park"" on DVD and wasn't disappointed.  This movie has aged well, thanks in large part to Jane Fonda's wholehearted performance.  Redford, unfortunately, looked sadly out of place.  The movie bounces bouyantly along on the strength of Jane's indomitable will, aided by wonderful performances from Charles Boyer and Mildred Natwick.  At film's end you wonder why Corrie still has anything to do with her deadbeat husband.  Redford looks positively goofy dancing barefoot in the park, but you just have to imagine he has a good heart.",1040256000,4,722,5.025210084033613
260876,4,6300216241,"I'm no great fan of Neil Simon, but this neat adaption of his popular stage success BAREFOOT IN THE PARK brings a smile to my face--and it probably will yours too.  The story is quite simple: newlyweds Robert Redford and Jane Fonda have moved into a New York apartment building peopled by eccentrics... and their own tiny apartment has hole in the skylight, no heat, and you have walk up five flights to get there.  Redford, a rather stodgy conservative, takes a dim view of the whole thing; Fonda, who has an excessively happy-go-lucky disposition, thinks everything is great fun.  Needless to say, they're soon going at it hammer and tongs.
This is a very contrived, sitcom-ish film, but the cast carries it well.  Although Redford has remained a great star for forty years, his films have been very hit or miss; here he is well cast, and he plays expertly.  During this period of her career, Fonda was very much the perky girl-next-door with a slight sex-kitten spin, and she too is fun to watch.  But the real winners here are Charles Boyer, as their eccentric neighbor, and particularly Mildred Natwick, as Fonda's mother.  Natwick excelled at playing disconcerted matrons, and this is perhaps the best of the many fine, memorable variations of the type she offered during her long and very enjoyable career. BAREFOOT IN THE PARK won't go down in history as a great film, nor will change your point of view.  But it is tremendously good fun, a film I've enjoyed every time time I've seen it--and that is a good many.  Recommended; you'll enjoy it.",1021939200,65,1552,4.718518518518518
260877,5,6300216241,"I love the music in this movie, it always reminds me of the ""old"" New York and the many movies that I have come to enjoy from this era.
Robert Redford.... WHAT A BABE!!!! Jane Fonda.... WHAT A SEXPOT!!! I can watch this 4 nights a week and still laugh at the jokes and I remember seeing this for the first time when I was a kid and now I share it with my 11-year old daughter and she ""loves"" it ""Shamma Shamma el ma Ka Mamma"" LOL
There is so much witty humor from Redford in this movie as well as the Mother that I always end up on the floor laughing at least once during the movie. The Story is cute, not anything heavy or dilemas to figure out just a cute flick.
If you enjoy movies like ""The Out of Towners"" (the original) or ""What's Up Doc"" I think you will like this one.

SPOILER ALERT.....

Paul and Cory just got married.
They go on a honeymoon, which is six days in the Plaza Hotel in New York - -
they never leave the hotel room for the whole six days - -
not that they would need to do any sightseeing anyway because they live in New York.

At the end of the six days, Paul goes to work while Cory stays in their pathetic apartment trying to fix it up.
There are jokes about how they live in a tiny walk-up apartment (top floor) with no elevator and a hole in the ceiling during snowing February.

Paul and Cory go out to dinner with her mother and an old man neighbor.
The four of them have what must have been a wild night in the 60s - - dinner in a weird restaurant.

By the end of that night, Cory is throwing Paul out and asking for a divorce, after 7 days of marriage.
The next day, Paul is drunk - - walking ""barefoot in the park"" and then walking on the roof of the apartment building.
Cory rescues him from falling off of the roof, and they kiss and make up on the roof, while a crowd of people watch from the street and applaud.
