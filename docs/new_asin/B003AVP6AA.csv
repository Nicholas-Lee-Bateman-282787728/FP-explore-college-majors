4104810,4,B003AVP6AA,"I saw this film on tv on a Sunday afternoon when I was fourteen. They used to play a lot of WWII films back then, and most of them were lousy, but I didn't know that because I had nothing to compare them to. I just took it for granted that if someone went to all the trouble and expense of making a movie about a war they must be telling me the truth. I mean, why wouldn't they? Then I saw ""The Victors."" It was as if I was seeing the war for the first time - the real war. After seeing it I could not enjoy any of those other movies because I instantly saw how phoney they are. This film should definitely be available in North American format. I am surprised it is not better known. But I remember scenes in it vividly. If you can see it, look for the segment with Romy Schneider and George Hamilton. Hamilton plays a sensitive soldier on leave with his friend (played by the wonderful George Peppard). They go drinking at a dive in, I think, Belgium. A beautiful young girl (Romy Schneider) starts playing classical music on a cello. No one pays attention, except Hamilton's charecter. He talks to her and it is the classic what's-a-nice-girl-like-you-doing-in-a-place-like-this? He walks her home as if they are two high school students in Ohio leaving the malt shop. They part company at the door to her building. A week or two later (I'm not clear on the time element here), Hamilton and Peppard are on leave again. So, of course, Hamilton goes back to the dive looking for the girl. Unfortunately, he finds her. I won't tell you what happens next. See it for yourself, if you can. But I learned three important lessons about women here. They are not always what they seem, and are sometimes the complete opposite. They are what they are, and you can't change them. And there are some situations you just need to walk away from without looking back. The only reason I don't give this movie an extra star is the mawkish and tasteless scene of an execution. The rest of the movie is about the common experiences of American soldiers in World War II. When I saw the scene of the execution of a deserter I thought the U.S. Army must have been shooting deserters right and left.  Later I found out we shot exactly ONE deserter in the whole war! And the yellow dog had it coming.",1343260800,21,2279,4.387706855791962

4104813,4,B003AVP6AA,"I absolutely agree with the previous reviewer - this film NEEDS to be formatted for NTSC, so we in the America's can see it without jumping through hoops - i.e a conversion program. In my mind, it is one of a handful of classic films about the 2nd World War, with an outstanding international cast (Jeanne Moreau, Albert Finney, Elke Sommer, George Peppard, Romy Schneider, Eli Wallach [an indelible performance], Melina Mecouri, and more) made by a director who was himself a participant in the war. There are compelling images I remember today nearly 50 years after it was released. It is a vivid and cynical war/anti-war film, that shows the absurdity and destruction, on an individual human level, of war. WHY this great film is not more widely available in the US is a mystery - some financial reason undoubtedly applies. I saw this movie years ago when it was first released in theaters and have never forgotten it. You owe it to yourself, if you're someone who loves both truth and art, to see it, at least once. I give it 4 stars, and were it available in a NTSC format, 5+ stars. The only other reviewer here gave it only one star, solely because of the format restriction, and I understand his response - but it might give you a wrong impression, which I'm sure he does not intend - this is a GREAT examination of the 2nd WW, and of all war.",1333497600,26,1351,4.495934959349594

4104820,2,B003AVP6AA,"The Victors, 1963 film

The beginning tells about the 1918 Revolution in Berlin and the end of the Great War. Next there is a picture of the German leader who started WW II. We see the victorious armies marching at the end of the war. Then its 1942 England, the Germans are bombing London. Two soldiers guard a US Army Depot. FDR makes a speech about the postwar era. There is movie about the fighting in Sicily. American soldiers are in a street. Canteens are filled. No looting. We see the soldiers and their lives. They meet the civilian population and converse with them. Soldiers return from the front. They have a dazed look on their faces. Dogs run in the background. MPs break up a fight. Why? The Allies land at Normandy, June 6, 1944. A sergeant checks a house for use by officers. The Free French deal with an enemy pillbox. [A dramatic event.]

Occupants of a concentration camp break out just before American soldiers arrive. Soldiers fill a dancehall, some sit and drink. A young woman plays a violin. Her parents disappeared. Does she let her story match her consort? In December 1944 a truck of soldiers will witness an execution. [The song is ironic.] The Crimean Conference discussed future plans for a better world. [How did that work out?] Women enter the Hotel Flandre while troops wait outside. One bar is Off Limits. An ordinary soldier has calluses on his hands. Magda explains her success in business and life: never give away anything that can be sold. A replacement is given advice. The war in Europe ended in May 1945, the war in Asia ended in September 1945. The sergeant visits a German family and brings food and a gift for Helga. Helgas friend talks about her family. Who will protect them from the Russians? Helga needs the bedroom for her rest. [Does Helga know how to manipulate men?] On his way home he meets another soldier. There is a conflict over passage. Who won?

This movie is taken from a book. It is a collection of scenes or stories about events in WW II. The ending is meant to be ironic, or send a message. It is not a great movie but is worth seeing once. It does not whitewash the ugly details of war, unlike some other movies from the 1950s. It does not show gory details or men screaming in pain. One part seems false, about a soldiers pet dog. Allied soldiers noticed a lack of cats and dogs in Occupied Europe. Cats taste like rabbit, dogs taste like pork. To Hell and Back is also based on a soldiers experiences.",1401321600,2,2468,4.504464285714286
4104821,1,B003AVP6AA,"what were these people thinking that reviewed this movie? this is pure garbage and an insult to every american that fought in ww2. my father fought in the war and this portrayal of american gi's is pure horsebleep. there are many shock features in the movie and the ending is contrived. the scenes involving peter fonda and the puppy are so far etched it is absurd. to say a whole company of soldiers hated that poor dog and used him as a bet for target practice is hideous.this movie belongs in the garbage bin. any ww2 vet would be ashamed of this movie. sure not every american gi was perfect,but this movie is clearly one-sided in it's scope of the events presented here. a very bad waste of good actors.",1401148800,2,708,4.453846153846154
4104822,5,B003AVP6AA,"Some antiwar movies are blatant in their attempts to deride and decry war: All Quiet on the Western Front, Paths of Glory, Catch 22, MASH, Go Tell the Spartans, Apocalypse Now, are just a few of this genre.
But occasionally, a scriptwriter is able to bring a book to life in such a way that the preaching does not get in the way of overall themes. Carl Foreman both wrote and directed The Victors and masterfully interwove both chores into a seamless tapestry that dissects the European Theater of Operations during World War II as a squad of soldiers are led by Eli Wallach portraying a sergeant who takes his job of keeping his men alive while obeying orders seriously. The squad moves from Sicily to Italy to England to France to Germany. Along the way, Wallach's character and others earn deserved promotions but all of them come with extreme costs.
Adding to the sense of realism are newsreels that played in American theaters during the war and afterwards and snippets of film of actual battles and bombings. An all-star cast of Wallach, Romy Schneider, George Peppard, George Hamilton, Peter Fonda, James Mitchum, Vince Edwards, Jeanne Moreau, Melina Mecouri, Elke Sommer, Senta Berger, Albert Finney, and Maurice Monet deliver believable performances, even when the dialogue wears thin.",1401148800,5,1294,4.967741935483871

4104835,5,B003AVP6AA,"I had heard about the 1963 war film ""The Victors"" for years, but have never had the opportunity to see it,
since it is rarely shown on tv and the only dvd available is a region 2 & 4. I was scanning through my Dish
Network HD movie channels the other night and couldn't believe it when I saw ""The Victors"" coming up on
the Sony movie channel. It was the 154 minute version and I recorded it on my DVR. I was STUNNED with
how brutally cold and grim this film is - once you see it, you won't easily forget it.  Definitely not pleasant
viewing. The film is made up of many different sequences and storylines that are interspersed with actual
newsreel footage related to WW2, all in black & white. Director Carl Foreman adapted the film from a short
story collection called ""The Human Kind"" by British author Alexander Baron which he based on his own war
experiences. ""The Victors"" has been called one of the greatest anti-war films ever made, and now I know
why. It's in-your-face, savage, uncompromising, and heartbreaking to watch at times. Twice, I needed to
stop, and take a break, as some of the sequences were so emotionally powerful and hard to watch. I had
heard about the firing-squad execution with the Christmas music (Frank Sinatra singing, ""Have Yourself A
Merry Little Christmas"", then the choir with ""Hark The Herald Angels Sing"" AFTER the execution), but I still
wasn't properly prepared for the stark imagery presented here - very, very dark and disturbing stuff. The
scene where the racist soldiers come in the bar and ask if any ni**ers are there whereupon the two black
soldiers are brutally beaten, had to be powerful cinema for 1963, not to mention today. War is Hell, indeed,
when watching enemy soldiers attempting to surrender with white flags, then getting gleefully slaughtered
with no way out. Just as powerful, the concentration camp scene is heartbreaking as are the scenes when
the new recruit Peter Fonda befriends a little puppy dog out in the field, but is told to get rid of it, or else.
He couldn't do it, of course. I had a particularly hard time with this cruel depiction in the film - not easy to
watch. George Hamilton, George Peppard, and Eli Wallach are the three main stars throughout the film and
deliver fine performances, as do Romy Schneider, Melina Mercouri, Jeanne Moreau, & Elke Sommer, among
others, in their various portrayals as war-battered women. When ""The Victors"" was originally released back
in 1963, it had a running time of around 175 minutes, but 20 minutes of that was cut within weeks. One of
the sequences cut involved a French male prostitute with Hamilton's & Peppard's characters which evidently
was too controversial for that time. Whether a fully restored version of ""The Victors"" will EVER be available
again is unclear - it has been speculated that the cut footage has been lost forever. Produced, directed, &
written by Carl Foreman, ""The Victors"" is definitely a war film on a different level - ironically, there are not
even any actual battle scenes depicted by Foreman in the film, but what is depicted delivers VERY powerful
messages, indeed. A scene towards the end where Peppard's wounded character goes to visit his wounded
Sgt. (Eli Wallach) in the hospital is shocking, sad, and unforgettable - this is just one example of the film's
powerful imagery, as is the final shot of the two Allied soldiers who had just senselessly killed one another.
Stark, direct, and grim, ""The Victors"" is recommended (if you're able to see it), but it's not for those easily
offended or upset.",1379808000,10,3553,4.749190938511327
4104836,5,B003AVP6AA,"Saw the 178 minute version when it first played on an exclusive basis at the Fox Wilshire in Beverly Hills, CA at Christmas 1963.  Several months later I saw it a second time when the picture went on a wider release but this time it had already been cut to 156 minutes.  Where the 22 minutes went only Columbia Pictures (Sony Releasing) and Carl Foreman  knows for sure.  I'm sure that footage is somewhere in the Columbia vaults.  This picture needs to be restored to its full length and released in the US on DVD and Blu Ray.  I'm sure the UCLA film restoration department could do the job if only Sony would agree to the expense.",1379462400,8,632,4.358974358974359
4104837,4,B003AVP6AA,"Interesting format splicing newreels and acting sequences together.  Rather gritty story; not the usual nonsence like The Longest Day with John Wayne, but rather dark for it's time with the blackmarket, an execution, women trading themselves for food, and all ending with a lethal knife fight in Post War Berlin.  I found the part about shooting the puppy disgusting.  We did not harm dogs in the Far East, but rescued them from the stew-pot.  All in all, quite realistic for it's day.  It is not a morality play, but rather one of reality.  The newsreels of FDR appears as a betrayer of Eastern and Central Europe into the hands of Stalin, for those in the know.",1373414400,,663,4.672413793103448
4104838,5,B003AVP6AA,"Recently watched this totally engrossing film (after purchasing the dvd from Amazon) for the first time after seeing it in the theater back in November or December (not sure which) 1962. Couldn't wait to see it again, so that I might relive that (original) experience, and see if it lived up to my expectations after such a long time. It surely DID....and then some. Terrific involving war story with a fine cast (George Peppard, George Hamilton, Eli Wallach, et all) fleshing out some high drama, with some light comic moments. Ironic, subtle, and with some jarring moments. The use of old newsreel footage to enter into certain sequences was very well done. And.....who can ever forget the sequence with the Christmas time deserter execution with the Frank Sinatra recording of ""Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas"", playing on the soundtrack?

4104839,1,B003AVP6AA,"The ""Napoleon"" DVD was a restoration that illustrated, even in a somewhat shabby condition, what a work of cinematic masterpiece  written, and directed by the auteur who takes a small part.  The film and its countless actors and extras demonstrates the invention skills.  But, I have no complaints.  Gance was an avaunt guarde  creative inventor of what are commonplace techniques and modi this day: the close up, long shot, crowd panoramas, and endless et ceteras. The DVD box cover is not the original nor the notes.  But, I have no complaints.
