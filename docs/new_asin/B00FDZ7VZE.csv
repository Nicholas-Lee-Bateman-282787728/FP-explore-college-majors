5978346,2,B00FDZ7VZE,"First off, this should never EVER be rated 5 stars.

OVERALL: 2 out of 5 Stars*
*4 of 5 stars if you are buying this just for Silent Night.

SHORT REVIEW:
+3 ~ Average IMDB rating for each movie is 6.08/10 (or 3 out of 5 stars). I may have liked Silent Night a bit more, and others a bit less. Littlest Angels: Brightest Christmas had no info, but it only drags down the overall average.
+1 ~ Nostalgia: Average Age of the movies is 1968.
-2 ~ Presentation: Video is blocky. This is an issue with any movie collection that tries to squeeze 4 movies onto 1 disc. Grainy old movies actually take more space when digitized, so they botched this part pretty bad.
+0 ~ Price/Value: Meh. I've enjoyed some $1 walmart ""historical cartoons"" more than this collection. I've also disliked some $20 new releases more than this collection.
+1 ~ 1308 minutes of ""entertainment"". Just under 22 hours of your life can be used to watch this collection.
-1 ~ Over HALF of these are Made For TV movies, episodes, or shorts.

5978347,5,B00FDZ7VZE,My wife loves watching Christmas movies during the holiday season and what best then 20 movies all together giving her many hours of Christmas enjoyment.,1387152000,,153,5.16
5978348,3,B00FDZ7VZE,For thew price this was a good buy.  I purchased for a gift.  I am sure they will enjoy watching the DVD.,1387065600,,105,3.727272727272727
5978349,4,B00FDZ7VZE,"No surprise if you read the details prior to buying. Every decade since the 1930s is represented in one or more film features up to the first century of the new millennium. There is only so much you can do for movies created in past, and done at the time with state of the art technology, but much less than the capability of today's HD. What counts in this price-reasonable set is the nostalgia. It is a great assortment of Christmas video that has come down through the ages.

Young viewers will not recognize the stars that made history; they are too young. But those of us who have lived through a good portion of the history represented with these 20 segments of Christmas Past will celebrate anew, just as done when the feature first was shown. the price is less than 4-bits per episode, but then one has to be a bit on the nostalgic-age to even know what 4-bits means. Grin, grin. I'm there.

True, some of the old films have the look of old films. That is expected. I also own a couple of silent movies on DVD and they appear on a HD TV screen just like they did in the nickle movie theater. BW, jumpy, and silent. I love it. For someone born like me in the 1940s, it's a Christmas trip down memory lane. I know new Christmas movies sell for $20 and more, so if these were current movies the set would be selling for 20 X $20 or $400. Nostalgia is still Christmas joy and on the inexpensive side. I like that.

This is a fun set of DVDs that can be played continuously, quietly as background throughout the days ahead of Christmas Day; much like a Christmas music CD. But when something exciting, and memorable comes on, one can sit and view as well as listen. At least for those of us blessed with the stay-at-home days.
We enjoy our purchase. But then we enjoy all things retro. We are retro.
Merry Christmas one and all.",1386979200,137,1831,4.301449275362319
5978350,5,B00FDZ7VZE,I thought I had seen all the old christmas movies. Boy was I wrong. We have enjoyed these movies and savored each moment of truly fine products. Did I miss these growing up or were they on obscure channels of T.V. They should be replayed for nostalgia or for the new generation to witness old set values.

5978355,2,B00FDZ7VZE,There were to many cartoon style kids (shows really) movies. Also most of the movies are so bad with the music/voices not matching or being distorted as well as the picture being fuzzy and hard to watch. I watched all the movies b/4 I left this review. I was very disappointed b/c I love old movies. I honestly would say there were 3-4 good movies out of 20.

aka
FAMILY HOLIDAY FILM COLLECTION

I am working my way through this collection of twenty holiday movies, and will keep adding reviews for each movie after I watch them.

Already, I have decided that this collection is worth FIVE STARS, not as an average of the reviews of the individual movies (I only gave the fourth movie three stars), but because I believe that everyone will get FIVE STARS worth of enjoyment from this collection.

(I do include a few spoilers in my reviews, but not enough, in my opinion, to ruin the movie for you.)

Here is a list of the movies, by decades:

1930's: Scrooge '35
1940's: Beyond Tomorrow '40, The Pilgrimage Play '49, Christmas Carol '49
1950's: Great Rupert '50, Star Shall Rise '52, Nativity '52, Miracle on 34th Street '55, Santa Claus '59
1960's: Santa Claus Conquers the Martians '64, Littlest Angel '69
1970's: Santa and the Three Bears '70, City that Forgot About Christmas '74, First Christmas '75
1980's: Christmas Without Snow '80, George and the Christmas Star '85
1990's: Angel of Pennsylvania Avenue '96, Christmas Memory '97
2000's: Silent Night '02, Littlest Angels: Brightest Christmas '04

----- THE ANGEL OF PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE -----
----- starring Robert Urich, Diana Scarwid, Tegan Moss -----

From the box --- ""When a man is arrested for a crime he didn't commit, his three children are determined to get him out of jail in time for Christmas.""

My Review --- I loved this the first time I saw it, and I love it even more this time --- I am more than happy to give this file five stars.

This is a feel-good movie that is based on a real-life incident, though I understand that the real Bernice Feagan actually took a bus from Detroit to Washington, with support from others. But it was wonderful imagining that three kids could try to travel on their own without the help.

The actual charge was different. Their father was in jail for car theft, not murder, but again, that does not detract from the movie.

What's wonderful about the movie is that it gives a fairly accurate (if dramatic fictional) look at the times, Hooverville's did exist, hobos did ride the rails, and there was an entire network of information that helped people know what R.R. stops had the worst reputations for arresting the rail-riders.

They even managed to include the dangers of hitchhiking. Don't ride with drunks, and strangers might take advantage of children (and adults) traveling alone.

I will watch this excellent movie again in years to come. It is a wonderful movie that is semi-historical both with the story and with its depression-era settings.

I give President Hoover and ""The Angel of Pennsylvania Avenue"" a grand total of FIVE GRAND GOLDEN STARS

----- A CHRISTMAS MEMORY -----
----- starring Patty Duke, Piper Laurie -----

From the box --- Christmas means something different to everyone. For seven-year-old Buddy it means a new home and a new family.

My Rating --- 4.5 stars (Yes, I know that's cheating)

My Review --- I also saw this movie some time ago. It took me awhile to get into it back then, and it took me awhile to get into it this time, but the scenes do seem to be very representative of what life was like so many years ago, in the years of Roosevelt's presidency.

Buddy is seven years old, his parents had split up and his mom had dumped Buddy with some elderly cousins long before the movie started. Those cousins are siblings who, many years before, had been raised by the oldest sister because their parents died, leaving the oldest to raise the others.

Buddy and Sook, possibly the youngest of the old siblings, probably the weakest willed of the bunch, develop a close relationship, but he is growing up. The domineering oldest sister rules the roost and decides that Buddy must go to Military School, but while all of this is going on, Buddy and Sook enjoy their adventures, including visiting a prohibition era joint to get one very important ingredient for her fruitcakes. Sook makes mistakes, but Buddy thrives, and develops a friendship with a girl in the area.

Along the way, we see how the community members do help each other, like the postal clerk who tells Sook that the amount of postage that she is short will just be covered by one of her fruitcakes.

I'd like to say that the oldest rode a bit too roughshod over her siblings, but it might have been better in the long run. The movie ends as Buddy gets on the bus to go to Military School.

It is a compliment to Patty Duke that I did not realize that she played this character until afterward, when I saw her name on the box.

I do understand that Buddy's story might be based, in part, on real life, but unlike ""The Angel of Pennsylvania Avenue"", I do not know the details. You might look up ""Capote"" and this title for more information.

I will watch this movie again, and I'm torn between giving it four or five stars, so let me call it 4.5 stars.

----- SILENT NIGHT -----
----- starring Linda Hamilton, Matthew Harbour

From the box --- Based on a true story, this tale of nobility and courage inspires, restores faith, and offers a lesson in the true spirit and meaning of Christmas

My Rating --- FIVE stars

My Review --- This movie starts out slowly, but we quickly find out that this mother and son must deal with soldiers from both sides in 1940's World War Two Germany. The mother manages to enforce a Christmas Eve peace between both sides, surprisingly by first convincing both sides that they can leave their weapons outside. Yes, they do have problems once in awhile, including a misunderstanding based on one of the American soldiers having a German Iron Cross in his possessions, which insults the German soldier who thought he'd taken it from a dead soldier.

Some reviewers hate the fact that the soldiers did share some wine or other drinks, but we have to remember that in those years, alcohol did show up in the battlefields. Even in M*A*S*H, we see how often soldiers enjoy their libations. In a way, the film might have seemed fake had the alcohol not been included. I did not think it was overbearing.

This film is based loosely on actual WW2 incidents, but even if it is very loosely done, I still enjoy this movie tremendously. I did see this movie some years ago but it was just as enjoyable this time.

----- LITTLEST ANGELS: BRIGHTEST CHRISTMAS ----- Animated

My rating --- 3 stars (it's okay, but someone with kids will rate it 5 stars)

From the box --- It's been a bad year for the McShane family, but this Christmas they will get a little help from a lot of new friends.

My comments: I watched this while typing reviews that you see above. I did watch it while typing, but I really could not get into the movie. It was just a little too juvenile for my adult tastes. Maybe it would have been different if I were a child in the ought's (the 2000's) then returned to it in the 2050's or 2060's.

I'm sure that kids will love all the angels who are themselves angels, and the angelic dog, who help families with kids here on Earth.

----- SCROOGE  (the 1935 B&W movie) -----
----- starring Seymour Hicks, Donald Caltrop, Robert Cochran

From the box --- Charles Dickens' classic about a miserable man who cares more about his money than anything else in the world.

My rating: 4 stars (better than okay, but there are much better versions of The Christmas Carol out there)

My review: What can anyone say about the Christmas Carol. It is Charles Dickens' iconic and well-known story, a novel that gives us a look into what Christmas was like before we turned it into an international holiday, when businessmen could easily keep average workers in servitude, even on Christmas, when they could put people in prison for being behind in their payments on atrocious debts.

The copy of the recording leaves a lot to be desired, but what can you expect with a 1935 movie.

I will watch it again in years to come because every few years, I like to watch all the various Christmas Carols that are out there, even the ones with female Scrooges.

----- A CHRISTMAS WITHOUT SNOW -----
----- starring Michael Learned, John Houseman, Ramon Bieri

From the box --- A divorced woman moves to a new city with her child, trying to build her life again.

My review --- to be added after I watch it again

----- THE PILGRIMAGE PLAY -----
----- starring Nelson Leigh, Stephen Chase, Leonard Penn

From the box --- The historical events such as the Sermon on the Mount and the Last Supper are portrayed in this period piece about Christ's journey through the countryside.

My review --- to be added after I watch the film

----- A STAR SHALL RISE ----- b&w -----
----- starring Raymond Burr, Richard Hale, John Crawford

From the box --- The story of the Three Wise Men's search for Jesus and their discovery of a new star that leads them to the Christ child.

----- CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION -----

I highly recommend the FAMILY HOLIDAY FILM COLLECTION, which Amazon, for some reason, calls FAMILY HOLIDAY GIFT SET. I give the collection FIVE STARS because I got FIVE STARS of ENJOYMENT from the collection. Some of the individual movies are not worth five stars, but the collection definitely is.",1422316800,26,12517,4.678391959798995

I did read the description of this set and understood they were older films, which I was fine with. What I was not happy with was the terrible quality. Two sided DVD s? Who does that? They scratch very easy making them 2 sided to cut costs. Nothing was remastered to improve sound or viewing quality. Several movies h ad no sound at all, several were so grainy they were impossible to watch. Children's cartoons were just ridiculous and not movies.
I've purchased similar products like this at the dollar store.",1389830400,29,597,4.6761904761904765
