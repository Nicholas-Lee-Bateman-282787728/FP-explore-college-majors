7989458,5,B000093NT5,"This is a brilliant documentary that really shows from the inside what life is like in a ghetto where there are no economic possibilities for young people, no jobs, and very few ways out. It's a sadly beautiful portrait of life in Brooklyn in the projects, and the viewer will surely notice that there are no libraries, no stores, no playgrounds, no swimming pools, nothing nice for people to do and nowhere pleasant for them to hang out. Hopefully, viewers will come away with a deeper understanding of how things work in the hood and why they work that way.",1214784000,,559,4.6
7989459,4,B000093NT5,"Having lived in East New York for 12 years, and remaining very close the community, I can attest to the street authenticity of Black Picket Fence. This is basically a docudrama that follows the lives of an aspiring rapper and his close friend who is just released from prison. For those who don't know, East New York is a section of Brooklyn with a historically high crime rate. As there are many East New York's in the United States the story is indicative of the struggles of many young black males who are continuously tempted by the lure of fast-buck crime as they attempt to locate comfort within a world that is mainly indifferent to their existence. Producer Sergio Goes does an excellent job in capturing the pulsating turbulence of the environment where the subjects reside, as well as presenting their individual characteristics in a manner that allows the viewer to comprehend and appreciate their state of mind.  For many Americans the ghetto is a caricatural habitat; for many residents of the ghetto it is the only world they will ever know. Goes provides an open gate along the Black Picket Fence which otherwise draws the line between both sides of ignorance.",1122508800,5,1175,4.816831683168317

7989461,5,B000093NT5,"This film is in your face. After watching BPF the first time i felt the adrenaline of being on the streets of New York, felt the connection of Tiz, Mel and the crew and felt the message Goes worked so hard to get over the 2 years it took to film this in the real.
No cliches, just true life dreams of success in the struggle. These stories are rugged but somehow they translate to everyone's desire for love, happiness and security.
One of my all time favorites!

7989462,5,B000093NT5,"Sergio Goes, the director of this intriguing documentary, goes farther and deeper into the making of a rap artist than the makers of the film ""8 Mile."" Like the movie, the doc does a good job of delving into the oddyssey of a struggling rapper, but ""Black Picket Fence"" goes the extra mile to show how the real-life musician finds his way out of the 'hood' and ironically ends up in the 'burbs.' Whether his modest success is a spin-off of the American Dream, as the title implies, I'm not sure...but it's quite a journey, and there are some memorable scenes along the way.",1057449600,3,573,4.519230769230769

7989464,5,B000093NT5,"FINALLY, someone was able to look beyond all of the stereotypes typically associated with young black men and women who live in the ghetto.
Sergio Goes dug beneath the surface of gangs, drugs, poverty, violence and death, and found a group of dedicated, passionate, loyal, ambitious, loving and courageous young men and women.
This film is insightful, inspiring and brave!",1056499200,5,372,5.216666666666667
