8145373,4,B000IHB6WG,"It's been a few years since the last time i saw it on my UK DVD. It's great seeing it again in HD. This film stars Byung-hun Lee who is 1 of my favourite actors.

I enjoy most of the action scenes in this film. Some good fight scenes and shootouts. I must also mention the music which i like. I really like that classical song which the woman plays. Solid Gangster film in my opinion.

Picture quality: 3.5/5

This actually looks a bit better than my DVD, but Content Zone have used DNR. Not the worst film i have seen using DNR, but there should and could be more visible grain and details. I am still glad i bought, despite the DNR. There are still details left and i think it looks good. The colours looks good like for example the blood.

Audio quality: 4/5

Yes, i think the Korean: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track sounds pretty good. Some good bass and the music sounds nice. I didn't hear any problems.

Film: 4/5
