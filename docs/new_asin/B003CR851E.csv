8633757,3,B003CR851E,"I do not normally review videos, but since this has no review yet I will offer mine.

Note that this DVD will not play on most North American players.  It would not work on my standard player, but I also have a universal DVD player for overseas DVDs and it worked fine on that.

Summary

3 stars for production quality, 2 stars for story/entertainment, 3 stars overall (objective qualities trump the subjective ones, because you might enjoy the story more than I did).  Fans of the Kurosawa classic can safely skip this one.  And for those unfamiliar with the original, this is a forgettable story with mediocre video and subtitle quality.

Objective Evaluation

The packaging is typical for a DVD.  There is no bonus material except for trailers.  The image quality looks like a made for TV production.  It lacks crispness and is blurry at times.  The subtitles are smaller than usual and the letters have rough edges, not the easiest to read, though they do convey the meaning of the dialogue well enough.  Sound quality is decent.  3 stars.

Subjective Evaluation

Minor spoilers here, but it shouldn't ruin the story for you.  Artistically this film is nothing special.  Camera angles and visual presentation are merely adequate.  The music is uninspired.  The dialogue is forgettable, and the acting is workmanlike but occasionally over the top.

Compared to the original, the positives are few.  The swordplay is better, and the fortress looks more like a prepared refuge than a cave.  The remake adds a bit more action, and overall feels like an action film with daring leaps and exciting falls.  It introduces a mysterious green gas that is both highly poisonous and conveniently explodes; there's an incredibly cheesy explosion scene.  Though the remake is 21 minutes shorter than the original, I found myself impatient for it to just end.

Here's how to ruin a classic adventure tale with a remake:  remove the humor, add explosions to a samurai movie, add a romance that feels forced and unnecessary, change ""the scarfaced warrior"" story of uplifting redemption to one of grim revenge, and have the princess weep over the plight of commoners at every turn (with lines such as ""Do the common folk believe they need rulers?"" and ""The worst villain is me."").  The original gave the princess awareness of the privileges of nobility, with a strong reaction to the fate of Rokurota's sister and her insistence upon freeing one of her people from slavery.  The remake takes this to a politically correct level of obsession (but if you like that sort of thing, then this might be a positive change for you).

Rokurota's role is diminished in the remake, apparently to allow the princess to do more foolish things which require her to be rescued.  The original princess carried herself with cleverness and a certain majesty.  After the inspiration of the fire festival she was serene in the face of danger.  The remake's princess is emotional and impulsive.  Some viewers might prefer this version but it just didn't feel like she was a princess.  In the original, the ""scarfaced warrior"" (I'm limiting spoilers) had a powerful transformation and an uplifting moment of redemption.  In the remake he's just a nasty villain.  Such a waste.  But the worst character change is of the two ""dimwits"", who in the remake have a different history and provide very little humor.

Every remake tries to add a little something new.  Some succeed.  This one does not.  2 stars for story value.",1484006400,,3483,4.883760683760684
