8206482,1,B000SPMGOA,"This dvr looks as though it was recorded from someone's slide presentation.  It's contents, especially with regard to HIV, are inaccurate.  If you want the gross out pictures, there are not that many.  Save your money and time.  I had hoped to use it to give presentations on STD transmission.  You will lose your audience with in ten minutes.",1202428800,3,343,4.745762711864407
8206483,4,B000SPMGOA,"If you want to learn about the most common (and some uncommon) sexually transmitted diseases, this is the video for you.  I searched the internet for STD videos and found only two or three. They were only VHS tapes and cost $145 for a 20 minute video. This video is 1 hours, in DVD format, and the cost is reasonable! The first two chapters are general information on the types and frequency of various STDs. But after that, be prepared to see some very graphic photos of these diseases along with information on each disease.  Some of the diseases covered are gonorrhea, syphilis, herpes, Chlamydia, scabies, lice, and warts.  I had never heard of Lymphogranuloma venereum, molluscum, and granuloma inguinale but I now know about them and the awful destructive changes they cause to the sex organs. There is a 72 page sexually transmitted diseases manual in adobe pdf format on this dvd which can be viewed on your computer. This manual file by itself is almost worth the price of the dvd.  For the price and the information, this dvd is the best available and I highly recommend it. By the way, be prepared for the inside cover of the dvd jacket, as it has 17 full color pictures of sexually transmitted diseases.",1189123200,8,1215,4.663551401869159
