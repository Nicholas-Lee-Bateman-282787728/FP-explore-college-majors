3148354,3,B0015WJC2Y,"If you're a big Amy Winehouse fan like me, then you'll find ""Amy Winehouse: The Girl Done Good (2008)"", just OK. Unlike her previous DVD ""I Told You I Was Trouble: Amy Winehouse Live From London (2007)"" which was fantastic, ""the Girl Done Good"" is more of a promotional disc by artists and arm-chair quarter-backers who comment on Amy's singing style and career.",1257638400,,362,4.761904761904762
3148355,3,B0015WJC2Y,I actually did not pay sufficient attention to note that this was a DVD rather than a CD.  But interesting none the less.,1253491200,,121,4.260869565217392
3148356,4,B0015WJC2Y,"If you really really really like Amy Winehouse than you will enjoy this DVD.  You certainly will enjoy it more than ""Amy Winehouse Revving @ 4500 rpm's & justified""  The girl done gone includes interviews with people who have worked with her in the past.  What I really liked about it is that it breaks down WHY this lady is such a musical  talent.",1233878400,3,348,4.390625
3148357,5,B0015WJC2Y,"This is an excellently produced, entertaining doc...really refreshing and informative to see and hear real jazz connoisseurs analyze Amy's work.  It's a must see for even the casual Winehouse fan.  It makes you realize how truly gifted this woman is.",1231632000,3,250,5.225
3148358,5,B0015WJC2Y,"I bought this half expecting to be disappointed, but ended up absolutely enthralled for the entire program.

For those who can't really articulate the special something that she has that so many find so appealing, this dvd offers several experts who really know music to dissect it all.  I found that I appreciate her even more after understanding the roots of her sound and style.  It's hard to believe at 24 that she has absorbed enough musical history to be such a petri dish of artists past.  It is all articulated in a way that allows someone like me who doesn't even read music to understand her influences and appreciate her amazingly prodigious musical acumen.

There are also many clips of Amy as well as her many influences performing that serve to connect the dots.  I think anyone interested in Amy in particular, or just music in general, will not be disappointed.",1216252800,18,877,4.7368421052631575
3148359,1,B0015WJC2Y,"I like to say Im one of Amy's biggest fans and I have a massive collection of her stuff and when this was released I was so excited about getting it and when I finally did I was very disappointed. Its just a bunch of old british people trying to analyze everything Amy has ever done in fact there aren't that many clips of her in the dvd at all. I paid 17.00 dollars for this thing and I wish I would have kept my money because its the worse Amy purchase I have ever bought. If you like  watcing a bunch of old people talking in british accents about why ""they"" think she did this and that this is the dvd for you....however unless that sound appealing I wouldnt buy this prodict.",1213660800,11,680,4.112781954887218
3148360,3,B0015WJC2Y,"For Winehouse Fans - and for the curious

With Winehouse all over the tabloids due to her drug rehab problems and marital difficulties, the lady with lots of ""attitude"" and ""big hair"", plus one hell of a powerful voice has lots of US folks wondering about her life before the mega-hit album ""Back To Black"".

This late-2007 ""analysis"" of here career is the latest from the UK company Chrome Dreams in their ""Under Review"" series. Each of these features six or seven music journalists discussing specific albums from an artist, with video excerpts (I emphasize the word ""excerpts"") of the songs discussed.

Winehouse started her recording career in 2003 (with the UK album ""Frank"", which jazz vocal influenced (think Billie Holiday or Dinah Washington). Her next, and only other album was 2006's ""Back to Black"", which hit the US market in 2007.

With only two albums (both 180 degrees different from each other) in a five-year career, a full 80-minute analysis is a bit of overkill. And, unlike previous ""Under Review"" discs, not one of the ""talking heads"" has a bad thing to say about the performer or hints at even one track ""might be weak"". This is a true ""Amy Fan Club"".

Still, I was curious about her pre-""Back To Black"" days and, while I didn't learn when, or why, she got all her tattoos, or how she met her musician husband, I get find the disc interesting to watch once. The production qualities are of the high standard I've seen in other recent Chrome Dreams DVDs.

If you are looking for a performance video, this is not it. If however, you want to learn more about Winehouse's music career, you'll get what you are looking for. Add a ""star"" if you are a true Winehouse ""fan"".
