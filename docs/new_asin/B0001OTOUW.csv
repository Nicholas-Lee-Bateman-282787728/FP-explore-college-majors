8015835,5,B0001OTOUW,"In September of 2003 players of the United States women's soccer team were gifted, by Yahoo!, a video camera to personally document every step of their quest to defend their historic 1999 Women's World Cup victory. The videos, which were posted on Yahoo!'s official Women's World Cup website, provide a candid look at lives of these top athletes in one of the most exciting and important tournaments of their lives.

This dvd is a compilation of those those videos.

You learn from this dvd that these players are great friends, funny girls, and intelligent strong women. You see them watching Saturday college football, getting ready for practice, playing pranks, showing off their dance moves, and so much more. They're charming and personable and after spending the afternoon with this dvd you'll feel like you just made 20 new best friends.",1276041600,,844,5.021428571428571
