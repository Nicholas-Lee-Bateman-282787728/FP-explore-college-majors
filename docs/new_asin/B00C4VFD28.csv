Kelly McCann and instructors do another fine job. Highly recommend to anyone who is serious about protecting themselves or others.",1432252800,,177,6.12
8577305,5,B00C4VFD28,"This is a fantastic DVD on using combatives in close, tight places.  Kelly and crew do a fantastic job in giving you the tools and scenarios to apply these combatives explosively in environments where we don't have the luxury of space.  I have been practicing these with my students and the results and feedback from my students has been nothing but positive.  Kelly knows his stuff.  I have studied and used his material for years and have started training under him and plan to continue in the future.  The guy is the real deal.",1424908800,,530,4.595744680851064
8577306,5,B00C4VFD28,"...another excellent training video from McCann.  Addresses one of the more likely criminal assault scenarios you'll face-a parking lot!  Entering or exiting your vehicle an assailant appears with or without a weapon.  How to best respond if you're armed and if you're not; if your assailant approaches from the driver side or enters your vehicle's passenger seat.  Some basic instructions of how to use your vehicle to ram your way out when another vehicle has blocked your path.  McCann emphasized there is no 1,2,3,- a,b,c, formula.  This isn't ""car kata.""  It's a confined space and limits your options.  You can employ certain combative principles though.  Bottom line,-IT""S A FREAKIN' SCRAP!!!  Outstanding video/audio production.  McCann's the best in the business!",1404432000,,772,5.4033613445378155
