6300232,5,B00IVLRC88,"this should definitely be in your DVD collection!  I, too, watched this on PBS last night - twice actually, since my station repeats programs after prime time - and was absolutely dumbfounded at how little I knew about this amazing group and the influence they had (and still have) on American AND British music!  But in my defense, I was barely post-puberty when they appeared on Ed Sullivan and was too busy screaming and swooning to be concerned with any affect what I was hearing would have on future generations of musicians.

Another reason to snag this DVD: since DC himself has been quite stingy about releasing DC5 tunes, unless you have money to burn for the few overpriced CDs available, this is your best opportunity to get a good chunk of their greatest hits, with the added benefit of seeing them performed.  Watching Mike Smith (R.I.P.) belt them out while DC does his magic on the drums is an experience in itself.  Commentaries by greats such as The Boss (Springsteen), Paul McCartney, Elton John and Stevie Wonder are just frosting on the cake.

Upon learning how few *affordable* DC5 CDs are available, I'm kicking myself for giving away my one and only DC5 vinyl album years ago.  Oh well, come mid-May the arrival of this DVD will make up for that fit of stupidity and I'll also be content in the knowledge that because the DC5's music is timeless, they'll be one Sixties rock group my grandchildren won't snicker at when they watch it.  ;-}",1397001600,55,1462,4.68359375
6300233,5,B00IVLRC88,"Like the person above, I grew up on the Dave Clark 5 and saw the last hour of this program tonight. Very well produced and directed, this movie is fabulously heartwarming and show the immense skills of Dave and the band. I never knew that so many other top notch performers had such high regard for Dave Clark, including Sir Paul McCartney, Sir Lawrence Olivier, Sir Ian McLellan, Stevie Wonder, Sir Elton John and many more. Can't wait to see the whole program. 17 albums in 4 years, 14 (maybe 15) top ten hits in a row. These guys are a huge history lesson in Rock and Roll. The Dave Clark Five, The Beatles and The Rolling Stones are perfect examples of the best of the best and anyone who thinks they know R&R history, better know a lot about this band. This video will take you there.",1396915200,30,789,4.337837837837838
6300234,5,B00IVLRC88,"I preordered this and just saw the show on Great Performances and it is an INCREDIBLE show as a fan of this great band ever since the 60s it was a joy to relive the memories of those days. Not only is this a great time capsule of the DC5 it also contains a good bit of comentary from Paul McCartney, Elton John and Bruce Springsteen and many others. I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone that loves this band as I do or for anyone that loves the music of the British Invasion and the 1960s. I received this dvd and was glad to see it contained 2 hours of extras but as a long time fan I am very disappointed in the extras. One hour is full if DC5 rare appearances such as their long lost Ed Sullivan but the other hour is a long bore about the musical Time including a 30 minute interview with Freddy Murcury who as an incredible performer in his own right does not belong on this dvd. I would have much rather seen a concert or more interviews with the DC5. This as anyone who follows this band knows is just another instance where Mr. Clark has once again put his own self interest before the interests of his fans.",1396915200,73,1113,4.1336405529953915

6300251,2,B00IVLRC88,"Back in the 80s when I was a kid and discovering the music of these great 60s groups, the DC5 were ALWAYS an anomoly. I was aware of and occassionally heard some of their biggest hits, but info was scarce. This was not too unusual because back then it was still difficult to find info and certain recordings of greats like the Kinks and the Yardbirds, having to do with multiple label contracts. Ulitmately, the DC5 fell back into file of mystery groups.

I recall an article in 1991 in which Dave was finally giving permission to put their music on CD because he believed the technology then ""sounded as good as the original singles"". Whether he actually did this or not, oldies radio still didn't play them very much, even though a lot of groups benefitted from rediscovery of their material once it was re-released during the new CD age.

So flash forward to present day. I lend this disc set from my local library excited at the prospect of finding out about this mysterious group and possibly picking up a copy because I'd want to own it.

Not a chance.

Firstly, this is a poorly done documentary. Just a mishmash of stuff and a sometimes barely discernable timeline for the events.

Secondly, and others have said this more eloquently than I, but this is just an homage to Dave Clark. Until I saw this, I knew NOTHING of the other band members, and I STILL know almost NOTHING. Looks like I'll need to find a biography that Dave hasn't sued to get some real inside info.

Thirdly, the live clips aren't live, their lipsynched, and as soon as my eyes settle in on another band member (usualy Mike Smith, which is natural since he's SINGING), bang there's another long shot moving forward of the drummer smiling straight at you in another close up. Dave must have specified it in his contracts with the TV shows, because it NEVER stops. I wanted to watch Mike sing, but no, we need to see who OWNS the band.

Sorry, but I won't recommend buying this unless you're desperate to see SOMETHINGabout the DC5 and can't lend it from some other place. It's just NOT worth the egomania and you won't find much new information. Read posts on the internet to find out about the band, as you'll probably find more truth there.",1468800000,,2220,4.521197007481296

6300255,2,B00IVLRC88,"I wish I could be more complimentary about this documentary. The Dave Clark Five originated from Tottenham, North London, and initially made their name performing live shows in dance-halls to ecstatic audiences.

With hits such as ""Glad All Over,"" and ""Bits and Pieces,"" they hit the big-time in Britain, and (according to this documentary) managed to crack the American market as well. They were much more dedicated to live performance than The Beatles, which helped to enhance their popularity.

Sadly the facts don't stand up to scrutiny. The group were certainly more popular than The Beatles for a time in the mid-Sixties, but by the late Sixties they had dropped out of favor. They enjoyed a brief renaissance between 1967 and 1970, but then disbanded. The eponymous leader of the group then made it as something of a tycoon; he bought the rights to the ITV series READY STEADY GO, and arranged for selected episodes to be re-broadcast on Channel 4 in the Eighties.

At times this documentary veers towards the self-parodic - a kind of serious THIS IS SPINAL TAP, perhaps. Celebrities of various ages and professions are wheeled on and off to contribute their reminiscences, which seldom depart from the usual collection of mealy-mouthed clichs (""oh, yes, they were great""). The narrative is often lost amidst the sheer amount of reminiscence, while Dave Clark (who directs the piece) makes sure he appears frequently in archive footage as well as interviews.

This is a self-indulgent documentary, of interest, perhaps, to aficionados of Sixties British bubblegum, but few others.",1463875200,,1587,5.115830115830116
6300256,4,B00IVLRC88,"While I enjoyed it I was a little surprised there weren't more songs shown in their entirety. It's a documentary that takes you through their career right on through their induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which was a speech by Tom Hanks. You'll hear Bruce Springsteen rave about the DC5 and how Mike Smith was underrated as an outstanding lead vocalist. Sadly, Mike died two days before their induction to the Hall. He died knowing he was heading for eternal glory. This bit about him dying two days beforehand is not mentioned. But overall, a good piece for DC5 collectors because Dave is tight fisted when it comes to finding more unheard of music and tid bits by them.",1463270400,,683,4.560975609756097
6300257,5,B00IVLRC88,Great! These guys were just as good as the The Beatles.,1463184000,,55,4.090909090909091
6300258,3,B00IVLRC88,"I saw this on PBS, and I have to admit, as someone born in 1963 and who has devoted much of his spare time to rock music, I had NEVER heard the DC5 on major rock radio. So I really did not know any of these tunes. The documentary gave me the genuine feeling that the DC5 were, in their day, every bit as big as the Beatles, and it made me wonder what the hell happened?

Now, after reading so many of the well-written negative reviews, I get the fuller picture. Dave Clark has torpedoed his group's legacy by withholding everything from circulation--no wonder I had never heard them on the radio throughout the 1970s, 80s, and up to the present.

The one thing I felt compelled to share, is that Tom Hanks truly embarasses himself (and me!) in his ridiculously gushing performance at the Hall of Fame induction ceremony. Though I enjoyed the rest of the film (at the time), Hanks was absolutely cringe-inducing.

Gene Simmons would have come off better without the makeup this time around. It was just out of place.

Buy it or don't, but the negative reviews are right on the money.",1462233600,,1082,4.44949494949495

6300260,4,B00IVLRC88,"My only gripe (besides that I couldn't watch Disc 2 becuae it was defective, or my player was), really, is that with as many songs as they had, why did PBS have to keep playing parts of the same ones over and over?",1459555200,2,214,4.0
6300261,3,B00IVLRC88,"Could have been better. I saw this on PBS and enjoyed it but it could have been much better. My problem is with the ""Editorial Reviews"" above the Product Details for this disc. It states ""Featuring 4 hours of star-studded performances! "". How can there be 4 hours of performances when the 2 discs run a total of 120 minutes? Do the math. Plus about half the material is interviews and not very many full song performances. Also some songs are done ""Over And Over"". I was a teen in the 60's and loved the DC5 music and it holds up well today. Dave Clark was a smart business man at the time by retaining the masters after a short period and also buying Ready, Steady Go but his smartness is long gone since he has sat on this material forever without releasing it to the public.",1459123200,3,777,4.292517006802721
6300262,3,B00IVLRC88,"Tough to rate this - my disappointment makes me want to rate to rate it lower, but at the same time I do appreciate seeing anything about what was once my favorite band.

I'll try to sum up my feelings -
First, if you never heard of this band (that for a while at least really did rival the Beatles in popularity), I really don't think there is anything on here that will make you a fan.  They essentially play the same song (Glad All Over) over and over and over again.  Then, you have Tom Hanks over the top screaming how great they they were.  I was embarrassed - if you have to tell people a band was great, almost by definition they weren't.

Second - at long last I really thought I'd hear some live performances.  There are some, but not many.  I've read many places where people doubt they ever played live (of course they did; I went to two or three concerts as a kid and even through the screaming I knew it sounded live without echo effects etc from the record.)  But essentially all the TV appearances (18 on Ed Sullivan alone) were lip synced apparently.  (I think maybe the first one was live and reportedly Dave didn't like how it sounded.  Or how HE sounded)  I hated bands lip-synching.  I owned the record - I wanted to hear THEM.  Even as a kid, I assumed it meant they couldn't play well.  Many people have now concluded they couldn't play AT ALL.  What a disservice.

Lastly - the catalog is STILL in a vault.  I have the Hits CD but that's out of print now too.  So of course few people who weren't fans 50 years ago don't know them.  And sadly that ship has sailed.  There will never be a large Dave Clark Five fandom ever again.  And why?  Dave himself killed off his own ( and the band's) legacy.

Three of the five are now gone, and Dave is still is holding out for some big payday?  That opportunity is long gone.  Or maybe he wants to deprive Lenny and the estates of the others from a payday?  An entire form of music reproduction (CDs) has essentially come and gone.  And Dave is still holding out.

I loved the music and still do.  But the shine has worn off a lot after watching this - realizing Dave was simply owned a company and the musicians in the band were his employees.  And then Dave drove the company out of business.",1456963200,8,2259,4.22248243559719

6300280,3,B00IVLRC88,"I felt a little empty afterwards thinking that I would get some in-depth trivia/information about the group similar to the Beatles Anthology.  There were only a couple of clips of the band performing live, a Royal Command Performance one of them, and startling lack of interview material from group members other than Dave.  Mike Smith is given ample time, but Lenny Davidson is still alive and Rick Huxley surely was alive while this project was being developed, but we hear nothing from either one.  There were no comments from their record producer, sound engineer nor session musicians and given some of the controversy surrounding who actually wrote the band's original material one would expect to hear something about that.  A little archive digging could've probably found some significant press conference footage (w/voice).  Maybe I'm just a trivia junky.... Certainly plenty of good, however; Paul McCartney, Twiggy, Bruce Springsteen, Max Weinberg, Steve van Zandt and Whoopi Goldberg (who'd a thunk) provided especially good comments.  Could've done w/out Gene Simmons' and the Osbournes' input and the interviews w/the ""original fans"" that open the DVD are less than sensational.  Tons of great clips from their many performances on the ""teen"" shows of the day, including many from Ed Sullivan and the home movies the guys took while on tour in the US were incredibly revealing, not only the views they give us of the world from the eyes of a rock star, but how America looked back in the mid 60s.

All the live clips are lip sync'd, because how else would that WALL OF SOUND be duplicated on stage without a dozen musicians. Other than that, a decent overview of the DC5 legacy. However, be warned: the entire last 45 minutes of this documentary is devoted to some long-forgotten and failed Dave Clark solo project that was long on ambition and short on delivery. Dave Clark, incidentally, had a very strong hand in this project, so he comes away smelling like a rose. Not a very objective presentation, if you ask me.

P.S. Hey, Dave -- how about putting out ALL of the original DC5 albums on CD? Three of your bandmates who have now passed could've really used that income throughout the past 3 decades. At least help out their families and satisfy your fan base.",1430956800,6,856,4.509677419354839

6300296,5,B00IVLRC88,"My favorite recording artist is The Dave Clark Five.  I watched with great interest the PBS show ""Dave Clark Five & Beyond"" as it was broadcast the evening of April 8, 2014.  I later learned it was available as a two disc set and ordered from PBS on the 15th.  And on December 31st I purchased it again on sale from Amazon for $15 or about $10 less than the upfront April release date price of $25.49 from PBS.  The DC5 is my favorite group and I do not mind owning two copies of the blu-ray set.  Disc 1 is the same as the broadcast show and has plenty of famous artists, stars, singers, experts, and even just plain fans talking about and praising the group.  Great to listen to and watch.  Disc 2 has several great live performances in super color and good sound.  For example, the song and video ""Sitting Here Baby"" I had not seen since it was performed live on the old Ed Sullivan Show in 1966.  I saw it way back then on a b/w tv and now with the blu-ray the color and sound is fantastic.  Half of disc 2 is interviews and highlights of ""Time the Musical"" which is very interesting since I knew very little about it when it came out back in April 1986.  The information on The Five and the live recordings and performances are the most enjoyable portions of disc 2.  You have a great performance of ""Nineteen Days"" (which incidentally was the A side of ""Sitting Here Baby"") and the performance of ""Georgia"" at a Royal Command Show later on in 1966.  Both of these songs are here in great sound (albeit in b/w).  You have the Hits in Action film shown complete and available on this disc for the first time since being released in theaters in 1966.  You have several more live videos of some of their biggest hits on disc 2.  I set my Yamaha receiver and the disc for DTS sound and with the color of most of the material on disc 2 you have a great show to watch again and again.  I do not know of any person who would not enjoy this blu-ray 2 disc set.  If you have a blu-ray player always purchase blu-ray discs.  It makes a big difference.  The Dave Clark Five could play just about any kind of music.  This set is recommended to buy and play and keep and play again!",1423008000,,2174,4.190361445783132

However, in the iron fist of the man who masterminded the Dave Clark Five and tightly controlled their every business initiative then and ever since, Dave Clark himself, this film is a thoroughly and transparently cringeworthy and preposterous attempt to claim that the DC5 were in the same league as the Beatles. Dave, they were not, never were, never will be, just accept it. And if I see and hear the same clips of the band playing the same songs over and over and over again, and Tom Hanks exclaiming, like a lovesick teenybopper at the group' s Rock'n'Roll Hall of Fame induction, ""And the name of the place is...I like it like that"" one more time than the seeming million times in the film I will SCREAM - and not like a teenage girl in love with the Dave Clark Five.",1422662400,5,990,4.445054945054945

How many times am I going to watch Springsteen gushing about the greatness (which I agree with) of a song and then there is only a snippet of the one of the 18 times they appeared on Ed Sullivan.

6300316,2,B00IVLRC88,"Man, does this thing go on and on.  Nearly 4 hours of my life.  Overall impression after taking it all in is that the Dave Clark Five recorded 5 songs.  I know it's more than that, but after the one-hour mark they all start to meld together into a single amorphous blob.  This is a group best taken in small doses, with a liberal sprinkling of other groups thrown into the mix.  AM radio was their ideal format.

There's a reason the average guy on the street doesn't think 'Dave Clark Five' when asked about great groups of the 60s.  At some point well into the program the Beatles' music and image float briefly across the screen, and it's like walking out of a noisy factory and hearing bluebirds sing.  The DC5's one-dimensional sound kind of pummels you into submission.

But I'll watch anything about rock music in the 60s.  I did learn a lot about them, like their individual names and who played which instrument.  They had an organ and a sax player, which made them different.  They had a unique sound.  This documentary tries to make the case that the DC5 are one of the ""Big 3"" English groups of the 60s, along with the Beatles and Stones.  Brief TV show clips interspersed with loads of famous talking heads (Stevie Wonder, Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, Elton John) singing their praises.  You won't want to spend much time in hour 2 of the first disc, unless you are fascinated by Dave's 1986 stage musical, ""Time"".  It gets almost equal time - I kid you not - to the DC5 portion of the program.  After watching about a half-hour of hype about his musical, it finally dawned on me that Dave Clark himself produced this documentary.  Sure enough, the credits confirmed this.  Only the interview portion with Freddie Mercury wrenched my attention from the crossword puzzle in my lap.

The 2nd disc contained what I was actually praying for after the interminable commercial for his stage play:  Complete-song performances of some DC5 songs...about 5 of them....""Try Too Hard"" is a great, driving pop song that's been just about lost to time.  Nice-looking color TV and film clips that make you kinda wish Dave had given you an entire disc of these, because before you know it - you guessed it - they're back into talking about his musical.  Actual outtakes from the stage musical discussions.  Outtakes?!?!  You mean they had MORE footage than the hour they took up space with on disc one?!?  Yes.

It's more Dave Clark Five than just about anyone needs, but as I understand it, this guy has been pretty stingy about what gets released.  Snatch this up if you love this group, but take breaks.  Small doses are best.",1411862400,8,2632,4.612068965517241

6300320,4,B00IVLRC88,"There's a lot of things to rejoice about in this video anthology of one of the driving forces of the British Invasion.  With Tom Hanks' Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame induction speech acting as a connecting thread this compilation of rousing performances and testimonials from the celebrated to the Average Joes is quite thrilling.  The best observations in my mind came from a gracious Paul McCartney and Whoopi Goldberg.  The reasons I don't give this production the full five star treatment are twofold.  Producer-director Dave Clark gives short shrift to his band mates (Mike Smith, Lenny Davidson, Rick Huxley, and Denis Payton) and we know very little about them.  On the extras disc, though, the late Mike Smith relates an amusing tidbit about the time he met Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin.  Secondly too much time is devoted, forty percent of the film's running time, to Dave Clark's atrocious stage extravaganza ""Time"", a monstrosity only Bialystock and Bloom could love.  Mentioning it as an aside, yes, but devoting so much time to this busted production that Eighties audiences thumbed their collective noses at is ungodly.  This is an example of the famed Clark ego that denied him the respect of his peers and earlier induction into the hallowed halls.

6300337,3,B00IVLRC88,"The clips of the group on stage and on film is what makes this DVD worth the money. All of the footage is in great, high quality both visually and sonically. Had this been a two-hour montage of archival footage, a la ""The Kid's Are Alright,"" there is no doubt that I would've given this a five star rating. However, while I don't doubt that commentators like Whoopi Goldberg and Gene Simmons were fans of the group, the talking heads add nothing to the story and say nothing that couldn't be learned by reading the Dave Clark Five entry on Wikipedia. After you finish this ""documentary,"" I defy any viewer previously unfamiliar with the group to name any of the band members besides Clark himself and Mike Smith. It's entertaining, but far from informative.

Then there is the last half hour or so of the program (the ""And Beyond"" part) which has nothing to do with the group. The few short glimpses we see of the Dave Clark-owned Ready, Steady, Go! programs are fascinating no doubt, but instead of the ""bits and pieces"" we are allowed to see here, why not an entire set of shows on their own DVD's? Clark's ownership of the show's rights is not in any way relevant to the DC5 story, besides of course their appearance on the program. Then there's the whole section of the show about Clark's ""Time: The Musical."" Imagine sitting though a two hour Beatles documentary and the last twenty minutes are dedicated to McCartney's ""Give My Regards To Broad Street."" That's how relevant the musical is to the story.

The best part of this DVD is the second disc in which we get a collection of unedited DC5 performances and ""Hits In Action,"" a collection of greatest hits set to beautifully shot, humorous clips of the band at work, at play, and acting out Monkee's style romps. This alone is worth the money and only could've been enhanced with the addition of the entire DC5 television special instead of the clips we are allowed to see here. All in all, some Dave Clark Five is better than no Dave Clark Five, but this could've been better with the help of outside filmmakers with access to Dave Clark's archives but not his personal touch.",1404691200,4,2136,4.5744125326370755

It IS true that while they wrote some really GREAT songs in their day, they could not adjust to the more sophisticated lyrics of the psychedelic era.

Dave Clark wrote/co-wrote most of the songs which are a tribute to his ability to write rock n roll songs that stand the test of time.

DVD 2 -- extra segments of original material as well as further interviews & etc.

I gave this 4 stars [instead of 5] because I was hoping the ""Hold On"" TV special would've been included on the 2nd DVD, but it isn't.
It DOES however, have the 1986 ""Time"" Rock Opera.....which doesn't really appeal to me [personally] but I DO have a lot of respect for the people who were involved in that project. Also having Ozzy Osbourne [who is a good bloke] use the ""f word"" during the end titles was totally unnecessary to even INCLUDE at all. Also the extensive inserted comments by Tom Hanks gets annoying [Tom, WHY do you poke your nose into everything from the past & act like you ""own"" it, when you weren't even involved?] after a while, but I know Dave couldn't help who was ""presenting"" at the DC5's Music Hall of Fame...........or could he? Alright Dave, please yourself.....
These are just MY OWN opinions anyway......

Other than my ""4 star"" explanation, this was amazing to see & hear most of the records & appearances which I hadn't before. I've been a longtime Beatles fan for ages and even though I heard about the DC5 in the late 1970s [they were a little before my time] I didn't hear any of their songs until the late 1980s on an oldies station. Then I bought a few LPs, 45s and was able to see all the ""READY STEADY GO!"" shows on the Disney Channel in 1989, the ""Get Yourself A College Girl"" film and that was about it.

Too many other bands to ""collect"" what was available [this was BEFORE the internet!] back then so I stopped looking for anything ""DC5"".

This DVD appeared in a search, like out of nowhere recently [for me anyway] so I got it........and it's like getting into the DC5 all over again for me.

6300349,5,B00IVLRC88,"Hello everyone
I thought the Dave Clark Five dvd was great and as a long time fan, I was grateful that Mr. Clark finally released something for us fans as we have been starving for something for too many years. The story was very interesting but I was hoping it would have been solely about the DC5. I also wish people like Lenny Davidson and Bruce Fleming (their photographer) had been a part of this. I was a little disappointed with the second disc as I had hoped a lot more DC5 performances had been included and less of the interviews from the Time era.
Mr. Clark, I hope you are reading this and are sincere in your recent interviews about releasing your music as a possible box set so let me give you some suggestions as to what an average DC5 fan would love to see. If you are going to release a box set, please do it right and let me give you some suggestions. First, find copies of the box sets for Ricky Nelson called The American Dream, or For You which were released by Big Bear. This is the way a box set should be. Lots of cd's and a book that is worth the price of the box alone. The book had lots of pictures and recording dates of every song on the cd's.
Next, The Moody Blues released in 2013, a box set called TImeless FLight. This was in 3 formats. A 2 cd set. A larger 4 cd set. Finally, a massive 17 disc set with a great book. Several of the discs in this were dvd's. I would love to see a massive DC5 set like this, no matter what the cost.
For your music, go back to the beginning with I Knew It All The Time and the rest of the early songs with the list of personnel on the songs and recording dates. Then you can start with the classic DC5 lineup songs. Hopefully we could hear your band's version of Twist And Shout and perhaps other unreleased songs. Take us on an unforgettable journey all the way up to 1970 with this.
Next, we need more dvd's. Do this up right and get Lenny Davidson, Bruce Fleming and possibly your recording engineers in front of the cameras for their memories and to introduce more dvd material. What would I personally love to see? Here goes:
A rerelease of Glad All Over Again which came out in 1993 and was way too short at only 38 minutes. You must release the complete Hold On special and also Live At T.J.'s which had Phil Spector and Sal Mineo on it.
A must have is the complete Ed Sullivan performances with Ed's introductions on them just so we can see that your group made 18 appearances on there.
We would love to see your group on the NME Pollwinner's Concert from 1964. It would be also nice to see lots more of the band's home movies with you and Mr. Davidson narrating them.
We would also love to see the Shindig, Hullabaloo, Dean Martin performances and more DC5 from Ready Steady Go. I don't care if I have to sit through Glad All Over 10 times, we want to see them.
Your final years from 1968-70 need to be seen. I got the dvd sets of This Is Tom Jones. Imagine my disappointment Mr. Clark, when I watched these and one of Tom's shows had the DC5 listed as guests but your performance was cut out and the only thing I have seen from your 2 appearances on Tom's show was the ""time for a commercial break"" clip on your dvd. Mr. Clark, please put out on dvd, your 2 appearances on Tom's show along with Tom's introductions and the John Davidson 1969 show which your band was on. Plus the Beat Club appearances and your final performance on Top Of The Pops in 1970 with Jimmy Saville's introduction.
Any chance of us fans seeing the full color clip of Wild Weekend on the dvd and a complete Try Too Hard film which is always cut in the middle as was shown on the bonus disc of this dvd set?
Finally, what about the first book on the DC5? May I suggest a photo book of Bruce Fleming's photos with commentary by you, Mr. Davidson and Mr. Fleming elaborately done by a wonderful book publisher like Genesis Publications?
This is what an average fan like myself would love to see released by you. Is this too much to ask?

6300350,5,B00IVLRC88,"It has been long over due,but I am glad(all over) that this DVD has finally appeared. History and especially musical history, tends to morph,twist and get re-written in the most fascinating of ways. The British Invasion,and specifically The DC5's place in it,has been so marginalized, they have been almost(and in some quarters) completely forgotten.
Mr. Clark has finally produced this wonderful two disc set and tries to set the record straight. On the first disc we have an approximately two hour documentary,originally shown on PBS in the States,laying out exactly what the group accomplished,highlighted with some wonderful footage from vintage TV shows of the 60s,showing what the group did best....playing. The screams of the fans and the sheer numbers show just what a drawing card this group was in their heyday. While taking us step by step from the beginning of their career through to their eventual break up(strictly voluntary),it is augmented with interviews by the likes of Paul McCartney,Elton John,Sharon Osbourne,Gene Simmons(in full Kiss makeup),Bruce Springsteen and many,many more. We learn,among other things, that Mr. Clark not only personally steered the group (he was very image conscious) but produced them,managed them and obtained a personal plane for them to travel the world in. He also owned their publishing rights and asked for four times the going rate for their music in the beginning,got it and in three years the song masters came back to him. It is amusing to hear folks like McCartney and John say they regret not having done what Dave did,because it would have saved them alot of money in lawsuits,which didn't always yield them satisfactory results.
While some of the material covered might be old hat to the average fan,there are alot of new things that Mr. Clark sheds light on that I was not even aware of. And the videos that you see alone are worth watching it for. They sure brought alot of memories back to me. But as my title says I believe Mr. Clark is trying to cater not only to the old fans,but find a new audience who may not have heard of the group before,or know very little. What better way to get tremendous exposure and reach a new audience,than to have your documentary seen on PBS? Mr. Clark's business savvy comes to the fore once more folks!
The second disc on this set contains many impressive extras,which includes,outtakes,alternate DC5 performances,interviews with participants of the Hold On special,footage from that,the Hits in Action short,their Royal Performance set(singing 19 Days and Georgia-they could REALLY play live and fantastically well!),and a special section on Mr Clarks smash London play success TIME,with interviews with many of the artists involved in the recording of its soundtrack such as Dionne Warwick,Cliff Richards,Stevie Wonder,Julian Lennon,Freddie Mercury,etc,its premier night and an interview with Sir Lawrence Olivier(it played to over a million folks and sold over 12 million records!).The set also includes snippets from the DC5's induction into the Rock n Roll Hall of fame in 2008. If you haven't seen the full speech Mr Clark gave go to You Tube and give it a look see. That was by far the classiest and well spoken speech I have ever heard at that institution. And it was beautifully pre-framed by Tom Hanks.
I hope three things come out of this DVD release A)Musical history is rewritten to reflect the way it really was and the DC5s proper place restored B)We get a new CD release. Not a another greatest hits,but either a release of ALL the groups material,or at least a CD with songs that have not been released up until this point in time. As you listen to the documentary you hear some of the groups instrumental-only songs playing in the background. I thought gosh,I'd settle for just an instrumental album. And C)A book. This DVD proves that there is SO much unwritten and not said/known about the group. A well written book about the group is something that is long overdue and this DVD just screams that point.
In conclusion,this two DVD set is as welcome as pay day. The DC5 have always represented the best of what 60s music had to offer. They were a clean cut,drug free, straight ahead group with a different sound than anyone else's. It is probably what got them sidelined in the history books(they didn't fit the sex,drugs,and rock and roll profile),but it is what got them into my heart(and countless others) where they have stayed ever since. Mr. Clark I salute you and the guys for the countless hours of pure joy and excitement you gave(and still give) this old fan of yours. You are gone but not forgotten by any stretch. Let's hope you can gain some NEW fans with this DVD set.",1400630400,4,4704,4.910804020100502
6300351,5,B00IVLRC88,"I originally saw this documentary on PBS' GREAT PERFORMANCES, and was so impressed with it that I immediately pre-ordered the DVD. The documentary is an excellent history of The Dave Clark Five, with plenty of archival footage, performance clips, and interviews with original DC5 fans, as well as celebrity admirers such as Sir Paul McCartney (I don't know if Dave's fellow drummer Ringo was asked, but he may have declined), Sir Elton John, Bruce Springsteen, Gene Simmons (who should have left the KISS makeup at home - we know who you are, Gene), Dionne Warwick, Stevie Wonder, the late Sir Laurence Olivier, the late Mike Smith, and a few people that I could have done without - Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne, and Caryn Johnson (a.k.a. Whoopi Goldberg).

The documentary on Disc 1 runs a little over 2 hours, about 15 minutes longer than the PBS special. The bonus disc includes six DC5 sections: interview outtakes; unedited performance segments (which are, unfortunately, lip-synced); a segment called ""You Can't Win Them All"" (more interview outtakes); footage from Dave's promo film HOLD ON - IT'S THE DAVE CLARK FIVE; the complete 15-minute promo film HITS IN ACTION (including one segment, set to the song ""Come Home,"" that was rejected by the BBC's TOP OF THE POPS for being too pornographic; it's not even close, not even by '60s standards); and the DC5's unedited Royal Command Performance from 1966. Also included on Disc 2 are several additional segments about Dave Clark's post-Five West End musical, TIME, which is also covered extensively in the main documentary. In addition, the menus have an interesting mashup version of the DC5's first U.S. hit, ""Glad All Over.""

I have an additional request for Dave Clark. Until now, DC5 fans have been short-changed, with only three official releases of the group's music on Compact Disc: 1993's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-History-of-the-Dave-Clark-Five/dp/B000000OCV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The History of the Dave Clark Five</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dave-Clark-Five-Glad-All-Over-Again/dp/B000007Y0H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dave Clark Five/Glad All Over Again</a>, and 2008's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dave-Clark-Five-The-Hits/dp/B0037FCVW0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dave Clark Five The Hits</a>, all of which are out of print. I know most of the catalog is available on iTunes, but most of us older fans don't download. There are also ""gray market"" compilations of his hits with stereo mixes, one of which I purchased from an Amazon Merchant in 2006, but the page is no longer active on the site.  But none of the DC5's original albums have been officially issued on CD, though they have been bootlegged. This needs to be corrected. All 12 of the U.S. Epic albums, and all of the U.K. Columbia Graphophone albums, should be released on CD in their entirety, in both mono and stereo, plus a PAST MASTERS/MONO MASTERS-type compilation of non-LP singles. The Abbey Road remastering team, who has done such a superb job with the Beatles, Lennon, McCartney, and Apple Records remasters, would do equally as well with the DC5. Another good choice would be the Sony Legacy remastering team; perhaps it's time for Dave to forget old grudges and finish his career where it started - on Epic Records (the Columbia Graphophone trademark was transferred from EMI to Sony in 1992). A.J. Reid, Epic's head man, would be overjoyed.

I'd also like to see a CD/DVD release of the Dave Clark musical&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dave-Clark-s-Time-the-Album/dp/B000VKK3E2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dave Clark's Time...the Album</a>. Because the vinyl album was issued in the mid-'80s, when Compact Discs were in their infancy, I don't think that TIME was ever issued on CD; and if a filmed or taped performance of the show exists, a DVD would be great too. From what I saw in the documentary, TIME appears to be very interesting and entertaining.

Five stars for this documentary. Thanks to Dave Clark International Productions for putting it together, and thanks to PBS for making it available.",1400544000,7,4260,5.744849445324881
6300352,4,B00IVLRC88,"I watched and thoroughly enjoyed the recent PBS special on the Dave Clark Five. I even think this could be a decent purchase. I grew up watching and hearing this group, and I remember looking at their performances, and noticing as a 14 year old -that the camera was always centered on Dave Clark as he mouthed along with the lip-synced song. It appeared he was the lead singer of the group. After further digging, we discovered that the keyboard man, Mike Smith was the one with the fantastic ""Dave Clark Five vocals.""  Not Dave Clark. There was even mention back then that Dave Clark did not even play the drums on the hits.  But it appears now that he actually did. And their is no doubt his propulsive drumming placed prominently in the front of the mix, along with the sax and Mike Smiths voice, gave the five a unique energy. Not for a second did I believe they passed the Beatles in popularity in the ""made up by the media"" battle of the bands. Looking at the cover of this DVD is telling. Dave has complete face, while his bandmates have half a face. No one knows,(except the band members, themselves) whether they ever had a problem with Dave Clark seeming to take all the credit for their success. I read that Mike Smith had less than a 100,000 dollars when he died tragically. Is this true? The DVD cover looks suspiciously like the Beatles American debut - Meet the Beatles, but do you think the Fab Four would mind if Ringo's face was fully centered, while John, Paul and George were cropped out with half a face? I don't think so. It really leads you to believe this DC5 was a corporation, not a band of brothers making music trying to make it. But there is no denying the fantastic songs they delivered - all with the voice of Mike Smith (RIP)",1400544000,3,1757,4.403076923076923
6300353,5,B00IVLRC88,"Growing up a child of the 60's, I was fortunate to have an older brother who handed down to me a love of this music. The Dave Clark Five was one of many groups who ""invaded"" America in the aftermath of the Assassination of John F. Kennedy. They, and the Beatles, helped us to forget that horror of losing our President in such a heinous manner. This film also includes 2 hours of extras. It is well written and well produced. Dave Clark is acknowledged by his peers as a genius because he had the foresight to own his masters early on so he would be in control and not the record company. Features interviews with Paul McCartney and the Boss, Bruce Springsteen who along with Little Steven, is a huge fan of DC5 as is Gene Simmons of Kiss who is also interviewed in full makeup.",1400371200,,778,4.299319727891157
6300354,5,B00IVLRC88,"Picked this up early at my local record store (thank goodness I have one of those) and WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW... what a gift! I'm ordering one on amazon.com for my gal.  between the two discs we have over 4 hours of content.  Some of this I have owned on bad bootleg compilations so seeing it in first rate state is a revelation.  After decades of languishing in vaults this is such a treat for any of us baby boomers who remember the DC5.  I don't want to get into political debates like some reviewing this as to Dave Clark's business practices... I'M REVIEWING this product.... and for me the only thing better would be if 4 hours of The Kinks was to be unearthed and put out on BR.... these guys were so essential to the British Invasion , yet as Bruce Springsteen so accurately notes... they were much bigger sounding that the Beatles and the Stones.  Mike Smith's vocals are unique and instantly identifiable yet, when I play DC5 for friends they have NO idea he's British.... you've heard many of their songs on commercials and the radio and likely not even known who you were listening to if you are not a fan.

This is a TREASURE ..... if you are a fan you shall not be disappointed.  This was done right with loads of bonus content.... and deserving of a higher price.

EXTRA NOTE:  I don't like offering up spoilers in my reviews , but in the nearly 2 hours of bonus footage there is a wonderful ""Out Take"" interview with Mike Smith , that is frankly worth the purchase for me alone!!",1399593600,6,1492,4.338129496402877
6300355,3,B00IVLRC88,"Back in the 1960s I really liked the DC5.  I watched this DVD and wondered about the lack of live performances (as opposed to lip synched) - although there are some, and the rather unemotional way the story gets told.  As for Dave Clark's control of material - a few years ago Paul Schaffer organized a tribute to Mike Smith and the DC5, which I saw on PBS.  IT was kind of like the CBS special on the Beatles - other musical artists sharing their love of the music and then doing covers.  It was really well done.  They were going to release a DVD of the show, proceeds to go to help the Smith family.  Then, mysteriously, the DVD was withdrawn due to ""legal reasons"". I wonder if this si some of Dave Clark's control.  As for this DVD - it is still worthy for the nostalgic value - there is nothing else out there, and until I saw this, I never heard Paul McCartney (or any other members of the Beatles, Stones, or the Who for that matter) talk about the DC5 before.",1398988800,6,968,4.2
6300356,4,B00IVLRC88,"I titled my review like I did because the reviews I have read so far are from people who saw the show on PBS. But there is more on this set than just the TV version showing. I bought my set directly from PBS. First I should say that I've always liked the Dave Clark Five. One of the best things about growing up in the 60's was The British Invasion. The first concert I went to was a DC5 concert in Nov. 64. The following year I saw The Rolling Stones (May 65) and then The Beatles (Aug 65). My best memories are from going to these shows, and others, where I lived in the SF Bay Area, CA. I went to see the DC 5 two more times in 66 and 67. In 2003 I saw Mike Smith's Rock Engine twice and meet him in Sacramento after, what I believe was his last concert before his horrible accident a couple of weeks later. So I like this group from the 60's. Because most of their TV appearances are just them pretending to play, when it is really the record, many people think that they couldn't play live. Because DC used a studio drummer on many of his records, many believe that he could not play the drums. Neither is true. I saw them, when they came on they played like they owned the stage, they rocked hard and DC knew how to play his drums. If people want to say different things that's up to them. On stage in the mid-sixties they were just as good as the Beatles and the Stones. The last time I saw the DC5 was at the Circle Star Theater in San Carlos. That place was built for sound and concerts, with a stage in the middle, in those early days before sound systems were very good in the bigger buildings. Anyway what's on the 2 discs?

Disc 1 - This first disc is very much like the TV presentation. I timed the TV show at about 1 hour 54 min. The disc is about 2 hours and 4 min. So about 10 extra mins. What is added? I suspect little bits here and there. I pretty sure I saw one TV clip that I didn't see on the TV version.  The first hour and one half is great for me. Yes I agree with others that say there is too much talking from Paul McCartney and others such as Ozzy Osbourne. But the show moves fast with lots of info. about the DC5 and the great music playing as backround. Yes, it's true that want to see complete TV clips instead of only partial clips but wait for disc 2. The last 30 min. is about Dave's play Time. For me this is a one time viewing. So it's the first 1.5 hours on disc 1 that I will be watching with repeats.

Disc 2 - So here is where it gets interesting. Do we get to see complete TV clips now, and lots of them? Well yes and no. Disc 2 runs about 1 hour 50 min. It is divided into two parts. One part is a little longer than one hour and it is again about Dave's play Time. This is a one time viewing for me. Lots of talking with Laurence Olivier and others. This is a one time viewing for me. Now for the good stuff. The other part is about 46 min. long. It is divided into 6 chapters. The second chapter has complete TV song presentations without anyone talking over them. They are in great visual and audio quality. All lip-synched, all color except the first one. I believe maybe all from Ed Sullivan but can't say for sure. Here they are: I Like It Like That, Catch Us If You Can, Over and Over, At The Scene, Try Too Hard, and Sittin' Here Baby. I wish there were more, but they are good. Another interesting chapter has the complete 15 min. short color film that Dave made for movie theaters called Hits In Action. Again in great quality. It shows the DC5 riding horses, driving cars, basically a lot of running around with the music playing as backround. Nice to have. My favorite chapter is called The Royal Command Performance showing complete live performances of Nineteen Days and Georgia. Wow, great job of Mike singing Georgia and kind of cool seeing Denis playing guitar and harmonizing with Mike on Nineteen Days.

Four stars. If there was more complete TV clips or more live appearances like The Royal Command, this would be a five star rating. But if you like the DC5 music here is a great chance to own something in great quality that can be, at least much of it can be minus the Time material, enjoyed with repeated viewings. Maybe someday Dave will put out a disc with some of the Ready Steady Go performances that he owns with not only the DC5 but also the Beatles and many other stars of the period. I would buy that one in a heartbeat.",1398470400,107,4395,4.112922002328289
6300357,1,B00IVLRC88,"Didn't the adds on TV boast of rare live performances? To this day I have never seen a clip that would give me a hint of what the Dave Clark Five were like in concert. For instance, did they set the stage up for concert performances the same as when they appeared on Ed Sullivan?
Dave Clark rewrote the history of rock 'n' roll by leaving his groups music out of print for so long, in that when there is a show on the subject, the DC5 are seldom mentioned because of inability to obtain the rights to show clips. There are many people who don't even know who the group was for this same reason.",1397520000,18,594,4.129310344827586
6300358,1,B00IVLRC88,"Dave Clark was certainly one of the most brilliant businessmen in the history of rock music.  But he has no interest in having the true story of the Dave Clark 5 told and so in the guise of such a story, he, instead simply demonstrates what an egomaniac he was.  The Dave Clark 5 was the first great ""boy band.""  It was not a real group.  Rather, Dave Clark hired four musicians, rehearsed them for several months and then had them record about 12 great pop singles between 1964 and 1967.  Dave Clark was a better than average drummer and a great record producer, but the only reason he made it as a pop star was that he lucked into Mike Smith, one of the great pop/rock vocalists of the mid-60s who also happened to have a real talent for writing catchy pop songs.  Dave Clark simply put his name on any song written by any other member of the band, and the bulk of the hits were by Mike Smith.

This documentary pretends the DC5 was a real group, similar to the Beatles, the Stones, or the Who.  This is utter nonsense.  Dave paid the other members a salary keeping all meaningful earnings for himself. Indeed, despite the fact that the ""group"" sold millions of records, shortly after Dave ended the group, none of the other members made more than a small percentage of the millions the group's music generated.  (As a result, Mike Smith died with an estate worth perhaps $100,000.  Apparently, however Lenny Davidson and Rick Huxley had successful second careers -- which Dave neglects to mention.) And Dave's control of the masters and publishing rights prevented Mike Smith from making any money because Dave refused to allow any of the group's music to be released for twenty years.

As you watch this movie, and hear the group spoken of as one of the three great British rock groups of the 1960s, consider the fact that the group was not admitted into the Rock n' Roll hall of fame for almost twenty years after they first became eligible.  The reason is two fold: (1) they were not anywhere near as good as the front line groups and (2)  those inside the rock music establishment, must have known that this was not a real group and Dave Clark was the sort of smarmy business man that Traffic was singing about in ""Low Spark of High Heel Boys.""

I was a BIG fan of the DC5's singles in the mid 60s.  And i still listen to a ""greatest hits"" collection on my iPod. They were infectious, high energy pop music.  But to claim, the DC5 were in the same category as the Beatles or Stones is equivalent to claiming that Bon Jovi was in the same echelon as Led Zeppelin. The only thing that this movie gets right is that Mike Smith never got his due as a great rock vocalist. (It must be mentioned that when Mike Smith toured in the years before his tragic accident, Dave Clark threatened to sue if Mike Smith mentioned the DC5 in any advertisements for Mike's performances.)

Perhaps someday, someone will be able to pull Mike Smith's legacy out from the clutches of Dave Clark.  It is worth noting one of the cruelest aspects of this saga is that the DC5 was actually to be admitted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame a year earlier, but the group's induction was postponed.  Mike Smith passed away just days before the ceremony and so did not live to see himself properly lionized.

Dave Clark has much to be proud of, but the fact that he was not willing to have this film made independently demonstrates his fear of what the truth would reveal about him.  I wasn't surprised that one of the great schlockmeisters of all time, Gene Simmons in full Kiss make up, was one of the featured talking heads.  What confused me was the willingness of Bruce Springsteen and Steve Van Zandt to sing Dave Clark's praises.  It was troubling to hear one of the major rock figures known for his utter integrity celebrate one who was lacking in that quality. One hint was that it was evident that the Boss was unaware that Dave Clark had little, if anything, to do with the writing of the group's great songs.

Perhaps one day, Dave Clark will allow a dvd of the DC5's live performances to be released.  That is what the other four deserve and what will allow the group's fans to enjoy the true legacy: an hour of amazing pop music.",1397520000,105,4218,4.431347150259067
6300359,3,B00IVLRC88,"Dave Clark is his own worst enemy. He held on to all of that great music like Gollum clutches his ring. Ironically, he could have made more money if he released more CD's. More fans could enjoy the music, and a younger generation might have become familiar with their work. The fact is, Mike Smith was the talent. Clark was an average drummer, but a shrewd business man. The same kind of thing existed in the Spencer Davis Group, where Stevie Winwood was the real talent. I only noticed one actual ""live"" performance-  ""Georgia On My Mind"", where again, Mike Smith shines. The rest was nothing to rave about. It seems that Dave Clark and Tom Hanks are his biggest fans.",1397433600,15,669,4.528925619834711
6300360,5,B00IVLRC88,"The PBS  documentary was terrific and revelatory.

The Royal Command Performance clips were live...real live no lip syncing. Hopefully this disk will have more songs from this performance. In 50 years I have never seen a real live clip of the band actually playing live. Plus the clip of Dave banging away live on the Big Bash Drum thingy he did up front as a solo during the live shows was great.

Mike Smith should have been a superstar of the first rank with his voice.

The clip of Dave and Freddie Mercury was sad in a way. Did you know Dave was with Freddie as he died?

The Autobiography of Dave will be interesting. Will he use it to come out? How can he not mention it.

Great to see the DC5 getting the attention they deserve.",1397260800,10,736,4.297101449275362
6300361,1,B00IVLRC88,"It is indicative of the film that the cover boasts Clark's full face front and center with the other four half-faced on either side - side men indeed.  Clark was never a great drummer - he was serviceable.  On the other hand Mike Smith was a great singer who goes pretty much unsung here.
  This is a poorly directed film which mostly consists of the band lipsynching merrily away on this or that television show.  I don't think there is one song sung in front of a live audience in any type of concert hall, there are no extended interviews of any kind with any of the sidemen and there is much too much of that well-regarded cultural critic Whoppi Goldberg whose credentials as a music analyst must have passed me by.  She earned the moniker ""Whoppi"" because of her penchant for breaking wind in public.  Knowing this may be the reason she looks like she smells bad.
  But back to Clark, who this botched film is an ode to.  You would think the man would want a few minutes of the time alloted for us to learn what became of the other four after the break up (which somehow did not garner the same press as the Beatles').  He is content to keep them in the shadows wallowing in anonymity.  And the musical he boasts of - ""Time"" - from what we see of it, and mercifully is is relatively short - it is a howler with Olivier reduced to a sculpted head murmuring platitudes a four year old would find embarassing.  One needn't wonder why it never made it to the States - it would have drowned in the ocean by its own grandiosity and gaudiness.
  One of the many problems this dud boasts is its inclusion of clips of the Beatles which is analogous to watching a documentary of Milli Vanilli with clips of Michael jackson thrown in - one wants to hit the stop button and load in ""A Hard Day's Night"" - one wishes the four moptops could spend more time on the screen.  (Note:  Why didn't the Beatles use Goldberg for their anthology?  Well, too late now!)
  I'd pass this by as it will not make most people glad all over and will make you wonder why Clark liked it like this.",1397260800,24,2070,4.286082474226804
6300362,3,B00IVLRC88,"This is a compelling program if for no other reason than the sad reality that the Dave Clark Five have been out of the public's eyes and ears for far too long. Unlike other '60s British rock ensembles, they have not been seen on Ed Sullivan Show retrospectives or other music retrospectives the past 3-4 decades and with extremely few and far between CD releases, awareness has shrunk over the years and the Dave Clark Five's music is rarely heard anymore.

Unfortunately it is a fact that Dave Clark has sat on the group's albums and rare recordings for decades instead of putting them out on proper CDs and boxed sets. iTunes is fine for the masses but the compressed audio certainly not as good as WAV files on CD so hopefully this long-overdue documentary will signal a more open-minded attitude on Clark who has kept footage of the group from the airwaves for years as well, so much so that on top of virtually no CDs, many people have forgotten about the great group and younger folk have no idea.

This documentary is stuffed with mostly older interviews but at least gives a gasp of the greatness this group offered alongside the Beatles before the DC5 disappeared from the public consciousness unnecessarily due to Mr. Clark's misguided business approach of near total withdrawal of their important and impressive body of work.",1397174400,65,1336,4.754310344827586

I wouldn't (CATCH IT IF YOU CAN), Now I wish they would never (COME HOME)! In fact I don't ever think they will ever be (AT THE SCENE), I just don't (LIKE IT LIKE THAT)! I saw it on PBS, and thought it SUCKED! They would get to something of interest and then on to something else! Pieces of songs, where they should have given you the full performance! Believe me I love the group, not this DVD!  I would not buy it if the price came down to $2.00. Dave Clark won't release his albums! Why?  At this pace we'll all be dead by the time they come out!  Do you think the younger generation will by them?  Dave's Clark's ego is as big as his head, and that is pretty darn big these days! It just SUCKED! ( MIKE SMITH WAS THE DAVE CLARK FIVE, NOT DAVE CLARK, REST IN PEACE MIKE!)

P.S. Did anyone notice that Dave Clark's face is beginning to look like a Hamster!",1397088000,25,984,4.157894736842105
6300364,5,B00IVLRC88,"Like the others I saw this PBS show last night.  It reminded me of why the DC5 were my second favorite group behind the Beatles.  Unlike the Beatles however I had a HUGE teenage crush on Dave Clark. God the man was georgous!! Watching this has given me the incentive to rummage and look for all of the original vinyl albums I have of them.  I'll end by saying I really enjoyed the comments especially from Gene Simmons.  Who knew he was such a fan?  And yes, Mike Smith never received the recognition he deserved for having such a great voice.  Too bad he is no longer with us.  Great show.",1397001600,14,590,4.261261261261262

INTERESTING BACKGROUND & HIGHLY ENTERTAINING TOO.
The Dave Clark Five was a very special band...  and Mike Smith was one of the best vocalists in all of R&R.
Dave Clark is not only a renown drummer... but is also an astute businessman... and a creative genius.
Thus, I strongly recommend this 2-disc video to anyone who likes great rock 'n roll.",1515715200,,380,4.656716417910448
