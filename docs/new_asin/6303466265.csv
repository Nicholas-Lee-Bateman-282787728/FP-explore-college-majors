7847968,4,6303466265,"This is a review for the two VHS video cassette set starring Gene Autry
in OH, SUSANNA! (1936) and THE OLD BARN DANCE (1938).  Both titles are
""B"" western films loaded with music appropriate from the period.

In OH, SUSANNA! (1936) dby Joseph Kane Gene is robbed on a train and losses his identity. Turns out that Outlaw Wolf Benson assumes radio star Autry's identity while Gene winds up in jail as Wolf Benson. Gene eventually sings his way out of the hoosegow and gets to work catching up with Wolf Benson and his outlaw gang. Very entertaining early Autry effort. With Smiley Burnette , The Light Crust Doughboys, Earle Hodgins, Francis Grant, Donald Kirke.

And in THE OLD BARN DANCE (1938) dby Joseph Kane  horsetrader Gene goes on the radio and is eventually blamed for the sponser's dishonesty.  Ironically the sponsor of the radio program is the tractor company Gene and his horsetading pals have been competing with. Another very entertaining entry in the early Autry filmography. With Smiley Burnette, Walt Shrum and his Colorado Hillbillies and Dick Weston (Roy Rogers).

These two films are both quite lively and chock full of western music from the thirties including, in OH, SUSANNA!,  a generously lengthy appearance by The Light Crust Doughboys who were soon to become Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys.
I give this ""B"" western VHS two tape set Four Stars.",1283904000,,1372,4.8626609442060085
