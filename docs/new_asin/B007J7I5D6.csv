5090842,5,B007J7I5D6,"If you're new to the BBC's Horrible Histories series, this is a great place to start. These are some of the best songs (music videos) they've done, and worth watching over and over again (as I do).  Not only are the songs entertaining, they teach real history in a humorous way. The Viking Song and Boudicca are two of my favorites from this series' songs.  Mathew Baynton, Jim Howick, Martha Howe-Douglas, Simon Farnaby, Ben Willbond, Laurence Rickard and the rest of the cast really take the biscuit!",1344124800,2,502,4.758620689655173
5090843,5,B007J7I5D6,"I'd give this six stars if I could.  For those unfamiliar with it, Horrible Histories is a comedy sketch show which explores the vile side of history with plenty of gore, poo and wee thrown in (often literally).  It's ostensibly aimed at children, but it's even funnier for adults.  Most of it's true, as unbelievable as it may seem, and the host, a talking rat puppet with his own sense of humour, is always on hand to point out what's not.

The show is divided into segments based on different historical periods - like Groovy Greeks, Measly Middle Ages and Vile Victorians - and has a combination of actors, short animations and quizzes.  The show is British, so a lot of the material is focused there, but it goes further afield as well.  The sketches are frequently based on things you might see on TV, such as news reports, reality TV shows and advertisements, and there's a song in each episode.  Though the material covered can be truly vile, the show's so light-hearted, and the actors have such talent and charm, that you laugh even when you're wincing (or trying not to throw up!).

As good as Series 1 was, Series 2 is even better.  The writers and actors have really got into their stride and constant hilarity is the result.  Special mention should also be made of the child actors, because they really do add a lot to the show.  New segments in this series include Awesome USA, Historical Fashion Fix, Incredible Incas, Scary Stories with Vincenzo Larfoff, and Cliff Whiteley: historical PR agent (wallop!).  Thankfully, old favourites, like Bob Hale's news reports and Stupid Deaths, are still around.

There's one comedy gem after another in this 13-episode series, and some of my favourites are:
1) Joan of Arc being called by the Archangel Michael to liberate France
2) HHTV Sport. Pinching matches.  Who knew?
3) The Caveman Workout
4) Incan advertisements - NEW Inca hole, Llama Farmer, the Incan Family Players and Historical Shopping Channel
5) NEW Georgian instant messaging service - the fan!
6) Emperor Elagabalus.  Pranktastic!
7) Movie trailers: Love You To Death, Fawkes' Thirteen, The Farm
8) Scary Stories. A SHAVED BEAR! ...  What?!

But supreme in this series are the songs.  Really, I'd buy the DVD for the songs alone, they are that good.  The jaunty ""Real-life Cowboys?"" The music-hall patter of ""Victorian Inventions""?  The Gilbert-and-Sullivanesque ""Blackbeard""?  The grisly cheerfulness of ""Pachacuti""?  The soft-metal Viking  song ""Literally""?  The absolutely insane ""Spartan High School Musical""?  All brilliant.  But for my favourite, it's a tie between ""Boudica"" and ""Charles the Second: King of Bling"".  Love them!

And for a game to play with your kids, try ""spot the prop"", because there are plenty that crop up in scene after scene.  My personal favourite is the pie dish.

""Let's distract ourselves with cake.""",1339027200,3,2858,4.94327731092437

5090846,5,B007J7I5D6,We absolutely love Horrible Histories. The Amazon download is really the best option for those of us across the pond in the US. We homeschool in our family and got started with HH as a history supplement. The skits are hilarious and the writers have done a great job with their history research compared to other programs. It's impossible to have every fact 100% correct for any venue but HH does do a better job than most programs on the history channel and actually holds a child's interest. My daughter asks to watch the videos for fun outside of school work.,1414627200,2,562,4.574257425742574
5090847,5,B007J7I5D6,"These episodes consist of comedy skits based upon Terry Deary's ""Horrible History"" books. Strange and bizarre, but wholly true, incidents and customs from the past are the basis of the humor.  The skits are well done and humorous. My favorites are the ""Stupid Deaths"" skits.",1412640000,,274,5.088888888888889

5090851,5,B007J7I5D6,"My 4th and 6th grader girls love Horrible Histories. They often go back and rewatch the songs like ""Spartan High School Musical"" and of course, ""Do the Pachacuti"" (which will stay in your head for DAYS).  So now they can name all the English Monarchs, know Viking and Greek history, but can't name the American Presidents. Sigh. Oh well, if only the USA would get together brilliant sketch comedy that teaches down and dirty history as well as this series.",1389657600,3,456,4.7
5090852,5,B007J7I5D6,My Student's love it! It presents History in an hysterical way that is a great hook to the start of any lesson.,1387324800,,111,4.090909090909091
5090853,3,B007J7I5D6,"I got hooked on Horrible Histories via YouTube, so I thought, hey, let's buy the series and see them all in order!

OK, some of these skits are outrageously funny.  Unfortunately, some are not.  There's a rather heavy tendency still toward poo and pee jokes, which the writers seem to consider the most hilarious part of history.  There is also a tendency to assume that anything that seems ""odd"" must also be ""stupid"" - which isn't always the case and can be misleading.

If you want to see the skits in order, start here, NOT with Season 1, which was pretty dreadful.  But if you just want to laugh out loud, honestly, you'd do better just skipping through the bits on YouTube, where one tends to find ""the best off"" rather than the intervening dreck.",1361145600,,753,4.54074074074074
