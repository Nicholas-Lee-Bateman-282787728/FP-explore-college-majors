7870624,5,6304409079,"Golf My Way II states that it ""lowers scores through better course  management"".  It contains 8 major categories, each of which contain  about 7 lessons.  It is the complete package.  (Golf My Way I, contained  the basics to which Mr. Leugers evaluation seems to relate.)  Both videos  provide 1) excellent advice for beginners and 2) good refreshers for  experianced golfers.  Try it, you'll like it.",968457600,,401,5.030769230769231
7870625,4,6304409079,"I thought this video was great!!!  I have played golf for over 20 years  now, and I get tired of these pro's making the golf swing sound so  complicated!!!  Jack shows us how simple the golf swing really is, and how  we can get that evasive repeatable swing and take it to the course NOW!",965520000,,288,4.163636363636364
7870626,2,6304409079,"Jack's golf my way video was really boring. i mean it put me to sleep. The video showed too many angles, and was put together in such a way that did not add much interest to the film. the video, however, did show how to hit  the ball and the correctangles that are necessary for proper ball contact.  overall, i was not too impressed with this one",948672000,,347,4.164179104477612
