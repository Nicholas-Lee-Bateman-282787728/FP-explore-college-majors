6506218,4,B00LTTUE70,"The show is awesome mixing classic Santana with the new album, Corazn. The new songs have a lot more energy live then then on the album and the band kills the classics. Outstanding jams on Jingo, Black Magic Woman, Oye Como Va. Samba Pa Ti & Soul Sacrifice. The new songs that stand out to me are Iron Lion Zion, La Flaca, Besos De Lejos & Saideira. Greta buy & a great gift. I got one for my Dad too!

I notice they do not list all of the tracks. I pulled this from the Santana website.

6506219,3,B00LTTUE70,"The video is great. However, the audio part of the vocals is not of the great quality that Santana's from other Santana's concerts. I hope they have a better version recorded of the vocals... you can see Carlos asking the engineers to go higher on the MIcs...pointing his thumb up indicating to go higher...",1410652800,2,307,4.703703703703703
6506220,5,B00LTTUE70,"This one is a must have for any fan of Carlos Santana. There are a few guests that aren't my cup of tea, but everything is track marked to easily skip to the next song if you find that to be the case for you. That said, those moments are far and few between.

Seriously, how can you not love Carlos Santana? The guy plays with so much passion, heart, soul and spirit. He was born to make music fans smile and take away the thoughts of a difficult day, and this DVD does exactly that.  This concert was shot in full widescreen 16:9 format and upscales beautifully even without the blu-ray version. Audio quality is superb throughout.

Carlos Santana is one for the ages and this concert is my favorite of all his performances offered on DVD. I LOVE it!",1477008000,2,751,4.3120567375886525

6506237,5,B00LTTUE70,Excellent Concert by Santana! Some of his classic early music and some guests that are great. His band is made up of incredible musicians including a featured woman drummer that just can keep up and surpass many drummers I've seen. 3 great hours of music. Absolutely loved this.,1432425600,2,278,4.8125
6506238,1,B00LTTUE70,"Watching a parade of Santana collaborators perform puerile pop on this lamentable 2014 blu ray concert is like watching paint dry compared to the compelling Santana performances of the 70s, 80s and 90s. There is nothing remotely redeemable about this, no hooks, groove or inspired performance - just the insipid work of an automaton wrecking his legacy. I've been loyal to this band over decades but these pathetic post 2000 collaborations with clueless wannabe pop singers test the limits of endurance. Sad to say I've had enough.",1431388800,7,531,5.114942528735632
