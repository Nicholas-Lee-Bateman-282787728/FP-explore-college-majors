8593484,4,B00DI68AKU,"I chanced upon this as I was browsing. I'd never heard of it but a View Askew film starring Jason Lee & Jay Mewes? I'm in!
It's an interesting story of a slacker who drags his friends into the woods on the hunt for Sasquatch so, imagine Clerks in the woods. Jason Lee is particularly good and the supporting cast, for the most part, do a decent job as well.
I'll say this film isn't for everyone. It's a first time feature and has its flaws but, overall, it's well done and deserves a watch. Watch for other View Askew regulars as the film progresses; including Scott Mosier in the role that may or may not define his career! I'd hope not...",1507766400,,641,4.262295081967213
8593485,5,B00DI68AKU,"Damn it! I just love the 1990's and being young. Screw it, I was born in the late 50's for crying out loud but this is the best of both worlds. Jason Lee is searching for Bigfoot and whether he finds Bigfoot or not is inconsequential. I found the film fun and purchased it!  The film is in B&W. You see, what the film does not address is that Big Foot is a 5'7'' insurance agent living in Wisconsin!  But only I know this information and I will never tell anyone!  :-)",1453075200,,468,4.065217391304348
