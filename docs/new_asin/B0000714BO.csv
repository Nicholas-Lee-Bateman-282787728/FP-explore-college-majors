1799774,1,B0000714BO,"This hackneyed excuse for a samurai film is an example of great actors (excluding Frank Converse) needing work. The action sequences are laughable and if you may not have noticed, this is an Arthur Rankin/Jules Bass production, famed American cartoon producers, Frosty the Snowman being one of their most well-known works. Someone should have told them to ""thumpity, thump, thump"" back to Saturday morning fare. This one reeks about as much as the scene where the sailors refuse to take baths. Shogun may have been melodramatic, but there isn't an ounce of drama used here. Buy this one at your own risk. Only thing of value is the plastic box it came in. You can use it for another DVD and the DVD as a frisbee.",1046217600,7,712,4.658730158730159

1799788,1,B0000714BO,"""A swashbuckling Samurai saga that beats SHOGUN!"" - Star-Bulletin

This grand statement must be about the heavily edited 2 hour version of Shogun. The original television miniseries is as much of a revelation compared to that film as eating sushi is to fish sticks from ""The Gorton's Fisherman.""

""The Bushido Blade"" stands as an utterly cheesy film in the genre filled with stiff and stuffy performances despite the star-studded cast, unremarkable and unmemorable visuals, and a rather generic story filled to the gills with clichs.

All you have to do is sit through the first act to realize that you just opened a huge can of worms. The second act doesn't really do much to hold your attention while the third act felt, more or less, like a real letdown.

Sure, the film was supposed to end tragically, in a way, but ""The Last Samurai"" did a much better job at it, even though it had its elements of Westernizing a story that is supposed to be richly Japanese.

Even the Shogun miniseries had this problem of Westernizing, but efforts were made to keep that to a minimum to where the average viewer could experience a respectful depiction of Japanese culture while being able to understand the story (read the original novel if you want more depth of the culture through the eyes of a Westerner). Alas, ""The Bushido Blade"" makes no discernible effort to preserve such an experience; it is so lopsidedly Western that it seems to mock Eastern ideals.

Then again, what more could you expect with this kind of film from the likes of Rankin-Bass?

I KID YOU NOT!

This film was produced by the same group of guys who also brought you the famous stop-motion ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" from the 1960s and the animated ""Thundercats"" from the 1980s!  Even the music is Rankin-Bass fare, being composed by none other than Maury Laws!

This film made one thing utterly clear: Arthur Rankin, Jr., who served as producer, should have stuck with making children's fare.

Rankin-Bass did a better job of bring Yukon Cornelius to life in stop-motion than Commodore Matthew Perry in live action (ironic, considering that Richard Boone, the actor to play the part, succumbed to lung cancer shortly after the film was made).",1191888000,2,2215,4.8179419525065965
1799789,1,B0000714BO,"This is the single most entertaining and moving film I can recall seeing in recent years.  This film was unbelievably pathetic on so many levels, ie:  historical accuracy, writing, acting, plot, theme,etc., I can't begin to comment.  It was entertaining in the sense we were throwing things at OUR screen while correcting all the inaccuracies, poor writing and just plain bad acting.  I was moved through a variety of emotions while watching this film, including, anger, disgust, nausea, and shock.  No mortal is perfect and we all have to eat but how they EVER got the great Toshiro Mifune involved in this film (and role) has to be the ultimate cinematic mystery of our time.  My words may sound ""..spiteful.."" but they are as true and accurate as I can make them about this embarrassment of an  American film.",1134259200,4,812,4.798561151079137
1799790,2,B0000714BO,"In support of the previous reviewer's comments, those writers who sneer at the very idea that a western sabreur could triumph over a Samurai are being sadly and deludedly unpatriotic (not a quality usually associated with Americans, let it be said).

In fact, there are a number of accounts dating from this period of Samurai being embarrassed by the skill of western opponents - and some of these are Japanese accounts.  One may speculate that it was simple culture-shock, but it remains true all the same.

As for the film, it's no great shakes, but the fight is credited to a Japanese fight director, and if this is the case he deserves brownie points for a decent bit of difficult choreography.",1119657600,,698,4.75206611570248
1799791,2,B0000714BO,"The meeting between Commodore Perry's flotilla, and the Japanese has always been one of the most fascinating events of history, as far as I am concerned.  It really is a pity that it is something that has never been done well on film.  This film is no exception.  The first official contact between the United States and Japan is used here as a setting for a pulp adventure story.  If you keep this in mind, and don't do into this with overly high expectations, this is a reasonably enjoyable picture.  It's an adventure film, nothing more.  But anyone who expects high art or historical accuracy is sure to be disappointed.  I do wish, though, that someone would make a historically accurate film about this pivotal and fascinating historical event.  It's a pity this film isn't that movie, since Richard Boone does make a good Commodore Perry.

I must say a word, however, to those who sneer at the very idea that an American military officer of the 19th century could even hope to be a match for a samurai in swordsmanship.  The idea is not as farfetched as you might imagine.  In the first place, not all Western swords are the inferior trash imagined.  Nor are katanas lightsabers.  Some 19th century Western swords were mass produced blades of indifferent quality.  Others were very well made weapons of very fine steel (and usually less brittle and prone to chipping than Japanese swords, even if they wouldn't hold an edge so well as a superbly made katana).  Not every samurai's sword was a Masamune masterpiece.  The Japanese, even in the feudal period, were no strangers to mass produced, lesser quality blades.  Nor was every samurai a master swordsman (any more than every Wild West cowboy was an expert gunfighter).  One must remember that for the samurai, the sword was only one of three major weapons, along with the bow, and the yari (a thrusting spear) -- and was in fact, the least of the three.  In fact, the sword really did not even become the premier weapon of samurai culture and reach its cult status until the mid to late 17th century when the period of civil wars ended.  It is instructive to note that the expression so associated with bushido is ""the Way of the horse and bow"", not ""the Way of the sword.""  By the same token, Western military officers could also be master swordsmen.  The sword had almost reached the very end of its use as a military weapon in the Western world, but it was not quite dead yet, and there were still a number of schools that instructed students in its use at that time.  Nor are Western styles of swordsmanship so vastly inferior to the style of swordsmanship practiced in Japan -- quite the contrary: modern students of Western military saber fencing often do quite well sparring against students of the katana.  The military saber was a superb weapon, with a very effective, very well developed style.  British officers used it quite effectively in India and Afghanistan, for example, where there were well-established warrior cultures using effective sword styles of their own.  They would not have done so if the science of Western saber fencing was not very effective in its own right.  In general, the average samurai of the 19th century WAS indeed a bit more likely to have studied swordsmanship and be a master swordsman than the average Western military officer.  But there absolutely WERE Western military officers who studied saber fencing extensively and were expert swordsmen, so the idea that an American officer of that period couldn't possibly possess a level of skill with a blade equal to that of a 19th century samurai is not at all accurate either.  Those who dismiss the western martial arts so blithely are usually those who know nothing about them.",1117756800,3,3733,4.753105590062112
1799792,1,B0000714BO,"I am a big fan of samurai films and Japanese cinema.  Toshiro Mifune is my favorite actor.  I own about sixty or so samurai and/or mifune movies.  With that said, I purchased Bushido Blade in hopes that it would be tolerable.  I was sadly mistaken.  Don't let your curiousity get the better of you and your money.  The plot is missing, the acting is terrible (except for Mifune, who speaks English in this film without understanding the language, yet he is dubbed anyway), and the quality is unbearable.  In one part, a US naval officer beats a samurai in a sword fight.  Give me a break!",1112486400,4,588,4.481132075471698
1799793,1,B0000714BO,"Simply put, this film is garbage.  I rented it because I love samurai films.  I saw that the cast included the great Toshiro Mifune, and assumed that it had to have some worth.  Boy was I wrong!!!

Incredibly American ego-centric poo-poo.  The film's main character is an American marine who is working with Admiral Perry.  In order to seal the treaty between America and Japan, a sacred blade was to be given to America as a gift of allegiance from Japan.  The Bushido Blade is quickly stolen so that the deal cannot be completed.  Although the Americans fail to see the importance of such a gift, they send the marine to retrieve it from the evil samurai who had stolen it.  Constantly insulting the Japanese for holding a mere object in such high regard, the film shows its small mindedness and lack of appreciciation for Japan's culture and the high art of sword making.  The story goes on with the typical plot twists and some disgustingly unrealistic battles.  Namely a fight between the American marine and the best swordsman of a lethal Samurai clan.  Of course the American wins.  That should give you a pretty good clue about his movie.
!!!STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS!!!  Don't even rent this piece of crap.  It will sap the intelligence straight out of you brain and rob you of 100 minutes that you can never have back.  If there's one thing in my life I regret, it is watching this idiotic film.",1086912000,4,1402,4.570281124497992

7973892,3,B0000714BO,"I saw this film on cable in the 1980s. It interested the historian side of me, but was never shown again. So when Amazon featured it, I bought it to see a bit more and evaluate its historical accuracy. The product arrived in short order in good condition.
 In 1854 President Pierce sent Commodore Matthew Perry and the US Navy Pacific battle squadron to Japan to force a trade agreement treaty to open Japan to the modern world. Forced to bow to superior, friendly(?) military threats, Japan conceded and open her ports to world shipping. The leaders of Japan were gracious on the surface, but lost much face internally and vowed to modernize so as to never allow such to happen to their nation again. Within eighty years they had caught-up over four hundred years of developments and saw the advantages to being a powerful nation and use imperialism for their own expansion and success, leading to WWII!  Hmmm, perhaps not the best move by the Western nations of the world in retrospect...
 OK, there's the history lesson. The film covers that. The fictional story is of a Samurai Blade to be presented to the Americans as a symbolic offering in peace....it is stolen by a Japanese warlord who does not wish the opening of Japan to alter his stand and power. A joint American team of two sailors under command of a USMC officer ( bet that would work out well..) that teams up with a Samurai warrior prince to recover the blade and save face for all. Within a day, the team is broken up and separated as they venture into Japan ""unofficially"". The sailor are captured by the evil Japanese warlord backers but escape to be helped by the loyal Japanese peasants. The gyrene captain winds up being saved by the good samurai Prince and his half -American female  cousin...the story explains how she is...the girls(a peasant babe enters the story to help the sailors, of course) are here for romantic moments as well as assist in the fighting. The story becomes a ninja/samurai warrior slash and dash epic, with a few Americans thrown in....you can get this to see how it ends, and how face is saved...or is it? You'll have to be the judge on that one.
 The film was one of those that was once made for the drive- in theaters type..only by 1979, they were being made for cable! A joint American/Japanese effort by Toho Studios, the model work shows that. Filmed on location in Japan. Lots of stars of past greatness, TV screens, and a few future greats yet to come. Richard Boone in his last film. Toshiro Mifune in his middle career, and James Earl Jones in his second screen appearance, a year after he voiced Darth Vader in Star Wars; but only for two scenes and less than five minutes total time. 60s TV actor Frank Converse is the Marine officer. And Laura Gemser is the mixed race female samurai; her role apparently feminized so as to allow a topless scene with the marine as this film was made at the dawn of allowing nudity in films whether it advances the plot or not! (There's also a fight in a public bath house that tears down the wall between the men and women's sides of the building...lots of naked Japanese gals flash by! That advanced the plot too....Sure It Does!)
 Well, now I know why it wasn't on cable too often...and usually after 3 AM! It's a historical, ninja/samurai, skinimax costume drama! And I saw an error in the costumes....the Marine Corps officer does NOT have braided ropes on the crown of his service hat....and with this story set in the age of sail, that's a big error.

I have always been a Toshira Mifune fan and he does the best with this aweful script.  Richard Boone is in his ""worst"" role.  He mugs and stamps all over the set... and that is about it.  A young James Earl Jones has a small part which is equally unenspiring.

This being his last film, made me curious about the film. He part is fairly brief, but convincing.  Frank Converse as the Marine who goes inland to retrieve the sword, keeps the story going with lots of action, along with Sonny Shiba, is a good blend of characters. The big sailor, who stumbles into some sumu wrestlers, is hilarious. Keeping an eye on his nephew also adds to the story. I first saw this film back in 1980 on Cinemax, I have the VHS tape. I have watched it several times. What's a movie without a little malarkey. It's just fun to watch.",1319587200,,680,4.354330708661418
7973897,3,B0000714BO,"What attracted me to this movie in the first place was the chance to see my two favorite Japanese actors on the screen together, sadly Mifune and Chiba only have one brief scene together. So this leaves the rest of the film to stand on it's own, and I must admit, I was suprised that it turned out to be an enjoyable piece of entertainment, but nothing more. The important thing to remember here is that this is an American movie, not a Japanese film, so you can't compare it to the great Samurai films of Kurosawa or Hiroshi, and disapointingly, Mifune is not the star, and dose not partake in any of the sword play or battles. What we do have is an entertaining attempt by westerners to make a samurai movie with truely mixed results, too many westerners in swordplay when what we really want is samurai on samurai action, but the cast dose have a showstopping scene-stealing appearance by James Earl Jones. Sonny Chiba, who has a slightly larger role than Mifune, dose get a little bit of swordplay in towards the end of the movie. Frank Converse as the film's main hero, is just okay, but Richard Boone is in here in his last role. So, it's safe to say that the cast is what makes this movie, love it or hate it, or just enjoyed it, as I did, the cast can't be denyied it's brillance. It is important as Mifune and Chiba's only film together, sorta like John Wayne and Clint Eastwood being together for us westerners, still in many ways a weak movie. It wants to be James Clavell's SHOGUN, and is in some ways similar to Ed Zwick's THE LAST SAMURAI, years later, but not as classy or as well put together as those ones. Ultimately, I would say see it if you can, buy it, if the price is right, just remember it's an American movie.",1234224000,3,1735,4.341538461538462
