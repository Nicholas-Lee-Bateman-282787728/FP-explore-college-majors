Davis & Allen spoke to us extras with no problems.  Dash, on the other hand, was a complete snot.  She acted as if she was too good to speak to anybody other than the main cast.  Bumper Wallace was the same.  Unfortunately I was Dash's stand-in as well.  Nobody that was an extra & stand-in wanted to be her stand-in.

Here's how it happened.  There was a casting call and I went to it b/c I was trying to do something with my major-B.F.A Theater Performance.  I thought I was a shoo-in but I didn't get any calls.  About a month later I got a call from Heather Laird and was excited.  I called my job and told them I wasn't going to be in that day. I couldn't sleep.  The next day I was pumped.  A co-worker took me to the set and I proudly gave my name and they didn't even know who I was.  They couldn't even tell me where I was suppose to be.  They directed me to sit in one of the trailers and there I saw Clifton Davis.  I greeted him and he said hello.
After an hour of confusion I was taken to wardrobe and was told to wait in the house they were shooting in.  That's where Debbie & Stacey were.  I talked a bit to Debbie and Stacey just kept her mouth shut.  After that the experience was getting more unpleasant by the minute.  Since this was my first film experience I learned pretty fast that stand-ins & extras get ignored big time.  I was on that set for over 15 hours and all I got paid was $75.  I lost wages and wasn't too happy about that.
After the shooting was done they wanted me to come back the next day.  I told them I couldn't and I had to work.

After I turned them down I realized I probably made a big mistake.  I wondered if I would ever get a chance to do something like that again so I talked to my old supervisor about it.  Sure enough a month later they called me back and I accepted.  If I had known what I was getting myself into I would've said no because the day they were able to use me turned out to be the coldest day of the year.  I had to be an extra for the car accident scene.  It was in the single digits that day and I remember watching the crew set up the accident scene by setting up a flood scene.  Everybody was frozen after that.  Especially the guys fishing out the water.  After that I sat in a better warmer trailer for the rest of the day and that was it.  I didn't see any other stars that whole day and that was the last time I was a stand-in/ extra for anything else.

I never heard anything else about the movie.  I was shocked to see it on Lifetime a few years back.  It didn't look like a good movie but then again I caught it in the middle.

I guess I'll never know how it is.",1379203200,,2773,3.9655172413793105

We are not happy campers at this time.",1333929600,,188,4.194444444444445
