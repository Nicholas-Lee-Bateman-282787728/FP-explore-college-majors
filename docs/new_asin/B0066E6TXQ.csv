8494087,2,B0066E6TXQ,"I found it an overbearing melodramatic bore, not one of George Cukor's best by a long shot. Tracy's anger is too quick and too emphatic. The acting has no subtlety to it. Even Kerr is overly emotional and weepy. I thought I'd seen just about everything Cukor directed and came across this film quite by accident. Tracy seems too detached from his character for my taste. He doesn't sound the least convincing when you look at his other work (such as ""Inherit the Wind""). His objections, the way he treats his wife, his horrible American accent in a cast full of well-spoke Brits rubbed me wrong from the start to the finish. Kerr at times is good and that is why the film received two stars instead just one. Don't waste your time. It's silly and hopelessly a product of an old fashioned period drama. Even Cukor can make a stinker. Hitch did. Wyler did. Ford did. They all did.",1457568000,,878,4.49375
