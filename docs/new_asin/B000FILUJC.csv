These problems could of been avoided by using a second print.  I don't know why these people don't do that, and do it right the first time.  It leaves us still looking for a complete print.  Astounding She-Monster is a good viewing print in full screen, but that is not it's OAR.  Wade Williams apparantly acquired this film and put his WW Prod. title at the start of the film and not before it started , which it where it should be placed.",1355184000,3,691,4.359375
8123140,5,B000FILUJC,"These three sci-fi/horror movies are great!!! Sci-fi/horror 1950s fun! Only people who love these type of movies are going to appreciate and understand them! It's not your usual cup of tea! I give it 5 stars!!! (I would give it ten stars but no such option here!)
Buy the collection!

To the rest... just stick to whatever tickles your fancy!",1318550400,3,342,4.7

8123142,3,B000FILUJC,"Just wanted to throw in a word for this box set to counteract the lone review I read for this set.  You buy a set that includes a movie called Devil Girl From Mars and you're somehow led astray into thinking this is a pinnacle of film art?  C'mon!  The three titles in this set are classics in a certain sense of just watching something fun.  That's the appeal of titles like this.

Before straight to video nightmares began, these little flicks were churned out to make a quick buck admittedly.  But today these films are just fun to watch.  Mesa Of Lost Women?  The title alone screams for a good time in watching.  I just know that there is no way that the other reviewer could have been suckered in to buy this release.  The Wade Williams Collection flicks are B or C grade movies but they are always fun to watch and the prints are spectacular.  Always.  They put classics from this same era look like garbage in comparison.  So kudos to Image and to Wade Williams for putting out these amazing looking films of a bygone age.

Plus look at the value in this set.  Just one of the movies above bought separately costs more than that whole set.  All in all, a good value with some films that don't make you think, don't make you want to change the world, don't make you want to delve any deeper than the cardboard sets the filmmakers used.  Grab some popcorn and enjoy the show!",1280275200,12,1381,4.33203125
8123143,1,B000FILUJC,"These are among the worst movies I have ever stopped watching. Half way through the first movie I thought the garbage can would be a better storage spot than my shelf. Should come with a Yuk label! I only gave the collection one star because that is the lowest, most miserable rating that Amazon allows.",1167782400,9,303,4.527272727272727
