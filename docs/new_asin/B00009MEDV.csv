So ""Twilight in the Sierras"" should delight Roy and Dale's many fans  --- Must recommend the Happy Trails DVD's to you --- Each one has new information about Roy Rogers and Dale Evans and each actor or director in the film --- If you are a Roy Rogers and Dale Evans fan like me you will totally enjoy all the extra footage showing Roy and Dale going to parades and visiting children in hospitals, the story of Roy proposing marriage to Dale, and more inside info also about the family --- Each film starts out with Roy and Dale seated on a small stage back around 1987 talking about the sagebrush films they are showing --- some wonderful tunes, ROOTIN TOOTIN COWBOY FROM THE WEST -- PANCHO'S RANCHO -- IT'S ONE WONDERFUL DAY -- TWLIGHT IN THE SIERRAS.
