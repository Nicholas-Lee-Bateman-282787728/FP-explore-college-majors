839621,5,6304298293,"If you're a connoisseur of awful movies that are unintentionally hilarious, Switchblade Sisters hits the bullseye bigtime.  Ed Wood would have adored this tawdry mix of sex and violence within and between tough high school gangs.  Of course, the gang members are ludicrously played by actors clearly in their mid to late twenties. I can't recommend this movie enough for a Bad Movie Night with your friends.  Everything about it is dreadfully sincere--and sincerely dreadful  The line readings are not-to-be-believed.  At times, it seems as if the actors were filmed seperately and then cut together, their 'styles' are so dramatically different.  Keep your eyes open for the long, lingering reaction shots that make absolutely no sense whatsoever.  Once you clue into the deep awfulness of this movie, you will not stop laughing.  Switchblade Sisters contains what I think is the single worst performed piece of dialog ever committed to film.  I won't give it away here, but look for it just as Dominic is about to walk out on the pregnant Lace.  Whatever you think about Quentin Tarentino, you've got to concede that he recognizes good cheese when he sees it.  His short-lived Rolling Thunder Productions re-released Switchblade Sisters a few years back so that others could appreciate this little-known gem.  Trust Quentin, trust me, and settle down with your own gang of rowdy upstarts and watch Switchblade Sisters. It's hell on wheels!",1026864000,,1441,5.1373390557939915

839839,3,6304298293,"This is a nifty entry into the Grindhouse genre (?) of cinema. It IS everything a drive-in movie should be for the disgruntled youth of the 70s.

Here's the scoop. Robbie Lee (as Lace) leads a pack of tough gals who are the debs of The Silver Daggers, a gang of tough guys. They pick up a new recruit, Maggie (Joanne Nail) and things start to go South. Lace is jealous of Maggie because Maggie has caught the eye of Lace's boyfriend Dominic, head of the Silver Daggers. And The Daggers are being pressed by a rival gang. It's a real pot boiler.

This is a lot of fun. The director, Jack Hill, directed a lot of notable ""B"" pictures in the 60s and 70s and this is pretty typical of his work. Tough girls, tough talk, dyke headmistresses and ineffectual adults are just a few of the things making up this wild romp. Is it great? No. But you can see why Quentin Tarantino dug it up and had it released (albeit under the ""Switchblade Sisters"" title as opposed to the original ""The Jezebels"") It's what comprised these kinds of movies at the time. In it's own way it was very important to cinema in that it was of a genre of films that gave rise to some of the greatest directors of our time. It's fun watching Lace spew all her lines through her teeth. And what about Maggie? Way too waspishly pretty to be the toughie she plays here but there you have it. And a shootout at a roller rink?! Who dreams up stuff like this? And the acting is genuinely decent over all. A lot of these actors went on to have very respectable careers.

This is a good slice of American Cinema History. Don't expect too much from it. Just sit back and let it roll over you. You'll have a good time.",1317081600,,1672,4.235109717868339
839840,4,6304298293,"I've had this old VHS, part of Quentin Tarantino's ""Rolling Thunder"" series of rediscovered & rereleased exploitation films, for probably most of 15 years, and finally got around to watching it tonight. Yes, I sat through Quentin's annoying intro at the beginning and his exit comments as well. Nothing he says about the film isn't on either the IMDb page or on the Wikipedia entries for the film or director/writer Jack Hill, so he can safely be skipped. Most of you reading this will be more likely to have/want the DVD, so check out reviews that mention the DVD extras also - I'm mostly just focusing on the film. In any case, it's no surprise that QT would pimp this late entry from Hill (he only directed one film after this, a 1982 entry into the short-lived barbarian cycle, THE SORCERESS) as it's full of over-the-top dialogue and acting and just has the particular kind of ""coolness"" that Tarantino seems to look for.

In this case, it's hard for me to say whether it's deserved or not. The Jezebels are an all-girl gang that grows out of a mixed boy-girl gang called the Dagger Debs, run by Dominic (Asher Brauner) and his girlfriend Lace (Robbie Lee). Everything seems to be going well, with the Debs owning the high school that they all go to (yep, all underage) - until Maggie (Joanne Nail) comes along. Lace is attracted (not in a lesbian way - don't get your hopes up) to Maggie's tough attitude, much to the chagrin of her best buddie Patch (Monica Gayle, who - surprise surprise - sports a patch over one eye). Patch immediately starts plotting to get rid of Maggie so that she can be Lace's best friend with no competition, but given Dominic's attraction to her, and the fact that she seems to be the most competent member of the gang, that'll be tough.

Vaguely based on the central plot of ""Othello"", but going off in a rather different direction, SWITCHBLADE SISTERS (originally titled THE JEZEBELS) is slipshod filmmaking through and through. Most of the several scenes with gunfights are laughable, with maybe one or two shots seeming to connect and show any blood - either the budget or the stuntwork wouldn't allow for more - the sets are cheap and don't really bear any noticeable resemblance to any real locales that they might be standing in for; I think the film was shot in L.A. but is apparently supposed to take place in New York - it's really impossible to tell though. And the acting - oh my God. I actually think one has to chalk up the incredible over-the-top acting styles of just about every single performer to director Hill - they couldn't ALL be so bad, in exactly the same way. Usually in cheap exploitation flicks of this era there will be a couple of fairly competent actors, several that are really mediocre, and one or two that are horrible - MALIBU HIGH for example has a huge range in acting quality, from people that you could see being in mainstream prestige films to people who couldn't get on the high school play. Here, every single actor is in the latter category with the possible exception of the Iago-esque Monica Gayle. Phrases are never spoken when they can be shouted or screamed, and rare is the bit of dialogue that actually sounds like a human being would speak it.

So it's trashy fun, when it comes down to it. Most of the women are reasonably cute and we get to see a few naked breasts - and a lot of pretty cool low-rent 70s gangwear fashions. Nobody connected with the film seems to have gone on to do much of anything, with the exception of Don Sharp who plays a minor gangmember that leaves 2/3 of the way into the film; he's had a long and successful career as a character actor, focusing lately on TV including a stint as a main character on ""That 70s Show"". Robbie Lee may declaim her lines in just as stilted a manner as anybody else here, but she does have some undeniable charisma and her odd baby-doll voice was to serve her for a while doing voice work for kids' TV animation in the 1980s. Director Hill is best known for this film, SPIDER BABY, and several Pam Grier films in the early 70s; I guess he didn't have anywhere to go after the exploitation boom started to fade away right around the time this film was released. Too bad; as cheesy as this is it has an energy and even in some ways a certain brutal feminist quality that you just don't see in today's cheapo action films.

All in all then, not a ""good"" film by any means - but it's plenty of fun, and it's certainly worth a shot for any fans of 70s exploitation stuff.",1283558400,,4508,4.473876063183475
839841,5,6304298293,"If your a fan of Jack Hill's or are curious to know more about him, this is the DVD to get. I've seen a lot of his movies on DVD and none comes close to being as great as this one.

The movie itself is an amusing, entertaining, and unbelieveable take on Shakespeare's Othello, believe it or not, put into the context of a 70's girl-gang exploitation movie. First and foremost Jack Hill made his movies to be enjoyable for the viewer, and this one excels in the fun department! The dialog is great and done with toungue firmly in cheek. The characters are great and handled with a suprising dignity despite the humorous approach. Some say this is Hill's magnum opus, and while I personally would give that designation to his film Coffy, this one is certainly essential viewing if you're going to discuss Jack Hill or 70's Drive-in movies in general.

The widescreen print looks great, and the extras are voluminous, informative and entertaining. Quentin Tarantino has done a great thing in providing this much insight into the often overlooked Hill, who is obviously one Tarantino's heroes. It's rare to find a DVD that becomes indespensible due largely to it's extras, but here one is. Included are trailers to Jack Hill's films, selected scenes from some of his films, an intro and outro to the feature film by Tarantino, and Jack Hill's student film starring Sid Haig presented in it's entirety.

839842,5,6304298293,"I loved this Jack Hill film from 1975. It was fun to watch from start to finish. 2 gangs go up against each other in an all out duel in a roller ring shoot out,then wild in the streets with the help of a black panther female run like gang. The one gang called The Silver Daggers  reminded me of a greaser stlye gang with the leather jackets and switch blade knives,also complete with a girl that has an eye patch(she lost an eye in a fight of course).Really just over the top and unrealistic but so much fun with action and dialouge that seemed to come off of the pages of a comic book. The Dagger Debs(the gangs girlfriends) kick the guys out of their own gang the Silver Daggers(they think maybe these guys are too soft) after their leader gets knocked off in a roller rink shootout. Then the girls change their gangs name to the Jezebells and go out to seek revenge for their dead leader and go up agaisnt their rival .There happens to be a rift among the Jezebell girls as there might be a traitor or traitors within their she gang.

840091,5,6304298293,"Ahhhhh, yes ""Switchblade Sisters"", let me see if I can classify this movie: IT'S ONE OF THOSE MOVIES THAT IS SO UTTERLY BAD, THE ACTING IS SO OUT THERE BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, IT'S ENTERTAINING ENOUGH THAT YOU CAN SIT THERE AND ENJOY IT!.
This is another one of my classic VHS to DVD transfer purchases, I've had this movie on VHS for so long, I just had to have it on DVD.  My girlfriend even sat and watched it with me and the funny part is that movies that she has watched with me that were 10 times better than this one was, she fell asleep for, this one, she stayed awake to watch it and when the credits were rolling at the end of the movie, she uttered that now famous quote you saw up in the title of my review.

840094,5,6304298293,"I saw this gem way back before Quentin Tarrantino rereleased it on Rolling Thunder Pictures, and I dug the hell out of it.  Not trying to prove how old school I am with that, but it's odd how this film was universally reviled before, and now is considered a cult classic.  It's still the same movie it was before Tarrantino put this DVD out.  I just wanna make it known that this is one person who always liked it.

First of all, this is not meant to be a realistic portrayal of what life is like for girls in gangs, nor a cautionary tale of the future.  It's meant to be trashy fun.  Jack Hill actually did research about gang life before he made this movie, but then threw it all out, because he didn't think stark realism would work well with chicks in hot pants.  It's set in the near future, or possibly an alternate present, but it is in no way meant to be taken seriously.

Believe it or not, Switchblade Sisters is a neo-futuristic retelling of Shakespeare's ""Othello.""  And it is so much cooler than the Josh Hartnett vehicle, ""O.""  The movie opens with a girl gang called The Dagger Debs, the counterparts to the male gang, The Silver Daggers.  The Debs' leader, Lace, (the ""Othello"" character, for those of you paying attention) is brilliantly played with much gusto by Robbie Lee.  Her boyfriend is the leader of the Silver Daggers, Dominic.

The Daggers and their Debs are chillin' in a fast food joint when they notice a blond babe who won't leave ""their"" table.  They hassle her, but to their surprise, she impressively defends herself.  Her name is Maggie, and after they do a little jail time together, she and Lace forge a fast friendship.

Lace isn't the only one Maggie has impressed, however.  Lace's boyfriend Dom is after her.  Maggie admits that she has feelings for Dom, but would never betray Lace.  This is just enough for Patch (aka Yago) to use to manipulate Lace into believing that Maggie is her enemy.

One great scene is when Maggie must prove her loyalty to the Dagger Debs by retreiving the medallion worn by Crabs, the leader of the rival gang.  It's hilarious to see her manipulating him by playing the bad stereotype of a ditzy woman in order to hide her intelligence and skill.  ""Um...I'm trying to get into the Dagger Debs?  And I'm supposed to deliver a message.  I don't know what it means!""  And of course this girl comes right out and tells the creepy looking Crabs that she's from a rival gang, and yet he believes that she wants to fool around with him, rather than steal his medallion!  I'm not knocking that as an unbelievable plot point, cuz we all know that's how it is with guys like him.

From a feminist perspective, it's hard to overlook the rape scene between Maggie and Dominic.  First of all, I've seen lots of exploitation movies, and lots of rape scenes that were far more offensive than this.  Many of these rape scenes are shot so that the audience becomes voyeur, and the woman is exhibited for the audience in the same way she is exhibited for her attackers.  These rape scenes are meant to be titilating, but usually leave me feeling disgusted, and guilty for watching women being exploited.  But in this scene, Maggie is not being exposed, and most of what happens is in the dark, or on the other side of her door.  What we see is not excessive, but it also doesn't look censored.  And at the end of it, I'm feeling pissed off, but for the right reasons.

It may seem offensive, or just strange, that after this happens, Maggie is still on speaking terms with Dom.  But the point of this is not to say that what Dom did was acceptable.  He's a gigantic pig, and not good enough for either Lace or Maggie.  Yet, any time he does anything to reveal what a low life he actually is, both girls turn a blind, codependent eye, and convince themselves that it isn't really his fault.  Of course this is wrong, but it's the tragic flaw that tears their otherwise loyal friendship apart.

We can see it's gotten too far when Lace conspires with a rival gang to have Maggie killed.  Luckily, it backfires, and our heroine lives to see another day, but with disasterous consequences.  ""I had to do it!  He was treating me like a little gutter cat!""  At this point, Lace actually believes that Maggie's presence is causing Dom to be a jerk, rather than Dom himself.

There are some real zingers in here as far as dialog is concerned, and many of them are punctuated with the actors' enthusiastic delivery, particularly in the case of Robbie Lee as Lace.  However, one of the most notoriously bad lines, ""If you leave, it's all gonna turn out bad!"" sounds ok to me.  Lace is pleading with Dom to stay with her, and in a moment of scattered desperation, it sounds like something a girl her age would really say.  Lace really believes she can't be happy without Dom.  I guess it got such a big laugh from audiences because the rest of the dialog (""My old man, God rest his ass!"" or ""Hey, Crippledick, everyone knows your crank could hook a tuna!"") is so wild and unexpected that this line sounds silly by comparison.

Another one of my favorite scenes is when Maggie decides that the Dagger Debs will no longer be defined only by their male counterparts (""We're nobody's Debs anymore!"") and decides to change the gang name to The Jezebels.

I wasn't too fond of the audio commentary track with Jack Hill, the director, and Quentin Tarrantino, the Guy Who Really Likes This Movie.  I was hoping Tarrantino would be interviewing Hill, and encouraging him to say more about his experience making the movie.  Hill is very soft spoken, and unfortunately, Tarrantino keeps interrupting him throughout.  I want to hear about Jack Hill's experience making the movie, not a bunch of stuff Tarrantino once read about it, or worse, what his famous friends thought about the movie when he showed it to them.

I've seen a lot of exploitation movies that claim to be all about female empowerment by having a female lead.  But this film is one shining example of feminist exploitation cinema.  I don't know if such a term exists, but if it doesn't it should be created just for this classic.  I never thought I'd say this, but I agree 100% with Tarrantino when he says, ""You start out laughing at this movie, but about halfway through you realize that you actually care about these people.""  If he can do that with trashy exploitation, Jack Hill is one of the most underappreciated directors of our time.",1104624000,13,6439,4.535125758889852

Directed by Jack Hill, SWITCHBLADE SISTERS is a cult classic that was sadly overlooked until Quentin Tarantino managed to get it re-released. Cinema snobs (People who think the only films worth watching are arthouse junk that make ""statements"") will look down on anyone who calls this a movie- but those of us who aren't pretentious geeks (i.e: ME, & hopefully YOU who are reading this) will see merit in this cheesy B grade sex & violence entertainment.
Also known as THE JEZEBELS & PLAYGIRL GANG, the movie centers around two street gangs The Dagger Debs: Lace (Robbie Lee), Patch (Monica Gayle), Donut (Kitty Bruce- Lenny's daughter) & Bunny (Janice Karmen) & their male counterparts the Silver Daggers; who run a drugs & prostitution racket at their high school.
One night at a diner the Dagger Debs try to recruit a customer named Maggie (Joanne Nail) to the gang after she pulls a knife on  Patch & nearly cuts out her  good eye. Unfortunately the cops sweep the place and Maggie is jailed along with the rest of the gang.
On their release, the gang decide to put Maggie through her first test towards becoming a member. This involves seducing some greasy gimp named Clutch (Paul Lichtman) & stealing his medallion as part of the initiation; but in an act of retaliation Clutch abducts & rapes Bunny, leaving her hospitalised in a critical condition.
This of course leads to an all-out gang war in the movie's latter third- with The Dagger Debs re-christening themselves The Jezebels & joining forces with the Silver Daggers & soon the streets are flowing with blood.  There is however, some brief insight into the psychology of the gangs: an explaination one of the Silver Daggers gives for being in a gang is because of his insecurity over having a crooked willy. Now there's a plausible reason to go out and knife people!
SWITCHBLADE SISTERS is a fun explotation flick, but is a bit lacking in the T&A department (that's not to say there isn't any, though)- it's also worth noting that this was made four years before Walter Hill's THE WARRIORS which made this genre hip. Granted, SWITCHBLADE SISTERS isn't up to the standards of director Jack Hill's earlier classic SPIDER BABY; but for its kitschy late night entertainment value, SWITCHBLADE SISTERS is hard to beat. Check it out.",1060992000,,2414,4.840193704600484
840099,5,6304298293,"I must disagree with many of the other reviewers - this film is not cheese at all. In the strictest sense of the word, it's not a sexploitation flick, either, although many may argue this point.
This film was written as a modern-day, female version of 'Othello,' not a gang/bike/trash story at all! Basic rundown - The Dagger Debs gang, led by Lace, takes on a new member named Maggie.  She is fiercely loyal to Lace, but gang member Patch is jealous and manages to turn Lace against Maggie through a series of well laid out machinations.  Meanwhile, Lace's boyfriend Dominick is making the moves on Maggie.  Much madness and mayhem ensues.  So, yes, there are lots of cat-fights, tough chicks, and chain fights, not to mention more than one tight top to be seen and maybe a breast here or there. But don't let these be the only thing you see when watching this film! With the exception of the actress playing Donut, the acting in this film is perfectly good (Donut is Lenny Bruce's daughter, and she got the part on name merit alone). Additionally, character development is high, the plot moves well, action is great. And, durn, it's based on Shakespeare!....sort of.
There are a variety of reasons to watch 'Switchblade Sisters,' whether you are a fan of sexploitation flicks, B-movies, Jack Hill, or the cult genre in general. There's even a bonus for those interested in finding a 'diamond in the rough' or other hidden cinematic gems - this is one well-made film. You really cannot go wrong with this movie.
A note on different versions of this film: The Quentin Tarantino/Rolling Thunder version is terrible. As usual, Tarantino places himself both at the beginning and end of the film, rambling incoherently and redundantly about the merits of the work. It is a real distraction and he has absolutely -nothing- interesting to say. If you are able to purchase the Johnny Legend release instead, I would suggest you do so. It includes some interesting interviews at the end of the tape with Jack Hill and the two main actresses.",1030147200,9,2033,4.7507082152974505

7867665,3,6304298293,"While I would give the movie alone 5 stars, I have to give this edition only 3 because of the cheap ""widescreen"" aspect ratio Its widescreen yet not anamorphic, & I could live with that, but on my tv it has the widescreen aspect ratio packed into the fullscreen ratio. That is to say you see a full screen window on an HDTV with black bars on the sides, then a widescreen aspect pack into the fullscreen. you then have a much smaller widescreen ratio with black bars on the top bottom and both sides. I will be purchasing a better copy asap. The Special features would put this over the top in ratings, but the ratio is just too awful and cheap looking.",1473638400,2,653,4.274193548387097
