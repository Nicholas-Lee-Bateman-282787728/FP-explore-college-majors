8554350,5,B00AMROZ9I,"OH WOW!!  This is Hrithik Roshan's best movie showcasing his dancing. Stick with watching it from the start even though he really doesn't start doing his thing until later in the film...but just stick with it and it'll be worth it!!!  Also watch his Jodha Akbar, Lakshya (has my fav dance number in this one even though it's a serious role for him), Agneepath, Guzaarish, his comedy ""Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara"" is a GORGEOUS FILM AND SO FUNNY, Koi..Mi Goyla, Krrish & Krrish3 (last 3 are a trilogy).  In 2013 he has ""Bang Bang"" and ""Shuddi"" releasing.  Check him out on YOUTUBE - favorite dance number on Youtube is Da Joob or it also goes by ""Come fall in Love"" also his ""Just Dance"". Watch on Youtube his interviews on Rendevous with Simi Garawal (3 parts).  He CAN ACT & HE IS GORGEOUS..and he is a fantastic dancer!!",1384819200,,819,4.506756756756757
