7167756,5,B00XI058UG,"The pilot is bit a disjointed, but the series is definitely a must see!  The acting is superb!  I've never seen this caliber of acting and cast on anything BET has done.  Mykelti Williamson, Giancarlo Esposito, and even Method Man deliver solid performances every week.  This show changes the tides for that network.  Hopes it sticks around.  Great storylines!",1494806400,3,360,5.016949152542373

8715934,5,B00XI058UG,"Awesome series! The main character, Rebel, played by Danielle Mone' Truitt, is strong and you instantly can pull for her and hope her stubbornness doesn't get in her own way. Her best friend and best supporting actress in every sense of the word, Cheena, played by Angela Ko, is brilliant in her come out role and brings love, joy, and lightens the mood to a series that addresses our current serious societal and police issues. Giancarlo Esposito, from Breaking Bad, is great, of course, this time in a non-sinister role.",1502150400,,522,4.811111111111111
