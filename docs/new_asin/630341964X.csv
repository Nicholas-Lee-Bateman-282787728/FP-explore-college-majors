650418,4,630341964X,"Some descent light entertainment, and great for kids.
This movie stars Macaulay Culkin as Richie Rich. The richest little boy in the world , in this movie adaptation of the famous comic book.
We see how he overcomes , with flying colours , his own struggle to make real friends , while defeating the wicked whiles of Lawrence Van Dough (John Larroquette - 'Night Court'. ) , to save his parents - Richard
And Regina Rich played by Edward Herrmann and Christine Ebersole.
Kudos must also go to Jonathan Hyde as Richie's ever-faithful butler, Herbert Cadbury , Micheal McShane as Professor Keenbean , and Stephi Lineburg as little Gloria , who we know from the comic books as Richie's 'girlfriend'.",1050192000,,696,4.808333333333334
650419,3,630341964X,"It is my opinion that this movie was well done.  I thought the cast carried their parts with alacrity and I applaud them for that.  I always enjoy seeing MacCaulay Culkin in a picture--he is such an effortless young actor and yet his talent is monumental.  Edward Herman is a delight as always.  No, I simply don't agree that this is a bad picture.  Hurrah for Richie Rich!",1008806400,,373,4.426470588235294
650420,5,630341964X,"RICHIE RICH is a very good movie, despite the low-box office sales. It's a great movie for both kids and parents to enjoy, though typically, kids would probably enjoy this more. Child-star (at the time this film was made) Macaulay Culkin plays Richie Rich, the son of the wealthiest man in the world. Since Richie is so wealthy, everybody thinks he has everything. But one thing he doesn't have is real friends. It's a comedy with lots of laughs and excitement. A perfect family film for a restful evening. Go and see it today!",986342400,2,527,4.617021276595745

650710,5,630341964X,"This movie is great, it show's that being rich is not always fun & making friends isn't easy when your rich. Everyone has a different view on Richie ( Macaulay Culkin ) he's spoiled, an there's no way he need's any friend's until he find himself bored of all the toy's he has an no one to play with. That is until he goes an plays baseball with a group of kids who don't really like him until he proves himself to them that just because he wear's the suite, tie & carries a stack of $100's around doesn't mean he's not a good person & only cares about himself. The greedy bastard that tries to kill Richie & is after Richie's parent's wealth gets his ass handed to him by a group of kids. The funny way of how he's outwitted by a group of kids & professor who eat's donut's, creates invention's for Richie is hilarious. A giant bubble bath in the fountain, a remote controlled bee ( no really not kidding ) slime, & much more. Laundry soap, dishwasher soap & bubble bath makes one heck of a distraction as chaos unveils it's self in this movie !

Just FYI don't try to replicate the fountain scene in your backyard it might kill your grass & you may find yourself slipping on your ass cause of it. :)",1488585600,,1200,4.194805194805195

The story is intriguing and has a good message, which highlights that the most important things in life do not come with price tags. It portrays the Good within ourselves, and the value of acts of kindness.

A young boy has everything any child could possibly dream for, but he wants real friends. Friends who like him for the person he is, and not for the materialistic items he owns. Richie Rich has to be accepted by his new friends, which makes his dream come true and they support his plan, when he discovers a family problem.

653827,5,630341964X,"Richie Rich, starring Macaulay Culkin (of ""Home Alone"" fame), Edward Herrmann (of ""Gilmore Girls""), Christine Ebersole, and John Larroquette, is a sweet family-friendly movie based on classic comic-book (and cartoon) character, by the same name, that is suitable for ALL ages from young children to even non-judgmental adults!

I was in high school when ""Richie Rich"" first came out in 1994, and I LOVED it back then and still (more than 15 years later) love it now, as a 30-something! Granted, I may be biased, because I'm a HUGE kid at heart (or ""kid-ult"", as its been called) & still LOVE many things that are typically considered for children (like classic animated Disney movies, vintage 80's toys,  family-friendly [some may say lame/cheesy] movies, etc.) but I think that ""Richie Rich"" is one of the few movies out there that TRANSCENDS the age gap.

Richard ""Richie"" Rich Jr.(played by Macaulay Culkin) is the world's wealthiest kid, the likable but isolated only child of multi-billionaires Richard (Edward Herrmann) Rich, a tycoon worth $70 billion, and his wife, Regina (Christine Ebersole) Rich. Richie has been raised having everything that money can buy (literally EVERYTHING, including his own McDonalds at home, his own roller-coaster, his face on a ""Mount Richmore"" mountain and more!), but with only loyal butler Herbert Cadbury as a companion. In terms of material goods, Richie has anything & everything he wants. But he does not have the one thing that money can never buy - real friends.

Richie is lonely and wants friends who accept him for who he is and have the time to just hang out, and have fun like kids. He tries to make friends with his rich snobby classmates, but they have no time for him and are too busy trying to get even richer, to care about just hanging out & having fun. He then thinks he might get his chance to make friends. when, at a dedication for the reopening of the ""United Tool"" factory, a factory his dad, Richard Rich Sr., recently bought (with the intention of modernizing it & then giving it away to the employees as a token of goodwill) he meets a group of kids (and the children of the United Tool employees) playing baseball in a sandlot near the factory & tries to befriend them, but that doesn't go so well either................at least at first.

But Richie will need the help of these friends when the scheming villain of ""Richie Rich"", the greedy CFO of Rich Industries, Laurence Van Dough, who opposes all of the Rich family's charitable donations/spending (like giving away the United Tool factory to the employees, for example), and with the help of Ferguson, who is also Richie's too-strict (but clearly with ulterior motives) bodyguard, plots to kill off the entire Rich family with a bomb (disguised as a present to the Queen of England) planted on board their plane, and steal the Rich financial fortune, by plundering the the family vault that Richard has made vague references to, and which Van Dough, believes contains all the wealth of the Rich family.

The real test of friendship comes when Richie's new friends are forced to put themselves (and their lives) on the line to help save Richie and his parents from the evil Laurence Van Dough & Ferguson - and Richie learns whether or not he really has the one thing money can never buy..................true friends.

Richie Rich is a good clean movie that has no (or an amount so minimal, it passed my notice) swearing, or foul language, no graphic sexual scenes (other than kiss[es] between married couple) and no gratuitous violence, though there are scenes with guns, shooting & violence, it is  not graphic (like some other movies out there), is in a context of the plot, and is the family-friendly depiction, tempered for the youth audience. Even the scenes with violence are NOT overly scary (no more than the scenes with the villains of animated Disney movies) and after watching it again this morning, more than 15 years after the first time I saw it (though I have watched it from time to time over the intervening years) I enjoyed it just as much now as a 30-something, as I did as a teen high-schooler in 1994!!

653926,3,630341964X,"Richie Rich is a thoroughly ridiculous movie - ridiculous situations, ridiculous characters, ridiculously large (but very real Biltmore Estate) mansion, and its ridiculously fun too.  Like Spiderman, Superman, Batman, and others, the character of Richie Rich is based on a comic book superhero.  Richie Rich offers us a different type of superhero in that his super power consists of the ridiculous amount of $$$$$ he has.  Richie and his family can do amazing things with their superpower. They can build their own Mount Richmore, build a McDonald's in their basement, have their own rollercoaster, jet all over the world and more. Just as most kids have dreamed of being able to fly like Superman and swing from webs like Spidey, kids and adults alike have dreamt of what it would be like to have Bill Gates' billions.  And like Superman, Batman, Spidey, etc., the Rich family uses their superpower to help others.

Another similarity between Richie and other comic book heroes is that just as Superman, Spidey and Batman's superpowers keep them from getting and/or keeping a girl - Richie's superpower keeps him from getting and keeping friends.  This movie is about how all that changes.  Though Richie's $$$$$ plays an initial role in introducing him to potential friends, it's not what enables him to keep them - Richie is genuinely a nice kid.

Sure its silly and ridiculous but guess what - its supposed to be.  For me the less than stellar acting and profuse overacting on the part of some of the actors just adds to the overall ridiculousness.  This is a fun family movie - just remember that you're watching a comic book.",1184630400,2,1632,4.880434782608695

The movie is Richie Rich, where you might also see two cent signs in place of the two c's in the title. At the beginning of the movie Ritchie Rich is born to Richard (Edward Herrmann) and Regina Rich (Christine Ebersole) , and then 12 years later it looks like he has everything, he has his own butler Herbert Cadbury (Jonathan Hyde), and is the richiest kid in the world, but where are his friends? Oh yeah, he doesn't have any, not like he is mean, his father saved a company from going out of busines, but can't be at the grand re-openning so he sends Richie who even spends time playing baseball, and spots local kids playing baseball, but because of his busy schedule he is not allowed to even join in the game. So he decicees that this is the missing part of his life. And along being the heir to his family riches, he even has a cool satellite-driven Dadlink, that is acomputer system, that tracks down Richard from wherever he is, so Richie can chat with him as he wishes too, when his Dad is out on the road. And there is family inventor Professor Keenbean (Michael McShane), who is apart of Richie's life, and is his teacher in chemistory class. But then his whole family including Richie is invited to tea and crimpits with the queen of England, and his Dad's own presonal advisor (John Larroquette), has had enough of his employer's philanthropic investments and charitable contributions, and he wants to get to thier hidden vault, so he decides to kill the family by placing a gift in thier airplane with a bomb, but when Richie looks upset, about his lastest go round trying to make friends, Cadbury asks his Mom's premisson to keep him home from the trip, so he can keep his busy with a schedule and she agrees, and then they take off, unaware of wait is waitng for them on the plane. Cadbury even manges to convince a kids that they saw play basbeall, and tried to make friends, but they turned him down the day before, to play with Richie, and well you should get where the movie is going from here, but please if oyu want to watch the movie, watch it to find out what happens next, and if you like any of the cast member,s that is good enough reason to watch this film.",1157155200,3,2778,4.344230769230769

While it is true that the movie almost makes light of these facts, I was able to see past the pseudo front act that this movie puts out to see what the producer was really saying.

This movie is dramatic, painful, and at times, depressing. Between this and Shindler's List, I am not sure how we got out of the 90's!",1136246400,2,585,4.3577981651376145
653930,4,630341964X,"Richie Rich is the world's poor little rich boy. He's the richest kid on Earth, but all he really wants are friends (well, he's got everything else). He spends his days living by a meticulous schedule that sometimes even includes filling in for his father at public appearances. His wealthy schoolmates are just as busy as he is and not quite as desperate to do ""regular kid things"" as Richie. While filling in for his father at a public event, however, Richie takes notice of some inner-city, street-wise kids playing baseball in a vacant lot nearby and makes an attempt to join in. They soon make it clear that he does not belong, and poor Richie goes home in despair. Seeing his disappointment, Richie's protective and caring butler, Cadbury, makes arrangements for the kids to come to the Rich family mansion and spend a day with the boy, much to Richie's joy and surprise! The gang of kids have a ball riding Richie's rollercoaster, trying out his kid-a-pult, and eating in his own, personal McDonald's. At the end of the day, Richie's new friends have accepted him as being just another regular kid, though they more than appreciate the benefits that come with his friendship. Still, feisty redhead Gloria, self-appointed leader of the bunch, makes it clear that they like Richie more for who he is than for all the neat stuff he has. Richie doesn't have much time to be happy about that, though. Word soon arrives that Richie's parents, benign but sometimes clueless Richard and Regina Rich, were victims of an assassination attempt and are now lost at sea and assumed dead. As the Riches survive in a life raft on Perrier and champagne, Richie is forced to take over the family company and keep it safe from malicious top executive Lawrence Van Dough, who planned the attack on Richie's parents in the first place. Luckily, with his new friends' help, Richie turns out to be a business whiz! Richie has to become even more assertive when Cadburry is framed and locked up for the murder of Richie's parents though. Some help from in-house inventor Professor Keenbean allows Richie to break Cadburry out, but matters become even more complicated when the Rich parents finally are rescued by the villainous Van Dough and his cronies themselves, purely so they can open the voice-activated lock on the family vault in Mt. Richmore. Now, Richie and his crew must prove their mettle and save Richie's parents and fortune from a criminal desperate to do anything to have it all!

After the wonderful holiday films ""Home Alone"" and ""Home Alone 2"" turned child-actor Macaulay Culkin into an instant superstar, he sadly seemed incapable of having another success. 1994's ""Richie Rich"" was just one example of several films the young actor made after his big Christmas hits that failed to strike a chord with movie going audiences or critics. Sadly, ""Richie Rich"" is really a great film. While not a perfect adaptation of the comic and cartoon (the villainous Van Dough is an adult exec here rather than a rotten cousin, Gloria is unfortunately a cute but street-sassy tomboy with a last-name change rather than Richie's sweet and femininely dressed girlfriend, and Irona the robot maid/bodyguard is nowhere to be seen until the direct to video ""sequel""), the performances, particularly the adult ones, are fantastic, fun, well developed and well fleshed-out considering their cartoon origins, and easily carry the very basic cartoon plot. The humor and emotion is well-written, even if it's an age-old story of the rich kid who just wants friends. And, of course, the sights are the icing on the cake, from the kooky inventions of Professor Keenbean to the glorious Rich Family Estate (actually the Biltmore Estate in North Carolina), not to mention the world's only Dollarmation, Richie's dog, Dollar! The DVD is in widescreen and includes one Bonus Feature, which is the theatrical trailer. Hey, ""Richie Rich"" isn't rocket science, but it's a feast for the eyes and a fun family fantasy from beginning to end that brings back childhood memories of Saturday morning cartoons and Harvey comics, and with actors like Edward Herrmann, John Larroquette, and Jonathan Hyde in a live-action cartoon, you know you're in for a treat!",1133481600,33,4224,4.932584269662922
653931,1,630341964X,"Ouch! We can add another batch of compost to the trash heap that is Macaulay Culkin's career.  While he may have been somewhat entertaining in HOME ALONE, by the time RICHIE RICH was made, Culkin's lack of real depth is on full display.  While I won't say that this is the worst kid's movie I have ever seen, it is definitely up there.

I agree with other reviewers that speak about the film's mixed messages.  For example, we are supposed to believe that a man who has singlehandedly built an empire that could topple other nations is completely disinterested in money & wealth, choosing instead to lock up his memories in his secret vault and spend all of his time canoodling with his wife.  Moreover, there is a problem surrounding Richie's dilemma.  It is an old one: the rich kid with no friends.  Richie just wants to play baseball like everyone else.  The movie is, to a large extent, a resolution of that problem.  What's the solution?  Have your father build a baseball diamond in your backyard, furnish your friends with uniforms, and allow you all to have a ball (complete with an in-house umpire).  The message: money can't buy you love.  But, oh boy, does it help!

I remember really enjoying the cartoon while I was a kid, but this film fails to recreate the ""feeling"" of those comics.  Instead, it exploits the few talents Culkin has and goes for the classic, boring family movie.  Don't bother with RICHIE RICH.  You're better off sticking to other gems in Culkin's trash-pile, such as HOME ALONE or HOME ALONE 2: LOST IN NEW YORK.",1128902400,5,1547,4.611721611721611
653932,2,630341964X,"It's 1994, but for Macaulay Culkin's film career, it's a minute before midnight and the Governor won't be calling. Culkin's capital offense is the moronic Richie Rich. While the writing and directing help put this kidpic flat on the mat, it's Culkin's presence that beats it senseless. If you've got any compassion, you can only hope that Culkin's father didn't put all the money into internet stocks.

Richie Rich teaches us two lessons: 1) having 70 billion dollars is meaningless if you don't have friends and 2) having 70 billion dollars puts you in a pretty good position to get friends once you've learned Lesson 1. The message is: rich or poor, it's better to have money. This is, of course, a variant on the message kids got a couple of years ago from Beauty And The Beast-- namely, that outward appearances count for absolutely nothing, but since you've got to have one, it might as well be really buff.

Richie, the eponymous protagonist rendered unwatchable by Culkin, is, of course, the richest kid in the world, a Lucky Sperm Club Founding Member born of parents whose net worth totals the aforementioned outsize wad. Growing up, Richie gets the best of everything: aerobics classes with Claudia Schiffer, batting lessons from Reggie Jackson, and a private Air Force at his disposal that could kick, say, Italy's ass. He's even got his own Disney-sized amusement park and a McDonald's in his basement.

But is he happy? Of course not. What he really wants is to hang out with the scruffy, street-smart kids (one black, one white, one Hispanic, one Asian, one handicapped Native American jewish lesbian etc.) who play ball in the vacant lot next to the tool factory owned by his dad's company. The scruffy kids, though, want nothing to do with a child of privilege, or at least not one who wears a quart of Valvoline in his hair.
Richie's butler, who tempers his stiff British propriety with the emotional radar of a Seemingly Stiff British Butler Who Really Has A Big Heart, senses his young charge's longings and arranges for the scruffy kids to spend a day chez Rich. And at the end of the day, whaddaya know! They like Richie because of who he is, not because of what he has. They like him in spite of his world-class rollercoaster, not because of it---although they're not exactly begging Richie to come to their place for the next play date.

The rest of the insipid plot has Dad's evil lieutenant planning to blow up the Riches' private jet with them on it and sell the run-down tool factory, which is somehow the crown jewel in a 70 billion (with a ""b"") dollar empire. Young Richie spoils the fun by unexpectedly getting off the plane prior to takeoff. When his parents are assumed to be missing or dead, he takes control of the empire, which involves saving the tool factory, hiring all the scruffy kids, and getting his face on the front cover of every national magazine. Of course, Mom and Dad have miraculously survived the explosion with only some minor bruises and fractures. That leaves them in considerably better shape than the audience, which files a 70 billion dollar class action lawsuit against the producers charging reckless assault on intelligence.
