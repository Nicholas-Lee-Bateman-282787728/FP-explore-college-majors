Then we get to see what Freeza is really made of.  I am glad to see that  Funamation had decided to go ahead and release some more of the episodes.  I would love to see all of the 250 some episodes.  Then of course DBGT.  Trust me.  The series only gets better as everyone gets stronger.  If you  have all the others, keep getting them.  Trust me.",927072000,,494,4.159574468085107
1032295,5,6305452725,"not to say the first 2 saga's were bad. They are good but not great cause they are all edited. This is a great saga that is a perfect setup to the Frieza saga. This DVD is great cause it has alot of action and its funny too. Sure the voices are a little off. Because of this i really give the DVD a 4 and 1/2 stars. Though the voices are not terrible and awful like most people complain. Goku, Gohan, Frieza and Bulma all sound the same as on Cartoon Network. Although Vegeta and Krillin are off and since Vegeta is my favorite that is why i am most disappointed. I don't know why people say the Japanese version is better, I find it too wierd to watch. Maybe it just cause im used to the american version I've seen on Cartoon Network. Oh well, just buy this DVD cause its real good.",1050278400,3,783,4.058064516129032
1032296,3,6305452725,"Let me first say that I consider myself I nice mid-level Dragonball fan. I read the manga, go to the websites, watch the fansubs.
That said, I was very excited when I picked up this DVD, expecting loads of extra features (as a DBZ DVD trilogy I had bought in the past had), but alas, by hopes were let down. Going by extra features, there are absoluetly none. Not one.  But since a DVD should not be rated based on extra features, I'll get to the actual episodes.
To be blunt, FUNi really did a bad job with these ones, and I mean terrible (border line worst ever), with the mouths/dialogue out of sync in many scenes, terrible music, butchered dialogue. While the dub is indeed rancid and not to be viewed unless you want to be disgusted, the subtitled version isn't that great either, with numerous INTENTIONAL mistranslations of cursing. The sub isn't really bad, it's just it could be a lot better (FUNi has put out much better ones). I am impressed with the quality of the DVD as far as video goes, considering the age of these eps.
But the thing that makes me the most disgusted is that FUNi has the guts to call this ""Uncut"". While it is Uncut in the sense that no footage was left out, one of the images is doctored. In a scene where Buruma is remiscing about Son Goku's origin's and the past adventures they've shared, a scene which every dragonball fan will recall is displayed (The one where Buruma first gives the naive son goku a bath). FUNi doctored the image of a naked son goku in a bath tub to cover up his private part. The fact that in the dubbed version this part is rather doctored is the part that [I don't like] ...). However, in the subtitled version, we see the scene uncensored, but this points to a root of the problem with FUNi: It's almost as if they're afraid to release a true uncut version (perhaps out of fear that a younger viewer might see it, despite the 13+ warning on the back).
All in all, this DVD should only be bought for those who want to complete they're FUNi DVD collection, not for those seeking a good set of dragonball episodes. Perhaps those seeking content should try a fansub?
If you do buy this DVD, please buy Dragon Ball Z vol. 9 graphic novel, put out by Viz Manga (also available on Amazon.com, and happens to be sold for the lowest price I've found). This will keep you from getting tricked by the mistranslations, as the Vol. 9 Manga is the counterpart to this DVD.",1037577600,,2423,4.37250554323725
1032297,3,6305452725,"INTRO:  First of all, I would like to mention the first thing a lot of people think when they see this DVD.  This is when the original company that held DBZ, Pioneer hands over the rights to the company in full to FUNimation.  This is a landmark decision as DBZ fans will now start seeing Japanese audio included on every DVD from this point on.  Thank Kami.
PLOT:  Well, another 3 measily episodes from the series, for a unusually high price.  For individual episode reviews read the DVD description.
AUDIO:  This is the 50/50 part.  Since FUNimation was just jumping onto the ""dubbing"" bandwagon, they terribly [stunk] at first (still do to a point).  The ONLY reason I bought this DVD was for the Japanese audio track, because when you listen to the dub, you'll probably cover your ears in shere agony.  DBZ's drawing isn't always the best, and when you have bad dubbing, it brings down the series drastically.  The only thing that the two audio tracks differ in is that the English audio track has Stereo, while the Japanese has basic mono.  Strange for a DVD, but I can live with it.
VIDEO:  The video is a little granier than the rest.  FUNimation didn't spend a lot in restoring the video for this DVD.
DVD:  The menus are ok, although most people don't like them.  They are quick, and to-the-point so I really like them though.
EXTRAS:  THERE ARE NO EXTRAS!  Which I can understand because this was FUNimation's first DBZ DVD...they'll make up for it later with [poor] commercials.
OVERALL:  Overall, I gave this a 3 because the video wasn't that great, there were no extras to speak of, and the price is a little high for 3 episodes (60 minutes about).  Most people won't pay more than [price] for a 60 minute movie, as most features today are at least 80 minutes or so.  But in the end, if you are a die-hard DBZ fan, and need higher quality Japanese language DBZ than your VHS fan subs, then this is recommended for you.  Others who are looking for great DVD + great show, look somewhere else.
PS:  Although DBZ is one of my favorite shows, I will not admit there is better anime out there.",1029888000,,2101,4.485488126649076
1032298,5,6305452725,"I really enjoyed DRAGONBALL Z: CAPTAIN GINYU: ASSAULT. The characters are ridiculously funny, espescially The Ginyu Force with their obssession with posing and style. Jeice happens to be my favorite character, with his punk-rock hairdo and Australian accent, I'm not sure if he was voiced by Scott McNeil or Christopher Sabat in this version, but whoever it was, they did an awesome job. Unfortunately I can't say the same for Goku and Vegeta's voices, Goku sounded boring, and Vegeta just didn't sound quite right, too much gravel and grating. And of course I didn't like Vegeta killing Burter and Recoome when they were unconscious and helpless, Vegeta's a sadist, and I hate him anyway, he killed Zarbon and he later kills Jeice when he's begging for mercy, which really upsets me, [but that's another video]. And the sight of Recoom's bare, ugly backside I could have easily, [and gladly], done without. The Ginyu Force was great, the other characters, weren't all done that well, Frieza was voiced by a woman [Linda Young?] and that took away alot of his scary factor, [not that women can't be just as vicious as men, but Frieza is a MALE character, it just doesn't sound right]. Captain Ginyu himself was hilarious, and Guru, Nail, and Dende where well done, if given only brief parts. And best of all, I finally got to see Jeice use his Orange Fire Ball Attack! The beutifully drawn scene of Jeice in orange silouhette , preparing to spike his Fire Ball like a volley ball, was one of the best scenes on the video! 5 Stars!",1016236800,2,1530,4.734082397003745
1032299,4,6305452725,"After the demands of all the hardcore fans of this magnificent anime made my Akira Toriyama, FUNimation has finally given in to their demands and they started making DVDs with the original Japanese language.
Now the outside cover is not all that impressive since it's practilly the same as the VHS cover only with the works ""Includes 2 Versions English Uncut Version & Original Japanese Version Subtitled in English"". The region code for this is 1, 2, and 4 so people other than the people of the US can view it in their DVD players. The DVD disk doesn't look too impressive but hey this is FUNi first attempt so cut them some slack.
Now the graphic and sound of this DVD. The graphic are a definite plus for those of us how used to buy ""fansubs"" with B to C picture qualities. It's very clear and crisp image throughout the episodes. The sounds are also very good but not as loud as the English dub, but you can always turn up the volume ^^. All in all FUNi did a good job in these catagories.
Now for the only reason why I took a star off this well deserve 5 star series. FUNi didn't do such a good job of actually subbing parts of it. What I mean is that they would replace works of profanity with censered versions of it e.g. FUDGE!!!! or darn it ><. Anyways this is a must buy for anyone who's a fan to this series and those who are looking for a good action packed show.",1006560000,5,1376,4.23574144486692
1032300,4,6305452725,"Overall, this is a great DVD.  The menu isn't that great, there are no extras, and you can't select individual chapters.  It's mainly Goku fighting the Ginyu Force and then Captain Ginyu.  Goku is a god!",1006387200,,203,4.583333333333333
1032301,4,6305452725,"Finally subtitled Dragonball Z is in the United States (except the three movies of course).  Now the otaku of America can stop searching through fansub sites trying to get some decent Dragonball.  This video isn't so great in itself, but in what it gives us.  I think people should be treated to hearing what the voices are supposed to sound like.  Goku is supposed to have a high-pitched monkeylike voice.  Kaio-sama (King Kai) is supposed to have a deep, serious voice until he starts acting goofy.  Vegeta is supposed to have a more regal voice than his tough-guy one in the dub.  All I can say is I can't wait till the Super Saiyan episode is released on DVD.  I've heard the scream from when Goku first goes Super Saiyan, and no dubbing will ever repeat it.  One last note, I like that the subtitles change to fit the names (such as Kuririn, Yamucha, Muten Roshi, etc.) rather than the subtitled movies when they kept the names the same as the dub, though anyone with ears can hear different names said.",998438400,,1008,4.524861878453039
1032302,5,6305452725,"It has been long in the waiting but finally Dragonball z as it is meant to be seen is here. Why? you say. Because now after 17 DVD volumes DBZ is finally available in it's full uncut, Japanese languaged, English subtitled version, and to be honest with you it's an amazing experience to watch.
  GINYU SAGA. VOL:18 ASSAULT contains three classic episodes of one of the finest anime series ever created and show you the new improved and possibly super saiyan??? Goku battling it out against the remaining members of Frieza's elite Ginyu Force. I won't say to much of what goes on as I don't want to spoil it, but I fully recommend both this DVD and VOL: 19 DOUBLE CROSS to anyone who loves DBZ. Also if your new to DBZ then this is the best place to start off your DVD collection (I would recommend getting the earlier two sagas on VHS as the earlier DVD's offer you the same dubbed, chopped up version as they do. Save some money. The Saiyan/Namek sagas will most likely be brought out in subtitled uncut DVD form next year when Pioneers rights to them expires). Although these first attempts at putting Dragonball on this format are not as well presented as some of the later editions and come with no extras they are still more than worthy of a 5 star rating so get out there and buy it. NOW. I guarantee no regrets.",997488000,2,1318,4.397540983606557
1032303,4,6305452725,"Well, Goku finally arrives on Namek, and his power is so great he trashes the Ginyu like they're nothing. It's pretty good, the action is interesting but not great, considering that Goku doesn't face anything worthy of him yet(meaning Freiza). I'd really only recommend this for serious collectors, because it's not a good video unless it's in a series. However, if you intend to get the second Ginyu tape and the beginning of the Freiza saga this is a great buy.",989366400,,463,4.728395061728395
1032347,5,6305452725,This dvd was sooo good but i didn't much feel for the japanese version . I mean whe vioces are squeky and the swearing is uncalled for. the only reason the japanese version is so highly rated is because all the imiture little kiddies like to hear these words and think they are grown up .  How ever the american funimation version is quite the contary its well dubbed the plot doesn't differ too much and the voices are somthing you can actualy connect with which helps build up an atmosphere and help you relate. After hearing goku on this video i couldn't picture the vioce any different great casting choice for goku's voice THIS IS A MUST BUY but don't just buy it for the japanese so you may aswell get the vhs,987292800,2,715,4.335820895522388
1032348,4,6305452725,"All in all, a very good DVD. Unlike most DBZ fans, I like the American version. This was the first time I had seen the Japanese version, and I was impressed. The music is very good, especially when Goku and Captain Ginyu start fighting. Some people revile all aspects of the US version, but I find both versions are good. Linda Chambers is especially good as the American Frieza. Music is suspenseful, Characters are excellent. So yes, go try it for yourself. Best bought with the Double Cross DVD. Nothing beats the ""Change"" Music.",983059200,,532,4.670212765957447

1032351,2,6305452725,"If you have seen other DVDs, you are going to hate this one. All the character voices are different and also are no good. Hope they will revert to old people for dubbing. The new Trunks DVDs aren't from Pioneer either, oh man... :(",971395200,,231,4.2727272727272725

It even has the Japanese intro of  ""Cha-La Head Cha-La"". What lacks for being a 5 /5 is the previews  for the next episode for both the English & Japanese version which the  DVD does not contain. Also, the DVD needs to have more graphics and other  stuff to it to make it look good like movie DVD's with special features.  Anyways, DBZ rules on DVD with the subbtitle.

Although they will  not keep the original title screen, I think I can live without it. So, I  give this DVD a probable rating of 4 stars, because it's great we're  getting subbed DBZ on DVD, but they should convert their dub to the same  script.",961718400,8,521,4.329896907216495

His power level was about  70,000!I thing so because Gouku's level rises countinuasly,when gouku  starts raising his level in a minute it,s 90,000!

He claims that he likes the origional that came straight from Japan, and not these newer ones.  To set  things straight, he is wrong, the more recent episodes are dubbed purely,  without any other changes, not like the first episodes, wich i think are a  horrible mutilation to the animae.  For those of you who know what i'm  talking about, remember Piccolo's ""Special Beam Cannon""?, well it  is really known as ""Screw Beam of the Devil"".

It is much more in tune with the on screen action and atmosphere than  the previous soundtrack. The animation quality has also taken a giant step  forward. Take a look at the sequence where goku is powering up before a  stunned captain ginyu.wow! And it ill get even better in upcoming volumes!

Alot of people give Bruce Faulconer (American DBZ composer) crap about his music, but I believe it fits perfectly well! The Japanese score was ok, but for the American audience, Faulconer's score is fantastic! Love how he used the ""Ginyu Theme"" and ""Closing Credits"" songs throughout the first episode.

Ahhhhhhh! (yell of a DBZ fighter powering up) another Fight Begins?
But how much of a fight can it really be when one side is winning without even trying. 2 on 1 & that's right Goku's so fast they can't see him move let alone touch him, with great surprise to Burter & Jeice and even the rest of the Z Fighters (Vegeta, Krillin & Gohan). Though they give it there all purple spiral attacks, fire crusher balls & all. It's all useless. One kick and an elbow puts Burter down for the count & Jeice high tails it back to Captain Ginyu. While Vegeta the merciless kills recoome, Burter & Guldo while there defenseless. Meanwhile Captain Ginyu has gathered all the dragon balls and Frieza is still heading over to Guru's to get the password to use them & Bulma has her own tribulations on Planet Namek. Captain Ginyu after learning from Jeice about this saiyan, decides to confront him his self. They then learn Goku is hiding his Power Level (PL) & estimates his PL to max at 60,000. While Ginyu's distracted Krillin & Gohan search for the dragon balls Ginyu has. Goku & Vegeta team up to take on Jeice & Ginyu but Vegeta takes off & leaves Kakarot(Goku) to face them on his own. Ginyu attacks & the 2 elite fighters really go at it. Ginyu has Goku in a headlock, but what's this he let's him go cause Jeice's offered help warps his ego into overdrive. But enough wasting time  let's fight for real. 90, 100, 110, 117, 140, 150, 180,000!!!
Is Goku a Super Saiyan?

Ginyu freaks out knowing his max PL is only 120,000. He can't believe what he's seeing. But Ginyu's confidence is restored when he takes this rare Good natured saiyan(Goku) for being weak. Meanwhile Bulma takes off on her hover cycle & stumbles upon a mass of murdered Nameks. While Nail returns & Guru adorns Dende with healing powers & sends him to help the Z fighters with the dragon balls. Frieza arrives at Guru's & Nail & 3 other surviving Nameks put up a courageous but futile defense.

Overall this is a good dvd. My very first dragon ball Z dvd to be exact. I Definitely recommend. Though the DBZ dvd's are overpriced &  they should contain 8 episodes not 3. I suggest you take your time collecting them & buy 1-2 disc a month.",1111104000,3,3405,4.612582781456954

Other than that, a must see, must get dvd for a great collector.",1078617600,,281,3.7796610169491527
