8524465,3,B0083CV6FK,"""Graverobbers"" (original title ""Deadmate"") is a very, VERY weird little grade-Z movie about one of the great (and almost universal) sexual taboos, necrophilia. Therefore, this movie is definitely and absolutely *not* for children or for those who are easily squicked out. That being said, the topic, as gross as most people find it, has an undeniably creepy fascination and has been frequently covered or alluded to in (mostly) horror or thriller films with varying degrees of explicitness - for example, see the classic Italian giallo ""The Horrible Secret of Dr. Hichcock"", starring the luscious Barbara Steele, or, for that matter, just about any vampire flick ever made, where the central character, after all, is a dead (excuse me, undead) person who is often made out to be devastatingly sexy. The subject is just so way out-there that it's often played for laughs, as in ""Weekend at Bernie's"", the 2006 indie ""Drop Dead Sexy"", or the 2001 French movie ""Mortal Transfer"".  Luis Bunuel, never a stranger to addressing off-putting topics, addressed it in 1967's ""Belle du Jour"", where Catherine Deneuve played a corpse for the erotic pleasure of a client in one scene.

With that in mind, the movie does have the guts (not speaking literally, there's actually relatively little gore except for a dream scene near the beginning with a character's heart being torn from her chest, and an encounter with a rotting zombie at the film's climax) to make necrophilia its central subject. Unfortunately, the production values are so cheap (one of the cast members, Kenneth Giek, was an owner of several funeral homes which he provided gratis as sets for the movies) and the acting is generally so hilariously bad - though Elizabeth Mannino, playing the heroine Nora Mae, is quite lovely and does her best with what the (as a reviewer on IMDB put it) undeveloped and absurd script gives her - that watching the movie is more of a trudging chore than a guilty pleasure.  In point of fact - and perhaps diluting my earlier point - the production team apparently can't seem to make up their mind as to whether they actually want to do a creep-out about a ring of villains getting their jollies from women's dead bodies or perhaps a ""Frankenstein""/""Re-Animator"" clone.

Basically, the plot has Nora Mae, an ex-hooker, working at a diner where she's approached by a handsome stranger named John Henry Cox (David Gregory) who appears to fall in love with her on the spot and proposes marriage literally within minutes of their meeting. Nora, desperate for a change in her life, agrees. What her new husband doesn't tell her up front, though, is that he's the local mortician for the town of Newbury, which is full of very strange people indeed. As the film rolls on, Nora discovers that her hunky new husband is actually the ringleader of a group of perverts comprising most of the town's leading residents who are very much into sex (and other activities that won't stand scrutiny) with dead people, and tries to get out of the trap she's found herself in.

For all the talk, there's only one actual episode of post-mortem sex in the movie, where a pretty cheerleader named Cicely (Kathleen Margo) has her brakes fail on her (they were actually cut), then gets run off the road into a pond by a mystery car and drowns. The next sequence shows her dead body, with one of the strangest death expressions ever seen on film (featuring a very awkward-looking tongue-out pose; a BlogSpot reviewer commented that they tried but were unable to replicate it) being, ahem, enjoyed by the ambulance attendants sent to bring it to the mortuary. However, when Nora Mae (Mannino) spies on the proceedings that night, what she actually witnesses, as I said before, looks a lot more like a cheap ""Frankenstein"" knockoff as the baddies send jolts of electricity shooting through the unfortunate young lady's corpse, while the lead villain makes the preposterous remark that sex with the dead is the only really safe sex because ""you can't catch AIDS"".  This is followed by one of the weirdest funeral scenes ever, with all the townspeople - including the very same paramedics who had abused Cicely's corpse!!! - gathered solemnly in front of her open casket while the pastor appears to be reading the same passages over and over again. (One genuinely chilling little thing is that all of the dead girls' fellow cheerleaders are lined up in front, making one wonder if they're being sized up for the next victim...)

Unfortunately for horror fans, that's pretty much the ""height"" of the movie except for one scene later; the proceedings, from that point on, degenerate into an incoherent mess, complete with a zombie which chases the heroine on a motorcycle while having its skin flayed off by the rushing air...at 35 miles per hour. The movie can't decide whether it's being played seriously or for laughs, but the proceedings are so badly done and so idiotically absurd that it goes, pretty much by default, into ""so bad it's good"" territory.  Highlights (???) include Nora paying a visit to the town library, where the librarian foists an X-rated romance novel and Stephen King books on her, and discovering a book on sexual fetishes that freaks her out, and Cicely's brother Evan (Adam Wahl) spilling the beans on what's going on, complete with a visit to Cicely's crypt where her casket is discovered empty.  The one sequence that does anything to relieve this preposterous farrago of nonsense is Nora's attempt to escape this town of perverts and psychoes, which contains some actual suspense as she desperately dashes through corridors and alleys, finding body after body on the way (including Cicely's).

The same IMDB reviewer says that ""Dead Mate"" is ""the worst movie ever made, the B movie all others are measured to"". I really don't know if that's correct - I think a lot of people would vociferously disagree and offer their own candidates, starting with ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" (oddly enough, that thing also featured corpses - animated ones, that is) and going up, or down, from there - but it's definitely ""Mystery Science Theatre 3000""-worthy though it'd have to be cut for broadcast first!",1470787200,4,6180,4.893982808022923
