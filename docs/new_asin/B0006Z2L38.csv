If you like South Park and haven't gotten any of the boxes yet, this is a great place to start. 5 seasons in one shot!",1125878400,2,347,4.257575757575758
2197803,5,B0006Z2L38,"I already got these 5 seasons from an auction site with much cheaper price but wanted to buy the official one in order to get the English Subtitles with it...but unfortunately only the first 2 seasons had subtitles, which was not mentioned in the details of the item...so I was really frustrated for paying for something I already have with no additional features such as Subtitle.",1125619200,4,381,4.787878787878788
2197804,1,B0006Z2L38,"South Park is a show that everyone seems to love. I love Family Guy with its ""adult humor"" but I seriously found no humor in South Park. I tried to get into it, but all the jokes were lame, stupid, and the characters were annoying with their weird shapes and annoying voices. On top of it, the humor in this show is way over the top and seriously sacriligious. Jesus in a boxing match against the devil getting his but kicked? Come on! The passion of the Jew? This is trash and I'm ashamed that our country enjoys it. So, you know what, give me 0 out of 800 helpful votes because all of you love it but at least, I spoke my thoughts on this awful show.",1125360000,5,652,4.1015625
2197805,5,B0006Z2L38,"South Park has truly been one of the funniest shows on TV over the past ten years. This outrageous yet hilarious cartoon finds the perfect balance of all areas of humour; appealing to a very wide audience. Almost every episode provides a great laugh - fantastic entertainment all around. The first five seasons alone display the excellent quality of this show, whether you're a fan or not - this product is highly recommended!

Season One:

The first 13 episodes are considerably less in-depth than a lot of the later episodes, but still downright hilarious. In this set, the characters are introduced perfectly and plots are intriguing enough to make an immediate impact. The funniest episodes here include:

Starvin Marvin: The boys inadvertently adopt a starving Ethiopian and name him ""Marvin"", but it is ultimately Cartman that is sent back to the third world country Marvin comes from.

Pinkeye: Halloween episode. An outbreak of zombies in South Park causes trouble for the boys at Halloween.

Tom's Rhinoplasty: Wendy becomes jealous when Stan falls for a new substitute teacher, totally unaware that she bats for the wrong team anyway.

Mr Hankey The Christmas Poo: The famous first Xmas special, in which Kyle spreads the word of Mr Hankey - a talking piece of Christmas Poo. Hilarious stuff.

Season Two:

The second season manages to improve over the first and deliver some truly classic episodes, with great humour that never gets boring. Ignore the poor opener, the rest of this set is superb. The best episodes here include:

Cartman's Mom Is Still A Dirty ****: Cartman continues the quest to find the identity of his father, but it isn't going to be easy. Maphesto - the scientist with the answer - is shot. It's up to the boys to save him and uncover the mystery.

Chickenlover: Officer Barbrady - the town's local cop - admits to being illiterate. The boys must help Barbrady learn to read so that he can catch South Park's latest criminal.

Summer Sucks: It's summer time in South Park - but fireworks have been banned. The boys come to realise that there is nothing else to do, so Jimbo and Ned head off to retrieve fireworks from elsewhere. Meanwhile, the mayor puts on a 4th July celelbration the town will never forget.

Clubhouses: The boys build rival clubhouses in a competition to attract chicks and play ""Truth or Dare"". At the same time, Stan fights to prevent the divorce of his parents.

Season Three:

Probably the weakest season of the five, but still very funny. 17 episodes - most of which are very good. A few less comical editions don't ruin this set. The best of the bunch are:

Rainforest Schmainforest: The boys are sent off with a choir group to explore the rainforest, gradually coming to the conclusion that the rainforest sucks. Classic comedy.

Succubus: Chef finally decides that his womanising lifestyle is getting too much for him and decides to settle down with a long term partner. The boys don't approve of their friend being snatched away and attempt to reveal his evil girlfriend's true identity.

Sexual Harrassment Panda: Petey the Panda is a mascot who visits the school in order to discuss sexual harrassment. This leads to an abundance of lawsuits against the school. The boys search for Petey to warn him of what South Park has become.

Chinpokomon: This emmy nominated episode features a hilarious spoof of Pokemon. The children become obsessed with this new fad, which at first seems somewhat harmless, but is later discovered to be an anti-american movement. Kyle works to keep up with the fad.

Season Four:

South Park is back to it's best. 17 episodes, each with strong moments - some standing out as classics! The picks here are:

Cartman's Silly Hate Crime: Cartman throws a rock at Token, only to be accused of committing a hate crime and sent to juvenile hall. He must pull his weight to get by in the big house. Meanwhile, the boys are challenged to a sledding race by the girls and need Cartman back to stand a chance of winning.

The Tooth Fairy Tats: When the boys are finally told that the tooth fairy isn't for real, they see the opportunity to make money in the ""tooth trade"". However, the existing mob branch don't take too kindly to this. Throughout this, Kyle seeks the answers to what really does and doesn't exist.

Chef Goes Nanners: The issue of the South Park flag is raised - Chef sees it as racist whereas Jimbo sees it as unchangable. The debate is passed over to the school children, where two sides must prepare their case. When made co-leaders of the same team, Cartman and Wendy become attracted to one another.

Something You Can Do With Your Finger: The boys form their own boy band, after a vision Cartman had of his future. They hold auditions to find a fifth member, before seeking an opportunity to display their talent on stage.

Season Five:

The final season of this set is by far the funniest yet. Only 14 episodes, but each put together with true class. You'll never get bored of these. The best include:

Scott Tenorman Must Die: Cartman buys pubic hair from an eighth grader named Scott Tenorman, only to realise he has been ripped off. Cartman seeks revenge, but comes off second best with each plot. This episode features the most shocking ending in South Park history.

It Hits The Fan: When a certain obscentiy is used on TV for the ""first time"", it becomes a common phrase to all residents of South Park. The boys feel this may be related to a recent illness outbreak and fight to prevent the use of this word. Throughout the episode, a small counter keeps track of just how many times the word is used - stretching to well over 100.

Towelie: This is one of those really mad episodes that's better just to enjoy rather than to question. The boys obtain a new video game console and become obsessed with playing it, but accidentally stuble acroos a talking towel. The console is taken and held at ransom, in return for Towelie. The boys embark on an adventure to return Towelie to his base, remaining focussed on their console the whole time.

Osama Bin Laden Has Farty Pants: As you can guess from the name, this is one of the wackiest episodes there is. The boys are taken to Afghanistan by accident, where they are captured by Bin Laden himself. With help from their Afghani counterparts, the boys escape and attempt to put a stop to the Taliban once and for all.

Overall, one of the best sets of comedy money can buy.",1123200000,3,6432,4.690666666666667
2197806,5,B0006Z2L38,"I am one huge south park buff, and have seen every episode of south park ever created. Matt and Trey are the greatest geniouses of comedy and should recieve a medal. The fifth season may not be my most favorite season (that title would go to the fourth), but to have all five seasons is too good to be true.

Now, on to the box set itself, not much to say, you get every episode of south park up to the fifth season, a little bit of commentary for the first, second, and fifth season, and not much else. The price is pretty steep, but it is all worth it. I would highly recommend this box set to anybody that likes south park and also has a lot of money. Sorry this reveiw doesn't contain too much helpful information, but there are already a bunch of other reviewers who have taken the time to write thorough reviews, so I didn't bother to do that and instead I wanted to write a quick little review to express my love for South Park.",1121817600,,935,4.165745856353591

i'm wandering what are the languages of these DVD's ?

English of course, but is there a French version too ?

Thanks for your help",1111449600,3,136,4.153846153846154
2197808,5,B0006Z2L38,"I usually don't comment 5/5 on anything, but this season is amazing.

Season 5 includes: Introduction of Towelie (must i say anymore?)

Yes? OK, this is also the year Cartman redirects his hate for Hippies and Kenny towards Kyle.

And this leads us to Kenny dying and butters' very own episode, which will lead us to season 6 with Butters' and the gang.

Overall, the writing focused more on the boys and less on the school and other characters.  That is what is should be>",1108080000,9,473,4.517647058823529
2197816,5,B0006Z2L38,"These shows are wonderful, but you can buy the first five seasons on iTunes cheaper.",1176163200,,84,4.666666666666667
2197817,1,B0006Z2L38,$174.99 is ridiculous!  You guys keep upping the price!  I paid $114.99 elsewhere.,1164067200,4,82,5.230769230769231

2197819,3,B0006Z2L38,"It ends up that the 1st 5 seasons separately purchased end up being around $20 cheaper than this bundle. This show is amazing, but you could buy the South Park Movie DVD along with the seasons and it'd still be cheaper than this bundle.",1153785600,8,236,4.386363636363637
2197820,5,B0006Z2L38,I placed all the single volumes in the cart and the total price ($156) was $20 less than what this  box set is priced at now ($175). What is up with that??!,1150588800,4,156,3.875
2197821,1,B0006Z2L38,"Don't get me wrong, South Park is genius comedy. Sitcoms from the 50's through the 80's usually had a moral at the end of each ep. I dare you to find an episode of ""The OC"" or ""Dawson's Creek"" or ""Prison Break"" that has a healthy moral.
SP has an intelligently articulated moral at the end of (almost) every single episode. When my kids turn 14, they will be forced to watch all the back episodes.

In other matters:
You can pay $155.99 for the 5 season DVD set.
Or you can pay $128.89 and buy seasons 1 through 5 individually.
Somebody at Amazon hasn't been doing their homework.

Price this collection for $99.99 and you'll sell about a billion of them.

Update: It's April 12th, 2006 (2 days after I made the above review) and the prices of the South Park DVD's has changed. Seasons 1 - 5 now go for $29.99 each; $149.95 for all 5. The 5 season collection is $155.99. What do I get for my extra 6 bucks? A fancier box?
If you customer buys your product in volume, they usually get a discount, not an upcharge! Duh!

Update: It's Tuesday April 18th. The total price for seasons 1-5 purchased individually on Amazon is $118.85.
The box set is $145. It should be about $100 and I won't buy it until it is.",1144627200,50,1205,4.271929824561403

2197824,5,B0006Z2L38,"How can I describe Mr. Hanky in polite language? A scatological figure maybe. In reality he is more of a post-modern take on Jiminy Cricket. If you watch the show he is the most sincere out of all of the characters. He always manages to wrap up the episodes he is on with a sincere and happy ending. Also, as is made clear in the first episode he is on, he is a suitable holiday figure for people who are non-denominational. Anyway, I seriously think the creators of South Park should create a Mr. Hanky spin-off series. Having to cope with an alcoholic wife and disabled son, I think Mr. Hanky could use the money. As they say in the song, ""if you eat fiber on Christmas eve, Mr. Hanky will be sure and come down your tree"".",1136160000,2,725,4.260869565217392

But that isn't why I only gave it 2 stars. The dvds are stored in a case, two each page that is completely separate from the outside case. When I opened it the first time I almost dropped them.
