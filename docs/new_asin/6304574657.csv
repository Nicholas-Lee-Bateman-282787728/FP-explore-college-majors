899512,5,6304574657,"One of the most beautiful films I have ever seen.  Eclipses even Andreii Rublev in Tarkovskii's library.  From the opening scenes to the final  bonfire, a true masterpiece of film.  Prepare to be amazed.  Tarkovskii is  truely missed.",966470400,,234,5.026315789473684
899513,4,6304574657,"This is the latest Tarkovsky movie, and we could expect just a perfect transfer. It seems to me that the master is probably perfect but the transfer (compression) has been done too fast or wrong. There is much grain  in the picture, pixels visible especially on edges of objects lokks  scintillating, and the dark scenes are horrible. The scene at night when  Alexander walks to the maid's house is crispy and garbled. And besides the  picture looks squeezed vertically (slightly) which makes a very slight  concave effect. Otherwise the film is very good. DVD is OK.",961113600,3,567,4.864583333333333
899514,5,6304574657,"This is Andrei Tarkovsky's last film.  He knew when he was making it that this would be his last, and this film more than any other is proof of what Tarkovsky said (a good film should not be entertaining).  This film moves  at a very slow pace, but this allows for a deep examination of the  characters.  The events in the film are not shown through special effects,  or even any real visuals at all.  Each event is instead talked about by the  characters, thereby telling us what happened.
The story invovles a man  deciding to offer himself as a sacrifice (""The Sacrifice"") in  order to save humankind.  Being that this is Tarkovsky's final film, it is  deeply personal and at times painful to watch.  The film is also very  difficult to sit through at times.  It runs at just under 2 1/2 hours and  it's mostly made up of the characters' dialogue and silence.  Although the  film is better when watched all at once, it's hard.  Most people will  probably have to watch it over a longer period of time, watching only small  bits at a time.  This is a brilliant and incredible film and it's worthy of  being Tarkovsky's last film.
Anyone who is unfamiliar with Andrei  Tarkovsky should first watch ""Solaris"" and ""Stalker"" to  slowly work their way up to ""The Sacrifice.""  You may not  understand his work if you begin with this film.",961027200,4,1334,4.518987341772152

899516,5,6304574657,"after watching a film by Tarkovsky i have nothing to say, i become speechless and paralyzed.  he is the only filmmaker that can do that to me.  other films that i watch i want to talk about.  but after films like the  Sacrifice i want nothing but silence.  films like this should be kept to  oneself... one should only recommend them to others and say nothing more.  because the beauty in works like this and life itself is letting it fill  you with everything it has.  saying nothing and purifying yourself through  silence.  and this is possibly the greatest sacrifice.",954374400,4,571,4.61
899517,3,6304574657,"It's ironic how Tarkovsky is often used as the supreme benchmark of tortured artistic European depth and integrity with which to castigate the shallowness of Hollywood formulae, because this, in many ways, resembles what lazily passes for a typical Tinseltown product - a rejection of analysis and complexity in favour of mindless fantasy, facile ideas and cardboard characterisations. Even what is admirable in the film - the evocation of domestic space - was achieved with considerably more economy and power in the American films of Ophuls, Ray and Sirk. What's left are some breathtaking, if eventually wearing, sequence shots. We applaud, oh yes, but duty is never really enough.",953078400,5,684,5.284403669724771
899518,4,6304574657,"Kino on Video should be proud of their work releasing Tarkovsky's THE MIRROR and THE SACRIFICE on DVD. The DVD of THE SACRIFICE looks markedly superior to any version of the film available on home video. Doing a direct  comparison with the old Image laserdisc, I was struck by how much better  the DVD captured the film's subtle gradations of light and color, how it  revealed details in the set design which I had never noticed before. For  Tarkovsky this is all-important. In addition, the DVD includes a  feature-length documentary on Tarkovsky which says a great deal about his  working methods as a director and his thoughts on the cinema in general. If  you have any interest in Tarkovsky or in film as an art form, the DVD is  recommended.
This is not to say that the film itself is perfect. I  strongly believe that Tarkovsky's last two films, made in Europe (the other  was the Italian co-production NOSTALGHIA), are distinctly inferior to his  Russian films, especially his masterpieces ANDREI RUBLEV and THE MIRROR.  The same stunning imagery is there, and there are a number of truly great  moments; THE SACRIFICE has two celebrated l0-minute takes--the  tree-planting and house-burning scenes--which push the cinema about as far  as it can go. But there is also a certain preachiness and an implicit sense  that the film is Great Art, so therefore you must sit quietly and pay  attention to everything it has to tell you. Many of Alexander's speeches  sound suspiciously like the more didactic moments in Tarkovsky's  book-length essay SCULPTING IN TIME.
Since it's Tarkovsky, I'm willing  to listen--when I'm in the right mood--but not without a murmur of protest.  His contemporary Sergei Paradjanov managed to be playful and profound at  the same time, so I'm not sure what all the fuss is about. There is an  underlying fundamental lack of vitality here compared to his Russian films.  (Yes, I'm aware that Tarkovsky was dying of cancer when he made the film).  However, under the right conditions I've found THE SACRIFICE to be a  mesmerizing experience. I do urge you to see it.",952905600,40,2097,4.886363636363637

899661,4,6304574657,"The Sacrifice is like other Tarkovsky films, such as Stalker and the Mirror, in that it can put the viewer into a state that is reminiscent of trying to grasp nature as a child. I mean, staring at things and contemplating them without thinking words. This is something, but what is it? The film is about a man who is not happy with his life, but when something tremendously dire happens, he cannot bear to give up living. What is to be done? Interestingly, the film definitely feels like it has a Swedish / Bergman influence on it, and is distinct from the other Tarkovsky films. This comes through even in the dialogue, some of which is hard to imagine as coming from Russians. There is also this inside / outside distinction. Inside the house of the main character things often feel staged, artificial, theatrical. Outside the house, it feels like other Tarkovsky films, very elemental. The sound effects are often great for the mood: the roar of jet bombers, the fairy-like singing / calling of a sheperdess, the chirping of a flock of unseen birds, the roar of flames. Then there is the talk of an odd friend to the main character, talk about supernatural things, and put very seriously and insistently. What is this world of the protagonist? And what is to be done with it? Like other Tarkovsky films, you have to get yourself into the mood and the mysterious experience, or the film will not work for you. With the Sacrifice, this is harder to do than with the others, because the film is a bit uneven. But stick with it, because it picks up as it goes on and comes to a memorable climax.",1450310400,,1594,4.5190311418685125

Perhaps what was needed was to limit Tarkovsky to writing and directing and leave the editing solely in someone else's hands, since even in his better movies (Solaris, Stalker) he liked to wander away on tangents.  Not at all a bad movie (particularly because of the reunion of Ingmar Bergman regulars) but Andrei Rublev, Solaris, and Stalker are far superior and have more to say about Tarkovsy's style and thinking.",1440374400,,593,5.040816326530612

899840,1,6304574657,"This movie makes me despise drama majors even more.  The people who make such movies are overtly emotional, romantic (detached from reality), rationality-free aging children who meet at Cannes to hook up, cooperate, make movies, make a name, make money and continue their floofy lives on your dime.  What an utterly moronic movie, filled with mumbo-jumbo voodoo nonsense mixed with long ass paragraphs recited from the ultimate book of superstitions, namely bible, plus poor acting, meandering plot and poorly dubbed voices and sound effects.  The actors can even forget their lines and say anything since the camera is too far most of the time and the whole thing is dubbed later in a studio anyway and whole sentences can be added or changed at will.  Add terribly loud sounds of birds in the middle of a conversation to establish an island setting, fighter plane sound bites to cheaply establish a nuclear holocaust and some paper burning to represent a burning house.  Read wiki of how idiotic their conception of shooting the burning house with one camera was, how the film got jammed, shot was lost, they had to rebuild the house and failed again 2 weeks later and that is why the shot ends abruptly right when the house collapsing.  The house looks like a bunch of two by fours.  You can't expect much better from drama types who think you can plant a tall dead tree without a large hole and with the aid of a few rocks around its trunk.

They remind me of children playing mom and dad roles with each other, except these aging fetuses are famous and highly revered by the masses and live pretty comfy lives, I repeat, on your dime.  Take their model and make them a hundred times more floofy and wealthier and you get the Hollywood types.  People of the world!  Stop watching movies and read books.  Read world history!

899846,3,6304574657,"Andrei Tarkovsky is one of my favorite directors, and his movie Andrei Rublev is probably my favorite movie.  I also really like some of his other movies like The Mirror, Solaris, and Stalker.  But I don't like The Sacrifice or Nostalghia as much, and the reason is Erland Josefson.  I just don't enjoy watching his characters in either movie.  The film work by Tarkovsky is excellent, and the movie contains some extremely beautiful scenes, such as the burning of the house.  But I just don't enjoy watching Erland Josefson, he comes across as pompous and conceited.  I just found his character to be too wearying and tiresome.

In Ingmar Bergman's movie Autumn Sonata (where Josefson also appears, but not in a leading role), Ingrid Bergman does an excellent job portraying a self obsessed main character that I enjoyed watching.  But in The Sacrifice, Josefson was not able to achieve this.

I think the epitome of the way he acts is in the scenes where Josefson is talking to his son.  His son is temporarily unable to talk because of a medical operation, so the scenes are just a monologue from Josefson.  The film work is beautiful in these scenes, and I love the long takes.  I think I have to split the blame between both the actor and the writer for these monologues being so frustrating to watch.  It's not just the way that the monologues are delivered, the content of the monologues really forces him to be conceited and these lines cannot be delivered in a more humble way.  The monologues are very philosophical, and the entire movie is definitely an artistic philosophical movie.

If you're new to Tarkovsky, please pick a different movie as your introduction to this wonderful director.  If you're not new to Tarkovsky, then I think this movie is worth a try, and I hope that you're able to appreciate it more than I was.",1420848000,5,1837,4.69375
899847,5,6304574657,"I have not seen this remastered edition so my comments pertain to the film in general.  Tarkovsky made many great films, but this is my favorite of the lot.  Like most film makers whose work I find particularly compelling I think it is fair to say that much of what Tarkovsky does in his films intentionally subverts things that most people commonly expect a movie to do: particularly entertain at a peppy pace.  Of all his films this one is the most accessible, but it still confounds conventional expectations of action and plot.  In that regard I can see why there are folks who are put off.  When I first saw a Tarkovsky film  ""The"" Stalker in what I recall as a very dark print  I really didn't get it.  I'm still not sure I ""get it"", but I've come to love this artist's vision even when I'm confounded by it.

There is a documentary included with the film that is very interesting and will probably help most people to see some things in the film that they might otherwise not notice.",1417737600,2,990,4.395604395604396

I'm ecstatic that Tarkovsky films are making their way stateside in HD, but you can't help but feel that the transfer would have been handled better by a distributor like Criterion, who knows how to restore films without such destructive tinkering.",1332892800,38,660,5.480392156862745
900009,5,6304574657,"Tarkovsky's last film is made in Sweden. At the heart of the film is the relationship between a father and his son. The background is the cold war fear of nuclear annhilation. The isolated setting on the coast draws out these fears. As well as Alexander and his son, the cast includes the mother, who is an actress who has left England, and a doctor who carries a pistol in his bag and hypodermic needles which are useful to allay the fears of the women and the boy after a television broadcast announcing the beginning of World War Three. The sound of screaming jets flying low overhead punctuate the film at regular intervals. The postman, who likes to discuss Nietzsche, suggests to Alexander that if he sleeps with his maid, a witch, the world can be saved. Alexander believes in his torment that this is, in fact, the only way to save the world. He dabbles in the arts and philosophy and quotes a Buddhist text as he and his son plant a tree at the start of the film. At the end of the film, Alexander burns down the house and is taken to hospital. His madness is complete. The sense of crisis, however, seems to have passed but their story is offset by black and white images of chaos; streets filled with burning cars and a crowd of people running in random directions. These interludes, filmed by Sven Nykvist, are poetic renditions of desolation and despair that give the film a beautiful but haunting quality.",1326672000,,1419,4.525291828793774
900010,4,6304574657,"I'm not a learned film buff, so I'm not going to try to add anything of value here regarding the artistic qualities of Tartovsky's final film. I very much enjoyed it, though some pre-reading to get a background on Tartovsky's intent and motivations may be in order to be able to fully appreciate the film while you are experiencing it. I think Tartovsky assumed his viewers to have a certain baseline of familiarity with certain themes and literary allusions; my caution is that the film does not stand on its own in the same way that many other cerebral art house flicks do. It is probably best appreciated in context, at least from my point of view.

I do want to make a strong recommendation that anyone interested in viewing this film get a DVD copy instead of watching it through streaming. I watched it through Amazon's streaming service and there were several instances throughout this film where the film would jump forward and backward, either skipping sections of the film or going back to previously played sections. What was interesting, though, was that there were significant quality differences in the film stock and sound volume that occurred with at least half of these jumps. I was lead to wonder if somehow multiple archival copies were utilized to make the digital copy, or if this was a reflection of the ""unfinished"" nature of the film. I have played several films through streaming and never had a problem, so I doubt it was an isolated problem with my connection or computer. With films as complex as Tartovsky's, these distractions can really derail the viewing experience and detract from the art as it was intended to be viewed.",1321315200,,1655,4.786713286713287
900011,5,6304574657,"If you are serious in exploring cinema, I advise you NOT to see this film. Things will no longer be the same again for you; great films that you admire and haunt you will all vanish into thin air. I saw ""The Sacrifice"" several years ago and cannot escape its witchcraft gravity. This is definitely the apex of movie making and will stay there perhaps for hundreds of year till another prophet-Tarkovsky walks the surface of the earth again. This is a collusion to make you a captive. Tarkovsky IS a witch, a male Circe.

Before I go into the analysis of this work, I will say a few words on the side of the implementation of this film. The actors are superb. Erland Josephson, the protagonist, surpasses himself in a difficult role. No praise can do justice to his achievement here. Maria (Gudrun Gisladottir) is excellent. On her face you can see the sorcerer and the divine, the inchoate mother of  mankind. Allan Edwall (Otto, the postman) is memorable.

Photography here breaks new grounds in cinematography (Sven Nykvist). What could have been a more appropriate setting than the melancholic, desolate Scandinavian landscape! No tricks of zooming in and out, of rapid succession of images. Just sit and watch the same plateau for many minutes, spellbound. Bach and the Japanese music that recur several times are the soul of the film. More than the plot, more than the visual imagery they convey Tarkovsky's message. Prayer, supplication, surrender, desolation, terror.

There is no third world war, there is no little man, thee is no postman, no doctor, no women, no house is set to fire. There is only one man, Alexander and Maria, the spiritual, God or what you want it to be.

This is a psychoanalytic (not an intellectual) regression into man's origins and his annihilation in them. This movie is the horror movie of all time. Salvation and requiem is to be found after man crosses the border into insanity and beyond, to surrender to the annihilating forces of the divine.

There is symbolism everywhere, difficult to grasp even if one is a psychoanalyst. With the passage of time, after having viewed this film many times and spent much time thinking, you not only decipher pieces of this mysterious work, but also find changes in yourself. Is this, perhaps, why we see movies?

This film is not about an impeding holocaust, a third world war and a man turning to God to save the world, making a personal promise for a sacrifice. Remember this is Tarkovsky, the poet. The plot is a dream, hardly anything is what it appears to be. I am shocked to read even serious critics attempting to analyze this film as if it was a serial, applying common logic to understand to plot. Primary process, gentlemen!

Few things have touched me more profoundly than ""The Sacrifice"", and Wagner's ""Der Ring des Nibelungen"".

I will venture to give newcomers to Tarkovsky  some clues into the symbolism and nature of characters of this work, in the hope that this may give you a good start in your, hopefully, long journey in Tarkovsky's world.  I am, of course,  aware that I may be committing a crime in misguiding you, who knows...

The little boy is the unconscious of the main character. The mailman is an agent that allows for communication between the unconscious and awareness and daylight logic that can be verbalized. The women are feminine parts of the male soul of the protagonist. The house set on fire is the destruction of the man made psychological component of ourselves (the ego?).

A breakdown of the borders of his psyche takes place (when Little Man attacks Alexander) and fear floods his conscious mind. Primitive material, ancient horrors break loose and cause infinite anguish. The biological self (the postman who has the map of the world as it previously was) directs the protagonist to salvation, Maria's house, where the divine part of man fuses with the collective divine and finds ""requiem"" in annihilating itself, while the carnal part runs demented and is arrested by the ""sane"" authorities of our world.

A deeply disturbing, frightfully pessimistic story.

900012,5,6304574657,"For one of the finest filmmakers of the 20th Century, Andrei Tarkovsky worked on one final film before he died of lung cancer, the film was ""offret"" (""The Sacrifice"") which he shot back in 1984.

The Russian filmmaker is known for cinema masterpiece such as ""Ivan's Childhood"", ""Andrei Rublev"", ""Solaris"", ""The Mirror"", ""Nostalghia"" to name a few.

Films that were characterized by spirituality and metaphysical themes, Tarkovsky was not too concerned with the dramatic structure or plot but mainly about the universe within man.  He is also known for his distinct style of cinematography and even impressed another of the world's finest cinematographers, Ingmar Bergman.

Bergman said of Tarkovsky, ""Tarkovsky for me is the greatest [director], the one who invented a new language, true to the nature of film, as it captures life as a reflection, life as a dream.""

Interesting enough, his final film ""The Sacrifice"" would showcase Tarkovsky's appreciation for Ingmar Bergman and the film would be shot in Sweden and would star Erland Johnson (of Bergman's ""Scenes from a Marriage""), Anna Asp (Production Designer for Bergman's ""Fanny and Alexander"") and would feature one of the finest cinematographer's Sven Nykvist (Bergman's cinematographer for films such as ""Fanny and Alexander"", ""Through a Glass Darkly"", ""The Silence"", ""Persona"", ""Cries and Whispers"", ""Scenes from a Marriage"", ""Black Moon"" and ""The Virgin Spring"", Roman Polanski's ""The Tenant"" and Louis Malle's ""Black Moon"" to name a few).  In fact, Bergman's son Danny Bergman also worked as a camera assistant.

The film would win a Grand Prix and FIPRESCI PRIZE at the 1986 Cannes film Festival and would be regarded as Tarkovsky's final masterpiece.

And now, ""The Sacrifice"" will be released in a remastered edition on Blu-ray courtesy of KINO International and will also include a DVD of Michael Leszcylowski's documentary ""Directed by Andrei Tarkovsky"" which showcases Tarkovsky working on the ""The Sacrifice"" featuring interviews and extracts from Tarkovsky's book ""Sculpting in Time"" and more.

For the documentary ""Directed by Andrei Tarkovsky"", the documentary features a behind-the-scenes look at Tarkovsky and him working on the set.  Seeing him wanting the look and feel to be right with production design, wanting to capture various scenes that he has envisioned and working with his talent and cinematographer via translator.  In one scene, for the final shot, the camera jammed and while producers felt they could edit the scene to make things look right, Tarkovsky was a man of little compromise and eventually, a home that was burned down was rebuilt in days in order to reshoot that final scene.

The documentary also shows us an Andrei Tarkovsky, bedridden due to his cancer but still working on the film and communicating with his cinematographer Sven Nykvist and watching his wife talk about her husband's work.  The documentary by Michal Lesczylowsi and the Swedish Film Institute tries to show us the filmmaker and his thinking process while making the film and giving us insight of Tarkovsky's mindset at the time and his view towards his cinema and life.

VIDEO:

""The Sacrifice"" is presented in 1080p  High Definition (1:66:1) and the film is hauntingly beautiful.  Visually mesmerizing and one magnificent collaboration between Tarkovsky and Bergman's cinematographer Sven Nykvist.  The film is desaturated, blacks and whites tend to dominate the film, while outdoors, the look and feel of the outdoors looks bleak or dreamlike.  Because of the look of the film, many viewers often debated about the film's reality vs. dream/nightmare.

Is everything we are looking at in reality or something that is within the mind of Alexander?  It was a look and feel that Tarkovsky wanted and to accomplish that look, color and black-and-white duplicate negatives were struck from the color camera negative and combined in an optical printer to produce the saturation for those scenes.  The overall look of the outdoors, especially towards the first half of the film is quite eery and ethereal as we see trees that are black, in fact, even the shadows indoors looks quite eery as we can barely see the faces of individuals in which shadows cover their faces and making them look quite brooding.

But the cinematography is so wonderful to look at on Blu-ray and while there are scenes, especially during the black moments of the film which you can see a few speckles and also a hint of edge enhancement.  But this is the definitive version of the film yet and if you thought the original DVD version showcased Nykvist's cinematography, one must see this film in HD.  Magnificent!

As for the documentary ""Directed by Andrei Tarkovsky"", this documentary was presented in DVD (full frame 1:33:1).  So, one can expect a similar transfer to the previous KINO DVD release.

AUDIO:

""The Sacrifice"" is presented in Swedish Linear PCM 2.0 and with optional English subtitles.  I did notice occasional clicks and pops during the silent moments of the film but by no means does it distract from the film.  While the film is definitely dialogue-driven, I did notice certain scenes that do stand out, such as the sounds of the airplanes flying in the air, the crash of the milk container on the ground, leaves crunching and various ambiance still contained in the 2.0 front channel soundtrack.  Personally, I wanted the soundtrack to be much more immersive, so I did set my receiver to produce sound on all channels for a more immersive soundscape.  Even the music sounds wonderful!

As for ""Directed by Andrei Tarkovsky"", the documentaryis presented in 2.0 mono in Russian and Swedish with optional English subtitles.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""The Sacrifice: Remastered Edition"" comes with a DVD of the 99 minute documentary ""Directed by Andrei Tarkovsky"" plus past trailers of Kino Russian films and also a gallery of photos from ""The Sacrifice"" and ""Directed by Andrei Tarkosky"".

EXTRAS:

""The Sacrifice: Remastered Edition"" comes with a slipcase.

JUDGMENT CALL:

When it comes to Tarkovsky films, I look at these films as magnificent cinema from a filmmaker who tries to escape the banality of traditional cinema by doing things his own way, his vision, his style, no compromises.

From trademark Tarkovsky, the films opening discussion and tracking shot between Alexander, his son and Otto lasts for nine-and-a-half minutes and the final shot that involves Alexander takes six-and-a-half minutes.  There are not many filmmakers who would be able to get away that but with Tarkovsky, we know he loves long takes.

When watching ""The Sacrifice"", it's easy to get lost in the film's beautiful cinematography but if you go deeper, there are things that make you wonder about the film and how personal the film was for Tarkovsky.

It's one thing to have Tarkovsky's style of filmmaking and his passion of paying attention to the conflict of man but at the same time, we know that like the main protagonist Alexander, Tarkovsky was also sick and had cancer and would later succumb to the cancer in 1986.

The film goes into ""unfinished"" works of Da Vnci (""The Adoration of the Magi"") Bach's aria ""Erbarme dich"" from Bach's ""St. Matthew Passion"" and were these integrated into the film just in case something was to happen to Tarkovsky and this film could have been ""unfinished""?  For one, we do know that the final scene of the film, without a major scene that involved Alexander, in Tarkovsky's mind, it was a pivotal scene that was lost due to the camera's mechanical failure and it would have made ""The Sacrifice"" in his mind, not complete.  But thanks to his producers, they were able to rebuild a house and reshoot the scene.

But what struck me about ""The Sacrifice"" was not its plot, its how the characters were utilized for the shot.  Tarkovsky has always been a filmmaker who has talked about not wanting to focus so much on the dramatic events of the plot but more of the psyche of the characters.

In one scene, we see the maid Maria asking if her boss Adelaide needs anything done before she goes.  And we see Adelaide say not much but then begins to add one thing after the other.  Maria has this look in her eyes as she talks directly to the camera, to the audience.  Almost like a touch of Godard-esque filmmaking but in this case, the efficacy of the scene felt quite eery, angry.

Go to the another scene involving the character of Adelaide reacting to news about World War II and there is no escape.  Actress Susan Fleetwood crumbles into hysteria and it was a scene that was for me, quite surprising.  Is Adelaide over-hysterical or is this more personal as Tarkovsky's second wife Larisa has been written to have had her fair share of hysterics.

And then there are memorable scenes from the jar of milk crashing down on the floor, Alexander's teen daughter and seeing her silhouette of her walking naked, Otto collapsing after explaining his life's work and the expression of everyone when he tells them that an evil spirit has pushed him down.

And of course, the cinematography of the trees...saturated, black upon a white/gray background.  A scene of a burning house in flames.  A scene of levitation.  There are many scenes that stick out in my mind that made ""The Sacrifice"" so enjoyable and unique in its own way.

Combine these scenes with philosophy (which adds to another element of replay value for this film) and visual art, ""The Sacrifice"" is indeed a film that is another masterpiece for Andrei Tarkovsky.

Those familiar with Tarkovsky's work and those who appreciate cinema (especially those who enjoy Ingmar Bergman's work) will find ""The Sacrifice"" to be a wonderful film while those who are used to formulaic, traditional style of storytelling may find ""The Sacrifice"" too artistic for their liking.

As for the Blu-ray release, if you enjoyed this film before, you'll definitely enjoy it in HD as it looks much better than its previous DVD-counterpart.  In fact, the film looks stunning on Blu-ray and I was impressed by how much better it looked compared to the original DVD release.

And while I know there are new fans of Tarkovsky who probably began with the recent Blu-ray release of ""Solaris"", may find this Blu-ray release to their liking, especially with the added inclusion of the documentary ""Directed by Andrei Tarkovsky"".  The additional inclusion of the documentary is a major plus and definitely makes this Blu-ray release a must-own for any cineaste.

""The Sacrifice"" is the final film from a great filmmaker.  And while it may not be Andrei Tarkovsky's most accessible film for the masses, it's truly of of his finest films ever created and is indeed another masterpiece in his oeuvre.  Highly recommended!

Andrei Tarkovksy's final film, completed from his death bed as he died from lung cancer, is perhaps his most philosophically complex, and shows him at the height of his powers as a filmmaker.  With cinematographer Sven Nykvist, the Ingmar Bergman favorite, Tarkovsky created some remarkably subtle and beautiful and provocative imagery, that cannot help but unsettle the viewer, and raise questions about the relative merits of intellect and conviction, of individuality and community, of realism and superstition.

900096,3,6304574657,"Watching Russian film director Andrei Tarkovsky's final 1986 film, The Sacrifice (Offret Sacrificatio), is an exercise in cinema appreciation; not because it is a great film, but because it has great moments and moments of sheer monotonous boredom. It is one of those rare films that goes to the antipodes of what is good and bad in that art form. Overall, it's a film worth seeing, but it is in no way, shape, nor form a great film; much less a masterpiece. Tarkovsky, who had fled the Soviet Union, filmed The Sacrifice in Sweden, using Swedish actors- including Erland Josephson, the star of many Ingmar Bergman films, and used Bergman's longtime cinematographer Sven Nykvist, as well. This was a wise choice, as The Sacrifice is one of the more arresting visual works anyone is likely to see onscreen, especially in its interesting choice of medium shots as the dominant frame, or mis-en-scene. Yet, where the film falters is by, instead of maximizing the positive traits of Tarkovsky and the Bergman contingent, the film brought out the worst elements of Tarkovsky and Bergman. As example, Tarkovsky wrote the screenplay, and like most Tarkovsky films, The Sacrifice is long (142 minutes on the Kino DVD), but it lacks all of the subtle poesy in earlier Tarkovsky films (Solaris, Stalker) and instead indulges on overwrought scenes of terror and regret. There are early scenes where philosophic banter occurs, but the last three quarters of the film is filled with some astonishingly bad acting, which has to be laid at the feet of Tarkovsky. Bergman, who was possibly the greatest screenwriter of the Twentieth Century, was always concise in his screenplays. However, whereas that strength of Bergman is ignored, Bergman's greatest weakness is employed, and that is a relentlessly depressing view of life and the characters. One knows from the beginning that they are all doomed, and, save for the youngest character in the film, this comes to fruition, although, this is only so if one renders the most positive interpretation of the film possible. In all other ways, that ending is likely a delusion, which means Bergmanian dourness combines with a dearth of Tarkovskian poesy to make the film dark, despairing, and oftentimes dull.",1283299200,3,2240,5.040431266846361
900097,5,6304574657,"""The Sacrifice"" (1986) was directed by Andrei Tarkovsky (Solaris,The Stalker). Tarkovsky's films are introspective, and progress slowly without much plot, focusing on the development of the thoughts and feelings of the characters as they pass through time. In ""The Sacrifice"" Tarkovsky tells the story of a group of Swedish people living in relative isolation, on an island, who have their tranquil lives interrupted with news of a invasion. We never see the invaders, but we see how this event disrupts and terrorizes this group of people who react in various ways to what they perceive as the end of their existence. The movie blends an ever increasing number of dream sequences into the story as Alexander (Erland Josephson) slowly begins to loose his mind. Alexander eventually is willing to do anything to end the invasion, including sacrificing his family. The film reveals how people react to events that are essentially beyond their control, and how this lack of control sometimes manifests itself into madness, and into a world of the irrational.

The movie was shot in Sweden on the island of Gotland, where many of Ingmar Bergman's films had been shot, and was shot by Bergman's favourite cinematographer Sven Nykvist. This DVD is in colour, and in Swedish with English subtitles in widescreen, and runs at 145 minutes.

The film looks good in this dvd release, though as others have noted the colors seem a bit muted and shadow details are lost, especially inside.  I have seen this twice projected from a 35mm print and even where the print I saw was somewhat damaged I remember it to have been more vibrant in the color scenes and more detailed in black and white.  I understand there are better dvd transfers of this film available elsewhere (notably the Swedish version), but this is much better than the older VHS version and as good as it is likely to get in the United States unless Criterion is able to take it on (there are rumors), and even in this version it's hard to miss the power of the visuals and the richness of the ideas raised by the film.

900099,5,6304574657,"It may not sound like the best way to spend over two hours of your time, but ""The Sacrifice,"" (famed Russian director Tarkovsky's last film) shoots his film to perfection.  Drawing from the pensiveness of Bergman, Tarkovsky also vividly shows some shattering emotional scenes when a birthday celebration turns from mirth to terror as a household faces the spectre of what one can assume is possible nuclear annihilation from World War III.  The acting is often superb and the intensity of some of the scenes is tangible (in a way that made it's nearby predecessor ""The Day After"" in America seem provincial.)

The contrasts are brilliantly drawn:  From surreal dream vignettes to horribly vivid scenes of destruction and despair, 'The Sacrifice' both encompasses a myopic and comprehensive vision of what it means to face the terror of violence when it swoops it's unwelcome way into people's lives  and when they're least expecting it.  I was struck by some of scenes which painted in small landscapes what one would normally expect from a broad brush.

In the special features we see the making of this masterpiece.  Sometimes it tediously goes into every detail, but that merely shows the director's perfectionism.  More worthwhile are some of the philosophical renderings which underscore the thoughts and processes of the director.  (It clocks in at 1:41, but the movie itself is 2:22 minutes long.)

Finally, some of these thoughts may be apt for giving some insight into the film and the director:  ""I am not interested in the development of the plot in the chain of events...I have always been interested in a person's inner world, and for me it was far more natural to make a journey into the psychology that informed the hero's attitude to life into the literary and cultural traditions that are the foundation of his spiritual world...I am interested in man, for he contains a universe within himself...""

As a tribute to fellow filmmaker Ingmar Bergman, Tarkovsky choose to work with a Swedish-language script, bring onboard Bergman's renowned cinematographer Sven Nykvist, and give Swedish actor and Bergman favourite Erland Josephsson the lead role.

The setup of the movie is fairly simple: the former thespian and university lecturer Alexander has withdrawn to a Swedish island, spending his days musing on the brokenness of creation and the cruelty of mankind. His only joy is his young son (a mainly silent part, as the child is recovering from tonsil surgery). Alexander's daughter, his ex-wife, her new lover, and his two servant girls are at hand for Alexander's birthday celebrations. But the festivities are interrupted by a horrific development: the outbreak of a nuclear war, turning the world outside their island to ruin. Faced with this apocalypse and the dangers to his son, Alexander prays to God that God reverse it, promising to give up his entire life and all that brings him happiness to save those he holds dear.

This is auteur cinema, and like the works of Bergman and the 60s greats, OFFRET may appeal to a minority of typical filmgoers. The initial half of the film is powered mainly by dialogue, and the baroque statements that Tarkovsky gives to his characters may not be to all tastes. I, however, rather enjoyed them, as they are suggestive of the theatre of the absurd written by such playwrights as Beckett and Pinter. We find interspersed, however, strikingly surreal shots that provide a release from the main action at the same time that they comment on it (am I the only one who gets a hint of Beckett's ""Breath"" in the street scene?). The turning point of the film, as Alexander goes through a dream-like sexual encounter, is sure to baffle viewer at first.

*However*, the climax of the film elegantly reveals the purpose behind all the mysterious moments before, tying the drama up in a coherent and downright touching way that will satisfy the skeptics. Even if you hate auteur films, I encourage you to watch this film and hold on through the end. I like how the closing of the film features a long uninterrupted shot which mirrors the long interrupted shot of the beginning, and both are among Sven Nykvist's finest achievements.",1221091200,3,2383,4.9525
900101,5,6304574657,"Hey, where was Bergman during the shooting of this? It's a peculiar film that way. It's made in Sweden, the main actor is one of Bergman's primary actors of the time, the cinematographer is Bergman's favored cinematographer, and where's the location? Bergman's island? While watching the film I kept wondering if Ingmar had something to do with it somewhere. It might work as an homage to Bergman's style, and there are some strong similarities that come to mind with Bergman's ""Through a Glass Darkly""--the setting, foghorns, visions, insanity, a relationship with God, sacrifice. If you like this one and haven't seen that one, go watch it and see what I mean. You won't be disappointed. ""Through a Glass Darkly"" conjures up one of the most chilling images you'll ever hear.

As for this movie, well...what can you say? It's genius at work...obviously. Any attempt at critical analysis would require a lot of time of re-watching and consideration and investigation. I'd not want to pretend I yet have an informed appreciation of someone's vision which is so highly developed and complex, but I know art and genius when I see it. Actually, many geniuses--director, cameraman, actors--that put this film together. You don't like the word genius? Use your own word--savante, master, visionary, pioneer, etc.--but these are obviously artists at the top of their field and top of their form at work here. No it's not the Mona Lisa of films, but it's by some Leonardos, and ""Leonardo always terrifies me.""

What's cool about the DVD is it's got a film of Tarkovsky making this film and some exposition of his philosophy and cinematic concepts which will help you grasp the depth of his vision. You'll get some thoughts on the artistic process from the man himself which will linger with you, possibly forever.

If you have a grasp of the poetic, and intelligent, cinematic aesthetic, you'll like this one. Nykvist is at his prime here behind the camera and Tarkovsky is ruthless in his evocation of true expression. The acting is all spot on, and the last scene is a memorable wonder to behold.

What does it say about our civilization that many of the most highly acclaimed films in history are ""no longer available?"" Maybe we've entered the Dark Ages again.",1218672000,,2255,4.910761154855643

900103,4,6304574657,"Tarkovsky's relatively early death robbed us of one of our greatest film makers.  ""The Sacrifice"" was his final film, directed after Tarkovsky had been diagnosed with what he knew was his final illness.  In the film, which he originally planned to entitle ""The Witch,"" Tarkovsky clearly wants both to help himself make sense of the ending he's personally facing, and to invite viewers to think about the existential issues raised by mortality in general.

The film's plot is simply told, although there's nothing at all simple about the actual film.  Friends and family gather at a remote house to celebrate the author/actor Alexander's birthday.  Shortly afterwards, nuclear missiles fly over the house, and the television, before going dead, announces that a nuclear war has erupted.  In despair, Alexander prayerfully promises to sacrifice everything if the war can be averted.  He sleeps with a local witch, an action that is supposed to bring wishes true, and at the film's end he burns down his home and is hauled off to a madhouse.  The war seems to have been averted--indeed, time seems to have slipped backwards following Alexander's sacrifice, obliterating the opening nuclear salvo.

The film is visually beautiful, with the long shots characteristic of Tarkovsky's cinematography, perfect compositions in individual scenes, chiaroscuro throughout, delicate almost pastel colors alternating with deep, dark shadows.  The acting is also good, especially Erland Josephson's portray of Alexander.  And the script is intriguing in places, especially Alexander's opening monologue reflecting on the transcience of existence with his son, the ""Little Man.""  Given that Tarkovsky dedicated the film to his own son, it's not outlandish to suppose that the opening scenes were intended as Tarkovsky's parting message to his own ""Little Man.""

The film's themes are both intriguing and important.  What does it mean for the world to end?  Such an ending is quite different from an individual's death, but in what ways?  What's the connection between spiritual and physical death?  What does it mean to make a sacrifice?  If we offer up a sacrifice for the sake of others, do we ever really quite understand what we're getting ourselves into?  Is the sacrifice that's actually exacted what we intended it to be?

But despite all this, the film is flawed.  Too much is crammed into it--it's as if Tarkovsky, knowing he was running out of time, pulled together in one movie everything that he'd hoped to have a lifetime to say.  What he does say here is worth hearing, especially because his own death imparts a realworld melancholy to a melancholic cinematic theme.  But as a stand alone work of art, ""The Sacrifice"" isn't in the same league as, for example, his ""Andrei Rublev"" or ""Solaris.""",1214697600,,2791,5.153333333333333
900104,5,6304574657,"There is no simple answer, no simple review or ""reading"" of this film which can be proven to be correct. Indeed, this film requires you to think and provide your own answers. All great works of art are like this, I think.

Background information is very important in this case: Tarkovsky was dying of cancer while he shot this film. He completed the shooting, but did not live to see the final copy.

Be prepared to devote some time and energy in order to appreciate was this film has to offer.",1176681600,,494,4.417582417582418
900105,4,6304574657,"I do love Tarkovsky (as many who know me will attest), and I do like The Sacrifice very, very much.  It has some astounding, memorable sequences in it.  It has evocative use of Ebarme Dich, Mein Gott from Bach's St. Matthew Passion (one of Tarkovsky's favorite composers and one of his favorite musicial pieces), excellent performances (even more remarkable when you take into account he shot the film in Swedish, not his native tongue), and beautiful cinematography (by the late Sven Nykist, Ingmar Bergman's cinematographer for many years).  However, I can't help but feel that there's something missing, something incomplete about it.  I want to say it's an undisputed masterpiece, but I cannot honestly say that.  Even though I believe the film is meant to be ambiguous, sometimes it's just confusing.  Perhaps this is because the original script was simply about Alexander going off with Maria, giving up everything he had for her, to live a simple life.  This script was called The Witch, and was written in 1981.  Then Tarkovsky incorporated other things (like nuclear war), and the film became something else, though not necessarily better.  The confusion leaves me with a feeling of ""almost a masterpiece"".

There are many great shots in this film, such as the 9 1/2 minute opening take (Tarkovsky's longest shot), the scene when the nuclear bombs fly overhead, the scene where Alexander prays, the opening credits scene, and the legendary house burning scene near the end of the film.  It is not the last scene of the film, as some critics have said, and it's not the longest take Tarkovsky ever shot.  It runs 6 1/2 minutes, and it was eclipsed by the opening shot, which is the longest take Tarkovsky ever shot.  In the house burning scene, it seems comical at times, all the running in and out, but it's still amazing to behold, at least techinically.  The first time they shot this, the camera jammed and the house continued to burn.  There was only one camera on tracks, and the camera failed.  Tarkovsky was devastated.  But the crew somehow managed to rebuild the house in two weeks, and the scene was reshot, this time with TWO cameras on tracks, running parallel to each other.

There is a wonderful documentary shot by the editor of The Sacrifice entitled Directed by Andrei Tarkovsky.  It's one of many documentaries about Tarkovsky, but it's the only one where he was actually present during the shooting (discounting Voyage in Time, a TV film he did for Italian TV which he co-wrote and co-directed with Tonio Guerra, the great Italian screenwriter), and it's fascinating to watch.  It's nice that Kino included this on the DVD, because their transfer of The Sacrifice is way too bright, so the inclusion of the documentary makes up for the poor transfer.  Many of the scenes were supposed to be shot in the dark, so to speak.  The DVD is still worth buying, but the transfer is not correct at all.

Overall, a great film, but not Andrei's best.  The Sacrifice is not an awful film, it's not even close, but it's disappointing when compared to Tarkovsky's magnificent track record previous to this film.",1157673600,,3126,4.832706766917293
900171,5,6304574657,"In decades of movie going and collecting, only a few films keep coming to mind at unexpected moments.  For me, this is what great art does; that is, it becomes a part of one's experience and not just a momentary diversion.

THE SACRIFICE is such a film.  It touches on the most fundamental questions of being a human in our post-modern world.  And it does it with extraordinary grace and a sublime, haunting, beauty.  For me, it is a transcendent and hypnotic masterpiece.  What cinema aspires to but seldom achieves.

To miss the point of this film, as some reviewers have, or to call it sophomoric, as others do, is to admit one's own inability to consider that life itself may hold a greater meaning and that we are more than an accidental fluke in a cold, uncaring universe.

This film dares to use its considerable art to challenge us like a zen koan and a prayer.  It is a meditation on what it means to be fully human and mortal and moral.  It asks us to wonder at the unknown and it weeps that we are prisoners of our humanity -- and that we hold the fate of our planet in our hands.

All this sounds kind of pretentious, I know, but this magnificent yet simple film works on a higher level than most movies.  It's not easily categorized.  But on a big screen, I was mesmerized by the extraordinary cinematography and equally transported by the subtle ideas.  It was a profound and provoactive movie going experience that I didn't expect and one that has remained vivid as the years pass.",1139702400,7,1496,4.452205882352941

900173,5,6304574657,"I read a number of the reviews on this film and felt the need to respond to the dismissive ones.

Tarkovsky's films - for me The Sacrifice and Andrei Rublev are his crowning achievements (with Ivan's Childhood as the shortest and most accessible of his great films)- these films should be recognised as some of the most important works within any medium of art in the last century.

So, if you want to watch a film to escape, to entertain, to work as background music to re-runs of your own psychic heritage, it is NOT advisable to get this one out one tired evening.

Watching Tarko is hard work - principally aesthetic, emotional, spiritual and creative work for the individual viewer.  All great art transforms our relationship with the world, and I would argue that this sort of transformation is never crucially an intellectual change.  We may be confronted with ideas through Art but it is their broader resonance within our whole humanity that is the key to Art's power and importance.

I have seen The Sacrifice five times over the last 15 or so years.  At the beginning of the film there is the question ""what is your relationship with god?""

The film for me is the most personal, honest and often uncomfortable (nightmarish?) contemporary meditation on this single question.  [For those fellow T-freaks out there the Director himself fronts up to this theme within the ""Making of The Sacrifice"" documentary - it is especially poignant in the knowledge of his approaching early death soon after the release of this film].

All I can say to viewers out there that think that Tarko is just another foreign film-maker dealing in dark, overly-intellectual and pretentious symbolic imagery for mass consumption by arts students, well... I dare you to be completely open to the film.

p.s. forget looking for the beginning, middle and end - that western over-obsession with narrative - the line of thought that tells the audience when to cry, clap or stand-up at the ""end."" Yes, forget for once a focus  on events - instead, look, listen, taste, touch and smell that thing the English language calls Art.

The first shots with the dying tree symbolizes the painful spiritual state of the contemporanean civilization . Tarkovsky applies  in this moment what you might be call the little stage of the world , with characters who are at the same time real and symbolic . Adelaide is an unsatisfied woman married in a convenience marriage . Victor is the disenchant scientist with clear echoes of Stalker -1979- (the previous film to Nostalgia) and Martha , the blossom girl lost in her own narcissism.

When the atomic attack occurs , Tarkovsky sets his characters in the edge of the knife . Hysteria and terror oppose to desperation . Alexander breaks his inner barriers and he is opened to the trascendence . These are two times of biblical references .

Finally you have to keep your word and the holocaust will come . Bitter metaphor : Tarkovsky seems to revel us there is no place for the trascendentalism in the present world.

But the last sequence is loaded with a deep sense of redemption . The child recovers the language and stood in front of the dying tree he begins to irrigate it with the inquiring statement : In the ancient times the verb was , and with the Bach music ( Mattheus Passion ) the camera climbs the tree and links with Leonard painting , the true icon od adoration and offering .

Tarkovsky is back in this way to his goal and the method of all his artistic and religious  cosmovision.

There is some music as well, but not the sounds of sweeping violins, rather the dramatic and eerie and mournful sound of a Japanese flute.  The film is dedicated to the film maker's son ""with hope and confidence"" yet deals with the end of the world as it is under nuclear attack.  Beginning and ending with the young seven year old son of the protaganist planting then watering a lone tree, the film deals with the machinations of a family, its affairs, desires, disappointments and how it reacts to the catastrophic news of nuclear war.

After first viewing, I found the picture confusing and hard to grasp.  But, unlike ""The Mirror,"" on subsequent viewing I realized that the reason that it is confusing and hard to grasp is that Tarkovsky has created a self-indulgent film based upon the amalgam of two different scripts that he had written.  I don't think that he himself was clear on what he wanted to say, and I don't think he was concerned if the viewer is clear either.  Perhaps this is because he knew this was his final film?  Once again, though, the graphic images in the film are stunning, and his use of light, shadow, and reflections is genius.
But what makes the DVD eminently worth purchasing is the documentary ""Directed by Tarkovsky"" which is added as a bonus feature.  The documentary shows the  making of ""The Sacrifice"" (which does shed a little light on what he was trying to say) and it's fascinating to watch Tarkovsky at work.

900177,5,6304574657,"...that seems to be the opinion of some reviewers.  This film - Tarkovsky's final work - is certainly more accessible than his others, more straightforward in its storytelling...but there's a lot of wonderful elements involved, and it certainly doesn't deserve to be relegated to the 'minor works' category.  Other reviewers have also drawn comparisons between this film and the work of Swedish director Ingmar Bergman - there is some of Bergman's 'look' to the film, perhaps because Tarkovsky chose to work with Sven Nykvist, who worked on several of Bergman's films.  Even with this 'Bergmanesque' presence, this is definitely Tarkovsky's film - and if it's more accessible than some of his other works, perhaps it's a good place for someone who is unfamiliar with his work to start.
Several of Tarkovsky's favorite themes are present in SACRIFICE - alienation, an aching emptiness of the spirit, the slighting of nature by mankind.  Erland Josephson portrays Alexander, a wealthy, semi-retired writer who lives with his wife, teenage daughter and 'Little Man', his young son, in a lovely house that sits rather isolated on the seaside in Sweden.  His young son is obviously his favorite, the center of his soul and existence.  We see him with the little boy, planting a tree, telling him a story about devotion to duty involving a young Japanese monk and his master.
Alexander's birthday is at hand, and his family, along with a couple of friends, makes ready to celebrate.  As the group awaits dinner to be served, there is a roaring - like a low-flying jet - in the sky, followed by what appears at first to be a mild earthquake.  A ceramic milk pitcher vibrates its way off a shelf, shattering on the floor - news broadcasts on the television indicate that World War III has begun.  Each of the characters reacts in their own way - Alexander's wife falls to pieces and requires a sedative from their friend Victor, a doctor.  Alexander is shaken as well - but he's not sure what to do.  He has lost his faith several years before, and yet he finds himself begging God to reverse the horrible events unfolding on the television screen.  In one of the film's most poignant moments, we see him drained of strength, falling on his knees, barely able to speak, praying with all his might. He attempts to 'strike a bargain' with God, offering to give up everything - his home, his belongings, his family...even Little Man, his beloved son, if the world can be 'put back like it was before'.
In a conversation with his friend Otto, the postman, Alexander learns of Otto's suspicion that Maria, one of Alexander's servant girls, is a witch - and Otto suggests that if Alexander goes to Maria and sleeps with her, she has the power to reverse the horrible events.  In his desperation, Alexander succumbs to Otto's suggestion - he never voices his request to Maria, but she sees the pain in his eyes (and in his actions) and takes him to her bed in an attempt, I think, simply to comfort him.  This scene - like lovemaking scenes in all of Tarkovsky's films, when they occur - is photographed beautifully and tastefully.  Tarkovsky never stooped to gratuitous or graphic sex or nudity.  We see the couple lie down, embrace - and levitate, floating gently into the air, a lovely, tender visual rendition of the healing power of love.
You'll have to see the film in order to find out if Alexander's efforts - in either theatre - are rewarded.  I don't want to spoil anything for the potential viewer.  Suffice to say that even as the film ends, the viewer is left with as many questions as answers - and that's one of the things I find so stimulating and rewarding about Tarkovsky's work.  I can't give anything I've seen by this director less than five stars - and while this might not be quite on the same levels as his other films, it's still head and shoulders above the commercial films coming out of the major studios.",1064534400,30,3918,4.701754385964913

I would rank it amongst the best 5 films I have ever seen. The film is mysteriuos, haunting, slow paced, impecably filmed and acted. So many images remain in my mind. The woman who breaks down and has to be pacified by a tranquilizer, the haunting music associated with the witch that permeates throughout the movie, the long take as the house is burned etc etc. This is a truly great masterpiece.

900179,5,6304574657,"Cinema has had it's share of powerful directors. On that list goes Ingmar Bergman, Luchino Visconti, Bernardo Bertolucci, Martin Scorsese, Akira Kurosawa, and without little doubt the director of this film, Andrei Tarkovsky. Tarkovsky is a filmmaker who always make me feel dumb. I always feel he is saying something important, but, I'm just not smart enough to grasp what it is he is saying. I think he is a first rate story-teller. His films deal with strong emotions. But,of all of Tarkovsky's films this one is my favorite. Not only is it my favorite of Tarkovsky's films, it is also of the greatest films I've ever seen. And one of my ""top 10"" favorites. If there was only one Tarkovsky film I was allowed to watch over and over it would be ""The Sacrifice"", his final film.
 Much of this movie will not feel like a Tarkovsky film. It has elements of Ingmar Bergman. Perhaps that's why I enjoy it so much. But right from the very first shot. From the first words of dialogue. From the way the camera was set-up, everything just suggested Bergman to me. And I don't say this as a fault. ""The Sacrifice"" is a powerful moving film. That doesn't seem preachy or pretenious. It's emotions seem sincere. We connect with the characters.
 ""The Sacrifice"" tells the story of a man (Erland Josephson) who lives with his son and wife. Josephson is the kind of man who think society is in deep trouble. We are headed in a terrible direction. On the day of his birthday something awful happens. According to Josephson the beginning of WW3 has started. A nuclear threat has hit and Josephson feels it is now up to him the ultimate sacrifice to save his family and friends.
 ""The Sacrifice"" has so many sterling moments. So many moments that boast such power. Right now I am thinking of a scene dealing with Alexander (Erland Josephson) prays to God. The scene reminds me of the scene in ""The Seventh Seal"" where Max von Sydow asks God to show himself. Both scenes show man helpless turning to God for help. Cinematographer Sven Nykvist and Tarkovsky are able to capture such tenderness. There is a very intimate and personal tone played throughout the movie.
 Many may find to film hard to watch. They will say it moves to slow. That the movie doesn't seem to be about anything. It's just plain boring. But if you would only give the movie a chance you'll see this is one powerful absorbing film. It may even make some ask questions about themselves. For instance, would you offer the same sacrifice? As I said before, I feel this is Andrei Tarkovsky's best film. Please make an effort to see it.
 Bottom-line: One of the greatest films I've ever seen. Andrei Tarkovsky's masterpiece. There are only a few films where the human condition has been shown as powerful.",1054857600,4,2755,4.625766871165644

For me though, ""Solaris"" and ""Stalker"" remain the best expressions of his metaphysical vision.  ""The Sacrifice"" lends some of the most powerful visual effects from these earlier efforts to a gaggle of half-developed characters that never quite convinced me they deserved them. With the wonderful exception of the mysterious postman, Otto, the characters inhabit a muffled, haute-bourgeois world of spiritual angst and existential dread, with servants to clear the tea-things between musings.  Maybe Tarkovsky means to critique their privileged lives, but his sympathy for the main character, Alexander, is so clear as to make him seem like a stand-in for Tarkovsky himself.  Alexander's laments about our civilization's destructiveness, its violence against nature in search of a bland material comfort may very well be true, but as expressed in Alexander's monologues aren't they just a little . . . banal?
What stands out for me most about the movie is the pregnant sense of possibility that Tarkovsky infuses into even the most ordinary scenes.  The glacial, almost imperceptible movements of the camera, the wind riffling through grass or shawls or curtains, the haunting vibration of glasses--all insinuate the presence, or maybe just the barest possibility, of something like God.  Part of the movie's point seems to be to make you feel the sterility of life without that presence; an 'eternal recurrence' like Otto mentions at the beginning, in which the sense that our routine lives are a waiting for something higher never lifts.  Tarkovsky's gift as a director is to communicate visually that this waiting might have a purpose after all.  He has an extraordinary ability to turn everyday objects--chairs, eggs, a glass of water, a bare tree--into potential symbols, teetering on the edge of a meaning that never quite resolves into view or, if it does, threatens to pass you by in your impatience for something louder and more conclusive.  The hand-washing ritual and 'levitating love scene' with Maria didn't carry the redemptive power for me that Tarkovsky seemed to intend.  Instead, what I'll remember most vividly is the long, dreamy black-and-white 'strip' with the crashed car that recurs in Alexander's memory as an image of the concentrated destruction and panic of the whole troubled century.  Tarkovsky's Russian sense of salvation is turned up to full wattage here in his last movie:  one must be as a child to enter the kingdom, the intellect must learn to bow down to the infant and simple serving-woman, etc.--themes announced clearly in the opening shot of Leonardo's painting.  But finally it was the bleakness and monochrome despair that hit me most forcefully.  The hope this time felt a little tacked on.
Still, this movie is indispensable for an understanding of Tarkovsky.  It amplifies the images and ideas in his other movies and reveals them as parts of a haunting, brilliant whole.",1042156800,,3026,5.197530864197531

To give you an idea of how unusual this is, most films have an average shot length of less than ten seconds. There are no shot/reverse-shot cuts in _The Sacrifice_.
Many directors believe that the audience will grow restless unless their frame of reference constantly shifts. But with Tarkovsky, the longer you look, the more you see. A masterpiece.

""The Sacrifice"", his last - and most artful - project is, as all film by Tarkovsky, about the slowest and most long drawn one can choose to watch, thus making it a film that is not aimed at a populist audience. This is not a question of plot, it is a question of and cinematography, acting in line and in cohesion with environment, Nykvist's photography (some of the best he ever produced) and individuals, together making, art.
If this scares You, remember what You have read and know that this might not be a film for everyone.
If You know Tarkovsky You know what this ""film"" is all about, but remember to keep an open mind. It is one of those film that deserves multiple observations before You lay your preliminary verdict.
""The Sacrifice"" is not among the best films I have seen, but I can assure you that it is one, if not the most, beautiful. It is beyond points and grades, being that one seldom grades pieces of art.",1034985600,5,1552,4.392361111111111
900214,3,6304574657,"What can I say? Director of this film Andrei Tarkovsky (one of the best Russian directors) was already an immigrant at the time when he made this film. Soviet government made him leave his country. Same as ""Nostalgia"", this film shows how much he was heart. At the same time he was very sick and he didn't have much time left. He was in hurry ... you can tell. Used his cinematography from previous films but it didn't work.
Last 15 minutes - was a movie ""The Sacrifice"". The privies 2 hours? Just trying to put all his thoughts in one film.
If you want to se best films by Andrei Tarkovsky, go to : ""Stalker"", ""Solaris"", ""Andrei Rublev"", ""Mirror"".
Mr. Tarkovsky, I still think - you are the best! Your film ""Stalker"" changed my life.",1030924800,5,734,4.404411764705882
900215,4,6304574657,"I own this one on VHS and DVD, plus - saw the movie on the big screen when it was released back in 1986. Not going to waste your time describing the main feature - the Sacrifice. All other reviewers already did it justice. What I found astonishing was the freebee only available on DVD - the Sculpting in Time. If this DVD was sold 5 times as expensive without the featured Sacrifice - I still would have bought it just because of the added documentary! Don't get me wrong - the Sacrifice is clearly a masterpiece, there is no doubt about that! The lenghty addition, though, shows Tarkovsky in action - working with the actors and the crew. What came as a complete shock to me was that almost all of the thoroughly dogmatized, analyzed and explained ""jewels of genious directing"" - as one of the Figaro critics had put it, were pure improvisations! You can actually see Tarkovsky making it up (with a Swedish translator) as he went. Excellent interviews - with him and his wife (shot separately). You will definitely enjoy the great maestro screaming some extreme Russian obscenities (untranslated, of course) when the ambulance driver takes poor Erland Josephson in the wrong direction; or when the second camera power goes out while the house was burning to ashes in the very last scene - can't shoot it twice! Tarkovsky did not agree to an alternative ending and was about to proclaim the movie a failure. In the end, as it turned out, the scene was shot for the second time - the way he wanted it. The house was re-built for him. Some breath-taking last scenes shot in the hospital, on his death bed.
Making it short - don't miss out on this one - if you are a real Tarkovsky fan, of course!",1014076800,4,1695,4.5064935064935066

900217,5,6304574657,"This is the final masterpiece of one of the Earth's greatest filmmakers, Andrei Tarkovsky. To me, the speech made by Josephson at the beginning was an extension of Tarkovsky's feelings. At the time, Tarkovsky was dying of cancer. Like many of his other movies, 'The Sacrifice' moves like a dream, drawing the viewer further and further into its bitter realm. In all of his movies, the characters have such intense emotions that it is almost too much to take. The film's final scene is absolutely stunning. It will live forever in the memory of anyone who will see it.",1004400000,,567,4.737373737373737

If so, you'll have an idea of what this mysterious film is like.  Each viewer must decide what the film is about, what it is trying to say.  It is an essay on life & death, on God & Faith, on beginnings and endings, and finally on the eternally flawed moving painting that cinema is.  It's a beautiful work which requires repeat viewings; as such, you must own it.",1002240000,,541,4.546391752577319

this director's Russian films. The BIG dissapointment however is the DVD
edition. The picture quality is not better than a VHS copy. I would wait for a
better edition. Tarkovskij's films deserves no less than the best possible
transfers. The film itself is three or four stars, but I give a zero for the
transfer",978739200,11,394,4.642857142857143
900220,4,6304574657,"THE SACRIFICE is a true work of art. It is probably the most beautiful  film by the cinematic poet Andrey Tarkovsky.  It is also the most  accessible among his works: unlike his films prior to this one, the plot of  THE SACRIFICE itself is quite simple and easy to catch. A retired actor-  journalist-author (some kind of an intellectual superman) hero living in a  beautiful sea-shore house suddenly faces the end of the world: a nuclear  war. What can he do to stop it?  He prays to God, he who never believed in  God before, and offers himself to be the sacrifice for saving the world as  he knows, a world which for the first time, he realises how much he loves  it.
The plot is simple, but its implication is complex. One who believes  in God and the absolute love he represents can see this as a story of  miracle. An atheist can see this as all being a hallucination of a  repressed old man.  Tarkovsky makes the film in a way that you can  interpret it in whatever way you want. But in whichever way you see it, the  film will lead you to our fundamental question; why we live? What is the  meaning of our life? How we can achieve the state in which we can say when  we face eternity, ""I understood the meaning of my life and I fulfilled  it""?
THE SACRIFICE was shot beautifully by cinematographer Sven  Nykvist, one of the greatest master in the art of creating filmic images,  whose talent is perfectly in match with Tarkovsky's narrative strategy of  filling the frame with symbolism that the audience can interpret in what  ever way he/her wants.
 The disappointment with this rather expensive DVD  is that, the transfer fails to catch the richness of Nykvist's work, and in  the case of this particular film, it really hurts because it prevent you to  create your own interpretation from what the film shows. The nature plays a  big role in the story, and already at the very beginning, you cannot feel  the richness of the green grass by the sea, the mystery of the trees  surrounding the house. Later in the film you miss the richness of the  shadows, the complex texture that the lights and shadows create on a simple  wall, the subtle reflection on a framed painting (a study of the Madonna by  Da Vinci).  It actually looks like it was made from a video tape. The  yellow subtitles are also build in the images, it's not an optional  subtitling and you cannot erase it.  I suggest you wait for a few years if  you have already seen the film, then maybe KINO will come up with a better  DVD. But if you have never seen it, well... it's a must-see film.",968025600,119,2569,4.405982905982906
7874289,2,6304574657,"fist Kudos to Kino-Lorber on the nice BR transfer as that is not the problem with this film. I try not to be too judgmental when it comes to Director's that are considered masters. All Artists have their good days and their bad days. This film was Tarkovsky having his bad days. There is a reason why the Blu-ray rights to this film were not picked up by Criterion...Eureka..Masters of Cinema...or Arrow....it just is not good enough to place in in the same category as great film.....the photography of the film is fine but this film is a depressing, boring, slow, and tedious meaningless work... it is to my thinking a waste of time... I am a fan of the French New Wave  there were French films that suffered from the same misery as this one...I do not resonate with any film that is like watching paint dry...there are just no redeeming qualities other than the cinematography ...others have explained that once leaving Russia Tarkovsky's work went down hill. After seeing this  I would say he should have stayed in Russia. Hopefully this is not the first work by Tarkovsky that you are viewing as there are several other masterful films check the list a few others have recommended and place this one on the bottom of your Tarkovsky list.",1522022400,,1242,4.640909090909091
