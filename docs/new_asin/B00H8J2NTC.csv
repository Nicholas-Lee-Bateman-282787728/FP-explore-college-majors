6140232,4,B00H8J2NTC,"Streaming a movie for ""free""(apart from the cost of the subscription) does one of two things for me:  confirms my decision to continue with a reasonably priced streaming service, notably Amazon Prime, as one viewing, with no frills, is all that is needed for the given film, or works as a full-length advertisement for movies I want to see again and again, often of better quality than the streaming option, and sometimes with extras and commentary to add to the pleasure.
Sleep, My Love, is a movie from the second category. After two ""free"" viewings, over the last few years, I purchased the Olive Films bluray knowing I would want to see this classic from Douglas Sirk again and again, in the best format available at this time.  I am happy with the bluray video and audio quality, although about 90% of the way through the film there is about 30-60 seconds of ""snow"" that is a little distracting.  But, the beautiful cinematography is much improved in this format, and I can rest easy at night knowing no one can remove it from my ""Watchlist"" if the licensing runs out.
The story line*****SPOILER ALERT******centers around a wealthy, genial Claudette Colbert being manipulated by her cheating husband Don Ameche, who hopes to inherit her money and keep his vixen mistress happy at the same time. Robert Cummings, never a favorite of mine, does a serviceable job as Claudette's new friend and knight in shining armor.  *****end of spoilers*****
Not in the same vein as the later, wonderfully subversive soaps of Sirk, it's still a great example of what made the studio system the great machine that it was: Stars, lovely costumes, amazing sets, interestingly plotted stories.......",1408060800,7,1684,4.898245614035088

6140237,4,B00H8J2NTC,"Directed by Douglas Sirk, SLEEP, MY LOVE (1948) is an atmospheric, often suspenseful thriller that should have been better.

The plot is reminiscent of GASLIGHT.

The film opens with Claudette Colbert awakening on a train headed to Boston from New York, and she has absolutely no idea how she got there.  Back home, her husband (Don Ameche) has called in the police (represented by Raymond Burr) to find her and, apparently, this is not the first time something like this has happened.  Is poor Claudette, a wealthy heiress, going insane?

At this point (ten minutes into the movie), anybody with half a brain will know who the villain is in this picture, but in deference to those with less than half, Im not going to reveal that persons identity and become a Spoiler.  How this baddie carries out his dastardly plan is what makes this movie fun.

My only problem with  SLEEP, MY LOVE is that the reveals come too soon in the screenplay, adapted by Leo Rosten, from his novel, and St. Clair McKelway.  The film would have been more effective had the audience been allowed to discover the villains motives and methods along with the characters.

Robert Cummings, George Coulouris, Rita Johnson, Keye Luke and Queenie Smith co-star in this more than watchable piece of film noir.

6140238,5,B00H8J2NTC,"Perfect ensemble and great sets. Colette Colbert's shack looks a little like 'The House on Telegraph Hill'. Note Hazel Brooks as the vamp, looking just as lethal as she did in 'Body and Soul' with John Garfield. It was a real twist to see Don Ameche as a creep, and Raymond Burr as a rather dumb cop. With Bob Cummings as the smart guy who comes on the scene just in time, I was reminded of 'Dial M for Murder', but this is a superior vehicle. Quite progressive that he is doing big business in China and is also immersed in their culture, instead of the Chinese being a second-class sideline. I liked this movie immensely.",1386720000,24,623,4.379310344827586

8630851,4,B00H8J2NTC,"Pretty good old fashioned thriller in which Claudette Colbert is married to Don Ameche, who has a bimbo on the side and a plan to get free without giving up the money, while Robert Cummings schemes to save her. Bit similar plotwise to Gaslight, Julie. Midnight lace, etc. Contemporary when made, it's got some great late 1940s fashions which, according to the filmakers, were common wear for ordinary women around the house.  Very entertaining if you're in the mood for stylized 1940s melodramas.",1530576000,,496,4.975903614457831

Suspenseful and engaging from the action-filled opening scene. Acting is superb, and the plot twists entertaining. As a bonus, there are snippets of humor throughout. Great movie. Must see viewing.",1514246400,,329,5.470588235294118
8630854,2,B00H8J2NTC,"It's hard to see what attracted Sirk to this project. Maybe it was assigned to him? It's about a rich woman, Claudette Colbert, whose husband, Don Ameche, plots to make her believe that she's mad. He plans for her to commit suicide and, after she's dead, continue living with his mistress. Plans go awry when Colbert meets and falls in love with her friend's friend, played by an amusing Robert Cummings.

The cinematography is nice, but absent is Sirk's style and themes. It's pretty straightforward and runs a little too long. In Jon Halliday's book of interviews with Sirk, the director didn't have too much to say about it except that he remembered the Chinatown wedding. He also said that he wanted to emphasize Colbert's split character and believed that was the most interesting part of the story. I'm not sure what he meant by this -- her doubts about her madness? Or, her unwillingness to believe that her husband was trying to make her insane? Whatever the case, Sirk's lack of interest in the project showed.",1513987200,,1019,4.757062146892656

8630858,4,B00H8J2NTC,"We've certainly seen all this before--Diana Wynyard, Joan Fontaine or Miss Bergman melodramatically ""gaslighted"" by a philandering (but stellar) spouse--but both Colbert and Sirk ring some fine variants on the overwrought potboiler elements of this familiar plotline. The credits themselves possess nonroutine interest, since Mary Pickford wrote the checks (including Colbert's chic costumes by ""Sophie""), her husband Buddy Rogers produced, and Douglas Sirk was brought in from Universal to add Continental directorial distinction and artistic objectivity to this 1948 indie production.

This was the first of two Colbert-Sirk collaborations. The actress had starred in John M. Stahl's seminal 1934 IMITATION OF LIFE, which Sirk was to remake as the gaudiest and most glamourous of all American melodramas in 1959. Sirk was already comfortable working in--and sending up--Hollywood genre tropes, having made the steamy Chekhovian SUMMER STORM with George Sanders and Linda Darnell in 1944, then the London-voyeur peasouper LURED with Sanders and Lucille Ball in 1947. Those films, like SLEEP, MY LOVE, have a darkling, dense, Teutonic visual texture and a definite hothouse feel, accentuated here in the set design for Colbert's very vertical Gotham brownstone with its tall Hitchcockian staircase and its ""jungle conservatory,"" both important plot elements, plus an over-the-top balcony scene for La Colbert.

Colbert went on to another Sirk potboiler, THUNDER ON THE HILL, without much distinction, but there are two quite extended sequences here that are pure Sirk. Beyond Claudette's usual grace and charm (and the ""Sophie"" frocks), she and Robert Cummings attend Keye Luke's Chinese wedding, and more than tipsy on rice wine Colbert is given a long drunk sequence. Usually these just don't work, and are embarrassing examples of stellar hamminess and exaggeration, but the actress pulls it off by sensibly underplaying with the lightest of Gallic touches. Meanwhile the suave moustachioed philanderer Don Ameche, cast against type and also underplaying, is shakily maintaining a really spooky mistress, the supermodel Hazel Brooks' ""Daphne"" character. Daphne, a photographer's model, is sinister and zombielike, very Continental and very needy, and Sirk makes her the most stylized and mysteriously singular presence in the film, more so even than affable ethnic goodguy Keye Luke.

Brooks' laconic ice-queen weirdness is reason enough to enjoy this film, that bad Ameche is strangely likeable and more substantial under Sirk's direction (recall that both he and Colbert learnt a lot from Ernst Lubitsch), and both Colbert and Cummings really freshen the stuffiness of gaslighted dramatic melos with their natural comedic talents. For Sirk followers this is a fine genre-bending preamble to his great color masterworks of the 1950s, since neither he nor his interesting, rather Gothic, cast deigned to take this trite material too seriously and were able, empowered or not by Pickford and Rogers (did Little Mary apprehend Sirk's artistic radicalism?), to stress its latent elements of satire and comedy. The ironies here are multifold, and Sirk's knowing followers will not be let down.",1467158400,,3192,5.590909090909091
