With the exception of Rishi Kapoor, the other actors are wooden and cannot express emotions if their life depended on it. The music is very good however.",1255910400,3,320,4.440677966101695

3966256,5,B002Q6RZ3G,"What can I say about Deepika Padukone? One of the new and upcoming talent in Indian cinema, I think she keeps getting better and better with each movie she does.

In a typical boy meets girl kind of way in today's modern times, Jai (Saif Ali Khan) is in a relationship with Meera (Deepika Padukone) but when their different jobs require them to live in two different countries they decide to break up because as Jai says 'long distance relationships never work'.

Jai meets Veer Singh (Rishi Kapoor) a coffee shop owner who upon hearing the tale of Jai & Meera can't believe that he let her go. Veer tells his story of the way he met and married Harleen which happened several years ago.

Both stories run somewhat systematically throughout the course of the movie but you see the same result or theme that if it's true love you would do anything to get her back.

A beautiful movie & lovely performances by Deepika Padukone, Saif Ali Khan & Rishi Kapoor",1388275200,,954,4.52906976744186

3966260,4,B002Q6RZ3G,"Typical, right? But it is kind of cute in places. And the female star is beautiful. Personally, I think I would like to see more of the older man's more traditional love story, as I enjoy that style more than the modern style.",1367884800,,226,4.27906976744186
3966261,3,B002Q6RZ3G,"It's a film about two kinds of love, and makes a think about how important is to appreciate the meaning of love and take risks.

3966267,5,B002Q6RZ3G,"This is one of my favorite movies to come out of Bollywood. Though I am just now diving into the very deep waters of Indian cinema, I know a pearl when I see one. This movie is both timely and timeless, with a theme that will speak to anyone's heart. Also, the music is spectacular. Since this is Saif Ali Khan's first foray into producing, I hope to see many more great films come out of his studio in the upcoming years.",1283385600,,422,4.158536585365853
3966268,4,B002Q6RZ3G,"Deepika is just as stunning as she was in Om Shanti Om.  And I think she is not only beautiful, but also a great dancer and a terrific actress.  I have to say I think Saif is ugly and old and would be better as a villain.  Why does Deepika's character get together with him so quickly?  Was she a slut?  Or is it just modern romance.  I would have preferred to see a handsome dude like Arjun Rampal or John Abraham acting with Deepika.

The movie is beautifully photographed and performed.  You can read the story synopsis etc. from the other reviews on Amazon.  I just don't buy Saif and Deepika always breaking up and getting back together.  In reality, who knows, Deepika dated Ranbir and he is ugly with a big hook nose too.  But she dumped him and they never got back together.",1282176000,,782,4.287671232876712

3966270,5,B002Q6RZ3G,"Love Aaj Kal is DEFINITELY one of the very best 2009 romantic comedies I have ever, ever seen in an utterly long time... the two main leads (Saif Ali Khan and Deepika Padukone playing as Jai and Meera, respectively) are just flat-out fantastic, and the way the two love stories from two different generations of time interconnect with each other is just seamlessly and most flawlessly brilliant indeed; you can just literally sense the sheer chemistry, the compelling character development, their painful heartaches, and one powerhouse performance after another in this original Hindi-language film from start to finish, combined with such an outstanding story that just makes you want to leap with great joy and go all the way, guaranteed!!!  ;)

Shot on location in San Francisco, London, and New Dehli as the main backdrops, what makes this movie *extremely* so special for me personally is that all the dating and relationships here are handled in quite an absolutely, ABSOLUTELY fresh and alive and splendidly convincing and rather strikingly mature manner indeed between the characters and what they are going through also, and even much more better is that we end up fully and genuinely with an amazing, non-stop rooting interest in those two main characters throughout, especially as well in the key point late in the film where we actually sense that Meera and Jai's emotional, secretly attractive connection to each other is seriously at risk when they are in sudden jeopardy in their relationship!  I am not gonna spill the beans on what happens at the very end here... but one thing is for certain: with fantastic pacing, excellent laughs, amazing non-stop energy, first-rate songs to lift the action so wonderfully, and an incredibly top-notch modern-day romance that spans two generations, Love Aaj Kal literally blows away all of the contrived, obnoxious, and most blatantly lifeless 2009 American theatrical romance comedies (i.e. The Ugly Truth, Love Happens, and All About Steve to name a few!) to kingdom come.  PERIOD, final.

DO NOT MISS THIS ONE especially with your loved one as well, because this is your perfect date movie that you must, must see indeed... you will *not* be even disappointed whatsoever, and congratulations to Illuminati Films, Eros International, and especially to writer/director Imtias Ali as well on quite a watershed brilliance of a romance-comedy film well made!!!!  (^-^)v !!",1267142400,5,2425,5.173469387755102
3966271,5,B002Q6RZ3G,"I'm gonna give this film full marks because it doesn't try to be a romantic comedy and unlike a lot of Bollywood films takes itself seriously. Saif was superb while Deepika only outshines him with her effortless grace and intriguing character. Some surprises as far as guest appearances are concerned but the film will win you over. A great film both for cynics and for daydreamers.

I strongly recommend.",1266192000,3,405,4.869565217391305
3966272,4,B002Q6RZ3G,"I really like that LOVE AAJ KAL, a romantic comedy that segues into a drama, takes a more sophisticated approach and allows for real emotional development, something we don't get too much of from the generic Bollywood product, what with Indian cinema so hooked on sweeping over-the-top romances. When director Imtiaz Ali met star/co-producer Saif Ali Khan in the first of their pre-production meetings, he told him, ""All I know about this story is that two people meet to break up."" It's an interesting take, and the premise gets even more interesting with the introduction of two interweaving storylines, one set in contemporary times, the other set in 1965.

London today, and Jai's opening gambit when hitting on de ladies goes something like this: ""I don't mean to pile on but..."" This must be a colloquial Indian maneuver, since this phrase strikes me as a pretty odd flirting tool. Meera, lovely and outspoken, certainly isn't impressed, and she calls Jai out on it. Still, they start a fun year-long romance, chronicled in the film's first seven minutes in abrupt episodic moments. But then careers get in the way and - Jai and Meera being a sensible couple - there's an amicable parting of ways (there's even a break-up party).

Somewhere along here, Jai is befriended by coffee shop owner and old sikh Veer Singh (Rishi Kapoor) who goes on to give him advice and to recount his own long ago romance. Jai's romantic plight strikes a chord with Veer and he begins to reminisce. And this is when the secondary story arc is introduced.

It's 1965 in Delhi, India. Veer Singh is a sikh and something of a rough fella. But his ornery demeanor shifts once he sets his eyes on the very shy Harleen. It's a long distance romance, really, as Veer and Harleen barely exchange any dialogue. Just tons of furtive longing glances, and Veer doing his best to woo her from afar. It seems to work, until he learns that Harleen's family has arranged a marriage for her. And we wait to see just how far Veer will go for love (turns out, he goes pretty far).

On the surface, the cynical modern love story serves as a counterpoint against Bollywood's traditional idealistic romance (in which a man may be so besotted that he travels hundreds of miles from Delhi to Calcutta on a rattling train just to catch a glimpse of his love). But a closer look gives us the film's true message, that love may wear different fashions, that behavior may be reflected by the respective era, but love remains universally the same and confounds even obstacles such as cynicism and practicality. This is a really good movie from India. It mostly stays away from silly elements and the relatively understated tone goes a ways into lending believability to the plot. And it does feel like there's a solid connection between the two generations of lovers onscreen.

The acting is terrific across the board. We've seen Saif Ali Khan take on roles like ""Jai"" before in SALAAM NAMASTE and in HUM TUM, you know, the charismatic fun-loving guy unwilling to settle down. His character's journey to maturation is pretty predictable. Saif also plays the bearded and turban-coiffed Veer Singh of 1965, and Veer is a far cry from Jai, unabashedly romantic where Jai is flighty and dismissive. It's a nod to Saif's acting ability that you're able to separate the two characters even as they share the same features.

Deepika Padukone, long-legged and stunning, is the revelation. She's simply marvelous and adds surprising depth and warmth to Meera, and, c'mon, how can you not fall in love with her? She makes Meera a character you really root for, a girl perfectly aware of what's going on every step of the way and hoping against hope that her guy would get wise and catch up. Harleen, the other lady in question, is played by 20-year-old Brazilian model Giselle Monteiro, who had initially auditioned for the role of Jai's Caucasian girlfriend (yes, Jai does try to move on after Meera). However, the director's wife pointed out that Giselle would make a better Harleen, since Director Imtiaz Ali had been getting frustrated finding the right actress for that part. Not exactly rocking the Hindi language, Giselle Monteiro doesn't get a lot of dialogue, which is probably a wise thing. Giselle's identity was kept under wraps until the movie's theatrical release.

Besides the opening seven minutes of quick cuts, LOVE AAJ KAL throughout its running time is rife with transitional images which fall outside of chronological order. It's a disjointed technique but there's a sense of gratification as you do eventually see how these images fit within the framework of the story.

The production values on this film are top notch. Not only is the contemporary story arc set in the slick international backdrops of London, San Francisco and modern Delhi, but the 1965 setting is also nicely, convincingly evoked. Not that I'm a huge expert or anything, having only recently started watching old Bollywood classics from the '60s and '70s - but I least now know how much Rishi Kapoor and his wife Neetu impacted Indian cinema in the '70s.

The musical numbers are alternately hip and charmingly old-fashioned. ""Dooriyan"" is a contemplative, soulful song about distances and separation. ""Twist"" is toe-tapping stuff and showcases Saif's unexpectedly smooth dance moves (even Saif's admitted to being a stiff at dancing). ""Ajj Din Chadheya"" is sweetly done and frames Veer and Harleen's courtship at a distance. ""Thoda Thoda Pyar"" is the old-school courtyard number featuring a dancing Giselle (according to the commentary, Giselle drove the dance choreographers up the wall because, well, as someone new to the culture, she couldn't quite grasp the moves). ""Chor Bazaari"" is fun and serenades Jai and Meera as they hang out on the sly in Delhi.

2 discs for this one. Disc 1 has the feature presentation, an option to check out the film's musical numbers, and the film commentary in English by Saif Ali Khan & Director Imtiaz Ali. Disc 2 has the following special features: the Making Of the film segment; the Making of the songs; LOVE AAJ KAL Journey - which is even more behind-the-scenes stuff (although one does get tired of a segment that keeps popping up, the one about the crew going on and on about the hassle of shooting in horrible Delhi traffic); deleted scenes and quick shots with director's commentary (including a sequence in a sweet's shop featuring Jai and Meera and the now aged Veer and Harleen); the promotional press conference with the lead actors & crew; a remix video of ""Twist""; the audio release function - basically, another press conference this time focusing on the music in the film; and the original theatrical trailer.",1263859200,17,6705,4.8788410886742755

3966274,4,B002Q6RZ3G,"With highlight over Contemporary romance in comparison to older times love, this new hindi movie is meant for the youth and completely relates to both the generations. It is a movie that throws light on how the 2 generations don't understand each other and how broad each of their thinking is. With a starcast like Deepika Padukone and Saif Ali Khan, who are the face of youth in Bollywood, the movie shows how love in two different generations was the same feeling.... flowery. It's just about how people treat their love differently. Comparing the lifestyles of people in 2 different countries, the movie is based in London, Delhi and Calcutta. It showcases the best of the 2 countries.
It's a feel good movie and worth watching again and again with the high quality picturization and amazing dance and romantic songs churned into a beautiful tale of 2 generations that makes you feel that ""love"" is truly a bliss and worth giving your life for just like Veer (Saif Ali Khan) does!!",1257465600,6,984,4.760233918128655
