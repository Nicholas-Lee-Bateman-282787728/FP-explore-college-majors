8658996,4,B00KHFSJOM,"A nice interview with the Lantz's done in the 80's.  Walter talks about his career starting in the Teen's.  It has a nice group of extra's a group of cartoons from the 20's thru the 50's.  Well worth picking up a copy.

The quality of the interview is from an old local TV show taken from video tape.  The video quality is only fair most likely taken from the only existing copy - however the cartoon are taken from recent transfers.",1410739200,,433,4.296296296296297
8658997,5,B00KHFSJOM,"It was wonderful to see the Lantzes so thoroughly enjoying themselves as they reminisced about their careers.  Chris Buchman drew them out knowledgeably and engagingly, resulting in an encapsulated history of animation in general as well as of the career and creations of Walter Lantz.

Many other very talented individuals, such as co-producer and distinguished artist Rex Schneider, also appeared in and/or contributed to this work, as is evidenced by the amazing artwork, music, puppetry, etc.  I found it particularly interesting to see the steps involved in creating, developing and building a stage background set.

The Classics 34 TV program retrospective was very entertaining.  It was also an interesting and somewhat disillusioning peek into the behind-the-scenes workings of public television, and perhaps all television production.

I work in a library, and I think this DVD should be in the collections of public libraries as well as in entertainment-history specialty libraries and museums.  It will be interesting and entertaining for knowledgeable animation and live-action movie aficionados as well as for the general public.  I enjoyed all of it and learned a lot from it.",1406851200,3,1190,5.46448087431694
8658998,5,B00KHFSJOM,"For those familiar with Baltimore in the 60s and 70s or northern Indiana in the early 80s, the name Chris Buchman will no doubt recall his elaborate presentations of classic feature films both from the silent and early sound era, fascinating lost short subjects, golden age animation, accompanying detailed film history and related ephemera.  The piece de resistance of Chris Buchmans nostalgic moving picture presentation legacy was Classics 34.  This was a Saturday night staple on PBS affiliate WNIT (for northern Indiana and southern Michigan) showcasing all of the above, invitingly and knowledgably presented by Buchman in partnership with his longtime collaborator and accomplished artist Rex Schneider.  I was fortunate to be associated with this boundlessly creative team as a producer of the series while a staff member at WNIT.  For many in the region, the tradition on Saturday nights was to make some popcorn, fix your favorite beverage and settle in for an entertaining and informative evening with old friends: Chris and Classics 34. The series was famous for bringing to life the era of a respective evenings feature presentation - replete with posters, lobby cards, production stills, glossies of the stars, period equipment and tons of background on the film and the shorts/cartoons imparted engagingly by Chris. Chriss enthusiasm for film history was infectious and the series soon became a fan favorite and major fundraiser for the station.  Interviews with stars or period guests further enhanced the authenticity and aura of Classics 34.  A highlight of which, being a very rare interview with the creator of Woody Woodpecker (among other famous cartoon characters), Walter Lantz and his wife Gracie.  It was obvious that Walter and Gracie Lantz were most impressed with Chris knowledge and affection for their creations and willingly gave of their time and insights  providing undoubtedly the definitive interview of their careers. If you want to revisit those fond Saturday evenings with Chris and Classics 34 or learn first-hand the history of Woody Woodpecker directly from Walter and Gracie, you will thoroughly enjoy this fond stroll down a warm and entertaining memory lane.",1404259200,4,2203,5.328530259365994

The interview with Walter and Gracie Lantz is a joy to watch, and the supplements (as well-described in the product description) are all interesting and fun to explore. Highly recommended for anyone looking for something unique and interesting.

The ""Extras"" section has some great cartoons, including 4 ""Jimmy on the Job"" shorts, which, though crudely animated, are very funny. It also includes the Dinky Doodle cartoon ""Little Red Riding Hood"" and the Col. Heeza Liar cartoon ""Knighthood"", which both feature live footage of a very young Walter Lantz interacting with the animated characters. They have even restored the Ipana ad (albeit with sound missing for that short portion only) to the ending of ""Boy Meets Dog"".
