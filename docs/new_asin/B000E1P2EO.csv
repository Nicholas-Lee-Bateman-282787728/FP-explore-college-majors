GREAT stories about the background of several movies to include the Exorcist, The Omen, etc. My guess with all the research that is done for the movie, something realistic happens that makes us realize that this can be more than a movie. In the movie, ""What Lies Beneath"" with Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford, check out the very last scene in the movie itself. Not even the director planned it.",1468540800,,484,4.511363636363637

1. There's more focus on clips of paranormal themed movies than actual stories
2. Where they are first hand accounts, they're short and not thorough
3. The production value is pretty poor... low budget look.

But overall I'm happy I watched this, it was fun. If you want a great show, check out the first season of Paranormal Witness or early episodes of A Haunting.",1460851200,,532,4.720430107526882

I skipped over the Abbott & Costello bit, It's A Wonderful Life, etc. The Hollywood film clips were overused and just made the production look cheesy.",1451260800,,492,5.08641975308642

2483614,5,B000E1P2EO,"Very funny and charming film the way only Hollywood can do it.

As far as supernatural occurrences on the sets of films of that genre, that happens to be a very old PR ploy that goes back to the days when movie/hollywood gossip magazines were popular in the 50's (or somewhere along that timeline).

There's one contemporary horror film that even includes (as an extra feature on the DVD) interviews with the cast and their stories about ""scary"" things happening during the filming.....sorry I forget the film.

It's all simply self promotion, obviously. It's a great way to get you to pay for more tours and all that.",1421971200,2,618,4.703703703703703

2483628,1,B000E1P2EO,"This ""documentary"" feels at if someone attempted to create a film about haunted places in Hollywood, but failed to produce enough material to do so. Therefore, they augmented what little they had with scenes from movies about ghost, sort of. The movies they included weren't even films about actual hauntings, for the most part. They even included ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" because  it has a character who is an angel. Really?! Don't waste your time.",1397433600,,449,4.986666666666666

Actually 'The Amityville Horror' was never ""proven"" to be a hoax it was never admitted to by the Lutzes, and they took their account of it to the grave. There is an interesting interview with the writer of 'The Exorcist' about a haunting that took place on the set of the film. The film also includes the true case of 'The Entity'. Skepics meet believers, so we can hear both sides of the argument.  For fans of ghost stories and excellent doccumentries, this is for you.  Great soundtrack too!",1337644800,,519,4.51063829787234
2483632,4,B000E1P2EO,"This is a fun program as long as you keep certain things in mind:
1) This was produced in the late 1980s
2) The producers were attempting to seriously look into actual hauntings connected with Hollywood.

If you want the most up-to-date information, look elsewhere. In fact, I'd recommend looking into the History Channel's Haunted History series, I believe they've produced one on Hollywood. The Haunted History program is a few years old, but it would be more current than this film.

If you want wild sensational stories, you won't find that here either. The producers were trying to show the difference between alleged real life hauntings and Hollywood movies. If you read into the phenomena reported in purported hauntings, they consist mostly of strange sounds, odd smells, cold spots, and short lived apparitions. Most of this wouldn't make a very interesting movie or television show, so while most Hollywood ghost stories start with this sort of phenomena it certainly doesn't end there.

A couple of the cases that were looked into were made into successful Hollywood ghost/horror films such as The Entity and The Amityville Horror. It was nice contrasting and comparing the Hollywood treatment of these stories. When this show was recorded, the Amityville Horror was still being debated as to whether it was real or a hoax with strong opinions on both sides, but today it's pretty much regarded as a hoax.

I especially enjoyed the interviews with Elke Sommer talking about the haunting at her former residence, and I enjoyed the interviews with parapsychologists who discuss their investigations. One person made a point to say how unlike movies like Poltergeist their investigations are.

John Carradine is a fun choice for the host. He may be a little over-the-top, but he seems like he's enjoying himself. The clips from famous horror movies are also a lot of fun to watch. So if you are a fan of classic Hollywood ghost stories, as well as fascinated by real life hauntings, you would probably enjoy this DVD. You're not going to come away with any great ""Truths"", but it's an interesting hour of entertainment and you can learn a few things as well.",1272672000,4,2166,4.93956043956044

This film was made in 1986.  Nothing shocking here, nothing even remotely intersting.  It shows clips of old horror movies, from Bela Lugosi to the movies The Exorcist, Poltergeist, and other films of that era.  It had Elke Sommer giving the most interesting narrative about her haunted house.  They talked to a few psychics, took way too much time on the Amityville Horror, which has already been proven a hoax for many years now.  For this day and age, this DVD is sort of a waste of time.
