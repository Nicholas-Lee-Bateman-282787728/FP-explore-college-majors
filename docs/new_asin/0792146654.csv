7791794,4,0792146654,"As others have so repeatedly stated, it is another holodeck disaster film (At this point, if I had been on the ship, I would have written a complaint to the captain saying that the holodeck is becoming a huge hazard and we should just get rid of it until we're smart enough to make it disaster proof).  But, we can't deny the humor of watching Data first acting as his normal self, and then suddenly switch to a cowboy mentality.  Also, Brent Spiner must have had fun playing multiple roles in this episode (not the first of course) and we can't deny the fact that it would be good for Worf to take a vacation with Alexander for once.  The basic plot goes as follows:  The Enterprise crew is on a 2 day vacation from exploration (not that this means anything isn't going to happen).  Worf, Alexander, and Troi all decide to go on a holodeck adventure in the Wild West, Capt. Picard is playing his Kataan flute (and being constantly interuppted by the other senior officers), Dr. Crusher is writing a play, and Geordi and Data decide to experiment with Data and the Enterprise.  Well, somehow Geordi and Data's messing around starts affecting the ship and the holodeck (replicators start producing cat food all over the ship, Dr. Crusher's play suddenly turns into Data's poetry, all the holodeck characters turn into Data with his abilities, etc.)  A delightful episode, my only complaint about this one is that the ship's safeguards for the holodeck go off (Yes, I know it would ruin the story, but it doesn't make sense unlike other episodes where something alien or whatever hotwires the Enterprise).  Definitely more comical and mild than others, which is a good thing every once in awhile for Star Trek (Compare this with Schisms and you'll definitely understand what I mean.)",1157328000,,1781,4.72258064516129
7791795,3,0792146654,"Alexander drags Worf to the holodeck to the Wild West and Troi shows up as the ""mysterious stranger"" (I'm really not into the whole  Worf/Troi thing).  At the same time, Geordi is running a scan on Data and  the two merge- resulting in Wild Westerisms in Data and too many Datas in  the holodeck.  Several cute and funny lines and good sets, but overall not  one of my favorites.",940809600,10,379,4.420289855072464
