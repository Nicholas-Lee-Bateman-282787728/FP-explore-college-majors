5577765,5,B00BCGUIIA,"All five of these films are great movies about gangsters. To name a couple, you have the Untouchables, with Kevin Costner, Connery, and De Niro as Al Capone; you also have Heat which features Al Pacino and De Niro. Also included are Goodfellas, Mean Streets, and the Departed. Once again, all five are great standalone films.
In this set, you get a sturdy outer cardboard box, a hardcover book with production notes, pictures, as well as other information about the films, and the five discs are in a separate case. As far as audio/video content is concerned, all of the discs are re-issues of the previously released films, with all of the same special features, commentaries, etc. So you are getting nothing new in that regard. The only thing which is actually new is the hardcover book, which in my opinion, books like this (or at least paper booklets) are what is sorely missing in almost every blu-ray release.
The bottom line is that if you don't have any of these films on blu, and you are a fan of gangster films, then this set is definitely for you. On the other hand, if you do already have all (or most) of the films, then you're probably better off keeping what you have since the only thing that is actually new is the book.",1397001600,,1237,4.526785714285714
5577766,3,B00BCGUIIA,"The 5 films: Mean Streets, The Untouchables, Goodfellas, Heat, and The Departed. A 32-page hardcover booklet is also included. Overall, the picture quality is great and the audio quality is very good. This set comes with 4.75 hours of special features plus 4 audio commentaries (The Untouchables and The Departed do not have audio commentaries). The DVD release of 'The Departed' included an 85-minute documentary, ""Scorsese on Scorsese,"" which has been dropped from the Blu-ray versions of the film. My only complaints are that the transfer quality of Goodfellas is fairly average, the longest featurette is only 30 minutes long, and some of the supplements are rather bland. These films are simply bundled up versions of the stand-alone Blu-rays. The price is right so this set does work as a value pack.

5577770,3,B00BCGUIIA,"Warner Bros. is notorious for re-releasing the same DVDs and Blu-rays with different art or packaging, whether under the guise of a new ""Anniversary Edition"" (like ""Unforgiven"") or as part of a boxed set or multi-feature release.  ""Ultimate Gangster Collection - Contemporary"" is no different: this collects ""Heat"", ""Goodfellas"", ""The Untouchables"", ""Mean Streets"" and ""The Departed"".  All have been released before; some discs are better than others, but they're exactly the same except for the disc art (the packaging is not clear on this, so I just wanted to clarify).  The point is...if you're looking for detailed reviews of each disc, they're already out there.

As a boxed set, this five-disc collection is a little overpriced but might be worth buying if you only own one or two of the films but want them all.  Everyone else should just pick and choose their favorites, or just wait for the inevitable re-releases.  The accompanying hardcover book is painfully basic and only contains a short two-page retrospective on each film with a few photos and memorable quotes.  Bottom line: this boxed set is a fairly lazy, by-the-numbers effort, hence the somewhat average three-star rating I've given it.

And yes, I actually own the product and have checked it first hand.  I received an advance copy for review purposes for a website not affiliated with Amazon.

NOTE: By the way, the listing of ""Blu-ray Book Packaging"" is kind of misleading.  Only the accompanying book is, well, actually a ""book"", as the discs are packed in a separate multi-disc keepcase.  In turn, both the book and the keepcase fit inside a slipcover.  So it looks nice...but it's techincally not a Digibook, like ""Alien Anthology"" or the ""Blade Runner"" Anniversary Edition.",1368748800,25,1752,5.083916083916084

8565931,4,B00BCGUIIA,"Except for ""The Departed,"" this is a pretty good box. At $20, it was only a bit more than what the single disc of ""Mean Streets"" would have cost (12/14). I like early Scorsese, most everything through ""Goodfellas,"" but after that his movies turned into ridiculous parodies of his earlier films, the violence not just gratuitous, but laughable. ""The Departed"" clocks in at 2 1/2 hours, with the last 30 minutes devoted to the easy killing off of all the major characters. Guess when you run out of ideas, pour on the blood. Oh well, can't complain about the price of the box, or the transfers, which were uniformly good to excellent. Just don't waste your time on ""The Departed.""",1419811200,,678,4.658333333333333

8565935,5,B00BCGUIIA,"I thought I'd include some helpful information about each film  here for potential customers, as I notice the Product Description is lacking. Hope this helps:

GOODFELLAS - 1990 - 146 minutes - Director: Martin Scorsese - Starring: Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci - Genre: Crime, Drama - Plot: The story of gangster Henry Hill, and his rise and fall in the criminal hierarchy. R

HEAT - 1995 - 170 minutes - Director: Michael Mann - Starring: Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer - Genre: Crime, action - Plot: A ruthless team of bank robbers and a driven cop clash wills in LA. R

When we divide $34 by 5, we find a cost of $6.99 per film, an excellent deal to own this brilliant and iconic set of gangster films! I hope this information was helpful to you.",1397088000,6,1612,4.59581881533101
