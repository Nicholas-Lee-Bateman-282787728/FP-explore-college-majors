4487923,5,B004WO9OOS,I bought the 3 seasons for my husband. He loves the PJ's. He use to watch them on television but they are no longer on unless it is real late in the evening so I bought him the set so he could watch them whenever he wanted.,1356912000,,223,3.765957446808511
4487924,5,B004WO9OOS,"Greetings all! I'm taking just a wee bit of your time to review this product. I watched this when it was running on network television. It was funny then & funny now. It's taken a long time to get this for purchase. I actually have tried for years. The only difference from the tv show, is the end credits where there is no theme musice playing as the episodes go off. That's all. The discs are very crisp & clear. The whole series is what I purchases because it is a classic & very funny. It's part of Eddie Murphy's better layers. Some of his raturally ""raw"" comedic genius. At least to me any way. This series depicts the goings ons & goings ins of the ""hood"" or projects as it is. Though it boasts exaggerations of circumstances surrounding minorites & fiscal handicap, it speaks high octave volumes of what happens in governmental properties intended for the indigent. The lifestyle in this environment mimics the residents as an indigenous people. The pjs shows a laughable tolerance for the less fortunate.  It entertains & sheds light on the daily struggles of housing developments & the abundant neglect throughout the system. I would thoroughly recommend this product because it'll grab your attention & keep u laughing. Please don't hesitate to give it a try.",1348876800,,1270,4.7207207207207205

4487929,4,B004WO9OOS,"Judge Victor Valdivia, DVD Verdict -- ""Attacked as racially and culturally insensitive in its first season, The PJs doesn't shy away from edgy humor and controversial topics in its second. What's more, the show does more to flesh out its characters and relationships in this season than in the previous one. If this season ends up being a little more uneven than the first, it still contains some of the series' funniest jokes and best episodes, making it a worthy companion to the first season. The show still explores life in the projects with unabashed honesty and cutting wit, it still makes hilariously crude and edgy humor, and it makes no apologies for any of it. There are two reasons why this season isn't quite as stellar as the first. For one thing, some of the all-star writers (such as Simpsons vets Al Jean and Mike Reiss) who were involved with the first season are absent. Second, there are some episodes this season where Murphy, for whatever reason, did not do the voice of Thurgood. And this isn't quite the place to start watching, as the first season is more consistent and inventive. Still, The PJs remains a sadly underrated series and Lionsgate deserves credit for finally letting fans get to see it again after many years, even without extras.""",1310256000,5,1269,4.7727272727272725

 HOWEVER, call me anal but I find it to be a major inconvenience that they neglected to place the episodes from each season in the order that they originally aired like they do with every other show.
  Perhaps they didn't find it necessary for some reason but I really found it to be a very inconvenient choice for real fans like me.",1395619200,,534,4.165048543689321
