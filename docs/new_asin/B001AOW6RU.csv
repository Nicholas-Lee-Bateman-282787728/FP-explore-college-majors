Cut loose, John worked briefly for PARAMOUNT, UNIVERSAL, WARNER's, FOX and COLUMBIA, then at a number of 'B' film companies, in particular SUPREME, where as a western movie star he was now Johnny Mack Brown.

Alpha's JOHNNY MACK BROWN COLLECTION is ten one-hour western programmers, the majority of them produced by Supreme Pictures (a Poverty Row studio) and shot on the Iverson and other Southern California ranches.
