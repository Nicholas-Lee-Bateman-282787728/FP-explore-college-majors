8272953,2,B00199FWF4,The sound is grossly out of sinc with the picture.  I had an earlier DVD of this picture and it was a h--- of a lot closer than this copy. Maybe they feel that because it's dubbed it doesn't matter or maybe they just didn't give a ----.  Give be a break.,1478390400,,254,3.8653846153846154
8272954,1,B00199FWF4,"I got this, but you should NOT. Audio is about 5-6 seconds delayed, video is very grainy. I watched a regular copy and the video was no where near as bad as this and audio was fine. The packaging and top menu smacks of bootleg, but I don't know that for a fact. All I know is if you want a copy that is viewable DO NOT GET THIS ONE!",1345248000,8,332,3.757142857142857
8272955,2,B00199FWF4,"You never know when you watch a movie like this exactly what you are going to get.  With another Venusian film, ""Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet,"" I was pleasantly surprised.  With this movie, my pleasure was measurably less.

In the future from 1959, when this movie was made, a spool is found in Tunguska, Siberia.  In the summer of 1908, something caused a huge explosion in Siberia that has been credited to a number of sources.  Though the current scientific explanation is that a meteor caused the explosion, this movie credits the explosion to a Venusian spaceship.  Scientists decipher a portion of the spool and learn that the spool provides data about the earth, and the source of the spool is Venus.  Off we go to Venus!

The earth spaceship is one of the best parts of this movie.  There are flying ribs that connect the spaceship's engines to the main portion of the ship.  The ship's takeoff impressed me.  Once the ship took off, things were not so impressive.  There was a cheesy meteor shower that other movies filmed pre-1959 handled better.  Once we got to Venus there were annoying cloud effects.  However, once on Venus the special effects picked up again.  The surface of Venus and some portions of the remains of the Venusian civilization were handled very nicely.  However, the central control was animated, and not well.

One of the most interesting effects occurs when a chocolate-looking substance begins to attack explorers, following them up a tower.  I wondered whether the syrupy concoction was some sort of ""blob"" equivalent that would digest the explorers when it reached them, but it did not.  One of the intrepid explorers shoots the gooey mess and it immediately retreats.  However, shooting into the gooey mess also begins a chain reaction.

The next thing you know, the spaceship is flung from the planet by the reversal of an energy field as the result of a heroic effort by two of the crew members, several people die, the spaceship returns to earth, the survivors say some high-minded stuff, and the movie is over.  You pause for a moment, then, you wonder what that was all about.

Most of this movie, which was produced by East Germany and Poland, is boring.  There are brief moments that are fascinating, such as the introduction of a 1959 version of Roomba (seriously, there is a little robot that immediately reminded me of a Roomba, though it does not vacuum - it does talk and play chess well; top that Roomba!).  There are cool little gyro-vehicles and cars for tooling around the surface.  The space suits are right out of the Soviet space program.  The rest of the time the movie is a concatenation of stuff that makes a poor stew.  We learn that Dr. Sumiko Omigura's (Yoko Tani) husband was killed on the moon and that she had a fling with Robert Brinkman (Gnther Simon), one of the other explorers.  I suppose the intent was to give some depth to the characters, but instead I kept wondering why I should care about Omigura's husband and her fling.  I realized I did not care, but it was distracting me from the boring parts of the movie.

There are some movies that are interesting only to people who really, REALLY like science fiction, or those who are interested in the history of science fiction.  Also, if you want to see that movie that you vaguely remember having watched and you want to see how well it has held up compared to your memory, you might wish to watch it again.  Everyone else should go watch ""Forbidden Planet"" or even ""Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet.""  Even better, watch the ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" treatment of this movie; it is hilarious.

Good luck!",1341446400,2,3639,4.704113924050633
8272956,2,B00199FWF4,"While this may be a highly touted early sci-fi film and also released in Widescreen and colour, I don't know what happened to the sound track.  If it is the actual actors speaking, their words are a good 5 - 10 seconds either ahead or behind the picture.  It was awful to watch and incomprehensible to relate the sound to the action.
I understand there a a couple of other versions out there.  Try them.  This one is an audio mess.",1246838400,4,431,4.283950617283951
8272957,3,B00199FWF4,"It is the 1962 view of 1985 (they could have picked 1984). All is right with the world. We discover a rock that contains a spool (whatever a spool is); the spool is discovered to contain a message. And what a message. In 1908 Tunguska (read the facts about this in the book ""The Fire Came by: The Riddle of the Great Siberian Explosion"" by John Baxter - 1976) a great explosion took place. Evidently, this was a space vehicle of extraterrestrial origin. It jettisoned the spool upon exploding.

We do not have time to decipher the message do it will have to be deciphered on the way to Venus. Our East German space ship rivals those of Japanese sci-fi with one exception. This ship has an emergency Gyro that can only be activated by using a special hammer to break the glass.

Mean time what will we find on Venus and will it destroy or carry a message to all mankind.",1239494400,,869,4.3580246913580245
