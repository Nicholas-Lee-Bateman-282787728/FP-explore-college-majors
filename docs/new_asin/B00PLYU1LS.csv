Runaway Ralph is LONG and I really don't know what it has to do with Spring (the kid goes to camp?), but surprisingly my students LOVED this one.

6817852,3,B00PLYU1LS,"The Stories are great all Scholastic titles! problem?  There is no problem if you purchase this DVD for your home use. If you are a teacher or a school this DVD does not come with performance rights, meaning you cannot show this DVD in a classroom or any public place. It would have been nice to know that before I purchased this item. Thankfully I was able to return it easily to amazon.",1448841600,2,388,4.315068493150685

6817854,5,B00PLYU1LS,I teach a 3 year old preschool class and this movie along with the others in the series are hands down my kids favorite movies.  We are having a difficult time getting past the first 30 minutes because they want to keep rewatching their favorites.  I l also love that I can get books to match all of the videos.  I would HIGHLY recommend this!!!,1441929600,4,345,4.276923076923077

6817856,5,B00PLYU1LS,The Scholastic Storybook DVDs are great for inside recess and for engaging youngsters in story time.,1439596800,,100,5.3125
6817857,5,B00PLYU1LS,Great for kids!  Absolutely love these scholastic collections!,1436832000,,62,6.75
6817858,1,B00PLYU1LS,"I have many of the scholastic storybook treasures and my child absolutely loves them. There are many features that provide quality educational value. They have images that are slow moving rather than over stimulating to a young developing mind. It always feels like a ""book coming to life"" with images that are flat rather than dimensional. It provides a similar reading experience to that of an online book. However, I was disappointed to find that this DVD had no read along feature allowing the kids to view the words at the bottom of the screen. I think it really detracted from the overall educational value and I would not recommend this particular DVD to other moms.",1436313600,4,673,4.810344827586207
6817859,5,B00PLYU1LS,My kids love watching a scholastic story on dvd each night before going up to bed to go to sleep. It shares quality stories with them and helps them wind down before actual story time.,1435276800,,184,4.285714285714286

8688704,4,B00PLYU1LS,"Great for grandchildren ages 3-7 to fill time when you don't want to spend an extended time watching videos.  Offers choices for different ages/interests, and not so long that the others don't have to wait until their turn to watch something they like more or better suited to their age.  Some are better than others, some are dated,  but worth the investment and no download time.  Bargain.",1496880000,,391,4.791044776119403
