5099903,5,B007MRQG1G,"Just watched with a good friend and particularly liked some of the great shots of Beautiful Alaska.
There was a nice interplay between the life of solitude and interplay with the city life. These people were not strange people seeking isolation but rather seeking deeper connection with humankind through a beautiful life of solitude. Oh, I loved finding out more about the Ididerod!(spelling)",1334448000,3,393,5.253968253968254
5099904,1,B007MRQG1G,Awful for the money. Maybe if it was a multipart series. I can't believe how short and shallow the whole thing is. I could have spent no money and had a better show to watch. Make sure to avoid this lame documentary.,1334448000,,216,4.166666666666667
5099905,1,B007MRQG1G,"It makes little sense to me to import things like drywall and 2x4's to the remote Alaskan wilderness and call it living off the grid.  Deep cycle batteries, an inverter, a sump pump, just so you can take a shower?  Oh Brother! Rube Goldberg anyone?  Still relying on the crutch of industrial infrastructure when claiming to want to get away from just that. And what's up with keeping like 60 dogs on a 6 foot lead all day and night except when they're pulling sleds and atv's?  Seems cruel to me.  If my neighbor did that, I'd call animal care and control.  If you want to see a documentary film about living off the grid in Alaska, Check out Alone in the Wilderness.  That dude definitely did not need a generator to scratch his ass....",1334361600,4,737,4.4148148148148145
5099906,5,B007MRQG1G,I felt relaxed and relieved knowing that there are real people out there making hard and real choices.  Good on them...,1334361600,3,119,4.666666666666667
5099907,5,B007MRQG1G,"The film is great. It is certainly a different perspective on life in Alaska. Very informative, which kept my attention. Great job!",1334275200,2,131,5.0
5099908,5,B007MRQG1G,Great film about a few families and their journey into the wilderness.  I really appreciate the production on a subject too rarely covered in film.  Narrator does a great job and approaches the subjects with respect.,1333843200,5,216,4.972222222222222
5099909,5,B007MRQG1G,Vivid look into the lives of people who are living their dream of life in Alaska.  Brilliant video and great Narration.  I would recommend this to others who share the dream.,1333670400,6,174,4.580645161290323
5099910,5,B007MRQG1G,This Alaska show just makes me really think about what life is all about. How these people could go out into the remote wilderness and make a life for themselves. It's a good feeling that there are still people taking the chance to make their lives better by doing their own thing .. more power to the pioneers living life to it's fullest and to this amazing film !!,1332806400,4,366,4.318840579710145
5099911,5,B007MRQG1G,Such a great portrayal of life off the grid in wild Alaska! I enjoyed the people featured in the film and was especially transfixed by their uniquely Alaskan way of living. It seems as if they just figure out a way to make it work for themselves and their families......a refreshing perspective given all the modern day conveniences we have in today's society.,1332288000,8,360,4.73015873015873

5099915,3,B007MRQG1G,It was okay.  I liked the Iditarod coverage and all but otherwise typical stuff for Alaskan shows now.,1484352000,,102,4.666666666666667

5099917,5,B007MRQG1G,"Fantastic documentary/reality movie! It doesn't have the Hollywood garb ax get that so any other ""reality"" shows have and exploit. It's sincere, real Alaska citizens living in very remote locations in Alaska. Being a camper, fisherman, hunter, and trapper, I thoroughly enjoy this movie and highly recommend this movie to ll ho enjoy the wilderness.",1482192000,,349,5.363636363636363

5099919,3,B007MRQG1G,"Interesting show. Not exactly what I expected but it's an interesting look at what it means to live nearly off the grid, or at least extremely rustic, in the modern world.
Would just maybe suggest a little more depth to the show. I would have liked to see more of the family dynamic than the work dynamic. A little slow at times, but still interesting to watch.",1474070400,,361,4.402985074626866

5099921,1,B007MRQG1G,"The synopsis for this documentary is more than misleading. It says that this is about 4 families taking the leap of faith to live off the grid, but it only featured one family. In addition,  it didn't talk about them living off grid other than how they feed their sled dogs.  I don't believe that pbs would have let this show be aired.",1452211200,,335,4.301587301587301
5099922,5,B007MRQG1G,"I love reading listening and watching about Alaska, this movie was short and more of the documentary style which I really like. I was in the mood for the beauty of the outdoors and seeing the ways people cope there.",1451865600,2,215,4.4
5099923,1,B007MRQG1G,Not really what the description said. Mostly focused on one family and that was a family born and raised in Alaska.,1448150400,,115,4.523809523809524
5099924,3,B007MRQG1G,Interesting look at some lives lived in the bush.....but could've used more in-depth insight into why these folks chose this lifestyle?!,1446336000,,136,5.523809523809524

5099926,1,B007MRQG1G,Nothing spectacular about this show.  Don't know why they didn't just base it on dog sledding rather than Alaska living.,1441843200,,120,5.0

5099930,2,B007MRQG1G,"Dull.  This documentary follows mostly the personal lives of people who, quite honestly, don't have lives interesting enough to watch a show about.  Not a homesteading documentary.",1431129600,,180,5.62962962962963
5099931,2,B007MRQG1G,"Fair with minimal autobiographical information. In contrast I really enjoy the tv shows ""Alaskan Bush People"" on the Discovery Channel and ""Life Below Zero"" on the National Geographic Channel.",1430611200,,192,5.655172413793103
5099932,2,B007MRQG1G,"A documentary made from what looks like 6-8hrs of footage taken over a day or two. More of a student project IMO. Was tipped off by the boasting about the voiceover talent....ok, you paid for a professional voiceover....we get it :)",1430179200,2,232,4.682926829268292
5099933,2,B007MRQG1G,This was different than what I thought it would be.  I needed to watch it more than once but I couldn't bring myself to do it. I think it was more realistic and unscripted than other shows.,1426204800,,189,4.108108108108108
5099934,1,B007MRQG1G,"Please don't waste your time or money on this one, unless you're trying to put yourself to sleep via boredom!  The scenery is beautiful (in parts), the narrator has a great voice, but the filming was horribly done, at times you can barely hear the voices of those they are interviewing.  We didn't learn anything new from this program & were disappointed that it primarily surrounded those involved with dog mushing and racing.",1419120000,2,427,4.835616438356165
5099935,2,B007MRQG1G,Not worth renting. Not much good material... very old,1417564800,,53,5.0

5099937,1,B007MRQG1G,Boring. Shut it off after 8 minutes.,1414627200,,36,4.285714285714286
5099938,3,B007MRQG1G,"Not what I really expected, it seemed like the entire first half of the documentary was about the Iditarod.
The second half did get interesting and was what I expected.",1413244800,,168,4.633333333333334
5099939,3,B007MRQG1G,This is more of a documentary without much detail for those trying to test if they to want to face such a challenge as being a modern day pioneer.,1411430400,,146,4.068965517241379
5099940,1,B007MRQG1G,"This show is NOT about modern day Alaskan pioneers, its about dog racing and the Iditarod. That is fine, if you are looking to watch a program on that subject, but I was looking for a program on modern Alaskan pioneers. There is clearly a mismatch between the title of the program and the programs content, which is ultimately a disservice to everyone--people who want to see a program on modern Alaskan pioneers are disappointed, while those who want to see a program on dog racing and the Iditarod, may skip this program based on the title. A more accurate title for this program (based on the majority of the programs content) might be ""Alaskan dog racing, the Iditarod, and its Pioneer Roots.""",1409875200,,697,4.67479674796748

5099942,5,B007MRQG1G,I give this video 5 stars for great video work and showing realistic Alaska living off the grid!  The scenery and music make it even better for anyone to watch!!!,1402444800,,162,4.4
5099943,1,B007MRQG1G,We rented this with the impression it would be about people living off the grid in the wilderness. NOPE!!! It was about a family that lives in the Alaskan wilderness but it focused mainly on their dog sled career. Got extremely bored 3/4 the way through and fell asleep. Would not recommend this to anyone unless they were looking for a way to cure insomnia.,1396396800,,358,4.523076923076923
5099944,1,B007MRQG1G,The description is misleading. I enjoy watching shows about people moving to Alaska to live off the land. This movie showed people who already live in Alaska and have for years.,1396224000,2,177,4.741935483870968
5099945,3,B007MRQG1G,"This was good and I enjoyed it, but hubby fell asleep.
It was cool to see how people live. I wasn't too interested in the iditerod racing however.
It would have been nice to see more on building homes and such.",1392768000,,210,4.146341463414634
5099946,3,B007MRQG1G,"This program was not what I expected. I thought it would be more like Alaska the Last Frontier but it is mostly about the Iditarod participants. It does have one guy in it that lives off grid in Alaska that is not an Iditarod racer and he part is very neat to see.

I think the cover picture should be changed.",1391990400,,310,4.081967213114754
5099947,1,B007MRQG1G,"#1  This movie was mostly about dog sledding.  Then it was about 3 guys who where building cabins in a remote region but it never showed them actually doing anything.  Finally (which felt like 2 hours later) it was about an interesting guy that actually showed a few snippets of how he lived off the grid.  Was not about pioneering.
#2  This movie has no real story line.  It wanders all over the place.
#3  The narrator sounds like he is doing a boring documentary to be shown to 7th graders.
#4  Slooowwwww.  It was a painful 50 minutes.  And, yes, I watched it all.  When it finally started to look like it might contain some info about pioneering lifestyle, it wrapped up with a VERY LONG collection of landscape video (some we had already seen earlier in the film) and ended with a very corny ""There is very little wilderness areas left in the world.  And Alaska is one of them.""  What?
Skip it.  Please.",1390780800,5,909,4.397590361445783
5099948,3,B007MRQG1G,The documentary on the Alaskan eleven hundred mile dog race was good but I paid $2.99 to see a PBS documentary that is usually free.,1389398400,,132,4.32
5099949,1,B007MRQG1G,Description wasn't very accurate.... 80% of show was about one family and their ididarod roots. The description makes it sound like four families taking the leap and moving to Alaska.,1389139200,,183,5.133333333333334
5099950,3,B007MRQG1G,This is for the dog mushers out there.  Mostly about raising dogs in ALASKA.  Lost my interest in about 20 minutes.,1389052800,,115,4.428571428571429
5099951,1,B007MRQG1G,"The majority of the ""film"" if you can call it that is about dog mushing. It is not worth the money nor the time unless you are interested in the Iditarod.  There is very little of any content about survival or Pioneering.

My rating is actually a 1/2 star.  NOT RECOMMENDED.",1388793600,,274,4.333333333333333
5099952,4,B007MRQG1G,This is pretty amazing.  It's a tough life but appears very rewarding.  Wish they showed more of what the women do.,1388448000,,115,4.428571428571429
5099953,1,B007MRQG1G,"Prepare yourself: the first 30 minutes of this show involve two guys who have always lived in Alaska feeding their 64 dogs, while also putting some logs together.  They were not taking a leap of faith to go live off the grid.

By the time the second group of people were introduced, my husband and I had nearly turned the show off.  We aren't interested in the Iditarod, or what kind of food it takes to feed 64 dogs.

I can't tell you much about the second group -- three guys who are good friends who purchased 80 acres of practically inaccessible land so that they could *live free.*  We had to turn it off.

Poorly narrated; poorly constructed; sound issues (the narration would be really loud, and then when the people were interviewed, it got really soft); poorly described.

Please don't waste your money or your time.",1388361600,3,825,4.533783783783784
5099954,1,B007MRQG1G,The description doesn't mention one thing about dog mushing yet almost the entire thing is talking about dog mushing. I wanted to watch a movie about living off the grid in Alaska not learn about some random mushers life.,1388188800,3,221,4.6923076923076925
5099955,3,B007MRQG1G,"Most importantly the description about this ""documentary"" is most misleading so I am issuing a save your money alert. Admittedly, I was already suspicious (and a tad bit worried) that I might get jipped when I saw this movie is under an hour long, but I still decided to give it a whirl being very interested in the subject matter which this film proclaims to be about. I begin watching the film and instead of enjoyment I felt completely stumped. The first half of this short film goes on and on about dogs, sledding, racing and how the dogs that are going to be dog sled racing don't like their fish head soup too hot. This would have been great perhaps except the film is not advertised as a dog sledding documentary, and I hadn't wanted to watch a dog sledding documentary or what temperature to feed them. I still continued to watch in a state of bewilderment (because I had paid for it after all and really its not total rubbish- ""hey, perhaps I was just missing something that was about to become clearer?"" although disappointed I kept thinking ""Isn't this a movie about homesteading?"". Then all of a sudden, now that I had resolved to watch a movie about dogs, the film half way over changes its mind to focus on three young bearded fellows all who have a dream (individually and collectively they discover) to homestead in Alaska. Notice I say ""dream"" about homesteading as they aren't quite there living the dream yet and while I consider the process to realizing the dream very important what is revealed of their process is choppy and superficial. However, their coffee has frozen into a hockey puck again (something which happens often in Alaskan cabins we are told) so they turn on a generator to defrost it, make some coffee, and warm up just enough to day dream some more at their base camp cabin. What is unfortunate about all the time dedicated to dreaming and documenting frozen coffee hockey pucks at base camp cabins- is that we are still several miles from their purchased intended homestead land and unfortunately we never get to see it only hear about it. Weird. Then the film now almost to the end jumps to its last featured fellow who in my opinion seems to be the most interesting, focused, and successful at homesteading overall. Now that I am half way hopes up excited and already 3/4 into what I have renamed the dog-umentry, we continue to peck at surfaces. While I do have the feeling that I would love to know much more about this particular gentleman's story (and all of them on a much deeper level for that matter), and all the knowledge that comes with it alas I know (based on experience) that this will not happen. Now there are only several moments left. All in all this is not the worst film I have ever seen and I didn't hate it or even dislike it, but the film is not what it wanted or claims to be nor does it succeed well in being whatever else did come of it. So Big Alaska Modern Day Pioneers gets a Woof award for get your dog a bone with your $$ instead.",1386806400,12,3002,4.46
5099956,1,B007MRQG1G,"75% of this film was about dog sledding. The showed approx. 6 minutes of actual ""off the grid"" techniques. Very disappointing.",1377820800,11,126,5.0476190476190474
5099957,3,B007MRQG1G,"I was thinking that their would be more to this documentary. The movie jumped around from place to place.

Watching this video it about as lively and exciting as pulling out my old VHS home videos of Christmas Day, with the camcorder sitting on a tripod from the early 90's
One person in the movie owns 64 dogs, and is seen standing around making a huge bowl of soup for the dogs.
The other person is just hanging out at his one room shack, making coffee, bragging about how you have to snow mobile down a dirt road for 12 miles, then paddle up stream in a kayak for 9 miles, then home 4 miles to get to his cabin. And he just stands around and makes coffee over and over. With no insigh of how he even found this land, or ended up with it, how much he bought it for and when ?

5099971,3,B007MRQG1G,"I rented this a little skeptical after reading the reviews. The beginning was dramatic and drawn out (even though it probably lasted a few minutes) with the narrator beckoning ""Alaska....Alaska...."" with different Alaska scenes. While Rob Paul (I think that's his name) was really living off in the woods, one group chronicled had a weekend remote cabin, hoping to make it home. While interesting, there are so many people with weekend cabins, wanting the Alaskan dream. The mushers were fun to watch. I enjoyed the mushers and even though they were road system, they still lived the more obtainable pioneering - living closer to town on the road system but simplifying life.

You will see generators, chainsaws, snowmachines, guns, and the like in this documentary. Anyone that rather have ever log hand hewn, please go build a cabin with hand tools and make a documentary. I have a few friends that live off the land full time. They enjoy the connection to the land but also realize with the array of daily chores to get water, heat, and food daily, there really isn't time to hand hew ever log, to hunt with bow and arrow, or render fat for lamp oil. The modern pioneer balances what (s)he can to survive.

Another fact: living remote takes money! The land, the equipment, the food the land doesn't provide, all adds up to alot of money. That is why some of the modern pioneers are closer to town.

Overall an okay movie to watch to kill airport time. There are some real pioneers in the Alaskan woods still that would make a great documentary.",1358035200,,1547,4.7011070110701105

5099973,3,B007MRQG1G,"Not terrible, not great either. Lots of polish, but very little content. The first half of the movie is pretty much about two dog sledding families (who work together), so the first half seems overly long. There are much better examples of Alaska homesteading, so you should probably just see those (again if you already saw them).",1356912000,,331,4.824561403508772
5099974,3,B007MRQG1G,"When I first saw the title I thought it would be more like a movie about people actually moving and living off the land.  It seemed more like a clip of this and a clip of that with a little back ground but you never really get too personal with the actual charter's.
To me it seemed like the person filming  should have stayed more with one family and went through the whole year in more detail than he did.  I learned a little about sled dogs and saw some nice pictures but I really never felt attached to any one story line (which I felt miss led about in the title).  For a documentary I guess it's ok but as far as a modern day pioneer story I can only give it 3 stars , because it gave some facts of how some people made it in Alaska but not really enough depth to really hold my interest.  Maybe further down the road they will do a actual story of one family for a whole year  or more, and that would be interesting with more depth to their background before they came to Alaska .  For the price it was fare tho.",1356220800,2,1019,3.9901477832512313

Then for some fans who actually went to college there voluntarly and never did I believe their collegiate stories until this.

How unreal is that? (my second career) need an art studio badly, and I wouldnt mind retiring there to be real honest! Make your own conclusons,  bet you find yourself thinking, hmmmm, lookng better all the time!

I enjoy learning how and what are the best ways of doing this for ones self. But, this wasn't anything close to it. There was one man in particular in the movie that showed how he does things on a daily basis, but, didn't show from beginning to end on how he started it all.

So, I do not encourage anyone in buying this movie. I, thank goodness, rented it for one time and glad I did just rent it because basically it was pretty boring. But, does have gorgeous scenery.",1348617600,7,646,4.209677419354839

5099983,5,B007MRQG1G,"Speaking as an Alaska homesteader, I have watched the film several times now, and, read the reviews!
I have to say that the individuals were honest. How refreshing to not see rural Alaskans portrayed as fringe lunatics. We don't need any Jerry Springer drama, to paint us Alaskans and Alaska in a bad light for your entertainment. The vast majority of us homesteaders are intelligent, competent, and well read people, who you would want to have around. our lives take on a regularity and a monotony all it's own, and it's nice to see some real, reality for a change.
Now i'd like to comment on the reviewers.. especially the ones who never will, nor ever could live here. Homesteading is not about deprivation. It's about peace, peace of mind, and personal challenge and growth. Its about the american dream, of living life on your own terms. If that means you want drywall in your cabin/house/whatever.. then go for it! I thought the comments about having a generator and such absolutely laughable. How condescending of you to presume to tell us how we should live... There is nothing from stopping you, my metrosexual friends, from throwing your conveniences away and going caveman... but you won't...
I'll tell you what.. anybody who can drag sheetrock through the Alaska bush, and get it to their homestead in good enough condition to use is one tough hombre... much easier to drag a log a hundred yards...
As far as the glowing reports on Dick Proenneke... He is all, our hero and idol... but would you throw him under the bus if you knew he often ran an outboard motor on that canoe?... There is a lot more written about Mr. Proenekke, than that PBS documentary... Mr Proenekke had every convenience he wished.... that simple... even a poly underlayment on his cabin roof.... that bastard!!!.....
So if you think you know it all, and want to judge homesteading in Alaska, and the video itself, instead of using it as a learning tool and insight into actual bush life, then I glady invite you up here to ""help out""..... it just may open your eyes a bit...
As for my personal opinion of the video... I think that the portrayal of those in the video was exceptional.... nothing hollywood, or pumped up.... just real.. and honest... was it complete?.. well it's hard to tell a story like this in one video.. but it is a real nice taste, and I hope there are more video's of this type. I really enjoyed the scenics and thought the footage was great... Stuff like this makes me proud to be an Alaskan... and I know from the video and the filmmaker.. that I am in good company...",1340150400,58,2578,4.618736383442266

I grew up in Alaska which means I'm no expert but every time they cut to an outdoor scene regardless of the season you can hear a raven. I thought it was odd hearing it during the winter so much. I listened a bit closer and they are using a loopback of the same call. Depending on the length of the scene, a pattern of 5 then 2 calls with a small bit of some small songbird.

5099991,3,B007MRQG1G,There are a number of documentaries out there on people that have chosen to move off the grid and this really is the least interesting one I've seen.

What are the technological implications of moving off the grid? What does the lifestyle actually look like? This film does a really superficial job of touch on any of these issues.  About as much as a person who knows absolutely nothing about the subject is likely to touch upon if given 2-3 weeks to make a documentary.,1334620800,3,633,4.504347826086956
