8733294,4,B015EC6Y9O,"Well move the hell over Gutterballs, there's a new psycho sex slasher themed movie that makes Gutterballs look like Happy Death Day.
If you've seen Gutterballs, expect more of the same but on a more ridiculous and graphic level. (minus bowling alley)
Not the tightest gore I've seen by far, but it is abundant along with naked girls and an old man, just because! Yuck! (the worst part)
If you haven't seen Gutterballs, well let's just say watch that first and if you liked it then you will probably not mind a good viewing of Death-scort service.
Otherwise steer clearl of movie.",1531267200,,579,4.686274509803922
8733295,3,B015EC6Y9O,Positives - Lots of female nudity. Full  frontals. Up close views. All the women except for one have beautiful real breasts. Negatives - Darn near all the women are covered with tattoos and have body piercings. All the women are bald.,1523318400,,234,4.7073170731707314

I recommend!",1475107200,3,270,4.211538461538462

8733300,4,B015EC6Y9O,Fun throwback to 80s SOV slashers. Don't expect a big budget Hollywood horror film. Lots of nudity and graphic gore.,1452470400,8,116,4.85
8733301,3,B015EC6Y9O,"Having finding out about this movie from Bloodbath and Beyond (YouTube), I was interested in this.

This low-budget exploitation film was entertaining for what it is, a bad sleazy movie. (Hence the company's name SleazeBox)

Things I Liked:

-The nudity. My god the nudity was awesome and plenty to see. The Russian girl was the best though.

- The gore was actually good for the low-budget this had. Really nice gore and plenty of it for you gore-hounds.

-the woman for the most part were gorgeous.

-the name ""Death-Scort Service"" is nice.

-the directing was passable, had some nice shots here and there though.

Things I Didn't Like:

-the acting was bad but expected.

-that stupid annoying techno song that played throughout some of the scenes.

-SPOILER: old man nudity.

-the characters of the girls were mostly stupid. Why would you work with a John that's obviously trying to hide his identity; wearing gloves, using a deep voice, covering his face.

Overall, I had a fun time with this movie. Also watching the DVD, I'm interested in Sleazebox's other films, in particular Amerikan Holokaust & Die Die Delta Pi. I recommend this if you like cheap exploitation films with nudity and gore galore.",1448150400,5,1206,4.8817733990147785
