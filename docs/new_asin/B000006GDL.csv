1193654,1,B000006GDL,"If you crossed ""Halloween II"" with ""I Spit on Your Grave"" and subtracted the sex & nudity of the latter, you'd get ""Visiting Hours,"" a would-be horror movie that pits an outspoken TV personality (Lee Grant, in an awful performance) against a hulking, muscular freak who has a personal vendetta against her (although it's not made clear exactly WHAT that vendetta is).  He attacks her in her home once, and when she's transferred to a hospital, there's even more chances for his deadly intent.  Unfortunately, this is less a horror film and more a portrait of Humans Behaving Badly, with Michael Ironside doing a good job of being imposing and threating, but also unrelentingly unpleasant as a result.  Jean-Claude Lord's direction sucks the suspense out of scenes, and in the end, ""Visiting Hours"" is just one big 'kill-or-be-killed' festival with the typical undercurrents of misogyny.  Avoid it.",982713600,5,897,5.081632653061225

1193677,4,B000006GDL,"I see a lot of negative reviews about ""Visiting Hours"" saying it's a rip off of Halloween 2 .Not the case,it's quite different and it's a good movie,the only similarities is most of it takes place in a hospital.

The cast is great,Michael Ironside is very believable and frightening as the stalker and Linda Purl is at her best as the nurse who is also a single mother trying to get by,if I see any similarities it would be with the film ""When a stranger calls"".Visiting Hours isn't a hard core slasher flick but it is a thriller filled with white knuckle moments and violence. This movie works because you care about the people that are being terrorized so when they are threatened and hurt you feel it too. Lee Grant does a good job as the outspoken TV Journalist ""Deborah Balin""who is very vocal about anti violence but when confronted with the choice of kill or be killed will she be so docile and anti violent? watch and see.

All in all it's an entertaining thriller ""not horror"" that is not forgettable but one you will want to see again one cold night tightly tucked under your blankets..",1250035200,,1096,4.50251256281407
1193678,1,B000006GDL,"I have just received a new copy of this movie and it was not the same movie I saw in 1975/81.  The original movie was very suspenseful and was much more gory and bloody than this apparent remake was.

Most of the movie was involved in the hospital, but in evening hours with Lee Grant listening and hearing the bell around his neck and he continued to butcher most of the hospital personnel.

Like I said it was very gory and a good slasher flick.  I do not know how this revised copy ever made it to the DVD market. I am deeply disappointed and I believe that all sellers of this movie should make a separate statement to indicate that this is a REVISION of the original movie.

If you are interested in this movie, please try to find the orignal uncut version.  I have a copy in VHS and it is extremely good.",1243382400,3,810,4.193548387096774
1193679,2,B000006GDL,"What a dud this was, in fact the title of my review is the most tastless thing you'll find involved with this ""slasher"" film from 1981.  For anybody even mildly interested in the usual trappings of the genre (i.e. nudity and gore), I'd recommend clicking the back button now and typing ""The Burning"" in the search bar at the top of the screen (thank me later).  The reason I put slasher in quotes above is because that's what it refers to itself on the back of the DVD, but actually it's more of a mediocre thriller that I could see my parents giving a watch (and they don't like horror so... that's not a good thing!).  The story follows a pychopath on the hunt for an outspoken female journalist whose stance on self-defense against abusive husbands links to his past and enrages him.  She is also strongly against violence which, of course, will be put to the test when faced with the killer in the film's finale.  The movie gets 2 stars on the merits of being well made and acted, and featuring a few nice moments of tension (particularly the first assault from the killer), but it's still a bland piece of cinema that takes itself far too serious and feels like a solid made for TV movie.  Even Michael Ironside as the protagonist of the film is wasted here... menacing at times, of course that's only when he's not falling down, having his apartment vandalized by former rape victims, or losing his knife?!?!  Beyond the cool cover on the DVD, I was checking this out due to it being on the infamous ""Video Nasties"" list of banned films in the UK at one time... why it made the list I'll never understand?  Literally 3 deaths occur on screen, none of them bloody or graphic in any way, shape, or form.  Visiting Hours is highly passable viewing, delivering nothing noteworthy for genre fans... William Shatner does appear though!",1218240000,12,1835,4.553191489361702
1193680,5,B000006GDL,"The Film:  Visiting Hours
Year Made:  1981

Overview:  A man who is still traumatized by events that transpired from his childhood of his abusive dad against his mother, goes on a killing spree. His target is a news anchore woman who speaks out against violence and triggers the killers' inner rage.  The hospital should be a place of safety and healing, but visiting hours is about to begin!

The Package:  3 Stars.  The outside of the DVD holder has a eerie picture of the hospital with a skull in the windows.  The inside of the case does not have any kind of inlay which is disappointing though.  The disc itself has graphics of doctors faces on it wearing masks, which although cool, it would have been more creepy to have the killer himself wearing a doctor mask.  The disc stays in place in the holder very nice and is easy to pop out of the tray also.  There are TV trailers and radio spots on the extras as well as some movie previews for other films which I always like to watch.  Overall a good package but could have been better and should have come with closed captioning which is missed greatly.

Spook Meter:  4 Stars.  Visiting hours is a creepy film.  The killer hardly talks at all, yet is shown clearly throughout the film.  Brilliant camera work  as the killer is walking as well as all the pictures on the walls of his apartment where he keeps photographs of his victims he has killed, really bring the overall creepiness' to life as you watch this.  I loved the fact that most of the action takes place in a hospital setting which works very well here. The flashbacks of the killers dad being abusive to his mother and seeing the conflicting hatred he has for his dad and also for his mother for what she did to his dad is brilliant.  That is made clearer as he kills women and men as things progress. Michael Ironside played the part of the killer to perfection and he truly fit the roll well in his look as well as acting.  William Shater I thought was one character that did not fit well in this film.  William Shatner is a superb actor, but he just didn't seem right for this.

Gore/Violence Meter:  5 Stars.  In the gore department, I would rate this about average for a slasher film, it's got some blood but it's not excessive at all.  Violence is why I drove the meter way high.  The visual effect and the slow prolonged death scenes when someone is killed as well as the killer taking pictures while the victim is dying is very intense.  The visual/brutal way it's all acted out and captured will make you cringe and feel each and every death scene.  Very violent!

Profanity Meter:  5 Strikes.  Sadly, this was a huge letdown.  Why all the profanity, I really feel it spoils any film and this one had a lot of language throughout.  I hope a closed captioned version comes out so at least my editer will work!

Sexual Meter:  2 Strikes.  There is not much as far as offensive scenes.  There is one scene while the killer has a woman over at his place and begins to get a bit rough with her and pulls her hair.  Nothing much is shown overall though and there is no nudity at all, although the woman does take off her jeans and is standing in her panties at one point.  One other scene, the killer is shown reaching down with his hand under a woman's shirt, although suggestive, nothing is shown and no nudity here either.  I'll bump up the sexual meter to two stars for these scenes but overall this was non offensive in this area for most viewers.

Final Thoughts:  Visiting hours is very well done and what I consider to be a highly underrated lost gem in the slasher film genre.  When most people think of horror/slasher films, they think of the main ones like Friday the 13th, Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street.  Visiting hours IS that good and even though it stands as a somewhat unrecognized film in the classic time of the early 80s, any true horror slasher fan will love this brutal uniqueness of Visiting Hours.  The one single let down of it was all language, if not for the language, I'll stand on my 5 star rating as a horror slasher film and rank it right up their in my list of all time favorite horror films.",1210809600,10,4153,4.382699868938401
1193681,4,B000006GDL,"In the 80's, there were numerous Halloween copycats. There was Prom Night, Terror Train, Friday the 13th, etc. However, Visiting Hours might be the only Halloween II copycat. It's set in a hospital, just like Halloween II, and it was released just one year later. However, those aren't the only similarities. The killer, played by Michael Ironside, stalking the hospital corridors searching for his surviving victim, just like in Halloween II.
I know it sounds like I'm writing Visiting Hours off as just a rip-off, but it's not just that. It has plenty of jump-out-of-your-seat moments, Michael Ironside makes for one creepy victim, and the finale is good slasher fun.
If you're looking for an 80's psycho-thriller, you could do worse than Visiting Hours.",1183939200,3,756,5.104838709677419
1193682,1,B000006GDL,"i can't believe that they got money to make this ""movie""(i use that term loosly). the plot has more holes than you can count and the worst excuse for a reason to start a killing spree that i have ever seen. not even worth the price of a rental. just long and slow. you have been warned!",1148342400,4,286,4.035087719298246
1193683,4,B000006GDL,"Boy, is Michael Ironside (Scanners, Starship Troopers) ever mad! He's just seen Lee Grant on TV, telling the world that an abused woman was right to shoot her brutish husband in self-defense. You see, Ironside's character, Colt Hawker (!), had a bad childhood w/ a drunk dad and a mum who tossed hot grease in dad's face. Now, Hawker hates all women and especially the uppity ones like Grant's character! He attempts to murder her w/ his footlong switchblade, but she has the audacity to survive! Hawker comes after her in the hospital, leading to many deaths and a game of hide 'n' seek between Ironside and Grant ala Halloween 2. I like this one! We even get Linda Purl as a nurse and William Shatner (Incubus, Devil's Reign) as Grant's utterly useless boss! Ironside was born menacing and always gives me the creeps! He's truly sadistic and twisted in VH, and that's a good thing. Lee Grant is strong and likeable in her role. Definitely worth owning...",1146009600,4,956,4.696428571428571
1193684,3,B000006GDL,"So what happens when you mix four parts of an overly long Lifetime Channel movie with two parts slasher film?  You get the feature Visiting Hours (1982).  Written by Brian Taggert (Of Unknown Origin, ""V"", Poltergeist III) and directed by Jean-Claude Lord (The Vindicator, Eddie and the Cruisers II: Eddie Lives!), the film stars Academy Award winner Lee Grant (In the Heat of the Night, Shampoo, Voyage of the Damned), Linda Purl (""Port Charles"", Mighty Joe Young), and Michael Ironside (Top Gun, Highlander II: The Total Recall, Quickening).  Also appearing is William `The Shat' Shatner (Big Bad Mama, Kingdom of the Spiders, Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan) and Harvey Atkin (The Incubus, Speed Zone!), who I remember best as the hapless summer camp proprietor Morrie from the Bill Murray comedy Meatballs (1979).

Grant plays Deborah Ballin, a television personality and outspoken women's rights advocate.  After a particularly controversial interview, she returns to her home only to find a knife wielding, homicidal manic has gained entry into her abode (I hate when that happens), which, by the way, sure has a lot of empty liquor bottles scattered about (either Deborah's recently had a party or she's a real booze hound)...the guy, who we later learn is a real piece of work named Colt Hawker (Ironside) appears nekkid, wearing all Ms. Ballin jewelry for some reason (I especially liked the pearl earring in the nose as it's a good, pirate type look), sporting about the largest switchblade I've ever seen.  Deborah manages to escape (not before Colt gets in a couple of good swipes), and is taken to County General Hospital, which, in retrospect, may have been a bad choice as the facility has some of the worst security measures I've ever seen.  At the hospital she meets a pretty young nurse named Sheila Munroe (Purl), who takes a personal interest in Ms. Ballin out of admiration (the two become quite chummy), I suppose, because Ballin is presented as a strong, self actualized, independent figure...or something like that.  Shortly after Deborah's admittance Colt begins sneaking into the hospital (as a delivery person, an orderly, and a doctor no less), kills a few patients in an effort to get to Deborah (his fixation for her is very strong), and eventually focuses some of his attentions on Shelia, stalking her and her children (Shelia's a single mother of two).  Some flashbacks are dumped in our laps in an effort to clue us in on the source of Colt's nuttiness (it's always the parents fault) leading up to Colt admitting himself (sort of), in an interesting and wacky way, in an effort to get at both Shelia and Deborah, both of whom have not only survived his attacks but also have seen his face and therefore can identify him.  Once in, Colt proceeds in full-on homicidal mode, increasing the mortality rate of County General considerably...

I dug some parts of this Canadian made film, as I thought there was a good deal of overall effort involved, but I think it could have been a whole lot better had they made a few changes.  The one main aspect I would have changed is removing one of the two, main female characters, either Deborah or Shelia.  With the inclusion of both the story had to spend time on both therefore dragging out the overall runtime to just over an hour and forty minutes.  I have no problem with strong, leading female characters but I didn't see the point in having two of them here.  Had either one been removed, the story could have been adjusted appropriately and carried on just as well, with a slightly shorter run time and possibly a quicker pace.  Both actresses did well enough (I was sort of surprised to see Grant in a feature like this), but neither really stood out all the much for me only because their characters were sort of one-dimensional.  As far as Ironside, I'd say he did very well if I hadn't seen him play similar roles in a number of other films.  Riding on the crazy train might be fun, but like anything, it gets old after awhile.  The reasoning behind his misogynistic and homicidal tendencies seemed a little skimpy in terms of a colorful antagonist back story one would normally expect from a slasher film, but, like I said in the beginning, this felt more like a Lifetime Channel feature with slasher tendencies.  The one thing that annoyed me about Ironside's character was the ease of which he could maneuver about, especially in terms of gaining access to areas within the hospital.  I'd like to think it wouldn't have been as easy as it was, but who knows?  And let's face it, Michael Ironside isn't the type to blend in so easily, as he sports some pretty distinctive characteristics, so it was difficult for me to believe he hadn't been caught for his antics prior to him latching onto Deborah.  As far as The Shat, I'm really not sure what the hell he was doing in this movie (he plays a television producer) other than picking up a check between Star Trek films.  His character really didn't do much of anything...pull out a phaser, shoot off a photon torpedo, pork a comely alien...do something...as far as gore content, there's some, but a lot less than what I would have expected (the broken bottle sequence near the end was nifty).  There were some decent scares scattered throughout the film, many of them of the misdirection kind (the focus of a scene might have you looking here, but the scare comes from somewhere else), along with some well developed suspense sequences, but had the filmmakers shaved about fifteen or twenty minutes off the running time (perhaps dumping a few useless characters), I think this would have been a much tighter feature.

The picture quality on this Anchor Bay Entertainment DVD release is very sharp and clean, and comes across nicely in widescreen (1.85:1), enhanced for 16X9 TVs and the mono audio comes through well enough.  There is really not much in terms of extras except four television spots, one radio spot, and previews for other Anchor Bay DVD releases like The Anniversary (1968), The Entity (1981), Quicksilver Highway (1997), Ghost in the Machine (1993), and Bad Dreams (1988).  Also, I thought the interactive menus not all that attractive...it was obvious they were going for a psychotic theme to fit in with the film, but they just come off as looking haphazard and sloppy, in my opinion.  At the very least the presentation of the film is exceptional, so the rest matters little to me.

I did learn one thing while watching this film, and that is if you're ever being pursued by a knife wielding, homicidal manic, a dumbwaiter elevator probably isn't the best place to hide...",1145491200,7,6639,4.787215411558669
1193685,1,B000006GDL,"After loving Halloween 2, and it's creepy hospital setting, I was very excited to hear that there were two other hospital-slashers in the early 80's; this and ""Hospital Massacre"". I hadn't been able to find these two movies until I went to this video store out of town that is known for having a HUGE selection, as well as a lot of hard-to-find movies. I was very pleased to not only find ""Visiting Hours"" and ""Hospital Massacre"", but a whole other bunch of scary movies I wanted to see. I got ""Sleepaway Camp 2"", and then decided to get only one hospital movie; I chose ""Visiting Hours"" due to the supieror cover art. Well, it's no Halloween 2. In fact, it's not even a slasher movie!; it's purely a drama, laced with thriller/suspense elements. And it's boring, boring, boring...One other problem is that alot of the movie foucuses on the killers personal life. We see him talk and act in his ""normal"" life. This not only made it more boring, but it made it so the guy wasn't even so scary anymore! The hospital setting is not that creepy even, and the parts in the hospital that are soppoused to be suspensful and scary don't happen till towards the end. Other Notes: ""Visiting Hours"" was actually based off a book, which is now out of print. And most horror films based off books aren't always all that exciting. This isn't...Lastly, this is a very ""mature"" kind of horror film; it isn't something you'd watch on Halloween with a group of freinds, and doesn't have the thrills and chills of ""Halloween 2"" or the fun of the ""Friday the 13th"" series.

What all three films have in common is a psychotic killer-maniac (obsessively hates women) who stalks his female victims and kills them.  The movie is quite good for an independent production.  Actually, as I recall Canada released some pretty good movies between late 1970's and early 1980's. What really captured my addition in this film is an elaborate plot and very well done character study.  Michael Ironside is what makes this film.  Great performance.

As an adult, you re-watch these movies to see if they still hold up, or if you can see why it would scare you as a child in the first place. This 1982 film is one of those movies. I remember being totally creeped out by it as a kid when it would be on cable a lot back in the day. I am trying to collect the scary/horror movies I love or get the obscure ones I have yet to see. This is one that was on my list. So, what did I think?

Lee Grant (Academy Award Winner for ""Shampoo"" ) stars as Deborah Ballin, a TV talk show host who lashes out at violence in the world. During her most recent telecast, Deborah defends a woman who took action against her abuser. This does not sit well for the disturbed Colt (the chilling Michael Ironside). As we learn through flashbacks in the film, Colt, as a youngster, witnessed the same sort of thing between his mom and abusive father. Colt snaps and makes his first attack on Deborah. This leaves her still alive and taken to the local hospital where Deborah is cared for by a young nurse (Linda Purl), and where Colt comes to finish what he started.

There's always been something great about a hospital set suspense/stalk-a-thon. 1981's ""Halloween II"" is a favorite. A film I thought was very atmospheric and spooky. This film makes pretty good use of it's eerie setting. The director sets up some fun moments and suspenseful scenes. It really works and can be quite chilling at times. This also helps becuse you have a pretty strong cast here. Lee Grant, Linda Purl, Michael Ironside and, yes, William Shatner. Shatner isn't really needed, since his role isn't much, but I guess they wanted another big, recognizable name here. But something must be said for Ironside. His performance here as Colt is chilling, disturbing, and scary. If nothing else, he is the reason to see this movie. He is a movie bad guy that will stick with you after the movie is over. Also, I am not one who has ever cared for seeing our creepy killer out in the open and seeing his face all the time as if he were a normal person. However, I make an exception with this movie. It just works, and it's because of Ironside. Seeing his face and his reactions and emotions is part of what makes this guy the character that he is. Again, a testament to Ironside. He's the best one in the cast, but everyone else does their thing. You want Lee Grant to win. You care about Linda Purl. You wonder how much William Shatner got paid for this.

Gore/blood wise, the movie is pretty light on the red stuff and any other gore that fans like and may want or expect from this movie. Body count is also pretty low.

""Visiting Hours"" does not re-invent the wheel or set the bar so incredibly high that it will never be reached. No, ""Visiting Hours"" is a solidly crafted, written and performed little stalking movie that deliveres some striking moments (like the opening scene in Ballin's house and other hospital/home scenes). It can be effective when it wants to be. I am glad that I re-discovered this movie. I had fun with it.",1315526400,2,3103,4.4101221640488655
