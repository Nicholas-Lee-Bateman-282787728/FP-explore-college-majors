8100403,5,B000CQM514,I RECEIVED THE AEROBICS TAPE ON TIME. I LIKE IT BECAUSE IT IS SLOW AND IT GIVES ME TIME TO DO AT MY ON PACE.,1353974400,,108,3.36
8100404,1,B000CQM514,"Like the other review I think this is a poorly executed DVD. However, on the flip-side, I felt that there wasn't enough instruction. You were pretty much expected to already know the moves and what was coming up to be able to execute the routine. There was no breaking down of the moves so you could learn them. I did about 20 minutes before I gave up. Looking for another workout DVD now.",1329264000,,389,4.342465753424658
8100405,1,B000CQM514,"I was really disappointed in this video.  After watching 30 minutes of unexciting explanation of Ms. Marmorat's dance routine, I quit.  I don't  know if there is actually an exercise video after the narration ends because I never made it to the end.  In addition, the routine being explained was more of a dance routine than what I consider to be an exercise routine.  The video is just sitting on the shelf unused now.",1234051200,10,419,4.608108108108108
