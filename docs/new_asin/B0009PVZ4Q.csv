8065305,2,B0009PVZ4Q,"I love this artist. I watch his movies and listen to his songs whenever I get the chance. I have some of his movies, and I went to watch them in theaters all over Mexico. I have many of his tapes and CDs. I wasn't enough. This selected clips are fine and the narration is good. The restoration work is horrible. I've watched many of the films the clips were extracted from. I'd guess that this studio? didn't spend $5. pesos on the work. Some clips remind of when I watched the movie and 50 people, sitting in front of me, were all smoking. The great Mariachi bands sound really bad. I guess that, maybe, 10 minutes of video were clear and sharp. This could have been a wonderful viewing experience. Perhaps after reading this the company will hire more competent people.",1221609600,3,771,4.436619718309859
