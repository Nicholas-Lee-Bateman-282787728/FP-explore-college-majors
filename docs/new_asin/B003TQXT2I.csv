8405404,4,B003TQXT2I,"If you are into Aleister Crowley and his life story, you will find it interesting. If you don't know who he is, do not waste your time. The acting is atrocious and the production is very bad. If I weren't into the occult and interested in Crowley (and if I didn't have a clue) I would be puzzled by the entire thing. If you are into all this, you will at least appreciate a more in-depth look at his life and antics.",1401408000,,416,4.085365853658536
8405405,3,B003TQXT2I,"I have always thought that Aliester Crowley and John Dee represent wonderful cautionary tales regarding the dangers of the sort of mysticism that Hermetic magick (adopting Crowley's spelling for the purpose of this review) and its offshoots contain.  That is not to say that these men were wicked in themselves or that the tradition is bad, just that some emphases of the tradition give rise to certain dangers including some spectacular falls.

This current movie attempts to look at Crowley as a cult leader and con artist.  It provides a great deal of information that is useful in considering and critiquing this important thinker (who one of the more influential voices in his area).  For that the movie is to be commended.

However, this is a movie which gets so lost in ambivalence that it often fails to create tension.  One gets the sense of reading a poorly written, dry history book where the only interest in it might be to peer beyond the events and trying to make sense out of them in a way which is different than the film writer or director's sense.  We don't really get to know many of the characters and the stance on whether magick works is more or left unanswered.

In this regard, I think the movie is a failure, but at least it is a deeply interesting one.  I think those who are interested in Crowley will want to have this in their collections.  Others, not so much.",1299888000,4,1390,4.5910931174089065

Abbey Of Thelema gives us an unbiased glimpse at who some consider a saint and others consider the wickedest man on earth, ALEISTER CROWLEY. According to a recent poll taken in Britian, Aleister Crowley is one of the most influential men of all time. This DVD takes an honest look at Aleister Crowley, showing his strong points and his shortcomings. It does not hold any punches. The acting I would consider average, it is hard at first to accept Mike Ketcher and Aleister Crowley but somehow halfway through the movie you are very comfortable with his accent and mannerisms. Another thing I like are the vibrant colorful actual murals that were  digitally restored in the movie. I highly recommend the DVD not only for the merit of content but with Independent Film companies, you never know how many units will be distributed, so Abbey Of Thelema has a potential to be a rarity and a collector's item worth alot more than 12.99 in the near future.",1277510400,10,1027,4.612021857923497
