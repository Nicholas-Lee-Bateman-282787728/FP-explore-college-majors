8416992,4,B004648VXY,Our kids love Shalom Sesame.  It isn't overrun with too much information that the kids feel like it's a teaching DVD but it does have enough to expose them to new words and Jewish concepts.  Not for the well versed children but good for beginning teaching tools and the characters and actors are great.,1395100800,,302,4.574074074074074

8416994,5,B004648VXY,"My grandson is almost 2 and he really enjoys watching the Shalom Sesame movies! Children learn basic customs, Hebrew numbers and letters from various characters (human and puppets) and also learns from other children. I recommend the Shalom Sesame movies!",1360368000,,255,5.4

8416996,2,B004648VXY,"I think this DVD is suited for very young children, around 2 - 3 years old, or for a child who has NO exposure to Sukkot and has not seen many sukkahs.

My 5 1/2 year old daughter did not learn anything in this DVD except how to say the number 6 in Hebrew. It gave very little information about the Sukkot holiday and about a sukkah. For example, though it shows a etrog and a lulav being used, it does NOT explain why they are part of Sukkot and used in a sukkah.  And it gave one sentence, maybe two, on the history of the holiday.

Why did I buy it?  Because someone recently gave us a different Shalom Sesame: ""Shabbat Shalom, Grover.""  My 5 1/2 year old daughter loves it.  She continues to watch it over and over and I think it is a great learning DVD about Shabbat.  Based on our reactions, I bought ""MONSTERS IN THE SUKKAH.""  We watched it today.  I would return it had I bought it directly from the company who produced it.  But I bought it through a third party in amazon.com and don't want to hurt the ""middle man"" so to speak.

I am sad to give this DVD such a low rating as I would love to support any Jewish learning product.",1318723200,2,1139,4.085585585585585
8416997,5,B004648VXY,"We love these DVDs! We had gone to a promotional event at our local Jewish Community Center and saw one episode and loved it. They are perfect for Jews of any denomination. I love that my children are learning about Israel, holidays and Hebrew from the makers of Sesame Street and with the great characters from it! I would recommend for any Jewish family!",1318118400,,356,4.578125
8416998,5,B004648VXY,"This is a wonderful DVD.  I really enjoyed learning about Sukkot and watching the adorable skits.  It opens with Abby and another Sesame Street character talking about Sukkot and their sukkah falls down.  Grover then appears with a Sukkah building book for klutzes.  The show then moves on to a cute animated song and dance about the different tools used in construction products.  Throughout the show we see different types of sukkot being built.  The show features the number six and the Count, street dancers, and other animations teach kids how to count to six in both Hebrew and English.

The show does a beautiful job blending skits with animation, kids, Sesame Street characters, and Israeli life.  Kids and adults can learn something new about Sukkot every time that they watch it.  I cannot recommend it enough.",1314316800,,820,4.927007299270073
