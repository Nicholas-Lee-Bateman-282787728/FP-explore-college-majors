  if you have a free weekend, a cheap camera [well, middle of the road camera], some poorly dressed freinds- with limited acting skills, a half-assed script, and the desire to make a film short [even if you use video]; then this may serve as an idea to get you started.  it is better then 'dead clowns' or the 'blaire witch project'.

  p.s.- it's 28 minutes long!",1294099200,,691,4.5

Jake Silbermann, who stars on the currently cancelled soap opera, ""As The World Turns"" is hilarious and has great comedic-timing in this film.",1278374400,3,259,4.7555555555555555
