You're not getting your heart rate up with this one, but if you really move and get into it you can burn some calories. I love Leslie's personality and you really do feel like you're just out walking with friends, so it's a mood lifter.",1448236800,,322,4.209677419354839

8028304,5,B0002JZT6Y,"I love these old exercise tapes. I used these to shed all of my pregnancy weight. It only took 15 minutes to complete one mile. Surprisingly, this still provided a good workout for me to get back in shape. In conjunction with eating healthy, this worked wonders. It may seem cheesy, but its great!",1405555200,,297,4.518518518518518
8028305,5,B0002JZT6Y,"This is a good walking exercise, especially since I'm 64 yrs. old and not able to go out alone.  I'm happy with the time clock provided throughout to let me know how far I've gone.  Leslie Sansone is a great motivator.  The exercises are for all ages and you can pace yourself.  I have six of her sessions and I plan to buy more.  Good investment!",1382400000,,347,4.196969696969697

8028307,5,B0002JZT6Y,"I love all of the 4 tapes I have of Leslie Sansone. I have the 1-mile, 2 mile and 3 mild walks. Also the 10 minute abs. I have been doing this for the last 10 years. Some weeks, I do them every day. Some weeks, just 3 times a week.
But at any rate they are excellent workouts. I keep my joints moving with these workouts. I can choose whichever  one I want depending on the time I have that day!",1315785600,2,395,3.817073170731707

A perfectly enjoyable workout for someone like me who needs to exercise for her health without feeling like she has been run over by a Mack Truck afterward!  Love it!",1285632000,2,286,4.7
