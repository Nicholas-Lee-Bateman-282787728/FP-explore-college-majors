8251035,2,B0013HXB1Y,this dvd is a 12 chapter story based on the old style cliffhangers in the 50's.  the story and acting is very cheesey and the whole film was in black and white.  it would be better in color.  this dvd is overpriced forr what you actually get.  this movie is like a high school film project.  i can find better stuff on you tube,1403049600,,327,4.046875
8251036,4,B0013HXB1Y,this was an excellent dvd. The park ranger Patricia King is in peril in every chapter from the 1st chapter to the last chapter. The only complaint i have is the sound quality is poor at times and she does get knocked out to easily but other than that it was excellent.,1215475200,,268,4.173076923076923
