8384517,5,B002ZBDOOQ,"I watched the fansubbed version when it was first released online, loved it! I have a bad habit of watching Bleach both subbed and dubbed, so I can't wait for November 15, which is when the Dub is scheduled to come out. At least I hope so.

I enjoyed the Hollow-style Rukia in contrast to the stereotypical Hollow Ichigo, which made for a fine change in scenery.

All in all, excellent movie.",1320105600,,392,4.430555555555555
8384518,5,B002ZBDOOQ,"i saw the movie when it was first released over here in the states.  i have noticed that when the next movie comes out the one prior to it comes out on dvd.  like when the diamond dust rebellion was released, memories of nobody was released on dvd and the same when fade to black came out diamond dust rebellion was released on dvd.  in other words we will be waiting for the fourth movie to come out before we are able to buy this one.",1311724800,,436,4.046511627906977
8384519,4,B002ZBDOOQ,"This is the best of the three Bleach movies that I've seen to date (I haven't seen the fourth one yet). It focuses primarily on Ichigo and Rukia and their relationship; there are no other members of the 'substitute group' (Uryu, Chad, Orihime) in the movie, unless you count Renji and Kon. It takes place almost entirely in Soul Society, and as a bonus, we get to see Urahara in his Soul Reaper garb, and ALL of the Captains in action. Even Kisuke, who rarely lifts a finger to fight, does so. Exciting stuff. We also get a bit of Rukia's past before she became a Soul Reaper.

I don't know why they are making us wait sooooo long in the US for this one, they didn't for the first two! We're willing to pay money for it, so why the holdup? (HELLO MCFLY! VIZ - ARE YOU LISTENING????). At the rate they are going, the fourth movie will be out on DVD in Japan, and they'll probably be releasing a fifth in the theaters before we see this one dubbed in English (pure conjecture on my part, no I haven't heard anything!). The only thing I can think of is that they are focusing on dubbing the series before the movie....

Long story short, as soon as this is FINALLY released in English, snap it up. It's worth it.",1309824000,,1209,4.252173913043478
8384520,5,B002ZBDOOQ,"This is a great movie, but like all VIZ media products, we we be waiting a long while to see it on video.  That is why on tv we are on episode 200 and the videos are still only around 140 (may be higher)  Why should we have to wait months on end to get these dvds.  The wait for movies are even worse.  The Japanese will get Movie 4 before we get movie 3",1301529600,,354,3.68
8384521,5,B002ZBDOOQ,"I have seen this movie, It is a fantastic side story. Evening though it is an action anime, it does relate the power of friendship and comraderie. Getting down to brass facts, it a good movie and should not be withheld from fans who would pay for the DVD. I would, Hurry up and release it.",1301443200,3,289,4.178571428571429
8384522,5,B002ZBDOOQ,"This Moive is out for a long time now.... and i Belive that the 3rd Movie is the best its as if the first 2 where just part of show and NOT a Movie. The 3rd Movie gives you the feeling of all of the shows good parts. When he saves the girl get to ""lvl 2"" power wise and when he get to ""lvl 3"" and Whats even better then the feeling that all of that gave you. Without saying to much you get to see ALL of the Captins uesd there power : ) God the Twin bleads are bad ass.

BUT WHY are they not pushing to get this to us in the USA? we do show a HELL of a lot of love and a lot of $$ for the show so you would think that they would happyly make Money off this Movie the Best one out of the 3.

just upseting.  I want to pay for the moive and not just see it for free and not help out show. : (",1287446400,6,790,3.4269662921348316
