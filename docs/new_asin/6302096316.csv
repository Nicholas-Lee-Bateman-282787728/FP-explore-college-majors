424241,3,6302096316,"This is a Tom Stoppard adaptation of a John Le Carr Book, but apart from the fact that it is a spy drama, this is a complete contrast from Le Carr's most famous work, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. It's somehow less cynical, and more positive. Although Sean Connery's character Barley is a reluctant spy, you feel that if this were Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, he would have been killed for 'knowing too much' instead, the security services are quite civil to him, the worst he gets from them is raised eyebrows when he attempts independent operation. The story, set in the time of Glasnost makes some serious points which are a bit dated now, but were at the time an important change in the way in which spy dramas were written. The photography is marvellous and being filmed almost entirely on location, the vistas of Moscow and Lenningrad are like one long tourist advertisement. Jerry Goldsmith's usually excellent music is let down here by being too intrusive, almost as though the film's producers couldn't bear to leave any part of the soundtrack unfilled. By contrast, the clarinet playing of Branford Marsalis is appropriate and sublime, even if Connery hasn't quite got the hang of miming the thing! Sean Connery himself, as with all the players turn in strong performances, although it's a little unrealistic that someone 28 years younger than he would fall in love with him (I bet the ages were closer in the book!) especially as his make-up and wig aren't as 'young' as they usually are.",1005782400,4,1494,4.772200772200772
424242,4,6302096316,"Although I have not seen the DVD (it hasn't been released yet) I have watched the VHS version at least 40 times.  A spy movie set during the Cold War, The Russia House stars Sean Connery and Michelle Pfeiffer.  Connery is a British publisher, Barley Scott Blair, who is sent manuscripts by a Russian woman named Katya (Pfeiffer).  However, the manuscripts are intercepted by British intelligence and are analysis of the Soveit Empire's nuclear capabilities.  Blaire is convinced to play the role of spy for the British, and he must befirend Katya in order find the author of the manuscripts (the mysterious Dante.)  As the story unfolds, Blaire and Katya grow closer to each other, and Blair soon finds himself trapped between the loyalties he has to his mother country and to Katya.
  This is an extremely terrific movie, but is also very confusing.  I had to watch it 7 times before the plot really made sense to me, but once I understood what was going on, it was a joy to watch it over and over again.  This is not one of Connery's most famous works, but it is certainly one of his best.  Reprising his role as spy, Connery does a much better job of it than as James Bond.  Michelle Pfeiffer is similary convincing as Katya, who is caught in between the politics of Russia and Britan.
  I whole heartedly recommend this movie, but I do caution anyone who has not seen it before to rent it first.  A DVD version is long overdue and still the features the DVD will have are only subtitles and widescreen, which is perfect for some of the beautiful landscape scenes in Russia.",1003017600,12,1577,4.546099290780142
424243,5,6302096316,"When the rusty Iron Curtain disintegrated during Gorbachev's glasnost, Hollywood filmmakers finally got access to the image-rich expanse of Mother Russia for location shoots. Whereas before, when scenes of ""Moscow"" or ""Leningrad"" were actually filmed in, say, Helsinki, now American theatergoers can gaze upon the real thing. On viewing THE RUSSIA HOUSE for the first time, I was thrilled to see the onion domes and other architectural glories of Moscow and Suzdal, which I had seen in person several years before.
Sean Connery and Michelle Pfeiffer are Barley and Katya in the screen adaptation of John le Carr&eacute;'s novel of the same title. Barney is the world-weary  and alcoholic London publisher to whom a book manuscript is smuggled by the Russian Katya, a woman Barley claims most emphatically not to know. Since the document is actually a survey of the status of Soviet defense weaponry, the British Secret Service, which intercepted the manuscript, views Barley's disclaimer as tepid at best. After intense questioning, and a call upon his loyalty to Queen and Empire, Barley is persuaded to return to Moscow to meet Katya, and determine her source of  information. The latter turns out to be Dante, a well-respected physicist embedded in the Soviet defense establishment, who is known to British intelligence and is also Katya's boyfriend. Finally realizing the identity and potential value of the contact, MI6 approaches the CIA with a proposal for a continuing joint operation using Barley as the field agent. The moneyed Americans, of course, insist on playing the dominant mission controller, relegating the Brits to the role of interested observer.
A criticism of this film was that it's too boring. Not so, if one accepts and understands that le Carr&eacute;'s plots are not action oriented by design. Rather, they revolve around character evolution and relatively subtle confrontations that are more intellectual and psychological than physical. Le Carr&eacute;'s books are, admittedly, an acquired taste, and not for the shallow-minded. The filmed version of THE RUSSIA HOUSE is true to its literary roots. There are here no feats of 007-like derring-do confounding the evildoers on missions impossible. The storyline unfolds at a comparatively sedate, realistic pace.
The casting was perfect. Veterans Connery and Pfeiffer are magnificent together. The latter's portrayal of a Slavic damsel-in-distress is especially convincing. James Fox as the urbane, gentlemanly MI6 controller serves as the perfect foil to the abrasive, take-no-prisoners (stereotypically Yank) attitude of his CIA counterpart, played by Roy Scheider. Klaus Brandauer as Dante is appropriately enigmatic. The location cinematography is visually sumptuous.
After awhile, one gets weary of the steady diet of action spy thrillers that rampage across the silver screen. As a change of gait, THE RUSSIA HOUSE is supremely satisfying, especially the bittersweet ending. I loved it.",982195200,52,2970,5.4825327510917035
424244,5,6302096316,"One of my favorites. Very romantic story, both in terms of its love story and its humanity. Sean Connery rises to the challenge of being a ""decent human being"" after much showy bravado. Wonderful soundtrack. Beautifully shot on location in Moscow. Come on and dream!",978652800,2,266,4.933333333333334
424245,3,6302096316,"""Crowds are good, if you're moving. Open spaces are good. Talk in the street, if you have to. Never talk in a car or a hotel room, except for the benefit of their microphones"" says the British agent Ned (James Fox) to Barley Blair(Sean Connery), a somewhat reluctant participant in the supposedly anesthetized espionage scene circa Glasnost. Blair is a civilian, a publisher in love with Russia and its writers. He had joined them in what is affectionately named the ""writer's village"" somewhere in this excitingly open Russia, where he and this select group of boozy intellectuals had discussed saving the world between lunch and dinner. His idealism was noted. An intermediary, Katya (Michelle Pfieffer) sends him a book, authored by a man known as Dante (as in Dante's Inferno) that relegates the Soviet Nuclear threat, and consequently the arms race with the United States to the toilet. British Intelligence get hold of the book before Blare does. And so begins another complex chapter in John Le Carre's quest to eliminate the mythic nobility of espionage, and magnify those who are caught in the crossfire.
Dante, played superbly by German actor Klaus Maria Brandauer, must have read quite a few of Le Carre's novels, he doesn't trust Western intelligence or intelligence people at all for that matter. To him, they are all ""gray men"" and in a moving scene, he recounts how gray men, never to be heard from again apprehended and killed his father. He knows that Blair will be working for British Intelligence, but he will deal only with a civilian, a ""Joe agent"". Meanwhile, Katya, extremely beautiful in a haggard Russian sort of way develops a liking to the rusty charmer Blair. Katya had been Dante's lover back in their student days. And a quietly touching love triangle develops as a counterpoint to the all the arcane goings on.
The Russia House comes with an exceptional filmmaking pedigree. The schizophrenic director Fred Schepisi was on his talented side coming off the powerful A Cry in the Dark. He furnishes Le Carre's distinctive world with the pre-requisite amount of oak lined rooms, sedate men smoking, talking, drinking hard liquor in ice filled high-quality glassware, while the scent of betrayal hovers. The script by English playwright Tom Stoppard wisely avoids suffocating the film with unsolicited suspense scenes to makes the film more commercial or accessible. This is a talky, demanding, plot heavy film. The whole thing is laced with a memorable, jazzy Jerry Goldsmith score that perfectly underscores the photogenic Lisbon, Leningrad and Moscow (where most of the film is set.)
Several stellar performances are to be found among the supporting cast. Namely Roy Schieder (himself a veteran of such spy films as Marathon Man) as the foul mouthed CIA attach, who in some scenes is called upon to explain the labyrinthine plot. On the British side, in genius bit of casting, director Ken Russell plays Walter, the eccentric, cynical ""character"", who seems disgusted to have to explain the mechanics and the subtleties to all those cold war rookies. These characters more then makes up for the absence of Smiley, who Le Carre veterans would remember as the looming figure whose sinister fingerprints are mostly felt in his absence.
The film's problems are more central. As Blair, Connery gives what is easily one his best performances. But he is still Sean Connery, sometimes shaken, never stirred. He is supposed to be equal parts charmer and a washout, but when he describes himself as a ""walking unmade bed"", you can't help but smile. This being Le Carre territory, you shouldn't. The performance pales in comparison to Richard Burton's haunting Alec Leamus in Martin Ritt's incomparable 1965 masterpiece The Spy Who Came In From The Cold. I couldn't help but think that an actor like Albert Finney would have brought much needed pathos to the part. The pathos, or lack thereof is part of the film's larger problem. For all what is at stake in the end, The Russia House doesn't have that palpable sense of doom that permeated the 1965 film. The enemy here are those who would still profit from the cold war. They are fought in elegant offices on the Western side of things, not grim debriefing rooms behind the iron curtain. This probably makes the film more relevant. It also makes for far less compelling drama.",978393600,7,4347,4.964334705075446
424246,4,6302096316,"Like the other movies originating from the unchallenged master of the intelligent spy thriller John LeCarre, this one is a really a sophisticated thriller exposing the hidden, complicated, and conflicted corners of an  individual's human heart. ""The Russia House"" represented a formidable new  challenge for LeCarre, so suddenly deprived of the spy-thriller heaven of  the cold war he had built his career describing. But here he has mined  fresh new tunnels of insight into the cunning, deceit, and betrayal that is  the stuff of real-life espionage. At the same time, this movie also weaves  a quite memorable love story in the spaces squeezed between the two sides.
Barley Blair (Sean Connery), the failing boozehound scion of a  collapsing British publishing house with a love for everything Russian,  happens by drunken though eloquent happenstance to inspire a famous Soviet  scientist into attempting to sneak his manuscript detailing the real sorry  state of Russian ICBM capabilities into the hands of the West in order to  foster a recognition of the folly of the arms race and to end what he calls  ""the great lie"". The scientist attempts to contact Blair, but through a  series of mishaps rivaling the deeds of the keystone cops winds up landing  the manuscript in the hands of the British Secret Service. So they soon  want Barley to intercede with the Russian contact point (Michelle Pfeiffer)  to find out who the author of the manuscript is and thus determine its  authenticity. So Barley pursues the beautiful but conflicted contact, an  idealistic angel of mercy who soon sparks Barley's love interest and  paternal concern. The game is afoot.
The movie is gorgeously  photographed on a number of locations throughout Russia, and the  travelogue-like tour through Moscow, Saint Petersburg, and Minsk is  spellbinding. Likewise, the acting is top notch, with Roy Scheider, James  Fox, and a whole welter of distinguished British actors lending presence  and gravity to this intelligent thriller. As is usual, the plot takes off  slowly but builds to a mind-boggling series of intertwining activities one  has to pay attention to understand. Before long we recognize the familiar  murderous games set into motion with deadly earnest by the Brits, the  Americans, and the Russians, none of whom give a rattler's damn about  Barley, the contact, or the scientist.
This is a stunning, suspenseful,  and somewhat rueful tale of what unfolds when we discover that there is a  real possibility that the so-called Soviet ICBM threat is a sham, that the  missiles cannot escape their silos, that their ability to achieve  trajectory or destroy targets with any accuracy is vastly over-rated. And  as one can expect from LeCarre's shadowy and complex geopolitical world of  espionage and power, there are no simple answers or easy foregone  conclusions. This is a wonderful movie, which in my opinion is quite  under-rated. It has the ring of more real-life veracity and worldly wisdom  than one can easily find on the non-fiction side of the movie theater  aisle. Enjoy!",963014400,43,3078,5.141414141414141

424317,4,6302096316,"Whenever I finish a JLC novel, I race to watch the film adaptation. His books are often adapted with some degree of success to the big screen or a BBC series. To this day, these adaptations have a great cast with big box office names, The fact that someone is able to translate these intricate mazes into a coherent story with fair characterization always amazes me. I don't know how can someone agrees to try, much less deliver. (I wonder if someone will ever try The Honorable Schoolboy).

I wasn't too hopeful on Connery, but he brought Blair to life. I bought his chemistry with Michelle Pfeiffer. The whole cast is quite proficient. Ken Russell as Walter is a treat. Klaus Maria Brandauer is closely associated with the 80s. Actually, in a certain way Russia House is the last chapter of the 80s. In one or two years, the whole world would change. Including Connery, Pfeiffer and Brandauer or Blair, Katya and Goethe/Dante. This is a triangle from the end of an era. The photography in Moscow and Leningrad adds to the aura.

424435,5,6302096316,"Cold war romantic drama. Sean Connery plays British publisher Barley Blair, a Russia expert, who purely by coincidence stumbles upon a Russian nuclear physicist (Claus Maria Brandauer) in a writers dacha. The two men strikes up a conversation about love of ones country and the willingness to betray it. Now Blair is mearly running his mouth, but the Russian scientist is deadly serious and asks his former lover Katya (Michelle Pfeiffer), a Russian bookeditor to assist him in contacting Blair and ask Blair to publish a manuscript, written by the scientist. A manuscript so inflammatory, it might destroy the delicate balance between east and west.

Unfortunately the manuscript is intercepted by British intelligence, who immediately ropes in Blair to help them keep the pots cooking as it were. This is where Blair meets Katya and is madly infatuated. And when the Russians discover the operation, kill the scientist and threaten the lives of Katya and her family, thats where Blair decides to betray England just as the scientist before had betrayed Russia.

The movie - directed by Fred Schepisi - is a tour de force of emotional highs and lows, twists and turns and plots within plots, littered with excellent acting performances by a star studded cast numbering such wonderfull actors like Roy Scheider, James Fox, John Mahoney and J.

For either of these reasons, neither of which do I recall seeing on the product description, Amazon shouldn't have been carrying the product for US distribution (or my Region, which is CO, although again that just seems silly).

It's a very good movie--excellent direction photography and not to mention superb acting of each characters. Of course, for newer generation who did not have the opportunity (?) to feel the heat of cold war around them may miss the point. But if you are purists about spygames, and find James Bond a bit too dramatic, you will be able to enjoy the show. There is a silent tragedy at the end, hushed around the noise of few happy laughter, and that kind of tragedy was not uncommon behind the iron curtain. Yes, if you are picky, you can always point out whole lot of issues about the movie that could be better. But I think that's unnecessary. As an ordinary audience, it will hard not to like it.

424712,2,6302096316,"The Russia House (Fred Schepisi, 1990, 122')

American spy drama, written by Tom Stoppard based on the novel of the same name by John le Carr. It stars Sean Connery and Michelle Pfeiffer, with Roy Scheider, James Fox, John Mahoney, and Klaus Maria Brandauer in supporting roles. Music by Jerry Goldsmith, cinematography by Ian Baker, editing by Beth Jochem Besterveld and Peter Honess. Shot on location in the Soviet Union, only the second American motion picture to do so before the dissolution of the USSR; final scenes filmed in Lisbon.

Essentially a love story between Bartholomew ""Barley"" Scott Blair (Connery), the head of a British publishing firm, and a beautiful Russian woman named Katya Orlova (Pfeiffer). It starts with a business trip to Moscow; it ends when Barley eventually returns to his flat in Lisbon, where he waits for a ship to dock that brings Katya and her family to begin a new life with him. In between is a secret service story about the Soviet Union's true nuclear missile capabilities, with KGB, CIA, MI6 and the works.

Sean Connery was praised for his portrayal of Barley, ""bluff, incorrigible, jazz-loving... his finest performance in ages."" Michelle Pfeiffer also garnered critical plaudits for delivering ""the film's most persuasive performance... Miss Pfeiffer, sporting a credible Russian accent, brings to it a no-nonsense urgency that is missing from the rest of the movie,"" according to the New York Times. Well, you may ask, is that all? What about the movie as a whole?

Roger Ebert, in the Chicago Sun-Times: ""What's good are the few emotional moments that break out of the weary spy formula: Connery declaring his love for Pfeiffer, or the British and Americans getting on each other's nerves. But these flashes of energy are isolated inside a screenplay that is static and boring, that drones on lifelessly through the le Carr universe, like some kind of space probe that continues to send back random information long after its mission has been accomplished.""

Tom Stoppard, and here I disagree, does not normally write boring screenplays; in reality, he is one of the best modern playwrights, the level of Harold Pinter, also both for the stage and for film. The boredom comes from the original, a worn out story which, as many BBC le Carr filmings have shown, do not gain in attractiveness by being put from book to film.

I knew that he had written `The Constant Gardener', which was a beautiful film, but he also wrote `Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy', which was ravishingly intense and absorbing from start to finish.  Now, as a film, `The Russia House' doesn't fare as well, considering that it suffers from what appears to have been a flawed adaptation, but in concept it is spectacular.

The film suffers in trying to piece together the intensity of the `espionage' aspect of the story with the romantic angle thrust in our faces.  It doesn't mesh well and comes across cheapened in tone.  The performances are all good, especially Michelle Pfeiffer, who dons an authentic accent and carries herself with confidence and naturalness.  The cinematography is beautiful and intricate, but the film cannot rise up from the scripts faults and the ill-advised pacing.

424721,3,6302096316,"***Spoiler Warning***

This film tends to draw cinephiles who appreciate the efforts of actors in a story steeped in dialogue and intent, rather than relying on guns, explosions and martial arts. I include myself in this group. But even for me, this character-driven drama tends to drag in places. Always appreciate a full exploration of the plot and character motivations, but the film's premise is based on such a blatantly ridiculous concept that in-depth analysis can be an overreach, especially given the paper-thin archetypes of the players.

Still, I loved the palpable energy between the leads. Connery and Pfeiffer capture that very, very rare essence of a romantic film - onscreen chemistry.

Most appreciative of Pfeiffer, who truly ""felt"" Russian. Her impressively deep performance, as Katya Orlova, catpured the cautious introvert and desperately hopeful mother; delivering an honest portrayal of a life under Communist rule. Not to take away from Connery, who turned in his usual dependable performance with a tad more zest as 'Barley' Scott Blair, the loquacious drunkard of a book publisher caught between the woman he loves and the heartless intelligence services of the Cold War.

The production on whole was a bit more bread and less entr&eacute;e; too much filler for a film that could have done with a bit of pruning. Also, the plot was convoluted - the 'prize' not clearly defined. I can see how some viewers might get lost.

Then there are the unresolved questions you have to allow a pass in order to enjoy the film. It's probably why I couldn't quite appreciate the movie for what it delivered. Such as:

- Why would the US and Britain let Blair go after his betrayal? If we follow the film's premise that the cardboard cut-out of the CIA was as depicted - the natural progression of the story would've been Langley pressuring Whitehall for a capture and imprisonment.

And truthfully, I would've appreciated the film a great deal more had the last scene been of Barley looking out from a snowed-in prison yard, a slow dissolve to Katya and her family in Portugal, free and poignantly happy.

- And then you have to ask why would the Soviets let Katya and her family go free? Their policy was infamously hardline when it came to an easy exodus of their citizenry. It was called 'The Iron Curtain' for good reason. Not the least of which was avoiding the political timebomb often asked by the western media of former citizens: ""Why did you leave The Worker's Paradise?"".

The sugar cookie of an ending cheapened the production for me.

Overall, a decent film. Worth a rental for a one-time viewing.

424770,5,6302096316,"Many talents are responsible for THE RUSSIA HOUSE being one of the most elegant and sophisticated spy thrillers ever made: John Le Carre, whose novel provides the film's basis; Tom Stoppard, who wrote the intricate, witty screenplay; Ian Baker, whose gorgeous cinematography captures a Glasnost-era Soviet Union in decay;  Jerry Goldsmith with one of his most beautiful scores; and the great Fred Schepisi, a criminally underrated director, whose sure and subtle hand was at the helm of this production.  Then there's the cast--Sean Connery in arguably his finest role; Michelle Pfeiffer, James Fox, Roy Scheider, John Mahoney, Klaus Maria Brandauer.  This is a classic Le Carre tale of a down-and-out, middle-aged man who is given one last redemptive shot at minor heroism.  On one of his frequent trips to his beloved Russia, Barley Blair (Connery), a British publisher, unwittingly inspires a Soviet weapons scientist, ""Dante"" (Brandauer) to betray his country by writing a book filled with his country's military secrets.  But the British intelligence service gets ahold of Dante's manuscript before Blair does.  Blair is faced with a choice--cooperate with British intelligence, or look for a way to keep his promise to Dante.  The story is set against  a climate in which cold war intelligence communities are looking for a new angle to play in the midst of Perestroika. If this were just a politically topical movie, it would have aged very badly (and as in any Le Carre-based enterprise, there's a fair share of cheap laughs at Americans).  But the film remains a deeply moving one nearly 20 years after its release because of the strength of the performances and the beauty of the filmmaking.  This kind of intelligent and stylish thriller simply does not get made any more and it's a shame.  A must-see film.",1264204800,4,1818,5.087542087542087
424771,5,6302096316,"Connery and Pfeiffer and Le Carre; what a movie menage 'a trois! Its smart sophistication must have derived, at least in part from LeCarre being involved in the production.

Shot in Russia (Moscow) and Great Britain, this is one of the most realistic, but not hectically-paced spy adventures ever made. More

It doesn't make you think or demand any more than your getting into the film; it will drawn you in. I've noticed that many of not most European movies are more thoughtful and so, thought- provoking.

424772,3,6302096316,"Ok, here goes:

This movie is a bit of a tough watch, and a tough one to rate. The positives are the acting - Connery, Pfeiffer, Brandenauer, etc all play their parts very well. And the settings were good - Russia looked like what we (American point of view, here) imagine it to be, and the same for Portugal...

I'd like to give it more than 3 stars, just for the above reasons and the fact that I personally liked the theme.

Unfortunately, the plot is tedious a la the LeCarre novels of the Karla trilogy (Tinker Tailor, Smiley's People, etc) written for 1970s pseudo-intellectualism with very little of the action we've come to expect from ""spy thrillers"" such as the Tom Clancey genre. The plot can leave you yawning at times and its easy to get destracted watching it unfold in the first three-quarters of the movie. And once that happens, you've lost the story.

Some specific points:
I mentioned the acting above, but one draw back was the somewhat stereotyped portrayal of the characters (not the actors' fault): the Brits are all understated, ""old boy"" public school establishment types; the Americans are brash, somewhat impatient and with some strong language; the Russians are all intellectual and fatalistic....Way too stereotypical for good character development.

Connery and Pfeiffer seemed a mismatch to me, though both played their roles well. It might have come off better with a perhaps slightly younger actor for Barley (rather than Connery) or an older female actor for Katya (Pfeiffer). I think the latter would have been best.

I'm uncertain as to what the denouement was meant to be: the revelation of Dante's intention with the manuscript he gave the West, or Barley meeting Pfeiffer and her family at the docks in Portugal as they defected?

The music was good, but was played redundantly throughout the film. It needed at least some VARIETY.

Not a bad flick, but its NOT a ""spy movie"". Its a drama. So be prepared to pay close attention; this isn't a casual watch.",1204934400,4,1994,4.809941520467836

Now my grade in film is not important and don't ask what it is. The point is...this is the worse movie ever.  It's as if the director woke up and took out his bottle and said let me think...

424775,5,6302096316,"The movie ""Russia House,"" starring Sean Connery and Michelle Pfeiffer, is based on the spy novel of the same name, by that master spy-meister, the British John LeCarre.  It's a very acute look at Russia, just as their ""Glasnost,"" policy of openness begins to end --but not quite-- the cold war.  The talented British playwright Tom Stoppard adapted the script, largely faithful to the novel. The respected director Fred Schepisi helmed.  Like most of the movies adapted from LeCarre's oeuvre, it reflects his extraordinary abilities with plotting and dialogue.  Though, mind you, the dialogue is quite mannered, as also reflects LeCarre's works, not to mention Stoppard's.

The plot, set in London, Russia, and some other glamorous continental cities, concerns an informant, unknown to the British Secret Service, MI5, who has suddenly popped up, in this period of glasnost, with very valuable, top secret data as to the Russian military's preparedness.  The Secret Service doesn't quite know what to make of it, so they press Scott Barley Blair (Sean Connery), an alcoholic publisher specializing in Russian subjects, into service.  He's to go to Russia (several times, it turns out) to locate this most secret of spies.  Along the way, he meets and falls in love with Michelle Pfeiffer, never better as an actress, nor more beautiful, as a single mother who works in publishing.

The movie shows us quite a lot of snow, and life as it was lived in Russia at the time.  The everyday struggles for the underprivileged, as Pfeiffer's character, despite her glamorous job,is.  Three generations living cramped in a tiny apartment, the queuing for necessities, the difficulty of obtaining new clothes, and, as for shoes, forget it.  The privileges of the privileged: the nice cars, the dachas (the greatly-desired country homes), the designer duds.  It further deals with the usual suspicions between the British and American secret services.  Finally, it gives us an honest, unsensationalized, non-mawkish view of middle-aged love, though it is burdened with a Hollywood happy ending that you won't find in the book.

In this movie, Sir Sean Connery shows us a side of him we don't often see: tenderness.  His sax-playing among Russian friends (voiced by Branford Marsalis), is quite moving. Also on view is that sly Scottish sense of humor Connery spices his movies, and his conversations with: I once interviewed the man, in his trailer on New York's Fifth Avenue, while he was making some film or another: and his humor was so sly, my editor complained that it was a boring article.  Oh well, I guess you had to be there.

As to the rest of the cast, Michelle Pfeiffer does very well, as mentioned above.  Klaus Maria Brandauer also stands out as ""Dante,"" the most unusual secret Russian informant.  There was also some money spent on the supporting cast: Americans J.T. Walsh, Roy Scheider, John Mahoney.  Brits, Ian McNeice, James Fox, Michael Kitchen, David Threlfall.

""Russia House"" was written, and filmed, at the optimum time for its plot, and thereby acquires a resonance it might otherwise not have had.  It was a lucky break for author, filmmakers, and us.",1172966400,10,3167,5.048076923076923

424798,5,6302096316,"The Russia House is one of Sean Connery's last really good performances before he realized that they'd still pay him the big bucks even if he was just sleepwalking through a part and refusing to do more than one take. It's also one of the best screen adaptations of a John Le Carre novel, a surprisingly ambitious screenplay by Tom Stoppard that folds chronology, character and plot points in on themselves like origami in the opening and closing scenes making for engaging and occasionally playful viewing. The excellent supporting cast, including an exceptionally good Michelle Pfeiffer, don't hurt either. Only the last minute studio-imposed happy ending grates, but not enough to do any real damage. Jerry Goldsmith provides a fine score, the love theme proving third time lucky after it was dropped from both Wall Street and Alien Nation.",1166140800,,843,5.071942446043166

The only thing I wasn't amazed is Katia, her russian phrases were with a very bad foreign accent so that she did not seem Russian at all. I think this has brought down the value a bit, otherwise the story seemed original and sceenes were great.

It is certainly not a standard 007 movie, this is far more historical and far less with special effects. In other words 007 movies are pure fiction, this one could have been 100% realistic. Scenery is great.

424803,5,6302096316,"Russia House is British playwright Tom Stoppard's effort to bring John LeCarre's book to the screen. Sean Connery owed Stoppard a favor and agreed to act in the lead role of an out-at-elbows publisher whose plays jazz clarinet and is equally talented on the whisky bottle. LeCarre likes to confront mildly despondent middle-aged men of middling talent with a challenge that might allow them to be small heroes. LeCarre's mini-supermen were interesting in his first dozen novels but American readers have grown heartily sick of the theme and many left Russia house collecting dust in the annual pile of unwanted Christmas gifts. Imagine the surprise of discovering that a movie based on an unreadable book turns out to be a masterpiece.

Director Fred Schepisi filmed Russia House in Moscow and Leningrad in the midst of Glasnot. The movie begins at a Russian book fair where a Moscow book agent Katia (played by Michelle Pfeiffer) comes to deliver a secret manuscript to ""Boozy"" Barley Blair (Sean Connery). His book stand is empty, he is absent. The manuscript makes its way into the hands of British Intelligence and turns out to be a technical treatise showing that the Soviet Union cannot ""make solid (rocket) fuel worth s**t,"" its rockets ""suck instead of blow,"" and they ""could not hit Nevada on a clear day."" Through a series a virtuoso flashbacks, fast-forwards and voice overs we learn that Blair loves Russia and Russians and that during one of his drunken rants at a retreat for Soviet writers he has inspired Russia's top rocket scientist to betray his country because as Blair has expounded in his cups ""if we are to survive we must all betray our countries.""

The plot of Russia House is too complex to describe in a few lines but the theme is simple. A country's system can be bad, but its people good. America and the Soviet Union are in the grips of weapons makers and generals who amplify their power by blowing up the threat each country poses the other. To tear down the lie that the cold war is the only peace possible between Soviets and Americans, Blair and his rocket scientist must disobey their superiors and turn coat, much as soldiers of the First World War did when they crossed no-man's land to shake hands. Stoppard somehow manages to get the message of Russia House across without stunning us with platitudes about geopolitics and even manages to squeeze in a love story that comes across as mature and moving.

This movie is to Sean Connery what Glenn Gary Glenn Ross was to Alec Baldwin. The script of Glenn Gary put an epic speech into Baldwin's mouth as the hectoring slave driver of pathetic real estate agents and showed the world that Baldwin could act. Connery has never been better than in Russia House nor has he worked with such an expert cast. Roy Scheider, Ken Russel, Michelle Pfeiffer, James Fox, Klaus Maria Brandauer, as well as the regular batch of talented British no-names give this movie the sort of punch that has not been seen since 12 Angry Men and Inherit the Wind.

Russia House is not for everyone. You will see no shootouts, no exposed breasts, no chases down busy streets. If you want a glimpse of the Soviet Union before its fall, brought to life by a crack troupe of actors at the top of their game then you need to see this movie. Again, and again.",1108771200,21,3312,4.695352839931153

 Another Sean Connery spy movie, which he always does well. Playing a publisher, Bartholomew 'Barley' Scott Blair, when a Russian woman named Katya (Michelle Pfeiffer) sends him a letter and notebooks of someone using the name Dante, containing a manuscript which details weaknesses in the USSR's nuclear capability. British intelligence intercepts the material and opens his private mail, eventually persuading him to act as a spy in their behalf and go to Russia in search of the mysterious Dante, and verify the statements in the manuscript. That's the gist of the plot.

 As usual, the intelligence officers for 'our' side are depicted as bad guys--at least equally as bad as the Russians, and it becomes a choice for Blair between Katya, whom he has come to care for, and his country. That is the basic conflict.

 Like every Connery movie, this is a good one, if somewhat confusing at times. It would have benefitted from better direction, but I liked it. Connery's distinctive voice and lisp (or ith that lithp) identify him even when you are outside the room. I always enjoy his acting. He's one of the really great ones, in my opinion.

 I think you'll like this film.

424805,3,6302096316,"You truly cannot go wrong with a combination like Connery (who is instantly likeable) and Pfeifer (who is stunningly moving in her role as a working Russian mother of two). But despite what could have been a pretty gripping theme with unpredictable twists, this just ends up being a directorial mess. Another reviewer suggested that this ought to be viewed as a spy drama not a spy thriller. To me, that sounds like a poor excuse for story telling gone astray.
Blair (Sean Connery) is a British publisher with a clear affinity for Russia, and has received a manuscript from Pfeifer's character, Katya, which he believes contains Soviet military secrets. The British intelligence SOMEHOW gets to know of this (will we ever know how and when) and Blair gets reluctantly involved in a plot to find out more about Katya and her associations. We are sort of made to feel on whose side Blair is on, and who the ""bad guys"" are (clue: CIA and the Queen's men of course) but my problem with the movie is it never really quite grabs you by the collar and drag you into the theme, or at least give the impression that anything terribly important is at stake.
It starts, goes on and on with some guys doodling in a very CIA like fashion amidst some glorious shots of Moscow, and suddenly everything comes to an end with the bad guys left in the dust by a very cleverly hatched scheme by Blair and Katya -- so sinister a scheme indeed than even the audience is left bewildered. Yeah.
While the movie sports some clever, even funny, moments, overall the narrative is boggling and wanders from concept to concept. Some directorial coherence for the audience would have been great. If the combination of Connery and Pfeifer intrigues you, especially a Russian accented Pfeifer, this may be worth a watch.

Viewing it brings back vivid memories of my visit there, the colleagues I met, and the persistent sense I had of one tremendous chapter of history having just closed, and the next but dimly apprehended.
