A nice and different DVD from this great band. I usually don't care about unpluggeds  because I feel the energy dilutes bigtime, esp in the case of heavy music as is the case with Godsmack. A Yes unplugged ? Bring it on ! A Godsmack unplugged ? Huhmmm...not sure about it, so I borrowed this from a friend and it certainly dispelled my negative expectations. Most of the songs did lend themselves to acoustic versions, esp those with percussion in them. Sully's voice never sounded better; he restrained his potent register without compromising the energy and the guitarrists did the same amazing job  on their axes.

There are a couple of breaks during the set on which some presenter hands a mike to members of the audience for them to make Sully some of the silliest questions in the history of rock music. They really should have left that part out, but at a meagre 64' I guess they couldn't afford to. My guess is not the whole set was DVD-apt so the filler came in handy.

Picture: The highlight of the DVD. It is not only amazingly old-school filmed, with a cool, slow paced editing letting you watch all of the action in great detail but the VBR pic bitrate grazes the maximum available for standard def (10Mbps) at 9.7. Pic is CRYSTAL. A nice but simple, attractively-designed menu is on par with the rest of the package.

Sound : The overall sound, presented in AC3 Dolby Digital is excellent both in stereo and 5.1, with GREAT detail and incredible spatial location of every instrument.

Cons : The rhythmic section never realized they were playing an acoustic set. The drummer pounds away at the skins as if he is playing electric at a big arena, with conventional sticks he doesn't even bother to reverse. Rackets ?! Is this tennis ?!

As a bassist myself, I know not everyone is hot about playing an akward, faint-sounding acoustic bass guitar(which is the case with most of those contraptions). But this guy makes his electric Ibanez gurgle at full volume over the mix and if my ears are right, his active eq is in PHAT position to make matters worse. Nothing wrong with playing electric as long as you remember to mellow down to suit the general tone of the gig instead of trying to bury everyone else in the mix. I turned down my sub but it just paliated the problem; the mix is FAT. It won't ruin your experience, but it did make me knock a star from an otherwise perfect score.

If you, like me, are already a fan, you will enjoy this product. If you're not, you are not likely to turn into one, so I recommend a regular electric DVD first.

Enjoyable - buyable - nice adittion to your collection, yes, yes and yes.",1327968000,3,2694,4.502049180327869
