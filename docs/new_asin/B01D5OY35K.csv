8755050,5,B01D5OY35K,"This wonderful BluRay of the opera that Rossini composed right after Il Barbiere di Siviglia is a mandatory acquisition for the advanced Rossini collector.  It can also be heartily recommended for those who love the whirlwind of sonic madness that epitomizes the Rossini style.  It is the only comedy that Rossini wrote, or rather cobbled together, for Naples as the music was not all entirely new.  As such it incorporates bits of Il Turco in Italia, La Pietra del Paragone, Torvaldo e Dorliska, and even a snippet from Barbiere.  Interestingly, the overture which was newly composed was re-employed in  La Cenerentola the following year.  However, Rossini  being the master of recycling (an attribute he shared with Bach and Handel) it all works to perfection.

The plot is really a bit of nonsensical fluff about a prototypical nouveau riche father who advertises his daughter for marriage in a Parisian newspaper (La Gazzetta) and turns the hotel where they are staying into total bedlam. As such it is the perfect vehicle for Rossini at his most comical. The action is updated so that the paper is available in both print in an online version.  A nice touch indeed!

This is not the first time that the opera has been recorded or has appeared on video, but it is the first time that the piece is given in its entirety and with all the set pieces being authentic Rossini.  As such there are two small excisions and one major addition.  The excisions are two spurious arias by an unknown composer that were added to the score to expand the roles of Madame La Rosa and Doralice. The major addition is the recent discovery of a large scale quintet in the first act.  In the past there was always a bleeding hole in the center of the act.  On an earlier DVD from the Rossini Opera Festival the gap is filled with some recitative like chatter that seems foreign and out of place.  A more recent Naxos recording attempts to fill the gap more satisfactorily by fitting the words to music culled from other Rossini operas.  Here we finally have Rossini's original as authenticated by Philip Gossett and I cannot over emphasize the excellence of this piece.  As such it is what makes the acquisition of this set mandatory for the Rossini collector.  What is interesting about this ensemble is that in the final section Rossini uses the melody at the words ""Mi par d'esser con la testa"" from the first act finale of Barbiere.  However, he develops and expands it quite differently.

The singing is uniformly excellent.  The soprano is Cinzia Forte who also appears in the above mentioned Rossini Opera Festival production.  While she is not as fluent as in the past, she is still excellent and  has modified some of her embellishments for the better. That she is quite attractive and acts well is not a hindrance.  In fact the entire cast not only sings and acts well, but they look as if they are totally enjoying themselves and that only adds to the hilarity and pleasure of it all.  One of the roles is that of a mime and he almost steals the show!  The production is colorful and attractive, the chorus and orchestra perform well, and the conducting is spot on.

So while not mandatory for the average collector it would still prove to be a wise acquisition for those days when you might need a bit of a pick me up.  Yes, if Lucy, Ricky, Fred, and Ethyl checked into the hotel where the action occurs they would hardly seem out of place!

Picture and sound are of a high quality as well. Highly recommended.",1469232000,6,3505,4.635332252836305
