3724468,5,B001NY4X0U,"This is now my 2nd copy of season 3. I was tired of my other DVD of this same season because in 301 Fairy Tale Endings, the part at the end when Kerry and Kris are in the hospital and Kris asks him, shoving him onto the bed, ""Where's the money?"" for one split second the DVD makes a skipping/scratched noise. So I ordered a new copy. Same exact thing. I tried both of my Season 3 DVDS and the same exact effect so I'm thinking that it isn't my DVDs at all but the episode transfer onto DVD.

SEASON 1
Disc #1 from Season 1 arrived scratched and with fingerprints. The disc would not play uninterrupted. The scratches caused skipping.

There was an orange circular sticker on the back of the case, but beneath the shrink wrap.

SEASON 2
Two case hubs were broken. The discs were loose during shipping. And were scratched.

SEASON 3 (The Item to which this review is attached)
One case hub was broken. And one disc was scratched.

The quality control for the discs for all three seasons was very poor. I returned all three seasons.

It is unfortunate. I enjoy the series and wanted to be able to watch the commentaries and extras that can only be found on the DVD format.",1381622400,3,1263,6.962025316455696

3724684,3,B001NY4X0U,"I've found myself surprisingly impressed with ABC Family shows so when I saw that this entire show was up on Hulu, I naturally decided to try it. I also have a bit of a dislike for horse shows (thanks to a few particularly bad incidences, such as Misty of Chincoteague) so I was a little doubtful. This show did a good job of removing my dislike.

Wildfire follows a girl who was in a correctional facility and is given a second chance when a horse racing family takes her in as a stable hand. Eventually, she becomes part of the family and becomes a jockey.

There are some things about this show that I particularly like:

-The time the show spent on Kris's family in particular was very strong. we come to understand how she might have ended up in the juvenile detention center and why she might make bad decisions in her life.
-Her issues when it came to trust in herself and others was particularly clear and understandable. After making so many bad decisions for herself and being hurt by so many people, it is only natural that she would be hesitant to trust even when people seem to have only ever helped her.
-There was an interesting competitive/friendly dynamic happening between the Davis and Ritter farms. On the one hand the Davis family would stop at no cost to become the dominant stable. On the other, the Davis children could not help but become entangled with the Ritter family. This push and pull between family and friend/love loyalty added stakes to every aspect of the show because to win in on area meant losing in another.

There were some things I did not like:

-Kris's relationship with Junior felt forced in the beginning and rushed in the end. It seemed strange that she would fall for him, that he would change personalities so quickly, and that their wedding would happen so fast. It almost makes me wonder if they were likely to succeed long-term.
-There was so much more potential in Kris's backstory than what we got. We could have used more about Kris's family-seeing her mother a second time, maybe learning about her father. I would have liked to see her go home at some point (not permanently, just to confront her past head on).

Ultimately, I enjoyed this show. It isn't ABC Family's best, but it is a step in the direction that the network has taken recently to become more current and popular.",1308614400,6,2336,4.563245823389021

3724687,5,B001NY4X0U,"I came across this series one weekend when i was bored. It was on Netflix so i decided to give it a try. I watched all 4 seasons in that weekend! It's an awesome story of a girl (Kris) who just got out of a correctional facility and is offered a job on Raintree Ranch. There she rescues a horse named Wildfire and they share a bond that can't be broken. There is drama, comedy, and tear jerker moments. I was so sad that there weren't more than 4 seasons of this show. I would definitely recommend everyone give this show a shot!",1298851200,,529,4.145631067961165
3724688,4,B001NY4X0U,"The first twelve episodes of this season were the best ones ever! Matt and Kris FINALLY got to be together, at least for a while, Danni finally had a romance that didn't annoy the crap out of me, in fact she and RJ are one of my favorite couples (and then RJ dies...so sad), and it was fun to watch the romance develop between Junior and Jillian. I also like how Kris really becomes part of the Ritter family, and as much as I miss Henry, Jesse is a really cool guy. The last episode...I HATED. I can't remember whether or not it was the episode where J&J kiss, which would be the only good thing that happened if it did, but I do remember that it's the episode where Jean and Pablo completely turn their backs on Kris and she had to break up with Matt. That was so wrong. How could the Ritters tell Kris that she was one of them and then kick her out just because she goes too far trying to help them? Also hate that Todd disappears after the last episode. He was so cute.",1297555200,,973,4.099476439790576

3724690,5,B001NY4X0U,"*SPOILER ALERT*

I absoulty loved season 3! I loved the bull riding with Junior and RJ, and I loved the romance with RJ and Dani. (Spoile alert) I also hated the fact that they killed off RJ. They should have kept him on and become a regular. Speaking of becoming a regular, I also need to mention Junior/Gillian and one of my all time favorite characters, Shiek Omar O'Hattan (otherwise known as 'O').

They also should of kept the Junior/Gillian romance. I absoulty adored thier dance and long-lunches at Bobby's in 'The Good-Bye'; I also loved how they went for a run and how good they looked together at 'O's party in 'Picking Sides'.

Now on to my all time favorite recurring character, Shiek Omar O'Hattan. I loved him. I always watch 'So Long Pardor' just to see how a big part he played in the illegal matchrace (which he did since it was HIS idea after all), and I was SO disappointed that he and his 'investors' didn't get in trouble for the matchrace, and I was even MORE disappointed that he didn't come back for season 4.

Bottom line, if you like this series, you will either like or LOVE (like I did) Season 3. Even though it ended 2 years ago, I still watch this season all the time!",1288828800,4,1199,4.387387387387387

A  heartwarming story of a girl that had strayed from the straight and narrow, taken in by a racing family.

The trials and tribulations that a young girl like this must endure, due to the deviousness of others, and it seems to never end.

3724733,5,B001NY4X0U,"This show is one of the best shows I have personally seen and would certainly recommend it to anyone who wants teen drama in a different kind of setting. Although I said teens, anyone could watch this show and find something to enjoy due to the many on-going storylines with the horse racing and competing ranches. I eagerly wait for season four to come to dvd, which unfortunately ended up being the last season. It's a shame but all good things must end and the series finale for this show was really great and closed the series on a high note.

I hope more people discover this show over time and it doesn't fade from existance like many other shows unfortunately have.",1238803200,,672,4.508196721311475
