8007976,3,B00018U920,"The hunt for the super-twister twisted my mind, so I stopped watching it after just 10 minutes. Just so you know. Three stars?",1375833600,,126,4.521739130434782
8007977,4,B00018U920,"I ordered this because of the recent tornado in Moore Oklahoma.  What I found disturbingly coincidental was that what happened in 2013 was identical to what happened there in 1999.  A terrible disastrous people killing tornado struck Moore, Oklahoma in 1999 and what happened there eerily repeated itself in 2013.  I ordered this for my class so they could get an understanding of what happened to Moore, Oklahoma in 2013 and the coverage and analysis seemed remarkably similar to what I saw on the news in 2013.  A great way to understand how devastating tornadoes can be to that part of the country.",1370131200,2,601,4.805825242718447
8007978,5,B00018U920,"Watched this on PBS a while back - and so impressed at the science involved in trying to make our lives safer no matter where we live, as these monsters can drop 'outta the sky' anytime-anywhere in past 20 yrs.",1340236800,,210,4.275
8007979,5,B00018U920,"This is the definitive program, so far, on a very timely subject. There are too many tornado programs with ""bad science"", misinformation, and ""dumbing-down"" this subject. This program does an excellent job on covering the basics and also shows cutting edge research. As a resident in the heart of ""Tornado Alley"", I can highly recommend this product.",1237766400,8,350,5.157894736842105
