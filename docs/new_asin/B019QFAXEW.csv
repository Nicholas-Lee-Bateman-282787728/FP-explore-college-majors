8745809,5,B019QFAXEW,"I watched every episode of ""Open All Hours"" and hoped that this continuation would be as good.  It is.  Granville has learned Arkwright's avarice, but he still longs to be with Mavis.  Arkwright lives on by haunting the till.  If you like Brit Coms, you will like this certainly.",1524355200,,279,4.63265306122449

8745814,5,B019QFAXEW,"One of the best British comedy's ever, the return of David Jason to reprise his role from the original series and take over his uncles store was great, i just wish they would have made more episodes.",1506816000,,199,4.405405405405405
8745815,5,B019QFAXEW,"This series doesn't disappoint.  David Jason is a favorite and carries this series as the main character.  In the
original series, Open All Hours, he played the son and now has moved on to the father's role.  It is a typical
English comedy and the supporting cast, some of whom were in the original series, are wonderful.  It is a funny,
and full of hi-jinks and I would recommend it for everyone that likes English humor.",1505692800,,422,4.5131578947368425
8745816,5,B019QFAXEW,"This just feeds my old addiction to Open All Hours. They dynamic has changed a little, but it had to with Arkwright gone now. Still, you cannot get any better than David Jason, no matter what he does. The returning characters are a bit older but it only serves to make them funnier and wittier. The new characters lend a whole new face to the show.....just like they would to any neighborhood. Love this series and the seller was great. The DVD came quickly, was packaged well, and is of the best quality. Just make sure you have the right DVD player or you will be disappointed!",1501891200,2,579,4.420560747663552
8745817,5,B019QFAXEW,"Love Open All Hours and Still Open
All Hours. I own the whole set of each series.. Everything arrived on time and in good condition. Love the UK and their comedy. Also own Fawlty Towers, Are You Being Served, Keeping Up Appearances, and Last of the Summer Wine. Also First  of the Summer Wine. The Vicar of Dibley and waiting for God.",1492732800,2,334,4.387096774193548
