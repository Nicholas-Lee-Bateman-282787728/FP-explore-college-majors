8116882,5,B000F3T5AS,"I am new to Polymer Clay, but I had heard some wonderful things about this clay artist.  This DVD is very well done.  Lisa goes slow and gives complete details about her amazing examples.  You will learn from the very beginning all the way to the end of these completed projects.  She really makes it look so simple.  Also, at the end you will find all her sources for suppliers.  Her own personal line of ""Lisa Pavelka"" products are very nice; I have purchased several of her texture stamps.

You won't go wrong purchasing this DVD.

This video has really gotten my fingers itching to play.  Lisa is a great teacher!  Everything looks so ""do-able.""  I recommend this to all beginners and I'm sure there are tips experienced clayers will find helpful, too.",1178409600,,382,4.984126984126984
8116884,5,B000F3T5AS,"Wow. This is an excellent DVD. As someone who has never tried polymer clay, this was a fantastic resource. Lisa Pavelka made everything look easy and I was able to create my own polymer clay items right away. I highly recommend anything Lisa Pavelka's name is on and highly recommend this title. Enjoy!",1162684800,7,302,4.716981132075472
8116885,5,B000F3T5AS,"If you've seen Lisa on Carol Duvall, you know that her projects may look complex, but her clear instruction makes her stunning artwork attainable by all.  What I like about this DVD is that it has something for everyone.

Beginning clayers can easily learn about clay and work side-by-side with Lisa to understand the basics.  Lisa takes you through clays, tools, work surfaces, baking, sanding and polishing, cleaning up and storage.  After learning the basics, Lisa will take you through six very beautiful projects that will allow you to go at your own pace and achieve the results you want.

While beginners will enjoy this DVD, experienced clayers will love her projects as well as pick up some tips and tricks in the introductory section.  I always find something new in even the most basic instructions, and this DVD is no exception.

This is a great DVD for all levels, and a great way to have a private lesson from Lisa in your own home.",1149292800,17,946,4.696969696969697
8116886,5,B000F3T5AS,"I feel Lisa did a fabulous job on this DVD and I highly recommend it. I have been working with polymer clay for over 14 years and I still learned about different products, a few tips, and techniques which I am dying to try.  Lisa does a great job covering the basics of working with polymer clay including the necessary tools  and then goes on to  show and explain in great detail  how to create a variety of  fun projects. Also included is a gallery of her work that pertains to the projects taught.",1146182400,10,500,4.276595744680851
8116887,5,B000F3T5AS,"You'll have to do what I did: drop everything, clear a space, go get polymer clay and dig out stamps and tins and pens and a lightbulb and go play for a few days!  I simply couldn't just watch this and not jump in!

I am NOT a polymer clay person: I barely know how to roll out cookies, let alone polymer clay but my first project had everyone I know stopping me and asking where I bought it! I covered a tin with polymer clay and it was easy and I felt as if I really knew what I was doing by the time I was done.  Lisa is easy to listen to, doesn't miss a detail and this DVD is great to show up close and personal how she does every step of a project.  You get all the technical stuff and all the safety tips, too, as well as a nice variety of beautiful projects to try.",1145836800,21,773,3.8125
