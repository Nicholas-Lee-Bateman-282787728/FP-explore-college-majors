1901215,5,B0000A2ZU9,"We really enjoyed watching John Denver & the Muppets, it made us feel we were in Colorado with them. It's worth watching just to see John sing Durango Mountain Caballero by the campfire, which we think is one of his greatest songs he ever did. There was all sorts of fun with the muppet gang, plenty of traditional songs & more of John's famous songs. We can definitely recommend this video if you are a John Denver fan.

1901216,5,B0000A2ZU9,"I've loved this movie since I was a little kid and was thrilled to get it on DVD, since our old taped copy wasn't in the greatest condition and was missing some portions.  The special effects aren't that amazing--Fozzie is attacked, at one point, by ""wasps"" that look like drawn-on yellow blobs, and some of the backgrounds look pretty disconnected from the action--but some of the little details are fantastic!  The trees, the lake, and Robin's movement are examples of the implementation of impressive forethought.
Rocky Mountain Holiday is not nearly as cheesy as the John Denver & the Muppets Christmas movie, and there's so much to love about it.  Highlights include a Ford truck, a giant maneating chicken, a disgustingly pink Jeep for Miss Piggy to ride in, hilarious jokes, a cozy campfire scene, lovely scenery, enjoyable songs (some of them John's, others not), and the opportunity to see the familiar Muppet characters in flannel and down.  John is completely natural with the Muppets--he doesn't seem to be one of those people who's uncomfortable around puppets.
I am kind of disappointed that the scene where John took Rowlf up in a plane to cure his hiccups was removed.  Still, it wasn't my favorite part of the movie, and we still have our old copy, so I guess it's not that big a deal to me.  Plus, after watching that bit again, I guess I can see why it was taken out.  Rowlf mentions ""Amelia Airedale,"" and his fear of flying just isn't as funny given the way John died.
The DVD presentation is simple but effective.  This movie is a good buy for the whole family--snatch it up while you can!",1127088000,3,1611,4.6879432624113475
1901217,5,B0000A2ZU9,"This heartwarming video will be loved by all ages, and can be especially appreciated by those who have spent time out in nature. The Muppets are hilarious and it is obvious how much John Denver enjoyed making the movie.  Good lessons are learned on the trip and fun is had by all, especially those watching the video. Get an extra copy of this one because your kids will wear it out.",1101513600,5,383,4.394366197183099
1901218,5,B0000A2ZU9,"I'm sorry that the other reviewer purchased the incorrect title, but if you truly are a fan, you'd know which one you are looking at.  I purchased this for my nieces and nephews who used to watch this special over and over (we had it on a Beta tape), and along with their grandpa (who is no longer with us) would sing along with all the songs!  This Christmas was a trip down memory lane, bringing laughter and tears as we all watched and  remembered how simple our lives were back then, and what we truly miss about it now.  Hope the John Denver Christmas Holiday comes out soon.",1072396800,5,580,4.293577981651376
1901219,5,B0000A2ZU9,"What a good film!  This film has a lot of camping stuff involved with this.  Camp songs that they might sing, and cute scenes.  I can't imagine how the puppeteers managed to make the puppets look like they were walking through the woods with John Denver at that level.",1071532800,,268,4.428571428571429
1901220,5,B0000A2ZU9,"I remeber watching this when it was on network television, and with help from the beta, it was recorded and watched over and over again.  Its a great movie with classic songs that you don't hear anywhere anymore.",1067990400,,212,4.578947368421052
1901221,4,B0000A2ZU9,"John Denver and Jim Henson were good friends in real life and teamed up on several occasions (Muppet Show episode, John Denver and the Muppets Christmas Special, and Rocky Mtn. Holiday) to produce some good old fashioned family entertainment.  In fact, according to Jim Henson's son, Brian, the story line for this movie stemmed from the episode of the Muppet Show that starred John Denver, in which he spends the entire show trying to convince the gang to go camping with him (note: this is according to the bonus features on the John Denver episode of the Muppet Show on DVD).
Rocky Mtn. Holiday contains the typical Muppet one-liners (John: ""The mosquitos aren't bad"", Kermit: ""Aren't bad?!  They're delicious!"") and Muppetisms (Fozzie, claiming to speak 'Bearish' had a miscommunication problem with a wild bear thanks to dialect issues - she speaks Grizzlie, he speaks Paddington!) that make Muppet productions enjoyable.  Although this movie was produced in 1982, it is timeless thanks to the natural beauty of the scenery and the ageless Muppets themselves.
For a tv movie that was produced in the early 80's, I am rather impressed with it's transfer to DVD.  There are no special features, unless you count trailers for other Muppet movies or scene selection capabilities, BUT... the color is bright and the sound is well balanced.  At a mere 47 minutes (thanks to tasteful selective editing out of the Rowlf / John flying scene), I am not sure this qualifies as a ""movie"" exactly, but it is a worthwhile purchase nonetheless, if only for nostalgia reasons.  And, for those of you patiently (or impatiently?) waiting for the JD & Muppets Christmas to come out on DVD, you'll be pleased to know that the song ""It's In Every One of Us"" is also in THIS movie.
Enjoy!",1063152000,43,1771,4.867109634551495
1901222,4,B0000A2ZU9,"Over twenty years have passed since this special originally aired, yet the timeless enviornment of the Rockies paired with the engaging Muppets during their heyday keep the program from feeling dated.  There are a few subtle messages sprinkled throughout the special, such as conservation and keeping our forests clean, that still merit hearing today.  Sadly, at least three of the great talents featured in this show are no longer with us, Jim Henson, Richard Hunt, and, of course, John Denver, but the dvd is a perfect legacy of warm family feelings and humor.",1062633600,3,562,5.032258064516129
1901223,4,B0000A2ZU9,"This 1982 special is just beyond cute. While Miss Piggy only shows up in a cameo, the rest of the core gang is here...including Kermit's nephew Robin. It's a mix of campfire classics and some wonderful John Denver songs. The highlight of the whole show is John singing CATCH ANOTHER BUTTERFLY to young Robin when Robin is feeling blue about being so small. BTW, the kid's in that vignette just happen to be Joh'ns own kids Zach and AnnaKate. This is an awesome special. My only ""complaint"" is that it was over so soon.",1062633600,2,518,4.5212765957446805
1901224,5,B0000A2ZU9,"Although the DVD hasn't been released yet, I have a copy of this wonderful tv special on video, so let me be the first to write a review.
This special is exactly what it promises to be: John Denver taking the entire muppet gang on a camping trip. You see them hiking, fishing and building a camp. John also takes Rowlf flying and tries to help him get rid of the hick-ups by doing acrobatic stunts. At the end of the day everyone gathers round the campfire to tell stories and sing songs.
At one point, Kermit's nephew Robin is feeling sad about being so small and then John reminds him how precious it is to be young and see the world with innocent eyes by singing ""Catch Another Butterfly"" to him. At the end of the day he sings Robin to sleep with the sweet lullaby ""No One Like You"".
Rocky Mountain Holiday features some well known traditional songs, as well as some Denver standards like ""Poems, Prayers and Promises"" and ""Grandma's Feather Bed"". There is also one song that John wrote especially for this occasion. It's called ""Durango Mountain Caballero"" and most Denver fans agree that it's one of the best he's ever written.
All in all, this DVD will undoubtedly prove to be money well spent, not only for Muppet fans and John Denver fans alike, but really for everyone who's able to look at the world with wonder and see the simple beauty that is always there for each and every one of us.",1057622400,84,1399,4.426356589147287

He does, but the video quality is pretty bad at times.  I am not sure if that is due to the HD tv, or a similar problem, but it can be annoying to watch.  Also, I think its a bit over-priced for the quality.  The only reason I gave 3 stars is for the storyline; its cute and kid-friendly.",1358985600,,459,3.89247311827957

Its ok, Its cute.  But the songs are forgettable except the first one ""Hey old Pal""  and for those who like her I think Miss Piggy only did a cameo.  Way to much of Kermits little nephew

The best suggestion I can give you is,  If you have some kids about five or so,  Buy it,  Watch it with them, so you can visit some old friends  like; John Denver and Kermit and Fozzie when they are not at their best but still good to be with.",1174953600,,583,3.864406779661017
1901264,3,B0000A2ZU9,"If you saw the episode of the Muppet Show where John Denver was the guest, you know he was trying to get the muppets to go on a camping trip with him, but it was not to be. (Well, at least until some years later.) It is virtually impossible to not see this special as a sequel to that episode. John Denver and the muppets go to the Colorado mountains. Overall, there is a good combination of story and music. John and the muppets begin their walk to the campgrounds; Fozzie has some typical mishaps. (But nothing too dangerous.) Statler and Waldorph are present to provide some heckling. John and Floyd go fishing. There is one sad moment in how John asks Robin to do something he is too short to do. (Setting up the clothes line.) John for a moment gets frustrated, but of course, they reconcile, and Robin is able to tie the clothes line if  John can hold him high enough. This is one of the few Muppet gatherings that does not include Miss Piggy. But in her absence, there is a comical flashback of her trying to bring her photographers, flatterers, and hair dressers on a previous camping trip. (If you saw the episode with John Denver, then you will recall she was planning to go camping in a high fashion outfit, and a gold plated backpack.) The story is charming enough, and of course John Denver's songs are in their element with the background of the wilderness. To top of this gathering, there is a climactic (but still hilarious) moment when John tells the story of a man eating chicken who might be roaming the area. Some of the muppets begin to fear that the story is true. This does of course sound silly. And even John (the story teller) tries to explain that it was just a story. But Gonzo finds some evidence that would suggest the story is true. Overall, this is a good story that has comedy, a touch of drama, nice scenery, some of John Denver's great acting and musical skills, and just the right touch of suspense. If you liked the episode of the Muppets with John Denver as the guest star, you will not want to miss this special.",1151712000,2,2051,4.397368421052631
