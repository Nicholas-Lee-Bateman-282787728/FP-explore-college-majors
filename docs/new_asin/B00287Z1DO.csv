3872133,4,B00287Z1DO,"I'm only witholding a star because I'm a Redskins fan who hates having a couple of these games in wide distribution (Anyone remember the 20-6 Redskins win IN Philly IN the playoffs the same year as the vaunted ""body bag"" game?...anyone?)
Anyway...I've seen other ""Greatest Games"" collections for other teams that really came up short when it came to choosing the right games. While there could be nitpicking amongst diehard Eagles fans (the 1960 championship game win over Lombardi's Packers probably just isn't available), this is the best group of games I've seen for one of these sets. I hope future sets will reflect this improvement (like one for the 'Skins that covers regular season and playoff games, not just the Super Bowls).",1244246400,3,735,4.983739837398374
3872134,5,B00287Z1DO,"First let me start off by saying that I am a New York Jets fan all the way. Bleed Green & white. However the Eagles are my second favorite team for 2 reasons. My aunt and uncle are Eagles fans, and I love Eagles fans because they are just as wild, and a lot of times wilder then Jets fans. Anyway this can't be a greater 10 game series because half of the games on here are actual classics. Here are the games.

1. Eagles vs Giants November 19th, 1978: Miracle at the Meadowlands( I don't need to say anything else)

2. Eagles vs Cowboys January 11th, 1981: The first championship game the Eagles won in the Super Bowl era which got them to the big dance for the first time.

3. Eagles vs Redskins September 17th 1989: Eagles rally at the last minute to score a game winning TD in a 42-37 shoot out

4. Eagles vs Redskins November 12th 1990: Buddy Ryan was quoted 5 days before the game saying "" they will get a beating so severe that they will be carted off in body bags,"" and that's just what happened. The Eagles knocked out the Redskins from the start and scored 3 Defensive TD's when they won 28-14. in the process of the brutal beatdown the Eagles managed to take out 9 Redskins players. Including 2 QB's. It was so severe that Brian Mitchell who was the RB for The Redskins was put in at QB by the end of the game.

5. Eagles vs Lions December 30th 1995: The Eagles beatdown the Lions in the highest scoring game in post season history with the final score being 58-37. That was big, but the even greater part was that they only let Barry Sanders(the greatest and most elusive running back ever) gain only 40 yards rushing all game.

6. Eagles vs Steelers November 12th 2000: Even though the Eagles played terrible for most of the game they rallied back late in the 4th to send the game in to OT and then won it by a game winning FG to make the final score 26-23

7. Eagles vs Packers January 11th 2004: 4th and 26( Don't need to say anything else)

8. Eagles vs Cowboys December 28th 2008: This is a sure classic to Eagles fans and Cowboy haters because everything went right for the Eagles before this game because both the Bears and Bucs would lose to the Texans and Raiders. So all the Eagles needed to do was win and they were in, and that's just what they did. they demolished the Cowboys in a 44-6 thrashing making the Dallas Cowboys America's Choke.

9. Eagles vs Falcons January 23 2005: The Eagles get back to the big dance after beating down the Falcons in a 27-10 win.

10. Eagles vs Cowboys October 8th 2006: My personal favorite because it was T.O.'s first game back as a Cowboy and people were ready to heckle the hell out of him. the game went back and forth until Lito Sheppard sealed it with less than 30 seconds by intercepting a pass and returning it for a TD.

Overall this set has at least 5 classics that are definately worth viewing for a lot of fans unless they were a fan of the team on the losing end. I'm definately going to buy it when it comes out.",1244160000,46,2985,4.219298245614035

3872145,5,B00287Z1DO,I bought if for them for Christmas and they are really enjoying watching these games. The color and clarity isn't what we are used to by today's high def standards but some of these games are pretty old. The men didn't mind a bit. They just enjoy working their way through the games in order.,1394582400,,292,4.327272727272727
3872146,5,B00287Z1DO,"This DVD has some great material of the Eagles through the ages, from their days before they were even in Philadelphia or called the Eagles, through the earlier days of McNabb. It has interviews with some of the greats of the club, like Jaws and Tommy McDonald. I watched this with my father and it was a lot of fun seeing him get so excited over players he watched as a kid, players his own father loved to go see play. As a younger fan, I really appreciated the understanding it brought of the history of the franchise, and where todays players sit in a long line of (frustrating) excellence.

A great buy for true Eagles fans.",1390176000,2,629,4.3760683760683765

3872152,5,B00287Z1DO,This collection is a must have for Birds fan.  It starts off with the Miracle in the Meadowlands game from '78 and goes all the way up to the '08 Cowboys game where they thrashed the Pokes to earn an improbable playoff berth.  The set includes both NFC Championship game victories as well as the infamous body bag with the Redskins in '90.  It would have been nice to see the '60 Championship game as part of the set even if it was presented in a truncated form.  But all the games are great and worth having on hand to watch whenever you need a Birds fix.,1373587200,,556,4.168224299065421

3872154,5,B00287Z1DO,"I wasn't an Eagles fan, (or even born,) when some of these games were originally played, so it's nice to be able to actually get to watch some of the older games and more infamous players. Like the ""Body Bag"" game from 1990 with Jerome Brown. Classic. A must for any true Eagles fan!",1341187200,,283,4.2592592592592595

3872157,5,B00287Z1DO,"ordering this for the two games vs. Washington:

- 1989 loss in Washington, where Gerald Riggs ran like a wildman for 220yds, but was undone by a game-deciding fumble for the 2nd consecutive game that season (and he was never the same runner thereafter).

- 1990 ""Bodybag Game"", which saw Washington lose both quarterbacks, and had to resort to using then-rookie Brian Mitchell (college option QB) under center; even so, he did captain a TD-scoring drive.  This game is a fitting homage to that super-crappy artificial turf (or green concrete, really) in the Vet.",1285459200,6,563,4.968085106382978

3872159,4,B00287Z1DO,"I think this is a great collection, But I could have replaced 2 games with better ones. Ok 8 of these are great Eagles football, Maybe they will release another 10 great games and Include the missing great playoff games. But for the price and quality,the 8 games are worth the price, the other 2 games are good to watch too.",1267660800,,324,4.327868852459017
3872160,3,B00287Z1DO,"It's nice to be able to watch the old games, but there are several that should have been included.  I would have traded the overtime win against Pittsburgh for the House of Pain Monday night game.  The playoff game against the Lions and the 44-6 game against the Cowboys were fun to watch at the time, but I wouldn't put them as top 10 in Eagles history.",1264291200,,354,4.268656716417911
3872161,4,B00287Z1DO,"I am die hard Eagles fan.  So, I enjoy watching just about any game they play.  These set has a good variety, not necessarily what I would have picked... but I like all the games on there.  It got 4 stars because I think they could have done more to ""clean up"" some of the older games shot on tape.  They are still good, but a little bit of work could have brought them a lot closer to DVD quality.",1260921600,,398,3.9375
3872162,4,B00287Z1DO,"A great resource for a fan like me from outside the US who has vague memories of some of these classic games or wanted to see the games I'd only ever heard about (ala The Bodybag game). I think I'll get most use out of this collection in the off season when I need my Eagles fix. My only request would have been  to have had the 'pickle juice game' against Dallas added to this set at the expense of one of the other less memorable games as that is one of my own personal favourites.

All the games are good quality as per the original TV broadcast and have been well editted for a seamless view of each game, the ideal way to watch. Highly recommended for any Eagles fan.",1253145600,5,672,4.122137404580153
3872163,4,B00287Z1DO,"I'm sure that I will buy this item since I'm a die-hard Eagles fan but the 10 game line-up looks a little disappointing.  None of the Eagles 3 NFL Championship game victories (1948, 1949 and 1960) is included.  The 1960 game is probably the greatest game in Eagles history.  I know that these games are older but I imagine that NFL Films has them in their vault.  Not including the only championships in franchise history definitely leaves a void.
  Most of the games in the collection are excellent selections.  The 1989 game against the Redskins and the 2000 game against the Steelers are weak selections.  What about the 1991 ""House of Pain"" game or the 1993 Eric Allen touchdown return game?  I think they could have done a little better.

3872164,5,B00287Z1DO,"I'm a ny Giant fan and I have to admit, this is a great set for Eagles fans.  I have pre-ordered it and I am especially looking forward in seeing the Miracle at the Meadowlands game from 11-19-78. It is a prime example of how terrible my team was in the 1970's. But unlike the Detroit Lions, we got out of the wilderness as a result of that game and have been consistantly competitive over the last 25 years. Four NFC Championships and three Superbowl victories prove that!!!",1247788800,2,475,4.3977272727272725
