8232623,1,B000YFTHSM,"This DVD should be free from Winston. Although Andre Scholz is a superb two-handed caster, there is very little instruction here. This is more like an advertisement for Winston. I love Winston rods and their 7133 is one of the finest spey rods ever made but I expected a casting lesson and instead received a 30 minute press release. Not recommended.",1398729600,2,350,4.754098360655738
