6255141,5,B00I9TDMLS,"i wish they would just let Scott keep the films the way he makes em and just make the other directors cut their film, This is the ONLY version anyone should settle with as with all Ridley Scott films.",1427673600,2,200,4.153846153846154
6255142,4,B00I9TDMLS,Loved the extended version.  Amazon advertised that there were extra features and there were none.  Can that be fixed?,1426636800,,118,5.157894736842105
6255143,1,B00I9TDMLS,The description said English format but I received this movie in complete Spanish.  How can I return it and get the movie in English??,1412208000,,134,4.583333333333333
6255144,5,B00I9TDMLS,"Kingdom of Heaven in Christian hands for over one-hundred years could have stayed within their grasp instead of turning it Kingdom of Hell where peace remains elusive for over one-thousand years even to this day if it were not for the naivete of a man in conflict with himself. Frankish blacksmith Balian de Ibelin, so skillfully played by Orlando Bloom, murdered his towns priest and fled to Jerusalem to redeem. Even so, at a crucial moment in the history of the world, where three religions merge, where he could have prevented the deaths of thousands then and now, he refused to command Jerusalems army. Because such an offer was conditioned to first his marriage to Sibylla, the kings sister (with whom he already had an amorous affair), second following the execution of her husband, Guy de Lusignan (played by Matron Csokas), and third killing the crusaders who refused to swear loyalty to him. King Baldwin (Edward Norton), a leper who was dying and wanted to conclude his affair by choosing Balian over Lusignan as chief of the army and thus prevent the slaughter (which followed) of the Muslims.
After the fierce siege and bloody battles, terms are discussed between the contenders.
Saladin: Will you yield the city?
Balian of Ibelin: Before I lose it, I will burn it to the ground. Your holy places - ours. Every last thing in Jerusalem that drives men mad.
Saladin: I wonder if it would not be better if you did.",1405987200,3,1424,4.769230769230769

6255146,5,B00I9TDMLS,"One of the best epics I've ever seen, better than Ben-Hur (1957) IMO. The director's cut, that is.",1520812800,,98,4.5
6255147,5,B00I9TDMLS,Director's Cut adds just the right additional detail to the original.,1520726400,,69,5.363636363636363

6255149,5,B00I9TDMLS,for the full story watch the directors cut,1517184000,,42,4.375
6255150,4,B00I9TDMLS,To me this film was more historically accurate than the ones that make the crusaders all good and the Muslims all bad. (People are people. I have lived all over the world and most people just want to be left alone to take care of their families.),1516752000,,246,4.25531914893617

6255156,3,B00I9TDMLS,"It is unfortunate that a film with such great potential was marred by distortions of the historic record in the service of anti-religious proselytism.  If you want to know the true history of the crusades, read the book by Thomas Asbridge in which he uses Islamic, Christian and Jewish sources as support.",1514764800,3,305,4.865384615384615
6255157,1,B00I9TDMLS,"It took 2 1/2 hours to get any action, even that fight was horrid. Blood lose looked hilariously ridiculous. Overall movie was trash, don't waste money on it.",1510272000,,158,4.678571428571429

6255159,5,B00I9TDMLS,"I really liked the original Kingdom of Heaven and recently read somewhere that theatrical cut was vastly different than the one the director wanted to release, but due to the film's length, the cuts were made...so of course i had to see the director's cut.  I was not disappointed.  The additional scenes really explained motivations that i took for granted or that i completely missed, helped character development (the local priest at the beginning..wow), etc.  If you liked the original, i highly recommend this version.",1504483200,,523,5.129411764705883
6255160,5,B00I9TDMLS,Love the movie.  Have watch it like 6 times.,1502928000,,44,3.888888888888889
6255161,5,B00I9TDMLS,"I've seen four different versions/cuts of this movie.  This one did not include the sub plot of the queen's son being a leper.  Any version, in my opinion, is well worth your time.  The more compete movie is my favorite one of all time for me.  Hard to beat Ridley Scott in any movie he makes.",1502582400,,293,4.178571428571429
6255162,5,B00I9TDMLS,"Love this movie, Ridley Scott, and all historical drama. I was amazed at how much the additional footage included in the director's cut improves and even changes the story. Several plot lines and characters are far more developed. Enjoyed extra screen time for Liam Neeson, Eva Green, Martin Csokas, and the masked Edward Norton. Keep your eyes peeled for Nikolaj Coster Waldau a.k.a. Jaime Lannister, who is seen much more in this version.  If you're a fan, I encourage you to add this to your collection. Was so impressed by the elevated original that I went back and got the director's cut of Oliver Stone's ""Alexander"" as well. Also a worthy purchase!",1502236800,,655,4.848214285714286
6255163,5,B00I9TDMLS,"THIS is the version of Ridley Scott's masterpiece you want to see. Walk right past that earlier theatrical release and go for the long three hours of WOW! Granted, the historical accuracy is a bit misty and several real people in history who did real things in that place and time get morphed into one fabulous character bu tit all makes for breathtaking storytelling. War history fans will find the materiel and machinery both accurate and fascinating. And it WILL get you reading up on a period of time in a place far, far away that really did exist and is the foundational story for three world faiths. The story of the great pilgrimage city of Messina as the departure point for the Holy Land - and the hazardous travel involved - has been waiting a long time to be told and RS did it so very well. The film score is spectacular as in all RS's films, gorgeous gorgeous...",1502064000,,875,4.475

Promptly delivered.",1501200000,,91,4.111111111111111
6255168,5,B00I9TDMLS,Awesome movie. Way better in the director's cut. They simply cut really useful character development from the theatrical and the story is much more meaningful and engaging with that footage.,1500940800,,190,5.366666666666666
6255169,5,B00I9TDMLS,"I had the original movie but decided to get the Directors Cut and I am pleased. So much was left out of the original movie but this clarifies it. Scene after scene make sense now. As a historical buff, I loved it even though its not 100% accurate it still explains much of the time period.",1500768000,,289,4.178571428571429

6255205,3,B00I9TDMLS,"Kingdom of Heaven is good.... but Arn or a number of other films deal with the same (fascinating) subject matter better.  There are fine actors in this but the characterizations (writing) aren't finely wrought enough to earn more than 3 stars, although it's watchable and has some good moments.",1475625600,3,294,5.0

6255214,4,B00I9TDMLS,"Very well produced and acted.  There was plenty of guilt for all involved back then.  However it seemed to have a any Christian slant.  However, as they say, if we do not learn from history... we will repeat it.",1473292800,,211,4.358974358974359

6255216,5,B00I9TDMLS,"If you watched this movie in its Theatrical release and were like, why does it feel like they skipped half the movie? Well, it's because they did, and decided to edit pretty much every substantially important plot and character developmental scene in the movie. They even remove character references and completely reshape the entire connotation of major sections of dialog by a simple edit here and there. It's actually really impressive how seemingly unimportant details are completely changed by these edits into drastically varying plot developments later on.",1471996800,5,563,5.409090909090909

6255221,5,B00I9TDMLS,The nearly 50 additional minutes in this version makes it a completely different movie. Looks like in the in the shorter version a lot of what motivates each character was left on the cutting room floor.,1471219200,,203,4.666666666666667

6255224,4,B00I9TDMLS,"I rented the director's version because many reviews out there gave it a two hands' thumb up. However, I was disappointed. It is definitely a much better movie than the theatre version, but to me, just adding another star to it. It is far from epic in my view.

Why is it so bad? All in all, simply put it, Young Ibelin is a too big a shoe for Orlando Bloom to fill. There should be much more to a character like young Ibelin, he tried, but I think Christine Bale or even Aragon from Lord of the Rings can do a better job than the Elf.",1470700800,,535,4.0

6255227,5,B00I9TDMLS,"I was looking for a sixth star to rate, but couldn't find it.

This film certainly must be Ridley Scott's finest hour. Having sat through three hours of Kingdom of Heaven director's cut, I was amazed how this time piece passed so quickly. This is surely what a movie experience should be. Here we find history, monumental action, hauntingly beautiful locations, spoken love and redemption. Not to mention a brilliant staring cast bar none. For those of you who are not that familiar with Orlando Bloom (in the lead role), I highly suggest you see this actor's magnificent performance. All in all I find myself in awe of this soon to be classic, and do plan on purchasing the DVD from Amazon to ad to my ever growing film library.",1470441600,4,729,4.607692307692307
6255228,1,B00I9TDMLS,"How long must we abide with the retelling and distortion of history (especially that surrounding Christ, Muslims and Jerusalem) for the sake of poor taste, bloodlust and sexlust? Ridley Scott can direct, of course he can, but he can't tell a story worth telling for the life of him, and what shows is the life that is in him. This foolish squalm of a dithering mind that resides up its behind so smears the reputation of decent men and women and leaders, and blurs the truth of the evil of others, that it completely misses the mark in a highly depraved way - not by accident but for personal entertainment of the low sort - how sad when the truth of the historical events of this era would make just as action-packed and more noble a film. There is a special place in hell for people who have rejected truth and broadcast their scree-ridden visions to millions. When we see a fictional rendering of an historical era that has innocently or creatively changed facts, it is one thing. When it's a stench of purposeful distortion for the sake of the distinctively low-life vision of a depraved soul, it is another. In this sense, it joins the rank of the movie Noah, and dozens of others aiming for epic but achieving empty sound and fury. What a waste of man and horsepower, of talent and money and film. Lunacy is too favorable a word. Just a fabulous display in the service of nothing worth knowing!",1470182400,4,1400,4.515748031496063

6255234,4,B00I9TDMLS,5 stars are earned whenever history trumps the propaganda of Hollywood illusionists and the result is exciting.  Didn't happen here though the movie IS entertaining.

6255238,5,B00I9TDMLS,The inclusion of the extra time (making the total run time on the order of 3:15) help the movie to make more sense where there were previously plot holes.  It is unfortunate that this was not the version that was shown in theaters.,1468627200,,231,4.372093023255814

6255242,5,B00I9TDMLS,"As stated many many times if you are looking for this movie, go with the directors cut! kudos to Ridley Scott!!!! talk about blacken the eye of some pompous studio execs.  Orlando Bloom is a damn good actor, I really liked his humbled character and Liem Neeson is my favorite actor his talent is beyond measure IN MY OPINION.  The soundtrack is incredible.  The only downfall would be and without trying to give the movie away is Mr. Neesons character exits to soon.  Great cast and under appreciated great movie.

6255251,5,B00I9TDMLS,"I like movies that deal with real history, even if the movies themselves are fiction, and I really like Ridley Scott.  As far as entertainment goes, this movie is great.  I enjoyed the performances, especially David Thewlis' Jeremy Irons' and Edward Norton's.  The love story between Eva Green and Orlando Bloom is absorbing, as is Bloom's heroic chivalry, and Marton Csokas' villainous Knight Templar is appropriately loathsome.  I especially liked the plot points about Bloom being a gifted craftsman with experience making military machinery as well as pretty things.  It made his struggle to defend Jerusalem against a much bigger and well-equipped army credible.
Kingdom of Heaven is beautifully filmed and tells a compelling tale of the conflict between a dying young king under whose rule Jerusalem is open to all religions and the people who will succeed him and turn Jerusalem into a murderously Christian kingdom under the Pope's command.  I am a sucker for anything that makes me reconsider my positions on faith and religion; this movie gave me plenty to think about.",1465862400,,1079,5.137142857142857

6255299,5,B00I9TDMLS,"This is a very interesting movie that retells the history of Jerusalem when the Crusaders lost the city to Saladin around 1100 AD. The movie is a combination of historical fact with a fictionalized story of a french blacksmith who becomes a knight for the King of Jerusalem and love interest to his sister.  A good companion read to this movie is a book about the history of Jerusalem entitled, ""Jerusalem - A biography"" by Simon Sebag Montefiore.  Actually, you should read the book prior to seeing the movie.  The book puts the story and the movie scenes in context and make the story of the movie more incredible.  In addition, it sheds light on the popular beliefs of the Christian Church during this period in time.  For example, there was a pervasive view espoused by the French Pope of the Catholic Church that a crusade to the Holy Lands was an opportunity to cleanse your life of its mortal sins.  Consequently, a crusade to the Holy Lands was popular and viewed by the faithful as something that they had to do.  It also sheds light on the character of Saladin, the leader of the Muslims who was ultimately successful in taking back Jerusalem from the Christians.  (By the way, the Muslims controlled the city until 1947 when it was partition by the UN in 1947/48).  Great story and great history to learn and know.",1456185600,17,1325,4.604255319148936
6255300,4,B00I9TDMLS,"Since this movie has a lot of reviews Ill just cut right to the chase and say whats on my mind.
Firstly, if you're going to watch this movie, don't bother with the theatrical version; just go straight to the directors cut. It moves along way more smoothly and it fills in a lot of the holes that were in the theatrical cut.

Im also going to say early on that if you don't usually like Orlando Bloom, than you're not going to like this movie. Personally I don't think he fits the role that well but he did do a lot better than I thought he would. He wasn't anything special, but he didn't ruin it either. The actors filling the minor roles fit a lot better i.e. Jeremy Irons, Brendan Gleeson, Edward Norton.

SPOILERS

This movie has gotten a fair amount of criticism for its deviation from history  and this is not unwarranted  but I am personally surprised that it wasn't more inaccurate. First off, what I found out to be true about Kingdom of Heaven made me like those aspects even more. I mean, imagine my surprise (and joy) when I found out that absolutely gnarly leper King really existed! Gross! And Reynard de Chatillon was a notorious butcher that died in much the same way as is depicted in film. Even more gross! But seriously, the only big thing that is changed in this movie is the end, which in truth was brutal, violent, and unfair for everyone while in the movie it is a very idealistic everyone shake hands and forgive each other so we can have peace. I see the point they're trying to make, but changing history isn't going to help anyone.

My main complaint with this movie though, has to do with the one glaring discrepancy with Blooms character. Initially the whole reason why he starts his quest to the Holy Land is to redeem himself and in doing so save his late wifes soul, and throughout the whole movie he is striving to be the perfect knight and to do the right thing. Now, a lot of the movie falls in line with this and he makes all of these momentous and righteous decisions, but amidst all these noble acts he steals the antagonists wife without a second glance and no questions are ever really raised about it. Its like, So.you are justified in doing this becausehes bad? You refuse to take part in killing the guy because its not right but its still okay to bang his wife? Uh, ok then. It doesnt really make sense to me and that whole subplot just reeks of Hollywood forcing a romance into somewhere it doesnt fit. But what do I know?

I still enjoyed the movie and the complaints I have with it certainly didn't ruin it for me, so four stars is fair. Just make sure you watch the Directors Cut and not the theatrical release. Cant stress that enough.",1455926400,,2684,4.3667334669338675
6255301,5,B00I9TDMLS,Brilliant epic film made by one of the true masters.  Excellent writing and acting performances.  A must-see for anyone who loves this genre.  But see the director's cut.,1455840000,,170,5.0

I remember reviewers stating that Orlando Bloom didn't have a big enough ""leading man"" quality... PPBBBTHTHT!!!  Orlando Bloom is PERFECT in this role, a role a young man grows into...

6255345,5,B00I9TDMLS,Loved it.....for some reason I didn't notice much difference from the other version. but all in all both are GREAT. I have watched them both several times and great viewing for whole family!!,1444867200,,191,4.818181818181818

6255349,5,B00I9TDMLS,One of the best films by my favorite Director Ridley Scott,1443312000,,58,4.363636363636363
6255350,3,B00I9TDMLS,Not enough so rd fighting,1443139200,,25,4.2
6255351,5,B00I9TDMLS,This is definitely the way to watch this movie.  We saw this in the theatre and were a bit put off - the movie seemed incomplete.  Watching the director's cut opened the storylines to what they should be. This movie was done a huge disservice by being cut down.,1443139200,,261,4.3061224489795915
6255352,5,B00I9TDMLS,I never get tired of watching this movie - the directors cut fills in a few important elements of the story that were missing in the original release,1443139200,,149,4.357142857142857
6255353,5,B00I9TDMLS,"It explains so much with the entire movie for viewing...The relationships. The motives. The hatred. The deceit. Yes, it's loosely based on history, but there is enough of truth to show what the historical events are about. This is the one everybody should watch! This is the one that should be in your DVD or Blu-Ray collection!",1442534400,3,328,4.771929824561403
6255354,5,B00I9TDMLS,Well worth the extra hour.,1442361600,,26,4.4
6255355,3,B00I9TDMLS,The additional material drags.  Thought there is some additional exposition that makes the it easier to relate as allegory to contemporary events; overall the original theatrical release was better.,1442188800,,198,5.827586206896552
6255356,5,B00I9TDMLS,The Director's Cut is the only version of this movie that should be seen. Period. Its one of Ridley Scott's best.,1441843200,,113,4.428571428571429
6255357,5,B00I9TDMLS,This is a must watch for all fans of the original movie. The director's cut gives us a story with much more depth. The director's cut transforms Kingdom of Heaven from a great movie into an epic one.,1441756800,,199,4.2631578947368425
6255358,5,B00I9TDMLS,extra scenes were great.  especially since i did not know sibylla had a child with leprosy.,1440374400,,91,4.6875
6255359,5,B00I9TDMLS,The additional scenes added in the directors cut are essential and make this movie ten times better. Some critical scenes explaining important plot points were left out.,1440374400,,169,5.296296296296297
6255360,5,B00I9TDMLS,"Kingdom of Heaven is a masterful film. It can best be described as ""Historical Fiction "" but the storyline allows the viewer imagine what Jerusalem was like at the end of medieval reign of the Christian kings. This has been one of my favorite movies for years but it was the first time I have seen the ""Director's Cut"" version. It more clearly explains some of the personal history and relationships that are left out in the commercial version. I would watch this movie again and again. Ridley Scott does not disappoint in this mammoth production.",1439164800,10,547,4.708333333333333
6255361,5,B00I9TDMLS,To watch this again with the directors cut. 1000 times better,1438992000,,61,4.636363636363637
6255362,5,B00I9TDMLS,terrific movie great hostorical piece,1438819200,,37,6.6
6255363,5,B00I9TDMLS,"This movie is a good proof what happens when companies try to cut content to make a movie shorter. The original movie after all the cuts sucked. This one, it's how the director originally wanted it released. It's a great movie. Great acting, story, battles, scenery..everything. It's a master piece! I highly recommend is movie",1438732800,3,327,4.963636363636364
6255364,5,B00I9TDMLS,"Do not ever watch anything but this directors cut. Stop executive meddling as, compared to the DC, the theatrical movie is unwatchable.",1438214400,,135,5.181818181818182

6255367,5,B00I9TDMLS,"The Director's Cut expands the backgrounds  of the major characters,  clarifies the storyline and adds to the viewer's immersion in the  12th Century ""Holy Land"".  It is superb!",1436400000,,177,5.214285714285714
6255368,5,B00I9TDMLS,"The Director's Cut is amazing, and I stayed riveted to the screen throughout the full 3+ hours.",1436400000,,95,4.647058823529412
6255369,5,B00I9TDMLS,The added content changes the story somewhat and makes the overall movie a better product.,1436400000,,90,5.066666666666666

6255371,5,B00I9TDMLS,INCREDIBLE MOVIE!  Gives an idea of what it must have been like during the fall of Jerusalem to Saladin during the crusades!,1436054400,,124,4.636363636363637
6255372,5,B00I9TDMLS,It's pretty good,1435968000,,16,4.666666666666667

6255376,5,B00I9TDMLS,"The only thing that upset me was that I saw this with my wife at the theater, where we left saying that it was good, but there seemed to be something missing. Then the director's cut comes out and fills all of the holes making it a great epic movie.",1433030400,33,249,4.0
6255377,5,B00I9TDMLS,The best of all,1432944000,,15,3.0
6255378,5,B00I9TDMLS,The directors cut is the only way to watch this movie. It did poorly at the box office because the studio execs were too short sighted to let Ridley Scott send it to the theaters with out cutting it to ribbons. The directors cut is fabulous.,1432080000,27,241,4.260869565217392
6255379,5,B00I9TDMLS,good movie.,1431302400,,11,5.0

6255381,5,B00I9TDMLS,Thumps up very good movie,1430438400,,25,4.2
6255382,4,B00I9TDMLS,"A very good midieval action flick starring Orlando Bloom as a tough guy, a change of pace at the time. Ridley Scott directed so it isn't all bad, but it's no ""Gladiator"". Pretty strong action stuff for a PG-13 rated film and some of the blood is obviously added later.

As far as historical accuracy, I don't know,  but it is hard to believe Bloom's character (Balian) somehow absorbs all the fighting techniques which makes him the toughest guy out there in what seems to be a very short time. How does he know all these military strategies and tactics? Scott does provide a balanced view, actually showing great respect for the Muslims and how they took back Jerusalem.",1430179200,,671,4.630252100840337
6255383,4,B00I9TDMLS,Great story!,1429488000,,12,5.5

8640251,5,B00I9TDMLS,"I didn't like the movie Kingdom of God very much, but the full directors cut is beautiful. It was a mistake for the studio to chop it up like they did. The directors cut is a masterpiece with tender moments and better character development that allows the talents of each actor (even the minor, supporting actors) to shine through brilliantly.",1530921600,,343,4.733333333333333
8640252,5,B00I9TDMLS,"The extended scenes from the directors cut give this movie so much more depth and everything makes so much more sense!  They should have just released this version, anyone without an attention span to sit through it would just be missing out!",1530576000,,242,4.761904761904762
8640253,5,B00I9TDMLS,"Great, movie Not sure why it's not rated higher",1528588800,,47,4.333333333333333

8640255,5,B00I9TDMLS,"I loved this movie when I saw the theatrical version and then was reading about the directors cut and figured I should definitely give it a shot.

It is incredible.  It's so much better than the theatrical version it's unbelievable.  You should buy this, it's in my top three movies of all time.",1526601600,,295,4.528301886792453
8640256,5,B00I9TDMLS,"Why did they not show this version in the theater?

The additional scenes make this almost a different movie much like the director's cut of Blade Runner far outshone the released version with the seemingly never ending Harrison Ford commentary.",1524009600,,245,5.125
