Instead, it is a remarkably grim story of Japans conscious and deliberate quest for the ultimate weapon and the horrific price she and her citizens would ultimately pay for it.

The series begins in a chilling way as the story of a lost high school love between the still present Shuji and the apparently missing Chise.  The first episode moves languorously in flashback until (apparently) American and European bombers suddenly hammer Sapporo, killing one of Shinjis friends (and over 100,000 other people), before being driven off by a mysterious weapon

Chise, the ultimate Japanese weapon because she is both kawai (cute) and can destroy entire cities, which in some ways she is very good at and in some ways she is very bad at.

It seems that Chise, not the sharpest knife in the drawer, got talked into being made into the ultimate weapon by her friendly national government, something which apparently terrified every other country on the planet, including former best bud and ally, the USA, thus bringing to Japan the very thing her existence was supposed to protect Japan from: military destruction.  What follows is a combination of love growing while dying and the horrors of WWIII in Japan as Chise gradually loses her humanity (and her ability to tell the difference between enemies and allies or to care about the same), and they all gradually lose their homes, their health, their loves,... and their lives.

Note: The show consists of 13 TV episodes, but in order to better understand the story you will also need to watch the 2 OVA episode side story&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saikano-Another-Love-Song/dp/B000EJ9VN4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saikano: Another Love Song</a>&nbsp;(2005), which clears up a lot while depressing you even more.  (It also adds some confusion of its own while showing a lot more weaponry.)

Defects?  Quite a few.  To begin with, this is the saddest, most wretchedly downbeat and depressing anime Ive ever watched, except for Grave of the Fireflies, of course.  Second, the artwork, which greatly resembles the manga, is downright ugly.  Third, although this is clearly deliberate action by the government, the war is mostly a mystery to the poorly informed but obedient Japanese, who know little beyond the fact that allied attacks are increasing and their lives are steadily getting worse.  (The OVA series, which is told from a military POV, helps inform viewers better, though it adds some confusion of its own.)  Fourth, it is not made clear whether the increase in earthquakes in Japan is due to the war or just bad luck.  Finally, the ending is more than a little confusing, though absolutely depressing.  (I don't think it is any surprise that Japans suffering in this mess is clearly reminiscent of what she went through in WWII as she was gradually, systematically, and quite deliberately pounded under by a United States that knew exactly what a horror invading the home islands would be.)  Still, what comes through quite clearly is the sorrow of a country and its citizens being destroyed as the direct result of a misbegotten government plan actually intended to protect them.

Watch it and weep for all that is lost.

Note: Like most any arguably confusing anime the English subtitled version is clearer than the English voiced version.

Note: Like most any contrast between a TV series and an OVA series, the infrequent bare breasts show up in the latter so be ye warned.",1514764800,,5680,6.78404401650619

8694686,1,B00R9O4XFS,"This is one of the most depressing shows I have attempted to watch. There is no rhyme or  reason to what happens. You have a girl that wants to be a normal high school girl, have a boy friend etc. What you see right away if a bunch of government individuals that stalks her, and like a bunch of rapist seize her, abuse her (carve her up for weapons parts, and remove her heart). Now comes perhaps the most despicable excuse for a boyfriend. This clown abuses her verbally, treats her like crap, when he can't take it he runs to another girl and just generally acts like a complete jerk. I took offense with this character within the first several minutes and he didn't disappoint. If you want a show that will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth and feeling like going around asking what the hell  was that all about, see this horrid anime. It went into the trash.",1429833600,9,869,4.2926829268292686
8694687,3,B00R9O4XFS,"Saikano, otherwise known as the more marketable She, the Ultimate Weapon, is a tricky one to discuss. Never has the Love It or Hate It label been more appropriate here. This is a teen romance drama, and all the action and war stuff that the DVD artwork would have you believe is the focus, is really just background material for the shows two tragic lovers. The gloom is everywhere within Saikano, at times almost feeling forced, as if to make sure the writers of the show always have something to emotionally challenge the viewer. Sometimes, its even deceptive with its small intervals of hope, but then it sends you right back into the storys depressive state. Talk to your doctor if your heart is strong enough for Saikano.

During an ongoing war in Japan, male high school student Shuuji strikes a romance with Chise, a shy and seemingly normal student whos secretly a militarized human weapon tasked (against her own will) with helping the Japanese defenses win the war. As the ultimate weapon, her secret becomes known to Shuuji, and their relationship enters a happy-sad (but mostly sad) rollercoaster as a result. With every passing episode, Chise succumbs to the unpleasant truth of her existence, a pain thats compounded by the war and her complicated love for Shuuji. Her mentally taxing downturn reaches a boiling point just as the world, ravaged by the now escalated war, does the same. Utterly cheerful, this anime isnt.

Saikano is classified under Tragedy (by pretty much everyone), so its not spoiling anything when I say that this anime is truly bleak in its outlook on love, war, and anything that even remotely gives you a happy feeling. Sure, there are comedic moments and scenes of poignant reflection, but the melancholia seems to kick in about two seconds afterwards. The main romance, itself, is also unforgivingly sad. Shuuji and Chise, even at their most optimistic when they leave their town of Sapparo to start a new life together at one point, know that their love is bound to end in doom. Youll have to watch for yourself the ending of the entire series, as it doesnt completely continue the somewhat overbearing despair of everything before it.

In all fairness, even in the midst of the melodrama, there is a sense of honesty that deserves some credit here. Every character has a personal flaw, a flaw that leads to some level of suffering. Imperfections are everywhere in the shows universe, from the infidelity to the poor choices to even the characters reactions to those imperfections. The drama tries to unfold itself in a realistic manner, providing the character-driven show with a small compelling element to it. So while there is some sentimental overreach to the audience, the storys circumstances that supplement it are never shameless.

My big problem with Saikano is the actual plot, which leaves a painful amount of questions that never get asked. Why did the military even choose Chise, instead of someone more mentally and physically stable? Moreover, how come the military does such a terrible job at giving Chise regular care and maintenance, seeing that shes so important to the war effort? Why is Chise even in regular school with normal people to begin with? Shouldnt her condition prompt at least someone (or, herself!) to keep her away from potentially hurting tons of students? Why does the war actually begin in the first place? Most importantly: who exactly is Japan even fighting against?!

However, I cant simply cite these issues and automatically conclude this series to be a total dud. For all we know, maybe these questions were deliberately left unanswered for the anime. One big reason this might be true is how much focus and attention is put on the personal journeys of the characters themselves. With so much screenwriting investment on the lives of Sapporo, its entirely possible some details were kept abstract for the sake of keeping the show at a specific focus, and not out of lazy storytelling. It doesnt get a complete pass here, but Ill give Saikano the benefit of the doubt.

This is a difficult anime to recommend whole-heartedly, but its also one you shouldnt immediately write off as one to skip. I can't entirely fault the series for trying to be as affecting as the love Shuuji and Chise share. The results aren't always perfect, and it reaches levels of sappiness at times, but the intentions seem to always be in the right place. Likewise, if that kind of sappiness isn't your cup of tea, you may very well want to look elsewhere. With as many cons as there are pros, its a coin toss for many of the debatable qualities of Saikano. Is the romance interesting or overbearing? Is the melodrama touching or manipulative? Is the ending brilliant or the nail in the coffin? Whatever the verdict may be, it took a considerable amount of time for me to fully decide what I thought of this tragedy romance anime. Itll probably be the same for you.",1428969600,14,4925,4.8362989323843415
