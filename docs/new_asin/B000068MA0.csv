The english episode title shown at the beginning of the episodes fades out to a ghost-image then dissapears - my copy, during the final two episodes it's never removed and the ghost image remains across the screen the entire episode into and through the closing credits.

After watching Orphen 2 Revenge via On-Demand I found a good deal and picked up a copy of this DVD.  I watched it over a couple of days and enjoyed it very much.  I can see where some say the animation is better quality and so on; even picking up so close to the end the story was quite good.  I think that anyone who is a casual anime fan would enjoy this series - it has all of the elements of most good series, action, romance, the characters are likable and develop through the story and the plot is interesting and twists in surprising ways.  4 stars - no one is perfect -

The nudity did not puzzle me; given the characters that are nude are souls occupying another body, how would they have clothes?  I suppose they could have been illustrated with clothing, but that's part of what makes anime, anime.  The nudity is not grahpic or in great detail, I have seen more graphic things in other shows.",1171152000,,1290,4.319502074688796

Delivering us the final five episodes of the series, this volume is interesting from the very beginning. All five episodes lead into each other to weave the final stages of this fantastic story; there are more plot twists, fascinating character revelations, and the pacing is just right. There isn't much comedy here, but these last episodes work better without it.
The story is wrapped up excellently, and probably the only disappointing thing is that Leki didn't end up having any importance at all. Ah well, there's still Orphen Revenge.
Although the nudity in the final episode was puzzling and not needed, the last episode delivers everything I was hoping for. Most notably, half the episode is dedicated to showing us the aftermath of the whole story, making it an extremely satisfying ending. This is a better ending than a lot of other titles, and yet they decided to make a sequel series, ironically.
Overall, I highly recommend this series, and I look forward to the next series, Orphen Revenge! :)",1068336000,,1087,4.881081081081081
