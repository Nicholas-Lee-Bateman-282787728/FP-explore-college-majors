7972968,5,B00006SFJR,"Glenn Lewis gives off an awsome vibe that I have not experience from anybody else. This man has a God given talent. When you can hear someone sing live and it sounds better than the cd, then you can defintitely say that the person is talented. If you love to hear beautiful and soulful music, please get this DVD. You will not be disappointed. Also, if you haven't purchased Glenn Lewis debut cd, World Outside My Window, that's a must have as well.",1041033600,,449,4.421686746987952

7972970,5,B00006SFJR,"If you didn't like Glenn Lewis's CD, you'll hate this DVD.  It gives us lots of background stuff, backstage stuff, 2 full videos and a concert in which Glenn turns up the notch on some of his tracks and a couple of covers (the old Debarge track ""All This Love"" and Michael Jackson's ""Rock With You"").
If, however, you are a fan, this DVD will be in your player for at least the next month.
The concert itself is very strong, with a great band that doesn't do that thing where they rush the songs to get them in under time before a headline act comes on.  They set Glenn up in a large club, put some cool candles on the stage and they let him run all night.  The show was great (though, since he wants to make sure you hear what he's doing and that he doesn't mess up, Glenn doesn't jump around or dance or anything like that, which gives it all an intimate vibe) and the extra footage was cool...definitely worth the cost of the DVD.  Well done and loaded with features for fans.",1040774400,6,979,4.191489361702128
