3105607,5,B0013FCYD2,"This movie is a great family film.  The story is heart warming.  It features many legends...my favorite being Mickey Rooney.
He plays a circus owner and shines in his small role.

The movie was filmed in Florida...only a short distance from where I was living at the time.

If you love heartwarming, family classic this is for you.  It's worth it just to see Hollywood legend Mickey Rooney in action again.

3105632,5,B0013FCYD2,"I loved this move, as I worked on the Clyde Beatty Cole Bros. Circus in the 60's and later with Ringling Bros. Circus. So watching the set ups, and performance scene's mixed in with a great story line was very enjoyable. However there was one very big disappointment the DVD is not Closed Captioned, or Subtitles. And I am deaf. So it is very hard to follow the story. As far as I know all DVD's and Blue Ray Disks are now Closed Captioned, and Subtitled these days. I think they missed on this one.

3105633,5,B0013FCYD2,"I loved this movie.  It's an old movie that is very wholesome, which is hard to find these days.  It  had fantasy, love of family, love of others, goodness in people, hope,....all positive things.  I bought it for the children in my life!",1439510400,,238,4.465116279069767

3105636,4,B0013FCYD2,"This movie has a solid story and is appealing to kids.  I like seeing great stars like Julie Harris, Mickey Rooney, and Joe DiMaggio showing their talent, even in their older years.  Some of the acting is sub par, but that is to be expected in a more low budget film.  There is a lot going on in the story, so some of the scenes are a bit choppy.  Overall, it is a good movie for families to watch together.

I was an extra in two scenes in this movie (one of them was a close up) as a little girl.  My college professor and writing mentor wrote the book it was based on.  So because of that, I've seen the film several times, and it is always a fun one to watch.  I recommend it!

3105647,5,B0013FCYD2,"Sitting here alone with my cat, drinking coffee and watching the dreary first day of the new year. I turned on the religious programming channel and was uplifted by a Christian teaching. I was going to switch off the set when, for some reason I switched to the other Christian channel and this Gem was starting. The channel listing was for a 30 min show so I said what the heck, it was still raining. And then it happened.
I was drawn into a wonderful film of drama, humor and the beautiful, uplifting, cleansing, exhilarating catharsis of tasting the joys of the Human Experience!
This was such a jewel of honesty, whimsy and the deep needs of the human Heart that I was literally shocked by such artistry and yet I had never heard of it. Tears and smiles and the rare chance to be one with a story that truly warms the Spirit and the Soul. Actually a miracle, as I was expecting an episode but ended up with a true classic, which I just had to have for my favorites collection! If I could share this with all Mankind, I would in a heartbeat.",1420070400,2,1043,4.326530612244898

3105653,3,B0013FCYD2,"I ordered this movie, which I have never seen advertised as playing in a theater, because my mother and I are in the grandstands during the scenes under the Big Top. During my initial viewing, I was unable to pick us out of the others.

The movie is entertaining, and I enjoyed seeing Mickey Rooney, and Joe DiMaggio, once again.

Perhaps I rated this movie too l, as it is a good recording, with a fair story line, and I will enjoy it many more times in the future.",1403395200,,466,4.224719101123595

3105655,5,B0013FCYD2,This is such an awesome movie it is a shame it didn't get more recognition when it first came out.  Family film with no violence cursing or any other negatives just a wonderful story.,1387152000,4,183,4.382352941176471
3105656,5,B0013FCYD2,"This is one of my daughters favorite movies, so I got it for her for her  birthday. She was so excited! We both love Charles Nelson Reilly! Its a great movie. It came in perfect condition and super fast. Thank you!",1381449600,,214,4.219512195121951

3105658,5,B0013FCYD2,This was a very entertaining movie. It had a lot of good actors. The boy may be an unknown but he did VERY well. You were never quite sure what direction the movie was going to go in. You knew he eventually ended up in a circus but it actually takes a while and there is a lot of good story before hand. It has a happy ending but not one you might be expecting. Kids and adults will enjoy this.,1373846400,2,394,3.876543209876543
3105659,1,B0013FCYD2,"I was expecting this to have more traditional Christian family values.........but not when there is palm reading, fortune telling, and tarot cards!",1368835200,2,147,5.7272727272727275
3105660,3,B0013FCYD2,Another good family film. One finds it hard to get good moral family films that touch the heart and teaches at the same time giving the family a time to talk about the film and how it applies to our life! Thanks,1358035200,,211,4.0476190476190474
3105661,4,B0013FCYD2,"This is a delightful family movie even though the actors may be older, but the story is lovely.

I liked Micky and Julie's role; but Joe Di's could have been much larger to become a real meaningful part of this movie.",1357084800,,217,4.2926829268292686
3105662,5,B0013FCYD2,I have watched this movie a few times. Once in the Theater and also on a DVD. It is such a heart warming film from beginning to end. I have purchased copies sof this film several times as a gift to friends and family.,1350518400,2,217,3.9545454545454546
3105663,4,B0013FCYD2,"the reason I bought this is because it was made in our city of DeLand,  Fla. and our nexy door city, Lake Helen.  I bought 3 and have loaned them out to friends.

this is a fun movie  for Grammas and young children.  however teens aren't interested.",1331510400,,249,4.212765957446808
3105664,5,B0013FCYD2,"An incredibly touching story that entertains the kids too.  The circus footage is believable and fun, and it adds the one and only baseball legend Joe DiMaggio - only a quick couple scenes, but still impressive.

I think it's the only movie Joe D. was in outside the original 'Angels In The Outfield' in the 50s.  I wondered why he would be in a film like this, but I see why -- this film hits the mark with kids and promotes giving kids homes and families via adopting.

Fans of actor Dan Byrd will see him here in what I think is his very first role!

Worth getting for kids or grandkids.",1292889600,2,590,4.232142857142857
3105665,5,B0013FCYD2,This is one of the best orders I have made this DVD made my 81 year old Grandmother very happy she watches this movie everyday. Thanks alot.,1285804800,,140,4.222222222222222
3105666,5,B0013FCYD2,"""The First Of May"" is a deceiving title unti it is defined late in the movie.  Def: First of May is a novice performer starting his first season with a Circus (show).
Mickey Rooney and Joe DiMaggio have almost camio roles, but Julie Harris and youngster Dan Byrd do a great job as leads.  This is a little known picture that failed to get enough recognition, but is good family entertainment that will be enjoyed by viewers of all ages.  Keep some tissues handy.",1277424000,8,462,4.476190476190476
3105667,5,B0013FCYD2,"What a great story!  I don't think I can say enough good about it!  It had character in a young foster boy.  It had the love of a grandmother figure, which the boy needed badly.  It had famous people like Joe DiMaggio and Mickey Rooney, who played their parts excellently.  The circus, the acts, the clowns, the animals.........were so intertwined that you not only saw circus acts, but life behind the acts and how they lived in their everyday life!  As I would say again, this was a must see by people who love heart, character, goodness, and love all rolled up into one package: THE FIRST OF MAY!",1246924800,5,599,4.4495412844036695
3105668,5,B0013FCYD2,This is one of the best pro-family movies I have ever seen: an all star cast with a first class message; beautifully acted and directed. Super-clean fun. A must-have for your family's video library!,1230336000,4,198,4.852941176470588
3105669,3,B0013FCYD2,"I live near the DeLand area, and our local paper really hyped up this movie so thought I'd order it for my 2 yr. old granddaughter who loves the circus.  This didn't hold her attention at all.  There's no more circus footage in it than there is flashes of local signs and businesses and Stetson Univ.  The story is insimpid and simplistic; at least there's nothing objectionable in it, but the little boy is a tossed-around foster child whose father was killed in a motorcycle accident.  I hope the proceeds of this movie went to help either foster kids or the circus animals and not to help any of the old fogeys that starred in it finance their golden years.",1213056000,,660,4.475

3340133,4,B0013FCYD2,"This movie has a solid story and is appealing to kids.  I like seeing great stars like Julie Harris, Mickey Rooney, and Joe DiMaggio showing their talent, even in their older years.  Some of the acting is sub par, but that is to be expected in a more low budget film.  There is a lot going on in the story, so some of the scenes are a bit choppy.  Overall, it is a good movie for families to watch together.

I was an extra in two scenes in this movie (one of them was a close up) as a little girl.  My college professor and writing mentor wrote the book it was based on.  So because of that, I've seen the film several times, and it is always a fun one to watch.  I recommend it!

3340144,5,B0013FCYD2,"Sitting here alone with my cat, drinking coffee and watching the dreary first day of the new year. I turned on the religious programming channel and was uplifted by a Christian teaching. I was going to switch off the set when, for some reason I switched to the other Christian channel and this Gem was starting. The channel listing was for a 30 min show so I said what the heck, it was still raining. And then it happened.
I was drawn into a wonderful film of drama, humor and the beautiful, uplifting, cleansing, exhilarating catharsis of tasting the joys of the Human Experience!
This was such a jewel of honesty, whimsy and the deep needs of the human Heart that I was literally shocked by such artistry and yet I had never heard of it. Tears and smiles and the rare chance to be one with a story that truly warms the Spirit and the Soul. Actually a miracle, as I was expecting an episode but ended up with a true classic, which I just had to have for my favorites collection! If I could share this with all Mankind, I would in a heartbeat.",1420070400,2,1043,4.326530612244898

3340150,3,B0013FCYD2,"I ordered this movie, which I have never seen advertised as playing in a theater, because my mother and I are in the grandstands during the scenes under the Big Top. During my initial viewing, I was unable to pick us out of the others.

The movie is entertaining, and I enjoyed seeing Mickey Rooney, and Joe DiMaggio, once again.

Perhaps I rated this movie too l, as it is a good recording, with a fair story line, and I will enjoy it many more times in the future.",1403395200,,466,4.224719101123595

3340155,5,B0013FCYD2,This was a very entertaining movie. It had a lot of good actors. The boy may be an unknown but he did VERY well. You were never quite sure what direction the movie was going to go in. You knew he eventually ended up in a circus but it actually takes a while and there is a lot of good story before hand. It has a happy ending but not one you might be expecting. Kids and adults will enjoy this.,1373846400,2,394,3.876543209876543

3340157,3,B0013FCYD2,Another good family film. One finds it hard to get good moral family films that touch the heart and teaches at the same time giving the family a time to talk about the film and how it applies to our life! Thanks,1358035200,,211,4.0476190476190474
3340158,4,B0013FCYD2,"This is a delightful family movie even though the actors may be older, but the story is lovely.

I liked Micky and Julie's role; but Joe Di's could have been much larger to become a real meaningful part of this movie.",1357084800,,217,4.2926829268292686
3340159,5,B0013FCYD2,I have watched this movie a few times. Once in the Theater and also on a DVD. It is such a heart warming film from beginning to end. I have purchased copies sof this film several times as a gift to friends and family.,1350518400,2,217,3.9545454545454546

this is a fun movie  for Grammas and young children.  however teens aren't interested.",1331510400,,249,4.212765957446808
3340161,5,B0013FCYD2,"An incredibly touching story that entertains the kids too.  The circus footage is believable and fun, and it adds the one and only baseball legend Joe DiMaggio - only a quick couple scenes, but still impressive.

I think it's the only movie Joe D. was in outside the original 'Angels In The Outfield' in the 50s.  I wondered why he would be in a film like this, but I see why -- this film hits the mark with kids and promotes giving kids homes and families via adopting.

Fans of actor Dan Byrd will see him here in what I think is his very first role!

Worth getting for kids or grandkids.",1292889600,2,590,4.232142857142857

3340163,5,B0013FCYD2,"""The First Of May"" is a deceiving title unti it is defined late in the movie.  Def: First of May is a novice performer starting his first season with a Circus (show).
Mickey Rooney and Joe DiMaggio have almost camio roles, but Julie Harris and youngster Dan Byrd do a great job as leads.  This is a little known picture that failed to get enough recognition, but is good family entertainment that will be enjoyed by viewers of all ages.  Keep some tissues handy.",1277424000,8,462,4.476190476190476
3340164,5,B0013FCYD2,"What a great story!  I don't think I can say enough good about it!  It had character in a young foster boy.  It had the love of a grandmother figure, which the boy needed badly.  It had famous people like Joe DiMaggio and Mickey Rooney, who played their parts excellently.  The circus, the acts, the clowns, the animals.........were so intertwined that you not only saw circus acts, but life behind the acts and how they lived in their everyday life!  As I would say again, this was a must see by people who love heart, character, goodness, and love all rolled up into one package: THE FIRST OF MAY!",1246924800,5,599,4.4495412844036695

3340166,3,B0013FCYD2,"I live near the DeLand area, and our local paper really hyped up this movie so thought I'd order it for my 2 yr. old granddaughter who loves the circus.  This didn't hold her attention at all.  There's no more circus footage in it than there is flashes of local signs and businesses and Stetson Univ.  The story is insimpid and simplistic; at least there's nothing objectionable in it, but the little boy is a tossed-around foster child whose father was killed in a motorcycle accident.  I hope the proceeds of this movie went to help either foster kids or the circus animals and not to help any of the old fogeys that starred in it finance their golden years.",1213056000,,660,4.475
