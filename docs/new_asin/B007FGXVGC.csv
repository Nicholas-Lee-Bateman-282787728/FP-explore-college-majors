5082404,5,B007FGXVGC,"This is one of my favorite yoga videos.  It includes five options for shorter or longer workouts, and even the 37 minute workout is challenging.  It is paced well, provides clear instructions, and is great for the more advanced yoga practioner.  It is hard to find good yoga videos for the intermediate/advanced level, and this one is a keeper.",1383782400,5,344,4.796610169491525
5082405,4,B007FGXVGC,"I bought this video in search of advanced arm balances.  Advanced Vinyasa Flow Yoga is more of an intermediate sequence in my opinion.  She includes multiple flow sequences that are really just variations of the same sequence.  Her arm balance sequence involves a crane pose and a side crane pose.  I enjoy her video as a basic flow practice, but prefer Rodney Yee's ""Advanced Yoga"" and Shiva Rea's ""Yoga Shakti"" for arm balances.",1376092800,2,430,4.8493150684931505
5082406,3,B007FGXVGC,the instructor is a bit annoying.  the video is pretty boring to watch.  i know it's not about watching but i do like when they at least have a pretty background or setting.  the video looks just like the cover.  white.,1360713600,3,219,4.2682926829268295
5082407,5,B007FGXVGC,"If you liked Sadie Nardini's DVD's (no coincidence, the instructor is core strength vinyasa certified) and even Shiva Rea, you will probably like this one as well. There are 5 practices , one 40~ min practice, 2 60~ min. & two 75~ min.(one is core , arm balances and hip openers and the second is creative flow and backbends). some footage repeats itself obviously , but some is unique to every practice. The pace is nice, fast, but not too fast, no long holds. lots of vinyasas & arm balances - handstands, forearm balance, dragonfly, side crow, side plank, crow etc. In the backbends sequence there are bow and 3 rounds of wheel. There are a lot of standing balances as well and nice sequencing like - eagle pose to warrior 1 with eagle arms or side angle to side plank. Every practice has some supine core work and ends with some great long forward bends, supine stretches and hip openers (like pigeon). Even if you're not that advanced it's easy to modify if you know how to. The instructor is nice and calm and actually almost unnoticable, the music is nice and unobtrusive as well. overall a great DVD for an intense yoga workout. I bought it with Zyrka Landwitj's Yoga : Flow which offers a slower vinyasa practices with lots of options as well. The 2 fit the bill for my different yoga moods, sometimes I want a faster and a more intense practice and sometimes a slower practice that lets you concentrate in the breath and the pose. I only wish the DVD's would have a matrix (since the practices are obviously made from segments) so you can create your own practice.",1330732800,26,1574,4.526315789473684
5082408,5,B007FGXVGC,Absolutely love this!,1442966400,,21,6.333333333333333
5082409,4,B007FGXVGC,"Love Jenny Rawlings, and the reason I didn't give this five stars is because her Strong Vinyasa DVD is my absolute favorite.  I have several DVDs (love Rodney Yee too) but I always go back to SV!!",1434931200,,196,4.297297297297297
5082410,5,B007FGXVGC,"It's a good workout and slightly different from the norm.  I really like her.  I do a lot of yoga and this is a nice change.  Even though it states advanced, it's more intermediate/advanced.  She has five different workouts and five different lengths.  It's great whether you have a lot of time, or just want a little extra workout/stretch after cardio.  I wish there was no music, but the dvd is pretty good.",1433462400,,409,4.534246575342466
5082411,5,B007FGXVGC,"Great workout.  It is challenging but not overwhelming,",1433376000,,55,5.875
5082412,5,B007FGXVGC,"One of my favorite practice DVDs! I keep coming back to it time and time again - mainly because I feel like Jenni Rawlings is an excellent instructor who also studies and applies biomechanically updated alignment principles into her yoga practice (check out her information-packed website and Facebook page!). While the DVD is challenging in some areas, it doesn't make me feel discouraged or like I will never aspire to a more advanced pose - just something I need to work on, which actually helps keep the practice fresh. Jenni's voice and the accompanying music are nice - both very soft and soothing. The savasana at the end of all her practices is a good length as well. Also don't be intimidated by the 77 minute practice! It's actually my favorite on the DVD. Jenni does a good bit of abdominal work and floor poses along with the more rigorous standing sequences, so the variety makes the time really fly! One user commented that the DVD was ""boring"" because of the all-white background. While it does seem stark at first, I actually found that I was able to really see how Jenni aligns her body in the different poses, and after a while you hardly even need to look at the TV because her verbal cues are right on track. All in all, an excellent and fresh yoga practice for all levels!",1432512000,4,1293,4.577586206896552
5082413,5,B007FGXVGC,"My wife & I own a Hot Yoga studio in Cary, NC and I purchased this DVD to add to my wife's library of learning materials--she really enjoys it and the instructor--not only in the video but her other online offerings. Great choice for the more advanced yogi...",1420416000,4,259,4.416666666666667
5082414,4,B007FGXVGC,"I use this video often and Jenny Rawlings is an excellent instructor. The only thing that stopped me from giving this five stars is that there is a lot of overlap among the routines on this disk.

I am not a super-advanced yoga student, but I like to be challenged and to constantly try new poses. Jenny's videos, along with Rodney Yee's Advanced Yoga routine are my favorites at the moment. There is a much greater variety of poses in this video than many available (though Rodney Yee's Advanced Video scores better in that category), and you can get a lot out of the routines even without doing the handstands etc.

Even so, I wish she would come out with another video (I have both of her DVDs) which takes the routines another step further with even more variety and less time spent in the traditional warrior & vinyassa poses.",1415145600,2,831,4.533333333333333

5082416,2,B007FGXVGC,"Video is boring, background boring, technician is better for beginners that is going to intermediate.  The exercise positions are great, just the background is boring and if you are an advance it's way to boring.",1399420800,,212,5.057142857142857
5082417,5,B007FGXVGC,This is definitely for someone who has tried yoga before and is in good athletic shape. This is my go to yoga dvd...as previous reviewers have stated there are five practices to choose from ranging from 37 minutes (short flow) to beyond an hour for each of the other respective selections. I can not say enough good things about this DVD...I wish there were more like it!! For what it is worth I also like Jillian Michaels yoga DVD's for shorter workouts.,1391731200,6,455,4.560975609756097

8515728,1,B007FGXVGC,I have a few Yoga DVDs.  This one is so far the worse one.  It is very slow and very boring.  She talked in the background and taped all the poses.,1518566400,,147,3.6774193548387095
8515729,5,B007FGXVGC,"Five excellent workouts - I love them because the instructor, Jenny Rawlings, moves smoothly and quickly through the poses. She gives clear instructions in a calm, soothing voice. The workouts start out with fairly easy poses and as your body warms up, she introduces more challenging yoga poses. I definitely get a good workout and am pushed to master new moves.",1504396800,,363,4.967213114754099

8515733,5,B007FGXVGC,"These are strenuous and challenging yoga sequences, but well paced, clear and well balanced.  I think Jenny is a really good teacher, and this DVD and her Strong Vinyasa Flow DVD are the main part of my home practice lately.",1476403200,,224,4.6
8515734,2,B007FGXVGC,It's squeaky when I do yoga on it and it slips on the floor at the gym. I had to out the gym yoga mat underneath. It IS very soft though and I like that it's long.,1468281600,,163,3.4324324324324325
8515735,5,B007FGXVGC,"I've been practicing yoga for 7 years at home with DVDs. My favorites include Rodney Yee's Power Yoga - Total Body and Intermediate practices, and Shiva Rea's Daily Energy - Vinyasa Flow Yoga. I've used these for years and, while I can so almost all of the poses in them, there is always more progress for me to make in them.

Looking for a new challenge, and looking to move my head/hand-stands away from the wall at last (not yet), I got Shiva Rea's Fluid Power which I am still exploring and enjoying, and, more recently this DVD. And I love it. It is exactly at my level of difficulty and I will get many years out of it --so many new challenges, and new, more difficult, variations here to master. I prefer this to Rodney Yee's Advanced offering because I find that one moves too fast through poses that are too hard for me to even get started on before transitions. I also prefer Rawlings' instruction style to Shiva Rea's --much less woo-y. And the simple background, as others have said, makes it very easy to see exactly what she's doing (which is, after all, the point of a DVD)

My only complaint is that my DVD menu is messed up. The two 70+ minute routines and the two 60+ minute routines are switched --so I select one of the 60+ and get the other one instead. Same with the 70+'s. It might be just a problem with my DVD, and it's not an issue anymore now that I've figured out that's why the times and descriptions seemed off, and now that I know how to get the one I want.",1465516800,4,1488,4.273049645390071
