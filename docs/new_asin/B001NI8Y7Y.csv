Comedies and Proverbs (Comdies et Proverbes) #2 ""Can anyone refrain from building castles in Spain?""
As the final lines of Jean de la Fontaine's fable The Milkmaid and the Pot of Milk emphasize, Eric Rohmer's The Good Marriage focuses on a central character whose daydreams of unrealistic riches end in inevitable disappointment. A very typical Rohmerian obsessive, Sabine (the wonderful Batrice Romand) is an art student living in Le Mans and commuting to Paris every day. Tired of her unfulfilling affair with married man Simon (the lecherous Fodor Atkine who we see more of at the beach with Pauline), she dumps him and abruptly announces her intention to marry, only she has no prospect in sight. Confident of her own worth she allows her artist friend Clarisse (the beautiful Arielle Dombasle) to introduce her at her brother's wedding reception to her cousin, the successful lawyer Edmond (Andr Dussollier). Convinced she has found her future husband she zeroes in on her quarry. The two are ill-matched and we alternately laugh and squirm at the various embarrassing situations they are placed in  Sabine 'buying' Edmond by negotiating a low price for a vase which gets her fired from her job in an antiques store, an awkward lunch in a romantic location which highlights the chemistry which ISN'T there between the two, a birthday party engineered to lure him into her home where she wears a ridiculous teenager's dress while he fumbles awkwardly like a fish out of water, and then her increasingly aggressive confrontations with him over the phone and in his office. 'Normal' people would realize when to stop, but not Sabine. This makes her irritating, especially when it's clear she wants to marry for material gain rather than love. She thinks she is a modern woman fighting for her freedom, but paradoxically this freedom is expressed through a desire to be an old-fashioned housewife leading a comfortable existence where she doesn't have to work and relies completely on her husband  the 'modern' woman Victorian-style! Unusually for Rohmer the film foregrounds social disparities, in this case the gap between the petite bourgeoisie (Sabine and her family) and the haute bourgeoisie (Clarisse and Edmond's family) which Sabine aspires to enter. Tired of her own milieu the film opens with her attempting to escape it through aping a Bohemian lifestyle (Simon is a famous artist), continues with her jealousy (especially of Clarisse) and then escalates with her designs on Edmond. Most revealing of all is a visit to her ex-boyfriend Claude's (Vincent Gauthier) run-down flat where she protests at the 'poverty' of his petite bourgeois existence. Her materialism is captured by Claude's reaction to her intention to marry  ""Sounds like you want to marry an apartment, not a man."" By rights Sabine's character should be annoying, but Rohmer's observation is as acute as ever and together with Romand's sensitive performance we sense her character's vulnerability and simple almost child-like desire which remains touching despite everything. It is very easy for us to judge from afar and tell her to get a life, but Rohmer correctly shows that people can't force themselves to fall in and out of love much less stem any desire of the heart. The film shows how obsession can overtake reality and actually BECOME reality with all the pain that results from it. This is a wise, beautifully acted and very funny film which reveals how so much talk can result in so little understanding, especially perhaps between Sabine and Clarisse, close friends whose social inequality proves to be the main motor behind the downward spiral of the narrative.",1430956800,,3814,5.041204437400951
