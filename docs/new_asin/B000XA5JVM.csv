2999844,5,B000XA5JVM,This is an incredible short film depicting how a child experiences school when they have dyslexia.  Anyone who has a learning disability can relate to the movie.  It reminds us all to stop labeling students who learn  differently as simply lazy or stupid.  We need to educate the educators about learning disabilities.  Congratulations to the film maker!!,1210377600,9,355,5.157894736842105

8227532,1,B000XA5JVM,"bAd is supposed to be a film that can help people discover that they or their child has dyslexia. Instead, it is a pitiful and dishonest portrayal of a whiny boy who simply throws fits, and about his dead father, that frankly is irrelevant to telling the true story about and struggles related to dyslexia. The boy's main teacher did a relatively good job, but the other actors who played counselors and the boy who played the main character, Remy Thorne, were terribly exaggerated to the point where I felt they were making fun of dyslexia, instead of caring about people who suffer from it.",1289088000,,592,4.647619047619048
8227533,5,B000XA5JVM,"This is a terrific movie. I watched it because I am friends with Remy Thorne. Up until I saw this I thought he was a good actor, after seeing this I know he is going to become a household name. Ordinarily i'm not moved by drama, i'm sitting mocking real human drama. But this is something special. Remy is a champ and I wish him the best luck with his future projects.

Don't just take my word for it, buy this and see for yourself. This is a story of victory in the face of adversity from the system (external). As well as adversity from dyslexia (Internal).",1285891200,,559,4.224299065420561
8227534,5,B000XA5JVM,"I was pleasantly surprised with this short film. It's touching, good acting, great cinematography.

The way that dyslexia is portrayed is fantastic. Not enough people understand the difficulty dyslexic children face or the large number of them that do undiagnosed and end up in remedial or special-ed classes ( retarded  classes in the 60s when this takes place). While I am not dyslexic I found myself identifying with John (Remy Thorne), feeling his anguish. A first-class script brings this from a great fictional film to a surprisingly educational film.

An overall success, it is difficult to find shortcomings in this film. No special features, I guess, but since there were none expected it's not exactly a disappointment.",1271721600,,729,5.213675213675214
8227535,2,B000XA5JVM,"Why is Amazon presenting this as a gay film? It's a short film about ADS, it has nothing to do with anything gay. It's an interesting short, but why Amazon thinks it's gay, I have no idea.",1252972800,,188,4.108108108108108
8227536,5,B000XA5JVM,"Never have I been so moved just by watching a movie trailer that I actually contacted the director. Even before seeing the movie, ""bAd"", written and directed by 25 year old dyslexic movie maker, Vincenzo Giammanco Vincnzo, I could feel the power of the film.

 Vincenzo called back from his studio in Ventura, CA, starting our conversation off by saying, ""I think dyslexia is a gift, I really do"". He went on to tell me about how he felt compelled to make the film after graduating from film school a few years ago. He borrowed  $30,000 to make the movie that depicts his experience as a child, being dyslexic.

I checked the mailbox every day for a week until finally, ""bAd"" arrived. The first time I watched it my dyslexia understanding friend sat by my side. Some how I knew I couldn't watch it alone. The movie is only a half hour long but it played in my mind for a week. Perhaps because watching the movie was like watching myself. The fear of reading aloud, the pain of disappointing parents, the frustration of not being able to learn like the other kids. It's all there for us to watch, think about and learn what it's like to have a brain that's different.

Last week I showed a clip of the movie to a group of 60 parents at Lincoln High school in Portland, Oregon, that had gathered to learn about how to advocate for their children within the school system. They were just as mesmerized by the intial clip as I was. Everyone wanted to know where to get a copy.

Next week, I will show the movie and lead a discussion with students. I look forward to supporting the students as they watch ""bAd"". It may hurt at first, but watching ""bAd? is the perfect way to begin the courageous conversations and build muscles that will guide kids into adulthood. This movie is a must see for teachers, parents and children.",1241827200,5,1820,4.45045045045045
8227537,1,B000XA5JVM,"This was easily the most insulting piece of garbage I have ever seen in my life.  I am a special education teacher and a Dyslexia specialist.  I cannot believe that special education was called the ""retard class"" by teachers in the film!  I also am SHOCKED about the way special education teachers were portrayed in this movie!  What only former drill sargeants and ESL speakers want to teach special education classes??  PLUS.... the word should is a red word!!  You wouldn't draw a long sound symbol over it!  I know for a fact that there are plenty of qualified people who WANT to help ALL children.  I could tell that this producer/director has some deep seeded animosity towards the school system he went through, I am certain that his Mother helped him a lot, which is nice.  I just do not think this movie is fair to educators in general.",1218931200,,845,4.58
8227538,5,B000XA5JVM,"I was very impressed with the movie's honest portrayal of a boy with dyslexia struggling through fifth grade, seen through his own eyes. It's set in the early seventies, and there are some strong dramatic moments. I really like the way the film ends--it is ultimately an uplifting movie with a strong message. Remy Thorne, who portrays the main character, also won a Young Actor's award at the LA Short Film Festival.

Since 15 to 20 per cent of the population has dyslexia or a specific learning disability, it's vital to raise awareness, and this film is an excellent springboard for getting the message out. I would highly recommend this film.

8227539,4,B000XA5JVM,"I teach individuals with dyslexia how to read. This film shows graphically what my students have told me about their experiences in the education system. I would caution parents and teachers to preview the film before deciding to show it to a child as it is very graphic. Teachers- if you don't know what your dyslexic students face every day, watch this film!",1213920000,,360,4.73015873015873
8227540,4,B000XA5JVM,"Being dyslexic myself, I identified strongly with the main character of this short movie.  I was picked on very much the same way he was, and suffered similar emotions.  I agree with the preceding reviews that it should be MANDATORY viewing for all PK-8G teachers and administrators.  I also especially liked the visuals in the background, but I don't want to give that away to those who have not seen it.  That was the best part of the movie (for me) and was a very cleaver visual device.

The lead actor and the actress portraying his mother were great, but I found the rest of the cast stilted or too stereotypical.  That may be more the fault of the writing than the fault of the actors, but it came off as amateurish.

Also, kids with dyslexia and other learning disabilities may excel at other activities other than reading and school work (math, art, sports, music, woodworking, sewing, scouting) and while there was a passing reference that he was good at math, none of his ""victories"" or ""strengths"" were depicted until the end of the movie.  A kid with learning disabilities will often try to cover-up that fact by spending his/her time doing those things in which they excel and therefore gain acceptance from their parents and peers.  But, since this movie was short, and had a focused message, that side was never explored or depicted.

The tags associated with this movie were wrong and inappropriate.  This is not a ""coming of age movie"" and there is no sexual innuendo or nudity of any sort.  Those references in the tags should be deleted.",1213142400,25,1556,4.680147058823529
8227541,5,B000XA5JVM,"EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT!!!!

THIS SHOULD BE MANDATORY VIEWING FOR ALL EDUCATORS AND ADMINISTRATORS!

THIS SHOULD BE SHOWN AT EVERY IEP MEETING!!!

To the film maker---we hope to see more work from you on this topic!  Keep up the great work!  You are an inspiration!",1211932800,3,273,5.113636363636363
