7374456,2,B013XD39BC,"Whats it about?

A stoner  who is, in fact, a sleeper government agent  is marked as a liability and targeted for extermination. But hes too well-trained and too high for them to handle.

What did I think?

Whoever thought that mashing a stoner film with an action movie obviously broke the rule about sampling their own product. What appears to be a kitschy trailer has unfortunately translated into an awkward, rambling and painful feature film devoid of any real depth. There are some laughs here and there but, despite the amount of drugs, there are no highs as it struggles to decide whether to go over the top or not.

Enjoy the trailer but don't bother with the whole flick.",1442016000,12,681,4.633333333333334
7374457,5,B013XD39BC,"This is not your older brothers or dads mere variant on a Matt-Bourne or Bruce-McClane storyline.

Sure there is a hero with powers beyond those of any mortal man who is stalked by a murder of well trained assassins given orders by a nutter who eventually gets a comeuppance.

But other than this wisp of a plot, American Ultra's approach might be nearer sui generis, self-created and self-born and uniquely weird and vibrantly quirky.

Here are some markers that justify a charge or recognition of originality:

a. No other movie has been shot on a film stock as supersaturated or in such contrasting colors they might prompt Van Gogh to say, Whoa! Lets give this some more thought: and none has used black light to make Kristen Stewart look not so much a vampire as a zombie.

b. The cast is a good mix of likable leads and several fine supporting actors. Each and all play against type which makes for good viewing since little surprises are frequent.

c. No Bourne or Die Hard movie has ever acknowledged the blood, bruises, burns, scrapes, lost teeth, and concussions that attend the fighting and punishment that our heroes and others absorb in AU.

d. Rather than the usual impossibility of rising above all such pains and injuries, the people in AU act a bit like Peter Griffin from the Family Guy who when he barks his shin, folds up, and makes that sucking inhalation on the back of the front teeth that leaves teeth dry and tears stifled. You get the feeling that the production spent as much on Neosporin as make up.

e. In a way, AU flirts with not having a plot.

f. Instead, expect to view a beautifully sustained hallucination that achieves eventually a tad of sense.

g. Understand that a, e, and f reflect the actors portrayed folks given to taking drugs; further, the characters' back stories suggests they were subjected to mind warping drugs; then there is my reference to color palette hinting that  well, think about it.

Finally, all the actors deserve mention: so, mention.

AU is a movie made by actors willing to try new and unusual roles, by writers and directors and directors of photography wanting to explore and test their imaginations and skills and willingness at risk taking, and for viewers wishing to enjoy as did their brothers or dads a B movie they chanced to see that was surprisingly good.

Nothing in AU shouts, Were all getting Oscars! But everything in it is daring, professionally executed, and worth a view that will probably prompt respect and appreciation in addition to enjoyment.

Youve got to see AU for those experiences. I think it is worth your time and money.",1441411200,2,2614,4.701754385964913

Otherwise, there were good laughs and lots of over the top action. Two and a half cheers! Hip hip! But why did they lose their way with the too-heavy soap opera? Quick!

7374462,5,B013XD39BC,"Lookout, this review may contain minor spoilers - no more I think than those available in the trailer, but anyway don't read the review if you don't want to know ANYTHING about the film's plot.

Just saw it yesterday, with my two kids - at the real brick-and-mortar movie theatre, ah. So, the film flopped, and screen-writer Max Landis is perplexed and unhappy about it? He should be: it's much better than its flop. Sure, it's an action thriller, but there are a few nice and original twists to it. It does evoke the Jason Bourne series - a super-action hero deprived of his memory who doesn't even know he's a super-action-hero, but the memory, the training as a kiling machine, is still there, in the body. But here the twist is that you don't have a super-hero revealing himsself as a super-hero, as in the Bourne series: you've got a total loser, a stoner (Jesse Eisenberg - so improbable to see ex-Mark Zuckerberg turned into Jason Bourne or Ethan Hunt that he must have had a blast doing it), who reveals himself as such. The twist is that he uses not a battery of AK-47s or helicopter machine-guns against his foes, as Jason or Arnold would: he uses whatever daily-life utensils are handy, spoon or frying pan.

The film-making of Nima Nourizadeh and photography also go beyond the mere anonymous-utilitarian, there are a lot of attention-pricking twists, starting with the flashback-on-cocane that opens the film.

With all that, the script does stretch in many points its make-believe ability - even beyond the basic premise, which is that of all these films, that a special agent can single-handedly defeat a whole army - but okay,that's part of the game, these films are no more than the modern and sophisticated (and very expensive) version of the old comic books, credibility is not their main exigency.

My kids - 9 and 12 - loved it. 9 may be a little young, there's graphic violence, bullets shooting throuhgh bodies in slow motion and big spurts of blood, but with the presence of parent and older brother, I think it's okay, and he doesn't seem particularly traumatized. It's a sad fact of our modern world but one we can avoid living with: we live in a world where graphic violence is made into daily entertainment.

So why the flop? Mmmmmhhhh, I think America is not comfortable with things that aren't clear-cut binary: black OR white, good OR evil, action thriller OR comedy. But shades of grey, ordinary mankind with its efforts and foibles, an action thriller containing aspects of a spoof on the action thriller genre, all those are no-nos. One of Schwarzenegger's best movies, and a great movie on the very nature of cinema to boot, a great action movie but also a spoof on action movies, with great sense of humor, intelligence and cinematographic culture - ""Last Action Hero"" - was also a flop. Humor, intelligence and cinematographic culture are too much for the ordinary audiences that make the success of such films.",1440633600,3,2948,4.761252446183953
7374463,5,B013XD39BC,"Absolutely loved this movie. Somehow or the other, I ended up at this film expecting a complete disaster. It had me from the beginning. Topher Grace, Leguizamo, Stewart, Arrested Development guy turn in a host of great performances. Eisenberg shockingly did an amazing job as well. The role just worked for him. There are a bunch of homages to the Bourne movies as well. It's somewhere in between a serious movie and a parody of Bourne, but the end result is great.

I also want to add that this was one of the few times I actually continued watching the movie as the credits came on. Very clever and it tied into the story.

It's a shame it underperformed at theaters though. Sadly, I've come to the fact that movie theaters are slowly dying and need to change their business model to get audiences back to see good movies somehow.

I'd love to see a sequel.",1440460800,71,859,4.493589743589744
7374464,4,B013XD39BC,"Theatrical review.  Spoiler alert.  Director Nima Nourizadeh's only other movie was 2012's ""Project X."" That one being a silly teen party flick featuring many a boob, and which seems to steal much from ""Risky Business.""  He steps it up here a bit with a ""Bourne-like"" story of a man not knowing much of his past.

Jesse Eisenberg plays Mike Howell who clerks at an all-night convenience store.  He likes his pot and spends most of his free time creating a graphic novel featuring a superhero monkey.  His adorable girlfriend, Phoebe (Kristen Stewart) keeps him grounded and supports his eccentricities.  What he doesn't know is that he is a failed experiment begun years earlier to create a force of super-soldiers.  I know, nothing new there.  The program's leader Victoria (Connie Britton) decided to shut the program down after severe psychological problems affected the test subjects, except for Mike.  He was given a new identity, new memories and placed in middle-of-nowhere-West Virginia.

Victoria learns that Mike has been targeted for extermination by a colleague, Adrian Yates (a miscast Topher Grace).  Victoria shows up at Mike's job and speaks a phrase to him which is code to reawaken his previous training.  Yates sends a couple of ""agents"" to attach a bomb to Mike's car but he catches them in the act.  They try to take him out, but something clicks in Mike's brain and he turns into the aforementioned fighter, ala Jason Bourne.

With 2 dead men at his feet he calls Phoebe and together they hide until they can figure out what is happening.  A thread that runs throughout the film is that Mike has purchased an engagement ring and wants to pop the question, ""at the right time.""  It's funny, especially when it actually happens.  Mike engages his pot/fireworks supplier (John Leguizamo) to help him out.  Yates doesn't give up and in fact has a squad of goons whose main attribute is that they are hardened criminals.  First and foremost is Laugher played well by Walton Goggins.

The film has heart and humor, although it isn't the laugh out loud film suggested by the trailers.  It is mostly a hard ""R"" actioner filled with brutality and over-the-top kills.  A surprising twist at the ends puts everything in place.  While the movie won't hold up against better action oriented films, it is very entertaining and fun to watch.  Recommended.",1440460800,36,2362,4.889168765743073

The rogue CIA agent, who seems about 19 years old, preens and sneers like a first-year theater major playing a Wall Street douche bag. A small town in West VA seems depopulated; we only see about five townspeople. The inexplicable CIA invasion of the town makes no sense--complete with exactly one FEMA truck--is staged like a high-school production. Why the CIA wants to terminate Jesse Einsenberg is never made clear, especially when the CIA seem to be driving up the civilian body count--including a building full of policemen--in order to get to him. Random extrajudicial murders are suppose to take place in other countries! Such films require a degree of ""suspension of disbelief"" and logical leaps to get the action going, but this film makes so many cheap mistakes that the creators should be ashamed of themselves.",1512172800,,1109,4.904255319148936

In my opinion this movie is a must watch for any action movie fan because it is suspenseful and fun at the same time.

The guy's character gave up its ghost the third scene, and he was still trying to cling to the six-year-old hypochondriac act well after the plot had been revealed and all there was left was to wait for more bad lines and lame 'fight' scenes.

The characters seem unrealistically young (not that anything about this is super realistic) to have been involved with a covert operation, but nothing in the actors' performances was lacking. John Leguizamo and Tony Hale were delights, of course, and Topher Grace was likable as the narcissistic kid taking Daddy's car for a spin around the block without permission. Connie Britton didn't particularly stand out, but she likewise didn't distract- it was a lukewarm performance. The plot was engaging, though I would have cared for more frying-pan/BAMF moments.

7374539,5,B013XD39BC,"The spread of reviews for this film is interesting. There is a strong enough following for it to get a lot of 4 + 5 star ratings, yet there are also (far fewer) those who hate it. It's not a typical thriller, perhaps it is attracting those who want nothing more than a thriller. I noticed one of the reviewers who rated this film poorly liked the Bourne Alternative. The Bourne Alternative was deadly dull for me (Baby Driver, Logan Lucky, Donnie Darko I liked . . . ).

Coming to this film I didn't know anything about it, which helps; part of the enjoyment is the discovery of what the film is about. The film gripped me throughout and some bits were laugh out loud funny. I wouldn't have called it a comedy, because comedy isn't squeezed out of every event. The humour comes from the characters, through some very well-placed lines and the situations they get stuck in. There are lots of good characters - The Laugher is one of them.

It's hard to pigeon-hole this film into a genre, that's partly the point, and that can be a nightmare for sales and marketing who don't know how to label their product. It can attract the wrong audience, and those who would like the film never find out about it. If enough people watch it, it could grow a strong cult following.",1509580800,,1266,4.405982905982906

Is it a domestic drama, like the first 15 very boring minutes set up?  Is it a comedy, even though there aren't enough funny moments?  Is it an action movie, despite the absence of a lot of action?  The script and the director just don't know what this movie is.  On top of that, the pacing is far more languid than any of those movies would need.  I guess this is OK if you're desperate; it's not awful, it just isn't very good and it fails to fulfill the potential of the concept.",1507766400,,649,4.17741935483871

Personally, I really like movies that incorporate humor where you'd least expect it. This movie for example, is action packed, but it is also hilarious. I think if you liked Zombieland, you might like this too because it has a similar brand of humor (and also they both feature Jesse Eisenberg as the lead). I liked the acting and the story and I thought that as a whole, the movie is very entertaining, fun and unfortunately underrated.

Once that is established, it's a crazy ride all the way through. Character-driven humor is inserted in just the right places.

This is a relationship I did not want to see fail and I was cheering for them to work things out the entire way through. It is truly amazing how they managed to pull off this very violent and dark topic with so much heart by getting the central relationship just right. Mike's and Phoebe's  love for each other is what anchors this story, makes it relatable and not just a shoot out action movie.
 And the action is also really good. Really creative and amazing. Very violent and a bit gory at times but it never felt gimicky. It was brilliant.
 The trailers did not do this film any justice. They tried to pitch it as a comedy actioner starring stoners. Both of those things are coincidental and not the main focus.

7374592,1,B013XD39BC,"First things first: Jesse Eisenberg & Kristen Stewart are perfectly lovely in the film. They have a natural chemistry that has the ability to carry a viewer thru a film that can generously be referred to as: Grosse Point Blank meets Clerks w a heavy dash of John Does at the End & a VERY strong desire to be 'Tarantino-esque'. However, tho it has fairly good taste in the films it 'borrows' from, it's NOWHERE near as good as any of them. The film is just a series of, square on the nose, clichs. I suspected that the film was written by, the eye-rolling dooshcanoe, Max Landis within the first few minutes of the film. For those who don't know, Landis is an obnoxious, egotistical, spoiled brat; coasting on his daddy's (John Landis') reputation & his trust fund. He wrote the ridiculously overrated Chronicle, then a bunch of other films no one's seen, until he wrote American Ultra (which has gained a confusing, kinda, cult following). Point is, you constantly feel like you're watching a film by a writer who THINKS he's the greatest screenwriter since William Goldman. You can almost feel him writing this script, patting himself on the back & playing the skin flute @ his GENIUS. It's highly obnoxious & tiresome. Especially for a film this UTTERLY pedestrian.  Anyway, apologies for the tangent. Just saying, this movie thinks it's WAY cooler than it actually is. It's absolutely nonsensical (not in a good way) & just an utter waste of time, money & talent. Don't rent. Watch it for free if you must. Either way, go watch Deathgasm or John Dies @ the End, instead. MUCH BETTER films.",1500940800,,1592,4.685714285714286

7374623,2,B013XD39BC,"""Never go full retard,"" as Tropic Thunder reminded us. The protagonist of American Ultra goes full loser. He's intended to be a goofy, lovable ne'er-do-well who discovers a whole other side of himself, in the spirit of Chuck and a million other works that have mined this concept for comedic or dramatic effect. Unfortunately, the script digs the character so deep into the hole of cringy, moronic, unlikable loser, and Jesse Eisenberg executes the role with such commitment, that there's no pulling out of the dive: the secret agent stuff, the relationship, and the plot ""twist"" all fall flatter than a ninety-year-old stoner. Also, the movie attempts to be a violent comedy, but something about how it's rendered is just a little too grim, a little too measured, which -- combined with the genuinely pathetic main character -- makes the movie instead feel like a dark thriller that occasionally gets bored with itself, resulting in random manic outbursts. In conclusion: one star for 1-2 tasty fight scenes in the vein of Jason Bourne or Kingsman, and one more for pulling in what could have been a fun combination of actors, but minus three for forgetting to make us care.",1497916800,,1175,4.909547738693467

Some of the action sequences are very cool.  The story is refreshingly unique in it's approach.  Jesse Eisenberg plays a convincing CIA sleeper agent who is activated after his program was set for deletion.  It is an interesting look at a different side of the story, both the activated sleeper agent, as well as the agent who had designed the initial program and was determined to save it once learning about it's planned demise.  It is also worth adding that the love story is captivating without being overly cliche.

The movie's story was actually really good. The only thing I would have done differently is the editing. Too much time on the fights, blood and guts, and not enough on Eisenberg's character, including the stories about the comics he draws.

But both leading stars are very gifted actors, and perform without a trace of egoism or scene stealing. I especially admire Kristin Stewart; she strikes me as both a naturally gifted performer who slips into a role and loses herself as she becomes her character, but she also shows every sign of being a professional actor who has studied and mastered the craft of acting in all its variety. Jesse Eisenberg's astonishing ease in acting is something that persuades me in every role he has assumed. I have seen this plot in other films but that is no matter, because this is by far the best version of it. The script was excellent, the directing top notch and the whole enterprise delightful. In fact, what I saw and enjoyed was one of the best love stories I've ever seen. Despite the outrageously convoluted plot, the overly familiar thriller cliches and graphic violence, I applaud this film for its embrace of true love and willingness to present that theme without cynicism or exploitation.",1485561600,,1107,4.925133689839572

I picked up this movie, because at that time, there were only a few DTS:X encoded Blu-Ray's out and wanted to test it on my system. How this movie averages 3.6/5.0 stars on Amazon is completely beyond me. I have a bad personality trait that makes it nearly impossible for me to stop something that I have started; thus I kept watching this slow moving train wreck for reasons that I would need a shrink to explain because it surely was not getting better scene by scene.

Nothing deep in this movie but I like all the characters and it's a fun movie to watch. In fact, I've watched it four times now and will certainly be watching several more times yet. Check it out.

When the movie first started I wasn't sure about the timing, it seemed to linger showing us it was dead nowheresville a little to long, but now I acknowledge the dead time had the right tension effect. His hidden training kept revealing itself then was showcased with a walk through a big box department store. All the cliche script beats of a rouge spy thriller are here making this movie kind of a spoof of this genre. The pacing is everything in a movie and the pacing is what made this movie work. The same joke wouldn't  stretch into a sequel. They would have to evolve the premise. His keep-uppedness with a lack of awareness approached the zombi genre.

The strange tactics and techniques of MKultra slowly become obvious, as the main character slowly realizes his reality isn't real at all. He doesn't know who he is or what he can do, and his ""handler"" has made the mistake of falling in love with him for ""real"". The action accelerates non-stop, and I found myself holding my breath as suspense turned into really quirky fight scenes, and as the foundering sense of reality being totally unreliable begins to coalesce into a realization that this guy has resources and skills beyond his own comprehension. It ends with a tantalizing change of scene that makes you want to see more. I NEVER thought I'd be giving this thing 5 stars...what a pleasant, quirky surprise.",1484870400,,894,4.849673202614379

After the teensiest bit of a slow start, which works well with the dreamy stoner haze-ridden small-town character and setting, this flick is one of the funniest and most exciting films of 2015. Just SO dang LOL funny and nicely written. Otis: ""He was armed with a spoon, sir."" Adrian Yates: ""He's been farQin' activated, do you not see that?"" Om-hilarious. This movie is SO, SO, SO underrated. Don't know why reviewers did not like this movie, and it did not do well at the box office (did only $27M worldwide on a $28M budget) but I expect it to do well in streaming. So weird to see clunkers do better than this film. ""Cherry Progressive, listen. Mandelbrot set is in motion. Echo Choir has been breached."" Lasseter ""Is that a lyric from something?""

He plays the same exact role in every movie he's in. Just couldn't believe that a skinny geek like him could be a deadly killer and assassin. This film recast with a genuine bad ass in the lead role would have really rocked. Kristen Stewart's cool and great in her supporting role though.

That woman is not a good actor in our opinion. We just can't stand that she always has her mouth open for any emotion she is trying to act out 99% of the time in EVERY movie she has been in. Her facial expressions are always the same as well for any type of mood. I tried not to pay attention to it but we both had a hard time not noticing. For me seeing that all the time makes it hard to get into the movie when an actor you can tell is acting and just seems really fake. I like it when actors are so good at their job that you get immersed in the movie and feel like you are right there with them with the adventure, feelings and all. She just doesn't do that for us.

7375354,3,B013XD39BC,"This movie was way too violent (more like ""ultra"" violent) for its own good. Also, bad language is used throughout. If there was less of both violence and language, or if it could have been toned down like a typical PG-13 action movie, I would have given it another star. The violence and language make the movie believable. I guess it serves the plot. You'll see.

The plot reminded me of another movie of the action/spy genre that this movie borrows from. In fact, very similar plots, but this one is a little different (I'm being vague intentionally because I don't want to spoil anything). Underlying the plot, there is a heart to this film, and at moments you can sense it though the interactions between the main characters. But just when you start feeling something for these characters, the action starts up again. It's kind of distracting but I think the violence and action are supposed to be the main hook of this film. ""Ultra"" implies ""over the top"".

Also, I don't think Topher Grace was a good choice for the CIA boss. I mean, he's this small guy who's the head of this particular CIA operation? It's definitely not believable. I guess they thought it would be funny to include Grace as the boss. And he definitely is. But he just feels miscast.",1482883200,,1259,4.591111111111111

7375399,4,B013XD39BC,"What a pleasant surprise this was. Jesse Eisenberg was, well, very Jesse Eisenberg-ish with that neurotic, Woody Allen-esque delivery. It worked extremely well for this movie.

The real treat was Kristen Stewart (I honestly never thought I'd say that) but it seems she's come a long way since her Twilight Days. She tends to be a bit moody and flat in most movies I've seen, but her sense of humor and delivery were delivered perfectly here. She really was a gem in this film. Plus, the chemistry between the duo was spot-on...definitely the comedic chemistry.

Another aspect I really liked with this movie is that it wasn't a watered-down rom-com or a straight-up drama. While being extremely funny, with a masterful script, it was also violent and bloody. I expected to see fights in this movie where the bad guys get conked on the head and everybody moves on. I wasn't expecting meat cleavers embedded in skulls. I actually appreciated that because it added credibility to the story.

While the premise of the sleeper agent ""awakened"" isn't new, it was handled beautifully and never took itself too seriously.

This is one of the few movies I've watched recently on Prime where I would look forward to another installment. It's certainly ripe for a sequel. And while that is usually a recipe for disaster, it just might work if the same cast (well, MOST of the same cast) were involved.

Very well done from acting to script to fx and cinematography. An enjoyable watch.",1482624000,7,1474,4.810276679841897

Unfortunately, the writer never thought of that. The acting was ok.  We never really believe in the characters, but that's not the actors' fault. It's just that the writing wasn't good. All of the characters and all of the scenes are stereotypes. That could have worked for a farce, but in this film they're just stereotypes because the writer didn't care to develop them. The plot is predictable, the humor is left hanging, and the action scenes are disappointing.

The problem with American Ultra, is the trailer was espresso.  The movie was Americano (watered down).  After sipping the concentrated serum of teh preview, there is nothing new to taste in the full volume that follows.  SKIP the trailer and just watch it.

If you want to be philosophical, there is an underscore that stoners aren't set back just because they're laid back.  If you really care about an impressible audience, there is more violence to worry about...

And then the CIA wants him dead, anyway. What is a poor stoner and his stoner girlfriend to do? Fortunately, Mike does get activated by his old trainer/brainwasher just in time for him to save his own life. What follows is a joy to behold, as the slacker from the Kwikee Mart takes apart an entire team of big, remorseless killers who don't care who else gets hurt.  Eisenberg and Stewart are a really good match in this film, and have great chemistry as the 2 losers-about-to-die.

But the action hero is from West Virginia (perfect) and smokes a lot of marijuana (a stoner they say at some point I think) so its a kind of a funny action movie.

I never thought I would want to sit through a movie where a stoner gets to be a superhero, and I find that I still don't.

If you want the movie equivalent of taking that only interested party home from the bar and all the regret that comes with it, this one certainly will go along for the ride.

Topher Grace was portrayed as practically maniacal. I could never figure out what the movie was trying to do. Was it a serious movie, a comedy, a farce?  I really liked the acting in it and Jesse Eisenberg did an excellent job with the roll.but I was unsatisfied at the end. It seemed to wrap up too neatly at the end leaving me to wonder about what was to become of him now that he was finding out what had happened to him. Could he deal with the effects his programming had on him? I think the movie would have been better off played either seriously or as a comedy.

7375817,4,B013XD39BC,"This movie gathers a lot of hate. For one thing apparently there is a surprising amount of hate online for at least one or both leads. Secondly it was promoted as a stoner comedy (which it isn't) and a odd one at that. The trailer turned me off because it seemed to say these were a couple of happy=go=lucky potheads who seemed to enjoy killing people and blowing up buildings; not my kind of film. But though the leads like nothing more than watching television and hitting the bong, they soon find themselves being pursued by a rogue CIA operation. What's more, Mike (Jesse Eisenberg) finds himself possessing lethal skills he never dreamed of.

The film is often compared to the Bourne films (and contains a few references to them, such as they live in Liman, West Virginia and the director of The Bourne Identity was Doug Liman). But the Bourne films are much more serious, grim and real. This plays a bit more like The Long Kiss Goodnight, way over the top and with comic elements. That's where the film gets a bit confused. After a long comic introduction it suddenly shifts gears and becomes totally serious, then shifts back and forth, undecided just what it is. The acting is mostly good and Kirsten Stewart in particular showed a range I had never seen before.

What it adds up to is 90 minutes of mindless shooting, explosions and fun in a black comedy sense. It's not to be taken at all seriously and doesn't hold up to examination. Just one point: the CIA guys could have gone to the county jail, shown their credentials and taken whoever they wanted without any problem. They would have authority over a local sheriff. But that would simply end the movie. So if you're in the mood for some mindless fun like this, it's well made and fast paced.

A bizarre blend of CIA super-assassin thriller and stoner comedy, held together by the performances of Jesse Eisenberg and Topher Grace, ably assisted by Kristen Stewart and Connie Britton.
It's not particularly sensible, in fact most of the in-world set up is either nonsensical or incompetent, but it works in the context of the story.

Sadly, the trailer gives you the gist, and the best moments of the action scenes.

Like True Romance but with more laughs and higher integrity in terms of character interaction IMHO.  I think a lot of the negative reviews are from people who expected the cliche itself? Or maybe they were somehow looking for realism? I'm not sure.  The point is this movie was the perfect marriage between action spy and quirky hipster romantic comedy.  This is NOT an easy union to pull off organically and I believe their choice in leads is the reason for such a successful amalgam of the two wildly disparate genres. I did not go into this film with optimism but was encouraged by the reviews....And apparently a ferocious love for Jesse Eisenberg which was unknown to my higher reasoning until this very moment.

Jesse Eisenberg, John Leguizamo, and Kristen Stewart did great!!

Topher Grace and Connie Britton were given annoying, dragging roles. Luckily their  scenes are aren't that long. I would absolutely watch it again though, regardless.

Or otherwise keep my attention?This movie did none of the above. I usually enjoy jesse eisenberg's delivery. But I just got the impression he had no idea what to do with this character. It seems the whole movie was built off of the jail scene in now you see me. And to some extent they re-created the scene here. But with none of the dazzling mental trickery. Christen stewart's character  was also lackluster .She seemed a wet blanket to Jesse E's sleep walk performance. Everyone here seemed to really be clueless as to what exactly they were doing here. Topher grace was ineffective at garnering anything resembling fear or anxiety as the movies A-hole bad guy. Maybe the only bright spot was john leguizamo.

The cast didn't really lead me to think I would like the movie, but it turned out the main characters were very good and the supporting cast was believable, too. The premise of the film was kind of knock-off Jason Bourne, but it wasn't a complete copy-cat. The storyline wrapped up all of the weird plot points in the end and the bad guys ended up...

I am unfamiliar with Jesse Eisenberg, but was thoroughly entertained with his matter of fact way of dealing with all the over-the-top challenges that come his way. He is oddly calm through much turmoil, adding to the humour. His relationship with Kristen's character is touching and I ended up caring what happened to them.

I thought maybe it was just because of Twilight, but no, I just don't really like her acting at all. But that's ok, because Jessie Eisenberg saved it. This was a very entertaining movie and kept me interested the entire time. Most of the actors do very good jobs (except Stewart) and the action was well done. I've heard it compared as a stoner Jason Bourne, and while I've unfortunately been unable to see the Bourne movies yet, the concept was great. I would've have loved to see more of the John Leguizamo character, as he was clearly the funniest in the movie.

It's a funny movie about small town lovable loser stoner Mike, who books a trip to Hawaii for his girlfriend and then has a panic attack in the bathroom and they end up not leaving town. I'm not spoiling anything by telling you he's a sleeper CIA operative, because that's just when the movie goes to a whole new level. Kristen Stewart is amazing as the hot girlfriend who stands by her man even as everyone in their small town hates on Mike. To recap, awesome, funny, original movie that will surprise you. I am still quoting lines a week later. The ""mike, you are not a robot"" line had me laughing, as did the ""anaphalaxis"" discussion, and the ""you're the car, I'm the tree"" metaphor.

It has pretty decent acting, even though the dialogue can be predictable at times. It is really a lite action comedy. I think people who don't take violence too seriously would enjoy this movie. It is a spoof of a lot of spy movies. It was entertaining enough. However, the whole plot is pretty much summarized by the trailer.

Kudos to the cast, they all work very well together and John Leguizamo is one of the best actors around. His versatility and willingness to embrace any role is enviable, not to take anything away from Jesse Eisenberg, Kristen Stewart and all of the others. I may watch it again just because I can. I think that if a movie can hold your attention for multiple viewings then it really is better than average, if I can't get through a 2nd watching then I may change my opinion.",1475107200,,633,4.372881355932203

The MK-Ultra program has a long and devious history and it seemed like the movie fast forwarded through a lot of parts that could have been better developed -- and this includes the character's individual development.

TL;DR -- Worth watching once, makes you wish they had put an extra 15 minutes into the exposition and exploration of the characters and the screenplay's particular take on the Ultra programs.",1475020800,,658,4.9818181818181815

I should probably start by saying that I first read a short summary calling it a stoner-action-comedy, and so I watched it the way I would have watched How High, or Kick Ass. Honestly, I can see this movie becoming a cult classic in the next few years. It isn't something that's made for the common masses, but it's humor is subtle, it's action is very graphic novel-esque, and it's written and played out much like one that hit the silver screen with a bang.

7377513,3,B013XD39BC,"Good, but not great largely because the movie can't quite figure out what it is.  It's not quite action-packed enough to be an action movie.  It's not quite funny enough to be a comedy.  And it lacks the lightness between the stars to fit into the rom-com pidgeonhole.  Eisenberg and Stewart work well together (they've been in several movies together and there's a chemistry), but that alone doesn't get the movie over-the-top.  I didn't really know what to expect, but watching the trailer, I expected something a bit lighter in tone.  All that said, it's worth the watch.",1474243200,,574,4.8061224489795915

7377580,3,B013XD39BC,"It's ok. Maddeningly inconsistent in quality, but ultimately ok.

What the movie does well (development of the main characters and most of the action), it does surprisingly well. A lot of the action is well-choreographed and stylized in almost a Bourne series style. The characters, even some of the very archetypal ones are fairly well drawn out in terms of build up and the writing for them. And the ones that are actually the best fleshed out are most of the ones that you end up spending a lot of time with.

But then there's the other stuff, things like the humor, editing, acting, and overall story. The overall story is overdone and it's not even the best take on a story that has been done as many times as it has been done. The humor ranges from actually funny to groaners to ""are you really trying to be this bad?"" And the editing, while occasionally effective and unnoticed, also occasionally calls attention to itself, particularly while trying to cover up the occasionally sloppy camera work. The acting is also fairly inconsistent. For Jesse Eisenberg, Kristen Stewart, and Topher Grace, their work was actually pretty good, albeit hammy even when it fell flat, especially for the writing and the types of characters that they were playing. Other actors, some of which we've seen far better work from, even with far worse writing, it occasionally reaches up to average.

Overall, the movie is fairly entertaining and is worth a shot if you like the premise. It'll be a guilty pleasure, but likely a pleasure nonetheless.",1474156800,,1534,4.803030303030303

This movie proves that without a doubt, but he falls severely short on playing a CIA operative. This was over the top stupid, gory and the script must have been in dire need of a word count that foul language was just thrown in repeatedly... This may be entertainment for high schoolers because the humor was pathetically adolescent, but what could have been a good storyline was just trashed.

For what it was, the actors did a fair job.  It was mostly a bunch of archetypal good and bad guys without much character development, but again - not bad for a fairly mindless movie.  I don't feel I wasted my time with it.  The only true criticism I have is all the F-bombs and swear words.  I'm not some prude, but the gratuitous use of such language really didn't add anything to the story and I found it distracting.  It's one thing if the villains were all foul-mouthed along with being complete psychopaths, but that's not the case.. EVERYONE was foul-mouthed.  I'm not entire sure if there was one single character (with a speaking part) that didn't drop an F-bomb.  Maybe the guy from Chuck...  Anyway, point is, it was RIFE with swear words, which was totally unnecessary - otherwise not a bad movie overall.",1473379200,,991,4.579545454545454

The Director evidently was texting the whole time because the film just kind of jerked along and seemed obsessed with trying (and failing) to prove to us that these two would or could actually be a hook-up. The scenes, like the lead character, were so slacker as to be infuriating.

That would have taken less time yet been just as dumb. Anyway the premise behind this movie is, slacker finds out he is agent and kills many agents trying to kill him including other slacker agents. Spoiler alert he survives just in case enough of us morons bought tickets so that he can make a sequel.",1473120000,2,644,4.330578512396694

It's usually an excuse for a lame film based on a half-fast idea. This film has a preposterous plot - sleeper agent/asset disguised as a small town slacker stoner dude, James Bong, if you will. It is hilarious. I rented it not expecting a whole lot: why should one expect anything out of such a ridiculous concept? It's a movie and a story and it is entertaining. The action works to make the funny parts even funnier, reality sort of being the straight guy for all the humorous bits. Best lines includes one about not wanting to call the police ""because I just killed 2 guys and my car is full of weed and mushrooms"". The acting was very good, the writing was creative and it was just a lot of fun. I ended up watching it twice.",1472947200,,860,4.282208588957055

The story was a bit flat. They JOhn Leguizammo was only in for bit who was the funniest in the whole movie. Walton Goggins was totally under utilized. They took an actor known for being articulate and full of southern catchphrases and intelligent and gave him a role where he sounded like a special needs person and had virtually no lines and for being their best soldier, he was stupid! Just a few bars below Jesse Eisenberg's character who is also stupid.

The premise is promising, a sleeper agent suddenly awakened while he works in the local 7-11.  Of course, he's clueless and has now idea why he is filled with Jason-Bourne-like abilities, nor why people are after him...except, this is all supposed to be a comedy.  And that might be the problem, for this film can't decide whether to take things seriously or not, often drifting off into such over-played roles that you also begin to drift off; where exactly are the clips you saw in the previews (about 40 minutes in so it's a bit of slog to get there).  Cute enough if you're totally out of other things to watch...but not that cute.  Might want to skip this one, despite the trailer....",1472947200,,817,4.530612244897959

This looks like a very low-budget film with non-actors, at first, but gets pretty crazy when Jesse (playing Mike Howell) goes from stoner to ninja.  Pretty entertaining, and you get to see Walton Goggins get his ass kicked.  Weird story line... like, um, CIA ""sleeper"" doesn't recognize the code words meant to ""activate"" him, then ""agents"" are sent to kill him.  Violent, humorous, and you get to see Walton Goggins get his ass kicked.  What more could you ask for?

It's such a waste of talent. I didn't make it more than 15 minutes. I got to the small-town sheriff harassing the dope smoking town headcase and thought ""how cliche"". That was it.

A different approach to movies of similar genre - but one that's done exceptionally well.  The acting performances are exemplary and the story causes both a spell-bindedness and an edge-of-your-seat suspense - which I didn't expect after the initial ""yawning"" session.

7379051,4,B013XD39BC,"So I don't like Kristen Stewart, she is honestly the only thing that kept me from even giving this movie a chance for a long time.  In what little of twilight I was forced to see, and in the huntsman I feel like they could have replaced her with a piece of wood with a frown painted on and achieved the same depth of emotion and acting.  That said this movie was amazing, and I wish I had given it a chance much earlier.  She did a decent job opposite Jesse Eisenberg, who in turn plays his role so well.

It tries to come off as a cross between a stoner movie and a Jason Bourne movie, but honestly, the comedy and action was pretty much lacking.

7379074,4,B013XD39BC,"More fun than I thought, a fun alternative to the ""super soldier"" movie. It is at the same time more violent and has more humor than Bourne movies. I would describe it as comic book style violence with more blood, but not overly graphic or gory.

Some clever action scenes and a funny enough premise. Good performances all around and the body count climbs quickly. Bonus points for having fun end credits that made me actually stick around to watch.  This movie does not hesitate to wipe out its characters you may like in creative, weird, or violent ways. You'll see some action scene kills in this movie that you haven't seen before, and I feel like those are where American Ultra is best: when it surprises.  The movie doesn't have a long run time and doesn't overstay its welcome. It gets sets up, builds, and resolves quickly and cleanly.  I'm sure there are plot holes but the tone of the movie should help viewers not to care.

Jesse Eisenberg starts off unlikable then quickly becomes interesting.  John Leguizamo is great as always in his supporting role. He is quirky and funny and steals the scenes he is in. Topher Grace is definitely unlikable as the film's villain.  Great support by the crazy eyed Walton Goggins as a ""physical villain"" in the movie.

This was a fun viewing on prime.  I didn't see it in theaters, but I was happy with the time I spent watching it. I hope they don't do a sequel and just leave this movie to stand on its own without over-explaining the simple premise in a lackluster part 2.",1472774400,28,1523,4.529197080291971

I'm not saying she's a great actor but Her name was  big time with twilight n def could've sold some tickets to films she'd be in. Idk why she got so much heat for the affair.

The dude from that 70s show is pretty cool in that he is convincingly hate-able.  That twilight chick is a sell out, but she's good in this too.

7379323,4,B013XD39BC,"Pros:
-Eisenberg and Stewart actually seem to have 'chemistry', and I like their performances here.
-For the most part, the supporting performances work as well. Topher Grace as a smarmy CIA climber, Connie Britton as the director of the 'Wiseman' Program that turned Eisenberg into a human weapon, Tony Hale as Britton's former underling she turns to for help, John Leguizamo as the small town crime lord and Walton Goggins as an unstable 'asset'
-For the most part the 'Stoner Jason Bourne' concept works.
Cons:
-Some of the other performances are a little iffy.
-Not a lot of surprises, if you're savvy of the genre tropes the ABCs are easy to work out.
Overall:
Enjoyable flick that's almost a parody but more an homage to the Bourne/amnesiac secret agent genre that's becoming more and more of a thing. If you can't stand the leads this won't change your mind though.",1472428800,,872,4.82
7379324,3,B013XD39BC,"It's good for what it is. A trite action flick that you don't have to think too much about with movie physics and a cliche romance. Over all it is enjoyable, but there isn't anything outstanding about it.",1472428800,,204,4.394736842105263

Mike has a weird phobia that keeps him from leaving town..or does he?  The C.I.A. decides they want to terminate him and close the program he was part of, but his former handler doesn't want that to happen so all of the skills he was trained in are activated.  I don't want to say much more and spoil the movie.  I really enjoyed this crazy action packed stoner movie.

There is NO Shortage of ""Bad"" Guys in the Real World, I don't understand why American Institutions are Constantly portrayed as Villains in Hollywood movies.

 And then there is the logic of it all...as in the Bourne series...You have someone trained by the CIA for YEARS and at GREAT Expense....and when something happens to go wrong on a mission...the CIA's Very FIRST Thought is to Kill the Agent they have Invested SO Much in? Does This Make ANY Sense at All?

I'm all for pseudo underdog stories. Aside from a few plot holes and Kristen Stewart's character being an obvious plant in, I thought it was a decent movie. How was Jesse Eisenberg physically fit enough (as this character) to kill so many people in such a short period of time? If he was a trained CIA operative, wouldn't he have had more physical training? I guess they did say it was kind of brains vs braun. It was action packed and moved pretty quickly. Maybe all of the stoners in the world are just CIA operatives waiting to be activated. Topher Grace was such a dick, he played the part well. I recommend this for anyone that isn't much into the acting and is more into action and fun. Stewart is lackluster and still doesn't really emote a whole lot.

He likes to draw and create wild stoner stories. At 25 minutes or so into the film (midpoint plot spoiler) Mike becomes ""activated"" as he is part of a CIA project called Wiseman. Yates (Topher Grace) wants to destroy Mike, while Victoria (Connie Britton) is out to save him.

The film becomes a fight of Mike vs the CIA using psychotic killers. Mike must come up with ways to kill people and defend himself that would make Bourne envious.

This was a fun film. I enjoyed the characters and the fact it could lead to a series.

This movie is not especially humorous and it's really quite violent, but still moderately enjoyable thanks to a nice cast and a brisk pace.

Many are labeling it as a stoner movie but I don't like stoner movies and for the first 11 minutes I almost stopped watching as the drug induced stoner point of view was a bore but the portrayal seemed so precise to real life, I persisted. After all they portrayed him as a diluted loser making terrible choices and it was hard to watch him. But the treasure this story is giving us is a fun example of how our judgement of people does not allow us to access their gifts or see the truth of them. Still the movie itself is great entertainment from excellent acting, fun scenes well scripted choreography, with rather low profile comic book perspective of violence and a minute focus on sex.  An interesting layered way of telling a cool story kept me glued to the screen.. it felt perfect for the times we are in and I would recommend it to anyone who likes to be introspective even while watching fun spy movies.

7379760,1,B013XD39BC,"How does stuff like this get made? Ok so this is a bizarre movie: acting excellent (except Topher Grace), premise excellent, lighting, sound, casting all great. Yet all those components do not a movie make. It's like having the best pasta, the best tomato sauce and burning the lasagna. This movie sets up something then doesn't deliver. I still have no idea what was going on in this movie!! Weak sauce.
The movie can't make up it's mind what it is about, sets up stuff doesn't address it; it's like a crappy studio executive's wet dream, explosions with no meaning.",1471824000,,567,4.68
7379761,1,B013XD39BC,There really isn't an actor out there who can captivate an audience and mesmerize the viewer with their nuanced talent like Walton Goggins. I used to think he could make anything watchable. I now know that is not true. Impressive feat. Even an impressive performance in such a secondary/forgettable role could not save this movie.,1471824000,,330,5.0181818181818185
7379762,4,B013XD39BC,My husband and I were drawn to this movie based solely on the trailer. I had read about it some where before. Having just saw Jesse Eisenberg in Batman v Superman and not being thrilled with his performance I was very hesitant to watch it. I was delightfully thrilled. It starts out a bit slow but picks up for a fun and wild right. The action sequences were great. The acting was ok. Topper Grace should really stick with being a good guy. His bad guy characters are a bit contrite. I recommend this for a rainy afternoon viewing.,1471824000,,531,4.373737373737374

This movie couldn't decide if it wanted to be funny or dramatic, so it managed to do a poor job of either. The action was fine but the tone was all over the place and would have been better served if it had gone full in one direction versus the other (like primarily a comedy with some dramatic beats or even an action-thriller with some funny beats). It's like the writer saw Pineapple Express, got inspired to write something similar and then had all the joy sucked out of it through a thousand notes.

Without any spoilers, I'll just say there are several new relationship possibilities to explore and interpersonal dynamics that could be developed in a followup.

It's funny, has good action and Tony Hale (who I'm always a fan of) in a really underdeveloped supporting role.

7380011,1,B013XD39BC,"To compare Eisenberg's ""Mike"" to Jason Bourne, like another reviewer did, is so far fetched and clearly a ploy to get ratings on their review. (A cheap move on their part, but I respect the hustle.) I even had to scratch my head a few times to remember Eisenberg's character's name -- Mike. Eisenberg is a wuss and can do nothing but make a pouty, baby face the whole movie. He just needed a mother to spit in a kleenex and wipe the dirt from his sad, sucky face. There were too many ""Oh, how did I know how to do that?"" moments, and Kristen Stewart has more masculinity than Eisenberg, so the chemistry was in the negative. It looked like Kristen, or some other female character, was constantly trying to save him from bullies. Throw in bullets, blood, and one off explosions, and we have a weak film going nowhere. The story was lame; the Bourne movies are an entirely different genre, one with a plot. American Ultra was an ultra violent movie for teens who neither know life or good story lines. Topher Grace was overacting; it was hard to watch him, and Lequizamo literally was the only funny item in this movie with his super bad street accent. He provided 60 seconds of laughs cumulatively, which just wasn't enough two save this two hour, tampon commercial with baby Eisenberg and constipated, cat faced Kristen Stewart at the helm.

Why do most if not all action movies always have to have a stupid love twist angle that you can see coming a 100 miles away?

7380074,4,B013XD39BC,"American Ultra is one unusual movie!  It's about Jesse Eisenberg who spends his time in a small town involved in drugs (it even gets to the point he contemplates the life of a tree just minding its own business until someone comes by and interferes with it- yeah man, that must be some serious stuff you're using!) however one night while he's working the cash register at a convenience store a mysterious woman (Connie Britton) comes in and says a series of code words that not only confuses me, but thankfully confuses Jesse as well (after all, if HE could immediately understand what this woman's message is, I pretty much would have concluded this movie was nothing but a bundle of confusion).

From here the movie does a complete 180.  What was a quiet tone for the first 20 minutes while Jesse was hanging out with his girlfriend (played by a woman who doesn't seem to age- Kristen Stewart) suddenly changes after two men give poor Jesse a hard time by stabbing the tires of his parked car outside the store where he works, and we find out something amazing.  Jesse can instantly kick *both* of these guys butts without breaking a sweat, and all he needs is a spoon!  Yes, as a viewer you're probably thinking this movie is going to be some kind of far-fetched superhero thing (at least that's what I was thinking) that won't seem very logical from a storyline point of view, however there's a reason for Jesse's behavior- he was trained by the CIA to be a killing machine!  He just didn't know about it.

And WOW!  Once that fight outside the store happens, this movie changes in such a big way and turns awesome!  Jesse realizes he better do something after murdering two men, so he and Kristen (by the way Kristen is just as frequent of a character as Jesse) decide to run at some drug addicts home while the CIA explores the town in search of Jesse.  And the drug guy... happens to be the always reliably funny John Leguizamo!  Gotta love him.  He's that guy who always finds himself involved in trouble and is the result of many hilarious scenes in many movies as misfortune follows him like it's destiny or something.  He must have the right look to pull off such a character.

Anyway the story is that, with a couple twists and turns along the way (one of them a big one) Jesse must avoid being caught by the CIA.  He's always on the run.  He runs around town all night, finds himself trapped in an upside down car that almost catches him on fire, has to contend with more CIA agents attempting to bring him down, etc.  There is a very slight hint of humor throughout this movie, but honestly for the most part it has a serious tone.  At least the violence is blood launchingly extreme enough that it would sure be crazy for this movie to NOT be mostly serious wouldn't you say, haha.

Topher Grace!  How could you!  Seriously I keep thinking of this guy as that sweet teenager who listens to Aerosmith albums in his bedroom.  Someone who's physically weak and constantly hears about it from his old man, and has a girlfriend named Donna.  Yeah yeah, I can't shake away his That 70's Show character.  It was just so memorable!  But in American Ultra he cusses up a storm!  The F word fires left and right.  Bad Tophy!  Go to your room!  And he often argues with Connie's character which is like the complete opposite of how someone of his natural politeness should NOT be acting.  Then again this new attitude makes perfect sense in a strange movie like this.  He's the leader of all CIA agents I guess.

Anyway I highly recommend this movie.  If for no other reason than the final scene that involves Jesse going ballistic inside a store and whipping all the CIA agents with the items lying around (were those purple paper plates Jesse was slapping in one guys face in one scene?  LOL!)  Yeah American Ultra is far-fetched entertainment, but it's so much fun how can you not watch this movie!  Just watch out for that slow start.  It's only a temporary period of poor writing that changes into something much better 20 minutes later.  Kristen Stewart is really good too.  I said this above but it needs to be said again- does this woman age?  I don't think she does!  Oh and note to self- Connie Britton is not Alley Mills from the Wonder Years, lol.  A big age difference so no excuse for my crazy silliness!",1467417600,,4323,4.475703324808184

7380079,3,B013XD39BC,"I really like movies that take a unique spin on the assassin character. ""Grosse Pointe Blank"" and ""John Wick"" are the golden standard for this type of movie. I was hoping that ""American Ultra"" would be added to the list. I like Jesse Eisenberg, and I really like the idea of a sleeper-cell agent who is too stoned to activate properly. The first 20 minutes of this movie was exactly what I was hoping for. Establish the stoner, imply that he has weird explainable quirks (panic attacks when trying to leave town), show us the ominous CIA involvement, give us the person the stoner is going to fight for (Kristen Stewart). For these 20 minutes I even thought Topher Grace's obnoxious CIA agent was tolerable. The next 20 minutes started to get rocky. I wasn't crazy about how they handled the mis-fired activation, or the stylized action that follows. Though I really enjoyed the concept of having another group of top assassins tracking Eisenberg down, them having fun code names, and the anticipation of agent on agent fight sequences, it was all handled poorly. The top-agents were mental patients (literally), their code names were sort of lame, and the action sequences weren't particularly well choreographed or filmed. The final half of the movie was just uninteresting. It's as if the movie ran out of story, but wasn't quite at the desired run-time, so there is just 30 minutes of padding. Needless to say, the resolution of the film was very unsatisfying and even confusing. Though this is an overall mediocre movie, there are some positive things to say. Eisenberg is great in his role as the stoner. John Leguizamo is also fantastic as a conspiracy theorist drug dealer.

Since everything else is so dull in the beginning of the narrative, a cheap glimpse to the action to come might rivet the viewer enough to stay tuned. Unfortunately, the plot is also turned off and dropped out. Im sure stoner Jason Bourne was a big hit at the pitch meeting, but the final execution falls into dry, lifeless, predictable beats that never excite or intrigue. The hero is woefully miscast, while the others are decent given the weak source. If any one element succeeds, its the romance, but that also shows how misplaced the filmmakers priorities are giving so much time on kissy-googoo eyes while ignoring the easy humor and action this setup couldve provided.

7380173,3,B013XD39BC,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

I have to say up front that Im not a huge fan of Jesse Eisenberg. While Ive enjoyed him in a few movies I find that most of the time I feel as if Im watching the same character transposed from one film to another. There are several actors who have fallen prey to this problem and Eisenberg is just another to fall in with this group. But on rare occasion he acts differently and it is this that shows there is hope for him down the line. This movie falls into the mid-area between those two styles of performing.

Eisenberg stars here as Mike Howell, a stoner employee at a local quickie mart with dreams of writing a comic book about a heroic monkey but little hope of a prosperous future. That all changes one evening when Victoria Lasseter (Connie Britton) shows up and says a few sentences to him. This has no apparent effect on him and Lasseter leaves.

While on a break and stepping outside for a quick smoke, Mike sees two men tampering with his car. When he calls out for them to stop them pull guns and try to kill him. Suddenly slacker Mike knows how to not just defend himself but to take out the two would be assassins as well.

Freaked out and with no clue what it happening Mike calls his girlfriend Phoebe (Kristen Stewart) and tries to tell her what happened. She shows up and is just as startled as he is. As more people show up to take Mike out the pair are on the run with bits and pieces of Mikes mind coming back to him.

It turns out Mike was one of the deadliest assassins ever, employed and created by a secret government agency. When he was deemed unstable a drug induced memory wipe was employed with trigger words to return those memories should the need arise. Now the agency has determined that he knows too much and is far too dangerous to leave be which explains the attempt on his life.

As Mike and Phoebe make their way through the night, more attempts on his life are set in motion. Behind most of these is a paranoid head agent with his own issues as played by Topher Grace. It turns out Lasseter was an agent with a conscience who felt Mike didn't deserve this treatment. As his only ally the odds are stacked against them but then this is a movie so those odds aren't near as bad as you would think.

Eisenberg actually does a decent job here, not relying on the whip snap style of dialogue that he employs in almost every role he has. While that works in some cases it doesnt always. Fortunately the director of the film didn't rely on that and brought something more out of him for the role of Mike. As with another Eisenberg film, THE END OF THE TOUR, when he doesnt rely on this he does a better job. It would be nice to see him not depend on it in the future.

Stewart does exactly what Ive come to expect of her in roles these days. Once again Ive never found her style of acting to be believable and she doesnt disappoint here. The movie suffers from a lack of connection between the two lovebirds. She doesnt have to fall in love with all of her co-stars to make it seem that way but at least make those of us watching believe it.

The movie does entertain of a certain level but at the same time should have been much better than the end result. The schizophrenic genre bending doesnt help at all. Is it a thriller? Is it a spy film? Is it a comedy? Is it social commentary? By the end of the film I still wasn't sure. It wasn't enough of any of these genres to qualify as one or another and at the same time didn't have enough of a singular identity of its own.
I have no doubt that some will find a lot of humor in portions in the film to make them laugh while others will find enough action to satisfy those needs. That it was marketed as a comedy means anyone depending on that will be disappointed. Then again how does one market a movie that doesnt fall into any neat category? While it isn't a terrible movie it does lack in many ways. Perhaps its good enough for an evenings viewing and for fans of both leads but its not one that Id add to my collection for keeps.",1459814400,,4076,4.202046035805626

7380214,3,B013XD39BC,"Didn't really know anything about this film going in, it was like a straight to TV/DVD B grade quality film.  It is a film that is enjoyable enough to watch once, but it's not a film you'd ever bother watching a second time.  I was surprised to see Topher Grace (Foreman - That 70's Show), but it's just hard to believe him as the guy in charge of some division of the CIA or whatever he was supposed to be.  I guess we're just to used to him as the likable social klutz and unfortunately he's to typecast to pull off a leader let alone a bad guy.  Connie Britton (Rayna Jaymes - Nashville) is in this too, she's appeared in a lot of movies I've seen lately.  She plays the ethical agent who just isn't prepared to let a sleeper agent be terminated because he tried to leave the town he was put in.  Jesse Eisenberg (Social Network) is of course that sleeper agent, but too long pretending to be a stoner and using the products has made him forget that. Kristen Stewart is his girlfriend and although she still plays the same character she always does, with the same facial expressions, it does kind of suit the girlfriend of a stoner.

The movie has some fun moments, Eisenberg does some good action/fight sequences but overall the plot has been done before and been done a lot better those times. It had a lot of opportunities to be funnier, but never really went there. Films like the Long Kiss Goodnight certainly are superior films.

If you can come across this for a cheap price or even better can see it for free, it's worth watching, but you're not likely to do so again.",1457049600,,1579,4.346938775510204
7380215,3,B013XD39BC,"Jesse Eisenberg is Mike Howell, a slacker convenience store clerk (and amateur comic artist) living in a small West Virginia town, who learns of his true identity when he is attacked by a group of government secret ops. Kristen Stewart is Phoebe Larson, Mikes girlfriend, who gets involved with the deadly cat-and-mouse chase.

The story of American Ultra may sound like a comedy, but the film as a whole is more like a low-budget action movie  and a very violent one at that. Humor is there, if not as much as you wish  delivered in a deadpan fashion, with effective Eisenberg, who manages to make his character pretty likeable.

The problem is that American Ultra is not as unique or clever as it thinks it is. In fact, the films premise is pretty familiar (The Long Kiss Goodnight Bourne Identity etc.), and its twists are predictable Action scenes are reasonable but not very original, and supports (including John Leguizamo and Bill Pullman) are largely wasted though Walton Goggins is memorable as an unstoppable killer.

As the films title suggests, American Ultra draws its inspiration from Project MKUltra about which many interesting things have been written. Somehow the film failed to decide in what way this material should be used. Comedy? Action? Or romance? The film, reasonably entertaining as it is, tries to be everything, offering little in the way of inventiveness.",1457049600,,1386,4.982683982683983

Again, it is a love story with action, not the other way around. The hapless love-struck hero has a secret that he is not even conscious of. The movie starts slowly, but soon all hell breaks loose and it was satisfying.

It is not a high budget production, but neither is it shoestring. It is interesting and entertaining.

I felt some of the ONE reviews were from folks who want movies to play out according to their script. Just grab some snacks and drinks and watch the movie. People who cannot suspend belief and just let the movie be the movie should probably not be watching movies to begin with.",1457049600,,720,4.446969696969697

I just received American Ultra (in Blueray) and it is the only disk I have ever had a problem with playing. At about twenty minutes into the movie, a box pops up on the screen and mutes the movie. The box tells me that ""the content being played is protected by Cinavia and is not authorized for playback on this device."" The box goes away if I mess around with the remote a little, but it will pop back up in less than a minute. It makes no sense to me why this disk should not work unless Amazon sent me something defective or maybe even illegal somehow. Now I guess I'll just go to Target for my movies so I know I will be getting what I asked for.",1454284800,,745,3.973333333333333

Whether he's killing American CIA agents or playing the down and out stoner, Eisenberg really doesn't hit either mark in this poorly written spy unthriller.  Several plot points miss sync, the love interest with Stewart only sparks (no sizzles), and cameos by Leguizamo (attempting stereotypical gangsta rap) and others similarly fizzle.  And, when did it become hipster cool to make a movie about killing a ton of American agents?

Watched it from Redbox. I only mention this bc I agree w other reviewers who say to wait until it's free w/Prime (or Hulu or Netflix). It missed the 4 stars bc:
(1) Stewart.  there are a couple of scenes where she rises to the occasion. she just has no pulse. maybe she did too many Twilight movies?
(2) Eisenberg's character disintegrates into a neurotic, weeping pile of mush. 60 minutes of 'not knowing how I got this way & what happened to me' is a lot to watch. Unless you're watching Memento. Then, it's great. but these characters start out good & get stuck in a rut.

7380442,4,B013XD39BC,"With over 300 reviews before mine, I'll keep it short.  I wanted to see Jesse Eisenberg work with Kristen Stewart and see how they mesh together.
Well, they mesh just fine.  Jesse plays a low key stoner (he is shown rolling a joint while he is on the clock-that is a true mark in the stoner universe-he doesn't have the least commitment to his job) who discovers in a blinding revelation that he is a secret, highly trained CIA asset.  Stewart is his girlfriend, a CIA agent assigned to his keeping who unexpectedly fell head over heals for him. That perhaps requires the greatest effort to 'suspend our disbelief' that we have to deal with in this totally unrealistic comedy/action flick.  But who cares?  This is just plain fun to watch.  It moves fast, the action rolls by quickly and we are introduced by a succession of interesting characters so the film keeps our attention.
  The cast has a stack of most excellent actors which include Bill Pullman, John Leguizamo (in a sparkling performance as a dim but energetic street level criminal) and Walton Goggins-late of TVs ""Justified"".
  London born director Nima Nourizadeh also directed the recent also fun if nonsense teen comedy ""Project X"".
  This is the second time the two stars have appeared together after ""Adventure land"".

7380454,3,B013XD39BC,"First the streaming rental quality: ok.  Amazon has been giving barely 480 pixel resolution lately especially when a film starts.  Perhaps its a bottleneck somewhere in the network (a few rentals just timed out) but  in anycase a bummer that is making me almost (almost) thinking of going back to renting actual discs.  For this rental the quality was better.  Picture was true hd at least 720 probbably higher.  but however at certain points the screen would go dark.  I would just have to touch play on the remote and the picture would return.  This could be a problem with my monitor or equipment but its a pain and don't see it happen with Netprospex much.

The actual movie
The sleeper agent thing has become its own subgenre: bourne identity, Chuck, even Total Recall.  I for one love the genre and so what if some are copying others.
So if you like the concept the movie won't be all bad.  But it lacks the fun energy of most of the others (I don't care for the Bourne movies though). This movie doesnt have much humor other than John Leguizamo as the shady Rose character.  But even without humor you would at least expect some bounce to it or sense of fun or even camp.  I didn't find any.  In fact the movie gets both grim and dull as it moves along (except one sequence with a ring and tasers that was good but isolated).
At least the photography was colorful.  Also the cartoon over the end credits was great and worth the price of a rental.",1449792000,3,1453,4.409774436090226

It takes the clich ""secret sleeper spy agent"" and makes it an atrocity with a script never fully realized because the scenes do not fit together, characters are never developed, dialogue is poor and doesn't even make sense for the movie. Any action is just over zealous blow this and this up and few real ""action scenes"". There might be a total of 40 sec of action only because they slow the motion down probably to help get length to this mess of a movie.  NOTHING in comparison to Kingsman, bond, or any other well produced, casted and executed movie.  I hope you do not waste your time and/or especially money renting this terrible film.

Then very quickly his life starts to unravel as the secret Bourne type government experiment which trained him decides to get rid of its last living student.

I think the way they directed this is a nice twist, there is a secret code sentence which snaps him out of it, but he is too stoned for it to trigger him back to action.

I couldn't tell if this was intended as a parody, a true action film, or an oddball romance. I thought Jesse Eisenberg pulled off his character pretty well, Kristen Stewart was so-so, and Topher Grace was sort of cartoonish.

7380528,4,B013XD39BC,"Great Premise and Plot!  And some great acting by a cast made up of excellent actors....  with one exception...  This may be a personal bias but I find Jesse Eisenberg to be extraordinarily irritating.

First... he always plays slouching, weak-willed wimps... in every... single... movie...  that he is in.  I know it is his ""shtick"" and that kind of character no-doubt appeals to a certain demographic out there... but he ALWAYS plays that kind of character so I don't see much ""acting"" going on...

And even though the point of this movie is that he IS that kind of character but can turn into a super-killer when put in a stressful situation...  he is SO wimpy and weak-willed the rest of the time that it destroys the occasional ""go get-em dude!""-moments that could have saved this movie.

Here's a little hint for the producers and directors...  if you are shooting for ""deeply emotional"", ""quirky"" or even "" troubled but loveable"" when you create the kind of character that Mr. Eisenberg seems to do so well.... you are only making them come across as ""weak"", ""wimpy"" and ""unable to function like an adult""... and therefore, when you suddenly try to ""toughen up"" the character (like in this movie or ""Zombieland"" or ""Cursed"", etc.),  it only makes the character look even more contrived... and unbelievable.

Moving on to the rest of the cast...

I feel like Topher Grace (as the over-top-evil-bureaucrat) did a great job of being hate-able, but the director (or writer) let his antics get so out of hand that it sometimes became as unbelievable as Mr. Eisenbergs ""wimp-turned-killer"" premise.

Walton Coggins, as usual, did an AMAZING job of playing the sad and childlike psychotic ""Laugher""... the character could have become another over-the-top freak that was so outlandish that he totally misses the mark, but he makes the character so interesting that you hope there is a spin-off movie just for him!

Nearly every other major and minor character did a great job and truly saved the movie for me... but when the main character is so irritating and unbelievable, even a great plot and lots of action cannot completely redeem things.

In conclusion... if you watch the action and acting in the supporting scenes, you'll love this movie!  But if you focus on the main character too much, you may walk away feeling oddly unsatisfied.",1449100800,,2341,4.871212121212121

I was so wrong.

It was suspenseful, humorous and engaging. Jesse Eisenberg's portrayal of Mike was exactly what you'd expect someone is his position to be like. Kristen Stewart, who is often noted for her awkward-yet-effective performances, was utterly brilliant in this role. Connie Britton, Topher Grace and John Leguizamo played perfectly in their respective roles, especially John Leguizamo whom was possibly one of my favorite characters.

There are no third reel short cuts to get out of a narrative swamp. The writing is crisp and makes sense within story that is being played out.  To me, that is high praise in this period of film making.

This is combo storytelling. Robert Ludlum meets Joseph Campbell and some Tarantino. Max Landis (son of John) wrote this very fun screenplay.

Jesse Eisenberg does a great job being both a bit of Jesse Eisenberg and also a different guy who is very accomplished at killing those who are trying to hurt his girl friend and himself.  Imagine....Eisenberg the stud....grrr!

7380690,4,B013XD39BC,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

The BOURNE series is one of my favorite book reads as well as one of my favorite espionage film sets.  The concept of an extremely adept super-soldier losing his memory is very compelling, and many things can be done with it.  In AMERICAN ULTRA, Director Nima Nourizadeh asks what could happen if said super-soldier is actually a stoner with several phobias and severe self esteem issues.  The result is a high-caliber action-comedy that entertains on many levels.

I will be honest:  I did not like Kristen Stewart much prior to watching this film.  Granted, she was great in ZATHURA, but then she went on to do the soul-crushing TWILIGHT films.  At that point, I thought her career was over.  But in AMERICAN ULTRA, Stewart gets to lick her proverbial acting chops and show us shes more than just a cardboard figure that can talk.

AMERICAN ULTRA is shot very well and appears to have a high production value.  The sets look great, the attention to detail is evident, and everything meshes well to offer a great onscreen experience.

The acting is very good, with Jesse Eisenberg and the afore mentioned Kristen Stewart in the leads.  I was thrown a bit by the casting choice for Eisenberg as the sleeper agent, however his skill as an actor shines through and he owns the role with the familiar quirky zest we have come to expect from him.  Likewise, Topher Grace, Connie Britton, John Leguizamo, and Walton Goggins round out a superb cast.

The special effects in AMERICAN ULTRA are decent and fun.  We are given a small dose of gore, but most of it is done in a comical way.  I laughed and also found it interesting to see all of the nontraditional ways Mike comes up with to dispatch his foes.  For example, in one scene, he uses a single spoon to kill two men.

The story is entertaining and compelling.  I am impressed with how much depth the creators put into the film for having such a basic premise.  There are many subtle inferences to concepts such as loyalty, faith, and love, and they all make you think.  I like how the movie forces you to confront idealisms like this and still be entertained.

AMERICAN ULTRA is a big win for me, and I highly recommend it.  Chocked full of action and dark humor, this is a film you won't soon forget after its over.  I plan on revisiting it in the near future, just to enjoy it once more.  Be sure and check it out on Blu-ray, so you can enjoy the HD picture and sound.

In short, a happy marijuana-smoking dude, working in the world's
most unsuccessful supermarket, is about to propose to his girlfriend,
when things go totally wrong, when he is kind of activated (being a super
spy of shorts) and while the CIA is trying to kill him.

Eisenberg is the ultimate stoned spy, while his Stewart plays the perfect
girlfriend (even though she has some big skeletons in her closet). And the
outcome is really funny, and in some scenes really brutal, since he is the only
spy that kills with frying pans and things you find in a supermarket.

This is a really nice movie. Fast, humorous, with a simple plot, and some really
great scenes. A good choice to spend your next 90 minutes!",1447632000,,735,4.603053435114504

The two main characters have great chemistry and are surprisingly moving together.  The other characters are not used enough and I'm not too sure about this director.  He seemed to waver back and forth on the tone of this movie or how to direct the audience to the best part or the heart of it.  For example, the action was at times graphic, the bad guys - over the top cruel,  but the humor was stoner wasted, and the romance was movingly dramatic.  It didn't always flow together.  Too bad.

7380746,5,B013XD39BC,"Enjoyed the heck outta this little piece of junk.

Like a too kissy-licky fuzzy puppy in your lap, the film just keeps engaging you, and yet you're never sure you want to admit it can be adorable.

Checking off the film's errors is too arduous -- there's fleas on this mutt -- yep, but dang, it kept me slavering along several plot dynamics.

No, thanks, but no, I didn't need a love story.  It forced me to love the lovey parts of this mostly love story.  I didn't need a wimp hero with ten inch biceps who traipsed from each event too  bonged or bonked or nerve gassed to get any ""full potential""  expressed, let alone clear headed enough to snarl any bitterly witty rejoinders spat at the baddies, but I liked this hero...go figure...I'm like five decades out of this film's demographic appeal, but there it is.  Glad I didn't wait for Netflix, don't know why this clunkered to zero at the box office -- deserves a look.

5-12-17 3rd or 4th viewing.  Dang thing still kept me in the chair.  So much was familiar but yet I was oddly invested.  Again.

Next time probably less than a year from now.....say....a Christmas gift to myself on a snowbound evening as the world crumbles to economic ruin.  And I don't like Jesse but have seen so many of his films.  Go figure.

Annnnnnnnnnnnnnd I just changed it to five stars.  Sue me.

7380747,5,B013XD39BC,"First of all I will admit this movie may not be your cup of tea, but if you have spent time with the megalomaniac directors on set a few times, you may enjoy it. Secondly, Kirsten Stewart gets a lot of flack for Twilight, but it becomes increasingly clear that it was primarily the directors fault, because since she left the Twilight franchise, she has shown a broad spectrum of thespian skills and an entertaining depth under different direction. This movie was a lot of fun, even thought I was scrutinizing it from a writer/director/production perspective. Though not a masterpiece, its quirkiness is a breath of fresh air, from the generic productions that spill out of the machine these days.",1447113600,8,697,4.816666666666666

7380750,3,B013XD39BC,"Echo choir has been breached, we are fielding the ball. Mike Howell (Eisenberg) is a typical stoner. Lives day to day barely getting by and working at a meaningless job. Everything changes when he catches someone messing with his car. What he does scares him, and when he is told he is actually a government agent trained to be a weapon he begins to wonder what else about his life is a lie. Now he must not only fight to survive but uncover the truth about his life and those around him. This is nothing like what I expected. I don't watch trailers before I watch movies if I can help it, and because of that I was expecting another comedy along the lines of Adventureland or movies in that vein. What this actually is is a really exciting action movie that can best be described as a stoner Bourne Identity. There is comedy in this but for the most part they took this as serious as they could. The movie is actually very exciting and entertaining and one that I surprisingly liked quite a bit. Overall, Bourne Identity, but a lighter version that I really had fun watching.

He works at a convenience store and invests his disposable income into mind altering substances. Like TRUMAN, he has issues when he attempts to leave town, such as panic attacks. He likes to draw and create wild stoner stories. At 25 minutes or so into the film (midpoint plot spoiler) Mike becomes ""activated"" as he is part of a CIA project called Wiseman. Yates (Topher Grace) wants to destroy Mike, while Victoria (Connie Britton) is out to save him.

The film becomes a fight of Mike vs the CIA using psychotic killers. Mike must come up with ways to kill people and defend himself that would make Bourne envious.

This was a fun film. I enjoyed the characters and the fact it could lead to a series.

A stoner  who is, in fact, a sleeper government agent  is marked as a liability and targeted for extermination. But hes too well-trained and too high for them to handle.

What did I think?

Whoever thought that mashing a stoner film with an action movie obviously broke the rule about sampling their own product. What appears to be a kitschy trailer has unfortunately translated into an awkward, rambling and painful feature film devoid of any real depth. There are some laughs here and there but, despite the amount of drugs, there are no highs as it struggles to decide whether to go over the top or not.
