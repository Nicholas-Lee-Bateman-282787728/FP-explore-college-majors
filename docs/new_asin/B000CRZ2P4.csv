8101363,5,B000CRZ2P4,"We've owned this for almost 3 years now and it's still a favorite with my 2 boys.  We got it when my oldest (now almost 4) turned 1, and he's watched it A LOT, and even used to quote from it.  His interest tapered off as he got older, but it's recently made a come-back with him because he's gotten very interested in garbage trucks lately and there is a great little segment with real footage of big trucks in action (there's also a fire truck, dump truck, and moving truck).

I now appreciate the way this DVD is designed to grow with your kid -- the whole thing can be appreciated by younger children for the great visuals and songs (my 9-month-old ABSOLUTELY LOVES this DVD - in fact it is the only DVD he's interested in watching - though he certainly doesn't have the same comprehension level as his brother), and older children can appreciate the short stories, poems, and more complex songs.  An example: they sing one song called ""Traffic Ten,"" where each number is represented by that number of animals riding in a different vehicle (1 aardvark, 2 hyenas, 3 bears...).  For a long time, I knew my son didn't pick up on the words, which are sung fairly quickly, but he still seemed to enjoy it.  A few weeks ago, I realized he definitely does understand the words now, because he told me - while the tv was off - which animal went with each number in the song, all the way to 10!

If your child is obsessed with one particular vehicle, you may be disappointed that there's not more of it in the DVD, but what's great about this DVD is the wide range of action (""ways to move"", as they put it) that is represented: trains, planes, merry-go-rounds, slides, running, skipping, and more.  I think it would appeal to girls as well as boys.  Oh yes, and the opening song is ""The Wheels on the Bus"".  You can't go wrong with that one!!

This is one of the best toddler DVD's I have ever seen, and I highly recommend it.",1179100800,4,1921,4.337988826815643
8101364,4,B000CRZ2P4,My kids 3yrs and 20 months LOVE noodlebug.  This one in general keeps their attention.  Teaches different movements that the kids do to the music and the spanish words for them.  Catchy songs.  And when the dvd is coming to a close they have a calming song. It is based off of the Highlights magazine for kids.,1159833600,,310,4.385964912280702
8101365,2,B000CRZ2P4,"My kids love these Noodlebug dvds.  But they are both scratched and skip and lose their sound.  We've had them both for less than 6 months, my kids handle them no more than any other kids' dvds we have and these two are the only ones with problems.  It's frustrating.  Noodlebug is great.  The skipping and jumping of the dvd is not.",1144281600,4,333,4.306451612903226
