8109708,5,B000EHI2W2,The Digiview release of the Fleischer Studios Superman are excellent and on par with the Bosko/VCI release of the same set. It is my belief that these are in fact the same set just repackaged since the series is in the public domain I wouldn't put it past them especially considering one of the biggest complaints in the Bosko series was that they stamp the original release date on the frame at the start of the episode and hmm look at that the digiview does the same. Over all though is an excellent collection worth owning especially for the price.,1242345600,,551,4.52
