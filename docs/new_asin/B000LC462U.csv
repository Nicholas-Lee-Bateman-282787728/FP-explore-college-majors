I will someday. I love Suze Weinberg, she is the best teacher !
Thanks",1392163200,,138,4.148148148148148
8161061,4,B000LC462U,I purchased this tool to use as a birthday present. My friend is an avid crafter. She has used it and says that it works well. It melts the UTEE within the time it says and it is fairly easy to use. She was not happy with how difficult (and expensive) it was to find dyes to use with the melt art tool. She was happy to get it as a gift but not something that she would purchase on her own.,1341705600,2,390,3.768292682926829
8161062,5,B000LC462U,"THE lady is fantastic in this DVD. Suze is knowledgeable. She is easy to listen to and I totally enjoyed the processes, products, and her fantastic ideas. I highly recommend this DVD to any hobbiest.",1298851200,4,199,4.714285714285714
8161063,4,B000LC462U,An interesting starting point for this craft. I have purchased the goods for other areas of work - its all about your own style and developing your own ideas. Just try it!!,1258070400,2,172,4.40625

This DVD covers everything you want to know about using the Melting Pot and UTEE to do melt art. I bought this video before investing in Ranger's  product line to see if it would be something I'd like.

It covers the following projects: art transfers, suncatchers, faux dichroic glass, shrink plastic push pins, faux soldering, faux cloisonne, mold-n-pour stick pins, and beeswax on canvas. You need to have no prior knowledge of this type of craft in order to do the projects--they are at a beginner level.

The DVD ends with a special section of tips (cool ideas and variations), FAQ's (very helpful), and a gallery (of finished projects using demonstrated techniques).

This DVD definitely shows the versatility of the Melting Pot. The projects are quick, easy, and beautiful. They don't seem to use too many extra supplies, except of course the basic ones you need to do melt art, which are extensively covered.

Highly recommended.

8161065,4,B000LC462U,"I purchased this before getting any of the equipment to see if I was really interested in using the Melting Pot.  I knew I could resell it if I decided this craft wasn't for me.  I thoroughly enjoyed the video, and I'll be using it to coach me through some projects once I get the supplies to get started.  I hope to make some unique jewelry and card embellishments, and this video makes the techniques clear and ""do-able""",1174694400,13,422,4.384615384615385
8161066,5,B000LC462U,The Suze does a good job explaining the process of each project.  She details the material list.  Her instruction is easy to follow and she offers many tips of dos and don'ts and how to correct any problem areas.  The projects are fun.  The projects can get your creative juices going.  The DVD is great for beginners in the product line and a great reminder for those who have used the product in the past.  This is a good DVD to have in your library.,1174089600,14,452,4.258823529411765
