8066835,5,B0009UYK6G,"The Majesty and Glory is a 50 minute inspirational video. For anyone who has a love of the glory of God's creation, combined with wonderful orchestral music and vocal praise, this is a beautiful production, quite the best of anything like it that I have ever seen.
The visual part is quite outstanding, and worthily demonstrates the Majesty and Glory of God's created world, with its scenery, plants, animals and changing seasons, in a variety of places around the world. The arrangements of the 34 traditional hymns, spiritual songs, scriptures and music blend together with the visuals to give exhilarating praise and rejoicing, together with moving adoration. The music varies in pace and intensity and features rich choral settings. A truly faith building and soul enriching presentation. It gives a breathtaking visual dimension to a powerful personal worship experience. I purchased it first around ten years ago at a church book shop; later I bought a new copy from Amazon. I still play and enjoy it.  A great pity that it is not available in DVD format.",1406851200,,1061,4.994350282485875
