5046312,2,B0070EUHNY,"This is a low budget zombie/slasher film, shot at night...most likely in one night. The film opens up with promise as Mike shares a few lines of coke with his bodacious lady friend AFTER they had sex. People become fast moving flesh eating zombies after listening to a particular death metal song. The leader of the zombies is a slasher in a Nixon mask apparently borrowed from another film (""Horror House on Highway Five"", ""The Tripper""). He has more lives than Jason.

After a concert...you know the rest. There should have been a prequel to this film showing the slasher, years earlier. We really didn't care who was behind the mask because there was no character introduction. Besides there was only one guy big enough in the film to have been him anyway. The film needed to take time to develop character and a plot. The scenes grew boring as they tended to be long drawn out images of people on a computer, or people riding in a car, or simply a chase scene by people with limited zombie make-up.

There was a guy in a Mr. Bungle t-shirt, as this film seemed to have been made for band promotion. There are some attempts at crude humor such as when the cop says he likes his women like his scotch: ""17 years old and mixed with coke."" Seriously, who mixes 17 year old scotch with coke? Not in my house.

The film was written, directed, acted (Tony), produced, edited, special effects, camera operator, theme music composed by Todd Jason Cook.

5046313,1,B0070EUHNY,"Amazon gave me 7 days to watch this.  It took 7 minutes.  But don't waste your time or money.  Seriously.  There is no debate regarding the quality and entertainment value of this rental.

To make it easy, everything about this movie is sub-par.  No, that phrase isn't right.  What's way below sub-par?

When I say everything, I mean everything.  Acting, editing, directing, writing, lighting, music, sound, best boying, etc.

It's a no budget production that deserves no stars.  I feel okay giving it 1 star because, hey, despite the quality, these people made a full-length movie.  When's the last time you did that?",1346630400,2,618,4.893203883495145
5046314,5,B0070EUHNY,"I have been watching the movies of Todd Jason Cook for a while now and when I found out about Zombiefied, I was quite excited. My copy just came in today and I just finished watching it. Zombiefied totally rocked! I felt it was quite the unique film, mixing a zombie film with a slasher and it worked! I hope everyone gives Zombiefied a chance, it was so awesome!",1341014400,5,363,4.27536231884058

8507733,1,B0070EUHNY,"I can only assume that the people who gave this five stars actually saw a different movie.  I'm struggling with giving it one star.  At least if it were a book, you could burn it and toast a couple of marshmallows over it.  I pretty sure that it will either end up as a drink coaster, or a shotgun target.",1391990400,2,305,4.05
8507734,5,B0070EUHNY,"You can feel through the film how fun this movie was to make. You can tell everyone was having a blast. And you have a blast watching it. It's a bloody, original good time. And the DVD itself is full of an array of hidden easter eggs, making it a beyond satsifying purchase.",1384992000,,274,4.188679245283019

8507736,5,B0070EUHNY,"Todd Cook has done it again!! Independent horror films are hot these days and Todd hits the mark in this film. Anyone who knows his work will remember some of his low-budget gems like ""Evil Night"" or his well known classic ""Death Metal Zombies"" but Zombiefied is a much cleaner tighter film while still holding true to the 80's shot on video hey dey spirit. Done with a much bigger budget than Death Metal Zombies, Zombiefied generates tons of gore and action with great camera work and direction. Included are some familiar faces of Death Metal Zombies and Todd's earlier work. Also might wanna check out ""Infected"" the making of Zombiefied. Its a great behind the scenes look at independent film making. ""Zombiefied"" Todd's best work to date! Check it out!!!",1358294400,,760,4.809160305343512
8507737,4,B0070EUHNY,"Crazy low budget. Pretty good, It was worth it. They made do with what they had. They put something together.",1357776000,,109,4.5
8507738,3,B0070EUHNY,"I bought this movie to support a local director Todd Cook. I met him at a convention a few years ago. He's a good guy with a lot of enthusiasm for indie film.

The film has some great opening nudity. The shower scene is hot. I need this girl in one of my films.

It's a indie super low budget film. It is what it is. I respect the guy for the efforts and the film is entertaining.

At some points the film gets a little confusing as to what is going on. Also, going back to the building to see if the killer is still just hanging out there was a bit silly.  over all good indie, low budget stuff. It's what dreams are made of.",1355529600,,626,3.905511811023622

8507740,5,B0070EUHNY,Make sure that it is in stock or that you are willing to wait for it to be shipped.  It held up my order for over ten days. It is hard to find.  I gave it as a gift and they were pleased. This is NOT my kind of movie.,1353456000,,217,3.32
