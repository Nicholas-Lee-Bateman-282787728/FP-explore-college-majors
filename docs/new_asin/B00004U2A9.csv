They love it when winding down after a busy day at school 9 years later as it is so calming and soothing and delightful. When their tape finally wore out after all those years, I searched and happily found it at Amazon.  My twin nephews are so happy - thank you!",1299369600,,324,4.295081967213115
7923471,5,B00004U2A9,"The opening song, What A Wonderful World, sets the tone for this tender, lovely film, which is, from start to finish, a feast for the senses. Likely intended for younger audiences, this artfully-filmed movie is appropriate for all ages (from babies to centernarians). The species of animal parents & babies are myriad: bears, penguins, horses, otters, prairie dogs, lions, gorillas, hippos....

The film is accompanied entirely by music, with zero narration. Most of the songs are actually familiar lullabies, some purely instrumental, others sung by contemporary artists. All are well-done: sweet and soothing, never once interfering with but, rather, drawing you even further in to beauty and spirit of the unfolding imagery.

The songs are punctuated in-between with very brief, humorous animal-footage clips, lasting maybe 10 seconds, which have silly or cute sound effects. These clips are just the right length for a smile or chuckle, without detracting from the overall flow of the experience.

This film is an experience to behold, one that will enchant children and adults alike, leaving even the most hardened cynic to agree that this is, indeed, a wonderful world.",1197158400,2,1175,5.34054054054054

7923473,5,B00004U2A9,"I liked this video right away, but was worried when my son at first rejected it around 12 months. Now that he's 15 months, he really likes it. It is especially good for ""quiet time""--before naptime or bedtime, since it is a gentle video. Both the images and the music are beautiful.",1042416000,3,282,4.4423076923076925
7923474,5,B00004U2A9,"Nature Babies is a life saver!  I watch this video every day with my 5 month old daughter.  She is so fascinated at the footage of baby animals, that she just stares at the video intently for the whole half-hour!  The  music is great -- both upbeat and relaxing.  And the funny clips in between  scenes always bring a smile and somethimes even a giggle out of my  daughter.  And... I have to admit, I enjoy watching the video as much as my  daughter.  Unlike other videos geared towards young kids, this one is  interesting for parents too.  We make Nature Babies a part of our day  everyday.  I am going to buy the other video - Mozart Nature Symphonies --  too.",965001600,14,663,4.319672131147541
