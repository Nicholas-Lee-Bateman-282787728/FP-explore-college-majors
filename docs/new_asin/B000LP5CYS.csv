8162514,5,B000LP5CYS,We are hoping to teach our grandson to play golf.  He is four years old so he will have to learn each concept slowly and methodically.  The initial concepts are safety and parts of the club and we are still working on those points.  The instruction will be useful as he matures and begins to understand the game.,1490832000,,312,4.344827586206897

8162521,5,B000LP5CYS,"My 2 year old grandson has his own set of real golf clubs -- driver, wedge and putter.  He goes to the driving range.  He practices in sand traps and also on the putting green.  He has learned so much from this dvd.  It really has been the best kids golf dvd I have found.  It not only goes through the basics of swings, stance, exercise but also safety and courtesy.  If you have a child who is very interested in golf this dvd would be helpful.",1369180800,5,446,4.068965517241379
8162522,5,B000LP5CYS,"We bought this video for our 4 year old grandson, who is just fascinated with golf, and he sat through the whole show twice - think that says enough - it is a nice show and keeps the little ones interested - teaches them more than golf as it show them how to act on the course - worth the money if you have a little one interested in the sport.  Me personally I do not golf, but the show was enjoyable as I watched it through my grandson's eyes.",1275696000,3,445,3.9444444444444446
