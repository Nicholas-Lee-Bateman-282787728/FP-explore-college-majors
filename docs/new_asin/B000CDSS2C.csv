2459665,3,B000CDSS2C,"Some people say, ""Funerals are for the living.""  This documentary tries to add, ""Cemeteries should be for the living.""  This work shows many ways in which the living show their respects for or fascination with the dead.  You see baseballs placed near the graves of league players.  There are Stars of David for deceased Jewish individuals and tombstones written in Chinese for deceased Chinese.  They show veterans honoring the war dead.  One Rockefeller gave out many dimes, so living persons place dimes on his grave.

This work is diverse in terms of the dead and the living.  For example, the first Black mayor of Atlanta is buried in the same cemetery as some Confederate soldiers.  The work is diverse in terms of geography.  However, they only show a rural grave at the very end, unlike the mostly suburban and big city graves with which they begin.  I enjoyed the inclusive message here, however, historically many a cemetery was rigidly divided based upon race and class.

You will see no visitors crying here.  The goal of the work is to demystify burial grounds.  However, for some that is not radical.  Many know that these areas can be sites of learning.  It's why we study pyramids for example.  Those who celebrate the Day of the Dead are not afraid of death as others are.  The documentary makers may think they are being more revolutionary than they actually are.  Plus, the narrator has an annoying voice.",1180656000,6,1423,4.7818930041152266

Leave it to Rick Sebak to create a folksy, uplifting look at cemeteries and how beautiful some of them actually are (A view I confess I've always had!). The histories and presentations of some of the older cemeteries are really interesting and informative. I would recommend this to anyone.",1520812800,,335,4.793103448275862
8097984,5,B000CDSS2C,"Informative and entertaining.  We watch this in class before we read ""The Graveyard Book"" to understand how different cemeteries can be.  Students always like how cemeteries vary in different states and how they compare to cemeteries they have been to.  Appropriate to watch with middle school to high-school students around Halloween, or with any spooky unit.  It is easily divided up into two class periods and is not scary.",1475020800,,426,5.130434782608695
8097985,4,B000CDSS2C,My friends & I watched  'A Cemetery Special' and thought it was an interesting story. We enjoyed it and it was something different.,1441584000,,131,4.695652173913044

8097987,5,B000CDSS2C,I had seen this documentary on Netflix and had to see it. It's really interesting and not morbid at all. Well the listing ended on Netflix and I still wanted to watch it again. So I looked on here and ordered it. The documentary is well made and interesting. The movie was shipped fast and in excellent condition. I would order a movie from this store again. I was well pleased.,1401321600,,378,4.338028169014085
8097988,5,B000CDSS2C,"I got a bunch of cemetery DVD's last year for Christmas, as I have a cemetery photography business that goes by the name of ""Graveyard Walker"", and also I work locally in cemetery preservation, so these were all very entertaining and appropriate for me!! :D",1381190400,,257,4.733333333333333
8097989,4,B000CDSS2C,This is one dvd about how cemetaries in America are appreciated and utalized.  The narrator Rick Sebak presents a celebration of people who are fondly remembered as well as how these people are happily memorialized today.  Also architectural styles represented in this dvd are diverse as well as beautiful .,1352851200,3,307,5.12
8097990,5,B000CDSS2C,"This item was bought as a gift and was well received, but I cannot give a review further than that because I never watched the film.",1331596800,,132,4.115384615384615
8097991,5,B000CDSS2C,"""Rick Sebak brings his personal touch to a tour of the many interesting, historical and quirky cemeteries across the country, from the burial grounds of the famous to the unmarked graves of soldiers."" PBS",1215907200,,204,5.029411764705882
8097992,3,B000CDSS2C,"This one hour ""special"" that originally aired on PBS in 2005 is adequately produced and gives the viewer some interesting information about the history of ""burying grounds"" in the US.  Beautiful and historic cemeteries including Mt. Auburn in Boston, Oakland in Atlanta and Lakeview in Cleveland are given special prominence.  An unusual cemetery in Vermont containing many beautiful granite monuments made from native stone is also one of the more memorable features.  Cemeteries in suburban San Francisco, Waterloo, New York, Key West, Florida and Fairbanks, Alaska are included.  This is not a sad, morbid or spooky film at all and it even has touches of humor.  Encouragement of preservation of cemeteries for their beauty, history and cultural significance is a major theme as is the advantages of using these often lovely places for activities far removed from funerals.",1187222400,12,876,5.318840579710145
