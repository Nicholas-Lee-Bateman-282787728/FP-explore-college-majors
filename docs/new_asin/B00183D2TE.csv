3411387,5,B00183D2TE,"After watching this video, one should ask ""What's my excuse for not doing what I know needs to be done.""  These is No Excuse!  This young man's zest for life is inspiring to say the least.  My heart was greatly touched by his testimony.",1221436800,6,236,4.318181818181818
3411388,5,B00183D2TE,"So I really have NOT seen the product, but I'm ordering it!  I heard/saw the man at church today.  He is compelling and an inspiration, sincere, and funny, and a wonderful man.  His message especially for teens who think that they can't get themselves back up.",1220140800,,260,4.608695652173913
3411393,5,B00183D2TE,"It's hard to put into words the impact that this video can have on any human soul that is down on life.  Vujicic has a story that is truly unique among the billions of us on this planet, and yet he can see the depth of the purpose of his life and give thanks to God for every breath he takes, instead of plunging into the depths of despair.  How can we not be thankful for all that God has given us after watching this amazing man's story?!!!  I highly recommend that every tween and up see this DVD!",1324771200,4,500,4.03030303030303
3411394,5,B00183D2TE,"Nick is living proof that we are not victims of our circumstances.  We choose what we become.  Many people try to blame their bad choices or dysfunctional lives on the way they were born or on bad things that have happened to them in their life. Psychology says that ""Who we are is the some total of the events that have happened to us in our lives.""  But Nick's life proves that this statement is not  true.  Nick's life proves that we choose who we become and what we do, not our circumstances. It's about who we are, not what has happened to us.  Many people try excuse what they have become by saying, I was born this way, or I am this way because bad things happened to me.  Nick eliminates those excuses.  Nick's life, success and attitude overwhelmingly demonstrate that you have the choice to be a victim of your circumstance or victorious over your circumstance.  I call Nick the ""Excuse Eliminator"". Another name for this video could be, ""No more excuse to fail"".",1319846400,5,973,4.482954545454546

3411399,5,B00183D2TE,"And You Think You Have Problems?
Nick Vujicic ""Nick"", I wouldn't embarass mayself trying to pronounce his last name, is a phenomenon.  This wonderful individual doesn't just talk a good life, he lives it.  He has tapped into the power of Christian values and  positive thinking to excel in life.  This man helps many other people, wait, did I say he helps others?  Who is helping him?  This guy travels all over the world inspiring youth mainly, but I am way beyond my youth, and I am amazed.  You must obtain a copy of his dvd's and show them to yourself, your family, and large groups.  His positive outlook is something we desperately need at this time.  I highly recommend ""Life Without Limbs, From No Limbs to No Limits"".",1277424000,,726,4.565891472868217
