6492957,5,B00LN8782G,Compelling movie of what happens to a family trying to protect loved ones from tragedy. A real movie with a real story. Had to go see it twice because I couldn't stop thinking about it. A first movie for the writer/actor/producer and director. Great job by all.,1414886400,3,261,4.574468085106383
6492958,3,B00LN8782G,Interesting film. Makes you think about life and how precious each moment is with our loved ones.,1414627200,,97,4.764705882352941
6492959,5,B00LN8782G,"A beautifully acted, compelling story. I'm confident the family dynamic will be familiar to most of us (which family member are you?). A second viewing is recommended in order to catch all the clues you missed the first time. You'll see this writer and director again, for sure!",1414540800,,278,4.8125
6492960,4,B00LN8782G,"I watched AFTER without any knowledge of it. The first time I watched it, I almost did myself a disservice by taking it at its surface thinking, the actors were all really good but okay... When I watched it again with my wife, not only did the film hit me significantly deeper but  something became very clear...

It's not your typical film and thank god for that. It's nice to have that every once and while.",1414540800,2,409,4.368421052631579
6492961,3,B00LN8782G,"Well, this film is very well-made, with powerful performances, but the family secret is totally unrealistic; I don't see how the family could keep up their charade ad infinitum - very silly.",1414195200,,190,4.96875
6492962,5,B00LN8782G,I loved it. I laughed. I cried. About 15 family and friends ordered the dvd after watching it.,1414195200,,94,4.277777777777778
6492963,5,B00LN8782G,I saw a review on this that said it was one of the best films they've reviewed all year.  I could not agree more. I can't really get into the plot as that would ruin it but it is a must watch and I won't be surprised if it becomes one of those classic films that gave insight to a horrible time in this country.,1413331200,2,311,3.7846153846153845
