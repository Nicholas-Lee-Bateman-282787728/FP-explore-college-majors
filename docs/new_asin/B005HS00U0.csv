4703354,5,B005HS00U0,"As a long time Hollies fan I was very happy to see them finally getting the attention they deserve. It took much too long for them to be inducted into the Hall of Fame.
Most of us in the US got our first taste of Hollies with the song ""Look Through Any Window"". From the opening riff that Tony Hicks played and the harmonies that soon followed I realized they were something special. As a guitarist I found Tony Hicks'
guitar playing to be very wonderful and sometimes not to easy to figure out, although
much of it sounded simple enough. The DVD shows us how he did his stuff and how the Hollies developed their ""Everly Brothers with a third part"" harmonies. A high point, for me, was seeing Tony Hicks and Graham Nash doing the double solo in ""Bus Stop"", and Alan Clarke, Tony Hicks and Graham Nash doing the vocals for ""On a Carousel"".
A must have for any Hollies fan for sure!",1317945600,,880,4.307228915662651
4703355,5,B005HS00U0,"Having just watched this video all the way through I was going to call it the ""gold standard"" for musical history videos till I noticed someone else already had (and had done a very good job of reviewing the video themselves).  I nearly didn't bother reviewing it then till noticing another review panning this same video as not going far enough.  I am thus writing my own review suggesting that one needs to review what is here rather than what is not - and boy, what is here is outstanding stuff.  Killer live vocals showing what talented singers the Hollies were, inciteful commentary from the band members about their history (both positive and negative) and thankfully a general feeling of love or at least respect for each other.  Coincidentally reading Geoff Emerick's book of recording the Beatles (Here, There & Everywhere) at the same time, it was perfect timing to see the EMI recording facility so many of the classic records of our youth were made in - this is seen during the sessions for ""On A Carousel"" in the video. After buying many music DVDs I feel let down and typically file them away never to be seen again - not so with this one that will be in constant rotation for some time.  Not only is the video excellent, but so is the insert booklet.  At a time when most inserts are either 1 page or non-existent, the producers include an excellent multi-page Ben Fong-Torres history of the band and some nifty graphics to accompany it. Thanks guys and hopefully there will be more like this (Searchers, Kinks, Paul Revere & The Raiders?)",1317772800,3,1554,4.632727272727273
4703356,1,B005HS00U0,"The clips of Wings, Sorry Suzanne & Their complete rehearsal of On a Carousel along with a collage of home movies on King Midas, is the only aspect of this dvd that makes it worthwhile. My Gripes are the inclusion of clips that have already been released previosly on such compilations as The Dutch Collection & a beat club dvd. He Aint Heavy,had already been used on the Dutch Collection, as well as Dear Eloise and I'm Alive. Not to Mention Bus Stop. Come On People!!!! The company interspersed a couple snippets over the documentary of Graham and Allan in B&W standing beside each other, appearing to mime a song in front of a stone wall. Where is that video? Which i assume could be the promo for their song ""Fred and Charlie""? Instead of using the same Bus Stop Clip, the 1966 totp clip would've been a treasure to have in pristine quality! Maybe even Butterfly or Dear Eloise from their stint on the Mike Douglas Show in 1967. Very Disappointing Dvd Overall, and despite a few never before released clips, They rehashed too much footage that has already been seen. Let the Vaults Open and Why Don't You guys utilize footage that is still in the can????? Even Listen to me was already on the Dutch Collection Disc. Why??? WHY???? Can't Give This Rehash Job One Thumb Up!!! Sorry Job",1317772800,7,1287,4.551724137931035
4703357,4,B005HS00U0,"Just received my copy in the mail today of this DVD and as I watch the career of the Hollies pass by I notice the soundtrack of my life passing by as well.  Talk about being at the right place at the right time, imagine being at Abby Road studio and the Beatles recording right down the hall...it must have been something in the water or maybe it was the monogram toilet tissue at EMI, I don't know but the songs that followed had me personally singing them in the bathroom, cars and street corners, maybe not as well as the Hollies did but I had a shot of insperation in my own life from the music coming across the big pond.

All that said I feel a little short changed here because of Allan's statement regarding the Hollies ending after ""The Air That I Breath"" a song I felt was better suited for a band like Air Supply than the greatness of the Hollies and also the fluffing over of Terry Sylvester, not to mention the way he was treated at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame dinner much like second hand news. Sure he was drunk but who there wasn't. Don't get me wrong I'm a big Graham Nash fan, but what big shoes Terry had to fill and really right off the bat he filled them well. I have all the CD's that are written off here by Allan. My favorite and the LP that my wife and I fell in love to ""The Hollies Sing Buddy Holly"" was sadly over looked at that point in their career and this DVD. I was so obsessed with that LP and how well crafted it was as well as the other LP made up to that point....BTW...Bobby is one of the best drummers out there and Tony's guitar is second to none, but please note that the currently touring band isn't the Hollies...you don't have the Hollies without Allan's voice up front.

My personel Hollies meeting were when the Hollies came to the US without Alan Clark. I was working at Tower Records Sunset and Bobby came in and I asked him ""where's Allan""  he turned away and didn't give me an answer....I thought ""oh well""...Next I was at the Beverly Center in the early 80's and I ran into Graham with his wife Susan and family, his son Jackson was only ten. I asked Graham when the Hollies would be available on CD because there were very few CD's available at that time and explained to him how I knew how he felt about CS&N but that there were a lot of fans out there that still loved the Hollies he said that he would look into it and told me in the nicest way that this was a family day, I thanked him for his time and said ""see ya""....OH WELL :)

Love the Hollies and always will and Thank You for this wonderful DVD, it's nice to have all of these performances in one place instead of roaming through youtube looking for them one at a time.

4703358,5,B005HS00U0,"I also attended the premiere on September 22, 2011, in Santa Monica.  What a night!  What a great documentary!

This Reelin' in the Years production, the fifth in their British Invasion series, is phenomenal. First of all, the sound is magnificent. Second, the interviews with Graham, Allan, Tony and Bobby are illuminating. Third, there is unseen footage that is just exceptional.

(Oh, there are fourth, fifth, etc but that can get a bit stale. Let me just babble on.)

The film chronicles the Hollies from 1963-1975 -- their prime years, including the post-Nash big pop hit stuff. It begins with Graham and Allan talking about how them met as small children and sharing their love of singing. There is a terrific film snippet of Allan and Graham singing on stage as the Two Teens, one of their stage incarnations in the 50s in Manchester.

It goes pretty quickly into the genesis of the Hollies in Manchester in 1962, with the eventual hitmaking lineup of Clarke, Nash, Tony Hicks on lead guitar, Bobby Elliott on drums, and Eric Haydock on 6-string electric bass. The other personnel changes were of course discussed (especially the departure of Nash), but including Haydock's replacement, Bernie Calvert, and the addition of Terry Sylvester.

Bits and pieces of footage shot at Abbey Road by Granada Television when the Hollies were recording ""On a Carousel"" have been seen previously. This documentary uses the complete footage for the first time. It's stunning. We see the band members recording their parts---Nash singing lead a cappella, the wonderful 3-part harmony, Hicks laying down his lead guitar. After each of the 22 complete performances that are included in this film, the crowd applauded, but probably not as loudly or as enthusiastically as after we were treated to this rare footage.

The Hollies' road manager, Rod Shields, took lots of home movies of the band, and some of those reels are used in the production, most notably for visuals for ""King Midas in Reverse,"" for which a proper promo film was never made. We see the Hollies in then Yugoslavia, Japan, and in other playful settings that capture their youth, enthusiasm and charm.

The four Hollies interviewed for the documentary take time to talk about their music, what it was like to record at Abbey Road, and the debt they owe their late producer, Ron Richards, for helping them to become a chart-topping band in the 60s and 70s.

One of the best segments was during a Hicks interview, where he showed how he came up with the banjo part of Stop! Stop!Stop! Then, as Bobby continues the story, he tells us Tony had never played banjo before! Their love of experimentation and not wanting to be bored with their music led to these wonderful innovations.

The British Invasion series has had rave reviews (other titles include Dusty Springfield and Herman's Hermits) and this Hollies edition is certain to continue the praise for Reelin' in the Years. Its principal producer, David Peck, was on hand at the premiere for the post-screening discussion, along with Graham Nash and Allan Clarke. He spoke of his joy in being able to make this documentary and how much he loves the Hollies' music. It is indeed a labor of love.

I give this DVD my highest recommendation.  It's a must-buy for any Hollies fan or anyone who treasures the finest of British Invasion music.",1317600000,3,3346,4.880070546737214
4703359,5,B005HS00U0,"I was fortunate to attend the premiere of ""Look Through Any Window"" at the Aero in Santa Monica. What an excellent film! I have been a hard-core Hollie fan for the past couple years and previously a fringe fan (knew the hits but not much else.) The clarity and sound of this film is pristine. David Peck and all of his crew are top notch. The ""On A Carousel"" footage brought me to tears. Hearing those harmonies isolated at Abbey Road and seeing Clarke, Hicks, and Nash singing 'round the mike was a slice of heaven on earth. The interviews with the band are insightful and fun. Most hardcore fans know the Hollies were fun and had great humour in spades, and it shows on this DVD. It also shows that they were excellent musicians, especially Tony's masterful guitar work and Bobby's kick-butt drumming! They could rock your socks off live, something that most people don't know, but now the secret is out and it's about time!

 If you love the british invasion and truly GREAT 60's pop, do yourself a favor and buy this now. It's a bargain and will pay you back with interest!",1317254400,2,1077,4.489795918367347
4703360,5,B005HS00U0,"Every one (yes, EVERY one) of the 36+ DVDs I've seen (and reviewed) from Reelin' in the Years productions (including four Jazz Icons sets, a few American Folk Blues Festival volumes, the Motown Greats, Stax Story and the sole Folk Icons DVD of Pete Seeger) have been superb! Last year Producers David Peck, Phil Galloway, `Tom Gulotta and Rob Bowman produced a four volume set called The British Invasion. Another gem (see my review on Amazon)! Now they have added to the BI series with this DVD on the career of The Hollies (known to younger fans as a seminal 1960s pop group, and to younger fans as the group that started Graham Nash's career).

As with the other volumes in the BI series, Peck and his cohorts set out to find and license the best quality prints of performances by the band, and then sent Bowman out to do contemporary interviews with the band members, which form the fabric of the documentary, by weaving the interviews (all done in 2010) with the 22 COMPLETE performances. The interviews were done with Nash, lead vocalist Allan Clarke (who was Nash's best friend from the age of six!), guitarist Tony Hicks and drummer Bobby Elliott. (Though the band consisted of five members, the bassist changed a few times and none of those musicians were interviewed.).

The interviews are insightful and honest and you'll learn a lot from them (along with some additional facts in Ben Fong-Torres' essay in the 12-page booklet inserted in the package. (Another standard for RITY releases.)

Many of the performances are probably being seen by fans for the first time. While a couple are from Brit and US TV (""This Is Tom Jones"", ""The New Music Express Winners Concert"") the majority are from oddball places like The Split Festival (in Croatia!) and shows titled ""Rooster"" and ""supersonic"". A few are in Black and white but MOST are in glorious color - with not a speck of dust or scratch to be seen.

The dates in the title might be a bit misleading as the performances are generally from the year that the songs were hits. However the last Hollies hit was in 1974 with ""The Air That I Breathe"" (Nash was gone by then) and yet it is preceded here by a 1975 performance (from the British TV show ""Supersonic"") of ""Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress"" which was released in 1972.

The ""feature film"" runs just over two hours and 53 minutes of that is due to the complete performances. But there is a ""Bonus Feature"" option that lets you play just the performances - either individually or as ""play all"". These guys thought of everyone when they put this package together.

The Reelin' in the Years productions have been released by various video companies over the years. This volume comes from Eagle Rock Entertainment, which - I'm told - will be releasing the FIFTH set of Jazz Icons DVDs this fall. Obviously, I'm one fan of RITY that's anxious to see that.

With a very reasonable list price of $14.98 this Hollies DVD is a MUST HAVE for Hollies fans. And it's a great way to share the music of this period with the younger generation who have heard of the British Invasion but only know the Beatles, The Stones and The Who.

4703361,5,B005HS00U0,"I also saw the preview at the Aero in Santa Monica and, I must say, I've never seen this kind of thing done any better.  The performances are COMPLETE (no talking heads talking over them) and the interview segments with Clarke, Nash, Hicks and Elliot are excellent.

I was surprised to see so much LIVE footage of the Hollies.  I've always liked the Hollies but I've tended to underrate them a bit in the midst of their formidible peers.  This film changed my mind.  The group was an incredible live act.  Tony Hicks is an excellent guitarist (something I never paid much attention to before) and Bobby Elliot is a powerful and creative drummer (ditto).  The vocals are, of course, peerless.

If you are British Invasion fan, you will LOVE this film and your respect and admiration for the Hollies will grow astronomically (as mine did).",1316822400,29,837,4.684931506849315
4703362,5,B005HS00U0,"I saw this film last night, 9/22/11, at a local L.A. theater.  It was followed by a Q&A with Graham Nash, Alan Clarke, the film's producer/director David Peck and the film's interviewer, Rob Bowman.

As Peck explained, the hallmark of his work is the inclusion of full tunes and this film is no exception.  It features over 20 full songs; some are from lip-synched perfs while many are live from various TV shows.

The interviews with Nash, Clarke, Hicks and Elliot were all full of details.

If you're remotely a fan of this band, get this DVD.  And if you're looking for the best CD compilation of theirs, get the Raven label release.  It's an Aussie import and the sound is the best.",1316736000,70,686,4.528455284552845

4703380,4,B005HS00U0,"The DVD is very good history of the band and the video quality is great.  Having said that, it really is heavily slanted towards Graham Nash. Don't get me wrong - I am a Graham Nash fan but the history goes through 1975.  The Hollies had their greatest commercial success in the USA after Graham left and was replaced by Terry Sylvester.  Terry is virtually ignored and not even interviewed.  When Allan Clarke left to pursue a solo career, it was Terry who sang lead on Long Cool Woman during the US tour.

Lots of great videos of their hit singles. On A Carousel being filmed live at Abbey Road studios is stunning. I never knew that the Hollies were from Great Britain. Not much was made of them in the US. They deserved more than what they got.

4703385,5,B005HS00U0,"Growing up the music landscape had change several times over The British Invasion wasn't even a blip on the radar screen all that was left at this particular time was The Rolling Stones and The Who with any consistency. The Beatles had already cemented their legacy and even though they had broken up many years earlier their music was deeply and freshly rooted into the world's foundation  so much so that they felt like they were still together a current band. that never called it quits. I always loved Rock ""n"" Roll and Metal music ever since I was a kid and as a young kid I saw this commercial on tv about Casey Kasem and his covering of The British Invasion Bands there were video clips live and non live performances of these amazing rock groups of yesteryear performing their biggest hits I was basically locked in Loving every minute of it. One of the clips that were shown was Carrie Ann, On A Carousel, and Sorry Suzanne by The Hollies talking about Graham Nash's departure and Terry Sylvester's entry to the group and how it changed the dynamic of the group's harmonies. So from that moment on I wanted to go back and discover all these great Rock Bands that came before and paved the way for the current bands that we all love today. This DVD is awesome if you love Rock ""N"" Roll and The Hollies I suggest getting this DVD it's very insightful, blissfully entertaining it runs a little over two hours but doesn't feel like it at all. The only knocks I have on it is I thought they should have interviewed Eric Haydock, Bernie Calvert, and Terry Sylvester for this rocumentary and I thought it should have covered all the way to the present where they could have shorten that part a bit so your not feeling like your watching a version of Gone With The Wind as far as length goes. Other than that I love it. It's a great buy I've watched it several times already. Truly one of the greatest Rock Bands of all time.  Buy it pop it in and enjoy.",1459382400,3,1955,4.397790055248619

4703387,5,B005HS00U0,"I've always loved the Hollies but you don't really find much product for them, compared to the other more obvious British Invasion bands (Beatles, Stones, Kinks, Who). I was pleasantly surprised to find this DVD on Amazon and I ordered it based on other positive reviews. All I can say is WOW, it's a Hollies goldmine!

It shows the whole history of the band told via recent interviews with members, interspersed with live footage (including some TV lip-syncing). You have the options of just playing all the live footage, and there's a LOT of songs, all the biggest hits and played in their entirety. The whole program is well over 2 hours and it's very interesting. A lot of care has gone into this product... The film is well edited, the interview comments are very thoughtful and well articulated, and the remastered video and sound quality are also very good, especially considering the age of the footage. The company that makes this DVD has a proven track record of making great music related DVD's (I own some of their Jazz Icons DVD's and every one is great).

The Hollies as a live band sound pretty well the same as on their records, although many records used double tracking as well, so they're really a great band... great harmonies, really interesting bass, lead guitar and drumming as well. There's footage of them recording at Abbey Road Studios, and some songs even have an explanation and demonstration of the lead guitar or drum parts before seeing the old live footage. Also cool for musicians is seeing all the old vintage gear they used.

Great live performances, promo film clips, and interviews with Allan Clarke, Graham Nash, Tony Hicks, and Bobby Elliott.

4703436,5,B005HS00U0,"The Hollies: Look Through Any Windows is an amazing documentary.  It features really good interviews in tremendous detail focusing on the important classic period of the bands history.  Nearly every one of their hits is discussed in detail, though I don't remember any mention of ""Pay You Back With Interest"" one of the Hollies all-time best songs in my opinion (though understandably not one of their very biggest hits- never heard it on the radio before).

I think it's funny I thought the lyrics to ""Carrie Anne"" were well, about a girl who... let's just say isn't very nice!  A girl who's been around the block a few times.  But then later on the band goes on to say the Hollies were the type of band parents would allow their daughters to bring home so perhaps I'm just interpreting the lyrics differently than the way they're intended.  I thought ""Long Cool Woman In a Black Dress"" had the same meaning too.  You never know I guess!

What I find especially awesome is how two of the band members met- one of them was the new boy in the school and he just so happened to sit beside what would become the other member of the band after the two hit off a great instantaneous friendship.  Imagine if the teacher told him to sit in another part of the classroom or even worse, he was placed in a different classroom?  Other legendary bands like Black Sabbath have similar stories- if the members just so happened to not show up during one particular occasion after reading a sign outside a building window they probably never would've formed.  Just amazing how one twist of fate changes everything!

Graham Nash says something interesting.  He said that when he left for America to explore other options (yeah you know what those other options were!  I can't pull a fast one over on you guys- Crosby, Stills & Nash) he found it amazing the Hollies would go on to make a number one hit and album with ""He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother"".  I often wonder what band members are thinking when they split from a group but the group continues to pump out hits.  It's the same situation with 10cc and ""The Things We Do For Love"".  I bet they're probably thinking ""Ah shucks!  That song could've been ours!""  haha.

Speaking of ""He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother"" I was anticipating the band members describing the songs meaning.  I think it's about no soldier leaving his buddy behind in war but I can't be totally sure.  Glad the band touches upon ""The Air That I Breathe"", one of the greatest love songs ever (though some disagree and call it overly sappy and needlessly orchestrated- I don't agree with that nonsense though!)  Wish they would've covered ""Bus Stop"" in greater detail which HAS to be the one Hollies song most people recognize and love.

Overall great documentary.  They detail several songs and show old concert footage of nearly completed songs, and I love how the band members admit they had a unique harmony style with tons of personality which brought a smile to my face.  Sometimes you just don't know if bands realize how good they are!  These guys recognize their talents.  Did they make some mistakes during that one singing performance of ""Carrie Anne"" I wonder?  They sort of missed the final verse line before the chorus comes back, haha.  Oh well.  I LOVE the Hollies!  Gotta watch this!",1415664000,,3308,4.611301369863014

4703450,5,B005HS00U0,"Lillian Roxon, in her ""Rock Encyclopedia"" of 1969, called the Hollies ""the group's group"".  This video history bears that out.  The Hollies simply produced some of the most infectious and upbeat music created during the ""Beat Era"" ( I think the group also authored a book called ""How to Run a Beat Group""...seriously.)

The Hollies' early hits were all beautifully-crafted three minute rushes of harmony and optimism, delivered in a breathless, brimming with energy style... more effervescent than the Beatles.

The gratifying thing that comes through in this package, with running commentary by four integral members of the band, is that they were all very intelligent people.  They succeeded for a reason.  The video performances also give a keen insight as to why the group hit an impasse in 1968, and why Graham Nash left the band.  As I remember the days when I was glued to the radio, listening to those hits, I thought the Hollies peaked with ""On A Carousel"" in 1967.  It was their most daring arrangement, with Tony Hicks contributing a guitar lick that verged on real ""heaviness"".  With Cream and Hendrix on the radio, and The Band and the Byrds ready to steer away from psychedelia, Rock was growing up quickly.

And the Hollies couldn't quite make it out of adolescence.  ""We were going nowhere"", Allan Clarke says in the film. ""We knew we couldn't be the Beatles.""  What the videos show is that in 1968, the group was adding a bit of self-conscious schtick to its performances.  During ""Carrie-Anne"" they mugged when Tony Hicks did his solo vocal, and when the taped steel drums came in, they mimed as if the effect had dropped out of their trousers like a rubber ball.  It was clever, but also a sad indication of the group's capitulation to lounge-style entertainment.  Soon, they would release the bizarre ""Words and Music by Bob Dylan"" album.

Make no mistake, they were still a good band.  Any band with a nucleus of Clarke (great lead singer), Hicks (good to great guitarist), and Elliott (great drummer) was always worth listening to.  And they stayed good ---and even released a terrific album, ""Romany"", something that previously had eluded them--- when Clarke left the band and was replaced by Mikael Rickfors.  But that is beyond the scope of this film.

In this video, you get to see the contributions of each key member to the Hollies' early sound.  You see the mechanics behind Elliott's exceptional drumming, and the inventiveness of the stellar accompaniments of Tony Hicks on guitar, twelve-string guitar, and banjo... and you see how they put together those seamless harmonies.

Any Hollies fan also knows that the band produced a lot of treasurable B-sides and album tracks, things like ""(I Get)So Lonely"", ""Don't Run and Hide"", ""Tell Me To My Face"", ""Rain on the Window"", ""Schoolgirl"", ""Man With No Expression"", and on and on... only ""Wings"" is featured as part of this film.  And other significant hits like ""Yes I Will"", and ""Pay You Back With Interest""  could easily have been included, but were bypassed.

Still, this video is a wonderful affirmation of the talents of this beat group 'par excellence'... a group I still listen to, long after I gave up on Crosby, Stills and Nash.

P.S.  I agree with what Nash said in this documentary, that the Hollies were a conscientiously good live band (although they could be a little sloppy.)  So, where are the BBC sessions?  Given that the Hollies were nearly as popular as the Beatles in Britain, the BBC must have recorded them quite a lot.  I think they merit a release or two.",1396656000,2,3559,4.815485996705107

4703486,5,B005HS00U0,"The Hollies tell their story in music and words. Most of the performances are from the Clarke, Hicks and  Nash years. I think too much praise has been given to the producers of this DVD for supposedly including rare and good quality footage. True, the film clips have been cleaned up, but I am not impressed. Most of the footage in the DVD series comes from obscure but actually not that rare TV shows like the German ""Beat Beat Beat"", ""Beat Club"", Australian, Scandinavian and US tours, and even more obscure British Poll Winners concerts. At the same time you had high quality shows like the ""Ed Sullivan Show"", ""Ready Steady Go"" and ""Top of the Pops"". Why weren't any of these performances included in this British Invasion series? It seems the producers of the DVD series cut corners, they took cheap footage, cleaned it up a bit and somehow still created a worthwhile product.
In the end it is all about the Hollies. I can't think of any other band with such great harmonies. Maybe the Mamas and Papas, but the Hollies were around for much longer and had many more great records. Allan Clarke, Graham Nash and Tony Hicks created the distinctive Hollies harmonies. Tony is a fantastic guitarist to boot, and Bernie Calvert the drummer is a league on his own. Most of the great hits are included and are uncut. See and hear for yourself.

This is a terrific film--the interviews are fascinating, both for the details about the songs and for the way the band members give each other so much credit.  Kudos to the producers for including complete, uninterrupted song clips, most of which are actually live, and some of which--like the title tune--are absolutely thrilling to watch and validate my claim that Bobby Elliot was the best drummer in the history of rock.

The last section, covering the period after Nash left, is extremely moving--the end of the Hollies as a pop powerhouse coincided with the end of the sixties, and an inescapable aura of sadness permeates not only the interviews but the videos as well.",1346544000,,895,4.9072847682119205

The interviews with the band members are really interesting, and most of the 22 songs are shown in their entirety. There can't have been a better live group back then than The Hollies.

Most of the clips are not lip synched and in these the band really shines. The clips within the film itself are presented in their entirety with no intrusion of bothersome narration... and each is self-standing in the bonus section.

Second, the band members speak at great length and considerable intelligence about the inner workings and business of the band... a noticeable step up from most of these films.

Third... I won't say the film reminds one of how great the Hollie's music was, because I'd guess anyone purchasing the DVD hasn't forgotten. What it does bring home is what a great instrumental band they were, above and beyond the vocals and harmonies.

All in all a tremendous pleasure to watch... and now I'm off to order the other DVDs in the series... based on this one's overall excellence.",1328227200,,1218,4.753554502369668

""The HOLLIES: Look Through Any Window 1963-1975"" is a great look at one of the most under-rated groups in rock history.  This is in spite of considerable chart success and some noted creativity in the studio and their careers.  Still, the number one thing that I get from this video (and it's still the most obvious as it always was) is that the HOLLIES had one of the best harmonies of any group in any time and genre of music. I could go on and on about every song and interview on the video, but I don't have the time.  If you value classic rock 'n' roll and exquisite harmonies, buy this video.

Every Hollies fan knows its the Graham and Alan show but the reason I couldn't dock this is because it shows the brilliance of Tony Hicks and Bobby Elliott in the process of making their records.  One of the most pleasing points to this DVD is seeing Elliot work his magic in the studio and Tonys guitar work on Stop, Stop, Stop and everything else.  The interviews are awesome and I would have to say this is one of the best DVDs I have in my collection and will watch over and over again.  The sad part is the lack of interviews with Mike Rikfors or Terry Sylvester!  Its criminal that Terry is not here on this DVD to share his knowledge and participation in this group.  When Graham Nash left Terry continued and did a darn good job of filling in for Mr Nash.  I guess after what went on at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame there may be some bad blood I don't know.  If you are not a Hollies fan scoop this up and listen to the brilliant harmonies and how all of these songs became timeless.  If you are a Hollies fan enjoy but for those who are Terry Sylvester fans or want to know more about Mike Rickfors forget it.  Still its a great buy.",1326931200,4,1205,4.089361702127659

This retrospect is great to watch if you like them at ALL.  Before each video there is introduction and commentary by the Hollies  mostly Allan Clark and Graham Nash  and is all VERY interesting.
The quality of the videos is Pretty damn good considering the years and the songs still sound wonderfully Vibrant and Fresh.
It's very cool to finally see the guys singing their songs as they looked back then  and then to see them NOW  Allan Clark always had one of the best RnR voices EVER  and Hollies harmony cannot be missed  you know it it sec you hear it.

Quality in every way from the interviews to the many live performances on each dvd.

4703520,5,B005HS00U0,"Isn't it great to have something new from the Hollies after all these years.  I've collected just about every cd issue from the band over the years.  I didn't think there was anything left, but Reelin in the Years has certainly delivered.  This is a must have for any Hollies fan.  I echo some of the other reviews that point out the gap in the post Nash material, but just maybe, there is more out there for a volume 2.  It would have been nice to include some footage from the reunion tour with Graham Nash in the 80's.  Somebody must have shot that, as the Hollies Alive cd is from that same tour.  Short comments on each track:
1.) Baby That's All, the color reproduction is awesome, especially considering it's one of the oldest performances!
2.) Rockin Robin, is equally good in good old B&W.
3.) Little Lover, the color film is grainy with this rare track and features classic 60's dance moves.  The outfits they wear are like what Brian Epstein picked for the Beatles.
4.) Just One Look, even in mono is a good clean pop track.
5.) Here I Go Again, Beautiful color video' It's 60's pop.
6.) I'm Alive, obviously a voice dub, but still a classic B&W video.
7.) Look Thru Any Window, Looks like it's a filmed from TV process.  Has a raw feel with dancers.
8.) I Can't Let Go, Excellent, clean rock,  Alan dances like Roger Daultry.
9.) Bus Stop, It's a little raw as well, but has a good guitar solo.  Tony's banjo strum demonstration is great!
10.) Stop Stop Stop, Could easily be a Monkees song.  Grahams commentary on 2 track to 4 track to 8 track technology is insightful.
11.)On a Carousel,  To me, it's the quintissential 60's pop song.  The Abbey Road studio film has a Beach Boy's Pet Sounds sessions feel to it with the vocal harmonies.  Worth the price of the DVD right there!
12.) Carrie Anne, The story on the steel drum part is good, although this live performance doesn't do justice to the track.
13.) Dear Elouise, Great B&W video, and the wink is almost a George Harrison thing.
14.) King Midas in Reverse, It's flower power and Graham Nash makes his case.
15.) Jennifer Eccles, Another raw pop song.  I never realized before how late in his Hollies career that Graham did this.
16.) Wings, Another gem of the DVD.  This less known track reminds me somewhat of the group ""Love"".
17.) Do the Best You Can, The one track in the collection I could do without with.
18.) Listen to Me, I also had no idea this song came so late in their career.  It's awesome, and really neat in B&W.
19.) Sorry Suzanne, Makes the jump to 70's style video.
20.) He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother, Good version of the song in a color video
21.) Long Cool Woman, 70's pop rock at it's best
22.) The Air That I Breath, Overall best video on the DVD.",1320796800,25,2744,4.368110236220472

Wow- I've seen a lot of rock documentaries in my day but this is one of the best, most enjoyable I've ever seen.
I'd never considered myself a Hollies fan before this. Oh sure, I remember the big hits on the radio; ""Carrie Anne"", ""Long Cool Woman in A Black Dress"" and so on, and acknowledge their importance to The British Invasion, but having now seen the band from the inside, I like them even more. Over the course of two hours here we are treated to clips from 22 television appearances (the sole bonus feature here, and it's a good one, is the option to watch these TV appearances in their entirety), vintage interviews from the 60's while their career was sky rocketing, and current interview sessions with the band members, who all look back fondly.
Things I never knew before include the original of the band name; about to go on stage in some tiny club (it may have been The Cavern, I don't remember) on a December night, the emcee asked for the band name. They didn't have one at the time but as it was close to Christmas, someone suggested The Hollies and it stuck. Graham Nash also recalls leaving the band to go to America on December 8th 1968, and being in the studio with Stephen Stills (to whom he was introduced by Mama Cass) and David Crosby. The Hollies, already a successful group by anybody's measure, went on to have their biggest hits after Nash's departure.
Various band members, including singer Allan Clark (great voice), guitarist Tony Hicks and drummer Bobby Elliot are a fountain of anecdotes, mentioning recording at the famed Abbey Road studios, often at the same time as The Beatles, who were coming up at the same time. As I watched ""Look"" and enjoyed some truly great songs and performances, inspired by the 3 part harmonies, it struck me that it could have just as easily been The Hollies that ruled the world instead of The Beatles.
I have several musical documentaries in my library, including dozens of ""Classic Album"" DVD's, but plan on watching ""Look Through Any Window"" often. It has increased my appreciation for the band ten-fold, and now I must track down more of their music, and more of this ""British invasion"" DVD series, to see what else I've missed. Again- this is one of the best programs of its type that I've ever seen, essential viewing for any fan of 60's music.
Top Tracks: all interview clips, plus performances of ""He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother"", ""The Air That I Breathe"", ""Jennifer Eccles"" (interesting story behind that one!), ""King Midas In Reverse""",1320624000,3,2551,4.631346578366446

4703525,5,B005HS00U0,I have read the USA reviews with interest. As a northerner Englishman I would like to present my review (on Amazon U.K). The Hollies were intrisically English who 'invaded' America. This DVD is an outstanding exmple of the two. I would urge you to see my review of 'Look Through Any Window' on Amazon UK for a local view.,1320019200,2,321,4.4576271186440675
4703526,3,B005HS00U0,"Look Through Any Window 1963-1975 is a fascinating look at The Hollies, let down only by its imbalance. While the Hollies Nash period('63-'68) is covered with great love and obvious care, the 1969-75 years are given very hasty treatment, leaving this history somewhat lopsided. Case in point: 1968, hardly a banner year for the group, is given 4 songs, equal to the number selected from  the entire '69-'75 period.

There are some wonderful interviews here with Hollies Nash, Clarke, Hicks and Elliott but one wonders why Sylvester and Calvert were so obviously excluded. The early years are covered thoroughly and beautifully in both song, film and interview up to the point of Graham's exit from the group, but then begins an unseemly rush through the Nash-less period. One can't help but draw the conclusion that the Hollies sans-Nash, are considered of little account.

If you consider, as some Hollies fans do, the Nash years to be the quality  Hollies years, and the Hollies without Graham to be just another pedestrian pop group, then this release will be everything you've ever wished for. However, fans of the Clarke-led era will be in for a letdown, to say the least. It's a shame this production wasn't a little more inclusive of the early '70's group, since the earlier period is very well done indeed. More's the pity.",1319673600,16,1331,4.902222222222222
4703527,4,B005HS00U0,"if you love their music, you'll love this doc.  and you'll learn from it too.

my main gripe is they included a couple too many video performances from their uninteresting middle period after nash left.  those songs aren't good enough to rate so much screen time...although from a curiousity standpoint they were interesting.  but i would've preferred more of their early stuff.  for instance, 'pay you back with interest' and 'tell me to my face' weren't shown, and those songs are much more interesting, and date from their most creative period.

interesting info about 'king midas in reverse', which was sort of their waterloo (not the song 'waterloo'. but their commercial waterloo).  i would've liked to know more about why it didn't get more airplay in the u.s....did epic get behind it?  it followed one of their biggest hits, 'carrie anne', and epic was a hot label.  did they drop the ball?  the song and the production are marvelous...always been one of my faves.

4703531,5,B005HS00U0,"I have been a casual fan of the Hollies for years, but 2 recent releases have increased my regard for this group considerably.  First was the 6 CD collection spanning 1963-68, and now this wonderful installment of Reelin' in the Years' British Invasion DVD series.  22 complete performaces ranging from 64-75, full of breathtaking harmonies and inventive ensemble playing.  Evident throughout (especially the Graham Nash era) is the pop acumen of the group, and also a warmth and posivivity that just makes me smile.  The live performances, in particular reveal the level of musicianship in this group.  They were no studio creation.  The harmonies (the Hollies' calling card) soar, while drummer Bobby Elliott and lead guitarist Tony Hicks in particular are tasteful and impressive. What can be said of Allen Clarke,the lead singer?  He is effortlessly poised and perfect.  What a voice!  This was a pop group, proud and strong.  They worked hard for their hits, and clearly had a love and dedication for the magical music they produced.

Key to this DVD is the fact that the songs are complete performances, rather than snippets of songs.  Audio and video quality is superb, the very best prints available of such important archival material.  Thrill to live 60s black and white clips of I'm Alive, Look Through Any Window, I Can't Let Go, and I love the live version of Stop Stop Stop with Tony Hicks replicating that weird psyche-banjo effect perfectly.  The promos for Dear Eloise and Wings are simply stunning, and the fly on the wall studio footage from January 1967 elevate this DVD to the level of historical relevance.  The post Nash years are treated respectably and succinctly, proving that Hollies magic lasted beyond the astonishing inital run.  You can't ignore hits as great as Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress and The Air That I Breathe.  As with other Reelin' in the Years productions, you can opt for the full film with interviews and illuminations throughout, or just watch the performances.  Either way, it's an outstanding DVD.  A top notch addition to any British Invasion collection.  I look forward to further volumes from this reputable outfit.
