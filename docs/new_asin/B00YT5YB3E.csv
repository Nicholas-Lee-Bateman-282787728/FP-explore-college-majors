7264432,1,B00YT5YB3E,The plot is simple. Adding goofy side tract to filled up the story of a princess who felt lust after her rapist. It's not much a story. Stupid ending which has no meaning. It's not even sensual and attractive. Don't waist your time on it. Amazon should pick better quality movies to show.,1474416000,,288,4.452830188679245

7264484,3,B00YT5YB3E,"This is such a mishmash of genres it is difficult to categorize or grade. In the opening scene in a tranquil garden with cherry blossoms swirling in the breeze, the beautiful Princess Sakura is presented as a sublime beauty---but her fate is sealed when a thief not only steals a family treasure but also rapes her. The film deteriorates quickly from that into a soft porn exploitation movie, with the princess fleeing the family manse to become a star prostitute in a brothel---supposedly in order the find her rapist and exact revenge...except that they sort of become allies in fighting off the ""real"" culprits who commissioned the theft in the first place. Loads of sword fights follow---and somehow a headless monk enters the melee---his detached head comically getting its own bites in the fray. If you are still reading this, go see for yourself---it's free on Prime and could be a welcome diversion from the current political scene.",1470700800,4,940,4.955696202531645

7264506,2,B00YT5YB3E,"Visually stunning, but heavily edited, which may account for some of the confusion noted by other .  Acting is adequate, as are subtitles, but no more, and Kyoko Hinami's primary contribution is her beauty (modeling is her forte).  Some violence, but mostly in night scenes, so not much is either clearly visible or graphic.  Had it been unedited, might have warranted a third star, but it's basically a run-of-the-mill Japanese historical drama",1466467200,4,445,5.152777777777778

7264521,3,B00YT5YB3E,This was alright for what it is. Typical bikini idol movie with over the top action and goofy story line. I guess it gives them something to do when they're not on photo shoots.

7264545,3,B00YT5YB3E,"Not really visually stunning, and as usual the description is way off. This is the story of an upper class Japanese woman who is raped by a thief and then leaves home to find him and get revenge. She ends up in a whorehouse where she is called Princess Sakura, she finds the man and somehow is in love with him, so much for revenge. Anyway there are a bunch of side stories that may or may not have something to do with her. Most notably a monk that tried to commit suicide with his young boy lover, only he lived and the boy died, and he thinks princess Sakura is the reincarnation of that young boy. You can follow what is going on, mostly, but I found it difficult to tie everything together. There is no nudity or sex so don't look for that.",1445558400,20,745,4.144827586206897

8719070,1,B00YT5YB3E,"A movie with an interesting plot, destroyed by horrid editing and direction. With an interesting story line and visual candy...it had the makings of a good, though controversial, movie. A young royal is violated by a lawless man who breaks into the palace to steal a scroll. She becomes a prostitute to find the aggressor. She becomes so obsessed, she has the same tattoo put on her as the one on her intruder. She finds him, or rather he finds her, and instead of taking revenge she falls in love with her rapist. I can understand why some would give this a negative feedback just for that reason. However, I gave it one star not just for that, but because of the horrid editing. Editing was choppy at best, direction was worse. Add in a lecher monk who gets beheaded and walks around with his head and chasing after the princess......you get a good story line turned into b movie crap. It's as if it says rape is okay because your victim wants it! But the viewer must also understand Japanese culture and Taboo in order to appreciate their art, even if it screams wrong at every turn. Don't waste your time unless you're a veteran Asian film watcher, you won't be able to appreciate this atrocity in any form.",1515888000,,1211,4.509090909090909
