8362576,3,B002BYYA0O,"The previous reviewer is correct in his technical critiques of this disc.  The video quality is not what one would expect from a Blu-Ray disc, in fact it is of lower quality than what one would expect on a current dvd.  Likewise is matting on all four sides on the image.  Also there are three white pixels near the center of the screen throughout the film and bonus features, but not the menus.  They appear like dead pixels on a TV but are not and are only visible on the film portions of this disc.  There is also a minor glitch on the menus (a dissappearing button) and the bonus feature ""trailers"" has glitches as well.  And the audio on the bonus movie ""Bride of the Gorilla"" is severely out of sync with the video and makes it unwatchable.

All around this disc has a lot of technical problems.

That being said, if you want more Gorilla footage to watch and would be OK with watching an old film documentary of them (of the kind and quality that would be watched in a classroom decades ago) then this may be what you want.",1503619200,,1030,4.300518134715026
8362577,3,B002BYYA0O,"I respect documentarians who approach a highly emotional subject with scientific detachment. A documentary that comes to mind is ""The Bridge"" (about suicide jumpers at the Golden Gate). But sometimes, I can't say why sometimes and not others, I like some good old fashioned UNscientific drama & rhetoric thrown into the mix. ""Last Gorillas"" is a pretty good scientific document about the last 250 remaining gorillas in the Rwandan forests. It features some 50 minutes of close-up gorilla footage narrated by Amy Vedder who stays true to being a mostly impartial observer. In that respect, don't expect anything dramatic or emotional like ""Gorillas in the Mist"".

For example, in one scene a young orphaned gorilla approaches Amy looking for affection & acceptance, but Amy is bound by scientific duty to refuse any such interaction. Thus, we don't get any sappy scenes of people rolling in the grass with gorillas or sharing spaghetti noodles or whatever you might be led to expect by fictional accounts.

Similarly, this film avoids the temptation to moralize, or rather, condemn humans for the obvious fault of driving these majestic creatures to the brink of extinction. Moralizing is left to us, the viewers. While there is a short, 2-minute sequence about poaching, showing a quick disturbing photo of a decapitated gorilla, Amy doesn't stray far from her scientific mission of simply counting, observing and interpreting the gorillas' behavior at close range.

If you have a soft spot for animals like me, you may find yourself wishing Amy & her crew had bonded more with their subjects, or at least delivered a climactic, teary-eyed rant or two about how their senseless persecution needs to stop. But, deliberately, they never do these things, and that may leave you feeling a bit unsatisfied. Or maybe that's exactly the way you want it, your call.

A word or two about the digital quality: although this is a Blu-ray, it doesn't seem to have been shot or remastered in 1080p HD. In fact, we see the camera equipment they used was film (not digital as far as I can tell), so expect things to be a little grainy. It's not bad; it's just not the sort of disc you'd use to show off your expensive home theater. One last technical criticism is that the bonus feature, the full length b&w movie ""Bride of the Gorilla"" (1951) has severe audio sync problems on my disc. The audio lags a good 20 sec behind the image, making it practically unwatchable. It's a shame because the feature would've been a cute, ironic look back at the way the world perceived & portrayed gorillas half a century ago.

""Last Gorillas"" is an important documentary for the simple reason that very few humans have gotten so close and filmed these creatures, ever. We learn that these enormous hulks are very gentle, social & curious animals and that their numbers and their territories are shrinking at an alarming rate. These humbling observations need no further comment, but I still wish, on a purely artistic and emotional level, that this this documentary had driven the point into our hearts a little deeper. It does make me want to re-watch ""Gorillas in the Mist"".",1388707200,,3148,4.876635514018692
