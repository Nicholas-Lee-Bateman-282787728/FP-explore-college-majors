5945288,2,B00EV1YZD2,"Being a fan of this series, I was so disappointed when I saw it. This set is expensive and the blu-ray is wasted.  There are no beautiful scenes of Canada that I was hoping to see.  Only the blue dress with the lace edging that Dr. Ogden wears in almost every episode.  She should have stayed a coroner for the police and not go to the sanatorium to work as a psychiatrist.  The never-ending love story between Detective Murdoch and the good doctor is getting very stale.  One episode they are full of passion and the next she is going off in a huff with all this loyalty for a husband she is divorcing and the man who discouraged her during her marriage for any forward step she wanted to take for her caree.  Detective Murdoch is so supportive and patiant with her and even sacrifices his religion for her and she has gotten to be a pain.  I am sorry this series has taken a turn for the worse.  The new coroner is lovely and her relationship with George, the nice policeman is refreshing. They have lost a fan with this series for me.  It was a Christmas present from my husband, but I am sorry to say I would rather have had a new pair of Christmas pajamas.",1386201600,14,1161,4.240909090909091

5945290,5,B00EV1YZD2,Another great series and a 5 star winner.  I hope they keep making this series for a very long time.  Completely different time and place that has lead to some of the forensics we use today.,1385510400,3,190,4.25
5945291,5,B00EV1YZD2,"As fans of Murdoch, we are thrilled to see a new series coming out on DVD.  We don't get to see it in real time, but look forward to catching up with all the action.  The resident engineer likes the science and inventions, while I enjoy the characters and the connections with historical or literary figures.  I used to describe Murdoch as being someone who could be Sherlock Holmes's cousin, living in Canada in the 19th Century.  Since Sherlock Holmes appears this season in an episode I will let viewers decide if the description is appropriate.  Each story sparks conversations afterwards and makes us contemplate interesting ""what ifs"" about characters or plots.  I've heard other fans say that after watching an episode they look up information on inventions or people to find out more.",1383609600,19,792,4.873134328358209
5945292,5,B00EV1YZD2,"I 'discovered' this series about 8  months ago and can not get enough of it. The stars of this program, although unknown to most Americans are well known and appreciated in Canada, where this series originated and was filmed, for the most part. The often humorous references to the beginnings of many inventions that Murdoch either builds or works with the inventors on, are wonderful. Yannick Bisson plays Murdoch and heads a terrific cast. All kinds of speech accents flourish throughout the dialogue since many of the men and women who lived in Toronto at that time were immigrants from 'across the pond' and are in fact in real life. The story lines always are full of tongue in cheek humor, and subplots as these characters build not only relationships with one another, but with the viewer. I feel like I know these folks in real life, and with few exceptions, would love having them as neighbors. One of the things I like most is the constant politeness of the speech used, as well as what my Grandma called 'common courtesy'. Men are men and women suffer greatly, too many childbirths, corsets, long gowns and petticoats in summer, all the things that humanity saddled itself with in the name of fashion and many things that society still struggles with today. Since 'Dr. Ogden"", the female lead is a bit of a crusader, these are topics that often cause her to be in 'hot water' with the establishment and are part of the aformentioned subplots now and then.  I hope season 7 will be released soon, but international law between Canada and the US prevent CBC (the broadcasting company that has taken over production and airing of the series) from showing it as a currently running program in America. I am hoping PBS will pick it up again, but if not, we will all have to wait til summer I imagine. Anyway, if you love a great mystery, inventions and history you will find that they all meld very well in Murdoch Mystery. By the way, the reference to Murdochs' eyes will become apparent when you watch the program, awesome.",1383436800,85,2031,4.654596100278551
5945293,5,B00EV1YZD2,"Awesome period sets & costumes. Realistically gritty. Multiple plots in an 1899 Victorian Canada historical suspense & crime drama. Includes fictional unveiling of then-new inventions. Murdoch's path often crosses an historic personality. Charming entertainment amidst suspense.
Older episodes are combined in a box catch-up set.

5945326,5,B00EV1YZD2,"I, too am a loyal Murdoch Mysteries fan.  You can also find the stories under the title ""The Artful Detective"" offered on Ovation.  I enjoy the shows and never miss watching.  The characters and story lines are well developed.  Notable people from the period are woven into episodes including Mark Twain (wonderfully played by William Shatner), Nicolai Tesla, Winston Churchill, Arthur Conan Doyle, Carrie Nation, and others. I'm always eager to find out what new 'invention' Murdoch will develop each week to solve the mystery and advance the cause of criminal science in early 1900's Toronto.
Please don't judge this show by one episode which one of the reviewers disliked.  Give the show a look.  I believe you'll find much to enjoy.",1500163200,,736,4.991803278688525

Solving the murder mysteries is often tied to the scientific discoveries of the day complicated by Canadian government secrecy requirements.  Historical figures, such as Winston Churchill, appear, often as less than flatteting characters.  The lead character, Detective Mudock, is a science nerd, under appreciated by his comically doubting superior.  There is a complicated love interest between Murdock and a liberated female doctor.  Wonderfully fun, interesting, nonviolent (save the murders to be solved) stuff.  Highly recommend.",1432944000,,634,5.691489361702128

5945605,5,B00EV1YZD2,"Saved me from having to continue to tape this series. Fast-forwarding through the commercials was rather frustrating as there was no warning when the show would start again and it was a matter of fast-forward, then go back, then forward, and finally hit it right!.

5945611,3,B00EV1YZD2,"Seasons 1 through 4 were spectacular - the story lines rang true, the acting was superb, and it was easy to ""suspend my disbelief.""  Season 6 does not ""ring true"" - so much more talking, with no real action or meaning - too many unbelievable interactions and two dimensional characters.  Some episodes are down right boring melodrama - WHAT HAPPENED?  Did the writing staff change, are they running out of story lines??  These great actors haven't been given much in the way of character development or dialogue to work with, so sometimes seem a bit ""stilted"" and certainly not on their game.  I keep watching thinking it's just a ""bump in the road,"" but think I must give it up as it is a poor use of time.  So sorry to see this happen to such a grand and powerful concept.",1426636800,,774,4.453900709219858

He seems less interested or something & they made her character a bit shrill & unbelievable. She couldn't tell a priest she hadn't had relations w/her husband to get an annulment because it would be a lie, but she is okay with lying about having an affair to get a divorce. Really?? Also wouldn't her being unable to have children be reason enough for an annulment back then? She is often a bit snappy in this. Murdoch has always been fairly soft spoken & not exactly a partier but seems a bit more dull in this season. Her husband changes from a mellow likeable fellow to a complete jerk in this season. Almost everyone's characters change quite a bit & not for the better & not in a way that makes any sense to me. I really hope that they fixed season 7. I would hate to buy it & have it be like season 6. Crabtree is still a riot & his interest in Dr. Grace is adorable. Brackenreid is still saying 'Follow the money'. There are still a few fun cases, situations and characters in this season but with Murdoch & his romance w/Dr. Ogden being at the forefront of the story & those things being a bit disappointing, it just doesn't hold up to seasons 1-5.",1412553600,2,1254,4.29535864978903

5945735,5,B00EV1YZD2,Another excellent season of Murdoch. Murdoch is still impressing with his forensic knowledge and inventions. We also get to see past guests - Murdoch's friend/former nemesis James Pendricke and the return of Arthur Conan Doyle briefly to name a couple. Murdoch and Dr. Ogden are securely a couple (or are they?). We even see the return of a most evil criminal for a third time and he wants revenge on Murdoch. Very satisfying.

5945737,5,B00EV1YZD2,"MURDOCH MYSTERIES SEASON 6 BLURAY is still going strong and keeping my interests!

This season is PACKED with suspense and crazy twists and turns that it will really keep you off balance. This time around Murdoch meets up with a young Winston Churchill, and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle returns. The big ""didn't see that coming"" is  Dr. Ogden is arrested for murder!

I was riveted through the entire season (as usual) but this one really combined the best aspects of mystery and soap opera into one and had me at the edge of my seat, especially the second to the last episode! I thought it was going to end on a MAJOR cliff-hanger, but as soon as I saw the opening credits of the light filament turning on and the ""Bum, Bum, Bum, Bum..."" music of the last episode, I was jumping for joy - literally (I need to get out more).

The last episode still leaves you wanting more MURDOCH MYSTERIES but at least they give you a satisfying wrap-up of Season 6.

I've already pre-ordered Season 7!

I am a little disappointed in this last season because it is pushing too much of the new morality which might be fine if it was set in modern times but I don't think is appropriate for the time period of the characters, especially Detective Murdoch.  The plots keep your interest and often bring in characters who lived in the past such as Tesla, Alexander Graham Bell, and a young Winston Churchill.  The only reason this season didn't get 5 stars is the push to make a period character in to a modern character.",1406851200,2,607,4.441441441441442

5945770,5,B00EV1YZD2,"I love this show. All episodes and all seasons. It's entertaining and funny. The shows follow the set structure of detective fiction, or ""the whodunit"", which is what makes it fun to watch: there is a ""puzzle"" to be solved, there is always a wink and a nod to the viewer that the story is fiction, there will be clues for the viewer within the movement of the plot, the prime suspect is almost never the one whodunit, and the crime will be solved at the end of the story. It is generally a stress-less game between the detective and the viewer with the primary purpose of entertainment. The recurring game-play in ""Murdoch Mysteries"" is that Detective Murdoch has an invention that will help reveal the criminal and that Constable Crabtree will undoubtedly be confused through most of the story. The ""Murdoch Mysteries"" often play fast and loose with history, but the deviation from history is often tongue-in-cheek and amusing so that the viewer doesn't mind the little inaccuracies. I haven't read the books yet, so I don't know how faithful the tv show is to the novels. However, the Mysteries are a lot of fun and I definitely recommend them.",1405814400,6,1146,4.706467661691542

5945809,5,B00EV1YZD2,I have enjoyed Murdoch Mysteries for quite awhile now.  I enjoyed season 6 as much as I enjoyed season1 which says alot about the series.  Looking forward to season 7.,1401321600,,167,4.533333333333333

5945811,5,B00EV1YZD2,Love tuning into the late 1800's and early 1900's.  Meeting historical characters in an intelligent way.  Highly intelligent Murdoch continues with his wonderful curiosity and embracement of the future.,1401235200,2,202,5.931034482758621

5945813,5,B00EV1YZD2,This series has it all!  Romance! Comedy! and Mystery!  without violence and bad language.  It's a series I will continue to purchase as long as the show is in production.  Start with season 1 so you don't miss out on all the fun.  We own all six seasons and have watched each one at least twice.,1400976000,2,296,4.214285714285714

5945817,5,B00EV1YZD2,"If you are a history buff and a mystery buff and just a good ole simple weekly drama buff....it is hard to beat this series. The characters are fun, smart with well written lines. This is not to say they are brain-teasers or twisters, but just well done weekly stories top to bottom. My favorite parts are the thinly-veiled references of a invention or items that just came to light in the 1900's and now is/are a modern staple of our lives...and how on each occasion or reference they say it will ""never"" become popular or practical...ie...Motor Cars, Motorcycles, Pizza, Silly Putty, Paint by Numbers and Texting via a dot/dash telegraph device...superb stuff. My second favorite component is/are the costumes and settings as they are most excellent in their attention to detail, I truly hope is not lost on most viewers.",1400198400,2,823,4.843971631205674
5945818,4,B00EV1YZD2,I thought the 6th series was great except for the final episode. It was kind of a let down and the back and forth between Murdoch and Dr. Ogden is getting a little old. I hope in the next series he moves on.,1400112000,2,207,3.8372093023255816

5945820,5,B00EV1YZD2,"I enjoy this because of the history factor, and the love triangles -- easy to watch.
Even though it has a murder or two, it is not full of killing and hurting the good guy as bad as the bad guy.
simple and enjoyable.",1399852800,2,216,3.9318181818181817

5945824,5,B00EV1YZD2,I've loved this series since I first discovered it a few years ago. I find everything about it appealing. It is great fun to learn about the origins of various scientific developments that laid the foundation for modern day forensic science.,1398643200,2,241,4.902439024390244
5945825,5,B00EV1YZD2,Murdoch Mysteries can hold it own against the Acorn releases of Poirot and Marple and the stories are really interesting and keep you guessing for the most part.  Inserting real characters (like Winston Churchill etc) into the plots is fun and campy.  I can't wait for Season 7.  Julia should have married Murdoch in Season 1.  What a ditz.,1398556800,2,340,4.711864406779661
5945826,5,B00EV1YZD2,"This is a wonderful detective series as well as a great slice of history. The characters are richly drawn and , I love the costumes worn by the women.

5945830,5,B00EV1YZD2,I love the Murdoch Mysteries series. I can hardly wait for the latest DVDs to come out. And the great thing about them is that you can watch them over and over. The stories are very interesting and they do such a good job filming them.,1397606400,2,235,4.130434782608695

5945833,4,B00EV1YZD2,"I was immediately hooked on this series. I love the historical context and the frequent referrals to the future. Detective Murdoch is a straight-laced, serious crime fighter who uses deductive reasoning and scientific methods to solve the toughest murder mysteries. In series six he begins to compromise his moral convictions which, I think weakens his character. Dr. Ogden should have been written out of the series a long time ago so Murdoch can move on with his life. The sexual tensions that existed in the earlier series is weakened between the two which, I think, weakens the story.",1397088000,2,588,5.010204081632653
5945834,5,B00EV1YZD2,The series is great and the only disappointment about season 6 is that it's only 13 episode unlike the other season. Great characters and interactions.,1397001600,,151,5.08
5945835,5,B00EV1YZD2,The series gets better and better as it goes along. Keep with it and you will find that you get hooked on watching it and can't wait to see the next episode. A nice change from dark mysteries with violence.,1396656000,2,206,4.175
5945836,5,B00EV1YZD2,"This is a great murder mystery series.  The scientific Murdoch is good, but the youthful, energetic Constable Crabtree steals the show.  It is too bad that more of these type of series are not produced.  Really stimulating and fun.",1396569600,2,231,4.871794871794871

BUT,,, beware - - you have to sit through about 10 minutes of ads BEFORE you can watch it
Can't get rid of it - - just just plan on starting it 10 minutes early,,, grabbing something to eat, and wait for the theme music to start.
ANNOYING as hell to pay for commercials.",1396310400,,349,4.117647058823529
5945839,5,B00EV1YZD2,Season 6 is just as entertaining and well written as the first five seasons.  We love all the characters and enjoy watching what Murdoch gets George into each episode.  The episodes are consistently fun and have twists and turns until the case is solved at the end.  We can't wait until the Season 7 is released on DVD.,1396137600,2,319,4.4655172413793105

5945844,5,B00EV1YZD2,"This is one of the most well written and acted series I've seen. I've already bought seasons 1-6 and now awaiting 7. The only thing that I take SLIGHT issue with is that some of the episodes have rather dim views of Americans. This seems to be to be a sign of the times which makes me wonder just how much liberty the writers actually take making things historical without planting modern politics into it. I just wish historical/period pieces kept politics or rather modern sentiments out of entertainment all together. But I guess you can't write what you don't know and TV writers don't have time to research I guess. I watch TV to escape, not to be regaled with how bad things are in the real world...if I wanted that I would watch the news. Otherwise GREAT SERIES and I can't wait until season 7 comes to the US on DVD!

If I've offended anyone I sincerely apologize...",1395446400,2,874,4.4625

5945848,5,B00EV1YZD2,"This final series developed in 2013 is the best yet. When it arrived (crisply packaged, new in its plastic wrap) I couldn't wait to look at it. It took an amount of self control to o-n-l-y watch one episode per night!  This final (regrettably) series is without a doubt the best yet, and as I enjoyed the episodes I really appreciated that I could purchase them (I now have all six series) and watch them again in the future. This is definitely a movie series to get hooked on! If you have not seen them, all I can say is.....what are you waiting for!

5945858,4,B00EV1YZD2,"I'm a huge fan of the Murdoch Mysteries but Season Six disappointed.
I felt Murdoch was portrayed in several instances as overbearing and full of himself.
Dr. Julia Ogden wore the same blue and white outfit in almost every episode, which led me to
believe they were under budget constraints.
I won't ruin it for anyone else but I will say the last episode ended in a very disappointing manner.",1394409600,,393,4.628571428571429

I think many families would find this series to be very entertaining. Plus some of the plot themes could provide talking points between parents and children about the changes in our society - how we see others, issues of prejudice and religious differences. The mysteries themselves are very entertaining whodunits. You won't be disappointed. We are looking forward to the next season on DVD!",1394064000,,524,5.25

The series started in the late 1890's and at the end of season 5 they welcomed in the new century. Murdoch has ""invented"" new forms of forensics. This season Murdoch comes across a young Winston Churchill, and someone who claims to be Sherlock Holmes. Arthur Conan Doyle returns to visit Murdoch as well.  The character James Pendrick returns with a ""flying machine"".  Fun show!

5945868,5,B00EV1YZD2,"I cannot say anything more about Murdoch Mysteries than all the others who have rated this with 5 stars. I have purchased every series plus the mini series that came before the TV series. I liked it from the beginning because Murdoch was an intelligent, scientifically inclined, morally upright Catholic, who had left the Seminary to become a policeman. He used far sighted and modern (in the late 19 century) techniques ideas to solve crimes. I thought it was beautiful when he started falling in love with the female forensic doctor. They became close (kissing and hugging), and he dreams of having children with her. When he finds out much later that she had committed fornication and had an abortion (she didn't want a child to interfere with her career), he was at first surprised and cool towards her but eventually he forgave her because he loved her. Later she decided to leave Toronto for America without even telling him about it. When he found out he was saddened and hurt because she had not told him of her plans. After she had been gone for about 6 months he had an occasion to see her again. He had hoped to rekindle their relationship but she informed him that she was now engaged (in just 6 months!!). He congratulates her and wish her the best. Later she comes back to Toronto to visit her family. After helping him on a few cases she decides to stay. She is now married but you can see that she still has feeling for Murdoch (incidentally she never told her fianc of her previous love relationship with Murdoch). In this last season she has now decided to divorce her husband, but in order to get a divorce she must say that she had been in an adulterous relationship. She ask Murdoch to sign a document saying he is the man who is involved in the adulterous relationship with her. At first he hesitates because of the religious implications (remember this is supposed to be the early 20th century). She then curses G-D and berates him for his moral thinking. Eventually he agrees. In one of the shows she is found at a nudist colony (this is the early 20th century). Who is writing the script for this show? What will be next? A lesbian scene with the atheist doctor  Look at how this morally upright Catholic has been beaten down into this type of servile behavior by a woman who doesn't deserve such a man. The crimes and their solutions are still very good, but every time the atheist shows up on the screen it's like a bad penny that you can't get rid of.",1392854400,,2479,4.496674057649668

Wish I had access to a TV station that aired season 7 but I will just have to wait for it to come out on DVD.",1391904000,2,420,4.526315789473684
5945877,5,B00EV1YZD2,"One of the main strengths of this terrific Canadian detective series is, in my opinion, the reliance on brain power rather than gunpowder. Detective Murdoch doesn't wade into the cases that come his way with two guns blazing; he and the people he works with use their minds to solve crimes and I like that very much.
That said, there is an uncharacteristic level of violence in Season Six but it does not overshadow the ongoing struggles that Murdoch and the beautiful Dr. Ogden endure as they try to forge a lasting relationship nor does it detract from the quality of the storytelling that is also a mainstay of this series.
As always, and to my continued delight, the writers have woven historical characters into their scripts: A young Winston Churchill, for example, and the reappearance of novelist Arthur Conan Doyle are highlights of Season Six.

5945913,2,B00EV1YZD2,"I really enjoyed the first few seasons of this series but like most good TV series or movies the writing starts to fail soon after the original. Season six has reached a record low. Did the producers get banned from the beautifully restored buildings they once used as historical backdrop?
Really disappointed in the failing of the historical detail that once made this program enjoyable. Seeing characters sporting polyester suits and clothing not fitting the time period is just too obvious to miss and demeans the once interesting show. I also dislike the continued backhanded swipes that the writers like to take at the United States with their revisionist history as well as their leftist political and social bent. They seem to delight in destroying Murdoch's devotion to his strong religious beliefs. Is there anything else about the originality of a once decidedly different and enjoyable series that they can twist to suit their clone like twenty first century minds?",1388188800,8,976,5.10625

5945926,5,B00EV1YZD2,"I discovered Murdoch Mysteries on Ovation TV (under the name ""The Artful Detective""), where I doubt it will get much promotion and it will be very difficult for the U.S. audience to discover in the ""high numbers wasteland"" of cable TV. This series is a terrific mix of slightly-steampunk Victorian costume drama, MacGyver-tech police procedural, X-Files-meets-Scooby-Doo unmasking of the supernatural, and clever mysteries and secret histories sprinkled with quirky comic moments and all the struggles of true love. Murdoch Mysteries has the addictive quality of genre TV even as it defies or transcends all categories. It crosses the intelligence of British TV with the pacing and eye candy of American TV, and produces a miraculous hybrid.

Murdoch Mysteries is set in Toronto, which for most U.S. viewers will be the equivalent of another planet, but this isn't ""alienating"" at all - the time period is familiar enough that the location could be Any City in the Victorian Era. Better yet, this series is Mom-safe: the humor doesn't go near the toilet (though it often finds its way into the morgue) and the modernizing values are cloaked in old-fashioned courtesy. In fact, I bought this series for my Mom for Christmas, and I know she's going to love it. Yet there's plenty for younger demographics to enjoy, from clockpunk gadgets to shipping favorite couples. (Though I must admit that the show occasionally teeters into rather awkward fan service on the shipping front - I'd rather see the passionate kiss than Constable Crabtree musing on when those crazy kids will get together.) Also, there is enough ""angst"" and outright depressing turns of events to enthrall the moodiest of Millennials. What more can the sick-of-reality-TV jaded American TV watcher ask?

Murdoch Mysteries is now in its 7th season in Canada, where the show is a big hit and the quality remains high. I just hope it will somehow be discovered by American viewers soon so the syndication money will pour in, and this wonderful show will continue for years to come.",1387152000,13,2043,5.041420118343195
5945927,5,B00EV1YZD2,"Season six is as good as ever!  I'm looking forward to the next season.  I love this series.  It's hard, if not impossible, to find a series of excellent mysteries that involve the unsavory aspect of murder that doesn't degenerate into something rather sordid and even salacious or revel in that theme.  Murdock Mysteries, by today's standards is refreshingly devoid of sex scenes and foul language. I think in this respect, it reminds me very much of Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes.  There certainly is no lack of adult situations but they aren't prurient in nature.  It's very Victorian...as it should be considering it is set in the late 1800's.

If you are new to the series, lucky you!  You have all six seasons to occupy yourself with while waiting for season seven!  I will be anxiously awaiting next season without that benefit...although I like to re-watch episodes from previous seasons.  There are only a handful of series that I enjoy enough to re-watch but this is definitely one of them.  (Seasons are available individually or in collection such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Murdoch-Mysteries-Season-One/dp/B001O4C6NA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Murdoch Mysteries, Season One</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Murdoch-Mysteries-Collection-Seasons-1-4/dp/B00ANGICPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Murdoch Mysteries Collection: Seasons 1-4</a>; Blu-ray is also available.)

In addition to the old-fashioned and polite etiquette, what makes this series special to me is the tongue-in-cheek references to inventors and their inventions, the famous, and even the notorious of the 20th century.  The genius Detective Murdock also invents and discovers many of the forensic tools available today to enable him to solve mysteries of great magnitude plaguing Toronto, Canada. He's a man ahead of his time (or maybe he has a time machine.)  Of the gizmos created by Murdock and others, we see the invention of a flying machine, (nope, Wilbur and Orville Wright do not make an appearance), the use of radium dust and its properties are explored and a hint of its destructive powers are given, a metal detector, and others.  In a nod to the famous, we meet Sherlock Holmes and Arthur Conan Doyle (before his knighthood) returns to be introduced to the fictional character he created.  Winston Churchill makes an appearance in which, Inspector Brackenreid speculates he could be ""Prime Minister"" one day.  My favorite invention of this season is ""silly rubber.""  I will date myself and say that as a kid I played with the 20th century version of this.  Do they still make it?

Thank goodness, all the great supporting characters return.  Inspector Brackenreid, Constable George Crabtree, Constable Henry Higgins, Dr. Emily Grace, Dr. Julia Ogden, Dr. Darcy Garland, and Chief Constable Giles.  Inspector Brackenreid continues to ""occasionally"" knock back a few glasses of his favorite beverage and his wife continues to frown upon it.  We meet his growing sons who are polite and respectful.  A concept totally foreign in today's portrayal of children/parent relationships.  Constable Crabtree and Dr. Grace step tentatively toward a budding romance and together they make some scientific discoveries of their own.  Constable Higgins is still efficient as the identifiable colleague in the collection of busy constables.  Dr. Julia Ogden is well, Julia.  She remains a lone crusader for equality for women in all issues with an emphasis on birth control and now divorce.  She and Murdock remain in love and wish to marry.  Julia's husband Darcy throws up some roadblocks there causing the two star-crossed lovers to consider their options.  (I confess to tiring of this thread in the series.)  And what would a season be without Mr. James Pendrick?

All episodes are fun, fanciful, intriguing, and an all-around pleasure to watch.  I don't want to give anything away but I will say that I enjoyed episode five, Murdoch Au Naturel, wherein someone (or two?) goes undercover, or rather, uncovered to infiltrate a nudist colony.
