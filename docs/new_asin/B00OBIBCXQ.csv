6731580,2,B00OBIBCXQ,"The Boy Next Door, a new thriller starring Jennifer Lopez and actor Ryan Guzman, may have the steaming hot love scenes, and the hunky presence of Ryan Guzman's character, but it is the true example of a movie not worth watching. The movie is predictable and unrealistic in storyline. Claire Peterson, a high school teacher, is seduced by a younger neighbor, Noah, who is 20 years old. He makes videos, attends her school and classes. It's an uncomfortable and awkward amount of scenes that attempt to make the movie overall thrilling.

The movie lacks what is necessary to BE a thriller, even Enough, her previous movie, seemed way better and interesting than this. The characters seem very boring, and the ending was unfortunately a disappointment, leaving the viewers with unanswered questions. Lopez's acting isn't as strong as it was in Enough to make the movie a success. What happened to Jennifer Lopez's aggression that she had at the end of Enough?

Although it was very satisfying to see Ryan Guzman's appearance, obviously because he's attractive and hard not to look at, that doesn't make up for this movie. The trailers seem much better than the movie itself. Indeed a disappointment.",1425081600,4,1196,4.975

I Honestly Don't Expect Something From This Movie.

6731584,5,B00OBIBCXQ,"I enjoyed this film,Ryan Guzman does a great job on stalking Jennifer Lopez character. It is a typical thriller with sexy scenes,some scares,fun dialogue etc The Acting is well done which is why It is worth seeing. Jennifer Lopez is a great actor and is believable what her character goes through with a a boy next door who will never give up. The great acting is what saves the film and makes it worth watching. The movie is Not Oscar material it is just a fun escape film with memorable moments.",1422921600,7,497,4.472527472527473

__________________________________________________

From Universal Pictures comes a thriller about one womans lust that leads to dangerous consequences. Director Rob Cohen brings forward a story about an ailing wifes marriage thats falling apart. One day when their next door neighbor Noah, a young teen, assists Claire with her garage door his rescue soon turns into obsession. After a one night fling that leaves Claire in regret, Noah begins to turn the family upside-down and putting her son in danger in the process. The film stars Jennifer Lopez and Ryan Guzman in a suspense thriller where sometimes the grass isn't always greener on the other side.

Lets get this out of the way as the trailer gives off this vibe right from the get-go. It looks like your standard Lifetime movie youd watch on television that leaves nothing to be unexpected. Its your typical lonely and vulnerable wife who falls for a youth who turns out to be a troublesome psychopath wholl stop at nothing to get what he wants and leaves blood in its wake. That pretty much sums up the entire plot of the movie. There is nothing to salvage from this movie other then two good looking actors who are the reasons as to why the movie was made in the first place. Everything else is just reasons for cliche after cliche and does a really bad job of being original and trying to add some semblance of hope.

There are moments in the movie that I have a hard time wrapping my head around because of how insane some of the things were meant to accept. First off lets start with Ryan Guzman who plays the next door neighbor, Noah. When we find out he adds himself into Claires literature class at a high school you first look at him and think, isn't he older then a high school kid? Theres no way he fits the description of a high schooler and knowing hes in his twenties as an actor your left thinking how could they not have found someone to best fit the role. Now its nothing against Guzman whos more known now for his contributions towards the Step Up series but it just comes off for the looks rather then for show.

The other thing I had difficulty with stems from Noahs first encounter with Claire and her son Kevin (Ian Nelson) when the garage door was malfunctioning and Noah would then first be introduced. Why is the uncle with Noah at the time when Claire was having problems. Its just a strange line of events that don't add up. We do find out more about Noahs uncle and how hes taking care of him do to him being ill. However, its never established as to when Noah moved in and if Claires family ever ran into their uncle next door, I mean how long were each of them living next to each other? I could understand if Noah just moved in and all but there shouldve been a more coherent way of telling.

It may seem like Im ranting about this movie without giving it its merits but for the most part its not a great movie. I will say though that Guzmans performance wasn't all that bad due to how his character changes and acts out with aggression on a number of occasions. One scene that was wild took place when Claires son Kevin was being punked by a group of kids in school and Noah shows up beating the life out of one of the students almost near the point of killing him. And another takes place while Noah confronts the assistant principal and close friend of Claires in the office. Guzman sure knows how to come off as intimidating with little to no compassion for whoever stands in his way.

When it comes to the plot and how this obsession lasts for so long with Noah you would think Claire would report it right away and not wait so long. Things begin to go sour in a heartbeat and has many instances where lives are at stake. Again, your not going into the film thinking its going to be a smart psychological thriller. Instead your thinking how stupid and annoying some of these characters are; including Claire who allows the problem to persist. I get the fact that if she were to tell her husband that she cheated on him it would fall on her considering he did the same thing. But if your life is being threatened and is involving your son wouldnt you do something to try and stop it? Yes there will be blame but for crying out loud do whats right for the sake of the family.

Try and force yourself to avoid this movie because your only going to be succumbed to stupidity and illogical motives. There is nothing of value here and whats disturbing is how many of these films are out there that aren't looked upon lightly. Hopefully, Universal and other studios will sack any future projects that lay waste to the intelligence of the viewer. But we can only be so hopeful.",1422662400,4,4723,4.446882217090069
6731586,3,B00OBIBCXQ,"The Boy Next Door was a cheesy, unrealistic movie, but I still found it fun and enjoyable. You can't go into this movie expecting Oscar-worthy acting or an award-winning script. If you know that going in (and I assume most do), you can have a fun time.

The movie stars Jennifer Lopez as Claire Peterson, a high school literature teacher, Ian Nelson as her teenage son Kevin, and John Corbett as her separated husband Garrett. Kristin Chenoweth plays Vicky, Claire's best friend and the Vice Principal of the high school. While Garrett and Kevin are camping one weekend, Claire gets caught up in the moment and has a steamy hookup with Noah (Ryan Guzman), her son's friend and ""the boy next door"". After their hookup, she realizes it was wrong and tells Noah it was a mistake, and he proceeds to freak out and turn stalker. Basically, this movie is kind of a 2010s version of The Crush, one of my favorite cheesy 90s movies. Oh and, unrelated, but apparently no one in this movie has heard of curtains or blinds.

This movie was over-the-top and completely unrealistic with some plot points that just don't make sense. At times it was also unintentionally funny. But, for me at least, it was still enjoyable and cheesily good. Some of the acting was better than others, but I had a fun time going along for the ride. (Sidenote: I don't mean to hammer home the fact that it was kinda bad, but I also don't want people to see the movie expecting something top-notch and only then realizing its actually more of a B-movie or cult classic type of watch.)  This was one of those movies where you want to talk out loud to the characters. Like, ""Oh come on - why aren't you calling the cops??!"" Or, ""Yeahh right, you wouldn't really do that!"", or, ""Quick - get OUT OF there!!"" It was fun and enjoyable and also had a pretty good ""fight"" scene that had everyone in the theater groaning/recoiling/reacting out loud at one point.

I'm a pretty big fan of JLO movies and I'm not afraid to admit it. I didn't think this movie was as good as Enough (top-notch of the JLO movies, for me), but it was better than Monster-in-Law and The Back-Up Plan. And apparently this had a better opening weekend than The Wedding Planner, so there's that.

The movie had sex, drama, laughs, and a whole lot of crazy. What else can you ask for...?!",1422403200,78,2318,4.5095238095238095

6731668,1,B00OBIBCXQ,"The Boy Next Door is the latest film that January of 2015 has to offer and man oh man does this film scream January.
It doesn't just scream January, it screams out multiple other adjectives to describe this useless, idiotic, and ridiculous film. The Boy Next Door pits a recent divorce in a torrid affair with the next door neighbor who happens to be crazy and you could probably tell how this film is going to go due to its overtly ""let's not even try anymore"" attitude. Let's start off with the good...there is none. Now for the bad, there's a ton. Number one, I think that anyone with half a brain could probably realize that this is a horrible film. It is paced terribly, it has the dialog of a cheesy Lifetime movie from the nineties and it has Jennifer Lopez in her worst role to date. The film's 90 or so minute runtime even feels too long as we wallow in classic stalker movie clichs for its duration. It runs through the classic genre thrills from Fatal Attraction, Basic Instinct, The Hand that Rocks the Cradle and many more and uses absolutely nothing with it. The biggest issue with this film isn't the terrible plot, it isn't the half baked thrills, it is the dialog. The dialog in this film sounds like the first draft of an episode of Guiding Light. There's no flavor to it, thus letting the actors turn in bland and listless performances. For a film that is listed as a suspense thriller, there is no suspense and zero thrills. Quite honestly, the only thing that was thrilling in this film were the end credits. Yes, this film is that bad and it stands up pretty high on the list of terrible films I've seen. It fits nice and snug between Troll 2 and Gigli.",1474243200,,1675,4.406451612903226

Myself I found it disgusting and sick. The script makes the actors do the most wrong and stupid things that allow this psycho young guy to kill, torture and do what ever he please's with many common sense actions which could avert all of it. This movie actually pissed me off at how badly it portrayed woman. Ultimately J LO perseveres despite herself it's to bad her best friend (script victim) got her throat slit by this guy. J Lo does find a unintended use for a small block Chevy engine. I hate these kind of movie's and I was actually reading while she watched and still it annoyed the crap out of me.",1471564800,,757,4.263888888888889

This is the worst movie ever, more like a made-for-TV movie. Jennifer Lopez is a horrible actress and this movie cannot hide it  Jennifers character is harassed by the visiting neighbor boy. she always has her lipgloss perfectly applied and her hair is always in a sexy style, even when she's fighting in a burning barn. John Corbin as her husband was a horrible choice it made watching  this movie even harder. At one point John's car loses the ability to break,  his son is driving and they are speeding down a mountain Rd it finally crashes into garbage cans filled with water and in the next scene his car is parked in the driveway with a little dent in the fender and no mention of his loss of breaks. how did he stop the car in the driveway?  Jennifer's neighbor goes for a bone marrow transplant and three days later he's walking around his house. Ha ha fastest bone marrow transplant ever.  this is the worst movie but you have to watch it just for the comedic side of a poorly written, directed and acted movie.  just don't pay for it",1466380800,,1162,4.397196261682243

6731749,2,B00OBIBCXQ,"I was so disappointed by the fact that Jennifer Lopez sank SOOO low.  She's a really good actor, when she gets a decent script! I've only seen a few films, (Enough), and some others that have slipped my mind...(no,I probably WON'T include, ""Anaconda"", as I could never sit through the whole film.)  The lady can do it, I really believe she has the chops.  I'm guessing that MANY of her fans are scratching their heads, and wondering WHAT was going on in HERS!
 From everything I have read about this amazing lady, she says, ""she acts it from the heart"". Now I'm probably WAY misquoting what I read, and none of it is supposed to be true, anyhow, (is it?).
 Now, for her part in the flick, she really did an amazing job. Unfortunately, the script was a complete washout and a totally predictable and completely worn out, tired, bored, seen-it-WAAY-too-many-times storyline. ( Actually the movie ""Anaconda"", might even have been a little bit BETTER in the storyline department . Sorry .)

Oh Jennifer! What were you thinking, mama?

Yes, you are still gorgeous.  And if I had a physique like yours, at 46, I would been knocking them dead also, (ummmmm, MAYBEEEEE, uhhh...no, change that, I definitely would not!!)  Jennifer Lopez...YOU can do BETTER... (and I'm SURE you know that.)

Well, story faux pas aside...The ""HUNK"", Was as sexy as he could have been, in a movie of this type. If a young man is going to be objectified, then he's the one to do it!  Very handsome, very sexy, very powerful, very scary.  Hell, yeah, he killed it!

 But I still don't get it.  Sorry viewers, if you were hoping for a film with any bite, then you better pass this one up. Lots of pretty people, little or no storyline.  I'm sorry for Ms. Lopez.  I truly hope she didn't make this film trying to restart a campaign for her good looks or anything like that, BECAUSE.... she really doesn't have to go there....the lady is gorgeous, she is in fabulous shape and I will always be jealous of her. I LOVE HER!
 Please, Jen, please....don't sacrifice good taste for the almighty dollar. You are an absolute winner Jennifer Lopez and don't you forget it!!",1456099200,2,2132,4.595238095238095

But shortening the time frame doesn't always kill it for me, it depends on the genre and plot. With this one and Swimfan, shortening it for me worked better because they got to the main storyline more quickly, even with the backstory. Ryan Guzman and J L, both did a good job with their roles, Ryan as Noah, the stalker goes from subtle to crazy in seconds. That seemless transition always intrigues me in movies.

6731977,1,B00OBIBCXQ,"Remake of an old story repeatedly told in many past movies, where a married woman, who isn't being treated the way she thinks she deserves by her husband befriends the seemingly nice polite teen next door and knowing society has double standards to if she ever gets caught than would be the case if she was a dude, she sleeps with him. Not to mention one of her complaints about her husband is that he slept with someone else. Of course the polite, helpfulness of the teen was all a cover, hiding the obsessive psychopath the teen really is. Throw in the fact as usually is with this storyline that she's a teacher so will likely loose her job too. That can all be okay, I mean by the title of the film you knew this would be the basic plot, but remakes or borrowing storylines from other films, need to add something of their own. There isn't one scene, one event, one idea or anything that isn't copied from another film. I would normally type spoiler alert before giving some examples so people who haven't seen it yet don't have anything spoiling their viewing experience if they read on, but honestly there are no surprises here, you know everything that is going to happen. This is like a made for television midday movie quality wise remake, I mean the opening scenes we are in a large barn where for some reason someone has decided a nice decoration would be to have a large engine dangling from a chain over the floor. I mean you know the only reason that is ever there in a film (I mean there isn't one in real life), and just in case you were glancing down at some app you are playing on your Kindle Fire or something, the camera lingers on the thing for a while.

Both actors playing the teen psychopath and the social loser son of the mother characters do a pretty good acting job I guess, I mean being unknown actors their going to take whatever work they can get, and it isn't their fault the writers didn't have an original idea for them to act with. Better to do something like this than waiting tables I guess. Lopez should have made enough money over her career though, not to financially need to be in anything like this. Granted she's in movies that are pretty low quality because she was a successful singer in the 90's, and isn't going to be offered great roles, but you'd think she would at least be reading the scripts first. Likewise Kristin Chenoweth you'd think would be offered enough roles not to need to be in something this bad.",1439424000,,2460,4.406593406593407

6732007,4,B00OBIBCXQ,"I don't know what it is about stalker movies like these, but in most cases, I cannot get enough.  I love ""Fatal Attraction"", ""Swimfan"", ""Obsessed"" (starring Jenna Elfman), and the list is longer, but anyway, as far as ""The Boy Next Door"" is concerned, I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I pretty much knew I would, which is why I took a so-called ""risk"" and overlooked the bad reviews by others who rented this movie on Amazon.

I'm not a huge fan of Jennifer Lopez...she's okay...just not one of my favorites.  I must say that she pulled this role off very well (better than what she did in the movie, ""Enough"").  I do love John Corbett.  His acting in this movie did not disappoint, and it was nice to see him in a thriller.  This is the first time I have ever seen him play in a movie that is not a romantic comedy, though I like him in those too.

The rest of the cast, is good too.  It's nice to see Kristin Chenowith as well, and though I'm unfamiliar with Ryan Guzman thus far, he is a talented actor who plays a chilling villain as well as a deeply disturbed human being.

Without, giving away too much, I do recommend this movie for those like myself who love a ""Fatal Attraction"" type of movie.

Though ""The Boy Next Door"" is not as compelling or as beautifully done visually (in my humble opinion), as ""Fatal Attraction"", it is chilling in it's own right.

It's ""Fatal Attraction"" for today's generation (minus the bunny boiling, which I can do just fine without, anyway).

Give it a shot.  I recommend it.  In fact, I'll probably purchase it...even though I left off a star.  As far as the four star review, I gave it this rating, because I found one scene to be dissatisfying.  But there's usually room for improvement in anything.",1438560000,,1738,4.418238993710692

6732023,1,B00OBIBCXQ,"""The Boy Next Door"" is J Lo's latest contribution to cinema.  Riddled with plot holes and  insipid dialogue, ""The Boy Next Door"" is easily a frontrunner for the year's worst movie.  Don't get me wrong; I never had high expectations for a January release starring Jennifer Lopez, but I thought it would at the very least elicit some hearty laughs.  Boy oh boy was I wrong.  This movie was completely devoid of humor, suspense, intelligence, and competent direction.
 Many years ago, aging,  A-list actresses like Joan Crawford and Bette Davis resorted to taking roles in B movies much like ""The Boy Next Door"" because of Hollywood's penchant for youth.  J Lo has been churning out drivel like this since her mid twenties which makes me wonder what awaits her when the years eventually start to show.  Stay away!",1438128000,,810,4.811594202898551

6732027,4,B00OBIBCXQ,Im giving four stars because I like this kind of movie. For what it is it's good. Yes if Jlo wasn't in it it would probably be on Lifetime but I enjoyed it anyway. Minor SPOILER: the scene where Jlo is talking to her BFF on the phone could've been more suspenseful but the person who was at her door was revealed too soon. Also the ending was over the top. I didn't buy Jlo as a Classics teacher. She would've been more convincing as the vice principal. But I would still recommend this movie to anyone who likes thrillers.,1437868800,,523,4.24

Yes, it did have a sort of predictable plot. But it showed something different, too. It gives a small backstory, so you can move on with the main story line.
[Claire Peterson (Jennifer Lopez) is a divorced mother who is trying to figure out life after finding out her husband cheated on her (with a secretary). Her best friend Vicky Lansing (Kristin Chenoweth) is trying to help her move on like BFF should. On a weekend trip, her ex-husband Garrett (John Corbett) and her son Kevin (Ian Nelson) go away and leave Claire home alone. Later in the night, Claire gets a call from Noah Sandborn (Ryan Guzman aka ""The Boy Next Door"") and tells her to come over. She comes over, makes dinner, and talks to Noah. Noah mistakenly takes these gestures as her liking him. He seduces her, tells her what he wants to hear, and whisks her into a wild night together. The day after, she knows she's made a mistake and avoids seeing him again. After he finds out about this, he tries to convince her that night wasn't a mistake. After that, he starts to obsess over her and will do ANYTHING to get her back. He becomes her stalker and the story goes on from there.]
So many of these reviews on here make the movie seem bad. When it only has a predictable story plot. There are a few jump scare moments, and some cheesy scenes. But it kept me on the edge of my seat, because I didn't wanna expect anything. It could of turned left and no one would of seen it coming.",1437782400,,1609,4.348837209302325

I bought it on Amazon prime so that I can watch it anytime.  I did watch it with my teen daughter and she was very uncomfortable with the sex scenes so remember that if you're watching it with kids. It was pretty graphic.  Honestly, I think it showed more than 50 Shades of Grey did. LOL!  None the less, it was a good chic flick.

6732148,2,B00OBIBCXQ,"mostly because of the writing, but also the way it was shot: too many closeups for my taste. the character Jennifer Lopez plays had many chances to report her stalker and she did nothing sensible after he revealed himself to be troubled. I understand why she'd initially hesitate to tell her boss, but after the young man crashed her class, falsely sending an email from her (or that is what I thought had happened, though I admit to being unable to view this film in it's entirety, so maybe that's not what happened), her character could've decided to come clean and tell the principle what had happened, and most importantly, when (sex w/him before he was her student), and also that the young man had send the email (if it turns out that he did it), and basically she acted like she should go this situation alone when all she had to do was report his behavior to the police. admittedly she wouldn't want her husband and son to know what she'd done but she could have explained to the authorities what had happened and that the young man was stalking her and that she didn't want her family to know about the sex. I understand why she wouldn't have wanted to talk to them but she should have forced herself. she could've asked for help and she didn't and it didn't make sense that she didn't when he first appeared in her class. I gave her a pass initially because she'd have been surprised, but after that, after he followed her from school that day, that entire sequence of events should've had her calling the police, forget embarrassment. if she'd done that it is unlikely that her husband or her son would've suffered the attacks they did. again, I didn't see the entire film, just too unappealing on so many levels. Ms. Lopez is beautiful but she overacts here, her choices are too on the nose. it's not that she's a bad actress, she's not. it may just be that she needs more practice. she is an adequate actress here but not accomplished, I don't really know how to describe it, but her character behaves as if she already knows the progression of the film before the story gets there. it may just be poor direction. I definitely didn't like the writing. not scary, not thrilling, way too much cheese cake, not enough craft in the writing. and lastly, the person stalking her is a man, not a boy, so didn't think the title fit",1435363200,,2336,4.485915492957746

6732166,2,B00OBIBCXQ,"The Boy Next Door is an erotic thriller that tells a story about an inter-generational adulterous affair between a High School teacher and a twenty-year old student.

This was definitely another version of Fatal Attraction. No question about it. The story has been told and as the viewer watches it,there is nothing refreshing nor surprising as the story is being told except the gender change. Also,all the elements of the said film are here present like the intense sex scene between Claire and Noah and the psychotic qualities that Noah possess to make life miserable for Claire and his family. What about the ending?Well,we get to see a violent conclusion as Claire gets to finally kill Noah in the end.

6732168,1,B00OBIBCXQ,"This movie is too dumb to even enjoy as a cheap thrill. I knew this movie wasn't going to be amazing, but I thought it would at least be entertaining which is what I wanted at the moment. Instead, it was simply annoying from the opening scene. I hate movies that rely on a character not having a lick of common sense in order to create all the things that happen--- that's just lazy writing at its best. Jennifer Lopez's character, Claire,  spends majority of the movie being stupid about everything.  Noah (who is technically of age) ends up stalking Claire after a night of sex which she calls a mistake, so he turns psycho. Noah starts doing a bunch of crazy things like stalking and harassing Claire, hacking into her computer and even beating this kid half to death and Claire doesn't do anything to try to stop him. Claire even allows her son to continue hanging out with this guy and her lame attempt to keep her son away from Noah comes far too late. By that time,  her son has been brained washed by Noah and he's even formed a relationship with her estranged husband. While her family and even her closest friend unknowingly delve more and more into danger--- Claire doesn't think to herself, ""let me get help,"" ""Let me come up with a plan,"" ""let me kick this son-of-a-bitch's ass."" Instead, she's just left with her mouth agape with every stupid thing Noah does, and she literally does this for 90 percent of the movie until the nonsensical last few scenes.

There are a bunch of things wrong with this movie, but I would say Claire's unrealistic and passive behavior towards a guy who is threatening her and her family, makes this the ultimate worst movie. I recommend you avoid this completely--- if you're looking for a fun thriller try No Good Deed.",1435190400,,1764,4.537735849056604

What happens shortly after that is a steamy sex scene with this young man and her being fake acting like she doesn't want it, but gives in.

The Next morning she feels horrible for sleeping with a student and tries to call it off with him and tells him never again, and then the psycho in him begins to slowly emerge, while she is still horny looking for a bang from her cheating husband.

6732196,1,B00OBIBCXQ,"Non-creative writing as this plot line has been done, almost exactly, numerous times before. Five minutes in you know where the story is going. Add in a genre listed as thriller, now the ending is already mapped out for you. The usual 3-way tumultuous romance with frustrated teen in the middle (usually female, but male this time). Ending was just a series of predictable yet improbable, really improbable, sequence of events. Why is it in movies that when a smaller person (usually female) knocks out the bigger, badder adversary their next move is a ""make-no-sense-dumb"" go do something else with back turned? In this case, despite being hit with a crowbar with a force that would have broken a metal chair baddy is back to normal a minute later. Help, oh incredulity master!

Add in robotic acting (can we call it acting?) augmented by the ""cat out of the bag"" scripting technique to rescue the acting using short sentences with short words. That brings us to Lopez's main contribution which is to allow properly chosen camera angles and attire to show her primary assets in the best light. A little spray-on sweat didn't do any harm; also a little spray-on to show off the self narcissistic body promotion of the guy next door. Speaking of that subject the current trend in film and TV (witness: DeGeneres show) is abs, muscles and tight fitting T's to make money off of a certain frustrated female demographic.",1434412800,,1416,4.80327868852459

You have seen this movie a thousand times over and sometimes done better. The bad guy begins to ruin the woman's reputation, tries to turn her family against her and when all else fails with 15 minutes to go before the credits decides to kill her since he cannot have her and no one else will.

The movie was better than the average Lifetime thriller or the campy teen thrillers out there. The director kept the story and twists rolling making it hard to tune out. Kind of 90's feel in genre which I kind of liked. My eyes definitely perked up at the steamy scenes. (Wish I would've rented the Bluray)  Corban was a nice touch as the husband, a charming guy with natural likabilty. He narrates the Applebees commercials too. They could've had a bit more backstory on the boy and why he had split personality but if your in the mood for an affair/blackmail flick this should cover your itch.

6732415,2,B00OBIBCXQ,"This was kind of a big budget Movie of the Week that used to be on network television twenty years ago.  The story has been done before in some form or another.  Jennifer Lopez is a high school literature teacher named Claire Peterson who is going through a rough time with her husband, Garrett, and having her teenage son, Kevin, look on.  A teenager named Noah has moved in next door to help care for his frail uncle and befriends her son.  One night when Garrett and Kevin are away on a camping trip, Claire and Noah find themselves alone.  In a moment of weakness, Claire and Noah have a night of passion (and it would be hard to resist if you had a dude like Ryan Guzman who's making a move, truth be told).  The next morning, Claire realizes, rightly so, that this is / was a mistake and that they shouldn't have done this.  He needs to forget about this and they are going to go on as if it never happened.  After that, of course, Noah becomes obsessive and demanding of her attention.  He does the typical stalker stuff (sending her presents, showing up places where she is, rearranging his schedule to coincide with hers, etc.) because, like all stalkers think, they want to protect her or are looking out for their victim's welfare.  And of course, he's out to make her leave her husband because she loves him and they're going to be happy together, etc.  One can pretty much guess where this is going and what happens at the end.

Why only 2 stars?  There is not a lot of depth to the character of Noah.  He obviously has a lot of backstory which is glossed over (his parents both died months before and all the family he has left is his uncle who he moved in with, what happened to them?).  One cannot always understand the mentality of a stalker, as I have seen stalking behaviors that Noah shows (the sending of presents, photographs / mementos of the victim, showing up places where the victim is, etc.).  The stalker may be saying to the victim and others around them that they want to be their friend, they are looking out for them, they want them to love them too, etc.  But what a stalker is REALLY saying by their actions is that ""You WILL acknowledge me.""  And when the victim continues to ignore them or moves on with their lives, the stalker's behavior ranges from obsessive to dangerous.  How DARE they not be the center of the victim's world!  People don't realize how crazy others can be until they are crossed or the right situations show themselves.  Quite honestly, Ryan Guzman / Noah is not threatening enough as a killer rather than his ""average guy"" that he first presents himself to the world as being.  And this whole ""fantasy gone wrong"" thing has been done before.  Still, it's a good time to spend an evening of lite entertainment.",1432684800,,2768,4.448412698412699

The parts that should have been suspenseful I was able to guess what was going to happen next and by the time I got to the middle of the movie I started to loose interest a little.,1432598400,2,321,3.8059701492537314
6732424,2,B00OBIBCXQ,this movie was unrealistic on every level. I would definitely take a closer look at other movies before renting this one. J Lo should possibly look at staying in the singing arena only.,1432598400,,185,4.636363636363637

I especially like Jennifer Lopez and have enjoyed some of her action/suspense movies before but the plot line in this movie was just NOT credible.  At first we had some sympathy for the predicament the lead character got herself into but then it became comical as her choices became more and more implausible and bizarre.  As a teacher, it is understandable that she wanted to cover up getting involved with a student, but it is simply not believable that she would continue to ignore the dangers that her stalker posed.

It quickly became ""just plain silly.""",1432080000,2,647,4.792792792792793

The actor who played Noah was mediocre to say the least. He was not believable and looked way older than the part he was playing.  Jennifer Lopez on the other hand was not the right person for the role from our perspective. She looked too young for her part. Nothing wrong with that, but she just  didn't  fit the part  of a mom. Overall the acting was poor and the movie was not very entertaining. My wife really wanted to watch this movie and was very disappointed to say the least. We gave it two stars and that was reaching on our end. Movies are suppose to be entertaining. This movie is not. Universal Pictures went on the premise that sex sells. Jennifer Lopez and Ryan Guzman are both good looking people.  The only problem is that  you can't replace bad acting and a poor plot with good looks.

The ending was a tad ridiculous and really the whole movie was what I would describe as ""heavy-handed"". I am not a fan of steamy sex scenes but at least those scenes were tastefully done with no overt nudity.  I know sex sells but frankly I am tired of always having to endure watching very intimate scenes when I honestly don't think they are necessary to create an excellent movie experience.

If you don't like Evil Dead or movies that are on the ridiculous side and don't get the irony, then do not use actual money to watch this.  If it is free, and you have the flu and you have been watching movies all day and you have nothing at all left, then yes, maybe.

Good grief, how many twisted ""fatal attraction"" movies are out there? Okay, so everyone is hot, and everyone got to see ""her"" a little more uncovered than usual. Big deal. And the last scene, pretty gruesome. But nothing we haven't seen before. Are we disconnected from reality? Ummm, hell yeah, with this garbage. lol J Lo, I still think your awesome, but don't do this to your fans again, I beg you! :)",1431561600,7,568,4.268518518518518
6732554,5,B00OBIBCXQ,Well written,1431561600,,12,5.5
6732555,3,B00OBIBCXQ,"The movie starts out in a way that lures the viewer into thinking this is going to be a great movie. As the movie progresses however, it becomes too melodramatic and not very believable. That is the problem with this movie. As it progresses it becomes very predictable and unrealistic.
Jennifer  Lopez is supposed to be a literature teacher but you never see her actually teaching class in the movie. Also, her acting is not very convincing. The so called hot guy who is after her doesn't even look like a younger boy.

The part of the movie where she arrives at her friends house, the door is unlocked, no one is home, but Jennifer walks inside the dark room (with her cell phone)  yelling her friend's name and shining the flashlight is ridiculous. No one would do this in a real life situation. They would be more likely to run back outside and perhaps call 911.

This could have been a great movie if it had been done in a more realistic manner  and with the sequence of events portrayed to be more believable. Instead we see a  a male ""Fatal Attraction"" style movie  with a disappointing ending.",1431561600,,1100,4.49748743718593

6732557,5,B00OBIBCXQ,"This movie is fantastic if you can look past the silliness of the premise at some points....particularly the end. It's cute to see Jennifer wearing her clothes from her Kohl's line....and to see her in almost a constant state of panic. She plays the part very well....sexy, authoritative, vulnerable, dominant.....and super hot in the sex scene. It's worth a watch.....in my opinion.",1431561600,,383,5.193548387096774
6732558,3,B00OBIBCXQ,"It's definitely a predictable, you think the villain is just too crazy to meet their own demise, type of thriller. J-Lo's acting is bland, bveutiful as always though. Worth the watch to pass the time. There are always these questions running through your mind like ""why didn't you just tell someone when they ask?"" or ""Why not take a minute and call the cops or warn your husband who could help protect your son?""

Claire Peterson (Jennifer Lopez) has issues with her husband (John Corbett) who cheated on her. They live separate but share a teen son Kevin (Ian Nelson) who has bully issues. The muscle bound intelligent charming Noah (Ryan Guzman) moves in next door, cue Carly Rae Jepson, and school teacher Claire takes a passing interest that culminates into a one night stand followed by the expected stalker/psychopath Noah that escalates into an absurd fiery cage match. Kristin Chenoweth plays the school's vice principle and confidant who makes bad cookie jokes.

The script didn't know if it wanted to be a Lifetime film or a ""B"" psycho movie. It is another film that they didn't seem to know how to end, not wanting to copy endings of other films of this genre.

Strike one.  Next the idea of Jennifer Lopez as a literature teacher??? Strike two.  Thank goodness she wasn't actually shown ""teaching.""  Totally unbelievable.

He becomes violently obsessed with her and drastically manipulates situations to fit his twisted mind.  She realizes quickly she made a huge mistake letting her hormones take over logic.

6732727,3,B00OBIBCXQ,"This film starts off with great potential.  Unfortunately, it quickly devolves into being a cheesy version of what could have been a very intriguing thriller.  Lopez's character is too quickly seduced, and too nave in all too many situations to sympathize with.  Her obsessed student lover generates some heat with her and he is believable in the role, but the story quickly turns him into a caricature, even though his acting was fine until then, thereafter you just didn't want to watch it anymore.  Her acting is fine, it's just what she's given to work with as well.  The part of her husband is kind of a throwaway part that didn't even seem important.  Kristin Chenoweth as the best friend is always fun to watch but is also given little to do here as well.

If you took Fatal Attraction, switched the genders, and then made it an infinitely less interesting and suspenseful film, that's what you have here.  It's unfortunate, but the film uses the same typical obsessed psycho lover plot that's been rehashed all too many times.  What was interesting about films like Fatal Attraction and the classic Play Misty for Me was that they were well done and different.

Note to screenplay writers, when your main character is summoned by a friend to their house and then arrives at a dark home with no one answering and the door unlocked, most people with common sense would not walk around using their cell phone as a flashlight and yelling their friend's name.  Most people would assume something was wrong immediately and not walk through the house, but immediately seek help, especially given that they have a cell phone working and in their hand.",1430611200,21,1651,4.757894736842105

6732748,2,B00OBIBCXQ,"Director Rob Cohens The Boy Next Door, Jennifer Lopez latest unsuccessful attempt to break out of the cycle of Romantic Comedies and cinematic failures and show her range as a thespian (she tries to portray a Classic Literature Professor here with the same one-note results), is every bit as generic as the title suggests. It follows in the footsteps of 2014s Before I go to Sleep as a multi-million dollar movie of the week that exhibits a well-known, Grade A cast rehashing every Thriller convention available at their immediate disposal. The Boy Next Door is perfectly content to marinate in its routine as it moves at a pace perfectly suited for the accepted standard of these types of films (first hour is Jennifer Lopez affair with the psychopath, actor Robert Guzman as the nineteen year old Noah Sandborn, who hides his vindictive nature behind and the last half hour is when the predictable suspense elements are hurled in) as if director Cohen and writer Barbara Curry were being through a checklist of formulaic elements and wanted to make sure they included everything they possibly could to make sure they hammered home every clich in the Help! I Slept with a Psychopathic Stalker subgenre as possible.

 Herein lies another problem: the sarcastic seven word description I have given this film really entails the entirety of The Boy Next Door s 91 minutes. It never presents any struggle for Lopez when she starts to see the increasingly violent actions (which, predictably starts with pictures he took of the affair and in the next thirty minutes escalates to a finale perfectly fit for the ending of any garden variety slasher film) of the title character. There couldve been psychological tension, a build-up of some sort other than thinly veiled telltale innuendos about the episode between Guzman and Lopez cast at various others which are held back from any type of impact it may have by being packaged in the previews.

 Actually, this represents perfectly another case of If you have seen the promo ads for it you have already seen the movie. Those who put together the commercials for this mediocre effort did such a good (or bad depending on how you look at it) job of giving us the entire plot and the chain of events exactly as they happen in the feature that you get all this film has to offer in two minutes flat. Such is a testament to how little actually occurs in this motion picture and how apparently content it is to be this way. The other 89 minute are basically filler with Lopez looking terrified and Guzman trying feebly to appear frightening despite the actuality that most of what he does is the equivalent of a child throwing a temper tantrum for the first  or so of this cinematic endeavor.

 Its all perfectly bland. Again, in following suit of a Lifetime Original Movie, the cinematography is bright when it needs to be and gloomy when the characters and thin-story need it to atmospherically be that way but it is never remarkable or striking. There is a sense of unutilized capability in the cinematic look as well as the acting, the paint by numbers writing and dialogue, point and shoot directing (though it doesnt even try to work as eroticism in the early stretches and showcases no chemistry whatsoever from Guzman and Lopez which, in retrospect, could also be a testament to the quality of their performances) that seems fair, as if it cared or was given something with more heft and challenge it could really be molded into something stalwart but, as it is, it simply sits in silence on the screen as if mournful for all that this feature couldve been if some genuine interest was invested (and some attempts at originality, especially in its mundane generating of suspense department, were thrown into the proceedings). All of the so called surprises are just plot pots Cohen and his film-making team felt they had to throw into the cinematic pot, for they are all items we have seen recycled so much we expect them to show up (another fatal problem of this film and the fact that Lopez and the other actors and actresses sharing the screen with her are made to give wide-eyed, aghast looks which seem comical in retrospect of how obvious these so called surprise turns of events are) and therefore work as bad as if Cohen hadnt even tried to give us something unexpected.

 Despite all this, it does have its occasional bouts of low-grade entertainment. Sometimes intentional, more often than not it is inadvertent, but it works like one of those movies we rent by ourselves just as a way to kill an hour and a half that, when the end credits roll and we recollect on it, we don't regret sitting through, even though it will be hard to recall any specific event from the film a day or two later, that we enjoy a little more than we admit but we never dare tell someone we watched. Its trash, too be sure, but at least it isn't too full of itself. Cohen film wants to provide moderate thrills and suspense, which, at the very least, keeps it from becoming overblown (like the ending of the film which stands as one of the best of this sub-genre: Adrain Lyne Fatal Attraction from 1987) and it doesnt ever become too serious or mean-spirited (as many modern Horror films have become). I guess, this is one case where the intentional decision to make every cinematic facet here typical keeps this from becoming a terrible way to discard our time. Instead The Boy Next Door is simply a waste, no more and no less, but, an occasionally tolerable one.",1430524800,4,5499,4.690155440414507

Jennifer Lopez looks as sizzling hot as ever and I found the sex scene (there's only one but it is long) to be difficult and embarrassing to watch; it didn't look like she wanted to be there and if she didn't neither did I.

6732783,1,B00OBIBCXQ,"THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN...ITS SO LAUGHABLE I WATCHED CINEMASINS while this movie was going on. You basically could watch any film while this is playing. BASICALLY HERE IS THE STORY IN A NUTSHELL.

JLO portrays a mother who loves YOUNG MEN and realizes that the YOUNG MAN (RYAN GUZMAN) I swear its a combination of GOSLING AND JOHN LEGUIZIAMO with this guy...is a psycho.

Blackmails her...realizes it was a mistake pulls a stupid ""FATAL ATTRACTION"" and literally Microsoft word all of FATAL ATTRACTION and THE GRADUATE to make the damn film.

All that is left to say...YOUNG MAN DIES and family gets back together.

So for anyone wanting to watch or rent it...DON'T. I just told you the whole movie.

Thank You.",1430179200,3,720,4.728
6732784,2,B00OBIBCXQ,"If the movie Maid in Manhattan and The Crush (Alicia Silverstone in the 90's) had a love child, it would be this movie. That baby was ""JLO"" starring in a Lifetime style movie based on a teacher-student relationship that gets wildly out of hand and blown out of proportion. This movie is wildly hilarious due to how unrealistic it is and how Lifetime-ish it tends to be every other minute. My friend and I were literally laughing out loud in the movie theater. We expected it to be something like this, which was half the fun on an otherwise dull weeknight.
Perhaps the best use of this movie is if you're bored and want to turn it into a drinking game for a night at home with friends. Take a swig every time JLO is simultaneously portrayed as a school teacher and super model. Take another swig every time that foxy-creepy 20 year old high school student pops out of the woodwork or leaves his sleazy imprint in a room JLO enters.",1430179200,3,931,4.4186046511627906
6732785,3,B00OBIBCXQ,"""None of this will ever see the light of day, if you let me show you what's possible."" Claire (Lopez) is trying to put her life back together after finding out her husband cheated on her. When Noah (Guzman) moves in next door he begins to help her out around the house fixing things. One night things go a little too far and Claire regrets it. Noah becomes angry at her regret and lives are affected. This is another movie that is pretty much what you would expect. The movie is pretty tense and entertaining but was lacking something, for me at least, to make it as tense as the movie was going for. I had a hard time not comparing this movie to Fear, and because of that I didn't think this was as good and had a hard time fully committing to this one. All that said though, the movie is pretty good and I do think it's worth watching. Overall, not as good as Fear, but one of the better Jennifer Lopez movies I have seen. Definitely worth seeing.

6732819,1,B00OBIBCXQ,"It is a truth universally acknowledged that an audience in possession of a ticket to watch a Hollywood movie must be in want of a brain.

While Jane Austen might have continued to write an elegant and witty review of The Boy Next Door, I can only abandon any attempt at eloquence because, frankly, this dire little movie doesn't deserve such an effort. It is very much in the tradition of script-by-numbers whereby all the stale old Hollywood clichs are trotted out like plywood sets for yet another moment of re-use in an utterly banal, infantile, and uninspired piece of work. While I'm accustomed to the Hollywood assumption that the audience is too brain-dead to be worth making any sort of effort, I find this particular movie even more distasteful than the average schlock because of its pseudo-morality.

Here's the issue: everyone over the age of four knows that homo sapiens is a semi-monogamous species. This makes life difficult for us, but it's just a fact of life. European movies explore the resulting issues and complications in an adult way. Hollywood, full of philandering movie moguls and wannabe stars trying to sleep their way to the middle, feels called upon to pretend to Victorian morality whereby any infidelity must - absolutely must  - be punished. Hence a long tedious string of movies among which Fatal Attraction and TBND feature for their total conformity to this requirement. The unspoken assumption is that the bed-hopping Hollywood types can continue to enjoy their freedom to fornicate so long as they churn out rubbish designed to frighten ordinary Americans out of any possible thought of infidelity. The simplistic message: it's good to ogle naked female legs and have a quick vicarious thrill in the first reel but if you betray the sacred bond of marriage you will suffer the consequences. In Hollywood-land every potential lover is really a stalker waiting to ruin your life - a stalker who, rather like a vampire or a super-hero, will be nearly impossible to kill.

So not only do we get all the worn-out conventions of the standard schlock-horror movie but we also get the mind-numbingly stupid convention of Victorian Morality. Who needs government mind control when we have Hollywood?

Of course Hollywood is never going to make interesting movies that have relevance to real people's lives. It's never going to produce scripts that have anything to add to the sum of human experience. It's always going to churn out infantile nonsense for the masses, so that obese dullards can lounge in comfortable seats while consuming the maximum possible quantity of soda, popcorn, candy and ice-cream while staring at the empty spectacle of slender people running around living interesting lives. That's just par for the course. But add on top of that the hypocrisy of Hollywood Morality and you end up with a movie that sinks even below the negative expectations one normally applies to such dross. Frankly I'd rather chew my arm off than have to watch something like this again. It leaves a very bad taste in the mouth.",1429315200,3,3055,4.947368421052632

6732825,5,B00OBIBCXQ,"I still don't understand why Amazon allows you to review products before they are released... Anyways, based on the reviews I've read, there are so many people hating on this movie just because of the tidbit they saw in the trailer or what they think they know about it, being a J.Lo movie and all. I saw it in theaters and thought it was a very well done, erotic thriller. In fact, I may be guilty of blasphemy by saying this, but I enjoyed it a lot more than 50 Shades of Grey!

50 Shades is overblown in every aspect, right down to it's cheesy theme song (Love Me Like You Do), and took itself way too seriously when it would have been better off simply getting people off instead of trying to force a love story down people's throats. The Boy Next Door, however, is light, breezy, and does not try to accomplish more than what it sets out to do - to entertain audiences with a cautionary tale of a lust gone wrong. I like that it flips the script on the usual girl next door narrative and shows that the nice, good looking boy next door can be just as dangerously sexy. And J.Lo, at 45 is absolutely flawless and captivating as the female lead in this film. She doesn't take herself too seriously as an actress and knows what works for her. It's criminal that 50 Shades got all the buzz because this is the better film, in my opinion. 5 STARS.",1426464000,5,1347,4.26171875
