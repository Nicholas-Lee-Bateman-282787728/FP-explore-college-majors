8401139,4,B003NHRF50,"What is television about if not relationships - relating actors to the audience.  At the heart of Kirstie Alley's Big Life is a truth that many women experience - the scrutiny of peers (sure we all don't have movie stars and paparazzi to contend with), single motherhood (yes, her child support probably could help hundreds of children), and weight loss (we can't all start our own organic weight loss program) but never the less - Kirstie suffers, shines and surprises as we all do in our own way.
Sure to make you laugh and maybe cry as you see a little bit of yourself in Kirstie's Big Life.",1283904000,5,594,4.5
