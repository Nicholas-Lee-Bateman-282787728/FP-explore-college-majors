1170984,3,8373614877,I bought this because it sounded worth watching.  I was wrong. It's not a keeper.  (All Brigitte Bardot movies are not equal.),1385251200,,126,4.681818181818182
1170985,5,8373614877,"For NTC customers: This is just about the only viable version out there and if you can get it for about the $15 that I paid for it on the Amazon Marketplace, you're going to be quite satisfied. As I haven't seen the film since its original release, I don't remember if it was originally released in a widescreen format. At any rate the version offered by the Korean distributor is in the square old fashioned format. The print is decent with good color rendition and no scratches. The subtitles (that you have to select in the menu) come in Korean and English. The soundtrack is in the original French.

This is one of Bardot's best. Fluff French style at its most delightful. If you want depth go elsewhere. It's all about a young wife wanting to make her busy diplomat husband (played by hunk Henri Vidal) jealous by pretending to have an affair with - Charles Boyer - of all people. Nevertheless, Brigitte makes it all quite enjoyable.

Warning: I caught this film in its original FRENCH release, and I remember a fair amount of nudity (Bardot's) that is absent from this Korean print.

The music is early Swingle Singers variety, and it will either put a nostalgic smile on your face or send you up the walls.

Until Image Entertainment or Lionsgate or Criterion get a hold of this, this will do quite well. Don't pay more than $15 bucks for it, though.",1369008000,13,1357,4.526530612244898
1170986,5,8373614877,"Huge BB fan here.....this movie came out when I was in high school & I liked it very much.......esp. the opening title music!!.......

at that time, no CDs, but records!!.....the only soundtrack (which I was crazy about) was put out on a little 45 rpm record, called EP, for extended play.....

The DVD is a beautiful transfer!!!  sharp & clear.......what I got a big kick out of is that the title screen has that GORGEOUS closeup of BB that comes at the end of the movie, and an extended piece of the opening music!!!

So if you're a Bardot fan, this is a MUST.......I'd like to write to the company that put this out, but most of the printing is in Korean!! no way to identify who the manufacturer is!!!

If anyone can help on this point, please let me know...

The only other Bardot movie that is as funny and charming is ""Come Dance with Me""............",1359763200,3,857,4.426751592356688
1170987,4,8373614877,"A fun piece of fluff from BB's early career in the 1950s when she became one of the world's biggest stars.  To try to view this film through a politically-correct lens is a waste of time; just take it for what it is and enjoy.

The print is really nice.  The film starts with audio only for about 40 seconds.  I thought something was wrong, but a friend who owns it said that this is how the film starts on her dvd too.  So evidently it was the director's choice, unless something was missing in the original transfer.

I gave 4 out of 5 stars because, although the pink cover was shown on the order page and it said it had English subtitles, I received the version with the black cover which has subtitles in French only.  Not a problem for me, but it would have been nice to have for English-speaking friends.",1359244800,7,811,4.261437908496732
1170988,4,8373614877,"By the time Brigitte Bardot made UNE PARISIENNE in 1957, her image as a sex kitten had been well established largely through the international sensation caused by the release of AND GOD CREATED WOMAN the year before. Bardot's new screen persona proved quite adaptable whether it be in a tragedy or a comedy. UNE PARISIENNE offers us a wonderful opportunity to experience a lighter Bardot in all her rapturous, saucy splendor.

Brigitte (a nice touch using her own name), is the prime minister's daughter who marries his chief advisor in order to fix up a ""compromising"" situation. Her husband, Michel (Henri Vidal), is carrying on a former romance and Brigitte counters by starting a flirtatious relationship of her own with a visiting foreign monarch, played by Charles Boyer.

As Prince Charles, Boyer lends his continental charm to fullest advantage, and his scenes with Bardot are both sexy and funny. The two legendary stars play off of each other extremely well, looking as though they mutually enjoyed their one and only opportunity to work together.

The beautiful location photography in Paris and Nice adds greatly to the pleasure of watching this film.

The quality of this DVD is excellent, obviously having been transferred from a pristine, 35mm Technicolor print. It's in its original French language with optional English subtitles.

UNE PARISIENNE is prime Bardot. She's fresh, fun and looks fabulous.",1310688000,8,1417,5.170305676855895
1170989,5,8373614877,"Loved this movie. Bardot is a timeless beauty! Story is funny, and Charles Boyer is a great addition. The copy I had was not dubbed but subtitled. Color and quality was great. Highly Recommend!!",1016841600,10,194,4.735294117647059
1170990,3,8373614877,"This movie is fun.  How could one hate Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni?  She' young and lovely; he's young and handsome.  My complaint  is that the film is dubbed into English.  Though well-done, I soon  discovered it when Charles Boyer started to speak, and his splendid voice  was not to be heard.  If this does not bother you it probably won't amount  to a negative.  The scenery is good.",966556800,5,397,4.6231884057971016

7901028,4,8373614877,"With the always sophisticated Charles Boyer in the cast, this little French gem from 1957 should be part of anyone's collection, especially those who have an interest in early Bardot.  Set against Springtime in Paris this is a delightful little story of a young woman, a prime minister's daughter,  who marries a sort of uptight cabinet official who isn't so uptight after all as he starts pursuing other women behind her back.  Ticked off, she leaves him and takes off for the Riviera and....  well, you'll see if you decide to buy it.",1516838400,,536,4.731182795698925
