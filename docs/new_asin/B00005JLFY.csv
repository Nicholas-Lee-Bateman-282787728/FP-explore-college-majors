1515913,5,B00005JLFY,"Exactly like the other writers on this page I was immediately attracted by this wonderful show when it was broadcasted on a belgian tv network and followed every single show till they stopped it one year ago (the marriage of Rick and Lilly).  I wait for this DVD release since then!  The way the story was written and the actors (including the kids) all that was a fresh air on today's television.  The way they discribed their emotions (those black and white moments), the way they played their charachters, this way of telling life with some sense (!!), humor and the complexity of the human kind. I thought that this show could have changed a little something in all this ""wonderful land of television"".  For me it IS one of the best show I have ever seen and really hope to watch it at home once and again, again, again,...",1028937600,2,827,4.493333333333333

I don't understand why on earth they took the show off the air. The storylines were always something we could relate to. They handled every issue in a real way, it was not a ""slove the problem in 30 minutes"" sitcom, but one that dealt with life as it really happens, the good and the bad. I'd definately buy it!",1028592000,,456,4.134831460674158

1515917,5,B00005JLFY,"Excellent series that had a three year run. Herskovitz and Zwick of famed ""thirtysomething"", ""My So Called Life"", and ""Relativity"" fame brought this to the screen and it was a true gem. It's basic premise was Lily, 40, just about to go through a divorce, with two girls, and the in's and out's of it all including, and mostly what the storyline dealt with dating again and finding love. There were secondary stories with the ex's and sisters and families and the kids. It dealt with everything that was and is now, and echoes most of our lives that we are living out there.
Upon hearing the cancellation of the show, the viewers pulled an all out campaign to save it....to no avail.  But with these upcoming editions on DVD Once and Again is sure to live on in our hearts and minds for everyone to watch and learn and dream.
This show was a true work of art and most fans look forward to the next show that the creators put together. When they put the three seasons out on DVD, hopefully with extras for all us true fans that worked hard to keep the show on the air, I would recommend giving this show a chance, it truly is a gem.",1025222400,21,1130,4.305164319248826

1516087,5,B00005JLFY,"Beautifully written and with a stunning cast, Once and Again remains amongst the few television series that actually communicates what real life iis often like without resorting to unrealistic storylines that debase the overall message - perhaps even surpassing  Thirtysomething (and that's saying something in itself!)

Personally, revisiting the series is even more vivid for me now that I am going thorugh a similar situation.  You truly appreciate what the characters are going through and the tough decisions that have to be made whilst retaining dignity and respect for new relationships.  Watching this is a therapy session in itself.

I really do hope that Series 3 is released as I've just ordered Series 2 and would love to be able to complete this collection.

Given the enormous impact Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz have had on quality television and films, wouldn't it be great if they were to do a review of their programmes and even revisit where these characters might be now - a fiftysomething perhaps?",1315353600,,1026,5.11377245508982

1516092,5,B00005JLFY,"I did not see ONCE AND AGAIN when it was originally broadcast and have only recently watched Season One after borrowing the DVDs from a friend who is a huge fan.  I also have Season Two to watch, as well as Season Three on tapes.  For years she has anxiously expressed hopes that Season Three will finally be released on DVD.  Sadly, the first two seasons are now out of print.  In every way O&A seems to be suffering unwarranted abuse on DVD.  Its fans are unable to obtain the third season on DVD and would be fans are unable to experience it for themselves, unless -- like me -- you have a friend who is a big fan.

Although a couple of things bugged me about O&A's first season, as a whole I found it delightful.  It is vastly better than the frequently offensive thirtysomething, which was not only offensive to women but passionately hated by many people (the only happy women were ""nesting"" women, while single, career-minded women were frequently punished by life for their presumption of desiring more than domestic bliss).  I know the show has its fans, but I know of few shows that has aroused as much out and out hatred as thirtysomething.  I bring this up because there is significant overlap between the creators and production staff of that show and ONCE AND AGAIN.  This was, to be honest, the main reason that I held off for so long in giving O&A a chance.

As anyone who has seen the show knows, ONCE AND AGAIN focuses on two people around 40 who meet and fall in love, as well as on their families, including kids and exes.  There is no real story in Season One apart from the interaction between the various characters.  Luckily, it is a great set of characters that as a viewer I quickly came to like a lot.  Sela Ward is splendid as Lily, the soon-to-be-divorced mother who meets divorced Rick, who is just as appealingly played by Bill Campbell (who most recently was seen on TV in THE 4400 as the enigmatic Jordan Collier and who endeared himself to me when he went on a public campaign to get a guest role on my favorite TV series [and evidently his favorite as well] BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, even offering, to the chagrin of his agent, to work for free -- that didn't work out but we'll see if he shows up on the new BSG prequel CAPRICA).  There are no real weak links on the show.  Those characters we don't like we are supposed to not like.  Most we do.  The on surprise for me is that Evan Rachel Wood, who I knew first came to some prominence on this series, has such a small role in Season One.  My friend the O&A fanatic assures me that she becomes more important in the series.

I'm truly surprised that this show did not manage to stay on the air.  It is not merely better than thirtysomething, it is much better than a show it somewhat resembles but it about to go into its fourth season, BROTHERS AND SISTERS.  But I long ago had to acknowledge that I have no clue as to what will or will not be a hit on American TV.  I find the entire CBS schedule to be nothing less than a horror story, while almost all of the shows I love are either on cable (where their low ratings are not a major issue, like MAD MEN, BREAKING BAD, and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA) or on one of the major broadcast networks, where they live perpetually imperiled lives (like DOLLHOUSE, CHUCK, PUSHING DAISIES, TERMINATOR: THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES, or ELI STONE).  So while at the end of watching Season One of this excellent series I am surprised that it didn't succeed, I remain grateful that at least I will get to enjoy two more.",1241568000,,3535,4.370030581039756

This series was fantastic, and I remember that the final season gave us some closure. During the last episode, I think the actors spoke about their roles and what had happened during the 3-year run.
It's a shame that the release of this 3rd season, which was announced and planned for early 2006, never took place..

1516186,5,B00005JLFY,"I do not know if I can take another television series created by Marshall Herskovitz and Edward Zwick.  When they came out with ""thirtysomething"" in 1987 it was like watching our lives on TV.  I can still remember all the married couples that talked about how they recognized themselves in the myriad machinations of Michael, Hope and the gang.  Then in 1999 they came back with ""Once and Again,"" and all I can is that I hate to think what would have happened if I was not already where the characters ended up in the third season, because if I was still in first season mode when this aired it would have been way too painful.  In fact, I would maintain that there will always be moments from this series that will threaten to rip off the scabs, twist the knife, or at least keep you up all night because they hit too close to home for those who have been involved with a divorce.

You might have heard originally the idea with ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" was for Mary Richards to be divorced, and they could not get that idea to fly because the networks thought audiences would think Laura had divorced Rob Petrie.  But divorces are so painful, despite their regularity on soap opears, that there have been other concerns with having a show that is about divorce.  ""Once and Again"" is more about life (and love) after divorce, and the series dodges a major bullet by making sure the principle couple to be are already divorced and separated respectively when they first meet and sparks start to fly despite the train wrecks that are their lives.  This television series might be too painful to watch for some (I want to be Rick but I know I am a lot closer to Jake and that conclusion certainly hurts), but that is what happens with shows that are real rather than merely being considered reality programming.

The fortysomethings in the main spotlight are Lily Manning (Sela Ward), who kicked her husband Jake (Jeffrey Nordling) out of the house for having an affair, and architect Rick Sammler (Bill Campbell), who has been divorced for three years from Karen (Susanna Thompson).  Lily works part-time at a bookshop with her sister, Judy Brooks (Marin Hinkle), while Jake runs the restaurant once owned by Lily and Judy's father, and Karen is a lawyer.  Both ex-couples have two children.  Living with Lily are Grace (Julia Whelan), an awkward high school freshman, and young Zoe (Meredith Deane), who has the ability to ask the pointed question at the wrong moment.  Living with Karen but frequently visiting Rick are Eli (Shane West), a high school junior who plays basketball and has some sort of learning disability, and Jessie (Evan Rachel Wood in the role that first got out attention), who is smart, thin, and working on her black belt in tae kwan doe.

Lily and Rick meet at the high school when Grace has an injured ankle and Eli has academic problems, and from the start the couple find they are embarrassments to their children (""Pilot"").  Rick is clearly smitten and Lily is surprised to find herself enjoying a relationship with another man (""Let's Spend the Night Together""), which is not easy when she finds herself working with his ex-wife at a school carnival (""The Scarlet Letter Jacket"") and her sister clearly disapproves of the guy (""Liars and Other Strangers"") and his involvement in Lily's life (""A Dream Deferred"").  Meanwhile the kids have resorted to parallel euphemisms: Lily is ""The Mom"" and Rick is ""The Dad"" and have to deal with their own teenager crises in terms of sprained ankles (""The Ex-Files""), out of control parties (""Outside Hearts""), and the revolving door of adolescent affection (""Sneaky Feelings,"" ""Daddy's Girl"").  Then there are the ups and downs of the love lives of both Judy (""The Mystery Dance"") and Karen (""Cat-in-Hat""), in the wake of Lily and Rick's romance, as well as Jake's ongoing involvement with young Tiffany (Ever Carradine) becoming painfully clear to Grace (""Letting Go"").

There is a major subplot in the first season regarding Lily's father, Phil (Paul Mazursky), who shows up for ""Thanksgiving"" expecting things to be patched up between Lily and Jake, who is clearly more like a son than a son-in-law, to Lily's absolute frustration.  Add to the interpersonal complications, which includes Lily's brother Aaron (Patrick Dempsey), the escalating financial problems of Jake that are putting the house that Lily and her daughters live in at risk (""Mediation""), and force Lily to go out and fin a job (""My Brilliant Career"").  As for Rick, Herskovitz and Zwick introduce him to a new circle of hell when who else but familiar face by Miles Dentrell (David Clennon), who has relocated to the Chicago area from Philadelphia.  The conceit of the series was the use of black-and-white ""interview"" segments where the characters admit to themselves things they would never say aloud.  This matters on ""Once and Again"" because getting these characters to say what they are thinking without being prompted by anger or fear is often difficult and our feelings towards Grace, Judy and Karen are tempered because of these moments where their pain becomes most clear.  The season ends with an indication that the genesis for this series might have been the romance between Lily and Rick, but that what it is really going to be about in the next two seasons is how these two families become one, while maintaining tangible links to the families they were in the past (""A Door, About to Open"").",1153094400,9,5446,4.80728051391863

1516188,5,B00005JLFY,"If you have not seen this series, I strongly urge you to give it a try.  Young Evan Rachel Wood is simply the best teenage actress in all of Hollywood!  My heart just ached for her, as her character dealt with the problems of her parents being divorced.  Evan, you are the best!",1141171200,6,278,4.2075471698113205
1516189,5,B00005JLFY,"There are very few shows in my lifetime that I have been fiercely loyal to, but the now defunct `Once and Again' without question, topped that short list.

I will admit that my lifelong crush on actress Sela Ward was my main interest in this series, originally.  Single, with no kids, and in my late 20s during O&A's debut, I was far out of ABC's target demographic for this show.  I didn't expect to like the show very much, but I got sucked in not because of Sela, but because the show was nothing less than fantastic.

Superbly acted and superbly written, ABC never gave this show a chance to find its audience, and it bounced around from time slot to time slot until it's all too early demise.  Even the best shows need to be pitched correctly to viewing audiences to have a chance.  The premise of the story is of Rick Samler and Lily Manning, two fortysomething single parents who re-enter the adult dating scene after their divorces. They fall head over heels for one another, and find that life and love in the (then) late 1990s is far different than what they remember.  Adding children, careers, parents, and ex-spouses to the mix just adds different layers of complications and challenges for Rick and Lily.

Most shows `jump the shark' at some point during their lifetimes.  While some could argue that the hostage episode in S2 was that point for O&A, I disagree.  Once and Again always presented two kinds of television : good, and better.  The stories and characters could fill you with hope, heartbreak, or both every week almost without fail.  And best of all - everything about this show was real.  Very little, if any, suspension of disbelief was required.

Perhaps the best thing I can say about O&A is that it is the only show that I was so passionate about saving, that I sat down and wrote a letter to ABC, asking them to reconsider their canceling of it (as part of an organized campaign with other fans).  While the campaign wasn't successful, the release (finally) of the series on DVD will allow those who loved this show then to enjoy it forever, as well as allow those who didn't get to view O&A during its run to discover it, and they too, might find out why we who followed this show from the beginning understood that this was just a beautiful story.",1136246400,11,2282,4.53170731707317
1516190,5,B00005JLFY,"'Once and Again' represented to me the highest point in television drama. This more-than-memorable series was no doubt one of the best to ever grace the airwaves.  Fine acting, brilliant writing, exceptional direction and noteworthy plotlines were the consistent standard for this series.  Not only did it excel in the heretofore mentioned categories, but it also broke some barriers for what television could do with a drama series.  Intimacy, nudity, sexuality, and other sometimes taboo subjects were handled with truth and honesty.  Deep character development was the standard not the exception...even for characters that had more peripheral roles.  The series was genuine.  I never felt a false moment.  I was heartbroken to see it end after 3 brief years.  Apparently mainstream Americans found this degree of depth in a television series too much to handle after a long day at work (or perhaps after 9/11)...or perhaps ABC did not promote it in a proper timeslot.  Regardless, My only solace remains that I can now revisit it from time to time thanks to the release of the series via DVD.",1133395200,8,1095,5.072625698324022

1516192,5,B00005JLFY,When Once and Again first began I dismissed it as a show for just women. But after watching just one episode I found myself hooked. This was unlike any show I had seen before. I actually found myself drawn into the lives of these two families. Once and Again is not just a show about two divorced people who find each other and start to fall in love. It goes much deeper than that. Once and Again follows the lives of two divorced people and the lives of their children as well. But then it goes a step further and it follows the lives of their ex spouses as well. With the first season we see how the relationship begins to develop between Lily (Sela Ward) and Rick (Billy Campbell) and how their ex's still play a factor in their love lives and how their blossoming relationship has an effect on their children. Once and Again was one of the finest dramas on television and if given the respect it deserved could still be growing strong today. Even thought it's time on television was short Once and Again showcased the acting talents of Sela Ward and Billy Campbell and launched the careers of Shane West and Evan Rachel Wood. I am just glad that we are able to enjoy this fine show on DVD and that they have finally decided to release Seasons 2 and 3.,1128297600,19,1255,4.322033898305085
1516193,5,B00005JLFY,"This is one of the finest shows ever to be put on television+a prime example why network executives are ratings driven clueless morons.  For a show of this calibre to be cancelled while dreck like Family Matters,Americas Funniest Home Videos+Full House are allowed to continue ad infinitim is unconscionable.  Rarely has television see a presence as luminescent as Sela Ward--I am beyond thrilled that she is back on TV in ""House"".  The story of two broken families trying to pick up the pieces and find happiness again is done so well it is almost heartbreaking.  Adults+children are given mature storylines+allowed to excel--especially Julia Whelan+Evan Rachel Ward.  Ward especially is as revelation--more so in season 2 where she is given as story line that should have won her an Emmy.  Shows like this are the reason TV was created.  The 3 seasons of this show contain more real heart and drama than a 7-10 year run of the crap on today.  This is probably the finest ensemble drama since St. Elsewhere.  I would give it 10 stars if I could",1126310400,7,1045,4.793296089385475
1516194,5,B00005JLFY,"""Once and Again"" is a prime example of what serialized dramas on television do best: dig in deep.  If this had been a movie based on the same premise--two divorced parents meet and fall in love and try to merge their families--there are whole oceans of emotion and conflict that would have to be glossed over or condensed just to fit into a two-hour running time.  But in an hour-long TV show that goes on for a few years, there's time to give everything the space it needs.  Thus you end up really sinking into the characters' experiences, and they become like members of your own extended family.  You almost feel as if you're experiencing these difficult moments yourself.  But to do this, a show has to be strong in every category: writing, directing, acting, everything.  ""Once and Again"" scores strongly across the board.

Others are raving about the kids on the show (Evan Rachel Wood in particular looks like she's turning into a really-truly movie star) and the much-lauded work of Sela Ward.  But Billy Campbell--who I had never liked until this show--is wonderful: his performance is subtle and deep, as his character goes through probably the worst trials of anyone's.  But there are also the supporting and guest actors, like the marvelous Marin Hinkle as Lily's sister, plus Steven Webber doing the best work I've seen from him in years, and David Clennon reprising his Miles Drentell character from ""thirtysomething.""

The black-and-white segments, by the way, are not arty affectations, they are key to why the show works.  The entire premise of the series might be boiled down to ""past choices affecting the present,"" and the B&W segments are almost always about something from a character's past that is directly relevant to what we're seeing them experience in the present of that episode.  Without these interview-style cutaways, the show would have been saddled with endless cumbersome flashbacks; but as is, you get important context on where the character is coming from without wasting too much time, so that each episode can move along at a brisk pace.",1123804800,8,2077,4.919770773638969
1516255,5,B00005JLFY,"Distinct from the scandal-happy nighttime soaps like Melrose Place or The OC, the nighttime melodrama has safer, more character-oriented stories to tell, and for the past twenty years, no one's been better at bringing the nighttime melodrama to the screen than the Herskowitz/ Zwick pairing that created Thirtysomething, My So-Called Life, and Relativity before coming up with their best show in 1999 with Once and Again.  Told with delicate humanity and enough intricate drama to become at first a guilty pleasure (I was a 17-year-old guy in high school when I started watching), and then just a pleasure, a rich and rewarding multi-character drama that was remarkably sure of itself right from its first episodes.  The show was inventive in its highly self-conscious - but also highly effective - use of the in-show interview with the character, black-and-white scenes of catharsis that really did seem to be eminating from the characters' subconsciouses.  But what worked so well in Once and Again was its ordinariness - the plain, unfussy performances by Julia Whelan as gawky teen Grace, Marin Hinkle's alluring work as sister Judy, Jeffrey Nordling and Susanna Thompson as the exes, and especially Sela Ward as Lily, whose tough and graceful work seemed to be earning every possible acting award for a while.  The show hit some creative dry patches in their second season - perhaps the reason season 2 has yet to come to DVD - but as concluded in its third season, it proved to be a resonant and cosy beacon of pure ol' drama at its best.  The fact that that season can't be seen is a shame, but until then, I'm happy to say I can watch the episodes of the first season over and over.",1109721600,8,1690,4.813793103448276

So it pains me to report how much I ended up NOT liking ""Once & Again.""  I'm not even really sure how to explain it, except to say that there was never a single moment, the whole time I was watching it, when I wasn't acutely aware that I was watching actors acting.  The whole thing seemed very artificial and contrived.  The adolescent characters didn't ring true for me, either, nor did the character of Lily's sister  ...  and since these characters are integral to the plot development, that left a huge believability deficit for me.

And there are also two more seasons of Once And Again still unreleased, so please Buena Vista or another studio whatever, release the remaining episodes of this Wonderful show !",1090454400,4,858,4.564935064935065

My sons and I watched every episode and we miss the series but we watch the Season One DVD together.  We hope they release the remainder of the seasons soon. Anyway....If you haven't seen this series, it is great.  It deals with real life problems and has real life characters.  Not one character is ""perfect"" and they all deal with their flaws as best as possible or remain in denial.  There were so many issues I could personally connect to.  This was a great series that got cancelled way WAY too soon.  Guess we will just have to view the 3 seasons over and over and over again....Once and Again.

Watching all of the episodes again reminded me of what a great show this was and how sad it is that it's not on anymore. These characters felt like a part of my life. The show was so well done and so real, that I actually felt like I knew these people. I haven't seen acting of this caliber on TV since the show was cancelled. We just don't have any quality shows on TV today that are targeted towards adults.
I emailed Buena Vista and asked about Seasons 2 and 3 and I never got a response. Let's just hope they realize there's a market for the remaining 2 seasons. I would so love to have the entire series on DVD to watch once...and again.",1078790400,4,708,4.064285714285714

This is Buena Vista's fault!! It took me hours of driving to find any store that even had this release on it's computer yet they had all the other shows released that day! I finally found it in Media Play... I've written BV many times.. but, they don't care.. why should they? They're part of Eisner's Disney profiteering. Hey, if you only care about money Disney?!

From growing pains to dating to dealing with family get togethers, every episode has a life lesson. I especially like that things aren't solved in one episode, but over time.  Like life, things don't get solved overnight.  I still can't believe that ABC cancelled this show and replaced it with ""The Bachelor"", ""The Apprentice"" and so on.  Shame on you ABC.  We needed shows like this,but instead we get the ugly side of life.  No wonder why the world is the way it is. Buy this season of ""Once and Again"" and please e-mail Buena Vista.

As a maturing adult in my 20's, I never taught that so many life lessons could be learned from a TV show.  The cast and their chemistry was incredible and were not given a fraction of credit they deserved.  Hopefully they'll read some of our feedback and see what they put together in the eyes of their viewers.
Each episode from the highs of life to the lows offered us a life lesson to walk away with.  Realistic with all the bumps in the road of life.  Like most shows out there, unless it is brainless comedy or some lame reality show that gets ratings in the US, shows like this one do not make it unfortunately.  I will cherish this set for the rest of my life and hope my kids view it the same some day.  Waiting anxiously for the 2nd and 3rd season to be released.

1516398,5,B00005JLFY,"Once and Again touched my life so much and I am forever scarred that it was cancelled at the time it was for it could have gone to do and express so much more. Without any doubt in my mind, of all the TV shows that I have been given the oppertunity to watch, this is the BEST of all time. Why? Because it's not a staged, comedy, or slackstick, reality, or evennormal drama. It's real life..
  Though I could only relate to one character, on account of being a teenager, I embraced all the characters with a full heart. The cast was amazing and one of the best I have ever encountered. Sela Ward was a most powerful and heartfelt lead, Billy Campbell a most worhty male lead. Julianne Wheeler was nothing short of amazing and incredible; to grasp so much reality into a single character and so young, is just uncomparable. The ever troubled Eli was a perfect match for Shane West, who played the character to the fullest, and Evan Rachel Wood really, truly showed alot of the show's colors. Perhaps the most unnoticed character is Suzanne Thompson for though she is ignored as her character and put aside as the mother of the two children now living with their father and stepmother, she is nowhere near that in her acting and skill. Probably in the top 3 strongest actors, she really makes us feel her pain, her loneliness, her desires, her problems, her estarngement, and depression. To Lily's sister, Jake, and his newly wed wife, Tiffany (forgive me, the names son't come up off the top of my head, you added a masterful support to the lead characters. As for that genius named Erik Stoltz, who encaptured the Mr. Demitri character like no one else  could imagine doing so. INCREDIBLE. A well deserved cast.
  And the writers, I can't write too much about them because they're talent and skill and understanding of how special and real this show is really turns speechless. A commending well done!
  It is a shame that it was cancelled but having the First Season on DVD (which was the only season I did not see) is liek having another family in your house, having emotions running all over the place. It is an incredible DVD set of the most accomplished TV show to date. Pick this up, for it will change your life... do not be discouraged by the main storylines, everyone has their story to tell and they will all unfold. Relatable to anyone in love, divorced parents, kids of divroced parents, adults who cannot find stability in their lives, who have to deal with mentally challenged family and the death of his/her parent. It appeals to any teenager that has a problem fitting in, or one that does seem to always fit in but has trouble accepting who she/he is or cannot seem to get a grip on life. To all those mothers and fathers, children, and the aunts, and the people who touch our lives forever.
  It would an even greater crime to not release all 3 season on DVD for only after the first season do we really see the challenges and relatable storylines that encapture our hearts and mirror our own lives: anarexia, learning disabilities, depression, social insecurity, teacher-student relationship, homosexuality, pressure of work, the costs of marriage and combining two families into one, bitter taste of divorce and marriage. It's all there, all the facets of our cultures, of our lives, of our unmerciful society.
  Buy and embrace it with all your heart and you will love me for recommending it but then again despise and hate me for I have brought you inot soemthing that you cannot get enough of and after a while of which you will not!
  Once and again i repeat, please release Once and Agin Seasons 2 and 3 on DVD, a treasure to keep, a gem to helop heel the problems and troubles of our lives, an escape path to a family unkown to others, only to ourselves. Keep the magic flowing, keep the emotions rising... Once and Yet, Again!",1056153600,8,3852,4.557163531114327

1516472,4,B00005JLFY,"""Once and Again"" is one of only a handful of television shows that are made for an adult audience.  Along with ""Judging Amy,"" it is a TV show that discerning viewers in their thirties and forties can enjoy.
With the prevalence of step-families in our society today, it's refreshing to see their concerns and challenges are portrayed thoughtfully and compassionately.  It is unfortunate that ""Once and Again"" didn't have a longer run.",1051660800,,433,5.0

If you loved it, it's worth seeing again and again - and if you have never seen it - it is a wonderful, heart wrenching show that you should definitely watch!

1516477,5,B00005JLFY,"Although hyperbole comes naturally to some of us Amazon reviewers (""the best ever!""), I have to say this is truly one of the best television dramas ever. What sets it apart is the wonderful heartfelt acting by a stellar ensemble cast and the intelligent, astute writing. The characters are fully brought to life and made real.

The writing and acting have such depth and nuance that you'll laugh with recognition and nod your head as every true note is hit.

Sela Ward deservedly received her share of awards from her role, but Billy Campbell -- who is just as exceptional -- unfortunately did not. But again, this is an ensemble cast, and every one shines.

When DVDs first came out, I did not expect to be buying television shows in the format. But ""Once and Again"" shows why the format is so perfect for this medium: You get to see the whole arc of a show's season at your own pace, and the quality of the image is perfect. If only there were some extras -- but then, ""Once and Again"" stands on its own.

Season 2 came out on DVD long after this set, and season 3 has yet to be released. Hopefully, it will eventually appear.",1049673600,10,1128,4.408653846153846

This show neither buys into nor opposes politically correct perceptions of relationships or divorce.  Instead it allows us to live through the emotions and difficulties of characters coping with post-divorce lives.  The presentation of sex is neither prurient nor judgemental.

1516603,5,B00005JLFY,I watched this show every day it was on television. I was really mad that they took it off the air. I was so glad when I saw that Once and Again was on a DVD.,1037404800,,158,3.4166666666666665
1516604,5,B00005JLFY,"""Once and Again"" was a wonderful, brilliantly acted series, that ABC thoughtlessly cancelled earlier this year, presumably to make room for quality shows like ""The Bachelor"" (a joke) -
Sela Ward, Billy Campbell and especially the younger actors continually amazed me with their work on the show.
As a fan of the late, great ""My So-Called Life"", I found this show just as effective in showing what its like to be human.
About the only storyline on the show that bored me, just a little, was the one that featured ""thirtysomething"" hold-over, ""Miles Drentell"", but even then, actor David Clennon managed to show us the humanity behind his character's weasel exterior.
Shane West, and Julia Whelan (who resembles Claire Danes) both were stunning as the older children, and Meredith Deane, and especially Evan Rachel Wood, as the younger ones, were brilliant.
Wood was robbed of an Emmy nomination for her work on the show's third season, where she  heart-breakingly portrayed her character's confusion over her burgeoning sexuality.
Finally, Susanna Thompson kicked out the jams during the ""accident"" storyline, and she, too, was robbed of an Emmy nomination.
A great series, that deserved another chance.",1036281600,63,1202,5.195876288659794
1516605,5,B00005JLFY,"I seriously love this show and when I heard it was going off the air, you have no idea how sad I was. Then I went to one of the web sites for the show and found out that season one was coming out on DVD. The acting and cast are terrific and I just can't wait to own this!! The only thing is that I began watching in the third season so I have no idea what season one is all about but I'm sure that it will be good. This show is soooo good and everyone who has never seen it should. Trust me, you won't regret it.",1035417600,,512,3.6636363636363636
1516606,5,B00005JLFY,"I was so excited when I read online that the Once and Again DVD set was coming out!!! I can't wait for the other seasons to come out too. I MISS THIS SHOW! I honestly thought they would bring it back this season and was shocked when they didn't. I was disappointed and frustrated when ABC canceled Once and Again. They were nominated for awards and won and they had a loyal fan base that fought hard to keep this show on the air. ABC conveyed the message to us fans that they are not concerned about what we want to see. Once and Again was such a quality show with great story lines and a perfect cast! I feel so cheated that the show was just left with no conclusion. I am still a hopeless fan wishing that ABC or SOME other network would come to their senses and renew this show so we can pick up where it left off. The same situation happened with My So Called Life when that was canceled way too soon. I guess there is only so much room for EXCELLENT t.v. and when a good show comes on that fans really respond to, they slap us in the face. I AM SO EXCITED to watch these DVDs!!!!",1034726400,6,1084,4.046511627906977
1516766,5,B00005JLFY,"that Once and Again is now on DVD. I live in England and really enjoyed the first series shown on cable here and had to get friends to tape season 2 and 3.  Just a fabulous, quality show that will be sorely missed. I intend to get a US Friendly DVD machine straight away so that I can again watch top class TV.  Why on earth ABC cancelled the series will remain a mystery, but they made a grave mistake.  ENJOY!!",1034121600,,412,4.061728395061729
1516767,5,B00005JLFY,"I gasped with excitement when I discovered that Once and Again would be given new life on DVD. I cannot express in words how disappointed I am that I no longer have this beautiful show to move me, inspire me, thrill me and uplift me. The powers that be at ABC have to be concerned with running a business and somehow, I understand that, but what I do not understand is how a network so bereft of creativity could have let this gem go because it wasn't getting the boffo numbers they would have liked. This show was no metaphor for real life, it was, instead, indicative of what real life is like for many of us. What performances on television or film could match those of this cast: the talented and gorgeous Sela Ward, the incredibly moving Susanna Thompson, the dynamic Evan Rachel Wood, Marin Hickle, Billy Campbell, a perfect Julia Whelan, Shane West, Meredith Deane, Jeffrey Nordling, Ever Carradine and Patrick Dempsey...this is a roll-call of excellence. Let's just hope we can get the 2nd and 3rd seasons on DVD as well. It is the perfect goodbye for a family that was forced to leave us way, way, way too soon. By the way, did I mention how beautiful and talented Sela Ward is? Oh, I did...well, it doesn't hurt to mention it twice, now does it?",1032652800,12,1255,4.4847161572052405
1516768,5,B00005JLFY,"ABC made a statement loud and clear when they cancelled this excellent show- that there is no room for quality family drama on their network. Fortunately, we now have the entire first  season available to us on DVD. The stories, as well as the acting, and direction are unmatched elsewhere on TV. The cast, especially the childeren are first rate. Order this DVD now, and get ready to laugh and cry. You will not be disapointed!",1032393600,2,428,4.631578947368421
1516769,5,B00005JLFY,"This is according to me THE best show ever made and the only show that managed to interest me for as long as it lasted (which, unfortunately, was only for three seasons). The acting is of top-level, just as the music composed by W.G. Snuffy Walden. In short, the show's about a divorced mum and an divorced dad who start dating each other at the age of 41, which not only affects their lives, but the lives of their children and ex-spouses as well. I think this is the strength of the show, because whereas other shows usually stick to two main characters, leaving the side characters ""in the dark"", this show puts every character in the spotlight, so you really get to know them all. Especially the kids turn out to be great actors (with Evan Rachel Wood and Julia Whelan as my personal favorites) and I hope to see more of them soon in cinema or on tele. Because the characters include all ages, from pre-teen till grandma, everybody can recognize him/herself in at least one of them (although I'm more a combination of several characters...) and find a way of dealing with their own daily problems. I'm from Europe, so unfortunately this item is not ment for me, but I really hope they'll make this item suitable for other DVD-regions as well, since this show did not only help people in the US, but all over the world. My advise for those from the US and Canada: buy it. For those from the rest of the world: have patience and pray.",1032393600,3,1436,4.443181818181818
1516770,4,B00005JLFY,"So sad this show was cancelled cause it was one of the few around where the writing and the performances (of nearly ALL the actors)were so in sync.

1516771,5,B00005JLFY,"I am very grateful the first season of Once & Again is coming out on DVD.  This is television at its finest.  The acting, scripts and music are wonderful.  All the actors are great but I especially enjoy watching the very talented young actress who plays Grace (Julia Whelan).  If you haven't watched Once & Again, treat yourself to some of the finest acting around.  It's a shame ABC decided to cancel this quality drama.  What were they thinking of??!!  At least we have the DVD to enjoy.",1030924800,7,490,4.5
1516772,5,B00005JLFY,"I love this show because every character has very realistic flaws.  It's not exploitative even when approaching sensitive storylines which is commendable.  The actors also give their best performances.  I should mention that the younger actors, like Evan Rachel Wood and Julia Whelan, are incredibly talented.  A lot of kid actors sound like 'they know their lines', but these two really bring a lot of emotion to what they're saying (esp. ERW).  I don't think anyone will be disappointed with this show when they watch it.",1030838400,,523,5.034883720930233

1516774,5,B00005JLFY,"""Once and Again"" was easily television's best domestic drama in recent years, and it is arguably the finest TV drama ever. It is complex, demanding, and exceptionally rewarding.  As such, O&A is not for the casual viewer; either you watch it fanatically or you do not watch it at all.  Seeing it produced on DVD is an encouraging example of the system working!  And please don't bad-mouth ABC for cancelling the show -- they tried really hard to keep it on, but they couldn't afford to do it because people that YOU KNOW were watching rubbish instead -- in massive, overwhelming numbers.  ""Once and Again"" is for the connoisseur, and it belongs on DVD.",1029542400,3,652,4.692982456140351

7940454,3,B00005JLFY,"I bought this series because of its many glowing reviews.  I really wanted to like it but was quite surprised to have a contrary reaction.  It symbolizes 80's TV, though it was created in the late 90's.  Being in the old 4:3 screen ratio just underscores how dated it is.  Amazon describes it as coming from producers of other 'Uber-Sensitive' shows (whatever that means) and, if that is your criterion for 'good TV', then this is the series for you.

The show centers around two couples -- the Mannings and the Sammlers -- both in the process of splitting up.  Lily Manning and Rick Sammler meet, and get together.  So far, so good.  Sela Ward plays Lily Manning in rather a poor man's version of Diane Keaton, cute at first but without her charm and warmth.  Their road is not easy, what with all the hiding and clumsy lying to their families they seem to think is necessary.  It is hard to believe that the producers and writers think that this could believably pass as adult behavior in any era.

One soon tires of their whining, indecision, and self-serving natures.  The wives and mothers are both self-absorbed and over-privileged.  Case in point:  while snogging Rick, Lily rolls her eyes when her husband's new girlfriend is mentioned.  Icing on the cake:  there is an Uber-Need to show the characters in B&W asides, commenting on their lives.  Sort of mini shrink sessions on which the audience is forced to sit in.  After the first several dozen of these, the Fast Fwd button became a welcome feature on my remote.

Billy Campbell, who plays Rick, is usually quite good, and is certainly handsome.  Though he seems to be best known for this series, his character is cloying, childish, and always shows up where he is least needed or wanted, and is the most awkward.  In fact, all the characters do this which passes for 'drama' in this context.

Rick seems to be the producers' idea of a WASP Everyman:  an architect, overly 'nice', apologetic, and self-questioning to the point of immobility.  At one point, he collapses and ends up in the hospital with pneumonia.  He didn't say anything to Lily because she might think he was a 'crybaby' (his word).  Oy!  He has a son, played well by Shane West, with whom Rick is alternately super-critical and overly 'concerned' -- the latter usually after Eli tells him off.

In the Manning family, Grace (the oldest daughter), is an annoying, self-deprecating brat with a dreadful self-image.  Her main activity is getting mad at her mother's commentary, and flouncing out of the room.  She becomes very slightly less cartoonish and mono-chromatic towards the end of the season.  A case of too little, too late.

The high point is Patrick Dempsey's wonderful cameo appearance as Aaron Manning, Lily's mentally and emotionally challenged brother who shows up for their father's funeral.  His performance is genuine (standing out for that alone), gentle, and moving.  It is the show's only moment of true gravitas.  There are a other touching moments here and there, but they generally just come across as pleasant but fleeting reprieves from the show's stultifying banality.

Grace sums up the premise of the show while writing a paper on global warming.  She contends that the generation before hers (i.e., her parents) were totally burnt out by living through Vietnam and Watergate, and now all they care about is themselves.  Every episode of the show proves her point.",1508544000,,3423,4.827882960413081
