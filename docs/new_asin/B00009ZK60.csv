It freezes my video, one video cuts off half the film and you cant see much, sound is horrible, his voice is off and so many mistakes. I can record the same things from YouTube that has better recordings.

WASTE OF MONEY.",1372032000,2,317,4.283333333333333
7994811,1,B00009ZK60,"This video has an extremely bad quality. They say it is old footage remastered but even the words at the beginning that state that, are blurry and fuzzy. I doubt their disclaimer was remastered too. I was able to return it with no problem. I do love Amazon! Also, the package had to be signed for which UPS and I had a hard time connecting. However the original delivery date was timely. I also ordered a book from this company which I will rate a 5 star.",1356825600,,455,4.241379310344827
7994812,1,B00009ZK60,The video quality of this video is horrid and I don't buy the excuse that it is because the footage is old.  Even the computer graphic opening menu is blurry and full of macroblocks.  Whoever mastered this video should be shot for this chump hack job! Save your money.  It is a shame that a video covering the grand master is so shoddy.,1208217600,,336,4.301587301587301
7994813,3,B00009ZK60,"Considering the film is 22 minutes long and the footage on this DVD is currently 40 years old, it is not a bad visual of Traditional Okinawan Matsubayashi Shorin-Ryu Karate...However, only long time and dedicated students of this system and style would benefit from this DVD the most for its historical emphasis.

All of the footage is done mainly at normal fighting speed.  Those studying the style will enjoy watching the performances of the kata as a visual reminder of what techniques are done in what order.

The only 'bunkai' seen on the DVD is of Pinan Shodan where the one performing the kata is 'attacked' by two other students who aid in the demonstration of how each technique of the kata is applied to defense.

There is really no audio except for the narrator explaining how old the film is. And nothing is in English (all descriptions of what is going on is in Japanese text) - so unless you are familiar with the style you might not know which kata is which. I, personally, was able to follow along from katas Fukyugata Ichi to Naihanchi Shodan. (aka White to Brown Belt level).

So, if you are hoping to learn a new style/system of karate by buying this DVD - your money would be better spent on something else.

However, if you are a long time student/Instructor of this System/Style and would enjoy an old video clip featuring Matsubayashi founder Shoshin Nagamine then this is the DVD for you.
