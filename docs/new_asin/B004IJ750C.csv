8430709,5,B004IJ750C,"I heard about this series on one of Jack's Survival Podcast episodes earlier this year. I found this good deal here. There is, of course, the ""reality TV"" portions of it, but overall it really makes you think.

Season 1 had people in a large warehouse in Los Angeles. There had been some sort of natural disaster (I forgot what it was right now). They were able to make odds and ends and had to go find water, purify/filter it, food, security, etc., etc. They had a variety of backgrounds, and you could see that Vladimir, who had served with Croatian military, and Joey, who had spent time in prison, each added greatly helpful feedback. Plus having an ER nurse, a doctor, a couple super-smart and resourceful mechanics and a scientist or 2 helped too.

Season 2 was in the South, I think Louisiana, the back story was a viral outbreak. The group had to work together, later 2 new people showed up, they had to keep looking for food and clean water, and every now and then another group would show up to try to attack them and steal things. Their goal was to get ready and get out of there, and they built a big windmill, caught an alligator for food, found a Recon Marine to befriend, and fixed up a boat into a swamp buggy to make it out.

In each show you could see how working with others was good at times and people butted heads at times. You need each other, like an adopted family thing. Each person had different skills and abilities, and some people really couldn't get along. The season 2 had a model who you could tell was used to having people do what she wanted.

It was informative and made you think about your survival needs if ever such events or similar events occurred, like food, water, shelter, energy, security. Planning ahead, continuing to learn, becoming more self reliant - all those things make sense, not only to help you and your loved ones, but also your neighbors and maybe new folks you may meet. Also hiding and splitting up your food, water, medical supplies, to make it less obvious to thieves. Also taking time to laugh and do some fun things so you don't snap.

The shows also make it pretty clear than security must be a high priority. When people are desperate they are not going to be friendly or cordial. In both shows it got pushed to the back burner, and in each case vandals and thieves created mayhem, stole, and damaged supplies.

In season 2 one girl was even kidnapped by 3 guys from the marauding colony. When you have food, water, energy, medical supplies, etc., some people are civil and can be allies, while others can be complete jerks and actually are very dangerous. So the better people can work together and form specific plans and responsibilities the better.

So, all in all it was interesting to watch. I will likely watch both seasons again to see what else can be learned. You really get to rooting for the colonists as time goes by.",1343088000,,2897,4.475378787878788

8430711,1,B004IJ750C,Super over priced set. Great tv show but you can buy each season for about $12 brand new. Dont buy this!,1325548800,,104,4.0
