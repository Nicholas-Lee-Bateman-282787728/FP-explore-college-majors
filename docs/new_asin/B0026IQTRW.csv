3853888,2,B0026IQTRW,"I was hoping this movie would have the same suspense and drama as K2 and Into Thin Air.  It did not.  The story was ridiculous...a brother flys halfway around the word to rescue his sister from Everest.  I'm not sure how he managed to gather all his gear, get there in time,hike to Everest an still think his sister was alive. The rescue almost laughable.  This is not a movie I would recommend watching.",1445212800,4,404,4.418918918918919

3853890,1,B0026IQTRW,Giving Shatner & Priestly top billing is a scam to get viewers interested in a very poor movie. Neither actor has more than a cameo appearance. Acting and filming are also amateurish. Watch a documentary on Everest instead.,1427328000,2,223,4.894736842105263
3853891,2,B0026IQTRW,"Jason Priestly does an amazing job in this movie. Unfortunately (without giving anything away) the part they hired him to play is stupidly small. If he was actually one of the stars, this movie could have been fantastic.",1418688000,,220,4.815789473684211
3853892,1,B0026IQTRW,"The acting is dreadful, the actions ridiculous. For anybody who has been in Himalaya, in high altitude it is so ridiculous it's embarrassing !  The producer and film director should have made it in locations closer to reality. ( I have been in high altitude many times, Himalaya and Andes)",1348531200,4,289,4.78
3853893,2,B0026IQTRW,"This movie was the worst acting I've ever seen. They took a tragic year and put it over the top with unbeliveable fight seen at 26,000 feet. Your lucky to move up their. The cimm and everest pictures were great but the acting was so bad it was almost laughable.",1333670400,2,261,4.24
3853894,5,B0026IQTRW,"I knew nothing about this movie before I rented it. I expected great visuals and got those in spades. Great cinematography. But the surprise was the good acting and story. The movie chronicles the 1982 Canadian Everest expedition. The tension and danger are well conveyed. Several deaths occurred on the attempts in an apparently terrible season weather wise.

I highly recommend this movie. High quality stuff.

Oh, Shatner is on camera for maybe two minutes total. But that's a good thing. He adds nothing to the story. The unknown actors who are the real stars shine brightly.",1295481600,12,579,4.958762886597938

8352723,5,B0026IQTRW,Everest for the Canadians was alot like it was for the Americans in 1996....a diverse group of men overcame personal obstacles and natures worse than can be thrown at  mountaineers and they survived,1480636800,,198,5.0
