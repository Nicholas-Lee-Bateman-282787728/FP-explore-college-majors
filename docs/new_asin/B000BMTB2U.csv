2425100,1,B000BMTB2U,This DVD was not what I expected.  It was for the most part quite depressing.  I was lookin for something more romantic considering the stars that were involved in each short story.  My bad !,1331769600,2,191,4.4
2425101,4,B000BMTB2U,"Film equivalent of intriguing short stories, highlighted by the inclusion of ""Please!"" starring Gerard Butler. When you watch this dramatic short, you surely will forgive him for ""The Bounty Hunter."" Quite frankly, I bought ""Guilty Hearts"" because it included ""Please!"" and was pleasantly surprised by the overall high quality of the entire film package.",1318032000,5,354,5.574074074074074
2425102,5,B000BMTB2U,"This is a story of several people who has many problems. I specially like the one with Gerard Butler ""Please"".
The only one I felt is was boring and don't want to watch anymore is the one with Charlie Sheen.
Overall is good",1312070400,,223,4.209302325581396
2425103,3,B000BMTB2U,"You take a glance at the cover and read the back description and you think ""Wow! An all-star cast in this one movie?! Why haven't I heard of this?"" well, I thought the same. I heard Anna Faris was in this movie and of course, I had to buy it, I own all of Anna Faris's movies that have been released on DVD. I rebought most of Anna Faris's movies on Blu-Ray. Okay, now on to the ""movie"", I have never disliked an Anna Faris movie in any way, but for some reason, I didn't like it that much. I found myself skipping to the Anna Faris short film, and I didn't think it was that great either. It's a good thing I got it for a reasonable price, don't buy it from Amazon, it's overpriced.",1309478400,3,683,4.029411764705882
2425104,3,B000BMTB2U,"So glad to be able to order this!  It completes my collection of Gerard Butler's films. Granted it's a short story and not a happy golucky one but I knew that before I ordered it. As you can tell, I'm a fan Gerard Butler's works and will continue to be so.",1309305600,4,256,4.019607843137255
2425105,2,B000BMTB2U,"""You have to let yourself go sometimes.""  A movie that has six short films that have nothing to do with one another.  This movie has a great cast, and thats about it.  Of the six stories, three deal with death (mostly suicide), two are pretty boring.  The one bright spot I will say is the ""Spelling Bee"" one.  With Anna Faris and Charlie Sheen (playing himself) commenting on a spelling bee they are watching.  That one was pretty funny, but overall a pretty drab and depressing experience.  This will be one of my shorter ones because it's not really a reviewable movie in the fact that all the little movies are about 15 min and would take to long to talk about every little film.  Unless you are big into the art house films you will not really enjoy it.  This is one that is definatly not for everyone.  Overall, not really that entertaining except for the ""Spelling Bee"" one.  Not much else to say. I give it a C-.

Would I watch again? - Nope.

2425139,2,B000BMTB2U,A straight to dvd release and easy to see why. This film is a short set of stories that tend to be pointless. Only buy if you are a fan of any of the actors and just watch the stoy there in.,1413763200,,190,3.5476190476190474

Dont let the bright coverart with smiling famous actors fool you- most of these shorts are about death or suicide, except one insane comedic piece. Shot on video or digital, the look of the movie detracts from it. 2 hours of your life you won't get back. SKIP.",1518480000,,310,4.7592592592592595
