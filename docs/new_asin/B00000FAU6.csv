On the cartoon she had a magical friend named Glomer he granted her wishes and she had the same friends Cheri of course her best friend. While on the television series she lived Henry who had adopeted her with her dog ""Brandon"" she had such a unique different style I want to say that I was a fad for a while she had her same friends as on the cartoon and Cheri was her best friend also I really did enjoy this series and I would recommend anyone who watched the tv series and the cartoon series to buy this video!!!!!",1067126400,,662,4.1395348837209305
