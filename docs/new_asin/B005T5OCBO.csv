Please remember these are the people that clean your toilets, that harvest your apples, that build your roads and do it humbly in the most devastating and harsh conditions.  The people that do your
dirty work for you and that do it with a smile.  I do not think that many people in this country are aware that we are legally running concentration camps in the USA where the people behind the fence
do not even have a right to speak.  This is an eye-opener about a situation that needs to be stopped.  We should not go out into other countries and judge how they treat and mistreat.  We should
first look at ourselves and how we treat and mistreat others.",1369440000,,853,4.435897435897436
