It is a great tale that has a little bit of everything, action, money, drugs, women, treason, government corruption, etc.... everything that you can think of comes out on this show.

I don't normally write reviews, but this show deserves the publicity.

3688320,5,B001LNSX9K,"This is the complete version of the Colombian TV Series ""El Cartel de los Sapos"". A bundle of 12 DVD (Part 1 and 2), plus a sample DVD of special fetures.
This is the Hispanic version of ""The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Green"".
The Plot:
This is the TV Series of a book written in jail by a former drug-lord. It tells the story of the drug business in Colombia after the death of Pablo Escobar and how the supply chain is maintained by new bosses once one is killed.
The Pros:
- This is the complete serie (Part One and Two) with 13 DVD. Please note that there is a new part comming up but it won't be filmed until November 2009 as Caracol says. So when you see DVDs of part one and two these refer to the whole series that was
aired by Caracol in Colombia and elsewhere.
- Region free DVDs.
- It was said that the quality of the DVDs where
not good. Mine worked perfect.
- This is not a typical ""novela"", these is the story of real people in the drug business.
The Cons:
- Just one language track in this version (Spanish) and no English subtitles available.
- The first chapter is slow and looks like a typical ""novela"" but when you start identiying whom they are really talking about you get stick to it.",1252713600,6,1206,4.136170212765958
3688321,4,B001LNSX9K,"Creo que la produccion,actuacion y realismo del tema y de los actores y actrices son puntos sobresalientes en la creacion y logro de este DVD. Bien logrado!",1252108800,2,156,4.814814814814815
3688322,2,B001LNSX9K,"Presumably if you're considering this DVD you already know something about the series. It's a good miniseries -- much more realistic than your typical Latin American telenovela. The problem is the DVDs -- one disk we can't get to play at all (on several different players). Other disks have problems with certain chapters, or will play up to a point then stop. As it was, I was annoyed, but if I had not seen the whole series on TV when it first played in the US, it would have made it impossible to follow. Even though this showed on Telemundo with subtitles in English, they are missing here. Considering that plenty of the dialogue is in colloquial, Colombian narco-slang, that makes it hard to follow for non-native speakers. There is a disk with some ""extras"" but nothing like what you would get with a US (or most foreign) films on DVD.

It's a good series worth watching, but it deserves a better quality DVD release.",1252022400,4,924,4.6
3688323,2,B001LNSX9K,"THE PLOT OF THE STORY WAS INTERESTING.  I KNOW THIS BECAUSE I HAD ALREADY SEEN IT ON T.V.

I HAD ORDERED AND PAYED A LOT OF MONEY FOR A NEW COPY THAT WAS NOT NEW AT ALL.  THE DVDS WERE LOOSE FROM THE CASE.  THE ITEM LOOKED LIKE IT HAD BEEN USED. I WANT TO RETURN IT.

8319237,5,B001LNSX9K,Can't begin to say how much we have enjoyed this series. What is baffling is that at the end it says more would be produced but no one can tell us if they have more or not.

8319240,1,B001LNSX9K,"I caught the telenovela bug from ""Pasion de Gavilanes"" and of course Paola Rey.  One glimpse of her and I was smitten.  I watched almost every episode on Telemundo with English subtitles. I then bought the DVDs and found that Carocal is pretty stingy on production expenses.  They cut maybe 75% of the show(just a guess).  So much so that I doubt the story line could be followed by watching only the DVD.  Of course I would like to get any other programs that Paola is in but I would want the whole series and not a severely edited version.  That sucked.  And that being said I watched a significant amount of and was interested in buying the El Cartel and El Cartel II DVDs but one word of the production quality and lack of English subtitles and I am out.  I am learning Spanish and the DVDs help but only with the closed captioning.  Come on Carocal.  You're losing a big piece of the market.  You already have all the footage and closed captioning for your product but you cut production value by leaving out huge chunks of the shows and no subtitles?  Why?  What's the point?  You know the business better than I do but it doesn't make sense to me.  No other TV show or movie that I have on DVD edits like you do.  You could have a great product but in my estimation you've missed the boat.  Not only have you lost a sale (on anything Paola Rey is in, El Cartel, El Cartel II and no telling where I would stop) to me but I certainly can't and won't refer a product to someone else,friends, family, etc. that comes up short.",1285545600,,1529,4.2717770034843205
8319241,4,B001LNSX9K,"Great series.  You really need to speak Spanish to enjoy this though, and better to see it with a Colombian that can explain all the parallels to the real cartels.

I originally bought some piratas while visiting Bogota.  They were crappy so I wanted to get a good set, so I bought them here on Amazon.  The reviews all said what a pity they didn't put subtitles in English, so I was prepared for that.  What I didn't consider, however, was that they didn't put ANY subtitles at all!

As an average Spanish speaker, I was hoping to read the Spanish and follow it better.  This  series could really be a useful teaching tool with all the slang and Colombian Spanish particulars.  So that was my biggest disappointment.  C'mon Caracol and think about business!!  These Colombian series ROCK!  I definately believe there would be a market for this and many other Colombian shows if there were subtitles!!",1264896000,7,901,4.6687898089171975
