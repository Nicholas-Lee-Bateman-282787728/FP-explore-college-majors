2258244,4,B0008EN6KO,"Wow, I picked this up cuz of a reccomendation on a Desperate Housewives forum I post on and I was totally surprised at the things that television shows can get away with when they aren't on American TV! If Desperate Housewives could get away with half the things this show does then it would be so much better.

The only real problem I had with it is that it was kind of short. But you get a lot of goodness in what is packed in there. I guess seasons for shows are a lot shorter in the UK then they are here, but it also keeps the cost down when we buy entire seasons so I guess it balances itself out.

If you're a fan of Desperate Housewives, get this DVD! You'll totally love it. I wasn't sure I would like it but I really did. It has nothing really to do with soccer like I thought it would from the title either.",1118620800,5,818,4.012269938650307
2258245,5,B0008EN6KO,"I saw this show on my satelite last year and I loved it. I just saw that it's coming out on DVD and I think anyone who loves good tv should check it out. It's better than most american shows since they don't have to worry about censorship. And don't let the shortness of the series turn you off, it's totally worth it. I missed one or 2 of them and I can't wait to see them all. I hope the rest of the series comes out soon!",1117497600,8,424,3.8295454545454546
2258246,5,B0008EN6KO,"I'm thrilled that Footballer's Wives is finally coming out on DVD.  This show puts the American soaps---from Dallas and Dynasty to Melrose Place and Desperate Housewives---to shame.  It's what Desperate Housewives aspires to be but can't (thank you FCC).

Outrageously funny and addictive---I was hooked after watching the first 15 minutes of it. (you will NOT believe some of the plot lines).

I highly recommend that you invite some friends over, put in this DVD and make a night of ""Footballer's Wives.""",1116979200,12,506,5.134146341463414
2258247,5,B0008EN6KO,"While vacationing in Europe last summer I was staying at a friends place and I caught a few episodes of this show. I must say it's very hot. The women are dead sexy and I guess the men aren't that bad to look at either. After watching just a few episodes I had to see the rest. Sadly when I returned home I found out that it was not on DVD here yet. So I am so happy that it is finally coming to DVD! I can't wait to get this. The shows I saw were from Season 3 and my friend said that Season one was even hotter! This show is a real treat. Like some other people said, if you like Desperate Housewives or Sex in the City then this show will be one that you'll wnat in your collection. Buy it, watch it, and then get your friends addicted to it! They'll love you!",1116892800,8,763,3.8662420382165603

They step over good taste, for compelling stories and outlandish plot lines. Sure it's akin to the likes of Desperate Housewives, but without waaaaay MORE than that in the way of craziness. It's worth a look gang, so do yourself a favor, buy a copy and then thank me later.",1116806400,8,434,4.4375
2258249,5,B0008EN6KO,"I am so excited someone is finally bringing this DVD to America.  Footballer's Wives is an outrageous dramatic series much like Desperate Housewives.  The concept is similar, housewives living in a suburban neighborhood who share their life tribulations with drama happening all around them.  The difference, Footballer's Wives are the wives of England superstars, the biggest soccer team (known as Football outside of America) in the country.  The wives are rich, sexy and so full of drama.  Sisters are sleeping with husbands, illegitimate children are found, nudity, drugs, alcohol and lots of sex.  There is also an attempted murder, charred body parts and a fairytale, truly fairytale, wedding.

Footballer's Wives is a MUST SEE show, it will hook you in the first five minutes!",1115251200,8,783,5.266129032258065

I actually never thought it would hit these shores again in any form but man I am happy it has. Kudos to those across the pond for sharing. This is a fantastic series.

Now if only someone would ship the great Aussie series ""The Secret Life Us"" that would really make my year. But I won't be greedy. I just hope we get more of ""Footballer Wives"". Major, major props for bringing this series to the US.",1115078400,4,538,4.123809523809523
2258251,5,B0008EN6KO,"Footballers Wives is a pure guilty pleasure. I was in the UK about two years ago and discovered this show.  It is currently in Season 4 in the UK and I have the first three seasons on dvd (thanks to my region-free player) It is more fun than Melrose Place.  Tanya and Jason Turner are the stand-out characters in this series and Tanya makes Alexis from Dynasty seem tame-(...) As there are only 9 episodes per season this show is a must-see without having to devote a whole week to watching a complete season. I highly recomend this.

From the moment I popped Footballer's Wive's-The Complete First Season in to view, I was hooked. Each character's life is fleshed out and fully realized, never leaving the audience feeling empty. The Footballer's wive's everyday-lives, away from the football field is where all the real action and drama takes place, there is never a dull moment in their world.
The writer's have created two main Footballer's Wive's character's in Jason and Tanya Turner who could singlehandly rival any villan from Dallas to Dynasty in survival skills.

 The series is at once, searingly accurate and achingly sarcastic. It's insanely addictive and abounds with beautiful people. A super, no holes barred, bitch, sex, drugs and rock and roll fest.

 There is a whole host of characters who mirror trashy B,C and D

Page three topless model/bimbo's, self interested, no brain, players, psychopathic managers, social climbers, schemers and uber bithces!

2258325,5,B0008EN6KO,"Footballers Wives has become one of my favorite television shows to rent since I don't have cable.  It has everything you could want in a cheesy soap opera: sex, drugs, promiscuity, depression, family problems, etc.  The characters in this British comedy are shameless and over the top and it's hard to gauge what they'll do next.  This show takes no prisoners and if you liked the late years of Melrose Place with a bit of NBC's Passions and a hint of Desperate Housewives, this is definitely the show for you.

The show focuses on the members of the Earls Park football team and their wives.  The couples are:

Jason and Tanya: Jason is the team's captain, and Tanya is his wife (therefore the most important person as far as the women are concerned).  Jason and Tanya's relationship is volatile and hanging on by a thread, but neither one of them will do anything about it.  Instead, Jason is consistently unfaithful and Tanya drowns her sorrows in booze and cocaine.

Kyle and Chardonnay: Kyle is one of the team's rising stars and he is engaged to the beautiful Page Three-model (basically topless pictures) Chardonnay Lane.  Theirs is a fairy tale romance and Chardonnay has every intention of making that known with her over-the-top Cinderella wedding theme.

Ian and Donna: Ian is Earls Park's newest striker and he's on his best behavior to fit in well with the team.  He's been with his wife Donna since they were teenagers, and they have two children to show for it.  The problem is that their first child was given up for adoption and Donna can't stop thinking about him.  This puts Ian in an awkward position because they were just kids then and he just wants to be happy with the success they've garnered after all this time.

A few of the single, and more infamous, characters on the show include Kyle's mother Jackie who constantly nags Chardonnay and still lives at home with her son, Donna's sister Marie who fancies herself in love with Jason and will stop at nothing to get him, and newest Earls Park member Salvatore Biagi who everyone is afraid will step in and take Jason's spot on the team.

This show is addictive and if you give it a shot, it won't take long for you to become hooked. I can't wait for the third season of DVDs to arrive.",1150156800,5,2263,4.592039800995025
2258326,5,B0008EN6KO,"I recently purchased both seasons of Footballer's Wive$ and eagerly await the release of season 3.

This series from BBC follows three football players and their wives.  Jason Turner is the captain of Earl's Park Sparks and  married to cocaine addicted and chaos driven Tanya.  Kyle Pescoe and Chardonnay Lane are newly married and adjusting to Chardonnay's anorexia and inability to have children while Ian and Donna Walmsley are dealing with infidelity and the abduction of their daughter.
In addition to the main characters, there is a slew of second tier characters to stir up action sich as Frank Laslett the owner of the football team, Stefan Hauser the coach and Salvatore Biagi the newest member of Earl's Park who challenges Jason as the best player on the team.

This show is highly entertaining and hilarious.  Some have called it ""Compulsory TV"".  If you have enjoyed other British television shows I suggest you give Footballer's Wive$ a chance.  It can be viewed on BBCAmerica on sunday nights though they are currently broadcasting season 5.

Sure makes American television look tame and even boring.  I immediately ordered the first two series off Amazon.com to see what happened before the 'season' I'm currently watching.

  I don't want to to write about any plot events on this show and give anything away, especially since the ""Seasons"" are only around 8 episodes.  Trust me and trust all the other positive reviewers when we say that this show is unbelievably sexy, shocking and just downright addictive!

If I had a 'Tanya' in my life I'd start running and never look back!

This series is fascinating trash with an ever so obvious twinkle of irony that knows when art imitates real life.

You only have to glimpse shows featuring footballers' cribs, or those airheaded savant non-entities comment on the fabulousness of in infamous/famous and their goodie-bags and you're right there in the La-La-Latida-Land of escapism and the slightly surreal. The exception is though that this series is actually interesting because it is sooooo O.T.T. (over the top).

Why not indulge in the machinations, and celebrate with real Schadenfreude the ups and downs of people who have (in the series) more money to throw at their Gucci bags than braincells to use?

Watching the series becomes slightly addictive but is also a great way to relax - not too taxing, but keeping you teetering on the edge of ""I want to know what happens next...""

2258344,3,B0008EN6KO,"The series is great. That is why I was generous and gave this DVD collection 3 stars instead of 2 or 1. But the DVD is completely lacking in some very tastey and funny bonus features that the Australian and British DVD set is full of.

The Australian DVD set, which was my introduction to the show, is full of outakes and cast interviews. And the second season has a full length special called ""A Day with Tanya Turner"" But for some reason the American distributors of the DVD decided to only thrown in a slang dictionary and call it a day. And that is completely unfair.

Great series nonetheless but one of the best things about going out and getting a DVD is always the bonus features and Capital Entertainment could have very easily included all the special features from the British Series one boxed set the way the Australian DVD set did but it chose not to. And that's unfortunate.

The only alternative is getting series one and two from Amazon UK. Problem with that though is it would require having a region free DVD player, and even if you did paying the GBP price for it which is probably too expensive just for the special features.

2258345,5,B0008EN6KO,"I stumbled across this first season set, having never seen it, and thought it was similar to Coupling.  I took a chance and what I found that while very unlike Coupling, it had it's own style that keeps you watching.  This is primarily a drama, but it does have it's share of laugh out loud scenes.

Every one of the 8 episodes on Season 1 has all sorts of scenarios and crazy new things developing.  The one thing I just noticed after watching it all, that except for maybe Donna and Ian's son that they originally gave up, there are really no innocent, completely likable characters. I mean someone is usually ending up cheating, lying, or deceiving someone else!  No one, and I mean no one is anywhere near sainthood in this one!

This close knit team and their families is a very interesting watch, with spot on performance by every actor in their roles.  The German Team Manager use to play Alistair in As Time Goes By and was very funny in that.  While he takes on a more serious role in this, he is again completely fun to watch.  The actress who played Judi Dench's daughter in As Time Goes By also makes an appearance as a physician.

All the characters get into so many heated confrontations, deceptions, and flirtations, you have to just keep watching and watching to see what will develop.  Another exciting program from the British.  Keep 'em coming!",1131321600,19,1363,4.540983606557377

Even in its heyday, Melrose Place could never have compared to this.  I mean, in the very first episode alone there's a marriage on the rocks, a child given up for adoption eight years earlier, a slutty sister-in-law, a meddling mother-in-law, infidelity, a lingerie model (named Chardonnay, no less!), a fight, a coma, a cocaine habit and frontal male nudity!  How's that grab ya?

As the episodes progress, you'll witness even more shocking sights including what has to be the *tackiest* wedding ever (and that dress!) as well as one totally messed-up outrageous nurse.  Your jaw will drop as you witness what this woman is capable of!

This show more than makes up for all those years of snooty Masterpiece Theater the UK's been sending our way.

And I must thank whoever had enough sense to include subtitles on this DVD!  Some of the characters have incredibly thick accents.

2258361,5,B0008EN6KO,I just discovered this show while channel surfing for news (Our press is useless) and I came across Footballers'Wives. What a show! I have no idea which season I'm watching but Jason appears to have washed his hands of the delightful Tanya. I've told anyone who'll listen to me about this show.  The next thing I'm doing is getting my hands on the first season and making a party of it.,1127520000,2,386,4.436619718309859
2258362,5,B0008EN6KO,"This is a very well-done show. I was very pleased with what i got for my money , I am looking foward to season 2  and Beyond.",1126915200,3,125,3.6296296296296298
2258363,5,B0008EN6KO,"Who the heck compared it to desperate housewives?  there's no connection!  This is an excellent trashy and soapy tv show,  there is no way they would make a show like this in the U.S ,  British tv  is far more provocative than in the U.S (except cable ). In the series  there's nudity , foul language , funny and completely disturbed characters and lots of plots and  twists. Don't get turned off by the  football in the title , there's not much of football in there, I hate football myself,

too bad there's only 9 episodes per season , but believe me a lot is happening in every episode so I suggest you to order the rest of the seasons from amazon.co.uk! Tanya Turner (Zoe Lucker) is the bitchiest person on tv!",1125273600,3,714,4.348484848484849
2258364,5,B0008EN6KO,"This show is fantastic.

I am a big fan of British shows (Eastenders, Little Britian) and I had heard about this from friends in the UK and reading Brit Mages like Hello and OK.

I had been waiting with baited breath to see it and man was it worth it!

It has drama, it has humour, it has it all (including a few nakey scences in the Sparks locker room!)

The story line is so great and it is easy to see why people compare it to Desperate Housewives (a fan of that here as well!).

Some of the language is a bit hard get if you are not a Brit TV fan already, but it is fairly simple to figure out the slang.

I love this show and cannot wait to get the rest of the dvds as the UK is about to begin airing season 5 and here we are at the begining!!  Hurry get more out soon!!!",1124841600,3,776,3.8125
2258365,3,B0008EN6KO,"The show is OK, but I don't know what all the hype is about.  It hardly resembles Desperate Housewives.  People say this show is racy and daring, but take away the little bit of curse words and minor nudity and the show doesn't even compare to the shows in the US.  Sometimes I had to rewind and put the subtitles on because I couldn't understand their accent.  So to get to the point, the show is alright but not close to Desperate Housewives, and to give you the heads up, most of the nudity in the show are the guys butts in the locker room, so men don't get too excited, and I hope this is not the reason why women think this show is so over the top.",1124323200,2,654,4.046511627906977
2258366,5,B0008EN6KO,I love it!  Don't expect this to be Sex and the City.  It's more like a drama series.  I find it very entertaining.  Great DVDs.  I'm waiting for Season Two.,1120780800,3,157,4.1
2258367,5,B0008EN6KO,"I heard about this show from other friends. When I saw it was coming out on DVD - I had to get it. And, I'm so glad I did. Finished the season in 4 days. It's dishy, fun, great soap. I can't wait for Season 2.",1119571200,2,209,3.5652173913043477

8055862,5,B0008EN6KO,An excellent series that was on BBC several years ago. I watched all the seasons. It was great. All about an English soccer team and all of it's players.,1435881600,,153,4.310344827586207

8055866,4,B0008EN6KO,"I chose a four star rating because of the multiple sub plots, relationship overlaping and fast pace delivery. They  kept the show fresh and interesting. At times  the thick accent of some of the characters was dissapointing. It made it hard to understand what they were saying. However, with time I got use to it. I would recommend this dvd to anyone who enjoys soap opera like drama.",1393113600,,384,4.632352941176471
8055867,4,B0008EN6KO,Love this series sexy and silly and over the top humor and story lines.  Nobody lives like this but its too bad they don't.,1390176000,,123,4.125
8055868,3,B0008EN6KO,"Ok, so at first I thought ""this is like watching a reality show, and not a good one!"" However despite some definitely cringe worthy scenes, it is sickenly addictive! I watched the entire first season within a week. Now I have to order the second season to see whether Chardonnay will have the baby, or if super chavs, the Turners, get away with murder. Sooooo if you want to be entertained  but not stimulated, grab a bottle of moonshine and watch Footballers Wives!",1325894400,,466,4.614457831325301
