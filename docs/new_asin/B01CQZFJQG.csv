8753911,3,B01CQZFJQG,Have a bit of a problem with a mother or any one trying to control their family from their grave.  I got the point but not enthralled with it.,1527379200,,142,3.896551724137931
8753912,5,B01CQZFJQG,"This series is like no other.  I've gotten a lot of crime/drama imports lately because I don't like Hollywood ""drama"".  These people are real and the story line is so life-like.  What happens with this family probably happens more than we know.  One of the best.  I'm not even bothered by the English subtitles anymore; in fact, I prefer them to Hollywood's lack of language.  Very little cursing, every other word is a word, not an ""f"" word.  Great portrayal of family and neighbors, friends, business, crime.  It's got it all.  I would highly recommend Thicker Than Water to anyone.  It's got what it takes.  It held my interest--I usually fall asleep, but this kept me alert and awake.  I didn't want to miss a thing!  Great.  I can't say enough Greats for this one.
I can't wait for Thicker Than Water 2 which is due in February 2018!",1510099200,6,838,4.5369127516778525
