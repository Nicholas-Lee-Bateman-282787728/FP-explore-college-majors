Though weve been through years and years of James Bond movies and they all have the same basic recipe  impossible action, exceptional photography, superb stunts, beautiful women and a solid cast  this SPECTRE for this viewer beats them all.  Sam Mendes directs a committee script (8 writers including Ian Flemming original characters)), uses a fine cast, allows us some of the beautiful views of many countries and the result is a completely satisfying experience  for Bond lovers.

The story line (much like all the others) is as follows: A cryptic message from the past sends James Bond Daniel Craig) on a rogue mission to Mexico City and eventually Rome, where he meets Lucia (Monica Belluci), the beautiful and forbidden widow of an infamous criminal. Bond infiltrates a secret meeting and uncovers the existence of the sinister organization known as SPECTRE. Meanwhile back in London, Max Denbigh , the new head of the Centre of National Security, questions Bond's actions and challenges the relevance of MI6 led by M (Ralph Fiennes). Bond covertly enlists Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) and Q (Ben Whishaw) to help him seek out Madeleine Swann (Lea Seydoux), the daughter of his old nemesis Mr. White (Jesper Christensen) who may hold the clue to untangling the web of SPECTRE. As the daughter of the assassin, she understands Bond in a way most others cannot. As Bond ventures towards the heart of SPECTRE, and its head Blofeld (Christoph Waltz) he learns a chilling connection between himself and the enemy he seeks.

Splendid locations, terrific opening graphics, fine musical score by Thomas Newman, and magnificent cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema all add to this echt James Bond mood. Grady Harp, December 17",1514678400,2,1769,5.058419243986254
