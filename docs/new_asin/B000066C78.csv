7962157,5,B000066C78,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bandidos/dp/B000066C78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bandidos</a>&nbsp;I am writing this rebuttal because I do not consider the two critiques already posted fair to the DVD advertised and or to Vanguard International Cinema.

Although the film transfer to DVD is not perfect, I beg to differ about its quality. Compared to some DVDs I've purchased, its caliber is not bad. My disc has none of the major flaws written about in the two reviews already posted; save maybe several minor league glitches, in all probability, carried over from a transfer from VHS to DVD.

I found the print quality clear, and not blurry or grainy at all - and my screen is 70"" on a diagonal. The color is fair to middling, with a mild sepia wash overall that in my opinion, lends charm to the movie, giving it an old-world look `round about the period of 1913, when the story takes place. In a few minutes, after becoming involved in the action, this is not paid attention to anymore; it does not detract from the picture one bit.

However, I am writing this commentary so as not to spoil future purchases of this movie. The story and acting is first-rate and should be enjoyed by everyone, and not be critiqued primarily because of its transfer problems. As to the Subtitles; they are quite readable and although a bit off-synced at times, I found no errors particularly to annoy me. This is the way it was translated into English. The negative reviews are greatly exaggerated; do not shame Vanguard International Cinema. The movie is a gem and we are lucky that they put the film out on DVD.

7962158,3,B000066C78,"""Vanguard International Cinema"" literally vandalized this movie and turned it into some sort of almost bootleg DVD. The movie seems to have been taken from someone with a camera inside a cinema, the image is horrible and it destroys the beautiful photography work in the film. This DVD is grainy, old looking, blurry, and simply stated: nasty. The other big problem in this DVD release is the sound, it is very low and very badly edited. The speech often gets overwhelmed by background sounds and there are often changes in the volume of speech and background, as well as music. I will not talk about the English subtitles as they are aweful too (bad translating, and often off cue) and cannot be removed from the screen. This is one of my favorite films, the people who released this DVD however should be ashamed, it is almost worth throwing to the trash because that is what they did: trashed a piece of art. Try to see this movie in a cinema, or in another version so you can appreciate the beauty of the colors, the scenic views of Mexico's provincia and nature, and to appreciate what is said in the film.
I am hoping someone will release a better version of this film; I would be willing to pitch in for that effort.",1185494400,5,1223,4.513513513513513
7962159,1,B000066C78,"It's a shame that a very good movie like this, it's been sold with such a lousy quality. The transfer looks like it's been done from a positive worn out print-ultra contrasted, scratched, dirty image. I'm no talking about a few spots on the frame, I'm talking about that it's virtually impossible to even look the entire film. I even feel like asking for a refund. I had the chance to enjoy this film in its theatrical release and the cinematography out of Emmanuel Lubezki was stunning, there's nothing left of it in this DVD. The people at vanguard-cinema should be embarrased for distributing something like this.",1038787200,18,616,4.766355140186916
