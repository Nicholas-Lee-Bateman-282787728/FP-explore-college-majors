7028471,5,B00U2YNNSA,"First off if you know me I love a good documentary, the more reality that builds in the process of the film, the better the subject unfolds. What a perfect documentary. Simple put, a great film. I don't mean that in a light hearted way, or just a matter of fact setup. I truly mean this is something unique, fresh and absolutely mesmerizing. A true gem in the film world. Penny Vozniak aced the reality of creating a memorable piece of cinema that lingers in the emotional department of the watcher. Jennifer Lynch, daughter to the master David Lynch is chronicled in this behind the scenes style film.

Jennifer went to India to direct her new film HISSS. There over the period of creating the film, she slowly, through one obstacle after another, loses her grip and sanity while being filmed, equal parts comical, and equal parts frustration. This is truly a modern classic. This is a landmark film on the exploration of directing a film, yet also the personal hardships, struggle, and comical undertaking of creating a film while balancing, being a mother, and life's problems, which are always up's and downs.

This is priceless documentary that is a must see, must own, and must be experienced. I felt deeply enthralled with this film. I love the personal reality of the documentary. This is a film that will remain in my conscience as a thought provoking and powerful teaching tool on the horrors and wonders of film making.

proving one's strength and independence
 being a single mom and wanting to provide your child with adventures and experiences
 surviving addiction
 experiencing culture shock and the battle to stay open minded and diplomatic when your boundaries are crossed
 how visiting vs. working in a country that is not your own are 2 very different things.
 the beauty of some of her co-workers and some moments which captured the uniqueness of India without overly-romanticizing it",1502409600,,523,5.329268292682927
8704287,2,B00U2YNNSA,"Good as a human interst story. II had empathy for the direction. Anyone who has spent time in India knows how hard it is for things to get accomplished and as she said, mostly well meaning people but the whole culture is not one of 'alacrity' in results, far from it. maybe cos I stay clear away from horror films, when ti got to the bathroom scene about 1/4 of the way into the movie, i just turned it off since the story itself of the movie being made was too far from anything I was interested in. So in that way, maybe my 2 stars isn't fair but for me, didn't want to finish watching somehow.",1492387200,,596,4.102564102564102
8704288,4,B00U2YNNSA,"Here's the short of it.  Despite the Gods is a behind the scenes look at the making of the American / Indian horror-comedy-musical-drama Hisss ( also known as Nagin: The snake goddess).  You'll witness the clash of cultural differences on filmmaking and gender roles as this disater of a production slips through the fingers of Lynch as she trys to hold everything together as her pre-teen daughter watches on.

I found it interesting and enjoyable and well worth the time as a Lynch fan.",1456531200,,488,4.785714285714286

8704290,5,B00U2YNNSA,"Besides being a very beautiful documentary in itself, I felt that the presentation of the experience of making a film was accurate and heartfelt.  I worked for a time as a case manager at SAG, and I remember spending many hours listening to the experiences of producers and directors.  It didn't take long for me to begin to really wonder how any film ever actually got made and marketed.  The hassles of trying to produce a work of art that requires the gathering and coordination of a large group of people are practically endless.

Based on my experience, I felt that Jennifer Chambers Lynch seems like an incredibly mellow, generous, tolerant and patient individual.  Not only is her inherent talent obvious, but she clearly possesses other characteristics that add up to a great director.  I certainly would like to have the opportunity some day to see the film featured in this documentary edited according to her vision.

Besides Ms. Lynch, the documentary features a bunch of very appealing and dedicated people, not the least of which is her daughter, who pitched in and opened herself up to the experience with a wisdom that seemed beyond her years.  I liked the sense that her daughter was experiencing a sort of apprenticeship in this experience.  The lead actress was also the complete opposite of a diva, being willing to do what it took to get the shot, and obviously having a great deal of talent at interpreting the director's vision as well.

Finally, I was charmed throughout by the Indian people shown in the film, whether they were actual members of the film team, or bystanders enchanted with watching the making of a film.  The locations were made beautiful, even if shoddy or distressing, such as the scene with a woman fishing garbage from a gutter-like flow of water through a laundry ghat.  I also liked seeing the way that the spiritual lives of these people were so closely incorporated into their work activities.

This documentary is actually about rather a lot of things, beyond simply focusing upon the experience Ms. Lynch had while directing the film.",1448755200,3,2086,4.842253521126761

8704293,5,B00U2YNNSA,"Thank you Jennifer Lynch!  This documentary captures the beauty of the people of India.  Jennifer Lynch is a rare bird who knows how to see and tries to show what she sees.  What comes through most strongly for me is the character of this woman who is tough and endearing, creative yet disciplined, loving yet still a fighter, I just loved this and am very inspired.  There is hope for us all.",1433548800,2,393,4.416666666666667
8704294,5,B00U2YNNSA,"Amazing.  Truly a film that any filmmaker or film lover should see.  Jennifer is inspiring and what she had to deal with during the production of ""Hisss"" is not something any director/writer should endure from their production team.",1433289600,,232,5.078947368421052
8704295,4,B00U2YNNSA,"I've seen Hissss and I figured it would've been a chaotic shoot. What I didn't expect is that most of the issues seemed to have stemmed from Jennifer Lynch. At least, it's the way it seems after watching this documentary.

Lynch is an interesting case. She makes one movie that's basically a more honest 50 Shades of Grey way back when in Boxing Helena and got massively attacked for it, which feminism back then was a different animal and even then I'm not Tumblr would be cool with it. Eventually after about 15 years, she came back with a really good Rashomon styled serial killer thriller in Surveillance. What I didn't know is that apparently she also came back after getting back on the wagon.

If this is her on the wagon, I can't imagine what she was like off. She's perpetually in a state of being totally frazzled and much of it appears to be of her own making. The most telling scene to me was when she yelled about people littering and that she didn't mean to be an ugly American but she didn't want to hurt the planet while claiming she knew she hurt the planet. Not only was it hilariously culturally insensitive in the way she went about it since in that part of the world being scolded by a woman is a bit on par with being caught in the middle of a crime but it was also hilariously self righteous. The assistant director seems to want to genuinely help her too but her unwillingness to adapt to the culture and allow him to translate some of her stuff to others to keep the cultural friction down starts to weigh on them all as the documentary goes on. When the main actress clearly needs pep talks, Lynch provides them with literally screams of screw society and this culture gotta change type stuff while all of the crew stand around and watch a bit shocked. If Lynch is anything, it's utterly unaware of life outside of western, white, liberal, and rich California.

I've dogged on Lynch a lot here but she's talented even if she is a bit of a bore here. The editing doesn't help her but they want to entertain after all. Having seen Hisss and having watched this movie, I got a good sense that she had an interesting idea that just went south on her due to being way out of her element and comfort zone. The difference between shooting a small film with people she knows and relates to and being on the other side of the world with her kid, who is maybe the best behaved 12 year old I've ever seen and real trooper through all the craziness, is immense. If it wasn't enough of a challenge, she's making a film that's completely different from absolutely anything she's done before and it requires way more than just a good for small scale thrills and drama.

The crew doesn't help either. In a certain sense, if you're in a society like that and you sign on to a film directed by a woman, you'd think they'd be ready to make concessions. It went out the window quick for them. So, it's certainly not all Lynch's fault.

I've talked a lot about what's in the movie but what I really like about this is that it's essentially an actual documentary. It's not a romantic ode to a film not made like say Jodorowsky's Dune or Lost Souls for Richard Stanley's Island of Doctor Moreau. You're watching an edited for time's sake and entertainment at the expense of Lynch version of the whole thing going down. It's unobtrusive in a way many of the recent film documentaries are not. Also, there a certain humor in the fact that the documentary cameraman always turns his camera to the lead actress even as Lynch blows her top off screen. When the biggest intrusion of the film makers is accidentally letting their crush be known, it's pretty funny.",1432684800,2,3660,4.432392273402675
