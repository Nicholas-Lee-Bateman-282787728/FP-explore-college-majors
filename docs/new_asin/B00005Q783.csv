1645459,1,B00005Q783,"Given the brilliant baritone Bryn Terfel stars in this FALSTAFF, I found that the only attractive aspect of this performance.  The sets and costumes are overly stylistic and rather surreal, and all rather disgusting, with lollipop trees, rolling hills and the first scene of the second act, with food spilled all over Falstaff's table is really gross.  Even Terfel cannot escape the muck. There's a scene where he's wearing a diaper in an incredibly disgusting bodysuit.
I owned the video for a few months and ended up selling it.  Unless you must see Terfel in the title role, buy it, but I'll wait until a later effort comes along in a better production.
Honestly, this was one of the most awful productions I've ever seen.",1059868800,10,725,4.784
1645460,4,B00005Q783,"The sound and picture of this DVD is definitive in terms of modern technology. The overall approach is also very modern so far as costumes and settings are concerned: the colours of both are so simple and yet so exceptionally rich. It's as if one is reading a comic or a cartoon with human faces. Such treatment  might well be justified for a comic opera of this nature and by doing so, they may well be able to attract young comers to the operas, or they may be bored of the realistic approach...
As pointed out by most viewers, Terfel's acting and singing were wonderful and he was well supported by his partners, not just Barbara Frittoli but almost all other singers and above all, a wonderful orchestra.
Viewers with a sharp ear for orchestral support might mistake this to be Vienna Philharmonic, for it sounds as good as Vienna Philharmonic! The orchestra is so full of life and colours giving the sort of sopport to singers that could even rival Gerald Moore on the piano. It's most rare eversince Furtwangler. Menuhin once conducted the Russian State Orchestra, making the orchestra sound so warm and full of colours that you wouldn't believe your ears. Bernard Haitink is such another magical conductor which is by and large extinct now!",1059091200,4,1247,4.720183486238532
1645461,5,B00005Q783,"This is the only version of Falstaff I've ever seen or heard and I think it's pretty [darn] good! The very bright sets and costumes take a little bit of time getting used to, but once you do, they are very effective and fun.
  I think the cast is excellent! Bryn Terfel obviously loves the role and is determined to be a lovable rogue. His singing is gorgeous, as usual. Barbara Frittoli as Alice Ford is not my first choice, but I like her. All the other cast members are wonderful as well. My personal favourite is the man who played Fenton. I can't remember his name and ...isn't printing the cast list, but he was a very good actor with a beautiful lyric voice. It's also nice to finally see a black tenor on the opera stage (who's not singing Otello).",1040601600,5,756,4.316901408450704
7949848,3,B00005Q783,"Kind of gross portrayal of our knight.  The sets are a little Daliesque, not to my liking. Great singing though, every one did well.",1479168000,,132,4.5
7949849,5,B00005Q783,"This is a very funny production of a very funny opera. Bernard Haitink, in his brief interview, remarks that it is like champagne and sure enough, it really does sparkle from start to finish.

Graham Vick, the producer, comments that he sees this as very much an Italian opera. He stresses the Italian origins of the story upon which Shakespeare based his `Merry Wives of Windsor' and he stresses the medieval nature of the story. There is thus just a short step to applying the vivid colours of the Italian medieval world to this production. Speed is also of the essence and he remarks on the similarity of this opera story to similar stories found in `The Canterbury Tales'.

The staging makes use of this world of extremes in its design and in its use of colour. Interestingly, years later, Dover Castle has been re-opened and presented to the general public specifically with the colours, fabrics and social artefacts that are now believed to be true to its medieval period. These are remarkably similar to those found in this production. This vivid staging has been an obstacle to total enjoyment for some people who have seen it as unreal. Now, it seems, the historians have shown Graham Vick's instincts and ideas to be close to medieval reality.

The cast are as close to a dream team as it is reasonable to expect, let alone demand. Bryn Terfel makes a wonderfully over-large characterisation of Falstaff. This suits both his costume and his voice. Barbara Frittoli leads the team of four excellent Merry Wives in a totally engaging and merry way. It is obvious that great enjoyment has been had in this production by these four women. Roberto Frontali makes an excellent Ford as are Peter Hoare and Gwynne Howell excellent as Bardolph and Pistol respectively. Without going through the rest of the cast and individually singing their praises, let it be said, in my opinion, that all are equally excellent in all their various roles.

The orchestra is on top form with precision playing bringing out every pointed or barbed musical phrase as well as extraordinary lightness of touch. In all of this it would be hard to over-praise the conductor, Bernard Haitink.

There are short interviews with Haitink, Terfel and Vick as extras plus a documentary describing the refurbishment of the opera house up to the opening night.

The camera work is very involving and gives clear imaging and the vivid colours as intended. The sound is presented in excellent 5.1 surround format. The recording was made in 2000 and is still of excellent quality.

This has long been a favourite recording of mine of this opera and, given its undoubted performing excellence, it seems hard to imagine it failing to give the great majority of purchasers considerable pleasure and satisfaction. This is not the only way to present this very fine opera of course, but in my opinion, it is certainly a most enjoyable way or experiencing it. As a result, and in my opinion, it is an easy 5 star issue.

Some dialogue from the comments section that may offer further help:

An Excellent Review with lots of interesting detail, Ian!
Bryn Terfel Jones is absolutely my Favourite Bass-Baritone - what a Personality! What a Voice! I assume you have his DVD Concert at the Concertegebouw (pronounced ""Konzert-KHE-bow"") in Amsterdam... (U.K. review)",1391990400,,3367,4.945132743362832
7949850,4,B00005Q783,"The newest addition to a crowded and distinguished DVD field for Verdi's final (greatest?) opera comes from Glyndebourne 2009. Richard Jones's production places the action in the England of the 1940s. Jones recently received brickbats for a severely updated Munich LOHENGRIN (Decca), in which Lohengrin wears a T-shirt and track pants. The temporal facelift given FALSTAFF is inoffensive, although it fails one test: the update leads nowhere that justifies it, so it seems novelty for its own sake. Say what you will about Robert Carsen's Salzburg ROSENKAVALIER (recently reissued by Arthaus; see review), but Carsen followed through on his impulse. There proved to be a rationale for his transplanting the opera to the Vienna of just prior to WW1, and his production could not have worked in the Vienna of another period, whether the 1740s (as prescribed by Strauss and von Hofmannsthal) or the 2000s. Jones's FALSTAFF is a more arbitrary affair. The Blitz does not begin in the Windsor Park scene, nor does the opera end with Fenton going off to fight the Axis powers, with the implication that he may die. The opera seems to be taking place late enough in the war for optimism and good humor, perhaps the mid-1940s. Fenton is an American GI, which creates an interesting context for his having met Nannetta, and perhaps for her father's disapproval. But as the lone way in which the time and place are relevant to the play on stage, this is thin.

The wartime setting is most welcome for allowing uni-monikered set/costume designer Ultz to give us many loving and detailed recreations of that period's clothing, architecture, and furnishings, some amusing (in Act II Scene 2, rather than strumming a lute when Falstaff arrives for the assignation, Alice puts a scratchy 78 of lute-strumming on the Fords' record player). Indeed, Ultz's craftsmanship does much to sell Jones's concept. Sets are attractive, ingenious and elaborate, and Jones creates a bustling, lively community to come and go from them. Act III Scene 1 gives us a street-level view of the Garter Inn, Falstaff's room of which is on the second floor and recessed (this works better on DVD than in the theater). That scene's monologue is delivered as a rueful life lesson to the innkeeper's rotund adolescent son, who stares and gapes at Falstaff, hardly moving for the entire scene (I was reminded of David Lynch films). Simultaneously, on the sidewalk out front, the plotters conspire, and the inn is seen as part of a city block, with supers entering and exiting shops. Windsor Park is one of the spookiest on video, and Jones and Ultz make a veritable Halloween party of the masquerade -- the update allows them to costume Ford as the Lugosi Dracula, Pistola as the Karloff Frankenstein's Monster, and Bardolfo (in drag to marry Caius, of course) as Elsa Lanchester's Bride of Frankenstein. Props are used to help the humor along and to emphasize points. At the inn, there is an orange cat (a life-like puppet, getting laughs from the Glyndebourne audience) which Falstaff tends to stroke when discussing desirable women. I will presume the subtext is clear, for further elucidation would get this review flagged. In Act I Scene 2, when the women excoriate Falstaff (and, by implication, licentious men like him) and begin to plot his comeuppance, a rowing team walks by holding a long, narrow boat overhead. Subsequently, Alice Ford removes from the ground and proudly holds a prized lettuce from a row of same. Again, the symbolism is not opaque.

Once again, we have a FALSTAFF DVD with pretty women, and their period hairstyles are as fetching as their retro clothing. Once again, the mezzo playing Quickly is the odd woman out, made to look much less attractive than the singer is in real life. The production's idea for the character is an interesting one, though. She sports a drab uniform of some military or civil-service type, an unflattering wiry hairstyle, and Coke-bottle glasses, and has a decidedly butch demeanor. She concludes Act III Scene 1 by picking up a young woman on the street, and they walk off hand in hand.

An operagoer encountering this cast in the theater would go home happy, feeling that Verdi's music had been honorably served. Once the performance is preserved on a recording to be evaluated against those in the catalogue, matters get more complicated. The FALSTAFF videography boasts Falstaffs from Taddei (young and old), Bacquier, Bruson, Plishka, Terfel, Raimondi, and Maestri; Fords from Colombo, Stilwell, Panerai, Nucci, and Frontali; Fentons from Alva, Araiza, Lopardo, Tarver, and Flrez; Alices from Carteri, Kabaivanska, Ricciarelli, Freni, and Frittoli (thrice); Quicklys from Barbieri, Valentini-Terrani, Ludwig, Horne, and Di Nissa; Nannettas from Moffo, Hendricks, Bonney, and Mula. This is to say nothing of the singers who have taken the parts on audio recordings. There is one Italian name in the Glyndebourne group, that of the Pistola (Paolo Battaglia), and the international balance shows little of ""learned"" italianit or Mediterranean warmth and fullness of timbre. FALSTAFF is the least vocally challenging of Verdi's standard-repertory operas -- nothing in it is as exhausting or potentially lethal as certain roles in NABUCCO, VESPRI, and OTELLO are -- but anyone who has heard FALSTAFF sung at the highest level will know what he or she is missing at key moments. Nevertheless, these cast members have their points as musicians and comedians. The best of them, perhaps, are Blent Bezdz's Fenton, Dina Kuznetsova's Alice Ford, Jennifer Holloway's Meg Page, Marie-Nicole Lemieux's Quickly, and Battaglia's Pistola. Christopher Purves's Falstaff is pleasantly sung and middle-of-the-road in characterization -- neither the most lovable nor the most contemptible nor the most profound Sir John. The fat suit is convincing. Had the production not continued a regrettable recent trend by having Falstaff undress in one scene, I would not have known it was padding.

Leading the London Philharmonic Orchestra, Maestro Vladimir Jurowski does not exceed expectations, but that is only because they were very high. He does not disappoint, either, but the reading seems still to be gestating. It is professional and vital without being as individual and striking as his best performances in German repertoire have been. The first Quickly/Falstaff meeting is conducted as though Jurowski has some booming Italian mezzo of the Golden Age in the part of Quickly; the less amply proportioned French-Canadian one he actually has is fighting to sustain and breathe. At Windsor Park, Falstaff's observation that love transforms man into a beast is rather rushed through, needing more of a beat to sink in. Jurowski is a staggeringly gifted conductor still in his thirties; as such, anything he does is of interest. Perhaps he is still finding his way in Verdi. My impression was of a very good FALSTAFF by someone who will lead great ones. Near the end of the opera, in the midst of the fugal finale, director Jones incorporates the young maestro into the staging in a way I will not spoil. It is almost worth the price of the DVD by itself. (Among great Verdi/FALSTAFF conductors, the thought of Toscanini, Karajan, or even Muti going along with it sets the head to spinning.)

Two DVDs of FALSTAFF are essential above all others: the Serafin/Graf telefilm of 1956 (on VAI; lip-synched, sadly not as well preserved as it should be, but with an extraordinary cast) and the 2001 Muti-conducted performance with reduced La Scala forces occupying the Busseto Teatro Verdi for a recreation of a 1913 production (EuroArts). Although the Jurowski/Jones is not vocally special enough to join those on the top tier, it is colorful and engaging, and a prominent place should be made for it in the ranks of the honorably mentioned.",1288310400,8,7836,5.094941634241245
7949851,5,B00005Q783,"Saw this production at covent Garden when it re-opened The House after it's colsure for refurbishments during the late 90's and have been waiting to purchase the DVD for many years.
Bryn Terfel is Sir John Falstaff, and is certainly the funniest and greatest Sir John's that I have seen/heard. Barbara Frittoli is equisite in the role of Alice Ford. Terfel and Frittoli have great communication and stage precence as indeed most of the cast do under the strick batton of Bernard Haitink.
I loved the staging (dircted by Graham vivk and designs by Paul Brown) vibrant yellow and blue designs create a feeling of pantomime/cartoon as indeed this is a great comedy of life as Sir John expresses at the beginning of the fugual finale ""The whole world is a jest...but he who laughs last laughs best"".
If you want originality, great singing and acting, and above all a real laugh then don't look further than this version of Verdi's Falstaff",1216857600,,935,4.777777777777778
7949852,4,B00005Q783,"This last weekend I spent a few hours comparing this DVD with the Von Karajan Falstaff DVD.

Many elements of this performance are superior to the earlier performance. Formost is the quality of the sound. The video quality is likewise superior. Both are videos of live performances but this performance was better captured.

Giuseppi Taddei was one of the finest baritones of the twentieth century. He had a repertoire of over 250 roles. He was famous for his Mozart roles as well as Verdi, Rossini, Puccini and Giordano. He was never a high baritone like Milnes or Warren. But on the other hand he could sing many basso buffo roles like Leporello. In short he could have been called a bass-baritone as Terfel is.

He had a very big personality. I saw him several times as Leporello. As Scarpia he just about ate all the scenery. In short he was an exuberant performer - again rather like Terfel.

So who's the better Falstaff. Terfel. Frankly I was surprised. I had recently done a similar comparison of Terfel's Don Giovanni DVD with the Von Karajan DVD. In that comparison Terfel came up far short of Sam Ramey's performance. But as Falstaff, Terfel is supreme. The voice is just right. It's large, rich and expressive.

Alas the other baritone - Frontali - is nowhere near as good as Rolando Panerai on the Von Karajan set. Panerai recorded Ford several times. It was a sort of specialty for him. He's sensational.

Barabra Fritoli is quite wonderful but perhaps a bit to young and glamorous. Raina Kabaivanska is also a beautiful woman with a beautiful voice but she's, as seen here a bit older, which provides more verisimilitude. Kabaivanska also milks the big sweeping melodies for more more juice than Fritoli. This may be because she phrases better or it may be that Von Karajan is a better conductor than Haitink. I know that I admired Fritoli's singing but I cried when I heard Kabaivanska.

Verisimilitude is a major problem with this set. The Von Karajan setting is psuedo Globe Theater. It looks Shakesperean. Taddei appears as slightly down on his luck former man of some repute. He is overweight and he's getting on in years but he's still a formitable human being. Terfel on the otherhand is shown in an over the top fat suit. He would weigh at least 400 lbs if all that were really flesh. Furthermore he seems to have a skin disease. He is not just unattractive, he's grotesque. To look that extreme makes it hard to understand why Alice and Meg are initially flattered by his letters. It would be like getting an unsoliticited love letter from the Elephant Man.

The young tenor(Tarver) on this set sings very, very well but I'm afraid he's black. His race is just another element that contributes to the unreality of the performance. Maybe that's unfair, the sets make no effort to place this piece in Elizabethan times although the costume do. It is all rather surreal. So are we to accept that a black man running around in seventeenth century London would provoke no comment. But if that's so why did Shakespear make such a fuss over Othello?

Tarver does sing better than Araiza (another surprise) but Araiza's performance comes off better probably because of the conducting and the staging.

Christa Ludwig is a major disappointment in the Von Karajan set. She is after all a rather high mezzo who has had a lot of success in soprano territory. In Falstaff, Mrs. Quickly is the bottom voice. Ludwig is simply too light. Her voice does not contrast with that of the Meg Trudeleise Schmidt. Meg is a mezzo role and Quickly is better done by more of a contralto. Bernadette Manca di Nissa in this the Haitink set is much better.

The Von Karajan set has wonderful comprimario tenors - Heinz Zednik and Piero De Palma. It also has Frederico Davia, who is perfect in the part of Pistola although Gwynne Howell actually sings Pistola better in the Haitink set.

The main controversy over this production is Falstaff's giant erection that seems to gained the DVD an 'R' rating. That didn't bother me so much - in fact its an Elizabethan sensibility. I was more concerned with the sense of unreality lent by the sets and staging. Falstaff in Henry the Fourth Parts One and Two is a true tragic figure. In The Merry Wives of Windsor he is much less deep but still he must be sympathetic or nothing means much. In this the Haitink-Terfel performance Falstaff is just a grotesque buffoon. The more traditional Von Karajan-Taddei set is often less well sung (again to my surprise) but it is always more affecting.",1208304000,4,4527,4.694829760403531
7949853,5,B00005Q783,"Falstaff is G. Verdi's hardest nut to crack.  The main reason is a noticeable lack of long flowing melodies and arias commonly present in Italian opera tradition.  Another is that, more than any other operas, the theater is as essential as the music.

This BBC presentation is a true marvel.  It is a feast for the eyes.  The young cast can sing and act.  The stage direction is flawless, capturing the energy and humor of the piece.  If you are curious but hesitant about Falstaff, give this DVD a try.",1135382400,4,503,4.522222222222222
7949854,4,B00005Q783,"Is the other reviewer serious about the ""R"" rating in the USA? In Australia this film has been rated PG - which means children can watch it but it is recommended that parents guide them. That's the same rating as ""Home Alone"" and other such innocuous Hollywood comedies. Weird.
Anyway, this production certainly is colorful. In the right mood I find it a riot. In the wrong mood I find it unsubtle and overdone, even gauche.
But Terfel's Falstaff is tremendous in spite of absurdly unrealistic stomach padding. Frittoli's Alice is beautifully sung and acted, and Mistress Quickly's motif was still impressed on my mind the day after watching it, such is Bernadette Manca di Nissa's fruity tone.
Fenton (Kenneth Tarver) and Nannetta (Desiree Rancatore) make an enchanting pair physically and vocally, flirting with the kind of extrovert style encouraged by the production.
I've never heard anything badly done by Haitink - he is a reliably excellent conductor and this is no exception. The Covent Garden orchestra articulate the shifting motifs of Verdi's score splendidly.
In the right mood, a very enjoyable night at the opera.",1088121600,13,1128,5.06989247311828
7949855,5,B00005Q783,"English people have a special affinity to this opera being based on a Shakespeare play (Merry Wives of Windsor). So it is small wonder it was picked for a special new production at the newly renovated Covent Garden. And it is certainly a very good production and probably the best one available in a visual format.
Specifically, the direction is highly innovative(dir. Graham Vick) and the sets by Paul Brown are very imaginative and brilliant with primary colors (there is something of a circus about it) which introduces the necessary lightheartedness and humour, so often missed in other productions. Just to mention a few examples: the first act scene 1. takes place on a huge red bed tilted towards the audience and there are several trapdoors opening in and out.(The bed is like a huge trampoline upon which people bounce up and down, while Falstaff is sitting or lieing on it, drinking wine -absolutely hilarious.) The second act scene 2. is also very colourful with a big yellow baldachine over the bed and the third act scene one with several hunting trophies in a row used as a hiding places and taking a life of their own at a most unexpected moment, is truly inspired humour. The elements of surprise here are remarkable.
Musically, this is Bryn Terfel's finest hour in the role of Falstaff. His voice and characterisation are beyond comparison. Barbara Frittoli's youthful soprano voice , terrific acting and good looks as Alice Ford,  are worthy foil to Terfel. Roberto Frontali as Mr. Ford is  a strong baritone; his duet and famous aria in the 2nd  act comes off well. The other, supporting, roles are no less creditable. Manca di Nissa as Mrs Quickly should probably require a special mention.
 Haitink is definitely up to the task in this contrapunctal score (again I am referring to the Meistersinger which is no less contrapunctal). Verdi must have learned something from Wagner, but his synthesis has an Italian quality and this points to his genius.
Haitink does well with the 'a capella' ensembles in the first act and in the final fugato finale. These are a real tests for a good conductor.
This performance should be very satisfying to most viewers. There are of course stick- in- the mud pedants, who cannot relate to anything but the traditional, but I am sure there will be many listeners who would welcome a change.  Most enjoyable.",1078617600,20,2361,4.834158415841584
7949856,5,B00005Q783,"Please, don't listen to the reviewer below who says the production is disgusting. He must be a person scared of everything original or slightly different, please don't listen to him.
First, the cast. No need to say anything save that it's great, spearheaded by Bryn Terfel and Barbara Frittoli. Second, the music, just incredible, with the RPO conducted by Bernard Haitink, just amazing! Now, the sets: This part may be the most controversial, if anything just because of it being original (and very clever, I'd say). The sets are very colorful and cartoonlike, which only adds to the comic feeling of this greatest of comic operas. David McVicar is I think, the greatest set designer of our time.
Trust me, you can't go wrong with this one.",1071705600,9,741,4.84251968503937
