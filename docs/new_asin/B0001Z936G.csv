8018765,5,B0001Z936G,"I saw this movie years ago and really liked it.  Is it weird to say that I was obsessed with the gang leader's hair?  Such an awesome sweep of black hair. I also really liked that chair backpack.  The acting was OK and I like the happy ending, which is not always common in Chinese films.",1400716800,,288,4.107142857142857

8018768,4,B0001Z936G,"At the end of the movie an older woman calls a band of rovers that invaded her farm a bunch of barbarians. But are they? A group with pride, code and honor and also lovers of theatre. They are led by a widower/actor.
The woman is a bitter old woman who lost her husband decades ago and can't let go, and everyone else around her has to suffer. Will pure love conquer it all...?

It's a great movie, maybe slighty too long but the real great stuff is in the last 10 minutes when all the themes come together.",1182729600,3,507,4.121212121212121
8018769,4,B0001Z936G,"I heard about this movie from a friend who said she saw it for a college class and enjoyed it so much she just couldn't stop thinking about it. We had to search for it but it was worth renting when we finally found it.

At the beginning of the movie, the girl in the story is traveling to marry a man she has never met and is being carried (in a sort of backpack-chair harness) on the back of a man who ends up falling in love with her.  He is apparently from a lower social class than she is and is probably not considered fit to have anything to do with her besides transport her.  When the girl is forced to marry a statue of her husband-to-be (because he unexpectly dies before she can meet him), her mother-in-law is extremely cruel to her and makes her a prisoner in her home.  It is up to the guy who brought the girl there on his back to come save her with a band of tough guys that he befriends.  The movie is fun and suspenseful.  A great little adventure.  Four out of five stars only because, though very enjoyable, it is not a perfect film.  Just a really good one. I'm definitely buying it, now that it's on dvd. Finally.",1139875200,20,1135,4.104072398190045
