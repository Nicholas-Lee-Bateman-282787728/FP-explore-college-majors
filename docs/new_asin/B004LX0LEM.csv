8435238,2,B004LX0LEM,Great book....horrible documentary.  Could have used more narration and much less interview material.,1430006400,,101,6.769230769230769
8435239,2,B004LX0LEM,Not what I expected.  A bit boring.  Middle aged adult surf freaks who reflect on their own druggie adventures and travel.  Costa Rica.  More rap than surfing.,1417392000,,159,4.777777777777778
8435240,1,B004LX0LEM,I would give it zero stars if I could.  It was done by some random fan of the book. Terrible,1410998400,,92,3.6
8435241,3,B004LX0LEM,The film is mopre a documentary rather than a movie about the book.  I loved the book and hoped someone would make it into a movie.,1370908800,,131,4.038461538461538
8435242,5,B004LX0LEM,"First off, I had read In Search Of Captain Zero many years ago ad many times.  It's one of my favorite books.  When I saw this DVD, I had to have it.  Great companion to the book.  I suggest that any future buyers read the book first, then watch the DVD.  You won't be disappointed.  Khan!",1362009600,3,289,4.071428571428571
8435243,4,B004LX0LEM,"If you are a fan of the book I think you'll like/appreciate this dvd documentary.  I am amazed these 2 ""Cosmic Rangers"" are still alive...and surfing!!!!",1331424000,,153,4.884615384615385
8435244,4,B004LX0LEM,After reading the search for Capt. Z I found myself planning a trip to Costa Rica.  This film got me even more excited to go down there.  The story is well laid out and it shows how big a role surfing can play in one's life should we let it.  Viva Zero!,1318204800,,253,3.826923076923077
8435245,5,B004LX0LEM,"As a huge fan of the book ""In Search of Captain Zero"" (which I read while living as an ex-pat in Costa Rica), I was happy to discover someone had made a documentary about the main characters in this quintessential road trip memoir. The author- and the friend he searches to the ends of the earth for- were such compelling figures that they fairly begged for a ""where are they now?"" And the filmmaker delivered on that, taking us into the currents lives of the two estranged surfers buddies, as well as shedding light on their outrageous backstory as pot smugglers in the freewheeling 70's. It would be wrong to give away the ending, but it's well worth the trip to see where these two friends end up in the end. It helps to be a fan of the book this doc is based on, but either way, I would highly recommend this film to anyone interested in surfer counter culture or a just good dramatic documentary filmmaking.",1299110400,5,912,4.434523809523809
