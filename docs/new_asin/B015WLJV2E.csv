7452672,5,B015WLJV2E,5 year old loved it.,1454371200,,20,3.2
7452673,5,B015WLJV2E,Very sweet and funny with a good foundational message. It speaks to prejudice and challenges the way we tend to judge situations without engaging our intellect.,1454198400,2,160,5.1923076923076925
7452674,2,B015WLJV2E,"Not a bad film, but certainly not good. There's never a point where I feel drawn into the characters or plot.",1453593600,,109,4.238095238095238
7452675,1,B015WLJV2E,"this movie is absolute garbage. at one point it spells KUM SHOW in big letters behind a robot named kum....... the voice acting doesnt line up with the animation. its like a bad martial arts movie without the martial arts. horrible production, terrible animation, catastrophic voice-acting by c-class actors/actresses, and a storyline so backward and pointless as to not really be a storyline. hate this movie. hate everything about this movie, and hate everyone involved in making this movie.",1453507200,,493,5.253164556962025
7452676,5,B015WLJV2E,My 8 year old son loved it he said 5 stars!!!!,1453507200,,46,3.272727272727273
7452677,2,B015WLJV2E,Boring with plotlines that move slowly and make no sense.  2 stars because the graphics were good.,1452384000,,98,4.764705882352941
7452678,1,B015WLJV2E,"It didn't hold any one of my  6, 7 or 11 year old grandsons' attention for even half the movie.",1452038400,,95,3.75
7452679,2,B015WLJV2E,"This is a case-in-point that it takes more than pretty graphics for a good CG movie.  I watched it with my kids, hoping they'd like it, but we turned it off after 15 minutes of boring dialogue, lame characters, and an uninteresting plot.",1451865600,,237,4.511627906976744
7452680,5,B015WLJV2E,"Really cute and has some good lessons in it-  about following your dreams, being true to yourself, standing up for yourself, and being a good friend. I didn't think i could like a movie about robots so much, lol.  But the characters really were brought to life and made you care about them. Russell Peters was very funny, and Bella Thorne was a great counterpart to him and they complemented each other well. I also enjoyed Gregg Sulkin as the weird bird robot, he was so cute and funny. I think the performance by Russell Peters steals the show though. The lessons learned are definitely worthwhile for children to learn about, and the movie is just cute and funny.",1451260800,,666,4.588235294117647

8734753,2,B015WLJV2E,This movie was not good. The voice acting was terrible. The plot made no sense. I'm glad I didn't pay for this movie. Not sure how it's getting above 2 stars.
