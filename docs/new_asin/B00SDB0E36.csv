8698151,4,B00SDB0E36,"The outsize success of several worldwide-known languages, their influence only growing as modern communication changes, obscures just how badly huge swaths of native languages are in danger as the years pass. This interesting documentary focuses on three specific groups: aboriginal communities of Australia, the Welsh people within Great Britain, and native Hawaiians within the United States. Efforts to preserve the rich scope of formerly dying languages arise from the ground up as local activists work to expand their heritage in the face of overwhelming odds.

The main problem with the documentary is its lack of focus. Each of the case studies are fascinating. However, the narrative created by the three of them doesn't quite seem to convey the overall picture that the film-makers seem to want; additional context would've made things better. At the same time, though, this piece is well worth watching by anyone interested in social studies.",1532908800,,952,5.389261744966443
8698152,5,B00SDB0E36,"Very interesting perspective on three languages around the globe and the struggle the people who speak it went through, and in some cases still do, to keep their mother tongues alive and kicking. Thus movie is not only very recommended to people who like linguistics, but also to anyone interested in their ancestors, their language, and making sure your descendants get a chance to speak their forefathers' language. IMO the best parts of the movie are the interviews with the native speakers, when they get a chance to tell their stories. For example there's a lady in Hawaii who tells us her children didn't want to speak hawaian at first, but came round as they got older and now they speak it. I wish these guys would make another movie focusing on more languages, or maybe a short series for TV or youtube.",1468713600,,812,4.685314685314685
8698153,3,B00SDB0E36,"This was okay and all.  The work says there are 6,000 languages in the world and half are endangered.  It then looks at Aborigines, Welsh, and Hawaiians working to keep their tongues in existence.  I would agree that language extinction is a problem.  However, I am not convinced all will be convinced.  This effort or concern may be too gushy for some.
Here's the important thing:  years ago a documentary came out called ""The Linguists"" which I think is superior.  It covered more dying languages than just three.  It also showed more of the evil side in this effort.  A man said he knew some dying language and wanted pay or praise for it, but someone heard him and said, ""That's Quechua with just a few foreign words thrown in.""  An Indian village did a dance for the cameramen, but when done said, ""Now pay us!!!""  The issue of lingual extinction meant nothing compared to getting some cash.  A Russian man said someone punched  him in the face when he wrote in a dying language and so he hid his knowledge of that tongue for safety purposes.  I thought ""The Linguists"" was more of an eye opener and this was just mushy and gushy in comparison.",1432512000,2,1149,4.514563106796117
8698154,5,B00SDB0E36,"This is a very informative couple of hours showing how while there are some 6,000 languages in the world about half of them will disappear in a short while because English is spoken around the world and the people who speak the native tongues are dying. The film also shows how some cultures are rejuvenating their language and the ways this is done. There is a lot of information about this happening in Wales, among the aborigines in Australia, and in Hawaii. Among much else, the film shows how culture is tied to language, how this happens, and how once a language dies, so too does the culture. This is interesting information that we should know.",1422316800,4,652,4.629310344827586
8698155,5,B00SDB0E36,"On a remote island off the coast of Australia, where 400 Aboriginal people speak 10 different languages, all at risk and this is after Australian government apologizing what they did to the Aboriginal people and no different than what Chinese have done with their brutal occupation of Tibet with over 3 million Tibetans living under Chinese occupation in China and about 150,000 more in exile and unbelievably, 1.2 Tibetans--over 20% of the Tibet's pre-occupation population--have died as a result of China's repressive policies. In Wales, Welsh is making a comeback where once it was in danger of dying due to English colonization for centuries.

I speak few languages. Language does matter since without language there is no connection, there is no knowledge and there is no learning. Chinese seem to ruin cultures and environment, kill species to extinction for medical reasons and ruin environments for selfish reasons but the most confusing part to me is Australia. Why would Australia not allow Aboriginal people live their lives as they did for centuries without interfering in their lives is the question since after all, Brazil has insured not to get close to any of their tribes living deep in Amazon jungles just to preserve their existence, their culture, their language but Australia could not resist controlling Aboriginal people through gruesome acts just to kill their language and culture. Absolute shame.

Filmed around the world this is a great documentary that shows how precious cultures and languages are to humanity. In Africa alone there are one thousand languages spoken. More power to Hawaiians, Wales and others who have fought and still fight so hard to keep what is theirs and others can enjoy their existence since that is what languages are... CULTURES, VARIETY and FREEDOM. Bravo, bravo, bravo.",1421884800,3,1826,5.186440677966102
