would be able to relate to any of the humour herein,
but this is still so funny and extremelly well versed,
it is in itself, a great work of art,
the mark of true geniuses.",1248307200,,220,4.1395348837209305
8096518,5,B000CA5MPG,"This is by far the best show on tv and definitely the funnyest. Watching it today and im still amazed by how it aged well and is even better then wath is playing now. Me and my brother used to watch this show religiously when it played and we know all the sketches ans songs by hart. I don't think that anyone is the u.s.a will relate to this show thaugh since its all inside jokes about politics - music - tv  (etc ,etc) in or around Quebec. Highly recommended.",1199232000,,462,4.133333333333334
