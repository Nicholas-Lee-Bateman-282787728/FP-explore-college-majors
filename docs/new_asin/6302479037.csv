2432995,5,6302479037,I loved this documentary.  I do wish they talked more about the brother died and I would have liked to know more about what they are doing today.  This group was one of my grandmother's favorites.,1436400000,2,196,4.416666666666667
2432996,5,6302479037,Love love love the Mills Brothers!!!!!,1433030400,,38,5.5
2432997,4,6302479037,The Mills Brothers are one of those things the happen in a million years like Jimi Hendrix. The Mills Brothers are the root and Doo Wop is the fruit. Must get especially for there for movie clips back in the 30's and 40's. The imitating of musical instruments are most impressing. Sounds like the real thing.,1048377600,,308,4.517857142857143
2432998,4,6302479037,"I guess my main problem  was the lack of length of this video. I I remember as a kid watching The mills bros. on variety shows in the 60's. I would have liked to have seen more of those clips. It's unfortunate,but the Harry Mills on the video most of the time was not the one I remember.  All in all, being a Mills bros. fan I enjoyed it and could have used another hour.",993427200,,371,3.933333333333333

8090211,5,6302479037,"In the late 1960s I was going to Powhatan Jr. High School in southern West Virginia. Money was extremely tight back then. My lunch cost 25 cents. The Mills brothers came to my school and gave a performance in the auditorium, admission was 25 cents. I went hungry that day ,but I saw a show I will remember for the rest of my life. It was a program that the state sponsored to expose the young people to culture It was only about an hour long, but it was great.. I am 63 yrs. old now, looking back I have to say it was one of the best deals I ever made in my life.",1493078400,,563,3.9043478260869566
