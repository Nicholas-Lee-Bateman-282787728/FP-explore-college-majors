3564281,5,B001F51MHY,"I would say this DVD is the newer and updated version of the old AGI Israeli instinctive shooting DVD. Lots of new material, much better videography, looks modern.",1268697600,,163,4.857142857142857
3564282,5,B001F51MHY,"This DVD was an introduction to Israeli point shooting. The DVD also covered the basics of room clearing, structure fighting basics, as well as other topics not often covered in a DVD of this sort, or any where for that matter. For example how to search someone, how to reload a gun with one hand, obscure for someone who just wants defensive shooting, but very good to know and interesting to see. Nice filming location, Instructor is aggressive and and fun to watch.",1268611200,3,468,4.650602409638554

8301014,5,B001F51MHY,I liked the DVD but questioned the author's background. Lo and behold a few days ago the History Channel had a program on special forces and Garret Machine was the featured quest when the Israeli's were depicted. This DVD is a winner.,1391126400,,234,4.595238095238095
8301015,5,B001F51MHY,"Sometimes we forget that when we train over and over it become instinctive. This DVD helps in a very very practical way showing you, instructing you and repeating various techniques then giving you time to practice each between different aspects of shooting. This is not a sit-down and watch DVD but it is a stand up, with you gun in hand DVD. You are to practice along with the DVD until it become instinctive. Great DVD for learning and getting it into your system.",1358294400,,467,4.571428571428571
8301016,4,B001F51MHY,"The information from the dvd is practical and very well explained. Although it seems a little bit outdated. The video is also vey cheaply produced, almost like a home video. Other than that, is a good way to get a sense of the methods used by israely trainers.",1340150400,3,260,4.4375
8301017,1,B001F51MHY,"This was a Joke, poorly done don't waist your money on it spend it on ammo and train your self.",1334793600,,95,3.8
8301018,5,B001F51MHY,"The ""Israeli Instinctive Shooting,"" DVD was a real find...  It not only covers all basic to advanced pistol handling and shooting techniques but the fact that it was grounded in real world threat challenges really made the instruction useful.  The overall emphasis on safety and total threat effectiveness took it to a professional ""10"" for me.  In short, it's not only packed with pertinent instruction, but it's all highly usable and in a format that helps you practice it. This repeatable format importantly supports you in internalizing all the great information and techniques developed and tested by the IDF [""Israeli Elite Special Forces""], at the level of reaction for the moment you may need them.  In terms of personal results, not only did this methodology improve my overall safety, draw time, shooting accuracy and over all counter threat effectiveness, but it increased my survival prospects should I encounter a terror threat and more importantly the lives of the innocents around me should I have to react to an armed terrorist threat.  Additionally, because the methodology builds on itself to make you a counter terrorist warrior and comes via a DVD delivery system, the DVD becomes a perpetual counter terrorist practice module that you and your security team can revisit continually to sharpen and maintain your armed threat reaction skills.",1298851200,2,1361,5.19634703196347

So i got the other DVD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ULTIMATE-ISRAELI-INSTINCTIVE-SHOOTING-AND-PISTOL-COMBAT-TRAINING-dvd/dp/B0032AM8QE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ULTIMATE ISRAELI INSTINCTIVE SHOOTING AND PISTOL COMBAT TRAINING dvd</a>&nbsp;The first one is good, but the second one is awesome! They have some of the same stuff but the second one is about an hour longer then the first. The first one also covers some things the second does not. Overall a worth while purchase that i would recommend. But buy the second one after you watched the first one and have shot with it for some time.",1269734400,4,787,5.912280701754386
8301020,5,B001F51MHY,I watched this DVD several times in order to practice the techniques and master the Israeli method. It worked and I would recommend the DVD to others in the reality based market for shooting DVDs.,1269043200,,196,4.628571428571429
8301021,5,B001F51MHY,This DVD should have entitled Ultimate Instinctive Shooting.  It is comprehensive and does its best to inform on all forms of both shooting and apprehension.  It is a must see for those of us who want to learn about this topic.,1268956800,,227,4.512195121951219
8301022,5,B001F51MHY,"Great DVD, but I have to sat the Title ""Ultimate Israeli Instinctive Shooting and Combat Pistol Training DVD"" is better. This does have some stuff in it the other does not, like arrests and searches. It seems like they where filmed in similar locations. A good DVD and you get it if buy the LOTAR Collection. Overall I recommend it.",1268870400,,332,4.55
