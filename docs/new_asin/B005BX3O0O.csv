4648924,4,B005BX3O0O,"I have been dancing for 14 years and this workout DVD was SO much fun! Don't expect to burn all your daily calories in one viewing though, I did each routine 5 times and got a great workout. This allows you to get some good cardio and tone your problem areas if you do the moves correctly. I will be doing this every day!",1324512000,8,321,4.03125
4648925,5,B005BX3O0O,"I bought this video in hopes that it would be actually Pussycat Dolls moves you would learn, and they delivered. Dancing is one of my favorite ways to workout but most ""dance"" workout videos are not dancing, just exercising to a beat with a dance thing thrown in every now and then. The workouts aren't too hard or too easy, which is great for me. I love it!",1324080000,27,358,4.279411764705882
4648926,5,B005BX3O0O,This is a fun mini-workout if you're more into sexy dance choreography than continuous hopping around aerobic. It' not high impact but I do break out in a bit of sweat. I do this in the evening if I hadn't made it to the gym that day or just want to loosen my body a bit.,1323907200,16,271,3.857142857142857
4648927,5,B005BX3O0O,"I loved the first PCD workout, so had to try this one, too. It's just as fun and challenging as the first one! I noticed Robin Antin does more repetitions of certain moves in the learning part of the choreography, which is great because it gives you more of a workout instead of just learning the moves and performing them. More foot crosses, scoops, and squats that really work your legs! I also think she practices each new move more, especially in the chair sequence, which is good for beginners to really get a grasp on the move instead of moving on quickly and not feeling comfortable with the new move. I love Robin Antin even more as a teacher in this video -she's enthusiastic, supportive, motivational, and just plain fun! I'd almost say this video is even better than the first one.",1322784000,48,792,4.545454545454546
4648928,5,B005BX3O0O,I love this workout it is so much fun! I actually look forward to working out everyday with this dvd it is just as fun as the first one.,1318809600,5,136,3.7241379310344827
4648929,5,B005BX3O0O,"I absolutely love this video. I also own the other one, and love love love it as well. Robin Antin is a genius and makes learning the dances fun, sexy and easy to learn.",1318204800,5,169,4.0
4648930,4,B005BX3O0O,i got the dvd a day after it was released and i put it in once i got home and i love it! its really fun! if you own the first one like i do and you like it then you'll defentily like this one two. so far i have only learned wait a minute and parts of when i grow up! its a great workout and the bonus 4 min workout is fly good to! i use it as a warm up! hope you enjoy it!,1317859200,4,372,3.2873563218390807
4648941,4,B005BX3O0O,I had so much fun Doing this but learning the moves was alittle challenging i had to keep rewinding just learn the moves correctly i danced up a sweat and i felt sexy doing it.,1482883200,,176,4.057142857142857
4648942,4,B005BX3O0O,Honestly preferred the first dvd but this is also good .. its fun which is what workout should be. People always talking about repetitive but thats what you do in the gym anyway and this is more fun ... its gets you sweating which is good. Wish she did more though,1474761600,,264,4.196078431372549
4648943,5,B005BX3O0O,My favorite work out video that I own. It's so much fun that it doesn't always feel like I'm working out.,1469750400,,105,4.0476190476190474
4648944,2,B005BX3O0O,I didn't know it was going to be about learning complex choreography or I wouldn't have bought it.,1467676800,2,98,4.5
4648945,2,B005BX3O0O,just to hard to follow,1465430400,,22,3.6
4648946,4,B005BX3O0O,The head girl doesn't really coach well. I think there are other DVDs like this that are much better. It was priced to move and I am not super disappointed with the DVD. Shipping came fast and well packaged.,1462492800,,207,4.333333333333333
4648947,5,B005BX3O0O,"This is a lot of fun, not sure that I would consider it a workout though, at least not a tough one.",1461628800,2,99,3.5454545454545454
4648948,5,B005BX3O0O,A great workout. Makes you feel sexy all while working up a great sweat.,1458172800,,72,4.214285714285714
4648949,3,B005BX3O0O,"Item would not play on my disc player.  However, for the price, I didn't even bother returning.",1456876800,,95,4.588235294117647
4648950,5,B005BX3O0O,"I lost so much weight with this video, plus learned a few dance moves.  Doing this along with blogilates worked perfectly together.  You wouldn't think it, but this video really made me sweat.",1456012800,2,192,4.787878787878788
4648961,5,B005BX3O0O,Fun workout! It did take a couple of days laughing at my lack of coordination before I picked up the moves.,1455494400,,107,4.142857142857143
4648962,3,B005BX3O0O,"I love doing choreography and I love the Pussycat Dolls so this was right up my alley. My only complaint is that it's too short. So I got a couple 8 counts, now what? I wanted a workout. I hardly broke a sweat and it's over.",1455148800,,224,3.891304347826087
4648963,1,B005BX3O0O,Omg! Not what I expected. This workout is super fast-paced. I couldn't even keep up on the warm-up. ROFL!!!!! You should definitely drink a red bull first.,1453593600,,155,4.777777777777778
4648964,5,B005BX3O0O,"I bought this because I am grossly overweight and out of shape and want to get back to feeling sexy again someday. Honestly, I did not feel very sexy at first doing these dance moves, due to my weight and the fact that my two cats were staring at me the whole time, ha! But after a few minutes I was laughing and soon I even felt a little sexy once or twice!  Still a long way to go but I think it will be a lot of fun to get back in shape using this DVD.",1453507200,9,455,3.6907216494845363
4648965,4,B005BX3O0O,"HAHAHAHAHA, I've never felt more unsexy doing this, but it is a work out for sure. I will not even attempt the chair burlesque part. The dance section is great though. I am like an uncoordinated rhino trying to be Nicole Scherzinger, so at least there's that, I suppose. Thank the Lord it is not like the xbox Kinnect games that take candid photos of you during the dance and then show them to you at the end! You got to hand it to Robin Antin though, who clearly knows how to brand, and choreograph. She does break it down really well, so it is pretty easy to follow. The outfits though.... I just cannot even fathom doing this in a corset. Clearly, I am NOT the demographic, but it was fun!",1453334400,5,692,4.25
4648966,3,B005BX3O0O,I was excited to get this home and try it.......until I did.  To me it was difficult to follow and when I couldn't get it I just got frustrated.  I used it once and will probably never use again.  Very disappointed!,1453075200,,215,4.195121951219512
4648967,5,B005BX3O0O,Great workout video.  Easy to learn.  You feel sexy.  Really shaves off pounds and sculps body.,1452297600,,95,4.8125
4648968,5,B005BX3O0O,Came really fast.  My daughter loves to dance & because she needs some exercise more & could stand to loose a few pounds just like me she is going to love it.  Got it for her as a Christmas present.  Would recommend product & seller.,1449792000,,233,4.133333333333334
4648969,4,B005BX3O0O,This is fun way to work out. But once you've learned the dances it's kinda useless. So you just have to wait a while until you forget them and re learn them!,1447459200,2,157,3.9375
4648970,3,B005BX3O0O,It's ok not what I thought it would be.,1447372800,,39,3.4444444444444446

4648982,5,B005BX3O0O,After doing this video u really feel it in ur legs the next day! Quick way to have a work out use all ur muscles and feel sexy.. a little embarrassing to do it front of ppl but I love it easy to learn too,1444089600,2,204,3.5555555555555554
4648983,3,B005BX3O0O,I enjoyed the 4 minute workout! more than I did the dances though I am glad the dolls were there to dance and not just the main lady because she is stiff and it was like watching an extremely stiff old woman dance. The last dance was nice!,1441324800,,239,4.0

4649001,2,B005BX3O0O,"I can't say what I was really expecting, but it's not real high intensity and it gets boring after the first few times because it is broken down so far.",1420848000,,152,4.1

4649008,4,B005BX3O0O,this DVD is very good to do exercise.,1410480000,,37,3.75
4649009,4,B005BX3O0O,"I could give it 5 stars by judging it alone, but since i already used the old one (from 2009), i think this one deserve only 4 stars. The musics are great, they're fun and the routines are well explained. My only problem with it was that the routines are a little more 'calmed down' compared to the last one. I feel like i burn more with the last one.

Overall, is fun and exciting :)",1406332800,2,384,4.052631578947368
4649010,5,B005BX3O0O,I'm extremely glad I got this! Steps are easy to follow and this video will have you feeling SEXY! Just make sure you have some heels and a fedora for the burlesque breakdown. I highly recommend this for this starting out dance video workouts.,1404518400,2,243,4.545454545454546

4649013,5,B005BX3O0O,"I  really enjoy this workout dvd. Even once you know the dance routine and don't want to go through all the practice, you can still work up a sweat just doing the performances. None of the moves are difficult, even for a first time dancer. I now do this workout every time I work out.",1398470400,,284,4.163636363636364
4649014,5,B005BX3O0O,"I enjoyed doing this DVD when I would find myself in a ""rut"" at the gym. It gets your mind off of working out and turns it into something fun, try doing the whole workout with friends.",1397952000,,184,4.0
4649015,5,B005BX3O0O,This is a great exercise dvd and is useful in my endeavors to learn the fine art of burlesque at home.,1395100800,,102,3.9047619047619047
4649016,5,B005BX3O0O,Love the Pussycat dolls workout. It is fun to have something besides rock and roll and skinny girls in tights.,1395014400,,110,4.55
4649017,3,B005BX3O0O,This was is too fast paced. Not for beginners. Great for advanced dancers. The music is good but I just can't keep up no matter how many times I do it.,1391990400,,151,3.903225806451613
4649018,5,B005BX3O0O,"People need to stop hating on the DVD because the girls are dressed sexy. DUH they're gonna be dressed like that they're the Pussycat Dolls.

Anyways the DVD works! If you do the 2 dance workouts back to back I promise you WILL feel the burn. Keep it up everyday and your sure to see results. Its not easy but a lot of fun.",1389139200,3,323,4.046875
4649019,5,B005BX3O0O,"Don't take yourselves so seriously!!! I am not a coordinated person either but this was so much fun!!! It may take you many views to get the moves down but don't worry about doing it perfectly!! Just have fun and move!!! This was a great workout...you have fun, you sweat, and you get to dance!!! Enjoy, get toned, and practice!!! Robin Antin and her lovely dancers are so inspirational and I really liked the burlesque bit!! I recommend this to anyone who wants to dance and have a good time!! :)",1386547200,,497,4.472527472527473
4649020,5,B005BX3O0O,I lost 20 pounds in just a month!!! I love love love this dvd! *P.S. It's fun to wear cute booty shorts while doing this work out :),1384992000,,132,3.75

4649034,1,B005BX3O0O,she talks too much.  hardly a work out.  She looks damn good though. You'd have more of a work-out walking to the mailbox.,1368576000,3,122,4.260869565217392
4649035,5,B005BX3O0O,"this is very nice proglam
but i don't have hat and chair,so i cant dance burlesque perfectly.
I like it!",1366070400,,104,4.25
4649036,5,B005BX3O0O,This is an incredibly fun workout! Maybe it's because your sweating to fun Pussycat Dolls tunes but it goes by so fast. You'll wish there was more when it's over. The burlesque workout is awesome and will make you feel super Sexy!,1364947200,,230,4.5
4649037,3,B005BX3O0O,"if you're not a well-coordinated person, this may be too fast paced. i struggled with simply conquering the moves--spent more time doing that, instead of breaking a sweat.",1362355200,,171,5.142857142857143

4649039,2,B005BX3O0O,It just wasn't my thing. I don't feel like I am burning calories while doing it. I feel like they are trying to be too pretty with their Makeup and hair done.. And I need to sweat!,1361750400,,180,3.891891891891892

4649041,3,B005BX3O0O,"I only give this DVD a three as far as it's effectiveness and general enjoyment are concerned.  They concentrate too much on only one side of the body (which does not provide a ballanced workout).  Also, I found Robin Anton very irritating.  Her instructions were clear and her showmanship was fantastic, but she is highly repetetive.  I vastly prefered her supporting/backup dancers.  Overall, this only gets a half-decent rating.",1360281600,,431,5.188405797101449
4649042,4,B005BX3O0O,When I first watched to get a feel for the video I thought it was silly... then later I realized that I wanted to learn the moves. The main girl Robin scars me but the video looks like fun!,1360281600,2,189,3.871794871794872
4649043,5,B005BX3O0O,The video is a great workout. The music is awesome and the pussycat dolls make it easy to follow along. Helps with teaching you to move sexy!!! :),1359590400,2,146,4.25
4649044,1,B005BX3O0O,Makes normal girls feel inadequate just watching this. and they're incredibly bouncy moving like they've consumed 10 cups of coffee! Ridiculous.,1359072000,2,144,5.904761904761905
4649045,2,B005BX3O0O,"I thought it was going to be a GREAT workout, um no!!! They teach you 2 of there dances.. then there is a little sexy routine you learn...NOT a WORKOUT at all!!!!",1358640000,,162,4.09375
4649046,5,B005BX3O0O,The dvd is in great condition and everything that I thought it would be...thank you alot. I'm getting in shape and having fun dancing.,1358294400,,134,4.625
4649047,3,B005BX3O0O,I bought this for my wife.  She sees it as for those women who say they want to exercise but cannot or do not want to do it seriously.,1358035200,,134,3.6206896551724137
4649048,3,B005BX3O0O,"This is a cute instructional DVD, but it won't give you a 'dancer's body' by any means. It was fun and sexy, but if you're looking to get a real dancer's body workout, you're better off doing a mile run and and hour of yoga.",1357257600,,224,4.0
4649049,2,B005BX3O0O,"I thought this would include work-outs that dancers actually do. Being a former novice dancer, I know that they don't just dance all the time to stay in shape. It only comes with 2 routines, and while they did get me sweating, I felt like it didn't warrant an entire DVD.",1357084800,,271,4.333333333333333
4649050,1,B005BX3O0O,This is definately not a dance workout. they only show you 1 dance move that is about 30 seconds long.,1357084800,2,102,4.15
4649051,3,B005BX3O0O,"My reaction to this workout DVD was pretty lukewarm. The moves that they teach aren't particularly new or interesting, and they aren't very good at breaking them down anyway. Furthermore, it is not the best workout if you actually want to break a sweat.",1356566400,,253,4.7727272727272725
4649052,3,B005BX3O0O,"To start, there is no pussycat dolls in the video, the workout has pretty hard dance moves that they don't break down to well. In addition to this, there is only a few songs on the entire workout. Ya get what you pay for huh?",1354752000,,225,4.022222222222222
4649053,4,B005BX3O0O,"It was fun. I like doing it though it is a little more towards actual dancers. Myself not being as graceful as I would like, find myself rewinding a lot to figure out how to do the dances. Overall a very fun exercise. Would recommend.",1354665600,,234,4.222222222222222
4649054,4,B005BX3O0O,"I think this is a really great and fast workout if you're looking for something low impact.  I think it's important to have dance experience, or be pretty coordinated, to really benefit from the workout though.",1333238400,,210,4.833333333333333
4649055,3,B005BX3O0O,This is a good workout....not my favorite but fun to throw in for a nice change. You will feel like you did what you needed for the day and sexy at the same time.,1332806400,,162,3.7941176470588234
4649056,3,B005BX3O0O,"i recommend this workout video. it is a lot of fun and you do get a workout, but may not be as hardcore as some may want. however i did smile about the whole time. which is great.",1331596800,3,179,3.736842105263158
4649057,1,B005BX3O0O,dont get this dvd it is horrible the dancing is horrible nothing in it was worth doing you will feel silly watching this dvd and even sillier doing the movies,1331424000,4,158,4.3
4649058,3,B005BX3O0O,It was pretty fun. If you're really in to working out it's a nice change of pace but the work out feels one sided like your body isn't getting the same work out on both sides of the body. I thought it was fun but and I learned some new moves but I rarely do it unless I need an ego booster work out.,1331337600,,299,3.6875
4649059,3,B005BX3O0O,"Came super quick! Love it, fun, and entertaining ;) Would recommend if you just want to incorporate some type of dance into your exercise routines.",1330905600,,147,4.92
4649060,1,B005BX3O0O,"This is not a workout. I love working out and have done various of other videos, this video did not give me anything except a headache.  It was fun for the most part listening to old PCD songs that I used to dance to but other than that, it is not worth it, nor a workout.",1330300800,3,272,3.857142857142857
4649063,5,B005BX3O0O,"I was just watching some PCD music videos and they aren't kidding, the choreography in their workout videos do indeed teach you their signature moves.  I have both videos, love them both.  My only complaint is that the cooldown doesn't have its own chapter marker to make it easy to cut the workout short wherever you like and skip straight to the cooldown.  Very sexy choreography and fun to learn.  I definitely work up a sweat doing these two videos.",1329523200,15,453,4.625
4649064,5,B005BX3O0O,"I like this workout because it doesn't even seem like one. Yet, after trying to learn the steps and the moves, I find myself sweating as if I HAD worked out. I think this is a great way to work out for me because I get bored with the regular exercise dvd's where you have to put a lot of effort and dedication into it. This is more fun and I love it so far.",1328313600,4,357,3.7733333333333334
4649065,2,B005BX3O0O,I found this video did not live up to my expectations.  It is likely meant for those individuals who do not regularly work out and need little activity to increase their heart rate and burn calories.,1328054400,,199,4.527777777777778
4649066,2,B005BX3O0O,"I purchased this DVD based off of the reviews. I workout about 5 days a week doing various exercises and fell into a rut. I really wanted something new and to feel a different kind of work out. This video is not a workout. My mother (50 yrs old, does not work out ever) did it with me and neither of us broke a sweat. We had FUN dancing and laughing at eachother but that was all.

--It's hard to do. She doesn't explain the moves at all and even with my dance experience I struggled to figure out what she was doing or how the moves fit together in each sequence.

--It's short. Each ""Dance"" is about the length of a verse in one of their songs so 35 seconds (about). So even once you learn it you'd have to do it over and over for at least an hour (boring!!) to get any kind of cardio workout.

--It's fun. If your bored or your kids are having a sleep over buy this and have them do it!

I really don't recommend buying it for fitness purposes.",1326844800,2,947,4.0212765957446805
4649067,1,B005BX3O0O,there is no pussycat dolls at all the first one had nicole in it for just one video but this one didn't even have one second of real pcd i should sue for false advertising,1326499200,6,171,3.914285714285714
4649068,5,B005BX3O0O,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect out of this video, but it more than delivered. The workouts are a bit short, but if you do them 5 times or so, you'll get a pretty good workout!!! Getting the other PCD video ASAP to have a little more options! Love it, as the gym just doesn't work for me!",1326240000,5,291,3.9491525423728815
4649069,5,B005BX3O0O,"If you are looking for a workout that makes you sweat, tones, and have a dancer's body, this is the best one. Get it and you will see results. I just lost 60lbs for doing this everyday. Thank you Robin Antin and the dancers for performing and demonstrating of how the workout works. I wonder if there is going to be more Pussycat dolls workout in the future? Thanks a bunch.",1325808000,6,374,4.28169014084507
4649070,1,B005BX3O0O,"I love to dance as a way of keeping fit, but this video was not for me. I suppose if you like hip hop moves, this video will be more to your liking. I find the moves to be too jerky. I tried the video through once, but I could hardly stand it. This was not what I would call a workout, and I did not even break a sweat. It is basically just learning a few short dance routines.  I didn't feel like I worked out at all. I am returning this video!",1325635200,6,445,3.734042553191489
4649071,5,B005BX3O0O,"In comparison to the first PCD workout, this one is a lot more fun and active.
The dancemoves are fun, easy to learn and actually make you feel like you had a workout.

8464439,1,B005BX3O0O,"I guess if you do this a bunch of times back to back you'll get a decent cardio workout, but this was a waste of money for me. After trying Cize and other dance workouts, this one falls way short of expectations and pales in comparison",1525305600,,235,4.130434782608695

8464443,3,B005BX3O0O,"Not worth buying unless you hate exercise and want to do the bare minimum. This DVD made me sweat so it gets 3 stars but I will never do it again. This video seems to be designed for boys to watch. There was a close up of her breasts for no reason during one of the steps. Throughout the video I kept remembering other instructors encouraging you to keep moving, pick up the pace, correct your form, and other typical instructions. The instructor in this DVD didn't do that. There was a short routine followed by a performance. In between this is video of the girls free style dancing- just long enough to make you worry about getting your heart rate back up. During the performance you work enough to get a sweat, but the time spent learning the routine is too slow. Over all this workout is not one that will teach you how to workout effectively. It'll make you dance a little and watch a little but it's not a great workout. Immediately after this workout I popped in Amy Dixon to get a real workout",1501804800,,1002,4.335106382978723
