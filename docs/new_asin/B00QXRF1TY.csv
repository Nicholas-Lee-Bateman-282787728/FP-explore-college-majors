6890166,5,B00QXRF1TY,"The Comeback's Unlikely comeback was almost like seeing a dream. After years of writing HBO, signing multiple online petitions, and seemingly to have to be content with only one season, there was a teaser clip released of Aunt Sassy being knocked out of the way by the paparazzi and missing Juna (totally true to form)!!  You wanted it so badly to be true, yet were silently concerned how it was going to turn out.  They were going to tarnish the cult status of the show that grew to become my favorite show of all time.  As the premiere date approached I was excited and a little nervous to see what my favorite character had been up to, literally, 10 years later.  After the first episode aired, I was relieved it had a similar flow just like the first season had. After episode 2, all doubts were gone.  By the end of season 2, I was blown away and now think they even topped season 1, which I never thought possible.  This is. Must have for your collection.",1438905600,4,961,4.401129943502825
6890167,3,B00QXRF1TY,"For the show, The Comeback gets 5 stars.  Amazing, great, hilarious and heartbreaking.  A must see.
For this DVD release?  1-2 stars.  This felt like a bit of a middle finger from HBO to Kudrow and King.
First, DVD only.  That was a bit disappointing, as I can't recall any HBO show since Sex and the City that didn't have a Blu-Ray release.
Moving on, the original first season DVD had the commentaries and two featurettes: Valerie at Dancing with the Stars and Valerie After the Laughter.  For no reason that I can see, After the Laughter was removed from this box set.  I believe all the commentaries are intact.
As for the second season, there were two commentaries and 1 deleted scene (that was made available online).
No additional deleted scenes, no blooper reel, no behind the scenes documentary from Kudrow and King (with the vast number of interviews they've done to promote, I'm sure they'd have been willing), no cast interviews, or any of the various footage you find on home video releases today.  Compare that to other HBO releases, even sitcoms such as Veep, which gets a Blu-Ray release and more extras, and this just stings as a fan.
If this were a small company, I would understand.  But to me, this just seems like HBO looked at The Comeback and decided it wasn't worth a better package.
If none of this matters to you, buy it.  It's a great show.  If it does, get it in HD on iTunes.",1438732800,10,1404,4.509881422924901

6890169,5,B00QXRF1TY,"The original Comeback was 1 season almost 5 years ago. This DVD is from 2014, when the show made a comeback of it's own. Lisa Kudrow is Valerie Cherish! We want to see more!",1446854400,,173,4.117647058823529
6890170,5,B00QXRF1TY,"Almost ten years after its one season debut, the brilliant Lisa Kudrow returns for a second season in this sharply written dramedy. Both seasons are included in this collection and well worth it if you are seeking a great showbiz satire, beautifully performed by a stellar cast. But the underrated Kudrow is the focal point, creating an interesting, funny and sometimes sad characterization of a TV star who'll do just about anything to maintain her career. The ""reality show"" conceit was ahead of its time.",1443830400,,507,4.976470588235294

6890176,5,B00QXRF1TY,"Hello, Hello, Hello!

5 stars for the show! It's the greatest show of all time. The fact that they came back 9 years later with a near-flawless second season is unheard of. Truly, it's amazing.

In terms of the DVD, I'd like to clear some things up. I had the 1st season on DVD, and it includes commentary, plus a couple fun special features with new footage. I was excited for the new DVD for the content relating to season 2 in hopes that there would be a lot of extra footage.

NEW content that wasn't on the season 1 DVD includes: Episode commentary on season 2, episode 1 and season 2, final episode. There is also 1 (hilarious) deleted scene that can be found on the internet (just search ""Done in a Day the Comeback deleted scene""). The commentary is great, but it is limited to just the 2 episodes. I would've loved commentary for the whole season, but maybe I'm just being greedy! I just thought I would let people know what they are getting because when I purchased, I didn't see the specifics in terms of what was added besides the actual season 2 episodes.

That said, this set is incredibly cheap at under $15. I recommend everyone owns it so HBO makes money off the property and we keep getting Valerie Cherish. It is also such a brilliant series and it's nice to have all of the episodes in one package that fits neatly on a shelf.",1439337600,,1346,4.350597609561753

8693255,5,B00QXRF1TY,"A brilliant, painfully hilarious series about show biz life and its neurotics, back stabbers, shallowness, and desperation for stardom, with occasional moments of kindness and caring. Lisa Kudrow is astonishing. The Comeback is an absolute gem and ranks with The Larry Sanders Show as one of the great TV series of all time.",1491091200,,324,5.132075471698113

8693259,5,B00QXRF1TY,"So glad to have this entire series on DVD. I really wish this would have lasted longer than it did because it is unique in its own weird way. For fans of this, I also recommend Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman...because Valerie Cherish is just as neurotic as Mary Hartman. Lisa Kudrow plays the role of Valerie so perfectly and believably. My only regret really is that there aren't more episodes to get lost in...",1480809600,,408,4.527027027027027
8693260,4,B00QXRF1TY,"The Comeback reveals the pitfalls of the modern working woman. It exemplifies working women throughout the series. Valerie, Jane, Gigi all reveal, perhaps, an unconscious revelation: a woman who chooses work chooses to be unhappy. They may gain fame, fortune, an Oscar, a great job, etc., but any joy is missing from their lives. They may sacrifice relationships, the prospect of children, and their sense of self in order to attain that which they believe is the standard of men or the modern woman in a bid to have everything. But along the way the lessons of natural limitations are realized. The shows are cancelled, the Oscar becomes a doorstop, the houses and money don't bring happiness and this is all because what has been sacrificed would be more treasured than what is (temporarily gained). This show reveals to its viewers truth. This show reveals the downside of women's liberation. Yes, they are free to work and be independent, but is pursuing such avenues a path that is better?",1474502400,,994,4.887573964497041
8693261,5,B00QXRF1TY,"This edition includes Seasons 1 & 2.  The original extras from the Season 1 DVD set are here, and for Season 2 we get some additional commentary from Lisa Kudrow and Michael Patrick King.

While I would have loved more extras on the Season 2 section, this show is just so on point, so good, so painful - I don't care.

Sharply written, superbly acted The Comeback is worth owning no matter what.",1465084800,3,395,4.383561643835616
