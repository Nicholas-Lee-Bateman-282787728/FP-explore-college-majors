2600346,4,B000G6BL7O,"This is the season I've been waiting for - where the BN show really hit its stride, but especially because it contains the best episode ever: ""Carol at 6:01"", where Carol's husband Larry is so needy that it drives Carol nuts.  Although the highlight of the episode is just prior to an act break where Bob, Jerry, et al. plan their revenge on Howard, who has been winning at ""Chinese poker.""

2600347,5,B000G6BL7O,"The Bob Newhart Show is one of the funniest and best written comedies ever produced. The characters are flawed, likable, and easy to relate to. The comedy is never crude, mean spirited or predictable-unlike many of the comedies shown on TV today. The Bob Newhart Show is number one on my list of the ""big four classic comedies"" (the others are: The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Barney Miller, and The Carol Burnett Show.)",1156032000,6,415,4.698630136986301
2600348,5,B000G6BL7O,"I grew up watching this wonderful series as a youngster, which only got better with each season.  I see where the 'Complete Fourth Season' offers the classic ""Who's Mister X?,"" where an unsuspecting Bob is 'ambushed' by a go-for-the-throat female television talk show host.  This exchange alone is worth the money for this set.

This was such a great series!  I remember watching 'All In The Family,''The Mary Tyler Moore Show,''The Bob Newhart Show' and 'The Carol Burnett Show' - all in a row on CBS. You just didn't do anything else on a Saturday evening 30+ years ago!

For serious collectors only who need to round out their library. And I never noticed the moments of chauvinism before.

It's as great a series today as it was originally years ago. As a matter of fact, it's a reminder of what television today lacks - good, honest, friendly comedy. Each episode tackles situations that can be as realistic today as they were years back. The characters are hilarious - from Bob's co-workers Jerry, Carol, his neighbor Howard, his sister, his group patients and his wife, Emily -- everyone in their own way has a unique kind of humor that when they're all put together, you know you've got the blend for an exceptional comedy series. They work so well together; each character is loveable in their own unique way. And nobody is even trying too hard to be funny! The humor comes out to appear quite natural - especially Bob! I highly recommend this series - whether you're refreshing your memory from having seen it back in the 70s or are new to the show. Get ready to laugh out loud during each episode.

2600400,4,B000G6BL7O,"The fourth season DVD of the Bob Newhart show is my fav, but all of the seasons are my fav.
Since I'll only bore you with my ode to Bob Newhart, I'll tell you what I like about the fourth season.  The emerging of Mr. Herd.  Mr. Herd took off like a rocket while doing the BoB N.  He quickly became close to Mr. Carlin; America's favorite mental patient.  This was also the season of the most talked about episode; Over the River and Through The Woods, where Bob and his friends get drunk and order chinese food over the phone. This is also the season-which was rare, but they killed off Mr. Gianelli; who later turned up on many other sit-coms and became a known director.

THE DVD PACKAGING: I don't like double sided DVD's but that's what they have to do keep the price down (I guess) The Art on all of the packages are ugly, and insulting to the characters.  On the Title menus the Casts faces are sort of like Picasso-like without the talent.  I love the commentary, even though Bob just about repeats everything he's said on the other disks and most of the time the people with him are mostly talking about something which is not on the screen. It's like hanging out with them in your living room, and Bob will sometimes
Steer the conversation to the show.  But, Bob is the best, I can't wait until AMAZON stocks the season 5 & 6 packages.  BOB IS THE BEST !!",1296172800,3,1364,4.276264591439689

2600404,2,B000G6BL7O,"With all the gushing reviews here, I was expecting another great season of Bob Newhart and company; instead, what we get is a series of sub-par episodes that seem to have been written by high-schoolers who have little sense of timing, humor, or subtlety.  All of the jokes here are slow and ponderous, and the set-ups for the jokes are predictable and very cliche.  While the show was very strong for the first three seasons, this season is simply hard to watch--it makes me cringe to see how un-funny some of the jokes and situations are.  Too many of them depend upon unrealistic reactions by others, or on someone walking in the door at an inopportune moment, or on conflicts that force characters to step out of character.  Just watch the painfully embarrassing (and not at all funny) restaurant scene in episode two, and you'll see the season in a nutshell.  All in all, there has been little to enjoy this season.

Bob Newhart's genius is based in a great part on his subtlety, on his understatement.  Yet there's very little of that here--these all look like pilot episodes with undeveloped characters trying desperately to get laughs with weak material.  There are a few moments of true humor, but very few.

As a side note, who's responsible for the absolutely awful artwork on the disc menus?  This is the second season in a row that uses these travesties on the menus, and they're even more painful than the lame jokes.

Definitely one to pass on.",1290384000,2,1458,4.67843137254902
2600405,3,B000G6BL7O,"The deadpan comedy of Bob Newhart is [as always] tremendous. Susan Pleshette is a great foil as are his many ""clients"".

The first season was a little slow as the characters developed and you got to know them, but by the second season the show had really taken off.  Season three was even funnier and season four keeps that trend going.

Two things about this season made it special.  One was the Thanksgiving episode, where Bob, Jerry, Howard and Mr. Carlin get drunk and try to order Chinese food.  It was probably the funniest episode in the whole series.  The other great thing about season four was that we got to meet Bob's old college buddy, The Peeper, played by Tom Poston.

There's not much bonus stuff on these discs, but this one did include a short commentary by Bob and a gag reel, which was pretty funny.  I'm looking forward to season five.",1202688000,,825,4.453333333333333

The Bob Newhart show is a fine example of this genre. This show is funny without being offensive....it is clever at times...downright silly at other times...and while there is levity about Bob's patients problems, it is not a cruel and abusive humor...it is good hearted humor that Bob's patients (if they were real people) would probably appreciate. The show is about people, and how interesting & funny they can be, both in an ordinary way and in novel ways. Compare this to the insipid potty jokes and grade school playground sex humor of most shows at present...the Bob Newhart show is a refreshing and entertaining show that is a joy to watch, and can be watched with children present.

Why isn't FOX releasing Seasons 5 & 6 on DVD of the classic sitcom ""The Bob Newhart Show?""

We purchased the first four seasons, as collectors, and had no indication that the series would not be released on DVD in its entirety.

The Fourth Season just keeps the flow of the show moving forward, with fresh ideas by great writers. Great acting by the cast, and great sets by those working behind the scenes. These shows are great and a special non scratchable DVD should be made just for Bob Newhart releases. These shows have a classic feel, but they don't feel dated one bit. There is a reason they made a statue of Bob Newhart in Chicago.
Now if season 5 could just find its way to DVD. Somebody get Carol to make a note of that.",1191888000,2,789,4.163398692810458

I cannot believe that the manufacturer is not making money on these sets.  I hope that seasons five and six do not go the way of Barney Miller, post season one!  BM was another funny show that didn't get support on DVD.  At least that is the rumor on the net.

Bob's other funny show was ""Newhart"", which I cannot understand why it has not been released on DVD.

The whole cast just clicks.  I wish shows like this were still on television.

If you enjoy a good laugh then buy this and the other sets!

The Bob Newhart show was one of the best comedies ever on television and deserves to have seasons five and six released.",1174608000,9,682,4.2578125
2600422,5,B000G6BL7O,"This series actually got progressively better since the first season, and the humor and situations are timelessly funny. Bob's deadpan humor may not be for everybody, but it suits me very well. Although I was only a kid when this show was on network TV, I'm kicking myself for not appreciating how attractive Suzanne Pleshette was at the time.",1174089600,3,343,4.830508474576271
2600423,5,B000G6BL7O,"It's hard to not lump the Mary Tyler Moore Show and Bob Newhart Show together. For years, they ran together in prime time, they both ended while still good (and before the ratings really dropped) and even in syndication (like when I was first exposed to these shows), they tended to run one right after the other.  The Mary Tyler Moore Show won all the awards and has always been regarded as one of the best TV comedies ever.  As much as I enjoy it, however, I have always enjoyed the Bob Newhart Show even more.

The centerpiece of the show is, of course, Bob Newhart, playing psychologist Bob Hartley.  Newhart is a gifted comedian and is a master of timing and delivery.  Even though he is often the straight man compared to others, he still gets in his share of jokes.  Suzanne Pleshette plays his wife Emily, a school teacher who is just as smart as Bob; in fact, in an earlier season, he had to deal with her higher IQ.  Bill Daily is the daffy neighbor Howard Borden (he's probably perpetually dazed from jet lag from his job as a navigator).  Finally, there are Bob's workplace friends:  the dentist Jerry Robinson (Peter Bonerz) and receptionist Carol Kester (Marcia Wallace, probably better known nowadays as the voice of Mrs. Krabappel in the Simpsons).

The strength of the show is that it is so character-driven.  No one fits completely into a stereotypical mold.  Jerry's faade as a free-wheeling bachelor actually conceals a rather lonely life.  Howard, for all his oddness, still is concerned about his son who he rarely sees.  In the fourth season, however, it is Carol who undergoes the most change, as she tries to pursue other career options and becomes married after a whirlwind romance.

The 24 episodes of this season are bookended by appearances by Bob's old college buddy, the Peeper (Tom Poston).  In the show, Emily is not fond of the Peeper's prankish humor, but in real life, Pleshette and Poston would eventually marry (as discussed in the commentary for the first episode).  In between are a number of other great episodes, probably highlighted by Over the River and Through the Woods, where Bob gets really drunk when left alone for Thanksgiving.  In Who is Mr. X?, Bob winds up being ambushed during a TV interview; according to the commentary, this episode wound up being shown at various businesses as a cautionary tale.

These episodes ran in the 1975-6 season.  It is interesting to see how programming worked thirty years ago.  New episodes ran every week from September through February with only a single break for Christmas.  It's quite a contrast to the current strategy of stretching a season over eight months and rarely showing more than four new episodes in a row.  Of course, even better is owning the whole season on DVD; you don't even have to wait a week between shows.  While the fashions may be a bit out-of-date, the show itself isn't and it remains better than most sitcoms are nowadays.  If you have never seen the Bob Newhart Show, you are in for a treat.",1173312000,21,3011,4.689523809523809
2600424,5,B000G6BL7O,"I have both the first and fourth seasons, and they are both good.  I think the series improved with time, I thought the episodes in the fourth season were even better than the first.  The shows are always morally clean, which is vital to me.  I watched this series when I was a kid, and it was one of my favorite shows, and still is.  If you have ever seen As Time Goes By, the humor is very similar.  Very few shows have this kind of humor, where the timing and pausing are as important as what is said.  A bonus is seeing a few actors whose careers continued after this show was over.  Very funny show, I am waiting for his later show, Newhart, to finally be released on dvd.",1173312000,4,677,4.122137404580153

All of the characters in this show make the show what is it, very refreshing, clean and funny. Bob's deadpan humor never ceases to make me laugh. Most of the TV comedies on TV today think humor is always sexual, or crude.  I didn't buy this show for a long time because several comments from other reviewers about the quality. The quality is great. It is on double sided DVDS, but I have not found that to be a problem. So if you love comedies you can watch with your entire family, I would recommend Bob Newhart. It's very reasonably priced. I hope they put out seasons five and six soon. I would also like to see the Newhart show on DVD.",1170028800,,814,4.355263157894737

We knew we'd made a good choice after watching the very first episode.  Even if you didn't care for ""Bob"" or ""Emily"" (which is highly unlikely), the supporting cast is so great that the show would still be worth watching.  A talented cast plus great writers equals outstanding entertainment.  A great companion on those nights when there's just no quality show on the regular TV.",1168300800,,552,4.649484536082475

2600440,5,B000G6BL7O,"Another entertaining season with Bob.  Even a boring Newhart episode aces any crappy show aired on Fox.  So, don't refrain from purchasing.  But the real mystery to me is Bob's closet.  Yeah, I know the romance between Howard and Ellen drags a bit (How anyone could become erotically attached to Howard is beyond me.), but that's the way it goes.  The question of the closet, however, is: Where does Bob put all those goofy clothes.  Yep, every episode he sports a new, garish outfit.  Yet, his closet is always half empty.  Does Bob maintain some kind of Harry Potter expanding closet device or does some clothing  company dress him on the elevator on the way up to his office each day?  Perhaps some companies that sell clothing to folks who believe they are financially successful would do that for credits at the end of the show.  Anyhow, Bob's costumes are almost half the fun.",1167523200,,882,4.662337662337662

A must see!",1163116800,4,320,4.064516129032258
2600443,5,B000G6BL7O,"The fourth season (1975-1976) of ""The Bob Newhart Show"" is right up there with the second season, and perhaps even a bit better.  Some of the funniest episodes from the fan polls are from this season, and while there are perhaps a few fewer recognizable faces as guest stars, you will still see a few.  The writers and cast by this point have both hit their stride, and the chemistry is phenomenal.

The Season is book-ended by appearances by Tom Poston as The Peeper, Bob's college buddy whom Emily can't stand.  Of course, Tom would go on to be a regular in Bob's next sitcom ""Newhart"", and then there is the irony that Tom and Suzanne Pleshette would eventually get married.  In-between, there are many events, including the death of Mr. Gianelli (""Death of a Fruitman""), Carol gets married (""Carol's Wedding""), Bob hosts an arrogant French psychologist (""Shrinks Across The Sea""), Bob forms a short-lived partnership with another psychiatrist (""Seemed Like a Good Idea At the Time"") and many more.

Two of the funniest episodes ever are in this season with ""Who Is Mr. X?"", where Bob is ambushed by a morning talk-show host and is so flustered he reveals that one of his patients is a public servant.  The other classic is ""Over the River and Through the Woods"", in which Bob gets out of a trip to Seattle over Thanksgiving by claiming that his patients need him.  He ends up hosting a party with Jerry, Howard, and Mr. Carlin in which they all drink too much watching William and Mary's worst college football defeat, and make the funniest call for Chinese food ever recorded.  I also very much like ""Bob Has To Have His Tonsils Out, So He Spends Christmas Eve In The Hospital"", and the title explains the plot to that one.

All in all, there are 24 episodes on three 2-sided DVDs, just the same as the first three seasons.  Also like seasons 2 and 3, there are five episodes with commentary, but I have to say that the commentary has improved this season; perhaps because they have more people participating in them.  I would still not call them great commentaries, but they are significantly better than the prior seasons.  There is a short season 4 feature, and there is also a gag reel.  In all, this is probably the best set of features they have included, but more importantly this is the season with the funniest episodes.",1160611200,68,2334,4.633495145631068
2600444,5,B000G6BL7O,"In Season 4, things really go 70s. The Hartleys have new wallpaper, and the reception area gets painted bright orange. I always watched this growing up, and am so happy to see them on DVD, some with commentary. I love the opening this season, Bob getting passed an empty coffee cup. The look when Carol gives him an empty cup, well, no one does a ""What the H is going on"" look better than Bob Newhart. You'll hurt with laughter at the Guys, left alone at Bob's for Thanksgiving, try to cook a turkey then give up and order Chinese, all while drunk. ""Don't look in the dishwasher...""

Is it me or is Howard getting even dumber this year?

I can't wait for season 5.

Bob Newhart just keeps getting better. This season contains some of my favorites, including ""Over the River and Through the Woods""; everyone gets drunk you have to choose which is more funny ""more goo"" or ""Hi Emily, what's happing?"" or ""what ever you do, don't look in the dishwasher!""
