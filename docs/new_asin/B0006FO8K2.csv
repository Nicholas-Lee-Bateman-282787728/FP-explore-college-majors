8041340,4,B0006FO8K2,"This is such a classic collection of episodes. The only gripe I have is that the first and second episode should've been switched, only because Chuckie mentions that Nicole  finally forgave him for lying to her and being ""Chongo"" in the first episode, and the second, Chongo appears for the first time and that's when he lies to her. Other than that, this is bringing so many memories back for me (in the good way).",1458172800,,415,4.533333333333333
