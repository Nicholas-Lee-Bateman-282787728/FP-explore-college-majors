8629200,2,B00H28A5DK,"I was kind of disappointed with this performance of the Magic Flute. It lacked the excitement of the Metropolitan's performance and the Kenneth Branagh's movie version. The Queen of the Night's performance lacked the power of the other two versions. And to top it off one of the characters appeared to be in ""black face"" to represent evil. Skip this version and buy either of the other two which are both excellent.",1438646400,,415,4.777777777777778
