2816222,4,B000PC72FO,not a bad movie for the price. i would recommend this movie to any gay movie buff. low budget movie,1360368000,,99,4.0
2816223,1,B000PC72FO,"This movie is low budget, bad acting, poor pretty much everything and overall annoying music. If someone threatens your life if you do not watch it, choose carefully.",1358985600,5,166,4.964285714285714
2816224,4,B000PC72FO,"This was a good movie not great.  There was alot that could have been done better on filming, lighting and acting but still it was a good st about love, lost, and finding yourself.",1357948800,,180,4.294117647058823
2816225,3,B000PC72FO,"If you can get past the first 15 minutes of melodrama and overacting, this movie is actually worth watching.  The premise was interesting enough to prevent me from shutting this off.  The two main characters are reasonbly well developed and this outweighed the other characters which were mere paper cut-outs.  There is a tenderness to the drama and a certain honesty.  There are some scenes that stretch plausibility but others that are very real.  There is some eye candy but I found the above-the-waist bedroom scenes a to be a little puritanical for my taste. Perhaps the producer felt that s/he needed to do this in order to portray a more tender quality.

In short, if you have run out LGBT titles to watch and are bored, then this might be worth your time.",1357344000,14,763,4.656716417910448

This movie was not a big budget movie and the story line was different from any I have seen before but I liked it very much.  I believe it shows a part of the gay community that most of the general population have never seen.  The fact that gay and lesbian couples are much like everyone else is sucessfully depicted in this movie.",1356048000,2,483,5.871428571428571
2816227,3,B000PC72FO,"Journals leave an imprint on the writer and all who love us. The sudden death of a man, who started a runaway shelter in the South, begins a quest by his lover to discover more about his companion's past.  This obviously true story, filled with the kind of synchronicity only the Spirit could orchestrate, takes us to consider grief, loss, HIV, letting go, love of life, renewal, and passion, which comes unexpectedly.  This is a great story.  The acting is amateur, the editing poor.  Seen as a home movie with real people being themselves, it becomes a quest for love and realization of who our real family is.",1331251200,2,612,4.638888888888889
2816228,5,B000PC72FO,"While some reviewers may think this story line is far fetched, I agree with another reviewer, it bears some truth. The music in my opinion is excellent and works very well with this independent gem. The acting is a bit rough around the edges however, It kept me intrigued. I would recommend this movie as it kept me guessing, and took me on a mild roller coaster of emotions that helped me to remember the loss of my partner ""John"".",1322352000,2,432,4.4125
2816229,2,B000PC72FO,"Because I feel technical/craft deficiencies sink this film,  I'm not going to commment on the plot, except to say that the several storylines were not very well integrated. Some bits and pieces of this movie made me wonder what the actors could have achieved with better direction and a better script, but far too often their emotions changed so dramatically and unrealistically within a scene that is was imposible to take them seriously.  The music was sappy and distracting, playing so heavily over some scenes as to make the dialogue difficult to understand.  It was refreshing to see ""real"" looking actors but what they were given to say was many times laugh-out-loud silly and trite.  Not the worst movie I've seen, but one easily skipped.",1244851200,2,745,4.936
2816230,4,B000PC72FO,"While some reviewers may think this story line is unbelieveable, in reality it bears some truth.  The music is excellent.  The acting is not the best and neither is the transition from scene to scene.  However, I stayed glued and never had a clue to how the story line would go until way further in the movie.  Maybe I am biased since it was filmed in Atlanta GA and I am a Georgian.  I would recommend this movie as it kept me guessing and intrigued",1229644800,13,450,4.247058823529412
2816231,5,B000PC72FO,"My partner and I were pleasantly surprised by the entertaining elements of this movie, ""Books of John.""

The music was, in our opinion, perfect. The selections made, added an extra artistic flair that made us melt into the movie even more.

To attempt to make a movie that tells a ""realistic"" story about gay lifestyle, hardships, and relationships - is hard to pull off. Books of John did just that.

Every movie has some sort of message that they want, or attempt to portray to the viewer. Books of John has a twist that leaves you questioning several situations in your own life, and possibly others you've known along the way. We won't spoil it, you'll have to find out.",1179446400,13,674,4.6

2816233,2,B000PC72FO,"OK story. Very simply told. Some reasonable acting, some poor acting. The quality of picture is definitely poor",1458000000,,111,5.222222222222222

2816237,5,B000PC72FO,"The Book of John is a very heart warming story and cleverly written - interesting plot line - after his lover of many years dies, guy discovers in notes books about his home town and goes in search to find more about his earlier years. . . . won't ""spoil"" what he discovers, but it leads, eventually to a beautiful ending.  Well acted, and worth more than one viewing.",1446940800,,368,4.333333333333333
2816238,4,B000PC72FO,"It's a local (Atlanta) gay themed indie movie. We are lucky these films get made at all.

Like most shoe string indies it's not shot on a sound stage. Thy use their homes, apartments, friend's job site, whatever is available. The lighting is mostly bad. (Who sleeps in a motel room with every light available turned on?) The sound is only adequate.

The first 30 minutes could have been condensed into 10. The dialog is often stereotyped and preachy. The actors for the most part are clearly untrained. The stand out is Bryen Winstead as Trevor. He is not always comfortable, but he is totally charming.

I still like it and have watched it twice.",1446336000,2,647,4.608695652173913

2816249,4,B000PC72FO,"I thought the movie was quite good.  At times some of the acting was forced or poorly done , but not so much that it ruined the film for me.

John's books (basically diary entries that go back to his childhood hometown)

but changes the course of his life in an unexpected way!  Anyone who likes
to see 'new beginnings' happen, when all seems lost, will love this film!!",1401148800,,398,4.940298507462686
2816254,4,B000PC72FO,The acting was fairly good and the main theme was somewhat believable.  I can't imagine that a relationship like that would have much of chance for survival.,1399248000,,157,4.814814814814815

2816256,5,B000PC72FO,"This is one of the better gay-theme movies I've seen.  The vocal music at the beginning and in some other places in the movie was particularly touching.  Kudos to the producers for their incorporation of this music.  The two main characters are both gorgeous older role models and the uplifting story is memorable (although yes, predictable after a while and pretty unbelievable in a typical Hollywood sort of way).  But who cares?  Again, a very enjoyable gay movie and I hope there are many more like this.",1392595200,,508,4.793103448275862
2816257,5,B000PC72FO,"The Books of John was a satisfying film. Despite starting on a sad note the story moves forward in genuine, if somewhat predictable, story arc. The story was very interesting and was smoothly steered through scenes that could have been cliche but were not because of the authenticity of the performances of the cast. A lovely way to spend an evening.",1391126400,,350,4.754098360655738

Poor acting, poor script, poor plot.  Poor me for watching.  It may not be the worst film I ever watched but .. . .",1384560000,2,126,3.96
2816260,4,B000PC72FO,I enjoyed the story although the acting was quite sub-par. The story line was great and quite easy to follow although at times the pace was tedious. Overall I loved it but there was a lot of room for improvement.,1381708800,,212,4.325
2816261,1,B000PC72FO,"Worst movie ever ... stopped watching it less than half way thru.
that acting ...... someone needs to go back to acting school or don't quit your day job.
and how old it the director? 10?",1377561600,2,187,4.222222222222222
2816262,4,B000PC72FO,"I thought the story like was a little contrived but it certainly pointed out what it was like,  how yhou had to hide when you were gay, small town, in the late 60's early 70's.  I found it very enjoyable",1376179200,2,203,4.05
2816263,5,B000PC72FO,This is really a sad movie at the beginning.  Then it is mysterious.  Lastly it ends up happy.  I did have to watch it several times to figure out that dead lover was about ten years older than Frank.  That fact was really needed to make the love affair of Frank and the son more believable.,1374710400,2,291,4.142857142857143
2816264,5,B000PC72FO,Having lost a long time partner to a heart attack I felt the heartache and loss. I loved the plot. The twist at the end was refreshing. I loved the characters portrayed. I thought the writer/s did an excellent job. Photography was excellent. Agreat portrayal of one's heartache at the loss of a loved one.,1374624000,2,305,4.5636363636363635

2816266,1,B000PC72FO,Honestly I just thought this was a dumb movie.  I cannot imagine why anyone would think the plot or characters would be interesting.  Even the title is pretentious,1367452800,3,163,4.785714285714286
2816267,5,B000PC72FO,Well done.  Truly captures human emotions. The interaction between the generations is very well done and true to life.  I highly recommend this movie.,1365033600,,150,5.208333333333333
2816268,3,B000PC72FO,The main story was good enough to make the rest worth watching. The supporting characters never developed as much as they should  and the all around acting wasn't the greatest.,1363910400,2,176,4.866666666666666
2816269,5,B000PC72FO,"Having experienced the death of a long-term partner, I found this story very meaningful.  The sadness and hesitation exhibited by the surviving partner are real life experiences that many have faced.  The way the story unfolds and the new romantic interest comes into the picture is heartwarming.  The physical and emotional attractions come through loud and clear.  If you are looking for gay porn, this is not it.  If you are looking for a tender love story, you must see this movie!",1363305600,2,485,4.865853658536586
2816270,3,B000PC72FO,"This was a film I could watch on Instant Streaming as an Amazon Prime member.... so I thought I would give it a try one night that I was having problems sleeping. I did make it through the entire film, so it was not completely bad, but there are a lot of problems with this film.

The overall plot is that John, the partner of the films main character Will, dies suddenly. They have been partners for twelve years. Will is in grief, and a few months later, while beginning the process of cleaning things left behind by John, discovers diaries (the books) that John wrote. In the course of reading them, he realizes how little he knew of his partners past life, and visits the hometown of John to put some closure to the situation.

I don't want to give away details of the storyline which would be a spoiler, but the scripting/writing is rather cliche, and a viewer can easily guess the next next developments as scenes play out .  (Which is truly unfortunate that an independent film should suffer from low - quality ""Hollywood"" writing....  or maybe the problem was it was written with the intention of being done by a major studio, and no one would pick it up...???!!!???)

Next, the acting.... sophomoric at best.  I have seen better acting on stage in high school productions and in community theater. If the actors in many scenes did more than a read through two or three times with a bit of direction, it seems as though better results could have been accomplished. The problematic writing does not lead to a great deal of character development. The dialogue has little that is subtle... so this shouldn't be rocket science.

The overall production has little interest. The sound quality is not good. The ""cinematography"" is adequate. There is one scene that is interesting because of the use of color editing.

SO THE BOTTOM LINE... This is not a movie that I would consider for purchase, but was okay as a ""free perk"". I wish there had been a trailer to view, but I suspect that it is not there because it might drive people away. Had I seen a trailer, I may not have watched it.",1362787200,6,2088,4.519893899204244

8190534,2,B000PC72FO,"Painfully mediocre, low budget movie with a deeply disturbing plot. First 1/2 hour of movie could have been condensed into 10 minutes. This movie drags out like a slug's trail.... so I just kept fast forwarding it. Shows lots of gay couples in love, good gay friends, friends telling one another that they love one another...which is always a good thing. Has a lot of boring, vanilla, alleged gay male sex scenes, where the men just kiss and hug. I guess any plot about love might be basically good. HOWEVER.... a romance about sleeping with and falling in love with your dead life-partner's offspring? And that this is OK because they're lonely gay men? Beyond disturbing and insulting to my intelligence. That this film badly attempts to romanticize this storyline with the justification of there not being enough available gay men in Atlanta, GA... would be funny if it were not so utterly absurd, sad and misleading.

I do enjoy low budget indie type films, but this one didn't do it for me.  I thought it was horribly overacted...I think that was partly due to bad writing.
