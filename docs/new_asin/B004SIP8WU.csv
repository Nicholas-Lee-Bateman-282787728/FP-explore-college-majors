4462863,2,B004SIP8WU,"I confess that I couldn't watch the movie for more than the first 30 minutes and then bits and pieces from later portions. The part i watched deserved one star but, to give the movie the benefit of the doubt, i made it 2 stars.

The reason i couldn't go on watching was that this ""comedy"" was too painful for me. Here's a homely, overweight, dismally stupid young woman. She can't help that, admittedly. But she is also lazy, dishonest, and irresponsible, and, despite her resolutions, does not reform her ways.

I did not find it amusing, and i did not find her girl friends amusing either.",1339200000,,591,4.514018691588785
4462864,4,B004SIP8WU,"I ordered the 2011 version thinking the later release would be enhanced for widescreen TVs, but the dvd I got was the version that is not enhanced so the picture is in a small rectangle in the middle of my TV.  Very disappointing.  I don't know if I got the wrong version as there is no marking on the box to indicate whether it is the 2011 release or an earlier one.  If someone has the 2011 release, and a widescreen TV, please note in a review if the picture plays as it should.  If it does, sell it to me!  I loved this movie the first time I saw it, and still have the VHS in full screen.  Would love to update to widescreen dvd.",1321488000,4,634,3.992063492063492

4462908,1,B004SIP8WU,"Be aware that this is a sad, disturbing, depressing movie.  It is billed as an hilarious comedy worthy of 2 thumbs up.....I wholeheartedly disagree.  The family dynamic is abusive and disturbing.  The father/husband is deplorable to his wife and children.  The mother is ignored and verbally abused.  The topics covered are suicide, mental and physical illness, cancer, paralysis, neglect (children & domestic), verbal abuse to sad, neglected children  All of these topics can be and have been covered in elegant, thought-provoking movies - this movie is NOT one of them.  The laughs are few and far between, and depression & darkness hangs in the air during and afterwards.  Cannot recommend this movie.",1442016000,,704,5.223214285714286
4462909,4,B004SIP8WU,"This is one of my favorite films, though it is not easy to watch, and I didn't always like the main character, though I sympathized with her.  That said, being older and meeting other lonely clingy unwanted young women desperate for friends in real life, I actually have less empathy for her in retrospect.

Muriel, played too naturally by Toni Collette (she subsumes the character), is the daughter of a venal politician and his weary neglected wife.  Muriel is lazy, manipulative, sly, and also very creepy.  Her pretty girlfriends no longer want to associate with her, and they tell her that, and though Muriel is initially dismayed, she rebounds, as enthusiastic as ever.  Being at the same vacation resort that her friends disinvited her to.

There, Muriel meets former outcast Rhonda, played with aplomb by Rachel Griffiths (in my opinon, one of her best roles ever), who practically forces life on her.  Rhonda relishes life.  They room together.  But a terrible accident hurts Rhonda, but Muriel is too weak to stand up and protect her friend.

Muriel is not a likable person.  She is shallow, selfish, and she is not a good person.  Regardless, you root for her, because you sense the good inside, and you understand why two men - one good and an Olympic champion, and the other a loner - long for her comfort.

One of my favorite scenes - Rhonda's mother's face for her daughter's happiness.

This is not a perfect film.  But its wayward steps are what make this film genuine and precious, and I liked how lost all the characters are.

Good for Muriel.",1441497600,,1562,4.729629629629629

The movie actually has a plot which makes sense - I watch it a few times a year.  LOVE IT.  There is sadness in this movie as well, though.  But that's life - sometimes you laugh, sometimes you cry.

4462915,5,B004SIP8WU,"Enough has been written by other readers about this unique, funny, heartbreaking, and ultimately joyous film about an ugly duckling who manages to turn triumphantly into a swan (the old axiom 'Beauty is Only Skin Deep' truly applies here).

Toni Collette gives a brilliant, unforgettable performance as sad sack Muriel and she is more than ably abetted by an outstanding supporting cast. The songs of Abba have never been more perfectly incorporated into a movie. The final few minutes of 'Muriel's Wedding' are as memorable as the finale in the first ""Rocky'.

There is one major caveat, however, and it doesn't concern the movie. Unfortunately, 'Muriel's Wedding' is available in the states on a substandard DVD transfer. The image is non-anamorphic and though perfectly viewable, doesn't do justice to the film's excellent visuals. Amazon UK offers the Australian Blu-ray which is said to be outstanding. Why a Blu-ray edition has not been released over here is a big mystery.

'Muriel's Wedding' was not a critics' darling when released in the U.S. in '94. The film did receive it's share of positive reviews but many critics dismissed the film as overbearing, garish and cartoon-like regarding some of the characters and situations. I'll admit the film is an odd mix of comedy and drama but in this instance it works, beautifully. The cast is outstanding, but Toni Collette's brilliant, touching performance is the glue that holds the movie together. This is one of the most beloved films in Australia's film history and it is easy to see why. It is not a subtle film. Look elsewhere for a more restrained, intellectual comedy of manners if this doesn't seem like your cup of tea (and I like those kind of films too).

""Muriel's Wedding', like the title character, has a Big Heart. And along with the pain and rejection (and ultimate triumph) it is often hysterically funny.",1433376000,,1879,4.974522292993631

First, there are no sub-titles and with the Aussie accents, some of it was hard to understand. Second, it budged my internal humor meter only once - when the swimmer attempted to give his wedding vows. How can some reviewers claim this is ""hysterically funny?""  It's a really stupid plot and its only redeeming quality is a conclusion that finally shows some human tenderness.",1404172800,3,467,4.765432098765432

4462958,5,B004SIP8WU,"This is a wonderful film, an original farce and drama that could only have come out of Australia. If Hollywood filmed this story, it would be watered down, sappy and predictable. Instead, it's sharp and funny and human. The fabulous Toni Collette walks away with the movie in her breakout role. She IS Muriel/Marial. There's a lot of wisdom in this tale of dysfunctional families, bad girl cliques, the Cinderella myth, finding yourself, and the meaning of friendship. Watch out - Muriel will steal your heart.",1400889600,,510,4.941860465116279

4462960,1,B004SIP8WU,"Australia makes some really great movies but this isn't one of them.
The story revolves around Muriel, a young woman who wants a wedding but not a marriage. Her character comes through as someone who is selfish, untruthful and not adverse to a bit of larceny, even from her own family. Her friend Rhonda is promiscuous  and shallow. Muriel's father is a dishonest politician; a real crook while her mother is a pathetic, downtrodden figure who earns our pity rather than our admiration.
In short there is not one character in the film who we would want in our circle of family or friends. The film lacks a hero.
If you like ABBA there are some ABBA tunes that are lip-synced fairly well. This is about the film's only redeeming feature.",1398297600,6,736,4.6183206106870225
4462961,5,B004SIP8WU,"Saw this movie years ago and it just made me laugh.  Found it for about $5 on Amazon and treated myself to same.  When she walks down the aisle to ""I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do"" (not sure of exact name of song) by ABBA with the huge grin on her face, it cracks me up every time.  It comes in handy when I need a good laugh - cheaper than a stand-up comedy show!",1398211200,,361,3.5443037974683542
4462962,4,B004SIP8WU,"I like this movie a lot though I think they could have developed it more after Muriel's mother's funeral (alas this was near the end of the movie so it would have had to last longer). The scenes following Muriel's loss took on a potential turn in her 'arranged' marriage with the young Olympic hopeful. While the marriage was for profit to both, I was hoping that Muriel would have stayed in the arrangement for the length of the contract, allowing the writer to develop her more into a butterfly both emotionally and physically, perhaps changing that old stereotype that the handsome young man never stays with a plain Jane. Would have been interesting to see what they could have done with their relationship.",1395878400,,711,4.741935483870968

4462964,5,B004SIP8WU,I really disagree with the comments on the front cover of this movie. It is funny but it also is sad. The sad part about this movie is that there are people out in the real world like this. And it shows how verbal abuse is just as damaging or worst than physical abuse. And it shows how people shouldn't worry about what other people think of them and just be the self.,1387065600,3,369,4.068493150684931

4462968,5,B004SIP8WU,"Muriel (played by Toni Collette who gained 20 lbs for this role) hates being herself and tries everything to be somebody else including running away with her family's money, trying on wedding gowns while pretending that she is engaged and changing her name to Mariel!  She listens over and over again to ABBA songs to soothe the pain of her father calling her and her siblings ""useless"" all their lives.  She bumps into an old high school friend, Rhonda (played with glee by Rachel Griffiths), they get an apartment together in Sydney (the movie takes place in Austrlia), and Muriel's life becomes ""better than an ABBA song!""  There are four of the ""popular girls"" from high school hanging around who provide lots of laughs.  Muriel's true worth is discovered when her best friend, Rhonda, becomes ill.

Needless to say, the soundtrack is awesome, the script is hilarious and touching (her poor mother's depression is apparent), the pace and directing is perfect and resulted in a movie that I can watch over and over again!

4462975,5,B004SIP8WU,"Several reviews have provided the basics of the plot, so I'll just add this:

If you love high camp, you will adore this film (even though, ultimately, it's not high camp).  If you don't, you may have some trouble sticking with it at first, but please keep at it.  It reveals a complex portrait of Muriel and her family that will stay with you.  It's one of those seemingly silly movies that I found myself reflecting on for several days, and it definitely stands up to repeated viewings.

""Muriel's Wedding"" isn't entirely free of flaws, and the cliches seem more tired after it's clear what Toni Collette's incredible talents could have done with more subtle material.  Even so, the film flows through the different compartments of Muriel's life with beauty and clarity, and the result is one of the best coming-of-age movies ever made.",1366588800,,838,4.784722222222222

Since I'm a fan of Toni Collette, and the DVD cover was filled with blurbs about how great this movie was, I watched it.  I didn't find it ""Hysterically Funny!"" nor would I give it ""Two Thumbs Up!"" It also didn't make me want to ""stand up and cheer!""  Maybe if I'd seen the movie in the actual 90s when it came out, I may have viewed it differently.  There seemed to be a disconnect between the story lines and the characters and their reactions. Subjects like divorce, cancer, and suicide are glossed over, and how can their inclusion make a movie 'hysterically funny'? It was odd. I also had a hard time understanding some of what they said because of all the Australian accents.  There are much better Toni Collette movies out there.

When ever I saw it on Showtime I would watch it. Now that I have purchased it  I can watch it more. Great times.,1358812800,,276,3.9285714285714284

I first saw this movie one sleepness night and could not shut it off.  It is off the wall funny and wimsical, a must see and be seen again.  Deffintly a keeper!",1356912000,,208,4.048780487804878
4462982,5,B004SIP8WU,"This movie is one of those movies that makes you think about your own confidence in who you are in life. You want to cry and laugh all at the same time. At some pome points you wonder exactly where the movie is going and you wonder how could all this end? In the end you cant help but smile and no matter how much of a saint you think you might have been throughout your life, you think about that one time when you really pulled one off. You might not have stole a dress to wear to a wedding, but we have all told a tale or two in our times..",1355270400,,543,3.814159292035398
4462983,5,B004SIP8WU,"I caught this movie on TV randomly. I fell in love with it. It starts off as a weird comedy/coming of age movie where the family is pretty weird and kind of crazy. It stays funny throughout just via quirky moments, but actually becomes quite sad as Muriel matures and grows into who she will be. The scene in the wedding shop where she kind of breaks down was devastating to me. If you've ever felt not good enough you'll probably relate. I think it stays true to learning who you are, and accepting you for you. Overall an interesting journey, really fun, and still has a message of making it through hard times; and staying true to who you are - even if you've changed and don't know it. Be prepared to be sad, not all a comedy though, just a warning (I was NOT prepared).",1349654400,2,774,4.272108843537415
4462984,5,B004SIP8WU,"The package photo and other marketing for this movie gives the expectation that this movie will be a lightweight, light-hearted stereotypical ""chick flick"" and-or romantic comedy.  It is not.

I first saw this movie several years ago, and was very impressed. Well written characters with depth and realism; well acted.  I highly recommend.

The main character, Muriel, is a young woman who is obsessed, in a pathetic, dysfunctional way, with finding a fiance and having a beautiful wedding ceremony. The main question of the plot is whether this obsession will ruin her life.

There is much more to this film.  Some of the scenes were disturbingly real; for example the scene where she is confronted by frenemies, and she crumbles, not handling it well. The plot includes unpredictable events, surprising scenes.  Also many comic moments, especially if you notice the small details.

By the way, her other obsession is ABBA music, which adds a fun, silly dimension to a sometimes dark film.",1345593600,,990,5.067901234567901

8439791,4,B004SIP8WU,"I haven't seen the DVD, but the movie itself is a scream. Probably not for everybody, but for this 60-something American man. The irony is as deep as the drone of a digeridoo, so anybody who finds it touching missed the point. It's worth $6.59 just to watch it once, even though it is patchy. And indyish. And very Ozzy. And somewhat estrogen-soaked. It's worth watching just to see the beginnings of the immensely talented Toni Collette as the dizzy, desperate dreamer. Have a hankie handy, but not for tears of sympathy, for tears of laughter.",1516060800,,545,4.6875
