Knowing they had a crappy movie they figured to title the movie are you scared 2.  The movie is such horribly filmed as if the cameraman was tripping on acid throughout the whole film, possibly even the entire crew was under the influence. It's really that bad and I love cheesy b movie's that are fun and Entertaining.",1463875200,,463,4.447058823529412

8320101,2,B001LXIDV8,"Wait a minute!  This horrible movie actually has a part one?  Believe it or not, part one might actually be worse than part two!  This is a terrible movie all around.  Two teenage girls and two teenage boys enter a house that's basically set-up and filled with traps and a murderer.  Not only that, it's completely filled with video cameras everywhere following the teens every movement.

Tony Todd who is normally an extraordinary talent in the land of horror films and usually very believable in his role, comes off extremely tame and uninteresting here.  Tony sits in a dark room watching the teens get captured and tormented all day.  That's ALL he does!  Not even his spooky deep voice can save his character here.  Even when the one girl gets caught and chained to the wall for a bloody torture lesson, it's hard to care about her fate due to the awkwardness of seeing blood drip out of her mouth constantly but never seeing the *reason* for the blood.

Later on the murders get stinkier.  In fact it's borderline on wondering if this movie is somewhat of a mockery of horror movies.  A girls runs away from a face-hiding murderer, the camera jerks, and now she's caught.  What the heck?  That's AWFUL writing and direction, not to mention a cheap gimmick.  Talk about a film that had potential but never came to fruition.  I'm actually upset the two teenage girls had to die.  Did you see how attractive they were?  They should have LIVED darn it!  The Adam Sandler lookalike murderer is probably the only decent character, despite how dimwitted he is.  I believe anyone would have been able to escape his clueless reign of terror.

Somehow even the escape from the house is made extremely uninteresting and lacking suspense or excitement of any kind.  Once again, due to the poor writing.  It turns out the outside field area (with giraffes in the background which admittedly makes the setting sort of unique) is also covered with hidden video cameras for Tony Todd's perverted pleasures but even being outside is still just as dreadfully unappealing as the previous segments.  A must avoid movie.  There's a reason only 5 people have reviewed it so far.",1390953600,2,2162,4.729222520107238

8320103,5,B001LXIDV8,"This movie shows that local casts can be excellent.  I love this movie and its rawness.  Victim number 1, Adrienne Hays, makes a real impression.  This movie is full of hot girls from Louisiana. It apparently was filmed there as well.  Worth buying and showing to your friends.  It is a genre flick and must be seen in that light.  Happy Geocaching...",1353801600,,351,4.580645161290323
8320104,2,B001LXIDV8,"This is a pretty cheesy b type movie, but we bought it for the geocaching part of it.  Will pass along to other cachers to watch.",1317168000,,129,3.9615384615384617
8320105,2,B001LXIDV8,"This is another typical example of the seemingly endless horror movie trend.  Just in order to make money we are constantly inundated with cheap, redundant horror flicks that are for the most part simply boring and cliche like.  This is, unfortunately, no exception to that irritating rule.  Another mindless horror film, that is supposed to be a sequal.  Well, don't fall for it, unless you don't mind wasting your time with cheap DVDs.",1235520000,4,437,4.945205479452055
8320106,1,B001LXIDV8,"This movie is horrible! Simply horrible. Bad acting, stupid story, terrible filming, and boring boring boring. It's not scary, it's not even funny. It's not even a sequel. The first 'Are you scared?' was lame too, but much better than this. I don't know why I watched this.",1235088000,4,273,4.708333333333333
