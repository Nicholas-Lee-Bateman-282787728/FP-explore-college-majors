8225097,5,B000WPV6JC,"This is a wonderful movie about the wandering minstrel Ashik Kerib, who undergoes a series of adventures before he can marry his love.  The story is quite simple, but the images are beautiful.  There are many haunting dreamlike scenes here.  In some ways it could easily be a silent film, as there are intertitles and many long and medium distance shots.  The important thing is not so much the actors but the scenes themselves.

One of the stars I've given is for the extras.  There is a nice 24 minute biography of Sergei Paradjanov.  This ties in to one of my complaints, though.  In the movie there are sections of Georgian dialogue that aren't translated, which is frustrating.  In the biography, which is overall nicely done, not everything is translated, but because it is in Russian I could understand it.  For example, he notes that his mother used to tell him stories, one of which was Ashik Kerib, but the translation doesn't mention the title.  This seems relevant, since that's the movie on the disc.  Also, it means that in addition to the dedication to Tarkovsky, the movie must partly be in memory of his mother.  This helps to explain a scene in which Kerib returns to his ruined house and eats an old piece of lavash, while the narrator talks about how the bread was baked by the mother.

In addition, there is a nice 12 minute biography of Mikhail Lermontov that shows the different places associated with his life.  As well as providing information on Lermontov, it also gives a sense of the socialist realist paradigm and how far Paradjanov diverged from that.  In general, if you really only can take realist cinema, socialist or not, Paradjanov is not for you.

Then there is an interesting 5 minute piece called ""The Minstrel's Song"" that gives b & w footage of the Caucasus.

This is definitely a film worth seeing.",1271376000,2,1840,4.679127725856698
8225098,5,B000WPV6JC,"This was the final film of Sergei Paradjanov, one of the greatest (and most unseen) filmmakers from the former USSR.  Despite making only a handful of pictures in his entire career, he still managed to remain an artist and he never lost his touch.  This film is one of his most mesmerizing films, and it's one of the most strikingly beautiful films ever made.

The film is based on an Armenian folk tale about a poor minstrel who has to find a fortune before he can marry his true love.  The film is told in typical Paradjanov style, ellipitcal, non-linear, and told mainly through music and imagery.  But what imagery!  And what music!  Paradjanov surpasses himself here, weaving some of his most spellbinding images in any of his work, and the soundtrack is one of the most unique in cinema history.  It's a shame that Paradjanov died only 2 years after making this film, and we were robbed of more films by him, but it does not diminish the film.  The film bristles with life itself.  It's my favourite Paradjanov film.

Sergie Paradjanov was also one of the most persecuted filmmakers in film history, possibly the most persecuted.  He was very outspoken against the Soviet government, his films were celebrations of Ukrainian, Georgian, and Armenian folklore (which was a big no-no in the USSR, where nationalist tendencies were to be suppressed in favour of Russian sensibilities), and he was very vocal about whatever was on his mind.  The authorties prevented him from making films for years, and when he did, they were heavily censored.  In 1974, Paradjanov was sentenced on trumped up charges, including ""incitement to suicide"" and homosexuality (a crime in the former USSR), for 15 years.  Due to international outrage and lobbying by foreign artists (including American author John Updike), he was released around 1980, but didn't make another film unitl 1984 (The Legend of Surami Fortress was that film).  The authorities did not break him.  He never lost his art.  Paradjanov remains untouched.",1241827200,5,2009,4.928571428571429
