4114110,5,B003EJO8KW,"I won't make this long,
but, 2 great movies.

30 years to life is more of a drama than a science fiction film.
Survivor is a twist on ALIEN.

Glad these 2 are now on DVD!",1322870400,2,170,3.6944444444444446
4114111,5,B003EJO8KW,THIS IS A GOOD DVD ONLY IF YOU ARE A FAN OF SCIENCE FICTION MOVIES OTHERWISE DON'T BUY IT BECAUSE YOU WON'T LIKE IT.,1316908800,,116,3.875
4114112,5,B003EJO8KW,"This is an awesome family movie! A little goofy kinda like Back To the Future, but just as awesome!",1516406400,,99,4.2631578947368425
4114113,4,B003EJO8KW,"Great scenes of cool homes I'd love to live in. Somewhat juvenile and unrealistic script, like a comic book. Cute story overall, it kept my attention. Very likable characters help make the movie work. It was unusual, so I liked it.",1513468800,,231,4.658536585365853
4114114,5,B003EJO8KW,"Loved the film, an awesome take on some old cult classics like ""THE INTRUDER WITHIN"" and ""JOHN CARPENTER'S: THE THING"", the creature design and effects are pretty awesome almost reminicent of those seen on the live action adaptions of ""THE GUYVER"", the CG is a little dated but is not as bad as some god-awful SYFY / THE ASYLUM saturday night flicks that came out over the years, its pretty rare so i highly recommended only to those CREATURE FEATURE fans out there.
As for the item itself, its a double feature in 1 DVD, not a scratch on the disc and it arrived in great shape as expected, and plays just fine too.",1482364800,2,615,4.4035087719298245
4114115,5,B003EJO8KW,I found out my cousin-In law had a CRAZY secret! He lived in Germany for a bit and had a role in this movie when he was young. He swore I would never find it... I did. The look on his face was priceless. Best five bucks I ever spent. Not a bad movie either. It's really fun in a retro sci-fi movie kinda way.,1478649600,2,308,3.753846153846154
4114116,5,B003EJO8KW,Excellent transfer of classic TV movies.,1472256000,,40,5.833333333333333
4114117,4,B003EJO8KW,"I have been looking for the movie Survivor  , its a good  Si-fi  movie",1438560000,,70,3.857142857142857
4114118,3,B003EJO8KW,ok.  nothing to write home about,1418342400,,32,4.333333333333333
4114119,4,B003EJO8KW,"I order this by mistake, but I decided to watched it anyway since I paid for it. The movie turned out to be better than I expected. Robert Hayes performance is great. He is a better actor than I thought or he just didn't chose good roles. The plot has a lot twist and turns on their legal system and how it mesh it out when the wrong person it convicted.",1384387200,,354,4.0
4114120,5,B003EJO8KW,"I enjoy watching Robert Hays in movies and tv, but thirty years to Life was a great film to watch.  Survivor was another great one after watching Greg Evigan in two stinkers of movies, 100,000,000 BC and Journey to the Center of the Earth really sucked for theme and ....., I was taught if I couldn't say anything nice don't say anything at all about the person, especially with these two movies that isn't on the DVD..",1360972800,,419,4.441558441558442
4114121,4,B003EJO8KW,"Though I am certain that his foray into the two ""Airplane"" movies of the early 1980's severely typecast Mr. Hayes, I have managed to catch some of his limited work and he always excells in his acting ability. It remains hard to watch him without thinking of him as a ""troubled"" pilot in the comedic Airplane movies but for once and in this film I did manage to forget his typecasting and thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
How the producers managed to make ""Wrinkling"" a Republican issue is beyond me. One would think that such an approach to punishment would appeal to the Sissiecrats because of their despite for the criminal justice system and their view of Capital Punishment as pure anathema. I overlooked that stick in the eye though and just enjoyed the movie.
It won't win any awards but it was an excellent movie anyway and kudos must be given to Robert Hayes for his lead role in the film. I merely rented the film but may look for a used copy for future viewing.
I highly recommend this movie despite the relatively harmless shortfalls of throwing in partisan politics as a sub theme of the movie. Just keep your mind open and enjoy the movie.
Since the film makers threw in partisan politics so will I by hoping that there comes a time when our Attorney General and his boss undergo a good 50 years of ""wrinkling"" as soon as possible for crimes committed against the State.",1341964800,6,1381,4.550200803212851

8395525,3,B003EJO8KW,Decent movie for it's time. Acting was so so and the futurism aspects were negligeble as it was not very far into the future while the graphics in the gaming part were lackidasicle. Not a must watch but definitely good for a uneventful poor weather day.,1518912000,,253,4.521739130434782
8395526,1,B003EJO8KW,"I can't recommend this at all, although it's got some good set designs and atmosphere. Most men are 15 year olds trapped in a 45 year old body anyway, so not much of a new idea here.",1518307200,,182,3.945945945945946
8395527,5,B003EJO8KW,"A good movie on Amazon Prime.  LOL.  Most of my FUN here is reading reading and laughing at bad movie reviews.  Sad!  LOL
1998 but still pretty much ""current"".....5 stars is relative for Amazon Prime freebies.  ;)",1518220800,2,213,4.648648648648648
8395528,1,B003EJO8KW,"Boring, slow paced.  Looks like a made for TV movie complete with scene breaks designed for commercials to be inserted.",1518220800,,119,4.95
8395529,5,B003EJO8KW,"Great original story line on a budget.  I enjoyed this movie and I think you will, too.  It is one you can watch with the whole family, not just the adults.  While the sfx are dated (come on, it is a 90's movie), it is a good movie none-the-less.",1518220800,2,246,3.979591836734694
8395530,2,B003EJO8KW,"Had my attention for maybe 15 minutes, then it was very slow, boring, predictable.  Especially the ending. Kept speeding forward, didn't miss a thing.",1518220800,,150,5.25
