5886551,5,B00E21QTG2,Bought this dvd for my great grandson for Christmas. Im sure he will like the movie. He is a big fan of Thomas the Train,1386374400,,120,3.84
5886552,2,B00E21QTG2,"It's okay, but be aware it is not a movie, just a series of Christmas episodes -- including some of the very old ones that they've dressed up with CGI faces but where all the engines have the same narrator/voice and the scenery stinks.  There is one new one with Sir Robert (from King of the Rails), but oddly enough, my two boys didn't really like that one.

Just be aware what you're getting.",1384905600,2,394,4.3108108108108105

5886558,5,B00E21QTG2,"Thomas and Friends Santa's Little Engine DVD is a super cute and fun DVD for any Thomas lover.  When I had the opportunity to review it I knew that my nieces and nephews would love it and I was right.  They sat down and watched the entire video for an hour and they were in love with the Christmas spirit. Briar who is 3 said, ""It's my Thomas movie"" when he saw the DVD.  And older sister Sage who is 4 enjoyed it as well, but Briar was the one that enjoyed it the most.

The first story is  ""Santa's Little Engine"" and Sir Topham Hatt is dressing up as Santa Claus so he could visit Sodor.  Which amazed Sage because Santa always visits everywhere, why wasn't he  always in Sodor.  Good question, but one that was easily answered with, of course he does, but now we have proof Santa visits Sodor.  Problem solved!!

Episodes Include:

  ""Santa's Little Engine""

  ""No Snow for Thomas""

  ""Frozen Turntable""

  ""The Missing Christmas Decorations""

  ""Snow Tracks""

DVD SPECIAL FEATURES

  Sir Topham Hatt's Frosty Friend Game

  Guess Who? Puzzles

There is one thing I know for sure Thomas and Friends Santa's Little Engine is a great DVD for just in time for the holidays!! Pick up your Thomas the Train Fan one today!!",1382313600,6,1221,4.47926267281106
5886559,5,B00E21QTG2,"I enjoy this new Thomas DVD. There were wonderful holiday stories.

In the first story ""Santa's Little Engine"", Sir Topham Hatt is dressing up as Santa Claus for the Christmas fair and rides a sleigh. Next in ""No Snow for Thomas"", Thomas doesn't like his snowplough and hides it, now he's stuck in the shed while everyone is having fun in the snow. In ""The Frozen Turntable"", The turntable at Tidmonth sheds is frozen, so the engines has to find a new place to sleep for the night. in the next episode ""The Missing Christmas Decorations"", Diesel 10 takes the Christmas decorations from Tidmonth sheds to the Dieselworks, and Percy teaches everyone the generous spirit of Christmas by giving Sidney a Christmas present. In the last story ""Snow Tracks"" (Which was previously released on the Thomas DVD ""Splish Splash Splosh"", But it was re-narrated by the new storyteller), Gordon thinks he can go through the snow without a problem.

During the DVD features 2 Mr. Perkins segments which he reads a story and writes a postcard. Plus new activities are featured between the episodes as well. The DVD Bonus Features are ""Sir Topham Hatt's Frosty Friend"" Game & ""Guess Who?"" Puzzles.

I give this DVD 5 out of 5 stars because I enjoyed it a lot. So hope you enjoy this review.",1381536000,11,1271,4.716216216216216
5886560,3,B00E21QTG2,"Our son loves Thomas.  We loved the new DVD.  But as his parent, and a long time connoisseur of entertainment media, I have a few issues with this DVD.

First of all, the DVD we were sent was presented entirely in a 4x3 aspect ratio.  This DVD is brand new, and for a show made using computers in the year 2013, I find myself a little frustrated at the lack of options here.  I mean, my son could care less about a detail like this, but I don't understand why they would do this when the last time I saw a 4x3 tv for sale was about five years ago.  It just feels cheap.

  One of my son's favorite parts of these videos are the sketches between each episode with Mr. Perkins.  They've cut Mr. Perkins' screen time down to two segments, which do not take place in the engine driver's common room.  In each sequence, he spends the majority of the time reading off a script while images fill the screen (one of these being a recap of the new film released last month).  I was disappointed to see this, because my son adores Mr. Perkins.  He wasn't really talking to the kids and being silly like he usually does.  The other spots that would usually feature him were instead little fillers of Thomas trivia.

  I feel bad picking out these issues, but I feel like HIT could have done much better on this release.  It is still an enjoyable show for my son, and we are happy to add it into our collection.

*Edit 22 October 2013*

  I wanted to add that I feel that my complaint about the show being presented entirely in a square, 4x3 aspect ration is valid because the feature itself is prefaced with several commercials in widescreen..  It makes no sense to me why they would place advertisements in better quality than the actual feature itself.  Why is it okay for my son to watch the Thomas cartoons that I bought this DVD for in a smaller picture, while a commercial for a Hard Rock Cafe in Punta Cana (seriously?) is fully rendered in beautiful widescreen?",1381363200,37,1958,4.330578512396694

Unfortunately, we thought that this would be a new Christmas themed feature, but no, it's just recycled episodes with interludes to piece them together. The kids don't care, but we were hoping for a reprieve from the same episodes. No such luck.

The really frustrating part is that we already have at least two of the stories on our DVR. GRRR!
