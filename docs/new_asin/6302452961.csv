468235,5,6302452961,"Bliss of islanders Terangi (Hall) and Marama (Lamour) is threatened by overzealous, rigid (yet tenderly devoted to wife Germaine) colonial governor De Laage (Massey), obsessed with the letter of the law--until nature intervenes to settle the conflict and soften De Laage's heart.  Enduring a lengthy period of false incarceration, Terangi is reunited with beloved Marama and young daughter Tita--on the eve of the hurricane that will overwhelm their tiny island, yet ironically, despite great human toll, reconcile persecutor and persecuted.  Awesome, riveting hurricane sequence still is unsurpassed after more than sixty years.  Ever intensifying gale force winds tear away the tattered tricolor, signalling the end of colonial government's vain attempt to impose bureaucratic order on the island.  Storm surge violently and indiscriminately carries away trappings of church and state,  as nature asserts its primacy over man.  Top notch cast, especially Mary Astor as De Laage's gracious wife Germaine, more than hold their own with the hurricane--the real star of the film.",982454400,8,1077,5.658385093167702
468236,5,6302452961,This film is very exciting and has good production. It the head of its  time in the seventh art for its high quality effects. The message of the  film is about destructive natural hurricane with its similar hurricane of  human life represented in black side of man. I.e. hatred injustice and  conspiracy. These bad things are the true hurricane that travels inside man  which would get ride of what it meets like natural hurricane. This is quite  clear in the film the ruler(Raymond Massey ) and the young man(Jon Hall ).  The similarity between the two films is the destruction of every thing that  the hurricane meets.

468237,5,6302452961,"As a fan of Goldwyn films, I have always enjoyed this magical piece of hokum for it's unusual story, haunting musical score, appealing actors and especially for the terrific special effects which have never been exceeded in their overall effectiveness in nearly 65 years. Dorothy Lamour is beautiful as Marama and Jon Hall gives us his best-remembered performance as Terangi. Mary Astor plays Germaine with rare charm and grace and Raymond Massey is her husband, the Governor you love to hate. In all actuality, this makes a great family picture and for those who are interested, there's a colorized version. The theme is the haunting ""Moon of Manakoora"".",944265600,2,655,5.074074074074074
468238,5,6302452961,"No doubt the high point of this classic is the nearly 30 minute disaster sequence. I'm still wondering how they made it look so real and lifelike. Those waves were HUGE and frightening! This is a grand achievement for John  Ford. It echoes images of Romeo and Juliet and it has its suspenseful  moments when Jon Hall must escape his captors. Those action scenes  depicting his escape are amazing. But that storm sequence is the heart of  the film. It's loud, terrifying, shocking, and so real. I'm still awed by  it. The music is also an added plus. No other composer can capture the  emotion of an idyllic ocean paradise before the onslaught of disaster. I'm  surprised that Academy didn't give this a special Oscar for its chilling  effects. They were DECADES ahead of its time to be so stunningly effective.  It is a gem from the great John Ford.",923616000,,849,4.6066666666666665

468381,5,6302452961,"This is a vintage film from 1937.  There were outstanding actors in the cast such as Raymond Massey, Dorothy Lamour, Jon Hall, C. Aubrey Smith, Mary Astor, Thomas Mitchell, John Carradine and Jerome Cowan.  This film portrayed how harsh an intolerant Governor of an Island could upend the idyllic pacific paradise.  In addition, it was an excellent portrayal about the destruction of an Island by a horrid hurricane.  This is really a landmark disaster film out of Hollywood because it is a true-to-life relief in similar circumstances how some Islands are destroyed and reduced to just a sandbar in ocean tsunamis, typhoons and hurricanes today.  The tremendous impact of this movie is how such destruction could happen today.  This is a classic movie in my DVD collection and excellent for family viewing.",1461369600,,807,5.075757575757576
468382,5,6302452961,"I fell in love with this movie the first time I saw it.  I would love to see a good remake of this film starring Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson.  I think this role is custom made for him & under the right direction could win him a Oscar.  This may sound hilarious to many but I think ""The Rock"" is highly underrated as a actor & many can't see past his physique.  I really think he is fully capable of expressing the full range of emotions Terangi experiences in this classic film!  Unfortunately the issue's of racial injustice in the legal system is just as relevant today as it was in the 30's when this classic film hit the big screen!!!  Many of my friends have never seen this Movie & confuse it with the movie of the same name about the boxer ironically imprisoned unjustly if I remember correctly.  Not only are the characters in this movie very endearing the special effects are outstanding even by todays standards!  If you have never seen this movie I highly recommend it!  If you can't connect & be thrilled by this classic ...check your pulse because you don't have a heart!!!  I wish I had the money to purchase a extra to donate to my public Library so those that have concerns about this movies age & ability to entertain can lay those concerns to rest.  Chances are once they see this movie they will want to add it to their collection.",1457481600,,1348,4.352

468384,5,6302452961,"This is one of the best John Ford films I've seen. It takes place in a small island in the South Pacific. The major conflict involves Terangi's stubborn willingness to live free against the French colonial code's desire to impose the rule of law and civilization upon Terangi and his community. Terangi, played by Jon Hall, represents nature in its pure innocence, while Governore Delaage, played by Raymond Massey, is obsessed with maintaining the law even above all personal emotions and passions. When Terangi gets imprisoned for hitting a white official in self-defense, his community is angered by this injustice. And while those who are close to the governor attempt to persuade him to grant forgiveness to Terangi, the latter refuses stating that nothing is above the law. Among those closest to the governor is Dr. Kersaint, played by Thomas Mitchell, who knows well the natives and often pleas to the governor on their behalf when their innocent ways interfere with the rule of law being imposed by the French administration. The governor's wife, played by Mary Astor, Captain Nagle, played by Jerome Cowan, and Father Paul, played by. Aubrey Smith also beg the governor to interfere on Terangi's behalf with no result.

The governor's obsession with the rule of law and Terangi's prolonged imprisonment may seem too far-fetched, perhaps, too melodramatic. Nevertheless, in this film, under Ford's direction, these excesses work well in a story that pits the positive ideas of nature against the cruelties often imposed by the civilized world. In addition to this, the film is beautiful when showing scenes of marriage and community people celebrating, and it is equally frightening when showing the scenes of the hurricane. Thus, I found the film enjoyable, captivating, and fascinating because of the plot, the landscape, and the impressive hurricane scenes. The entire hurricane scene is just incredible, considering that no CGI was available back then.

The film is properly restored and it has an informative audio commentary about the movie's production and how this film properly fits in John Ford's oeuvre.

This was a great movie-watching experience.",1451433600,,2168,5.224137931034483

Excellent Dramatic Direction by John Ford and Technical (Hurricane) direction by Stuart Heisler, great production values, excellent Cinematography (for me the best of the year) and musical direction, masterly editing of image and sound and of course very good acting along the cast (specially Raymond Massey, C. Aubrey Smith, Thomas Mitchell and Jon Hall); it sounds repetitive but all I can say that this catastrophe is the best done in the history of cinema (despite other major disasters represented in film past and future)and its special effects are so realistic they are terrifying and shocking to see. Excellent story and adaptation; this is a classic in every sense of the word. Too bad the stock is over for many who want to see it. Luckily for me I found a seller on Amazon that offering the DVD to a reasonable price; today there are no units available (new). To seek it!

468444,5,6302452961,"Director John Ford's awesome drama set in the fictitious French South Sea island of Manikoora is a film portraying the love between native islanders Marama played by a sultry and saronged Dorothy Lamour and bronzed hunk Jon Hall playing Terangi.  The joyous union between this couple in this idyllic tropical setting is soon shattered.  The story is narrated by Thomas Mitchell playing Dr. Kersaint who is reminiscing about Manikoora as he returns on a cruise ship.

Terangi is the toast of the island, an expert sailor and first mate on a local sailing ship.  On a trip to Tahiti, a racial slur against him and his mates results in an assault of a white skinned local bully.  Hall breaks the man's jaw and is sentenced to a 6 month sentence.  Abhoring confinement and suffering against inhumanne treatment by a sadistic warden played by John Carradine, Hall's sentence gets extended to 16 years owing to numerous unsuccessful prison breaks.  The governor of Manikoora, De Laage played by Raymond Massey, whose overzealousness in his views on justice and how the rule the islanders refuses to intercede on Hall's behalf.  Stubbornly against the advice of his wife played by Mary Astor, Father Paul, the local priest played by C. Aubrey Smith and Mitchell playing the doctor, he lets Hall rot in jail.

Finally after 8 years, Hall escapes embarking on a perilous 600 mile journey to return to his wife Lamour and their daughter who he's never seen.  As if on cue the winds start picking up as if God is voicing his displeasure.  What follows is the most outstanding depiction of a murderously devastating Pacific typhoon I have ever seen.  The filming done on 1937 San Catalina Island was so realistic as to be incomprehensible as to how it was attained, with a roaring sea crashing in, trees being uprooted and dwellings being pulverized.  The total destruction of the island was filmed in about a 15 minute jaw dropping sequence leaving few survivors.

Never having seen this outstanding film before, I would have to put it near the top in the magnificent resume of director John Ford's work.",1167868800,45,2093,4.842696629213483
468445,4,6302452961,"I have always been a fan of John Ford's movies.  He has a unique style of movies that are wholesome without being irrelevant.  He always seems to have a major social community event such as a wedding or a funeral that helps identify the unity of the society.  He often has an individual that is or becomes an outsider to that same society and, through that antagonist, we gradually discover both the positive and negative traits of each.  There is always a romantic aspect and a religious aspect to the movie as well.  By the time the movie has ended, we have usually discovered how the individual has succeeded or failed as well as how the society has been affected by the events in the movie.  Life goes on although often a bit sadder but wiser.  We, in turn, are often a bit sadder but wiser as well.  Happy endings occur in Ford's movies but usually at a price.

""The Hurricane"" exemplifies all of the above but with the added feature of an unusual amount of special effects.  This 1937 movis brings to the screen a surprisingly effective re-enactment of a tropical typhoon.  (I believe that ""hurricane"" is a term unique to the Atlantic Ocean and the Carribean Sea).  There are times that we get an obvious glimpse of actors superimposed against the background of turmoil.  However, much of the scenes are very effective and give a real sense of a powerful storm on the level of a hurricane.  The waves destroy and overwhelm the small island (that suddenly becomes so small that most of the island seems to have disappeared before the storm even arrived-or did I miss something?).  One soon comes to understand that stuntmen and women are filling in for the stars because these folks are dealing with some heavy waves.  I guess I'd better not try top oversell the special effects but they were clearly beyond what I had expected to see in a movie made nearly 70 years ago.

There is a plot to the movie and, as I suggested earlier, it follows the general guideline of a John Ford movie.  The hurricane (if you will) doesn't hit until the movie is at least 4/5's completed.  The film is well-directed but it is not one of Ford's best movies as far as the plot goes.  It is probably his best movie as far as the special effects go.",1138406400,7,2233,4.493796526054591

I watched on it on my portable 7"" DVD player and cannot wait to rerun it on the larger TV. It was in one word spectacular. The special effects of 1937 made the hurricane scenes come alive. You don't need the computer generated effects of a movie such as the new STAR WARS to hold your interest.  Sure its Black and White but that makes it even better. Bravo John Ford, Bravo Jon Hall, and Bravo to Amazon.com  for making this classic 1937 film available. Five Stars plus  from Connecticut.",1116460800,22,496,4.417582417582418

468449,5,6302452961,"The main reason to watch this 1937 film directed by John Ford is for the special effects as the title storm wrecks the fictional island of Manukura and strips it clean of almost all of the trees and all of the people.  Certainly the cornball romance in ""The Hurricane"" between the native girl Marama (Dorothy Lamour) and the sailor Terangi (Jon Hall) is not particularly captivating.  Terangi is unjustly imprisoned for a murder he did not commit and escapes just as a hurricane strikes the island and makes it difficult for him to return to his wife while impact every other subplot in this film, which have to do with the sort of mix of racism and classism that existed between whites and Polynesians during that time.  Things get rather melodramatic, but the key thing is that when the big storm blows in that you have the definite idea this is God's judgment on these people.

The story is told in flashback by Dr. Kersaint (Henry Mitchell in an Oscar nominated role for Best Supporting Actor) and we find that the island of Manukura was a place where the happy natives chaffed under the rigid rule of the French governor, Eugene De Laage (Raymond Massey).  Terangi and Marama are married early in the film, first in a Christian ceremony by Father Paul (C. Aubrey Smith) and then by Chief Mehevi (Al Kikume) in a native one.  However, Captain Nagle (Jerome Cowan) needs Terangi, who works as a navigator, to get the ship to Tahiti, so the honeymoon for the happy couple is really short.  While on Tahiti, Terangi gets into trouble and ends up in prison, and except for Governor De Laage, everybody back on Manukura, is aware this is a gross injustice.  So when Terangi escapes and accidentally kills a prison guard, De Laage intends to have him arrested and executed.  Meanwhile, there is a big storm brewing as we get an ample reminder of why this film is entitled ""The Hurricane.""

The hurricane sequence is what justifies rounding up and giving this one five stars for this film as giant waves and battering winds destroy the sets and miniatures alike.  You want wind and water signifying fury, then ""The Hurricane"" provide each, working in a lot less stock footage of an actual storm than you might suspect.  Let me put it this way: the special effects in this 1937 film are at least as impressive as anything you see in ""The Perfect Storm"" (Do not be surprised that special effects from this decade can be so effective: was anything in ""Twister"" more impressive than the stocking they used for the tornado in ""The Wizard of Oz""?).  The film was adapted by Oliver H.P. Garrett into a screenplay by Dudley Nichols, with some uncredited help from Ben Hecht, from the novel by James Norman Hall and Charles Nordhoff (authors of ""Mutiny on the Bounty"").  The supporting cast features Mary Astor as the more sympathetic wife of the governor and John Carradine as the sadistic warden.

Kino Lorber has released the two most impressive disaster movies made before World War II:
-- ""The Hurricane"" (MGM 1937)  is an important film from an important director. REVIEWED ON THIS PAGE
-- ""Deluge"" (RKO 1933) is the cheesy first effort of a 22 year-old director who went on to a long career in B-Movies:
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deluge-Blu-ray/dp/B01MRW00P5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deluge [Blu-ray</a>]
Nevertheless, both films receive the deluxe treatment with helpful commentary tracks.
""The Hurricane"" is clearly the greater film, but ""Deluge"" was actually the more innovative production.

Kino Lorber has released both films on Blu-Ray:
""The Hurricane""  comes with a commentary track and movie trailer.
The Blu-Ray image still has some scratches, but the sound is clear.
My only complaint is that it does not have English subtitles.
""Deluge"" also includes a commentary track, and this time Kino Lorber provides English subtitles.

Today, with CGI (computer generated imagery) it's easy for Hollywood to create spectacular special effects, but eighty years ago special effects artists really were artists.
The thirties are remembered for horror movies (Universal) and science fiction (King Kong, Flash Gordon),
but one special effects genre that basically had to wait until the 1970s was the disaster film.

""The Hurricane"" (MGM-1937) was produced using the primitive special effects technology of the 1930s:
A Pacific island is destroyed in fifteen minutes by a hurricane and tidal wave.
There was some use of miniatures, but most of the filming involved putting actors on a soundstage and dowsing them with firehoses.
The actors included 74 year-old C. Aubrey Smith who emerged none-the-worse-for-wear from the experience (he lived another eleven years).
Directed by the legendary John Ford.
Impressive.

But the first disaster film of the sound era was ""Deluge"" (RKO-1933), where New York City is destroyed in five minutes by an earthquake and tidal wave.
New York was accurately recreated with six foot tall buildings, then reduced to rubble by vibrating platforms and a fire hose.
The actors got a little wet, but nothing like what happens in ""The Hurricane"".
Directed by the non-legendary Felix Feist.
Cheesy (but entertaining).

""Deluge"" is very much a pre-code film.
The threat of rape in post-apocalyptic New York is a major theme of ""Deluge"" (termed ""molestation"" in the film).
Female star Peggy Shannon plays an Olympic swimmer, giving her an excuse to wear a bikini in much of the film (they didn't become popular in America until after World War II).
More revealing than Dorothy Lamour's Tahitian costume in ""The Hurricane"".
The Hollywood Production Code went into effect between the two films.
