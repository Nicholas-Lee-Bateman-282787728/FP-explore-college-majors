8580180,5,B007BHA0ZK,A beautiful dance of light and color. This film was absolutely breathtaking to watch. The poetry of the human spirit was truly captured.,1448668800,,136,4.956521739130435
8580181,3,B007BHA0ZK,"An interesting take on the love life of King Solomon. Jason Croot is convincing in the role. The sets and locations are beautiful. The musical score is authentically Hebrew. This indie is not bad. Sit back, relax, and imagine yourself transported to Solomon's time. Beware, there is nudity.",1448323200,,290,5.0625
8580182,3,B007BHA0ZK,"Quite a departure from Croot's comic series LE FEAR.
SONG OF SOLOMON is quite an ambitious undertaking.  The cinematography is lush.  It bears re-reading SONG OF SOLOMON as a companion to the film.  Nicely cast, as well.  Looking forward to seeing more Jason Croot films.",1448150400,,271,4.955555555555556
8580183,3,B007BHA0ZK,"I was interested in seeing this for two reasons. The first one is that I was also recently involved in a period piece project that took place in 600 BC and I wanted to see how another low budget team solved the problems that we also ran into. The second one is Jason Croot, an actor who happens to be one of my favourites and one who is far too underused in my opinion. UK film would benefit more from his talents. As ever, I enjoyed his understated but fierce performance. All other actors did a fine job, but none were up to the level of Mr. Croot. The production itself was struggling for credibility but overall I found it to be a bold undertaking and well worth a look. Do not be deterred by the nudity, it was in no way offensive or gratuitous.",1447891200,,750,4.179310344827586
8580184,5,B007BHA0ZK,"Jason Croot is a great friend of mine.. he's a wonderful actor and director. This film had some great visual eye catching scenery shots..  I wish I knew more about the characters in depth. It is based off the Songs Of King Solomon. Which is a period piece so I understand the tone. Set department did a great job finding the right sets.... I thought they had great costumes changes. The film score seemed very fitting. Everyone did well.
Great Artistic piece !",1447804800,,460,4.542168674698795
8580185,5,B007BHA0ZK,"You can follow along in your bibles, this drama takes you through the often overlooked Song of Songs in the Old Testament.  100% faithful and most atmospheric.  Much of this film was shot in Greece and the scenes have a middle-eastern feel to them.  King Solomon, a tormented soul, finally meets the woman of his dreams, Shulemith.  Our king lives a sinful existence, treating women as property, and acting selfish.  Then Shulemith arrives and he changes.  In fairness, Solomon has a bad side which is contrasted by the Solomon who courtships Shulemith.  On one hand, we have God's ideal for a perfect man-woman relationship, but it is contrasted with man's ideal of a man-woman relationship.
There is nudity in this, not gratuitous, and it is designed to show the carnal person that the Solomon w/o Shulemith is like.  The vocalist is amazing and is singing this story in Hebrew throughout.",1447718400,2,891,4.8933333333333335

8580187,1,B007BHA0ZK,"After returning home from an interment, I reclined to watch my copy of Song of King Solomon.  I had not been able to locate any reviews concerning this movie.  So I took a chance!  When I started seeing a totally naked woman, I knew I had been hoodwinked.  This film should be called ""The Song of Solomon: The Skin Flick Version"".  If the movie only warned people that vivid nakedness is included, I would have more respect for the producers.  I will take my loss as I crack my DVD copy of ""Solomon"" into tiny little pieces so others will not be tricked like I have been.  I won't be fooled by Croot and Southouse again though!  And they can keep the change!  but Amazon.com needs to do a better job of providing clear decriptions of the products they peddle for others!  We keep you guys in business!",1355443200,,801,4.351351351351352
