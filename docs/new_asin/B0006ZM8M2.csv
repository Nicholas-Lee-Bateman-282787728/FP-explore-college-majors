2198454,4,B0006ZM8M2,"I don't have the complete 9th season. I have seen the whole season. I have some issues with the way they rejoice over pornagraphy and they are all pretty loose sexually. They don't say the 2 worst words but they do curse. Even though I have a lot of reservations about Friends, it is still funny and very enjoyable. And I like all the characters, they are all very good actors. I can't imagine that there are too many People that haven't even seen a episode. It's about friendships we all wish we had. So as they say eat the hay and spit out the stubble!!!!!!!!! In others words even though I am not pleased with various scenes, it is still worth watching. So if you need a good laugh most of the time there are Laugh out loud moments. Watch I think you will be glad you did.",1438387200,2,775,4.208053691275167

2198477,4,B0006ZM8M2,"To be clear, I ADORE Friends. It is the only show I can watch on repeat without ever getting tired of it! The reason I'm giving it 4 stars is that I was hoping that the episodes would include the full length time as the DVDs do (FYI: the show on TV doesn't actually play the entire episode. They cut out a few minutes worth of dialogue and plot to shrink it for TV. The full length episodes are on the DVDs.). I find myself really missing those extra couple of minutes, but I'm a hardcore fan. If that doesn't bother you, go for it! You can't ever go wrong with Friends.",1420502400,2,570,4.098214285714286

2198509,5,B0006ZM8M2,"One of TVs most beloved series. It never lets you down, and always manages to bring a smile to our faces. My wife introduced me to Friends, as I was one of those men who just never really watched it growing up. One Christmas I surprised her and bought all 10 Seasons and included a special ""coupon"" that I would watch every episode with her before next Christmas. I made good on my promise, and after watching all 10 seasons, I become a fan. Sure there are things to criticize, and I there are other series (like Arrested Development) that I personally like more, but Friends will always be a staple. If you just need to smile, it's one of the best things you can put into your DVD player.",1387324800,,689,4.3076923076923075

2198515,5,B0006ZM8M2,"Though it looked like the ninth season might be the last we hear of Friends, a last-minute decision made that untrue.  Thank God!  We can't leave  our friends in a foreign country with at least three relationships in limbo.  And to think this all started with an accidental proposal.  While the friends increase their numbers by one, another one must face the possibility of leaving New York.  Paul Rudd appears as a new love interest and he's certainly someone to hold on to.  A misunderstanding leads to some creative uses of the Discovery Channel.  Rachael's other sister comes around (for the first time) and sparks a disscussion about what would happen to Emma if both Ross and Rachael died (don't even joke!)  And by the end of it all, Chandler and Monica recieve some devastating news and make an important decision.  That all is just the tip of the iceberg, so get the ninth season of Friends and see the hundreds of things I haven't mentioned...it's totally worth it.",1378684800,,976,4.72189349112426

2198547,3,B0006ZM8M2,"For sheer enjoyment, it's a shame to say, this is my least favourite Friends season (probably tied with Season 1).  There's nothing particularly wrong with it, it's just that there's nothing much to grab the attention.  Well, that's not exactly true - there are, of course, some very funny episodes and story arcs - but taken as a sum over the whole season, I just didn't enjoy it as much as Seasons 2-8.

The ongoing plots illustrate the aging of the characters, much to the credit of the writers who made no attempt to try and keep the characters in a forever-young time warp.  For example, in my favourite arc, Ross is gaining reputation as a professor of paleontology, so much so that he's asked to give a keynote speech at a conference in the Caribbean (when Joey shows up at the conference hotel, he's shocked that Ross could be more popular than he!)  At the same time, Aisha Taylor is introduced as Ross's university colleague who immediately starts dating Joey.  Since the character is played by Aisha Taylor, it finally brings some real ethnic diversity to the program (which is never specifically emphasized, which is also to the writers' credit, given that they had received grief over the level of ""whiteness"" in the cast).

In other multi-episodic plot developments, Rachel has a crush on Joey, which feels contrived, and Monica and Chandler have trouble conceiving a child, which is an unexpectedly serious subplot.  Unfortunately, I never felt particualarly invested in either subplot.  But both were probably more interesting than the Mike-Phoebe relationship, which went from such promise early in the season to being very mundane/trite by the end.  There is a little liveliness supplied by the return of Hank Azaria's David, the physicist who moved to Minsk, and who is my favourite minor character.

But who are we kidding, really?  Anyone who's bought seasons 1-8 is also going to buy this, if only for completeness.  Every episode is still funny, and there are some very good episodes.  There are just none that really take off for me.  It almost seems like the pseudo-limbo the show was in (whether or not it would be the last season) was distracting.  As I recall, the 10th season, which was well-known to be the last, was tighter and had better subplots.  I'll let you know in my next Friends review!",1294704000,2,2325,4.816120906801007
2198548,5,B0006ZM8M2,"This is an awesome series. This is one of the best television series I've seen of the few that are on my list.

2198551,5,B0006ZM8M2,"The nationally acclaimed NBC sitcom Friends has gone down in history as one of the most influential television shows.  The show's premise follows the life of six ""twenty-somethings"" living in down town Manhattan.  It premiered September 22, 1994 and ran for ten seasons, having its last episode on May 6, 2004.  To say that it has made an impact in the twenty-first century is an understatement.  With a total of 236 episodes, each quirky story helped to shape and form how American's interacted with one another.  I can't remember being a teenager and not watching Friends.  It has been an intricate part of my adolescence and I truly wanted to be ""one of the Friends"", for the show was formed as if you really did feel like you were friends with these characters.  It has spawned multiple catch phrases and Friends idioms over the years, such as Joey's infamous ""How you doin?"" and Janice's whiney ""Oh, My God!"".  It even spawned a hair-do in the nineties called ""The Rachel""!

As I step back and viewed with a critical eye, four episodes from season eight, airing in 2002, it helped me to realize just how much our culture is portrayed within each of these six Friends.  At this point in the series, it was already a smash hit, and everyone was tuning in to see what would come next for these characters.  Ross and Rachel had just had their baby, Emma and were now living together, yet not in a relationship.  Monica and Chandler were married and trying to conceive, Phoebe had just started to date Mike (who would become her husband) and Joey was back on Days of Our Lives. Each had already turned thirty and had matured in their characters.
However, regardless of the story, its format allowed for viewers to turn in on any episode and still have an enjoyable experience.  This was one of the many selling points of the series.  It was filled with light humor, gags, cultural references, and physical comedy.  All ages were able to watch this show and connect in one way or another.
In the episode ""The One with Ross's Inappropriate Song"" (each episode is labeled as ""The One with..."") Ross tries to get his baby daughter to laugh and when he is out of ideas, he begins to rap the hit cult song ""Baby Got Back"", a popular song from the nineties.  The song makes her laugh and when Rachel gets back, she is obviously horrified that he could ever sing such an offensive rap song to their child.  Yet, when she herself fails to get Emma to laugh, Rachel also resorts to singing ""Baby Got Back"".  These small, yet hilarious stories are what make Friends so special.  They are every day people with situations that we can relate to.  Later in the season, it is revealed that Monica and Chandler are infertile and are faced with the issues of adoption and surrogacy, leading them to eventually adopting twins.  Yet with each problem, it is handled with comedy and an appropriate amount of seriousness.  We laughed with them and we cried with them.  Infertility has become a major issue of today's society and it was appropriate that one of the Friends had to deal with it.

 One thing I will mention is that their lifestyles are often overlooked because of the show's light humor and happy demeanor.  When in actuality, the amount of casual sex each Friend had I am surprised that they had not been more affected by STD's, emotional problems, and more unwanted pregnancies.  When watching a show like Friends, it is necessary as a teenager or a parent that these issues are addressed, and you can view the shows without receiving a skewed picture on causal sex or morality.  A major issue when watching television or anything in that matter is that you recognize it as fiction and separating it from reality.  For example, in actuality none of the characters could ever afford to live in such luxurious apartments in Manhattan and with the time you see them sitting around, it appears as if they never are working!

 Overall, you are the one who is responsible analyze what you are viewing and understand how you are being affected by it.  With the series Friends there are multiple positive attributes like a strong committed group of friends and knowing how to love one another in community.  Yet, they are not to be viewed as people living ""moral"" lives and we can't expect them to, they are just a reflection of the culture.  This show has been for a long time one of my absolute favorite television series.  With the release of the DVD box sets, viewers were now able to watch every single episode over and over again, learning the lines and laughing with the Friends.  I have thoroughly enjoyed watching this series and think the good outweigh the bad in this very likable sitcom.",1265155200,,4685,4.62953995157385

2198556,5,B0006ZM8M2,"Compared to Season 1, Season 9 is a totally different yet equally as funny production.  The opening year of the series exuded the feel of winter in New York City. The cinematography, especially in the One with Two Parts with sets from Rif's Cafe and focus on Ursula, added a sentimental hue that evoked nostaliga in the shows older fans. By season nine, the show had evolved into a play, scenery and sets completely secondary to the words and movements of the actors.  It works because we have watched the cast grow and age, just like us. Season 9 includes the utterly unbelievable ""The One with the Shark"" and the totally believable episode with Phoebe's birthday. It encompasses an event most of us have lived through.  I didn't know how much I liked Season 9 until I left it in a hotel room in NYC.

It has some of the best lines like when Rachel said ""Emma just said gleba."" I love the one with the lottery. I think this season has some great guest stars,even one who was on Family Guy.

It also has some sad parts like when Monica and Chandler found out that they may never be able to have kids. Phoebe and Mike break up but at the end of the season they get back together. Rachel's other sister Amy appears and she is really funny. Rachel falls in in love with Joey. Rachel goes back to work and Chandler gets a new job. His boss is played by Phil Lewis.

Some old jokes are just repeated and rehashed already with some no longer appropriate given the age of our Friends now.

The stories are still great and I am very happy where our Friends are now. Joey making it big. Phoebe finding true love. Chandler and Monica wanting to seriuosly start a family and so on.

2198592,5,B0006ZM8M2,"Ok so I love the 9th Season of Friends.  It was the funniest season of them all!  The best episode ( in my oppinion) is the second episode where Joey and Ross have a run in at the Coffee House and Joey doesnt know how to use air quates!  It is hillarious!!  Definatly a must-have for any ""friends"" fan!",1123459200,,302,4.067796610169491
2198593,5,B0006ZM8M2,"Season 9 deals with Rachel being a mother to the newborn Emma, the introduction of Phoebe's soon to be husband Mike (Paul Rudd), Chandler and Monica deciding to finally have a baby, and the last minute reemergence of Ross-Rachel-Joey triangle. I believe all of them produced productive stories for the characters except the triangle. I think it was a wrong turn not only was it already done before, it produced absolutely nothing except dragged the Ross and Rachel hookup. (I mean does anybody really think Rachel and Joey will end up together?) But I can forgive that wrong turn because Season 9 is a strong season in spite of that.

There are a number of standout episodes but here are my top five.

1. TOW the Lottery - this is an ensemble show and the fact that I chose this as the best episode of the season just proves that the show is really at its strongest when all the cast is together. There's some great one-liners, some slapstick, and some drama. I love this episode!

2. TOW Rachel's Other Sister - Another ensemble episode and another standout Thanksgiving episode. Christina Applegate gave an amusing performance. Some great one-liners from Rachel (""I went to the zoo yesterday, now I'm a koala bear"" ""Yeah Ross when I have a heart attack at a restaurant I want you there with your fossil brush"") Some classic Monica obsessing with the plates and kookiness of Phoebe (check out how she's the only one eating the food the way Monica asked them to protect the plates) and you've got a classic episode.

3. TOW Emma Cries - The girls stole this episode. And it was a relief that Emma would actually be used well as a comedic material  Lisa Kudrow was just a riot here (""This just proves that no good can come from having sex with Ross"" ""Have I gone deaf"") And there's the Ross-Joey storyline which is  a good B story.

4. TOW the Inappropriate Song - I like this episode largely because of Lisa Kudrow as Phoebe finally meets Mike's parents. I love how she adopts that ""upscale-Hepburnesque"" accent, how she inadvertently blurts out her not so impressive past, how she forces herself to eat meat, and how she brings Smelly cat in the conversation. I love everything about it.

5. TOW the Male Nanny - The 200th episode, Freddie Prinze Jr. surprisingly gave an amusing and not to mention a non-annoying performance. It's a funny storyline with Schwimmer and Aniston having some funny scenes. (""It's not like you just came in from branding cattle"" ""Its like firing Elmo"")

2198599,4,B0006ZM8M2,"I own all 9 seasons of Friends, and think the show is fantastic.  However, agreeing with everyone else, at the end of the series, it starts getting a little lackluster.  From the beginning of season 1  with 6 people in their 20s, all single and full of life to the end of season 9 with the same 6 people in their 30s, 2 of them married,  2 of them with a child, the show just starts to lose its liveliness. However thats not to say that season 9 doesnt have its funny parts. Not the best of all the seasons, but still a must own.  I recommend this to everyone.

*9.23 The One In Barbados, part 1

*9.24 The One In Barbados, part 2

*(9.23 and 9.24 are combined together in one episode with a approximate 1 hour long season finale.)

My favorite episode is the last one in this season which is 9.23 and 9.24 (which are combined together in one episode) because it is funny especially the scene of the sunny-rain of the speech to beach.  Also, the scene of the ping-pong game is funny.  And Finally, the final scene about the kissing is very touching.  However, other episodes are also funny.  Like 9.15, it is pretty good because Joey has an audition for a boardway play which he uses a special techinque to make those people (including the ""Lost World"" guest star) impressed.

Overall, this season is one of best season so far.  All the episodes are good.  Worth to watch it and worth buying.  Recommended to everyone. :)",1115510400,8,1812,4.420731707317073

2198602,5,B0006ZM8M2,"Along with Seinfeld and Frasier, Friends dominated the must-see TV of the 1990's. Winner of innumerable television awards, the show features the lives of six friends in their late-twenties/early-thirties living in New York City - Monica Geller (Courteney Cox), Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow), Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston), Ross Geller (David Schwimmer), Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc), and Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry). The six friends spend the majority of their time in a coffee house named ""Central Perk"" or in either Monica's apartment or Joey and Chandler's apartment.

The Friends (Season 9) DVD offers a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere in which Rachel, Ross, and Joey try to sort out their situation following Rachel's acceptance of Joey's accidental proposal. The three eventually conclude that no one was going to propose. Meanwhile, Chandler and Monica grapple with the prospect of moving to Tulsa when Chandler is promoted to president of his company... In other episodes, Ross makes fun of Rachel's male nanny, Ross and Phoebe get mugged, and Chandler and Monica visit a fertility clinic... In the season finale, Joey rebuffs Rachel's advance until he finds Ross kissing the girl he just broke up with. The season concludes with Joey and Rachel together...

2198603,1,B0006ZM8M2,"I've collected all Friend's seasons and I loved it, but this last one came with damage in disc 1, so I made my complain and Amazon sent me a replacement but the error continued, at chapter 3 the disc stops, so I decided to write to WB asking what's going on, and until today I have not received any news from them, so I have still problem with disc 1, I have tried it in 3 different DVD players brand.

So watch out!! cause I've paid twice delivery charges (cause I'm not in U.S., Amazon sent me replacement and shipping for free, but I have still to spend money on taxes and shipping on my country) and anyone (Amazon or Warner Bros.) can give me a solution to my problem, I asked to Amazon if they can send me this season proved and they said: delivery and sell areas are in different location, in resume if I send it again they can't assure me that next will works well, they refered me to Warner Bros. and I still waiting for an answer.

So my calification was based, not in the season but in the deffective DVD disc 1. And I think that I'm not the only one with the problem, cause if you check in NEW & USED, you can see that there's many people selling it!!!

2198604,5,B0006ZM8M2,"Heading into the ninth season of Friends, just about everyone associated with the show figured this was going to be their last season. Even fans were expecting the show to wrap when filming on the ninth season ended.

Only midway through season nine did the powers that be and the actors agree on one more season, a truncated 18 episodes for the 10th and final season.

With that possible ending in mind, writers had to be careful as they opened the season, knowing that they may be pushing toward a finale when the season drew to a close.

Getting caught up, season eight ended with the birth of Ross and Rachel's baby, Emma. Joey inadvertantly proposed to Rachel, and the new mother, obviously a little confused, said yes, prompting an interesting start to season nine.

Joey's feelings for Rachel had come out in season eight, and he knew that his accidental proposal to Rachel would certainly cause a lot of tension with everyone, particularly Ross. The story line surrounding the three served as a good start to the ninth season.

The season took a lot of moves along the way, with all the characters making some major choices in their lives. Monica and Chandler agree that they want to have a baby of their own, but continually fail to become pregnant, leading them to a fertility clinic, where they learn it may be impossible for them to have kids. While this show was known for its comedic moments, this storyline served as one of the more touching moments in the show, yet still was able to maintain the comedy aspect. Chandler and Monica are great together, as Courtney Cox Arquette and Matthew Perry have some very good chemistry. His laid-back approach and her uptightness go well together. Season nine also finds Chandler out of a job and serving as an intern with an ad company, finally moving on from statistical analysis and data reconfiguration.

Of course the big life changing moment for Ross and Rachel is Emma. Rachel moves in with Ross, which provides many strange moments, as they both try to live their lives with an ex and a kid in the same apartment. One of the funniest moments in the season is an episode where Rachel is leaving Emma for the first time and her and Ross get locked out of the apartment with the baby still inside. Ross's great story about the eagle and the baby, along with his great gestures to go with it, was hilarious. Of course, Ross and Rachel have a history and eventually they decide living together wasn't the best idea and Rachel heads back to Joey's.

After his proposal to Rachel, Joey finds himself in a tough situation with Ross. A viewer genuinely feels that Joey's feelings for Rachel are true, but at the same time, he knows he can't act on them. At least not at the beginning of the year. Through the season, Joey wrongly believes that Monica is cheating on Chandler while he is in Tulsa, gets Phoebe a job as an extra on Days of our Lives and misses his appearance in the big Thanksgiving Day parade. His life changing moment however, comes at the end of the season. After his breakup with paleontologist Charlie, he sees Ross kissing her and decides that is time to act on his feelings for Rachel, closing the ninth season.

Phoebe got caught in a love triangle, forcing her to choose between David, her scientist boyfriend who returned from Minsk, and Mike, the piano playing former lawyer who Joey set her up with on a blind date (accidentally of course). When Phoebe finds out that Mike never wants to get married because of his failed marriage, this causes them to break up, sending her into the arms of David. However, it is Mike who swoops in at the end to take Phoebe's heart away.

The season ends in Barbados, a great way to end the season, as the gang gathers for Ross's convention. Mike's proposal, Joey and Rachel's kiss and even Ross and Charlie, provide fuel for the final season.

Season nine featured some great guest stars. Paul Rudd is excellent as Mike, and he fits right in with the cast. Hank Azaria is also very good as the stammering, nervous David. He hits the nail right on the head. Aisha Tyler is good as the beautiful paleontologist Charlie. However, stealing the guest star show is Christina Applegate as Rachel's sister Amy. She won an Emmy for this role and it is well deserved. She was fantastic in her role in the Thanksgiving episode.

Extras include three commentaries from the executive producers, a quiz show, a look ahead to the final season, a music video and a great gag reel.

This season set, like the eight before it, is very well done and will help preserve one of the best comedies of our generation for years to come.",1112832000,34,4627,4.588377723970944
2198605,5,B0006ZM8M2,"Friends is deffinately my fave. And, for a girl who finds it hard to get into a series or anything, thats' a REALLY good thing. The only show that came close to catching my eye like this was sienfeild. I absolutely love the characters and the way they are developed throughout the ten seasons. It's funny because I didn't know there was a tenth season until after the ninth one was done, and I was like, what happened to Pheobe's wedding. I did not in any way shape or form feel like they dragged it on too much. It was refreshing to see pheobe settle down and grow up within her character. I think it needed to be done!! Well, I have all nine seasons so far, so my question is ?????????WHEN DOES THE TENTH SEASON COME OUT???????????",1112572800,2,733,4.318840579710145
2198606,4,B0006ZM8M2,"Several people have said that season 9 isn't that great, but I actually think the first half is top notch. I like that they shook up the formula (having Chandler in another city -- Ross and Rachel dealing with the baby), and Mike is a great addition.  Most of the episodes from early in the season are laugh out loud funny (the one with Phoebe's birthday is a personal favorite). The problem, I think, is that halfway through this season, they decided they were going to extend into another season.  So, even though the producers  say they didn't want it to seem like they were dragging out storylines -- that's exactly how it comes across.  The later episodes lose a lot of energy -- although the ping-pong game between Monica and Mike in the season finale is hilarious.  I do hope that the 10th season DVD will have some cast commentary and interviews.  There really isn't much more that Kevin Bright, Marta Kaufman and David Crane can say at this point. Definitely worth buying for the first two discs alone -- and the gag reel.",1111881600,11,1031,4.545945945945946
2198607,5,B0006ZM8M2,"The birth of Emma was great, wasn't it? Hopefully, Rachel will consider getting back together with Ross, now that she is the mother of his second child.

  Phoebe and Joey decide to go out on a double date. Phoebe has fixed Joey up with one of her friends. She wants Joey to fix her up with one of his, but he hooks Phoebe up with a strange guy named Mike. Phoebe is pissed at Joey, but she forgives him when she and Mike become in love with each other.

  Rachel and Ross decide to hire a nanny. All of the women they interviewed are not even close to being qualified, until they meet Sandy, a male nanny, who is more sensitive than any woman on this planet. Rachel hires him for she loves his ways with Emma, but Ross finds it unsettling, for he fires him only after a week or two.

  Thanksgiving has arrived. You would think that from season six, Rachel only had one sister, which was Jill. But for this Thanksgiving, Rachel's other sister, Amy, shows up. She quarrels with Rachel about the fact that she and Ross will not be giving Emma to Amy, if *knock on wood* Ross and Rachel had died.

  Rachel goes back to work about three weeks early, due to the fact that she maybe replaced permanently, with a guy named Gavin. He comes off as a jerk the first time round, but when he shows up at Rachel's birthday, giving her a birthday kiss, that all changes. Ross and Rachel fight about it, where Rachel moves in with Joey temporarily. Now that Rachel is back with Joey, Rachel and Ross seem to be a lot better in getting a long.

  Phoebe and Mike have invited Monica to come to Mike's piano bar. Mike plays piano as the customers get up and sing popular songs from the 60s through today. Monica does not want to sing, but she reconsiders and decides to sing the Helen Reddy classic, ""Delta Dawn"". Monica gives a good performance, but the guys in the audience seem to enjoy seeing Monica where a see-through blouse more than hear her sing. While that is going on, Joey is getting his eyebrows shaped. Later, Mike and Phoebe break up because Mike's first marriage failed and he does not want to go through another marriage. After that, Phoebe runs into David, her ex-boyfriend from the first season's New Year's Eve party. They begin dating again.

  Later, we find that Rachel has now developed loving feelings for Joey. As she goes through that, we find out that Monica and Chandler, who have been wanting to have a child since the day they said their I Do's, cannot have children through the natural process. They have three options: Surrogacy, Insemination, Adoption. Monica does not want to do a surrogacy, since she has prepared herself to carry a child. They temporarily go for the artificial insemination, but from another donor. Chandler thinks he's found the perfect donor named Zack, who works with Chandler. But Monica decides not to go with insemination, for she wants a child that is hers and Chandler's. They decide to adopt.

  Ross meets Charlie, an assistant female Paleontologist, who is dropdead gorgeous. He readies himself to ask her out, but Joey took the liberty of it. Later on, Ross is scheduled to hold a Paleontology conference in Barbados, and he has invited Charlie and the gang out to Barbados. Charlie breaks up with Joey, for he has nothing in common with Charlie. Joey finds out about Rachel's feelings and begins kissing her passionately, after seeing Ross kiss Charlie. Phoebe knows that David, who has joined the gang as well, will propose to her, but Mike, after talking to Monica over the phone, shows up in Barbados and wins Phoebe back. Phoebe, although feeling sorry for David, goes back to Mike for good.

More laughs fill this hilarious ninth season of Friends. Guest stars include: Hank Azaria, Elliott Gould, John Stamos, Aisha Tyler, Paul Rudd, Christina Applegate, Freddie Prinze Jr., Jeff Goldblum, & Jon Lovitz.

2198609,4,B0006ZM8M2,"This set is great. However, sound quality was an issue on one episode. Every episode was remastered very well into Dolby Surround 5.0 except for ""The One In Barbados"". Someone who remastered that sound must've goofed. The sound mix is messed up a little, which can be bothersome at times. That caused one star to be dropped from my rating",1110499200,8,338,4.65

2198611,4,B0006ZM8M2,"While the comments about the lack of decent extras in the ""Friends"" series are somewhat valid (especially the ones about the series' stars not participating at all), one should also realize that other shows out on DVD, such as ""M*A*S*H"" have had no extras at all or have had original music replaced (""Quantum Leap"" 2nd season, for example) due to copyright issues.  Most of us would pay a few bucks more to get a better quality product.

Studios should take a lesson from the huge success of the ""Seinfeld"" DVDs to put out a quality product with lots of extras.

""Friends"" probably should have called it quits after this year.",1110499200,5,626,4.672727272727273
2198612,3,B0006ZM8M2,"I am a huge fan of this show and have been for awhile, so I think I can honestly say I know a good season from a bad one. Story arcs, character development, general storylines and developments, etc. and just the overall funniess of the jokes are not as good here as previous seasons. Personally, I think the first 6 are the best, and each one since has been compartively weaker than the last. While this season has some great moments, the stories are just really lacking and show the obvious strain the writers were coming up with for compelling situations. They didn't really switch things up or try anything new or interesting here (like say Will & Grace has this past year) and so it just sort of feels dissapointing. The Rachel-Joey arc has always been really unconvincing to me, and for me this has been the real downfall of the show. But the acting is terrific as always and I especially love Courtney Cox and David Schwimmer and Matt LeBlanc, who show some fantastic acting skills throughout.",1110326400,7,999,4.58659217877095
2198613,5,B0006ZM8M2,"Most people buy a season on DVD because they like the show enough to want to see the episodes more than once, to pop in for a quick laugh when nothing else is on TV, or because the show makes them happy.  Some people buy a season of a much loved show just so they can have them all in one place, neatly on a shelf for future viewing when re-runs of the show aren't as readily available.  That is just what you get here.  It seems kinda silly to review this product ""because the show sucks"" as another reviewer said. While another reviewer points out that there are no interviews with the cast about the show, most people won't be bothered by that.  If you love the show and are collecting each season, you will get what you paid for.  If you don't love the show why would you review it here, because you clearly haven't bought it, so only talk about what you know for heaven sakes.",1110240000,14,881,4.189349112426036
2198614,4,B0006ZM8M2,"Friends is a great show, but the Friends DVDs are low on extras.  Each of the 9(eventually 10) seasons has a couple episodes with commentaries by Kevin Bright, Marta Kauffman and David Crane.  After about 5 seasons they get pretty redundant.  There is commentary on the Thanksgiving episode, which means someone will say ""I love having the six of them in a room together.""  There is also a corny trivia game, and thats about it.

It would be nice if the stars, or even guest stars did commentaries to mix things up.  The season sets are almost done, but they could do a couple ""best of"" discs and have some good commentaries.",1110153600,8,625,4.535714285714286
2198615,4,B0006ZM8M2,"It's been my general observation that the longer shows last, the worse they get (ER, Charmed, Will & Grace, etc) and Friends is no exception to the rule. Sooner or later the writers run out of material and they were scraping bottom by season nine. It's understandable, given the shifting scenarios, these six are no longer the single twenty-somethings they were at the start of the series and it's a process of evolution.

However, I love this show and can understand this kind of flaw as it happens to the best of shows. If you don't like FRIENDS, you don't have to buy it, and you don't have to complain about it. I love this show and so I will be buying it to update my collection.",1110153600,8,684,4.3858267716535435
2198616,2,B0006ZM8M2,"Compare the extras of the FRIENDS box set seasons with the SEINFELD ones. In FRIENDS, none (I repeat NONE) of the six main cast members gave any interviews or details specially for the DVD release. Not a single one!! The commentary tracks are about four to five each season, and that's it. Add some eight minutes of gags reel, some stupid thing with Gunther talking one minute about next season, and that's all. That's ALL you'll get!! What disrespect for their fans. Shame on you, Matt, Schwimmer, Aniston, Kudrow, LeBlanc and Courteney. There were already hints that they are six really greedy people, and this proves it, because they knew the DVD's would sell anyway and did not want to spend their ""precious"" time with it... Or did they ask too much money to do them...? Who knows?

Look at SEINFELD's DVD's. There is a kind of ""making-off"" for almost EACH EPISODE!! There are plenty of interviews with all the ensemble cast, ALL OF THEM, including Jerry. And 90 percent of the extras were made for the DVD edition, and not simply taken from TV interviews or specials from the past! It's clear that everything was made with care and thinking about the fans. It's a lesson that, unfortunately, will make no impact in Warner BRos to modify the extras in FRIENDS, because it's already the ninth season....

As for the show itself, of course FRIENDS is very good. Ninth season is not their best but, if you came this far, there's no reason to skip this one.",1110153600,15,1457,4.6434108527131785

2198618,4,B0006ZM8M2,"I think I have watched Friends/Joey since the second season.

At First I thought this was the worst season because of all the stupid plot twist. But the charectors were pretty good. Here are the episodes that I feel were the best on this season.

196(2)-The one where Emma Cries-Chandler accidentally falls asleep and accepts a job in Tulsa. Joey is mad at Joey and takes a swing at him at central perk and breaks his finger.

198(4)-The One with the Sharks. Monica sees Chandler at the hotel in Tulsa and thinks Chandler is the master of Domain at the Hotel to sharks. It is discovered it was regular porn

(Why didn't he keep the door closed thats obvious)

199(5)-Phoebe has her B-Day party with the other 5. She gives a lecture on them arriving late and her self leaves early. Joey sais to the waitors that he will eat 6 servings of food.

200(6)-The One with the male nanny. Freddie Prinze was not good but Ross was really funny. Ross has the guy get fired.

204(10)-The One with the Christmass in Tulsa-Chandler's female hits on him. He has to now quit the job because of it.

208(14)-The One with the Blind Dates-Joey and Phoebe want to get Ross and Rachel back togeather they get terrible dates. Rachel goes out with Steve(Lovitz) the pot head from Episode 15(The One with the Stoned Guy) the dates go bad.

209(15)-The One with the Mugging-Joey had hard time with a audition with Jeff Goldblum. Phoebe mugged Ross when he was a younger person. Chandler becomes a intern in advatising.

211(17)-The One with the Memorial Service-Ross and Chandler do stupid things. Ross calls Chandler a homosexual and Chandler sais Ross is dead. Ross decides to be a perv and holds a memorial service. A Hot girl is the only one there. Ross tries to get her of course he does not as she leaves angerily.

212(18)-The One with the lottery-They gets some lottery tickets.

A nice little episode that is about true friendship.

214(20)-The One with the soap opera party-Joey holds a secret Days of our Life Party. Chandler goes to some Crazy ladies play.

Ross meets Charlie and starts to like her.

217(23)-The One in Barbados Part 1 and 2. This one has Ross at a conference. They end having a balloon fight. We find out that Chandler is a great table tennis player also as he beats Mike.

This season Is pretty good. The Plot lines are very thin but the charectors had a good resurgance. Chandler had his best season since the 5th season. Joey and Ross were also good to.

2198626,4,B0006ZM8M2,"Now, having just read the review of this soon to be released ninth season and a couple of the other customer reviews, I'm a bit surprized to hear people say this season was lackluster.  Yes, the show had been on for eight years previous to this season, so of course it's going to go a bit stale.  But considering some of the plotlines and performances, the show held insanely well during this season.  Phoebe finally has a romantic love interest that lasts for more than four episodes and who doesn't immediately break for Minsk.  Paul Rudd is an amazing addition to the cast in this season, and Aisha Tyler is brilliant in her role as well.  The regular actors really have fit into their niche.  We've finally gotten away from Ross being disgustingly whiney about everything that happens.  The only character that seems to fall short is Courtney Cox Arquette's portrayal of Monica, as she becomes more and more of a type and less of an actual character.  Yes, the Tulsa storyline is rather unbelieveable, but how often do we see a girl give birth to her step-brother's triplets as in the fourth season?  As for the people who say this season was not their best, have you seen the seventh season?  There is very little redeeming in the first twelve episodes of that year.  I enjoy them because it is Friends, but come on.  If any year is going to be hailed as the worst, it is definately the seventh.  In compairison, the ninth is golden.  As for accusations against the tenth season, let's face it:  it was the final year.  At that point the writers and producers aren't necessesarily going to be coming up with the most inventive material because they have to focus on giving ""the audience what they want"" and wrapping up all the storyines that have accumulated over ten years.  This is usually why ""final seasons"" of shows are sub-par.  After all, who would want to watch Ross and Rachel become unresolved, Phoebe end up alone, etc.?  It's a sitcom, not reality.

Like Freddy Prinze Jr becoming Emma's nanny or Rachel and Ross singing ""I Like Big Butts"" to her so that shell smile. This season also progresses on Joey's feelings for Rachel and how he knows that he has to have her, but he can't. And we can all relate to that.
