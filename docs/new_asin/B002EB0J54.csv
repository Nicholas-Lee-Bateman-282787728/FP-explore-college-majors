8367391,4,B002EB0J54,"Used to love listening to Kansas City's darlings, The Rainmakers, back in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  Great midwestern guitar/bass/drums rock and roll.  It was nice to see some older footage of the guys in action.  I'm guessing only their most ardent fans will buy this collection, which is kind of a shame since the band is so good, but who ever said the music industry is fair?",1382659200,,384,4.536231884057971
8367392,5,B002EB0J54,"I will always cherish this DVD. (I can actually identify my big head in the audience at Mississippi Nights concert). A must for any big Rainmaker fan, always fun to see the change in styles of hair & clothing, yet the music remains the same through these years. They graced St. Louis with a concert a month or so back, had the opportunity to turn others onto them.",1335225600,,364,4.367647058823529
8367393,5,B002EB0J54,"i went to college with Herr Walkenhorst back in the 70's. i found him later in Branson playing at the Holiday Inn, then years later in KC. he's like Mark Twain with a guitar and drums. this a great retrospect for the fan. these guys came from our own backyard!",1333065600,3,260,4.22
8367394,4,B002EB0J54,"This DVD is an overview of The Rainmakers from Kansas City, a popular local band of the 1980s-90s, was also popular throughout the midwest U.S. and strangely, was huge in Norway.

The collection runs from their earliest incarnation as ""Steve, Bob & Rich"" in 1983, of whom I saw many times during my college years at K-State, until the end of their time together around 1998.

The track list is as follows:

1. Big Fat Blonde, 1983
2. Kissin' Time, 1984
3. Uncontrollable Urge, 1984 (yes, the Devo song from Devo's first LP)
4. Let My People Go-Go, 1986
5. Downstream, 1986
6. Long Gone Long, 1986
7. Let My People Go-Go (Top Of The Pops), 1987
8. Snakedance, 1987
9. Wages Of Sin, 1988
10. Small Circles, 1988
11. Nobody Knows, 1988
12. Small Circles (accoustic), 1987
13. Wild Oats, 1988
14. Spend It On Love, 1989
15. Hoo Dee Hoo, 1989
16. Horn O Plenty, 1989
17. Drinkin' On The Job, 1990
18. Width Of A Line, 1994
19. Another Guitar, 1995
20. Good Sons And Daughters, 1998
21. Hunger Moon, 1998
22. To The Hum, 1998
23. Johnny Reb, 1998

Most of the songs are actual live performances of varying sound quality (sometimes great, sometimes not good) and a handful of actual produced 1980s rock videos shown on MTV, etc. of good quality.  Much of this obviously came from VHS tapes, so ""grainy"" at times.  Between tracks are various snippets of conversations and interviews, record store appearances, award ceremonies, etc.  This really does give one a great overview of what this band was capable of and how much fun they were on CD and in concert.  These guys really were humble mid-westerners who could really rock out but always had some deep statements and irony in their lyrics.  A ""thinking man's band"".  Some of the live appearances are from Norway, where they were quite popular.

As a bonus, along the way we get also a snapshot of what it was like to be a vinyl LP-era band of the 1980s, the MTV video era, then into the digital music age.  The record store appearances at what appears to be Sound Warehouse (probably somewhere on the Kansas side of KC) is a great period-piece, of which we may never see the likes of again.  Those types of record stores are virtually extinct.

If you liked The Rainmakers, you will REALLY like this video DVD and it will be an essential purchase.  I feel like it was very well done for what they had to work with and the additional bonus of feeling the culture of the 1980s is worth it.  Not my favorite decade for music, but The Rainmakers were one of the best bands of the period in the mid-west.  This is Rock & Roll, NOT New Wave.

My only complaint is a lack of any liner notes or list of musicians, or anything except a track list.  Several photos of the band are in the fold-over ""booklet"".  These shortcomings are mostly made up during the course of the video content.

I did have to chuckle, as I'm sure the band did during a news broadcast when longtime KC news anchor Phil Witt introduced Bob as ""Steve Walkenhorst"".

Well thought out, and well-directed/produced, but just grainy enough to not be able to give more than 4 stars for the DVD era.  But what average person had digital video cameras in the 1980s?",1288656000,11,3167,4.469565217391304
