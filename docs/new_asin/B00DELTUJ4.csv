8592607,3,B00DELTUJ4,"This dvd set was rather disappointing.  The first disc was much better quality than the second one, which had a lot of wavery sound when the music was playing and more flaws in the picture, such as black or white lines.  I would have preferred for this to have had more of his own shows and uncut ones than things that he was barely on, such as the Easter Seal show and You Bet Your Life, and for them to either have restored the sound and picture of his shows that really needed that or to have selected alternative shows that were in better condition.  I was hoping for more and better than this because you can't fault Liberace's superb performances, and I wanted to see more of them and of better sound and picture quality.  I really wish that somebody would gather all of his tv shows, restore them, and put them all out together in a box set.  The music stands the test of time, even if some of the staging/direction seems a bit odd.",1460764800,,939,4.2824858757062145

8592609,5,B00DELTUJ4,Liberace at his charming best! Black & white TV shows before Vegas flash. You can see his genius playing the piano. Such beautiful music with so much feeling.,1389225600,2,158,4.678571428571429
