4498694,3,B004YCKIZW,"The yards was the best movie in the pack. Was disappointed with the ending of the Albino Alligator, and the Grifters. However, not too bad for the price.",1395878400,,153,4.5
4498695,2,B004YCKIZW,Well...at least one of the movies on this disc is a crappy transfer...and its the one i ordered the DVD for! Grifters frame rate is all screwy....almost like its going in slightly slow motion. Very dissapointed and would not recommend this....,1377820800,6,243,4.951219512195122
4498696,5,B004YCKIZW,"I bought this collection primarily for ""The Grifters,"" a stylish and clever crime story from 1990, produced by Martin Scorsese and directed by Stephen Frears, that was, arguably, one of the five best movies of that year--certainly equal, if not superior, to ""The Godfather Part III,"" which was nominated for best picture of the year over it. The film starred John Cusack (in one of his most interesting performances), Anjelica Huston (in an Oscar nominated performance that I think is her best), and Annette Bening (a best supporting actress nominee, who has never been this sexy and uninhibited again). The story involves multiple confidence games and layers of betrayal, both personal and professional, and a twisted love triangle between the three principals, playing mother, estranged son, and would-be girlfriend. There's also a scary turn by Pat Hingle as a bookmaker with a cruel streak a mile wide. The other two films in the collection are less accomplished but nevertheless worth watching. ""The Yards"" is a traditional crime melodrama that gives great location detail of Queens and a strong performance by a young Mark Wahlberg, who shows why he was destined to become a major movie star. He plays the proverbial tough kid from the wrong side of the tracks who gets caught between corrupt businessmen and politicians and must fight to clear his name when he's made a patsy for a murder. He's supported by a cast that includes veterans Faye Dunaway, Ellen Burstyn and James Caan and some (then) fresh-faced newcomers Joaquin Phoenix and Charlize Theron. ""Albino Alligator"" is an interesting character study, directed by Kevin Spacey and starring Gary Sinise, Matt Dillon, Joe Mantegna, Faye Dunaway, and Viggo Mortensen, set within a seedy tavern after a robbery goes terribly wrong, leading to a tense hostage situation. While the film sometimes seems more a stage play than movie, there's enough tension and violent action to keep you interested, and William Fichtner gives an edgy performance that steals the movie out from under his better-known cast mates.",1364342400,3,2070,5.14540059347181
