8631902,1,B00HEM1LVE,"Bought this as a Christmas gift to my husband because we are visiting Switzerland this summer.  We finally got to viewing them and they are terrible.  Poor quality video (not clear definitely not HD), old footage (looks like 1980's), and not anything about trains and adventures of trips you can take.  It is about the rails and show footage of cargo trains going through various stations and when they were built.  Open the second one and it was not better.  Never even tried the third one.  Wanted to return them and return date expired Jan. 31st.  Definitely not DVDs that will excite you about a trip to Switzerland and even if you are a railway buff the quality and dated look of the videos do not make interesting watching.",1455148800,,729,4.604651162790698
