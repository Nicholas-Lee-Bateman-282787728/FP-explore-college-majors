7970374,2,B00006JMV2,"By the cover art you think this is a drama, but other than saying it is family friendly, I am not sure what it is.  Poor directing and poor editing makes that film meander all over the place.  A kid's film, possibly.  It is about a boy and his friends.  Is it suppose to be magical?  There is a very old man who does some strange magical things.  Also the airplane appears to communicate with the boy.  On the other hand on a more serious note, the boy appears to misbehave a lot because his mother is going to get married again and the new father figure doesn't measure up to the image the mother has built for him about his father being a hero, instead of the deadbeat dad he was.  Enter the pilot, Dean Cain, who is a romantic interest for the Mom, but who he himself is a deadbeat dad.  I don't know - kid's adventure, comedy, drama -- it was too conflicting for me.  No real direction for the film.",1412467200,2,903,4.137931034482759
7970375,5,B00006JMV2,"This movie is not your regular action or sensual movie. It is magical and funny, a coming of age adventure movie; appropriate for all in the family.",1376265600,,148,4.518518518518518
7970376,3,B00006JMV2,"I bought this movie because I really love Dean Cain, he is in many different styles of movies, end of the world, Hallmark family movies, & many romantic comedies and dramas. However, this is just about finding faith & courage, so if you're looking for a romantic kind of movie this is not it, but it's a decent movie if your a Dean Cain super fan, it's worth getting, if you're not, well its up to you.",1373414400,2,402,4.233766233766234
7970377,4,B00006JMV2,"I found it a bit slow going and mild.  Not much action at all, but if you are a fan of Dean Cain, you will like it.  It is not predictable nor does it end the way you think it should.",1361232000,,183,3.4390243902439024

7970379,5,B00006JMV2,"It was funny, romantic and entertaining. I love it and will watch it again! Great for the entire family, has no profanity or bad language which was a plus! Loved Dean Cain!!!",1187740800,,174,4.46875
7970380,2,B00006JMV2,"This must have been a real turkey at the box office. True, Dean is a hunk, and Talia Soto, who played the victimized girlfriend of the Cuban drug lord in LICENSE TO KILL, is good, though she almost always sounds on the verge of tears. Her son, played by Kristian de la Osa, is fine. The casting was wonderful in his case, because he could very easily have been Talia's kid.
What's wrong with the film is that it doesn't know what it's about...or even what kind of movie it is. On one level, it's a straight-ahead drama of an American pilot forced to land in a storm and how he interacts with the locals, including becoming a father-figure to a boy whose mother is attracted to the pilot, despite her being engaged to a planter on whose property the plane lands. Fine. Good enough for one movie.
But then we get this bearded old man who may or may not be just a local eccentric: he makes hand gestures and the control sticks of the plane move, birds take off, etc. At one point he seemingly turns into a hen! Then we get parts of the plane, after being smashed up, moving of their own volition in response to things the boy says, almost in CHRISTINE fashion. And we get another boy, a sort of rival with the main kid for the attention of a local girl (an annoying addition), who climbs down into an extinct volcano crater, uncovers what he thinks is buried treasure hidden there by the bearded old man, only to unearth a skull that jumps up at him in an obvious CGI effect. All of this adds up to a supernatural tale. Fine. Almost good enough for a different movie.
Put together, though, there are simply too many disparate elements for the thing to work. So I'm pretty sure it was a BOMB and went to video pretty quick. I found my copy at Wal-Mart for $5.50. It was worth it.",1085616000,4,1775,4.285714285714286
7970381,4,B00006JMV2,"This is a great family film. A great example of independent film making and definately worth seeing. However, this is the American release of 'Flight' (same movie different title). Save some money and order 'Flight'",1043971200,5,215,5.171428571428572
7970382,1,B00006JMV2,"Facing Fear is an independant, low-budget production that is not worth seeing at all. In fact, it could easily be classified (in my opinion) as a waste of time, a film that one might regret taking the time to watch.
There is not much to it in the area of plot construction and character development. The storyline, what there is of it, concerns a pilot who crashes on an island when a massive storm strikes. Throughout the course of the movie, he is trying to find a way to return home. He meets a small family living on the island, a young boy, his mother, and her fiancee. The boy becomes fascinated with the fallen plane, a discovers that the plane is magical. Together the boy and the pilot endeavor to rebuild the plane. But then the pilot falls in love with the boy's mother, and there is some OK chemistry involved in their growing relationship. But the boy's mother knows the right thing to do, and endeavors to remain faithful to her fiancee. That whole situation is just a sub-plot, too much like a stupid soap opera. Meanwhile, the boy has mixed feelings concerning his family situation, and takes comfort in trying to learn all he can about the mysterious plane. At one point, when onew of the boy's friends releases an ancient curse on accident, the heavens open and a severe storm erupts. The boy rescues the plane from plummeting into a gorge during the storm. The boy and the stranded pilot become best friends, and together they continue reparing the plane.
Another crisis strikes when the pilot attempts to leave the island in his newly rebuilt plane. It strikes a line of tall trees, and the pilot ver narrowly survives. The endeavor to get away from the island community continues . . .
This film is one of the most cheesiest films I've ever seen, a film about a magical plane, an old mystic man who is transformed into a chicken because of a curse, and a living skull. It is cheesy and not intelligent in any way that really counts. The character development is almost non-existent, and, as you can probably tell from this review, the plot is overly cheesy and weak. Not worth even the rental price. Rated PG. 1 star out of five",1042243200,3,2149,4.526992287917738
