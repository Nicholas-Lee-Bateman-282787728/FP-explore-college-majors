8352801,2,B0026JIOSS,"While I may be unlike most people, when I read the words 'musical drama' I was thinking it was an actual movie like Seven Brides for Seven Brothers and the like.  This is a well done for what it is, but it is basically a mega-church play that has been professionally filmed.  The talent is good, but like I said, I was expecting an actual movie.",1382659200,3,345,4.212121212121212

The one that I got is actually the Jerusalem 2004 version which is my preferred one with a cast of over 70 singers and dancers. A great introduction to the story of Abraham, Israel and the history of the State of Israel.",1367539200,2,356,4.409090909090909
