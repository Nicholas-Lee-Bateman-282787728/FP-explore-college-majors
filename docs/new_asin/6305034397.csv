949700,5,6305034397,"One of the movies that shaped a generation.  A dramatic triumph in the form of Dustin Hoffman's debut performance as the feckless Benjamin.  Benjamin is the graduate of the title.  Fresh out of college, he has a  promising life ahead of him.  He just doesn't know what that life is.  A  boy without direction, he falls under the influence of Mrs. Robinson, who  just happens to be his sweetheart, Elaine's, mother.  When she seduces him,  he must choose the path for him, be it Elaine, or Mrs. Robinson.  And by  choosing, this boy graduates into manhood.  A powerful film, whose final  shot speaks to today's generation of young graduates, just as it did to the  generation 30 years ago.",914198400,,688,4.663865546218488
949701,5,6305034397,"This is my favorite movie of all time.  It is absolutely wonderful, both hilarious and touching.  Hoffman's performance is first rate.  He plays Ben, a repressed virginal character who is worried about his future.  He  has no idea who he is, what he wants, what he is going to do.  Anne  Bancroft plays Mrs. Robinson, a friend of Ben's parents who is cooly  determined to seduce Ben.
Subtle symbolism pervades the movie.  Ben is  drowning, and the director often shoots him in water, or looking through  water.  For example, Ben's parents buy him a scuba suit for his birthday.  They force him into the swimming pool, and push him back in when he tries  to climb out.  Mrs. Robinson wears animal skins and leopard prints,  suggesting blood thirst.  Mr. Robinson has one word for Ben, one word for  what his future is all about:  ""Plastics.""
Desperate to feel  something, Ben falls passionately for Ali MacGraw's character, the daughter  of the Robinsons.  She is engaged to be married to someone else.  Ben is  determined to woo her.
The Simon and Garfunkle soundtrack is flawless,  many of the songs written specifically for this movie.  Brilliant writing,  brilliant direction.  The finest American movie ever made.  Hilarious.  A  must see.",914112000,,1243,4.888349514563107

949790,3,6305034397,"This movie is considered a cinematic classic but honestly I wasn't sure of the main message put forward by the director and cast. Dustin Hoffman's role is that of a misguided young adult looking to find his place in the world and what he should be doing. He procrastinates and falls into an affair with the wife of a family friend - an event that pits him into a kind of personal and existential hell of emotional instability and neediness as he travels out to start a new life with a young woman he thinks he loves. Even going so far as to sabotage the young woman's marriage to a man approved of by her parents and their social circle. Note sure what to take away from the film, as to who is in the right or wrong here and the narrative is overly convoluted with too many competing goals or aspirations by the characters, especially Hoffman's character in the film.",1518307200,,867,4.391304347826087

949843,5,6305034397,"People either have strong feelings about ""The Graduate""  -- they love it or they hate it -- or they just don't get it.  For me, it's one of my top ten movies of all time.  This movie, which may seem like a dark comedy at times, may have foretold the coming hippie revolution, that first generation of baby boomers who became so disaffected, so disgusted with their parents' affluent lifestyles and values that they basically dropped out of society for a time.  Young Dustin Hoffman, in one of his very first cinematic roles, perfectly portrays the alienated Benjamin Braddock, newly graduated from college and displayed like a trophy by his revolting parents for their equally revolting friends.  He's done everything right, but he can't muster any enthusiasm for either his accomplishments or his future.  In director Mike Nichols brilliant hands, Benjamin's (Hoffman's) confusion and revulsion, juxtaposed against his parents' friends phony admiration, is an epic statement about the crass values of the upper classes.  Drifting badly, not knowing what path to take but certain he doesn't want to follow in his father's footsteps, Benjamin falls into a sordid, loveless affair with the now-infamous Mrs. Robinson (a slinkily elegant Anne Bancroft).  Events ensue from this affair that are now so familiar to most Americans that they are part of the anthology of the times.  ""The Graduate"" is so much more than just a movie -- it is an iconic masterpiece.  The score by ""Simon and Garfunkel"" is the coda that helps make it great.",1513728000,,1530,5.011857707509882

949849,5,6305034397,"What can you say about this movie? It's funny because of Dustin Hoffman. The music is wonderful because of Simon & Garfunkel. The cinematography is great. Some actors appear here ahead of their time before becoming part of series from the 70s and beyond-William Daniels[Boy Meets World] and Elizabeth Wilson[Doc] as Hoffman's parents; Buck Henry as the suspicious hotel desk clerk[The co-creator of Get Smart with Mel Brooks and guest hosted Saturday Night Live between 1975-1980]; Norman Fell as Mr. McLeery, the landlord of the college dorm[Three's Company, The Ropers]; Richard Dreyfus as one of the dorm boys in a cameo[American Graffiti, Close Encounters Of The Third Kind, Jaws, The Goodbye Girl]; Marion Lorne and Alice Ghostly as sisters[both of Bewitched, this was Lorne's final film appearance]. Katherine Ross shines as Elaine Robinson. Her parents are played by Murray Hamilton[Jaws and Jaws II] and Anne Bancroft[wife of Mel Brooks], who seduces Hoffman's character Benjamin Braddock earlier in the film and is protective of Elaine. Then Benjamin realizes it's Elaine he wants and is determined to get her no matter what it takes.
This film was shot probably around the same time Dustin Hoffman appeared on that Volkswagon ad so you could tell by his resemblance then yet this film was his breakthrough role and his character's nervous tick in the film was based on how Hoffman's brother acted when letting out a breath trying to remain calm.

949876,2,6305034397,"Like many other aspects of the 1960s, this one-time classic has not aged well.  The fault lies squarely on the shoulders of the director who chose to cast Dustin Hoffman in the titular role.  Dustin Hoffman is a terrific actor, but he doesn't fit the role.  As a result, the edginess of the book and the aspects that would make it a classic fizzle out.

In the book, Ben Braddock has the world at his beck and call.  He's successful, blond, athletic, and smart. He can have anything and anybody he wants, but he's not happy.  That's the deeper psychological question that tugs at the reader and quickly is jettisoned in the movie.  Why is this young man with the seemingly charmed life so unhappy?  That's what makes the affair with Mrs. Robinson so poignant.  Ben Braddock could have anyone.  Why does he waste his time on Mrs. Robinson?

In the movie, one can see why Dustin Hoffman would have an affair with Mrs. Robinson.  That's as good as he could get.  The viewer sees Mr. Hoffman's awkwardness and mediocre looks and comforts himself with Mr. Hoffman's deficiencies.  Ben Braddock's angst ""makes sense"" because Mr. Hoffman is an awkward, plain character who struggles to live up to his parents' expectations.  Dustin Hoffman, terrific actor that he is, soothes the viewer's cognitive dissonance with his own ticks and gambits.

But the story poses a different challenge.  In the story, Ben Braddock can easily live up to his parents' expectations.  That would be a snap.  But he's unhappy with the role society has assigned to him.  It's a case study in the dissatisfaction of the baby-boomers who came of age during the 1960s.  They had everything, but many of them weren't satisfied.  Why?  What did they want?

Robert Redford would have been the natural choice to play this part.  He auditioned, and in one of the greatest Hollywood directorial mistakes, Dustin Hoffman was cast over him.

This is one movie that needs a remake!",1499904000,2,1939,4.765060240963855

949960,5,6305034397,"The Graduate A film graduated above the rest

Review stated by: Grant Elmore , A.K.A.  Simply Overcomplicated Reviews

Have you ever felt lost in this crazy world? Have you ever been a teenager? I bet you have.
This movie tells the story of a teenage boy finding his way in this world. The pain and heartbreak of losing a girl you love, the confusion of being fresh out of college, and the parental pressure of not finishing graduate school is all told in a whole new way. After viewing The Graduate, I felt it necessary to review it.

 Set in a urban neighborhood of the rich and wealthy, this movie  follows Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) a fresh fish to the sea known as the world. We find Ben petrified of his future. As of his 21st birthday Ben was asked to take a friend of the family (Anne Bancroft) home. He felt obliged to do so. He very quickly became suspicious of her seductive behavior, eventually falling for it. This lead to a slew of events.

Starring in this film is Dustin Hoffman a talented actor who truly portrayed a vulnerable teen. He would later go on to play in movies such as Rain Man, Hook, and Tootsie. Playing the iconic role of  Mrs. Robinson is none other than Anne Bancroft, who became a household name through this film. She does a marvelous job playing the seductive older woman. She has also played in iconic movies such as The Elephant Man. Some of the greatest chemistry in the movie comes from the relationship between Ben and Elaine. Elaine, played by Katharine Ross, is a supporting character who definitely makes the best of her screen time. She went above and beyond to make this character a true person, from crying to screaming, she showed the true human that was Elaine Robinson. If I had to chose a person who I felt under performed it had to have been  Mr. Braddock, played by William Daniels, felt rather flat. His character seem to be a sort of plot device, but less so than Mrs. Braddock (Elizabeth Wilson) who made up for that by interacting and having meaningful conversation with our protagonist. Mr. Braddock only had certain moments or scenes in which he somewhat shined, such as a moment where he has a conversation with his son in the beginning of the film.

 I quite loved the shadowing in this film. I felt this films use is the best I have ever seen. Many scenes would show their emotion without need of showing their faces, for instance: the first affair sequence they turn off the lights almost as to hide in the dark, or following after his seductive encounter he goes down stairs and talks to her husband in shadow. They truly lived by the words Hello Darkness, my old friend.

 I find this film truly teaches you not to screw with your girlfriends mom in either the metaphorical or literal sense. On a more serious note I feel it teaches you the harsh realities of life and the not so free world outside of school.

This movie is suited for teenagers and upward but definitely (not) for children. I would recommend this movie to anyone in search of a good film. This movie is rated PG but is more PG-13 in my opinion. Overall this movie is great and high on my personal favorites list!

949967,5,6305034397,"The Graduate (1967) is frequently listed as one of the greatest films of all time. Why? Is it the whole Mrs. Robinson thing (Simon & Garfunkel song, as well as the fantasy element)? Or is it because of the screenplay and direction? On average, this film has a simple plot, good acting, and great direction. I wouldn't exactly say that Dustin Hoffman (who's a 30 year old actor playing a 20 year old college student) is totally believable in his role, but he does a fine job. Anne Bancroft (who plays Mrs. Robinson) is only 5 years older than Hoffman, and her character is probably 20-25 years older than Benjamin. Whatever,  I guess that's what makeup is for. This film was a huge box office success, while generally critically successful. A later film that probably drew some inspiration from this film is Love Story from 1970, with its simple plot, humor, and drama. Would I list The Graduate among the greatest films of all time? That's really pushing it, though I give it praise. This film is anything but boring, and moves along well. It has humor, charm, and drama, while maintaining decency during the nude scenes.

Other than the fact of seeing the scene that has been mimicked in most modern comedy rip-off versions(see Wayne's World II for example), I found the film shallow and extremely boring. Dustin Hoffman's monotone voice and ""bumbling"" acting is pretty much off putting. I did enjoy Katherine Ross's acting (the daughter he finally falls for) and Anne Bancroft's elegance as the ""older woman"" is a thin veil to the what I think is a totally crazy woman lurking beneath the facade of the seducer and ultimate wannabe control freak of the situation as it falls apart. She had such a bigger story to tell that I felt the film's potential was wasted on Hoffman's character, who comes across as such a loser (and also a potentially unstable future husband) - I wouldn't want him to marry my daughter either, and I haven't even slept with him!

This is NOT a film I'll watch again. I really don't get all the hype about it and assume that it was a scandalous film in it's day due to the subject matter - but as I am not that interested to even look up the history, I guess I'll never know what all the excitement was about.

950830,5,6305034397,"Dustin Hoffman became a star playing Benjamin Braddock, a 21 year old young man who has just finished college and is back at his parents house in California. Unsure of his future and knowing that he does not want to be like his parents, he spends the film avoiding one question: what are you going to do with your life? An interesting diversion appears in the sexy form of Mrs. Robinson, the iconic role played by Anne Bancroft who happens to be his parents' friend. ""Mrs. Robinson - you are trying to seduce me .... Aren't you?""

Ben ends up in a purely sexual affair with Mrs. Robinson and spends his days drifting in his pool, seemingly disconnected from his own life as his parents continue to question and pressure him into a future he is unsure about. After a while, his affair with Mrs. Robinson grows stale and his parents keep pushing him to take out her daughter, Elaine (Katharine Ross, gorgeous as always). Begrudgingly (and against the wishes of Mrs. Robinson) he does. He takes her to a strip club to freak her out but instead realizes that he cares for her, and that she seems to be the only one who understands him and is his true peer. Especially since he can't seem to relate to kids his own age either (the scene at the drive-in where the loud music bothers him and he puts up the convertible top and closes the windows).

Benjamin now has a dilemma. He's fallen for Elaine. The second half of the film is him driving between Berkeley and Los Angeles, pursuing Elaine as a stalker would because she has become a trophy he must win, the holy grail he must attain. Does he even really love her? Who knows.

In the final scene, it ends as it began - except now there are two unsure faces staring into the unpredictable future. Uncertainty looms as the bus pulls away and they separate from their families (and each other, now that the chase has ended).

This film is a study of the dualities - moral and immoral, good and bad, desire and disgust, want and abandon - even extending to the characters (Mrs. Robinson, experienced and Elaine, innocent) and the generations (Elaine and Benjamin and their parents). What sticks out most about this film is that the parents' generation was the last of the truly innocent generation. In the late 60's a completely new genre of films were created where artistic film makers were expressing their own angst and frustrations with where the world was headed.

Benjamin's face, Mrs. Robinson's action, his parents' nagging all show the dissatisfaction with the status quo and middle-class values at the time. The mood among the youth of the 60's was anarchic, especially during the escalation of the Vietnam War. This way, Benjamin represents the new generation as a whole. He's not the only one who is a little worried about his future and sure that he is not wanting to live in the past. ""Mrs. Robinson, this is the sickest, most perverted thing that ever happened to me.""

Of course the amazing soundtrack by Simon and Garfunkel is perfect as is the use of cinematography with the effects, angles, lighting and so forth. This is a classic and iconic film for so many reasons, this is why you just have to watch it.",1440201600,4,3170,4.582010582010582

I have remained in love with ""Mrs Robinson"" over all these years.  My dream lover for all time.  The lady I thought about while in the fields on my John Deere tractor.  Bancroft should have won the best actress academy award for her role as ""Mrs Robinson.""  A movie about ""fat & happy"" adults in LA and the bored and uninspired graduate.  Down on the farm in 1967 we actually had meaningful work to perform each and every day.  No swimming pools, sports cars or indulgent parents.  ""Ben"" (the 30 yr old Hoffman) gets busy with ""Mrs Robinson"" (the 36 yr old Bancroft) at the Taft Hotel on regular occasions.  Lucky Ben.  Everyone is bored, why not have some sex, smoke a few cigarettes.  Yawn.  I recently learned that the iconic leg shot of Mrs Robinson is not Bancroft's leg, it belongs to a 27 yr old Linda Gray of Dallas fame.  The movie depicts a bunch of rich and uninspired LA types who are bored with their ""plastic"" world.  Hoffman plays the role of a dullard quite well.  If you want a little more grit (NYC filth) see Hoffman as ""Ratso"" in Midnight Cowboy.

Talk about hype making the movie, this was all hype.

My conclusion is that I am normal.  It was the hype that put clothes on the Emperor, and Hollywood fell for it.

As for those who like to denigrate people like me who give this film the rating that I think it deserves, your intolerance and childishness tells me all I need to know.

Possibly the worst main feature film I have ever seen.",1423353600,3,772,4.387323943661972

951272,4,6305034397,"If you watch Michael J. Fox movies from the 80s, you'll notice that he doesn't like to walk anywhere.  He always wants to RUN.  Now, why is he always bouncing around like Mickey Rooney from a much earlier era?  You've got me, other than the fact that Americans think that young men running is funny.  Personally, I think that it is somewhat stupid -- and outdated -- but whatever.

And perhaps Mr. Fox learned this Schtick by watching Dustin Hoffman in ""The Graduate.""  Mr. Hoffman runs everywhere:  to his girlfriend's house -- the older one, not the house, but the girlfriend -- to his girlfriend's college -- the younger one, not the college, but the girlfriend -- the zoo, etc. etc.  Perhaps these two gentleman should have heeded the old joke, too nasty to write in its entirety, but the one that starts out, ""Hey, see all of those cows down there?  Let's run down there and. . . .""  Well, you know the rest.  Evidently, after watching this movie, Mr. Hoffman heard this joke, since he seemed to follow the advice of both the older and younger bulls.

But other than all of the running, I really liked this film a lot, and I had many laughs.  The dialog, while not exactly realistic, is very funny; notice the back and forth, in particular, between Mr. Hoffman and Ann Bancroft.  I've seen tennis matches between Nadal and Federer that didn't strain my neck this much, and that is saying something.  And a scene in the third act, interaction between the ""Graduate"" and Mr. Robinson, is sublime.  But in reality, the later relationship between Mr. Hoffman and Katherine Ross is merely ""window dressing.""  This relationship is necessary only to create some additional tension in the film, and while I laughed at the ending -- not that I'm going to reveal a spoiler -- I'm not convinced that this would ever happen in real life.

I was too young to see this film when it first released, but I've caught bits and pieces over the years, and finally watched it in its entirety last night.  It's too bad about my age, because if I were older -- not that I necessarily want to be -- unlike that older bull, I would have run, not walked, to the theater to see this beauty when it first released.",1422230400,2,2191,4.5152284263959395

951467,4,6305034397,"Dustin Hoffman starred in this iconic baby-boomers anthem movie about a young man entering the 'real world' from college.
The film is as famous for its related references than for the quality of the film as a whole.  We all remember 'plastics' as the sage wisdom imparted to him for a career(not bad advice...)  We all remember the iconic scene where Mrs. Robinson, the mother of his girlfriend, is sweettalking him when he asks if 'you're trying to seduce me'.  We all remember the Simon&Garfunkel songs, especially 'Here's to you Mrs. Robinson' and the one covering the final scene.  I won't spoil it as to what that scene was.
The plot has Hoffman fighting to retain his girl while her family is about to marry her off with a much more impressive and conventional guy.  Hoffman has to fend off the advances of Mrs. Robinson and then break up the wedding to recover 'his girl', if he can...
The film and the musical score are still the way you remember them.  The film will bring back memories for you and your certain someone...
Last footnote: if you were wondering about what might have been(there was never a sequel), the 'Heartbreak Kid', also on Amazon, presents a logical conclusion with a similar character(in that case: Charles Grodin.)",1418083200,,1246,4.74537037037037

951469,4,6305034397,"Hoffman and Bancroft are terrific but people who claim social imortance for the movie don't understand it was quite behind the curve of the 60's and could perfectly match up with something like Goodbye Columbus written ten years earlier, really a 50's Zeitgeist.  None of Nichol's movies of the period are interesting (or ever really), they have a deasly stagey stagnant feel and are directed to an old-fashioned Broadway crowd. He completely cannot convey the chaos of the sources or subject matter in films such as Catch-22 (much better as Mash) or Carnal Knowledge (really a Jules Feiffer take on hippies, also ten years wrong in feel).  So in the Graduate, Hoffman isn't caught merely in the suffocaring plastoc net of the culture, but in Nichols direction, and the film is most unreal when he bursts out liberated, the whole vehicle still about suffocation.  If anyone really thinks this is about 1967 hippie culture, take a look at who appears in the college scenes which are straight out of a Pat Boone fantasy.  Hoffman too, of course, was almost as old as Bancroft.  The movie is sadder and more lie Carnal Knowledge where an ageing hippie in Garfunkel looks inappropriate, but this isn't either a comment on youth culture since he's far too old.",1417824000,,1255,4.845794392523365

If anything The Graduate is a look back at fantastic fashion and wonderful music by Simon and Garfunkel. This movie is short and sweet but be prepared to have unanswered questions in the end. By the way there is a bit more to this plot but if I give it away I don't think you'll enjoy it as much.

951763,2,6305034397,"The Graduate is a perfect depiction of how a pathetic, naive kid with no direction can grow some balls after he gets laid.  Dustin Hoffman effortlessly makes the transition, though interestingly enough, after many years of reflection, the late critic Roger Ebert went from adoring the film as the funniest American comedy of the year to hating on Hoffmans character, referring to him as an insufferable creep and feeling more sympathy instead for Mrs. Robinson.

This is an interesting viewpoint, since its not one you walk away with immediately upon viewing the film.  But thinking back on it, I did find Benjamin (Hoffman) to be a bit of a dick in that he first did the right thing by rejecting the married Mrs. Robinsons advances, but then he went back on his word and invited her to a hotel for their fling, knowing full well that what they were doing was wrong.  And then he pursues her daughter on top of it - did he ever consider that the woman he was sleeping with would soon become his mother-in-law?  I'd hate to be a guest at those family dinners.

He doesnt seem to be that attracted to her at first, probably because she is so much older than him and because shes been friends with his parents for years.  I don't think I could feel anything for friends of my parents other than platonic love, if Id ever go so far as to say I loved any of them.  But I digress.  You get zero chemistry from these two.  Their trysts are awkward and clumsy, and theres no passion at all.  I suppose thats the point, to drive home the fact that this affair means nothing in the grand scheme of things, despite being able to tear everything apart.

Casting did a great job, though, because Katharine Ross looks like she really could be Anne Bancrofts daughter.  Maybe its just the make-up, but they even look like they have the same facial structure.

One thing I found distracting was the use of the music in the film.  Now, I consider any opportunity to hear Simon & Garfunkels The Sounds of Silence to be a fortunate one, but it was overused in this film, as was Parsley, Sage, Rosemary, and Thyme.  It felt odd to hear the songs play in their entirety at first, and to be used in their entirety again later on in the film, sometimes in near rapid succession.  Maybe they should have just used clips, or expanded their S&G palette a little.

I was thankful that Waynes World 2 had parodied the end wedding scene since, being much younger than the film and having not yet seen it, I always tied the film (as Im sure many do) to the affair, yet there is that whole other love story in the second half, which tends to go unnoticed, save for the films ambiguous ending.

Which, speaking of the ending, its always been understood that you're supposed to be left with a feeling of uncertainty about these characters, yet seeing Benjamins smile fade and then, in turn, Elaines face drops as well, I got the sense that they realized they were too late, and that Elaine really was married off to someone else.  So while it was fun to run away, reality caught up to them faster than they could reach the buss destination, wherever that may be.",1407456000,2,3129,4.456140350877193

Saw it recently after it became available as part of my Prime package. Couldn't wait to see it again.

Seeing with different eyes, a little older albeit, the movie flat lined for me as a social commentary. Wasn't nearly as good as I had previously told myself. I know this is a sacrilege thing to say to this sacred cow of a movie, but I just didn't find it that watchable. Honestly, take away Anne Bancroft and her wonderful performance and the movie drifts towards bad.

This time around I just could buy Hoffman's character. He was so wishy washy that I found it hard to believe he would be a running star or have the moxie to run a college newspaper, or the goods to nail Anne Bancroft. I didn't find his character very symaphetic this time around. Poor rich boy?

But, everyone tells you this is a classic, and you want to appear to be smart, so tell everyone how great and deep a movie it is and what it says about society. You'll believe it if you say it enough",1405900800,3,1063,4.226600985221675

951817,2,6305034397,"This is an incredible period piece of a movie that captures much of the naivete the baby boomer generation.  I am of that generation and didn't get around to watching this until June 2014.  Dustin Hoffman does a remarkable job of portraying a spoiled brat of the sixties.  The only time in this movie when there is a breath of adulthood is when his father final suggests he do something other than sitting on his dead a*s all day.  I remember that Hoffman was such a movie idol of the boomers in the sixties.  Good Lord what that says about us.  At a time when the average American kid was just going about life or possible serving in Vietnam, we are treated to a recent graduate who is a detestable weenie yet he gets a terrific fox for a girlfriend.  Of course, at the end of the movie she makes a breathtakingly bad and also amazingly immature decision.  In the end, this movie says a lot about the semi-narcissistic culture that defines the boomers to this day.  And, really, if one doesn't take it too seriously, you can appreciate how laughable the whole thing is.",1405209600,,1070,4.446153846153846

952166,4,6305034397,"The primary feature of this film is not the careers of the actors launched: rather as one of the most beautifully crafted pieces of cinema in history.  Every word and frame carefully builds upon one another in a comedic drama that stains the bounds of reason.  Yet, in the world of the film, have a place due to effort leading to the moment and the way in which they're captured.  The continuity editing, done to an extent which rivals Kubrick, adds to the comedic effect as the viewer tries to laugh off the tension and ""agitation"" that characters can't seem to.

The acting in the film is meant to be the accent, not the focus, of the film.  Granted, the situations and conversations had between characters often serves of the focal point, but even then the weight of it's commentary is only as strong as the world in which it occurs.  These are often subtle, which the film gives the viewer an opportunity (if not ample) to find it in the extended duration of the base sequences which comprise the film.

As to it's place as the greatest of all films is yet to be determined.  It's critical value, however, cannot be denied.  Yes, Ben is an interesting person, but the constant focus on him creates a void in character development from the ensemble.  It does comment on Ben, or anyone's, extent which they can know a person.  This is just one the massive number of symbolic and cultural criticism that can be found in the film: whether its the world of the fish tank, the cage, the mind, or just another person.  Further, the growth of Ben is seen as different from the changes in other character, the difference being the duration of effect on the character.

Things that bothered me:

they played the same 3 songs throughout the entire movie.

It was too surreal ( how many of you ladies out there would go meet up with your mother's rapist? How many ladies out there would not freakout if someone told you they loved you after hanging out for the first time ?

952578,4,6305034397,"The Graduate, a 1967 classic, gives us a view of Dustin Hoffman's prowess at acting.  He plays an awkward, funny, lost in space character named Benjamin who is just out of college and has no idea what to do with his life now.  While he's searching for somewhere to go or something to do, a longtime family friend who is old enough to be his mother begins to seduce him.  Mrs. Robinson, played by Anne Bancroft, provides Ben with an outlet and something to do with his summer other than apply to graduate school or anything else.  He spends his days lazing in his pool and nights finding hotel rooms to continue Mrs. Robinson's affair.  The tides begin to get rough, however, when Ben reconnects with Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine, played by the stunning Katharine Ross.

This particular DVD has a few special features including a making of the film documentary, an interview with Dustin Hoffman, and the soundtrack.

There are a few of holes left in the plot and some of the characters, but overall this was a very well made movie. Dustin Hoffman plays the socially awkward kid with no personality perfectly (surprised?). Anne Bancroft does a great job as the seductress/cougar/jealous, over-protective mother. The emotional and moral flip-flopping is a real draw back in the film, but also can be seen as a small realization of the fickle human heart and psyche.

I saw The Graduate when I was 9 years old when I rented it and I fell in love with it and kept for a month and then returned back to Netfilx The Graduate is one of my favorite movies of all time! I also have hardcover version the novel written by Charles Webb!

Gotta love the characters Benjamin (Dustin Hoffman, my all time favorite actor ever!, Straw Dogs, Marathan Man), Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft, The Pumpkin Eater, The Miracle Worker) and Elaine (Katharine Ross, Butch Cassidy And The Sun Dance Kid, The Stepford Wives)!

952772,4,6305034397,"Some may see this film as a comedy drama that is not in the category of great movies. However I feel if nothing else, The Graduate is culturally significant because it ushered in an age in the late 1960s where films focused on trying to attract younger audiences. Along with its good writing this film was one of the forerunners in using popular music in its soundtrack. Starring Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft, and Katherine Ross with direction by Mike Nichols, the film opens with Benjamin Braddock returning home from college. He has excelled in many ways and yet he feels bored and alienated from his parents. However the naive Benjamin soon finds himself in an affair with an older woman. This further confuses him as he figures out what to do with his life. His unknowing parents want him to date a girl attending Berkeley. Things become complicated since it turns out to be Mrs. Robinson's daughter. Not wanting anything to happen between Benjamin and Elaine, Mrs. Robinson sabotages the relationship and tries to marry her daughter off while her own marriage goes down the tube. Benjamin who is ultimately in love with Elaine crashes the wedding and takes her away to face an unknown life ahead. With the help of a memorable Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack, this film ushered in a new age geared toward the younger generations.",1370044800,2,1333,4.82532751091703

Upon watching it all the way through, a few things jump out as me, mostly how flat the characters of Ben and Elaine seem.  At least Mrs. Robinson has some intrigue, but you still have to read into her motives some to really get it.  Maybe seeming drab, lifeless, and then irrational (wedding scene) is something that is supposed to help communicate the age and inclination of the Ben and Elaine characters, but it seems like more character development earlier in the movie and perhaps casting actors closer in age to the characters would have helped more.  That is probably just the style of film this is and maybe I have a hard time relating to the characters because we're from such different eras and seeing a 30 year old Hoffman playing a 20 year old on an HD TV really ruins the illusion.  Also, the overuse of ""Sound of Silence"" was really distracting.  Meh.",1366588800,2,1027,4.494623655913978

953109,5,6305034397,"I'd not seen this great film in a long time, indeed, had forgotten how it actually ended.  I had to see what Wikipedia had on it, as I watched the movie a number of times.  That's where Robert Osbourne must get his leadins/outs for TCM.  Most of the reviews I've read here focus on the technical aspects of the film itself, and that's fine.  I don't know much about those things.  I'll assume everyone is familiar with the basic storyline, so I'll not belabor the details.

What I take exception to is my man Roger Ebert's much-later assessment that Mrs. Robinson deserved more sympathy and that Ben was ""an insufferable creep.""  He's wrong.  This not a story about a young man's affair with an older woman.  It's about social pressure and the devestating effects it can have on the young -- Ben and Elaine and even Mrs. Robinson herself when she was their age.  I saw The Graduate at the theater, first run.  I was twenty years-old myself, and at the time just saw it as an hilarious comedy.  Forty-five years later it looks altogether different.  If Ben is creepy, it may well have been caused by they creepy things going on around him.  On the edge anyway, the actions of Mrs. Robinson pushed him over.  Indeed, in the beginning he is a basically sincere and honorable young man.  He's led astray by a woman old enough to know better and caught up in her own narcicism.  She deliberatly sets out to destroy him because he represents the promise that had once elluded her.  When he later determines to fullfill it with her own daughter, she comes completely unglued.

The ending is somewhat ambiguous.  You'd like to think that things get sorted out for Ben and Elaine and that they live happily ever after.  But you know life ain't that simple and that they're off to a shaky start.  It's clear, however, that Ben is a better man than Elaine's husband, Carl, who is revealed to be the real creep and with whom she could not have had a good life.  The potential, if not the promise, of a happy ending resolves the story about as well as it could have.

The Graduate is worth watching every few years for a lifetime . . .",1362960000,2,2122,4.451948051948052

953112,4,6305034397,"Mrs. Robinson.  Easily the most identifiable icon of infidelity in cinematic histoire.  A bored, pampered housewife, seducing a youth lost in his own angst, makes THE GRADUATE the timeless classic that it is.  (Not to mention the Simon & Garfunkel musical score, which also is timeless.)  Often very funny--yet always poignant--this is a film that identified the turbulent Sixties.  What a problematic, dysfunctional decade that was!

Dustin Hoffman became a mega-star as uninspired Benjamin Braddock, a recent graduate from an east coast school hanging out in his parents' digs in LA for one endless summer.  Benjamin has no idea what he wants to do with his life. . .or when he wants to get in the game.  But he's not as bored as crafty Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft is fabulous), a longtime family friend, who makes herself readily available for young Ben to sample her wares.  Like their lives, the affair itself is an exercise in tedious mundanity, until Benjamin's psyche is piqued by Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine (Katharine Ross).  Benjamin falls head over heels with Elaine, which angers Mrs. Robinson to the point the affair is readily exposed, causing Benjamin to employ 24/7 damage control.  And we all know the climactic scene where Benjamin, pounding on the plate glass windows of a church, disrupts Elaine's nuptials; the ensuing flight of the lovebirds signifying the outside-the-box behavior characteristic of the Sixties.

Hoffman and Bancroft are superb in their respective roles--even though in ""real"" life, Bancroft was only six years Hoffman's senior.  The supporting cast is worthy, the musical score (again) is exceptional, and the dynamics of this film defined a generation.  It does meander a bit during the Benjamin/Elaine romance (the ""When are we going to get married"" routine growing horrifically stale), yet few films readily identify the shifting cultural paradigm that was the Sixties as aptly as THE GRADUATE.  ""Mrs. Robinson, are you trying to seduce me?""

You have a young graduate who should have had a bright future, but became a drifter because he decided to have an affair with a married woman.

Then he honestly thought that he could live happily ever after with her despite all the lies, and the fact that he was sleeping with her mother?!

This European blu-ray release which appears to be for both regions A & B as it plays on my Region A player is light-years better than the old standard dvd version that I had.  Gone are the white spots and other picture impurities and now we get a very nice picture quality on 1080p with no visible imperfections.  The sound quality is in DTS-HD MA stereo which is fine as the movie is mostly dialogue driven and so I doubt very much that a 5.1 surround treatment would vastly improve upon the sound quality anyway.  The packaging is almost totally cardboard and the blu-ray disc fits snugly onto the only plastic part of the package.  The only problem I find with this otherwise great packaging is that the glue is not sticky enough and the inside part appears to be close to coming apart but I guess I can always apply more glue myself should this happen in the future.  There is also a nice 20-page colour booklet containing an essay on the film by Marc Webb.  The much more important picture and sound qualities though do not disappoint and are a massive improvement over the standard dvd versions.  Although this film is very much of its time in the 60s I still found myself enjoying what is obviously one of the best films ever made and I expect to re-visit this classic over the years.

There are simply too many positives to mention here, but suffice it to say, 'The Graduate,' one of director Mike Nichols' best (along with 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?', 'Barefoot in the Park,' & 'The Odd Couple') is a defining peek into that brief moment in the late 60s when the ultra-conservatism of the 50s was just beginning to wane. Besides Nichols' superb direction, it unfolds with a great script (Buck Henry, Calder Willingham, Charles Webb), great score by Simon & Garfunkel, and absolutely superb acting by all.

A must inclusion for any film aficionado's collection.

953320,5,6305034397,"first and foremost, this is a classic morality play.
it speaks volumes about the choices we make and their conseqences.
benjamin is a naive,virginal college graduate who wants his life
to be different. different indeed. it is endlessly fascinating that
mrs robinson chooses to confront benjamin with her sexual desires
as he stands in front of elaine's portrait. his fateful choice of
sex over traditional love sets the tone for the movie. after all,
mr robinson is his father's business partner. mrs robinson, as we
learn later got pregnant in college and had to marry. she is unhappy,
unfulfilled, and she and her husband live in separate rooms and
live separate lives. she resents her daughter and the seduction of
benjamin is her revenge. of course, benjamin is so focused on the
seductive older woman that he sabotages any real chance to have
a normal relationship with elaine. she is as vapid and clueless as benjamin.
despite learning about the affair between her mother and benjamin, she is
equally vengeful. she allows herself to get involved with benjamin at
school rather then follow a traditional romantic path. somehow,
they end up a the back of a bus going nowhere, complete strangers.

running through this tragic comedy is the theme of water.
water is the essence of life. it sustains us and we cant live
without it. but water is also dangerous. if we're not careful,
we can drown. indeed do the characters in this movie drown in a
maelstrom of suburban angst,poor moral choices and a me first existence.
the first water image is the friends of ben's family gatherd around
the pool. when mrs robinson enters ben's room, she throws the keys
to his car in the fish tank. both mrs and mr robinson ply ben with
ice and drinks. but the seminal water image is ben at the bottom of his
pool in scuba gear. it is then that the metaphorical drowning begins.
it is then that he decides to call mrs robinson and set up a tryst.
later, when ben is at elaine's house to pick her up for date,
mrs robinson jumps into the car. it is pouring rain. curious. it is
summer in southern california and it never rains in socal in the summer.
dripping wet, ben confronts elaine. mrs robinson enters the scene.
mike nichols then shoots the most poignant rack focus shot i have ever
seen. at first elaine's face is out of focus. she is confused. when the focus
clears her face she realizes the relationship between ben and her mother.
she unceremoniously throws him out. the lasting image at the end of the scene is
a pitiful sopping wet mrs robinson. no sexuality there. just a drowned rat
who becomes a small object of pity as the camera pulls back.
there are so many other water scenes. the braddock family pool where ben
is just drifting. the steamy bathroom where ben's mother confronts him
about his nightly jaunts. and the fountain at elaine's school.

at the end, everyone drowns in a pool of poor choices and despair.
ben and elaine run off to nowhere. her new husband is left at the altar.
mr and mrs robinson are divorcing and who knows where life will take them.
ben's parents must wonder where all their hopes and dreams have gone.
indeed, at the end, all we are left with are the sounds of silence",1333843200,2,3202,4.605954465849387
953321,5,6305034397,"""The Graduate"" is magnificent. A perfect blend of comedy and drama. It's not surprising to me that this 1967 movie was nominated for seven Academy Awards.

Every single actor in this film is perfect for his or her part -- from Dustin Hoffman, to Anne Bancroft, to Katharine Ross, to Murray Hamilton (and everyone else).

The photography and camerawork are worthy of high praise as well. I like the way Oscar-winning director Mike Nichols composed some of the shots to take full advantage of the film's very wide 2.35:1 screen dimensions.

Plus there's the unique way Nichols has framed certain scenes, elevating the film a few more notches on the superior scale. For example, the scene at the hotel where a very nervous Hoffman approaches the desk clerk (played by Buck Henry). The dialogue exchanged between the two parties, including the very funny quote shown in the title of this review, takes place through an opening in the woodwork just off to the side of the hotel's front desk. I love it.

The film's (for the most part) feel-good ending is certainly a bit over the top on the ""realistic"" scale, but it's the way this excellent movie had (and needed) to end, in my opinion. Anything else would have been decidedly disappointing.

If you've never seen ""The Graduate"" before, or if you haven't watched it in a long time, then do yourself a favor and get the film on DVD or Blu-ray. It's worth every penny.

If so my guess would be that in 1966/67 when this was filmed it simply wasn't practicable to mount a (Mitchell?) Cinemascope rig to such a tiny Italian convertible going at 70mph with car top down... So maybe they shot this with a normal lens and ""stretched"" the image to fit widescreen presentation?

953387,5,6305034397,"This movie added a new (at the time) bit of terminology to the societal lexicon--the ""Mrs. Robinson"", describing a woman of early middle age who goes after a young guy. Four decades later of course it's evolved into ""cougar"". Anyway, Ben Braddock (the young Dustin Hoffman--the role that made him a star) has just got his Bachelor's degree and a new Alfa Romeo as a graduation present (must be nice to be an attorney's kid). His parents (Elizabeth Wilson and the pre-""St. Elsewhere""/ pre-KITT William Daniels) throw a party for him in which everybody is all over him like flies on doo-doo when he'd prefer to just chill out. There's a paradox in that--the party which is ""in your honor"" but which always seems to boil down to everyone else's preferences. One of the guests who is soon all over Ben in a different sort of way is the wife of his Dad's law partner--the soon-to-be-iconic Mrs. Robinson (Anne Baxter). None of the older generation here have first names, you understand. That may be a none-too-subtle sign of the Generation Gap right there.
So the virginal Ben embarks on an affair with Mrs. Robinson. Never mind that even back then real college kids were past that hurdle not long after the first Homecoming weekend. Ben's parents are clueless about the affair and blatantly trying to matchmake him with the Robinson daughter Elaine (Katherine Ross). Unbeknownst to them, Mrs. Robinson is dead set against that--her boy-toy with her baby girl--no way no how. Despite her opposition, the two start dating and start getting serious.
Some of this movie's shticks age like Ben's Alfa--it looks like a real beater by the last scenes. Like the way Simon & Garfunkel's music gets used--""Scarborough Fair"" is one of my all-time favorite songs of theirs, but in one lengthy scene it gets practically looped like an MP3 player locked on ""repeat"". The tendency of the adults to yammer nonstop at the younger people as if so much as pausing to draw a breath means defeat of some sort.
Partial ""spoiler alert"" here--there's a scene at a church in which Ben fights off attackers with the cross off the altar, then as he escapes he slides the cross through the front door handles to bar the door and trap his ""enemies"" inside the sanctuary. Looking back, I can't believe how shocked I was at that ""sacrilege"".
Also in the cast is Norman Fell as the landlord of a rooming house Ben stays in during his suit of Elaine, a role Fell reprises a few years later in TV's ""Three's Company"". Plus a young Kevin Tighe years before ""Emergency"" as a frat brother of Elaine's college beau.",1307404800,,2573,4.72
953388,5,6305034397,"First of all, we must remember that this film is NOT simply about a sordid affair between 21 year old Ben and much older Mrs. Robinson. What this film is about is stated in the first line of the film, by the pilot of the plane: ""We are about to begin our descent into Los Angeles"". And by descent, director Mike Nichols meant that descent into the PLASTIC, decadent, consumer-oriented society of LA in the 1960's (although the film would still be valid for today).
The film is about Ben (Dustin Hoffman) returning from the East Coast (college) back into the world of artificial, plastic people, and plastic realities, plastic hopes and plastic dreams. (Check out the first cut on Frank Zappa's ""Absolutely Free"" - called ""Plastic people"" - produced at the same time as the film).
Ben states in the first full scene after the intro, that he is concerned about his future. He says, ""I don't know, I wanted to be . . . different"". That is, a real person, not the plastic people that make up the parents and the Robinsons and the others at Ben's party.
If you watch carefully, Nichols has made what is essentially a black and white film (the colors of plastic). All throughout the first act, black and white themes of plasticity predominate. The Robinson's house, is black and white on the outside as well as on the inside, with the tacky black and white plastic bar stools, Mrs. Robinson dressed in black, etc. Yet outside the picture window (during the famous seduction scene), everything is green and alive, in direct contrast to the plasticity of the world inside, the world which Ben so desperately wishes to escape. The only time that there is any real color during Act I is when Mrs. R. invites Ben into Elaine's room to see her portrait. There is a soft pink glow superimposed over the black and white plasticity of the Robinson house.
This black and white motif is continued in practically all the important scenes: Ben's room at his parent's house is wall-papered in black and white, with black stripes representing the bars of the cage within which Ben has found himself trapped. The room at the Taft hotel is in black and white; Ben in the diving gear is black and white.; Nichols is forcing upon the audience this concept of PLASTICITY of the society. Only when Ben first takes Elaine outmon a date is there any real sense of color, since she is the first REAL (non-plastic) person he has met. But black and white continues to dominate the first act until the end when we get the famous camera shot of Mrs. Robinson, soaking wet, dressed in black, standing in the corner of two white walls, saying ""Goodbye, Benjamin"". Act I constitutes Ben finding that there is a way out of this plastic world - but only through Elaine.
Act Two constitutes the montage sequence, so masterfully done by Nichols with Simon and Garfunkel's ""Scarborough Fair"" background. Here color predominates as Ben carefully watches Elaine and begins to formulate his plan for escape - to escape with Elaine.
Act III, the finale, is, like most sonatas, in presto agitato. It is Ben's desperate attempt to get to Elaine before she has a chance to get married to the ""ape-man"" (see the zoo scene) Carl. When Ben finally reaches the Church, guess what?, it too is in stark black and white, again representing the values of Ben's parents and friends. (Also, we never get the first names of the parents or the Robinsons).
This is a film that explores the desperation of a young man attempting to escape from a phony and plastic life, but who almost gets drowned in that false-ness (the affair with Mrs. R.). The film is a classic: timeless, relevant, and naked in its message. If you have not seen it, DO SO! If you have seen it, watch it again; you'll be amazed at how well Mike Nichols incorporates the black/white/plastic theme on so many different levels. I could go on and on, so get the film (with the commentaries). You will not be disappointed.",1306800000,7,3925,4.624641833810888
953389,5,6305034397,"Dustin Hoffman became a star after appearing in 1967's ""The Graduate"" alongside screen great Anne Bancroft. Playing a naive college graduate Hoffman's character finds himself being pursued by the older Mrs. Robinson played to perfection by Bancroft. Things really get entangled when Mrs. Robinson's daughter, portrayed by Katherine Ross, also falls for the young man.

 ""The Graduate"" to me is a perfect film from the performances (especially Bancroft's deep dark voice...""Benjamin..."") to the amazing soundtrack by Simon and Garfunkel which really epitomizes late sixties America to Mike Nichol's superb direction for which he received the Oscar. The movie would receive a total of seven Oscar nominations and go on to become one of the most critically acclaimed films ever. Adjusted for inflation ""The Graduate"" has also gone on to be the 19th highest grossing film making over $100,000,000 at the box office on a $3,000,000 budget.

**Spoiler Alert**

The Graduate was a unique movie for its time because of when it was made, who the actors were, and how America itself was changing.  The movie made during the Vietnam War, and agitators are mentioned a couple of times during the film.  Anti-war demonstrations were being conducted on college campuses all around the United States, especially at Berkeley, the university highlighted through much of the film.

  It however must be said that the movie only touches upon this fact, the analysis of the movie goes into deeper historical context than just the war which was going on at the time the movie was filmed.  So much culture was changing in America at that time.  Some things that stand out in the movie are the generational gap, between the older people and the younger ones.  The older more mature people whose lives are already defined, such as Ben's Parents represent an older America who represents old values, traditions, good morals and an old time America in which the father was the main provider for the family and knew what best for the family.  The younger generation thought that the older was nave, didn't understand them, and didn't get what was really going on.

  The older generation had a defined family setting, the nuclear family, again traditional that was to be seen as the best parts of that, however we can see that as Elain's father is divorcing her mother that this area in America is beginning to fail and more and more marriages are falling apart ending in divorce.  Perhaps alluding to the ""Free love"" that was espoused during that period in history, to break the bonds of matrimony and live free, and just ""shack up"".

  This ""Free love"" might be able to possibly extend to Mrs. Robinson, the women whom seduced Ben.  Women seducing men was unheard of during that time, let alone a woman of this age difference, yet so many things can be taken from the se4duction itself that lets us know how America is changing.  Take a look at the naivety of Ben, as he drives her home, get out of his car, accompanies her to the door, goes inside, gets a drink, head up to her bedroom, helps her dress off, and all this time, not up until, the very end has he any idea whatsoever that she wants to seduce him.  The seduction by women was unheard of in society, let alone a movie and repeated small brief flashes of her breast was unheard of at the time as well.  The movie makers where testing the waters, and telling the ratings boards that America isn't this Nave, that they can handle brief nudity in films and that they shouldn't have the belief that the culture isn't changing between the older and the younger, because it is.

  Even after the seduction by Mrs. Robinson Ben is still in the precarious situation of not knowing what he wants to be, though he does know what he don't want to be, and that is like his parents and the people of his parents' generation.  The movie plays upon this as that they are not above their own faults; Mrs. Robinson has a long lived love affair with Ben, all the while cheating on her own husband with a boy half her age.  Totally unheard of and still a very great fault portrayed by her that the older generation might not be so traditional in values after all, so who are they to tell the younger generation how to live, how to act, and what to say, especially so after they have succumbed to their own form of evil?

  However upon further inspection of Ben's character we can see that he thought of Mrs. Robinson as his only way out.  One of the early scenes Mrs. Robinson throws Ben's car keys in the fish tank.  This could represent several things.  Firstly that Mr's Robinson was the key to what he wanted and the freedom he so much thought he deserved.  He was just like a fish in the fish tank, caught in an area with very little move room and a go nowhere but in circles attitude unsure of what was happening or which way to go.  We see this played out again as he is in a diving suit in the pool, he tries to come back up but his parents just push him right back down.  Mrs. Robinson could be seen as his way out from a trapped existence, and she was the ""key"" to doing so.

  All in this entire movie is about a transitional change from a more conservative culture to a more liberal one.  This stance is repeated many times throughout the course of the film.  It plays upon the fact that love can be used for ill or for gain.  The differences between right and wrong is not always clear, and that lust and love are two different things, and while the movie challenges us to think about it in terms of a changing America in an antiwar type of culture, it still manages to entertain and tell us things about the human condition in that we are all human and just as likely to fail as to win and the winds of cultural change will blow no matter how hard you hold out.",1290729600,,4876,4.397321428571429

In any case, my wife and I were shopping at Ross and I spotted it on the DVD bargain shelves. I couldn't resist. My wife had never heard of it, but she was willing to go along with my word that she'd enjoy it. We both watched it last night and enjoyed it immensely. It's an exceptionally well done movie.

This release was quite a positive surprise; considering it was not really something I expected to benefit greatly in getting the high-def treatment. However, the picture quality is very respectable throughout, and does not appear to have been artificially ""souped-up"" with edge-enhancement or digital noise reduction. It does have a few (mostly scenery or reduced-lighting scenes) which do show the age if one looks closely, but still I have to admit that it looked pretty fresh for being a 40+ year old catalog title.

The audio I did expect to benefit greatly from being remastered into lossless 5.1, though, and the DTS HD Master Audio track delivered in spades. Both the dialogue--which is clear and intelligible throughout--but not least the excellent music by Simon & Garfunkel makes this worth buying just for the soundtrack alone.

As for the movie itself, the performance by Dustin Hoffman is superb--I feel he perfectly captured all the mannerisms; the awkwardness & uneasiness his character exhibits after being thrust into the situations by the also brilliant Anne Bancroft (in an iconic performance)--in a way that is so subtle but still hilariously funny at the same time--that it deserves some major credit (this was after all his first major role.) I notice another reviewer mentioned that he came across as ""annoying""--which just shows what a great performance it really is (not that this reviewer thought so, but I can see how it can be interpreted that way)

The directing is also flawless, and a Mike Nichols movie through and through. (Only bettered by Catch-22 in my opinion--can't wait to see that on this format as well!)

953529,4,6305034397,"This is one of the defining films of my generation, and of course I saw it when it came out in 1967. Seeing it again after all these years I was struck by both how funny it is and by the brittle, cynical and brilliant performance by Anne Bancroft as Mrs. Robinson. She really is flawless in a part that might easily lend itself to overacting. Instead she is subtle, controlled, focused, and authentic in a way that is both sexy and chilling with just a hint of ironic humor. The maternal manner with which she treats virginal Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman in a breakout role) emphasizes the creepy, almost incestuous nature of their sterile affair.  Mike Nichols has directed a number of sexual/relationship comedies, including Carnal Knowledge (1971), Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966), Nora Ephron's Heartburn (1986) and Carrie Fisher's Postcards from the Edge (1990). Nichols's films typically feature talented and charismatic actors and actresses who explore in a deceptively humorous manner the dark side of our human nature. The humor usually has an edgy quality while the taboo elements are somehow resolved into happy endings as in a musical comedy. Nichols likes to work with material from another medium and make it his own. Typically, The Graduate is adapted from the novel by Charles Webb. Nichols also likes to feature cutting edge popular music in the score. What we hear in the background and played over the opening credits is Simon and Garfunkel's ""Sounds of Silence."" Of course Paul Simon wrote the song ""Mrs. Robinson"" for this movie, but what I didn't realized until now is his ""It's all happening at the zoo"" was probably inspired in part by the zoo scene in this film.  Dustin Hoffman's confused and drifting Benjamin, worried about his future and suffocated by his parents' generation, knocked everybody out in those days with his dead-panned, literal delivery of one-liners, some of which were written by Buck Henry, who plays the desk clerk at the rendezvous hotel. I especially loved Ben's answer when his father, enquiring about his Quixotic plan to marry Mrs. Robinson's daughter Elaine (Katharine Ross), asks, ""Isn't this a half-baked idea?"" In dead seriousness, Benjamin says, ""No, sir. It's completely baked.""  Memorable is Norman Fell (whom most of us recall from TV's long-running comedy, Three's Company) in a small part as the landlord of the Berkeley rooming house. He is of course a past master at dead-panning one-liners; in fact, he is a master at mute dead-panning. One of the funniest bits in the movie is when the camera catches his face as Elaine's father comes out of Ben's room spewing obscenities and insults at Ben.  What we loved about this movie was the youthful point of view; the wonderful chase scene at the end, a Hollywood staple made fresh; the sympathetic character of Benjamin with whom we could readily identify; the clich-ridden and shallow parents being slyly made fun of; and the sense of getting what we want out of life and doing it our own way. This is a coming-of-ager and a romance and a social satire rolled into one, and a classic Hollywood movie that no afficionado would want to miss.  But see this for Anne Bancroft, a brilliant and perhaps underrated actress in one of her most memorable roles.",1253404800,3,3275,4.91500904159132

I don't know, honestly. This movie is so fabulous everytime I watch it though- Bancroft's Mrs. Robinson is the consumate cougar, and her performance is iconic. And she IS hot, as well as deliciously, stalkerishly creepy in this role! You don't need high def to appreciate that.

Nichols gave us a funny, but sophisticated take on a young man who just graduated college and, with degree in hand, doesn't have a clue about what would make him happy.  Guys like sex.  So, luckily at first, he has sex with a neighbor, an older woman, but it soon becomes routine. Then he falls in love with the neighbor's daughter and things get very complicated.

After they calm down, the movie with sincere expressions on their faces.  ""The Graduate"" was a very tasteful film. I found it to be quite funny and that the story could basically fit our time period, not just the 60's. This characteristic is not commonly found in movies that were made more then four decades ago. This could be contributed to that the movie didn't give much of any relation from the events of the plot to the time period it was set. It also had a very complicated story.  The acting was quite superb. I did not notice one character that seemed awkward or that I didn't like. Dustin Hoffman and Anne Boncroft (Ben and Mrs. Robinson) acted remarkably well especially when I heard that they were around the same age. in the film, Ben seems to be much younger then Mrs. Robinson. Not just in appearance, but also in the way that they acted. Nervous young Ben as compared to calm uncaring Mrs. Robinson. All the characters in this movie did very well in getting into their roles.  The feelings and moods of the film were portrayed quite well. You could tell what Ben was feeling just by the every once and while shots of him either on a plane or on the bottom of the pool. He looked like he was lost in his own mind. The music was also very important to showing the mood of the story, and the soundtrack is quite amazing if I do say so myself.  The film kept me interested because of how the characters grow with the story and the plot. If you just looked at the characters at the beginning of the movie and the end you can see that they all have changed a lot.  In short, I really enjoy this movie and I will recommend it many people that I know. Plus, if they don't like it they at least have to respect the music in it. I have to say I think this is my favorite film from the 60's.",1222560000,,3006,4.266666666666667

953564,2,6305034397,"This is as good as black comedies come and Dustin Hoffman shows us just how great an actor he is even all those years ago.  I was impressed also with the great direction and especially the way the scenes transition from one to the next; inspired work indeed.  In some ways the film is also touching as it reveals that behind the facade of prosperity and family wholesomeness lies some very unhappy and unfulfilled lives.

Hoffman's character feels lost as despite achieving all that society tells him is important i.e. graduating with top honours and a letter in sport from a top university he still feels empty and unfulfilled seeking meaning in life and a way out of a depression that stems from knowing that he doesn't have the answers.  Mrs Robinson feels the same way being in a loveless marriage and seeking a way out but has given up not having the strength and courage to go against the mainstream view of what she has to be.  The scene at the end when her daughter tells her that it's not too late for her to escape from the straight-jacket of the kind of life her parents want for her is what made the whole film.  Hoffman and Ross' characters having the courage to go against the mainstream, to rebel and to live life rather than to be a slave to the mainstream view of what it should be.  Very 60s ideology indeed and hence a very apt movie for the times.

This DVD though is poor and you should wait for the inevitable hopefully much better picture and sound quality restored Blu-ray version to come out.  Sonically, good surround sound options DTS or Dolby 5.1 at a minimum plus more special features should be included in that release.  For now, give this DVD version a miss and save the bucks for the restored version.",1217116800,,1734,4.476190476190476
953565,4,6305034397,"This is an atypical review for me folks.  Rather than review this classic film, which most people have already either seen or heard about, I wanted to entice you fans out there to post some commentary on some of the points I have covered below.  After all, Amazon does tell us to 'make it fun'!

We all know that this is one of those no-brainer, without-a-doubt comedy classics that is seemingly above reproach (a la ""Some Like It Hot"", ""Annie Hall"", ""Tootsie"", Dr. Strangelove"", etc...).  However, after viewing this one yet AGAIN the other night (my guess is, I've seen this film over twenty times now), I couldn't help but pose these questions: (spoiler alert)

1) Would the film be as great w/out the music of Simon & Garfunkel?  In my opinion, few film soundtracks/scores have had a greater impact than this one (not including musicals of course).
2) What did Mrs. Robinson find so alluring about Benjamin?  Why would a woman in her position do something so self-destructive when she didn't even seem like she was all that attracted to Benjamin in the first place?  If she was just out for some casual sex w/ a young, pretty boy toy why would she choose to do it w/ one of her best friend's sons?
3) How do you explain the beautiful, intelligent, and wholesome character of Elaine Robinson (Katherine Ross) falling in love w/ the shallow, uncharismatic, aloof Benjamin?  They only went on one date and he took her to a strip club for God sakes!!!  Then he begins to stalk her!  To all you young cats out there, I can tell you that this approach usually will get you thrown into prison and/or getting your butt kicked by the girl's father, brother, or friends.
4) Would any woman, no matter what the circumstances, want to get involved with a guy who just spent the last several months making the beast w/ two backs w/ her mother?  Not only is it completely repulsive and vulgar, but how do you ever forget about something like that, let alone forgive it?  The thought of it makes my skin crawl.
5) How do you propose to a woman you barely know?  How does that woman even remotely take you seriously (we are talking about a beautiful, well-to-do, educated young woman w/ seemingly everything going for her)?  And that's not even taking into account Ben's sordid affair w/ mom.
6) Supposedly Benjamin is rebelling against conformity and the conventional, artificial (PLASTICS!) world that his affluent parents and their friends subscribe to.  However, he has no problems still living at home, laying on a raft all day in their pool drinking beer and working on his tan.  To me, that's not being a rebel, that's being a spoiled, rich kid bum!
7) And last, but certainly not least (for I could go on for days), are there really any endearing characteristics about Benjamin at all?  To me, he is a lazy, spoiled, self-absorbed, unambitious, aloof, whiny loner w/ almost zero charisma.  The guy doesn't have one friend!  For example, at his graduation party there was not one person there his own age.  The guy is completely anti-social to everyone he meets.

Yet, despite the contrived love story and illicit romance, this film does work and is quite entertaining, mainly because of the great cinematography, writing, music, directing and acting.  In my humble opinion, Bancroft stole the show and I only wish she had more time on screen.  And Katherine Ross not only possesses the prettiest brown eyes you'll ever see, but by the end of the film we all can't help but to fall in love w/ her winsome, wholesome ways.",1216684800,8,3516,4.661264181523501
953566,5,6305034397,"1967 was a huge year for film.  In my opinion, the best film of that year was Mike Nichols' ""The Graduate"".  It was the most unique film of its time and is now considered a timeless classic.

Aside from it's release date, costumes, props and the Simon & Garfunkel soundtrack place this film in the 60s.  What makes it a timeless classic is that nothing dates it, we see no Vietnam War and no hippies.  Also the themes from this film, coming of age, rebellion (against parents, against the status quo) and alienation all still apply today.

The acting and cinematography make this film a masterful work of art.  Dustin Hoffman accurately portrayed a 21 year old college graduate with a life full of uncertainty.  He was awkward and dryly funny.  Director of photography Robert Surtees added to the uncertainty with inventive cinematography, always placing Ben to the left or right.  Not too mention, the always memorable ""leg"" shot.

""The Graduate"" is a must have movie for all film buffs.  If you don't have it, I highly recommend you get a copy.",1216166400,2,1046,4.686813186813187

953635,5,6305034397,"`The Graduate' is by far one of my favorite movies ever made; maybe top ten, at least top twenty (I never imagined how hard it would be to compile a list of fifty films); the point being that it is pure genius.  Director Mike Nichols takes Calder Willingham's screenplay (based off of Charles Webb's novel of the same name) and delivers it to us with a delicate yet subtle brazenness that adds layers of emotional weight and clarity to the film.  Couple that with a slew of fantastic performances by just about everyone in the cast and you have a film that is legendary, classic and frankly `important' in the catalogue of cinematic achievements.

`The Graduate' tells us the story of young Benjamin Braddock who is just that, a college graduate.  Upon returning home to a life undecided Benjamin finds himself being pursued by the older, beautiful and married Mrs. Robinson.  There is no denying that Benjamin is intrigued by the proposition but he is awkwardly hesitant.  Temptation can only lay undisturbed for a short time and soon Benjamin is entertaining her pursuits and falls into a full-fledged affair with Mrs. Robinson.  His life is finally starting to interest him, and then a corkscrew is thrown in the mix.  Mr. Robinson wants Benjamin to take out their teenage daughter Elaine.  When Benjamin falls in love with her his world starts to unravel as Mrs. Robinson threatens to expose their affair in an effort to keep him away from her daughter.

What make this movie so iconic are the marvelous performances by the entire cast, Hoffman and Bancroft especially.  Anne Bancroft is marvelous as the seductive and manipulative Mrs. Robinson; a woman who knows what she wants and knows how to get it.  She very comfortable slides into character and single handedly created a character that will go down in history as one of the most recognizable and memorable screen vixens.  Dustin Hoffman is marvelous here, truly outstanding.  Benjamin Braddock was his breakthrough and garnered him his first Oscar nomination, which should have been his first win.  His handling of Braddock's awkward shyness (even his audition was an awkward mess) was phenomenal.  He became Benjamin, lived and breathed him, and really delivered in a way that no other actor could have.  I'm often reminded of this performance when I watch Jake Gyllenhaal act, for Gyllenhaal has that same awkwardness about him as Hoffman possesses in this role (maybe that says good things for Gyllenhaal).

The rest of the cast excels as well, especially Katherine Ross, who plays Elaine.  She is welcoming and vivacious and everything a man could want, thus adding to the believability that Benjamin would chose her over her aggressive mother.  Murray Hamilton is great as Mr. Robinson, even if he is underused and William Daniels and Elizabeth Wilson deliver as well as Benjamin's parents.

`The Graduate' is one of those films that defined a generation.  It's a film that captured everything that made the 60's what it was and created a standard for all other films approaching this genre to live up to.  The feeling of the film, the fluidity, the casting; everything down to the music (Simon and Garfunkel were a prime choice) come together beautifully to help embellish the riches springing forth from `The Graduate'.

In the end I must declare that everyone should see this iconic film.  There are so few true gems in this world, so few films that are undeniably splendid.  Even when compiling my list of favorite films I come to realize that many of them are purely of my own opinion; but `The Graduate' is one of those movies that is universally lauded and adored; a film that we call all agree is truly one of the very best.",1208822400,,3699,4.850318471337579

Anne Bancroft, Dustin Hoffman, and Katherine Ross shine as apathetic, anhedonic outcasts in a tale seamlessly combining all of the maladies of being young and confused into one movie.

953640,4,6305034397,"Of course ""The Graduate"" is an iconic film. The casting and the performances are dead-on, and director Mike Nichols deserves the praise he's gotten. Buck Henry did a very good job with the screenplay.

But Nichols and Henry didn't create ""The Graduate,"" which they are often credited with doing--Charles Webb did. Webb is the writer whose novel ""The Graduate"" Nichols and Henry adapted, and he's the author of this work. To read the novel after watching the movie is startling: virtually every line of dialogue in the film is lifted straight from the novel, and the film largely follows the novel scene for scene. As important, the film's characteristic attitude of ironic detachment is no more than faithful to the novel. Certainly, Webb's book reads more like a screenplay--of a movie that in fact got made--than any other novel I've ever read.

The book is a bit darker, perhaps--Benjamin's character in the novel doesn't have quite Dustin Hoffman's Benjamin's naive charm. And it doesn't have Simon and Garfunkel's brilliant soundtrack music! But broadly, the film is a direct translation, and whatever Nichols' and Henry's contributions may be, they simply don't rise to the level of their being called ""The Graduate""'s creators.

953682,5,6305034397,"Like J.D. Salinger's The Catcher In The Rye, The Graduate is an offbeat, tenderly funny and ultimately poignant tale of alienation and youthful angst. It's a coming-of-age story that manages to avoid the pitfalls and platitudes that tend to plague the genre, and winds up saying something truly original about growing up in the modern world, about coming to terms with our futures and confusions, about understanding the people around us, about finding our way and falling in love. It does so with a quiet sense of humor, a perennially wistful tone, and a really cool Simon & Garfunkel soundtrack.

The people behind the film are wonderful- Dustan Hoffman plays the role of Ben Braddock (the film's protagonist and titular character) with just the right mix of starry-eyed introspection and sly wit, earning our sympathies before the opening credits are over and keeping us on his side through the cathartic finale. Anne Bancroft takes on the role of the nigh-on-legendary Mrs. Robinson with smoldering sexuality and a sharp sociopathic edge.

953686,5,6305034397,"Mike Nichols' THE GRADUATE (1967), brilliantly written by Buck Henry and Calder Willingham, is a timeless film masterpiece that speaks profoundly to me.  In 1967 I was in the middle of high school and 16 years old.  In only two years, I would face Viet Nam or the working world or college.  And if I chose college, where would it be and what would my major be?  I was a confused and depressed virgin with no real girlfriend.

Dustin Hoffman plays Benjamin Braddock, who is seduced (actually mindf---ed by a chain-smoking middle-aged friend named Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft at her best).  But Benjamin is really in love with Mrs. Robinson's college student daughter, Elaine (Katharine Ross).  All three actors got Oscar nominations, the script was also nominated, and Nichols won Best Director.  This is an amazing work of art that speaks to an entire generation, just as REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE (1955) spoke to an earlier generation.  That it was partly filmed at both UC Berkeley and USC, two of my college alma maters, is only another plus.

What is amazing about THE GRADUATE is that it is totally free of things that might date it, like sex and drug love-ins, love beads, and hippies.  Watching it for the first time in fifteen years, on widescreen DVD, I was stunned by the performances, every perfect line of dialogue, and very stylish cinematography by Robert Surtees.  We are in a shallow upper class Southern California world, with the camera shooting underwater in a swimming pool, through aquariums, and in mirrored surfaces.  Surtees and Nichols constantly do interesting things with the Panavision canvas, like beautiful soft lighting and backgrounds in focus while foregrounds are fuzzy.  They love playing with darkness.

The dazzling editing is by Sam O'Steen, who later worked with Polanski on CHINATOWN (1974).  He has fun with the big seduction scene and quick cutting, as well as the legendary cut from swimming pool mattress to Mrs. Robinson's bed.  Contrasts are always inspired.  Surtees, O'Steen, and Nichols are a dream team to match the dazzling performances.

I am reviewing THE GRADUATE at 40 DVD, which includes two audio commentaries (one with Hoffman and Ross, the other with Nichols and director Steven Soderbergh); fellow directors and other industry figures talking about how influential the movie remains for them; Buck Henry talking about the screenplay and other items; Hoffman chatting about how he got the lead role in a movie conceived in terms of all blonde, blue-eyed WASPS like in the Charles Webb novel;  and the impossible-to-overstate importance of Simon and Garfunkel's incomparable song score.  (They get a separate CD here with complete versions of songs done piecemeal in the film.)

For those who care, the movie is NOT in anamorphic widescreen, but looks great in regular 2.35 widescreen with beautiful color and matchless compositions.  THE GRADUATE at 40 is a wonderful addition to my DVD collection, possibly a favorite movie of all time in what it has to say about the 1960's and the formative years of everyone my age, and a definite must-see in this lovely new DVD edition from 20th Century Fox Home Video.",1190332800,4,3164,4.9961832061068705

At the same time, it has a timeless quality for new generations simply because it's a consistently witty, observant piece of cinema targeted to anyone who has experienced that sense of post-academic confusion when the responsibilities of real life inevitably intrude.

This is an accomplished film for someone directing only his second film. But then again, judging from his subsequent work all the way to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Angels-in-America/dp/B0001I2BUI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Angels in America</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Closer/dp/B0007OCG4W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Closer</a>, Mike Nichols seems to have come into filmmaking fully understanding the frailties of the human condition and knowing how to convey them in a way that audiences could empathize. It is a testament to Nichols and screenwriters Buck Henry and Calder Willingham that the social comedy aspects of this film do not seem at all dated. In fact, despite its provocative veneer, it's really old-fashioned in key ways from the protagonist's moralistic tendencies to his romantically compulsive motivations toward the end. Dustin Hoffman was pulled out of complete obscurity to play Benjamin, the alienated, recent college graduate drifting amid his parents' Southern California upper-middle class, swimming pool-centered ennui.

As Benjamin figures out what to do with his life and faces unwanted advice from his parents' friends, enter Mrs. Robinson, a bored, restless wife, a self-proclaimed alcoholic and about as sympathetic as Lady Macbeth. It's hard to imagine what the original choice, Doris Day, would have done with this role, as it takes Anne Bancroft's formidable arsenal of skills to bring this vituperative woman to life. She gives a masterful performance. The hotel sequence where Benjamin awkwardly asks Mrs. Robinson for a drink is shrewdly observed and downright hilarious - the suspicious hotel clerk (Henry, the film's co-screenwriter) eyeing Benjamin's every move; the reception line which Benjamin pretends to know (TV veterans Alice Ghostley and Marion Lorne, Esmeralda and Aunt Clara from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bewitched/dp/B000U5HZ2Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bewitched</a>, make indelible marks here); and the predatory Mrs. Robinson's business-like approach to seduction.

Complicating matters exorbitantly is Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine, played with relative nonchalance by Katharine Ross. The film then turns into a revenge comedy with Mrs. Robinson trying to prevent the inevitable coupling of Benjamin and Elaine. She almost succeeds but not before a series of revelations and dramatic encounters that lead to the classic ending aboard the public bus. Some of the comedy and characterizations seem a bit extreme, for example, Hoffman seems to amplify his character's nebbishness a few too many times, and Elaine's fiance appears like a textbook 1960's TV stereotype. There are also a few forgivable geographic gaffes - most of the campus scenes are not filmed at Berkeley as portrayed in the film but at USC, and Benjamin crosses the Bay Bridge in the wrong direction to hunt for Elaine.

The 2007 40th Anniversary Collector's Edition DVD contains two separate commentary tracks, both insightful but for different reasons - the first is an anecdotal remembrance with Hoffman and Ross quite engaged with details of the filming (Hoffman apparently had quite a crush on Ross and still does), and the second has Nichols and director Steven Soderbergh discussing all aspects of the production from casting to camera set-ups within specific scenes. The main featurette is the new 25-minute ""Students of `The Graduate'"", which amounts to an extended appreciation of the film from Henry; producer Lawrence Turman; two film scholars; various directors (Harold Ramis, Marc Forster, Valerie Faris & Jonathan Dayton, David O. Russell); and film critics (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Newsweek/dp/B00005N7RT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Newsweek</a>'s David Ansen,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Entertainment-Weekly/dp/B00005UQ61/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Entertainment Weekly</a>'s Owen Gleiberman). The second new short, ""The Seduction"", is a nine-minute retrospective look at the famous scene where Mrs. Robinson nonchalantly pounces on Benjamin. The participants from the first featurette are involved here as well, and it provides a good dissection of not only the scene but the sexual mores prevalent at the time of filming.

There are two holdovers from the 1999 DVD release. The first is the 22-minute ""'The Graduate' at 25"" produced in 1992 for the laserdisc release. It has the advantage of participation from Hoffman and Ross but otherwise echoes the information presented in the newer retrospective featurette. The second is a 22-minute interview with Hoffman done in quick takes. He lends invaluable and often amusing insight into his selection for the role and the filmmaking experience. He also talks about the proposed sequel which one can assume eventually turned into 2005's execrable&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rumor-Has-It/dp/B000EMGICS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rumor Has It...</a>. Beyond the original theatrical trailer, the DVD contains a print of the film that makes it look as good as it did in its original release. There is a bonus soundtrack sampler CD with four of the distinctive Simon and Garfunkel songs featured in the movie - ""The Sound of Silence"", ""Scarborough Fair/Canticle"", ""April Come She Will"", and of course, ""Mrs. Robinson"". Lastly, there is a helpful six-page booklet that fills in the rest of the blanks on the production. This is a great package for a classic film.",1189555200,8,6618,6.260153677277716

Ben is still traveling from Los Angeles to Berkeley on Highway 101 and by way of the upper deck of the Bay Bridge. However, he finally manages to find his way to the University.

953690,5,6305034397,"The previous reviews posted here are all based on what the reviewers HOPED would be on the new 40th Anniversary and raised some questions. I can answer most of the concerns having watched the DVD this week.

As for how important this film is, let's just say it defined a generation in the 1970s. And nearly anyone in either high school or college (or a recent ""graduate"" entering the working world) when the film was released can quote verbatim important lines and whole scenes. Try ""Are you trying to seduce me Mrs. Robinson?"" or even the mention of one word """"Plastics!"". I have only watched the film (on VHS) once since my original viewing on the big screen forty years ago. Of course I remember many of the great moments (the finale at the church, for one) and the Simon & Garfunkel soundtrack. (Dave Grusin wrote the incidental music.). I did not see the ""25th Anniversary"" reissue. So much of the supplemental material was new to me.

First off the transfer is great! It must have been remastered. And yes, it's in Wide Screen. It HAS to be. The hardest video to pan and scan was always this film as Director Mike Nichols spaced his characters at the far sides of the screen. I watched this on an 25 year old 26 in TV and it was still perfect.

Okay, now the bonus features. It's a 2 ""disc"" set because one disc is a CD of FOUR songs from the film. So it's really more of a CD single."", That's fine with me, but most of us have the music in our collection.

There are TWO commentary tracks: One is Hoffman and Ross talking. Since Ross doesn't even appear in the film until almost half way through, she has little to say for a while. And there are long periods where Hoffman says nothing so you get to hear the soundtrack dialogue at that point. The second commentary is with Director Mike Nichols and Director Stephen Soderburgh. It more that SS is interviewing Nichols. And Nichols is very outgoing here. Where I found a small problem is that the conversation often does not match what is on the screen. During the ""Seduction"" scene I expected to hear details about the set up. But Nichols was talking about Screen Tests or something else. I have not made it all the way through the commentaries. Too much other good stuff here.

There is a NEW 25-minute documentary: ""Students of the Graduate"" which has interviews with young directors who learned techniques from Nichols direction. The Directors of ""Little Miss Sunshine"" were ones I remember. It's interesting. There is a short 8-minute one on ""the Seduction"" as well. This appears to be new.

The other featurettes are from the 25th Anniversary release. One is obvious as it's title is ""The Graduate at 25"". You can see from the excerpted scenes how poor the 25th Anniversary print was. And - what I found MOST interesting was a ""One on One"" featurette with Dustin Hoffman which runs 22 minutes. It was recorded for the 25th - similar comments appear in the ""Graduate at 25"" feature - but Hoffman tells GREAT stories and I was on the floor laughing!

ONE of the tywo screen tests that Ross did - with Charles Grodin - is included in the ""at 25"" featurette but the announced ""two screen tests with introduction"" are not on the final DVD. NEITHER is the ""Coming of Age: The Making of the Graduate"" one.

So there is lots to watch here and moments to remember. I, for one, loved this set and the special featurettes - which rarely, though sometimes, repeat themselves - briefing out things you missed and make you want to playback some scenes.

This should be a hot release for September!

The Mike Nichols film has suffered through the DVD era so far, represented by a series of double-dip issues that perpetuated the same sorry source materials: grainy picture, grating audio -- the typical first-generation DVD blahs.

Here comes ""The Graduate: 40th Anniversary Edition,"" due Sept. 11. Fox's specs show 2.35:1 widescreen with DTS and Dolby Surround. This appears to be in true widescreen. (The previous DVDs' version apparently was created by throwing letterboxing atop the full-screen version. Seems the guy who was so big on plastics got into the home video business.)

Check out the new extras:

* Commentary by Dustin Hoffman and Katherine Ross
* Commentary by director Nichols and Steven Soderbergh
* Retrospective documentary that interviews ""Graduate"" write Buck Henry, producer Lawrence Turman, Richard Roeper and some random others.
* ""Coming of Age: The Making of The Graduate"" featurette
* ""Would You Like Me To Seduce You: The Seduction Scene Revisited"" featurette

Along with some odds and ends ported over from the older discs.

Disc 2 has a pleasant surprise: Simon & Garfunkle's soundtrack, in CD form.

953729,3,6305034397,"The film boosted the profile of folk-rock duo Simon and Garfunkel, whose soundtrack album (The Graduate Original Soundtrack), on the strength of the hit single ""Mrs. Robinson"", rose to the top of the charts in 1968 (knocking off The Beatles' White Album).

The theme song of the movie, ""The Sounds of Silence"" is a melodramatic, slightly mournful tune. It manages to give the movie a sort of tension, which it demonstrates in other arenas. The generational gap is one of these themes which plays out throughout the movie. The songs seem to mainly play during moments of this particular tension, such as the scene when Ben is forced into the pool by his parents in his scuba outfit. The music gives the film a certain quality, without which it would be vastly different. Simon and Garfunkel were referred to as the ""voice of a generation,"" and this is exactly what they provide in the movie for Benjamin and Elaine.

According to a Variety article by Peter Bart in the 15 May 2005 issue, Nichols had become obsessed with Simon & Garfunkel's music while shooting the film. Lawrence Turman, his producer, made a deal for Simon to write three new songs for the movie. By the time they were nearly finished editing the film, Simon had only written one new song. Nichols begged him for more but Simon, who was touring constantly, told him he didn't have the time. He did play him a few notes of a new song he had been working on; ""It's not for the movie... it's a song about times past -- about Mrs. Roosevelt and Joe DiMaggio and stuff."" Nichols advised Simon, ""It's now about Mrs. Robinson, not Mrs. Roosevelt.""

953730,5,6305034397,The Graduate is a classic. This is probably Dustin Hoffman's greatest performance.  Never have I felt for such an awkward character. The cinetamography and directing is amazing. The ending is perfect. A most buy!,1180569600,,212,5.235294117647059
953731,5,6305034397,"Without giving spoilers away, I immediately see parallels that can be drawn between Groundhog Day and The Graduate. The main characters are individuals who, in their own way, are seeking happiness. Unlike Bill Murray's character in Groundhog Day, Hoffmann's Benjamin Braddock does not have the predicament or fortune, depending on how you look at it, of facing a ""nine lives"" way of living and reliving the exact same calendar day until he gets his life squared up and in order.

In both movies, there is plenty of stumbling and bumbling and repetitive, aimless wandering reminiscent of La Dolce Vita. Braddock is faced with several obstacles in his pursuit of happiness. He has just graduated from college and is expected to get a job and live out a life that is prescribed or envisioned by his parents and nearby locals.

Though he is a bit of an egoist and an egotist, Benjamin Braddock is willing to go against the grain to sort things out in his life and determine what his underlying sources of happiness truly are. This type of searching often puts him at odds with others, in fact, practically everyone else, and perhaps rightfully so, but the viewer almost cannot help but admire the ""It ain't over 'til it's over"" perseverance that comes to define this character.

In sum, after having also read and done a review of Ayn Rand's novel, We the Living, a book about a girl who is willing to sacrifice her personal safety in pursuit of her dreams, I conclude that The Graduate is a 1960's movie adaptation of this work but in a Western society with much fewer societal perils. A great character study is truly contained in this motion picture in a way that is not quite equalled forty years after the fact.

But if you judge it from the perspective of the 60's it is.  It talks (via Benjamin) about the new generation that does not know what to do with his life and his fears.  Anne Bancroft is not the perfect looking woman, but she does have the capability and, in a certain way, the charm to seduce the young graduate.  The film tends to be a bit slow, but again that is judging it from todays stadards and it is not exactly fair.  The photography, the music and the perfomance of the cast is superb.  Lets not forget that Alfa Romeo chaged the name of the car to ""graduate"" and sold it ntil the 80s in the US mostly due to the image of the movie.

It's non-anamorphic, just like the SE, and contains the same extras that you can find on the SE, which were ported from the 25th anniversary laserdisc.

My advice to fans of this film: Try to find the original 1999 special edition DVD.",1160697600,5,445,4.855263157894737
953795,3,6305034397,"Yes, the film is a ""classic"".  That doesn't mean that it is perfect.  Far from it.  The ""classic"" aspects of it are (1) Simon and Garfunkle (I found out that ""Sounds of Silence was NOT written specially for the movie, but pre-dates it to 1966), (2)  ""Ben - I have just one word for you - PLASTICS"" , (3) Buck Henry saying ""Sir, are you here for an affair?"" (4) ""That sounds a little half-baked""---""No it is fully baked"" (5) and other quotes that I can't recall at the moment.

Having said that, as a ""social commentary"" which the film claims to be, it is a flop.  It was claimed that this was the first film to really deal with the ""generation gap"", and it is true that there is a totally breakdown in communication between Ben and his parents, but we must ask, whose  fault is this?  We must remember that Ben's parents were of the generation that grew up during the Great Depression and World War II.

That meant they had to do without a lot of material comforts that the 1960's generation took for granted.  Ben's father would have served in the military in WWII, and possibly put his life on the line in addition to living a highly regimented life for several years.

In addition, even though it is not stated explicitly, they are Jews, meaning that they most likely had to encounter anti-Semitism that only became ""politically incorrect"" when they became adults, possibly depriving them of the chance to attend the university of their choice or obtaining the most desirable job.

It was very difficult for this generation to talk about the difficulties they encountered and they most definitely wanted to shield their children from these difficulties.  It also fixated  a lot of them on ""material success"" at the expense of what earlier generations considered ""character development"", ""morality"" or ""spirituality"".

Thus, Ben comes home from University with the feeling that he is of value only if he ""performs"" or ""achieves"" to the level that his parents expect of him.  This is why his father makes the point of saying how much he paid for the scuba-diving equipment in front of his friends (""see-look how much I am willing to spend on him!"").  This shows that he does have grounds for being unhappy with his relationship with them.  In fact, in general his parents and friends (except for the Robinsons) seem to be pleasant people who genuinely like Ben. Yet, all he wants to do is run away from them, and instead he is strangely attracted Mrs Robinson who treats him in a stand-offish and exploitative manner. Even Mr Robinson goes out his way to be nice to him at first, before the truth comes out.

So  the film goes on and instead of trying to reach out and communicate with his parents, who have given him much, he turns his back on them and basically breaks off all contact.

Since the message of the film seems to be that Ben is ""right"" in rejecting everyone and everything and he apparently finds ""true happiness"" in running off with Elaine, I can only conclude that the film's

creators are giving a basically nihilistic message (in any event, why should he hit it off with Elaine whom we really don't learn much about better than with anyone else?,- she is a product of the same ""superficial, materialist"" society as everyone else he seems to have so much contempt for). Whereas, at least the film, at the beginning gives its message with some subtlety, the ending is a real incoherent mess with the way-over-the-top scenes with him fighting off everyone with a crucifix (how heavy-handed can one get with the symbolism?) and the  faces of the people at the wedding contorted with hate and anger all yelling silently at him.

953797,2,6305034397,"On Tuesday November 30, 1982 I had just come home from a scout meeting, and I turned on the television, and not knowing what was on my father got all hyper, and told me to turn it off, and I didn't even know the name of this. I looked it up in the TV Guide later on, and unfortunately, due to the fact that I was still shaken up by the other night I didn't dare share the name due to the fact I'd get a sermon. I was at a crucial age in my life where I was 15 where I had desires for girls, but emotionally I was not prepared for them. I can understand the fact that it's a morally bankrupt film, and was capturing the fact of the free-sexual revolution, but I don't see the connection considering that it was always burning since the world's been turning, but our parents put thier hands over thier ears if we were to tell them that. I guess looking back my parents argument is ""There's a time and place for everything"", but guess what that would've been a perfect time to help me understand. I know that a few months later that I brought it up to my aunt who's a committed Christian, and she paled, which led up to the sermon, and to be honest I felt like I couldn't win. I feel with this movie I had to not let it go until I got to see it because it was important for me to see it in it's entirety, and I didn't get to see this until I was 20, and I brought it back up to my parents as my father's friend had just opened a video store in Cherry Hill, NJ., and the battle started again. I have felt like a eunich I didn't get to watch this movie all this time, and when I did I found it rather appealling, and now wanted to add it to my collection I was getting flack as I actually bought the blank video, and tried to get it copied onto the videotape. Looking back I would've been better off just buying it, but I know I have to wonder if I would've come to same conclusion. I got the tape finally when I was 25 years old, and watched it once, and since then I lost the appeal. I saw it from a different light that my college professor was showing it from. I didn't focus on the colors, or the scene where Ben was looking into the goldfish bowl after being dumped by Elaine, and thrown out of a campus because of the fact that Mrs. Robinson took away Ben's virginity, and this was when Ben was trying to get together with Elaine. I found this to be coincidental, but rather truthful when I had a woman make a phone call one night when I was working in a convience store, and it was a rather seductive one, and then the woman just turned it off when I finally met her kind of like Mrs. Robinson doing it to Ben, and especially when he was in too deep. The fact that this happened could've been an alternative lesson my father could've taught me if he didn't want to talk about the sexual nature. With this mindset I don't own this anymore, and have no inclination, or intention of owning it again. I can't honestly say if I bought the tape instead of waiting for the blank copy that it would've made a difference. I feel that once I saw the fact that Mrs. Robinson made a blank promise to make Ben happy for the rest of his life it just ruined it for me. This is where the sexual revolution tone takes over as no one would've ever suspected a woman would be a seducer because men are supposed to, or it's implied that it's a man's job to have an affair, but that's the world's standard, and morally it's wrong for either side to cheat on one another. It left me feeling that I wasn't worth the time to talk about this movie to, and about the way the relationships in the movie, and made to feel dirty because I wanted to know, and angry that I had to repress myself, and my feelings, and my character to fit this model that pleased my family. I just feel that it was more worth if you are really wanting to see this movie just buy it, and not worry about your parents helping you.

953801,4,6305034397,"I can remember sitting through back to back showings of `The Graduate' in a now defunct Whittier theater when it was originally released in '67. I was a sophomore in high school at the time and as I remember there were several reasons why I put in the extra time to sit through a second viewing. One reason was to see that incredibly sexy night club stripper (Lainie Miller) perform again.  Hey, I was sixteen, raging hormones, you know the story. Anyway that was one reason. The other was because it was hilarious and there was so much laughing going on in the audience that I missed a lot of what was being said the first time. I had to see it again just to catch all the subtle jokes and comic nuances.

Of course that was '67, how does `The Graduate' fair some 39 years later? Dustin Hoffman is still delightful as the nave and somewhat awkward Benjamin Braddock, while Katherine Ross remains as lovely as ever. However with that said, I must also admit that the film appears to have lost some of the comedic charm and emotional pathos it once possessed. Maybe it's not the film, maybe with the passing of years I've simply lost my connection with that sixties angst this movie so perfectly reflects. Sadly, even the Simon & Garfunkel soundtrack that so enthralled me when I was a teenager now seems somewhat out of place and dated.

However Mrs Robinson (played by a brilliantly predatory Anne Bancroft) has other plans and is set on seducing the nave young man. When Elaine returns from college, Ben falls for her and ends his relationship with her mother. Predictably Mrs Robinson reacts with hostility and sets out to ruin both his relationship with her daughter and his life.

Simon and Garfunkle provide the music in their inimitable style and the title song, Mrs Robinson, was a huge hit for them. Director Mike Nichols managed, in this film, to capture the feel and mood of the 60's flawlessly and he deservedly won an Oscar for his work. The DVD itself has few extras, a documentary by the director, interview with Hoffman, some trailers and the usual subtitles. The picture and sound quality are good, what you would expect from the format. This is a film that has stood the test of time and is still worth watching today.",1150848000,,1347,4.635983263598327

953879,5,6305034397,"Let me begin by noting that I watched The Graduate for the second time recently, and I was delighted; I had forgotten how truly funny Hoffman's flat, dead-pan deliveries are.

I really can't speak to its place in the history of film (as I'm only 24 and am not well-versed in film history), but I can say that, in spite all that Simon and Garfunkel, The Graduate still comes across as very fresh and interesting.  I thought it did an excellent job of capturing the post-graduate mentality (partly idealistic, partly cynical, and completely lost).  I liked how the main characters were fairly fleshed out, even though the dialogue was economical.  I thought the camera work was interesting.  In particular, there are several impressive shots involving ""Mrs. Robinson.""  The first being the quick cuts to her nude torso during the initial seduction scene.  I think the flashes of her chest and sharp tan-lines are much more titillating than a lingering, full-body shot could have been.  There is also a scene, just after Hoffman's rainy-day confession, when he looks at Mrs. Robinson standing in the corner.  The camera speedily zooms back, and we see her looking very small and wasted.  I found this quite effective.  The last thing I will mention about the Graduate is the final scene ... after the almost implausible grand finale, the camera lingers on its characters for about 20 second longer than you might expect.  I think this brings the story back to reality, in a way - and makes for a simultaneously uncomfortable, open-ended and hopeful conclusion.  Anyway, I thought it was great.

Although some people apparently find The Graduate slow or dated, personally, I think it's one of the most completely excellent films I've ever seen. Of course, my recommending this film is a bit blue on black.  I mean, it's a classic, and millions of people have loved it.  You may or may not, but you certainly won't be wasting your time if you give it a go.",1149724800,3,1951,4.796407185628743
953880,1,6305034397,"Don't waste your time or your money to buy or rent this movie because it is of little value and little relevance. I watched this for the second time thinking I missed something when I watched when I was younger and it was even worse. I kept looking at the back of the DVD cover the whole time I watched the movie and tried to figure where the NY Times came up with ""funny, outrageous, and touching."" What's funny,outrageous, and touching was that once upon a time, a year before I was born, people actually thought this was a good movie. I can forgive you if you liked it back then, but grow up for heaven's sakes and admit your mistakes, fast forward to the year 2006 and you find this movie not only boring but shallow. I'd much rather be tortured with reruns of ""Footloose"" than this movie.

Ben is weak, immature, a stalker, lazy, has bad taste in woman and at 21 is unable to tell his parents no when they ask him to wear a scuba suit for their family friends. Wow! Revolutionary film-making...not!

Ben treats Elaine like crap on their first date and when Elaine asks to leave they make up and fall in love in like 30 seconds. What whiney Elaine sees in Ben is not clear in the movie and what he sees in her is not clear either. All the  parents are cartoonish (however, not even a good cartoon today would have such over the board one-dimensional characters as these were) with no depth or realism infused into their characters.

But less is made about the fact that The Graduate also stands ninth on AFI's Top 100 Comedy Films list. As I watched the film, I was aware certainly that I was watching a cinema classic, but I was taken by surprise at just how hilarious the movie is. Calder Willingham and Buck Henry's script makes it obvious that they have been paying close attention to the way people behave in middle class, academic society, and when they get it just right, it proves to be amazing how funny we naturally are. Mike Nichols' choice to stick closely to the script pays off, and he is still more than able to insert his own style into the film. The film has almost has many unforgettable images as it does quotes. Perhaps most importantly to the film's success is the brilliant cast, particularly Hoffman. His comic timing in this film earned him his well-deserved shot to stardom; his awkward scenes with the sly, mysterious Bancroft are perfect catastrophes.

How fake! How phony!! How untrue!!!

And, all the more so when you see candidate John Kerry of 2004 masquerading as a Viet Nam ware HERO while trying to relate to black folk by using phraseology like ""You know sumpin?""

That's how watching The Graduate in 2006 feels.

You know the reality of life in 2006 and the nonsense The Graduate tries to pass off as a cultural milestone looks, in retrospect, as disingenuous as John Kerry at the Senate Hearings.

In 1967, Jewish = 'liberal' and blond haired/blue eyed uptight waspy frat boys = republican.

So, in the spirit of Hollywood elitism, it's only right that the Jewish (liberal) Hoffman stole the girl away from her wasp (republican) fiance'.

That's what liberals call a 'happy ending.' lol!

And the depictions of the wasp's in this movie is so despicable, it's almost minstrel-show like.

They actually have Elaine's fiance meet her at the zoo smoking a pipe!

At the freaking zoo!

And the scene at the end  (where Benjamin has to ask the wasp's frat buddies where the wedding is) actually shows them towel-snapping!

Talk about racial stereotyping!

Of course today, Jewish people are much more likely to be conservatives (see cons, neo, David Horowitz, Dennis Prager, Dr. Laura, etc, etc, etc.) so this wouldn't work.

They'd have to present the liberals as really scientific minded rational people and the conservatives as some sort of fundamentalist nut cases. Gosh, I wonder if they've ever tried THAT in a Hollywood movie?

Bottom line: Aside from some VERY sweet cinematography (most notably aerial pans of Benjamin driving that cool little red sports car across the bridge to the strains of Simon and Garfunkle at their best) the film sucks.

It's not seminal.

It's not rebellious.

Benjamin is a whiny a-hole.

Mrs Robinson is an old lady. Not sexy, not seductive and certainly not interesting. No self-respecting young guy would be the least bit tempted to do her.

It's not about the generation gap, middle class values in atrophy or the younger generation unshackling themselves from the burdens of their parents hang-ups.

In fact, I'd venture to guess that, if Benjamin and Elaine ever did  get married, they'd be as unhappy as their parents were (until they inevitably got divorced) with the only perversely redeeming distinction that, because they would be getting high all the time...

... they'd never really notice.",1146528000,4,2596,4.96983758700696
953883,5,6305034397,"Upon returning home from four years at college, Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) is advised by his fathers law partner Mr. Robinson (Murray Hamilton) to sow his wild oats, take it easy, relax and enjoy life.  If he only knew he'd be sowing oats in Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft) he may not have been so quick to give advise.  After a dinner party thrown in the honor of his return, Benjamin escorts Mrs Robinson home only to be thrown into an affair he wasn't counting on.  Soon he becomes acustomed to the idea and actually quite comfortable with it.  You see Benjamin is trying to find himself over the summer, find out who he is and where he wants to go with his life, and with everyone around him being so fake and superficial he finds it difficult to do so.  I just love his birthday party scene.  It really shows how he is nothing like the family he was raised in nor the company they keep.  He's an awkward teenager (think Jake Gyllenhaal in Donnie Darko) who finds it hard to function in the environment he's stuck in.  But being with Mrs Robinson gives him the courage and confidence he was lacking and makes it easier for him to relax and take it easy.  And then he makes a realization.  He's being used.  When he falls for the daughter of the Robinsons, Elaine (Katherine Ross), Mrs Robinson quickly makes him aware that he is nothing but an expendable playtoy and that he's not good enough for her daughter.  The rest of the film follows Benjamin as he tries to win over Elaine's heart and eventually break up her engagment to family friend Carl Smith (Brian Avery).  This is a cult classic, a film that resulted in many other staple films of today.  It's far from a love story but more a story about the desire to be more than what others expect of you.  With brilliant performances across the board, notably by Hoffman and Bancroft, this is a staple film that should be seen by all.",1144627200,2,1897,4.442196531791907
953884,5,6305034397,"At first I thought another review for this film would be redundant, but after reading several other reviewer's comments, it seems that more needs to be said.

This film isn't truly a love story.  Instead, the love story is a thin disguise over a call for social revolution.

Like most rich people, the Braddocks and the Robinsons seem to have absolutely everything that human beings could possibly want, as long as you view them from the sidewalks that edge their front yards.

Move inside, however, and you find that the Braddocks are two of the most fluffy and superficial people the planet has ever produced.  Like reflections in a mirror, they don't seem to have any existence aside from how they appear in other's eyes.  Their son Benjamin seems to have value in their minds only as a ticket, (through his accomplishments,) to yet more external validation for them.

The Robinsons were trapped by pregnancy into a loveless, lifeless marriage that seems to be sustained mostly by bourbon, scotch and separate bedrooms.  He is a pompous ass, and she is a frustrated artist and successful narcissist who sees her daughter as competition.  Her affair with Benjamin seems to be nothing more than a cure for boredom and a way of confirming that she ""still has it.""  Yet she pursues him with the almost violent determination of a vampire.

Benjamin's interest in Elaine is nonexistent until her mother, (his lover,) absolutely forbids him to date her daughter.  Ben has been searching for a way to push against this bizarre society of 1967 Los Angeles dreamworld, and suddenly he realizes that he wants to have anything that that society (embodied in Mrs. Robinson's hypocrisy) forbids him to have.

The only thing that Benjamin and Elaine really have going for them, is that neither of them is stupid.  They both understand that this bizarre world their parents live in is a recipe for depression, alcoholism, insanity and suicide, all wrapped up in a sparkling wrapper of self-delusion, hypocrisy and fatal compromise.

When they work together at the end to break Elaine free from her arranged marriage, and get on that bus with the impish grins of children who have just played an incredible prank on their far too serious parents, they don't really even know each other.  They have no real idea where they're going, or who they plan to be.  Truth is, they don't even know if they are going to stay together.  They just know that they aren't going to live anymore according to their parents' visions of who they are.

The end of this film isn't the end of anything.  Instead, it's a call for the start of something.  It's a call for social revolution, for nonconformism, for independent thought, for a courageous rejection of an insane ""normal.""  The bus that Ben and Elaine are riding on isn't heading for the suburbs.  Ultimately, it's heading for Haight-Ashbury, for a ""be-in"" at Golden Gate Park, for one of Ken Kesey's ""Acid Tests,"" and for a large, green field on Yazgur's Farm.

Ben and Elaine's relationship is almost irrelevant to where that bus is heading.  What matters is that an entire generation is on that bus with them, and America will never be the same.",1144454400,2,3172,4.797421731123388
953885,4,6305034397,"Having seen The Graduate several times and enjoying it thoroughly, I happened to view it again recently.
However, I recognized again a few flaws and some new questions arose. Let's be clear, this film was groundbreaking and has many excellent qualities (including story, directing, creative editing, symbolism, humor, irony, etc.).  However, more than
ever a few detractors stood out.

1) Although the first half is a definite tour de force, the
second half is generally lacking and is carried on the fumes
of the reved-up first half.  Let's face it, after the humor
and intrigue of Mrs. Robinson's affair, there is a climax
when Elaine finds out (which follows their date sequence, which is neither interesting nor psychologically compelling).  After this we enter into the whole Berkeley interlude, which is also rather dull, and the storyline turns soap operaish.  Why?

2) Because the love between Ben and Elaine is, let's face it,
contrived.  Realize, they only had one date, and now they're
madly in love?  Furthermore, how does Elaine blithely dismiss
the affair and the strong psychological implications of that?
And what does this imply about the ending, when they desperately
run off together.  Doesn't it seem like a relation more doomed
than with destiny?  Also along this line is how Ben tells his parents he will marry Elaine, without consulting with her
or her parents.  I suppose this act is part of the underlying counter-culture/generation gap in sensibilities.
However, looking through today's lense, it seems more foolish than rebelish. Which leads too...

3) The movie's lack of timelessness.  Reviewing in the new millennium, much of the 60s reality that made this movie more
shocking and revelatory in its time has passed.  The editing,
film making, music, and humor that permeate the first half
are still first rate.  However, the rebelious impulse upon which the second half rely on and ultimately caps the movie
no longer work.  Let's face it, upon second and third screenings
it becomes clear that the second half is sorely lacking in ingenuity and relies strongly on a lot of questionable psychology and dubious motivation.

4) Character development. I'm just throwing this one out there,
because think about it, how well do we really know any of these characters?
All the parents are obvious stereotypes of a certain social class, maybe this can be easily accepted for the
stories' purposes.  But even Ben and Elaine, do we understand
much at all about what makes them tick, aside for the amorphous
idea that they somehow want their lives to be different than their parents staid existence.
Isn't there an onus for the story to give us better insight into their psyches?  Maybe it is all just a moral tale, and that's the excuse, but one is left
at the end with the sense that it all wasn't quite explained as well as it could be.

Overall, of course, this movie is still a clear classic, because of it's strong message and style at the time,
and the overall strength of the film.  However, I question the height of the pedestal it has been placed upon.",1141862400,4,3082,4.911196911196911

953937,1,6305034397,"I had heard a lot of things before even seeing this film, but I'd never really heard the plot so I was surprised how drawn out, and well, just pointless it all weas.  Yeah I never was interested in the Ms. Robinson/Benjamin relationship, but I had at least assumed that it would not start in the first tenth of the film.  The movie felt arduously lengthy because everything was rushed.  Now that paradox was the only problem, because in general the movie just made too little sense.

Hoffman's character for instance goes through this 'Ferris Buehler' transformation (another movie I disliked), and well where did that come from?  The first few minutes he seems happy and is smiling, and then he's upset because well he graduated college, apparently the worst thing in the world, only to still be surrounded by his rich family and friends that could, and would, support him in life.  Yes, class struggles are hard especially when you're on the top.

Oh, and Benjamin's stalker tactics with Elaine would land him in jail, and not to the ultimate end of the story (which looks more like a Pacino clip from Scarface.)

Lastly, enough about the plot and let's talk soundtrack music.  You know what?  I really love Simon and Garfunkel music, but I also like soundtracks that do not play three songs three times each.  They say this music was etched into the mind of America, and there is a reason for that!  Simply put, that is all the music you hear, and by the end of it you do not know what is worse: the constant replaying of songs, or the story component of the film.",1139011200,19,1567,4.557142857142857
953938,5,6305034397,"Maybe you have not seen ""The Graduate"" with a very young Dennis Hoffman, but you should look into making time to see it.  It is from the late 60s but a topic that many of us can relate to.  It's about a guy who just graduated from college but is worried about his future; if he'll ever be successful, what exactly will he do with his life, etc.  His parents tell him to go on a date with his neighbor, but instead, her mom tries to seduce him (many guys our age would only dream of getting seduced by an attractive, older woman) and this leads to more problems and confusion in his life.  So now Dustin's character is caught in this love triangle between the love of his life and her mother and will do anything to get his love, but doesn't want to hurt her.

The quick love story between Elaine and Benjamin just didn't seem believable or perhaps the chemistry between the actors were less believable than Mrs. Robinson and Benjamin's affair.  The best things about this film were the quirkly one-liners of Dustin Hoffman and the camera angles and cinematography of the director, which during this time period had to be ""ground-breaking"" or ""matrix-like"".  It is worth seeing one time but not a movie I could repeatedly watch.",1135555200,6,612,4.865384615384615
953942,5,6305034397,"Back before existentialism was cool, we had The Graduate.

Dustin Hoffman's breakout role is perfectly backed up by the story of a young, 21 year old man who falls in love with a young girl after having an affair with her mother.  It sounds typical soap but really goes in directions still unexpected after all these years.

The performances are powerful and affecting, even Mike Nichols'.  As the actors brace their characters against one uncomfortable scene after another, Nichols keeps the camera usually very close to Benjamin, which causes an almost subjective and first person narrative while also making the screen very claustrophobic.  And when the camera is far away from Benjamin (and he's looking at himself), he's usually blocked in by something, be it water or Anne Bancroft's (Mrs. Robinson's) legs.

Very existential, it's a film that presents a hero who finds himself constantly alone in the world, and even his convictions seem unable to pull him together.  It's not a happy movie, as the final shot of his face shows when he's riding off into the sunset that is definitely not of his dreams.

Okay.

Now that I'm done with the review proper, I thought I'd point out something interesting I discovered during my recent reviewing of this film.

Modern day ""Indie"" music is like this throwback to the acoustic folksy rock of the 60s, so of course sounds a lot like our friends Mssrs Simon and Garfunkel, who of course play the music for this wonderful movie.  Also, Hoffman's hair and dress, along with his painful awkwardness and his conflict with the people who surround him (""people of society"", so to speak), means that if this film was made today, it would be the Ultimate Indie Hipster Film.  Hell, it's practically a Garden State, only without the cheesy happy ending and even better performances.

I don't know exactly what that means, or even if it means anything at all.  It's just something really interesting about how this film looks considering contemporary culture.  It's not dated, per se, it's just that a lot of its motifs are weirdly similar to a cheesier and cheaper social subculture, even if it was made almost 40 years earlier.

Crazy how things like that work out, huh?

954018,1,6305034397,"The Graduate is one of the most appealing comedies of all time. Dustin Hoffman gives a truly spectacular performance as a young college graduate who is unsure about his future. The movie will have you on an emotional roller coaster ride that'll last forever. You'll be laughing at how Hoffman makes a fool out of himself when he's on a date with an older woman, yet crying when Hoffman finds himself trying to win back the love of his life. I really can't see why anyone would hate this film, so I would highly recommend this to anyone that likes movies.

This film DESERVES 5 stars, but I'm giving it one star, due to the fact that MGM has let us down again by giving us ANOTHER pointless re-release. That's right. This disc has the same exact transfer as the 1999 Special Edition DVD. It's non-anamorphic, just like the SE, and contains the same extras that you can find on the SE, which were ported from the 25th anniversary laserdisc.

954019,3,6305034397,"Over the past few months I've tried to expand my horizons and work my way through movies on the AFI top 100 list that I hadn't seen.  I've been blown away by ""Taxi Driver"" (#47), ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (#5), and ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest""(#20) among others.  But although ""The Graduate"" is listed as the #7 all-time great movie, it just left me wondering what all of the accolades were about.

I really enjoyed the first half of the flick, which was rife with offbeat comedy about Ben (Hoffman) as an aimless college graduate.  Despite his numerous collegiate achievements, he doesn't know what to do with his life.  Dry, offbeat hilarity ensues as his parents and their friends try to steer him into a career.  Enter Mrs. Robinson (Bancroft) and the comedy becomes a display of Ben's intense discomfort with their illicit relationship.  Up to this point, I was really impressed.

Unfortunately, when Elaine arrives on the scene and Ben falls madly in love with her, the movie takes a turn for the worse.  His desperation borders on pathetic and her acceptance of him after learning of his Oedipal affair with her mother is not credible.  As you watch their faces as they flee her wedding, you realize that this ""love"" was only for the forbidden fruit and that Ben's path in life isn't happiness but failure.

Maybe it's because I'm a child of the 80's, but the rejection of social norms and do-your-own-thing message espoused here didn't seem bold and fresh.  Just tiring.  Now go watch ""The Manchurian Candidate"" (the 1962 original - the remake is garbage).  Sinatra is awesome.",1118707200,5,1585,4.779411764705882
954020,5,6305034397,"Today the news came we were dreading to hear but which we knew was coming, that our wonderful Anne Bancroft has died, at age 73.  It is said that she came to resent the way she was remembered by the mass public only for her role in THE GRADUATE, bemoaning the fact that even her best screen work (playing Annie Sullivan in Arthur Penn's film of THE MIRACLE WORKER, for which she won the Oscar) was in its shadow.  Any real fan of Anne Bancroft can remember dozens of great performances she gave us over the fifty years she spent in show business, all the way from screaming her lungs out in GORILLA AT LARGE to her suicidal existentialist in THE SLENDER THREAD with Sidney Poitier as the psychiatrist who tries to help her.

Everyone knows that she was not the first choice to play Mrs Robinson and that Mike Nichols lobbied hard to persuade Doris Day to take the part.  Similarly, she only wound up playing the lead in John Ford's ""Eastern"" SEVEN WOMEN (his last narrative film) when Patricia Neal had her terrible stroke.  Bancroft was gallant, reliable, game for anything, and she was also extremely magnetic.  The other day we were watching THE TURNING POINT, Herbert Ross' ballet movie-slash-continual catfight, which cast her opposite the reoubtable Shirley MacLaine.  No disrespect to Miss MacLaine, but when Bancroft is on the screen, as the aging prima donna Emma Jacklin, there's no way you can take your eyes off of her.

She was memorable also in AGNES OF GOD, with Margaux Hemingway in LIPSTICK, and booklovers everywhere identified with her Helene Hanff, the American woman with a thing for London bookstores and the men who staff them, in 84 CHARING CROSS ROAD opposite Anthony Hopkins.

No matter what the part, big or small, Bancroft was always amazing, and always classy, and that's what made her such a good screen partner (and life partner) to the unapologetically vulgar Mel Brooks.  Together they formed a Hollywood relationship unlike all the others.  We mourn her death and extend our condolences to him and to their family.

Saying that, I was really dismayed and disturbed by the lack of quality of the transfer to the DVD.  The sound quality was the worst, with background noises completely drowning out the conversation (and I am careful not to include the scenes where that was intentional--there were a number of scenes on the DVD where you literally could not hear the dialogue because of wind noise, door slams, ice clinking, etc.).  There were times when the sound just blared at you, and other times you had to strain to hear, sometimes in the same scene.  Again, I know when a director is intentionally using sound to set up a scene, and I have seen this movie before, so I know what it is supposed to sound like.

954078,3,6305034397,"I was very excited to finally watch ""The Graduate,"" and indeed I found it engaging, well-paced, and well-acted...until the last half-hour.  I found this last part, starting from where Ben goes to look for Elaine at Berkeley, contrived and a real disappointment.  It's almost like two different films put together.

Think about it:  Ben suddenly starts obsessing over this girl with whom he's had a total of *one* date with, then starts exhibiting stalker-like behavior toward her.  Implausibly, this actually works on Elaine, and she starts showing interest in him.  But instead of working on things like, say, getting to know her first, he instead starts pestering her about getting married immediately!  What's his deal?  I found him very creepy and unromantic during all this, and less in love with Elaine than unhealthily obsessed with her.  As for her, she's still in college and hardly knows him.  What's she thinking?

I guess all that setup is necessary for the generational showdown at the film's climax, when Ben drags off his love from her wedding ceremony with another man.  So it looks like the young people win the battle of the generations, but what is the message there?  Is it:  you older people can try to stop me, but I'll just take whatever I want anyway?  Ben strikes me as less of an non-conforming rebel and more of a self-centered and immature brat (no baby boomer jokes here, please).

Now to be really sacrilegious:  I love the songs of Simon and Garfunkel, but except for a few places, they don't really fit the directing style nor the content of this film.  And do we really need to hear ""Sound of Silence"" three times?

There are some great things about ""The Graduate"":  the directing and editing are excellent, Bancroft is amazing (the film needs her in the third act!), Hoffman is also very good, and their scenes together are the best parts of the film.  It's also very funny in a dry, British-style of humor.  It's too bad the film's final act had to ruin it for me.

I can see how this this film was embraced by an entire generation, but as a child of the 80s, not the 60s, it doesn't really speak deeply to me.  A comparably cherished film from my generation might be ""The Breakfast Club.""  Perhaps in 20 years, my kid will watch that film and have the same reaction that I had to ""The Graduate""!",1110067200,10,2331,4.640586797066015
954079,5,6305034397,"I don't know if every generation has one particular film that defines it, but Mike Nichols' ""The Graduate"" is the one which defines mine. This masterpiece, with its themes of alienation, idealism, social consciousness, cultural and generation gaps, and the extraordinary music of Simon & Garfunkel, brings back strong and poignant memories of life in the late 1960s and early '70s. Oddly enough, the specific issues which really separated generations, the Vietnam War, Civil Rights and the Women's Movement, are not mentioned here at all. Perhaps these matters were circumvented, even as points of reference, so that the movie would not become dated, or like ""Easy Rider,"" be labeled as too revolutionary for the mainstream.

Benjamin Braddock, (superbly portrayed by Dustin Hoffman), has just graduated from college. A confused young man who is awkwardly making the transition between adolescence to adulthood, he is totally unsure of what to do with his future, let alone what to do next. As the film begins, the Braddocks are throwing a party for their son, the successful  new grad. All his parents' financially secure and affluent friends are there to celebrate. Benjamin is not one of the happy participants, however. He returns to his room as if it were the womb, and watches the aquarium. It seems as if he longs for comfort and clarity, but doesn't know how to express himself or whom to ask. He attempts to talk with his father to no avail. He will spend much of the summer like this, contemplating the tropical fish and his future - which he sure doesn't want to be ""in plastics."" I always felt that someone should have told him about the Peace Corps ...but I digress.

Benjamin is expected to enter the bland suburban Californian society that his folks move in, filled with unhappy relationships, materialistic brinkmanship, and manicured lawns. He doesn't know what he wants to do, but he definitely knows what he doesn't want. Enter the famous Mrs. Robinson, and may I say BRAVO Anne Bancroft! Bored and unfulfilled, she is married to Benjamin's father's business partner. She obviously feels that Ben can temporarily alleviate her situation when she seduces him - or attempts to. He is initially unbelieving and reluctant, but persuadable. Filled with self-loathing, he continues the affair, which only punctuates his ineptness and his emptiness.

Elaine Robinson, (Katherine Ross), daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Robinson, is about to come home from college. Benjamin is forbidden to date her, by his lover, who happens to be her mother. Talk about incestuous! Of course the now jaded Benjamin and the fresh, lovely Elaine will go out, fall in love, and you'll have to see the movie for the rest. The conclusion is brilliant.

Anne Bancroft, in her gorgeous prime, is perfect as Mrs. Robinson. She is also sad, sarcastic, manipulative, at times really b*tchy, brittle in her beauty, and vulnerable in the role. If it were real life I would have asked her what she was doing with the virginal nerd, when she could do so much better!

The film holds up so well today, not only because of the brilliant acting, direction and screenplay, but because the Graduate's problems are not dissimilar from what many youths experience now. Nichols won the Best Director award for this movie. His pacing is fluid, and his imagery metaphorical, at times chillingly so. Writers Buck Henry and Calder Willingham, (working from Charles Webb's novel), did a remarkable job with their satirical, off-beat screenplay. Simon and Garfunkel songs, including ""Scarborough Fair"" and ""The Sounds of Silence,"" give the film a wonderful lyrical tone.

A five-minute interview with Dustin Hoffman and a fascinating documentary ""The Graduate at 25"" make up the extra features on the DVD, along with a limited edition 64-page book with production notes and a collection of articles and reviews from the original theatrical release.

I remember watching ""The Graduate"" for the first time in 1968, and really relating. What can I say? I was young! Naive as this may sound, I did identify with the feelings stirred by the movie and performances. I still do, very much...no matter how retro. Now after almost 40 years, this is a classic!

954080,5,6305034397,"Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) returns home from what most would consider a triumphant college experience.  Head of the debating club, captain of track team, editor of the school paper and award-winning scholar, Ben creates envy in all his parents' friends, as none of them can imagine the angst and directionlessness that overwhelm him.  Ben perfectly captures the zeitgeist of the late 1960s; it is no coincidence that he comes along at a time when the youth of America were searching for answers and questioning the world of their elders.  The goals of his parents' social circle are not his goals.  Their dreams, not his.  Ben is not eager to make decisions that will map out the rest of his life, and is certainly not ready to jump into an exiting career in ""plastics"".

He is also not ready to jump into an affair with Mrs. Robinson, wife of Ben's father's longtime partner.  But Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft) has other plans.  In a comically uncomfortable wooing, the middle-aged temptress toys with young Ben, making obvious passes and then feigning shock when Ben responds to her advances.  Ben's confusion - heightened by an old-fashion respect for elders - culminates when he laughingly says, ""Mrs. Robinson, you're trying to seduce me,"" and with a puzzled look, then asks, ""Aren't you?""

While the romance between Benjamin and Mrs. Robinson occupies an unequaled spot in American popular culture, it only establishes the real conflict of the film (the turmoil that develops when Benjamin falls for Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine).  The latter half of the film sees Ben find the direction he lacks in the lost, lazy days that originally guided him toward Mrs. Robinson.  He sees in her daughter the dreams and desires he so needs.  As his past trysts with the elder socialite come to haunt him, Benjamin finds himself trapped between his hopes for the future and the actions of his past.

Watching ""The Graduate"" for the first time creates in a viewer a series of ""oh, that's where that came from"" moments, similar to reading ""Hamlet"" or watching ""The Wizard of Oz"" or ""The Godfather"".  ""The Graduate"" forever altered the collective language and experience of our culture, and neophytes to the film will be shocked at how much of it they have already seen elsewhere (not just the content of the plot, but also the framing of shots, tricky editing, and the music of Simon & Garfunkel).",1103414400,6,2401,4.893827160493827
954081,5,6305034397,"This is an accomplished film for someone directing only his second film. But then again, judging from his subsequent work all the way to ""Angels in America"" and ""Closer"", Mike Nichols seems to have come into filmmaking fully understanding the frailties of the human condition and knowing how to convey them in a way that audiences could empathize. ""The Graduate"" is one of those films that gravitates effortlessly to its audience even now, the aging Vietnam War-era population who championed anarchy and the people who revise their personal histories so they can think they were members of the now-fashionable counter-cultural movement. It is a testament to Nichols and screenwriters Buck Henry and Calder Willingham that the social comedy aspects of this film do not seem at all dated. In fact, despite its provocative veneer, it's really old-fashioned in key ways from the hero's moralistic tendencies to his romantically compulsive motivations toward the end.

Dustin Hoffman was pulled out of complete obscurity to play Benjamin, the alienated, recent college graduate drifting amid his parents' Southern California upper middle class, swimming pool-centered ennui. As he figures out what to do with his life and faces unwanted advice from his parents' friends, enter Mrs. Robinson, a bored, restless wife, a self-proclaimed alcoholic and about as sympathetic as Lady Macbeth. It's hard to imagine what the original choice, Doris Day, would have done with this role, as it takes Anne Bancroft's formidable arsenal of skills to bring this vituperative woman to life. She gives a masterful performance. The hotel sequence where Benjamin awkwardly asks Mrs. Robinson for a drink is sharply observed and hilarious - the suspicious hotel clerk  (Henry, the film's co-screenwriter) eyeing Benjamin's every move; the reception line which Benjamin pretends to know (watch for TV veterans Alice Ghostley and Marion Lorne - Aunt Clara of ""Bewitched"" - make indelible marks here); and just the predatory Mrs. Robinson's business-like approach to seduction.  Complicating matters exorbitantly is Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine, played with relative nonchalance by Katharine Ross. The film then turns into a revenge comedy with Mrs. Robinson trying to prevent the inevitable coupling of Benjamin and Elaine. She almost succeeds but not before a series of revelations and dramatic encounters that lead to the classic ending aboard the public bus. Some of the comedy and characterizations do seem a bit extreme, for example, Hoffman seems to amplify his character's nebbishness a few too many times, Elaine's fiance appears like a textbook 1960's TV stereotype. There are also geographic gaffes which are obvious to me since I am a Berkeley alum and a San Francisco Bay Area native: the campus scenes are most certainly not filmed at Berkeley but at USC, Benjamin crosses the Bay Bridge in the wrong direction to hunt for Elaine. But these lapses are forgivable in light of Nichols' expert direction; the witty, observant script; and Simon and Garfunkel's distinctively dulcet tones.  Strongly recommended after all these years.",1103328000,3,3119,5.359183673469388

Mrs Robinson is a family friend with an attractive daughter (katherine Ross) whom Hoffman eventually goes after, much to the disapproval of Mrs Robinson.

Blessed with a beautiful Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack, this film is basically fun to watch from start to finish.

954176,5,6305034397,"Some of the themes of ""The Graduate"" are dated by today's standards but it remains a very funny film.  The story involves a recent graduate, Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman), who has little or no direction in life who stumbles into an affair with his father's business partner's wife, Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft).  When not going off for his trysts with Mrs. Robinson he spends his time lolling in his parents pool.  After breaking off his affair with Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin turns his attention to wooing her daughter, Elaine(Katherine Ross), much to the consternation of his elders.  When ""The Graduate"" was released in 1967 it was considered to be a landmark in American film-making.  It was the boomers making a statement about their exploitation by their elders.  Now that the boomers have become the establishment, these sentiments would be amusing to any succeeding generation.  What remains are some very funny bits mostly involving Benjamin's awkward encounters with the worldly, seductive Mrs. Robinson.  There's also some funny moments involving Benjamin's frantic pursuit of Elaine, particularly after she finds out about his affair with her mother.  Hoffman makes a terrific debut as Benjamin. Bancroft imbues complexity in a character that could have been one-note, particularly in the scenes after the affair where the demands of the story make her seem shrewish.  Ross is pretty and adequate as Elaine.  There are alot of great scenes involving character actors including Murray Hamilton (""I think you're scum!""), Norman Fell(""You're not one of those outside agitators?"") and others.  Look fast for Richard Dreyfus(""Should I get the cops?"") and co-scripter, Buck Henry(""Good evening, Mr. Gladstone."").  Praise goes out to director Mike Nichols and screenwriters Henry and Calder Willingham.  Lastly, you cannot review this film without mentioning the now classic song score by Simon and Garfunkel.

954177,5,6305034397,"The Graduate is a great film on so many different levels.  True it's not the typical story told in the most believable way.  But the movie is about more than this one young man, and it's about more than just the 60s.  It's about an entire generation in the middle of changing.  This movie captures the chaos that is change.

This is not necessarily the lighthearted funny movie, nor is it the carefully scripted drama.  It's a mix of the absurd with the all too real.  In the end, every thing has a place in this movie. Many of the elements seem more suitable for an avant-garde film project than a major motion picture release.  But for those who love experimentation in movies, as well as good stories being told on screen, there is MUCH to appreciate here.

The acting performances by Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft and Katherine Ross are all stellar, and the music of Simon and Garfunkel is molded to fit every scene perfectly. True, a lot has been said about these things. Still, they are so good that one cannot say enough about them.  Hoffman and Bancroft in particular truly do give performances of their lifetimes.  It's not easy to capture the angst of a confused and needy boy in the middle of becoming a man.  It's not easy to capture the cold calculation of a woman who wants nothing more than for once to get what she really wants.  On both fronts, mission accomplished. And the music is one of the best scores written for a film ever.

The cinematography is some of the most interesting ever.  Studying it could be the sole focus of an entire graduate film program, and they still not might be able to cover it in its entirety.  It's hard to describe the power of scenes like after Hoffman reveals to his girlfriend that her mother was the woman he was with.  As he walks away defeated, the camera pans out and the look in Mrs. Robinson's eyes says she knows she's been defeated too.  ""Goodbye Benjamin,"" she says coldly.  It's just one example of truly pivotal work in the history of film-making.  Like Citizen Kane, this movie is a giant of visual arts.

Some comentators more knowledgable than I have noted technical weaknesses in the video transfer and screen definition of the film.

The plot itself is not so original (young man has an affair with older married woman), however the movie is done in such an artistic way that the affair itself is put in the backseat for most of the film. If this movie were to be remade today, it would have been very sexualy charged and raunchy will the majority of the content focusing on the actual affair itself. However because this movie was made during a time when true quality and craftsmanship was appreciated, the themes are delicate and subtle. It really makes you use your imagination and look deeper into the storyline, rather than just the obvious. The backdrop (Southern & Northern California), the wonderful musical score (Simon & Garfunkel) and great cast made this movie very worthwhile to see as well. If you enjoy movies made with thought and care behind it, you should definitely check this one out!",1076630400,4,955,4.65680473372781
954181,5,6305034397,"The DVD version of this movie will delight true fans because it contains lenghty interviews with the stars Dustin Hoffman and Katharine Ross, and screenwriter Buck Henry.  They recount the making of the movie, the critical decisions that Mike Nichols made and most of all they reminiessed about making the movie itself.
I have watched this movie many many times and has not grown tired of it, if any, I have grown to apprreciate  it even more.  I think it has an enduring quality because it is a well made movie and as some reviewers have pointed out, we can all relate to Ben Braddock's lost, lonely and indecisive phase in our youths no matter if it was in a lesser or greater degree.  And folks, let's face, the soundtrack is a Bomb.
The movie is also an excercise in style and technique, although according to Henry, some came by accident as the actors and the director sort of fumbled around when they didn't know quite how to create a certain scene.  I love the part when Dustin Hoffman eagerly kisses Anne Bancroft with smoke still in her mouth.
Some reviewers complained that this movie didn't reflect the turbulent times and places that was happening then.  But in a way doesn't Ben's own ambivalence towards his future and his ultimate courage to go against all odds and fight for what he wants reflect this?  To lodge this particular complaint about this movie is really missing the point.

This movie will last and will appeal  to any generation.  I first saw this movie in junior high back in the early 80's and I thought what a neat movie it was.  I was mostly impress by the cinematography and I loved the neat ending, but as you watched the movie with age, you grow to appreciate it in different levels, that's why I think this movie will endure many generations of movie lovers and DVD collectors.
Get the DVD, it will make a nice addition to your collection and when you're feeling reflective on a nice gloomy day, pop it on and enjoy.",1070668800,6,1953,4.535612535612535

Mike Nichols directed this film that highlights all that was good and bad about the 60s.
Who among us will forget Hoffman standing at the bottom of the swimming pool in scuba gear during the party at which one of his father's business friends has just poked him repeatedly on the chest and said, ""I have one word for you, Benjamin. Plastics.""

954183,5,6305034397,"This is one of the defining films of my generation, and of course I saw it when it came out in 1967.  Seeing it again after all these years I was struck by both how funny it is and by the brittle, cynical and brilliant performance by Anne Bancroft as Mrs. Robinson.  She is flawless in a part that might easily lend itself to overacting.  Instead she is subtle, controlled, focused, and authentic in a way that is both sexy and chilling with just a hint of ironic humor.  The maternal way she has with the virginal Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman in a breakout role) emphasizes the creepy, almost incestuous nature of their sterile affair.
Mike Nichols has directed a number of sexual/relationship comedies, including Carnal Knowledge (1971), Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966), Nora Ephron's Heartburn (1986) and Carrie Fisher's Postcards from the Edge (1990).  Nichols's films typically feature talented and charismatic actors and actresses who explore in a deceptively humorous manner the dark side of human nature.  The humor usually has an edgy quality while the taboo elements are somehow resolved into happy endings as in a musical comedy.  Nichols likes to work with material from another medium and make it his own.  Typically, The Graduate is adapted from the novel by Charles Webb.  Nichols also likes to feature cutting edge popular music in the score.  What we hear in the background and played over the opening credits is Simon and Garfunkel's ""Sounds of Silence.""  Of course Paul Simon wrote the song ""Mrs. Robinson"" for this movie, but what I didn't realized until now is his ""It's all happening at the zoo"" was probably inspired in part by the zoo scene in this film.
Dustin Hoffman's confused and drifting Benjamin, worried about his future and suffocated by his parents' generation, knocked everybody out in those days with his dead-panned, literal delivery of one-liners, some of which were written by Buck Henry, who plays the desk clerk at the rendezvous hotel.  I especially loved Ben's answer when his father, enquiring about his Quixotic plan to marry Mrs. Robinson's daughter Elaine (Katharine Ross), asks, ""Isn't this a half-baked idea?""  In dead seriousness, Benjamin says, ""No, sir.  It's completely baked.""
Memorable is Norman Fell (whom most of us recall from TV's long-running comedy, Three's Company) in a small part as the landlord of the Berkeley rooming house.  He is of course a past master at dead-panning one-liners; in fact, he is a master at mute dead-panning.  One of the funniest bits in the movie is when the camera catches his face as Elaine's father comes out of Ben's room spewing obscenities and insults at Ben.
What we loved about this movie was the youthful point of view; the wonderful chase scene at the end, a Hollywood staple made fresh; the sympathetic character of Benjamin with whom we could readily identify; the cliche-ridden and shallow parents being slyly made fun of; and the sense of getting what we want out of life and doing it our own way.  This is a coming-of-ager and a romance and a social satire rolled into one, and a classic Hollywood movie that no afficionado would want to miss.
But see this for Anne Bancroft, a brilliant and perhaps underrated actress in one of her most memorable roles.",1069718400,5,3269,4.903811252268603
954184,4,6305034397,"The movie ""The Graduate"" is a story that focuses on the life of Ben Braddock after his college graduation. The narrative takes you through evolutions in his life. He starts off by ""dating"" Mrs. Robinson who is a friend of his parents. He does this mainly because Mrs. Robinson tells him what to do and how to do it. She gives him a constant that he doesn't have to change or make decisions on. Mrs. Robinson is always in control and though she lets him think that he has the control she manipulates him. Despite Mrs. Robinson's wishes Ben starts to date Elaine and ends up falling for her which angers her mother. Mrs. Robinson doesn't think that Ben is good enough for Elaine and threatens to tell Elaine about their relationship if his liaison with Elaine continues. Because of this Ben tells Elaine and she is angry with him and her mother. She returns to Berkeley and after being pursued by Ben tells him that he mother told her that Ben had raped her. After discussion Elaine comes to realize that she has feelings for Ben and he didn't rape her mother. Elaine then decides that she might marry Ben. However, Mr. Robinson comes to Berkeley and tells Ben to stay away from his daughter. Elaine then leaves in the middle of the night to get married to some guy. Ben hunts them down and gets there after the wedding is over. Nevertheless, Elaine and Ben run out of the church and catch a bus. The closing seen shows their smiles fading and unhappiness settling in.
 The relationships between the people are unrealistic. Especially the one between Elaine and Ben. In the beginning it's realistic because Elaine doesn't know about Ben's relationship to her mother. However, after Elaine learns about there relationship it makes no sense that she wants to talk to him let alone marry him. The story has them forgive and forget. He had an affair with her mother and ruined her parent's marriage and she ran away from her wedding to be with him. It doesn't make sense.
 And the relationship between Ben and Mrs. Robinson...it's more realistic than his relationship with Elaine but is still makes no sense. Ben has just graduated from college and he gets into a relationship with a woman 20-30 yrs his senior. Again, it's strange.
 The movie was very well done, however. The lighting and film shots add a certain feeling to the film. Also the music brought you in deeper. They give you a sense of hope and a strange sense of despair all at the same time. The songs fit wonderfully with the narrative. Casting was well done. However, Dustin Hoffman looked many years older than his counter part Katherine Ross. All in all it was an awesome movie. I recommend it to anyone.",1069632000,3,2667,4.598739495798319

Two days ago I went on a pilgrimage to find it and finally conquer this darn movie once and for all.  And I must say, I love it from top to bottom.
Of course, the first thing that everyone mentions is the amazing soundtrack.  I honestly don't think this movie would be the same without it.  I have a newfound appreciation for Simon and Garfunkel.
The cinematography is really what caught my eye.  The shot at the beginning when Ben is just lying there, and the camera doesn't move as his parents walk in....it's a small detail, but it's outstanding.  The whole ""Sound of Silence"" sequence which transitions Ben from the pool, his hotel room with Mrs. Robinson, and his room at home....WOW.
The acting is superb and the dialogue is wonderful.  (A FORD!  How great!) The plot and believability leave a little to be desired.

954248,5,6305034397,"It took all my life for me to see THE GRADUATE, but I'm glad I finally did!  Everybody is a Benjamin Braddock at some point in life.  Here we have an intelligent, introspective young man, fresh out of college, who wants nothing more than to lounge in his parents' pool and reflect upon his future, a slacker three decades before that term was coined.  But those in his life try to pull him into different directions and attempt to make decisions for him.  His parents are hell bent on his going to grad school; a colleague of his father's insists he seek out a career in the plastics industry; and, most forcibly of all, Mrs. Robinson coerces him to initiate an affair with her. THE GRADUATE is more a story of one person versus a domineering society than anything else.  At every turn, Ben attempts to right all the wrongs and potential wrongs, only to have his efforts backfire badly on him.  What he wants most is what eludes him, forcing him to wrest it from that domineering society. The film is very effective in underscoring mundane actions -- climbing slowly out of a swimming pool, driving across a bridge, peering at monkeys in a zoo -- with Simon and Garfunkel's excellent music.",1060041600,5,1190,4.563380281690141
954249,4,6305034397,"The film The Graduate is a classic 1967 release that is directed by Mike Nichols and released by Embassy Pictures.  The film earned $50 million in 1968, which is number one money maker in that time.
  Director, Nichols, won the Academy Award for Best Director.  The film was also nominated for 6 other Awards, Best Picture, Best Actor and Actress, and Best Supporting Actress.

954250,2,6305034397,"The attention this movie receives is just not deserved. Dustin Hoffman's casting is often described as ""perfect"" - but it is actually a distraction. His character is supposed to be physically but not intellectually impressive (the book on which the movie is based describes the character as resembling a surfboard). His physical appeal is the only reason Mrs. Robinson dallies with him - he's a boy-toy she doesn't respect. But Hoffman just isn't physically impressive - so there is nothing motivating the relationship. His acting is also too nervous and wirey for the part - it suggests an obvious potential danger in his character, putting it far from the malleable and then disposable stud Mrs. R desires. Similarly, the Hoffman character breaks up Robinson's daughter's wedding when she foolishly gives into his surface appeal - just as her mother did.
Essentially all motivating structure is lost in the movie. The Hoffman character is supposed to be motivated to steal the bride by his juvenile male competition with her studly husband-to-be. But Hoffman plays the role in a way that forecloses any real motivation for this bizarre act. The destruction of the wedding is presented as a confused way of breaking up the afternoon's boredom. In short, the script is a flashy mess.
It is true that the film's fancy camerawork and the sophomoric, pseudo-ironic Simon & Garfunkel music brilliantly conceal the incoherence of the story. The film contributed those techniques - which are so valuable to today's Hollywood director. The director also made lemonade of the lack of structure by using it to enhance the film's atmosphere of a bad dream. The film deserved to be a commercial success. Even after all these years, it may even worth the time needed to see it - if you're stuck in a foggy city with no friends in town.
But a great movie? Please. That's like calling one's first smash-and-grope of your girlfriend's breasts in the neighbor's basement a ""great romance.""",1058227200,16,1973,5.0
954251,5,6305034397,"As I think about this film,  I am again struck by the fact that films never change, only we do over a period of time (in this instance decades) from the first time we see a film until we most recently see it again. I admire this film as much now as I did in 1967 but for different reasons. Much younger then, of course, I was totally sympathetic with Benjamin (Dustin Hoffman) and drew parallels between him and Salinger's Holden Caulfield. Today, I really do not identify with any character in the film even as I appreciate more than before the multi-dimensional social commentary which Mike Nichols makes on that era. In a word, ""plastic."" I consider it both significant and revealing that neither Benjamin's parents nor Elaine Robinson's parents are given first names. Elaine is perfectly portrayed by Katherine Ross, in stunning contrast to Brenda Patimkin played by Ali MacGraw two years later in Goodbye, Columbus. Nichols also integrates seamlessly the script co-authored by Calder Willingham and Buck Henry with the music score (Simon and Garfunkel) and Robert Surtees' cinematography. Also, he selected and coordinated brief but brilliant appearances by Norman Fell (Mr. McLeeiry), Alice Ghostley (Mrs. Singleton), Marion Lorne of ""Mr. Peepers"" fame (Miss DeWitt), and Henry (Hotel Clerk). I even spotted Richard Dreyfuss among the hotel guests. Nichols' brilliant work in his film earned for him an Academy Award as best director.
The comic moments are memorable (some indelible) but the humor is essentially bittersweet, as is the humor Nichols created with his former associate Elaine May. How easy to overlook the fact that the film portrays adultery, a relationship which betrays so many others. Also, that the predatory Mrs. Robinson's need for sexual gratification exploits so callously Benjamin's vulnerability as he struggles to decide what to do with his life after graduation from college. For me, the film's title is ironic because, even with his diploma in hand, Benjamin must complete other rites of passage and almost (not quite) loses the decent and uncorrupted young woman he truly loves. As the film ends, he and Elaine sit together at the back of a public bus, staring ahead without apparent emotion at a future which, for them, is assuredly uncertain. Once again, Benjamin must address a question posed earlier, ""Now what?""
It remains for cultural anthropologists to comment on this film's sociological significance. As indicated previously, I think so highly of this film because Nichols has brilliantly combined and integrated just about everything a great film requires: a compelling story, great acting and cinematography, memorable (and appropriate) music, and effective use of humor. Many people believe that this film offers a ""window"" to upper-middle class suburban America in the 1960s. Probably it does. But I think it will also continue to be appreciated because it examines certain themes which have defined human experience for several thousand years: the struggle for wisdom, the sometimes necessary loss of innocence, and the transcending power of the human heart.",1057968000,5,3108,5.228456913827655
954252,4,6305034397,"This is a very good movie made in a time where movies were just starting to broach *unseemly* topics.  For me it seems a bit dated now.  Not the music which is timeless...  or the topic which is timeless as well.  I think that there is alot of visual symbolism in this movie that was cutting edge at the time that seems a bit weary(Zooming out from mrs robinson leaving her to look small, old and a bit haggard...  candle-stick shadows on the wall that look a bit sexual)
The pot-shots its takes at the superficial nature of how *adults* deal with young people are priceless...How the parents, well all the adults view the main character, Benjamin. As someone to be molded (PLASTICS!), to be guided, to not see as a total human being.  No adult in this film sees Benjamin as a total person.  Even Mrs Robinson who has, perhaps the best opportunity wants no part of the whole package.
This is a must-see at least once.  From the classic line ""PLASTICS!""  to the end where he is in the church yelling ""ELAINE!"" looking all but crusified this is an important and at times very entertaining film.",1055462400,2,1092,4.474747474747475
954253,5,6305034397,"The Graduate is a great film and I grow to love it more with each viewing. Everything is nearly perfect about it. The script, Mike Nichols' direction, the performances of Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft and Katherine Ross, the music of Simon and Garfunkel. It's funny yet dramatic, moving and profound all at the same time. A very enjoyable film all around. Dustin Hoffman has rarely been better than in The Graduate, although he has certainly given many other fine performances (Midnight Cowboy, Rain Man, Kramer Vs. Kramer). However, even more than those pictures, Hoffman will always be remembered for The Graduate and his portrayal of an awkward young man trying to get a hold on his life.
Also worth noting in particular is the direction of Mike Nichols. He truly gives the film a unique visual style to make it an experience rather than just a comedy/drama. Note the opening credits with Hoffman on an airport moving sidewalk set to the tune of Simon and Garfunkel's ""The Sound of Silence"". Nichols' uses cuts very interestingly in several scenes such as the scene where Benjamin jumps up on his raft in the pool, and lands in bed with Mrs. Robinson. He also uses zooms to great effect throughout the film. Nichols' Best Director Oscar for this film was well-deserved. I think that Hoffman's performance should have won also, as well as the screenplay by Calder Willingham and Buck Henry.
One other thing that I must mention is that The Graduate absolutely must been seen in its original aspect ratio! If you're not watching a widescreen version, then you're not watching The Graduate. The film was shot in the Panavision process with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1. Mike Nichols makes wonderful use of the 2.35:1 frame, so the film will be absolutely botched in pan and scan. If you watch The Graduate in full-screen pan and scan, you're really, really missing out. The visual impact of the film will be irreparably damaged.
The DVD is adequate, but this film deserves much better. The disc is labeled a special edition, but it's really too skimpy to be that. At very least you're getting a widescreen version of the film. However, the transfer is not enhanced for 16:9 televisions. What we need is a fully remastered 16:9 transfer which would be immensely beneficial. The picture quality is fair, but could be so much better. It's really stunning what difference a brand new remastered 16:9 transfer can make for an older film like this. Just look at the new DVD of One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest. The film also deserves better supplemental materials. A better documentary and a commentary by the filmmakers would be great. A seperate commentary by Dustin Hoffman would be even better. I'm convinced that someday The Graduate will receive a worthy DVD edition, and I will wait until then to purchase it.",1050710400,188,2805,4.821576763485477
954254,5,6305034397,"Everyone born in America since 1967 has by now seen or heard at least something from this movie; it has been raved about, played on TV, and spoofed, seemingly millions of times. Upon viewing the movie, it is easy to see why it is so endearing.
Hoffman plays a young man who just graduated from college, confused about life and trapped in his wealthy parent's California home and lifestyle. Along comes Anne Bancroft as the much older wife of Hoffman's father's partner, who makes an attempt to seduce him, which he hastily refuses. After some reflection, however, he happily decides to proceed with the somewhat torrid affair. A problem arises when the wife's daughter arives in town and Hoffman may find himself in love.....
The Graduate is a great blend of comic timing and drama. The sountrack by Simon and Garfunkle is arguably the best use of a soundtrack by any movie, with music that captures the boredom and repitition and torridness of the affair, and subsequent wild passion, seemingly much better than any dialouge could. Hoffman and Bancroft are irreplaceable in their respective roles, with many people still claiming to relate to Hoffman's character even though they've never been in a similar situation.

It contained nothing else of the philosophic, political, or styleistic revolution erupting all around me. True, it was an indictment of the moral and cultural vacuum of capitalistic conformity carried over from the fifties, but such an indictment does not in itself make a canonical sixties film. Watching this movie (on DVD) for the first time since I saw it in 1968 only reinforced my original luke warm impression. That even a seriously gin-soaked Mrs. Robinson would waste her considerable seductive talents on a big nosed dork fresh out of college seems even more improbable to me now then it did in 1968. The reaffirmation of true love won over by relentless stalking is still nauseatingly Hollywood formula trite. True, the acting is impressive, but in the final analysis can't really carry the premises or the overwrought pretentions to serious social commentary.",1048896000,5,1021,4.976608187134503

The film was unlike anything the 60's had ever seen, ahead of its time, bleak, realistic. It portrayed a dismal aspect of non-comformity, the breaking of traditional familie values, in much the same way the recent ""American Beauty"" portrayed sub-urban America. The film is most famous for the scene in which Mrs. Robinson seduces the young Hoffman (Mrs. Robinson, I think you are trying to seduce me). The affair was scandalous. Not only was she a much older woman, but the mother of her daughter's fiance. The soundtrack was composed by Simon and Gurfunkel, whose song ""Mrs. Robinson"" was an instant hit and earned them lasting fame. Including also in the film is the symbolic, melancholy ""Sounds Of Silence"".
Well-written screenplay, powerful and impressive performances by all the actors, great music, some comedy, irony, realism- this film could have well defined the decadence of the 60's era, a time when ""free"" love was becoming an established idea, when the seedy, steamy underbelly of suburbia was being excavated. An adult film, it should only be viewed by understanding adults, and not impressionable youth who can get the idea that they can follow in the muddy footsteps of Dustin Hoffman's character.",1046995200,7,1373,5.1891891891891895

No ambition, no energy, no creativity, no initiative, just a sluggish crock of complacency due to a total absence of challenge while growing up.

Mrs. Robinson also had the added bonus of being especially hateful without any specific motivation.  Benjamin was not just too polite to tell her to get lost - he was spineless.  A vindictive bat and a jellyfish... how did this seem like a good idea?  Katherine Ross looks lovely as Elaine, but she's barely one-dimensional.  Maybe if Ben had been trying to get back at Mrs. Robinson, his interest in Elaine would have made some kind of sense.  As it is, it seems like some third grade infatuation with the girl next door.  Grow up, Ben...
The movie spirals from bad to worse after Ben goes to whatever college (Berkeley?) to ""marry"" Elaine.  The events go from being contrived to nonsensical.  How did Elaine and later her father find the house where Ben lived?  Why did ANYBODY believe Mrs. Robinson as much as she lied and manipulated?  And my favorite, why did Ben let his car run out of gas when he had just been at a gas station?  I know why, because some writer thinks it would be funny if he ran to the church instead of drove.  As for the ending... well, I was so glad the movie was over, I kinda liked it.  Maybe because it reminded me of an episode on ""The Simpsons"".
Had I been alive in 1967... I probably still wouldn't have liked it.  I might have understood the context better.  This movie is really bad, and I hope it is a blip on the screen in the judgment of the voters for the AFI Top 100 list.  Vote ""Not Helpful"" if you wish, but I'm usually positive about films in general.  I just didn't like ""The Graduate"".",1043884800,34,2122,4.412371134020619
954338,5,6305034397,"In the end, The Graduate is a film about the search for true happiness and the stress that comes along with it. The film's hero, Benjamin Braddock is fresh out of colledge and has no clue about what to do with his life. At his own Graduation party he is approached by a woman who is twice his age named Mrs. Robbinson. She's a friend of the families and asks Benjamin if she could get a ride home in his new car. He dosen't want to at first but is soon forced into by Mrs. Robbinson. When they get to her house, Benjamin goes in for a drink. Soon, Mrs. Robbinson attempts to seduce Benjamin by stripping naked infront of him. Thus begins The Graduate.
 This is a wonderful film with superb performances from all the players. Dustin Hoffman is great as an immature annoying geek Benjamin, Anne Bancroft exellent as the sexy yet bad tempered Mrs. Robbinson and Katherin Ross is very sweet as Elaine Robbinson, who is basicaly the only sane character in the film.
 Buck Henry and Calder Willingham provide a very tight script that hardly ever get's away from it's intatinoal purpose. Mike Nichols, a wonderful comic director, does some great camera angels. He's an actors director and it defiently shows.
 The Simon and Garfunkle soundtrack is featured when the film shows it's montages. It's fits perfecty with the movie and Benjamin's state of mind.
 Some complain that The Graduate has lost some of it's original shock and I agree, but you know what? I love it. It's a film I can go back to many times and still enjoy. Maybe you will too.",1041984000,,1538,4.5215827338129495
954339,5,6305034397,"This movie is not quite as exciting as it was when many of us first saw it in 1967, but it's still well worth seeing again and again. Anne Bancroft is perfect as the seducing older married woman, and Dustin Hoffman in his first staring role is every bit the hesitant, mumbling seductee-- if that's a word-- and looks all of 18 although I believe he was actually 30 when he made this movie.
It's easy to see that the director Mike Nichols came to movies from the stage. Particularly effective is his use of repeated images to give the movie form-- the scenes with stockings, the swimming pool, the aquarium, for instance. And ""plastics"" and ""wood or wire"" have become a part of our national vocabulary. (Nichols does however, hit you over the head with  his imagery when Hoffman grabs that cross near the end of the movie.)
One final thing: while I love the music of Paul Simon, with the exception of ""Mrs. Robinson,"" I didn't understand what those other great songs had to do with the theme of this movie in 1967 and I don't know now. Nevertheless, everyone should see this movie at least once to know what the 60's were all about.",1041465600,2,1131,4.463768115942029

Hoffman (Oscar-nominated) stars as Benjamin ""Ben"" Braddock, a young man, who just got home from college and is confused about what he is going to do in the future. Mrs. Robinson, played by Anne Bancroft (Oscar-nominated), seduces Braddock and wants him to have an affair with her. But, later, Braddock falls in love with Robinson's daughter, Elaine (Katharine Ross, in her Oscar-nominated role), instead. Mike Nichols won the Oscar for Best Director, but the fact is that this movie lost the Best Picture Oscar to ""In The Heat Of The Night"" in 1967 is probably a big disappointment just like ""Raging Bull"" lost to ""Ordinary People"" in 1980.

The acting by all is top-notch. The chemistry/tension between Benjamin and Mrs. Robinson is absolutely amazing. Ben encapsulates in his character what almost everyone has felt at that point in their lives - the lack of direction, the loneliness, confusion,etc. I also like the fact that the end is not a pretty, happy-ever-after kind of thing. Although he does get the girl, the expressions on their faces betray a bit of insecurity and uneasiness. I found that to be very realistic. Such is life. It is rarely 100% good. An astounding piece of work. Yes, it is old, and those weaned on Adam Sandler movies will find it slow and uninteresting, missing the finer points of true acting and great directing at its finest. Classic.",1040860800,,899,4.8441558441558445
954342,5,6305034397,"This is probably my very favorite movie. And if you've read any of my other reviews, you're saying, ""Oh, yeah, cuz she's obsessed with Simon and Garfunkel."" Well, I must admit that I first saw it for the outstanding soundtrack (which really is reason enough), but the movie itself exceeded all my exprectations. It's perfect: unconventional, darkly funny, honest, odd, with the perfect music and about a million lines that are regularly quoted at my home. (""No, it's completely baked."") Darn it, you could even say it's touching. But not in a smushy-mushy sort of way.
  Anyway, there's really no need to go over the plot here, you probably know it: Grad student Benjamin gets sucked into Mrs. Robinson's web of sin, regrets it, falls for the daughter, gets everyone pissed off at him, but persists and--oh no I won't ruin the ending. But it's awesome, the best movie ending ever. Does this sound like a dumb romantic comedy? Well it's not, and I can assure you I LoAtHe romantic comedies. The dark look at the relation between youth and age, innocence and world-weariness, right and wrong and love and lust (and all these elements fit together perfectly) prevents it from falling into this category of mush. Its other saving grace is the constant undercurrent of humor, in Dustin Hoffman's magnificent deadpan and the personalities of the minor characters. The element of humor is indescribable, being somewhat unconventional, but in the end is probably the funniest (and saddest even) movie I have ever seen.
  I must, I fear, discuss the music for a moment. The S&G soundtrack is so distinctive, as the only songs in the movie are by them and each song is used several times. However, this never gets tedious, just helps to reveal hidden truths in the characters and their emotions. It's a beautiful juxtaposition. The music really embodies the movie, and especially ""The Sound of Silence"" and ""Mrs. Robinson."" ""Sound"" is an utterly dark and tragic song, lamenting the lack of true and honest human contact that becomes a major theme in the movie. ""Mrs. Robinson"" is a slightly odd, humorous song, but with an undercurrent of reality in thinking about the loss of youth.
  And so everything in this movie adds up. It's entertaning, somewhat groundbreaking for its time, moving, balanced, serious and at the same time absolutely hilarious. It's so original, and the perfect performances of Hoffman and Bancroft really carry the whole film. This is really a movie for anyone; despite the subject matter it's not really to risque (but if you want risqu-osity it IS there), and any film lover will adore it. Buy it, watch it again, have a blast from the past or see for the first time one of the greatest movies ever! Show the kids! (Well, maybe later...)
  Just as an afterthought: it just struck me that for some reason this movie in particular seems like it would make a really good gift...or maybe that's just because I covet it...hahaha. No I'm not really trying to sell it, but around this time of year it seems pertinant...",1039996800,3,3029,4.8227360308285165

Farrell walks by and speaks to Hoffman so quickly you may have to freeze frame to see him, but you can't mistake his voice! The DVD includes an interview with Hoffman who shows extreme interest in making a sequel; his idea of what it should be is VERY interesting...I'd like to see it get made! Katharine Ross is interviewed as well and she still looks great. Buck Henry is interviewed and he looks THE SAME! I'm sure you know the plotline by now...grad Benjamin Braddock returns home all confused about his future...he's so messed up he allows Mrs. Robinson to seduce him; later he falls in love with her daughter which causes the old hag to become jealous and threaten Benjamin a few times throughout the rest of the flick...this has one of the all-time greatest endings to ANY movie ever filmed.

As recent college graduate Benjamin Braddock is told at a pool party, the future is plastics.  The movie portrays the coming of age, sexual freedom and wayward view of the young adults of the 60's, the almost plastic existence of their future.  Dustin Hoffman stars as Benjamin and it is his breakout role.  He was thirty years old when he filmed the picture, but he perfectly captures the youthful, nave essence of the part.  Anne Bancroft vamps it up as Mrs. Robinson who seduces Benjamin.  Ms. Bancroft brings a sexy and sultry flair to the film and her role as a sexual predator was stunning at the time.  A third star of the film is the soundtrack by Simon & Garfunkel.  Their music is liberally intertwine throughout the film, the opening sequence set to ""The Sounds Of Silence"" is dead on and the use ""Scarborough Fair/Canticle"" adds a longing, somber note to the picture.  Of course the movie produced the number one hit ""Mrs. Robinson"" which won a Grammy as Record of the Year in 1968.  The film was just the second that Mike Nichols directed.  His first was Whose Afraid of Virginia Woolf, which was departure from his comedic background.  The Graduate is closer to his comedy roots, but he perfectly balances out the humor with dramatic moments.

954406,5,6305034397,"""The Graduate"" tells the story of a young man named Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman), who has just graduated from college and has come home. Benjamin doesn't know yet what he wants to do for the rest of his life. His parents, Mr. and Mrs. Braddock (William Daniels and Elizabeth Wilson), want Benjamin to go to grad school, but he's not sure if he wants to go. His life eruptly changes when an older friend of his family's, Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), tries to seduce him. Mrs. Robinson is the wife of Mr. Robinson (Murray Hamilton), who likes Benjamin until he finds out that Benjamin has been sleeping with his wife, and is the mother of Elaine Robinson (Katherine Ross), who is Benjamin's age. Benjamin's parents try to set him up with Elaine, even though Benjamin is already sleeping with her mother. Mrs. Robinson refuses to let Benjamin take her daughter out, but he does anyway. When Benjamin falls in love with Elaine, Mrs. Robinson finds out and forbides Elaine to see him anymore and even tries to get her to marry another man! Now Benjamin must end his affair with Mrs. Robinson and win back Elaine before it's too late.
Dustin Hoffman is charming, and superb in his role of Benjamin Braddock. Anne Bancroft is also superb as the sexy, sedusive wife. Kathrine Ross, William Daniels, Murray Hamilton, and Elizabeth Wilson are also wonderful in their co-starring roles. ""The Graduate"" is hilarious and poignant at the same time. The Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack only makes the film more enjoyable and fits in just right with the story. The directing by Mike Nichols is awesome and the storyline and dialouge are great. The DVD is okay, but it could have added a few more extras. The only bonus material this DVD includes are an exclusive interview with Dustin Hoffman and a behind-the-scenes making documentary. The DVD is available in wide screen format.
I highly recommend ""The Graduate"".

954408,5,6305034397,"This film changed the formula of how films were made, breaking taboos and using, oh my goodness, serious pop music as the soundtrack. A bit dated for today's audience, this film still retains the art that made it more than entertainment.
Back in the days when it was more common for students to skip grades, Benjamin was set up as the brilliant prodigal son, graduating from college early and ready to conquer the world. However, Benjamin was his own lost generation. The world of hippies, flower power and the generational yearning to change the world was happening all around Benjamin, and he was caught in the molasses of upper-middle-class America. His parents and all their friends expected Benjamin to get a job in business somewhere, and follow in path of his parents and their friends. This conflict is the essence of the movie.
Throughout the movie Dustin Hoffman is reminded of how he feels trapped in a world he did not make. The monkeys in the zoo, pounding the glass in the window of the church, even at the very end, looking through the glass in the back of the bus, the entire movie is a constant reminder that Benjamin is trapped, even if the trap is in his own mind.
Anne Bancroft plays the Mrs. Robinson of the Simon and Garfunkel song. Extremely manipulative of her daughter and Dustin, she is the character that Dustin Hoffman must overcome. Elaine Robinson, who Benjamin finds he is in love with and wants to marry, is played by the beautiful Katharine Ross. Katharine has already fallen into the path laid by her parents, but through her relationship with Dustin she finds that she is intrigued by a world of which Dustin has only given her a glimpse.
The cast includes numerous other names that are very recognizable today, including a very young Richard Dreyfuss. Adding the artistic beauty of the cinematography, the incredible acting by not only the lead actors but all the supporting actors, and the score by Simon and Garfunkel, this movie was virtually an instant classic that has served as an example for dozens of artistic movies through the present day. At least one copy of this movie is a must-have for any afficianado of artistic movies.",1036022400,3,2172,4.748677248677248

954410,5,6305034397,"""The Graduate"" is a love story.  With that said, it's like no other love story you'll ever see.  Dustin Hoffman plays Ben, a college kid who is seduced by a married woman and friend of his parents.  Then he meets Elaine, the woman's daughter.  He falls in love, and the next day faces a world where his seducer is out to get him, his love, Elaine, despises him, and he hasn't the foggiest idea what to do with the rest of his seemingly-charmed life.  Except that suddenly he has a purpose, possibly the first in his twenty-one years: to win Elaine.
Every actor in this film is incredibly fabulous-and that is not at all an exaggeration.  To rival the acting is the cinematography, which is imaginative, pleasing, and original.  One day, perhaps, I'll be able to think of something in this film that could have been better; but it won't be anytime soon.",1031270400,,852,4.529411764705882

The conflicts between the generation gaps still ring painfully true by today's standards. The music by Simon and Garfunkle is great and almost on it's own make the filom worthwhile.

954412,5,6305034397,"This is one of those rare ""classics"", a film that towers above the rest.  It was one of the first films to explore some racey issues, such as younger man/oder woman affairs.
We see Dustin Hoffman, a newly graduated kid on his way to college, moping around the house in the summer. He soon finds out that life can be a little more interesting in the mean time. Anne Bancroft(perfect for the role) plays the older woman who is, in fact, ""trying to seduce"" Hoffman. The two start a heated affair but one that contains very little conversation. At one hilarious point, Hoffman objects to the silence and says, ""let's talk about art,"" seemingly upset by the fact that their affair contains very little deep conversations.
Things get downright comedic when Katherine Ross, portrayed as Elaine Robinson, daughter of Mrs. Robinson, shows up and decides she wants to date Hoffman's character, Ben Braddock. Ben , despite strict objections from the elder Robinson, falls for Elaine and becomes obsessed with her. Things get even more insane when Hoffman follows Elaine to her wedding...only he's not the groom.
This is a funny, sassy, witty, and tremendous film.  It set the precedent for future films of the same genre.  You'll love this movie.
FINAL NOTE: In The Graduate, we can clearly see signs of where Hoffman gets some of inspiration for later characters, such as his roles in Tootsie and Rain Man. Oh, and KATHERINE ROSS FLAT OUT HOT IN THIS FILM!!!!!",1029369600,,1450,4.815261044176707
954499,5,6305034397,"Nearly everyone who has seen THE GRADUATE hails it as a major masterpiece of American cinema.  The AFI poll places it at #7 on its all-time hit list.  There are reasons why this film was such a monster hit that can still resonate with a new generation that usually puts down whatever their parents held up as classic.  THE GRADUATE is alternatingly hilarious, serious, undecided, and sexual, exactly the mix that appeals across the board to any generation.  When it was released in 1967, the Baby Boomers were roughly the same age as Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman was then a surprising 30, with Anne Bancroft 36). When Ben walks down the stairs to his living room, he is not only being introduced to his parents' guests, he is a surrogate male deb presented to a then post baby boom and pre-Vietnam society that had riches, power, and education but nowhere to turn to use them.  Much of the power of the film lies in a series of vignettes that illustrate this gap between the earnest callowness of youth and the foolish, sometimes vindictive ingrained attitudes of Ben's family and of the vicious Queen Bee herself, Mrs. Robinson.  The 'plastics' scene has been endlessly debated as to its symbolism, but given its context, it more likely refers to the slightly sardonic choice between Ben's unwillingness to act and the older generation's Depression Era habit of requiring all of the next generation to act. Have you noticed that every adult in the film older than Ben is either foolish, mean-spirited, or cowardly?  Certainly Ben has.  It must not have been easy for him to be unfailingly polite to all those whom he must have seen as confrontational. The seduction scenes between Ben and Mrs. Robinson are both funny and pathetic.  Funny in that she has a world of sophistication that constantly exposes his lack of it.  Pathetic in that she establishes in concrete that in this relation she is the boss, leaving both Ben and the viewer to wonder where her antagonism toward her daughter Elaine (Katherine Ross) is coming from.  When I watched the movie again recently, I paid more attention to the relation between mother and daughter than to mother and lover.  Nowhere does Mrs. Robinson show any maternal love for Elaine. Instead, what we see is a competition between the reigning Queen and an upstart princess pretender who is not even aware of the existence of this competition. Their time together on screen in short, but what there is evidences a conflict that climaxes in the church marriage of Elaine to Carl Smith.  Ben shouts out Elaine's name, while tapping on a window.  Elaine shouts back, while her mother slaps her face.  When Ben and Elaine fight their way out using yet another heavily symbolic prop, a massive crucifix, the battle between them and her parents is seen more as a battle between the wandering youth generation of 1967 and an earlier one that was hardened by the Depression and the Second World War, both of which carried no emotional wallop except to those that endured them.
  Those who try to encapsulate the lasting power of the movie usually focus on the standout scenes: plastics, the frontdesk bell ringing in the hotel, the 'I think you are scum' invective delivered by Elaine's father, the terrific songs of Simon and Garfunkel whose lyrics and themes punctuate Ben's evolving perspective.  Yet, one of the least analyzed moments comes at the very end when Ben and Elaine dash out of the church, she in a wedding gown, he in a jogging suit, to seek refuge in a passing bus. As they sit in the back, to the consternation of all the other passengers, the camera lingers on Ben's and Elaine's faces.  Their expressions are at first ecstatically happy.  Bit by bit though, their expressions take on a more somber hue.  They do not even look at each other.  It is as if now for the first time in the film for both, that they realize that up until that very moment, life's consequences could be evaded, avoided, or deterred.  Now they know differently.  They may in fact love one another, but each has been rudely yanked out of their comfortable Southern California affluent life to live in the real world where maturity is but one asset needed to enjoy that love. THE GRADUATE is a magnificent ensemble of sight, sound, mood, and acting, but it is this subtle call to the need to reach out for a mature perspective about why we do things the way that we do that makes this movie as timeless now as it was back in 1967.",1027814400,8,4461,4.68974358974359

Even Simon and Garfunkel's beautiful soundtrack accurately coincide with the film's central character and his general outlook on life as a graduate.

954501,4,6305034397,"from what appears to be a steamy trash novel, Mike Nichols and Buck Henry elevate it to a meditation on young adulthood, which was popular then as it is now, I suppose. Poor Ben Braddock-spoiled to death, doted on, fresh out of college...and has no idea what to do next. In his inertia he stumbles into a sex affair with the neighbors wife who is twice his elder. This gets dicey when he falls for her daughter, and the jealous mother makes him ruin his budding romance with her. What is at first a racy romp of a movie turns shrill at the end, when the movie takes its focus off Ben and Mrs. Robinson's dalliance and focuses more on a hero's quest for the heart of the woman he loves, with much screaming and nastiness abounding...the cool Mrs. Robinson becomes a shrew, which was unfortunate. Saying anymore would spoil the ending.
Overall, this was a great movie, one Ive been putting off to see and am glad I finally broke down and watched. Dustin Hoffman is a brilliant comic actor, playing the nervous, puzzled Ben, and Mike Nichols' directing is fun and very much the product of an era.

954503,5,6305034397,"As a recent college graduate with no job and no plans for the immediate future, I picked up The Graduate hoping for some direction.  I may not have found any direction, but I did find a witty, smart comedy about a recent college graduate.
As Benjamin Braddock, Dustin Hoffman was brilliant.  I could sympathize with his search for something worthwhile in the days following his graduation from college.  The party scene at his house where all of the adults are asking Benjamin what he is going to do and offering their advice is particularly amusing.  I had a similar experience and was forced to make up answers to appease the questioners.
Mrs. Robinson, his friend's attractive mother was also played very well.  Her encounters and advances towards an uncomfortable Benjamin are comic in their portrayal.  In his relationship with Mrs. Robinson, we see Benjamin go from a shy, unconfident boy to a man confident in his sexuality and with his affair with Mrs. Robinson.
The Simon and Garfunkel song that is used during transitions is haunting and will ring in your mind for many hours following the movie.  ""The Sounds of Silence"" was a perfect choice for this movie and it may be a bit over used, but it is nevertheless effective.

The performance of Bancroft and Hoffman and Mike Nichol's direction helped the film. Dustin Hoffman portrayed a bright, but naive graduate student. Anne Bancroft as the seductive and icily feline Mrs. Robinson. Nichol's odd angles, jittery editing, and evocative wide-screen photography helped boost the artistic quality of the movie. The script was written by Buck Henry and Calder Willingham. The script was simple. You could give it to ten different writers and the results will be interesting. The originality of the script and the performance helped boost the comedy level.
  The picture quality and the sound quality of the DVD was good for a 1967 movies. The interview with Dustin Hoffman and the making of the movie documentary was interesting and resourceful. The extras of the DVD was great but not excellent. I bought this movie at a price of 17.00(new). You can't expect too much at that price. I'm hoping that a Criterion Edition will be released for THE GRADUATE.

The movie portrayed a confused, cut off, and trapped man trying to figure out what he is going to do with his future.

I watched it yesterday at the library. in real life, anne bancroft is only 6 years older than dustin hoffman and yet she has a very mature look, pretty much playing dustin like a piano for most of the movie. but wouldn't most men like to be in benjamin braddock's shoes? !  he was the godfather of slackers. this movie came out the year i was born; back then films were embracing a new openess in creativity and sexuality. it was also the summer of love and the sexual revolution was in full swing. katherine ross looks so young in this one. so does richard dreyfus.it was interesting to see the scenes shot at UC Berkeley( one scenes is shot on telegraph avenue )  and the Oakland Zoo, places i have been to many times. of course, this is one of the most quotable movies ever...the wedding finale ( elaine!!! elaine !!! ) caused a lump in my throat...and oh yeah, simon and garfunkel's songs, put the movie soundtrack on the map..."" where have you gone, joe dimaggio??

954508,5,6305034397,"Wes Anderson (director of ""Rushmore"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums"") has said that when he and Owen Wilson hit a block in one of their scripts, they (consciously or not) steal something from ""The Graduate"".  Magically, everything gets back on track.  Being a huge fan of Anderson and Wilson's work, I figured I'd give ""The Graduate"" another try.  My first viewing left me underwhelmed.  Amused, but underwhelmed.  But seeing it again, with freshly graduated eyes, it's a different story.  The film is damn near perfect.
The first act can be off-putting.  It was to me.  Less concerned with reality than with tone, it comes off as little more than self-obsessed parody, enamored with its own jokes (""Plastics!"" has become stale with time) and the angst of its protagonist.  And with the benefit of hindsight, Dustin Hoffman's clipped monotonic speech makes it appear like he's playing a younger version of Raymond Babbitt than the newly graduated Benjamin Braddock.  Thankfully, things relax when Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft) comes on the scene, and the film can get down to brass tacks.
Benjamin and Mrs. Robinson's seduction scene is a wonder of comic awkwardness.  While she's in total control and full of ennui, he's sweating and stumbling while trying to hatch an escape route.  But he stays.  And the next sequence, their inevitable coupling, is ludicrous on several levels.  First, it revels in the cheeky double entendres paranoiacally swirling around Ben's head (Buck Henry, as a hotel desk clerk, asks innocently, ""Are you here for an *affair*, sir?""; ""Wood?"" asks Ben of Mrs. Robinson, gauging her preference of clothes hangers, instead of making a pass, as she nearly assumes).  Second, it is underscored by Simon and Garfunkel's 'Sounds of Silence'.  The song choice is ludicrous because its dulcet tones would seem to have nothing to do with detached copulation.  But read the lyrics.  Is this not Ben's voice, trying to scream above the ""ten thousand people, maybe more... talking without speaking... hearing without listening""?  In his affair with Mrs. Robinson, Ben is searching for his voice (in the wrong place, as we shall soon see).
The bulk of the second act is concerned with Ben meeting and then being rejected by Elaine, Mrs. Robinson's daughter.  The first hour, so nearly perfect in its satire and depiction of Californian malaise, left doubts in me that the second hour could live up to it.  Thankfully, and an equal part of the credit should go to Katharine Ross as Dustin Hoffman, it does.  Hoffman relaxes around Ross, putting on a cloak of easy charisma and charm, allowing the honest emotions of his love to shine through.  Ross, for her part, is always open and receptive to Ben, and even gives back as much as she gets.  Their knee-jerk fall into love is made sensible by the obvious chemistry between the actors.  The act is scored, again paradoxically perfectly, by another S&G songs, 'Scarborough Fair'.  With its constant wish of ""then she'll be a true love of mine"", it too captures the mood of the sequence perfectly.
In act three, Ben tries to redeem himself after all his mistakes.  And thanks to the care the filmmakers took in setting him up, you can't help but feel for Ben as he runs through the streets of Santa Barbara looking for Elaine's wedding.  'Mrs. Robinson', the third major S&G song used, works here mainly for its ambiguity.  Which one of Ben's women does its titular character represent?  Doesn't matter, really.  Just follow the bouncy beat, hum ""coo coo ca-choo"", and long for the innocent days when Joe DiMaggio held the gaze of a nation's lonely eyes.
Many have hypothesized that ""The Graduate"" is about the sixties' youth rebellion.  But in the end, and in the beginning if you look close enough, it's not about rebellion, but conformity on one's own terms.  Ben determines to botch the date his parents set him up on.  But eventually he ends up on a bus with that very same girl, she in her wedding dress, he with a ripped jacket.  He has just stolen her away from a button-down fiancee, and their future together appears to be filled with laughter.  Until, and this happens in a quick moment, the laughter subsides, and they realize they barely know each other.  It's not groundbreaking for me to say that this scene runs the emotional gamut from exhilaration to anxiety in just the expressions on the actors' faces.  But it's worth mentioning one more time for those who've missed it.
I didn't expect it to be, but ""The Graduate"" is still fresh today, more than thirty years after its first release.  And it's also about a lot more than adultery, post-graduate misery, and romantic love.  It has much critical to say about the generation from whence it sprang.  I suspect Mike Nichols, whose direction is whimsical and witty without ever being overbearing, and Buck Henry/Calder Willingham, whose screenplay abounds with sharp jokes and sharper observations about human nature, deserve a lot of the credit.  Regardless, ""The Graduate"" is one of those rare films whose appeal and importance hasn't lessened over time; in fact, on both counts, it may have increased.",1016496000,3,5128,4.901392111368909
954549,5,6305034397,"I knew the basic story of ""The Graduate"" even before I saw it.  Well, actually I knew about Benjamin and Mrs. Robinson's relationship, as does everyone by now; I just didn't know how it ended.
When we first meet him, Benjamin Braddock(Hoffman), having just returned home after finishing college, is trying to steal some time for himself away from his graduation party so that he can figure out what to do with his life next.  Who should come knocking but Mrs. Robinson (Bancroft), who with the question, ""Would you like me to seduce you?"", proceeds to put him in the most uncomfortable position he's ever been in his life, literally and figuratively.  After Benjamin tries unsuccessfully to first have an intellectual conversation with Mrs. Robinson and then to break off the affair, his parents decide to set him up for his first date with the Robinsons' daughter, Elaine.  Mrs. Robinson expresses her disapproval and threatens to tell all if he dates Elaine a second time.  Ben finally goes to Berkeley, where Elaine is attending college, and convinces her to marry him on the spot---right up to the day when she's scheduled to marry someone else  The final climatic scene would be parodied and reproduced some twenty-seven years later in ""Wayne's World 2.""
I took note especially of the cinematography in this movie.  In particular, whenever ""The Sounds of Silence"" or ""Scarborough Fair"" is heard, the images on the screen become surreal: images of reality mixed with what is going on inside Benjamin's imagination.  The effect takes hold of you and makes you feel what he's feeling.  And I know for sure that I won't ever listen to Simon and Garfunkel the same way again.",1013644800,,1675,4.869718309859155

954552,3,6305034397,"This movie was groundbreaking when released, and it is now a classic.  The screenplay by Buck Henry is great, Mike Nichols did an outstanding job directing, and all the key parts were cast and acted perfectly.  The great Simon & Garfunkel music helped to make the film what it became.  AFI ranked it #7 on its list of the top 100 American movies, and I agree.  I think it is that good.  I saw it on TV when I was teenager, and have rented it or seen it on TV several times since then.  It has always been one of  my favorite films.  I even read the novel by Charles Webb (to which the movie stayed pretty close).
Unfortunately, this DVD does not do it justice.  The main problem is the audio.  The sound track is just ever so slightly out of sync with the picture throughout the entire film.  In one scene, when Benjamin's mother confronts him about his nocturnal activities, the problem is extremely noticeable.  The sound is mixed badly throughout, especially during the second half of the film, when Benjamin starts seeing Elaine (Katherine Ross).  Crucial dialog is drowned out by sound effects.  By the end, you have to crank up the volume on your TV to wake-up-the-neighbors levels just to hear what the characters are saying.  This is inexcusable.  I also note, from an earlier review, that the laserdisk version had a director's commentary, so why doesn't the DVD?
Some day, they'll put out a good DVD version of the movie, until then we'll have to be content with VHS and Turner Classic Movies.",1007510400,34,1503,4.552238805970149

One of the most talked about hits of the late sixties, it was a formative influence on the counterculture, and it was the movie that made Dustin Hoffman a star.  Anne Bancroft is tremendously fun at first.  She's the amusingly voracious middle-aged woman who seduces the naive Benjamin, and  when he's in bed with and wants to talk about art, the comic moments click along with the rhythm of a hit Broadway show.  But then the movie deliberately undercuts its own hip expertise and begins to pander to youth.  Benjamin is in love with Mrs. Robinson's fresh, wide-eyed daughter (Katherine Ross), and the mother is turned into a vindictive witch.  (and the comedy turns into melodrama).  The movie functioned as a psychodrama: the graduate stood for truth; the older people stood for sham and for corrupt sexuality.  And this ""generation gap"" view of youth and age entered the national bloodstream; many moviegoers went to see the picture over and over again.",1004054400,15,1027,4.817142857142857

Perhaps I've just viewed other movies in this vein and The Graduate doesn't really set itself apart from them.  It's a good film, and I like it, but I believe it was number 7 on the AFI list, and that's just far too high a ranking.  A masterpiece of filmaking?  Not in my opinion.

954558,5,6305034397,"This was one of the transforming movies of my youth. It captured the angst a lot of us felt, knowing that we didn't want the seemingly empty material values we were supposed to want, but not knowing what the hell it was that we DID want. That this is a universal dilemma of young adulthood is why The Graduate still speaks to us.
But, on seeing it now, it is so obviously of a very special time and place. Post 50's early 60's America in general, Southern California specifically. It was still an innocent America....the Viet Nam war isn't even mentioned. This is just on the cusp of pre-Hippie, pre-Yippie, pre-Chicago Convention, pre-Nixon, pre-Bobby & Martin's assassinations but after John's. To see the movie now is to see another country, one that didn't exist for very long, and one that no longer exists. The world this movie depicts is about to explode, and Benjamin's dissatisfaction is a precursor to that which would fuel that explosion. BUT THAT'S ANOTHER STORY.
Forget about that and just enjoy a tremendously funny and insightful film. Mike Nichols second directorial effort (and he went all out to make his bones) and the star-making breakout role for Dustin Hoffman. Ann Bancroft is wonderful, Katherine Ross delicious, Murray Hamilton very funny, and the rest of the cast perfect.
A disaffected graduate scholar/athlete drifts into an affair with his father's partner's wife, and subsequently falls head-over-heels for the daughter. That's it, but what fun and great laughs are mined from this material. Just great classic scenes and dialogue, and emotions and situations that are timeless. And, of course, there was the brilliant idea to use Simon & Garfunkel's music. The near-Hollywood ending is saved by the last shot....confusion and angst aren't that easily dispelled. It was a watershed film way back when.....enjoy.",994809600,3,1841,5.059210526315789

I saw it on the big screen in college, the same age as Ben. Now I'm in my 30s, older than Ben.  The movie stands the test of time.  I have to give it Five stars.  In fact, right after watching it, I had a desire to watch the whole thing again.  I don't think the movie will ever grow old!  (For those of you not familiar with the movie, it's about a young man who's just completed college.  He does not know what to do with his life.  He is seduced by the wife of his father's business partner.  Eventually he falls in love her daughter.  The sexcapades not withstanding, I think anyone can identify with not knowing what to do with your life.)The reason I only gave the movie 4 stars is because I was averaging it out with the DVD treatment.  I would give the DVD treatment 3 stars.  The DVD contains the extras that were added to the 25th Anniversary edition of the videotape.  They include a documentary, an interview with Dustin Hoffmann, and the movie trailer.  (The film is also in widescreen.)  For a videotape that would be in incredible.  I like DVDs with more extras.  If any DVD ever warranted a Director's Commentary, it's The Graduate.  Additionally, this DVD warranted a Music Only soundtrack.  Finally, the DVD had not been cleaned up.  There were glitches and spots on film.  I believe The Graduate deserves better.  Nevertheless, I do recommend it.  It's a timeless film.",992995200,8,1509,4.423357664233577

I don't subscribe to the view that this is a black comedy...not entirely, anyway.  Rather, I think it was an intelligently written ""nod"" to a generation that found itself not knowing what to do in their parents' traditional--almost orthodox--mold of expectations and values with the added irony of those same parents performing the taboo!!

954631,5,6305034397,"What a great movie, one that someone of any age can get something out of. Dustin is superb as the college grad that has always done well, but is now sort of aimless and confused about what to do next. He's pounced on by a female friend of his parents, and doesn't put up much resistance as she seduces him. He's not quite sure what to do - he doesn't want it to be just sexual, but she resists any attempt to make it more. His parents try to get to know him, but are inept at it. The daughter of his lover appeals to him in her 'normalcy' ... and he finally has to take a stand and figure out what he really does want.
The acting is great, the dialogue is great, and even the cinematography is excellent in conveying the mood of the various scenes. The soundtrack works extremely well with the atmosphere.
The special features on the DVD are very eye-opening. The one that struck me the most involves the scene near the end in the church, where Dustin is pounding on the glass with his arms wide. It seems to be a very strong 'Jesus' symbolism ... but as the 'making of' explains, he *had* to do it that way so that there was no risk of breaking the glass. It's amazing that the whole dynamic of that scene changes when you realize he was simply pounding to get her attention, and that the 'shape' was a necessity and not a choice.

The ending left me wanting the story to continue and the music to keep repeating. Dustin Hoffman immediately became my favorite actor, long before 'Tootsie' or 'Rainman.' Now, 20 years later, I relate to other themes besides the often mentioned 'societal expectations' of young people. The most successful stories are ones which people can identify with, and The Graduate hits a home run. Have you ever been involved in a relationship deemed 'questionable' or 'inappropriate?' Ever been devastated by infidelity or shocking revelations from a family member or loved one?  There's a character here for everyone. If you already saw the movie when you were younger, watch it again and become mesmorized for a different reason.  Now in my 40's, the movie has become downright scary if not heartbreaking. Many may consider it a comedy in places, but I have yet to laugh aloud. Paul Simon's best writing 'makes' the movie, providing a score that is second to none.

The video is framed at about 2.35:1,  but is not anamorphic and has a little too much edge enhancement applied to  it.  But other than that, the picture is fine.

Both extremely funny and extremely sad (sometimes in the same scene, a rare thing to achieve without succumbing to campy irony), it is also an  instance of outstanding acting.  Hoffman and Bancroft must truly be among  the best actors/actresses of their generation (along with Malcolm McDowell,  Harrison Ford, Morgan Freeman, etc) and their chemistry, if that's the  right word given the nature of the affair, is terrific.  Also great is  Katherine Ross.  Disappointing are the people who played Hoffman's  parents--or perhaps they are deliberately portrayed as caricatures.  All in  all, a landmark, and never was a better atmospheric soundtrack chosen.  The  baby boomers should feel lucky to have this as one of their generation's  finest...does Generation X even have one that defines them?",963619200,,871,5.2101449275362315
954694,5,6305034397,"I just finished watching The Graduate again.  I am sure most people have seen it or if you have not you have been living in a hole.  Well maybe not a hole...What a great performance Hoffman gives us.  His silence.  His  tone.  All incredible.  It is like watching Buster Keaton mixed with a  confused teenager...well it is unbelievable really, unlike anything I have  seen.  I have not had a chance to watch Carnal Knowledge...Director  Nichols' next film, although as soon as I saw The Graduate I rushed out and  bought it.  There are so many good ideas in this movie.  PERFECT...PERFECT...The more you watch the movie you will see that  everything, no matter how small, will lead to something...that it is not  just in the movie.  It is in there for a reason.  EVERYTHING in this movie  is important and will lead to the next scene or situation.  It is  brilliant.  I loved it.  The Graduate is a very very SMART movie.  Please,  watch it.  More than once.  You will appreciate it more.  Jared",962755200,2,995,4.563218390804598
954695,5,6305034397,"Brilliant acting, by both Hoffman and Bancroft, make this easily my favorite movie. Acting aside, the script is excellent, and the ending is one of the best I've ever seen.  The movie is great for repeat viewings, I  just purchased it recently and have already watched it two more times. Try  watching the movie once as a comedy and then again as a drama. Either way,  the movie is incredible.",961977600,,393,4.571428571428571
954696,4,6305034397,"...I wasn't even a twinkle in my mother's eye when this film came out so perhaps I shouldn't really judge this film as I can spot holes.  But I am judging it because I liked the film and I can also appreciate fact that  this film was groundbreaking at the time I am giving it four instead of  three stars.
Never before had there been a film about someone who is  post-coming of age but still too young to class himself as an adult and the  kind of life, a mish-mash of boredom, identity, duty and frustration, most  of us feel when we are in that often ignored transition phase (ignored by  culture, parents, teachers etc.)  Fresh from college graduate Benjamin  Braddock simply does not know what he wants to do with his life; but he  does know he doesn't feel quite ready to jump into the cosey little life  his ghastly parents have planned for him (ghastly in that they are  insensitive, pushy, self-obsessed and seem to want to show him off as a  reflection on themselves rather than worried about his own happiness). And  so this is the perfect opportunity for Mrs. Robinson a bored alcoholic  housewife who despises her husband to pounce on him. Purely to add some  glamour into his life Benjamin starts an illicit affair with her which  turns nasty once he meets and falls in love with her daughter,  Elaine.
Hoffman is terrific as the confused Benjamin adding wonderful  comic timing and making this film throroughly entertaining. Bancroft is  also good as the spiteful and manipulative Mrs. Robinson and Katharine Ross  doesn't do a bad job either as Elaine.
I liked the fact that Elaine was  not written as a sickly sweet young thing and you can fully believe in them  as a couple and you can see what they see in eachother.
However, I prefer  the stage play version; it offers more insight into Mrs. Robinson and  Elaine but then again I guess I'm biased.
But the ending is best on film;  now that wa undeniably good.",961545600,2,1928,4.531976744186046
954697,5,6305034397,"An old friend of mine used to tell me years ago : "" In the worst  movie, there are always at least 5 minutes of pure cinema which will make  you survive the other 85 minutes "".
In THE GRADUATE, there are a  lot more of these 5 minutes of grace when the conjunction of music, image,  dialogs and acting transforms a simple scene in a sheer artistic  moment.
I think that THE GRADUATE could be considered as one of the  movies representing in the best possible way the sixties. Behind this  sentimental comedy, you capture the heart of that period. Paraphrasing  Benjamin, I would say that it's an adequate movie.
The features are very  interesting. Just compare the trailer and the movie and you will have an  idea of the terrific DVD transfer work that has been done here.
A DVD  which is already in your library.",958003200,2,813,4.425675675675675
954698,5,6305034397,this film is timeless. Dustin Hoffman is in one of his many great films. Anne Bancroft does a great job.the music is also a perfect match to the film.it's a perfect one-two punch.it has aged very well.it captures the  time period really well.,950918400,,242,4.627906976744186
954699,5,6305034397,"I would really like to give this movie infinite stars! It blows my mind every time I watch it. The acting is impeccable; Dustin Hoffman's genius is even more apparent in retrospect while Anne Bancroft's Mrs. Robinson  resounds with fullness and contradiction. The writing is both hilarious and  wrenching and the cinematography, while wildly creative, is not at all  distracting or self-conscious. The perfect pairing of these components with  the incredible Simon and Garfunkle soundtrack make for the most nuanced,  subtle, and serendipitous film I have ever seen. I have seen this movie  innumerable times and it never fails to surprise me with a previously  unnoticed gesture, squeak, or breath contributing to the overall genius.  Finally, all of this would be superflous if the movie did not have the  enormous soul that it does. The flawless artistry of its production has  produced an immortal story that transcends the medium of film. This movie  changed my life and I recommend it to absolutely everyone.",945129600,,1014,5.159509202453988
954747,5,6305034397,"I have owned this film on video for about eleven years.  I'm finally purchasing the DVD version.  I first saw it as a kid during a 1972 re-release and was stunned by the story, acting and directing.  Then I read  the book and realized the entire story  was already there.  Mike Nichols  hardly had to change anything.  But what a great job he did with casting,  camera, music and even the supporting players whom will be familiar to most  TV viewers.  I don't think I've met anyone who did not love it.",940291200,5,502,4.3478260869565215
954748,2,6305034397,"Would you really want to see a movie that has to be explained to you?  I don't know what THE GRADUATE is supposed to mean.  Like 2001 A SPACE ODDYSEY and MIDNIGHT COWBOY, THE GRADUATE does a great job of confusing the  heck out of you to the point where you think you must have seen something  great.  THE GRADUATE is worth seeing (for free, on TV) once, I guess,  because it takes you somewhere (an affair with your girlfriend's mother)  the movies rarely go.  Also, the late Norman Fell does a superb job playing  the kid's landlord.  Director Francis Ford Coppola uses symbolism well in  pictures such as THE OUTSIDERS because his imagery relates to the story.  But the director of THE GRADUATE must have thought symbols could substitute  for a story.  They ought to send THE GRADUATE to summer school, or better  yet, film school.",939772800,2,834,4.578231292517007
954749,4,6305034397,"Dustin Hoffman in the title role is splendid in his portrayal of the neophyte male college graduate who is expected to take his place in corporate society.  The double entendre jumps out at you as he is expected  to graduate from boyhood to fully functioning, sexual male specimen as he  is seduced by Mrs. Robinson, his future sweetheart's mother.  The social  convolutions of Mrs. Robinson, played to the hilt by Ann Bancroft, are  indicative of the lengths to which the 50's generation parents would go to  ensure the welfare of their college-prepped offspring, their own social  behavior notwithstanding.",919209600,2,608,5.13265306122449
954750,5,6305034397,"Everyone should see this movie.  Hoffman & Bancroft are superb.  The supporting cast is believable and deliver outstanding performances.  It is a slice of life which is as poignant today as it was in 1967.  The scenes  in the film not only show what was happening in the late 60's, but serve to  capture the feelings and confusion of a young adult preparing for the rest  of his life, when the future is not all that clear.  The Simon &  Garfunkle sound track is a perfect match and serves to evoke all the  emotions that the characters are feeling.  Ben's mom & dad are  hilarious in their efforts to be part of, but not intrusive in, his life.  I have seen this movie dozens of times since I was first exposed to it in a  film class several years ago and I have not tired of it yet!  Enjoy!",916876800,,792,4.221476510067114
