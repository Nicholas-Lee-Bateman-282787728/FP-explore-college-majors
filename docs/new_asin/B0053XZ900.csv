Several state governments realize it's potential and have decriminalized it's use under a medical practitioner's order yet the Federal government usurps the rights of the states, and therefore the People, to have access to a substance that has the potential to help them! It's time to ""get real"" about restoring our Liberties that this government is taking away!",1324425600,2,487,5.256410256410256
8455899,5,B0053XZ900,"""A NORML Life"" is a terrific film that should be widely seen by reformers and others. It's upbeat, well edited, educational and entertaining.

The film has some fine snippets of Doors keyboardist Ray Manzarek extolling the consciousness-expanding properties of pot, and the DVD contains a bonus interview with Manzerek.

Canadian activist Jodie Emery, whose husband Marc is serving time in a US federal prison for selling marijuana seeds over the internet, is one of the interviewees. In her poignant segment, Emery points out that Marc's actions were aimed at bringing back homegrown marijuana instead of cartel-grown.

Elvy Musikka, one of four federal patients who receives marijuana from the US government for her glaucoma, is also powerful in her interview, as is her driver ""Big Mike"" and the little-but-mighty Ohio activist Tonya Davis. California Drs. Frank Lucido and Christine Paoletti do a fine job explaining the scientific basis for marijuana's medical uses, and Kentuckian Gatewood Galbraith has some amusing and cogent analyses.

Sabrina Fendrick describes how the new NORML Women's Alliance sprang from an article titled ""Stiletto Stoners"" in Marie Claire, and NORML director Allen St. Pierre explains well the organization's challenge: end prohibition while still offering assistance to its victims. He likened it to trying to build a boat while already in the water.

The film ends with a message from NORML founder Keith Stroup encouraging folks to come ""out"" as pot smokers and work with their elected officials to lift federal prohibition, allowing states to make their own laws, just as happened with alcohol.

A companion film, ""Hempsters: Plant the Seed,"" is narrated by Woody Harrelson and features Willie Nelson, Ralph Nader, and others.",1321401600,5,1763,5.392727272727273
