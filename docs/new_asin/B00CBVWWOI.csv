8580068,5,B00CBVWWOI,"Like, ever heard of ""Totally Spies!"" ?  Y'know, three hot, young teen girls Sam, Alex, and Clover who have some wicked cool adventures as secret agents of the World Organization Of Human Protection or WOOHP for short.  I'm sure you've heard of this series before because it was on the Cartoon Network a few years ago.  Anywho, you can relive the fabulous adventures of these fine young ladies as they travel the globe stopping the cray-cray schemes of bad guys of all kinds and hope they make it back to school on time in their hometown of Beverly Hills.

This volume, ""Wild Style"" has the last 13 episodes from the first season such as:

""Wild Style"" - A fiendish fashion designer named Helga Von Guggen creates a line of outfits that turn people into freaky animal-like creatures.
""The Black Widows"" - The girls go undercover as cheerleaders ""The WOOHP-ettes"" in order to investigate a missing cheer squad replaced by a sinister team of robots.
""Evil Boyfriend"" - Sam falls in love with a handsome new guy at school.  And while her friends Clover and Alex try to find a day out together, Sam is unwittingly helping her new beau steal a secret invisibility formula.
""Game Girls"" - Athletes are being mysteriously abducted and placed into a dangerous video game world where our threesome of spies go in to save them and themselves from the dangers deep within the games.
""Spies vs. Spies"" - Our heroines meet a trio of former spies who came out of retirement and work for WOOHP again.  But these older spies might be up to something not good in the least.
""Malled"" - A strange store turns their mall shoppers into savage people.  As if Clover being accused for shoplifting wasn't bad enough !
""Soul Collector"" - Someone is collecting the youth essence of children so that they can stay young forever.  Shocking !
""The Iceman Cometh"" - The girls attempt to stop a coldhearted felon from freezing the planet and putting it into a new Ice Age.

As a final note, the action-packed series ""Totally Spies!"" is very cool and unique with its special brand of girl power involved.  It also pretty much chronicles the average lives of typical spoiled teenage girls who lead double lives as secret agents which makes the show pretty cool, too, making it visually appealing to both girls and boys alike.  So for that that matter, look for more new DVDs of the spy gals' adventures coming soon !",1377820800,,2382,4.658711217183771
8580069,5,B00CBVWWOI,I love this show and can't wait for the whole series to get released and the only down part is that the season was split in half instead of being complete set.,1368921600,,159,4.0
