8126830,5,B000FUTVOQ,"I picked this up for a good quality copy of the Tom Snyder show interview having only possessed it previously on VHS bootleg with the very end missing. This interview is a complete crack up thanks to a very drunk (yet lovable) Space Ace who steals the show, much to the horror of Gene who seems completely panicked and tries (unsuccessfully)to steer the conversation back to the mundane and safe ground. In the mean time Ace wants to talk drugs and rock n roll parties, and Peter about his fascination with guns and shooting things. Gene clearly wants the band to appeal to the kiddie market and their allowance providing parents at that juncture and seems unable to go with the flow as the chaos unfolds around him. Some years previous he would have relished and courted the controversy albeit in a more controlled way but not at this point. A truly classic interview if not a little sad to watch an ever increasing rift growing between the members, one that would never really be successfully repaired. Tom Snyder is having a ball and indeed adds to the crack up factor by some stupendous bloopers around the band members names and a running joke concerning a piece of pipe he wants worked on back stage, and his obvious complete lack of understanding of rock music let alone what exactly its all means as Kiss sit on set in full Vegas regalia. Another highlight is the interesting yet sombre Creatures era chat with Gene and Paul where they look completely over the whole Kiss routine. It really would come as no surprise major changes were afoot from watching this interview. So the Tom Snyder video is the selling point but overall the whole thing is worth a visit to see a band at various points of their career where they seem to be looking over the edge of looming changes to their fortunes and struggling to find their feet. I think this is what makes it so very watchable. Recommended.",1168214400,6,1895,4.592920353982301
8126831,4,B000FUTVOQ,"The opening interview on the Tom Snyder show from October 31, 1979 is by far the most entertaining KISS interview of all time!  The first half of the DVD is this interview, as far as I can tell, in its entirety.  This is the now infamous interview where Ace is drunk and off of Gene and Paul's tight leash.  Ace cracks himself, and everyone but Gene and Paul, up during most of the interview.  What I find most interesting is how watered down, Gene tries to keep things.  Gene freaks out when Peter mentions he has a gun collection and has to pipe in and say, ""They're toy guns"".  Peter's cool though and says, c'mon I can talk about my guns.  Ace tells a story about trashing his hotel room and his road manager tells the cops that his friends got Ace drunk and drugged him and he was passed out.  Gene and Paul freak out and shout, HE WASN'T DRUGGED, HE WASN'T DRUGGED.  Then comically Ace states, I don't do drugs.  Ace interrupts Gene and Paul several times and it's great to see their reaction to being upstaged by Ace.  Gene is slouched in his chair pouting most of the time and asks a couple time, ""Having fun Tom?""  Actually Tom looks to be having a blast as he is cracked up time and time again by Ace's antics.  This interview alone warrants the purchase of this DVD.

The rest of the interviews are Gene and Paul from the Crazy Nights era.  There is one from Creatures and another of Gene alone that looks to be from the Farewell era.  Some of these interviews are interesting like one where Paul states that a Reunion with the 4 original members would not happen and KISS is only interesting in moving forward and not living off the past.

As far as unauthorized releases go, this one is not bad.  The DVD is good quality with VHS quality video and sound.  Recommended for the Tom Snyder interview alone, the rest is just a bonus.",1155513600,17,1842,4.333333333333333
