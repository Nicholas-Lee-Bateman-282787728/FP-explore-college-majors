8220350,1,B000VWQTYS,"I love horrible movies. I have a bookcase full of them. I was hoping this would be a great one for the collection...but this one barely rates above a elementary school play.

Do yourself a favor. Find a good high-quality jpg of the cover art (which is the BEST thing about this movie, albeit totally unrelated to the movie itself) and save the $ and time.",1371772800,,355,4.378787878787879
8220351,4,B000VWQTYS,"This was a very entertaining movie. At first it seemed a bit silly but as I watched, it captured my attention,as I am sure it will do the same for you. I will not go into details I will just say buy this one. You will not be disappointed.",1271808000,,238,3.877551020408163
8220352,5,B000VWQTYS,Really Enjoyed this Film.  I'm just getting interested in the Vampire/Horror Genre and found this to be a very good movie.,1245628800,,122,4.809523809523809
8220353,1,B000VWQTYS,Even for a B film this one is bad... it had potential but the lack of any real story line and the really bad sound killed it. In all fairness Ms Brooks was on the right track but unless you are a dyed in the wool aficionado it is not worth the current asking price.,1245110400,,265,3.8363636363636364
8220354,4,B000VWQTYS,"I was a fan of the original tale when I read it in high school and was looking forward to seeing the two movies based on the classic short story. Neither film, either the 1970's version with Glynis Johns or this one with Magenta Brooks, followed the story very closely so they must be judged on their own instead of as adaptations. The Johns movie is disappointing since it is neither scary nor sexy, however, the Brooks movie is both. Production values are very low and the sound and acting is just passable but the star, Magenta Brooks, is sexy, elegant and carries the film effortlessly. She wears her costumes with the grace of Sargent's ""Madame X"" and steals every scene she's in. Buy it just to see her.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mrs-Amworth/dp/B000VWQTYS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mrs. Amworth</a>",1229472000,4,854,5.428571428571429

It has been cheaply made by a very small production company, and is so obscure that if you search on imdb you will not find the film or most of the actors.

The film is not without its merits, but I like all vampire films and find something of interest in all of them. However, if you are chasing the original, keep looking!",1211673600,8,599,5.372340425531915

An amateurish piece of work in every sense. Dialogue poorly written can't possibly be good acted. The lighting seems to come from old soap operas, where every set was flooded with light to save time on set ups. Just for vampire movie lovers to satisfy their curiosity, but don't expect much.",1209686400,,432,6.714285714285714
8220357,4,B000VWQTYS,"""Mrs. Amworth"" is one of the better low-budget horror films I've seen in recent months.
It's got a few good  scares, and it's quirky in some spots and  compelling in others.
The actors  do a nice job, and the direction and camera work, which is  mostly hand held, work with the story.
If you keep in mind that this isn't Hollywood, or one of the million dollar
productions that these days are labeled ""low budget Indies,""  you'll enjoy it.",1202774400,5,439,4.506329113924051
8220358,1,B000VWQTYS,"This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen and I can usually find something redeemable in any movie I have watched.  However, when it comes to Mrs. Amworth, I am at a loss to discover any reason that would compel anyone to watch it; other than they have a family member that had the misfortune to be associated with it.  The cinematography, screen play and acting were all dismal. At one point I became slightly dizzy as the camera swung from one character's delivering their lines to the other. There is no way that it could be considered campy or even mildly amusing, it is just a very bad movie.  Do not waste your time or money.",1201132800,4,639,4.352941176470588
8220359,4,B000VWQTYS,"This isn't your usual high budget hollywood blockbuster sort of affair, but it's campy, it's gory, and it's sexy.  Everything you want to see when you're in the mood for some horror movie fluff.  The dialogue is indeed kind of boring, and there are a few scenes which one is at a loss to discover their good purpose, but the editing is very nice, there are some surprisingly wonderful scenes and sequences in the movie, and the whole effect is charmingly, endearingly creepy.  In my opinion, the best actors are Mrs. Amworth (played by Magenta Brooks- worth seeing this movie just for her!  hot hot hot!) and the guy who plays the boss of the female costar.  The acting is appropriate to the film, serious, understated, and yet brimming with camp.
In summary, this is a good movie to invite a bunch of friends over for.  The horror is silly enough to have fun with in a group, but gives you enough real scares, and leaves you with a strong enough feeling of uneasiness, that it's not quite MST3K enough to just make fun of.
Watch this for a fun, spooky, sexy, gothy evening.",1198281600,14,1074,4.510309278350515
