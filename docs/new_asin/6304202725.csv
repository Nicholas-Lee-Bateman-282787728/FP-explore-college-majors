811087,3,6304202725,"Andy Griffith saves what little there is to this unabashed spy spoof. You may remember Andy in several TV series as Mayberry R.F.D. and Matlock. Andy playing General Rancor in this film is spoofing General Midwinter (Ed Begley) in ""Billion Dollar Brain"" (1967).

The standard story is General Rancor will destroy the world once he gets his computer chip the same chip that cannot be destroyed as it can cure world hunger. Of course, there is an imprisoned father scientist being sought by an overtly sexy daughter who incorporates the help of WD-40, a slippery agent.",1509580800,,567,4.90625

Then I re-watched the trailer.

And yes, for the 1st half of the trailer I was still convinced that I hadn't seen the actual movie, but then I remembered little bits that were not part of the trailer. So . . . that says something. I'm a huge fan of silly comedy: Naked Gun, etc. The trailer reminded me, but really the trailer was the bulk of the funnies. It's like the trailer but with stuff in between the laughs.

811331,4,6304202725,"Just like with all the Naked Gun Trilogy, on a count of all the site gags, unorthodox comedy, slapstick, and the kind of blunt person that Leslie Nielsen was always gifted with being in his older years, and not to mention having a famous old time star like Andy Griffith have the role as the main villain, and the kind of role that a child most well known for playing Dennis the Menace just several years before this plays in this kind of film, and of course the cameo of Weird Al Yankovic and the whole deal with him during the beginning credits, this is a great comedy even to the level where any of it could cause you to laugh so hard as to bring tears to your eyes. But, just like with the Naked Gun trilogy which also starred Leslie Nielson and with the same kind of role and personality, the only problem with it is the magnitude of innuendo and any tiny bits of nudity and sexual content not to mention language that it is marred with.

It started out at a snails pace and seemed equally strained for laughter. However, there was a smattering of truly insightful comic genius throughout that made it mildly enjoyable. Then I watched it on video with a group of people. For some unknown reason I found myself laughing uncontrollably. As I watched the film again I then began to notice how much it followed the spy genre in parody. Once I began to realize what the filmmakers were doing it all started to take shape a made good comic sense. Not only did it follow the same inspirational format of AIRPLANE but it took the same approach with its audience: if this joke doesnt work for you we have plenty more lined up one after another and eventually you are going to start laughing. Whats interesting is that you actually have to listen carefully to what is being said to really get the full effect of this well thought out comedy because it is much more than just a parody.",1381536000,,1056,4.392857142857143

Spy Hard, following in the footsteps of Date Movie, Epic Movie, Shriek if You Know What I Did Last Friday the 13th, and the Scary Movie series, is a parody of several films including James Bond, Home Alone, Pulp Fiction, and even Jurassic Park among others.
It is a humorous movie... at times.  The casting is good, though most of the dialogues could have been a lot better.  What it comes down to is that they could have and should have worked on the humor much more.
The girls are a great addition; Nicolette Sheridan was simply AMAZING!

However, if you're in the right mood, it can be a entertaining way to spend an hour and a half.  Leslie Nielsen plays agent WD-40 who sets out to rescue agent Barbara Dahl (Stephanie Romanov) from the evil and prosthetic clutches of Doctor Rancor (Andy Griffith.)  Beginning and end of story.  Along the way, viewers are treated to send-ups of various movies and celebrity personalities.  The humor is erratic, as the script is burdened with  groaners and jokes that simply don't work as much as it is carried along with its laugh out loud moments.  The sophomoric comedy often works because of the element of surprise:  the best laughs come when the viewer is least expecting them.  It helps if you're familiar with many of the films that ""Spy Hard"" parodies.  The only brilliant part of this film is the Weird Al Yankovic segment during the opening credits.  It is so funny on its own that it warms up the audience for more laughs.  I don't think I would have been so willing to find humor in the silliness if Weird Al hadn't already started me laughing.
This is pure sophomoric, spoof comedy in the spirit of National Lampoon and Saturday Night Live - all, of course, with the distinctive touch of Leslie Nielsen.

Although Spy Hard is not as horrible as that one, it still in no way measures up to the greatness of Airplane! or the Naked Gun movies. This movie is probably worth a rental from your local video store, but I wouldn't recommend buying it. The best part of this movie is the opening title sequence by Weird Al Yankovic. It spoofs the typical James Bond opening credit sequence. When I first saw that at the theater, I almost fell out of my seat from laughing so hard. The opening credits alone may be the best reason to see this movie. After that, it's a so-so movie with some funny parts but mostly gags that fall flat.",1073347200,3,738,4.2785714285714285

With the help of the beautiful Veronique Ukrinsky (Nicolette Sheridan), there is a 'slim and remote' possibility that they might succeed! Will the duo be able to save the world? Also starring is Charles Durning as The Director who has a love for 'camouflage and disguises', Marcia Gay Harden as Miss Cheevus (say her name real fast ;), Barry Bostwick as Norman Coleman, and Elya Baskin as Professor Ukrinsky.
Just looking at the names of the characters, I'm sure you suspect that this movie will have lots of puns, silly jokes, slapstick comedy, and stupid scenes. Your right! It's amazing how much silliness could be incorporated into this movie which parodies all forms of spy and action movies! The jokes at times work well though at times they fall completely flat. Also the same jokes are used a lot and come off a bit boring after many repeats. But some scenes do come off right and made my family roll off the couch laughing! Some of my favorite scenes:
*Leslie Nielsen's 'kung fu' against the Russian agent.*
*Leslie Nielsen and Nicolette Sheridan making those ridiculous faces at each other in the airplane!
*The last 'battle' with the good guys versus the evil guys.
But ultimately, 'Weird Al' Yankovic's opening credits is the best part of the whole movie! It was so extremely funny, he makes fun of some of 007 movie's opening credits. I gave this movie an extra star because of the great 'Weird Al' Yankovic.
So, to put it all together, ""Spy Hard"" is nothing special though it has many entertaining qualities to it. Expect lots of silliness and stupidity. On the good side is that the movie is one 1 hr. and 20 min. lots, it does not get too boring and repetitive. I recommend the movie for those who love this type of slapstick comedy. The movie is rated PG-13 because of crude humor and some sexual humor. For this reason I recommend parents to see this movie before showing their children, but I suggest that very young children shouldn't watch ""Spy Hard"".",1038009600,16,2254,4.737913486005089
811560,1,6304202725,"I remember heading into the local cinema with a few buds to take a gander at this pitiful attempt at humor. The only time I even chuckled was during one moment in the opening credits while 'Weird Al' was singin' the theme (I'm sure those who've seen the movie know which part I'm talkin' about). Actually, watching Al's head explode trying to sustain the high note the song's coda was kinda entertaining, too. But, other than the opening, I found nary a laugh in sight for the rest of the movie.
If ever there was an indicator that the sight-gag-laden quasi-slapstick genre of comedy filled with take-offs on other notable movie moments popularized by The Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker comedy team ('Airplane!', 'Naked Gun') was running out of ideas, 'Spy Hard' is it! The movie-scene satires (most notably Leslie Nielsen's impression of John Travolta from 'Pulp Fiction') all fell flat, and most of the sight gags were either totally stupid or were just ripped off from other Z-A-Z-style comedies, but didn't work nearly as well this time around.
So if you're looking for a similar spy-flick satire that'll actually get you to laugh on occasion, grab the underrated Z-A-Z classic 'Top Secret', and avoid this stinker at all costs!

To make things worse, the original jokes in this film are just as bad, if not worse. Spy Hard's spoofs are pointless.

811622,5,6304202725,"I have been a big fan of Leslie Nielsen ever since I first saw The Naked Gun. And Nielsen keeps getting better every time out. Nielsen is at his best in Spy Hard, reluctantly leaving 15 years of retirement to take on Griffith, who wants world domination as well as revenge on Nielsen for halting him. Nielsen in turn, wants revenge on Griffith for killing his girlfriend, (who literally slips through Nielsen's fingers and fell off a cliff to her death), during his last mission. I especially like the part when Charles Durning disquises himself as a chair as tells Nielsen he did it to hide from his wife's lawyer. I also like the part when Nielsen walks into headquarters and sees the combination lock on a fellow agent's briefcase and mistakes it for an Agency gadget. I liked Barry Bostwick as Norm Coleman because he sounds like JFK in every way and because Durning embarasses Bostwick, who wants Durning's job and doesn't like Nielsen. Nicolette Sheridan is a knockout, both as Nielsen's assistant and sexual partner. And being a KGB agent, she's smarter than hell!!! They first meet at an airport, then on Nielsen's plane to Washington, then formally at a resturant, where Nielsen tries to lie as to who he is, but Sheridan doesn't fall for it, as she already knows everything about him. All the while, Sheridan is worried about her father, who is the scienist who built the chip Griffith needs for his plans. So how does Nielsen calm her down, he takes her dancing at a club,(spoofing a scene from Saturday Night Fever). And as I said, Sheridan is a knockout. When she and Nielsen have sex at a fellow agent's apartment, it's the best!!! It's even funnier because while they do it, a missle passes by her window!!! Nielsen's parachuting in the beginning is pretty cool too, but the best part in the entire movie is when Griffith tries to feed Nielsen to some crocs, saying he would be their meal while he, as he puts it, ""plays Mortal Kombat with the entire world!!!"" I also like Nlelsen's lecture to Griffith about contury and service. As I said in the title of this movie review, Weird Al Yankovic's opening theme sucks!!! Okay, maybe not the whole song. In fact, the only reason i say it sucks is because at the end of the song, in the chorus in particular, Al screws up the whole thing by not adding anything catchy, which he does do in the first part of the song. The first choral verse is ""if you're gonna spy, you gotta Spy Hard,"" which is fine. The second verse is ""if you wanna win, you gotta Spy Hard,"" which is also fine. But the final part kills it. Instead of doing something cool, he just says ""The name of this movie is Spy Hard,"" And then he says you're watching it as if you don't already know. At the end of the movie, he replaces watching with just seen, again as if you don't already know. I don't really like the part about Nielsen's dental plan ethier, but i can stand it compared to the very end of the song. When it comes to laughs, Spy Hard hits a bigger home run than Babe Ruth himself!!! I like the first Naked Gun best of all Nielsen's movies, but Spy Hard gets a very, very, very, very, very, close second, and Wrongfully Accused gets third by just about as close. Spy Hard is worth one rent or a million. I promise you.",987984000,2,3257,4.448160535117057

Stephanie Romanov plays a dual role while Marcia Gay Harden is on hand as the agents dubious secretary. Andy Griffith plays the main heavy.

The first 15 minutes are hilarious, but from there the movie settles down into quietly amusing. The tone is akin to The Naked Gun franchise with its silly humor. The movie coulda done better on the female front, but Sheridan is likable and Harden has a couple worthy scenes. Additional movies are spoofed, like Pulp Fiction. Overall, it's a throwaway comedy, but it has its goofy charm.
