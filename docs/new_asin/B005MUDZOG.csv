4836947,1,B005MUDZOG,I did not find it very helpful.  It was way to slow for me..even though I do not have a lot of strength.  Too much talking in it and not enough movement.  Just my opinion,1411516800,3,170,3.8
4836948,4,B005MUDZOG,"I've been doing chair yoga now for quite sometime so I was hoping that this DVD would encourage me to continue.  Matthew does a great job explaining and reaching out to the viewer, but I was disappointed in the actual exercise parts.  I found them to be quite slow and didn't ""push"" me as far as I wanted to be pushed.  If you are new to chair yoga then this might fit the bill, if you are an advanced practitioner then you'd do well to skip it.",1390003200,3,445,4.091954022988506
4836949,5,B005MUDZOG,My handicapped brother-in-law really liked this video. He is wheelchair bound and this helps him loosen up and keep in shape.,1388707200,2,125,5.0

4836951,5,B005MUDZOG,I can only hope that I can take one of his workshops--He is the reason I got back into yoga--so inspiring--excellent.,1362528000,5,117,4.619047619047619
4836952,5,B005MUDZOG,"As someone with paralysis, and who used to do yoga before I was injured, I can wholeheartedly recommend this yoga program for anyone in a wheelchair. Since it's created by someone in a wheelchair, the timing and exercises are naturally quite perfect for those with physical limitations. The main goal of the program seems to be: relaxation, acceptance of one's body AS IS, and EXPANSION - which is normally very limited for those who sit all day. The feeling of expansion in the body leads to a peaceful, quiet mind.",1362528000,16,516,4.7444444444444445
4836953,5,B005MUDZOG,"I am facing some hard times. This instruction helped me in many ways. Thank you for doing this. I am not yet well, but I feel that I have found a direction, a hope.",1357862400,18,164,3.8529411764705883
4836954,5,B005MUDZOG,"As I sat across from Matthew Sanford in the cafeteria at Spaulding Rehab Hospital, I at once embodied my sensations of trauma, loss and disability and transcended them. As we were talking about my experience of yoga teacher training, he encouraged me to let go of apologizing for my 'flaws'. Before we began Sunday's workshop, we had an impromptu gathering during which Matthew said, ""The best teacher is a flawed teacher"" meaning that the most powerful teacher is one who can teach from their place of wisdom and vulnerability.

And that is why Matthew Sanford is a phenomenal yoga teacher for people of all abilities. He lived his journey, embodied his suffering and then went on to transcend and transform the tragedy to help others find freedom and fullness of life through their mind body connection.

The medical model of loss and injury is - when it's gone it's gone. You learn how to compensate by building up the parts of your body that remain. There is a focus on grieving for the lost parts and then living as full a life as you can despite the challenge. With Matthew's DVD, Beyond Disability, through the practice of yoga he offers a healing alternative. Through the practice of yoga, students who have experienced trauma, loss and disability can feel whole in their bodies through sensations of grounding, centering, balance and rhythm.

What is stunning about the yoga practice that Matthew teaches is that it uses the same poses of a non adapted yoga practice. ""Do what I say even though you are paralyzed,"" Matthew cues. A subtitle for that is, 'drop the story and open to possibility.' It's not about the possibility of physically moving muscle, it's about the possibility of experiencing living fully within the mind body connection. He emphasizes strength and grounding, certainty and purpose. The practice has the same elements of coming into the practice, building the practice and balanced relaxation or savasana. Matthew brings the heart of yoga to people of all levels of ability with his DVD. His DVD can be used in rehab centers, VA hospitals and for an individual's home yoga practice. After viewing it, I experienced a radical transformation in my yoga practice. I live with a spinal cord injury and am a trauma survivor. Beyond Disability is for practitioners and teachers, rehab professionals, and anyone who wants to use yoga as a vehicle to live more deeply in their mind body connection.",1349136000,31,2421,4.9

8479785,2,B005MUDZOG,"Easy to follow with adaptations for varying limitations. But very simplistic. My daughter, who has very little mobility, found it too easy.",1497052800,,139,5.363636363636363
