improbable situations, poor continuity and stupid characters
who on earth was this movie made for???
Richard Harris so over acted as the pacifist sheriff I think he he believed he was on a Shakespearean stage

8532094,4,B008XCT0MG,"The Deadly Trackers is a good revenge western from the early 1970s that has been lost in the shuffle over the years.  It's not a classic western, but it is a good movie.  Sean Kilpatrick is the sheriff of Santa Rose, a Texas border town.  But what sets him apart from most sheriffs is that he insists on not using guns.  During a bank robbery by Frank Brand and his gang, Kilpatrick even manages to corner the gang but when they take hostages all bets are off.  In the ensuing escape, Kilpatrick's wife and child are killed.  The sheriff throws away his beliefs of not using guns and begins to track down Brand and his gang over the border and into Mexico.  As he trails them,  Kilpatrick becomes as violent and vicious person as the men he chases.  This was a pretty good western overall.  As is the case with many 70s westerns, the violence is pretty graphic.  The Deadly Trackers shows the effects of spaghetti westerns, especially as it builds to a surprising climax. The men are unshaven and dirty, the towns look like rundown border towns, all of which makes the movie more enjoyable.

  Leading a strong cast, Richard Harris plays Sean Kilpatrick, the sheriff of border town Santa Rosa who seeks vengeance for his murdered family.  Harris goes through quite a transformation over the course of the movie, becoming obsessed with killing the men who killed his family.  Rod Taylor is perfectly evil as Frank Brand, the vicious gang leader who finds Kilpatrick on his trail.  Taylor is playing completely against type and seems to be loving it.  Al Lettieri is also good as Gutierrez, the Mexican policeman who insists on following everything to the letter of the law, which begins to wear on Kilpatrick.  Brand's gang includes Neville Brand as Choo-Choo, a man with part of a railway track as his right hand, William Smith as Schoolboy, a killer that's good with a knife and seems to be mentally handicapped, or at least slow, and Paul Benjamin as Jacob, the educated black man who finds himself constantly fighting back against his racist gang, especially Brand.  The gorgeous Isela Vega also makes a brief appearance as Maria, a prostitute who delivers a good twist toward the end.

  I recently bought a VHS copy of The Deadly Trackers and wasn't disappointed.  It's of good quality in pan-n-scan, no letterbox here, and is fairly cleaned up.  A widescreen DVD would definitely benefit this movie.  The locations in Mexico are beautiful, especially some of the ruins Kilpatrick comes across midway through the movie.  But for now, you'll have to settle for the VHS copy, which for the prices available, is completely worth it.  Check out The Deadly Trackers!",1183939200,6,2666,4.762008733624454
