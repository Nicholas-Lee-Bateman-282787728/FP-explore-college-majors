My very conservative pastor uncle was insulted by the natives' lack of clothing, but nothing is shown and I find it quite tasteful.  They are island people!  It's hot!  Come on.  Your kids are going to be too mesmerized by the scenery and the story to notice.",1354406400,,422,4.415584415584416

Meanwhile, the rest of the family are caught up in the arrival of a new person on the Island, but will they ever be rescued? For those who enjoyed the last video, the treasure hunt, this will be a welcome addition to the series, as romance finds Johanna and Ben.
