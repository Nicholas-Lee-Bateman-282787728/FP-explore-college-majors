8183280,3,B000O76TV8,"Set in Kentucky, Bloodlines (2007) is another low budget entry in the backwoods horror genre.  It incorporates several familiar elements, including strong family ties, kidnapping, rape, inbreeding, and references to cannibalism.  The acting is not always convincing, but after a shaky start, things come together for some decent action and gore, resulting in a film that turns out better than it first appeared it might.

Collegebound Amber Strickland (Grace Johnson) stops for gas at a service station with a creepy attendant.  A short distance down the road her car dies out, and in no time flat Amber finds herself a prisoner in a house deep in the woods.  She wakes up in room with two other women, Jenny (Tracy Kay) and one mean bitch (Mallory Durham).  Eventually it becomes clear that the Hackfords, a family that includes some inbred freaks, captures women for breeding purposes.  Pairs of women are first made to fight each other to the death, with the survivor then being raped by Billy Bob (Jason Padgett), the leader of the clan.  All about spreading his seed, old Billy Bob is also having sex with his sisters.

Amber's family ties are also very strong, as her brothers Brody (Douglas Tait) and Bear (Dorian Kingi, the son of Lindsay Wagner) grab their knives, and load their bows and arrows in their SUV, and head out to get their ""baby girl"" back.  They quickly pick up her trail, and after putting the gas station attendant out of business, head through the woods for the Hackford's cabin, taking out any opposition they encounter.  Amber and Jenny have managed to escape, and the Strictland boys find their sister, and head back to their truck.  Billy Bob gathers what's left of his clan and they head out into the night to hunt down the escapees.

The first part of the film is quite surreal and doesn't play very well.  The prisoners are not tied up or restrained, and there isn't a hint of the razor wire shown in the promotional material, and the door doesn't even appear to have a proper lock!  The women don't behave rationally, and have ridiculous conversations.  Amber and Jenny easily dig their way out of the cabin, without getting dirty.  Then instead of just running away, they head right where the inbreds can see them.  So much dumb nonsense.  The death matches are an interesting idea, but the execution is poor and unrealistic.  The fights are held in what looks like a barn, with a dirt floor and some short posts tied off with rope as the boundary for the arena.  No one with a half brain would be standing close to someone wildly swinging a knife, like the morons in the film do.

The story remains implausible throughout, all the way the sappy ending, but things do improve when the Strickland boys get involved, as brutal killing is routine for them, and they provide a worthy match for the Hackfords.  The chase through the woods sees the Strickland boys fade out, and Amber assume the spotlight role, extracting her revenge.  She takes some hard hits, but manages to bring breeding season to a close.

Directed by Stephen Durham, who also co-wrote the screenplay, Bloodlines could have been much better.  It features a few twists, but has a variety of story issues that could have been tightened up, and a bigger budget would probably have made a difference.  Taking a look at ""family values"", the film shows promise, and eventually delivers some kills, thrills, and gore.  The makeup for the inbreds and the special effects in general, are not bad for a film of this type.  It's not as nasty and graphic as it could have been, but if you are a fan of ""Wrong Turn"" type horror, Bloodlines may be of interest.  After over a decade, Grace Johnson makes a return to acting.  She is capable in a physically demanding role, although she does looks a bit old to be playing a college freshman.

Discussed in the commentary by Stephen Durham and members of the production staff, are the cast (a number of which were last minute selections), the locations utilized, and the difficulties of making an independent production (some involved quit their jobs to make the movie).  Bloodlines also has a surprisingly cool soundtrack.",1298505600,3,4157,4.745125348189415
8183281,4,B000O76TV8,"Bloodlines originally entitled Stickville was a really good little Indie Horror flick.
Beautiful Amber Strickland is on her way to college when she is captured by a gang of mutant hillbillies that hold women hostage, use them for death matches and for breeding.

The Strickland brothers,both good ole boys themselves..Brody and Bear get a call from the college saying that Amber,whom they affectionately call ""Baby Girl"" did not make it to the school,so the two of them set off armed with big knives , bow and arrows and other weapons of redneck mass destruction to get her back..

Amber is one tough chick and isn't going to just lie down and be abused she has plenty of fight in her ""It's the Strickland way""..What comes next is an action packed war of wits and weapons. We have fights to the death between Amber and some of the women and The Strickland boys and the clan of mutant hillbillies go toe to toe,non stop action..I really liked this movie..It had a cheap feel to it but I didn't care because the story and the characters were so engaging.

The only downfall were the obvious masks the really grotesque mutants were wearing but I got over that because I was so into the movie. Ladies Check out Bear,he's one of the Strickland brothers..HOT to say the least,don't worry guys there's eye candy for you too..I loved the ending and felt very satisfied with the entire experience.",1272758400,,1388,4.680327868852459
8183282,5,B000O76TV8,This is the first movie Travi Chappell worked on as 2nd assistant behind the camera. She has gone on to work on many projects in L.A. CA. Bloodlines is well produced and edited. Good job.,1248480000,2,187,4.371428571428571
8183283,2,B000O76TV8,"This film had potential.  The acting was passable and at times pretty good, but the screenwriting left a lot to be desired.  The abs were attractive....

Essentially, sister goes off to college, gets abducted by inbreds, and is rescued by bro & company.  Promising story line-- but the screen play did not provide enough support for bro & company go off and initiate violent encounters.  The writing was two dimensional in this respect.  Also, the inbreds used perfectly good bloodstock for death matches, seems terribly wasteful to me although it saves on the filming budget for extras.  The ending was reasonably satisfying.

To me the film simply had too many places where the dots did not connect, combined with areas where clearly the film was sacrificed for cost reasons.

There were some good high points-- the baby scene was good, the latrine escape was good, and some people weren't quite what one expects.

I'd move the film to a 3 or 4 if the screenplay had Jimmy Bob and Bobby Joe also picking up fresh young runaway stock from, say Louisville-- and Cleveland?-- in addition to help from the gas station rat, and only using barren bloodstock for games.  The gas station rat should have been better implicated (maybe a partly chopped Jeep in the garage?).  Stock ought to be in pens in the run down tobacco barn out back too, keep the goats in the house.  Pigs make a convenient disposal method when the deformed ones are done with the ""still warm"" bodies.  The baby scene(s) could be expanded and made more horrific.  The film had chilling  potential that was simply not realized.

Note that _Bloodlines_ wasn't shot in Kentucky, but a nearby state.  Guess Kentuck wouldn't provide any support, well, hardly surprising considering the topic.",1193443200,7,1753,4.845117845117845
8183284,3,B000O76TV8,"Uneducated, inbred freaks who live in a wooden shack in the hills!  Welcome to Kentucky.  It has to be tough to live in Kentucky or West Virginia when a writer gets an idea to do a film about inbreeding.  You know they are going to place it in your state.  Kind of like living  in Cleveland and hearing all the Cleveland jokes. (I know) Anyway, I am pretty sure that the folks represented here as denizens of Kentucky are probably not your every day regular Kentucky citizen.  As for the film, it was pretty standard fare in this genre.  There was some pretty sadistic stuff.  This wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen.  In fact, the last half hour was pretty interesting.  The rape scenes were hard to describe.  I guess any perpatrator would be unpleasant, but the guy in this film that forced himself upon the girls.  He was one gross-out hunk of filth.  You had to love him.  The gang of bad guys seemed to be pretty easy to dispatch and the ending with everyone going away happy was kind of lame, but if you are into a little psychological abuse and some hokey make-up work, you could do worse than this one.  Good for a one time rental.",1189900800,5,1143,4.350710900473934
