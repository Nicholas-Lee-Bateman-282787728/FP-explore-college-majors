1370078,4,B00004Y2QO,"Where would science fiction films be today if there had been no Flash Gordon comic strip or movie serial. Yeah, those rocket ships and ""Strato-Sleds"" look pretty comical shooting out sparks and sounding like over strained electric orange squeezers.  But  those who remember seeing Flash Gordon in the movie theaters will tell you, these serials had kids sitting on the edge of their chairs and bursting to see what was ""to be continued"" next week. I first saw my first Flash Gordon serial on T.V. in the early 1950's and I'll tell you, I found it exiting then. Now we can laugh about much of the bad acting and the ""odd"" mistakes now and then, but this is real film history folks. Check out the titles on the intro of ""Space Soldiers"" and see if you notice where George Lucas got the idea for the intro titles for his ""Star Wars"" films. I give this collection four stars for it's worth to any collection! RAM.",1024617600,26,909,4.503030303030303
1370079,5,B00004Y2QO,"All three Flash Gordon serials with all the episodes intact.  Well-transferred to DVD.  Buster Crabbe is handsome, even with the bleached blond hair, earnest, strong and unflappable: all you'd expect in a comic strip hero.  To be honest, all the actors seem to take their work seriously, even if there was an occasional lapse of continuity in the story.  No serial villain comes up to the level of Charles Middleton as Ming the Merciless (although I feel Henry Brandon as Fu Manchu comes close), and he is ably supported by numerous lackeys.  Middleton and Beatrice Roberts, as Queen Azura of Mars, manage to pull off a tandem villain performance that works, in the middle film of the trilogy, Flash Gordon's Trip to Mars, my favorite.  Flash too is helped by a strong supporting cast of comic book-like characters.  Most of the special effects are very hokey, making the films all the more fun, though.  There is plenty of suspense, both from the cliffhanger endings of the episodes and the evolution of the relationships between the characters.  Several villains turn fairly plausibly into good guys by the end. The second and third serials have good music too, including Liszt's Les Preludes, if I remember the title of the piece correctly.  The first serial is in the National Registry of Film, along with Citizen Kane, Maltese Falcon and The Godfather.  I enjoy other sci-fi serials like Undersea Kingdom and Crabbe's Buck Rogers, but these are real classics.",1014595200,192,1464,4.9346938775510205
1370080,5,B00004Y2QO,"I got this DVD Collection as a Christmas present.  I had videotape copies of the three serials but only ""Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe"" was a complete and uncut version of the original series. I grew up watching this serial on Saturday mornings on TV. It was a real joy to sit down and watch the entire series again. I got the whole family involved and we had a great time together.  We all agreed that ""Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe"" was the best of the series.",982022400,16,472,4.413793103448276
1370081,5,B00004Y2QO,"I must admit this series is a bit before my time, but I used to love watching it on Sunday mornings as my dad would brag about Buster Crabbe playing Flash.  The picture on all three discs is superb considering its age.  I cracked up when I heard the announcer mention the amazing speed of 1200 mph though.  Still, these old sci-fi shows have their allure, and I could sit and watch episode after episode and still want to see what Flash does in the next show.  This is the swashbuckler of sci-fi.  Any serious sci-fi collector will be glad they purchased this set.",977184000,9,564,4.384615384615385

1370141,5,B00004Y2QO,Just what I had hoped for.  I grew up on these serials when they played on our little b&w TV.  I had ordered a set before from another company and all they did was tape them from a TV broadcast.  The result was not good.  This company actually got them direct from the original footage that played in the movie houses.

I grew up in the early 50's in NYC.  At that time there weren't a lot of programs early in the day for kids.

Channel 13 was cartoons and old serials like Flash Gordon.  I loved them and I really enjoyed reconnecting w/ssome old memories.

1370204,4,B00004Y2QO,"This first episode is worth the price of the whole set.  A strange planet approaches the earth.  Flash and his beautiful companion are flying cross country, but have to ""bail out"" of their commercial plane (I'm glad we don't have to do wear parachutes any more).  They happen to land on a farm where a maverick ""mad scientist"" has just built a rocket ship.  The scientists enlists the ever willing Flash (former Olympic champion swimmer Buster Crabbe) to fly his rocket ship (why the ""mad scientist"" can't is not explained).  You get the drift...

Especially considering that they're about 70 years old. You can tell that the shows were taken from film prints. I REALLY wish they'd come out with a blu-ray set that was completely restored. But since that probably won't happen, at least anytime soon, this is as good as it get. There's a newer set with really cool looking packaging, but the discs slide into cardboard sleeves, which is a really idiotic idea for anyone that knows about dvds and blu-rays.",1394928000,2,627,4.814814814814815

Being a septuagenarian I can remember being plotzed out on the carpet in front of the old black and white TV, watching all kinds of stuff that my mother referred to as ""penny dreadfuls.""  She couldn't understand why us kids were so enthralled by Flash Gordon and other serials of that ilk.  I suppose the fact that she was lucky to have had a radio in those days answers a few gazillion questions.  Anyway, as far as I'm concerned they're still great fun to watch... and laugh your rear end off at just how primitive the special effects were and just how hokey the acting was.  I have to admit that Ming the Merciless was very well played, for the most part.  Still, you wondered just how the Hey he survived whatever holocaust allegedly killed him at the end of the previous serial.  Still, I guess that's what added to the fun of those old groaners.

1370217,4,B00004Y2QO,"My tastes in sci-fi run in 2 general categories. One is the higher quality stuff like Babylon 5. The other is the classic campy stuff of the earlier days of the genre for they can be so much fun to watch and giggle at. But sometimes other things sneak in that makes them interesting. An example is these movies show a snapshot of the changing fashions in what is being considered attractive. Princess Aura in the 1st film, a character and actress of marked presence, is replaced by the new standard of beauty that Dale Arden has already succumbed to. Slinky window dressing for the Hero to have around him.

Yes, the quality of these DVDs is marginal, but what could you expect from these ancient archives? If you never heard of Flash Gordon, I don't know if you will appreciate these discs...the story line is about as complex as a bad Kung-Fu movie. But, if you remember these from your youth, get them! If you enjoy costumed women from the 40's, you might like the ""good"" Dale Arden, Flash's main attraction. But he also had eyes for the ""bad"" daughter of the chronically evil Ming The Merciless' -  the lovely and talented Princess Aura. You history-of-cinema buffs will love the ""special effects"" of the era...time lapse filmography. See the ""Clay People"" and listen to the (actually kind of creepy) pipe-organ music that introduces them. Watch the ""Spaceships"" being powered by some half-dead bottle-rockets.

These serials show their age- the special effects are poor compared with modern movies and the plots are childish.  However, these movies were the best science-fiction they had at the time.  Flash Gordon and Buck Rodgers thrilled and inspired the children of the 30s and 40s.  Some of these children grew up and took jobs at NASA in the 1950s.  Flash Gordon helped America go to the Moon in 1969.  Will you watch all the Flash Gordon serials?  Probally not.

I got into these films because of the Star Wars Saga, and it's neat for me to see how Lucas was obviously influenced in each movie by these.  There's another, UNDERSEA KINGDOM  which also seemed to influence him on Phantom Menace.  Hope to check out BUCK RODGERS soon as well.  BTW - If you have an interest in learning more about these serials while watching, I'd HIGHLY RECOMMEND checking out the book about FLASH GORDON SERIALS BY MCFARLAND PRESS.

1370289,5,B00004Y2QO,"Only Filmation's ill fated animated series comes close to adapting Alexander Raymond's ""Flash Gordon"" comic strip this faithfully. The dreadful 1980 feature films doesn't even come close.

Despite low budgets & ham fisted B-grade acting, these three serials manage to be both decent-looking and action packed. The musical score is rather good, as well. And Larry ""Buster"" Crabbe is an action star for the ages.

Space Soldiers: The original serial captures the dreamlike, romantic quality of the comic strip while bringing Flash, Ming, Hawkmen and Lionmen to life, along with assorted monsters of the magnified reptile & man-in-suit variety. Despite some minor disappointments, this still looks great & is very entertaining. It really is amazing how faithful this is to the comic strip.

Flash Gordon's Trip To Mars: The ""Empire Strikes Back"" of the trilogy, this serial offers a stab at epic space opera with an almost tragic antagonist. Longer and more ambitious than its predecessor, ""Trip To Mars"" is a worthy entry in the series.

Flash Gordon Conquers The Universe: Drawing from headlines of happenings in Europe, ""Conquers The Universe"" is a (very) thinly veiled diatribe against Hitler. George Lucas drew most heavily from this serial in his ""Star Wars"" films. Elements are reminiscent of E.E. ""Doc"" Smith's ""Lensman Saga"" and Frank Herbert's ""Dune"" novels.

1370318,5,B00004Y2QO,"The three FLASH GORDON serials that Universal produced between 1936 and 1940 are still the best screen incarnations of Alex Raymond's popular comic strip hero, and this boxed set from Image Entertainment is the way to go. As Flash, Olympic swimmer turned actor Larry ""Buster"" Crabbe looks as though he literally leaped off Raymond's drawing board and landed onto the movie screen. The nostalgic rocket ships, costumes, and gadgetry likewise depict the original comic strip from the '30s to a tee. When watching these films today, one needs to remember that with FLASH GORDON, Raymond never intended to present a scientifically accurate nor even a science fiction premise. Instead, the strip offered its readers an escapist fantasy adventure, and that's what these classic serials are all about too: escapism and imaginative fantasy that's highly entertaining.

The initial 13 chapter serial entitled FLASH GORDON (1936), was the most expensive ever made at the time, produced on a budget of $350,000.00 which topped the amount usually alotted for an average feature film. Even so, some shortcuts in the special effects department were required. Keep in mind that although it was a lavish amount, the funding had to be spread to cover a running time of approximately four hours and shooting schedules for serials were tight. These limitations, however, don't detract from FLASH GORDON but actually add to its charm, which is a priceless quality often lacking in films today that have CGI effects.

In addition to Crabbe (who had his hair dyed blonde for the role), we also get portrayals of the other leading characters that are equally faithful to the comic strip. Beautiful Jean Rogers is perfect as Dale Arden, Flash's love - and Emperor Ming's lust - interest. The Dale in the comics was dark haired, but Rogers wore a blonde wig presumably to contrast with the other females on the planet Mongo who are all brunettes. As Emperor Ming, veteran actor Charles Middleton is the epitome of screen villainy. He essays the role with appropriate relish, especially in the way he uses his distinctive voice. Ming's daughter Princess Aura is played by exotic Priscilla Lawson, a former model and beauty contest winner. Of the two female leads, Lawson has the meatier role since it's the treacherous Aura who propels much of the action as she doesn't let anything dissuade her attempts to possess hunky Flash. Frank Shannon is Dr. Zarkov, the brilliant Earth scientist whose aid Ming tries to enlist in his plan to rule the universe. This plan includes keeping under subjugation various other Mongo monarchs: Prince Barin (Richard Alexander), real ruler of Mongo who was dethroned by Ming, the stoic Prince Thun of the lion men (former Tarzan actor James Pierce), King Kala of the shark men (Duke York Jr.), and boisterous King Vultan of the hawk men (John Lipson), who also has designs on Dale. All the actors play their roles in a straight, no nonsense manner that's well suited for an action oriented chapter play like this one surely is.

Nevertheless, the first FLASH GORDON installment contains a measure of depth that rarely surfaces in movie serials of the time. There's the continual conflict generated by the romantic triangle of Flash, Dale, and Aura. Flash is totally devoted to Dale and repeatedly comes to her rescue, all the while resisting Aura's persistent affections. Yet it's Aura who, in turn, comes to Flash's aid whenever his life is in peril. When she does anything that endangers Flash, it's out of her misguided aim to prevent another woman from having him. Meanwhile Dale is the ever helpless damsel in distress who never does anything to help Flash; at one point she even inadverdently causes him to be nabbed by Vultan! Significantly, it's Aura who's the only character to undergo a moral arc when she finally decides to side with the Earth people even if this means defying her own emperor father. It's largely because of this intriguing premise that the first serial is the best of the lot. In fact, FLASH GORDON was the first serial to be designated a cultural treasure by the National Film Registry in 1996.

FLASH GORDON'S TRIP TO MARS (1938), is 15 chapters which is two chapters longer than the first one, but that's because it relies on some flashback footage from FLASH GORDON to pad it out. It also adds some comic relief provided by a new character, reporter Happy Hapgood (Donald Kerr). Along with Dale ( who is brunette here ), the other principal female this time is Martian Queen Azura (Beatrice Roberts), who joins forces with Ming in his attempt to destroy the Earth via a powerful light beam. Produced on a lesser budget, TRIP TO MARS' art direction isn't as good as in the first serial. It does however feature the creepy Clay People who were transformed into such by Azura's magic.

The final entry, FLASH GORDON CONQUERS THE UNIVERSE (1940), was the least expensive and the shortest - 12 chapters - of the three. The only actors to reprise their roles are Buster Crabbe, Charles Middleton, and Frank Shannon. Carol Hughes replaces Jean Rogers as Dale, with Shirley Deane as Aura and Roland Drew as Barin. While Hughes makes an acceptable Dale, Deane and Drew are merely bland stand-ins for Priscilla Lawson and Richard Alexander. Aside from being called Aura and Barin, the new actors bear no resemlance to the characters as they were portrayed in the first serial. Even with these casting drawbacks, CONQUERS THE UNIVERSE is an enjoyable cliff-hanger with rousing music (largely comprised of Franz Liszt's ""Les Preludes""), above average art direction, and glossy photography.

Feature versions were edited down from all three serials and released to theaters. These are: ROCKET SHIP and SPACESHIP TO THE UNKNOWN (from FLASH GORDON), MARS ATTACKS THE WORLD and DEADLY RAY FROM MARS (from FLASH GORDON'S TRIP TO MARS), and PURPLE DEATH FROM OUTER SPACE (from FLASH GORDON CONQUERS THE UNIVERSE). When the serials were sold to T.V. the titles were replaced from FLASH GORDON to SPACE SOLDIERS and these are the versions many viewers fondly remember watching on Saturday mornings for years.

To modern audiences the original FLASH GORDON serials may not offer the latest in computer graphics, but they can still deliver good, clean entertainment in that special way that characterizes the era of classic movie making magic.",1283817600,8,6362,4.984934086629002
1370319,3,B00004Y2QO,"I'd call it goofy but lots of fun. The science is silly and so are the special effects, as Flash, Dale and Dr. Zarkov blast off to the planet Mongo to alter it's course with earth or something. The action occurs so quickly, it's hard to keep track of it, it's one terrible menace and death trap after another for Flash and Dale.

I particularly like the triangle between Flash, Dale and the pretty and treacherous Princess Aura, daughter of the Emperor Ming, the main villain here.

It's quite a bit of fun to watch once you get around the goof ball costumes and junk science, there's loads of action and it goes at a furious pace.

1370354,4,B00004Y2QO,"I purchased the Flash Gordon boxed set primarily for ""Space Soldiers"", the original 1936 Flash Gordon movie serial renamed by King Features to avoid confusion with their 1953-54 television series. I remember watching this serial on television in the '50s (I guess I'm dating myself) and I just loved it. You get to see all those great rocket ships and that ""hardware"" in their original form that were updated in the 1980 campy remake with Max Van Sydow as Ming the Merciless and with great music supplied by the rock group Queen. Those original rocket ships - man they still sound like old vacuum cleaners to me - what a rush! And for all you thousands-upon-thousands of Star Wars fans: George Lucas himself (he's older than me by the way) has stated that much of the inspiration he had for his Star Wars films came from Flash Gordon (not exclusively of course).
It's a little bit too long to take in the whole series (Space Soldiers) at once, I'd suggest a few chapters at a time. All-in-all a great source of video entertainment for anyone of any age. It can lighten up any mood and is absolutely great family fare.",1254528000,2,1117,4.59
1370355,5,B00004Y2QO,"Not much to say except that this collector's set is brilliant! First you have ""Flash Gordon"" which is also known as ""Flash Gordon: Space Soldiers"". A great adventure in which the Earth is threatened by the appoarching planet Mongo and its ruthless Emperor Ming. Flash takes off in a rocket ship designed by Professor Zarkoff in an attempt to save Earth and put a stop to Ming's reign of terror once and for all.

Then you have ""Flash Gordon's Trip to Mars"" which does have some pretty big continuity errors in it, but the story is just as adventurous. Ming has joined forces with the ruthless Queen of Mars to destroy the Earth with a powerful ray. Now Flash and his team of space soldiers blast off yet again to save Earth.

Finally you have ""Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe"" which is, in my view, the best out of all three. Earth is threatened by a poisonous gas from outer space. Flash and team blast off to investigate finding that Ming, still alive and well, is behind it. There attempt to save Earth will take them on an epic journey to numerous worlds where they face many alien dangers. This one is no doubt the most adventurous of them all.

1370356,5,B00004Y2QO,"As one who grew up when TV was young, and watched the Saturday morning serials regularly, I was pleasantly surprised to see that several of the Buster Crabbe ""Flash Gordon"" adventures were available.

Don't get me wrong, this is not high drama or great writing.  But it is reasuring to see that all one has to do to start a rocket ship is flip a switch and turn a dial.

Remember, these serials were made before jet aircraft were developed and the special effects are primitive.  Ming's armada of rockets, for example, proceeds across the screen obviously suspended from wires - they wobble back and forth while spitting out exhaust in the form of sparkles.

The question was, did I enjoy it?  Absolutely!  These adventures are full of the art of the 30s and soldiers dressed in the costumes of ancient Rome pretending to be soldiers from the planet Mongo or Mars.

And who can forget the cliff hangers where our hero is in inescapable peril only to be rescued in the following episode by the sudden appearance of Ming, a trap door, Ming's daughter, some ""clay people"", or any one of the other unlikely developments.  These were the mechanisms used to bring young movie goers (like me) back to see the next week's episode when the serials were first shown in the theaters.

If you are looking for adventures you can enjoy with your grandchildren, even if they may laugh here and there, this collection is it.

If, on the other hand you want to see how a truly advanced civilization can be defeated by a cowboy armed with a lasso and a 6-gun, get the Phantom Empire series with Gene Autry.

1370425,5,B00004Y2QO,"I first discovered Flash Gordon in the late seventies from the cartoon with Robert Ridgely.  Shortly afterward I discovered these three serials with Buster Crabbe.  The first of the serials came out over thirty years before I was born.  They were being re-broadcast on the local public channel along with the Buck Rogers serial as well.  Since I was in grade school back then my folks wouldn't let me stay up at 11:30 p.m. to watch. I had to wait until they went to sleep, snuck out of bed, and kept the TV down low.  Finding these is like finding burried treasure to me.  Yes, the special effects are almost non-existent, the acting is overdone in most cases, and the sets were pretty cheesy.  But, somehow through all of that, Buster Crabbe sold that character like no one else could.  He ""was"" Flash Gordon come to life.  Out of the many old serials from that era this one is the best.  I can appreciate other things about the show now that I'm older, like the obvious sexual tension within the several love triangles throughout the first serial.  That was something the two sequels lacked, but they are all great fun.  The picture quality is excellent for such an old series.  My only complaint is that there are no extras.  I would have liked to hear some trivia or something.  Next on my list is Buck Rogers.",1208217600,3,1314,4.508474576271187

1370427,5,B00004Y2QO,"This is the sexiest movie serial ever made. How Universal ever slipped Dale and Princess Aura's outfits past the Hays Office sensors, I've never know.  And for some reason, every lecherous tyrant on the planet is literally drooling over Dale Arden. No less than Emperor Ming's own daughter, Aura, commits treason just to seduce Flash.  In 1936, America was still in the midst of the Great Depression and any temporary escape from reality was too precious to waste just on the children.

The two subsequent Flash Gordon serials, in 1938 and 1940, radically toned down the sexual tension to as close to zero as possible.  But the legacy of the 1st serial lives on, in the imaginations of the generations of males who ogled Dale and Aura's midriffs, and in the miniskirts and aluminum foil bikinis of the original Star Trek.  Captain Kirk, a character who is believable only so long as one accepts the premise that a red-blooded Earth man is naturally irresistible to all women from any alien planet, owes his very existence to Flash Gordon.

The sexual overtones, like everything else great about this series, belonged to a unique period in time.  This is not only one of the all-time greatest serials; it is also one of the all time greatest comic strip adaptations, ever.  It is far more faithful to the source material and far more exciting than most of this odd little genre.  In 1936, because entertainment was so precious, adults as well as kids read the newspaper funnies, and I suspect Universal figured the audience wouldn't have tolerated any major departures from the source material.

The special effects are, of course completely unconvincing and even laughable to modern audiences.  For the audience of 1936, these images were perfectly adequate; their imaginations had not atrophied and could supplement the deficiencies. In our increasingly jaded modern world, where we need stronger and stronger doses of unreality, I find a certain charm in the handcrafted look of this serial.

Buster Crabbe is the absolute epitome of what this type of hero should be: handsome, virtuous, uncomplicated and athletic.  Crabbe had been a genuine Olympic champion, and didn't need steroids or hormones.  Flash Gordon is decisive; he is the kind of guy who figures out what to do and takes action. He doesn't waste his time with ambivalence angst, or ennui; his audience had no time for such things... people in the depression were too busy just trying to survive!

The rest of the cast is also great, especially Charles Middleton as Ming the Merciless.  If he isn't the absolute greatest villain of all serials, then he is certainly the standard by which all such villains are to be judged.  The other players, however, each fully invest their characters with total feeling.  Modern viewers not used to the acting style of this period are liable to think these performances over the top, but actually, they are simply exuberant.

This serial moves quickly and is always either interesting or exciting. It is full of great fight scenes, wild costumes and sets, buzzing and sparking electrical devices, and rocket ship dog fights.  The basic plot involves Flash fighting Ming the Merciless, who declares himself absolute Ruler of Mongo by the authority of his Personal Deity.  Flash fights what amounts to asymmetrical warfare against Ming, who has vastly superior forces and weapons.  Ming retaliates against Flash by torturing him and several of his compatriots.

Flash uses unconventional tactics; in one sequence he brings a whole city to its knees by sabotaging its energy production.  Flash also works with various ethnic groups, such as the Lion Men and the Hawk Men, finding areas of mutual benefit and forging alliances.  Although these people appear to be physically different than Earth Men, Flash seems to presume they are equals and treats them as such.  In the Depression, audiences believed that a red-blooded American would never tolerate a theocratic despot, that he wouldn't hesitate to fight for justice and to free oppressed people.  This is probably the biggest difference of all between the original audience, and modern viewers.  Truly, `Flash Gordon' belongs to a world that is lost to us.

The 2nd and 3rd serials are also entertaining.  The prints used for this collection are reasonably good considering the abuse they must have been subjected to in the 70+ years since their initial release: certainly they are much better quality than the prints I saw on KDKA TV 2 in Pittsburg back in the 1970's (Channel 2: thanks for showing these great serials!).  These actual DVD's are pretty low tech and kind of awkward, but they are functional.  Considering all the hours of escapism you get, and considering that this is primary material, inspiration for at least 3 generations, this collection is a heckuva bargain.",1207267200,15,4834,5.00375
1370428,5,B00004Y2QO,"This was the scifi I watched as the space age began to take off in the early 1960s, before Star Trek.  It has a special place in my heart, especially Buster Crabb, who was something of a masculine ideal for me.

Now I have bought the set for nostalgia's sake and I must say it is one of the best ones I have seen.  The pictures and sound are very clear, each story is broken into the original chapters (a full 4.5 hours per disk), and there are no silly add-ons to beef up the price.  It is an excellent deal and wonderful addition to my film library.

And then there are the stories!  At 5 I did not notice that Flash was a polo player at Yale...or that Zarkov knew Flash's scientist-father or that Ming loved Dale.  There are all sorts of details, some silly (the eagle-man king, volcan, tries to seduce Dale by making shadow puppets on the palace wall) and many interesting, that delighted even my kids, who have much higher expectations for special effects than I did at their ages.  As a history buff, I delight in seeing the influences of this modern mythology:  oriental despotism (well, stereotypes of harems, absolute power and vizier advisors), east european monarchic affectations, and Roman-like gestures and uniforms, even mythical beasts (winged men, etc.).  Of course, there is also the atmosphere of each world, kind of melancholy, but livened up by the idealistic humans who continually mess everything up for Ming.  Finally, what great characters!  I barely recalled Ming's megalomania or Flash's down-to-earth audacity (he thinks nothing of wacking an alien giving him trouble), though Dale is a bit weak as his foil.  I will spend a lot of time with my kids watching this.

Warmly recommended.",1205971200,3,1713,4.723905723905724
1370449,5,B00004Y2QO,"Being too young for having caught the original movie serial, or even the reruns on TV in the 50s?, 60s?, I bought this set after watching the new SciFi's Flash Gordon and buying a couple of DVDs from the so-so 1954 series (50 cents each DVD, beat that).

I'm in the middle of this set, but I'm greatly surprised. Forget about the special effects, we are talking about a movie filmed 70+ years ago. And being honest, this Flash Gordon has better effects than many SF movies I have rented that were filmed 20 or 30 years later.

Buster Crabbe is perfect as Flash, always a gentleman, always able to escape at the very last moment and save the day. Ming (Charles Middleton) is evil incarnated, the kind of guy I would not like to meet or work for. Dale Arden (Jean Rogers) is the classic lady in distress and she is very pretty. In a time full of anorexic stars, it's a relieve to know there were better times and see some well-feed chicks like Princess Aura (Priscilla Lawson).

I think the story is well paced, at least Space Soldiers and Trip to Mars. I have read some complaints about plot holes, but since I'm not very picky, I don't see any major problem. And the cliffhangers are well thought, I can only imagine the expectation of the original 30's viewers waiting another week to watch the next chapter.

My only complaint would be with the package. There are no special features (maybe a documentary about movie serials?) and there is no close-caption (I'm not a native English speaker) even that it is advertised in the Amazon page.

Overall, I'm very happy with this set. I would like to see a modern version of Flash in a movie, but I don't know who can fill these actors and actress shoes. After all, now I know that Buster Crabbe is Flash Gordon.",1205884800,5,1758,4.447204968944099

1370451,5,B00004Y2QO,"Like many posters. I watched this as a child and haven't seen it since until I purchased this DVD. Even as a ten year old in the mid 70s, Flash rocked for me. I'm pleased to say that I still love it after not seeing it since the 3rd grade.

First, Image has done well by presenting the full Flash trilogy in crisp detail (although I'm not a stickler for transfer quality). The pictures are absolutely flawless!

Secondly, this made a major impression on my friends and I as a child as it did for my father and his generation when it first came out. We were enthralled as our man Buster Crabbe (who was an Olympic swimmer prior to the movies) flew with Dr. Zarkov in Outer space to the Planet Mongo to save the world and fought off the hawk men, the ape men (some really ugly fighters with fangs and little makeup),the clay people, a menagerie of monsters, and the Emperor of the Universe himself- Ming The Merciless (played to perfection by Charles Middleton). Upon seeing this again, you'll be amazed at how much this has remained in your ssubconscious and how it all comes back to you after a few minutes.

Today, if you liked this as a child, you'll still love it today. Of course as an adult, you'll see through the cornball (but still impressive for it's time, such as the rubber Octopus that Flash fights and the cartoon rays from the guns) special effex, the appealingly hammy acting, and the sexual tension (especially between Flash, Princess Aura, and the fat sloppy King of the Hawk men who tries to molest Flash's heroine Dale Arden). I cannot speak on the impression it may make on the children of today who are unaccustomed to Black & White films from the 30s, but if you're game for it, it's LOADS of unintentional humor and leave-your brains at the door 1930s hokum that can be described in three letters: F-U-N!

I recall seeing a then healthy Muhammad Ali embrace an older Buster Crabbe during a televsion special, gushing, ""I used to watch you fight the Emperor Ming when I was a little bitty boy!"" See why the ""Greatest"" was so excited and get this set!",1205107200,5,2072,4.473544973544974
1370452,5,B00004Y2QO,"Flash Gordon  DVD

I remember seeing Flash Gordon when I was a kid on the big screen back in the early 50's. I remember going to the Saturday afternoon matinee for $0.25 (  if you found nine empty soft-drink bottles @ $0.03 each you could take them to the grocery store and get the money.  Voila  the price of admission.  If you wanted popcorn, find more empties.  The Flash Gordon episodes were shown in ten or fifth teen minute episodes.  At the end of each episode you were left hanging until next Saturday.  Would Flash save the Princess from the evil ___ ?  You fill in the blank.  Anyhow a cowboy movie typically followed Flash such as Hoopalong Cassidy or Roy Roger or my favorite the Cisco Kid (""Hey Poncho!"")

While I knew it wasn't the greatest film in the world, I still enjoyed it. It was a fun film and what really made me enjoy it the most was the soundtrack. How can you not like a film that has music by one of the greatest bands of all time, Queen. From the opening theme song til the end credits Queen hammers this film home with great guitar riffs and drum beats. Yeah the special effects are somewhat cheesy and the acting isn't that great but the film is fun. Flash Gordon is not meant to be one of those films where you sit there and ask why that happened, or why does his/her outfit look like that. You aren't supposed to pick apart and analyze this film. Flash Gordon is meant to be watched for fun. Sit back for an hour and a half and just lose yourself in the movie. I believe that if you watch this film and just take it for what it is, then you will enjoy it.

Highly recommended for young men or nostalgic older men.

FCGTU has the best picture and sound quality of the three. Pict quality of good+ to outstanding. Sound quality is nearly very good.  The sound is recorded in Dolby Digital 1.0. On many systems, it will come out of the center speaker with bass coming out of your sub. Some receivers and surround sound pre-amps may have a special mono movie mode which can drastically improve the sound. Many Pioneer receivers have TV MONO and this mode works very well.

FGTTM has a mildly warbly sound track.  The fidelity is good and is listenable. Hearst should have found a better print, even 16mm prints have better sound than this and would have made a better audio transfer with good picture quality.  I have better sound on my tapes from recording off of a tv station many years ago that showed the series from a 16mm print. There is about a 4 minute segment missing from one of the chapters, so therefore this series is incomplete. The picture quality is good to very good.

FG has a listenable but warbly sound track. The same comments that I made above applies to this series.

For those who have never seen these films, at the $17 price tag it is worth the purchase because it is the only decent print game in town.

I would have given this a 5 star review if the first two series had the picture and particular the audio quality of the 1940 series. So my review is in essence for the quality of the presentation. As for the movies themselves, this is the finest example of a film presentation on a low studio budget that has ever been delivered. The special effects are nifty considering when these films were made, but they are so beautiful surreal.
The firing of ray guns in the whole series is every bit as good as what has been done over the years and set the stage for other science fiction pictures.  The sound effects are first rate and memorable. All three of the series are set to a classical music theme from various symphonic masters and movie score composers at that time.  I think Franz Listz would have marveled at the way his Les Preludes were used In FGCTU.

FGCTU was the inspirational movie to George Lucas. Because of this film, he made STAR WARS.  He realized the importance of a classical musical score as well as nifty visual and sound effects.

In those days one could see a triple feature, the Flash Gordon serial, and cartoons for 9 cents at the Old Loma Theatre in Burbank, California.

Later, in the early 1950's they appeared on television for the first time. Even the adults were part of the audience. Crude as those early special effects were, they just delighted my whole generation.

Still showing on TV into the 1970s, they suddenly vanished from view thereafter and are only now available in their entirety on DVD.  Seeing them again is a revelation on more than one level.  It never occurred to us as kids just how overacted was Buster Crabbe's portrayal of Flash Gordon, and it's a hoot to witness now.  There's more unintentional humor than anything else in these volumes, but you'll also see images your brain has forgotten and you'll howl at the ""flash"" backs.  The impossibly goofy spaceships, the gila monster lizard dragons, The Emperor Ming, Professor Zarkov, Prince Baron, the great sexless Dale, and all the gang are here.

Who can forget blond Buster Crabbe, forever wide-eyed and stalwart, Charles Middleton's eminently hissable Ming the Merciless, bullet-shaped rockets on strings doing endless circles as smoke trailed behind them, the clunky costumes, Art Deco-inspired Imperial Palace, and a musical score frequently 'lifted' from Lizst's ""Les Preludes"" and Franz Waxman's ""Bride of Frankenstein""?

While ""Space Soldiers"" has gotten the most attention over the years, as the first of the serials, the second and third, ""Flash Gordon's Trip to Mars"", and ""Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe"", offer better production values, and more confident performances by Crabbe. Universal, while surprised and pleased by the popularity of the serials, never utilized the actor to his fullest potential, but as Gordon, he achieved a kind of immortality many higher-paid stars could only dream of.

I was first introduced to the series in the 1950s by a local TV station, airing chapters each Saturday morning, as a kid's show. What a joy it is, to finally see each episode, without commercial interruptions!

If you are a fan of the 1980, Queen-scored big-screen version of ""Flash Gordon"", and HAVEN'T seen this collection, what a treat you have in store! Max von Sydow's Ming is a campy homage to Middleton, and even the rockets keep the quaint, 1930s 'look'. Sadly, the producers couldn't find a lead with Crabbe's stature and charisma, but he was one of a kind, to be sure.

Do yourself a favor...buy the collection, pop one in your DVD, and let the kid in you come out to play!",1151539200,32,1881,5.0941558441558445

On the Image DVD, Flash Gordon Trip To Mars Chapter 3 at 53mn53s : Flash says ""It's one of the Death Squa-(sound cut, and) I don't see any more of them.""

A sequence is definitely missing, the two parts said being definitely opposite in meaning.

The shot looks the same but we know how movies are shot, all dialogue in same set are shot at once even if applying to different times and actions.

From a forum, someone detailed : Flash Gordon and Zarkov are being pursued by a Martian pilot in a ""Strato-Sled"". (The Martian pilot pushes a button at the top of his console, and you hear an explosion) Flash says: ""It's one of the Death Squadron ships right on our tails!"" Zarkov says: ""Man the gun Flash! I'll try to get him into position for you!"" (The two ships weave around and fire at each other, Flash pushes his button, and there's a big explosion) Zarkov says: ""Got 'Em Flash! Direct hit!"" The injured Martian pilot crawls to the televisor and says: ""Death Squadron Base Emergency!""(twice) The Squadron Commander, (Kenneth Duncan) says: ""Death Squadron Base answering. Who's calling?"" Martian pilot answers: "" Z- N 12! Look out for...Look out for..."" (he collapses, and his ship crashes into a mountain.) Flash says: "" I don't see any more of them. He must be the only one.""

The acting is campi and the special effects are cheesy but the fun is that they are.

I only regret that they didn't find a way to include some special features.  Then again, what is there to include beyond the simple fun of these adventures before Star Wars and Star Treck and all the other sci-fi things that came after these ground-breaking serials?

1370502,5,B00004Y2QO,"The Flash Gordon serial trilogy has been issues by various companies over the years. The DVD set is a distinct improvement over an earlier VHS version. In that one, the background music for the second serial sometimes was so loud that it competed with the dialogue, And evidently the VHS tapes could not hold every detail of all 15 chapters. So they truncated at least the introductions.

Now everything is completely restored on DVD, and the sound balance is just fine. If you ever got the annoying earlier set, now is the time to get rid of it and invest in the DVD set and set it proudly on your shelf.",1122768000,3,605,4.45045045045045
1370503,4,B00004Y2QO,"When I was growing up I remember being glued to the set every Sunday morning watching the Flash Gordon serials on WGN in Chicago. These episodes were great sci-fi back then and I was thrilled to find them again on DVD. With a little trepidation I started showing the episodes to the kids, ages 9, 6, and 4. I have been amazed how much they enjoy it. We are watching two episodes every Saturday night. The kids line up on the couch, watch it with complete attention, and hate having to wait a whole week to see the next episode. It has really been fun for the kids. My wife and I really enjoy it, too. The special effects are dated, but really, the action and story carry you along and it is a lot of fun to watch. For us, watching the old fashioned special effects are a blast, and for the kids the simple effects are plenty of fun to watch.

One thing that has made the series fun to watch is that we have only been watching two episodes at a time. Each episode is full of action, and watching them all at once would probably be less enjoyable. These episodes were originally shown one episode a week back in the 1930's. Each episode ends at a cliffhanger, so you really want to see the next episode. It is interesting to imagine the millions of people that went each week to the movies to see each episode.

The only reason to give it 4 instead of 5 stars is that the print used has little specks and a few sound glitches that might have been cleaned up with modern digital techniques.  It is not an edited version.",1122163200,5,1517,4.224137931034483
1370504,4,B00004Y2QO,"As a youngster, my first memories of going to the movies were of spending a nickel on a saturday to see the Flash Gordon serial, cartoons, and a (usually) ""B"" movie.

Flash Gordon was larger than life, everything was spectacular, and I just ate it up.

After buying the boxed set, not having really seen Flash Gordon in all those years, I wondered, with some trepidation, what it would be like seeing those serials through the eyes of a 60ish, jaded professional.

Well, after watching the first episode, I enjoyed it more than when I was a child. The costumes are outrageous, the acting is, well, incredible, and the dialog is something not heard ""since I was in the presence of my old master..."" In short it is absolutely hilarious. Even my teen age son loves it.

You have to give credit to Charles Middleton. Never before or since has there been such a screen villain. Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader just shrivel in comparison. It is worth watching the series just to see him sneer and leer.

Most people, having been born later, will be unfamiliar with the Flash Gordon Trilogy. It was, of course, the star wars of the 50's, but better. Better clothes (Dig that Dale Arden, and Princess Aura, ou la la), better dialog, and, for its time, incredible special effects (and I mean that in a special way). Space ships shooting sparklers out the back and sputtering as they take off!!!!  And the forest people; and the clay people, and the lion men, and the hawkmen, oh joy!
