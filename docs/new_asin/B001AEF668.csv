8277183,5,B001AEF668,Great product to have if your wanting to collect the whole series. great series enjoyed every minute of it. hope you enjoy as well.,1380672000,,131,4.5
8277184,4,B001AEF668,"This isn't what I expected from the kickoff to season 2. The group arrives in a futuristic world where a race is about to be held. The prize is a magical feather. Shaoran, Kurogane, Fai, and even Sakura are going to enter. The race is perilous. There is even a risk of death involved. They have 4 people competing, so winning shouldn't be a problem. Actually, it is a problem. Someone has it in for them and there are many traps set.

This is probably the weakest volume of Tsubasa yet in my opinion. I expected something lofty and grand after the great conclusion of season 1. Unfortunately this is just slightly above average.",1355097600,,628,4.508771929824562

8277187,4,B001AEF668,"I loved the first season of Tsubasa but this season feels a little different. The animation seems a little different, simpler, and the episodes a little shorter. It also feels like they are hurrying the story line, going through a different world all in one episode so you don't really get attached to the minor characters.",1219968000,,323,4.785714285714286
