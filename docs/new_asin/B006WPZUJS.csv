5025663,5,B006WPZUJS,"What a great video about the ""real life"" story behind The Waltons.  It was interesting to see the interviews and see some of the real people from the area of Virginia that created the Hamner family legacy.  If you are a fan of The Waltons - I highly recommend the video.",1334707200,57,270,4.2745098039215685
5025664,2,B006WPZUJS,"This dvd was okay, but I didn't realize that it had been shown on pbs in 1997.  I thought maybe it was something recently done and would maybe include more about the actors who played the characters, plus any footage that was shown from the original series was not very clear and looked terrible.  It is not a bad video, but would have been nice if some updated video would have been added.",1334620800,16,390,4.328767123287672

to bed in the evening , when babysitting them & watch my Walton Family DVD's.

5025791,3,B006WPZUJS,"Good for us Walton fans.  Not a lot of the TV gang.  People from Skyler, Town that the show based on",1362787200,3,100,3.7142857142857144
5025792,5,B006WPZUJS,"Dvd was very interesting, They could have put a bit of movie into the dvd. Very interesting about the family, Best of times but then, when familys were familys",1362700800,,159,4.517241379310345
5025793,3,B006WPZUJS,"fascinating look at the home town of Earl Hamner, Jr. and the rest of his family, including getting to meet several of his siblings.  I was expecting the focus to be more on the family and comparing them to their TV counterparts.  It was a little draggy in places.  Still would recommend for a true Walton fan...others, not so much.",1362614400,6,332,4.5
5025794,5,B006WPZUJS,because this one was fantastic. I enjoyed the whole thing. I felt like I was watching old friends. I feel sad that the years are going by so quickly. I am happy that The Waltons will always be on tape for all to see.,1362009600,,216,3.9318181818181817
5025795,5,B006WPZUJS,I really LOVED this. always wondered about the real characters this show and series portrayed and when i saw this I couldn't wait to get it and watch it. Was so cool meeting on screen the real family members this show is about. very well done. Made me want to go to Virginia and tour that Walton museum and might get to in the near future. Great show. I would recommend it to every Walton fan,1361664000,,392,4.171052631578948

5025800,5,B006WPZUJS,"This was all about the ""real"" Walton's family and the ""real"" Walton's Mountain.  Lots of stuff I never knew before.  I'm glad I bought it to learn what I did.  It is very dated though.",1358380800,,184,4.2
5025801,5,B006WPZUJS,"It was interesting to learn how the show came about....very informative and wonderful to see the real family.  It would have been neat to pair up the star and the family member they played but still, it was great to see the places and family that inspired one of my favorite TV shows.",1357516800,,284,4.3584905660377355
5025811,5,B006WPZUJS,"It was a good clean family show that we watched every week.

I'm glad they had a reunion.  It was nice to see the real characters (The Hamner's) and the people who played their part in the show.

I loved the Walton's.",1356652800,,217,4.119047619047619
5025812,2,B006WPZUJS,no waltons are even in this. it is all about the waltons musiem and how the thing came about. I loved the series and still do but I had hoped for so much more from the vidio that was not cheep.so I will think again before I buy a vidio about something like that.,1356048000,2,262,3.8703703703703702
5025813,5,B006WPZUJS,"This is a gift to someone who loves The Waltons, I'm pretty sure this is a mandatory video for any fans of the show.",1355875200,,116,3.875
5025814,4,B006WPZUJS,"I really enjoyed this video, as I never had the opportunity to watch the special on PBS.  I am planning a vacation to some of the places mentioned in this video.",1354579200,,161,4.193548387096774

5025816,1,B006WPZUJS,"Meeting the Hamner family, learning some of its history, and seeing views of their hometown, on which stories of Walton's Mountain were based, were interesting.  They are people, I'm sure, I'd like to know.  However, the last third of this video is terrible:  The audio and video break up, conversations are impossible to follow, and the quality is a great disappointment for the viewer.

I would like to replace (if possible) or return (if necessary) this video.  Thank you.",1352073600,5,475,4.962025316455696
5025817,5,B006WPZUJS,"What a wonderful video that shows the lives behind the Waltons. I loved the interviews and seeing members of the Earl Hamner family on whom the series is based.  For me, the best part was seeing the cast members interating with their real Hamner counterparts.  Viewers also got to learn abou Schulyer, Virginia where the Hamner family lived.  While the TV footage would not be considered high quality in today's age of DVDs, it adds to the interviews and takes nothing away from a good thing.  I highly recommend this.  ""The Waltons"" were, bar none the best family friendly and credible period piece that has ever been created for television.",1351987200,,642,4.8
5025818,4,B006WPZUJS,"Video purchased for my wife who is very happy with it.
Have also purchased all the other videos in the Waltons series for her and she enjoys them very much.",1351900800,,156,4.233333333333333
5025819,3,B006WPZUJS,"I thought this DVD was from a special on TV in the US which recently aired in 2012.  I didn't realise it was an old special.  However, I enjoyed it and next time I will check the information about what I am buying more closely.",1348444800,3,227,4.022222222222222
5025820,4,B006WPZUJS,"It was fascinating to hear about the REAL town.  Nice to see the images of the place today.  I couldn't help but feel sorry for the area.  It seems like so many small towns of these days.

Great to see the family members of the 'real' family.",1346198400,,242,4.085106382978723
5025821,4,B006WPZUJS,"OK.  First let me say that my family and I were and are HUGE Walton's fans.  Never missed it.  We have visited Schuyler Virginia twice.  The first time, Mrs. Hamner was still living and she invited my wife, daughter and I up to the porch.  She had a lady there taking care of her.  She was wonderful and I told her that I had interviewed her son.  (Radio man here.)

I enjoyed the video; but was appalled; when they went to use Walton's footage.  It was terrible.  I was pretty surprised.  It looked like old VHS footage.

Now; after saying that I thought the video itself was wonderful.  Loved the stories.  Great to see where we had visited and I learnt so much more about Schuyler Virginia that we didn't know.  I didn't realize that it was any bigger than around the Hamner home and school.

I would still buy it if your a real Waltons fan and put up with the bad TV footage.  In hindsight it was a minor problem.  I will make sure my granddaughter watches these shows on DVD; when she becomes older.",1346112000,41,1004,4.278074866310161
5025822,3,B006WPZUJS,"Since this is a new release product, I assumed (wrongly) that it was a new special about a beloved series, ""The Waltons"".  Actually, it is a special done several years ago by a Virginia PBS station, and deals more with Earl Hamner's background and family than it does with the actual show.  Also, there are clips from a Waltons cast reunion in Schuyler, Virginia.  Nevertheless, die-hard fans will probably want to add it to their collections.",1342828800,21,443,4.802631578947368
5025823,5,B006WPZUJS,I would recommend this for every Walton's fan! It was very interesting to see how much the actors were like the the people they portraid.,1342396800,3,137,4.52
5025824,5,B006WPZUJS,"Have the series of Waltons DVD's.  Enjoy watching these programs.  They are clear of vulgar and ugly language, a joy to watch.  The legacy dvd was excellent.",1341619200,2,157,4.7407407407407405
5025825,3,B006WPZUJS,"I would have wanted to know how poor quality the assorted clips of the actual television series, ""The Waltons,"" were in this documentary DVD.  The information was interesting in regard to the inspiration of the story, but it really is unfortunate that more care was not taken on the overall presentation, in respect to such a wonderful television series.",1341187200,5,354,5.0
5025826,5,B006WPZUJS,For a Walton fan...very interesting.  Could have added a few more behind the scenes spots but fun to watch. I have watched it several time.,1339718400,5,139,4.56
5025827,5,B006WPZUJS,It was very interesting to see the family the Walton's were based on and see where they lived. Liked how the actors grew to be a family as they worked on the show. Just a very good video.,1336348800,27,187,3.9473684210526314

5025829,3,B006WPZUJS,"The Walton's Legacy is informative and entertaining.  I only wish it had been longer.  I still watch for anything else on the Walton's.  I'd love to see a reunion again, although I know it would not even be close to the original.",1335312000,7,229,4.404761904761905

Listening to family members and crew speak and seeing where this all originated was great though just, it wasn't long enough ... left me wanting more....",1486771200,3,321,4.649122807017544
