8059173,5,B0009DWW36,A very accurate (word-for-word dialogue) depiction of the New Testament book (NIV). Acting and scenery is outstanding! We should see more of this type of inspirational movie.,1405728000,,174,5.481481481481482
8059174,5,B0009DWW36,"This movie also lets you know where in the book of Acts they are quoting from. It really brings the Bible to life and allows me to see hidden messages and meanings that apply today in my life. Wonderful movie, great price, highly recommend!",1371859200,,240,4.4772727272727275
8059175,1,B0009DWW36,"I was disappointed to receive the DVD and realize that it was only Part 1.  Why would someone sell 1/2 of a movie???  I did not enlarge the picture to see the Part 1 on it.  I wish it had been noted in the explanation.  So, then I thought, OK i'll just buy part 2, but couldn't find it anywhere and ended up having to buy the whole thing again.  So now I have 1/2 a movie that I can't use.",1288569600,5,389,3.753086419753086
8059176,2,B0009DWW36,"This video dramatises the Book of Acts (NIV translation). Though it has a large cast, it's quite an amateur production overall. Fortunately, most of the major characters - and some minor ones - are acted out well. Paul and Peter are both quite convincing, as are Tertullus and Festus. But much of the casting is mere ""amateur dramatics"" - especially the extras. Before ordering this product, be aware of the following 4 peculiarities...

1. In certain scenes there's sudden, spontaneous laughter and the source of the humour is not obvious. Did the early apostles have ""in"" jokes? The chuckling is not uproarious, but it's still a bit weird.

2. Although most scenes are properly acted out, for several passages Luke simply 'narrates' the story to his friends as he lounges around on a ship or reclines on a beach. For this reason, we never get to see interesting characters like Aeneas, Dorcas, Sapphira and her husband Ananias, Apollos, Paul's nephew or the seven sons of Sceva. Actually, one of Luke's own friends/shipmates dictates the lines of Paul's nephew as Luke smiles at him. I don't know what's going on there! There are other scenes where Luke is depicted proofreading his own scroll, which seems genuine enough.

3. Several place-names are mispronounced. Sometimes it's by omission of the final syllable (as in ""Derbe"" and ""Mitylene""). Elsewhere, the pronunciations may be right or wrong but they sound unfamiliar to someone who's listened to several audio Bibles (eg. I've never heard ""Cnidus"" pronounced the way it is in this movie).

4. There are two farcical scenes in Chapter 18. When ""the crowd there turned on Sosthenes the synagogue leader and beat him in front of the proconsul"" (v17) the other actors barely lay a hand on him! They merely tug gently at some of his clothes. Hardly a first century ""beating""! Are they afraid they'll be sued for injury? Also, as Paul leaves the synagogue at Corinth, he raises his voice saying, ""Your blood be on your own heads! I am innocent of it. From now on I will go to the Gentiles"" (v6). The Jews can be seen shouting abusively at him. Yet apart from Paul's own voice, which is clearly heard, there's TOTAL silence in the synagogue! Extremely poor directing in my view.",1214006400,4,2231,4.832460732984293
8059177,4,B0009DWW36,"Word by word dramatization of the Book of Acts. After watching first The Gospel of John I must say that this Acts is not half as good. In what sense? Picture quality, the image is not as crisp and clear as in John. And the acting: The actors should have put some more nerve or life into their roles. At times it seemed they were reading. Some have an American accent and some British, this was a little distracting.  The angels -of course everyone may have different ideas about their looks- weren't that awesome either. Their voice was disappointing, just as the voice of the Lord when speaking to (I think it was) Barnabas was like the voice of a teenager or a very young man: not very appropriate, I would say.

Not much to say about extras. There is no foreign language audio, and only English subtitles.

But putting away these little inconveniences I would say it is a very interesting and rewarding way of ""reading"" the great Book of Acts. The exteriors, sets, costumes, number of extras employed, etc are witnesses to a great production effort. I liked Luke, the narrator, he gave the right tone and was a good guide. Thanks Encompassed Runner for recommending me this one.",1179878400,11,1181,4.587677725118484
8059178,5,B0009DWW36,This DVD on the book of Acts has helped me in my teaching classes as it helped the students to understand what this book is all about.  It is very well done and word for word of the Bible.  Excellent tool.,1179792000,4,205,3.975609756097561
8059179,2,B0009DWW36,"The book of Acts is a book of power!  Sadly, this is what is lacking in the DVD presentation.  The minute I began watching I knew it was going to be a weak (acting) rendition of the story.  Thankfully, it is word for word from the Bible, which is why I gave it two stars.  Reading through the book of Acts one can almost feel the electricity of the Holy Spirit working in and through the lives of the Apostles and believers.  All of that is lost in the DVD presentation.

I would not recommend this DVD.  Stick to the Book instead.",1163030400,28,531,4.147058823529412
