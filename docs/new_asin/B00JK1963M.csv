But I didn't LOVE it, as opposed seemingly everyone in the universe (OK I found one Luke-warm review out of about 20 by major outlet writers - the rest were flat out raves). My wife loved it. My friends. So maybe I need to see it again? But 30 hours is a big investment in something that didn't blow me out of my chair.

It's about Danish politics, and the almost accidental rise of one woman - Brigitte Nyborg - a member of one of Denmark's 8 parties to the role of Prime Minister  after her less- pragmatic, better known male rivals self-destruct. It followers her, and those around her -- her team, the press, her political rivals -- as they try to stay balanced in the always choppy and morally confusing world of politics.

There's no question the show is extremely well acted. And the characters cover a wide range of jobs, temperaments, levels of honesty and ethics, while almost all remaining human beings (I do wish the leader of the far right party wasn't quite such a cartoon). The human problems the lead character faces as the pressure of high office takes its tolls on both her family and her ethics are believable and moving. And I loved that all the major characters are allowed to be flawed and make bad decisions while still being treated as decent people at heart.

Yet, for me there was something a bit too neat, a bit too old-school in the show's 'crisis of the week' approach, where almost every episode sometimes wildly complex political issues and situations manage to get resolved. While the personal issues are allowed to work in a more serialized way, evolving slowly over time, I don't love how the show pushes to close the book on a brand new political crisis almost every episode. It leads the show to need sudden convenient twists that can feel melodramatic at times, and sometimes makes our heroine just a little too perfect, a little too much smarter than everyone in the room for me to buy it.

Warning: mild, general spoilers for the 3rd season ahead

In the series' 3rd (and last) season, there was, for me, some compromise of what had seemed the show's own moral core. While I applaud the idea -- so lost in the US -- that effective politics is largely about pragmatism and compromise, in the show's 3rd season it starts to feel like Brigitte has become ALL about pragmatism and compromise to get what she wants , and that the show itself isn't seriously challenging her shift. Without some ideological, moral core I found it harder to care who won out. There is a clever last second reprieve that solves the problem to a certain extent. But I spent a lot of the last season feeling increasingly uncomfortable that the series itself DIDN'T seem to be uncomfortable, as it's heroine increasingly seemed a woman whose talents were exploiting the political machinery as an end in itself -- without deeply, critically questioning her character, or making us face the intriguing but uncomfortable possibility that perhaps she isn't the truly good hearted, nobly intended politician we all wished for, and that she had always seemed to be.

None-the-less, a LOT is good in the show, and given it's near universal enthusiastic embrace (and the fact I certainly quite liked it, even if I didn't love it) I may just be forced to hang onto my blu-ray set, and one day give it another go.",1458604800,,3356,4.630252100840337
8651626,3,B00JK1963M,"The final season of Borgen picks up about 2 years after season 2, and the changes are immediately apparent.  Birgitte has left elected office for the executive suite, which guarantees that she will be helicopter-hopping skyscrapers in the far-east instead of jockeying party-bosses at home, and also wearing more expensive clothes.  Birgitte goes on lecture tours but stays out of politics.  Kasper and Katrine have had a child, but now share nothing else.  Kasper is no longer a spin doctor, having reentered journalism (the minimal differences between the two are commented on by the end of the show) and grown out his hair, Kasper has a new life.  Like Kasper, Denmark has found a new life without Nyborg.  To prove that point, Hesselboe has his old job back as PM, while Jakob Kruse  Birgittes protg at in the Moderate party  now leads the Moderates, taking them in directions that are closer to Hesselboes Liberal party (its center-right) and further away from its left-wing roots.

When the Moderates support a bill guaranteed to drastically ramp up deportation of immigrants, Birgitte attempts a return to politics.  Despite a warm reception, Birgittes return is thwarted (her colleagues remember her fondly, but prefer her as a memory than a colleague) leading her to make one of the most dangerous decisions of her political career  to form a new political party.  In varying turns, Birgittes new party is a novelty, a joke, a danger and ultimately a contender.

The last season left me unsatisfied.  When you love a show enough, you can be sure that youll be left hungry, but Borgen feels like its trying to avoid developing more than it can handle in a few episodes.  (The entire series amounts to 30 episodes, compared to 20-23 episodes for just one full season of a show like The West Wing to which Borgen is frequently compared.)  Also, the show is handicapped by placing so much of its action outside of elected office.  I can understand that they wanted to do something different, but the last season discards a lot of what made the first 2 seasons so watchable  the political maneuvering, meaty hot-button issues (ironically one of the big ones is the raising of pork in Denmark; compare that to criminalization of juveniles last season, or the Americans movement of GwoT detainees through Danish air bases in season 1) , Kaspar and Birgittes sparring and Kaspars relationship with Katrine - without a suitably compelling replacement.  Much like Kaspar, the show escapes its true love for a bunch of forgettable one-night stands.  Despite just 10 episodes, the show manages to have gaps, unwisely filled by a running subplot involving Torben being undone by a midlife crisis and also by a new and younger supervisor determined to make TV1 more entertaining no matter how ridiculous it becomes.

Most conspicuous of all is that the show seems tired of its characters, including those who had a lot to do with where Birgitte ended up.  Laugesen, the shows hardwired heel, gets just a couple of halfhearted scenes (and one in which gets to be suitably cruel), making it difficult to remember that he started the show as the head of one of Denmarks most powerful political parties, and also despite his having gotten the ball running by releasing that dirt on Hesselboes wife in the series opener. Bent, Birgittes mentor, reacts badly to Birgittes decision to form a new party, but proves suitably unwilling to let that be an obstacle.  Phillip is backat times.  Despite Birgittes exit from politics (and other developments in their lives) they're still apart when the series starts, and Phillip spends little time on the show.  The new characters are an interesting mix, emerging different sides of the political arena, but seldom act as more than a chorus for the political dialog.  As in the first season, Birgitte is the unintended beneficiary of unsavory choices made by other people, and never herself tests the audiences love by stooping to her rivals level.  (Without spoiling things, Birgitte does come close to going over to the dark side  again saved by the intercession of others.)  Only unlike season 1, we know were watching the end of the show, and the likelihood is that Birgitte will never have to face up for her actions.

In a particularly awkward moment, one of the characters of the show  hoping to land a new job  is bluntly told to swallow pride and make-up with an unfriendly boss.  There is no new job, as the applicant just isn't sexy enough these days to be taken on.  Remembering that line, I got the idea that it originated not from a character, but from writers themselves, sheepishly trying to explain the dearth of ideas and maturity in this great shows swansong.

NO MATTER WHAT I THOUGHT OF THE SHOW, STUFF I LEARNED ON BORGEN MAKES DENMARK ATTRACTIVE:
There apparently is no original Danish phrase for negative campaigning.",1426636800,,4871,4.877278250303767
