8053118,5,B0007X1NV0,"this whole series is amazing, I'm kind of sad that they stopped production on the dvds but i think there are enough out there to get a complete set.

TV 28 its self has some of the best episodes. in particular ""dimensional rift: wheres darling"" which was an anime filler that best exemplifies Mamoru Oshii's directing style, and how he uses visuals to convey the bulk of the story.",1367366400,,381,4.521739130434782
