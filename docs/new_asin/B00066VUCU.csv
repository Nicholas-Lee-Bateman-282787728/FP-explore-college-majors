8039390,4,B00066VUCU,"""Salt & Pepper"" is a real groove.  Director Richard Donner weaves a tightly knit vehicle with thrills and spills.  The rapport between Sammy Davis, Jr. and Peter Lawford is indelible.  Swinging London shines in all its glory.  Michael Bates, better known as the cellblock captain in ""A Clockwork Orange"", is a hoot as the harried police inspector.  And Sammy does a mean Bogart and Cagney to boot!  Five stars.
""One More Time"" reeks of near desperation.  Sammy and Pete don't seem to be playing the same characters from the first film at all.  In Sammy's case he seems to think he's in a Martin and Lewis vehicle playing the stooge.  I guess he got his inspiration by looking at the other end of the camera where Jerry Lewis was directing the only feature that he didn't also appear in.  Two stars.
These films are sold individually so if you must buy one by all means take the first one.",1372723200,,888,4.528301886792453
8039391,4,B00066VUCU,"Two members of the original Las Vegas 'Brat Pack' produce and star in projects they obviously had fun with. The stories are silly with SitCom style humor, and the fashions and language are straight from the late 60's 'In Crowd'; a fun trip into nostalgia to say the least.",1324684800,,272,4.571428571428571
8039392,3,B00066VUCU,The great Sammy Davis Jr. and Peter Lawford team up to give fun and entertaining performances. Their talents and chemistry alone are well worth the price of admission.,1317427200,,167,5.0
8039393,3,B00066VUCU,"Salt & Pepper and its sequel One More Time are NOT great cinema. Its Peter Lawford & Sammy Davis Jr trying to do a mini ratpacker weekend twofer...Its great nonsense and fluff. However its a guilty pleasure for those who want an easier, tongue in cheek movie. So know this going in!

Note these films showcase Davis's talents of song, slapstick, gun & sword play, and mimicing others (like gangster George Raft, etc). Lawford plays straight man for shining Davis as he was for Martin & Sinatra in the Rat pack movies. Lawford has the brooding stare that you think is a dramatic moment... believe me, it passes quickly. Also note that even as bad as the passable see-thru scripts are, these films are well directed by two of the best-- Superman and Lethal Weapon's Richard Donner (Salt and Pepper) and Jerry Lewis (yes, the Nutty Proffessor himself directed One More Time)

This double feature DVD will remind many of the Rat Pack movies (Sergeants three, Ocean's 11,Robin & the Seven Hoods) but it isn't...Know this before you buy. It is not great cinema, it a throwback to the end of an era (the 1960s). So put your mind on hold and  just stay for the Davis antics and slapstick..to watch this man's great talent is worth a THREE STARS in any book
