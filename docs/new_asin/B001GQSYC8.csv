3618928,5,B001GQSYC8,"Trust Me is must see for any true afficionado of film and the film biz.  The story line sends up the ecosystem of aspiring script writers, desperate actors, arrogant agents and most of all manipulative producers.  A delightful perspective for any one who wants a light hearted alternative look at how movies really get made.

What bridges the cutting messages and the breezy feel is the charismatic and cavalier portrayal by Cory Pendergast as Danny the scam artist turned movie mogul almost in spite of himself.

Cory's big break is taking the character Joe - portrayed by the consummately talented impressionist Enn Reitel - literally from a parking lot gutter on a journey to fame and fortune.  Joe hides his insecurities behind a veil of dead on impressions of countless signature movie lines (a great night's entertainment would be playing a sort of trivial pursuit identifying all the countless films Joe quotes).

The film is full of subtle subtext and references that should entertain any true connoisseur of American cinema.",1239408000,4,1033,5.047058823529412

3618934,3,B001GQSYC8,"I cheated. I skimmed through this movie to the end where it really got interesting.
It sure seems like life has imitated art when compared with the 2016 election.
""Trust Me"", the perfect phrase.
With the indictments just coming out, whom will take the fall for the big guy?",1509148800,,273,4.591836734693878

3618938,3,B001GQSYC8,"I got this DVD mainly because C.F. was supposed to be in it . AND HE IS but not until towards the end and as a Political manipulator. A small part. However the story line was a basically good Morality play and interesting to watch. Done as an ""INDEE"" with a limited budget, it still held your interest, and the production people made good use of all available sets and props. Basically , a hustler stumbles across a lonely ,older fellow who has a FANTASTIC! mimicry of celeberity voices that he has acquired over the years living alone with nothing but movies to keep him company.  What then ensues is an escalating series of events that brings in money by the bucketfulls, however there is a moral issue with the scams involved that leads to a convoluted ending that ,yet, I found satisying. ALL in all, a good PG13 movie that the whole family can enjoy. A couple of questionable words, Acouple of staged scenec at the end ala Austi Powers type scene. But that's it. AND IT DOES ENTERTAIN!,Sincerely, LARRY ""O"" Pgh., Pa.",1252886400,2,1021,4.548913043478261

8306697,2,B001GQSYC8,"Oy vey! Whenever I watch a movie I always watch knowing that I'll be writing a review immediately following. Although there are tons of great movies, this is not one of them. It mimicked every famously sleazy line I recall and tried to jump on-board with the latest come hither line used in the last 25-years. This movie lacks any substance or originality and clings desperately to the backs of 3 cute, young actors.",1511049600,,416,4.635135135135135

8306702,3,B001GQSYC8,"story about a low level grifter scamming everyone around him.  Succeeds with ""Joe the Shmoe"" who is turned into a copycat of the woodenhead puppet Wholly Weird play actor Ronny Raygun running for goofernor (and later Presidunce) to spew the criminal purpose lines of organized crime against the American people.  Interesting as an explanation of how the series of felony abrogations against American human and civil rights which began in 1980-1988 were accomplished.",1510272000,,466,5.36986301369863
