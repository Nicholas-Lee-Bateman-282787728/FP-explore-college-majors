8595933,5,B00DPH7UYY,"What's with the bad reviews? Sure, this is a cheaply made movie and it shows. Several mistakes throughout. But I think the acting is actually very good! Eric Roberts is a true star, and Kristine DeBell is convincing in this role. I think Evan Crooks and Stephanie Shemanski have a bright future ahead of them. Plus the movie includes Susan Olsen (Cindy Brady)!

The movie is interesting and kept my attention the whole way through. My daughter loved it too. She is 5 years old and this is the first live action movie that she has watched all the way through.

I had to give this 5 stars just to get the average up!",1456444800,,614,4.37719298245614
8595934,1,B00DPH7UYY,Literally the worst movie I've ever seen,1446163200,,40,4.857142857142857
8595935,1,B00DPH7UYY,The cover is blatant false advertising (completely different dog in the movie). The acting is cringe-worthy at best.. so uncomfortable to watch. The plot and dialogue is atrocious. I honestly have no idea why Eric Roberts took part of this movie. The only entertainment I endured while watching this movie was laughing at how terrible it was... seriously. Don't make your kids watch this garbage.. just don't,1445990400,,408,5.104477611940299
8595936,1,B00DPH7UYY,The story is boring and the acting is awful. Eric Roberts must have owed someone a favor. The scenery and the dog (not a puppy) were the only things tolerable about it.,1442620800,,168,4.28125
8595937,1,B00DPH7UYY,"First of all the puppy is not a puppy it is a grown up dog. Second, there are only 7 people in the film. Third *spoiler alert* the puppy is not even magical. I could go on, but you get the picture. Would be a good candidate for MST3K.",1434067200,,234,3.795918367346939
8595938,1,B00DPH7UYY,Worst movie ever. I haven't seen a more poorly written movie since the Omega Code. The filming is poor and the plot is even worse.  The mom in the movie is trying to figure out her relationship with her boyfriend (of a year) so they are going off to a cabin. She is dragging her 17 year old son with them to the cabin..why?? I don't know wouldn't you want to go alone with your boyfriend? Oh my..Just spare yourself the time and pass on this movie.,1412726400,2,448,4.149425287356322
8595939,1,B00DPH7UYY,"DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE. The cover, the artwork, the dog depicted on the front of this movie all make you believe that this is a new movie and based on the ""Magic Puppy"" book series that kids love to read. ITS A CROCK! This is an old movie, renamed and repackaged. While the puppy on the front of the DVD is a cute little golden retriever, the ""puppy"" in the movie is a grown bulldog and although they intentionally made the cover and title look almost identical to the Magic Puppy books it is clearly NOT based on the books. BTW- the movie itself - sucked! I can't stand it when companies use these kinds of tactics to intentionally deceive their customers.",1383264000,7,656,4.341463414634147
8595940,3,B00DPH7UYY,"Caution...this movie was also released Oct 2012 as ""HALLOWEEN PUPPY.""  If you have already seen that movie, you've seen this one!  The box art is different, but it's the same movie...check out the plot summary.

Here's the Amazon review from HALLOWEEN PUPPY:
-Editorial Reviews
Horror movie buff ADAM WILDER's favorite holiday is Halloween, but this year promises to be different from usual when his best friend MOLLY (who'd like to be something more than that) accidentally turns his mom LINDA's boyfriend TED into a puppy when she attempts to cast a spell....",1375660800,10,561,5.076086956521739
