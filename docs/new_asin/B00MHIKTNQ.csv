6577929,1,B00MHIKTNQ,"If you have seen the hills have eyes original, this tries to be something similar, yet fails miserably. attractive victims are the only plus, but come nowhere near to excuse the editing, mess of a convoluted story, and horror scenes just turned too perverse and clumsy make this one to avoid unless you have no other options, a rerun of 60 Minutes would be more entertaining. And this guy has directed more movies, hope they were better, can't see how they could be worse.",1422662400,,472,4.630952380952381
6577930,2,B00MHIKTNQ,"This movie was a big ole mess. It jumped around relentlessly and most of the acting was terrible save one or two performances. The effects were hit or miss, mostly miss, with scenes where it looked like ""Seed"" pulled a sausage out of this guys stomach that was suppose to be entrails then strangled him with the sausage .

The story was virtually non existent except for a ""who cares"" twist near the end. The production value was, well,I won't go there because I support indie film, but I've seen films made for less and compared to this looked like Summer blockbusters.

I really hate giving bad ratings but I don't want my people wasting their money.",1422403200,,652,4.564102564102564
6577931,4,B00MHIKTNQ,"This appears to be a sequel but I can not find the first movie anywhere. Minus one star for the jump around editing. EVERYTHING was fantastic about this movie except for the editing, it's all over the place. It ruined the storyline and flow of the film for me. No element of surprise due to the editing, the story keeps going into a different direction with events and creative kills. Blood Valley Seed's Revenge has a notable GREAT cast, I've actually had the pleasure to work with many of the cast members on past projects/films as they are ""GRADE A TALENT"". Excellent FX, I did not notice any CGI effects what so ever (FX done old school, the way FX should be). Nicely shot, has an 80's style feel to the film, over all the film is a great psycho-slasher flick that will please its audience but as I said before, ""The editing ruined this film for me"".

8672349,1,B00MHIKTNQ,"Why???? This movie made no sense what so ever, the editing is the worst, acting is laughable, it clearly rips off classics and id like to at least give it credit for doing its own effects but it was horridly indulgent and frankly, i don't think they could afford CGI. Characters just show up for now reason, with no explanation. Dont do it. Just dont.",1471737600,,351,4.415384615384616
8672350,2,B00MHIKTNQ,"The film starts off with a woman being shot in the crotch then goes into a ""one day earlier."" Chrissy (Natalie Scheetz) is having a bachelorette party in Vegas and opt to take route 51 back home to Chicago. While traveling we get minimal character build-up but we do get enough information to make us expect the overused classic ""twist""  in this type of tale. Now when we flash back to the future, we don't pick up where we left off, but rather at some place in between, so we know what happens next time they stop the vehicle.

Film adds nothing new to the genre other than really bad editing.

8672351,1,B00MHIKTNQ,"Had a long review for this film, but Amazon turned down edits six times. All I will say now is this: Don't waste your time. It stinks and Max Seed died in the original film. No explanations why he is alive again.",1448236800,,212,4.071428571428571
8672352,2,B00MHIKTNQ,"""Seed's Revenge"" takes on a whole different look and feel than the original film directed by Uwe Boll. This one has a modern grindhouse/torture porn thing happening that comes of more like Suicide Girls take on the Hills That Have Eyes. It just really doesn't fit the bases of what Boll created with the character and his mythos-what little there was of one.

The special effects are half and half. The practical, bloody, full on graphic violence is still present in ""Blood Valley: Seed's Revenge"" , but the theatrical nature and religious overture of the sequences felt more ridiculous than artistic. Then there is that pesky CGI stuff that kills moments. Plus the moments that CGI was used in this film could have been done just as effectively through practical application. The soundtrack and atmosphere is acceptable, however it is over used a lot.

Overall ""Blood Valley: Seed's Revenge"" is a let down. The story is a thin, fragile spectre of the Max Seed mythos, with more torture porn attention paid than actual, purposeful story. Plus the setting and deeper development of Max Seed's character, and a few others introduced, just seems convoluted. On a positive note, the kills are gruesome, bloody and brutal. There is no remorse or concern for audience tolerance. The ending that ties into the first film is a really cool moment in the film but not enough to save this sequel.",1431475200,,1385,4.864406779661017
