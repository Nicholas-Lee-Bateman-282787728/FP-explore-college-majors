7972221,3,B00006LPBK,"BRENTWOOD 10 Movie Packs offer a variety of cinematic genres at bargain prices. Video transfers of their ""B"" movies are pretty decent, as is sound. The manufacturer's hinged boxes house DVDs adequately, but be careful the hinged sections don't pull away from the main spine! They're not that easy to reassemble.

""Carnival of Souls"" - After surviving a terrible car accident, a young woman finds herself at a carnival where patrons walk the line between the living and the dead.

7972222,5,B00006LPBK,i am a big fan of the bcieclipise 10packs. while i don't like them all most are good if not ok horror movies that you saw at 2 or 3 o'clock in the a.m. of saturday night. not all the movies are great but most are fun and for under twenty dollars it's a great way to build up your collection of old horror movies . as always if great transfers and widescreen movies are what you want stay away.,1145232000,,393,3.925
7972223,5,B00006LPBK,this 10 movie grouping has some great b movies in them . not the best transfers but for under 20 dollars what do you expect . great way to build your dvd collection,1136678400,,164,4.0
7972224,3,B00006LPBK,"On the surface this seems like a great compilation, however the DVD transfer quality is very poor (not to mention the irritiating distributer credits that pop up during the middle of the films!)  Carnival of Souls is still a great surreal horror classic, but you should try to find it elsewhere. There are no inserts or production notes inside the DVD package to tell you anything about the films either. This is a great lineup, but the films deserved better treatment.",1110499200,5,469,4.790123456790123

This contains two movies which are essential viewing for any classic horror fans, ""Carnival of Souls"" and ""Horror Hotel."" If you're going to get a budget-line release of these classics, they are included elsewehre in better sets with more famous movies.  Shop around.

""Carnival of Souls"" is a classic horror mood-piece with a creepy score about a woman stalked by her own death.  ""Horror Hotel"" is a British classic about a college student who gets trapped in a town run by witches who wish to sacrifice her.  ""Nightmare Castle"" is a dubbed Italian gothic horror, starring Barbara Steele as a murdered wife who swears revenge from beyond the grave.  ""Indestructible Man"" is a laughably bad crime/horror-drama about a resurrected criminal out for revenge.  ""Snake People"" is known as a terrible film containing voodoo rituals.  ""Track of the Moonbeast"" is early 1970s campy monster fun.  ""Dominique is Dead"" is more of a dull drama than a horror film in which a brother tries to weasel his sister's money.  ""Invisible Ghost"" stars Bela Legosi in the 1930s, with murders inexplicably occuring all around him.  I have not yet watched ""Wolfman"" or ""Death at Love House.""

The picture quality appears to be adequate, although the sound on ""Carnival of Souls"" is very quiet, as it is on all budget releases.

As I have said, most of these movies have been released on other (sometimes better, sometimes worse) value packs.",1104796800,9,1709,4.892361111111111
