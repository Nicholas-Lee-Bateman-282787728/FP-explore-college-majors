1817476,5,B00007K07H,"I've always loved Ginger Rogers, but rarely saw any of the movies she made without Fred Astaire.  This one, however, I'm happy I caught.  The repartee between son Tim and Mary is priceless as these two unlikely characters begin to fall in love, much to their chagrin.  Mary is a smart girl and understands completely what Timothy, Sr. is looking for, a way to get his family to pay attention to him.  What better way to do that than by having a beautiful blond come live in your house.  However, her basic goodness and sensitivity make it hard to lie to others.  She sets the household straight in no uncertain terms and finds love in the end.  The only repartee that rivals Mary and Tim is those that go on between Tim, his mother and his dizzy sister.  What more can you ask for?  Favorite line:

Tim, Jr.: You get my goat!

Mary: Where'd you get it in the first place?

You can't go wrong with this movie!  d",1140652800,8,911,4.319526627218935

1817509,4,B00007K07H,"The film ""Fifth avenue girl"" ( 1939 ) is quite interesting, however it's not the best Rogers' movie (on my mind). I like the story-line : simple and enjoyable. And incredible cast : amazing Ginger Rogers with Walter Connolly, Verree Teasdale, James Ellison, Tim Holt and Kathryn Adams as the leading actors of this film. Jack Carson appears as an extra in a short scene, I really enjoyed his play, pretty good.",1397088000,,410,4.708333333333333
1817510,4,B00007K07H,"This comedy was good for a one-time viewing of a movie we had never seen offered anywhere else, including TV. Ginger Rogers' role was somewhat serious in this comedy-drama with a message that family needs to appreciate each other.  Overall the plot and characterization needed to be fleshed out for this film to be among the better films Rogers made.",1391385600,,350,4.833333333333333
1817511,5,B00007K07H,We love old movies and this one is great.  They just don't make good movies anymore.  I will admit that the picture quality isn't as good as the movies they make now days but it is an old movie.  We still enjoy it.,1387238400,2,214,3.9302325581395348
1817512,4,B00007K07H,"This movie was very good, though certainly not the best Ginger Rogers movie that was every made. It had a good cast and was lively throughout. The quality of the item was fine. We enjoyed it, overall.",1376352000,,200,4.4324324324324325
1817513,5,B00007K07H,Another favorite movie starring Ginger Rodgers(one of my all time favorites)...viewed very well...have some hesitation about the longevity of the disc..it has a purple tinge to the play side and this sometimes indicates a limit on playabe hours...we will see!?!?,1357430400,3,262,5.575
1817514,5,B00007K07H,"I love any film with Ginger Rogers, as she is one of my favorite movie stars. Not just for her excellent dancing with Fred, but for her acting talent in more serious drama's of which this is one. I highly recommend it.",1356048000,2,218,4.214285714285714
1817515,5,B00007K07H,"Gingers Rogers is real good in a story of one who has everything has nothing and one who has nothing has everything They come together for a fun filled life affirming and learning time Very interesting and real
I recommend Good character study of how people forget whats real and meaningful in their life",1352678400,2,304,4.648148148148148
1817516,3,B00007K07H,"This is a very light and typical studio comedy from the late 1930s.  The actors are playing predictable stereotypes.  The story is fluffy and unbelievable.  And there's a happy ending.  (If you call happy the abduction of the heroine by a man she has hated throughout the film.  That same mentality, shown in many films of the period, asserted that women were happiest when forcibly kissed.) Ginger Rogers does her best with what the script gave her, appearing to be tough, wise-cracking, slightly wooden, and certainly no partner of Fred Astaire's. Walter Connelly is really the star of the film, playing a harried businessman, a part we have seen him play many times.

The one interesting surprise of the film is considerable talk about class warfare.  Two characters are Marxists and preach on and on.  At one point, businessman Connelly claims, in his mansion, that he is a victim of Capitalism.  During the Second World War, with Russia as our ally, Hollywood will amplify this theme, to its later embarrasment.

In short, there is not much here to attract the attention of serious moviegoers.  The film was probably well received at the time as a diversion from the terrible political and economic news that dominated the media.",1348358400,4,1234,4.913043478260869
1817527,3,B00007K07H,"I got this film based on the fact Ginger Rogers plays in it, However, it's not even close to a favorite film. However since all people have different taste you may love it. Rent it first before buying",1345161600,2,200,4.2894736842105265
1817528,5,B00007K07H,"this was funny good old Ginger Rogers movie, good movie for my collection glade I got it, very happy I would watch it over again",1341964800,,128,4.16
1817529,3,B00007K07H,"I'd read several times about Ginger Rogers' attempt to extricate herself from just being Fred Astaire's dancing partner and becoming a serious actor instead. In that vein, I bought this movie. But while it's okay, it's nothing to write home about. It is, however, several cuts above the inane plots in the Astaire/Rogers dancing movies.",1331856000,4,336,5.127272727272727
1817530,5,B00007K07H,Once again Ms. Rodger's leads you through a rip-rowing comedy mayham in this tale of helping one person while falling in love with another.,1307318400,,139,4.833333333333333
1817531,5,B00007K07H,"This movie made me fall in love with Ginger. I mean I LOVE Fred Astaire, but Fred and Ginger movies can be so predictable sometimes. You always know that Fred and Ginger are going to end up together.  When I saw this movie and Bachelor Mother I realized that I loved Ginger more without Fred (and Fred more without Ginger), though even together they are still my favorites.

This movie is my absolute favorite.  It's a surprise that it isn't as familiar. I'm so glad that it's finally on DVD! I've been waiting for years!

It's cute, charming, and funny. The end is the best!

If you like old, black and white movies, you'll love this depression era flick that surprisingly involves no dancing or singing from the fabulous Ginger Rogers.",1294876800,17,737,4.595419847328245
1817532,4,B00007K07H,"Although I enjoyed this movie I could not give it 5 stars.  This movie was made by the director of ""My Man Godfrey""  And since Godfrey is a 5-star movie, and this is not as good as Godfrey, I would have to give 5th Ave Girl one less star.  I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Gregory La Cava High Society Romantic Screw Ball Comedies.",1283212800,3,364,4.098591549295775
1817533,5,B00007K07H,Family provider not truly appreciated until one comes along to open the eyes of his family.  Great classic movie.,1283212800,4,113,4.947368421052632
1817534,5,B00007K07H,"This movie has no dancing and no singing.  And it might make one wonder how Ginger Rogers got featured in a non-musical film.  However, she does splendidly and the movie is charming.  A millionaire is slighted by his family and meets the strong-willed Ginger Rogers whom he convinces to make everyone think she and he have something going.  Well, the rest I'll leave up to your imagination.  But suffice it to say, that Ginger Rogers does her part extremely well.  And the movie themes of economic hardships resonate still (and especially!) today.  Ginger is incomparable!",1283126400,14,572,4.957894736842105
1817535,5,B00007K07H,"This wonderful film from the 1930's has a quiet charm all to itself.  Screwball comedy elements are intertwined deftly with a warmth missing from many films in the genre. Director Gregory La Cava produced and directed this film, putting the final touches on Allan Scott's screenplay as well. Walter Connolly and Ginger Rogers are marvelous as a lonely businessman and a young girl out of work, but making do just fine. The pair cast a lovely spell on the viewer from the opening scene.

Alfred Borden (Walter Connolly) has been forgotten by his own family on his birthday. On a bench in Central Park, he meets the flip Mary Grey (Ginger Rogers). Business woes, a philandering wife, an irresponsible son, and a daughter falling for his leftist leaning chauffeur all melt as Mary brightens his day with her take on life. The two end up having a great time, and when his family finally takes an interest because of it, he hires the out of work Mary to pretend she's his mistress.

There are fun scenes of the two partying, but mostly they just have Mike (James Ellison) drive them around town. There is a lovely magic to these scenes which endear the pair to the viewer. Embarrassed by newspaper reports of their exploits, his wife tries to buy Mary off through her son Tim (Tim Holt). He initially wants her gone as well, but then begins to fall in love. All Alfred's time spent with Mary forces Tim to finally pay attention to business rather than polo. Mary has good words of advice for his daughter Katherine (Kathryn Adams) also. Her presence has a delightful affect on everyone, in fact, but to her own detriment.

Mary finally breaks under the strain and confesses it was all a charade, and that it's time to end it. Rogers is wonderful here, giving an enchanting performance. It will be up to Tim to keep her from leaving. The final exchange between Mary and a beat cop captures the quiet magic of this film, which has been too often dismissed by modern critics. La Cava imbued a gentleness into Fifth Avenue Girl and Rogers is deceptively captivating in one of her best films from this period. A must for fans of Ginger.",1269648000,36,2126,4.601583113456464
1817536,5,B00007K07H,"A pleasant, well written story. Walter Connolly and Ginger Rogers are in need of a change. Together they push buttons, twist knobs and make it happen. I'd buy it if it weren't so rare.",1191801600,2,184,4.4411764705882355
