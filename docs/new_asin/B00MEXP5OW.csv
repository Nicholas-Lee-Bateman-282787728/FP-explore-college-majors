6575781,4,B00MEXP5OW,"Said it comes with a ""Finn backpack"" but it didn't. Instead I got thus chinsy plastic bag with a string attached.",1419811200,,113,4.428571428571429
6575782,1,B00MEXP5OW,"So, the main reason I got this was for the backpack.  It's a backpack in only the loosest sense.  It's a drawstring bag with two cords that you can use to wear it.  It's nowhere near as nice as the Finn and Jake hats they've done previously.  At the end of the day, you'd be better off making it yourself or just buying it from someone with mad sewing skills.

The show is, as always, super fun.",1419811200,2,395,4.077922077922078

13. Who Would Win - Finn and Jake vow to defeat the Farm; can they train hard enough to do it?
14. Ignition Point - Finn and Jake discover that the Flame King is in danger and try to save him.
15. Furniture & Meat - Finn and Jake decide to spend all of their loot and pay people to do random things for gold.  Hilarity ensues.
16. Sad Face - Jake's tail has a mind of its own and works at a circus while Jake sleeps.

Even though a majority of these episodes are from season five, there are some from three, four, and six as well.  Since we own seasons three and four, I was glad that the conclusion to season four's cliffhanger The Lich was included in this collection.  The same juvenile potty humor prevails like in other episodes, and there's no shortage of fart jokes. Our whole family enjoys this show and it's good to see that it's still funny and going strong in season five and beyond.  I look forward to watching upcoming DVD/Blu-ray releases.

This DVD sells for $21 and includes a vinyl draw string backpack. The backpack is nothing special, but my son likes it.",1417132800,9,2387,4.147186147186147
6575786,5,B00MEXP5OW,"This was a great collection of Adventure Time episodes that are a hodge-podge of favorite episodes from throughout the seasons. Even better though was the backpack that you get with this DVD as any fan will love getting into character with this accessory! My favorite episode thus far has to be The Great Bird Man, but all of the ones that I have watched thus far were great and even my daughters loved watching them with me too! The episodes are funny and have a wit all their own. If you have never watched this cartoon before, you have to take some time to check it out for yourself, as you will quickly see why this quirky cartoon grows on you the more that you watch it!

8671901,4,B00MEXP5OW,"Contains some of my favorite Adventure Time episodes, including the Lich series. DVD quality was good. I gave the item fours stars because the included backpack was unfortunately cheaper-feeling than the hats I received in two similar bundles. It's a drawstring-type (from the handles) made from thin material. I won't use it as a real backpack but I imagine it will still come in handy for a Halloween costume!",1428451200,2,411,4.971014492753623
