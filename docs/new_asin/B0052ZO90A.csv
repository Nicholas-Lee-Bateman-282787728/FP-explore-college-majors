8454891,1,B0052ZO90A,Horrible documentary.  Zero stars,1454198400,,33,7.25
8454892,1,B0052ZO90A,"As a REAL Alameda County Paramedic, having grown up and worked in this EMS system (P1656) for over a decade..I am apalled at the portrayal of who Alameda County Paramedics are..THE ONLY true statement that I witnessed during the whole film was ""One month here, is equal to a year in any other EMS system"". I do not know any of the ""IMPOSTERS"" portrayed in this documentary, nor did any of them work in the true EMS brotherhood of Alameda County that made it famous for what it was.

This movie is a complete waste of your money. I am very glad that I attempted to watch it at home and did not attend the original grand opening as it does not in any way represent the  real dedicated EMS employees who work, worked and died in Alameda County, making it the amazing and progressive EMS system it is.",1448582400,,797,4.342281879194631
8454893,1,B0052ZO90A,"If 0 stars were possible that's what I would rate this, absolutely horrible, it's not even a real documentary with real life calls, I feel like I've been robbed by purchasing this trash for 2.13 and am pretty angry I wasted 20 minutes of my life watching this... If Amazon is watching this a refund would be appropriate and please take this trash off and put a real Ems documentary up please",1428278400,2,391,4.444444444444445
8454894,1,B0052ZO90A,I'd rather watch seasme street...,1424390400,,33,5.8
8454895,2,B0052ZO90A,there aren't any real emergencies its all acting. If you are looking for real events i would recommend the tv show called recruits you can find it on youtube.,1422403200,3,158,4.482758620689655
8454896,2,B0052ZO90A,"Nope, sorry this is NOT a documentary. Pt are actors. No disrespect intended to the actual Medics EMT & FF in the video but this is a 20 min infomercial for AMR",1419552000,4,160,4.03125
8454897,2,B0052ZO90A,Not the best documentary. Especially as someone in EMS it just seemed really basic and not worth it.,1419379200,,100,4.611111111111111
8454898,1,B0052ZO90A,An AMR star studded special...just kidding terrible flick. Basically it was an infomercial for AMR. Must be the new hire video they use.,1416355200,2,136,4.956521739130435
8454899,5,B0052ZO90A,Good video for EMS education,1410566400,,28,4.8
8454900,5,B0052ZO90A,Very informative.  I enjoyed viewing it.  Wish it were longer.  Looking forward to more of the same.  Nice addition to my collection.,1397347200,,133,4.909090909090909
