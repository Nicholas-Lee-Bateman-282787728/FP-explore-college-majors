8255133,4,B000OUW4M8,Great insight into the developmental level of a toddler and the need to relate to them at that level instead of expecting them to understand adult language and communication. Great examples of real life situations and how to use the tools Dr. Karp introduces.,1390521600,,259,4.909090909090909
8255134,4,B000OUW4M8,"I encourage every first parent-to-be to own Happiest Baby on the Block. these techniques worked for both of my babies. I don't believe that some babies just need to cry it out. If they're crying something is wrong and you just need to find out what is wrong to fix it and this dvd has easy things to soothe baby. If this review was just for the Happiest Baby on the Block I would have given it 5 stars. However, Happiest toddler wasn't as impressive. I was expecting the same as I saw in Happiest Baby. there were some tips that did work with my toddler, but not all of them. So, I recommend Happiest Baby on the block to every new parent and at least go rent or borrow Happiest toddler so you could watch it when your baby becomes a fiesty toddler. :)",1372982400,,752,4.1931034482758625

8255136,5,B000OUW4M8,"The Happiest Baby on the Block really helped us to calm our fussy, gassy baby when nothing else seemed to work.  These are specific, usable techniques that anyone can do.  Every new mom should watch this DVD if you want some peace and quiet.",1200182400,,241,4.454545454545454
