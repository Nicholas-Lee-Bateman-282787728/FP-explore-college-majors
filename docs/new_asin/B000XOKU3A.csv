But, beyond just pronunciation of the word Chicago, it's the obnoxious way the announcer pretends to sound like a native which is taken straight from the super fans skit on Saturday Night Live. I really would like my money back. This one stinks beyond belief!",1415836800,,419,4.833333333333333
8228879,5,B000XOKU3A,Nice overview of Chicago always wish there was more of the tour. I hope they make another updated version. Enjoyable to view,1388188800,,124,4.681818181818182
8228880,5,B000XOKU3A,"This is a well done and very informative video full of everything you would ever want to know about Chicago, restaurants, arts nightlife, sports, shopping, transportation information, maps ect ect. This is truly a one stop resource for your getaway to a wonderful city.",1215043200,3,269,5.136363636363637
8228881,5,B000XOKU3A,"I recently bought this DVD for our first family trip to Chicago.  It was well-produced and cleverly laid-out.  I thought it was a helpful product, and glad I purchased it.

I don't normally post reviews, but then I saw that some yahoo posted a 'one-star' review because he thinks he's a comedian.  -not cool.

Regardless, though, my review of five-stars is spot-on.  If you've never been to Chi-town and are looking for a 'great pre-trip video of things to do!  This DVD is a must-have!",1214956800,7,486,4.647058823529412
8228882,5,B000XOKU3A,"This tour of Chicago was just what the doctor ordered for planning my trip. I liked the way it was broken up into geographical chapters so I could sort of see what was near what. (I have never been to Chicago before so that was helpful) I also liked the historical footage that was included in the DVD, since I am a history buff myself.  I feel more confident going to Chicago with this DVD as my guide.",1214956800,3,403,4.166666666666667
8228883,5,B000XOKU3A,"This is the second of the Great City Guides series that I've bought (the other was San Francisco) and I really enjoyed this one on Chicago as well. It was great for family-centered travel planning. We all were able to look at the different things on the DVD and pick and choose what we wanted to see. Plus, the DVD is set up so you can easily skip past stuff you're not really interested in, and there are sections specifically for families, which as a Mom I appreciated.",1198454400,4,471,4.363636363636363
