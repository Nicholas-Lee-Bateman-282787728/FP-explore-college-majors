4233603,4,B003ZFXE82,I enjoyed the movie. It is really dated. There is much racism and sexism. John Russell and Ray Danton are incredible as blue eyed indians. Interesting to see Kookie and and Walker in a cabin alone on in bed with no clothes on them,1286064000,,230,4.25
4233604,5,B003ZFXE82,"When will the people at Warners Video going to put a collection of Clint Walker films together in a box set? We fans of Clint are world wide and We all know how you blokes at Warners like to make a buck. So Just DO IT!!!!!

Yellowstone Kelly is a fine example of just how good an actor Mister Clint Walker is.
He looks like a super-hero in the saddle. A man ahead of his time. Today he'd be playing
in blockbusters!",1282089600,11,415,4.060975609756097

While growing up this movie didn't play that often on the limited TV of the day (60's/70's) so I was always looking for it back then, which gives me a nostalgic fondness for the movie.

4233640,5,B003ZFXE82,"Very good western.  Clint Walker plays a trapper in Indian territory who walks a fine line between the Sioux and the Cavalry.  The local Cavalry is headed by a hot-shot Captain who wants to make a name for himself as the demi-god who tamed the savages and put them in their ""proper place"", under the dominion and domination of the ""godlike, superior white race"".  The local Sioux are headed by Gall, a noble but intolerant chief who will not see his people lied to at the negotiation table and decimated, and his nephew Sayapi, a hothead who hates all white men with an insane but understandable passion.  The bone of contention between these two is an Arapaho captive female named Wahleeah, who doesn't want either of them.  Walker, playing Kelly is captured by the Sioux so he can treat the Arapaho after she has been injured by a bullet.  In her delirium she escapes to his cabin and Gall agrees that she can stay until the snows have gone.  Kelly and Wahleeah fall in love and everything hits the fan, what with pissed-off Indians, obnoxious Cavalry, and a love quadrangle.  Throw into the mix Edd ""Kookie"" Byrnes with his ""Kookie lend me your comb"" hairstyle and you got an entertaining Western.  Shot on location, I'm not sure where, but the area is beautiful.  The main Native Americans are played by white actors but they acquit themselves well.  Andra Martin plays Wahleeah with blazing blue eyes.  The Warner Archives DVD-R is extremely good quality.  Highly recommended.",1440374400,,1481,4.76078431372549

The Core of Great Western Movies created and made during the period of the 1930's- 1990's I don't believe I have ever seen from a heroic player the depth of acting as riding a horse with a rifle playing the heart of the star, catching the bad guys. Mr. Clint Walker as all the players were great within the frame of this movie. I loved the part where Clint Walker ( Mr. Yellowstone Kelly ) this greatly built mountain climber and beaver trapper seeing the opening up of the West. He sheds a tear or Tears in this movie on the account that young man in whom accompanied him, Mr. Edward Byrnes (Anse Harper) along with( Wahleeah Sayapi's Arapaho Native Girl ( Andra Martin whom Mr. Kelly has knowledge as he heroically, and surgically removes  the bullet from her spine. All these Clan of Events displays a temperament to the ( Lieutenant) Gary Vinson for his undeniably inconsideration for those he is in charge of to lead them straight into a Massacred event. The Lieutenant is irresponsible in his judgement along with the manuscript in war. Mr. Clint Walker all through this film so surprised me in Himself as an Actor displaying Greatness on Film. Mr. Clint Walker Playing this great hero of History in whose family from the East The Kelly's were a well to do family with some means. Mr. Clint Walker playing this fine gentlemen displayed in this Western "" A Human Being"" I loved It because Mr. Clint Walker over then gentlemen in whom became his friend when he was dying, from being shot by an arrow that came from ( Sayapi's Bow) Mr. Ray Danton Mr. Kelly shed some tears for his friend. Sayapi's claims the girl rides away in acclamation. Mr. Kelly tracks him down delivers her Waleeah they leave again to go forth to the lands that burn. Waleelah makes her claim and choice. How respectful to native Peoples' for the Woman can make her decision.. Mr C. Walker what an Actor. How he Looks upon her as she makes her claim Catch the corner of His Eye. Wow. Without a word said. he let her know. This a good decision. they both again hit a curb and then meets up with the Sargent) Claude Akins. Apotogy noted from an earlier fight in which the lies of evil through discrimination were at play. Mr. Clint Walker again with such Class carried this film in the last with the Indian (Chief Gull) John Russell, portraying the life of one our Heroes from Our Lineage of the Hunkapa Miniconjui Sioux of the 7 Counseled Fires Nation of Peoples. Mr. Clint Walker says She The Arapaho woman Waleelah can choose for herself in whom she would ride with? She makes her choice willing to give up her life for her man the main squeeze of this film.

I wish they would start bring back some of these old classics in the theaters to see what kind of money draw they would make.  They did it with Ben-Hur, and I paid $12.00 to see it.

It has beautiful scenery, and the interesting addition of Edd Byrnes to the cast.  As a Montanan, I question the geographical references in the movie, but that shouldn't detract from the story.  If you like Westerns, then this one set in the Northern Rockies,  supposedly about a historical figure, will entertain you.",1356739200,3,438,4.7105263157894735

4233702,1,B003ZFXE82,"'Yellowstone Kelly' is a perfectly fine Western, and one of the best of an older genre. If liking this type of movie, or Clint Walker in one of his better roles, then this film could rate a solid four.

Whether you'll be able to watch that delivered from Amazon is another matter altogether, and why my rating of one. Amazon makes a brief mention that this movie is delivered in DVD-R format, but if in the least unclear what this means, then close attention should probably be paid. DVD-R is not a regular DVD format which will play in as many devices. Amazon only alludes to this, but if actually buying this movie then you'll find out the further truth, with the disclaimer on the back of the DVD-R case reading:

'This disc is expected to play back in DVD video ""play only"" devices, and may not play back in other DVD devices including recorders and PC drives.'

As I do not have a regular DVD 'player' I do not know if this movie will play in anything, but presumably may if a standard DVD player connected directly to a TV. Any other configuration, and I can personally attest to this, then a good chance this disc will not be recognized, or play. This is a specific warning to anyone thinking they'll be watching this disc from a computer, which in my experience you will not. Be so advised.

The rationale for DVD-R is that it facilitates releasing media with expected limited appeal, if discs created one at a time as ordered. Fine. But it hardly helps the customer experience when they go out of their way to add extraneous DRM which limits the playability of said discs. Nor fully mention this prior to purchase.

Amazon was not helpful in resolving this issue, either. One could, of course utilize their excellent return policy if a problem, which is probably the only solution. To my initial query if there was some solution to this issue, they replied several days later with a nonsensical reply to a serious, detailed question. In restating that, I have heard absolutely nothing since.

So, word to the wise. If any doubt whether this disc will play for you, then it probably will not. Save yourself the grief. It remains a fine movie, which hopefully someone else will see fit releasing in a truly workable digital version, preferably in HD.

For that matter, although unsure, I also question whether the version being sold here is in its full original wide aspect ratio? Maybe, or not. I haven't researched it closely, nor seen the movie recently.",1326672000,7,2464,4.6118721461187215
4233703,5,B003ZFXE82,"Warner Bros. Pictures present ""YELLOWSTONE KELLY"" (1959) ~ (91 min/Color) -- Starring: Clint Walker, Edd Byrnes, John Russell, Ray Danton & Claude Akins

Directed by Gordon Douglas

Clint Walker has the opportunity to shine and convey significant ""screen presence"" under the tight direction of Gordon Douglas and wonderful script by Burt Kennedy, who penned so many of those wonderful Randolph Scott / Budd Boetticher westerns --- this is Clint Walker at his best.

Our plot and story line, during the late 1870s, fur-trapper Luther `Yellowstone' Kelly (Clint Walker), who once saved the life of a Sioux chief, is allowed to set his traps in Sioux territory. Reluctantly he takes on a tenderfoot assistant Anse Harper (Edd Byrnes) and together they give shelter to runaway Arapaho woman, Wahleeah (Andra Martin). Tensions develop when Anse falls in love with the woman and when Sioux chief Gall (John Russell) arrives with his warriors to re-claim her - drama and action packed scenes develop until the final credits.

In this film two wonderful character actors Claude Akins and Warren Oates, who always gave their best, whether on the big screen or the small screen.

Plus the great John Russell (Lawman TV Series/Soldiers of Fortune) is memorable in any role he portrayed.

Special footnote: - This product is manufactured on demand using DVD-R recordable media ... Aspect Ratio: 1.77:1

4233708,1,B003ZFXE82,"This is undoubtedly Clint Walker's best film with a host of impressive supporting actors, breathtaking wide screen Technicolor cinematography and a powerful score, but all of that is lost in the seedy letterbox reproduction of this movie. Visual composition of this ""remastered"" classic is so poor that it looks like a VHS tape captured from a TV set with aluminum foil flapping from the antenna. I've purchased other films from the Warner Bros Archives Collection which were also poorly reproduced, but this one is by far the worst. I'd classify it as unwatchable. My advice to interested buyers is to wait until a quality, wide screen dvd version of this outstanding motion picture is available.",1297900800,39,697,5.069565217391304

4233712,5,B003ZFXE82,"I've always enjoyed this Western ever since I was a kid, I'm dating myself here. I know that Hollywood (kind'a racist at the time) used white actors to portray Native American Indians by painting instant ""tan"" all over them and giving them a few lines that was a broken english--------probably one of the finest movies at the time that used Native American actors for a western (and one of my all time favorites) ""Little Big Man,"" this movie I really enjoyed. The actors portraying Indians did not over act, kind've gave a solid performance for I think this movie was made in 1965--'67. Now because whoever that blue eyed Goddess was at the time whoever portrayed the Iroquoi <(Spelling?) princess, I fell totally head over heels in love with that actress and been wanting a copy of this movie ever since---I know, TMI.

4233713,5,B003ZFXE82,"It's The Big Man Himself. He's 6 foot 6 inches of all man. If there is anyone who epitomizes the western hero, it's Clint Walker: big, handsome, and menacing to the bad guys; with a kind heart, gentle eyes and the most manly but kind voice you will ever hear. When he makes the move on a bad guy, watch how he does it. It's poetry in motion.

I used to love Cheyenne as a kid but I had forgotten over the decades. After seeing this movie and Gold of the Seven Saints, now I remember. He's a man that every man would want to emulate. He's a man every boy would want for a father. This is a darned good western and probably the best ever vehicle for Clint Walker to show his stuff. The Big Man Himself in widescreen color. It doesn't get any better than this. Every western fan must have this movie. I mean it.

Come on, Warner, put out the rest of Cheyenne, and Fort Dobbs.",1289692800,14,872,4.093567251461988

This started out as a John Wayne movie, but Warners saved money by using their TV stars already under contract.
