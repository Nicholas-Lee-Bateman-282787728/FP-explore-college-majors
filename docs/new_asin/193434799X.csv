203418,3,193434799X,"It's obvious that grandmaster Kwok knows what he's talking about, but I wish he would slow down when demonstrating; if you don't already know the form; you get lost trying to keep up. He had gone through the entire wooden dummy form in about three minutes or less. In dealing with common mistakes; it would have been a perfect time to show the errors and the entire section at a slower pace; not simply correct the error. I like the video, but when a traditional school isn't available and your options to further your training are limited; a little slower pace would be a welcome help.",1405728000,8,586,4.537735849056604
203419,5,193434799X,"This DVD is the best instructional on the Ip Man lineage wooden dummy form that I have ever seen.  What sets this one apart from other instructional materials on this subject is the fact that Samuel Kwok breaks down the techniques into practical applications and demonstrates them on one of his students.  Brilliant idea to fully explain not only the form itself, but how to use it in your Wing Chun as well!",1396828800,7,408,4.575342465753424
203420,3,193434799X,"Super excited to get the video, It was shrink wrapped and everything but I imagine it has been copied over and over so the copy i got freezes in the middle of a lot of scenes. The content is great however and if you have the patience to sit and wait for the scenes to unfreeze then definitely get it. I am learning the techniques and am not a martial artist and I am picking it up alright",1392681600,7,388,3.9871794871794872
203421,5,193434799X,"Great video, comprehensive and well done!  Grand Master Kwok is amazing and the techniques are thoroughly taught.  A great tool for learning and review of each section of the wooden dummy, well worth the money invested.",1376265600,4,219,5.055555555555555
