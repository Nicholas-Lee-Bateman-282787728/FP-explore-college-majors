8238692,3,B0010VISMA,"As digital recording has progressed at light speed, whatever you buy today is going to be considered obsolete fairly quickly. As with many new technology products, the manuals that come packaged with the product probably has been written by a person in some remote cubicle who has more engineering background than real-life use experience.

This book is certainly technical in all ways it needs to be, but puts the customer first in understanding the many features of the camera and makes it easier to understand them and how to put them to practical use.
It will take a fairly long time to master the camera, so a book like this is essential in my opinion to getting full value out of the camera system.",1359244800,,704,4.67741935483871
