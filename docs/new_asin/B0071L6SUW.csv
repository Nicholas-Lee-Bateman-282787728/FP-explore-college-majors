5047411,5,B0071L6SUW,"This is a great film that deals with two stories.  It's amazing how there are some people that commit themselves to helping the less fortunate.

Absolutely a must see.  Good for all ages.",1330732800,,187,4.606060606060606
5047412,5,B0071L6SUW,"I took my kids to see this back in August 2011 at the Great Lakes Science Center in Cleveland, Ohio.

It was their 1st IMAX experience (they are 4 and 2 years old).  They were so patient and were riveted!

I love how it was all about FAMILY.  Animals need love and care just as much as humans.

I have been searching online for the video since then.  I have it preordered and I can't wait to rewatch it over and over!",1328227200,31,417,4.024390243902439
5047413,5,B0071L6SUW,"I saw the 3D version of this film today at the IMAX Theater at the Smithsonian.  Gorgeous.  Heart-warming.  Magnificent.

5047414,5,B0071L6SUW,"I have had the pleasure of being in Borneo with the orangutans in August 1995 at Camp Leakey.  At the time, a young shy male barely came near us and now he is a handsome alpha male worthy of respect and admiration.  I also was in Nairobi once when the elephant orphanage was not being visited because there were no orphans -- this meant that all was well in the wild since mothers and babies were together -- orphans were a zero population at the time.  These extraordinary women have devoted their lives to the extraordinary red apes and largest land mammal with clear undestanding that if something is not done to save these animals, they will become extinct in the wild.  Extinction is forever and we cannot let this happen.  Our future generations deserve to know these animals as they exist in their natural habitat as we do.  I wish and hope we humans take the messages from this film and apply it to any animal they so wish to support.  Birute and Daphne cannot do it alone, we must help.  Together we can make a difference in the lives of our non-human creatures.  We can co-exist with all wildlife by being educated, informed and supportive.  All wildlife deserve our understanding and respect.",1318982400,4,1203,4.579439252336448
5047415,5,B0071L6SUW,"This movie parallels two different wildlife sanctuaries in two different parts of the world. And because the movie is filmed in 3D, with IMAX quality, viewers feel like they are right there. To top it off, Morgan Freeman is the narrator.

In Kenya the story takes you to a refuge for baby elephants managed by elephant expert, Dame Daphne Sheldrick. She and her team rescue baby elephants from the wild who have lost their mothers for various reasons and nurture them until they are old enough and strong enough to be released back into the wilderness. Half way across the earth from Kenya is Borneo, where an orangutan sanctuary - deep in the rain forest - rescues baby orangutans whose mothers have been killed. It is here that primatologist, Dr. Birute Galdikas, and her team, act as mothers to these fragile creatures until they can be released back into their natural habitat.

The cuteness factor of the baby animals in this movie is off the charts. There is a scene where a worker is pushing a group of baby orangutans in a wheel barrel, and everyone in the theater audibly sighed. There is another priceless scene where the primates are soaping themselves up in a bath. The baby elephants are playful and friendly and so darn adorable too. Some of the babies have trouble falling asleep so the workers have to stay with them to help them relax. You'll wish you could take one home with you. I like the way the movie takes you back and forth to the two sanctuaries. The cinematography is spectacular, as it is in all IMAX movies I've ever seen.

Children will learn that, although wild animals are cute and friendly, they are still wild and that must be respected. The rescuers give these babies a second chance to survive and let them be the animals that they naturally are while in captivity. That way when they are set free, they have the greatest chance of survival.

Anyone, young or old, who loves animals will love this IMAX movie.",1317168000,81,1945,4.628985507246377
5047416,5,B0071L6SUW,"I was fortunate enough to be invited to a special screening of this movie before it was released to the general public.  What I saw was incredible and far exceeded my expectations.  I absolutely loved it! I was deeply touched by the movie and learned so much about these very intelligent apes and elephants.  What these two women do for orangutans and elephants is amazing and self-sacricing.  I wish everyone could be as dedicated as they are.

There are very few people in the world who dedicate their lives for the benefit of others.  I am sure they would be considered Bodhisattva's in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition. I know that it is always a struggle to raise money to care for the orphans and it is my wish that there was enough support financially and physically so that these two women did not have to shoulder the burden as much as they do.

This movie is well worth seeing and purchasing.  I can hardly wait until it is released to the general public and I can buy a copy.

Thanks for giving me the opportunity to write this review.  It's the best documentary I have ever seen!",1312675200,17,1089,4.482233502538071
5047417,5,B0071L6SUW,"Inspiring story, unbelievable production value and well-put together in the editing room.

5047418,5,B0071L6SUW,"I went into seeing Born to Be Wild 3D without knowing much about it. I knew it was about orphaned Orangutans and Elephants, but that was about it. From the beginning I was moved emotionally by this film. One might think by looking at it that this is only for children, but really it applies to anyone and everyone who lives on Earth. The underlying message of the film is that the problems these animals are facing are mostly human induced. It's fitting that this film was released on Earth Day, in order to make people truly understand the radical impact that humanity has on our environment.

Morgan Freeman provides an excellent narration of the events occurring, along with commentary by experts in animal conservation. My favorite scene was when the elephants in Kenya were playing soccer (or football, whatever you want to call it) with the staff taking care of them. I whole heartedly recommend this film to anyone who has an interest in nature, animals, conservation or just wants to see a well done documentary. It left me with such a good feeling afterward, and made me feel spurred to help.",1303689600,24,1101,4.704663212435233

5047426,5,B0071L6SUW,"This is a wonderful film (family documentary) about saving two endangered animal species.  The film takes us to the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust-- an orphanage for baby elephants in Kenya, and to a sanctuary for orangutans on Borneo, Indonesia.  We meet the two amazing women who head these outstanding organizations:  Dame Dr. Daphne Sheldrick and Dr. Birute Galdikas and watch them and their dedicated staff take care of the charming and adorable animal orphans.  Narrated by Morgan Freeman, the film briefly touches upon the reasons why the elephants and orangutans are orphans:  ivory poaching and deforestation respectively.  The message can reach adult viewers, but will bypass children without upsetting them.  Personally, I sponsor an animal orphan in each orphanage and recommend this film very, very highly.",1492214400,2,819,5.4523809523809526

5047457,5,B0071L6SUW,"I love this DVD.  It's so important for today's youth to understand the issues that these two amazing species are facing today.  My students felt more connected to elephants and orangutans because they understand how similar we are to them.  This connection has fostered motivation to help orangutans, thus, my students have taken it upon themselves to understand the issue of palm oil, which is the #1 reason why the rain forests in Indonesia are being deforested.  They are aware of conflict palm oil (unsustainable) and are doing their own research on which companies continue to use it in their products, such as Pepsico, Campbell's, Hormel, Unilever, Kraft & Heinz, Toyo Suisan (Ramen Noodle soup), Nissin foods (Cup of Noodles), Hillshire, and Trader Joe's.  They are signing petitions and making wise decisions when they go grocery shopping.  They are also writing letters to companies and calling them.  I proud of their active, global citizenry!",1464652800,6,954,5.1558441558441555
5047458,3,B0071L6SUW,"Leaves out the lingering controversy about Birute's treatment of the orangutans. There's a short mention of this in Slate Magazine for June 20th 1998 (quite awhile back), but I think there's been mention since of her rather problematic personality.  Although she has obviously done more for orangutans than any other human being, the film loses a bit of credibility for not addressing the concerns directly. If there's nothing to the charges of poor conditions, unsanitary living arrangements, etc., just say so and refute the attacks. Glossing over it verges on hagiography.",1464220800,,575,5.318681318681318

Strongly recommend the HD option if your screen supports it.  The content gets a high rating from me as well.  This is one of the few nature films that let's you enjoy the beauty that is the natural world without speculating how and where something evolved from 200 billion years ago.  Yes there is an agenda here but it's nothing we haven't heard of before and nothing that isn't true: - poaching, over farming, industrialization and population growth impact the world's ecosystems and wildlife.  That message in delivered through the narration of Morgan Freeman - an awesome and respected actor in my book.
There are no scary death scenes to haunt little kids - which can be abundant in some nature films.  This is a movie the entire family can watch and feel good about.",1447027200,7,939,4.626506024096385

My children also really enjoyed the subject matter. The baby orangutans and elephants are adorable. I liked that while their back stories were a bit sad, that is not what the film focused on. It focused on the hope of the reintroduction of the animals into the wild. It focused on how there are still good people in the world willing to help. So, while it mentions the problem (poachers and people destroying habitat) it didn't make this documentary into a huge downer or a guilt trip.

Not to mention it was not in 3d!!! What the hell. I was going to rest yen it but wanted to see if I could get it to work in 3d and that too a couple of weeks (didn't have time) and It is not 3d.

She raises them with the love that you would offer a child and then releases them into the wild. Very,very cool!! Now to the 3D!! Great 3D!!

So far, I have watched IMAX's Hubble 3D, Space Station 3D, and Born to Be Wild 3D on my 90"" Projector Screen.  I love space and any documentary related to it is usually a winner in my book but both Hubble and Space Station 3D were not great 3D films.  Both are wonderful and informative documentaries but, in my opinion, are best shown in 2D.  The 3D effect sometimes is so crossed and blurry that distracts you from the movie itself.  With that said, Born to Be Wild is stunning in the 3D department!!!  The images are clear and you feel as though you are looking through a window!!!  Truly amazing 3D movie!!!  If you love mammals and want to show off your 3D device, this movie is a must have!  Too bad it only lasts 45 minutes.  We could have watched it for hours!

Since she doesn't really get to watch tv shows because they're too fast-paced, this movie makes both of us happy. I love the story, I love how well-done it is, and I love that Morgan Freeman is narrating it. The music is great too! The only downside to this, and why I gave it only 4 stars, is that it's too short! I could've watched a lot more.

He is still waiting for a 3D title that equals us seeing Magic Journeys at Walt Disney World in the 80s.  Also, it is worth noting we are both huge fans of the popout effects.  So I put the active 3D glasses on my parents and hit play on the blu ray player.  They loved it, as my wife and I did the first time we watched it.  The 3D is splendid.  This may the closest we ever get to traveling to Borneo and Kenya.  From the opening shot of the baby elephant, so real looking it looks fake (if that makes any sense), to the jungle shots, it is amazing footage.  My only complaint, it is a mild one where I won't subtract any points, is the typical Disney embellishment or over-personification of the animals.  To me it is a component they add for the kids, it is Disney after all, and I am totally OK with this.  If you are really into 3D I think it is a totally winner.

You just need the right equipment/settings to play it. The disc defaults to play the 2D version and you have to pick the 3D version after clicking PLAY on disc menu (press LEFT) so maybe that is causing this confusion.

But the 3D in here is just too much to handle for me. The extreme close-up objects, particularly at he edge of screen, seems too weird to my eyes and i was not comfortable watching those parts. I concentrated mainly to the center of screen and that helps a lot. I watched it on a 55"" LG passive Cinema 3D TV which displayed Coraline 3D just fine - and which is the best 3D movie i have ever watched at home on a 3D TV, not this one.

Except Born To Be Wild didn't only meet my expectations, it exceeded them! It also included a wonderful treatise on the importance of protecting our world's species, especially in this time of deforestation, poaching, and climatic change.

Overall, a thought-provoking and inspiring (but maybe not as thrilling) look on humanitarian issues of our contemporary life and to showcase the new technology and barriers it may break down in coming years. Pictured brilliantly and narrated equally well! 3D or no 3D.",1338768000,,1087,6.387755102040816

5047896,5,B0071L6SUW,What's not to like about a movie that Morgan Freeman narrates?  I went to the theater and saw this movie twice.  Now I own it and I am very pleased with the 3D quality.  It's a really touching story about two women who are helping to save animals.  It's refreshing to know they're out there.  Get the kleenex out though!,1338249600,,320,4.266666666666667

5047899,5,B0071L6SUW,"A well made little IMAX documentary about saving orphan orang utans and Africa elephants, train them, and release them back to the wild! You would fall in love with these beautiful animals, and 3D version is a must if you have a 3D TV! It is one of the best live-action 3D movie I ever saw! Highly recommended!

Great fund raising program for these 2 organizations too! Let help save these animals!",1337040000,,398,4.527777777777778
5047915,5,B0071L6SUW,"If you're looking for something to show off your 3D TV, this is one of the best movies I've found thus far.  Great depth, and some great ""pop-out"" moments.  It's also a great little documentary, as long as you're expecting the short run time going into it.  How could you give it less than 5 stars when there's baby orangs in it?!?  BABY ORANGS!!!",1336953600,,347,4.375
5047916,5,B0071L6SUW,"Wow... I don't know about you guys but after watching this 3D DVD, I felt like I've been on this trip and back.  I mean.. wow... 3D graphics actually creates this incredible illusion as if you were RIGHT THERE!!  I felt so refreshed (like taking a trip to the zoo on a really nice clear sunny day).  Oh.. my.. goodness... when I say ""PURE"", ""CRISP"".. I mean just that..  A serious wow factor.  Everything seems so realistic as if you were walking through the wild.. Listen, just purchase it!  You won't be disappointed but you must have to take an interest in animal life because it's for animal lovers and this documentary shows you how humans take responsibility for small animals (mainly elephants and monkeys) who have lost their parents from the wild.  Kind of sad but not to a point that you shouldn't purchase it but because those cute little things lost their parents.  You can see that the cute little animals really appreciate the humans taking really good care of them.  It will be a while when I watch it again, really felt sad for those cute things who lost their parents, they have to put their trust and depend on humans to take good care of them and that's what the humans did, this DVD shows proof that we take good care of those cute little ones.  Wow.. God's creatures are so BEAUTIFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This DVD is a must have.  Kids will love it.. and for all teachers... this DVD is great for schools to own to entertain kids as a special treat. :)",1336953600,,1467,4.473684210526316
5047917,5,B0071L6SUW,"I am BLOWN AWAY by the immersive 3d. I watched this movie at the IMAX when it came out and if you own a 3d set, you owe it to yourself to get this one. It is one of the best 3d Blu-Ray experiences out there. I watched it last night on my LG 65LM6200 and it was almost as immersive of an experience as it was in the theater. Happy watching!",1335398400,9,339,3.7222222222222223
5047918,5,B0071L6SUW,"There were many WOW!! moments. There is a scene where the baby elephants play and dust themselves with the red sand. We could see the dust coming out of the TV screen for couple of feet.
One of my best 3d collections.",1334793600,,217,4.190476190476191
5047919,5,B0071L6SUW,"I am on a wildlife documentary kick right now, and this movie did not disappoint.

(1) The images were absolutely stunning. I truly believe HD was invented to showcase the natural world in all it's glory, and this disc did not disappoint. The sound effects coupled with the visuals were absolutely stunning.

(2) Baby elephants and orangutans are absolutely adorable. Watching then play was captivating. I found myself also being moved with the interactions between the younger and older animals.

(3) Dr. Birute Galdikas and Dame Daphne Sheldrick are modern day saints.

(4) Morgan Freeman said it best, if mankind lets these animals go extinct, then a part of our collective souls goes away with them. We cannot allow this to happen.

(5) I liked this movie so much, I watched it twice in a span of 5hrs (the movie is only 40 minutes long) so this is  easily achievable.",1334707200,7,872,4.78
5047920,5,B0071L6SUW,"I saw this movie in IMAX 3D a few months ago and was truly inspired.  So much so that we are no longer giving our friends gifts for special occasions, we are adopting baby elephants and orangutans on their behalf - what a great gift! So happy this is out on DVD - you'll love it!",1334620800,3,279,3.982142857142857
5047921,5,B0071L6SUW,"You can go watch a movie like The Hunger Games in IMAX 3D but it is not going to be even close to watch this kind of documentary on that amazingly huge screen, and the conversion to Blu-ray is just as fantastic. Of course is not as immersive as being in the theater because of the screen size but is a fantastic story and the picture and sound quality is the best you can get on any Blu-ray up to date because of the film being shot with IMAX cameras.

Thanks amazon.com for getting this Blu-ray a day before release day!",1334534400,2,521,4.158415841584159
5047922,3,B0071L6SUW,"This really is a great movie for kids and adults alike, albeit it does have some rather sad parts which may affect younger children.  It does go beyond (and sets its aims higher) than many nature movies by showing that animals are not just cute, cuddly and goofy, but also sentient beings with feelings and fears which are in real danger from mankind's stupidity and greed.

It also showcases and celebrates two extraordinary women thousands of miles apart who have given their lives to the cause of helping to save two very different species (African elephants and orangutans).  I took my three year old son and was proud to point to these women as heroes worthy of praise and emulation.

The only problem that I had with this movie is its very brief running time.  I thought that a mistake had been made when the credits started rolling a little after half an hour in.  I understand that it was an IMAX movie, which generally run about half the time of features, but thought that for full price movie tickets, it was a tad brief.  Please reference IMDB which lists the running time as 40 minutes in contradiction to Amazon's listing of 90 minutes.  Unless there has been a lot of footage added (i.e. more than double the original movie), then this appears to be incorrect.",1334534400,49,1274,4.606194690265487
5047923,5,B0071L6SUW,"A movie that anyone can appreciate. Not just for lactating, emotional women, kids or animal lovers. My husband prefers macho action flicks and he was glued to the screen when we saw this in IMAX 3D. I hope the picture is gonna be just as clear and dynamic on Blue-ray 3D. I just wanted to reach through the screen and pet one (or all) those beautiful creatures. I can't stress how vivid the picture was. These women literally gave up their whole life to save these orphaned animals that would have otherwise been forgotten. It's not a long movie so it would be great to show to guests after a dinner party. Anyway, I want this review to be read so I not gonna write a book. Aloha, shalom, ciao.",1333411200,2,694,4.346153846153846
5047924,5,B0071L6SUW,"I must admit, that this was my first IMAX movie, and I am incredibly glad that it was! Of course, I could listen to Morgan Freeman narrate the ingredients on a loaf of bread and still enjoy it, but his voice completed what was already a cinematic treat.

Too often when watching environmental films, I feel as though the filmaker has a huge agenda, however watching Born To Be Wild I didn't feel this at all. You could feel that the people caring for each set of animals truly felt a deep love for their wards, from hand-feeding them to sleeping with them at night, these are not people doing this because it's trendy, these aren't celebrities with a cause, these are passionate and dedicated people. The movie was informative, endearing and altogether enjoyable! We sat in the theatre at our local science center, and much to our surprise the row of children behind us were not fidgety, bored or the only ones oohing and aahing! I must admit that watching baby elephants trot around a play soccer was just as cute for us as it was for the kids, and is an image that will no be soon forgotten. My mother grew up in Tanzania, keeping an orangutan as a family pet. She tells stories of petting baby elephants and climbing trees with the monkeys to get the morning's breakfast (fresh mango). This is about as close as I will get for now, but the experience was wonderful.

The cinematography was really excellent, and while it was a visual treat on IMAX, I was more than pleased with the Blu-Ray quality! I am no videophile, but as a photographer who dabbles in videography, I know beautiful quality footage when I see it. You will not be disappointed.

If you enjoy Morgan Freeman's narration, animals or eye-pleasing cinema, this will sure to be a great addition to your collection. My wife and I don't have kids as of yet, but you better believe that this will be a household favorite - there is more to learn from this movie than a dozen educational cartoons put together.

Highly Recommended!!",1331164800,9,1995,4.564245810055866
