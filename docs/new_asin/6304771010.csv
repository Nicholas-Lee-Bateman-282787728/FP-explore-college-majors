933570,4,6304771010,"As a family, we loved this movie. It helped my daughters appreciate more the blessings of being free, getting an education and the joy of reading. The storyline was entertaining and although it didn't depict slavery in its ""naturally brutal"" state, it was a great way to introduce younger children to the horrors of our past in a mild way. It was awesome seeing the abolitionist, Denmark Vesey, portrayed. Very good acting as well. Highly recommended.",1109030400,10,451,4.947368421052632

933677,5,6304771010,"Our daughter recommended this movie when she was in middle school - about 18 years ago. We couldn't rent it any where until we found it in a library.

But for those of us who have waited for a dvd of this movie, you will be angry with the editing (more like butchering) that was done to this thought provoking, heartfelt movie.

933731,2,6304771010,"I ordered the DVD version to replace my warped VHS but was disappointed to find that the movie was edited from its original form. I can only assume it was by the people that released the DVD. The scenes, though offensive, were key elements that drove home the emotion and horrors aspects of slavery without being too intense for middle school age students. I did not see any indication that this video was edited from its original context. Had I known, I would not have bought it. The editing ruined the message this story was trying to convey.",1358121600,,544,4.561224489795919
933732,5,6304771010,"I love this film, all should see.  It certainly gives food for thought.  In this film the young man was not interested in history, but when he was thrown back into slavery and experienced the life his ancestors lived, he certainly had a new appreciation for education.  Very good film",1355270400,,284,4.64
933733,5,6304771010,"I liked this movie. A great blend of history and

funny and the story was touching. If you want the DVD fast
order from Amazon not this 3rd party",1351641600,,206,4.447368421052632
933734,2,6304771010,This only goes for the content of the product..  The movie has been edited and doesn't include scenes that are important to the movie.

933735,5,6304771010,"Brother Future tells the story of a street-smart high school student, TJ, who is transported back in time to 1822 Charleston, South Carolina.  TJ sees little value in education until he encounters the brutalities of slavery firsthand.  TJ also comes into contact with Denmark Vesey who planned a slave revolt at this time.  This is a great movie to show if you are teaching about slavery in antebellum America.  Two versions of this movie are available.  The older VHS version is complete and unedited.  However, the newer DVD version is considerably shorter and has been edited; racist words, one expletive, and the violent episodes of whipping have been edited out.  If you are showing this movie to a secondary classroom (as I have to my eighth grade American history students for several years) you might want to purchase the longer version.  On the other hand, the DVD version might be more appropriate for an elementary level audience.  After seeing the original version several times I was very disappointed with the shorter DVD version.  In either case, Brother Future is an excellent movie with a positive message about the value of education.  Highly recommended.",1336521600,,1173,5.025906735751295
933736,2,6304771010,I was looking for a new DVD to replace my old VHS tape. I was disappointed in this copy. It has many scenes edited out or shortened. If you have seen it as often as I have (I have shown it to my history classes for the last 10 years or so which means I see it six times a day for ten years) if becomes very easy to spot and hear the edits. I will go somewhere and find an unedited copy of this good film.,1330041600,3,404,3.6551724137931036
933797,5,6304771010,"When I was 17, a few years ago to say the least, I happened upon this movie on PBS. I was out of control, flunking out of school and hanging with a bunch of people who were going no where.  I happened to see this movie during the summer between junior and senior year and I was astounded. I had never been taught that history even though I had gone to one of the best schools in the city of Chicago.  It completely changed my life. It changed the way I dressed, acted, spoke, everything. All of a sudden I respected the fact that I was in a school that many died to allow me the opportunity to attend. Even though it lacked in slave history, most schools back then did too.  We didn't get a black history class until the 90's. This movie filled in a huge gaping whole in the story of AA in America. It saved my life and I recommend it to any parent struggling with an AA kid who just doesnt get the price and the privilege of education.",1327795200,2,936,4.076086956521739

Brother Future Movie Review
Imagine being taken back in time against your will to 1822 where you are enslaved and have to find your way back home. This is what happens to TJ in Brother Future. When TJ gets hit by a car in Detroit, he is taken to Charleston, South Carolina in 1822. TJ is captured and enslaved by Master Cooper. He then finds out that to get back home he has to help someone and not get anything for himself in return, and he needs to think less about himself. In the end he helps Josiah and Caroline, two fellow slaves who are in love, get their freedom. He finally returns to Detroit in 1996, but he has learned a lot. I thought that this was an okay movie with both good and bad parts.
 One reason I liked this movie was because of the good storyline and plot. I didn't like the parts where the slaves were whipped because you could hear their screams. I actually did think that the acting was pretty good, too.
 I think many people would like this movie. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the history of slavery and even people who aren't. I would suggest that sensitive people not watch the whipping scenes, though.",1295913600,4,1171,4.318181818181818
933799,5,6304771010,This is great for giving students a feeling of the part that slavery and Black History pley in our country's history.  I have used it with many 5th grade classes.  The students really learned a lot.,1295222400,,198,4.472222222222222
933800,1,6304771010,This is the Bowdlerized version. I use the VHS for my middle school class. The DVD takes out all of the more powerful moments of the movie. Not worth purchasing at any price.,1294790400,5,174,4.303030303030303
933801,5,6304771010,"Of all the movies I have watched this is one of the better ones. It rivals ""Roots"". This is a classic film that all of our youth should be required to watch.
  This young man,a slickster,finds himself back in time on a plantation where he gets schooled in the lessons of life.",1287619200,,276,4.288461538461538
933802,3,6304771010,The older version is much better. Too much was cut out of the original.  This kind of editing turned a great movie to a so-so movie.,1260489600,2,132,4.076923076923077
933803,5,6304771010,"This movie was one of the most influential movies I've ever watched-- I remember watching it in elementary school and crying when there was a beating. Now that I'm in college, I still think about it--I've yet to gain the courage to watch it again, but it's a fantastic film.",1240099200,,274,4.5
933804,5,6304771010,"Excellent video for teaching slavery and the Civil War.  I've been using it for years but now it's time to update to DVD.  For the most part, the video is appropriate for middle school-levels and above.  It does have a few whippings and uses some racist language but students studying this period should be able to handle it.  To my astonishment, the DVD company RUINED this movie by editing it down.  I don't mean by a few minutues; it went from two hours to 72 minutes.  What a joke; they must of been afraid of a few bad words and some tragic violence.  The company is located in Utah; that explains it right there.  If you want to use this, find the OLD VIDEO that's 120 minutes.  The new DVD format BLOWS!",1190764800,25,710,4.318181818181818
933805,5,6304771010,"When I saw this movie, I was in 5th grade (back in 1999).  the film has a great storyline,I was able to learn about Denmark Vesey and who he was,and most of all: It has a powerful message. For those that want to see Brother Future, I strongly recommend this. I also recommend this for teachers (that want to show a great movie dealing with this situation mentioned in the movie and slavery) as well.",1160611200,2,399,4.32
933806,4,6304771010,"As a teacher, it is often difficult to convey the hardships that people experienced in the past. But in the movie ""Brother's Future,"" the students are given a glimpse into what life was like the antebellum South.

TJ is warped into the past, and learns the lessons of history the hard way. This movie is teacher friendly, and student approved!!

Enjoy.",1143849600,5,352,4.754098360655738

7878162,1,6304771010,"As with others, I am totally disappointed that so much of this story has been cut.  It went from 120 min to 72 min.  That is quite a bit and it also cuts out many of the meaningful parts.  For instance, when T.J. is daydreaming in class, he actually hears Motilla call him.  With some of it cut, it makes no sense to someone who has not seen it before, and there are other instances such as that throughout the movie.  The ones that dared to do this should be sued by the company.",1470700800,,480,4.0638297872340425
