5552414,4,B00B1RB8FC,"After watching the complete anime the only thing I can find fault with is the pacing, and basic story arc. Fam comes off as almost a vanishing character, she's lovable... caring and sweet but gets washed out in the overall story. The graphics/animation is top notch and there are some great action sequences but it just comes up short regarding the lead characters effectiveness.",1381881600,4,379,4.9375
