5656810,4,B00BMZFB9C,I liked it. I like this kind of raunchy humor.,1505174400,,46,3.7
5656811,5,B00BMZFB9C,"Wow, this guy is funny!",1503446400,,23,3.8
5656812,5,B00BMZFB9C,"I've seen Ian live and he is hilarious. This DVD is exactly what it was like. He doesn't really have an act, he just messes with the audience instead",1501632000,,149,4.172413793103448
5656813,5,B00BMZFB9C,"Exhibit A. why boys shouldn't be put on ADD big pharma meds. Sometimes boys are just a bit crazy (like us crazy girls).

This guy is nutso funny! He reminds me of all of my best male friends growing up (a bunch of manic clowns). His crazy energy and comebacks to his audience are awe inspiring. LAUGH_OUT_LOUD funny stuff!",1500595200,2,322,4.4576271186440675
5656814,5,B00BMZFB9C,Funniest crowd work I've ever seen. My face hurt from laughing so much.,1500508800,,71,4.538461538461538
5656815,5,B00BMZFB9C,Most of this is the same as his act in Fluffy's TV show but still funny,1500249600,,71,3.5
5656816,1,B00BMZFB9C,"I love stand-up, but this is not funny. He doesn't have any of his own material, it's all just crowd interaction and this is not his crowd. He's quick, but not clever.",1498003200,,167,4.25
5656817,4,B00BMZFB9C,"A very entertaining comic, and definitely has the talent for it.

Lots of crowd work, lots of bits that will make you think, and also lots of blue bits that you won't need to think to get (and some you will).

I can't wait to see what he's doing in the next couple of years, I know he's not new but have a feeling if he keeps working at it he'll be one of the more amazing comics out there.

4 stars instead of 5 not because he doesn't deserve 5 but because I felt, that while it was great, it could have been a little better if the crowd work wasn't as insulting all the time, or balanced it off with more self-depricating bits or something else.  Ian Bagg's is a 5 on talent, I just personally feel some things could have been handled a bit different, though definitely still good to see and I thoroughly enjoyed it!

Keep up the good work and thanks for the laughs!",1497139200,2,868,4.112426035502959

8571210,5,B00BMZFB9C,"Very funny. Not too happy about the hot cocoa that I spewed everywhere, but ... Just be prepared, don't drink or eat anything while watching this show! Jokes come out of nowhere when you least expect them. The crowd was brutal, but he handled it like a pro. Impressed.",1518566400,,268,4.489795918367347

8571213,5,B00BMZFB9C,Dude was hilarious. Not a lot of comics play the audience like Ian. Looking forward to the next special!,1514419200,,104,4.526315789473684

8571217,1,B00BMZFB9C,12 min. absolutely no laughing.  He seemed like he was revving up for a take off but kept fizzling with one false start after another.,1505606400,,134,4.36
8571218,5,B00BMZFB9C,I laughed so hard at this idiot! I had tears running down my face. I will be watching for more by Ian Bagg.,1505260800,,107,3.6956521739130435
