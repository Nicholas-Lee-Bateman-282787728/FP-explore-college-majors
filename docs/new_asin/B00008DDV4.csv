7981884,2,B00008DDV4,"This talkinghead documentary is full of self-serving bias and bilgewater.  Pass it by unless you're already a true believer in the purity of SDS motives.  If you have memories of how wonderful it all was to be a protester in the sixties, this one will take you back.  No facts running counter to your recollections will convince you SDA was not that big a deal.  As for the rest of us: there is no mention in the film of SDS trips to Cuba to huddle and plot revolution with Fidel and Che, and to harvest sugarcane as (ridiculous) temporary proletariats with blistered lilly-white hands.  There is no mention of transforming the United States government into a communist one through youth revolution. No mention of the intellectual effetism of SDS members (most of their families were financially well-off, too) and their rejection by real working-class youths.  There is no mention of SDS's near-worship of the Black Panthers as social cleansing agents.  There is no mention of the near total rejection of SDS at most colleges and universites across the nation.  Despite their hatred of Johnson and Nixon, it's a fact that peace candidate George McGovern was defeated by the second largest landslide in American history, and that while the very unpopular Vietnam war was still raging, and protests and riots ongoing.  Speakers in the film are all former SDSers mesmerized at getting a hundred thousand new members in a years time at the height of college unrest.  But this number was a small fraction of the millions of university students at the time.  When the draft ended and students moved into jobs, SDS membership just withered away.  And finally, there is no in-depth discussion of the infamous and outrageously ineffectual Weatherman organization which broke away from SDS in 1970, nor of the crazies left over from it who later joined lunatic organizations that killed people.  A much better choice is The Weather Underground, a recent release-but don't take that one as complete gospel, either.  SDS was hot stuff for a couple years then went the way of the passenger pigeon.  Read, don't just watch.",1123459200,13,2110,4.937677053824363
