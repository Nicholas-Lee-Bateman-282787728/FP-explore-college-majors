Usually when I watch a Spanish movie, I'll cheat and use the subtitles, and later on when I watch it a second time I'll tackle it without them. This one, I'll need to watch another time or two to get every word, but in the meantime I think I can write a decent review.

Esta Noche No (Not Tonight) is about a guy juggling two wives... but surprisingly it is a comedy. Naturally it deals with the point in his life where his deception catches up with him. It's pretty funny. It all starts when his father - a dirty old guy who's always coming onto their maid - gets hit by a car. He wanders into the street without looking because he is ogling a cute girl. The two men who hit the father call the phone number in his wallet and reach the husband's job and the secretary gives them his address. The two men proceed to drop the father off with the wife the father does NOT live with. Well, the husband manages to get out of that one. However, obviously the two wives end up meeting later on anyway and everything falls apart from there.

The only thing I didn't like was the ending. The situation was so complicated, I think that was all they could come up with to end it so quickly.",1332806400,,1279,4.216326530612245
