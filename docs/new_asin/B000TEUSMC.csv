2896821,5,B000TEUSMC,I've been a KISS fan since the age of 4 years old. This  was the first time I had ever seen the band so this is very sentimental and nostalgic to have on an officially released dvd. The footage on Kissology 1 was edited so I am as excited about this as I am about KISSOLOGY 2 !!!,1186012800,3,279,3.810344827586207
2896822,5,B000TEUSMC,"An absolute classic (if you like 70s variety shows)!  I mean, come on!  Witchiepoo, the Wicked Witch, ""Pinky"" Tuscadero and KISS all on one program?  All wrapped up in a Paul Lynde bow?  Count me in!

2896830,4,B000TEUSMC,Nice to have this on dvd. This is the show that I saw at 9 years old in 1976 that introduced me to KISS. The original KISS has been my favorite band ever since. The dvd has a great full color cover and print directly on the disc. The only complaint is there is no booklet. Would have been nice to have one with info and pictures from the show. Overall a great release and I recommend it.,1454544000,,387,3.9743589743589745

2896833,5,B000TEUSMC,"I know everyone warned that this was a found copy of the original and was not in very good condition.  I was a little afraid to buy it.  I am VERY glad that I did, however.  It really flows very smoothly.  The color is good and the laughs are many.  The show even includes KISS the band playing their big hit BETH.

2896835,4,B000TEUSMC,"A fabulous time capsule of mid-1970s kitsch with guest appearances by so many of the faces I knew from television. It's a hokey production played to a canned laugh track, but that's what satisfied viewers back when there were only 3 or 4 channels to watch. I'd still take it any day over Charlie Brown. Deducting one star for the lousy video and chroma levels in the version I got from Amazon Video.",1446076800,,399,4.47945205479452

2896838,5,B000TEUSMC,"Paul Lynde was a comic genius! I love this show, that brought all my favorite characters from the 1970's together in a great Halloween special. The bonus was to see KISS play two sets for the show.",1443052800,,197,4.351351351351352

Bruce Vilanch is one of the credited writers.  Early BV is as didactic as later BV.  Despite the Captain Obvious penned humor it's still good fun",1422316800,,316,4.571428571428571
2896849,5,B000TEUSMC,Loved the show back in the 70's; love it even more now.  It really makes you relive your childhood.  Paul Lynde is a comedy genius.  Thank you so much for putting this on DVD.,1420416000,,175,4.088235294117647

2896852,5,B000TEUSMC,"When I found this I thought I'd died and gone to some sort of campy, goofy heaven--a United Nations of Halloween kitsch, where Margaret Hamilton, Kiss, Pinky Tuscadero, and Florence Henderson put aside their considerable differences and sing and dance on a haunted house set wearing glorious, glittery costumes and enormous '70s hair. I'd forgotten how much I enjoyed snarky Paul Lynde, despite his truly terrible jokes. If you're nostalgic for '70s variety shows, a secret Uncle Arthur fan, or just like a little bit of comedy with your Halloween candy, you'll love this. Take your cholesterol medication, though, (or some Tums) because it's cheesier than Carol Brady's finest fondue.",1418083200,,685,5.236363636363636

2896855,3,B000TEUSMC,"I watched this as a campy trip down memory lane. It's bad...BUT....it is definitely a campy trip down memory lane.

Did people really laugh at those jokes?

If you've had a few drinks you will find this hilarious in how bad it is. If you haven't you will find a few moments hilarious, most of it strange. Do NOT watch it with your kids or they will think that people back in the day were beyond stupid, and possible mentally challenged.

Top highlights...Kiss's first number, Florence Henderson in a sparkling gown singing, and Paul Lynde exploding in a trash can!",1414886400,,564,4.62

2896859,4,B000TEUSMC,"I can still remember seeing this on TV at the house of a kid down the street who had a Kiss Army headquarters in his basement. I was just seven years old and I became a big KISS fan after that! The show is somewhat cheesy but also fun and innocent. I would rather have my young son watch this than much of today's TV shows. Some of you might remember Paul Lynde from his days as the center square on the game show Hollywood Squares. My brother and I used to love doing an impression of his awkward laugh. KISS lip syncs to three songs, but they looked so cool back in the 1970s! Prepare yourself for an odd assortment of skits and jokes, 70s style!",1413244800,,648,4.110236220472441

2896862,5,B000TEUSMC,"What can I say? This is one of those bizarre shows that is so weird and so awful it's fun! Check this bunch: Lynde, KISS, Witchie-Poo, Wicked Witch, Carol Brady, Pinky Tuscadero (who??), Donny & Marie, Tim Conway... And picture skits like Lynde and Conway as truckers fighting for floozy waitress, a Halloween Disco From Hades with dancers in orange Afro wigs, KISS standing on a balcony looking lost and confused.  This is one to be watched with friends on Halloween. Have the hooch ready.",1410220800,,490,4.764705882352941

2896870,3,B000TEUSMC,"I remember watching this as a small child when it was on TV.  It had funny moments but it was interesting to watch a '70's variety show.  It was a different age, only 3 networks at the time, competing for viewers.  There were a lot of good guest stars in this show too, and it was nice to see those old but familiar faces too.",1393804800,,326,3.9846153846153847

2896875,4,B000TEUSMC,Only missing the fifth star due to the lack of Donny and Marie. Kiss lip syncing is just a bonus,1383696000,,96,3.85
2896876,5,B000TEUSMC,"Of course it was dated, but I thought it looked great; and Paul Lynde is timeless!  His guest stars were funny and sweet; it was like a time capsule.  I really enjoyed it.  My 21-year-old son's first introduction to Paul Lynde, and now he is a huge fan.  Campy and silly.  I enjoyed the interviews and facts about Paul, as well.",1383696000,,328,4.311475409836065
2896877,5,B000TEUSMC,"My family never missed the original version of ""The Hollywood Squares"" when I was a kid.  The main reason for that was the late Paul Lynde.  He was always rip roaring hysterical with his sharp wit and terrific sense of humor.

In late 2007 I learned from my brother that ""The Paul Lynde Halloween Special"" had recently been released on DVD.  I remember seeing the special the first and last time it aired on television October 29, 1976.  Since I was only four years old at the time I did not remember much from it.  Therefore I was anxious to see it again.  My brother allowed me to borrow his copy.  I took it home and watched it and loved it from beginning to end.  Right afterwards I logged onto Amazon and ordered my own copy.

In the special Paul Lynde tells his long time housekeeper Margaret (The late Margaret Hamilton who we all know as the Wicked Witch of the West from the classic ""The Wizard of Oz"".) that he wants to avoid those pesky kids that bother him every Halloween with their trick or treating and other annoying Halloween antics.  So Margaret takes Lynde to Gloomsbury Manor, a spooky looking mansion guarded by a fierce turkey vulture named Rover.  There Margaret introduces Lynde to her sister.  Lynde is horrified to discover Margaret's sister is a witch (Billy Hayes as the character Witchiepoo from various Sid & Marty Kroft programs, among them ""HR Puffenstuff"".).  To make matters worse, Margaret reveals that she too is a witch (Reprising her role as The Wicked Witch of the West.).  Lynde tries to escape but Rover makes him change his mind.  Margaret and Witchiepoo tell Lynde that they brought him to Gloomsbury Manor because they want him to be their spokesperson and help them tell the world that witches are actually not the evil monsters everyone believes them to be.  And to show they are sincere in their intentions, they tell Lynde they will grant him three wishes....and away we go!

There are a lot of reasons why ""The Paul Lynde Halloween Special"" works on every level.  One reason is the special's very strong guest cast.  Tim Conway is just plain terrific in every scene he is in.  He is at his best in the segment where Lynde is Ruby Red The Rhinestone Trucker.  Roz ""Pinky Tuscadero"" Kelly is not too bad either in the same segment as a waitress at a greasy spoon where the ""Ruby Red"" segment is set.  The late Billy Barty is excellent and delivers more than his fair share of laughs as Gallows the Butler (He also appears in the ""Ruby Red"" segment as the owner of the diner.).

This review would not be complete without mentioning KISS in their network television debut.  In his 2012 memoir ""Make Up to Break Up:  My Life in and Out of KISS"" drummer Peter Criss said that he felt out of place appearing on the special.  However I never felt that was the case.  The band does abbreviated performances of three songs from their classic 1976 album ""Destroyer"":  ""Detroit Rock City"", ""Beth"" and ""King of the Nighttime World.""  Yes, they are lip syncing, but I think the performances were staged well.  Even their brief interaction with Lynde after performing ""Beth"" went well.  It was just the right length and it fit well into the program.

The special then concludes with the whole cast singing and dancing to ""Disco Baby"" (A reworking of the song ""Disco Lady"".).  It is very entertaining and well staged.  I think it was perfect to have KISS on the second floor of the mansion overlooking the cast as the cast danced the night away.  If KISS were on the main floor with the cast, they definitely would have been out of place as Peter Criss felt they were!

There are a lot of goofy one liners and pure cornball jokes from start to finish.  Despite that I could not help but laugh.  I still do as I watch this great program every Halloween.  Paul Lynde was tremendously talented.  He shows just how talented he was in this fun and very entertaining program.",1383264000,5,3902,4.556834532374101
2896878,5,B000TEUSMC,"I've loved Paul Lynde since I was a kid, and I  don't know how this Halloween special  got passed me back then. Glad to have found it on  Amazon. :)",1382918400,,148,3.8666666666666667
2896879,5,B000TEUSMC,"ok, its Paul Lynde, so you expect corn mixed with sarcasm and his giggle.  got that.  but what blew me away about this is the care that went in to making it.  i'm not sure where i've seen the haunted disco castle before, but it was beautiful.  the disco balls with the medieval torches surrounding them were awesome!  i kinda miss these old variety shows from yesterday.  i LOLed quite a few times, even though i groaned, too.  i never liked H.R. Pufnstuf, but Witchie Poo was actually quite witchy and, of course, Margaret reprising her Wicked Witch of the West was fun.  they even had a semi come through the wall of a diner during one skit about truckers and Pinky Tuscadero.  you just don't see those kinda things anymore on a tv show.  such a shame.  how is that worse than grown men arguing like little boys over a motorcycle?

there are bonus features!  i wasn't expecting that.  i didn't read any reviews that mentioned them, which is not to say there *aren't* any reviews that do.  great old pics of Paul and his family and friends and DOGS!  also, a funny quiz of Paul Lynde quotes.  the interview with Peter Marshall was very bittersweet and also came with pics of the Hollywood Squares days, which used to be just about one of the best game shows EVER.

if you're old like me and can remember HS and variety shows, and you love Paul's sarcastic wit, this is definitely something you'll enjoy.  KISS was funny as h-e-double hockey sticks.  did i really think these guys were cool back then?  hell yeah, i did!  LOL.  their shoes were awesome.  not so much the chest hair.",1379462400,,1582,4.451048951048951

Awesome and typical of a 70's variety show/special.  I was only 4 when this first came out but I surprisingly remember watching this with my parents.  One of my earliest recollections in life.

2896889,5,B000TEUSMC,This is just funny. This has HR Pufnsuff and WitchyPoo in the DVD and the gang. I think it's circa 1973-74.  It's a treat for the grown ups and fun for the kiddies.,1355961600,,164,3.9696969696969697

2896891,3,B000TEUSMC,"This disk is a lot of fun if you can approach it with the right mindset. You have to remember that this is from the same era as Donny and Marie and the Brady Bunch Specials. In other words, it's awful and cringe-worthy, but in a way that you can enjoy.

Margaret Hamilton in her ""Wizard of Oz"" makeup as sister to Billie Hayes' Witchy Poo? Really? Two actresses working 40 years apart, brought together at last. Who dreamt that up? And Paul Lynde as a trucker, vying for the hand of a good ol' truckstop waitress? What's wrong with this picture? Paul Lynde is both hero and host in this little Halloween-inspired special, and he does his signature giggly-snigger in just about every scene.

Kiss are cute in what must be close to their first TV appearance, with full makeup and leather gear. Oh, the memories. (But... Kiss? Kiss and Paul Lynde and Billy Barty? This is just a weird tossed-salad of guests, testament to the drug culture of the 70s.) All the other performers stand around with their mouths (figuratively) hanging open, wondering to themselves what God hath wrought. You can see that by their forced smiles. It all ends, after 45 minutes or so with another Kiss tune and then ... Disco for everybody! Yep, disco.

Play this one in the background at your next Halloween Party.",1352419200,,1289,4.595652173913043
2896892,4,B000TEUSMC,"I enjoyed it. If you'd like a nostalgic look at the late 70's and are into Kiss or early disco, this might be amusing to you.

2896894,4,B000TEUSMC,"From as far back as I can remember, I had been told that I was named (in part) after Paul Lynde; my mother, it seems, was an avid fan of the late comedian.
A side effect of knowing that you've been named after someone seems to be that that person remains on the periphery of your consciousness for your lifetime and, on occasion, they come to the forefront in conversations.  This was the case a couple of weeks ago, when I became engaged in a discussion about namesakes; Once again, there was Paul Lynde, resurrected from the grave and the center of attention.  This time, however, it dawned on me that I really knew very little about this man; I vaguely remembered him from the Hollywood Squares (although I was much too young to understand any of the adult comedy and innuendo at the time), I remembered his character in 'Charlotte's Web,' and I knew, in retrospect, that he was gay -- That was about it.  So I decided to delve a bit deeper into historical information about Mr. Lynde.  By fortuitous circumstance, I came across this Halloween special and I immediately knew that I had to watch it.  I had read a number of less than flattering reviews about the special that initially made me hesitant to purchase the DVD.  However, after failing to procure a copy of the DVD from the statewide library resources system, (Thanks for nothing MNLink!), I eventually capitulated and forked out the money for my own copy.

I AM VERY PLEASED THAT I MADE THIS PURCHASE!

Upon my first viewing of the special, my initial reaction was ""Wow! This is something that we will never see the likes of again!"" Even though it's only been 36 years since this special was aired, social attitudes and pressures seem to have largely delegated Halloween to the children's spectrum; it's hard to even imagine having any sort of Halloween television special oriented toward adults today.  Moreover, in tandem with the shift toward a child-only focus on Halloween came the attempts to ""sanitize"" the holiday: devil and witch costumes being eschewed for more benign costumes in schools; the use of the term ""harvest celebration"" instead of Halloween in some social circles; encouragement to trick-or-treat at malls and/or during daylight hours.  In short, over the past 35+ years, myopic forces have conspired against American society to take the ""trick"" out of ""trick-or-treat."" (Half of the kids that come to my door at Halloween don't even bother to say ""trick-or-treat"" anymore for their candy; they just stand there like a deer in headlights, with their molded plastic Halloween buckets in hand  -  an unfortunate sign of the state of Halloween).

Paul Lynde's Halloween Special is a campy reminder that, once upon a time, Halloween was openly revered just as much by adults as by children.  The show's opening number, `What's the matter with kids today?', replete with pitchfork wielding dancers dressed in bizarre devil costumes, harkens back to the concept that mischief was once a formidable element of the holiday.  At the end of the scene, Paul Lynde is crammed into a garbage can by the rowdy revelers, (cameo appearing) Donny and Marie Osmond slam the lid down on the can, and the crowd screams ""Trick!"" with a subsequent explosion inside the can.  Lynde then rises out of the can disheveled and smoke tinged - the victim of a Halloween prank.

As a whole, the costumes, neon light decorations, and music throughout the show are both amazing and unique to a 1970's sensibility of Halloween.  From Florence Henderson's quirky cover of `Black Magic', to the lip-synced performances of KISS, to the sexual innuendo of the final dance tune `Disco Baby' -- the show is a microcosm of that era.  Even if you find some of the material cheesy, it's hard not to appreciate it from its unique historical perspective.

As with many other reviewers, I tend to agree that the highlight of the special is the tandem of Billie Hayes (Witchiepoo from ""H.R Pufnstuf""), and Margaret Hamilton (the Wicked Witch from ""The Wizard of Oz""), who grant Paul Lynde three ""wishes"" (i.e., excuses for specifically themed skits) in exchange for assistance with improving the stereotypically negative image of witches.

In retrospect, after reading about the myriad of problems that pervaded Lynde's life, it's hard not to feel a little bit sorry for him while watching the special. In particular, in his opening monologue he makes fun of how overweight he was as a child; as he blurted out ""I was fa-a-a-a-t!"" I couldn't help but cringe a little bit.  As other reviewers have pointed out, this time period really was the beginning of the end for Paul; in a little over 5 years he would be gone.

As my mother said, after viewing this special, ""It really is too bad that he's no longer around.  You don't see entertainers like him anymore.""",1334016000,2,4801,4.81265206812652
2896895,5,B000TEUSMC,"When it comes to Halloween entertainment there are perennial television special favorites.  Like most fans of the holiday, I would rank Charles Schulz' It's the Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown (1966) and Rankin and Bass' Mad Monster Party (1967) near the top of the list.  A few years ago, however, a friend sent me a slice of heaven in the greatest ever hour of Halloween entertainment : The Paul Lynde Halloween Special (1976).  Lynde, for the unenlightened, was a comedic entertainer who got his break in Bye Bye Birdie (1962), which lead to his popular role as the warlock Uncle Arthur on Bewitched (1964), to the The Paul Lynde Show (1972), and most famously to his entrenchment as the ""Center Square"" in the game show ""Hollywood Squares.""  Lynde's Halloween special is so stunningly beautiful, so representative of its era (and what an era the 70s was: the last great decade of American pop culture), that I felt a pronounced nostalgic lump in my throat.  This Halloween bash seriously belongs in one of those time capsule thingys that we occasionally shoot into space for Martians to peek at.

Of course, with the banality of reality TV and unimaginative attachment to hyper-realism, some will pooh-pooh my blushing exclamation as misplaced nostalgia.  Others may see the show as a bizarre curio from a long gone era (these are the boring and predictable types who think of everything pre-existing their entry into the world as relics from tens of thousands of years ago).  On my end, I will utterly dismiss the naysayers as being hopelessly constipated.  You know the type.  They prefer angst-ridden X-Men to Jack Kirby's fun lubbin' Jimmy Olsen who teamed up with Goody Rickles and the Hairys.  Stay far, far away from these people.  They will only bring you unhappiness.  They will turn you gray, incorporate you into their bourgeoisie, status-quo painted white picket fence world, or, heaven forbid, get you a job in a faceless institution.  Lions, tigers, and bears, oh my!

Now that we have that settled, you can kick back and immerse yourself in the glories of quintessential 70's camp! Just think of The Paul Lynde Halloween Special like one those Roselyn Bakery Cakes with six inches of icing atop an inch of cake and indulge in this one-of-a-kind hallucination.

Paul bitchily rummages through the closet because he knows there's a holiday of some kind around the corner.  Nope, it's not Santa (love the wig).  No, it's not Peter Cottontail (Lynde literally becomes a flaming bunny!).  Dagnabbit, it's Halloween.  All those annoying brats are going to be expecting zingers and Little Debbies (OK, I know, that's from the Charlie Brown commercials.  Lighten up.  You get the idea).  Gotta get away from them, and Peter Marshall!  So, Paul accepts an invitation from maid Margaret Hamilton to spend the weekend at Gloomsbury Manor.  Once there, the maid becomes the Wicked Witch of the West.  Her sister Billie Hayes is on hand, too (quite convenient, since she plays ""Mr. Pufnstuf""`s Witchiepoo).  ""Well Paul, you see, witches aren't really bad. We're just misunderstood misfits.""  Hermey the dentist is a no-show, but to convince Paul, who's not too sure about this misunderstood misfit angle, the necromancers pull in another cohort: little Ms. ""Golden Girl"" Betty White as a witch.

The girls want a bona fide celebrity spooksman to convince John Q. Public that witches are really cool (although Betty's not too sure just how bona fide a celeb Mr. Lynde is).  To sweeten the deal Paul will get three wishes.  Naturally, Paul takes a flying leap out of the closet to claim his wishes.

Wish number one: Paul wants to be none other than a genuine trucker just like C.W. McCall. This means a new outfit of rhinestones, spandex, and glued-on Burt Reynolds-style chest hair.  In that ""Deep Truck"" getup Lynde makes a pit stop at the truck stop, engages in a macho contest with Tim Conway over Roz (kinky ""Pinky"" with hot pants and boots made for walkin') Kelly and performs a square dance disco number for the convoy.  Hell yeah--breaker one nine--Billy Barty stole my gal!

The wish gets interrupted by none other than... KISS!  Yes, that nightmare of every 70's mom  (`I just love religious groups') KISS, here to ""Get up, everybody's gonna move their feet/Get up, everybody leave their seat!""  ""Aw my gawd!""  Paul is simply aghast.  So much so that he flubs his second guess, accidentally wishing for Wish Number Two...

...to be none other than Rudolph Valentino in the Florence of Arabia desert with... Mrs. Brady, Flo Henderson!  C'mere baby.  Mr. Brady ain't got nuthin' on this real man.  That guy's a wuss compared to Paul Valentino Lynde.  Yes, they lock lips ""Love American Style,"" truer that the red, white, and blue!  Tim is on hand again to spoil the hetero fun being had.  He cockeyes Lynde, ""Why you wearin that earring?""  "" Cause I'm a real chic sheik.""  Mrs. Brady musta done something to Paul's testosterone (this isn't reality, folks) because he pulls an Aladdin, giving his third wish back to the trio of witches, who wish for...

...Wish Number Three: a whole new makeover for Gloomsbury Manor, which means it turns into Discotheque Manor.  Now John Q. Public will really think we're cool!  The heavens open up: vaudeville skits with little guy Billy Barty (as a butler, no less), disco numbers, Mormon variety celebs Donnie and Marie showing up unannounced (and pitching Lynde into an exploding  garbage can), disco numbers (probably Dino's gold diggers behind those kitsch masks, pitchforks and hot pants), Florence oozing sex in her little black dress (Robert Reed was never so lucky), disco numbers, Florence and KISS in a sing-off (Her Donna Summer-esque ""Old Black Magic"" beats their `""Beth, I hear you calling.""  Hell, I could have told you that!) and more disco numbers (during which Roz flirts with Lynde and true-blue rockers KISS join in!).  Lynde winks at the (`four kisses on my first date!')  boys who ""can't come home right now.""  Paul Lynde relished his ""I know you know I'm gay and you know I know that you know, but you're going to be polite in a 70's kind of way and I'm going to be polite in an entertaining, winky, bitchy kind of way"" and he seems genuinely sincere when he thanks the audience for making him feel wanted.

2896896,5,B000TEUSMC,"1976 was a very good year for KISS. Destroyer was number one on the charts, and KISS were the People's Choice for Best Rock Band. Although the performances here are lip-synced, they are fantastic none-the-less. ""Detroit Rock City"", ""Beth"" and ""King of the Nighttime World"" are performed. The stage is a Victorian mansion, and the band fit right in with the gaslamp open-flame chandeliers. First song is ""Detroit Rock City"", which starts with Paul off-sync for a second, but quickly regains control, and takes it strongly through to the ending car-crash, with amplifiers exploding and smoke bombs going off! Peter sings ""Beth"" sitting at a grand piano, as if he were playing, though his hands are never shown touching the keys. ""King of the Nighttime World"" was the final song, edited from the album version, possibly due to time constraints. A bit skewed, would rather have had them performing ""Flaming Youth"" or ""Shout It Out Loud"", but I enjoyed it all, regardless. The quality is far better than much of the vintage footage available on KISSology. No apologies necessary, except perhaps, for the Florence Henderson performance. This is iconic KISS at a time when everything they touched, was turning to gold. If you were a teenager in 1976, this is required viewing, get it!",1321660800,4,1277,4.97196261682243

2896898,5,B000TEUSMC,"I first watched this show in it's original airing-- Margaret Hamilton, The Wicked Witch of the West (from 'The Wizard Of Oz') visits her sister Witchy-Poo, (from the Sid & Marty Kroft show 'H.R.

It uses the original sets from that series (which had been cancelled a few years before), and ""Bewitched"" Warlock, Uncle Arthur (Paul Lynde) comes to the party: it was KISS' first prime-time TV appearance, (they perform three numbers), Witchy-Poo keeps them in a cage in her dungeon.

I don't know if it's aged well: It was just as cheesy as I remembered it, watching it at age 14 or so; KISS had made late-night appearances on 'The Midnight Special' and Don Kirchner's Rock Concert by this point, but this was their big prime-time television debut-- a flop Halloween special that's never re-aired. Get yourself liquored up, and enjoy this so-bad-it's good comedy special.

If Mr. Lynde's style of self mocking humor is not to your liking , this Halloween show will certainly not change your opinion of it . It's an odd mash up to be sure . The rock group KISS gets several canned musical numbers and a bit of rapping (this meant talking) with Paul . The canned performances were very common during the 1970's . Mrs. Brady gets to sing a wonderfully painful musical number as well as act and false smooch a good deal with the openly and obviously gay and fun Mr. Lynde . You'll find Tim Conway here as well as the Wicked Witch Of The West . Lots of television folk of the era turn up . The censors clearly gave Paul very little wiggle room to Shock the primetime viewers . Donny and Marie Osmond appear briefly . There's disco . An absolutely beautiful Pinky Tuscadero turns up in what must surely be the show's most outrageous ""trucker fantasy"" sequence . There's Billy Barty , good naturedly and deeply politically incorrectly , allowing himself to be the the recipient of many bad and lame jokes pertaining to his physical stature . I didn't see much Sid and Marty Krofft television as a youth . You'll find Witchiepoo prominently featured to delightful result though . This show is soooo rude and (there again) BIZZARE and cornball and semi-hip , it's unlike any other . This is five star TRASH , CULT television .

2896900,2,B000TEUSMC,"Unfortunately it did not. This special showed that Paul Lynde was o.k. when taken in small doses; yet this film had too much Paul in one sitting. The show was stilted and contrived. You really felt that you were caught up in a seventies nightmare; perfect for Halloween. Donny and Marie Osmond did not make it in to the introduction; they could have been much better presenters than ""Kiss."" Most of the skits were too contrived to be funny.

I waited through the complete presentation in the hope that the Osmond's would make more than a token appearance. They did not. And ""the Kiss sound track was washed out or maybe they were washed out in reality. It was fun to see Tim Conway as Dynamite Dan/Long Haul Howard/Seymore as it made me think of ""The Carol Burnett Show."" The disco scene made me think of ""Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In"" or the disco scene in ""Cactus Flower.""

Florence Henderson sang ""that old Black Magic"" while displaying Dracula type fangs; you have to wonder if she grew those fangs for Halloween or if it was a fashion statement.

Any way enough reminiscing, bottom line is I have no idea why other than as a historical documentary that anyone would want to reconstitute this particular Halloween special.",1291766400,,1223,4.67906976744186
2896901,5,B000TEUSMC,"Our family had always enjoyed Paul Lynde when he appeared on various variety and game shows in the past including Bewitched and Hollywood Squares, but this video was the funniest of all. His antics on this video were just what we remembered. We never stopped laughing from the start to the finish. Also, the additional clips were GREAT as it really delved into the life of Paul that I'm sure most people didn't know. We also enjoyed seeing KISS in the video, since we didn't realize they had appeared with Paul for his Halloween special.

We've shown this video to various friends who also agreed with us and almost didn't make it to the bathroom at times because they were laughing so hard at times (if you get my drift).
If any more videos of this sort that have to do with him or any of the hillarious comedians from the past, please keep those of us that enjoyed the old humorous videos coming.",1285372800,,898,4.475609756097561

Just the cast list alone is over-the-top camp, with some real gems like Margaret Hamilton.  The main set is actually VERY cool, too.  Not a big KISS fan, but at least the song ""Beth"" was good.  If you have a good sense of humor, this will be a gem.  If you take things too literally, I don't think you'll get the real joy of this.",1284854400,3,449,4.103448275862069

However, I have always liked Paul Lynde in DVDs I've watched, especially in his roles on Bewitched, Hollywood Squares and in movies like ""Send Me No Flowers.""  Halloween also happens to be one of my favorite holidays, and I figure, hey I can appreciate things like the dragon boots that Kiss members wear.  So I ordered this DVD thinking I would stumble upon a fun little gem from the 70's.

WRONG!

This TV show has such a low budget and the jokes and acting are so bad, that it would really only be fit for some kind of sick drinking game - or perhaps to show to your children so they can be grateful they did not have to live through the 70's.  I was embarassed for Paul Lynde, really.

The only cool thing about this special at all was getting to see Margaret Hamilton, the actress who played the evil witch in the Wizard of Oz.

2896904,4,B000TEUSMC,"A head-on collision of mid-70's comedic cheese and rock 'n roll, Paul Lynde's Halloween Special is a sort of time capsule into another realm, where television writing subscribed to a ""so bad, it's brilliant"" mentality.
Margaret Hamilton reprises her 'Wicked Witch of the West' schtick, mixing camp with a disconcerting undercurrent of genuine creepiness (It is Halloween, afterall).
""Destroyer"" era KISS performs three songs, something many of their followers consider the crown jewel of television performances, and a real highlight of their lengthy career.
Speaking of KISS, and this performance in particular, Matt Kozlowski noted a great parallel between band & Paul Lynde's featured guests:

""Gene Simmons wagged his tongue and Paul Stanley puckered his lips, both not unlike rejected characters from H.R PufnStuf.
The only thing missing from this spectacle, was a guy named Sigmund, in a sea-monster costume, playing drums to ""King of the night time world.""
The real cherry tomato on the salad, was the fact that KISS, like fellow entertainer, Billy Barty, were in on the joke.
Regardless of whether your three feet tall, or seven feet tall in dragon boots, it's all about showbiz (or is it showbizzz?)
Not since Alice Cooper crooned to Miss Piggy on the Muppet Show, has this been more apparent.""

Kozlowski hit the proverbial nail on the head.
Great television isn't measured on the same scale as great art.
Great television is simply calculated by how well the viewer was entertained.
In this case, Paul Lynde's Halloween special succeeds , as it flails away uncomfortably, under the weight of it's own excess.",1268352000,,1619,5.175572519083969

2896911,4,B000TEUSMC,"The Paul Lynde Halloween Special is a surreal, kitschy hunk of 70's cheese, long thought to be lost for over three decades. Variety show in structure while underpinned with the thinnest of plot lines, it's a virtual text book of trash culture circa 1976: Billy Barty, Tim Conway, Betty White, Florence Henderson (singing ""That Old Black Magic"" in a dreadful disco number), Roz Kelly (Pinky Tuscadero of ""Happy Days), the rock band Kiss, Billie Hayes (as Withchiepoo from ""H.R. Pufinstuf""), Margaret Hamilton (gamely reprising her Wicked Witch of the West character), discotheques, line dancing, CB radios, truckers, desert sheiks, neon lights, candy colored sets, canned laughter, rhinestone-studded outfits and probably some shag carpet and olive-colored appliances. All this and Donny and Marie Osmond, too.

Holding it all together (and that's not easy) is the bitter charm of Paul Lynde. His spiky comebacks seem more acerbic on ""Hollywood Squares"" (blame the writers), but his sarcastic delivery is still dead on and he more or less carries the show. Lynde even gets an opening musical number in the winking ""Kids"", which sends up bratty children, sentimentality and Halloween altogether. His cackling rapport with pal Margaret Hamilton (one of the few personalities who could stand toe-to-toe with him), is where he truly feels at home and based on his checkered past, suggests a kinship with the Wicked Witch of the West. The cover art more than asserts this notion.

As stated on the package, this may possibly be the Holy Grail for Kiss Kollectors, documenting in entirety their first prime-time appearance on national television. The band hams it's way through three numbers, ""Detroit Rock City"", ""Beth"" and ""King Of The Nighttime World"" and their presence brings much-needed electricity to the proceedings, especially lead singer Paul Stanley, who manages to leap around like Baryshnikov in six-inch platform shoes. The lip syncing, staged destruction and edited songs may turn off hardcore fans, so acquiring this DVD for a rare, albeit contrived, Kiss performance might be for completists only, though I've never met a Kiss fan who wasn't one.

As for the quality of the video, the distributors acknowledge its flaws: The transfer is not up to average DVD standards, but it's not unwatchable either, considering it's probably been stashed in a musty closet next to Dorothy's shoes somewhere in West Hollywood. The extras are generous for such an endeavor: A fun interactive trivia game, a nice photo scrapbook supplied from family and friends and witty quotes. But the real highlight is an interview with ""Hollywood Squares"" host Peter Marshall, in a candid but G-rated reminiscing on Lynde's life and times.

If you have the right frame of mind, a healthy appreciation of camp and are looking for some trashy fun, you'll enjoy this newly rediscovered piece of 70's memorabilia. For everyone else, well, it just might haunt you.",1250812800,15,2941,5.211416490486258

Anyway, it was worth the price I paid ([...]). Most of it was so bad, it's painful.  I can understand why it aired only once.  Most 70s variety shows (series or specials) are like bad LSD trips, and this one follows suit.  I enjoyed Paul Lynde on Bewitched.  He was hysterical then.  This time around he was so not funny.  It was so painful to watch a series of lame jokes, one right after another.  The only redeeming qualities are KISS (Detroit Rock City and Beth) and Florence Henderson (Old Black Magic).  If the price is under $[...], then why not?  But, I wouldn't pay over $[...] for it.  The extras are okay, but I would've liked to have had perhaps an episode of Hollywood Squares or more about Paul Lynde on the squares and some about him on Bewitched.",1226275200,2,935,4.4733727810650885

2896918,3,B000TEUSMC,"Let me start out saying that I am a fan of both Paul Lynde and Halloween. A Special that features both seemed like mixing your chocolate with my peanut butter. I was really looking forward to it. Unfortunately, I found the whole mess pretty mediocre.

This is the premise: Margaret Hamilton playing herself as Paul Lynde's housekeeper (?) asks Paul to give her a ride to her sister's house, her sister being Witchiepoo from H.R. Puffnstuff. When they get there it turns out Paul was brought with an ulterior motive in mind. It turns out the winner of the witches Miss Halloween contest was promised a date with Paul Newman as her prize by Hamilton and Witchiepoo. Since they can't deliver Paul Newman they deliver Paul Lynde, because he is the only famous Paul who is available. Miss Halloween takes a rain check and Lynde is left feeling dejected. The witch sisters decide to cheer him up by giving him 3 wishes. The fulfillment of those wishes forms the body of the Special.
  They should have had a lot of fun with this. Paul's first wish is to be a trucker, and not just any trucker but The Rhinestone Trucker, a bedazzled fella who goes by the handle Ruby Red. He later wishes to be a red-hot desert sheik ala Rudolph Valentino. Finally he wishes to take the witch sisters to a disco. There were lots of opportunities for some great humor here yet the writers and cast seldom take advantage of them. I especially like the idea of Paul Lynde playing a famous performer who lives a pretty normal lifestyle. The show's almost written like an episode of the old Jack Benny or Burns& Allen shows, where they were also famous performers who lived normal lives in quiet little neighborhoods like normal folk. This show was like that, almost too much like that. It was just too dry and flat. Lynde didn't seem to have his heart in it and nobody made the most of the many chances for solid humor that were available. It was funny watching Paul romance the smoking hot Roz Kelly, who should have had her own special, but it was also a little cringe inducing. There was no sly wink or nod, which would have made it funny.  Maybe back then he wasn't able to do that, but I was kind of hoping he would have been able to do something to let us know he thought it was all a pretty funny joke too.

It had all the ingredients for some great genuine camp but for some reason for me the whole did not live up to the sum of the parts. It was Ok but that's about it. It pains me to say this, but this Special was a little more Trick than Treat",1222041600,7,2528,4.3474576271186445

2896922,4,B000TEUSMC,"It was about time they put out this fun little tv special from 1976 onto dvd.  I have read alot of reviews about the poor quality of the video. But in truth there are some horizontal lines that appear occasionally and that is not a huge distraction. I can't tell you how many older movies I have on dvd in which the print they use is just hideous. With thousands of black dots on them and vertical rip lines.  So compared to those this is not that bad at all.  In fact I thought it was going to be trashed like lets say the fun little horror movie 'one dark night"" whose dvd release is really mangled.  So I would say that this is not that bad at all.  As for the show itself it's 1970's camp and it's fun to watch.
the jokes are corny for sure but still fun to hear and even groan with.
 The three performances from the rock group kiss are a blast as well.  Visually they are alot of fun to watch as they lay down some classic tracks from the great Destroyer cd.  As for the clothes styles as flamboyant as the seventies were at least they had some sense of style. you can't say that some of todays styles which look  baggy or overly loose , so just imagine what they will say in 30 years about the idiotic no class styles you see these days.  It's even worse with womens clothes if they are loose, grungy and scummy looking. How about unwashed hair with long dreads? people in those days at least tried to make their hair look nice when it was long.  So we shouldn't be too hard on that decade at least they attempted to have some sense of style.  Ok so this isn't great entertainment but it's still fun to watch.",1209772800,4,1615,4.124600638977636
2896923,3,B000TEUSMC,"What a 70's Time Capsule. I had forgotten just how good Paul Lynde's delivery of a comic line was. Even with bad material (like this show), Paul can make it funny with his patented gay grimaces. The guest list on this show is a true mixed bag: Florence Henderson, KISS (!), Margaret Hamilton, Billy Barty, Tim Conway, Roz Kelly (""Happy Days"" Pinky Tuscadero), and Billy Hayes (""HR Pufnstuf"" Witchiepoo). It is really jarring to see Margaret Hamilton don her ""Wizard of Oz"" costume again; she looks exactly as she did in 1939 when she made the movie. AMAZING! The quality of the picture is fair-poor; shot on videotape, it obviously has suffered from picture loss over the years. Plenty of over-the-top skits (Paul Lynde as a Valentino-like shiek romancing Florence!) and musical numbers (KISS singing the classic ""Beth"" and Florence's Disco version of ""That Old Black Magic""). The best extra on the DVD is the Peter Marshall audio interview, accompanied by a number of photos from the Hollywood Squares. The interview is under 10 minutes, but Peter is very frank about Lynde and it is interesting (and funny!) to hear  his anecdotes. The trivia section is fun, but the ""bonus"" if you get to the end of the game is a photo of Lynde dressed up as a witch;  nothing to write home about. The Paul Lynde scrapbook photos are nice to go through, as most have probably never been seen. So, for a fun Halloween party background video, this DVD is excellent.",1209600000,4,1449,4.723320158102767

It's a few steps down from things like Donny and Marie or even Pink Lady and Jeff... but it's hypnotic nonetheless. Flo Henderson discoing? Margaret Hamilton and Witchiepoo hugging? And Kiss looking on?

The mind reels when you think of how many people were involved in this show, and this was the result... It makes me think that the 70s were a dark, dark time.

There's an audio interview with Peter Marshall (Hollywood Squares host) in the special features - very candid, and very fair, but you won't come away liking Paul Lynde any better...

I never was a fan of Witchiepoo, so I didn't get into Billie Hayes turn in said role.

2896933,4,B000TEUSMC,"This Halloween special aired once on television, on October 29, 1976. It is perhaps the most quintessential 1970's camp classic available on DVD. Starring Paul Lynde, with a bevy of guest stars such as Tim Conway, Billy Barty, Florence Henderson, Donny and Marie Osmond, KISS, and best of all, Margaret Hamilton and Billie Hayes, this show is only 50 minutes long, but what it lacks in length it makes up for in cheese.

It is essentially a sketch comedy show with the faintest of connective sinew: Paul Lynde and his housekeeper, Margaret Hamilton, visit Hamilton's sister, Billie Hayes at her castle. Obviously this is an excuse for Hamilton to reprise her role as the most famous witch in history, the Wicked Witch of the West from ""The Wizard of Oz,"" while Hayes dons her Witchiepoo outfit from ""H. R. Pufnstuf."" Along the way there are lots of lame jokes, skits, and music.

To capitalize on the then huge song ""Convoy"" and television show ""Movin' On"" there is a musical nightmare where Lynde (in a sequin jumpsuit with enormous lapels) and Conway play truckers dueling for the love of Pinky Tuscadero (Roz Kelly). Although that has nothing to do with Halloween and everything to do with the strangely popular CB radio boom, the setting quickly shifts for most of the balance of the show to Hayes' house. I especially enjoyed the interactions of Hayes and Hamilton in the castle where they introduce KISS (their first major television appearance) as chamber musicians who ""make such very soothing, quiet dinner music.""

There are other diversions, such as when Lynde becomes a sheik who kidnaps Florence Henderson (who he falls for after seeing her milk a cobra). He tries everything to win her heart, even sharing a decanter of hyena wine with her. In the end, she is won over by a gift of a cockatoo ""once owned by Baretta,"" leading to the most unerotic kiss in screen history. She also gets a chance to sing ""That Old Black Magic"" with a disco arrangement. The entire disco scene, in fact, is surreal: the hair and costumes will haunt me for a long time, and everyone in the cast (except KISS, which looks on, mortified) dances to an excremental tutorial taught by Pinky Tuscadero titled ""Disco Baby"".

The show is very cheesy, as only a 1970's star-studded spectacular could be. If you want a good laugh (but not at the jokes) or a humorous reminiscence of those colorfully tacky days, this is absolutely not to be missed.",1194912000,66,2431,4.753554502369668

2896935,4,B000TEUSMC,"Some friends and I watched this last night (Halloween night).  It was a riot!  Once we braced ourselves for the entertainment values of 1976, and the poor quality of the recording, we were sucked right in and laughed at Paul Lynde's corny jokes.  The others cast in this special were also fun.  Margaret Hamilton and Billie Hayes were spot-on as witches.  And seeing a young and still-striving for stardom KISS was a delight.  The energy level really jumped up for ""Detroit Rock City"" and ""King of the Nighttime World""  (Including explosions and fire-breathing!)  ""Beth"" was, well, as gentle as the song is.

The late Paul Lynde was a comic master.  Everybody loved him and he really stood out in his roles in ""The Munsters"" and ""Bewitched.""  That grin, that laugh, that delivery -- infectious and irreplaceable.

This was my second time seeing the Paul Lynde Halloween Special -- first time was the original (and only) airing on October 29, 1976.  Being a huge KISS fan was my motivation to watch then.  It was just as enjoyable to see my rock heroes in last night's viewing, and I enjoyed all the other skits as well.

It's bad--not ""so bad it's good"" bad, but just bad. KISS looks really embarrassed to be here, and even the usually great Tim Conway is wasted.  I'll admit it was a kick to see Margaret Hamilton in her WIZARD OF OZ Wicked Witch of the West garb, but the rest of the show falls painfully flat. It's so bad that it's hard to pick the most painful moment, but I will have to settle with Florence Henderson doing a disco-operatic version of ""That Old Black Magic.""

The dated ""Comedy Skits"" with Tim Conway, Roz (""Pinky"";  one of Fonzie's girls from ""HAPPY DAYS"") and Florence Henderson fall embarrassingly flat. Who told Roz Kelly she could act, sing, dance, or otherwise ""entertain""? By the same standard, the sight of Florence Henderson singing a disco version of ""That Old Black Magic"" is enough to make me barf up my Halloween candy!! Scary!!
  The reasons to watch are: Margaret Hamilton returning to her signature role as The Wicked Witch Of The West from ""THE WIZARD OF OZ."" Billie Hayes returns as Witchiepoo from ""H.R. PUFNSTUFF."" The original KISS lineup of Ace, Gene, Peter, and Paul are here in their original costumes, make-up, and sexy personas.

The cast is like a wet dream of gay camp!  Besides Paul (in full-out ""bitchy"" mode), there's Margaret Hamilton (Wicked Witch of the West from ""Wizard of Oz""), Billie Hayes (as Witchiepoo from ""HR Pufnstuf""), Betty White, Billy Barty, Tim Conway, and would you believe Florence Henderson ... singing a DISCO verion of ""That Old Black Magic""???  Musical guests are KISS, on their first network appearance.  The entire cast joins in a disco salute as the finale (which is in itself worth the price to see KISS briefly singing DISCO!)

If you can make it through the 70's style lame jokes and boring skits you're in for a real treat....sort of. The real stars of this special are Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch and Billie Hayes as Witchie Poo. Kiss perform 3 songs and try to make it look real even though they're not really playing or singing. The entrance of kiss on stage for the first song and Gene's finally on the last song are priceless and worth a look, but there really is nothing else to get excited about this DVD release.

The quality of the video and sound transfer is pretty bad and it's explained in depth when the disclaimer appears at the beginning of the dvd. The skits aren't funny and disco dancing and Kiss definitely don't go together on any stage. While it was great to see Kiss appear in this Halloween Special, there just wasn't enough to hold my interest and I've already sold my copy. Sometimes a trip down memory lane can be very painful and watching this special was just that.

Guest stars like Tim Conway, Florence Henderson, and of course, KISS make this a memorable show. It's definitely a slice of the 70's with Disco music and the variety show feel (skits, song-and-dance routines, occasional painfully unfunny jokes), and it's great. The only down side is the fact that it's not the best quality. It looks like an old VHS movie, but that can't be helped because it was thought lost forever and only ONE complete copy has ever been found. I wish they could have remastered it, but I'd rather have it this way than not at all.

I remember being excited to see this when advertised on TV just to see KISS even before I was a KISS fan. When I saw this I knew nothing about KISS. I didn't even know their names. All I kept saying was I like the guy in the armor (Gene Simmons). The guy with the star on his eye has a good strong voice(Paul Stanley) The whisker faced guy plays the piano well, but his voice is too raspy(Peter Criss).  He really wasn't playing the piano. In fact it's been said the piano didn't even have keys. And the chick looks hot but very flat chested (Ace Frehley) probably because of his long silky, shiny hair and big Olive Oyl lips. NO HATE COMMENTS PLEASE. Ace is as much a man can be. I'm only relaying first impressions. Paul Lynde was a very good supporting actor, guest appearing in many sitcoms. Most people will remember his portrayal as The Munsters' family doctor, Dr. Dudley, Samantha Steven's Uncle Arthur, and his long time stint on The Hollywood Squares. But the real stars of this special is KISS. They are the reason this dvd is considered to be the holy grail for the long time KISS fan. All other guests on this show have either passed away or have faded off into oblivion. Ask anyone who saw this, what they remember?  Some will say they remember the set designs, some will say they remember Margaret Hamilton reprising her Wicked Witch of the West role and Billie Hayes as Witchie Poo from H.R. Pufn'stuf. But most people will say. They remember KISS being lowered down in a cage on to the stage. But most of us would like to forget the disco finale.

Nowadays I appreciate Paul Lynde for many reasons, as he was a groundbreaking character actor and comedian who used sophisticated double entendre to mask his gay humor, which was near genius.

Everyone certainly gave it their all (especially Florence Henderson, who knew she could sing?)  and Margaret Hamilton, who hadn't played the Wicked Witch of the West in over 40 years, performed surprisingly well given expectations.  'Witchie-Poo' also played her role as good as if you were really watching an episode of Sydney & Kroft.  It was a well thought out script, had an all-star cast and everything needed to be a hit.  And it seems obviously they had plans to make this an annual event.
Unfortunately, except for Paul Lynde.  There was definitely something going on- he had an air of depression or even illness that was interfering with his performance here imo.  He tried but was just slightly off beat on the punch lines and even with his singing, and it dragged down the entire production.  The producers seemed to agree and the show was yanked and vanished faster than Late Night with Chevy Chase.",1510963200,,1180,4.75

That typed fans of Mr. Lynde will most likely adore this...oh, and fans of the rock band Kiss as well.",1510704000,,266,4.804347826086956
8208773,2,B000TEUSMC,"Oh, my. This was hard to take, but I paid for it, so I endured it. The ingredient list of cast members coaxed me. The results were not even bad in some parts. Almost like there was a horrible overseer to this project who deliberately reined-in Paul Lyndes usual caustic wit. Unless he tried to tone himself down on purpose. The two witches, Margaret Hamilton and Billie Witchiepoo Hayes, stole the show. But they kept giving it back.
A promising start, arriving at a big spooky house, melts into a rubbery, smashed box of mixed Halloween Peeps, attempted-boo variations on non-Halloweeny sketches already old at The BiCentennial. (I don't believe Paul Lynde really made anybof those bland wishes, either.)
Theres really only so much Tim Conway can possibly do to save himself here, let alone make things better. I know that, you know that. (Dont hold this against Barnacle Boy. kay?)
The costumes and settings differ, but the meh still tastes the same. For extra abuse, add Pinky Tuscadero (never forget Suzy Quattro played her relative, Leather Tuscadero).
There are a couple of cameow appearances, such as Donnie and Marie Osmond. Yeah, stars. Such stars, I tell you.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the parallel universe, where Jimmy Carter is president and brother Billy is the worst thing the countrys upset over besides that wall-to-wall Lucy-orange deep shag carpet. Things were in such a state that this special (seems Paul mentions hes got a few priors on his record already when it comes to these) was something that was considered entertainment.
You can really tell the era this took place in by its disco saturation, its trucker sketch, and even more disco, disco after disco* - Florence Henderson is hustled in-between the three tunes well-mimed by KISS with her own discoid rendition of That Old Black Magic. She is in no  competition with Divines version in Pink Flamingos.
The last fifteen minutes looked like they were filmed through a wall smeared with Vaseline.....
Paul, who let this happen?
Fine family viewing, if you really don't care for them very much.
