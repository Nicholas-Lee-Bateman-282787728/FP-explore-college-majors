8450139,5,B004ZKNC4M,"Killer Show. This captures the Scorpions at the height of their game. This was an incredible show from 1984. Set list is on the back of the dvd case. Another review says he cant find the year of the show and set list so he gave it 3 stars. He is a fool. This is Tokyo 1984 and the show kicks incredible ass. They are on Fire from the opening number and even with the last song ""I can't get enough"" they are smoking hot. klaus' voice is spot on. This is the best they will ever sound. I looked for this show for years and it not only did not disapoint, but was even BETTER than what I expected and I expected the best. Get it if you can find it.",1435363200,,644,3.8863636363636362
8450140,5,B004ZKNC4M,"Long time Scorpions fan and this DVD is great, as this captured there prime in 1984. Like another reviewer on here, I wish ""No One Like You"" was played here, but for what it's worth no biggie. DVD is in fullscreen with 2.0 surround.",1385337600,4,232,4.295454545454546
8450141,3,B004ZKNC4M,"It would be nice to know when this concert was recorded and what the set list was??? For now it just says, ""2011"" which is hardly enough info considering that the photos on the disc cover look much older!",1381708800,,204,4.256410256410256
8450142,4,B004ZKNC4M,"This video captures the Scorpions in what I think was the best time of their career the 80's. I saw them live many times in the 80's and every show they sounded increadible even blew away Van Halen on the Monsters of Rock Tour.
This copy shows them in that form so if your looking for that then it is a must to have in your collection. As for the sound it sounds like it's coming from the soundboard which of course the vocals and the drums are a little hotter than the guitars and bass but you can hear everything quite clear which is cool cause you can really hear the back up vocals too!!
I just wish they had played No One Like you on this video that's the only downside to me.",1349308800,8,681,4.051851851851852
