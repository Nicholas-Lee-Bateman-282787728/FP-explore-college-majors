7796391,3,1563716739,"The film begins at the Bumstead home. Dagwood needs a towel. Daisy retrieves the newspaper. The family has costs and can't go away on vacation. Their 15-year mortgage is nearly paid. A grocer gets rid of Dagwood and his pups. An Army sergeant gives advice to Dagwood and asks him to join the new Army Reserves. A friendly stranger offers financial advice. Is he a crook? Is Dagwood too credulous? Alvin gives his opinion. ""Push button warfare."" Dagwood meets the mailman, again. Now he's in the Army. Dagwood learns the drill. Training continues. Dagwood is tired, but doesn't sleep well. Dagwood has a dream about combat. Blondie and the children leave home. The film shows how a swindler operates to sell a borrowed house.

Dagwood is on the rifle range with his M-1. There is a mix-up. Dagwood learns fast. Who is driving? ""Let's do it again sometime."" ""That's not like us."" Blondie quizzes Dagwood about how it all happened. Can Blondie catch those crooks with a trick? Yes, and it provides more entertainment. Would Blondie make a good detective? Dagwood learned a practical skill and demonstrates it for that grocer. This story is a change from the usual domestic comedy. The prices date this film. [I'm surprised that Alvin didn't figure out the swindle and call the police.]

Was this change from the past formula mean they were trying to increase interest and sales to a declining audience? Was ""J. C. Dithers"" omitted to cut costs?",1241136000,,1441,4.82995951417004
