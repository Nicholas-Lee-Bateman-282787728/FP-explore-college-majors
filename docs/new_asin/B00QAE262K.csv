8690960,5,B00QAE262K,"Getting to the truth can often be a difficult matter and Verbal has quite a story to tell..A big battle for drugs between gangs has apparently taken place on a ship, docked at a pier in San Pedro. There's one survivor from each gang and each one tells the authorities a different story. A badly injured Hungarian thug from his hospital bed speaks about a mysterious gangster, Keyser Soze and a crippled, small time gangster from New York, Verbal Kint. As word of the gunfight spreads between the law enforcement agencies its officals converge into the area. The plot follows the interrogation of Verbal Kint whose story is being constantly adjusted when details from the other interrogation with the Hungarian reach Kint's interrogator, Dave Kujan, who thinks rather highly of himself, has been pursuing Dean Keaton, somebody else at the gun fight, for years. In his mind Dean Keaton is a ruthless, gangster and is determined to get the complete story from Kint who he considers a contemptible small-time con artist. Verbal Kint would willing comply but his job becomes more difficult when Kujan learns from the FBI at the other interview that the Hungarian identified Keyser Soze as one participant in the fight. Later the word seeps back to Kujan that there was no dope on the freighter. The fight must have concerned something else. This obliges Kemp to include Soze and his middleman, Kobayashi, a crooked lawyer into the story for Kujan. Through flasback and narration the story is skillfully told by Verbal Kemp who embellishes it with new details and characters like Kobayashi until Dave Kujan is satisfied that he has learned the truth of the matter. With a smug look on his face he dismisses Kint but the satisfaction quickly disappears when he begins to notice details of Kint's story around the office: the bulletin board from Skokie, Illinois, the picture of a real fat woman and the name of the lawyer on the bottom of the coffee cup quickly convince him that Verbal Kint simply told him the tall tale that he wanted to hear: Keaton was Keyser Soze. And as he rushes off after Verbal Kint the description of Soze that the Hungarian provided the artist in the other interview is sent by fax to the police station with Verbal's face on it. This film is a tale of revenge and deception. How our prejudices affect our judgement. It doesn't need suspense. It runs on irony. Here was one man, Dave Kujan, looking for a story and another man eager to tell him one. It's even comic at times when you consider how the simpleton, Verbal Kemp, manipulates the customs agent, Dave Kujan, who assures him that he'll get to the truth because ""I'm smarter than you"". Kevin Spacey as Verbal Kint, Gabriel Byrne as Dean Keaton were the lead characters in the film and both were superb. They also received plenty of support. Chazz Palminteri as Dave Kujan, and Pete Postlethwaite as Kobayashi were key figures in Verbal's interrogation and his story. The film's strong acting, writing and direction holds your attention from start to finish..",1529798400,2,3037,4.808795411089866

8690965,5,B00QAE262K,"Verbal Kent = mastermind or opportunistic grafter? Or both? Even after seeing this film for like the tenth time Im still unsure of exactly who/ what/ where/ how/ why went down the way it did but the film plays with us at every level, and its wonderful. Verbal Kent (Kevin Spacey in his breakout role), hauled in by smug Customs agent Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) who was investigating an alleged drug trafficking operation that left a lot of bodies strewn around a docked ocean vessel, weaves a web of lies and deception with lines of truth to satisfy the cops simplistic line of understanding. Only after Kujan has released Kent back to the world believing that the serpentine street justice of criminals eating their own will swallow up Kent does Kujan realize after looking around his office and seeing bits of info and names strewn around it (like the name of Kobayashi on the bottom of a broken coffee mug that was the name Kent ascribed to nefarious Kaiser Sozes lawyer) that Kent wove a story pulled from all of those little bits, plucked them out of the air as it were, and sold Kujan on it all. Is Verbal Kent the deadly legend Kaiser Soze that he spoke of? Well never know and, again, its a wonderful thing.",1506556800,,1218,4.566210045662101
