Astro Boy, my goodness this Anime was truly ahead of its time. Amazing animation, great use of color and shading, super

storyline and voice acting this series has it all. If you were

to look at this anime right now youd swear it was made in 2004

not 1980, thats how great it is. Anime fans you must add and

buy this set into your series, I guarantee youll thank me

for it. Astro Boy contains great action, family values, a complex

storyline, many different outcomes and a great moral being

in Astroboy, its a shame more cartoons in the US cant

follow this formula with all the shameful violence on TV.

The 1980's version of Astro Boy is a remake of the 1960's version created by Osamu Tezuka, the Japanese is actually called

""Shin Tetsuwan Atom"", no matter what you call its a legendary

anime. I had the pleasure of seeing some of the rare 60's

episodes and the 80's version and man both were great.

It shows how even way back when the Japanese had a great vision

of what great cartoons and animation were all about. Its

no wonder most of our beloved heroes like Goku, YuyuHakusho

Yugioh all come from the orient.

In the 80's version just like the original, the original

Astroy boy is created after the human boy dies. His father

exploits his son (a moral tale) for his own scientific purposes,

but when Astro commits a series of blunders, his father

disowns him like some bad fathers do.

""The Birth of Astro Boy"" then follos young Astro as he

comes to grips with the situation and tries to cope with the

fact that his father has his own demons. His father has

a change of heart but by then its a tad too late.

In the next ""Robot Circus"" much like the tale of the Elephant

Man and the ringleader in ""Pinochio"" Astro's unsual

appearence and style cause him to be captured by a greedy

circus owner who pretends to be his friend only to yes

exploits like some sort of greedy American. Astro

meets some unusual characters and performs in the circus

before being rescued. The animation in this episode is simply

astonishing, the budget for the series had to be at least

$10000 for several episodes, its all top of the line stuff.

In  ""Save the Classmate"" Astroboy finally is put on the school,

but some of the mean kids bully him (yes a moral tale

about bullying, man imagine if people actually took this

topic seriously it would have saved so many tragedies).

The real contradiction here is that other robots are also

in school, yet humans have a tremendous prejudice despite

claiming that everyone has rights.  Eventually something

bad happens, but Astro comes to the rescue and earns

the respect of his classmates.

The fourth episodes ""Atlas Lives"" is another monumental

episodes, Astro encountes an old enemy whom he used to be friends

with, Atlas, who has been remanufacted and is leaner and meaner.

He aids criminals now and now he wants Astro to join him.

Yes another moral episode this time detailing Greed, and the

enticement and corruption of others for the pursuit of abslute

power (sounds familiar to George Bush and his ties to corporations). Eventually Astroboy resists the temptations but

Altas too pathetic to take his answer kidnaps Astroboy's

robotic parents and uses them for ransom while fighting Astro.

Astro eventually prevails and Atlas in all his shameful

glory is destroyed. Man just a great episode and again

top of the line animation and the dubbing is fantastic.

I could on about this great set, but get the vhs or get

the dvd box set parents, you won't regret it, in fact youll thank

me.

Recently too Astroboy is once again primed to make a comeback

as a 2005 is already planned. Astroboy then is one of the oldest

anime's and cartoons ever made with thirty years experience

and counting and now you why this a great cartoon that you must

get.",1104105600,,3891,4.567685589519651
7842617,2,6303239021,"Review is of the product, not Astro Boy who is always wonderful.. ^___^
 A poor effort at film to video transfer... With the wealth of tools available to restore old films and bring this type of vintage material ""up-to-date"" these videos are a big disappointment. The glossy 4-color package doesn't make up for the many glaring flaws on the films which could have been digitally ""cleaned-up"" but its obvious not much money was involved in the production of these videos. Astro Boy, the first ever regular TV anime by the great Tezuka deserves better than this. This caliber product wouldn't not even be offered for sale in Japan where high quality standards are the norm.",1091491200,,671,4.834782608695652
7842618,4,6303239021,"Astro Boy is a color remake of the sixties series, that in addition, seems to move the overall series-wide plot faster. As an example, the original series did not introduce Uran (Astro Girl) until the twenty-fifth episode. Yet, in this series, she makes her debut in the thirteenth episode. * This series devotes an entire episode to his creation and another whole episode to the Robot Circus, both of which were in the first episode of the original series. Note that tapes one through three of this series each contain five episodes, while tapes in the original series each contain only two episodes. Moreover, the first series' tapes do not seem to put the episodes in chronological order.** This remake series has a more clear development of the building plot from episode to episode, and it is therefore, more easy to follow. First Astro Boy, then his 'parents', then his ""little sister"" enter the scene, but not all on this tape.
His human-like qualities and relationships are much more a part of this series' than the original. More emphasis on school, home, family, than the 60s series. His being different (i.e. a robot), causes some friction at school, as his human classmates flaunt their humanity, and poke fun at his being a robot, but he soon gains acceptance among them. He and his robotic family live in a house go about their business, as do humans; mama goes shopping, kids play, they even go on vacation.
Astro is not subject to mischief as are his classmates. Even his sister gets into trouble, and girls are not usually as troublesome as boys are. He is subject to peer pressure, and in one episode on tape three, his desire to be cool and do as his classmates ask, accidentally disables his leg jets, preventing him from saving the day in his usual fashion. The series seems to provide good morals despite its violence, as yielding to peer pressure is not a good idea for anyone. The series shows what happens when people do stupid things.
 In this series, as in the original Astro Boy faces Isaac Asimov's classic robot dilemma as expressed in his three laws. He may not through action or lack thereof, cause harm to a human. He must obey human orders, except if such orders are to violate the first law. He will not accept orders from just any human, though. And, He must preserve his own existence, except where so doing would violate the first two laws. Yet, because his duty is to fight crime, he must occasionally fight humans. So, he clearly cannot keep the first law, except when it comes to killing: Astro Boy does not kill humans. He only does good things.
A hero with the emotions, judgement, and intelligence of a nine-year old, can occasionally find himself in situations that tax those attributes. As a child, he simply does not know how to handle some situations. His kindness and compassion lead him to take action that adults would forbid if they knew of his intentions. He is utterly selfless, putting humans' and even animals' needs before his own, tirelessly risking his own existence as he defends those weaker than himself. One can find some commendable morals in this series, that little children might absorb as they watch it. It does seem that this remake was intended for young viewers more than all viewers; yet, I found is entertaining and often funny.

Episodes on this tape:
Note. If you have seen S. Spielberg's AI, you will most definitely see where he got his ideas after viewing these first two episodes.
""The Birth of Astro boy"" Details the tragic death of his creator's son, Toby. Dr. Boynton is so devastated by this loss, that he decides to create a robotic replacement for his lost son. For some strange reason, he insists on one hundred thousand horsepower, jets in his hands and feet, lasers in his index fingers, spotlights in his eyes, and machine guns in his fanny. Franz Liszt's ""Le Prelude"" accompanies Astro's awakening.
""Robot Circus"". After deceiving him into signing on, the Ringmaster soon finds him unsuitable for the tasks he had given him because he misinterprets them, and soon finds himself in trouble with the boss. He soon shows himself a talented acrobat, and goes on to save the day when things go wrong.
""Save the Classmate"" Astro starts school in the third grade, but finds himself rejected by some students, who pick on him. The overgrown Alvin makes himself his enemy, but soon sees Astro's value as a friend.
""Astro's First Love"". This one is very sad, and might be too frightening for the very young. Astro meets a girl robot named Niki while he is on a mission, only to discover that she has a deadly secret.
""Save the Carolina 3"". The title refers to a space station that the bad guys attempt to take over using the threat of harming the captain's little boy as leverage. Astro saves the day, as usual.

 *Other than viewing the tapes, most of what I have been able to learn about the original series' episodes, I found at website devoted to Astro Boy.
 **The 60s series tapes put Astroboy's birth and ""The monster Machine"" together on the first tape, but according to the web sites, ""The monster Machine"" is the sixty-ninth episode.",1047254400,7,5122,4.705685618729097
7842619,4,6303239021,"This cassette was my first exposure to an animated Astro Boy, and while I was thrilled with the cartoons, the video quality was less than perfect. The flaw was in the recording, however, and not in the cassette (in other words, the cassette wasn't damaged). Other copies may not contain the same flaw, and the episodes are a fun, black and white trip back in time, so I recommend the video for anyone looking for an enjoyable anime history lesson.",978480000,4,447,4.6
