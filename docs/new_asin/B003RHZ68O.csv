8403641,2,B003RHZ68O,"Brought this DVD expecting a British drama of old.  Found it hard going to watch - and I'm a John Thaw fan.
Brought High Tide and Dangerous Knowledge at the same time - never thought I would find them so hard going.
I found the acting dated (which is funny for me as I like old TV dramas and movies) in fact I fastward Dangerous Knowledge (thought it might speed up the story - wrong -  And Ian McShane in High Tide well I really can't say what I think of him - Lovejoy where were you? In fact I would sell these DVD's don't think they are worth keeping.
Brought them from Amazon no complaint with them they arrived ahead of the delivery date and in perfect condition.",1319846400,,668,4.170542635658915

 Special footnote, actor John Thaw had great success as Detective Inspector Regan in ""The Sweeney"" (1975) - also with ""Inspector Morse"" (1987), Thaw was yet again cast as a policeman, but this time a more cultured character than Regan --- Morse was Thaw's most popular and long-running project --- It established him as British television's most bankable actor, and during the 1990s he had many other starring vehicles --- Thaw was a favorite of film director Richard Attenborough, who cast him in ""Cry Freedom"" (1987) and ""Chaplin"" (1992).

Under some good direction and an outstanding cast with a copy that is good for viewing --- Check out ""The British Are Coming"" is the three minute sum and pieces of various British Films coming attractions to view on VCI, other than that no other bonus or extras --- Highly recommend for all the collectors of ""British Films"" from the early '70s with good drama characterization --- Take note of the hair styles and clothing that is clearly the '60s and '70s, and made casual living the uniform of the day from then on.
