5524610,4,B00AWQEK26,"How far would you go to build a paradise for yourself and the one you love?
Some would go far...Just like the two characters portrayed by S.Rideau and D.Durdaine. First is a middle-aged escort-man and the latter is his younger (much younger) version. They meet, they fall in love, they want to be together no matter what. Their paradise is built on crime. Many crimes.
Not giving away the plot, I will just write that there is no happy-ending to this story.
And the film could have had a subtitle: ""Our paradise, their hell"".
Good story (although the part of Angelo could have been developed more, I mean we know nothing about his past) and very good acting. I have seen S.Rideau in both ""Le clan"" and ""Presque rein"". The older he gets, the better actor he becomes.",1361750400,4,765,4.550724637681159
5524611,5,B00AWQEK26,"Our Paradise (Notre Paradis) is the latest film from Gael Morel of `Le Clan' fame. It stars Stephane Rideau (`Presque Rien') as Vassili, an ageing rent guy who cruises the streets of Paris looking for tricks. He is also a dab hand at `finishing his clients off' and I do not mean in a `professional' way - yes he's a murderer. Then one wet, Parisian night he stumbles across a young man who has been attacked and robbed. He decides to help him and ends up taking him home. The boy has no name and says no memory of before he met Vassili.

So they decide to give him a name and hit upon Angelo (Dimitri Durdaine in his big screen debut). They then start a passionate relationship that does not exclude paying clients. Then they start to work as a team, but Angelo is attracting most of the attention and Vassili can't let his own proclivities stay dormant for too long. They end up seeking their paradise which will involve others, with unexpected consequences.

This is a really original piece of cinema, it is acted superbly the shots are framed with the eye of an artist and it is still tasteful, despite some of the less wholesome scenes. We have a plethora of scenarios especially with Vassili's clients and the stories of a number of the characters all told along the way. This is one of those films that you don't even think about looking at the clock, it is paced so perfectly and flows so well; there is some nudity as you would probably expect, but I did not feel any of it is gratuitous. For gay cinema fans or even fans of gay cinema this is an absolute must.",1349913600,20,1570,4.373287671232877
5524612,5,B00AWQEK26,"I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I expected to based on other online reviews. There is a good bit of nudity, but not a lot more of Dimitri Durdaine than anybody else, and (in contrast to at least two others, including Stphane Rideau) none of him that would qualify as ""full frontal"" - ""full side"" is more like it, and even those rarely show much except skin. Some other reviews give the impression that he almost never wears clothes and that the camera examines every square inch of his body, neither of which is true at all.

What there IS more of in this movie than most is naked middle-aged and older men, which may bother some people but delights me. Except for Durdaine, all of the naked men in this movie have pot bellies, including Rideau (who's getting comfortably close to middle age himself), which is wonderfully refreshing in an age when only bronzed and hairless gym bodies under 30 ever appear in American gay movies (Can we say BOR-ing?).

Now that nudity's out of the way... There's something I like a lot about Gal Morel's movies, but I'm not sure what it is. There's something very natural or unpretentious about them, something familiar and almost comforting, regardless of the subject matter. I feel like I'm among friends when I watch his movies. They FEEL good in some mysterious way comparable movies by other directors don't. He has an eye and a style and a language that are quite distinctive but not easy to define; whatever it is, I like it.

Don't let the crime element fool you: Our Paradise is above all else a love story. Vassili (Rideau), a rough, surly, aging hustler who is already in the habit of killing johns who offend him (and many do, since he's getting old and out of shape), finds a kid (Durdaine) beaten unconscious in a cruising park in Paris, takes him home and cares for him. Because the kid looks like an angel and has an angel tattoo in the lower right corner of his abdomen, and since he won't tell his name, Vassili tries ""Angel"" in various languages; the kid likes Angelo best, so that's who he is from then on. And from then on he is devoted to Vassili. Nothing that happens (and a lot does) shakes his devotion, and that devotion is the heart of this movie.

Angelo is not stupid or a masochist; he doesn't relate to Vassili as slave to master, cub to bear, boy to daddy, or any of the other gay May-December stereotypes. He simply loves Vassili. When Vassili sees that Angelo really does love him and has no desire to find somebody his own age, he relaxes and begins to trust the relationship too. It's lovely. All of their interactions, including several beautiful sex scenes, reinforce the growing strength of their relationship. None of the sex is gratuitous (whatever that means) or forced.

The backdrop for this sweet and tender romance, of course, are Vassili's increasingly rough tricks (since he's no longer young and hot, he has to do kinkier stuff to stay in business), which are depicted in pretty graphic detail, and his habit of killing johns who make wisecracks about his age. Angelo tries to get him to stop the killing, but it becomes obvious he won't, so rather than leave Vassili Angelo stays with him and occasionally helps.

It's really not much different from Bonnie and Clyde, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, or any of countless other mainstream movies about criminal couples... EXCEPT: this is France, so even the murders are civilized, and (Thank God!) guns never play any part in the movie. (What a relief not once to hear the sound of a gun being fired!)

There are no chases, no near escapes, no explosions, none of the noisy, overwrought melodrama that stuffs Hollywood crime movies like fat in a goose's liver. This is a quiet movie, a civilized movie, an intelligent movie. Every murder makes sense because we see them from Vassili's point of view. From the outside he may look like a psychopath, but we see the human being more than the crime; we see a man who is as gentle as a lamb with the (surprisingly many) people he loves and who wipes out the ones who make him unhappy. He's just doing what most of us would LIKE to do.

Even toward the end, when his motives for killing expand, there remains something about everything he does that just feels RIGHT for that character. He does it because he has to. He does it because the ones he kills need to be killed. He has his own moral code, and within that code everything he does is perfectly consistent.

I will emphasize again that Our Paradise is above all a love story, a sweet and surprising love story between a very young man and another nearly twice his age. This movie is about as unconventional as a movie can be - it follows no stereotypes of any genre, and yet it's somehow even more comfortable and familiar than stereotypes are; it's like a gift from an old friend. I don't know of anybody but Morel who can pull off a feat like this with what seems like no effort at all.",1344470400,34,4931,4.525252525252525

5524618,4,B00AWQEK26,"Nice story of two men who would do anything to be together including kill.  As the movie starts we meet V, a hustler of a particular age that when he gets his fill from his customers he hurts them and/or kills them and takes the money. He stumbles upon young and innocent Angelo in a park and the two quickly become inseparable as the older V teaches Angelo all about the business and love.
As time progresses the two must flee the area as the men that V has swindled or hurt run into him from time to time and they decide to reconnect with people from V's past. An old flame surfaces who gives the two men a place to live and her son looks up to the two as father figures and gives him some men to look up to. As the three men go on to their next journey the murder spree slowly catches up to them and the fantasy comes to a screeching halt.

This was really a good story, some nice acting with a decent script. Some male nudity especially from the very attractive Angelo and some sex scenes 3 ways etc. I liked how the men thought they could take and do what they wanted no matter what the cost and the ending although brief paid off as a case of misunderstanding ended the fantasy.

Yes, that cliche again.

5524625,2,B00AWQEK26,"Vassilli is an aging hustler who can no longer pass for the thirty years that he tells his clients. And while some of them still sleep with him, most of them invariably comment about his age.
Angelo is a young hustler that Vasslilli finds beaten up in a park. He brings him back to his home and he nurses him back to health. The men fall in love, perhaps because Angelo holds what Vassilli wants (youth and beauty) and Vassilli provides what Angelo needs (security).
But Vassilli has a secret. He's a serial-killer. And that's where the film gets murky.
The film seems to want us to believe that Vassilli is murdering out of self-loathing. He doesn't love himself, and when rejected, he lashes out. But as the story beats on, we seen Vassilli murder those who have done him no wrong and those who have offered to help him. All the while, Angelo (who never kills anyone) isn't surprised, shocked, or put off by Vassilli's action. He watches a couple of murders as if they are everyday occurrences.
Add to the plot a mother who would prefer the company of paid young men (and a menage a trois) to the care of her disrespectful and disobedient son, and you have a film full of characters without redeeming qualities. Not only do they have no redeeming qualities, they aren't particularly likeable either. Not that the protagonist or antagonist, in this case, needs to be likeable or redeeming, but he needs to be intriguing enough to hold our attention. And that's where Vassilli and the people around him fail. We never see beneath the surface; and what's on the surface doesn't merit much of a look.",1423094400,,1598,4.610526315789474

But even Rideau cannot save this disjointed movie.  There is nothing original or interesting about it.  I felt as if I was watching a rehashed version of 'Cruising', with gay sex, naked bodies, and murder used to keep the viewers interested.  But even all that is boring.  Then there are the two leads.  There is no sexual chemistry whatsoever between Rideau and Dimitri Durdaine.  Their love/sex scenes are forced and unemotional, with Durdaine appearing totally uncomfortable throughout.  The best thing about the movie is the ending.  Well, not the ending itself, but that the movie was finally over.",1407542400,4,757,4.984

Unfortunately, Vassili also has a murderous streak and enjoys killing and robbing his johns, which ultimately leads to the two men fleeing Paris for Lyons. Vassili has an old friend, Anna (Batrice Dalle) there, who has become a magician's apprentice and lives with her son and aged mother. She has named her son ""Vassili"" in her gay friend's honor.

From Lyons, Vassili takes Angelo and the younger Vassili to the luxurious home of a wealthy, former john, Victor (Didier Flamand), who has now found his soul mate in Kamel (Malik Issolah), a young Arab street boy he has brought back from Tangiers. Kamel feels that his turf is being invaded. And when Vassili announces that Anna will soon be joining the cumbersome party, pent-up emotions erupt into a shattering climax.

5524634,3,B00AWQEK26,"A moody tale of homicidal, yet oddly sympathetic, Parisian rent boys, ""Our Paradise"" is especially disconcerting for fans of French LGBT cinema. International non-heteronormative* heartthrob Stphane Rideau was 18 in 1994 when he co-starrred with 24-year old Gal Morel in the iconic ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wild-Reeds/dp/1572522178/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wild Reeds</a>"", a perennial on best-of lists not only for LGBT flicks, but French films in general. Two years later, Morel directed Rideau in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Full-Speed/dp/B000A7DW8A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Full Speed</a>,"" the first of several films they made together that secured Rideau stardom in not only in France but with LGBT audiences worldwide.

Why twenty years later these two chose to collaborate on such a peculiar and ultimately unsatisfying story of a sex worker past his sell-by date is a puzzlement tinted by nostalgia for Rideau's lost youthful allure. Unlike American actors of his generation with personal trainers to keep them looking hot well into their 40s, Rideau at 38 is neither self-conscious nor apologetic about nakedly displaying two decades of cigarettes' and alcohol's heavy toll, here sharply contrasted with the smooth, fair skin of a young hustler he takes in after stumbling across the bashed-up lad in the Bois de Boulogne.

Everyone in the film feels the losses from the passing of time--hardly a fresh topic--but to suggest that Rideau's character is only reasonable, if not always strictly compelled to eliminate all these aging homosexuals (none but one are remotely pleasant persons) leaves a lingering queasiness and me still wondering why, if they wanted to work together again, Rideau and Morel couldn't find a less depressive script.

* ""non-heteronormative"" because the real Rideau has a wife and a child. All it means is that ""straight"" may not be the only ""normal,"" and given the roles he's chosen, that Rideau would appear to agree. It's a work-around word because it would not be accurate to label Rideau a ""gay"" heartthrob when plenty of women admire him as well.  Incidentally, although it's my opinion that the guy would likely feel better (and quite possibly pick more interesting scripts) if he got his flabby butt to the gym once in a while, he nonetheless yet has considerable charm.",1398211200,2,2406,5.693593314763231

5524648,4,B00AWQEK26,"An interesting concept.
Is morality right if it is your own morality and not that of society?
This French offering shows the seamier side of gay life in Paris and does not try to show the city in any warm glow.

The main character Vassili is an ageing rent ""boy"" with something of a hot temper and no reluctance whatsoever to dispense with the lives of those who either offend him or get in his way.
He's fighting his own demons, ...ageing and loss of beauty, the younger generation outshining him on the street,a lessening ability to make money from self-prostitution, and a burgeoning sense of failure as he approaches middle age.
His family life has been somewhat traumatic and dysfunctional, but he harbours a desire for sense of ""fatherhood"".

As mentioned in the other reviews he ""finds"" a young twink (later named Angelo) all bloodied and unconscious in a well-known beat, and picks him up.
The kid tries to say he's OK and sets about trying to find a ""john"" so he'll have a place to sleep for the night. When our older Vassili recognises the one that stops to make the pick-up from prior dealings, he steps in and takes the young twink home to his own apartment.

There a love affair is kindled, ..and Vassili vacillates between the protective role of lover and that of an exploiter. While he professes feelings for the younger one, he readily encourages Angelo to sell his youthful sexual favours to others. Sex is obviously not seen as an specific expression of love here, but a commodity to be used to the full while it lasts.

Gradually the young foundling becomes aware of just how far his saviour is prepared to go to get what he wants, ...and becomes drawn into complicity, stopping just short of any actual killing himself. He's aware that it happens and actually tries to discourage Vassili from committing any further murders, but is unsuccessful as the power coming from the ability to dispose of ""worthless johns"" is the only prop to the killer's own sense of masculinity.

In the centre of this movie there is a most strange piece of ""editing"", ...or rather lack thereof.
The group I watched this with actually thought the disc had either skipped or we had jumped to another movie altogether due to some faulty glitch.
A mother and her child are shown in a totally new domestic situation, with no reference to what has gone before at all.
This goes on for about fifteen minutes and can leave everyone a bit puzzled, but it eventually ties in, and we are told that the women is actually an old associate of our Vassili, ...and her child might be his from a prior brief liaison. (He's not above ""jumping the fence"" sexually, ...in fact all three share several menage--trois couplings later on.)
Vassili almost immediately adopts a father-like role and tries to give the child anything he wants, despite the objections of the mother.

The situation in the underground gay scene heats up as Vassili continues his killings, ....it's quite surprising he's never caught as there's absolutely no attempt to clean up the crime scenes and there's enough DNA/fingerprints/clues left that would point to him immediately. He's even recognised as the attacker in a gay bar!

Flight from Paris would seem prudent and he and Angelo, plus the young boy catch a taxi and go to the smart home of a prior elderly client of Vassili's.
He immediately sticks his host with the 250 euro taxi fare and proceeds to enjoy every luxury his wealthy former associate can provide, ..much to the displeasure of the home-owners attractive and younger live-in lover, who can see through Vassili's using and self-gratifying personality.
It is proposed by Vassili that the kid's mother come for a holiday from Paris, ...but this is vetoed at the last minute by the disagreement and subsequent making up of the host and his lover.
The kid is heartbroken and Vassili decides to grant the child's wish by whatever means within his power, ...and has no hesitation about letting old friendships, the law or gratitude for the generosity of his host get in the way.

The ending is not without its shock value and the questions of personal morality are set out for the audience to ponder.
Has Angelo been corrupted by Vassili, ....or indeed is it the other way round? What dark internal or external forces drive Vassili to do what he does?
Is Angelo the innocent angel or the compliant provocateur of evil?

This is a dark and quite sinister movie in many ways, but thought provoking and raw in its depiction of a sleazy under-world not often associated with Paris.
Of course it exists, but we are shown a quite unblinkered view of the kinks, predilections and predations of some of the characters.
Yes there is full frontal nudity if you need to be warned, but it's hardly titivating. Everyone, with the exception of the quite beautiful younger teen is definitely shown as all too human with all the faults and ugliness that can involve.

It's subtitled, and although the ending may seem fairly abrupt and somewhat peremptory, almost as if the budget ran out, this movie will have you talking about the motives and values of the characters for quite a while.

 For those that may be interested I'd recommend another French movie that almost perfectly ""book-ends"" this one.
Where ""Our Paradise"" is dark and dysfunctional, ....""Bad Boy Street"" is bright and representative of the ""other"" side of gay life in Paris.
Curiously, both movies begin with exactly the same premise, ...namely the finding of an unconscious younger man on the street and what happens when he is brought home.
I'd recommend seeing both movies, but ""Bad Boy Street"" might seem a bit tame to some after the violent criminal activities depicted in ""Our Paradise"".",1366934400,6,5709,4.773049645390071

8558505,5,B00AWQEK26,"Amazing movie, I would recommend it to anyone. I usually hate subtitles but the way they did it made it easy with an extremely light delay so you can watch the movie and then glance down and read the subtitle in between the characters speaking. It's not like they paused to allow this but the timing of the speech and when the subtitles pop up just happened to end up perfect so you can enjoy the movie and understand it as well. The storyline was also unique and I enjoyed seeing the way Angelo seemed to try to shower Vissili with love, as if he could possibly fix him. Very unique relationship but there are a few things that bothered me.

There was more nudity of the unattractive extra's than anyone else. I am not a shallow person but I like to enjoy what I am looking at. You also never find out what actually happened to Angelo to cause him to be laying on the ground unconscious and you never learn his real name. They also really left a lot to want as far as his background is concerned. Parents? Friends? He makes a friend but you learn nothing about him or his life before he is found injured. Yet Visilli's background and person is much more explored when I honestly think that Angelo is the heart of the movie.

Spoilers ahead.

I also did not like that they had sex with that woman, it ruins the relationship factor and leaves me to believe that they were not enough for each other yet they were supposed to be deeply in love. Aside from this and one other encounter in which Angelo participates in a mans cheating, the two seem monogamous through out the movie, only hustling and swindling when they need to.

Get the movie, it's worth it and see what you get from it yourself.",1478304000,,1693,4.331230283911672

Without ""spoiling"" anything for anyone, one of them is an outright serial killer.  Both men are attractive, and there's lots of sex, almost to the point of it being soft porn.  Otherwise a pretty engrossing film, well worth a watch.",1434240000,,392,4.8059701492537314
