8318397,5,B001LKLKJS,Who knew that Hitler loved Wagner's music and the annual festival that he could overlook the fact that Max Lorenz was a gay man AND that he was married to a Jewish wife.  It is an amazing story with interviews of several Wagnerian Tenors and other persons who were there when all this happened in the early to mid-Nazi era.,1439769600,,323,4.383333333333334
8318398,4,B001LKLKJS,"I would have given this item five stars were it not for the audio bonus, a live first act of Siegfried with wretched sound.
The title is also unfortunate as Lorenz is revealed as a warm human being who protected his Jewish wife and her family
as well as numerous other artists during that very difficult time.  The footage of the inimitable Lorenz is accompanied
by glowing tributes from such major artists as Hilde Zadek, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Rene Kollo, and Waldemar Kmennt,
who are much more positive about Lorenz's clarion open-throated technique than many critics of his recordings have been.
Personally, I find his true tenor voice better suited to roles such as Tristan than such famous Wagnerians as Melchior and
Vinay with their baritonal quality.  The documentary includes a death scene from Otello with piano accompaniment sung by
an aged Lorenz that is unforgettably heartbreaking.  With a few notable exceptions, we have had to settle in recent years for
tenors better suited to Tamino attempting to get through Siegfried.  Lorenz reminds us of what a true Heldentenor sounds like.",1432857600,2,1099,5.088888888888889
8318399,5,B001LKLKJS,"The more I listen to Lorenz, the greater my appreciation, not just the power but also the remarkable expressiveness in everything he sang. I find the same expressiveness in the recordings of Roswaenge and Konya. Preiser has released several excellent CDs, which I highly recommend",1391212800,,280,5.2444444444444445
8318400,5,B001LKLKJS,"He was the great Siegfried of the thirties and lasted thru the fifties. He is remembered by his friends in this video and placed in historical context of WWII Germany, and he sang thru the war. I admire him greatly and you will too, so get a copy for yourself, if you love Wagner as I do.",1376784000,,288,4.0701754385964914
8318401,3,B001LKLKJS,The story of this singer is interersting. but I was hoping the material wounld contain quite a bit more of orchestral or singing pieces. Perhaps I misread the previous comments.,1365897600,,177,4.933333333333334
8318402,5,B001LKLKJS,A VERY INTERESTING AND EXCELLENT BIOGRAPHY OF MAX LORENZ AND THE TIME IN WHICH HE LIVED.  MUSICAL SELECTIONS ARE EXCELLENT AND EVEN HIS PERFORMANCES IN OLD AGE.,1362096000,2,160,4.925925925925926
8318403,5,B001LKLKJS,"Absolutely fascinating revelatory and inspiring especially concerning the machinations of the Third Reich's imbroglio with the decadent Wagner Bayreuth enclave, that lived a charmed and isolated existence during all the horrors. The conflict between Lorenz and his wife's would be butchers is all the more extraordinary, using his preeminent talent and influence to protect his family, to that extent the title of this videogram is disingenuous, as Lorenz was one of the very few artists of his generation to stand up to the abhorrent racial theorizing and ethnic cleansing that infected every aspect of Germany in the 30's and 40's. the curious conceit would be to ponder whether he used his wife's Jewishness as his passport out of Bayreuth,which had circumstances been otherwise would have utterly contaminated his career and travel plans after the end of hostilities.

8318404,5,B001LKLKJS,"A remarkable documentary of this unusually fine Wagnerian tenor with tasty insights into the Bayreuth Festival of the War Years, including some rare footage of performances and a brief appearance by Winifred Wagner herself!!",1242864000,8,224,5.617647058823529
8318405,5,B001LKLKJS,"This release includes a fascinating video on the life and artistry of Max Lorenz, plus a CD of excerpts of him singing in a Buenos Aires (Teatro Colon) SIEGRIED from 1938 (under Erich Kleiber), never before released on CD, to my knowledge. Interviews with such singers as Dietrich Fiescher-Dieskau and stunning clips of Lorenz at Bayreuth are included. Highly recommended for a better understanding of a significant, but often misunderstood, artist.",1238371200,9,449,5.338028169014085
8318406,5,B001LKLKJS,"This is a fascinating document that left me wanting more, more footage, more singing, background. Lorenz was a fascinating complex man who in spite of being married to a Jew and a practicing ""bi-sexual"" he was able to remain in Nazi Germany without any persecution to him, his wife and his mother-in-law! He was apparently caught ""in flagrante"" and his crimianal prosecution was announced. Obviously his presence at Bayreuth was in doubt. Winifred advised that the festival would have to close down without Lorenz; this was sufficient to provide him with protection until after the war.

Fischer-Dieskau, Hilda Zakek, Rene Kollo and Waldemar Knmett (sp?) offer their observations and it is fascinating to watch Kollo mouth the text as Lorenz sings. The author of a biography of the artist is also present to offer his observations. It is highly unlikely that this book will ever see an English translation.

Medici Arts also provice a recording the of Act I Siegfried the sound of which is poor. Would that a better memorial of his art could have been chosen. Even so I recommend this DVD for its many virtues.",1233792000,21,1110,4.898936170212766
