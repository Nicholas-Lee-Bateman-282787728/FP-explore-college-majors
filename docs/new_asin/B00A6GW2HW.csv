8546917,1,B00A6GW2HW,"I guess if a person is looking for a ""talking head"" take on Haight Ashbury then this would be ok - but it is impossible to put the 60s in context with almost no archival footage.  There are small glimpses here and there of what life was like on the streets and a couple of bands playing, but other than that - all of the footage is contemporary.  Not only is it contemporary, but it just emphasizes how gentrified the Haight has become.  Though showing the area in it's current state is important, the filmmakers go overboard with it.
For lots of great footage and interesting commentary, I would suggest the following docs:  American Experience- The Summer of Love, The Trips Festival and Dawn of the Dead (although this doc is about the early days of the band, it is also a great intro to what the Acid Tests and the Summer of Love were all about).",1427673600,3,850,4.3949044585987265
8546918,4,B00A6GW2HW,"I like it, seem's like a good over-view of the whole 'Haight-Ashbury' scene of the 60's - but then, how can any one DVD cover an era that was so much of a personal experience for each individual or group.",1420502400,,204,4.125
8546919,5,B00A6GW2HW,"This film answered alot about rock n roll history and positive outlook on the counter culture movement.  Was well thought out and had many points of view, right on!!",1420416000,,165,4.689655172413793
8546920,3,B00A6GW2HW,Not that exciting and nothing new.  I just watched it and really don't remember it or anything memorable about it.,1358899200,,114,4.7
