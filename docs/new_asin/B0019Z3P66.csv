8275738,3,B0019Z3P66,"Fascinating historial footage on a topic rarely known by most of the television-viewing public, but poorly-packaged into a documentary that's seemingly more like a series of disjointed snippets of archival footage drawn from a longer production.  There's little continuity in storytelling, some basic facts are left unexplained (who was ""Paul Nipkow,"" the founder and namesake of the Nazis television broadcast system?  This documentary is silent on such an essential fact), and the production makes little effort to explore what was going on with rudimentary television elsewhere in the world so viewers could draw some meaningful conclusions about what the Nazis had accomplished.  The debut of television in America at the New York World's Fair in 1939 is hardly touched, for example.  Given the subject and the availability of rare, remaining footage, this could have been an outstanding documentary, but it falls far short of that mark, because the script and storyboarding are deficient.",1449705600,,993,5.470588235294118
8275739,5,B0019Z3P66,"I did not know that Germany invented and built these things.  My TV experience started in about 1948, a long time after it was used in Germany under the Nazis.  Great documentary!",1419120000,,179,4.5625
8275740,3,B0019Z3P66,"I thought TV originated in the U.S. in the late 1940s. Here we see German television broadcasting by the middle 1930s.

The quality of the broadcasting was remarkable-- clearer and sharper than anything I remember from the 1950s in U.S. broadcasting.

I wish the program had had more on the technical aspects, and less of the silly political content. Although that content isn't that much different from modern television content.

The program would have been better had more time been given to explaining who watched the broadcasting, and where, although at the very end we do see soldiers in hospital both viewing TVand starring on TV.

The footage of amputees training to go back to war is chilling.",1369008000,,702,4.923728813559322
8275741,5,B0019Z3P66,"Before I saw this documentary, I had no idea that Nazi Germany had any television whatsoever! This film is very educational. The Nazis started their televised broadcasts (usually three times per week) in March, 1935 and they continued to air television shows, often in what was called a ""television parlor"" where people could watch a show, until Autumn, 1944 when it was obvious that they were going to lose the war to the Allied forces.

As others note, this is interesting to watch. We see clips of cooking shows; propaganda telling German people what to think; very rare and brief footage of Berlin in 1943; female dancers on display and something that particularly attracted German viewers' attention, the 1936 Olympic Games. However, just another reviewer notes, we DON'T see the horrors of the concentration camps; any broadcasts of the failure of the Nazis to conquer the former Soviet Union and the consequences for the Germans; and we also don't see the cost of Nazi Germany's alliance with Japan and Italy during World War 2.

I would have liked more footage; at 54 minutes this runs a bit short but what we do get is fascinating; we also see an extremely rare vintage television camera made before World War 2 in addition to the clips. There are interviews with men who were television reporters at the time and brief extra features.

Overall, I highly recommend this for anyone studying the history of television, The Third Reich in Germany and/or even World War 2. It could have been longer but it's still a well done documentary.",1326931200,3,1543,4.837121212121212
8275742,4,B0019Z3P66,"An interesting docu of a little known phenomenon in which propaganda and entertainment were meshed into TV shows that seem quite ludicrous today, but which were probably well received in 1930's Germany.  Technological advancement at a time of world upheaval and impending chaos.",1239580800,3,278,5.465116279069767
8275743,5,B0019Z3P66,"In March, 1935, the Greater German Television started broadcasting and didn't stop until around September 1944.  As you can guess some of it was propaganda, racial messages and news about the party.  But what they also show is sports, cooking shows, a behind the scenes look as a hairdresser school and other shows that make you wonder if they had any idea what to do with the strange box.  In fact, because of the cost, they could not reach the wider public like they could with radio or the movies.  In others words, it failed from a propaganda point of view.  But from looking into the mind of the German people in a time of war it is a gem.  Not just because of what they show but because of what they do NOT show.  At 52 minutes it seems short yet packs a huge amount of information for those interested in the subject.  Not much in the way of extras, sad to say.",1236211200,7,868,4.25
8275744,4,B0019Z3P66,"I thought this DVD, (Television Under the Swastika) was very well handled. My only real complaint was that it was not anywhere near long enough! They had thousands of feet of film to possibly use, so I think that cutting all down to about an hour is just too much! The quality of what they did use was great, and the narration was very good. It was good of them to include English sub-titles so we could actually understand what was being said. I recommend it, though it could have been a lot longer.",1228003200,9,500,4.329787234042553
8275745,4,B0019Z3P66,"The phenomenon of the far right using television as a propaganda tool did not begin with Roger Ailes and his Fox ""News"" Channel; 24-hr anti-American/anti-Semitic television did not begin with al Qaeda and the al Zawraa network; the idea of using a full-time government propaganda minister did not begin with the Bush Administration's use of Karl Rove. As early as the 1930s, Adolph Hitler and his Reich Minister of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda, Joseph Goebbels, took a nascent, inchoate technology and turned it into a powerful and effective tool of deception and fear.

In this re-release of the 1999 documentary, Das Fernsehen unter dem Hakenkreuz (Television Under the Swastika), we see the genius of Nazi Germany's Ministry of Propaganda (the Third Reich predecessor to the White House Offices of Political Affairs, Public Liaison, and Strategic Initiatives under G.W. Bush). While the programs appeared, on the surface, to be covering ""everyday life"" in Germany between 1935 and 1944, their true, sinister purpose was to bombard the masses with the Nazi message. Hitler saw propaganda as Television's highest goal. The music & arts programs, garden shows, fitness programs, interviews and public events programs were only intended as a backdrop for the, sometimes subtle, other times not-so-subtle, propagation of the pro-Aryan, Nazi agenda and the misinformation campaign of Hitler and the Third Reich. Of course the ""news"" programs were not intended to inform and, not surprisingly, were very carefully scripted and were often pure fiction sprinkled with a few random, innocuous facts thrown in as a condiment.

Hitler and Goebbels had already, successfully, made use of radio broadcasts. Part of this radio-based propaganda campaign included the development of the very affordable volk-radio which Goebbels hoped would bring the radio into the homes of the German masses, as well as to the peoples across the border that the Nazis had hoped to conquer. While television took this campaign to a new level, the high cost of a set made the dream of bringing TV to masses in their homes unattainable. Only members of the Nazi Party elite had TV sets in their homes. However, the TV broadcasts were available at public ""television parlors"", in hospitals (to raise the morale of troops), and at public gathering sites.

There is a big difference between merely opinionated journalism and sheer propaganda. Although some modern-day broadcasts, such as Al Jazeera or MSNBC, possess an editorial bias towards a certain point-of-view, they do in fact, they do broadcast actual News with objectivity and journalistic integrity as well as presenting a balanced mix of opinions.  On the other hand, Nazi TV's sole purpose was propaganda and only propaganda (more along the lines of the modern-day 24-hr ""news"" networks such as al Zawraa or Fox News Channel). All programs were filtered through Hitler and Goebbels, and, along with the Nazi owned press, were the only sources of ""information"" available to the ""volk"" under Hitler's rule. This had the desired effect of keeping the people uninformed and ignorant. (Think how ignorant American would be, today, if they relied on FNC as their only source of ""information"" and you will get an idea of just how powerful TV was as a weapon in Hitler's arsenal. Fortunately, here in America, we can change the channel. Germans did not have that luxury in the 1930s).

Beyond political motivation for offering TV broadcasts in the first place, the development of televison as a new technology is also very interesting. A portion of this documentary covers this topic.

As the documentary explains, the crude nature of the new technology made live broadcasts very difficult to produce. Live broadcasts were of very poor quality. Indoor (studio based) broadcasts were limited to a very small, and uncomfortable room and the results were always unsatisfactory. The rare broadcasts of outdoor events were of poor quality, as well.

Since the crude technology of the time made live broadcasts difficult and limited, most programs were put onto film first and broadcast later. While the live broadcasts have been lost, an archive of the filmed programs has been found. This DVD documentary offers an interesting selection of excerpts from these programs, including a musical entertainment show with a definite, underlying agenda; man-in-the-street interviews; sporting events (highlighting Aryan superiority); and some seemingly innocuous entertainments with both subliminal as well as blatant racial themes.

With our current knowledge of the truth about that dark time, watching this documentary can be chilling at times. But it's a very entertaining and informative look at this period as well as an indication of how easily TV can be turned into a weapon. The technology of television broadcasting has reached levels they could only dream about in the mid-20th century, and the range of programming is vast. However, television as propaganda continues to thrive today and the parallels between television under the Third Reich and modern broadcast propaganda (al Qaeda's 24-hr television station, al-Zawraa in the Middle East and Ruppert Murdoch's FNC in North America, just to name two) are startling.

This is an important and thought provoking documentary that any student of history, psychology, propaganda, politics or broadcasting should not miss.
