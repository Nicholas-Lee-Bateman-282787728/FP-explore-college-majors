8271870,4,B00068WREI,"I loved this series as a whole, no question. The technique that Sora and Layla spend this volume training for is pretty neat, but the real treat is the training itself. Layla's attitude toward Sora has finally comes full circle as they move from friends to partners. If you've been enjoying the connection between these two characters, this volume will be a great way to end the series. Don't watch it just for the technique. It's not THAT sugoi.",1178928000,,446,4.658227848101266
8271871,5,B00068WREI,"I found that a new title of Kaleido Star called ''Kaleido Star:New Wings 1- Eclipse of the star will be released on Jan. 17 of 2006, would it be the second season? I hope so.",1134172800,,174,4.0
8271872,5,B00068WREI,"Kaleido Star, to which I ascribe the award of Gonzo's finest work to date, has been engaging from start to finish. We begin with a very likable ensemble of main and secondary characters with which we have our adventures. While there are romantic components, it was quite refreshing to find that the focus had not been on love interests, as our Kaleido Star Naegino Sora is both oblivious to and unreciprocating of the interest being shown her. Instead, we have the most interesting take on a shounen anime formula, in which the main character strives to be the best and undergoes trials and hardships towards that end, but spices things up quite a bit by giving us a lovable female lead whose aspirations are noble to begin with but by way of conflict is torn, broken, only to emerge with a clarity of purpose becoming firm and unshakeable.

A talented crew and cast lend their magic to produce this highly entertaining title. Saito Junichi is very daring to take on a circus backdrop but gifted that he is he demonstrates his exceeding competence and brilliance as director and creator. The orchestral music by Kubota Mina is also praise-worthy, featuring nice themes and motifs. I have some minor quibbles, wishing for a richer variety of costume designs and more development of the characters Rosetta, Mia, and Anna.

If ADV can only manage their resources more effectively, we can continue the journey with the much anticipated second half, which introduces a new and fun rival as well as a tragic villain. ADV, hurry it up will ya!",1114387200,,1536,4.7924528301886795
8271873,4,B00068WREI,"Well, we've come to the end of the first season of the excellent Kaleido Star. At the end of volume 5 it was revealed that Layla could see the Fool, the invisible lecherous Spirit of the Stage who blesses the chosen few with stage immortality. These episodes conclude the storyline of season one as Sora and Layla begin to train for the ""Legendary Great Maneuver"", a stunt so dangerous that it has claimed many lives, including Yuri's father and mother. The two girls go to the Grand Canyon to train with Kalos in scenes that would make the Survivor song montages from the Rocky movies look like wimp training. To add even further pressure to Sora and Layla's attempt is the fact that if they fail, Kaleido Stage just might cease to exist. They will have to overcome injuries and self-doubt if they hope to succeed.

This was an excellent series. Even though the subject matter seems less than appealing to male viewers, it will win you over, no matter what gender you are. At times a little sappy, the strength of the characters always carries the show on. The actress that plays Sora is especially noteworthy, playing both comedic and dramatic aspects of the character to the fullest. As usual, the animation is first rate. Highly recommended.

Skimpy extras: Clean Opening and Closing animations, Production sketches. Episode 25 has commentary by two of the English voice actresses. I cannot comment on the dub, since I don't listen to dubbed anime, except in the case of Cowboy Bebop. From what little I listened to, it's the usual suspects, the same women doing little girl voices. Also includes a mini-poster of Sora and a Marion standee.",1105142400,3,1644,4.764912280701754
8271874,5,B00068WREI,"THIS WAS AWESOME!!!I couldn't stop watching it. The ending is so perfect for this series season (yes, there's a second one coming!) that I literally cried during most of the last two episodes. There's so much going on you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll even jump on the couch like a little kid and cheer everyone on. 5 stars is the highest on this scale to get but I give it 5+ stars (at least 8). plus, at the end, there's a preview for the start of the next season. Definately add it to your Wish List!",1102291200,6,502,4.239583333333333
