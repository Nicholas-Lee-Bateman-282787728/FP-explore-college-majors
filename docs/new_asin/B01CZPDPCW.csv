7695174,4,B01CZPDPCW,"It's a very decent sequel with some decent animation aside from some of the cgi that looks a little out of place. The characters are likeable, including the pteranodon Etta, whom I found both beautiful and charming. Most of the songs were nice. The worst being Stinky and Hot (Sounded a little annoying) and the best being Look for the Light sung by Reba McEntire. The plot was easy to follow as well. This, unlike the Wisdom of Friends, is a Land Before Time movie that is worthy of being added to your collection of LBT films.",1459209600,4,528,4.453608247422681
