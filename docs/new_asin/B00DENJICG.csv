5794971,1,B00DENJICG,Not even a B-movie. Just a very bad movie. It sucks to the 3rd power of sucking. Pleas buy at own risks.,1398816000,3,104,3.772727272727273
5794972,5,B00DENJICG,"A gripping piece of cinema (only detractor really for me was tattoo displayed by one minor character, not a fan, bar that good watch!)",1385683200,6,134,4.625
5794973,4,B00DENJICG,A Horror with action somewhere deep in the forrest. Beautiful actresses and nice pictures. I like this movie. Good for Halloween time.,1383091200,9,134,5.136363636363637
5794974,2,B00DENJICG,"First of all, why were these characters even together? Noone seemed to like anyone. Secondly, why did the ""ranger"" become a zombie-like butcher?  Thirdly, how stupid can someone be? I mean these folks were just set-ups for a little piercing. And, as a strange production note, the characters were all Brits, but the license plate was from New York. where was this film made?",1506556800,,374,4.84375

5794976,3,B00DENJICG,What a bunch of idiots. They go camping with nothing to defend themselves with. They don't even have anything to chop wood or cut twigs. Then they got me yelling at the screen to get up and hit the guy or don't wander out in the woods with a lamp and your underwear and expect to scare someone off. Then someone finally knocks the loony on the head and what does he do. Drops his own weapon  and leaves the loony with his and runs away. Did anyone think the SUV was going to start? I know I didn't. Then she got the thing running the guy she likes is did and she sits there. What the f...... REVERSE get out of there find people with guns in your country which I guess is some kind of special police in Britain. WOW! At least it wasn't some shaky cam crap.,1505952000,,756,4.04

What, does that make sense? :)",1505606400,,69,5.2727272727272725
5794978,1,B00DENJICG,This movie was terrible. Even though it was only about an hour in length it was still too long. The serial-killer-camping-in-the-woods horror subgenre is a hard one to get wrong but this film succeeded in taking a tried and true concept and butchering it. There were points in which it seemed as though the actors were just adlibbing the dialogue to fill a scene. A lot of people have commented that this is a good throwback to 80s horror movies; go watch those instead and do not waste your time on this.,1505520000,2,505,4.5
5794979,4,B00DENJICG,"A back-to-basics, stalk-and-slash horror movie. Just old school pop culture-less, cell phone-less, torture porn-less story that replies on story and character rather than boobs, gore and too much comedy, featuring a creepy looking killer that doesn't need to wear a mask to be intimidating.

A little short due to script cuts and budget, but it's straight-to-the-point and has a beautiful picture and sound.",1476576000,6,407,5.4603174603174605
5794980,5,B00DENJICG,"Sparrow is a look-a-like of Friday The 13th. A great story and cool kills, It has a lot of skill and that all I have to say about this film.",1435536000,2,140,3.7

8592611,1,B00DENJICG,Unlikable cast. Excessive unsteady camera. A really amateurish effort.,1530921600,,70,6.888888888888889
8592612,2,B00DENJICG,"Very generic slasher-in-the-woods movie. About 77 minutes but could have been shortened by 10 minutes or so without impacting anything.  Just very ho-hum. There are so many movies like this, I'd say watch some of those instead but if you got nothing else...",1527811200,,257,4.976744186046512
8592613,1,B00DENJICG,"Just once I'd like to see a group of ""friends"" who actually get along and have fun together before the carnage begins.  I can understand them growing progressively ill-tempered as circumstances in the story put increasing pressure and fear upon them, but in this movie they're in as foul a mood as possible right out of the gate.  I've watched about a dozen of these horror films over the past month, and every single one has characters EXACTLY the same: sullen, bored & bitter, every word out of their mouths a complaint, an insult or an expletive.  The only time their mouths spew anything less than vitriol is to be passive-aggressive.  Do filmmakers make them like this so we'll hope they get killed?-- or is it so that we can relate to them and sympathise? (not sure I want to know the answer)  Whatever, it ratchets this thing up immediately to MAXIMUM BORING, not to mention establishing an (unintended) atmosphere so nasty it almost leaves a vile taste in your mouth.

The acting is barely adequate, perhaps a cut above acting by cousins, friends-owed-a-favor, and locals who put up a few bucks or let crew use their land in exchange for a part.  As far as dialog, it is literally nothing but snarking and double entendres (I wouldn't have believed it possible, but apparently the British are way more fixated on sex than even us Americans).  Whenever they're forced to say some lines to move the plot along, it stands out like a sore thumb: stilted, awkwardly phrased and totally unrealistic (with acting evocative of those cousins & locals).  Even after murders start happening, characters are unable to infuse any tension or believable fear into their actions.  They don't even seem all that upset; if anything, they appear more irritated and resentful that ""friends'"" deaths have forced them out of their comfort zone.  Editing runs the gamut from standard to very bad to WTF?  Gore effects brief and unoriginal.

I was going to give this film 2 stars because the production values are not bottom of the barrel, but it got demoted back to 1 due to sheer boringness, intolerable characters, repellent dialog, lack of any suspense, tension, or scariness, and COMPLETE absence of originality in any form.  Plus, the characters were killed much too quickly and humanely--I really REALLY wanted to see them suffer.",1524614400,,2321,4.843037974683544
8592614,1,B00DENJICG,"I'm one of the people who love B movies I love to laugh at the mistakes that are made, but this was beyond B and pushing a D. Really bad movie. I'm ashamed to say I watched the whole thing. Don't bother to watch.",1508630400,,212,3.840909090909091
8592615,1,B00DENJICG,"Yet another movie with a cast of nasty, obnoxious, thoroughly rude people who can't stop squabbling and calling each other names.  If this is the author's idea of how friends behave around each other I'd seriously hate to run into his or her enemies.  The gore part is ok, lots of splashing, but I don't think the sound the machete makes is accurate, nor as scary as the real sound would be.",1508371200,,391,4.416666666666667
8592616,2,B00DENJICG,I wish it had been 40 minutes longer to develop the characters. It felt rushed.,1506902400,,79,4.333333333333333
8592617,1,B00DENJICG,"this movie is a deep load of excrement. even by amazon standards this movies awful. the directing, the writing, the acting it is all disposable and it makes you wonder how much you're contributing to bad art by watching it. none of the jokes are funny, none of the characters are likeable, i don't even know why its supposed to be a horror movie because even the cheapes tropes they copied weren't executed correctly to make you feel any fright. don't waste your time on this one.",1506729600,,480,4.528735632183908
8592618,1,B00DENJICG,a total waste of time,1506729600,,21,3.4
8592619,1,B00DENJICG,"Extremely poorly filmed, nothing but constant shaky camera crap.  Some may try to call it a filming style and I suppose it is... Lazy style.  Extremely poorly edited;  I don't think there was a single scene that ran for more than about 3 seconds before it cut to another shaky camera angle.  Characters are extremely shallow and poorly developed.  The story started out OK until after the first couple of campers died and then the rest of them acted like complete idiots.  It left me hoping they would all die before the end because they where so extremely stupid.  It is hard to be scared when the only reason people are dying is because they are stupid and not even in a funny way at all.",1506643200,,690,4.428571428571429
