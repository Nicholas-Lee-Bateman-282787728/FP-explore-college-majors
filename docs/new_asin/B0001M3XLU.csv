For starters the Run DMC styles featured are still heavy hitters today with the signature black thick rimmed glasses coming back in style. For their time the signature leather suit and Addidas still reigns supreme and must have had impact then. I cant believe how cool their approach remains. At any rate, in reflecting on the videos they had a definite past era feel of the mid eighties but over all the imagery and subject matter of the videos was admirable, clownish and even warranted. I just cant ever let go of this great footage. Also carisma and sense of humor is well taken advantage of in the short film. Not much to say negative all though the Run DMC style is definitly raunchy intermittantly or arguably. Still though they will always have a rare cross over appeal as pioneer rap artists. Definitely sexy and clever. The only rival to them to me is Bob Marley and thats strictly on distinction and edge. Other then that the two are unrelatable.",1331337600,,1008,4.574585635359116
