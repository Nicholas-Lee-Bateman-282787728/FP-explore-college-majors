The transfers are horrible, with each movie being almost too dark to watch, and the sound too quiet or too muffled throughout to really hear much.  Well, that's not entirely true; the pops and hisses that run over each movie are crystal clear and loud.

Granted, I bought this solely for ""BMX Bandits,"" which already begs an evaluation of what I consider to be quality, but honestly this triple-feature is a dud all the way through.  Save up a couple more bucks and buy the legit copy of whichever of these films you're interested in.

Oh yeah, what in the world is going on with the commercial for some dude, Devon Scott Dicker, that precedes even the copyright warning?  That commercial is both easy to see and easy to hear, which makes me wonder even more why the quality of the movies is so horrendous.",1529366400,,857,4.532467532467533
