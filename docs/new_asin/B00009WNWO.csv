7993693,5,B00009WNWO,"One of my son's favorite movies that he asked Santa to bring this Christmas.  From the animae genre for young kids, the movie is pretty good.",1357084800,,141,4.423076923076923
7993694,2,B00009WNWO,"This movie is primarily about how a 6th grade girl is affected when her parents decide to divorce. So it's much more serious than Kiki's Delivery Service and Totoro. It's hard to find the subject entertaining, but the movie does have lighter moments as well, and it is well made.",1326844800,,279,4.6
7993695,4,B00009WNWO,"This fine story of a lonely girl illustrates the power pets have in giving us an outlet for feelings and helping come to terms with life problems.  Hiromi lives with her tutor and house-keeper, becuase her parents have no time for her or each other.  On one level this works as a commentary on Japanese, and other  societies', obsession with material and career success rather than human relationships.

The script seems to have real respect for all the characters -- the viewer comes to care about even the supporting cast.  The final message has a lot do with being honest, with yourself and those you care about, in facing up to your feelings.  If the ending is a bit too pat, it's forgiveable in a children's fantasy, but it's unfortunate that every child cannot stop their parents divorce merely by asking.  But this is a quibble in a sinecrely enchanting movie.

Junkers the schnauzer may or may not talk and magically grant wishes -- whether he really does so, or it happens only in the heroine's imagination, is really irrelevant.  But Junkers the movie surely has some magic for the viewer.",1101686400,6,1099,4.712041884816754
