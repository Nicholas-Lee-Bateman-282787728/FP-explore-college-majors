7855703,3,6303905536,"Very light weight, silly plot, typical of the silent era in England and America.  Although directed by Hitchcock, he had yet to find his distinctive style.  Perhaps the most Hitchcockian twist is the true identity of the villain.  Not a film I'd ever care to see again.",1463097600,,269,4.680851063829787
7855704,3,6303905536,"""Champagne"" is one of about a dozen silent films directed by Alfred Hitchcock at the beginning of his career, and as this film was produced in 1928 when silent films had matured and developed into a fine art, it rates quite highly as a silent film in general.  Most impressive, I found, were the photography and some innovative effects with the camera, as well as nice sets and good acting.  Unlike Hitchcock's more famous mystery suspense thrillers of later decades, ""Champagne"" is a fairly light-hearted story with an unexpected touch of good humour now and then (which Hitchcock often liked to employ in other films as well).  The story revolves around a spoilt and selfish daughter of a wealthy business tycoon who could use a lesson in learning how `the other half' lives, as well as testing her lover's true intentions:  does he want to marry her out of love or just for her money?  What will he do when the rich father looses his entire fortune on the stock market?  But did the father really loose everything as he claims?  And who is the mysterious stranger always hanging around the daughter, and what are his true motives?  A touch of Hitchcock suspense is noticeable in this story, and it is enhanced by attractive and at times lavish sets showing the high society lifestyle of the late 1920s.  Fortunately, the picture quality of this VHS is quite good throughout, but I was very disappointed in the music accompanying the film.  Unless my tape just happens to be a dud, be warned that some VHS tapes on this Timeless Video Inc. label have a poor sound/musical track, and some have no music at all.  In this case, ""Champagne"" is accompanied by a rather heavy classical music recording which is firstly not at all suited to the film and its atmosphere, and secondly it often wavers annoyingly in volume and sounds like a worn-out scratchy LP recording.  For this reason I'm only giving this VHS 3 stars, but if it had good, suitable music it would certainly deserve a full 4-star rating.  Nevertheless, this is a film not to be missed by any Hitchcock fans or anyone curious about his early, silent film career.",1149552000,3,2123,4.674731182795699
