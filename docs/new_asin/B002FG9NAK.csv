8369033,5,B002FG9NAK,"I watched this documentary on LinkTV and have decided that I just HAVE to get it for a musician (drummer/ retired ""percussionist/music director of the Air Force Cadet Marching Band) for a Christmas present. I KNOW he will greatly appreciate it and probably watch it over and over again. I am not a musician but I completely got into this fantastic journey where jazz artist Simon Barker travels to Korea to find an elusive Shaman/drummer. Along the way he learns about the culture of Korea and we learn about the beauty of life itself and the importance of tradition AND music to the culture of all peoples. It's a film to remember. It touched me deep within my soul and I'm so excited to find it on Amazon.

The documentary ""Intangible Asset No. 82"" is a fantastic thought provoking gift, not just for the musician or intellectual, but for anyone who's interested in music, culture, sociology, the importance of passing on cultural traditions, rituals, and spirituality. Oh, it's also a 'must see' for anyone interested in the Korean culture and Shamanism, but the Korean interest is not necessary. By the time you finish watching this, you WILL have an appreciation for ALL cultures and their talented/dedicated elders. You'll appreciate cultural traditions and realize what a huge yet subtle role music has always played in the expression of happiness to grief, to healing of the lives of the many peoples on this earth.",1386892800,,1423,4.880165289256198

8369035,4,B002FG9NAK,"This is a beautifully edited, musically inspired film that's not likely to get much press but it's hard to imagine someone disliking it.  The tale concerns drummer Simon Barker's search for the spirit (s) and skills apparent to him in the drumming of the late Kim Seok-Chul who Barker considers ""one of the great musicians of our age.""  In some respects it's a familiar story of a very talented but naive artist's search for the true grandmaster done in a narrative, documentary style but from the opening frame and beat it's clear this is a special story.  Given our age of verisimilitudes, corrosive subaltern recuperations, deep identity searches and all the problematics of ""post colonialism"" it's extraordinary how this movie approaches a genuine, ancient and unlost source in a completely uncluttered manner.  A great deal is unsaid in part because Barker was in way over his head and because Kim Seok-Chul was an indescribable master but mostly because the approach to a genuine origin (which the West can only glean in myth) is awe- and not word- inspiring.  This is movie about sounds that are not and never can be words and sounds that are not entirely human, as those who know insist is always the case where an origin is protected and preserved.  This movie offers a rare cultural experience for ""developed"" cultures and perhaps as close an experience to an ancient origin as ""developed"" cultures are likely to get.  Given the lack of respect usually tossed to anything Indigenous in the entertainment and scholarly industries of our day, this is as rare and beautiful a bridge as is likely to be equaled for a very long time.",1289174400,5,1638,4.849462365591398
