1469589,5,B00005JM0B,"I have read two of S. M. Stirling's novels based on the world created in the motion picture written by James Cameron and William Wisher, and I must say, Stirling... four thumbs up (if I got two more limbs I'd give you SIX!!!). I would say, Jon (Jonathan Mostow), you should hire Stirling to write T2 sequel because he's the only one that has got the idea whats T2 is alll about. I would come and watch T3 but I'm sure the message about humanity and all that stuff will probably go down the drain instead I'll be awed with the dazzling special effects and CGI stuffs that you'll find in Star Wars if not The Matrix. I had fallen in love with Serena I-950 that Stirling killed off at the end of T2 Infiltrator (sobs!), her sisters are nuthin' like her... at least more human and lady like than any other, maybe slightly better than Lara Croft, but you killed her at the end and left me... in tears. You know you should talk to McFarlaine to resurrect her into an action figure (I'd buy her!) at least open a fan website and named someone near to Kristanna Loken to play her role if Cameron/Spielberg decided to direct T4! As for now Serena I-950 may you rest in peace, hopefully we'll bump into one another in the near future and destroy the human race so that the earth will be safe from us human who had done nothing but destroy it. Beat that Mostow for that incredible idea from Mojo writer S. M. Stirling! I just hope this Terminatrix (rip off!) or T-X is actually Serena I-950 in disguise and ready to pop out from that energy whirlpool, naked and surprise me with, ""hey, you, I'm Serena I-950, I'm better than that Vanessa the Fembot rubbish!'",1042675200,3,1647,4.368078175895765
1469590,1,B00005JM0B,"At first I was very excited to hear about a new Terminator film, Silly me thinking that just as they had in the last film they would bring back the proper cast. Now I love Eddie Furlong, but I can't kid myself into thinking he is exactly essential to the film, though it would be a major plus for him to be in it. James Cameron and Linda Hamilton however are a big part of The Terminator legacy, to take a way them, well that alone could destroy the movie.
Yet it gets worse, at first I was shock and excited to her Michael Biehn was returning, after all if we can't have John's mother in this movie why not his father, but them i thought about it. Wait, we know through previous films that Sarah dies after the war starts; we also know that Kyle is born after the war starts as well. One would know that Kyle is born sometime at 1997 when the war starts, perhaps around the year 2000. John is technically about 16-20 years older then his father. So how could Kyle still played by Biehn return as the father of Nick Stahl, who's playing John in this chapter. Even if Biehn hadn't age a day since the first Terminator, he would still be too old to be John's father. There is no way to send him back in time again, because he died. Perhaps they are extremely creative, but I truly see no way to logically have Kyle fit in this movie.
But, Hey I could be wrong and this movie might blow me away, so maybe I'll be writing a new review when it comes out, but will the info available now this movie seems pretty sad.",1039219200,3,1510,4.139455782312925
1469591,3,B00005JM0B,"When it was announced that James Cameron would not direct TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES, fans and critics said ""Hasta La Vista"" to the film's success, both critically and commercially. Not having Cameron's visceral trademark M.O (Blow up everything) for the continuation of the series is criminal. But that's Hollywood for you. Now with Cameron only producing, Jonathan Mostow (Breakdown, U571) is set to helm this monster of a movie. With both star and budget problems and no Linda Hamilton, this could kill the franchise. Oh sure, it'll be impressive to see what it'll look like and Arnie's fans will no doubt get excited about the Austrian hulk's return to the series after a long string of action clunkers. New cast members include Kristanna Loken as the female terminator and Claire Danes. It's all speculation, but Cameron replaced by a shaky B-movie director, we can only hope that this will be a success that will terminate box office records and revive Schwarzenegger's career as one of the greatest action guys in movie history. And regardless of the film's problems, millions of hard-core fans are eagerly waiting for it's theatrical release in July 2 2003.",1037232000,3,1173,5.02051282051282

Arnold is again the good guy, outmatched and outgunned and overpowered by the newest model, the T-X, this time in the form of shapely lass Kristanna Loken.

1469818,3,B00005JM0B,"Nowhere near as good as the first two but it makes sense. I really enjoyed this sequel for two reasons, the part where she spawned naked on the street in Beverly Hills and the scene where Arnold Schwarzenegger enters the club on Ladies Night and fights the male stripper. It really demonstrates how much society had changed since 1991 by 2003 (when this movie came out).

1469822,4,B00005JM0B,"A female terminatrix returns from the future to take out John Connor who is now a young man and his future squadron (who are various every day people from fast food workers to vets). An older model terminator returns to save them. The terminator is still the same good terminator from movie 2.

Even though they brought the same pyschiatrist guy back from movie 1 and 2 with a half witted explanation (I mean he clearly witnesses the mayhem in movie 2 in a hallway) they did an excellent job of explaining what had happened to John and Sarah Connor from the last movie and why the machines are back even though in movie 2 John, Sarah, the computer programmer, and the good terminator destroyed the chips/computers/software that were to be used to build the AI/machines. The ending was great as it was very very unexpected but so in line with the story.

There is more corruption of a great tough guy thriller by American liberals in this movie--the female terminator is one, the gays guys in the opening scenes, the emasculated John Connor character with the horrible choice of an actor, the unrealistic fictional feminist Claire Dane character, etc.",1504396800,,1150,4.745

1469874,3,B00005JM0B,"The only real problem I had with this sequel was they gave John Conner NO BALLS and this was to be the big fight in the future against the machines aka the
beginning of Judgment Day. This made it very incomplete at the end instead of just leaving them in the bunker and should have been at least another 45 to 1hr longer. The franchise is so afraid to show the future war itself its really beginning to vex me. These last two Terminators are still making the battles about coming back to earth in time and it should strictly be about the showdown in the future AFTER the machines have officially taken over and the resistence is formed. I really haven't liked them since this one here..",1500422400,,686,4.3671875
1469875,3,B00005JM0B,"I don't recognize any of the Terminator ""sequels""...as far as I am concerned, it began and ended with the first film. The first film had a superb plot and the absolutely best portrayal of a ""cyborg"", indeed any robot, ever done on any medium. Whilst I don't like Schwarzenegger for a couple of reasons (""groper"" accusations and Zionist-controlled robot), he provides the most realistic robot ever on film...not because of poor acting skills mind you (its not easy as you think to portray a convincing machine).

The problem with Terminator 3 (and its predecessor T2) is mainly with plot...the first film had a ""time-displacement"" machine which was said to have been destroyed, as Mr Reece said, ""Nobody else goes through""! He was misinformed because time travel in this franchise is as common as airline travel is today...which destroys the credibility and fabric of the film.

Another problem is that the machines in T2 and T3 become too ""humanoid""...they are Intelligent mode thinkers and not mechanical thinkers as the terminators were in the first film...problem here is that you just end up with an unrealistic metal human.

With these two problems, you basically end up with a hackneyed plot tied up in a cash-cow chase movie like T3.

Whilst T2 has its many, many fans, I was not a fan of it. I value deeper themes and realistic plots rather than just mindless action, explosions and so forth. Never-the-less, I enjoyed these two films (T2 and T3) as standalone action distractions, but I purposely disconnect them from the 1984 classic.

The Terminator franchise should be terminated permanently now...its just gotten too convoluted plot wise.",1499644800,,1651,5.032967032967033
1469876,2,B00005JM0B,"Watchable, but nowhere near as good as the first 2. I watched this when it first came out and hadn't seen it since. I didn't really recall much about when I went to watch it again after all these years and know I remember why. Once Arnold Schwarzenegger said, Talk To The Hand, I pretty much gave up on it. I guess they were trying to recreate an updated, ""Hasta la vista, baby"", but that's when I knew it wasn't going to get better.",1499385600,,433,4.166666666666667

1469878,1,B00005JM0B,"Ever since this overhyped crapfest of a film premiered years ago, rotten tomatoes gave it restoundingly good reviews. To this day I can't understand why. First they rehash the basic plot of Terminator 2: teleport a liquid metal Terminator to the past and kill John Connor. Arnold Terminator is also teleported by the resistance to save him.

However, John is no longer a badass delinquent teenager that steals money from ATMs and rescues his mother from a psychiatric hospital.

He grows up to be a druggie loser that is caught stealing drugs from a veterinarian that seems to have more balls fighting the dumb blonde Terminator than him. Arnold is just sort of there saying really corny one liners, the fight scenes despite the more modern CGI technology weren't nearly as exciting as the 1992 film and probably the only worthy scene of the movie is the ending. If the movie had been slightly less atrocious, I would have appreciated it more because I really enjoyed the final scene.

There are far better SciFi action films out there, moving on!",1494633600,,1047,4.805555555555555

1470095,1,B00005JM0B,"The terminator is a scary monster from a nightmarish future. It's not supposed to be funny ( Arnolds terminator is naked onstage on ladies night), it's not supposed to look good ( Kristanna Loken as the lady terminator). The terminator is designed to wipe out the human race. Terminators fighting other terminators is silly. Terminators should fight humans, that's it.
It's tiring seeing Arnold as the good guy again when he's a much better villain. And in the same outfit. In T1 Arnold was fantastic as the villain and shocked the world with his evil, sadistic ways and brutality. Arnold dominated your attention and made you want more. ( Michael Biehn was amazing as the human that would do anything to stop the terminator, no matter what the cost. Linda Hamilton is good as the person trapped in the middle, trying to figure out if this was all for real. Even the cops are good- confused and overworked, trying to figure out what's going on.) Now. as in T2 he's the good robot that doesn't want to kill anyone, he only wants to help! He takes orders from humans like a weak willed slave.
In T2 Arnold is outflexed and outmuscled by Linda Hamilton. In T3 the female terminator gives him a savage, humiliating beating.
Cops and firefighters are too impressed with the terminators."" Gee you sure are big.."" They should be mad as hell that 2 perps are tearing apart their town. The only high point is the fiance. WIth his sly, cunning looks he would have made a much better terminator.
In T2 a couple screams in horror when the terminators metal hand is revealed. They screamed and screamed and couldn't stop screaming until their lungs gave out. They dropped to their knees and sobbed. They screamed, they cried, they pounded their heads into the ground. That's what i did when I saw how bad T2 and T3 were.

If you love underground bunkers then take 30 minutes and step your blu-Ray or DVD through the last 10 minutes of the movie and visually appreciate all of the nuances of the perfect 1970s bunker.  From the period authentic props to the custom designed furniture to all of the hidden backgrounds including a botany lab to the water filtration purification system.

There were a lot a cool action scenes, the Terminatrix is beautiful, and I enjoyed the interaction between John Connor and the Terminator.  I won't give it away, but there are definitely some pivotal plot scenes in this one, my favorite being how it shows John Connor being so tired of the future and how he deals with it.

It's like a third way for the inevitable Judgement Day to happen, with a grown up John Connor and his future wife whose father is the creator of SkyNet and some awesome, yet scary machines.

1470530,3,B00005JM0B,"I thought this movie was just a cash grab by the movie studios to make money.  There was no real reason for the movie.  T2 ended the movie almost perfectly why mess it up.  Well basically because Hollywood can and will screw something beautiful up, because the studio heads are out of original ideas and just want to run every decent movie that made money right into the ground.  Alien, Predator, Star Wars, Back to The Future.  Basically any movie that was a blockbuster and came out within the last 30 years.  I had very little hope for this movie, even before I saw it.  How many times do we need to see a Terminator sent back to the past.

But after seeing the movie I was pleasantly surprised.  I did not think it was near as good as the other 2 Terminator films but I did not think it was an abomination like Terminator Salvation later turned out to be.  I, like most viewers would have really liked Edward Furlong to reprise the role of John Conner.  He did such a good job in the second film it is a shame not to see him come back in the role.  But that aside I actually liked the fact that the film centered away from Sarah Conner and followed the lives of future hero's in the up coming war.  Seeing the new Terminator T-X target future human leaders besides just John Conner was smart and added some nice depth to the movie.  The female Terminator Kristanna Loken is very beautiful and plays the role very convincingly.  Lets face it, it would be near impossible to top the T1000 from the last movie the effects were so groundbreaking like nothing seen before.

I like how the movie shows a transition of how the military is upgrading all the weapons to one entity.  I wish the film would have spent even more time on that.  I would have loved to have seen the big futuristic hover machines and massive assault tanks from the first film being built by the humans and then suddenly turn on them.  The movie does have scenes similar to that effect, but on a much smaller scale probably for budgetary reasons.

It reminded me a lot of the movie WAR GAMES with Mathew Broderick.  Evidently the generals in the movie never watched that film or 2001 A Space Odyssey.  The point of all this is not to rely solely on technology to make the right choices for us.  Another good film to relate with T3 is I-Robot which came out a couple of years later.  Very similar premise and good overall story.

Back to the film itself T3 is pretty interesting, the acting is very good.  I thought Claire Danes and Nick Stahl did very well as Kate and John Conner.  I actually think the Kate Conner role was more interesting.  The ending of the film is excellent and really brings the movie full circle and whole.  As a film viewer I totally bought it and liked how the director played out the story.  T3 is by no means a bad film, there is just no real way it could have lived up to its predecessor.  That being said the film has a lot of good elements to it and is worth watching overall.  I would rate the film 3 1/2 stars.",1450224000,2,3014,4.289007092198582

1470721,4,B00005JM0B,"Its been sitting on my DVR for a while, but life has gotten busy, so I finally got a chance to sit down and watch Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines.  Im definitely beginning to feel the familiarity in the franchise, but it was still a fun movie.

We are once again set in the present (read 2003) as a young 20s John Connor (Nick Stahl) is doing his best to live his life off the grid, afraid of the future his mother has constantly told him about.  He stumbles into his past when he meets up with Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), someone he knew in Jr. High but lost touch with after taking off with his mom after the events of the last movie.

And just as the two of them meet up again, two Terminators are sent into the past.  In addition to the old model (Arnold Schwarzenegger), we also get a female terminator (Kristanna Loken) this time.  John immediately assumes hes the target that the machines have been sent into the past to kill him and begins to figure out a way to survive.  But are his assumptions correct?  Can anyone survive as we inch closer to the doomsday weve been expecting for so long?

Yes, they tried to shake things up with a female terminator this time, but lets be honest.  This is the third film in the franchise, and the premise is familiar.  There were a couple of interesting twists on the formula this time around, but they were small.  Big picture, if youve seen one of the first two Terminator films, you know what to expect here.

Not that the film doesnt deliver.  We get plenty of action throughout the entire film and some great suspense early on as the evil terminator does a bit of stalking.  Ironically enough, the special effects don't seem quite as elaborate as the second film, which was filmed a decade earlier.  Dont get me wrong, the effects are all great, but they aren't as breathtaking or creative.  Likewise, the acting is fine, especially from the leads.

What propels this film up a bit in my mind is the ending.  I wasn't expecting it, and how it was executed made it powerful.  It actually left me wondering what would happen next to the characters, so obviously Ive come to care about them more than I expected.

While Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is not classic cinema, it is still entertaining.  If you are looking for some action with a science fiction bent, youll enjoy it.",1439510400,2,2337,4.423887587822014

The story takes place ten years after the events of 1991's Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Sarah Connor, John's mother, is dead, and he has gone 'off the grid', trying to live as if judgement day will never happen. It soon becomes clear that their efforts in the second film have not stopped the creation of SkyNet artificial intelligence network, when Connor is once again targeted by a Terminator sent from the future by SkyNet. This new Terminator, T-X (Kristanna Loken) seems unstoppable. While trying to escape, John runs into an old acquaintance who, it turns out, is destined to help him. Although nothing can beat the first one, this addition to the franchise is still great.

1470926,4,B00005JM0B,"In this third installation of the Terminator franchise, we fast forward 9 years after the events of Terminator 2. John Connor now 19 years old is living off the grid and riding solo in the LA area, following the death of Sarah who died from acute myeloid leukemia sometime between the post events of Terminator 2 and the beginning of Terminator 3. Judgment Day was able to be postponed for its original date of August 29th, 1997, but John still believes that the war between humans and machines will happen.

With Skynet failing to kill off John in Terminator 2 and unable to track his whereabouts following T2, they once again send another Terminator machine back in time--this time a female. This time they send a new model, the T-X, back to July 24th, 2004 to kill all future members of the Resistance since they are unable to find John. Like the last one, the newer Terminator cyborg is more advanced than the previous 2.

After successfully and mercilessly slaughtering many targets around the downtown Los Angeles area, the T-X successfully locates John and his future wife, Kate Brewster at a local vet. Before the T-X can do any harm to Kate, a reprogrammed Terminator, now a T-850 model (sent back by the Resistance) arrives and saves the two. Together John and Kate escape with Terminator before the T-X revives.

Upon discovering that Judgment Day will take place that evening at approximately 6:18 PM, John and Kate have Terminator take them to Kate's father as Lt. General Robert Brewster who plays an vital role with Skynet and their launch of Judgment Day. With the end of the world just hours away, the trio of Terminator, John Connor, and Kate Brewster work together to triumph over the dangerous and technologically superior, T-X in addition to preventing Judgment Day from taking place

Overall: I have mixed feelings when it pertains to Terminator 3. I like it but then there are things I don't like it. I see Terminator 3 as the beginning of the downfall of the series. The main reason for that being the comedy overtones they added into the movie. In Terminator 2 we got maybe one or two comical moments but it seems as if the they felt the need to make Terminator 3  half comedy/half action until last 30 or 40 minutes of the film. Now granted, some of the comical scenes in the movie are funny, it just seems they stray away too much from keeping true to the genre and try to mix it up with humor elements. It needs to be said that Terminator 3 lacks what the first 2 Terminator films had a lot of; action. Terminator 3 has maybe a high speed car chase ending with a crash here and an explosive there but it was more story-telling than equal parts of both, although I will admit the script did nice at forming the bond with Kate and John. John and Terminator's bond with each other was different than the previous film with Terminator being less of a friend and more of a determined guardian to make John understand his destiny. The performances were appealing to say the least. Arnold was still the man and showed no signs of rust, reprising his role as Terminator for the first time in 12 years when this came out. Nick Stahl's role as John Connor was stellar and did a fine job at playing the loner in distress who almost gives up on himself and humanity. Claire Danes was awesome as the cutie but fierce Kate Brewster and Kristanna Loken dominated as the creepy, cold, but oh so very sexy T-X. Rumor has it, former WWE diva Chyna was originally considered for the role of the T-X. Now I'm a fan of wrestling and Chyna but I'm glad they chose Kristanna instead. The woman was hot in her role--especially in her first scene when she's first transported to the present. Overall, Terminator 3 was still a fairly good film. The overuse of comedy and lack of true action robs it of a 5th star and unfortunately the series went down after this as 6 years after this we got that abomination that is Terminator Salvation that disgraced the entire Terminator franchise. It's a true pleaser if you really love the Terminator series and can forgive the few flaws it has",1435708800,,4085,4.559945504087193

1471182,3,B00005JM0B,"A continuation of the Terminator franchise, and an excuse to keep the series going despite all of the stops they had pulled plot wise to prevent ""Skynet"" from initiating ""Judgement Day"" previously in T-2.

 T-3 we have set in the modern day where John Conner is a bit older, and his soon to be girlfriend is a post college aged young adult.  Some how despite everything Arnold and Sara Conner did in the previous film to prevent ""Judgement Day"", another new and this time ""woman"" Terminator warps back to the present on a new mission to kill John Conner.

 Conner finds and reactivates a new T-800 series, providing it with the programing as he did previously to protect John Conner and act as a ""good guy"" Terminator traveling back to the present to inform Conner that all he did was postpone ""Judgement Day"" and that the nuclear war was going to happen with in days because ""Skynet"" was to come online with it's first early prototypes built in conjunction with the US Air Force.

 This new ""lady"" Terminator is pitted against Arnold in duel that takes them from the streets of LA to Cheyenne Mountain with NORAD.

Why this one isn't as good; I did not like the change in actors, nor did I really buy the excuse of the plot claiming ""Judgement Day"" would occur no matter what the characters did.  This new Terminator is a menace with great special effects but she did not move me or convince me enough as the Liquid Terminator 2000 from T-2.

 What is good about this film besides the fun of seeing Arnold ""come back"" for more action? I did like seeing these other more primative Terminator models duke it out with Arnold and the heroes, and I did like seeing how ""Skynet"" origins became so in detail.  We also have a deleted scene where Arnold's image had been taken from a US Air Force Sergeant whose image and body frame had been used as a model prototype for the future T-800 model series that Arnold is among.",1422835200,,1915,4.502890173410405

Interesting idea that the machines sent back one of their own to start the war but it got silly when she could take over any other machine- no matter how uncomputerized it was (Terminator prototypes yes, simple cop cars- no).

Comparing specs directly, I can say that this one, while it DOES have a definied plot, as well as a sequence that makes sense (somewhat), it still just does not have the wonder and substance of its predecessors.

Furthermore, I agree that it teaches the lesson that, no matter what you do in an attempt to stop something as big as an advanced system of artificial intelligence, you will only end up delaying it at best. Not that it would be impossible to stop something like Skynet, but in this respect, it proves the saying - once you chop the beast's head off, another one grows in its place.

However, I cannot help but feel as though many of the events and scenes in this movie were predictable if anything. You just have the sense that you know whatis eventually going to happen. I also have to lay down the gavel on the fact that there was the obvious jab at sex appeal - the beginning scene with the T-850 entering the club to obtain clothes, plus the portrayal of the T-X by Kristanna Loken.

As alright of a movie as this is, one can tell that this film was made primarily for financial gain, especially since this was the first Terminator film not directed by James Cameron. It just does not match up to the greatness of T1 and T2, as I see it.",1415318400,,1399,4.3320610687022905

A decade has passed since John Connor [Nick Stahl] helped prevent Judgment Day and save mankind from mass destruction. Now 25, John Connor lives ""off the grid,"" no home, no credit cards, no cell phone and no job. No record of his existence. No way can he be traced by Skynet - the highly developed network of machines that once tried to kill him and wage war on humanity. Until, out of the shadows of the future steps the T-X [Kristanna Loken], Skynet's most sophisticated cyborg killing machine yet. Sent back through time to complete the job left unfinished by her predecessor, the T-1000, this machine is as relentless as her human guise is beautiful. Now John Connor's only hope for survival is the Terminator [Arnold Schwarzenegger], his mysterious former assassin and together they must triumph over the technologically superior T-X and forestall the looming threat of Judgment Day or face the apocalypse and the fall of civilisation as we know it.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: In Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, just as in ''T2'' a dozen years ago, the original T-1 killer cyborg from the future, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, does battle on the streets of Los Angeles with an updated, sleeker, deadlier model. Last time, you may recall, it was the T-1000, played with metallic sangfroid by Robert Patrick. Now, in an apparent concession to the turbo-feminist lad-mag action-movie times, the state-of-the-art killer cyborg from the future is the T-X, who touches down on Rodeo Drive in the arresting and unclothed form of Kristanna Loken, and who goes about her subsequent business in a red leather pantsuit and a silver Lexus coupe.

The film is not weighted down by plot, but it does have a recognisable storyline featuring legitimate characters and a few nice, but minor twists. Some degree of attention is helpful and Terminator 3 is not an intellectual challenge, but neither is it vacuous. The film has plenty of action sequences, some of which are spectacular. Director Jonathan Mostow has wisely not relied too much on computer graphics for these. A fair amount of stunt work was required, and the computer components are incorporated seamlessly. Additionally, Mostow does not play the game of cutting every second or so, and the music never upstages the visuals. Terminator 3 gets the most bangs for its buck by letting the camera linger on the spectacle, and allowing tension, not flashiness, to be its hallmark.

The old-model Terminator, delivering his usual one-liners with abandonment, in that familiar Austro-Californian monotone, has his hands full with this limber, ruthless new machine, which has been sent back in time, as Arnold Schwarzenegger was in the first Terminator film, to kill off the future leaders of human resistance to machine tyranny. The first instalment in the franchise, directed by James Cameron and starring Linda Hamilton along with Arnold Schwarzenegger, which is nearly 20 years old. The rapid evolution of special-effects technology since then, and the concurrent spread of multi-sequel blockbuster franchises, gives those influential pictures a decidedly antique aura.

In part because of the example of Terminator 2, which was a pioneer in the use of computer-animated imagery in a live-action setting; sci-fi action movies have become ever more visually elaborate and also more pretentious. Next to the baroque postmodern pseudo-sophistication of the ''Matrix'' films, which similarly explore the fate of humanity under threat of machine dominance, the new ''Terminator'' has a lumbering, literal-minded old-style feel. Which is not, on balance, such a bad thing? Mr. Cameron has long since ascended from action auteur to king of the world, leaving his duelling robots and their human prey in the hands of Jonathan Mostow. Jonathan Mostow's previous film was U-571, a highly competent exercise in that squarest of all action subgenres, the submarine movie. And if he lacks James Cameron's unusual gift for finding human drama amid all the explosions, chases and collisions, Jonathan Mostow does at least film the explosions, chases and collisions with professionalism and something like wit.

Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, despite seemingly preventing Judgement Day, as seen in the events in the film Terminator 2: Judgment Day, and this time an adult John Connor [Nick Stahl] does not believe that the war has truly been averted. He chooses to live 'off-the-grid' in Los Angeles, with no permanent home or job in order to prevent anyone from tracking him. He fears prove to be warranted when Skynet sends a new model of Terminator, the T-X [Kristanna Loken], back through time in an attempt to kill as many of the future human resistance's lieutenants as possible, thereby tipping the balance of the war in its favour. The T-X is an advanced hybrid of the T-800 and T-1000 models and has been designed with an arsenal of powerful weaponry and the ability to remotely control machines with the use of 'nano-transjectors'.

While searching for medicine after a motorcycle accident, John Connor has a chance encounter with Katherine Brewster, an old school friend who, unbeknownst to them both, will go on to become John's wife and second-in-command of the resistance. When the T-X arrives to terminate Kate, it quickly discovers John's presence and begins interrogating her for information, but as before the future resistance is able to send a reprogrammed Terminator [Arnold Schwarzenegger] back through time to protect John Connor and Brewster. Arriving just in time to save them from the T-X, this new Terminator has one mission: to ensure the survival of John Connor and Katherine Brewster so that they may fulfil their destinies.

With the ending of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, does this means it means a set-up for Terminator 4, and allows parts of the story have yet to be told. But, from an action standpoint, is there any way that the fourth picture could be anything other than a re-hash of its predecessors? And can the franchise succeed without its star, who, barring a failure to gain political office, will not be interested? Those are questions for the future. However, considering how well Terminator 3 is likely to fare at the box office, the future won't be that far away. It has taken a long time to get Terminator 3 to the screen, and, while the production doesn't rock the action motion picture industry to its foundation, it's a credible and entertaining movie, and was worth the wait.

This Terminator professes not to recall ever having said ''hasta la vista, baby,'' but he does let fly with gems like ''I'm back,'' ''She'll be back,'' and ''My database does not encompass the dynamics of human pair-bonding.'' He also says, ''You're terminated'' to his robot rival, perhaps testing out a slogan intended for the next sequel, which is now out in the cinema and eventually released on a 3D Blu-ray disc.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Sony delivers Terminator 3 with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio, with a stunning encoded 1080p image transfer that looks pretty good for the most part. Obviously this is the newest of the Schwarzenegger Terminator films, so one would expect it to look significantly better than the older films, and it's fair to say that it does. The first thing that struck me was how clean the image is, with hardly any blemish to be seen anywhere on the print. It's also fairly detailed, although it's not the sort of razor sharp clarity found on the very best releases (but this seems to be due to the way Terminator 3 was filmed). I don't have the intimate knowledge of the film required to be certain that colour rendition is completely faithful to the source material, but if the DVD release is a reliable indicator it looks to be reasonably accurate if a little unnatural (skin tones are a good indicator of this as they occasionally have an 'artificial quality' to them). Blacks are deep and stable though. All things considered it appears to be a solid representation of the original material even if it's not 'reference quality', so fans should be happy.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  As is customary for their Blu-ray releases, Sony provides a 5.1 TrueHD soundtrack that offers plenty of aural thrills and spills. Right from the get-go all five channels are utilised to deliver an engaging experience, from the future war sequence and the fast-paced T-X pursuit, to the cemetery shoot-out and 'rise' of the machines at the C.R.S. base. The cemetery and C.R.S. scenes in particular stick in my mind for the copious amount of bullets that fly around the soundstage, accompanied by some nice, deep bass, especially when the T-1s fire their mini-guns. Actually bass is probably worth singling out, because it's incredibly powerful throughout. It's not just the obvious explosions that benefit though, as even less obvious things like the T-X's flame-thrower pack a fair amount of low-end punch. Subtle elements aren't forgotten either, and there are times when the atmospheric sounds do a wonderful job of convincing you that you're along for the ride. On the negative side I did find the dialogue a little indistinct at times, particularly during the louder moments. The aggressive use of the surround channels was occasionally overwhelming as well, and Marco Beltrami's score could also have done with a slightly stronger presence in the mix, although that's really a personal thing. Even so, this is still a very impressive soundtrack that could easily serve as a demo title for those wanting to show off their surround set-up.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras: The disc actually contains a reasonably generous helping of bonus material, featuring most of the previously available DVD features and some brand new high definition content. Some of the features from the two-disc release are missing, which is a shame, especially considering less than thirty-five gigabytes of space is used on the disc.

Audio Commentary: Commentary by Director Jonathan Mostow, actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, actor Nick Stahl, actress Claire Danes and actress Kristanna Loken: This is the same commentary track that appeared on the DVD releases. Each participant was recorded separately and their comments edited together later, so it doesn't have the sort of flow you get with most group commentaries, but it's actually still pretty informative. Arnold comes across as someone who's just a little bit too obsessed with his own body (and Loken's for that matter). It borders on creepy at times.

Special Feature: Storyboards [1080p] [4:00] You get a montage of the film's climatic Terminator vs. Terminator duel scene, and the entire sequence is shown as a side-by-side comparison between the storyboards and the final finished film, complete with soundtrack. This is actually a split screen feature that shows the Crystal Peak storyboards alongside the completed footage. I guess this could be quite interesting if you're into the whole 'how did the scene evolve' thing.

Special Feature: TV Special: HBO First Look [2003] [24:00] This is a pretty standard documentary that covers all of the promotional bases without providing any real insight into the production. It was obviously designed to drum up interest prior to the launch of the film, so it focusses on the action and the new 'Terminatrix' (I'm sure that should be 'Terminatress). The cast pop up to tell us how great the film is going to be, but that's about as deep as it gets.

Special Feature: Deleted Scenes and Blooper Reel [3:01] Yes, it's the usual sight of actors fluffing their lines and things going wrong. None of the gaffs are particularly very funny though.

Special Feature: TerminatorVision: Picture-in-Picture Experience [1080p] This is the disc's BonusView feature, which provides additional commentary from director Jonathan Mostow, as well as producers Mario Kassar and Andrew Vajna, who have recorded new introductions and full-length interviews, and a window video footage pertinent to the on-screen events. So far BonusView features have left me somewhat underwhelmed, but this one is actually reasonably interesting, even if there is a fair amount of space between the video segments. Jonathan Mostow dominates the track, so much so that you could be forgiven for thinking that it's a solo effort, but the video segments show some interesting footage and is well worth watching.

Special Feature: Dressed to Kill [1080p] [3:00] This is a very short look at the various attire worn by the characters, with the focus on the T-850 and the T-X. It's way too short to be of any real interest.

Special Feature: Toys in Action [1080] [8:00] In this documentary, Todd McFarlane talks us through the process of creating Terminator toys. While I found the artist work fairly interesting, I did get a bit tired with Todd McFarlane himself. He is way too enthusiastic about plastic dolls.

Special Feature: Sgt. Candy Deleted Scene [1080] [3:00] This is a total oddity, as this is the much-talked about Sgt. Candy scene, which features Arnie playing a character that would be the physical basis for the Terminators. It's a fun scene to watch in isolation, but I can see why it was lifted from the film.

Special Feature: Making of the Video Game [1080p] [8:57] This promotional documentary for the making of the first T3 makes it look a hell of a lot better than reviews suggest. True to form everyone goes on about how great it will be, with even the late, great Stan Winston professing his love for it. Oh dear.

Theatrical Trailers: The disc includes trailers for Terminator: Salvation and The Da Vinci Code, along with the usual Blu-ray showcases.

Finally, try as I might, I just can't view Terminator 3 as a valid extension of the Terminator franchise, because there is something missing, which I cannot put my finger on. I did get some enjoyment, if I watch it for the pyrotechnics and robots beating each other up, rather than as a serious science fiction picture, but it's too dumb to be taken as a proper continuation of Jim Cameron's films. I don't think this Blu-ray is going to do anything to change the minds of people who dislike the film and me included, but at least it's technically competent with solid video, great audio and a fair helping of bonus material. If you are a fan of Terminator 3, then this should definitely be on your 'must buy' list and so glad I have this in my Blu-ray Collection with the other Terminator films, making it an amazing collection that I love to watch when I am in the mood, as there is so much action in these genre films, you never get bored and you always see something new with each viewing and again I am so glad I now have nearly all of the brilliant Arnold Schwarzenegger franchise films in my Blu-ray Collection, but of course there is more to follow. Highly Recommended!

But this movie is a bit weird. They come from a liquid metal terminator to a liquid metal overlayed terminator so they could cart guns back in time. Like the present day ones weren't good enough.

Telling.

In any case. The story, was good. but a certain bit of hopelessness and a lack of general empathy replaces the self preservational aspects of the terminators. It just made no real sense, making the story seem like it lacked substance - and making it 'feel' like the story was concocted NOT to engage the viewer but instead to teach the viewer a lesson about inevitability and predestination.

Like I said. Good. but not great. I'd recommend, because it's a good overall blend of computer generated animation and effects with great characters. And a little more backgrounder to the start of the Terminator wars.

but NOT great because it lacked substance and seemed to portray a message of 'accept your fate and get over it'.

1471600,3,B00005JM0B,"Okay, I admit, this movie is a bit of a turkey (at least compared to 1 & 2--which were off-the-chain AWESOME!!!) but, the original trilogy needed to close so the new level of post-Judgement Day movies could begin.  That being said, my only real beef with this movie was that the kid John Conner in T2 seemed to have a bigger pair than Nick Stahl (I think I spelled that wrong--but who cares?) The point, they could have made him a tad more hardened---it couldn't have hurt the movie any more & it might have actually improved it--but I digress...
 This show WAS needed to tie-up loose ends, but it could've been better.  I did purchase the DVD version to complete my T-collection and the price was right.  I thoroughly enjoyed the free watch on Amazon instant video that came with my purchase,
 But, I gave this flick a 3-star because it wasn't quite as good as 1 & 2 which straight-up 5-stars and 3 deserved a 3-star and Salvation would be 4 1/2 stars due to it's epic story premise where the whole resistance/Terminator fight comes full-circle where man & machine must put everything on the line... that is the story.

1471670,4,B00005JM0B,"Terminator 3 is a movie that revels in the sheer power of steel, metal, and iron. The action scenes (and the movie is almost one continuous action scene) are like a symphony of metal pounding on metal. The two combatants are advanced killing machines from the future. The T-X's mission is to kill John Connor; the Terminator's to protect him. In carrying out these missions, they pound one another through walls, cars, helicopters, and even toilets. The T-X pursues John Connor in a crane truck, the truck's wrecking ball smashing dozens of cars. The Terminator shoots rocket propelled grenades into the T-X, the grenades blasting her down an elevator shaft. And the sound effects amplify every explosion and clash so that you feel enmeshed in a world of steel.

Perhaps all that sounds like a giddy fanboy's reaction to an action movie. And perhaps that's fair. There's much to criticize here. The human characters are unbelievable. Nicholas Stahl as John Connor doesn't seem like the inspiring hero he will become. Claire Danes as Kate Brewster comes off silly and shy when she should be tough and grimacing. Moreover, the Terminator's one-liners are, well, corny. But this movie is like a heavy metal concert; the lyrics don't really matter.",1398902400,,1244,4.980769230769231

And when they end up in the fallout shelter, and realize what they realize - great, as it helps us make sense of the question marks we get at the end of T2. Yes this ending sort of makes much more sense now. Interesting how the recent Captain America 2 movie kind of re-creates this (although somehow I don't think it's a tribute).

The bonus features are excellent - we get a cool little gag reel (2:40), a T3 Visual effects lab that has an intro, then goes through mini-documentaries of how they did the crane street chase scene (7:45), TX transformation (8:00), future war effects (8:30), and Crystal Peak FX scenes (9:20). There's a silly ""create your own visual effect"" game, then something about CRS Lab (10:00) that goes through a lot of stuff like the bathroom battle, decapitation, melting TX, and other hardware - someone points out that the T1 was the first REAL robot used in the Terminator series, ha ha. There's a ""Skynet database"" with a fact file of the five heroes, and the five terminators. ""Terminator timeline"" has info of the main years n the timeline, as laid out by the movies themselves, and then info on storyboards (3:50). ""Dressed To Kill"" talks about wardrobe stuff (2:00), and how the terminator has to be introduced in the right way. In ""Toys In Action"", a lispy Todd McFarlane talks about how the models were lovingly created. In ""The Making Of The Videogame"" (9:00) we see how they filmed Arnold in a little vignette of the original Marine who was the prototype of the T-800, an Austrian jarhead trying to talk in a California accent, or something ""Two bulldozers going at it. Just brutal force.""",1396742400,,2222,4.816753926701571

Yes, it kind of makes a mockery of the central tenet of the second film, but I think that fits with the course of history - humans can do there best to overcome forces larger than them, but in the end, there is only so much one person can do.

1471971,2,B00005JM0B,"I was impressed (and terrified) by the first Terminator. It was a groundbreaking movie that taught us a very powerful lesson... don't give robots and computer networks autonomy. It was well scripted and acted, with some now famous lines.

T2 picked up pretty well from there and introduced a more advanced robotic threat (that physically makes no sense, liquid metal?) but showed very interesting special effects. What saved that film for me was the juxtaposition of Arnold's T1 character from executioner to bodyguard and savior. It is interesting to take the villain from one movie and make him a hero in the next. When he died, I felt sad.

But along comes T3 and I have to say: HUH?

We have a new robot, a girl terminatrix, who is a cute, perky blonde with the worst attitude imaginable. Why is she wearing stiletto heels? Wouldn't a killer robot go for running shoes? At least she's wearing a pants suit and not a granny dress -- though that would have been hysterical!

At first she's seems to be another T2 liquid metal machine, but it turns out, she's even more, and more illogical than is fair to ask us to believe because she doesn't use her machine powers the way a machine would -- and that is efficiently!

Okay, so first she has these hand guns (really, her hand becomes a machine gun and don't ask me where she's keeping the bullets) to shoot anyone, including the T1. Only the T1 is sort of immune to bullets (this has been well established in the first two movies) So why bother with the dang gun that won't do anything when fighting him -- and why does he incessantly shoot back. Oh, these must be WINDOWS machines! (sorry, Microsoft). Okay seriously, they do it because they think the audience likes to see guns firing and gets a thrill out of things shooting other things with absolutely no results except to innocent bystanders, who get splattered all over the place!

Well, the gun jams or something, so the terminatrix (who is beginning to make me remember dumb blonde jokes) goes for the next super weapon, a flame thrower! At this point I am having flash backs to computer shoot-em-ups where the player can pick from an arsenal of weapons... real original concept there. I guess she wants to burn off Arnold's flesh - which works as a gross out device in the movie, but makes no sense in dealing with a titanium (or even stronger) machine!

Why doesn't she have a welding torch as a weapon? She could WELD Arnold to a fence or something like that (ow, that would hurt). Or what about the old tried-and-true spinning saw-blades-of-death? That's been around since the 1920's and even an episode of Doctor Who went with those!

Why does she need weapons, or pants suits or any of this stuff when with a little help from the script writers, she could have used the greatest weapon of all -- a BRAIN! Let's think here...

She has a mission - to kill a bunch of people, including John Connor. She has the remarkable ability to remote control other machines through networking and nanobots but doesn't use that ability to kill her victims in their own homes -- with their own devices! Aren't machines supposed to be efficient? A self propelled killer vacuum cleaner can be pretty scary.

Yeah it may seem strange, but it could have made a terrifying movie. People being stalked by remote controlled killer appliances! And she could have been the mastermind of it all, sitting in a office tower watching on her laptop through security cams, as victim after victim screams and dies a tortuous death while she laughs at their suffering. Okay I think we have had some movies like this before, but with a perky blonde robot-from-the-future as the villain? I think NOT. Now THAT would have been a villain! But then we'd miss out on all those impossible-to-believe car chase and destruction scenes.

There is a pretty well documented branch of science called physics. The filmmakers seemed to have thrown that out the window. When the terminatrix is driving the HUGE yellow crane truck at what seems like 60 MPH no less (yeah these things can sustain that speed for a long time) she swings the arm/boom sideways to wipe out all sorts of stuff (including annoying traffic lights) and the truck doesn't even lurch with the shift in weight! Oh, and it doesn't break down! Uh, most of the stuff we make today does break down if we slam it into a building, it really does.

Okay, the whole scene is for the chase, not logic but come on, give me something I can believe! Let's at least give a passing nod to reality!

I also missed the part explaining why the terminatrix took so long to overtake the T1's inferior CPU. I mean, she got police cars to drive by themselves in no time -- even where there is no actual mechanical way to remote control the steering or gas pedal -- no motors on those things-- right? Or is it the nanobots doing it all, and HOW is she able to control them so well when she is kind of busy driving that crane truck at 60 mph with the boom being sideways and Arnold stuck to the end of it? Come on guys, a little common sense here, please? I know these future machines are ultra-sophisticated, but I don't think even Superman has that level of concentration or multitasking ability!

What was good about the film was of course seeing Arnold again. But he didn't have too many 'Arnold moments'. It seemed like they couldn't figure out what to do with him and relied on what we knew from the first two films. There IS an interesting reveal when the T1 explains who sent him back this time and why. It would have been far more moving if the script writers had made John Connor and the T1 develop a much stronger bond, as they had in T2. I would have liked to see a development along those lines. They had the time to do it, but they missed it. And finally, the ending has a sort of unexpected twist, I'll grant it that, but before we get there we have to watch T1 and T3 in a truly brutal ""duke it out"" in a bathroom.

Unfortunately most of the film focuses too much on explosion after explosion (is the fireworks industry funding Hollywood these days?) and relentless destruction with some gruesomeness (Arnold cutting himself up to get to different machine parts, for example).

Summary

This movie missed the boat.

It could have been so much more, and really moving and clever.

Well, it moves alright, from one explosion to the next, one useless spray of bullets to the next. Here's the problem. After a while this stuff is just annoying!

As it is, watch the movie for the explosions and the vast destruction of property (if you like that sort of thing). Wait a long time for the two or three very brief shining moments in the film. Get the surprise ending and say, ""Ooh, I get it!"".

Then sigh and go do something else.

Whatever you do, don't try to fit logic into it. It has so little, it is a shame.",1373241600,2,6838,4.506462035541196

That being said, I found T3: RotM entertaining and thrilling when taken on its own. I thought Nick Stahl was great as John Connor accepting his destiny and liked Claire Danes as Kate. I especially appreciated where the film ends  favoring inevitability over Cameron's hopeful message. What a bold step! The female Terminator is not as innovative as Robert Patrick's character, but manages to remain a good threat to the leads. And Arnold  while botoxed to the gills  is always fun to watch.

The picture quality in this bluray copy is standard at best not that impressive and the audio quality is just has bad has the dvd quality or worse so in my opinion not worth the money.

Yes, the franchise has reached a crossroads, and this film is indicative of the lack of new ideas from the creators. But............I think that this movie works and is appealing because the Terminator movies have historically been few and far between, so the viewer is yearning for a new film every 7-8 years. The anticipation is there, and while a lot of stuff is carryover from previous films, we nonetheless don't mind. Arnold is again in top form for this one, and the one-liners are there as usual. The decision to go with a female terminator was different and welcome. I found this film to be enjoyable in plot, acting, and special effects.

1472298,3,B00005JM0B,"Terminator 3 is a sci-fi movie that continues the story of the beginning of the war between man and machine. Ultimately, the theme of the whole saga is the struggle of man against a seemingly insurmountable opponent. Terminator 3 is the act of the saga where the battle takes a dark turn for mankind. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Nick Stahl, Claire Danes, and Kristanna Loken.

In Terminator 3, an adult John Conner (Stahl) is living ""off of the grid"" as he grew up fearing a future he hoped he had prevented. However, a T-X model terminator (Loken) arrives from the future to wipe out the future resistance leaders and ensure that SkyNet goes online. The T-X is pursued through time by a T-850 (Schwarzeneggar) sent to protect Conner. Along the way, they rescue Kate Brewster (Danes) from the T-X. The judgment day that Conner once thought he helped stopped was only postponed, and it is a race to stop the machines from declaring war on humanity.

On the whole, Terminator 3 is a decent movie when taken on its own. However, it does not hold up well when compared to The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The weakest part of this movie is the believably of Stahl as John Conner. Part of this could be due to Conner being written as a weak character that needs to go through this story to become the leader he is meant to be, but Stahl's portrayal just doesn't make it believable that he is the same John Conner portrayed by Edward Furlong in Terminator 2 or Christian Bale in Terminator: Salvation.

Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is rated R for strong sci-fi violence and action, and for language and brief nudity. This is definitely not a movie for the kids. For fans of The Terminator, this is the weakest movie of the series, but it is still a vital part of the story of John Conner.",1353888000,,1837,4.5606060606060606

1472300,4,B00005JM0B,"Terminator 3-Rise of the Machines(released July/03)stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as The Terminator,Nick Stahl as John Connor,Claire Danes as Kate Brewster,Kristanna Loken as T-X,David Andrews as Lieutenant General,and others. It is a rather ambitious film that has alot to tell,which is its main drawback. The first two by Cameron kept it simple and straightforward,which were its virtues. However,this one features the best S/FX of any of the Terminators,and as such reaches a level on a par with the first.
The story finds John Connor 10 years later from the last,a loner and continually on the move. His mother has died,thinking they had averted a global conflict with the machines. However,this is a Terminator movie and that is not to be. This time Ah-nold ""beams"" back into 2004 ,as does another advanced T-X model with enhanced capabilities. To add to that,it is female in form. She has been sent back not only to terminate John but his closest lieutenants and she sets about doing just that with the usual terminator proficiency. Ah-nold coincidentally finds John caged in a vet hospital by one of its employees Kate,who it turns out knows John and will become his closest associate in the future,not to mention his wife. At the same time the T-X has also arrived and is terrorizing the pair. John and Kate who,with Ah-nolds assistance,manage to escape.
They head to a memorial park where Sarahs body is supposedly interred. Ah-nold smashes the wall and pulls out the casket,inside of which is filled to the brim with weaponry,to which Ah-nold helps himself. It seems the USAF took over the Cyberdine systems research and now has the Skynet system up and running. Unbeknownst to the trio however,all satellite systems are starting to shut down. And the USAF are at a loss to explain the virus which seems to have invaded their computer systems and others around the world. The so called virus,is the Skynet system's own plant so the USAF would have to eventually let it take over control of every system in order to ""repair"" it. The USAF thinks it can control it,but Skynet has become too self aware by now and when Skynet is finally given control,it institutes the war of the machines against mankind by launching preemptive nuclear strikes around the world.
The trio come to the conclusion they must stop the Skynet system at all costs. At that they are ultimately unsuccessful,but they are directed to an underground facility north of the central one. There it is hoped that they will be able to stop Skynet once and for all. John and Kate fly a Cessna to the location and while attempting to gain access they witness the arrival of the T-X.Ah-nold arrives shortly thereafter and holds off the T-X until the pair can reach the underground facility. It turns out what they thought was their salvation and access to stopping Skynet was no such thing. They were sent to an underground location designed to protect officials from nuclear fallout;a survival bunker. They can do nothing but sit back and wait. After a while they start to receive radio messages from civil defense authorities across the country,and they realize there is now hope of humanity rising back up and fighting the machines.
It is an ambitious films with alot of nice moments such as the massive crane chase through the L.A.streets, with Ah-nold dangling on the end of it. There are funny moments such as when near the end the T-X arrives at the underground shelter ahead of Ah-nold in a  normal sized chopper. Then shortly after Ah-nold arrives,but his is the size of a Sikorsky. There are two or three times when Ah-nold tries to come out with some snappy comebacks,as from the last movies,which are now iconic sayings. Ah-nold says""Talk to the hand"" and""She'll be baaack"",referring to the T-X.None of them have the same memorable punch as the others did in the first two movies,and have been quickly forgotten. The film has much too much detail to tell and should have been kept on a straightforward line like the previous two;so it lost a little bit of ground there with my ratings. However what really gives this movies its' chutzpah,are the improved S/FX,far superior than the first two. It would be neat to see what they could do today with Ah-nold in a new Terminator film.
Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1. Extras abound in this two disc collection. There is commentary by all the main stars,a gag reel,featurettes on every aspect of the films making,both major and minor,right down to the video game and figurine off shoots.
All in all a nice return to the Terminator franchise. Ah-nold is on game,but the film just gets a little too busy and even Ah-nolds comeback lines don't pack the same punch as before. However the incredible improvement in technology helps hide alot of the films flaws. 4 solid stars.",1353456000,,4837,4.8559322033898304

I would give 2.75 /5.0. I really can't get wired up about a hot looking blonde terminator out to terminate John Conner and Kate Brewster? The Beginning portion start out with a clear concise intro.. ""So I stay off the grid...""  with a Budweiser in his hand was a classic scene, the ending had a good twist, kind of a stalemate to assure there was no divisive winner or loser....everything within the body of the movie just got lost in the translation though.",1348185600,,495,4.488888888888889
1472362,4,B00005JM0B,"The machines aren't the only things rising. The sight of the TX cyborg, played by Kristanna Loken, causes my body to react automatically. Her face, which only occasionally breaks expressionless focus for a slight grin, is perfectly cute. Her body is perfectly slim. It's her conduct that could use some work. Her merciless aggression is a turn-on, yes, but the girl is literally a killing machine. So if she touches you, it's only to take the form of your body when you're dead.

The ""Terminator"" moniker now refers to her. The T-101 model, played by an Arnold Schwarzenegger who looks older but still fit for the role, is now the savior. He's been sent from the future to protect the lives of John Conner and his future wife from both the TX and the near nuclear holocaust the people of the world will face as a result of the Skynet computer virus. The virus has infiltrated our machines and decided to wipe us out, hence the movie's subtitle.

This part 3, which doesn't feature Linda Hamilton and isn't directed by James Cameron, disappointingly enough, is inferior to part 2 but superior (better) than part 1. There are surprisingly funny moments and the overall plot, while riddled with improbable coincidences and stodgy dialogue, is consistently engaging. The best scenes are the fight and shoot ones that revolve around the TX. There's an extended chase involving a crane truck that's actually quite remarkable.

What I liked about it:
1. Arnold is back!
2. Kristanna Lokan was an excellent T-X!
3. The visual effects were excellent!
4. The plot was well thought out!
5. Nick Stall was (for the most part)a great John Connor!
6. Claire Danes was very emotional with her character!
And played Katie Bruster well!
7. The whole concept of Skynet (the machines) taking over was
well played out!'
8. That crane chase was spell-binding!
9. The scene with Arnold walking into the strip club for
women was priceless!
10. It had a few good funny moments in here and there!
11. The pace was great and kept the movie going...!
12. I loved the scene of Arnold crashing through the wall
with the coffin and the shoot-out that comes afterwards!
13. The battle in the bathroom between Arnold and Kristanna was epic!
14. I loved the scene in the food market (""Talk to the hand!"")!

What I didn't like was:
1. They screwed up the time line a bit; In Terminator 2:
Judgement Day, it was established that John Connor was
ten-years-old, but in this movie they said he was thirteen
when the second movie took place!
2. they could have had some better punch-lines for Arnold!

Overall, this was a very welcome edition to the Terminator universe!
Highly recommended to anyone who is an Arnold fan, action flick lover,
or a fan of the Terminator universe!

1472455,5,B00005JM0B,"About two decades ago, maybe closer to three, a friend strongly recommended viewing ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day."" I hesitated. I just didn't like Arnold Schwartzenegger movies all that well. He persisted saying this was much different. Since he had the VHS tape, it was easy. Well, that was one of the best movies I'd seen in years. It was action, action, action, plus it was funny. Great movie!

Well, now the Terminator is our Governator and there's not all that much action in Sacramento. So be it. The term is near the end. As I was looking through the discount DVD bins at my local Ross Store, I found ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines."" I heard that it wasn't as good as Terminator 2, but  what the hey, it was under three bucks. Well, it was a good, highly entertaining movie. Action, action, action from beginning to end. It was one long, elaborate chase movie, and quite well done!

I don't watch stuff like this for the story. It''s just way to far fetched. I can't get into it. Don't take me wrong, I really enjoyed the movie but the story was just a way of stringing the action together. Man, what a chase! I've never seen so many cars and assorted property destroyed in such a short time! The movie must have cost a major fortune to make and how did they ever manage to do it in the midst of the city? It's awe inspiring! And the sets were magnificent! No expenses spared. I'm amazed at the whole thing. Who cares about the story? It's modern day Superman against a space-age Wonder Woman and a struggle to the death for both. And it's funny. I suppose most people woulldn't consider it to be a comedy, but it is. Arnold is quite droll, and hilarious. It's excellent entertainment. I wouldn't rate it as high as Terminator 2, but if you like stuff like this, it's well worth viewing.

2003 / 109 min. / Rated R

Synopsis: John Connor (Nick Stahl) is now in his 20's, and a female terminator, called T-X (Kristanna Loken), is after him. Another T-101 is sent back through time to protect John once again on the verge of the rise of the machines.

After 12 long years, I was sure to be the first in my seat for the third installment of the Terminator series. Personally, I liked the idea of mixing in a female Terminator, and I was happy to see that the series' storyline had actually progressed. This time around, however, James Cameron did not write nor direct this installment, and I would be willing to bet that's why there's so much hostility towards this entry (and I'm sure the dropping of Sarah Connor didn't help matters either).

This may not be a popular opinion, but director Jonathan Mostow (""Breakdown"") with screenwriters John Brancato and Michael Ferris delivered a high-octane action film that is infectiously entertaining. I think Mostow should be commended for retaining a Cameron feel to the proceedings and deserves kudos for the nods to the previous two films. I really liked how streamlined this outing is. There's no pretentiousness here, the film strictly aims to entertain. It's a true-blue summer movie. The effects are still top notch - in fact, it's visually the best of the three - and the ending is both gutsy and a complete knockout.

Many die hard fans, however, complained the film was just ""more of the same"". They felt it didn't deviate enough from T2. Interestingly, they seem to forget that the same could be said of T2 in relation to the first Terminator. Sequels generally follow their own formula, and this franchise - up to now - is no different. It all depends how you shape the existing concept and how far you're willing to stretch it. For me, Rise of the Machines took it much further than T2. That said, many fans were hoping for more exposition and explanations that - in honesty - really aren't all that necessary at this point and ultimately, it would only bog the movie down. It seems too many fans wanted more of a technical and dramatic interpretation of the story and were disappointed to get a full blown action film with some comedic gags instead. The latter seemed to rub some fans the wrong way. In a scene or two, I can understand how they could feel the humor went too far, but it really isn't too far removed from the comedic shenanigans of T2. The bottom line for me is that the movie is still loads of fun (and interesting) while staying true to the big-budget formula of its predecessor. Sure, there's some inconsistencies, mainly with John Connor's character (he says he was 13 at the time of T2, but yet he was actually supposed to be 10), and he still hasn't fully understood what's going on (I mean, he should know that these terminators are mass-produced, right?). But these issues aside, Nick Stahl did a nice job with the role. I was - and still am - quite happy with this film that elicited both nostalgia and something new to boot.

1472497,4,B00005JM0B,"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines may not be up to par in relation to T2, but it provides a good gap between now and then ('then' being Terminator: Salvation). The story is mostly forgettable, with no imagination from the previously released films. The plot does have one great and solid point - we get to see the action from the perspective of a new-comer played by Clare Danes. It is nice to have a focus point outside to distract from some minor plot holes. And it is completely optional to your enjoyment of Salvation. The plot has another thing going for it: it's tons and tons of fun. And fun is awesome in my book.

The quality of the visuals is astounding, with little to no tell-tale signs of digital shadow or green screen edges, and the Blu-Ray images almost make up for the loops in the plot line. The sound track is all crunchy and shiny with the grinding of vehicles and the gurgling blasts of energy from the T-X, the newest version in the Terminator series. The interface/menu pop ups are simple and easy to navigate at a glance. Some Blu-Ray menus are a pain with text too small or otherwise hard to navigate; not so here. The behind-the-scenes are pretty inclusive without being redundant, and they included my favorite sort of all - the Blooper Reel. A close second in this case would by the Sgt. Candy scene... I laughed out loud, probably to the annoyance of my neighbours. There is also a feature with Todd McFarlane talking (if you can call it that) about his line of Terminator toys.

All in all, this is a solid film for Blu-Ray and sound systems. It's a fun flick packed with extras. And you really can't beat the price... at least since the writing of this review.",1311984000,,1692,4.472491909385114
1472498,3,B00005JM0B,"I wasn't a huge fan of T3 the first time I saw it. it's a much sillier film than 1 and 2, with more emphasis on action set-pieces than horror or character development. That said, T3 holds up a lot better to a second viewing than I expected. Arnold gets in some good one-liners, Kristanna Loken is suitably spooky as the T-X (a sort of hybrid of the T-800 and T-1000) and there's still a good mashup of CG and model effects. Watching this movie immediately after 1 and 2, it DOES feel like it fits in.

The whole package is pretty minimal. You get the typical less-plastic recycled material blu ray box with no liner notes of any kind, and the disk itself has no main menu- it launches straight to the movie and any special content must be accessed using the (decent) pop-up menu. This wouldn't be so bad, except this disk still blocks the player saving your position if you have to stop the film. WHY? You aren't skipping any ads or trailers by doing so; there are none. In terms of special featurs, you get a blooper reel, a smattering of trailers, Arnold's hilarious but inappropriate ""Sgt. Candy"" deleted scene, and a pretty worthy number of commentary tracks (which are still about the most interesting special feature in a movie IMO).

The transfer itself is decent, although it doesn't look nearly as sharp as T2 or many contemporary BDs. I'm not sure if this is a result of lazy mastering or just how the film is shot. T3 is very heavily processed for color in many scenes, and the outdoor shots are all desert and have a smudged, washed out look by design, so it may just not be a very sharp film. It certainly looks better than DVD, but not as clear as you might expect. Perhaps I'm just spoiled.

Overall I can recommend T3 as a worthwhile entry in the series, although not as compelling as any of the others. If you plan to collect the whole franchise, then T3 is a decent stepping-block to the fantastic Terminator: Salvation. If you're just in the market for a sci fi movie, you might want to keep moving, however; there isn't a lot about this film to attract new fans to Terminator.",1311552000,,2096,4.424870466321243

I thought Terminator Salvation was one of the best movies of the year. So when I sat down and watched this, I was blown away.

I liked this movie, it's not as edgy as T2, but it's great. Nobody wanted to hear this part of the story, but it had to be done. I think it was done rather well.

What I liked most of all is: As you watch this, you can't help feel like it's a T2 ripoff. (That's probably why most fans didn't go 4 this movie) You think they will yet again stop judgement day from ever happening and everything will be alright. Until you get to that last scene, at the end, where they go down the elevator to the shelter for VIP's and realize that they can't stop it. They never could.

1472593,4,B00005JM0B,"T3 seems to be bashed or forgotten amongst critics and several people I know, but though its not the best of the first three, it still has structure/feel of T1 and T2.  The story picks up several years after part two and you ultimately find out what happened in part two didn't stop Skynet from taking over, but rather delayed the takeover.  The story does seem to expand on John Conner's role in the coming war, but T3 also includes his future spouse and how they meet.

The action and the one liners in this movie are still great.  The title ""Rise of the Machines"" did leave the series open.  T3 is definitely non-stop and exiciting.  It does complete T1 and T2 and keeps in line with what we come to expect with a Terminator movie.

1472596,2,B00005JM0B,"With James Cameron doing writing and directing of the first two Terminator movies, I was hoping that he'd have a part of the third movie like usual.  Though I have heard he wanted to but wasn't going to be given full creative control of the movie then they ended up getting other people like writers and director.  I don't know which part went wrong but it seems like there are some things like in the writing that got a little messed up, due to like with the story line in some sense.  The first movie obviously took place in May 1984, then the second film took part in sometime in 1995, but according to the opening of Terminator 3, the second film took part in 1998 which would be 6 or more months after Judgment Day had occurred.

It was interesting to see what kind of Terminator that they would try to come up with for this movie and even though that it was a female that played the new one called the 'Termatrix' or 'T-X' for short.  Some of the stuff I think was nice on paper but the execution of it could've been better in the end along with maybe the writing could've been better as well.  While watching the movie it, to me it seems like it don't have that 'Terminator' feeling to it like the other movies had and I think the crew that worked on the movie should've understood the mythology of the movie franchise better maybe this movie could've been better.

1.  Directing--Good job from Jonathan Mostow (U-571 and Surrogates). I think that this was the worst in the series because you don't have James Cameron back behind the camera. Even though, the directing was good.
2.  Script--Good writing job from John Brancato and Michael Ferris. Nice writing and they did a good job continuing the Terminator universe storyline.
3.  Acting--Just like the first two, the acting is supurb. Arnold Schwarzenegger is back again. You also have Nick Stahl and Kristanna Loken.

Now for the content review.
Rated R for strong sci-fi action and violence, language and brief nudity.

1.  Sex/Nudity=3/10. One nudity scene from Kristanna Loken. It is brief as the rating ensures.
2.  Violence/Gore=8/10. There is still a lot of violence just like the first two.
3.  Language=6/10. Very low on language. Only 3 F-words and other profanities.

Final thoughts...Overall, still 5/5. Even though it is horrible compared to the first two movies, it is still pretty good if you don't compare it. In my opinion, they shouldn't have made it if James Cameron wasn't directing.",1292889600,,1198,5.128865979381444

Many people complain that the movie is too humurous and not as dark as the others. But I say the epic ending of this movie proves that wrong. And any humor in this movie only expands off of Terminator 2's humor. The action in this movie is very intense and the chase scenes rival even that of Terminator 2. Terminator 3 also expands and moves the Terminator plot foward unlike Terminator Salvation.

The picture and sound are top notch and the visual effects are amazing. The only downside to this movie is there is no Sara Conner and her death seemed cheap only by explanation. Other than that this is a good sequel and great to add as a third chapter. Salvation stands as the onlybad terminator movie for one simple reason why wouldn't skynet just kill Kyle Reese as soon as they identified him. This ruined the entire Salvation film.

1472702,5,B00005JM0B,"James Cameron's Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), the high velocity sequel to the original Terminator (1984), set an extremely high standard for the Terminator franchise.  Even so, Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines (2003), directed by Jonathan Mastow (U-571, Breakdown), is very worthy addition to this science fiction saga.  The hard hitting sequel, concentrates on spectacular straight ahead action, while advancing the Terminator story to the infamous `judgment day'.

Terminator 3 incorporates many of same basic elements from the previous films, particularly T2.  In his last action role before becoming the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger returns again as a different model of the Terminator, once again sent back into the past, tasked with protecting John Connor (Nick Stahl).  A killer T-X Terminator, played by the striking Kristanna Loken, is sent back in time, with a list of humans to be terminated.  As in T2, the T-X is an upgraded version of terminator, constructed of liquid metal, that can change its physical form to mimic anyone it comes in contact with.  In addition, the T-X can control other machines.

Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), who is John Connor's future wife, is also on the T-X's hit list.  Circumstances bring all the major players together, at Brewster's veterinary clinic, where the Terminator and the T-X have their first encounter, starting a thrilling and relentless chase, that lasts for the remainder of the film.  Special effects are a major component, and with people like Stan Winston involved, they are generally spectacular, and executed at an extremely high level.

The story may be a familiar one, but the effectiveness of the tale is enhanced by some strong performances.  Some might argue that playing the Terminator may not require great acting skills, but few can match Arnold Schwarzenegger's huge screen presence, in this physically demanding role.  Borrowing from Robert Patrick's performance in T2, the striking Kristanna Loken plays a heartless killing machine with a feminine form.  She also has very few lines, as like Schwarzenegger, her role depends heavily on her athletic skills and physical presence.  It is quite an impressive performance, as clad in a dark red leather suit, and looking like a young Anne Francis, Loken is quite convincing as Arnold's physical equal.

Last minute hire Claire Danes, handles her role well, as a character that goes through major transformations, and suffers the loss of loved ones.  Now in his 20's, John Connor is far from a world saving hero.  Nick Stahl is an interesting choice for this intriguing character, who does not seem very capable of fulfilling his destiny.

Working largely from a very successful template, and featuring outstanding special effects, director Jonathan Mostow does a very competent job of executing a script that features a nice blend of familiar story elements, and some new twists.  Things are a bit rushed at the end, and the conclusion is somewhat anticlimactic, and uncertain, with the future in the hands of a somewhat shaky John Connor.  An exciting and violently fun adventure, Terminator 3 is a solid addition to any action film fan's collection.",1276819200,3,3196,5.227450980392157
1472703,2,B00005JM0B,"Remember back in my reviews of the first two Terminator movies when I would review Rise of the Machines eventually? That was long overdue and now I am finally going to review it. This will be my response to BackToGood's review of this movie. I am not making fun of anybody who may like the film, I am just going to explain my opinions. I think of this as the weakest link in the franchise. The movie takes place in the year 2004 and after the events of Judgment Day, Skynet didn't give up. They send a female Terminator known as the Terminatrix (T-X for short, played by Kristanna Loken) to kill a now adult John Connor (Nick Stahl) while the rebels send a reprogrammed T-850 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to defend him and another victim Kate Brewster (Claire Daines). Gee, does that sound familiar? That's right. It is the basically the same premise as the first two. As it turns out, in 2032, the T-850 killed Connor in battle before Kate successfully reprogrammed it and Judgment Day is inevitable. We also learn that Sarah died of Leukemia prior to the events of this entry and after Cyberdyne was destroyed in its predecessor, the U.S. Air Force took over the Skynet project, and John and Kate were married in the future. How is that possible? I thought all the evidence was eliminated in the second film's climax and the severed arm of the T-800 would have been useless! I heard in the novel that John tossed the arm in the molten steel as well. After a series of mishaps, the T-X manages to spread some virus in the Skynet system when it activated. After a cartoonish fight between the two terminators, the T-850 took on so much damage that he begins to attack John from the malfunctioning system, but manages to resist and temporarily shut down to recover while John and Kate get to the so-called Skynet core. The T-850 uses an exploding power cell and sacrifices himself to eliminate the T-X. However, John and Kate realize that Skynet doesn't have a source and instead is a software system that has spread to all the computers in the world, which is why Judgment Day would still occur anyway, so John decides to become the leader of the Resistance and fulfill his destiny. I'm sorry, but I just couldn't get into this movie. It is just mediocre at best. The story is not interesting, the acting is wooden, the logic makes no sense, the action scenes are silly, and the visual effects are nothing special. The C.G.I. is the same quality as those of many films today and has some of the fakest looking makeup in the entire series! Even the first movie had better makeup than that, and that was a low-budget B-movie! I didn't think it added much to the story either. All it had to offer is saying the children of John and Kate would have an important purpose later on, hence Kate's pregnancy in Salvation, and that's it! Nothing compared to what the first two had to offer. And the biggest oddity, a female terminator! Loken showed no talent in comparison to the T-800 and T-1000 from the first two, she is just more like a sex symbol similar to Megan Fox! Come on, cyborgs aren't sexy, cyborgs are steel! Give me talent over eye candy anyday! I understand that T2 had a few loose ends like John still existing after thinking Skynet was erased (Think about it, Kyle Reese was sent to the past to protect Sarah in the first movie and they conceived John during their last night together so if Skynet was stopped, John would normally cease to exist, but he didn't!), but the Sarah Connor Chronicles make this entry obsolete and unnecessary because it was so much better, in fact ranks right up with the two Cameron ones. I just had to see the pilot episode to know how good the show was in general. I usually give entries in a franchise that try something new better reviews than those that are basically spoofs, and this is no exception. You know? A breath of fresh air! Even Salvation was better than this (guilty pleasure, that is), and that was rated PG-13! Live Free or Die Hard is the prime example that the MPAA rating does not a good or bad movie make. Unless if you are a true Terminator fan, please rent it first. Just my two cents.

If you want to know more as to why this is my personal least favorite of the series, Chris Lighthiser did a 5-part rant of this film on Youtube which is on the ""like"" list of my Youtube account labeled under my real name, Jerred Zoll.  Pretty much everything he says, I agree on.",1276128000,3,4423,4.479553903345725

1472705,5,B00005JM0B,"As time has gone by, I now realize that the strongest film ""trilogy"" in all of film history may absolutely be the TERMINATOR franchise! I'm not even going to get into the continuation past the first 3 films because I actually think that the first 3 are good enough to complete the series. While T1 and T2 both have the reputation of being iconic, legendary films, I have to pointedly admit, before I get into the details of the review for this third film of the trifecta TERMINATOR 3 (T3):RISE OF THE MACHINES (2003), that I absolutely enjoyed T3 upon first viewing MORE than I did either T1 or T2! And I freely admit that I believe T3 to be BETTER than T2 and close to as good as T1! And I don't think my opinion will ever change on this.

T1 is quite frankly perhaps the best sci-fi action film of all time. The T1 special effects are somewhat dated, but the futuristic Skynet scenes were still waaaaay ahead of their time and the stop-motion effects set the stage for later successful sci-fi genre films of the 80s. The T1 effects are just as influential for the 80s as T2 was for CGI in current films. But the main draw of T1 is it's audaciously scary atmosphere, breakneck pace, original and complex story, solid script, and terrific performances. T2, IMHO, is very overrated film and ironically is the opposite of T1 in that T2 lacks in all the areas that make T1 great (story, script, pace, acting) and compensates (to an extent) in the one area that T1 falls a bit short (the special effects). But, based on influence in the area of big-budget effects/CGI, T2 is undeniably a visually stimulating film, if heavily flawed one. T2 had a good ideas and a believable story, but the execution was subpar IMHO. That said, T2 is necessary as a piece to the puzzle to link the 3 films together.

T3 has the advantage in that it is able to ""borrow"" elements that made both T1 and T2 great and pattern a more complete film. But, it doesn't work IF you don't have the right filmmaker for the job. I am here to tell all, in the absence of T1 and T2's maker James Cameron, the director of T3, Jonathan Mostow, has done a MASTERFUL job! And I'm not sure Cameron could have done better because I think he lost his storytelling ability a long time ago. Mostow takes the best parts of both T1 and T2 and formulates perhaps the most fully eye-popping, enjoyable film of the franchise. He also injects it with timely, very appealing humor that pays homage to the the first 2 films. But make no mistake, T3 is NOT just a trivial popcorn summer action flick...it actually has a real pulse and heart to boot that underscores all of the action and humor...Fancy that!

Not only does T3 stay faithful to the Terminator franchise, but also it is an exciting and original action film the likes of which I don't think had been done since the late 80s/early 90s. In retrospect, I actually think that T3 may perhaps be the best ACTION film of the 00s. And that is NOT a joke! I think much of the negativity against T3 has a lot to do just with the fact that it is within the domain of the Terminator franchise and held up to a certain standard that most other actions films would not. If one just looks at this film objectively, knowing nothing about Terminator, it is one heck of a fun, nonstop wild ride! A huge reason that the action scenes work in T3 is not just due to their scope and energy, but also because a high percentage of it is REAL, that is, very little to no CGI! This was real actors doing real stunts and what little CGI that exists in T3 is integrated so well into the real action that you don't even notice it's there. That's an accomplishment!

I must add to all this that just b/c I think T3 is the best action film of the 00s doesn't mean I think it is equal to T1 overall, which is the best of all time. I mean, in the 80s T1 was up against BLADE RUNNER, ALIENS, PREDATOR, and ROBOCOP, all highly received movies during that time and all of which are still highly regarded classics. While in the 00s, T3 is up against TRANSFORMERS, the STAR WARS prequels, and G.I. JOE; an action film half as good as T3 could have beaten out those empty-headed CGI-infested crapfests! T3 is kind of the best action film by default (but I think it would still rate high in the pre-CGI era) because it avoided CGI as much as possible, went with realism, and made it work. I'm not sure any other film in the 00s did this!

Now, to the actors! The great Arnold Schwarzenegger shines in his last film role (before politics) as the T850, a slightly advanced model from the T800 of T1 and T2; the T850 is programmed to sustain more damage and also to analyze and react to human emotions. Just like in T2, in T3 Arnie is the good Terminator sent back to early 21st century Los Angeles to protect John Connor (played this time by Nick Stahl in a captivating performance) and a new character Kate Brewster (refreshingly played by Clare Danes). John and Kate have an important connection to the future salvation of the human race. Arnie's T850 was sent back to protect John and Kate from the highly advanced TX model, which is, in addition to being liquid metal in configuration like the T1000 in T2, also body-equipped with an armed arsenal. The TX is played by newcomer Kristanna Loken and this gorgeous actress was simply amazing in this role, what should be a starmaking performance; she nails the part of the determined, resourceful, cold-blooded killing machine. Arnie from T1 and Patrick from T2 would be proud! Being the main human characters, Stahl and Danes get the bulk of the dialogue and display top-notch acting, but both Arnie and Loken make the most of their miniscule lines, especially Arnie of course! But Loken actually gets to do a lot of physical stuff similar to Patrick in T2 and she is quite convincing. And Arnie's one-liners are absolute gold in this film! They remind us of Arnie's brilliant comic timing in his 80s movies, but they are fused well with the more modern references and will probably never grow old! T3 is the final reminder that Arnie is the GREATEST action film star of all time!

I know I keep bringing up T1 and T2 a lot when referring to T3, but it feels necessary as T3 did such a bang up job borrowing from those films and forging it's own identity. And T3 adds in perfectly timed humor that keeps one interested in the action. But the main reason the action works is because time is invested in the characters, thanks mainly to a top notch script. We care about what happens to the characters, so that makes the action more palpable. Also, a thing I noticed upon repeated viewings is how well the MINOR characters were done in this; I found their reactions to all the craziness going on to be spot on and authentic (you know, the way REAL people would act!). It's rare to get this in an action movie. The director actually took the time to ensure that ALL actors were up to the task...Crazy, huh?!

And what action there is! I almost forgot the best part...The action is literally nonstop, is brilliantly edited, and is not there just for show. Every action moment is NECESSARY to move the plot along. (1) The first big scene is a big reason why T3 is contender for decade's best action film: a jaw-droppingly exciting and intense 10-minute chase scene ripe with police cars, fire engines, a civilian vehicle, and a crane! People should be talking for YEARS on how they accomplished that amazing scene!(2) The pulse-pounding middle graveyard scene, and (3) The climactic battle between Arnie's T850 and Loken's TX at the Skynet facility, not only the best fight of the Terminator series, but one of the best fights ever portrayed in any film!

But in the midst of all the action, the film has a lot of heart and humor, as well as a thoughtful, provocative ending. My T3 review might seem like too much praise, but we're talking about a fully entertaining throwback action film (in the CGI era and the 00s, possibly the worst decade for film ever!) with healthy doses of humor and wit for good measure AND the advantage of being a Terminator film...Sounds like a winner to me! Also, I feel this film is hugely  underrated and a lot of the unfavorable reviews seem to say it is a ripoff of T2, a film that I barely even like! T3 has a lot more in common with T1 (which I love) than T2. Probably a big reason why I rate it so highly.

I highly recommend that anyone buy the dvd of this film because it is more than just a simple action movie. There is a lot of subtlety in the script and character detail that you may not pick up on the first time because of the breakneck pace, humor, and action that is ever-present...Buy it ASAP!",1272931200,2,8654,4.423462986198244

Co-starring Earl Boen who played Dr. Silbermen from the first two movies and David Andrews, this is the weakest installment of the franchise which doesn't have the magic of the first two movies from James Cameron. Miss Lokken is quite sexy as the new villain but is no match for the deadly villains of the first two movies even the T-1000, Jonathan Mostow who directed ""Breakdown"" and ""U-571"" is in place of Cameron for this installment does offer some good action sequences and decent acting but it's quite flawed even with some of the corny humor thrown in.

This 2-Disc Special Edition DVD has great extras like audio commentaries, interviews, trailer, featurettes, an HBO making-of documentary, intro by Arnold, gag reel, build your own action sequence feature, storyboards, datebase files on characters including history of the film franchise, deleted but funny Sgt.

EDIT:

Ok I thought the above review was more than enough words to describe this dumb movie. I'm at a total loss, or was the last time I watched this which was the first hour a few days ago before I shut it off remembering how it ended and not caring. The script shows an astounding lack of creativity and imagination by being a simple retread of the first, well more like a very watered down weak moronic remake of part 2. The two young leads whose names I cannot remember are horrible actors, the Terminatrix is completely stupid, Arnold's last go as the T-800 is very cartoonish and he even seems to put emotion into his lines. This movie is a mess from the get go, very light and airy compared to Cameron's films, the guy is probably slapping his forehead each time a team of 2300032 screenwriters and producers get together and slop out another bastardization of The Terminator whether it be this and the other new film or that piss weak TV show.

1472835,4,B00005JM0B,"The Terminator idea is something of great intrigue to me and although it may seem extremely farfetched and even a bit bizarre that I would believe such a thing, I do actually think a machine uprising is a possibility. We as a race strive to create more advanced machines every day; machines that are capable of independent thought and maintenance are just around the corner. There is no denying that if we continue to create more and more intelligent machines and rely more on the interweaving network systems we currently have in place, there will come a point, in my eyes, not too far in the future that machines will realise humans are obsolete and realise that no longer need us around. I know it's weird, but it's the way I think. I also think Scientology isn't as bizarre as the media would have us believe. Let's make one thing clear, I'm not a Scientologist or a recluse nerd, I just think in weird ways.

The original Terminator movie kicked off a truly brilliant series that lead to the triumphant sequel, subtitled Judgment Day. Nobody thought it could ever be topped and in many ways, with T3, they were right. It received quite critical reviews upon its original release and even had some people hating the very idea of making it a trilogy. Considering the age of Schwarzenegger, it was originally rumoured that he may not be able to be cast in this movie, and because of that rumour, the films production was condemned immediately. Luckily Arnie was able to participate in the movie, and actually got himself into shape and looking the way he did 10 years ago.

T3 is set roughly 10 years after the events of Judgment Day and now another enemy of the future is sent back to assassinate the leader of the future resistance against the machines, John Connor. Not only is it John now in the firing line, but it's also the other members of the resistance, including Johns future wife, Katherine Brewster. The new enemy is the most advanced Terminator yet. Known as the T-X or Terminatrix, this female Terminator, played by Kristanna Loken is the most brutal machine to date. She can create any weapon from her arms and just appears more heartless than any machine could possibly be. John is once again protected by a new T-101 (Arnie) and is told that the Judgment Day he thought he stopped was merely postponed and is actually inevitable. Now with the help of the new T-101, Katherine & John must keep away from the T-X and try to find her father who is heading Skynet to try and find a new way of trying the prevent the Rise of the Machines.

There is quite a bit that can be said negatively about this film, but there's also a bit of good to talk about as well. One of the biggest criticisms I have is the casting of Nick Stahl as John Connor. I don't mind Nick Stahl as an actor, but as the rebellious John Connor, he's simply not the right man for the job. I personally think Edward Furlong would have done a much better job had he reprised the role. I also felt that the absence of the Sarah Connor character was another big downfall for the third film as she's certainly a benchmark character for these movies, much like Arnold. Clare Danes as Katherine Brewster was just bland, I never found myself believing in the character and felt the film could survive without that character. I felt that she was simply a device to explain the plot of the Terminator history (or future, whichever way you see it) for the new viewers who may not have seen the original films. Kristanna Loken was triumphant as the T-X and for a female Terminator, I now can't think of anyone better for the role.

A few things within the film didn't make sense to me, but I can't talk about them because it will ruin it for those who haven't seen it. One thing that bugged me about it, however, was the whole idea that Judgment Day was inevitable. If that is so, then what was the purpose of blowing up Cyberdyne Systems in T2 to prevent Judgment Day when it's actually just a way of postponing it? The CGI within, is really well done and the chase scene in which the T-X is driving a giant crane which destroys almost an entire town, is possibly the best action sequence in many years of film. The effects involving the Terminators is also very well done, apart from the hand to hand fight scene which had great potential, but just ended up looking like a big budget slapstick comedy sketch.

The comedy moments are also a big downfall and dragged the mood of the film down to a ridiculous level. Thankfully, the doomsday mood was brought back through the immense action scenes and it managed to keep me entertained for the entire runtime. Flaws aside, it's a good addition to the series and although many loyal fans of the first two films may trash it, I enjoyed it and believe that those who have yet to see it should at least give it a chance.",1244592000,,4836,4.478458049886621
1472836,3,B00005JM0B,"This week's Sid the Elf feature is Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. This film was just another step along our path to review every movie Arnold ever made. Well, except for the awful Conan movies. This one followed the ridiculously successful&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Terminator-2-Judgment-Day-Extreme-DVD/dp/B00008PC2O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Terminator 2 - Judgment Day (Extreme DVD)</a>. By conventional wisdom, this film failed miserably when compared to its predessor. But, by B standards it might have been just a touch better even though it lacked the same awesomeness that caused us to give T2 5 stars.

The B-ness of this flick was almost overwhelming. There's Arnold and his snare drum tight face. There's the fact that they needed to replace the extremely popular(in T2) Edward Furlong for Nick Stahl due to a substance abuse problem. Oh yeah! Also, they supposedly recycled a bunch of ideas that didn't make the cut for T2 such as the female Terminator. Arnold is still protecting John Connor against Skynet and their female Terminator. Arnold also has to protect Claire Daines(John's future wife), a tough job for anyone to get motivated for. Sophia Bush was originally slated for this role. That would have added a star at least. O well. The big wrinkle in this one is that we find out that the T-X is back in good old 2004 from the future to not only kill John Connor, but his lieutenants too. Why? Because she kills John Connor in 2032. But we've already seen that history can be rewritten once because Judgment Day didn't occur in 1997 as predicted in Da Terminator. The question is: Can history be rewritten again?

Sadly, this movie fell short. Maybe it was the lack of Arnold lines none of which we would find on a soundboard. Also, the appeal of the indestructability of the T-X was a bit old as we saw that already in T2. Aside from a few cool plot points this one just felt rehashed from the previous films. Sid says its a stay-away. We would NOT have enjoyed this one back in the glory days.",1244592000,,2070,4.9971014492753625

1472898,2,B00005JM0B,"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines gave me new appreciation for the uneven television show Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles. At least the show wasn't wasn't dull.

The film started off well enough, with a grimness that fits in well with the original movie. But soon it becomes clear that was meant to cover for cruddy production values, stiff dialogue and uneven characterization. (It's a strange day when Arnold Schwarzenegger overacts in a part.)

There's the illogical writing -- none of the characters find it strange that they can break into a top-secret military facility that seemingly has no guards around and no personnel at all -- and CGI-generated robot threats that change size based on how large or small their environs are.

And then there's the conclusion. I know, it was supposed to be grim (and possibly set up a sequel, which I suppose it does, even though it's one in which everyone involved is disavowing the third movie), but it's delivered with no oomph, and what should be a horrifying moment instead elicits a ""so what?""

This is a rental at best, but even then, most casual Terminator fans would be better served skipping this one entirely and just going straight from T2 to Salvation. If you must bridge the gap, watch the television show instead of this dud.",1242604800,3,1292,4.832579185520362
1472899,5,B00005JM0B,"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a very good action packed movie that has a very amazing and yet, frightening ending.

As a follower of the Terminator series, T3 really stands its own ground against T1 and T2.

The acting is good, but the story line is better. I know there were a lot of terminator fans that hated this movie, but i loved it. I saw it 4 times at the movie theater!

The story again revolves around John Connor, only this time, he's not the main target, his leadership is.

Skynet sends back the TX, a woman terminator who is equiped like Inspector Gadget with everything from flame throwers to chainsaws. She also has the power to control other machines, which makes for a great car chase scene in the movie.

Arnold is back, and he has some very funny lines (talk to the hand), but again, as a Terminator fan, the key moment was when he first appears on scene, very reminiscent of the Inidana Jones shadown scene in The Cyrstal Skull.

overall, the movie is excellent, and honestly, you don't have to know or have seen the 1st 2 movies to understand this one.

My favorite part of the movie is the ending. It has a very realistic doomsday feel like in the movie The Day After, with nukes coming out from the ground and blowing the world to Judgement Day in the Terminator movie.

The only thing that really bothered me about T3, is forced comedy (the Victoria's Secret scene, what's the point?) and some poor editing (how in the heck did both the Terminator and TX know to go to the Animal Shelter right away?)

but other than that, good movie. The DVD is excellent and features deleted scenes, features, and even the making of T3 and T3 the video game.

Overall, 5 stars. T3 stands its own ground. good popcorn movie, great ending.",1242000000,3,1755,4.4392523364485985
1472900,4,B00005JM0B,"If you watched the first two movies in this ""series,"" particularly the second film, then most of this should be very familiar territory. You can expect to see more of the same, meaning:

1 - Some spectacular action scenes; 2 - more action than is needed; 3 - A supposedly-unstoppable villain robot (this time a female); 3 - profane and somewhat annoying lead characters, except for Arnold, of course; 4 - seeing some naked butts (odd knowing one is the governor of Califronia); 5 - humor mixed in with all the violence; 6 - great overall special-effects and surround sound.

The first 30 minutes of this movie was the best part, I thought. Overall, there was so much action it wore me out but it was a worthy sequel to the last movie. If you enjoyed watching what the ""bad cyborg"" Robert Patrick could do in the ""Terminator 2,"" you'll really be entertained by his successor, played by Kristannia Loken. Like Patrick, she doesn't say much....but doesn't have to. Schwarzenegger, meanwhile, performs admirably in his last starring role (I think) before tackling bigger responsibilities in real life.",1241481600,2,1097,4.86096256684492

It's a good movie and all but I wouldn't think it would rate a re-release at over twice the price you can find it for out here.  Amazon still lists the 2-disk Widescreen Special Edition of this (with 830 reviews) but of course it's unavailable except via the Marketplace (from 99 up).

The movie companies are busy discontinuing some movies altogether rendering them unavailable and giving the scalpers at Ebay and Amazon Marketplace the opportunity to sell them for anywhere from $50 to $250, but then they re-release movies like this which have already made their rounds and have been rattling around the bargain bins for some time now, it makes no sense to me...

As far as the actual movie goes, I thought it was very entertaining, perhaps not quite as with 1 and 2, but entertaining nonetheless.  It adds to the story as opposed to detracting from it like some sequels seem inclined to do, and the special effects are outstanding.  I look forward to seeing what they've done with part 4.  -kd5-",1241395200,3,1065,4.663101604278075

No plot spoilers from me. This time SkyNet is targeting the John Conner in his 20s, and once again two Terminators are sent back in time; one to ""terminate"" and one to protect.

There are a lot of technical issues with this movie (i.e. only living flesh can be sent back, remote control of cars and trucks the were not made for it, etc). The casting of John's love interest was an interesting choice, since she looks much older and more mature than he does and they should be the same age.

The new ""Terminatrix"" is very cool and totally scary! Arnold also puts in a strong performance and still looks cools as the ""obsolete"" model.

The Special Effects are very good and likely the best of the lot.

This was an enjoyable movie with a little suspension of disbelief.

Recommended for fans of the franchise.

Thankfully Mostow kept most of the story intact, and was a decent film. Even though a lot of people dislike this one, I think it still fits in with the overall story. I looked forward to seeing the culmination of everything in T4:Salvation, but was completely disapointed. Since then, I have gained a little more respect for this movie.",1231286400,,657,4.349593495934959
1472906,4,B00005JM0B,"I've liked this movie since I first saw it in the theater but my fondness for the film has only grown since it's home versions.

The story is good, the acting is fine, I actually like Nick Stahl alot better than Edward Furlong as John Connor, the graphics and action are excellent but my favorite feature is the fantastic sound design. This is one of my top ten favorite movies for sound. It's among the first I pop in to try out a new sound system. Every one of the action bits here is grade ""A"" demo material.

The standard dvd was very good on it's own but the Blu Ray is just that much better. Paramount has transfered over the HD DVD master here but that's nothing to complain about as the chases, gun fights, explosions and all the lovely sounds of twisted and contorting metal are dynamically presented in high bit rate Dolby Digital Plus. You may want to tape your windows because your subwoofer will just about blow them out from all the booming your gonna get here.

The video, while not the most impressive on Blu Ray, is still a nice improvement over the standard def release. The picture is pretty clean and free of dirt and other distracting blemishes. The details are pretty sharp and the colors can pop from time to time. It could've been better but it's still a pretty good transfer.

I've heard far too many complaints about this movie but I find it to be fun, action packed and a fine sequel to the Terminator franchise. I don't think it right to constantly compare it with the previous two, but rather to rate it on it's own merits. Either way, T3 moved the story along nicely and set a nice premise for the upcoming T4 sequel which is in the works now. From start to finish though, this is a fun, fast-paced film and a worthy upgrade for fans and Blu Ray owners. Highly recommended.",1229558400,5,1803,4.389221556886228
1472907,2,B00005JM0B,"If only someone could create a real Terminator with time-traveling capacity, I wish he'd go back in time and destroy this script before it was ever turned into a movie.

As another reviewer said, this movie was more Arnold's big bang exit from Hollywood into politics than a worthy addition to the Terminator saga. The story really ended, with all ends neatly tied, with T-2. Terminator 3 is more like Karate Kid 3, a movie that had no reason for being and only served to take away from its predecessors.

Many have harsh opinions about James Cameron but the man could tell a story with meaning, his absence from both writing and directing this movie is absolutely obvious. The first two Terminators were about love, the will to survive and the fact that fate does not have the last say: The future is not written, you can choose differently. If you take T3 at its word, it tells you precisely the opposite.

I'm willing to ignore Edward Furlong was not chosen to reprise John Connor and neither do I have a problem with the character as a washed-up, broken man haunted by his past. Harder to swallow is Linda Hamilton's absence from the movie, she's just too important a character. So we are given new actors, new characters and the story which was neatly packaged in T2 is broken out of its box and totally prostituted here. To add insult, neither Nick Stahl nor Claire Danes are allowed by the script to take up their mantle and shape their futures, it is all left up to Arnold to do most of the fighting.

Then we're dealt another punch: In spite of what the previous movies built up to, John Connor is not the real threat to Skynet, it is and always was, his wife Kate! At that point I rolled my eyes and waited for the movie to end. When the scene where an older John Connor raises his hands in victory after the end of the future war, the bad make-up and fake beard on Nick Stahl didn't even manage to elicit a groan at that point.

The new T-X is a gorgeous looking Kristanna Loken who is neither threatening nor intimidating, just a blatant gimmick! Seriously, how intimidating was Arnold on the first? How creepy was Robert Patrick on T-2? But Loken? Well, this ""Terminatrix"" (I kid you not - that is the name of the new model) is a more advanced Terminator and is able to ""speak"" to machines, like sending unmanned police cars against the good guys. How can a computer program speak to cars, which are mechanical and analog, the movie does not explain, nor is it that important because it is just boring.

The movie merits at least one star because the special effects are excellent and the acting was as good as can be expected from the horrid direction and script. Ironically this was Arnold's last big movie to date and he looked like he could act. No Robert de Niro acting, mind you, but a long way from Hercules, his first movie. The rest is an insult to the original story.

In the end, there are those like James Cameron who will create a screenplay and movie appropriate to the times with themes that are timeless. Then there are those like the writers and director of this movie who will prostitute that same story, piggyback on its success, contribute nothing but in fact take away from it just to make money off it. The medium ""Man vs Machine"" is trite now; it wasn't so when Cameron wrote T1. In fact, T1 (which came out in '84) was more about nuclear Cold War angst than fear of machines. Even in '92 -when T2 came out- it was still appealing, but now after the Matrix movies the genre has lost its newness. You can't really blame a machine since it's not a free agent, it's just a system gone haywire and by taking away all the meaning and layers of the previous movies (romance, gutsy characters, philosophical implications) T3 isn't much more fun than an episode of Robot Wars on TV. It parasites off T1 and T2's virtues, forgets its themes and gives us car chases instead hoping we would not notice the difference. This movie is Exhibit A in what gives Hollywood an undeservedly bad name.

Jerry Seinfeld, when commenting on why he had decided not to continue shooting Seinfeld, said that a performer must know when to gracefully bow out. That sometimes giving more, even when the audience asks for it, only takes away from the show you've just done.

Throughout the nineties, writer/director James Cameron (""The Terminator"" and ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"") touted numerous times that a third film would be on the way; however, never once were one of these proclamations followed by any substantial proof of a sequel actually being in the works. Finally, after many years of back and forth, the next installment in the series began production in 2002, but this time James Cameron was not involved, nor was actress Linda Hamilton who had portrayed Sarah Connor in the first two movies. Taking over for Cameron was director Jonathan Mostow (""U-571""), and with all the shifts within cast and crew some worried that perhaps Arnold would stick to his original statement that he would not return for ""T3"" if James Cameron didn't. For some reason, Arnold didn't stick to his guns, which was probably a fortunate decision for the sake of this film, and the actor was ready to take on his fellow machines once more, alongside Nick Stahl as John Connor (replacing Edward Furlong), in ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"".

""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" takes place approximately 10 years after the previous movie, and John Connor (Nick Stahl) is living out his life in fear that one day the dreaded events of the prophesied ""Judgment Day"" would still occur. Soon John begins to wonder if all his worries have been in vain, when a new threat from the future, a super-advanced Terminator identified simply as T-X (aka Terminatrix), arrives in the present day to eliminate all of the high ranking members of the human resistance before they are allowed to join forces against Skynet. Around this time, John encounters a former childhood friend named Kate Brewster (Claire Danes); however, this reunion could be cut short if the T-X has her way. To attempt to prevent the T-X's success, the resistance has once more sent back a Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) of their own assigned to protect all those on the T-X hit list before it's too late.

With so many difficulties plaguing this sequel prior to it beginning production in 2002, I'm sure many wondered if there was even a need to continue the series; especially with writer/director James Cameron opting out of the project. If the series' mastermind isn't willing to return for a third go-round, what possible good could come with pursuing the movie anyways? Apparently, this kind of logical thinking didn't enter into the minds of the people at Warner Brothers, and based on the final product of ""T3"" I would have to say that avoiding that kind of thinking paid off rather well for the most part.

Regarding James Cameron's replacement, Jonathan Mostow, he was given the unenviable job of following up two highly successful and extremely well-respected movies in the realm of sci-fi. Not to mention following behind arguably one of the best director's in modern cinema. I have to say that barring a few gripes, Mostow's ""T3"" holds up well, but does fall just a tad shy of its predecessors. Jonathan's previous film, the World War II submarine action/drama ""U-571"", most likely prepared him to handle large scale action sequences, and gripping drama that deals with the fate of many people's lives hanging in the balance. So, as far as replacements go, I think that Warner Brothers left the series in extremely capable hands.

Due to James Cameron not returning for this entry, two new writers were brought onboard to pen the script for Arnold's third outing as the leather-clad killing machine. Writers John Brancato (""The Net"") and Michael Ferris (""Catwoman"") co-wrote the screenplay borrowing heavily from other Terminator related sources, such as; the concepts of a female Terminator and Judgment Day being postponed from the novel T2: Infiltrator, and taking some cues from a previous script written by Tedi Serafian that included Sarah dying of cancer a few years after ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"". Even with the less-than original ideas, John and Michael still delivered a tight script that boasted plenty of fast-paced action, and finally pushed the series closer to the futuristic events that we have only seen glimpses of in the previous movies. One somewhat disappointing aspect to the story of ""T3"" is that the movie feels like there is less going on here than in the previous two films. The first movie was essentially this two hour cat-and-mouse game between the Terminator and Sarah and Reese; the second one had a similar feel, but also had so much other stuff going on that the film was just incredibly rich with storytelling. However, in this third movie the story, although solid, didn't seem to have as much drama and actual plot going on as the first two movies had, which may explain why the action sequences were bigger, and possibly more frequent in this movie than the previous ones.

One area of these films that has improved significantly from movie to movie is the visual effects. In the first movie, ""The Terminator"", the effects were good for their time, although incredibly dated by today's standards; in ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" the special effects were given a major boost by the advent of CGI. So, twelve years after the release of ""T2"", one can easily say the capabilities of today's visual effects wizards are nothing short of astonishing. Therefore, it really comes as no surprise that for ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" the numerous effects sequences were obviously the best in the series' history, but also were some of the best of the year 2003.

Lastly, the cast of ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" was mostly impressive, maintaining the high standards the series had held since it began back in 1984. Arnold Schwarzenegger (""The Terminator"" and ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"") was a surprise to me, because so much time had passed since his time as the Terminator that I wondered if he could physically get back in shape for the role at his age, and with his interest in politics beginning to eat up more of his time. Surprisingly, Arnold pulled it all off, and aside from a few possible extra wrinkles he appeared to look virtually the same as he had back in 1991, which served the continuity of the series very well I might add. From an acting standpoint, after two previous movies, I believe Arnold knows this character inside and out, so for him there wasn't anything new to work with, most likely he just wanted to do it for the fans of the series. Plus, what would a Terminator movie be without Arnold somewhere in sight? Regarding the remainder of the cast, Claire Danes was a good choice for Kate Brewster, John's childhood friend, she brought a kind of toughness and a slight leadership quality that somewhat made up for the absence of Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor. Newcomer Kristanna Loken (""Bloodrayne"") was a nice addition as the lethal femme fatale model of Terminator known as T-X or Terminatrix as she was sometimes referred; and she is easily the most dangerous, and attractive, of all the Terminator villains we've seen so far.

Out of the entire cast I only had one problem with one of the main members, and by this time you have probably figured out who I'm talking about, by looking at whom I haven't discussed yet. You guessed it, actor Nick Stahl (""Sin City"") as John Connor was a major problem for me in this movie. As an actor I think Nick has done a good job in the various roles I have seen him in over the years; however, I for one don't believe he was a great choice to play John this close to the period in his life where he may possibly be called upon to lead humanity in its darkest hours. I thought that Nick made John seem far too whiny with his whole poor pitiful me routine that he kept using over and over throughout the movie. I kind of felt like for the future leader of mankind, I sure wouldn't follow this loser into battle; honestly, he kind of seemed like Anakin Skywalker in ""Star Wars - Episode II: Attack of the Clones"", where he was constantly whining about Obi-Wan and the council holding him back from greatness. The difference being, here John wasn't seeking greatness, he just wanted to runaway and hide somewhere like a coward; although I must admit that around the midpoint of the movie, John does take a more proactive stance and begins to show signs that perhaps the leader that has been prophesied about may yet exist.

After watching all three Terminator films back-to-back over an incredibly fun Saturday, I have to say that while ""T3"" is still a highly entertaining entry into the series; it is the weakest one out of the three. The story is fast-paced, but feels at times to be a little weaker due to not nearly as much going on as there was in ""T2""; the action sequences were fun and on occasion were flat-out impressive to watch, and of course the visual effects were the best in the series. However, the slightly weaker story, coupled with a questionable performance from Nick Stahl as a semi-weak acting John Connor, and a few possible continuity errors between this movie and the previous ones made ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" not quite as good as either of the previous films in the series.

The gags weren't half as bad as I expected them to be and those little moments of comic relief were necessary, 'cause the rest of the film was pretty damn serious.  It's a very good continuation of the Terminator story and it's a brilliant movie when you keep in mind that it's part 3!  Yes, this film is a bit different. Not that much different. Did I miss Linda Hamilton? No. Did I miss Edward Furlong? Hell, no! Did I miss James Cameron? - Hm, there's a certain emotional factor that Cameron would have inserted during the whole film, instead of just the ending.  Anyway, especially for a follow up of an all time classic, I will give it 10 / 10 stars.  There's one major plot hole ... but you can ignore that easily.  Go watch it.

There is ton of action and the story really advances the mythology as John meets the person who will eventually teach him how to lead the human resistance.

The opening storyline of the movie is also very interesting when the new Terminator, the T-X, targets John's future lieutenants. The T-X is a very cool new Terminator and is more advanced than the T-1000. Arnold is awesome as always, the best line has to be when he asks the male stripper to take his clothes off.

He is adolescent, but he knows how to drive. With his first hand he holds the steering wheel, another seeks a weapon, with the third, he defends himself, the fourth shuts up his future (who does not know) wife and finally, with his fifth, he passes the speeds. He dramatically lacks a sixth hand to wipe his nose, since the action is so exciting!

In Terminator 2, the evil robot machine was a man. In the third the robot is ... a woman. To help the viewer understand that this is indeed a nasty woman, she is blonde (you will notice that 9 times out of 10 in American cinema, perverse women - those who turn good husbands into sexual bests as in Basic Instinct - neurotic killer and female traitors are blondes. That is a point to clarify ...). And she does not smile. My mother smiled to me, she is nice. A woman who does not smile, is a priori evil. This is the second index. Then, we understand that she is robot as she inflates her chest! Please laugh as it is the only funny moment of the film.

Then, Bozo is seeking, is being himself tracked to be killed. Cascades, lots of smoke, lots of flames ... big pollution that help the Universe understand why Bush refused to sign the Kyoto Protocol on the environment ... What a crazy consumption of oxygen! The (future) step-father of Bozo made a mistake by releasing the anti-virus computer in the pipes that control the world (we are the United States of America, not the Lichtenstein! therefore above of the World). The machines revolt. Nuclear war is ahead. In a last rattle the good step-father who is commander-in-chief asks his son-in-law and daughter to flee in order to take refuge in a bunker to save, nothing less than the Humanity. But there is a last problem to be solved ... they must kill the evil ""robot"". Well, then ... the computers are too old to be operated! A phone call coming from... an admiral or a general or an arch-duke or a opera dancer... who calls for aid and is happy to fall on Bozo who will certainly become the head of the resistance.

1473034,5,B00005JM0B,"Nick Stahl's portrayal of John Connor in my opinion defined the character, and Claire Danes was also excellent in the movie as his soon-to-be wife. Of all the Terminator movies, i felt that this movie devoted more time to character development and story building than the prior films, which is good because the series has a philosophical component which a lot of people for some reason overlook. Although the movies are best known as action films, they are also the story of mankind's savior- a person who knows he is destined to be a great leader for his people but who doesn't want the role. Nick Stahl brings that story to life in this movie. It's a story which beyond being entertaining is also worthwhile because it has parallels throughout history. Most of the great leaders we remember in history rose to their roles in the midst of a crisis. The most noble minded of those leaders resented their role as a leader because they resented the crisis that propelled them into that role. This movie takes that story and brings it into a science fiction format, along with bringing a message that people should be careful how much trust they place in technology as we move into a digital age where more and more of our lives revolve around computers. That message along with John Connor's storyline make this movie very compelling. I don't understand why Terminator 4 is said to have cast a different actor in the leading role.

Arnold is back here in his likely last appearance as a terminator from the future, and, despite the years that have passed since the first outing, he looks very much the same, as he should.

*Lots of great action and special effects.  It's hardly ever dull.

*Characters are not bad.
*The Terminatrix is an excellent enemy.  I like the fact that she combines the best of all previous terminators; it's a very systematic solution.
*Music is not bad.

The Bad Things
*Not as many memorable lines.
*Some things in the franchise have become convuluted.  This film introduced certain elements (like John Connor having a wife) that probably should have been left out.
*John Connor's character is weakened.  And now that I've seen ""Carnivale,"" I will probably always look at the actor Nick Stahl as a reluctant farm boy instead of the future leader of the resistance.

I never expected this film to have any more action than T2, but I was ultimately surprised as to how much there was.  The first half had loads of great scenes, including one of the coolest car chases I've ever seen.  The Terminatrix impressed me as well.  The film had a fair amount of both drama and comedy.

1473075,3,B00005JM0B,"It has been said that a second movie in a series is never as good as the first and that it usually ends up being the worst. In this series, that has proven to be the opposite of what has happened. While the first film was the most imaginative, the second used that as a jumping point and added some spectacular effects and action. This movie attempts to do the same and fails.

For those who have been cave dwellers for a while, the terminator is a robot from the future sent back in time to kill John Connors, the man who will one day lead a rebel revolt against the machines of the future. So much for movie one.

Movie two had a second more advanced robot come back to kill Connors but also a copy of the original robot come back programmed by Connors to save himself. Movie two.

This time around, Connor's mother has passed away and he is on his own, trying to do his best not to get caught up in anything that might change the future and result in his having to be the savior of the world. Yeah, like that's gonna happen.

A new terminator, the T-X (Kristanna Loken) is sent back in time by the robots of the future to destroy not only John Connors (this time portrayed by Nick Stahl) but those who will become his staff as well when the final battle comes. The T-X gets a good start on this killing off a few when she encounters John along with one time friend Kate Brewster (Claire Danes). With two for the price of one in her sights, she attacks.

Too bad that Connors sent back another terminator to prevent this from happening. Yes, it's the old model played by Arnold Schwarzenegger that comes to help. But he is obviously no match for the updated model sent to kill and destroy.

As Connors and Brewster get reacquainted with one another while on the run, the Hollywood stuntman's association garners a major paycheck as tons of automobiles are blown to bits and stunt men dresses as Arnold are slammed through various buildings. This movie is more about action and explosions than any real science fiction.

No one wonders why it is that robots keep being sent back which means that the future never changed after all. If it had, why are they here now? And the reason they came about explained in the second film is given little validity if there is another way that the future could have yielded these monstrous machines.

The acing is...well....who really knows since acting is not the reason to watch this movie. It does look well made, I'll give it credit for that. But it is one of the most hollow films I have seen I a long time. While I cared about Connors as well as his robot protector in the second film, I found myself not giving a hoot for anyone here. Rather than being thrilled and awed, I was bored.

A sequel, to be a good one, should cover new ground and take us somewhere just a little bit different. This movie is a rehash of the last one without new dazzling effects or enough emotion to ring us in. It substitutes roaring explosions for the matters of the heart that made us enjoy the last film.

One had to hope that with this film the franchise would die. But it didn't as the release of the new television series proved. Even the surprise ending was one that didn't really matter much by the time it was revealed. If you are a die hard fan, by all means watch.

BTW, what is it with Arnold and the sunlasses?

Have you noticed how we/Hollywood anthromorphize the robots so that they have two eyes in their head?  Why not more eyes.?

Anyhow this movie begs at least two thing:

1) a fourth movie ( well, FOX  is coming out with a TV series so maybe that's the plan.
2) A trilogy or quadrilogy set of DVD's like Alien

The problem with Terminator 3 is that the first two set the bar so high that it fails as a successor in the franchise. The plot is a rehash of the second one, the female Terminator is a joke (although nice to look at, plot holes abound, and it just so feels so ...  underwhelming.

Of course, the first two are legendary so expectations are high. Once Fox has danced all over the grave of quality with The Terminator Chronicles being released soon, maybe T3 will look like the best movie of the decade.",1197072000,,747,4.518518518518518

My friends dad also decided to go and T3, they are both fans of the first two. After I had seen multiple negative reviews on this film I didn't expect to much, but once I heard it compares to ""Jurassic Park III"" (which I greatly enjoyed) I decided I might like the film. After finishing ""Meet the Robinsons"" the younger kids were put to bed and we started watching T3, hopefully to enjoy it, and enjoy it I did. I personally enjoyed the films action sequences and story, which I felt was intense and carried out fairly well. My friend and his dad also enjoyed the film, they agreed it didn't match the first two but that it was still a good film. This being the first ""Terminator"" movie I had seen I didn't know what to expect, I believed this helped me. Too many people compared this to the first two films and excpected it to be the same, but it wasn't, it was actually a fairly good film, just not quite as good as (apparently) the first two fantastic films. Because I had not seen the other two, I was able to see this one as a film and not just a stack up to the first two, thus I honestly believe it was a fairly good film. The female Terminator (T-1000) was a truly terrifying and brutal machine, the girl scared me half to death! You had know idea where she was gonna jump out from, and the fact that she brutally killed people, each in various different ways (a.k.a, punching her arm through them, killing them with buzzsaws, or just plain out shooting them) was a truly scary concept that was carried out fairly well. The acting itself wasn't a perfect gem, but it carried the story like it needed to and there was no particular flaw in the acting.

7.5/10  Very Good action film, see it.

NOTE: After rewatching the film, it came to my attention that Kristanna Loken's acting culd have been much, much better, it just felt a bit corny. It didn't have the natural coldness that it should have had, it seemed to be a actress 'trying' to look cold. It could have worked better, didn't wreck the movie, but didn't give anything to it either.

NOTE 2: After seeing the first two films, I can see why some fans where a bit dissappointed. Though a do beleive they over-reacted a very good bit, I will agree it lacked the depth and a feeling that compelled you that were present in at least the second film.",1196121600,,2471,4.284796573875803
1473119,3,B00005JM0B,"I did not see the film in the theater after hearing many of the people involved in the first two films were not on this production.

I did not have great expectations but I will say the film is good for a DVD viewing rather then theater prices.

The theme of man vs machine is still at play.  It was interesting in the beginning but we know it now and it felt like space filler as there isn't an effort to expand and give it greater detail.  I probably would have liked it more if there were future scenes versus the quick dialog explaining what happened in the future. This suprised me on reflection as there is an effort into the FX aspects of the film.

Arnold does a good job for the script he had.  I will say that he does a really good dead pan.  However, the several injections of humor seemed to take away from the killing machine we all knew.

I did not care for Nick Stahl portrayal as John Conner.  I think they were trying to portray him as tormented but it came across as weak.  Not at all the future leader of the resistance.

I forgot Claire Danes was in this and was surprised to see her.  Overall not a bad job for this type of genra.

Kristanna Loken does a good job as T-X but in the back of my mind it was T-1000 as an attractive woman with the ability to turn her hand into an Energy weapon and a flame thrower.  The T-1000 thought happened after a bit of luck she finds out Conner is around and starts chasing him when she was originally sent back to terminate Conner's future Lieutenants.

I think I would have liked it better seeing Conner remain unknown running around trying to save his future lieutenants.

Overall the film is ok.  I admit I am probably not going to watch it much as it doesn't interest me but I would say hard fans of the series might like it as it does continue the storyline.

I agree that it does create a contradiction (if the future is predetermined, how come Judgment Day was delayed by six years?) that would need Larry Fishbourne-style philosophical psychobabble to explain.

That said, the film does get many things right.  The directing is top-notch, and casting is great.  I never liked Edward Furlong too much in T2, and it was a relief to see that the new guy was up to the job.  The love interest was good, with the appropriate mix of humanity and steel.  The T-X was outstanding, both the actress and the concept, although she broke little new ground.

Well, to be clear, the cockroaches show up naked as well, but without the little glowing ball of energy.) The point is, humanity's loss is our gain, as Terminator 3 offers another chance for Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger to show off his prodigious acting chops [i.e., his pecs]. Kristanna Loken co-stars as the ruthless Termanatrix, a superior model of robot with, I think you'll agree, a superior bare backside, altogether less hairy, not nearly as Austrian, with smooth, clean lines and a... anyway, back to the synopsis.

Arnold must protect John Connor (Nick Stahl) not only from the Terminatrix, but also, because the kid is a supremely annoying presence, from all those who want to slap him, and that encompasses everyone who has ever met him. Things get complicated when a whiny young irritant named Kate (Claire Danes) locks John into an unhygienic dog kennel and refuses to even worm him.

The second DVD in the compilation profiles Stan Winston, visual effects director, and his talented staff as they explain the many ""tricks"" of the trade in the making of this movie.

Though it might be a bit disconcerting to discover the process behind ""movie magic,"" just revelations are informative to those that are really into the technical aspects of filmmaking.

Much of this repeats stuff you've already seen in T1 & T2, but tamer as they clearly want to keep the rating as low as possible. Scenes that went over well in the first two get recycled almost unchanged in three, it's depressingly derivative.

1473181,3,B00005JM0B,"As with the years that passed between the first and second films, the speculation as to wether or not a third film was going to happen at all was very high. We all heard the conflicting statements of both Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Cameron. Finally Cameron said he would do it if 20th Century Fox would release it. Obviously that didn't happen and Arnold changed his mind after saying No.

The story of T3 is mediocre to average at best and I'll tell you why. To begin with, a lot of necessary exposition is missing. The writers essentially left out a major plot point with the former Cyberdyne Systems and Miles Dyson. Having a situation where Dyson designs Skynet's hardware and Brewster designs the software would have tied T3 a lot more strongly to the franchise. Another thing is what happens to Sarah Connor. This character has basically been the pennacle of the Terminator mythos. If the reigns have to pass from Sarah to John that's fine. But it would have worked better that we see her killed trying to escape after Skynet comes online.

Lastly the concept of The Terminatrix. Now just to be clear, I don't mind a woman being a Terminator. What I do have a problem with is the writers splitting hairs trying to differentiate the T-X from the T-1000. Now we could all see the difference between Arnold and the T-1000. But if the best they can do is showing the T-X endo during a copy, then that won't cut it. There are ways to come up with new concepts on something established. Maybe that's where Cameron could have worked some magic.

The only two things that worked for me were Arnold's description of what will happen in the future in terms of the war, and the ending surprised me though. It set up the fourth film pretty well. The missing elements Cameron's nightmarish vision and storytelling smoothness are what crippled this film. Not bad, but could have been better.",1176940800,2,1888,4.629850746268657

Paid her more, given her more incentives or just written in a heroic role to which she couldn't have said no. Claire Danes is NOT an action star and, while I think she did okay in the role of action star, the movie was handicapped by her whiney presence along with that of the new ""John Connor.""

What I really hated was how the ""Good"" Terminator character got sent back... or should I say WHO sent him back. The circumstances surrounding it, etc. I really felt, as I said, cheated by so many things in this movie. It leaves you with a very hopeless feeling of the future, unlike T2 in which the viewer was left feeling incomplete but perhaps in a more positive frame of mind.

1473260,1,B00005JM0B,"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (Jonathan Mostow, 2003)

Okay, raise your hands: how many people didn't see this movie crashing and burning when a director other than James Cameron-- despite his dismal track record since 1996-- was attached to it? (And let's face it, Terminator 2 wasn't exactly gangbusters, either.) Still, the fact that twelve years elapsed between the second and third movies lent a minor air of credibility to it. Incorrectly, of course, but there you go.

As the title tells you, this is the story of how the machines took over the world. In other words, the very title of the film is a spoiler, since the machines take over the world, yes, in the very last scene of the film (after Arnie once again does his level best to save the world). This is pre-apocalypse John Connor (Carnivale's Nick Stahl), who begins the film as a bum, more or less. We are almost immediately introduced to Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), the woman who will, obviously, be his saving grace. This isn't a spoiler; the movie's about as hard to figure out as a four-piece jigsaw puzzle with three pieces already put into place. And, of course, there's Arnie, the good guy, and Kristanna Loken, the bad guy-- uh, girl. Gotta wonder how Arnie keeps getting crushed, melted, and elected Governor of California, but they can keep sending him back to mess with the Connor family, don't you?

In any case, things blow up, people run from terminators, people get killed by terminators, you know the drill. But, unlike the brilliant first film, and even the mediocre second, T3 manages to studiously avoid anything approaching characterization. We are given no reason to care about these characters, no suspense to make us wonder whether they'll rise to the occasion, not even a decent script for the actors to work with.

1473265,4,B00005JM0B,"I'm probably going to lose instant credibility by saying this, but I think that T3 is the best in the series. Yes, T2 and the original are brilliant but T3 is simply all action from start to finish. It's a breathless, relentless thrill-ride that doesn't let up until the shocking, refreshingly downbeat climax.

Nick Stahl easily steps into the role of John Connor, vacated by Eddie Furlong and surpasses him in terms of acting and character development. T3 takes place over a couple of days but the actors still get enough out of the sudden, fast-paced plot developments to prevent them from simply being furniture. I was surprised at how emotional and engaging Nick Stahl's performance was as I had previously thought he was totally inappropriate for the part.

T3 has Connor as some sort of Ronin type character, living separate from the rest of humanity, paranoid that Skynet may be able to track his footsteps in the future and send a Terminator to kill him. He knows he destroyed Cyberdyne and everything SHOULD be okay, but something else just stops him from keeping in touch with the world. Plus Sarah Connor is dead, leaving a John alone in an unstable time.

Computer networks are failing across the planet and there seems to be a giant ghost in the machine. Everyone seems oblivious to the brewing trouble until the T-X and the T-800 step out of the time displacement field, hellbent on blowing each other and the city to smithereens.

Amazing special effects, stunt work, and non-obnoxious CGI make up the rest of the movie, which is essentially one huge chase. I found it to be pretty seamless when I first saw it but upon repeat viewings you can tell what's fake and what's not. But only if you look really hard. T3 uses its effects to make a good movie, not a video game cut-scene. Something that so many shallow effects movies do.

Of course there are problems. As always in a film with such a white-knuckle momentum, plot coherence is sacrificed for timing. Why are Kate Brewster and her boyfriend shopping in the middle of the night? How on Earth would Connor's Lieutenants have survived Judgment Day when they clearly live in the middle of LA and would have been fried to a crisp? There are also some continuity problems with the first 2 movies not the least of which are the wildly incorrect character ages. But even James Cameron himself didn't define this too clearly in T2. And why is Arnie's Terminator model now called a T-101? He's a T-800: Cyberdyne Systems Model 101. A couple of quick exposition scenes could have made all this nice and neat. But they couldn't be bothered I guess. This is probably why so many fans of Cameron's entries turned their noses up that T3. I suspect that many of these complaints WERE actually detailed but cut from the film.

Terminator ends here as far as I am concerned. The 2009 T4 from McG was a travesty, and the TV series was almost unwatchable. Arnie was 55 when he shot this film, and looks very good for his age. Though it was, and will likely remain, his last true hit as a headlining actor.

Will artificial intelligence ever reach a point were it becomes self aware? Its a very interesting question and I think that is one of the reasons why it has been so successful as a series. This is also one of the only trilogys that I feel still has alot of potential for future movies. I think we really need a terminator film that is actually set in the future where the terminators live and with the recent announcment of T4 most likly being made, hopefully we will get just that.

As for T3, it is without a doubt the worst film of the 3 but with that being said I still really enjoyed this film. Alot of the people that disliked it did so because they said it went back on everything that was established in T2. I am not one of these people and I really like the aspect of this film that turned around and said Judgement day is inevitable. Its without a doubt the single best twist to this entire story in my opinion because in reality it really is. Technology will continue to drive forward with computers getting better and better and no matter what you do to stop it, someone else will pop up and continue the research and development. Its basically where we are today with technology. There is no stopping the advancment that we see taking place on almost a daily basis. If one company were to stop develpment in a certain area, someone else would just pop up and take that companies or persons place.

Anyways that is really why I liked this film so much. It took the series in a completly new direction by stating that there was no way to stop it while the first two movies focused on what to do to actually stop it. With that being said this movie had its flaws and it just isn't on the same level that T1 & T2 are on. Its still a highly entertaining action film with some great performances and a great ending that perfectly sets up the Terminator film that I am dying to see, the one set in the wasteland of the future. Hats off to Arnold as well who really busted his butt to get into killer shape for this film so he wouldnt look any different than he did during the first 2 films. He pulled it off without a hitch. Just another testament to that guys ability to work his body and get into killer shape.

Anyways on to the HD-DVD...

There were a few people on the HD forums that were disappointed in this transfer as it didn't show the amount of detail that some of the better transfers have shown. While it is true that this transfer doesnt have the detail present in some of the other transfers like Aeon Flux, Batman Begins and Sahara, it is still a great looking film and a big improvment overthe SD version. One of the thing you have to take into account is the fact that certain films just translate over to HD with much better results than others do. T3 was shot using Super35 and to sum up the Super35 process, it doesnt use as much area on the negative that regular anamorphic does thus you have a slight loss of detail compared to those that use standard anamorphic. With Super35 you also have to make intermediate prints to get the transfer onto a film that can be used in theatres. Everytime you make an intermediate print you lose resolution and detail. So to sum it up as I really don't want to get into a big technical discussion on Super35 and the other film processes. Super35 just does not have the image quality that regular anamorphic does period. T3 is a super35 film thus when you transfer the t3 film onto HD it just isn't going to look as sharp as a lot of the other films that aren't Super35. Some of the main characteristics of Super35 are increased grain and less detail, both which are present in the HD transfer of T3.

With that being said, T3 still looks great and is a vast improvment over the SD version. I am actually a fan of increased graain as long as it doesnt look noisy which in this case it doesnt. It adds a disticnt look to the film. As much as some people would love for every film to look like the Batman Begins of Aeon Flux transfer, its just a bad idea. To make evey film look the same would be like taking all of the artistic possibilites of film and throwing them down the toilet. Its good that films look different because it would be a very boring world of cinema if everything looked the same. Just image what Tim Burtons Sleepy Hollow would look like if he used the same film and process used for Batman Begins. It would have absolutly destroyed the film and would have taken all of the spooky atmoshpere away. He purposly used cross processing to make all of the colors washed out and to make it more grainy and more contrasty. That film also looks great on HD-DVD but like T3 doesnt have a transfer that shows as much detail as some of the other transfers.

The sooner everyone relaizes that not every film is supposed to have incredible detail, vivid colors, & natural contrast. Films differ by the processes used to make the film and those differences in process equate to a difference in characteristics in a HD transfer. You have to educate yourself on just what processes were used for each particular film and only then can you make an educated critique of a particular films HD transfer.

To sum this up, T3 is certainly not a disc you want to pop in when your trying to show someone just how much detail can be seen in a HD movie. It was filmed in Super35 thus it was never trying to be a film that had a crazy amount of detail in the print. With that being said, T3 is a great transfer that is accurate to its master print. Its a big improvment over the SD version and its a great film which hopefully leads the series to a 4th film which is set in the future. I know I won't ever be done with the idea of a new Terminator flick until that particular story has been told. Here is to hoping they get around to making that happen.

1473329,1,B00005JM0B,"T3 is not meant to be this crap. It should be better than the last 2 not worse. The plot is brainless and does not explain anything except ""Cripky's Basement"" which means nothing to me or any other viewer. Arnie's acting was weak and so was everyone elses on this movie. Why create a blend Terminator with inter-metal-skeleton and liquid metal on the outside ? More types of Terminators do not have to be created to make a good sequel. How about a new plot or maybe just a plot to start with.

This is nothing but a rehash of T2 and a crap one at that.

T1 was dark and mysterious with brilliant music and ideas, T2 was action packed from start to finish with an excellent plot making it a perfect sequel and finale...but T3 is nothing but a try hard copy of T2 with try hard humour and too much focus on ""Cripky's Basement"" (that was the most annoying subject in the whole movie).

Also, Arnie talks too much on T3.

I could write a better story for T3 in one hour if I had to.

How about this idea:

John Connor dies in the future (he was killed by a Terminator he was trying to capture). A close friend of John's teleports himself back in time to save John from being terminated (he couldn't send a terminator because only John Connor knows how to catch them). John must be saved as he is the only hope for the resistance ! So this close friend, let's call him Bob...goes back to the time when John was still alive to warn him of how he will die so he can prevent it and Bob will help John stay alive and destroy any termintors that attack while John tries to capture as many terminators as possible to use against Skynet. John gets killed again so Bob Sends a Terminator to protect John and help him capture more Terminators as they already have one. The Terminator and John are very successful in capturing lots of T-101's with help from the captured ones as they get more. Once they have a vast army of T-101's John sends them to attack Skynet all at once using a stealthy attack which has been programmed into their processors by one of John's friends. Sky net gets weak and finally ceases to exist.

At the end John doesn't destroy his army of T-101's even though Skynet is no more, but he keeps them for protection incase Skynet was not completely destroyed. John and all the people are safe now from attacks by Skynet.....but have Skynet sent Terminators into the future before they ceased ? .....Find out in T4.",1160092800,7,2422,4.333333333333333
1473330,1,B00005JM0B,"The sequel that should have never been. This movie lacks everything that James Cameron put into Terminator 2....plot development, charachter development, and somethign that makes you actually give a damn about the charachters. Both Furlong and Hamilton refused the parts unles Cameron directed it which was a very wise move.
  first, the story: Terminator 2 made it very clear that the ranchise was over....Bison was killed by swat officers, Skynet was destroyed, and the chip and the arm along with the terminator was also destroyed. No explanation during Terminator 3 was given to let the viewer know why judgement day has not been avoided.. it was just ""postponed"".
  The charachters: there was nothing in this movie that had you caring about the charachters. Arnolds acting was subpar compared to T2...where you actually believed he was a machine because of the way he spoke.

Here is how I would have done it:

T3 would be a prequel to T1 where they have the battle of the machines, conners role as a general in that battle, and so on. throw in the typical protaganist/hero struggle, and end the film with the terminator and Kyle Reese (?) being sent back to 1984. It would have been much more plausable then this film.

ugh...BAD",1160006400,5,1235,4.852380952380952
1473331,5,B00005JM0B,"This film is basically a repetition of ""Terminator 2"". Two terminators fight over the protection or destruction of John Conner. Only, this time one of the terminators is a female (terminatrix). I perfectly enjoyed the terminatrix character, because she is very sexy. Also, I noticed some similarity to the nuclear threat from the ""War Games"" movie.

I was hoping that in this episode, the machines will take over the world. I envisioned a post-apocalyptic society where robots dominate over humans and use them as slave labor. But it didn't happen. May be it will happen in a sequel - ""Terminator 4""? Because the final sentences are open-ended: ""Never stop fighting. The battle has just began"". Perhaps we (the viewers) should send an letter to Jonathan Mostow and James Cameron, explaining we would like to see in an eventual T4 episode. In my opinion, John Conner's nightmare with the no-skin, skeleton-like terminators should be developed into a full episode, not just briefly flashed for a few seconds in the beginning of the T2 and T3 episodes. I prefer to see robots rather than car chasings. The T3 episode has so many vehicles in it, that the movie feels as if it were ""Rise of the cars and trucks"".

Other than that, the special effects are dazzling. The female terminatrix is so beautiful, that no matter what she does, she is not scary, but remains rather attractive. And Arnold still looks in excellent shape, I think. The director J. Mostow did a perfect job and you couldn't tell Mostow's episode from Cameron's, if you didn't know ahead of time who was the director.

So, this movie deserves a full 5 star rating, and let's hope that the ""franchise"" of terminator movies does not end here.

P.S. Watch this movie early in the morning, so that in the evening you can sleep well. With so many explosions, shootings and fights, if you see it just before bedtime, it will be hard for you to fall asleep, in my humble opinion.",1159142400,2,1936,4.735905044510385
1473332,3,B00005JM0B,"This film was highly anticipated by many, including myself. I came away from it feeling just blah. Was it terrible? I don't think so, but it did not live up to any potential it had. The biggest flaw of the film is that it remakes Terminator 2 just like T2 remade T1. Cameron had good reason to expand his vision with a massive budget and bravura special-effects but he never forgot that his chase movie was a story about a mother and son and a father figure, personified by Arnold, at it's heart.

What exactly is at the heart of Jonathan Mostow's Terminator 3? It can't be the same regurgitated son and surrogate father thing, can it? I think not. Is it the burgeoning relationship with the Claire Danes character? Nope. Then, what the hell is it? I guess it's about fate and how it is actually set in stone and that no matter what the hell you do, you cannot out smart or defeat destiny. This message contradicts the message of the previous film rather blatantly, which stated that we really are the determining factor of our own respective futures.

So, in T3 you get a bunch of nonsense, a female terminator for one, who looks like a runway model. The whole convoluted Skynet sub-plot, the aging Arnold going through his old routine but now with absurd, over the top emotional scenes! The Claire Danes character standing in as the tough female for Linda Hamilton, who wanted nothing to do with this movie. The recycled chase sequences straight out of Terminator 2 and so on. Even with all those negatives, I have to hand it to Mostow for not chickening out in the end, Judgement Day happens, finally! I'm happy we won't have to watch Terminator 4 following the same exact plot-line as all the other films. Then again, it is Hollywood, so who knows? Hehehe...

This 2-Disc DVD of the movie is average, with some limited special features, not even a decent documentary on the film, only a cheap HBO making of special. The DVD is certainly not a standout by any measure. You want a standout DVD? Check out the T2: Ultimate Edition, that is one slick puppy but if you're a Terminator fan, you definitely own that by now.",1156896000,5,2120,4.530026109660574

1473384,4,B00005JM0B,"OK OK OK, with James Cameron, Linda Hamilton AND Eddie Furlong missing along with a 99 year old Arnold Schwarzenegger, there was no way this movie was going to live up to T1 or T2.  I was disappointed when I first saw T3 in the theatres.  It definitely lacks the heart of the first two.  But still, I added the DVD to my collection to complete the trilogy.  I've watched this movie several times over the years, and I can honestly say it's a pretty decent if not good entry to the series.

This movie follows John Connor as a young adult with the impending Judgement Day just hours away.  The acting, action and effects are above average.  Arnold gives one of his better performances in the last 10 years.  Claire Danes delivers as always.  Some people here complain that the actor who plays John Connor was too wimpy....C'MON John Connor was a regular guy who didn't want to accept his destiny, he wasn't supposed to be Rambo.

The movie actually manages to hold the continuity of the first two.  The audience gets to see how the machines come to power and we even see images of the original terminators (versions earlier than Arnold's from the first movie).  I give the movie an extra star just for having the guts to end the way it does.  I'd even be looking forward to seeing Part 4 just to see how the story continues.

Like I said, Rise of the Machines doesn't really compare to the first two, but I'd take T3 over Godfather III, Scream 3 or the third Matrix any day.",1154908800,2,1473,4.387453874538745
1473385,2,B00005JM0B,"I found this movie to be a big disappointment.  For the first time in a terminator film, I felt bored for about the first 20-30 minutes.  Terminator 3 certainly has a much different feel to it.  It seemed to be a semi-comedy with some action thrown in there so it might resemble a terminator film.  The great music from the first two films that gave the terminator series a feeling of darkness?  That's been thrown out, despite the fact that it worked so well before.  And what about the comedy?  Well, if you think lines like ""We need a new vehicle"" and ""She'll be back"" are funny, then this film might be for you.  However, I didn't hear much laughing when I saw it in the theater.

Another thing I felt for the first time was annoyance.  I was very shocked and disappointed at how weak John Conner was.  Throughout the film he spends a lot of time whining, running, and saying dumb things.  For example, at one point in the film Conner whines because he has to teach the T-101 everything all over again.  Well, duh.  Like Arnold's character said, that was a different terminator.  Another example is when Conner sticks a gun to his head and threatens to kill himself.  Dumb, dumb, dumb.  Moreover, Conner is poorly educated.  I don't even think he possess a high school education.  He does, however, manage to get himself locked in a cage.  I don't know about you, but I wouldn't want someone like him to be a world leader.  Some people might think that it's okay for Conner to be a regular guy, but they're missing the point.  He isn't supposed to be a regular guy.  He is supposed to be John Conner.  In any case, even if Conner was more like his father, or more like his mother in Terminator 2, I wouldn't complain about him as much.

Conner even looks like he could be a wimp.  He looks a bit too short and skinny.  In other words, Conner looks like he never even spent a day of his life in a gym.  I don't think he spends any time fighting in the film at all.  He just runs away and hopes that Arnold can protect him.  Throughout most of the movie, the woman he is interested him shows no interest in him.  If he struggles so much to impress a woman who isn't even attractive, I'm baffled as to how he could impress the rest of the world enough to become their leader.  As a result of all this, I think I'll just go with what Conner said in the film:  ""Look at me, I'm no leader, I never was, I'm never gonna be!""

I also had a problem with the villain in the film.  She didn't look frightening enough to be a villain.  In the first two terminator films, the T-101 and T-1000 looked like something a person would want to run away from.  In Terminator 3, the T-X looks like something that someone would want to go to bed with.  Some teenage boys might get a thrill out of seeing brief nudity on TV, but other than that, she adds nothing to the film.  This isn't an adult film, it's a terminator film.

There were a few other things I didn't like about the film.  I had a problem with some of the dumb coincidences.  For example, Kate Brewster turns out to be the daughter of the general who activates Skynet.  Uh, yeah.  And that adds what to the movie?  Also, a message that keeps getting repeated is ""It is inevitable.""  Why is it inevitable?  I also didn't like the part where Arnold is a good guy, then turns into a bad guy, then struggles for awhile before becoming a good guy again.  That makes the story less believable, and it looks dumb.  Another gripe I had is the film keeps making fun of the terminator series.  Even if the goal was to be funny, I thought that was unnecessary.  Terminator 2 added in some lines that were funny, and they didn't make fun of any characters or terminator movies.

Despite my low opinion of Terminator 3, it isn't the worst film ever.  Thus, I won't give it one star.  However, this film would be much better with some major changes made to it.  While there are some people who like Terminator 3, there are an awful lot of people who think it stinks, and many people who hate Terminator 3 love the first two films of the terminator series.  I don't think this should be ignored.  I don't like to give out ratings of three stars or more unless I'm pleased with the product.  I'm not pleased with Terminator 3.

If I wanted to destroy the terminator series, I probably would come up with a movie like this one, which makes fun of the terminator films without being funny.  Some people will say that it's hard to follow up Terminator 1 and 2, so I should be more lenient with number 3.  I disagree.  Before they even worked on this film, Mostow and the writers already had a lot of the story and a good number of characters to work with.  That's a lot easier than starting from scratch like Terminator 1 did.  Mostow could even copy a lot of things that worked in the first two movies, but he didn't even do that.  The bottom line is this movie has too many major flaws to ignore.

Then shoot the whole mess in someone's back yard without the spectacular special effects that made this series so watchable.

1473388,5,B00005JM0B,"Terminator (Arnold Swarzenegger) has lost none of his talent.  He is tough, funny (but not stupid) and likable.

John Conner (Nick Stahl) doesn't stand out in the film.  But I don't know whether that was necessary.  This is probably his biggest film, other than The Thin Red Line.  Not that I follow the box office ratings.

Claire Danes was great as Kate Brewster.  I thought she was great in the 1998 film Les Mis&eacute;rables.  In Terminator 3 she plays the role of the participant in ""reality"" who takes a bit of convincing that John Conner is telling the truth about the future.  It's a bit like Snuffleupagus' old role as imaginary friend on Sesame Street.  Don't worry, the convincing doesn't take too long this time (unlike Big Bird's human friends, who didn't believe Snuffleupagus existed until Sesame Street's 17th episode!)  Anyhow, I digress.  The accusations of delusions in Terminator 3 are nowhere near as severe as those received by Sarah Conner in Terminator 2.  In this, she is imprisoned in Pescadero State Hospital, a mental institution.

TX (Kristanna Loken) was great.  Detached, bloodthirsty and great in an action film.

1473392,4,B00005JM0B,"Hey, I was just as surprised as you when I found out there was going to be a third Terminator film released back in 2003 titled Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines...I was even more surprised that I enjoyed it as much as I did given the fact James Cameron, the man responsible for the previous two Terminator features, had nothing to do with this third film (apparently Arnold had reservations about being involved with the film without Cameron, to which Cameron recommended he go ahead and do it, but only if the filmmakers gave Arnold a whole lot of dough, which, apparently they did).  Directed by Jonathan Mostow (U-571), the film features Arnold Schwarzenegger (Terminator 2: Judgment Day, True Lies) in his last major film role before becoming elected governor of the state of California.  Also appearing is Nick Stahl (Bully, Sin City), Claire Danes (The Mod Squad, Shopgirl), David Andrews (Stealth), Kristanna Loken (BloodRayne), and Earl Boen (Marked for Death, Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult), the only actor, besides Arnold, to appear in all three Terminator features to date (his role here is minor compared to the previous two films).

The film picks up a number of years after the last feature as we see John Connor (Stahl), future leader and savior of the human race, in his mid twenties (I'd guess), living `off the grid' since the events from the last film (if you haven't seen the previous two films I don't know what the heck you're doing here, but whatever...).  Turns out `judgment day' was not averted, as initially thought at the end of the 2nd film, but only postponed, as Skynet is around in some form, as indicated by the arrival of a Terminator robot, a model T-X played by Loken.  It seems now the future is populated by really hot and sexy blonde robots with definite feminine characteristics...homina, homina...soon after we see another Terminator arrive, the muscled one we're more accustomed to, played by Arnold.  Seems the T-X model, or Terminatrix Bot has been sent back to target Connor, but if it can't get to him, it's supposed to go after those who would be his lieutenants, including that of Kate Brewster (Danes), whose father, played by Andrews, just happens to be some military bigwig in charge of the program which will eventually become Skynet, the artificial intelligence that will eventually take over the world, exterminating the human threat.  Make sense?  Probably not...anyway, given this new threat, someone from within the resistance from the future decided to send back an Arnold robot to protect whomever needed protecting, but its task a difficult one given the sophistication of the T-X model, which is essentially an enhanced logic weapons systems cybernetic combat infiltration unit with nanotechnological transjectors inside a titanium battle chassis surrounded by a mimetic poly alloy...whew!  So what does all that mean?  Well, it can manipulate machines under computer control, tap into communications systems, and produce weaponry from within, including a wicked plasma cannon from its arm, among other things.  Things aren't looking  so good for John (or the human race, for that matter), but did I mention the Terminatrix is really hot?

Given the fact Terminator 2 made as much as it did at the box office, I'm not surprised someone decided to continue on with the franchise, despite the fact the story had been pretty much wrapped up at the end of the second film.  Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines does try to fit itself within the continuity of the previous two films, and, on the surface it succeeds, but once you start picking at the loose threads, there are inconsistencies (then again, when we're talking about time travel, who's to say what could and couldn't happen?).  Now, I'm not going to go through and relate all the bits I thought out of place as I'm sure many have already done so, and done so a lot better than I could have, but I will say if you take this movie at face value (a straight up action film), you'll probably have a lot more fun.  There was one bit that really bothered me, though, and that was when John, Kate, and the Arnold Bot were trying to contact Kate's father, who just happened to be secured away in some top-secret military installation.  One minute they're driving towards the place and the next they're inside, talking to Kate's father...I suppose the Arnold Bot could have bypassed the security somehow, but it all seemed rather convenient, especially given the circumstances.  I did like the whole bit about a widespread virus running through the Internet, where it came from, and its ultimate purpose.  The characters in this film seemed to take a backseat to the action, as none are really developed as much as they were in the previous films.  Perhaps the filmmakers were relying on the character development already out there from the earlier films, but given so few characters carried over, this didn't work out so well.  One of the biggest weaknesses in the film, in my opinion, was that of Stahl's character of John Connor.  There seemed to be an awful lot of inconsistencies indicating perhaps this wasn't the same John Connor as was in the previous movie.  I'm not a big fan of Stahl (he reminds me too much of Giovanni Ribisi, whom I care even less for), but I thought he did pretty well in the film Sin City (2005).  As far as Danes, well, she looked good, but her performance was limited by her role, as it was written.  While the plot and the characters may have been half-baked, at least the action was balls out.  My favorite bit involved a car chase sequence featuring a gigantic crane truck barreling through city streets, causing massive amounts of destruction.  Another great bit was when the two Terminators were fighting each other within the military base, and the Arnold Bot uses a urinal as an offensive weapon.  The first time I saw this film and the ending was presented I found myself saying ""What the f***?"", but, after watching it again last night it did seem to make sense in terms of the story presented.  All in all I thought this a great action film, but in terms of a sequel to the Terminator series, it was so-so...I'd agree with Cameron that there really wasn't anything left to tell in the story, but if there's a chance to make money, you know Hollywood will capitalize.  By the way, I heard the script is finished for Terminator 4...no definitive word on who will appear...

The film, contained on the first DVD of this 2 DVD release, looks immaculate in anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1), and the Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround sound comes through most excellent.  The first DVD also features two commentary tracks, one with director Jonathan Mostow, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Nick Stahl, Claire Danes, and Kristanna Loken, the second with just director Jonathan Mostow, along with a theatrical trailer and a video game trailer.  The 2nd DVD has the bulk of the extras including an introduction from Schwarzenegger, a thirteen minute documentary, a funny scene that didn't make it into the film but indicates where the initial Terminator design may have come from, a three minute gag reel, a six part look inside the T3 visual effects lab, a Skynet database with character descriptions, web options, a Terminator timeline, storyboards, two featurettes titled Dressed to Kill (2:10) and Toys in Action (6:33), a PC game trailer, and a making of the video game featurette (8:53).

1473393,2,B00005JM0B,"This movie, from start to finish, is simply unbelievable. An android terminator (Arnold) is out to save John Connor and his new girlfriend (a boring premise after two previous movies with the same theme). According to the movie, John Connor will soon become the leader of a revolution against the machines controlling the future, while the new girlfriend will become his wife and assistant. Just like the first two movies, machines of the future send still another android terminator (played by Kristanna Loken) back in time to kill Connor and his girlfriend before they can start that revolution.

But, in this movie where the machines finally take over, John Connor doesn't display any evidence of the knowledge or skills necessary to lead such a revolution - and all those people screaming for help on the radio at the end of the movie are not going to sit around waiting patiently for him to develop those skills or knowledge. Indeed, in this movie, John Connor doesn't fight the androids - he runs from them (not exactly great creditials for a supposed leader). Since this aspect of the movie fails, the entire premise fails. And, without a solid premise, there's little remaining to this movie except an endless series of special effects fight scenes (most utterly unbelievable or just downright silly).

The actor chosen to play John Connor (Nick Stahl) looks like a throwback to the caveman period. Nobody in their right mind would be desperate enough to follow this Neandertal-looking charactor into a revolution (almost anyone would be a more substantial choice). They perhaps did, however, pick the perfect actor for the TX android terminator. Kristanna Loken, with her apparent fake [...] and layers of make-up, looks artificial enough to be fake skin over a machine frame. Arnold, on the other hand, is still a terrible actor.

All in all, there just isn't anything in this movie worth paying for.",1145318400,5,1910,4.981191222570533
1473433,4,B00005JM0B,"Yea, I only liked this movie because Kristanna Loken was in it... she's so f@#king HOT!!! Actually, it was an ok movie, but it doesnt hold a flame to T2. But hey... it's got Kristanna Loken... YEEEAAAHHH!!!",1145145600,2,206,4.594594594594595
1473434,1,B00005JM0B,"As a fan of the Terminator series, words cannot describe how disappointing this movie is. At its worst, its a pathetic parody of the previous Terminators which ignores almost every aspect of what made T1 & T2 so enthralling. They might as well make a sequel to Aliens in which the bio-mechanical horrors are transformed into cute little munchkins who spread rainbows and sunshine all over the world.

At it's best, its a chance to see Kristanna Loken in tight-fitting clothes. In fact, Lokens beauty seems to be the only redeeming aspect of T3, and I'm guessing they cast her as the nemesis to try and overlay the fact that the rest of the movie is a terrible travesty of mammoth proportions. Yes, she is very attractive, but you can stick a rare and beautiful flower on a steaming pile of crap and call it exquisite french nouveau cuisine, but nothing will take away from the fact that that it's still a steaming pile of crap with a pretty looking flower on top.

I could write pages upon pages of text on the topic of why every copy of this movie should be destroyed immediately, but I'll sum up the salient points instead :

1) The dialog is atrocious, e.g : ""John Conner"" appearing to be turned on by the fact that Brewster reminds him of his mother. Brewster telling off Conner ""What are you, some kind of GANG MEMBER? How do you live with yourself?!"" There's far more, but I'm afraid I've blocked most of it out. It's too terrible to attempt to comprehend it all at once.

2) The attempts at humor that were not in the least bit funny.

Some of the one-liners from the previous Terminators are recycled in T3, but this time around they fail to retain the cool and wry humor of the originals. What I found most disturbing was the ""Talk to the hand"" scene at the gas station with the stupid Funky Man song afterwards. What were they thinking?!

And the rest : The action-over-substance quality that dominates the entire movie. The fact that many aspects of the Terminator movies that preceded this one were ignored. The fact that a coherent plot is almost non existent. The fact that there is absolutely no originality to the movie. The fact that they actually spent $160 million on this trash.

I simply cannot proceed with writing anything else about this movie. I'm at a loss for words. If you will excuse me, I must now depart on a journey to bury my copy of T3 at a crossroad in the desert at midnight in the hopes that, by some miracle, Hollywood will Terminate-with-extreme-prejudice the scheduled 2008 release of Terminator 4.

My advice to you would be to ignore this trash and look back with fond memories on the previous Terminator movies, click your heels, and say 3 times ""There was no Terminator 3!""",1142294400,16,2717,4.541922290388548
1473435,2,B00005JM0B,"The action is so mechanical and extreme as to amount to a parody of the earlier films. Violent action is no substitute for a good story. Scenes with mechanical machines going wild are implausible. But they provide a car chase like you're never seen before. Could that truck have so much kinetic energy to do that much damage and keep on moving? NO, you would need a freight train. The petite young blond terminatrix seems like a match for the Terminator. (Is this some kind of feminist message or a retelling of Genesis?)

This film seems like a down-market version of the earlier films. The ""network down"" events suggest a fragility of modern life unknown in the past. The flight to the countryside reminds me of the actions of people during medieval plagues. When there is dialogue, as at the mausoleum, it is not first rate. ""Don't do that."" The special effects are certainly better than in the earlier films. The shape imitation in this film recalls the old horror films (like ""The Wolfman""). What is original about this film?

Next we learn that ""Judgment Day"" will occur in a few hours. Nuclear war will wipe out most people! There is a philosophical question in this film. Can the future affect the past? Orwell's ""1984"" said those who control the present control the future. But only in a fantasy can the future control the past. Those are just idealistic terms, the past is always gone. The present always determines the future, even if we don't understand how.",1141257600,5,1470,4.715953307392996

It was very entertaining and exciting - not a dull moment.  The story is similar to the first two terminator movies of course, but as a continuation was gripping and masterfully done.",1140998400,,324,4.732142857142857
1473437,2,B00005JM0B,"So here's the rundown. Machines will kill humans, but California's governor won't. Add yourself one particularly annoying machine disguised as an annoying chick, and you've got this movie.

Actually, it wasn't altogether a gag-flick (""Gag"" referring to a muscle spasm in the throat prior to vomiting, not a type of joke). Arnold's back again, and this time he's fighting a new terminator, and this one actually knocks off a few of its targets before being turned into pencil shavings. This new terminator is a lot like the one from Terminator 2, with all the liquid-metal junk, but as any chick-robot would do, this one only uses that power to look pretty. So how does she fight? One word: Accessories. Her right hand can do this cute little Transformer act and apparently turn into all sorts of weapons such as a flame thrower, a plasma cannon, and I'm sure a mascara brush is included in there somewhere. Arnold is back with his custom shotgun loaded with slugs (anyone who has played any FPS since Doom has to respect the value of such a weapon), and the humans use whatever they can to waste bullets ruining the chick-bot's makeup. Seriously, that's all she does.

So yeah, a bunch of stuff happens, some terribly animated lame puppet robots shoot people, and chick-bot dies in a major hissy fit. Don't believe me? Watch that robot die and just TELL me she isn't planning to spread all sorts of nasty rumors about the Arnold-bot to get back at him for blowing her up.

Action scenes were well enough done, especially a pretty cool car chase involving a crane. Gotta love that. Plot...well, I was glad for the ending of the movie, which nicely didn't end in a ""Hooray we saved the world again"" manner as I had suspected. The world does indeed get wasted, but we're gonna win in the end anyway as long as John Conner survives, or at least that's what they tell us. I think the writers thought to appeal to the 3 women in the audience by trying to pass it off as a love-story twist at the end, but come on...Chick-Bot didn't even get to go to the Princess' Slumber Party in Genovia. No girl would be fooled into liking a movie that didn't include that.

As for cast, well, no one in the world could ever be Terminator except Arnie, let's accept that as truth. John Conner is played by a rather weird-looking runty little guy, but he manages to do a decent show. Claire Danes somehow manages to co-star with him (or with Arnold, take your pick), and actually fires a gun once in the movie in an Avenge-my-Daddy's-Death chick-rage (similar to Princess Vespa's ""He shot my hair!"" rampage in Space Balls). And of course, Chick-bot is played by some chick that a few men might consider to be hot. Apparently the director did, which is why she got the part. I think she had 2 lines the entire movie.

Oh wait, I can't forget the scene where Chick-bot captured the hearts of american families across the country. Remember her cool liquid metal cosmetics? Well she can also use them to make her breasts grow. She uses this when she gets pulled over by a cop. Oh, you are so clever, Chick-bot!! Too bad she totally blows it out the window when she ends up killing the cop anyway and taking his gun, thus clearly showing that the whole boob-growing concept was really an expression of the director's perverted nature screaming to get out. Poor, poor man. Let us all pity him now.",1139443200,5,3370,4.5636363636363635

1473439,3,B00005JM0B,"First, let me say I did like this movie, but, as a third Terminator installment, it was like T2 part 2. When I heard the name ""Rise of the Machines"", I expected it was going to move forward into the war. Instead it only touches on its beginning after a familiar rehash of the terminator vs terminator and the humans he was reprogrammed to protect theme. The idea of avoiding the war should have already been abandoned as impossible (explained below). And I take it that the ever better terminators employed by the machines are a sort of butterfly effect result of tampering with time. It appears that eventually the machines will win this game of cat and mouse being that their technology gets better each time while humans can only seem to muster up another reprogrammed T101.

Terminator was about a machine sent back in time by machines to destroy the mother of the man who would lead humans to defeat the machines and the man sent back to protect her. T2 was about the same thing but now the target is the boy who will grow up to lead humans to defeat the machines and instead of a man being sent back, a captured and reprogrammed terminator is sent back to protect the boy. T3 is guess what? It's T2 again but with the bad terminator sent to destroy the lieutenants of the human who would lead the humans to destroy the machines. Well, that's how it starts anyway, until the bad terminator realizes she can kill him himself as well as his lieutenants.

Now, it didn't take T3 to get the idea across that ""Judgement Day"" is inevitable. The storyline of the first two say that. After all, for John Conner to even be born, Judgement Day HAS to happen or his father is never sent back to protect his mother.

Any chance of moving ahead and into the war? I hope they don't launch T4:Operation Bloodline Erasure set in 1800s Wyoming... The T101 would be hard pressed to find good sunglasses or even the leather clothes or any of the now cliche' gags like he likes there.

Like I said, T3 is good in my opinion, but that road is getting overly worn. It was just too familiar to be better than average.",1137801600,,2099,4.416020671834626

Some of the acting is 3rd rate and the ending, whilst, is probably the its only plus point, does leave you wondering what is next.

1473494,4,B00005JM0B,"It's the same old story we have been dying to see again for ten years. The out-dated Terminator-from-the-Future (Aronold Schwarzenegger) has to once again save stubborn, ""Aw shucks, why me?"" John Connor (Nick Stahl). Yes, he remembers his mother's admonitions and the dark, dank future awaiting Mankind. Yes, he remembers ""Hasta la vista, baby."" He's hiding in plain sight, roaming the country, staying anonymous. However, a gorgeous new Terminator, T-X (Kristanna Loken), has arrived in L.A. Her mission? Kill John Connor and all his future lieutenants.

First thing of note, Arnold looks fabulous. He's pumped back up and whether it's a mannequin impersonating him, a realistic stunt double, or face and body putty, he's somehow erased ten years without looking like a feminized Michael Douglas. This time, the Terminator talks a lot. He's downright chatty. He has to explain what happened in THE TERMINATOR and TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY. Someone also has to explain the dull, convoluted network, Skynet, that will cause the rise of the machines and the takeover of the planet to the audience and update the technical advances of the T-X over the previous T-1000 (Robert Patrick).

No star wants to be responsible for ""exposition,"" yet screenwriters have not been able to find a good way of bringing back the maligned, but essential, Greek Chorus. This has a way of slowing down the story, especially when you are being hunted by a raging, extreme killing machine with only one purpose. Thankfully, The Terminator only talks while firing a grenade-launcher or carrying a casket.

Are we still waiting for Judgment Day?

Screenwriters John D. Brancato and Michael Ferris (writers of David Fincher's complex, smart movie The Game, starring the aforementioned Michael Douglas) do not bother refining, or, for that matter, deepening the Terminator bible. That would be like updating The Koran. Instead, we have all the set pieces that are retread, but, who cares? The Terminator arrives naked, gets his leather outfit, and gets the sunglasses. His mission, again, is to save Connor. He's a new Terminator made to resemble the old Terminator, but still an older model. There's no ""I'm your father"" twist.

It's really not easy to come up with a fresh, compelling stories, and sequels, with already terrific characters created, never seem to outdo the original. Why not start with the Terminator being called to his mission?

Connor's reluctant aide is Kate (Claire Danes) who remembers kissing him in junior high school. Their fates were sealed. Danes has an anguished, intelligent face that works well here. What she lacks, and might indeed aspire to, is Sarah Connor's (Linda Hamilton) ferocious determinism and iron will. Perhaps Kate will come into her own in TERMINATOR 4? Stahl's ""I'm running away from my Savior of Mankind destiny"" attitude leaves him wallowing around without much sex appeal. Perhaps he will mature and show some Spartan grit in the next one.

It's all about the casting and Loken is a fabulous find. She's got one expression and, like Robert Patrick, its ""pure resolve."" Loken is so definitively exact that the beating she takes from Arnold is not gender offensive.

Director Jonathan Mostow has a lot of technical dazzle to get up on the screen, so character work and nuisances are secondary here. The action scenes are extreme and spectacular, as T-X, in a mammoth crane, destroys everything in a fifty-mile radius. This is the kind of havoc we, the ""Shock and Awe Nation,"" expect.

I'm thrilled The Terminator has left behind obeying a boy and taken charge of the future. And finally, Judgment Day has arrived. The expectation was killing me.",1132531200,,3669,5.091514143094842

1473497,5,B00005JM0B,"While sitting through the obligatory watching of Collateral Damage the other weekend, I found myself thinking ""This isn't really a very good movie, so why am I sitting here?"" In case you didn't know, Collateral Damage is one of Arnold's Hollywood offering. In this particular movie, Arnold's family is killed when a Columbian terrorist bombs a prominent American building. When the government doesn't seem to want to do too much to avenge the death of his family, Arnold takes matters into his own hands (what else did you expect?). OK, so I knew that was coming. But the next thing I knew, Arnold was hiking across Columbia and taking on the Columbian Guerrilas on their own turf, by himself. Now, I've seen probably every Arnold movie in existance, and I've seen him do some pretty farfetched things... but this took the cake. Collateral Damage was kind of a disappointment. The thing that got me thinking in the first place was that I KNEW it wasn't going to be a very good movie. Something in my mind told me before I even left ""Hey, don't spend 10 on this movie, you know it's not going to live up to Raw Deal standards!"" But did I listen? Of course not! Why? Because it's an Arnold movie!

OK, I have a policy when it comes to going to movies, and believe me when I tell you that it's not very strict. Basically, if it doesn't feature Freddie Prinze Jr., a member of any boy band, or look like a chick flick, I'll go to it. I paid good money to see Dracula 2000 so that ought to tell you that I don't really care what I watch. However, there are some movies that I HAVE to see. These movies are the ones that I try my damndest to make it to on opening night, show up early so I get prime seating, and try to coax my friends into coming with me. Movies of this nature need only meet one of three criteria, as follows :

Movies that achieve 'Must-See' status in Der Dukes book:

1.) Any movie that contains Ah-nuld.

2.) Any movie that contains Sylvester Stallone.

3.) Any movie that contains Rachael Leigh Cook.

Therefore, according to rule #1, I HAD to buy and watch Collateral Damage. For all of you out there who are snickering and say ""This guy paid to see She's All That!?"", keep in mind that the criteria was really put to the test when Rachel Leigh Cook starred opposite Freddie Prinze, Jr., but I reached a compromise by only renting it when it went down to the 7-day rentals and not paying to see it in the theatres. So THERE!

Why do I have this system of movie-going standards? It's quite simple really, no one can put on a show like Ah-nuld, and not many chicks look as good as Ms. Cook. Now, you may make a case that Arnold isn't the best actor... you may say that he lacks any acting range... you may even say that he's too old. In all three cases I wouldn't argue with you. I'm not jaded enough to think that Arnold should be nominated for an Oscar, I don't go to their movies for the engaging plot, the excellent character development, and the terrific climax. Hell, no! I go for the laughs! I go for the things that you might not realize makes a movie starring one of these two actors great! So, if you've ever had troubles enjoying a movie that featured Arnold Schwarzenegger or Sylvester Stallone, let me help you out by listing the things that make their movies great.

What makes Arnold movies so great?

1.) ""We've gaht to get owda he-ah!""

First and foremost, Arnold's catchphrase is the number one reason to go to an Arnold flick. During every Arnold movie, I hang on every word he speaks. Why? Because sometime, during every single Arnold movie ever made, Arnold shouts out his classic phrase ""We've gaht to get owda he-ah!"" His accent is what makes it great and it never ceases to crack me up. While the phrase might not be EXACTLY like that, you can almost bet your bottom dollar there will be some variation of it during the course of the movie. Other popular variations include ""Let's get owda he-ah!"", ""Come on, let's get owda he-ah!"", or - as was the case in Collateral Damage - ""Theahs a BOMB in he-ah!""

I am almost positive that that phrase (or any variataion thereof) must be included in every single movie Arnold acts in. If it's not, Arnold won't act. He probably has it written into his contractual demands. A meeting between Arnold and a movie exec would go something like this:

Movie Exec : Ok Arnold, here's the deal. In this movie, you star as a battle-hardened war veteran. On a mission to South Korea, you single handedly disable the entire Korean army, disarm 15 nuclear missiles by yourself - using only a pair of wire clippers - then you rescue the soldiers from the POW camp while facing off against a mutant alien from another planet! In the end, you kill him by throwing a grenade made up of baking soda and vinegar! Total kill count is upwards of 66,000!

Arnold : **Flipping through the script.** I like it... I like it... BUT THEAH IS A PLOBLEM WIT DIS SCRIPT!

Movie Exec : What's wrong?! You get to kill an insane amount of people, flex your oiled up biceps, carry a log on your shoulder, drive a truck with no brakes down a steep incline, and do battle with a space alien who possesses technology unknown to man! We've fulfilled all of your contractual demands!

Arnold : You've fulfilled all but ONE! ""WE'VE GAHT TO GET OWDA HE-AH!"" If it's not in theah, I'm OWDA HE-AH!

2.) Arnold's great one-liners.

Few can deliver the one-liner better than Arnie. In just about every movie, he's got to spout off a few one-liners. Usually it's just after he kills someone, so you really get to appreciate the great sense of humour Arnold has. Let me tell you about my favorite Arnold one-liners:

Great one-liner #1:

Early on in the movie Commando, Arnold tells one of the bad guys that he likes him so much that he's going to kill him last. Later on, Arnold catches up with the same guy and runs his Porsche off the road, then he holds him upside down over the edge of a very steep cliff. In this particular scene, Arnold mutters not one, but TWO delicious one-liners.

Arnold : Hey Sully, remember when I said I would kill you last? I Lied!

**Arnold lets go of Sully and Sully falls to his death.**

Great one-liner #2 (Same scene!):

**Arnold walks back to the car.**

Girl : What did you do to him?

Arnold : I let him go! (BRILLIANT!)

Great one-liner #3:

The final fight scene in Commando takes place between Arnold and the main bad guy, Bennett, in a boiler room. Arnold ends up throwing a steel pipe javelin-style at Bennett, and it impales him. When we see Bennett, we see the pipe sticking out of him has also ruptured one of the boilers behind him and steam is shooting out of the exposed end. Arnold mutters ""Let off some steam, Bennett!""

Great one-liner #4:

As Arnold and his cronies bust up a terrorst camp in the jungle, Arnold is rummaging through a hut when he sees someone beside him. He pulls his knife out and throws it at his adversary, killing him and at the same time pinning him to a wooden beam. What does Arnold have to say about this? ""Stick around!""

Do you see the utter hilarity in all of these? You can't help but laugh when Arnold cracks a joke just after murdering someone!

3.) Action, action, everywhere!

If you're going to an Schwarzenegger movie to be enthralled with the plot, you are an idiot. I go to Arnold movies because I know I won't have to think for at least 90 minutes. Many times I don't want to go to a movie like Arlington Road that makes me think too hard... I just want to see a guy wielding a machine gun kill at least 150 other men. In addition, I like explosions. I'm a pyro at heart, and I know the simple mathematical equation - Arnold + starring role in a movie = explosions. Guys like to see stuff blowing up, and I'm no different. Whether it's Arnie tossing grenades, filling light bulbs up with gasoline, or detonating remote bombs, I know if I want to see lots of things go boom, all I have to do is look for Arnold's name on the movie poster.

4.) The 'dying breed' factor.

Only in the 80's could a guy like Arnold rise to superstardom. Face it, the guy looks like a genetic freak, he's probably spent more money on steroids than I'll see in a lifetime, he's not that great of an actor, and he's very much a one-dimensional actor (say what you want, but Kindergarten Cop was NOT a funny movie). Do you think movies like Raw Deal and Commando would be mega-hits in this day and age? Not a chance. Sure, many of us still go to action-movies, but the reality is the only thing movie studios cater to these days are pre-pubescent girls, and I don't know if too many 13 year old girls think Arnold is ""Like, SOOOOOO HOT!"" 9 out of 10 movies that come out nowadays are teenybopper flicks with PG-ratings. However, Arnold is one of the few actors that defines the 'action movie'. How many new action-movie stars have there been in recent years? I can't think of a single one off the top of my head. I thought there might be some hope for Josh Hartnett after seeing Blackhawk Down, but then I saw him in a preview for some stupid-ass teen movie entitled '40 days and 40 nights' (or something like that). Face it, when Arnie, Sylvester Stallone, Jean Claude Van Damme, and Steven Seagal die, we may never see another action-movie star again. As such, as these guys get older and make fewer movies, the testosterone factor of movies continues to drop at an alarming rate.

1473501,4,B00005JM0B,"Well after 12 whole years of waiting Terminator fans were givin another chance to see Arnie blow some stuff up and survive rediculous amounts of explosions and so on and so forth. Anyway this time Arnie returns as a different cyborg from the same line as the one from the first two (so he doesn't remember all of the fun he shared with Edward Furlong in the second installment). He's back to pretect John Connor (this time played by Nick Stahl) and Kate Brewster (who happens to be a girl from John's past, played by Claire Danes) from Skynet's toughest cyborg the T-X (played by Kristanna Loken).

This third installment in the Terminator series dissapointed a lot of T-Fans but not me! It wasn't as good as the first but I honestly thought it was just as good, if not slightly better than #2 (and you can just bite me Ebert). I just thought that the action was all there and it was ther apleanty (just what I expected and wanted from this film too). Now to comment on the acting. Nick Stahl, although he did a good job I just didn't think he was right for the charcter. John Connor is supposed to be a ""rebel"" and they even comment on how he is still one today but Stahl didn't come off as that type of guy but rather just a normal guy. Claire Danes did good as well and she was perfect for her part. Kristanna Loken didn't really need to be there, it could have been anyone playing her character...man or women (but she was great to look at). Arnie gives a performance that is all that you'd expect it to be. He is quite funny in the movie too (the line ""talk to the hand"" was awesome). The visuals were stunning. But unlike the second one (which broke new grounds in the way of visuals) you see this kind of thing everyday, so it is a very typical action movie style of visuals. The movie was very exciting and action packed. It is one of those movies that makes you fell breathless and makes you fell like you've been out running. Not to mention that it makes you think at points and really brings the ""Terminator"" saga to new levels.

I don't know what everybody's problem with this was. It was a fun, action-packed ride that won't be forgotten (and Ebert can just shove it).

1473572,1,B00005JM0B,"If you're truly a lover of the first two movies, do yourself a favor and pull a 'Highlander 2'...just pretend it doesn't exist and go about your day happily.

But because sometimes my curiosity overcomes my good sense too, I'll be brief and try not to give much of anything away. The facet that makes this film a truly atrocious follow up is the humongous finger it gives, in a thematic sense, to its predecessors. The first two films in the series shared the same, noble theme...""There is no fate but what we make."" This not so glorious addition edits that slightly to read...""Oh, yeah, we were wrong. There really is a fate you can't escape no matter what you do, so you might as well give up."" Huh?

Secondly, the Terminator has been reduced to the robotic equivalent of Lou Costello. Sure, it's dangerous, but mostly it's just the straight man. In the first movie, it was terrifying. Remember when it started wearing the shades to cover the gaping wound in its face after it had just surgically removed the remains of its own eye? Now its a cheap gag with pink plastic shades. Have we really fallen so far?

Despite Arnold's involvement, this movie was apparently put together by people who had no clue what the orignal and its sequel were about. Trust me, when that last Terminator's thumbs up disappeared into the molten metal, the world was saved. It's better that way.",1124064000,18,1376,4.608163265306122
1473573,1,B00005JM0B,"Ah, the old Curmudgeon Spidey-Sense.  Never fails. As much as I loved the two Terminator movies (first one especially), I had no good feeling about Terminator 3. And whaddya know? I was right.

First of all, the new female Terminator is RUBBISH. They really had shot themselves in the foot creating the T-1000 for T2, because there was no way they could ever have created something more intimidating, more of a genuine, unstoppable threat, than Robert Patrick's. And even though the T-X is 1000 times nicer to look at, she is nowhere near convincing enough. And Arnie's Terminator isn't the same either. It's a lame reprisal of a role, and whilst the jokes in T2 worked, here they grate (they just HAD to have a gay bar in, didn't they?)

This wouldn't be so bad if the original movies weren't so good. It's not as if this is some tacky sequel to a B-movie. But it not only tarnishes the originals, it makes them POINTLESS. Basically, ""uh, yeah, all that stuff that happened in the first two movies, all the lives that were snuffed out, that was for nothing anyway. Sorry.""

Inexcusable. Pretend it doesn't exist.

1473574,5,B00005JM0B,"So here we are- T3. And boy does it have a lot to live up to after the flawless T2. But hey- here we go!

Set early on in the 21st century, today, John Connor (Nick Stahl) is in hiding. His mother Sarah Connor who died of Leukemia a couple of years ago, lived long enough to make sure that their actions in T2 had been successful. Still, John Connor had never trusted that it was truly over. We will later discover that neither did Sarah Connor. Now hiding so that the machines could never ever find him, John Connor encounters Kate Brewster (Claire Danes). So does the Terminatrix, a future cyborg with a hardened endoskeleton, liquid metal covering and on board weapons- her mission is to terminate all of John Connor's lieutenants from the future war with the machines. Should the Terminatrix happen to find John Connor, she is to terminate him too along with Kate Brewster (his future....). To complicate matters, a T-101 Terminator (Arnie) has also arrived but is he here to kill John Connor or protect him? An answer we will soon discover, along with the realization that today is in fact Judgment Day (it had only been delayed by the events of T2), and not only do John Connor and Kate Brewster have to save themselves, they have to save all of humanity, or do they? Was humanity meant to be saved? Was Judgment Day meant to be stopped?

T3 is simply amazing. I actually prefer it to T2. It has action, excitement, revelations and a heart felt ending. The acting is great, particularly from Nick Stahl and Claire Danes, and even Arnie who gives his best portrayal of the Terminator to date. The ending has set things up for Terminators 4 & 5 if they get made, but even if they don't, T3's conclusion is quit possibly the most appropriate conlusion to the Terminator series there could have been.

The movie on DVD is accompanied by Dolby Digital 5.1 sound which does a very good job- no need for dts here. The extras are a bit bare, but still above average.

One of the best movies you'll see. Enjoy!",1122854400,,2007,4.49041095890411

However, in his divorce from Linda Hamilton, he gave her the rights to the Terminator movies, which she then sold, enabling this film to be made. It would have been nice to have Edward Furlong reprise his role as John Connor, however, he was dealing with substance abuse issues at the time. People complain that Skynet should have been terminated by the events of the second movie, however, Skynet is software, and all that was destroyed in the second movie was hardware, which would still be developed, although later in history.",1121904000,,595,4.786407766990291
1473577,3,B00005JM0B,"The hype of this movie has been pretty low key. Arnold has gone out and done some interviews (actually, I think he's using this movie to sell his bid for the Governor job in California), but little else has been said.

It is ten years later and the expected holocaust that Sarah Conner had nightmares of never happened. However, John cannot seem to let it go and is leading a hobo life in anticipation that Skynet will one day become aware. It becomes reality as a new terminator is sent back to destroy John Connor and his future lieutenant in order to rewrite history while the rebellion sends back their own terminator to protect him. This time, not only is John's life on the line, but also the lives of the world as the new Terminatrix prepares for the arrival of her master, the Skynet AI. It will be up to John and the old T101 (and his future wife Kate Brewster) to prevent that from happening.

This movie is a hack in many regards and the source it steals from most is T2: Judgment Day. From the fact that there are two Terminators in a showdown to the fact that Arnold has to have the Ray-ban glasses, much of this movie can be seen in the previous movie. However, this time, Arnold is less the nurturing machine to the man-child John and more the sarcastic killing sidekick. Only Arnold has the one liners in this movie and he does say them with the relish he can get away with under his emotionless exterior. Another movie this borrows from is from the Matrix (even though the series came out 13 years earlier) but more in fact, the Animatrix. Of course, you can also say that the movie also stole from the Forbin project back in the 1970's. It sees a time, where there is no AI mainframe, where the computers will attack from the world wide web, which is different from the movies which also tried to characterize a supercomputer (HAL 9000) adversary as a physical box which could be overcome. The way that T3 falls is more like tha Anime movies like Ghost in the Shell where AI consciousness is gained in a global web.

Going back to Animatrix, T3 follows the stories in that short stories DVD that reflect the human history and their war with the AI. It is similar (As with the Forbin Project) that human's are deemed as a threat to their existence and need to be wiped out. This movie portrays this fairly well.

Another movie series this rips from is the ""Planet of the Apes"" series. Like those four movies which do a full circle and come around, the Terminator movies also do the same, and that's why I really liked the depressing ending. Some people think that the ending opens up for a fourth Terminator movie where it would end with Reese (Michael Biehn) going back in time to save the original Sarah. I guess the take of T3 will decide that.

The acting is done well in most regards. Claire Danes, who plays the spunky Kate is almost unrecognizable (she always plays this weepy girly girl character) and is pretty good with the material she's given. Arnold seems to have this role down pat and is on cruise control. It is remarkable that in 20 years, his body has not changed much. Nick Stahl does a great job playing John Connor, but he does not look like the hero, resemble or carry himself like the John Connor first Terminator movie. For some reason that did bother me. However, even though he will always be ADD boy from ""Man without a Face"" he gets the aimless man with a mission thing down good and comes off much better than the whiny kid that was portrayed by Edward Furlong in T2. Kristanna Loken does a fantastic job as the TX, much better than the T1000 played by Robert Patrick in the second movie. All she is required to do is run, fight and look unemotional and she pulls it off well. Of course, this doesn't mean that she can act, but for this role, she knew what it requred.

The main fault of this movie is not that is more of a classic big-budget movie, but it is an old style movie that has no flair or panache. Maybe I'm still being wowed by effect heavy or ""slow mo in every frame"" fare like charlie's Angels or the Matrix where every action frame has to stand out on their own, or epics like the ""Lord of the Rings"" where the computer devises thousands of enemies to fight the heroes, but this movie seems to be a little small. Take the scene where John is being followed by the TX and 4 cars she is controlling. 5 years ago, that would have been an amazing scene with ET and Extra doing round the clock interview on how they could destroy a building with an industrial crane, nowadays, it's like: ""What, they didn't use a computer?"" However, Mostow films it a little to matter of factly, no overhead shots, no wide angle shots. It's actually fairly choppy, like the whole chase scene (which actually looked better planned out than the Matrix car chase). Everything in this movie has a low budget feel to it and it is because this movie is relic of action movies past.

However, saying that, as an older movie watcher, I did like the action scenes and I felt the movie did go at a quick enough pace. I feel that the movie didn't really with the issue of ""Should John risk it and go and fight to save the present? Or Hide and know he will save the future?"" That could have been an interesting premise. Anyway, compared to the Matrix Reloaded and Charlies Angels, this one is the best of the bunch and will provide a good time that exists slightly above the those who like their movies brain DOA....Rating: B-

1473578,4,B00005JM0B,"First you had the Terminator in 1984, than there was Terminator 2: Judgement Day in 1991, now there was Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines in 2003.

This movie is one of those movies you just have to see after seeing the first two. It is a great action movie, with great special effects and fights. The only thing that is missing in this wild picture, is the darkness that James Cameron brought to the first two Terminator Films. There is more humor and everything looks way more colourfull than it was in the first two films.

But besides the missing darkness, the third Terminator movie is great! It could have been better in some perspectives, but it is a good continuation of the story.

Arnold Schwarzenegger is back once again as the Terminator. He does it once again with the coolness and style that was in the last two films.

Nick Stahl plays John Connor, and does a great job. You feel the fear he still has of Judgement day and his nightmares.

Claire Danes playes Kate Brewster, a vet that gets stuck in the situations of John and Terminator. She also knows who to show her character in a way that is needed for the film to work.

Kristanna Loken is here, after Robert Patricks great part in T2 as the Terminatrix, the T-X and does it fantasticly! She keeps her face in one line the whole time, which makes her a very believable and feared Terminator. And she really knows how to kick some butt.

Conclusion: A great Terminator movie that completes another chapter in the Terminator timeline.

Having said that, I believe Terminator 3 is a better film. This entry holds the same place that Episode III does in the Star Wars saga. This is the film that pulls everything together. In this movie you get to see the key events unfold that give rise to the Machines. In that respect alone, it took my breath away. It's like watching a global train wreck in slow motion without being able to do anything about it. You're not watching dream sequences or listening to a back story. This is the real deal, from Skynet going online, to the cyborg infecting the systems, to nuclear Armageddon. As they say, this one has ""the money shot.""

Terminator 3 is also the most watchable of all three films. It is simply more entertaining. It is a real feat to create a film that works so well, balancing bits of humor with action and profound questions about space and time.

The Earl Boen cameo was a great touch!

Arnold really wanted to make this movie, and it shows. He went into a vigorous exercise program for this movie, attaining the exact weight and measurements that he had in 1991. There is virutally no difference in the cyborg you see in Terminator 2 or 3.

I have been watching this film repeatedly since 2003 and am still not tired of watching it! This is everything that I had been wanting to see since the original film from 1984.",1120176000,2,1497,4.4489051094890515

In the meantime, the female TX is sent back to kill her. So, there's going to be some rumble.

The movie has awesome special effects and some good action scenes. The famous chase is great and the action is nonstop. But, in this one, Arnold actually tries to be funny.

1473617,5,B00005JM0B,"It would be almost impossible for a T-3 to live up to the expectations of the Cameron purists who love the first two. I don't blame them--everyone has their opinion--but I loved the first two movies, and I was just as surprised as the other positive reviewers that I loved the third too.

This movie simply builds on the legacy of the first two in a logical and updated way. It keeps screwing with the impossible paradox of time travel and does so with very pleasantly surprising wit and just a touch of B-movie camp. Personally, when I go back and look at the first Terminator movie, I think that Nick Stahl as John Connor at 20-something really does look like he could be a son of Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn. He has that scruffy look that Biehn had and the intense sullenness that Hamilton put to such good use in T2. His uncertainty about having to be the ""destined leader"" is dealt with in a swift but poignant way.

One needs to remember that although it is still Arnold the actor, the ""fact"" is, this is a DIFFERENT T-800 specimen, one that was programmed to have ""psychology as a subroutine"" and in its own ""I'm not a robot, I'm a cyberkinetic organism"" way, has its own ""personality."" This is a Terminator who has that weird wry sense of humor and mannerisms--it looks at the person pointedly before talking, it's obviously been programmed to like cool sunglasses...it's been ""programmed"" by the future Kate Brewster to not kill humans just as the young John did with his Terminator in T2, and to learn the lingo. The scene where Terminator goes shopping is pretty damn funny, and the cameo by a Terminator movie actor veteran is truly inspired.

There are subtle Terminator 1 and 2 tributes and witty layers to this movie that can be missed easily; I still catch nuances even after the fifth viewing. The extra on the DVD with Sgt. Candy is just awesome! (the commentary voice over by Arnold is pretty lame, IMO). The whole issue of ""were we MEANT to be together"" is played with very nicely...(""I can't be meant for you... you're a mess!"") ... the issue of how the future continues to be altered hangs true here. If there is a T-4, I hope it focuses on how the alternate realities plague the future Connor. Remember, he loses three or more of his key lieutenants in this movie...that will affect the inevitable war to come. Just what portions of the future CAN humans alter? Is it that there are basic events you can't change, but there are still things you can?

Although, sure, the character development isn't profound, it's certainly as good or better than any you see in a typical Hollywood movie. There's a nice Oedipal touch when Connor stares at the battle-crazed Kate Brewster and mumbles: ""You remind me of my mother."" It's also so damn refreshing to see strong, non-hyper-sexualized female characters (here, it's Kate Brewster, but I also love how they slyly make pointed fun of the buxom evil vixen prototype with the lovely Kristanna Loken's Terminatrix)in a sci-fi series. That's one factor that made the original Terminator movies great and it continues here, without the bad '80s hair. They have also updated the Judgement Day fable to accommodate 21st-century technology, what with the Internet and all, and leaves you still pondering the puzzle of what would happen if we were able to screw with the future.

Last but not least--for action fans, the car-crane-motorcyle scene through downtown LA is an absolute humdinger!

For me, nothing is better than a futuristic sci-fi flick that actually attempts to tell a story and say something about our society, technology and human nature. The first two Terminator movies did that, and so does T-3--just not in the exact same way that it would have if Cameron had still been involved. It's still a gem in its own right, with excellent acting, great special effects and a sense of humor.  What more could you want in a good movie?",1112918400,3,3906,4.693430656934306
1473706,1,B00005JM0B,"Following the advice of a co-worker, I decided to finally rent ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"". I was kind of avoiding it, because Schwarzenegger once said that he would only do T3 if James Cameron were involved.

Well, Cameron must've transmogrified into the giant dump truck of money driven up to Arnold's place.

Where do I start with just how awful this movie was... wooden acting, revisionist continuity almost on par with ""Highlander 2: The Quickening"", no sense of fear or danger, I mean, I think the T-1000 could slap around the T-X just by staring at her. And too many: ""Hey look, this is a reference to the last two movies!"" moments.

And the ending, oh geez, I won't spoil the oh-so-huge twist ending but was the most anticlimatic piece of dreck I've ever seen. And frankly, I wouldn't trust my life to somebody who killed my future self not too long ago, thank you.

I thought this movie was iffy when I first heard about it. And this is a true story: when I went to ""The Matrix Reloaded"" on opening night some executives from Warner Bros. were in the audience and asked us to do a survey afterwards. One of the questions asked our opinion of the T3 trailer shown beforehand. I let them know exactly what I thought given the limited responses available: ""It it highly unlikely that I will see this movie."" I mean, I just sat down to see a movie where machines have taken over the world and the T3 trailer made Terminator start to look like a Matrix ripoff!

I wonder if you can file class actions against state governors who made bad movies to get our money back.

Well, I finally watched ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" and I can't unwatch it. Now any future viewings of T1 and T2 have been tainted, thank you so very much mister director-man. Thank you for running a once-respected action franchise into the ground. I won't be back.",1109980800,7,1856,4.508928571428571

the name lives up to itself

and the ending is quite shocking

because wether or not they make another T movie or not I will always like T and T2 and this one.

I would like to have them make a T4 movie. but wether or not they do I will be understanding. perhaps the ending of T3 lets us know there might not be left much to tell to the rest of Judgement day with the Machines. or that there is much to learn of it and we have yet to know it all truly. we shall see which way it goes. but either way this film is amazing. has alot of comedy in it. alot of action just as much as the first and second T films. Arnold does great at playing a relentless, soldier if you will to protect Conner. I would of liked to have Furlong play the grown up version of Conner but Nick Stahl works just as well. he reproduces the way John Conner is like in T2. curious, smart ass mouth talker, dangerous, and smart all in one. I like that he can reuse what Conner has even if someone else plays his role. Kristanna Loken is sexy and scary as her role. she's the perfect female terminatrix as they call her somewhere in the movie or story. I can't wait to see the other movies she was in before this or after this movie. the whole cast is brilliant. Johnathen Mostow is just as innovative as James Cameron is with his first 2 Terminator movies. he adds just as much shock, comedy etc as Cameron did. both directors should be proud of themselves. wether Cameron would of made this or Mostow. I still would of seen it. all directors deserve a chance when they create something. so glad I got this on dvd. the Sgt. Candy scene is hilarious. and you really learn alot on disc 2 about the special effects, etc. quite a great movie. saw it 1 time in theatre. and 5 times on dvd. it will be seen more times played in my dvd player when I can watch it. rest assured people",1109289600,,1882,4.051075268817204
1473708,2,B00005JM0B,"It felt like Terminator 2 was the end, I mean, skynets ruined, the chips have been destroyed, and it's suppose to leave the rest up to the people to decide the unwritten future.  So at first, I immedietly felt like they were blowing a $170,000,000 budget on a unexpected sequal.  But being a fan of this series, I had to check it out

Well it's gonna be hard to adjust with no Linda Hamilton, or Edward Furlong(Who was John Conor not Nick Stahl).  And it always has a bad guy or good, but it's bad, andthis time the antigonist is a female terminator, an enticer huh?

Arnold is back, which is a good thing, cuz replacing him would be a travesty.  Other than him, the only other cast member to return was Earl Boen(Dr. Silberman)  Who in this movie felt like he saw a ghost.  James Camron is not back to dierect, because of problems with Linda Hamilton, and he felt like the series was complete when T2 was finished.  Well is that good or bad.

Anyway onto the story.  Judgment day wasn't stopped it was postponed, so here we go again.  Well the action sceenes are nowhere near as spectacular as T2.  This Terminator feels like it ain't going all out, which the previous 2 did, they seemed like they wound never stop, but this one looked like one that could be challenged by the protagonist. And it doesn't give a real sense of danger like the previous 2 did.  Not only that, this film was nowhere near as groundbreaking as it's predicessors

I didn't expect alot from this movie, but dang!  I though it woulndn't be this bad.  Man if only James Camron were behind the film or if it were never made.  They were trying too hard for a sequal that never should have been made.  It was boring most of the way, it felt like it tried to move with the style of new films, and the real geniouses behind the series, sadly, weren't there to finish it off.  I'm very sad to see such a good series get tarnished by it's final film.(Nearly the same thing that happened in the Godfather PT.3)  The only reason this film is bairly even rentable, is because Arnold is still around, but he couldn't fill the shoes of those who left.

1473709,4,B00005JM0B,"Well, Here's the thing...I am someone who enjoyed this movie the second time I saw it. I first saw the film on HBO one night and didn't really enjoy it that much. I was a little confused and somewhat disturbed by the whole ""End of the world"" scenario and it also didn't help that I am not a big fan of the first 2 movies and had only seen each of those once before. The things I did like in this movie were the action sequences, which were very entertaining and kept the viewer on the edge of there seat. I also liked the whole odd chemistry that Katherine and John had through the film. It was kind of interesting seeing the two characters, who are brought together to make it to the future, deal with learning they are going to one day be married and lead a revolution against the machines that will end the world. There are things that confuse me about the series that I still would love some clarification on, such as, since John's father, Kyle, was from the future, where is he in the whole apocolypse scenario? Would he even be alive or was he born after the apocolypse? How come the terminatrix never goes after him because if he doesn't survive then John could never be conceived, right? It's all a little confusing to me, but I still liked the movie and disagree with what some of the reviewers are saying. Also, some people are saying that Edward Furlong was an amazing and much more emotive ""John"" but Edward Furlong was about 12 years old when he played that role and I don't think it really mattered that Edward didn't reprise the role since he is a completely different man now and would probably not bring that same spunk to the character. Nick Stahl did a fair job, although at times he comes off a little stiff and wooden with his lines. Claire Danes is one of my favorite actresses but I felt like some of her lines in this movie were also a tiny bit under-acted. The moment when John pulls the gun out and tells the Terminator that he is going to kill himself and she looks over at him and says, OH JOHN!...That is one of the worst delivered movie lines ever. Overall though, the movie is what it is, a good action movie. For die hard fans, there could be some plot problems or casting upsets, but I still would recomend the movie to people who want to see a good action flick.",1108684800,,2296,4.304849884526559

As a big fan of Terminator 1 + 2, i was absolutely dissapointed of Terminator 3. This Movie has a lot of cool actionscenzes but the soul of the terminator movies was not included. Jonathan Mostow did a bad job. Because of... I don't remember that the Terminator was a clown!?!? There were too many jokes the Terminator did speak out...I expect from a Terminator movie a serious Killermachine without joking, like in the Part 1 + 2! That was a big mistake wich Jonathan Mostow did. He didn't realise that this is a Killermachine and not a Clown!!!!!

two and it surely didn't. No need for me to go into depth

about the characters and stuff because there are 700 and

something reviews already that tell you this....

The reason this movie didn't live up to the first two is

that the characters lack the emotion. The new John Conner

is a below average actor... He doesn't have the emotion

or doesn't have the charisma of Ed Furlong. Also, the

other female failed to come close to replacing Linda

Hamilton. She seems to average and lacks the toughness

and grit of Linda..... Arnold doesn't show his age THAT

much but seems alittle weak in this. He just doesn't seem

very tough in this movie. His character seems to get beat

up the whole movie.

However, the movie holds the action well and doesn't really

slow down the entire movie. If the movie had more emotion

it would have turned out better. But the cast just didn't

not do a good enough job esp Conner. If you haven't seen

The original Terminator is one of my favorite movies. The original was more of a horror movie with innovative ideas and a fantastic plot. The first sequel was a financial blockbuster whose FX were on the cutting edge at that time. The sequel was not scary or suspenseful, instead it was just this huge sci-fi spectacle that expanded on the original idea. Both movies can exist on their own merits. However this second sequel is totally unnecessary. THey are grasping at straws trying and struggling to come up with something new in this movie. FOr example the Bad Terminator is now a model chick called the TX! Wow! What's next a Terminator dog? The opening is almost an exact replica from T2, except that THIS time Arnold doesn't go into a biker bar it's a male stripper bar!! Oh the originality! Arnold is still a Good Terminator sent to once again protect John Conner. Here is where this movie falls apart. The actor who plays Conner does a poor job. His leading lady played by Claire Danes is just as bad. This is the couple who are suppossed to save humanity? We're in trouble! I would rate this movie as being OK. I certainly don't recommend buying it, if you can find it cheap and are a completionist then maybe otherwise save your money and just buy the original and the first sequel only.",1104278400,2,1447,4.569230769230769

T3 suffers from what I would call a lack of storyline or ""substance"" what the previous 2 Terminator movies have. This movie also lack the human emotion and/or journey that made Terminator 2:Judgment Day a flagship movie, even till this day. Don't get me wrong, Jonathan Mostow did a great job with this movie but the thing is, he played it safe by not explaining too much on the abovementioned. On the bright side, this movie gives us something that the previous 2 movies didn't: a face off with a female terminator(that ought to keep the temperature up a little). The trailer sequence was impressive. And when the story ends, there are possibilities for a fourth sequel cause this movie has not done a good job of ""closing"" the story for good. One more thing, the running time is a little too short for a Terminator movie, compared to T2, which is 2 hours over. To wrap this up, this movie is great for viewing on a lazy Saturday afternoon.

The action is pointless and after all it's just like kids fighting with SUPERMAN power.

T1 and T2 has a great story and T3 has none. The scripts in T3 are stupid, for some reason the scriptwriter kept using the lines from T2, he's probably trying to connect T2 and T3 together, but that's pathetic, it sounds so corny!
This movie is no different than AVP, Resident Evil, Aliens 4, horrible movies, these movies spoiled the legend!

I am disappointed in the remake, it ends terriblly like Dr Strangelove, but unlike the Kubrick classic it isn't a comedy ( I don't think) it is hard to tell, it is a mix of romance, comedy, suspense and mild horror - how in the hell can that happen? I'm all for new ideas but this is not new, or even remotely thrilling to watch. Arnold Schwarzenegger is back (sadly) as the teminator, another good one (sadly) you know what will happen from the start, the terminators will arrive in the present, one good and one bad, the bad one will chase the good one who's the robotic bodyguard of to hapless little f**ks and it all end in an explosive climax (yawn).

  I am also very very sad because I actually pray for crappy director James Cameron to take the helm from Jonathan Mostow (who may as well have pointed the camera at the moon all the way through, it would have been more interesting) although Cameron does have a tendancy to use shoddy special effects and unusual camera positioning to show his production.

 Arnie is too old, a woman terminator is not what should be done and the storyline is too shaky and far-fetched to believe, but enough with the faults - what are the good points?

 * It made me laugh through sheer tedium

 * Arnie's star glasses are fun shame he crushed 'em

 * They used an assortment of fun vehicles - Crane, Hearse and a Camper Van.

There is absolutely no character development in the movie.  The John Connor character in this movie could have been played by just anybody under this script and director.  Obviously Jonathan Mostow aren't the type of director that pay much attention to details, which become his major failure as a director.

Get this disc for the jaw-dropping chase scene across downtown L.A. involving a crane, fire truck, police vehicles and a pick-up.  Simply spectacular!

We assumed that seeing for a third time a Terminator chasing its prey around Los Angeles like some sort of mechanical Jason Vorhees would be tedious and hold no new surprises. Delightfully, we couldn't have been more wrong if we were horny teenagers at summer camp sneaking off by ourselves to go swimming in Crystal Lake telling our friends, ""we'll be right back."" The initial chase scene is so suspenseful we actually found ourselves holding our breath.



There are also some great concepts to ponder. The creators present us with ideas of fate, destiny and the inevitability of our own destruction in the tradition of mid-twentieth century speculative fiction. Ragnarok is unavoidable, no matter how hard a man, a society or a civilization tries to prevent it.



If you are a fan of the original films, then T3 will not disappoint you. Viewers get to witness the exact nanosecond when the machines rise up against humanity. The proto-type T-1 robots look authentically like something designed by humans and demonstrate how much more technologically advanced the Terminators will become. The creative minds behind this element did their homework and should be praised for the effect created. This film is no mere exploitative sequel. It adds a rich dimension to the John Connor saga and ends in such a way as to make us eager to see additional installments. This is a spectacular feat for the third film in a trilogy.

And to actually make a Terminator movie without Cameron just seemed so wrong. To my surprise I came out loving it, and I think the reason is you can tell that the people who made this movie were actually fans of the first two films. Jonathan Mostow does a wonderful job of keeping it faithful to the others but at the same time offers us something new. Adding Nick Stahl and Claire Danes to the cast was actually a really smart move. They have wonderful chemistry on screen together. And even though Nick Stahl looks nothing like Edward Furlong he actually does a better job in here than Furlong did in Terminator 2 so you have no problem believing that this is John Connor.  Arnold is his usual Terminator self. He's good in it but that's because he's playing a robot, but Arnold is a robot so it couldn't have been that hard for him to do. The new villain in the film is a female Terminator, which seems like a cornball idea but it actually works. I wouldn't say she's a better villain that the T-1000 but she is, at least, as interesting of a villain. Even though I hate it when movies go beyond three films I would actually like to see another one. The ending of the movie (which I LOVE!) really closes, what you could call, the first three chapters but leaves it open for a new kind of Terminator film. Of course I won't tell you the ending but in my opinion this one had a better ending than all of the Terminator movies. There's a lot of humor in the movie but it doesn't take away the dark feel of the film. I suppose Terminator 2 had some humor but in the ""humor department"" Terminator 3 exceeds it in many ways. Not all of the jokes work but most of them do and the ones that do make you forget the ones that don't.  The special features on the DVD are okay, but nothing really special. I wish there would have been some kind of documentary on all three films, plus all the novels, graphic novels, video games and what not. Maybe even interviews with James Cameron, Jonathon Mostow, and the cast and crew.  I think that's something the fans of the Terminator movies would have really love to see. The commentaries are pretty interesting, especially the one with Jonathon Mostow by himself. There is another commentary with the cast, which is okay, but when Arnold talks it hurts my ears. In the end this was a movie I really thought would suck, but while I was watching it I actually got the same feeling I got from the first two films. I can't say it's a better movie than the first two because truthfully it's not, but it is worthy of them.

I knew this movie would suck the moment I heard that James Cameron wasn't going to direct it, and that Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong weren't in the cast. It's no longer an intelligent tale about love, time travel, and the evils of technology and progress. Now it's a series of car chases, shoot outs, and explosions. Albeit the first two films also had a great deal of that, but it was still intertwined with romance, and emotion. I.E. The love affair between Kyle Reese and Sarah Conner, Sarah Conner's love for her son and undying determination to survive, and of course John Conner's growing affection for the Terminator. But I'm afraid that is severely lacking in this installment. They took a moving, epic story and turned it into ""The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.""

I love Arnold, and I voted for him too, but I'm afraid it was painfully obvious to me that this film was nothing more than a giant ""Arnold For Governor"" ad. He wanted to make a big exit from the film industry and into politics. What better way to do that than in this 172 million dollar mess? I'm afraid he failed miserably, though. Instead, he just looked old and tired in this portrayal of a washed-up character.

Nick Stahl plays John Conner in this flick, and I've never even heard of the basterd. All I know is that he has no business playing the role that was written for Edward Furlong. He is supposed to come off as a man who has spent his entire life in hiding, and on the run from the authorities, but how could anyone possibly believe that when he doesn't even LOOK like John Conner would look as an adult.

Kristana Loken does alright as the T-X, but they didn't give her anything interesting to say in the entire movie. Robert Patrick kicked ass as the T-1000, because he was naturally menacing, and had a lot of simple, but very snappy one-liners such as ""Hey, that's a nice bike."" It was cool because you knew what was going to happen. With Loken, the cleverest line you hear her say is ""I like your car."" Wow, momma! I'm so excited I'm hyper-ventilating. Let's face it, though, she had a nice body, so I guess that was enough.

I can't think of anything to say about Claire Danes, because to tell you the truth I can't even remember that much about her character. That's how much of an impact she had on me. Pretty sad, huh?

Normally you can count on Arnold to save a movie with his witticisms, but they are virtually non-existent in this film, and even the ones he does have are just lame. I.E. ""Talk to the hand."" The end is the worst part (SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER: READ NO FURTHER IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE). The T-X comes crashing through the military compound on a motorcycle, and the Terminator is standing right in front of it, and you think he's going to say something really cool, but instead he just shouts, ""YOU ARE TERMINATED."" Ooh, wow! That's some original writing, right there. Oscar winning material, indeed! (END OF SPOILER END OF SPOILER END OF SPOILER END OF SPOILER)

As for the one star, I give it to Earl Boen who briefly reprises his role as Dr. Peter Silberman from the first two films. This was the funniest part of the movie, and almost made the hole rotten tomato worth watching.

Yep, this flick was just a string of one massive let-down after another. If you are like me, and you are obsessed with the virtually spotless sentiment, originality, and intelligence of the first two films, I'd advise you to skip this one. It will just ruin the whole fantasy for you.",1095984000,7,3540,4.5046728971962615

Check it out.",1093996800,,350,4.85
1473881,5,B00005JM0B,"Here's a bit of heresy: this one was the best of the lot.

Some reasons, in brief:

1) Minimal requirement for AS to open his mouth; but nice action and makeup.

2) The story was well told, despite AS's presence, with all the right notes in the right places.

3) The 'female' terminator was great, and more menacing than its predecessor - _because_ she was so dishy.

4) Nice mix between the serious and dark, and stuff to grin about. (Could have done without some AS one-liners and the stupid shade-gags.)

5) Neat avoidance of gratuitous gore without loss of story-telling effect.

6) The development of Kate Brewster from a bewildered - already quite 'competent', but still fairly socially conformist - female into what's going to be a very kick-ass lady was nicely indicated.

7) Great end! It promises another movie: the one telling the story about the ultimate victory.

8) No resurrection of Linda Hamilton, and

9) the absence of the wide-eyed-teenage-boy-wow-! element.

10) No unnecessarily 'noble' characters. Just people who do what turn out to be very stupid things for reasons which are perfectly valid to them. (This is known as 'life' and thus believable.)

11) The transition for the stereotypical notion of the 'mainframe'/hardware-based Skynet to the 'distributed', software-based kind (a transition symbolizing that from the industrial revolution into the information age) was a touch of genius, and provided a neat rationale for the theme of this movie.

Note:

If AS becomes governor and canna do T4, it doesn't matter. Actually I hope he won't be able to do it. Stahl and Danes are quite suited to the job. It'll be a different story, but so what? It may be a _better_ story, and, for that matter, it might actually give the whole series a proper closure.

I just hope they make the T4 story consistent. It won't be easy to convince me how a few straggly humans defeat a huge army of machines, all of whom operate without a centralized 'command'. The only device that leaps to mind is a virus-disinfectant, but that would be quite unoriginal and wouldn't provide much of a story...

Just don't let Cameron loose on this. Please, please, not!

PARTICULARY WHEN I HEARD JAMES CAMERON AND EDWARD FURLONG WERENT INVOLVED. LESS THAN POWERFUL WAS AN UNDERSTATEMENT. I CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW DISSAPOINTED THE TERMINATOR SERIES FANATICS WERE WITH TERMINATOR 3 AS ITS SO OVERPRODUCED AND BADLY ACTED, FANS ARE BETTER OFF REWATCHING THE FIRST TWO FILMS OVER AND OVER AGAIN. NICK STAHL AND CLAIRE DANES ARE BOTH CAPABLE ACTORS BUT JONATHAN MOSTOW IS CERTAINLY NOT A CAPABLE DIRECTOR TO HELM SUCH A FRANCHISE. THE SADEST THING IS NOT SO MUCH THE DISSAPOINTMENT OF THE FILM, BUT THE INCREDIBLY LONG WAIT FANS HAVE HAD TO GO THROUGH TO GET TO THIS CRUMMY WORL OF BAD PERFORMANCES AND PLOT ERRORS.

1473883,2,B00005JM0B,"I have seen all three terminator movies, and T3 is my least favorite. The first two were creepy and original: a ruthless half man-half machine is sent from the future by an army of machines to terminate Sarah Connor, the future mother of John Connor, the man who will someday save earth from these machines. At the same time, the human race sends a man by the name of Kyle Reece to protect Sarah from this Terminator robot. It had an intriguing plot, cool action scenes, and an eerie feel to it.

The second is the same principle, except set several years ahead with the two persons being sent back both being terminators, one, a liquid metal super terminator sent to kill now thirteen year old John Connor, and the other, the original flesh-on-machine Terminator from T1, sent by the humans to protect him. John convinces the Terminator to help him and his mother to prevent the machines from taking over the future altogether by destroying Cyberdine industries, the company that will someday lead to the rise of the machines. But doing so won't be so easy, as John Connor, Sarah Connor and the Terminator will be opposed by police, swat forces, and the deadly liquid metal terminator that is nearly impossible to destroy. It boasts an even better plot, awesome shoot outs and action scenes, and more modern special effects that blow away the cheesy effects of T1.

T3 falls short of the standards set by its predessecors, mostly because of its bland, uninspired plot that goes absolutely nowhere with the story, doing nothing more than making room for another sequel.

The plot is basically another, more advanced Termintor is sent to the past to kill a much older John Connor. The humans send another primitive, original model Terminator that they reprogrammed to protect John Connor. Naturally, John is confused by this, as ten years ago (in T2) he and his mother destroyed Cyberdine industries, the company that would someday create the defense network that would launch nuclear war on all earth's major cities and take over the world with an army of machines. The Terminator responds, telling him that""Judgement day is inevitable."" and his mission is to take John Connor and his future wife to a place where they will be safe until after the nuclear weapons are launched. But John Connor thinks that there is a chance to prevent such from happening (again), and they all head to a military base where the evil defense network will supposedly be activated. In a nutshell, they show up too late, and John Connor and his future wife are fooled into believing that a nearby bomb shelter contains the mainframe for the evil computer network. Upon arrival they learn that the bomb shelter didn't really contain the mainframe, the Terminator completed his ultimate mission of protecting John Connor and his future wife, and planet earth is nuked and overrun by evil machines whilst Mr. and Mrs. Connor lie in the nuke-proof bomb shelter. Hence the name, ""Rise of the Machines"".

As was emphasized above, I can't help but feel as though they were just trying to make a quick buck off the franchise.  I probably wouldn't go as far as to say that it's not worth watching at all, however, as it does have a few decent action scenes that should you entertained for a while, and there are a few quirks of humor here and there, and the special effects are have improved noticably since the first two. But aside from this, T3 doesn't have much going for it. Avoid or buy cheap, preferrably used.

Note: If you haven't seen T1 or T2, you will probably have some difficulty understanding what's going on in T3. I strongly advise that you get the first two before seeing T3.",1091923200,3,3662,4.731974921630094

I should have known something was wrong when i found out that james cameron did not direct this movie. Let me explain. This really is not a part 3.... its a sort of Terminator 2 REDUX!
  Its basically the same story.. John Connor goes through all the same troubles accepting that terminators exist... and he teaches him not to be violent again... etc.. If I wanted to see terminator 2 I would rent it, or buy it... This is just a cheap knock off of the original. (Cheap special effects... the effects from part 2 are actually alot better!)
  Acting= terrible.. ( John Connors got really dorky)
  action sequences= look phony.
  story= what story? nothing intriguing what so ever (if you already saw part 2)...

i think arnold simply made this movie because the name alone will make money (one last big payday)

1473886,5,B00005JM0B,"With the exception of a few franchises, most sequel films are a resounding disappointment.  I was worried about this fact when I heard of Terminator 2, but it delivered.  The plot was a radical change from the 1984 classic, but it was pure entertainment.  So when I saw that Terminator 3 was being filmed, I was hopeful that it would deliver as well, and I wasn't disappointed.

If you're looking for something dramatic, or cerebral, it's not here.  However, it has good character development, a great script that is well-acted, plenty of action and adventure, some tongue-in-cheek humor, and special effects that are sure to please.  This is truly a guilty pleasure.

Detractors from Schwarzenneger films complain about his wooden performances, but this works in his favor in the Terminator series.  Nick Stahl and Claire Danes comprise the rest of the trio of lead protagonist actors, and each of them give convincing and well-emoted performances.  Kristanna Loken is the villian and effectively delivers an unemotional Terminator-like performance, although submitting to a gratuitous posterior nude shot that slightly detracts from the film; however, Arnold did the same thing although his posterior remained in the shadows, thankfully.

In short, if you enjoyed the original and the sequel, this film will not disappoint.  I hope that the trend will continue with Terminator 4.",1091232000,,1381,5.2318181818181815

1473919,4,B00005JM0B,"T3 takes off from where T2 ended. John Connor(Nick Stahl) is now a nomad, invisible in the society with no connection at all to his past. He is still paranoid about his reclusiveness and the future, which he views with trepidation. Yet it isn't enough to ward off another threat by Skynet, the AI super computer that unleashes a new bot called the T-X in the form of a woman (Kristanna Loken). Only one thing stands in its way to setting the course of Judgement Day....Arnie.
T3 on its own is a good movie. Really. It is astonishing to see Arnold this fit even at this age. You cannot diffrentiate him from his appearance in T2. Nick Stahl as Connor and Claire Danes, who acts as his love interest,as Kate Brewster, take their characters to heart . However, I wouldn't say the same for Kristanna. She is a bit too lame for a role that Robert Patrick immortalized as the amazing T-1000. She doesn't have the fierceness that Patrick had. Only one expression, is carried through the entire movie.
Neverthless,T3 is surprising in many ways. The movie is wittier and more subjective. The story takes a total U-turn from the original theme. Judgement-Day 'does' happen and Connor and Kate are the one of the few left to contemplate the horrors of the 'nuclear-mad' Skynet. How they cope and what will be the final Judgement Day could be the story of T4, if ever it does come out.
Johnathan Mostow (Director) may not have the flair of James Cameron (T2). But he brings in all his experience from 'Breakdown' and 'U-571' in creating genuine tension and one truly jaw dropping chase sequence at the start of the movie. The SFX is superb and thankfully not overshown. I'd say Mostow preferred story to SFX in pushing the franchise forward and it is the right decision. It remains to be seen how this new and exciting story will be realised in the next installement coz' I don't see how T3 would be viewed as the last of the Terminator series.

want to do any more Terminator films, so did they need to conti-

gger's last flick Collateral Damage, this one is just inferior
rehases of his better films like the first two Terminator's and
Predator, and Total Recall, which are better films. Schwarzenegger does his best as usual, but he feels like such
a wimp here. His Terminator character is too much of a wussie
here. All he does here is spout cliched one liners, while the
character of John Connor (Played this time by Nick Stahl) is
being stalked by the T-X Terminatrix (Played by a beautiful loo-
king Kristanna Loken). She is the only one who tries to provide new material for the Terminator franchise. The ending is also too depressing and anti climactic for the series. The Matrix
Revolutions was disappointing, but at least that ended more in
a way that was satisfying, this just feels too rushed and unfi-
nished. Like The Alien series, this should have stopped after the second one. Schwarzenegger still has talent, but he is re-
duced to doing cliched flicks. You want a great action movie
see The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, and Crouching Tiger Hidden
Dragon. You want Nick Stahl's best performance see Todd Field's
In The Bedroom and HBO's miniseries Carnivale. As for this,
skip this one and see the first two Terminator films.

Considering the special effects capability of modern film, they could have done a much more entertaining film by making a precursor - a grim future where the humans fight to send Kyle Reese back to protect Sarah Connor would have been interesting, at least.  This film feels more like a rehash of the second movie, with only minor deviations from that plotline (take the same terminator, send it after John Connor, but this time instead of knives and stabbing weapons, give it a gun, and make it female).  I'd call it the worst in the terminator series.  I still bought it just to own the triology, but as a standalone film its just not very good.",1088726400,,807,4.647887323943662

T3 has a cute 'lil Terminatrix kicking outdated Arnold's a**.  The young man John Connor, who is more surly now than he was as a teen, is dragged all over kingdom come against his wishes.  He just wants to be left alone.  He does not want to be anyone's saviour.  Claire Danes is there to keep him in line along with Arnold.
There is a fine line in films between being dark, and being depressing.  T3 is dark, but it comes near the line.  In essence, T3's message is that you cannot escape your fate, no matter how hard you try.  The only thing you can do is deal with it.  It really makes you think, which bespeaks well for the film.  I think a T4 is in order to bring back some of the hope for humanity that this third film took away from the first two films, and indeed that the last ten years have taken away from the innocent early '90's in this country.

Why oh why????
Almost everything was terrible.
The new John Connor was not good at all. Claire is cute at most but definitely couldn't fit this role if her life depended on it. The Terminatrix acting was great but a female terminator is just corny. They knew they couldn't top the sick liquid metal villian in part 2 so they figured hey we need something NEW.
Why not a female terminator? NO
Her expressions and acting were good for playing an unemotional terminator and she did the best she could with the screenplay.
By the way, shes drop dead gorgeous.
Ending was depresssing- sets up a Terminator 4 where John COnnor becomes the leader??? (...)
 (...) THATS THE ONLY THING T3 SHOULD HAVE AND COULD HAVE BEEN. WHAT OTHER POSSIBLE STORYLINE COULD TAKE PLACE. AND TECHNICALLY THEY ENDED IT WITH T2 ANYWAY!!!!
doesn't make sense.
SO FOR MONEY????? They repeat the same Terminator 2 storyline.????
TERRIBLE. i cant express how horrible the concepts in this film are.
IF they wanted to make a part 3 of these classic movies and some how make everything that happened in part 2 completely pointless, at least set it up in the future with sick special effects, a tough lookin John Connor destroyin the endo-skeleton terminators, flying machines, and a couple T1000's. That would make more sense????
Plus people are sayin Arnold looked good for his age.
Granted hes older and he can't really hide his signs of aging that well, but the only reason he was in good shape was because he lost a lot of weight for the role. Compare body sizes in all 3 of the films.
BOTTOM LINE-
Half descent movie at most if u watch the film without knowledge of the first 2 films and just want to watch an action no-brainer that makes no sense.
But compared to the first 2 this is COMPLETE GARBAGE, CRAP, DISGUSTING WRITING AND TERRIBLE ACTING.

Sequels are great.

This was a fun film and does not take itself too seriously. Arnie is in good form when he arrives into the past from the future, butt naked, with ripling muscles. Not bad for a guy in his fifties! Kristanna Loken is great as the leather clad deadly T-X robot. There is possibly one of the longest car chase sequences in cinema history involving a huge crane and a fire engine.

Arni was paid a pile for this but he really wasn't used to his full potential.  Linda Hamilton declined to appear and thats where the storyline falls flat. Still the dry humor but the focus was, naturally on, John Connor(Nick Stahl) and his future wife, Cate, played by Claire Danes.
Kristianna Lokken makes her debut as the new TX but the smash up vehicle chase scene was boring and repiditive. John is mystifed why Arnie is back, but he soon explains and tells him that John in the future is dead, being murdered by himself and it was his wife that sent him back to tell.
The revealation at the end was good, however, as we now know that we could not stop the end of mankind as it was a computer virus that set the whole thing off.  The fact that John and Cate are left in an old NORAD bunker fitted with old technology tells us that T4, if it is ever made, will focus on the battle to send Kyle Reece and the two ""good"" Arnies back.

1474111,4,B00005JM0B,"I like this movie much better than I expected to like it.

Why wouldn't I expect to like it? Five reasons offhand: No James Cameron. No Linda Hamilton. No Brad Fiedel score. No Edward Furlong. And (as of T2) no future for the Terminators to come back from.

But Jonathan Mostow has done a pretty good job with this one. Not perfect -- for example, I don't find Kristanna Loken's T-X anywhere near as menacing as Robert Patrick's T-1000 -- but it's not bad at all. And his non-sappy ending returns the Terminator series to its pessimistic tech-noir roots.

Nick Stahl's okay as John Connor; I miss Furlong, but Stahl looks as though he could actually _be_ the love child of Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn. And Claire Danes is surprisingly effective as Kate Brewster, John's future second-in-command and spouse. Marco Beltrami's score is good too, although I still miss the main theme from the old one. (We hear Beltrami's arrangement of it over the closing credits, but that's it.)

Arnold, of course, is Arnold, and he's still why we watch. The stunts and special effects are very good.

I won't spoil the ending for you, but the outcome of this one may surprise you. In fact, it restores quite a bit of what T2 undid.

The omitted 'Sgt. Candy scene' is delightful, but it's by far the best item in the bonus materials. Generally, on the Terminator DVDs, the deleted scenes are helpful in understanding certain plot points; this one's no exception.

There are a lot of good ideas in the movie and they work well but it just doesn't feel the same.  Don't get me wrong it's still a good attempt, but I didn't feel satisfied.

1474114,3,B00005JM0B,"With Arnie now settling in as Governor of California, it looks unlikely that he'll ever appear in another Terminator episode, at least not in a physically demanding role. (Somehow I can't see the civilisation of the future bothering to beam a grandpa back to the present day.)
So, unless another actor takes the lead role, we're left with the somewhat sotto voce ending of John and Catherine holed up underground while all above ground are obliterated by nuclear war. It's hardly worth getting your children educated, or bothering to contribute to a pension, if that's what's going to happen in the next decade. Could it happen?
Well, rather topically, the movie came out at a time when the world was suffering from a wave after wave of computer viruses -- myDoom, SoBig etc. Given that it is a supervirus that kick-starts SkyNet into its world domination opportunity, we might worry that Bill Gates will somehow be responsible for the end of the world.
Plot-wise, this movie takes up the story fairly smoothly from where T2 left off. Even if you've done the Terminator ride at Universal Studios, you won't feel that there are glaring problems with the plot of T3. The trouble is that this logical consistency means that there isn't anything wonderfully innovative about this film. The new female terminator arrives with no fundamental improvements in her powers (or special effects) over the liquid metal temrinator of T2. Linda Hamilton's character has unfortunately been lost to cancer, and John Connor finds a vet with whom he 'made out' when they were both 13.
There are some nice bits of humour -- Arnie visiting a male strip club, ""Talk to the hand"", his obsession with getting the right shades etc. And there are some great action set pieces -- particularly the lorry/crane chase. The punch-up in the toilet stretches its viewing certificate worryingly close to the limit, particularly when she kicks Arnie's head almost clean off. Despite the violence, it occurred to me that this film is really Wonderwoman meets the Six Million Dollar Man updated for the noughties.
But I just don't think there's much magic left in the series.",1081728000,,2138,4.925207756232687
1474115,3,B00005JM0B,"I have to say, when it was first release in Malaysia, some like it and some don't. I for one was apparent a little bias because the Terminator was created by James Cameron vision. Jonathan Mostow on the other hand was trying to be better than what Cameron did. Somehow it fail in the sense that its not only action all the way, but the essence of the series just concluded by itself instead of just what Cameron gives us viewers a chance to see what the future would be... in our own hands.
But let's get to the movie first on this DVD. The movie isn't the best and yet, isn't the worst. It has its qualities - humor, action & twist. Other than that, the movie starts off with a B-Graded feel with an ending that gives us fans an ending. But is anyone satisfied? To me, its like killing off the franchise. We can't avoid the future? Its fated that these machines will fight us to the death? And everything in what we believe in means there is no point in fighting to stop a future that is already written even many times? Well, I'm sure James Cameron will be dissapointed with this 2nd sequel. So are the fans. But then again, if you take it as an entertainment value, its good enough to enjoy.
Now comes the extras. 1 deleted scene (Sgt. Candy Scene) and it explains why most T-101s looks like Arnold. Thank you for the deletion. The documentaries... truthfully, I slept through it. The gag reel isn't that funny. But other than that, its just okay for me.
To add in with your collection? Why not, at least its much better that ""Terminator 2: Jughment Day (Extreme DVD)"" edition. So just look at what T-3 has to offer for you first before you decide whether to buy or not. As for me, I bought it because I like the Terminator series.",1081468800,,1734,4.3058103975535165

The T-101 model terminator (Arnold Schwarzeneggar) comes from the future to protect John Connor (Nick Stahl), the future savior of the human race, from a more advanced model (Kristanna Loken) sent to destroy him.  This time, it happens simultaneously with the long-dreaded ascendance of Skynet and the revolt of the machines.
T3 lacks the freshness of T1 and the intelligence and human drama of T2, but it certainly delivers as a special-effects laden thrill ride.  It also benefits from some genuinely unexpected events toward the end of the film.  Very entertaining.",1081296000,,599,5.208333333333333
1474117,3,B00005JM0B,"For those who don't follow the Terminator series or who have not seen the first two movies then this will be a great flick to watch.  But for those who are fans of the Terminator story and love the first two moves, this is a dissapointment.
First of all, let me acknowlege that this is a great movie.  It is very well done.  However, the plot is a far cry from what a Terminator movie should be.  One dissapointing factor is the special effects.  They are well done but over used.  T2 pulled special effects off right.  Using computer animation just enough to get the point across and not come off looking cheesy or fake.  In T3 it is obvious that computers were used and at several points it is completely obvious that Arnold Shcwarzenneggar is fake.  Particularly in the crane scene.  The other terminator is completely fake when she comes out of her skin and it looks really dumb.
Another point of disapointment is in how the Terminator finds his cloths.  Getting dressed is a staple of the series.  In T1, the termiator beats up some punks for his wardrobe.  In T2 he walks into a bar and beats up a bunch of bikers.  See the them so far?  In T3 guess what he does?  Beats up some bikers?  Slaughters some people and takes everything they have?  No.  He goes into a bar at ladies night and ruffs the clothing away from a homosexual male dancer.  How stupid is that.
At several points in the movie as well director Jonathan Mostow tried to add humor, but he ended up making just cheesy one liners.  Arnold is know for one liners, but they are usually not a stupid as this.
A disapointing factor in the plot I found was that the new Terminator was actually a terminator designed to terminate terminators.  That is so non-creative.  They would have been better off keeping them both original T100 or T100s.
The movie does have good points though.  You get to see more of the history of the terminators and in this way, the movie does add to the terminator story well.  There is a more detailed history of SkyNet and how it came to be.  You even get to see the actual takeover of SkyNet.  There are many intersting new technologies that keep up with how we run lives today, such as the way the terminator can link up to databases through the cell phone.  Although this a fresh idea, I think it makes the movie too timely.  T2 is completely timeless and it can be watched and not make you think about ""what life was like then,"" as T3 is sure to do 10 years from now when someone will watch it and go ""haha, look how funny cell phones looked back then.""
T3 is a well made movie and I will give it that.  But it is a shambles of what it should have been.  It is HUGE dissipointment if you are a big fan of the first two movies.  If you can watch it without thinking back to thw other movies and becomming angry as I did, then you can enjoy it.

1474118,4,B00005JM0B,Rise of the Machines was just as much fun to watch as the first two. The Governator had a machine gun and he was shooting it. Plus his face was practically ripped off leaving only his metalic skull showing. What more do you want? T3 had intense robot battles and lots of high tech special effects. I myself am not too big on tons and tons of computer generated images. The CGI and the fact that the movie was a bit slow at times lead to me giving it a 4 out 5. But the fights are awesome and the intensity is high. I think Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines fits nicely with the other two and I am hoping for a T4.

1474119,1,B00005JM0B,"Seriously, my only real complaint with this movie is the special effects. T2 was made over 10 years ago, and still looks like one of the best FX jobs on the plannet. Ever. I thought at least for T3 they'd have realized this high standard and tried to compete with it. Through the whole move I was flinching from the half-assed production. I'm thinking that most of the $170+ million, or whatever it was, went to Arnie. So they turned post production over to the local computer club, gave them $50, and said ""Please make this look decent. It's all the money we have!""
Enough ranting I guess, the rest of the movie is decent, and even slightly unpredictable. You can see influences from the other Terminator movies, and from other movies that this mutha would be competing with. Still... digital effects (especially crummy ones) can't save a movie.",1080691200,7,846,4.684563758389261
1474177,4,B00005JM0B,"...of course, my expectations were not that it was going to be better or even as good at T2. There was just no way that would happen. So I was expecting it to be as good as Demolition Man or something(which I thought was just ok).
Turns out, T3 was way better than Demolition Man! And I personally thought it was as good as the first Terminator movie.
We had awesome action sequences(especially the chase with the crane!), witty one-liners(which every Arnold movie MUST have!), and a decent plot that didn't seem as depressing as one would think it would be. Nick Stahl was great as John Conner. He's a better actor than Edward Furlong, although he doesn't look much like what Eddy looks like. Claire Daines was a good new character too. The T-X was the hottest robot I've ever seen, and she was one tough machine! But I'm glad they didn't make a big deal out of her, and focused more on the plot of judgement day.
[SPOILER]
And the twist of the T-800(Arnold) killing John Connor in the future, as well as judgement day actually happening sets us up for a great new kind of new Terminator movie for T4(if it gets made), because it could take place in a post-apocolyptic world with the human surviors battling against the machines. It wouldn't be the classic ""good terminator gets sent back in time to protect Connor/bad terminator gets sent back in time to kill Connorz"" scenario. It could be taken to a whole other level because of the plot of T3!

I'd like to see alot more woman become action stars, there sure isn't enough of them, but this new terminator is hardly threatning at all, and unlike in T2 with the t-1000..this soupposed new upgraded terminator looks more downgraded!
A new Terminator has been sent back to not just kill John Conner but also another leader of the resistance and a bunch of other people too! And of coarse Arnold is sent back once more as a terminator to protect them.
The movie suffered in alot of plot ideas IMO, I don't care that Arnold returned...with few SFX shots gave some great action seaqunces, the SFX where no where near as impressive as the ground breaking SFX that T2 provided us with! This plot also rueins the whole genre of the Terminator. Particuly the most i did not like was the ending to this film. The ending IMO has been rueind, and has created a non beleivable ending, unlike the last 2 movies. If they make a 4th movie, they should consider highly about going back in time to prevent the events that happend in this film, other wise this movie has rueind the terminator story lines IMO.
Rent it first, many people judge this movie on Arnie and a female in tight cloths to sell a sexy image rather then concentrate on important and significant things to make the movie beleiable. The begining is kind of cool, then it drifts, then its going no where, then it picks up, then the end ruens the entire saga! Only a 4th movie can fix the bad idea on how to finish this film IMO!
Bonus features are forgetable, and its no wonder they cut a few of the deleted scenes, if they had have been included the movie would have done harm to the terminator saga even further!",1080000000,,2371,4.4528735632183905
1474181,5,B00005JM0B,"I pride myself on my ability to sniff a bad movie out before it hits the screens. After seeing so many movies, reading so many magazines (like Time, Entertainment Weekly, and Cinescape) and listening to so many interviews, you start to realize before a picture even hits the theaters when something is wrong.
I'm also a big fan -- I helped create the Terminator: Future Fate D20 Modern campaign setting. What, you haven't gotten a copy? It's free! Go! Go right now and get it (under Freebies)!
With Terminator 3, my Spidey sense was tingling.
The majority of interviews all centered on ""how great it is to work with Mr. Schwarzenegger."" Uh huh. That's nice. Whenever a director talks about how great the movie is, I get suspicious.
Then there's the, ""we've made a new Terminator and she's a BAAAAAAAABE!"" This idea already hit the comics and novels. But really, why? Why make her a beautiful woman? Is this going to be The Hidden all over again? The Hidden was great -- but it gave a reason for why the bad guy took on a luscious female form. And don't even get me started on calling her a Terminatrix.
And why bring Arnie again? My idea, which was used in the Terminator series of novels out now, was to have Arnie play himself as a human character in present time who is the model for Terminators. Glad S.M. Sterling agrees it's a good idea.
So, with all those thoughts going through our heads, Maleficent and I took in a matinee. Whenever we suspect a movie might suck, we go to a matinee so we don't feel like we were suckered. And...
We were pleasantly surprised. Terminator 3 is really quite good. It is not as good, in my opinion, as Terminator 2. Maleficent liked Terminator 3 better (she hated the squeaky punk in Terminator 2).
This movie follows a T-X (get it, Terminator-X or Terminatrix, although that's a term used only by Connor) who has gone backwards in time to kill all the lieutenants of John Connor since Skynet can't find him.
Right away, we know something is different. The T-X has a blue lighting scheme. Her interface looks more like a Windows environment than the old red-code Terminators. She moves with the same eerie patience that the T-1000 did. For the most part, she's expresionless. When she reacts at all, it's disturbing. A scary, beautiful woman. Go figure.
The reason for the change is because the future has changed. Skynet's birth came and went. If you saw the last two movies, the world was supposed to have gone to nuclear war already. But thanks to Sarah, Judgment Day didn't happen. Not yet, anyway.
Arnold is unbelievably bulked up. I thought maybe they digitally inserted his head on a younger man's body. Nope -- it's him. Naked. 50 years old and the man is bulked. I fear anyone dating his daughters (does he even have daughters?).
The movie doesn't take itself too seriously. It focuses on the chase scenes, the running combat between the two Terminators, and the slow recognition of the whole scary plot by Kate Brewster, John's future wife.
The movie makes several propositions, which I found interesting. For one, it implies that history is self-correcting. Although John didn't meet Kate right away, he met her again a decade later anyway. Although Skynet wasn't built as a mechanical fortress, it was created as a virus over the Internet instead. In short, the future is NOT what you make of it. It all HAS to happen. It's just a matter of WHEN.
The director, Jonathan Mostow, recognizes his core audience. We've all seen Terminator 2. We know how Arnie got his clothes last time. This time, he walks naked into a bar with another fat guy with another shotgun guarding the entrance...and he says without blinking an eye, ""You're early, go around back."" Now the audience is confused. Why isn't he surprised Arnie's naked? We get the answer in a strip club for ladies who are hooting and shouting at the stripper on stage -- who just happens to match Arnie's dimensions. You've got to appreciate a movie that's willing to laugh at itself.
Although it has an ""R"" rating, this movie isn't that gory. The moments of possible nudity are actually covered up (no, you don't get to see frontal nudity on the Terminatrix). Almost like they were trying hard to make it acceptable for parents to bring their kids to see it. Hmmm.
The ending is very well done. I say this a lot -- this is one of those movies that had the strength of its convictions. There's a logical, unpopular conclusion to the events going on in Terminator 3. The movie embraces them.
If you're looking for a good popcorn movie and want to see robots beat each other up, this is a film worth seeing. If you're a Terminator fan and want to see more adventures set in the wild and wacky timeline that is constitutes the Terminator universe -- this is a MUST SEE.",1079913600,,4770,4.606345475910693

This was the 1st terminator movie that I have seen that was in the theatres. My only other terminator experience was T2: 3D that's at the Universal theme parks, but the movie didn't have the most complex storyline, and I knew the basics, so I figured out most of it. How was the movie? The special effects were great. Industrial Light and Magic did it again. Besides from that, the dialogue was weak, the story was very predictable, and they told you what would happen next in the movie constantly so there were no suprizes. It also seemed like Arnold wrote himself out of the series if they do make a next one by killing his robot self and the world was basically destroyed at the end of the movie.",1079654400,,938,4.427745664739884
1474183,1,B00005JM0B,"This movie is pretty atrocious.  The wuss they dredged up to be John Conner ought to actually be shot by a terminator.  The sharp, wannabe-machine-like motions need to stop.  The woman-terminator thing was idiotic, given it's just a pathetic gimmick and the fact that it wasn't intimidating at all.  The technological advances of the T-300,000,000 or whatever it was were not amply described or developed, not to mention the moronic little concept to have nanomachines control cars is just plain boring; we've seen all that nonsense before.  The plot was actually decent i daresay, but was mostly botched due to the absolutely relentless pace of the movie.
On top of all this, i just got the sensation while watching it that the subject wasn't being dealt with seriously, nor was i as an audience member.  The clever little surprise ending also was incredibly weak, given what could have been done with it.  The movie seemed like a 1st graders art collage, with a thousand different pointless things glued on with no rhyme or reason, and in the end leaving an ugly, haphazard mess.
My favorite two scenes were these: 1) the bathroom fight-scene, which was really stupid, but, i hesitate to admit, also funny as hell 2) a scene in the mobile home where claire danes gives an absolutely gorgeous smile.  And i think that says it all.  This is an action movie, yet my favorite scene was just that because of a woman smiling.  You just gotta do better than that.  Thanks, whatever nobody directed this, for taking a serious, and compelling subject and reducing it to more hollywood moneygrubbing tripe bloated with special effects but destitute of substance and impoverished of human emotion of any kind.  The thing that made Terminator and Terminator 2 so good was that they weren't composed solely of fluff, but they had a message, and it was carried through an excellent medium.  Where those two movies both riled our hearts with excitement and touched them with a sense of empathy and concern, this one does neither, and leaves us feeling empty.",1079308800,21,2045,4.841954022988506

1474185,3,B00005JM0B,"He promised he'd be back, and he is in ""Terminator 3-Rise of the Machines,"" the third and probably final installment in the franchise that made Austrian weightlifter turned actor turned politician Arnold Schwarzenegger a household name. Why do I think this film is the last in the series? Because, primarily due to Arnie's abrupt reversal in his views about onscreen violence. ""Terminator 3"" isn't a great film. Before he had kids and decided to run for public office, Schwarzenegger had few problems blowing away hundreds of people in films like ""The Terminator,"" ""Commando,"" ""The Running Man,"" ""Predator,"" and several other 1980's actioners. What a difference a few years make. I knew Arnold had taken a turn for the worse when I witnessed the horrific ""Junior,"" but the disintegration had begun years before. Schwarzenegger's dogged pledge to minimal onscreen killing essentially doomed any ""Terminator"" sequels. Granted, number two worked well because it employed Linda Hamilton, had James Cameron at the helm, and worked wonders with special effects. Sadly, ""Terminator 3"" does not have Linda Hamilton, does not have James Cameron at the helm, and the special effects aren't as good as what we saw in the second film. What a pity.
John Connor (Nick Stahl in this outing) survived the events in the second film and is now a young adult with serious issues. Always fearful of any unexpected robotic deliveries from the future, he's dropped out of society in a big way. Connor doesn't have a phone number, avoids credit cards and other traceable technologies, and floats from menial job to menial job. His mother Sarah died of leukemia several years ago in Mexico, thus leaving her son to fend for himself in a world that he fears. John can never shake the feeling that he and his mother failed to prevent Judgment Day, and he is about to discover feelings have a way of becoming real. Sure enough, a termination unit appears on the scene. This time out, it's the new and improved T-X machine (played by sexy Kristanna Loken), a robot wrapped up in the guise of a female capable of controlling other machines and sprouting weapons from its body. Fortunately for John Connor, the humans in the future managed to send back another Arnie terminator to serve as a personal bodyguard. From here on out the movie is your typical chase and destroy vehicle, as Arnie and the T-X battle their way through various settings.
The plot makes a few digressions with the introduction of Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), an old childhood sweetheart of John Connor who just happens to meet up with her old flame when John robs the veterinary clinic where she works. Moreover, Brewster's Dad just happens to be the military guy in charge of Skynet and a new generation of robotic weaponry instantly familiar to fans of the first two films. See how it all comes together? Arnie ends up protecting Brewster and Connor from the deadly attentions of the T-X. When queried by Connor and Brewster about Judgment Day, Arnold explains that nuclear annihilation is inevitable, and that Sarah and her son only postponed the inevitable when they destroyed the T-1000 in the second film. Since the world is about to go into the wastebasket, it is Arnold's mission to get Brewster and Connor to a safe location before the bombs fall. Predictably, our heroes aren't about to accept the fate of the world lying down. They convince Arnie to escort them to the military base where Kate's father is about to put Skynet online. If they can get there in time, they might succeed in averting disaster. Meanwhile, the T-X stalks them with relentless, ruthless precision. The conclusion to the film displays lots of explosions, nicely done special effects (again, not as good as the second film), and a few mild twists and turns.
""Terminator 3"" could have been a great film. I fervently hoped it would attain greatness. Alas, the movie achieves only a rating of merely good. Of course, the biggest problem is Arnie's inability to mow down people. Let's face it--we all loved Schwarzenegger's early films where he wreaked massive destruction on scores of heavily armed thugs. You won't get any of that here. What further hurts the film is the absence of Linda Hamilton. She always gave the series a solid foundation, and the film suffers without her. They could have at least given us a cameo from Michael Biehn or Robert Patrick to serve as a touchstone to the earlier movies. Nope. The only person we see from an earlier film is the guy who played the psychologist, and even then his appearance doesn't work as well as it could. Plenty of other problems abound, including plot holes like Arnold just showing up at the veterinary clinic out of the blue, (In the other two movies, Cameron showed us HOW the terminator tracked down John and Sarah Connor. Here, he just shows up.) and the over reliance on comedic elements throughout the film. What works? That chase scene with the crane was cool, and the fistfight between the T-X and Arnie is worth watching more than once.
Give ""Terminator 3"" a chance if you liked the first two. I've sort of knocked on the movie in this review, but I probably would watch it again if I had the chance. It's sad, though. The filmmakers could have made an ultra dark, nihilistic science fiction film instead of this comedic parody of what made the franchise such a winner from the start. I blame Arnold Schwarzenegger for the film's failures; it's obvious that in order to get him to do another film, the filmmakers had to give Arnie free rein to do what he wanted instead of giving the fans what they craved. Let's hope future installments--highly unlikely, regrettably--will return to the roots of the original.",1079136000,,5704,4.827374872318693

1474258,2,B00005JM0B,"Folks, this just isn't a very good movie.  It's little more than a remake, of sorts, of Terminator 2.
Gone is any mystery and menace associated with Arnold's Terminator character.  Political correctness has turned him into a ""nice guy"" who avoids killing people at all costs (an ideological carryover from the second movie).  Lokken's female Terminator character is a rehash of the Terminator played, more effectively, by Robert Patrick in T2.  While she is a little more advanced, technologically-speaking, than T2, it takes the form of bang-and-boom weaponry than anything that really adds to the story.
The scene in the cemetary was totally unnecessary.  I mean, c'mon, that's the only place that weapons could be hidden?!?  Half that stuff you can buy on the street--or better still, do what Arnold did in the first movie and just walk into a store and steal it.  I would also add that the reintroduction of the character actor (don't know his name) who played the psychiatrist in the first two movies just doesn't work.  I'm sure the makers thought it would draw big laughs, but it only drew a couple of snickers in the audience that I was among.
While the introduction scene for Arnold--in a strip club--is amusing, it, too, has become a tired imitation from the original.
Of course, you have the highway chase and destroy scene.  Visually it is an eyeful, but even it is rather mundane since it is so over the top.  Other special effects are outstanding, as you would expect.  But they should have spent more on a better story, instead.
The John Connor character acts more like a whining momma's boy than a savior of the world, and his new girlfriend doesn't add much to his persona.
Obviously, this movie is simply setting the stage for yet another sequel and, hopefully, an actual resolution to the story.  Let's hope they actually do it right next time.  I also wouldn't mind seeing Kyle Reece, played by Michael Biehn in the original, reintroduced for the final chapter.",1077580800,3,1981,4.808259587020649

Let's just skip onto say T19, the baddest momma out.  I mean, these things are from the future, right?  How come they keep sending ""last year's"" model?  Or is George Bush V running skynet?
And how come these ""future"" terminators had such a problem with the terminators of the day?

You go through life without a care in the world. But these things won't last. Why? Judgment Day. Imagine a world of complete darkness where man's destiny is controlled by machines and super computers. Sound familiar? It should because this is the backdrop of the entire Terminator series. The original Terminator cost an estimated $7 million but went on to gross $40 million at the box office. It became so popular on video that Terminator 2: Judgment Day was created, helmed by James Cameron. With a production budget of $100 million, T2 went on to gross $204 million, so it was a no brainer to make another sequel, right? Well, it took them 12 years and a reported $175 million budget but T3 has finally arrived in theaters just in time for the 4th of July holiday. But will Rise of the Machines continue the success of the popular franchise or will this result in its fall?
The story goes that the life of John Connor, the leader of the resistance movement that defeats the machines, is in danger once again. But this time he is not the only target. A T-X Terminator, the most advanced killing machine created by the Skynet network, has been sent to the year 2001 to kill the lieutenants of the future human resistance as well as John Connor himself. But John will be harder to locate because he has been living off the grid for nearly ten years. By having no cell phone, no home, and no real identity, the Skynet network is less able to track him down should the time come. Though he and his mother, Sarah Connor, prevented Judgment Day from occurring on August 29th, 1997 when they prevented the creation of the network, he still lives in fear that the end of the world still may come. He fears are correct as the T-X is looking for him but a T-850, like the one sent to kill him before he was born, has been sent by the resistance movement to ensure his survival. The events that occurred in T2: Judgment Day didn't prevent Judgment Day, it just delayed it. Within three hours, nearly 3 billion human lives will be destroyed in an instant. Now John Connor must team up with the Terminator and his future wife to try and prevent Judgment Day once again. The story for T3 is not as fabulous as the one done for T2 but with James Cameron not directing this time around, did anybody really expect it to be? Having the opening of the film focus on the thoughts of John Connor and then flash forward to a battle between machines and man was a good way to start off the picture. There are a couple of holes in the plot of the film that could have explained why certain things happen within the film but they really aren't a huge matter for the film. The ending to the film was also well done but more could have been shown.
The only returning cast member from Terminator 2 is Arnold Schwarzenegger reprising his role as the T-850 Terminator that he made famous nearly twenty years ago. Once again Arnold works extremely well with this role. Though more of the character was done using CGI then in the other previous films, Schwarzenegger still provides an emotional voice to the character in those types of situations. Edward Furlong, who played young John Connor in T2, was dropped from the project when the studio believed that his drug and alcohol problems would delay production, so Nick Stahl was brought in to replace him in the role. Stahl is the not the perfect replacement but still does a very good job with the character. Kristanna Loken is the new villain in the Terminator franchise playing the role of the T-X Terminator, Skynet's most sophisticated killing machine. She is very plain with her emotion which is good since she plays a machine. The only problem with her character is the questions left unanswered. Her character is made of liquid metal but at one point during the film a part of her is damaged prevent the use of a primary weapon but the film doesn't explain why this happens. But that really has more to do with the plot then with her. Claire Danes rounds out the rest of the main cast as the future wife of John Connor. There weren't that many scenes with in the course of the film that really focus on her, which is good since John is more of the focus, but most of the scenes that she was involved in were well done. The introduction of her character and the whole idea of destiny (her and John meeting and eventually getting married) was a good twist to the story.
Overall, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a good summer popcorn film. T3 doesn't even come close to the majesty of T2 and for several reasons. The dialogue is much less serious then T2 but this was to be expected with James Cameron not at the helm this time around. The plot holes presented in the film also hurt the overall effect. There is no clear explanation on what Skynet is exactly and how it is able to control the machines if there is no core. There are also unanswered questions involving how John Connor and the Terminator are able to enter a secret military area with no problems at all. This doesn't seem to really matter as all Hell breaks loose soon after. The film is also less dramatic then the first sequel and plays more for just action and laughs but that seems to work on its own level. There were many humorous moments in the film with some working like the statements made by the T-850 replying to situations that machines can't understand. But there were also moments that didn't work. For example, the T-X inflates her breasts to get the attention of a cop who pulls her over. This was unnecessary as the cop didn't even seem to notice. Besides some minor complaints, there are many things that work for the film. The fact that Jonathan Mostow makes this his own film instead of just trying to copy what James Cameron did in T2 is fabulous. The action sequences were well done and the special effects were just absolutely amazing especially at the very end of the film. Speaking of the ending, it was a little disappointing that the film makers ended the film the way they did but that allows them to follow up with a fourth Terminator film and not give away too much. T3 may not be the best film out there but it is still a great film to enjoy over the holiday weekend.",1077148800,,6335,4.452667814113597

1474332,2,B00005JM0B,"Although cliche at times, Terminator 2: Judgment Day became a mountain of a movie, thanks to a terrific performance by Robert Patrick as the stealth T-1000 advanced killer, as well as our new reprogrammmed hero, the T-101 (Schwarzenegger). Since those events that took place in 1991, John Connor has lost his mother, Sarah, to lukemia. He's a young man now, living away from the grid of society, and drifting endlessly through America on a motorbike.
 In the wake of the city night, a shapely nude female (Kristanna Loken) emerges from time travel, and kills a civilian, taking her leather body suit and car. She's the new Terminator, the T-X. More advanced and lethal than the T-1000, it can change it's appearence and multiple weapons at will. Kind of like a sexy walking 'Guns ""R"" Us'. Elsewhere, Arnold materializes out from time travel in the desert, and again finds duds in a strip bar that look better than his other two leather ensembles from both movies. The T-101 has good taste.
John breaks into a vet lab for some pain killers after a motorcycle accident. The veterinarian, Kate Brewster (Claire Daines) arrives to investigate and discovers Connor, who are then both discovered by the T-X. They are near mincemeat status when Arnold shows up and drives his stolen 4x4 into her head on. Owch. Connor is stunned to see another T-101 save his hide for a second time. He finds a way to convince the new victim, Kate, about the future and who he is, and who John will become, although it understandably takes a while.
After a healthy start, the chase is on as out female T-X stops for nothing to eliminate John and Kate as their existence in the future jeopardizes all machines. There's plenty of running around and a clumsy truck/car chase that's not very interesting. A lot of the fight sequences are quick and dealt with. Arnold and Loken also get in a fist fight for a moment that turns into a throw around. Oh, what a fight (yawwwwwn). How many times the two humans duck energy blasts and missles, or yell, ""Run for it!"" is beyond me. There's no outsmarting or clever sequences, minus one near the end. The effects are more than great, animation, explosions, you name it. This is how the movie holds itself afloat to some point.
Terminators, regardless of what model they are, should almost kill you with their stare, or even physique. Loken is the new villan, and given the title, she delivers only moderate shivers. Mechanically, she has the stare and walk of a Terminator down pat-you bet, and her act does convince us quite well. Her T-X is not very intense and doesn't scare us as much as Robert Patrick's stealth T-1000. Schwarzenegger gets good marks for his beefy T-101 Terminator, and even though he ""is the one"" to play this role, I sometimes curl an 'oh brother' smirk when I listen to the cyborg relenquish a Belgian accent.
Stahl gives a neat change with the role of John Connor, who, because of the scenarios that he went through with his mother, one protector Terminator, and one killer Terminator, seems more in a state of disbelief and drunk from sadness. Claire Danes also has a neat performance as a young woman who would soon realize what the future holds, and without making her another She-Rambo, toughens up, but realistically.

There is something missing in this movie that a lot of people don't immediately recognize. For John and Kate, Judgement Day is unavoidable. It was only delayed from last time. The fear of what it will bring is only moderately considered by the two humans. Most people would be so hysterical, knowing that it's guaranteed the world will be obliterated, minus a few thousand humans. The amount of pure dread from these two is hardly enough.
This movie would have been much better, say, if we took a trip into the bleak future, where humans are scattered across the lands, and machines seem unstoppable. That would have made a great movie and should have been the premise of this third installment. Personally, the time travel thing is enough.
The only way, besides showcasing great effects and some neat tricks, ""T3"" does give us an ending that could have been more devestating, but still gives us a shiver. This is really the only time in the movie where Stahl and Danes finally inject a lot of fear into the horrifying inevitable. T3 is not very impressive, and I wished that the ending, although effective, was even deeper.",1076803200,,4388,4.727154046997389

Stahl was a joke as Connor. His future self looked hideous and hilarious. He doesn't look like a hero and Edward Furlong is sorely missed. Claire Danes as his girlfriend/future wife was lame.  She was no Sarah Connor and never would be. Linda Hamilton was also missed, but she was smart enough to stay away from a great story turned action comedy.
The female terminator was simply a device to get young boys interested, but lacked Patrick's menace, and at the end they make her seem more like a alien monster than a machine with all that animalistic screaming.
Arnold tried to be the Terminator again, but many lines fell flat. He too played a parody of his old character. He was also too old for the part and it showed in his face.

1474336,3,B00005JM0B,"This is a movie that simply past it's prime. It's a movie that should have been made long ago and today simply capitalizes on the previous success of the series and plenty of action and special effects to bring in crowds.
First of all the movie was NOT made by James Cameron (the creator and director of the other 2 terminator movies). This is the main reason why T3 is so bad in comparison to the other movies. There is no hint of Camerons style. T2 in particular had a distinct ""feel"" to the movie - a blend of action, mild humor, and an epic theme that melded together into a style that just worked well. T3 without cameron is like a child without a father and suffers from this in a very apparent way as can be seen in it's flawed delivery.
The plot has arnold returning as a reprogramed terminator on a mission to defend John Conner (once again) from death at the hands of an even deadlier terminator - the female TX. We learn that judgment day was not stopped by the events of the last movie (big shock), only posponed. The mission now is not to stop judgment day, but to survive it. The addition of connor's future wife and 2nd in command into the plot is intriguing, yet with the exception of a few moments, this was never expanded upon in the movie as much as it could have been.
The TX is even more advanced than the T1000 of T2, and sports some nifty nano technology that lets her control other machines as well as morph her physical form into complex weapons - a logical progression from the last ""new"" teminator bad guy. This lends itself to an abundant amount of cool special effects, although some of the effects are a bit too flashy and feel like the sort of CGI you'd expect from an intro sequence to a video game. The fights between arnold and the TX are pretty hard hitting, with some good action sequences... it's great when they bust each other up, though this is a little over used throughout the entirety of T3.
At the bottom of my frustration with this movie is that the whole scenario of 2 terminators sent back in time feels old and done already. In many ways T3 felt too much like a remake of T2, without any of the human elements that made T2 so great. I also could not help but cringe at the acting here. The acting barely passes for decent through most of the movie, while in several places the acting is downright awful. I couldn't help laughing a few times at some of the just plain corny lines, and in particular arnold's all-around poor performance. Besides that, most of T3 felt a bit rushed, while the action was almost non-stop, the moments inbetween were very poor, showing that the director was only really paying attention to the action sequences and special effects, unlike cameron who masterfully blended the action together with a sutible amount of drama and softer scenes, without coming off as corny. Im tempted to give this movie 2 stars thanks to the bad acting and poor scripting.
But T3 still serves a purpose if all you want is plenty of action and CG effects. If you're looking for the truely great conclusion that the series deserved... you'll be very disapointed.",1076112000,,3116,4.439790575916231

1474409,4,B00005JM0B,"Few directors are qualified to take up the reins of Cameron's classic Terminator film mythology.  T3 director Mostow does a very impressive and capable job, however, and keeps the story plugging along at a fairly tight clip.  With a running time of just under 105 minutes, the movie is trimmed of any fat or scenes of forced sentimentality (like the ones that slowed down T2 a bit).
The chase scene in the first act, in which the TX chases our heroes in a 160-ton crane truck, is such a masterful blend of live-action and CGI that it defies criticism on any level.  The directory commentary on the DVD reveals that the sequence was originally intended to be shot at night, but the filming schedule necessitated a Summertime shoot, and the nights were just too short for the number of shooting days that would have been needed.
Edward Furlong has been replaced by Nick Stahl for this movie.  Thank goodness!  Stahl is a MUCH, MUCH better actor - Furlong just grew tiresome by the end of T2.
Best part about this film:  the story thread continues to its only logical conclusion, if not the necessarily upbeat one.  I for one would have felt cheated if the film had ended any other way.  T3's storyline stays true to the apocalyptic vision set up by the first two films.  AND, it leaves open the opportunity for a 4th film.  Yes, the story could support another installment.  Whether Arnold, Cameron, Mostow, Gale Anne Hurd, or other franchise principals would get on board for #4 remains to be seen.  But I'd love to know where the story goes from here.
As for the DVD:  the majority of the Disc 2 extras look as if they were culled from an Electronic Press Kit.  Where is Van Ling (mastermind behind the special edition DVD extras in ""The Abyss"" and ""T2"") when we need him?
The ""create your own effects sequence"" extra is majorly lame.  Majorly.
In short, you should buy this DVD to enjoy the movie but not get too excited about the anemic extras.  And there were DEFINITELY not enough extras to merit the second disc.  Fortunately the inclusion of a second disc didn't seem to affect the movie's retail price.
I enjoyed this film in the theatres last summer, but I enjoyed it even more on DVD when I viewed it with a less-critical pair of eyes.  12 years was a long time to wait for another ""Terminator"" film, so starting with my second viewing of this film I could evaluate it more on its own terms and not in comparison to ""T2"".",1075593600,3,2430,4.5091324200913245

And in t2 they kept repeating ""No fate, but what we make for ourselves.""  But now they tryed to bring out ""U can't escape ur destiny.""  Personally, I donm't beilve in fate, but I beilve that everything happens for a reason.., Anyway,, I don't wanna find enlightenment, all I'm saying is that they need to stick with a common moral..

1474411,4,B00005JM0B,"In the era of CGI as a substitute for story-telling - an era ironically given birth by this film's predecessor - Terminator 3 is a refreshing departure.  Certainly there are enough explosions, chases, gunfire, and jaw-dropping CGI effects to satisfy the visceral desire for excitement, but T3 also features memorable dialog, a well-constructed plot, and a philosophically satisfying answer to the question of determinism vs. free will posed by the first two films.
James Cameron's lack of involvement with this production is actually a plus: like Steven Spielberg, he can't resist the urge to pull heartstrings by sometimes force-fitting contrived ""touching"" situations.  Termitator 2 is a terrific movie, but I still wince when Schwartzenegger's T-101 says ""I understand now why you cry.  But it's something I can never do.""  Some people found that moving.  I just thought it was corny.
Director Jonathan Mostow is, by contrast, more even-handed, if less technically astute (Cameron has a degree in physics).  Even the humorous bits (""Talk to the hand"", the running sunglasses gags) come off as organic.  He is a skilled action director who doesn't ignore the human aspects of his story, and takes great pains to integrate them seamlessly with the genre tropes we have all come to expect.
The performances by Nick Stahl as John Connor (taking over for the troubled Edward Furlong), Claire Danes (radiant as his love interest), Kristanna Loken as the ultimate dominatrix-model terminator, and the ageless Arnold Schwartzenegger are top-notch.  Danes' performance is especially impressive when you consider that she was cast in the film and started shooting with literally no time to prepare.
Mostow's take on the story is less about the evil of big corporations like Cyberdyne, than about the destructive qualities of human nature amplified to apocalyptic proportions by our own machines.  For me, that is really the heart of the Terminator mythology, and he hits his target dead-on with an ending that is as poignant as it is surprising for a summer action flick.
The DVD is well produced. The extras are mixed, with a so-so making-of documentary, a fairly funny gag reel, and a sleep-inducing attempt at an interactive special-effects lab.  It could have done without most of them.
The reason to buy the film is not the extras; it's the film itself, which, for the completist, belongs without apology next to the first two films on your DVD shelf.",1075420800,2,2449,5.130653266331659
1474412,4,B00005JM0B,"T3 has all of the elements that made T2 a thriller--desperate plot, wild action scenes, and, of course, ah-nold.  This movie was rumored to have the highest budget of any film in history, and every dime shows onscren. The stunts in the chase scene that dominates the beginning of T3 is worth watching inself.  it's an impressive bit of cinema.
T3 was a summer movie, and thus has a fairly barebones plot.  They get right to the action with very little development of the characters or story. The reactions of most characters, particularly Claire Danes', just didn't seem all that plausible considering the deaths of her family and friends she faces as well as learning about her future. One shuld not expect an accurate psychological thriller when watching T3
Nevertheless, despite its rushed pacing and story, T3 is worth seeing.  The special effects, especially of the Terminatrix in exoskeleton form are even more impressive than in T2.  Expectations for T3 to wrap up the whole Terminator storyline might have been just too high to satisfy regardless.  T3 does a good job of ending the trilogy while leaving the door open for more.
Watch this movie if you want to see thrill a minute action or if you want closure for the whole Terminator story. It is likely that T3 will be Arnold's last action movie considering his ew political position. T3 was certainly not a bad note to go out on.",1075248000,,1390,4.746887966804979
1474413,2,B00005JM0B,"It's one thing to require that the audience suspends their disbelieve in the premise.  Hell, an occasional slip here and there  is also acceptable - but T3 falls into that dreaded category of films where the writers took a hiatus and used whatever device was available to advance the narrative.  You wind up with a movie where you need to come up with absurd explanations for every scene.  There were just too many holes throughout the movie, with the big catch being that the evil Terminator is a woman!  Wow!!!

This is definitely a movie where cars play a major role, and as such, here are two actors that should have received closing credits:  Mr. Car Chase and Mr. Unnecessary  Effects.

The first 35 minutes of the movie are one long, useless chase scene.  If you listen to the audio commentary, even Arnold calls this ""one of the biggest scenes in the movie, the biggest scene in the movie""  Is Terminator a car chase movie?  Should this be the biggest scene in the movie?  Arnold states that they were over budget at the time of filming the chase scene - yet he wanted more stunts.  Why?  Arnold states that they were looking to make this the ""the greatest chase sequence in any movie,"" but unlike the chase scenes in T2, where though the stunts are implausible, they are used to drive the narrative and get the characters to their next location, , here they serve no purpose other that to show a lot of explosions and wreckage.  Car chases are not what the Terminator series are about.

How TX (the evil Terminator) acquires John Conner's location during the chase is unbelievable.  Without giving too much away, just how could the cars which she commanded see without her presence?  What absurd ""nano-technology"" could be used to explain this?  The engines of the cars operated on a mechanical principal rather than through computer control. Is it that she can control other machines, regarless of whether they are computer controlled or not?  Where's the science behind this?  And that just it - there are scenes after scenes in this movie where I sat there and asked myself, ""Wait a minute - what's going on?  Wouldn't it make more sense if they had done...""

There are so many inconsistencies and and holes in this movie that to discuss each one would give the entire movie away.  Let's just say that there are times when you need a plane and the very model that you know how to fly happens to be nearby.  We also learn in T3 that military bases don't bother with security - anyone can walk right into the command center. I can only attribute this and other annoyances to sloppy writing and an understanding by Hollywood that many SF fans out there are too caught up with the fictional part of SF rather than the science or consistency.

TX is supposed to be the ultimate Terminator, a Terminator's Terminator - more intelligent and more deadly than any other model.  And yet the liquid metal Terminator in T2 was a much greater rival to Arnold's character.  You felt that the liquid Terminator could not be stopped no matter what you thew at it.  And it couldn't!  What ultimately got to it was being at the wrong place at the wrong time.  How TX is dispatched doesn't hold up to her being so indistructable.

John Connor's character, who was quite cocky, intelligent, and brash in T2, becomes a nihilist loser whose not too sharp.  In no way at any point in T3 does John Conner show any sense of leadership or bravery.  You wind up asking yourself, this is supposed to be the future leader of mankind?  What caused him to change?

T2 made it a point to show John's development and control.  T3 just gives you a premise and forces its viewers to invent the reasoning.

Arnold's acting was stilted.  Somehow I imagine his involvement in the film being driven solely by the large pay-day he received.

Arnold also states in the audio commmentary how serious the Terminator is about his sunglasses.  I allways took the sunglass motif a device to show the Terminator's lack of humanity.  We don't know what's going on behind them.  In T2, as his character becomes more human-line, they dispose the glasses, while as Sarah O'Conner's character becomes more determined and deadly, she puts hers on.  Arnold - do you honestly think a robot cares about what sunglasses he wears or what happens to them?

Claire Dane's character is tossed quickly out of her semi-normal life into an amazing situation.  One would think that she would be a bit more upset and overturned by the course of events.  Instead we see her angry and barely introspective.  And what exactly is her character's job?  She states that she's not a vet, yet she drives the vet's truck and is the one who answers emergency calls.

There are some light humor scenes in the movie, but I doubt the director's intent was to make the whole movie a parody or a tribute to the earlier films.

The title of movie is also somewhat misleading, as it makes you wonder if you're going to witness the rise and start of the machine empire rather than a continuation of the pre-armageddon saga.  The writers would have done better to fill in the background of what happened to Sarah and Joh O'Conner and how/why armageddon took place, and have the movie take place with John leading the resistance, leading up to the transportation of the first Terminator.

I would recommend this movie only because of it's legacy and as a continuation of the series.  Standing on it's own, this movie would have gone nowhere.  After you see this movie, ask yourself if it wern't for the other two Terminator movies, would this movie inspire you to see T4?  I bet not.  And that's a shame.",1074988800,2,5630,4.612286002014098

1474415,4,B00005JM0B,"Terminator 3 lacks the inventiveness of T1 and the style and panache of T2; however, T3 is ultimately a very gratifying entry in the series.  The movie opens as a sexy female Terminator (Terminatrix) arrives from the future and begins systematically eliminating people (much of it off-camera - the movie is not especially gory).  As with the shape-shifter from T2, the Terminatrix has some ingenious new features.  Nick Stahl replaces Edward Furlong as John Connor, now age 20.  He's been on the move since T2 and the subsequent death of his mother, never staying in one place or developing relationships.  He and Claire Danes become entangled and gradually we begin to understand her involvement.  Of course, Arnold arrives along the way - what would a Terminator movie be without him?
The plot is clever and filled with humor, much of it courtesy of Arnold's quips.  There are also some excellent stunts, particularly a chase scene involving a crane that seems to destroy much of LA.  T3 is much more straight-forward and brisk than T2.  In a strange way, the movie is a *comfortable* action film; we know what to expect from the series and it delivers.  The ending is also satisfying while also clearly leaving the door open for T4.  Overall, it's a solid action movie.",1074816000,2,1272,4.842592592592593
1474416,5,B00005JM0B,"Why five stars? Surely this is not Terminator 1 or 2 you say? The truth be told that it is not, but this movie is still a five star sci-fi action fest that simply blows most sci-fi movies out of the water. It is not the best of the Terminator series but it is still an excellent movie and more importantly this is Schwarzenegger and he IS back.
It has been almost 10 years since Arnie did a good movie (True Lies). When you compare T3 to the likes of - Junior, Eraser, Jingle All the Way, Batman & Robin, End of Days, The 6th Day and Collateral Damage you should be thankful for seeing the man back doing what he does best.
T3 is far better than any of us could have hoped it would have been without Cameron at the helm. Not only was this vehicle a darn good summer blockbuster but it was THE summer blockbuster film for 2003 and simply knocked Matrix: Revolutions for ten in terms of meeting the audience's expectations.
T3 cuts to the chase almost ten minutes into the film. The connections do defy belief though (John Conner hooks up with the daughter of the only man who can stop Skynet almost fifteen minutes into the film) but when all is said and done you just don't care because when Arnie comes on screen it is ALL TERMINATOR from start to finish. The director has also taken a very different approach to the theme of ""fate"" and the ending, surprisingly, is a corker of a crack ending that is also better than any third instalment in the series could have delivered. The special effects and action sequences are on top form and T3 also boasts huge amounts of well-placed humour like Arnie's dead-pan and on-que one liners (""Your Fiance is Dead. Let's go."" )
Is this a worthy contender? Hell yeah! and more. The DVD in its crisp transfer looks amazing and there is a powerhouse of stunts and action sequences to keep the audience entertained throughout its many plot twists and turns. This is not a bad sequel at all... in fact if Mostow helms the next one who is going to complain? Sure Cameron is not here and it is more PG orientated, but if you like T1 and T2 and are prepared to give a little leeway to the series without Cameron then T3 is the surprise summer blockbuster hit package. It also has lots of nostalgia and little moments from T1 and T2 thrown in. Like I said - It is all good!
By the way - Cameron said he liked it. The series may be milked but what the hell.. it does not disappoint and seeing a female terminator and Arnie smashing sevens shades of brown out of each other is something new in cinema to say the least.  Just seeing a female take on the man of bronze is worth the rental alone and for those who really like it  - DVD ownership IS INEVITABLE.

1474459,4,B00005JM0B,"T3 has fine performances by Claire Danes (fiery and feisty) and Kristanna Loken (cool and crafty).  Nick Stahl and Arnold Schwarzenegger give performances which are decent, but not as engaging.
I liked the fact that the terminatrix used her sex appeal as an aid in infiltration.  Before seeing the movie, I had thought that a female terminator didn't make much sense (except to get a male audience).  But now I see that the less threatening, and more sexy, a terminator looks, the more able it is to achieve its goals.  Kristanna was every bit as good as Arnold was in the first film.
This is no James Cameron film.  The cinematography isn't as engaging (the point-the-camera-at-the-action school), and there are so many special effects that it almost takes away from the story.  The story wins out though, and that, along with the women's performances, saves the film.
The film was clearly influenced by The Matrix, particularly in a scene where T1 and TX fight it out, busting through loads of porcelain in a restroom.  Reminded me of Morpheus and that unfortunate toilet bowl.
While I doubt the possibility of another sequel, the film leaves room for one, or even a TV series.  Stunt direction is very impressive.  The film keeps moving, and doesn't grow tiresome -- and it has an ending which is indeed consistent with the other films.  If it didn't, then there would be no ugly future for the terminators to have come from!

Im a HUGE fan of the first two and I waited on pins and needles for over 10 years before they FINALLY released the 3rd one....Im sad to say that they shouldnt have even made it. Its a sorry sorry movie. There is only one reason to watch this...Kristanna Loken!  To finish this up,  this movie was not made to satisfy the fans, its just a guaranteed money maker from Hollywood. Thanks for throwing T-3 in the garbage Jonathan Mostow, it could have been great. If you don't already have T2, buy it instead, its MUCH better and thats almost unarguable. The special effects of T2 still hold up to todays standards too.",1073779200,,1359,4.280155642023346

THis movie has some of the greatest special effects in a movie that I've ever seen, the action is intense, and it answers some questions (like why the terminator keeps coming back, and why he switched from bad to good in T2). This movie even adds some humor. See it, love it.",1073606400,,442,4.469135802469136
1474467,4,B00005JM0B,"I was really worried about this movie. I didn't think they could ever make another Terminator movie, seeing as how the story basically ended with T2. And the fact the James Cameron, who basically envisioned, wrote, & directed the first two, wasn't going to have anything to do with this movie made me nervous. The Terminator movies have been two of my favorites for years. So, my expectations for this flick were huge.
The story goes that the Judgement Day that was prevented in T2 was actually only delayed. It's very hard to explain and if I did, it might ruin some of the plot in the movie. But, know that for a story that James Cameron didn't write, it's still very good. Basically a new terminator, played by a Uber-HOT Kristanna Loken, comes back through time to kill John Connor. And once again, Arnold plays the good terminator and is sent back to protect John (played by Nick Stahl) from the new TX. This new terminator is even more of a bad-ass the the one from T2. It is a robot terminator, like Arnold, except newer and mucn stronger and has a liquid metal exterior. As you can probably expect, things get blown up, there is much gunfire and great special effects insue.
A subplot in the movie involves the TX taking out, what are going to be, John Conner's revolution buddies now before they become older. One of the people, is a girl that John knew in junior high. She is played by Claire Daines and becomes a main character in the movie. I won't say how, because that would give away a plotline, but it's pretty interesting. For most of the movie, the TX is chasing down Arnold, John Conner, and Katherine Brewer (the Claire Daines character).
The action scenes are very well done. The special effects have come a LONG way since T2. When you see the chase scene with the crane (you will know what I mean when you see it), your jaw will drop to the floor. The TX itself looks very nice. Kristanna Loken is unbelievably hot, but she plays the role very well. Her movements and expressions are very robotic. I am certainly hoping to see her in more films in the future. I am glad they didn't get Edward Furlong to reprise his role for this, because Nick Stahl is a much better & less irritating actor. Claire Daines seems out of place in an action movie like this, at first. But, after awhile she blends right in. And what can you say about Arnold playing the Terminator that hasn't been said already? It's his role and he does perfectly.
Jonathan Mostow does a good job directing this movie. He didn't go away from the look or the story of the previous films, but he definately made his own movie. Overall I liked this film quite a bit. While I can't devulge why I liked the plot without giving some key things away, I think fans of the other two movies will definately like this movie and will leave satisfied. It's not as original as the other two, but as a summer action/sci-fi movie, it definately is worth the money you would toss down on it.
The DVD is a 2-disc set with lots of special features, but not all of them that interesting. You get a commentary with the director and all of the main cast. There is one deleted scene and it's hilarious. I can see why it wasn't left in the movie, but it'll give you a big laugh when you see it. There is the dreaded 12 minute HBO promotional featurette that I hate to see on these discs. There a a bunch of little documentaries on the special effects, as usual. There is a somewhat funny blooper reel. And some other little features that are decent. Overall, I found the supplements to be somewhat disappointing and I hope there is not some 3-disc set on the way that I don't know about.",1073606400,2,3649,4.399408284023669

1474531,4,B00005JM0B,"No one really thought Terminator 3 would be made. Sure, the title ""Rise of the Machines"" has been tossed around since at least 1997, but with Cameron's near-perfect T2 and the franchise being more than a decade old, most fans didn't give any serious consideration to a third installment. But someone decided to go ahead and make T3 anyway.
I went into T3 with low expectations. All the comments I'd heard on the movie pinned it as average to slightly above-average at best. The director was so-so, the running time was way under T2, only Arnold chose to return, and the box office reciepts weren't that great. And sure enough most of the movie matched those expectations. Fun action, but a lot of re-hashing of what had been done in the first two movies. Minimal character development, just enough to make the viewer give a damn about the heroes. Competent direction, but everything seemed to operate on such a small scale, considering that this was supposed to be the last hours before judgement day.
So far, the movie was a decent popcorn flick that was worth my money and thankfully didn't manage to embarass the legacy of the movies before it.
Then the final few minutes of the movie rolled, and everything changed. I don't know how I managed to not spoil the ending for myself, considering all the reviews I read, but I was totally blown away. Yeah, I heard they were leaving room for a Terminator 4, but I didn't expect it to happen this way. Suddenly, the small scale of the movie seems to make sense, as if it's all clever misdirection of some sort. T3 could've worked a lot better with a more stylistic director and a slightly longer running time, but as it stands, its ending makes it a more-than-worthy entry in the franchise. Before, I dreaded another installment. Now, I'm looking forward to it.
WB's treatment of T3 on DVD is something of a disappointment. Audio/visual is very good, and thankfully the movie comes in a keepcase instead of a snapper, but the supplements are just there to take up space. There's a good deleted scene that must be watched by all fans, and a few decent featurettes, but most of the bonus material is promotional in nature. Given how loaded the past Terminator discs have been, T3 simply doesn't compare.
T3 is a great popcorn movie with a jaw-dropping ending. WB needs to learn how to make a decent 2-disc special edition of its summer movies. 4 stars.",1073347200,,2397,4.642352941176471
1474532,2,B00005JM0B,"Yes, we've all heard it by now: James Cameron did not direct this film.  And we must get over it.  I agree that it is not fair to judge the film against Cameron's filmmaking.  But we must still rate it as an action film.  And in my opinion, ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" fails to meet my standards.  The opening to the film is completely uninspired and it borrows much from the first two films, albeit with more humor and a lighter touch.  Moreover, I felt that the film really did not go anywhere.  There was absolutely no plot in this film.  Most action movies lack plot, but they make up for it with terrific action sequences-I did not feel that I was shown any in this film.
While I enjoyed where the movie ended up, it certainly leaves the door open for another disaster film to be made.  Arnold hardly gets any screen time and his character certainly receives no development.
""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" made a lot of money because people had high expectations.  Unfortunately, I do not feel that this movie delivered.  If you haven't seen these films, you're better off just watching T1 and T2.  Hold off on this one.",1073347200,3,1140,4.454106280193237

I don't want to waste time on the two terminators or the special effects, this is a story about destiny and whether our paths are already plotted out for us or not.  We find out, along with the main character, that no matter what road he took, he was always heading toward the same destiny.  The end was truly remarkable as what we thought was going to be a wizz-bang hurry and destroy the stuff ending turned out to be much much more.

I purposely re-wateched the previous two termintor movies to refresh myself before going for the brand new exciting T3. Probably the new one is done by a different director and actors, it's not hard to sense the difference of the tone and style in T3. It seems missing some depth of the complex relationship between human & machine. The plot is abit rough & sloppy. The chasing scene is expensive but not thrill & breath-taking as T2 and the one on highway in Matrix Reloaded. But if you're the Arnold big fan, go for it, otherwise, don't expect too much as I did.

1474537,5,B00005JM0B,"Different... yes.
Good... definately.
Better than the first 2 movies... IN SOME WAYS.
I figured that T3 would be an abomination. When I first heard that it may be rated PG-13, I immediately gave up on it. Then it was rated-R and my hope was redeemed.
Then when I heard that James Cameron wasn't directing, I was again put off, but thankfully, I went to go see this and hungrily gathered up the DVD when it came out.
Other reviewers were saying that T3 doesn't bring anything new to the series and my response to that is... WHAT!!!
The first Terminator was scary. The unknown. When that movie came out, we didn't know who the Terminator was. He was this indestructable killing machine. The second Terminator was a special effects masterpiece with a cool story.
That being said, the creators of T3 knew they couldn't meet the expectation of T2 special effects or the scares of the original, so they had the common sense to tell a GOOD STORY.
In my opinion, Terminator 3 is the best STORY of the three. It delves into the origin of SkyNet, holds emotional impact (thanks to two very good actors, Nick Stahl and Claire Danes) and has a conclusion that no action movie has previously had the balls to deliver.
Terminator 3 was a huge win. One of the best movies of the year, crushes The Matrix and I can't wait for the fourth installment!
The DVD: cool. Besides dozens of cool behind the scenes featurettes, also allows you into the SkyNet database to explore weapons and personnel and has a visual effects lab where you can build your own special effects sequences.
Buy it. If you haven't seen Terminator 3. It's one of the few action movies that won't insult your intelligence.",1073260800,,1674,4.583333333333333
1474538,1,B00005JM0B,"The problem with this movie, in a nutshell?  It adds nothing new to the Terminator storyline.  Unlike T2 (which I felt was a step in the right direction from the original film), this movie does not ask any deep questions about fate, or war, or time travel, or love. It does not give you any hope for the future.  Instead it takes a step backward and travels down the path of typical Hollywood action cinema fare.  Explosions, kissing, screaming, car chases-- they all do nothing but attempt to keep the viewers' attention.
Besides that, this new ""Terminatrix?""  The one that is supposed to be better than any Terminator ever ever ever?  All she can really do is turn her hands into weapons, and then when a certain weapon is damaged beyond repair, she can no longer use the same weapon.  Huh? Compared to Robert Patrick's T-1000 model from T2, she's a pile of tin cans.  Why didn't the robots send another T-1000 back?
Suddenly introducing Claire Danes as a love interest was an interesting trick, completely overdone in Hollywood.  Why does there have to be a love interest in everything?  Why should it be that we know, even as she's cursing John Connor and trying to run away and beating on him, that sure enough, soon enough, they're going to end up as an item?  Like every other character in this film, she ultimately ends up doing nothing.  Nobody does anything to further the plot along.
This, see, is what makes this film the poster child for ""anti-climax.""  It tells you from the beginning-- this is going to happen.  In the middle of the movie, it says-- oh, wait!  Maybe THIS will happen now instead.  And then at the end, it says, well, see, I TOLD you this was going to happen.
And even the stuff that you were told is going to happen isn't visually addressed half the time.  We see machines go nuts for a few minutes, we see Skynet about to be run for the first time, but the rest of the movie is just a couple of people being chased by a Terminator and Ahnold calmly explaining everything that is about to happen.  So seeing this movie just to ""see for yourself"" what happens is also sort of a waste of time.
All that hype just to see a naked female Terminator for about two seconds.  Not only that, but the movie's ""it's going to happen no matter what you do"" mantra ends up making viewers feel utterly depressed and apathetic.  Just watch T2 again and dream about John Connor's future.  It'll make for a much happier ending.",1073174400,10,2441,4.47737556561086

The original film had something T2 never achieved - HEART.  The focus in T2 was the special effects.  For that it was superior to the smaller budget sleeper Terminator.  But flash does not equate to substance, so in T2, I was like WOW - but is that all there is?  I expected more of T2 flash in T3, and there is that.  Buckle up, baby, it's about to get bumpy is a lot of the film.  So it provided the flash.  But T3 does something T2 did not, it tries to draw on it's roots of the first film, giving John connor something of his mother ""who didn't ask for any of this"" into his character. Nick Stahl does very well as making you believe he could be Sara Connor's son.  Claire Danes does what she could with the role, but it's a bit limited to ""screaming let me out"". Kristanna Loken does well as the non-stoppable Female Terminator - but, hey I often wonder if machines really would be machines that look sexy?  But, guess we are not supposed to worry about things like that.
Arnold is very well toned, but his performance is same old same old.  I has so many concerns, that I was surprised just how much I did enjoy it.  Mind bubblegum, but great fun anyway.
Connor is now in his twenties - the great Apocalypse has not come about and he is a drifter going from place to place.  Dane's Character Kate Brewster is a vet, planning on marriage and the daughter of the man responsible for pushing the button on the Sky Net Defence that permits the Machines to take over.
Connor breaks into her vet's office, but she catches him.  But before the police arrive the Terminators arrive and it's non-stop action.

1474605,5,B00005JM0B,"The first time I noticed that there was a Terminator 3 movie coming out was when I was at the movie theater. There above me hung a huge Terminator 3 banner, featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger, half showing his human face, and the other half showing his exo-skeleton machine face. I was extremely excited, being a fan of the Terminator series. I went home, watched the trailer for the movie so many times, I lost count, and counted down the days till the movie would arrive on the big screen. My father even bought advance tickets to the movie to ease my thoughts that they may sell out, which would get in the way of me seeing the movie that I knew I would love! Right after that, when the movie launched onto theaters, there I was with popcorn, waiting in line for the movie of my dreams...
When I left the movie theater, I was impressed at the fact that the movie didn't bomb. Yes, I know that a lot of sequels to a great movie turn out to be crap, but that was proved wrong with Terminator 2: Judgement Day, Aliens (sequel to Alien), and a couple other titles. Well, this is another example to prove that statement wrong as this movie held together until the end.
The story takes place with the time being now, present day. John Connor (Nick Stahl), the soon-to-be hero in the future, lives without any type of personal information. As in saying, he doesnt have a home, no computer, nothing is in his name, and basically he lives off of the streets. This is because he's still paranoid from the fact that the machines from the future sent a machine (the T-1000, played by Robert Patrick) to terminate him so he wouldnt be alive and would never exist in the future. Anyway, he's still afraid that there may actually be a chance there is a terminator being sent from the future for a second chance in wiping him out. And boy, was he right. Out steps the T-X (Kristanna Loken), who is more powerful than the T-1000, having the same things as the last machine, but even more such as a metal exoskeleton under the liquid metal (the T-1000 was only liquid metal), and being able to change forms and shapes into anything that it sees, just like the T-1000. The only protector that John Connor can depend on is the T-101 <or T-800> (Arnold Schwarzenegger), who was his guardian in the second movie. From then on, this movie takes you on a great action experience. From car chases on a huge crane truck, to a one on one showdown between the T-101 and the T-X, this movie will not displease you one least bit (that's my opinion, though)!
Also, there will be some twists in the movie, and I will not give out the twists, as its much more enjoyable not knowing while you're watching the movie... Enjoy!

First of all, to answer some questions, Ed Furlong was not in this because of his substance abuse(he had the part of course,but John Mostow didn't know if he could pull it off without any help). Why James Cameron didn't direct this? (Titanic may have had sumthin to do with it)but there was an interview with him after this came out and he said he liked it. OK, now for the movie. Overall, i was pleased. I wondered how they could pull it off, because for me, the first two Terminator movies were about the two bad Terminators (Arnold in the first, Robert Patrick in the second) and how Cameron kept making us believe they couldn't be killed, and it was that threat that scared me. After i saw this one, i realized how smart the makers of this were(they knew that this new girl Terminator couldn't have the same effect the other two had), so they made the threat the impendind arrival of Judgment Day, and wondering if they would stop it. When it came to the end, i thought it was going to turn out ok. But then (sorry if i ruin the movie)when they found out it was just a bomb shelter for the President and not the thing to stop Skynet, i was shocked. I got surprised again when Judgment Day began, and we saw the bombs fall. I said to myself, Wow, i never expected that ever. That is were i realized how good this movie was. Sure, you got your Plot Holes(Dyson not being the cause of building Skynet, huh?) and part of Arnold's performance(talk to the hand? Gimme a break) and the T-X didn't do it for me(but she is really, really hot, so she did it for me there) but i didn't feel the intensity in her performance like i felt with Patricks T-1000, or Arnold's in the first one.

The humor was ridiculous and not typical Arnold humor.""Talk to the Hand"" Was one of the most pathetic lines I have ever seen in a movie.  You may think that was funny if you were in 2nd grade. Sure there was some action, but if I wanted action I would rather watch Bad Boys II.  The story was very weak and I believe most of the original actors did not come back because this script lacked any kind of substance.(except Arnold, he needed the campaign money)  Sure Claire Daines is pretty good but the actor who played john connor was aweful.

1474648,4,B00005JM0B,"My initial impression upon hearing that there would be a third Terminator movie was that it would be excellent, thinking that the majority, if not all of those involved the making of the first two films would be involved in making this third one.  Upon hearing that James Cameron and many others from the first two films would not be involved, some of those expectations were dashed.
When I saw this third film in the theaters there ""was"" an obvious letdown when considering that in ""some"" ways, the mythos that was established in the first two films seemed to have been forgotten.  Upon watching this film a second time, now on DVD, I've changed my opinion somewhat.  Taken as a whole, this film does extend upon the mythos of the futuristic battle between man and machine and gives an even greater impression of the ""history"" of events in the Terminator genre.  Where the film takes some hits is it's few too many attempts at brevity, which are interesting the first time but they're so clichd as to actually distract from the overall enjoyment of the film.
Despite some of those misgivings about those ""too many"" trips to the humor well, I would still suggest to those that either saw the film in the theaters or have overlooked this film completely that they give this film an open minded viewing because in many ways it does develop the overall story of the Terminator!
What can one say about Arnold Schwarzenegger and his past and present performances as the Terminator; he brings the character back fairly well in this third film.  It is very interesting to see the T-101 model Terminator with a psychological profile but, as stated above, that is interesting but it also plays too heavily in the trips to the humor well.
While Nick Stahl may be a good actor and may have done well in the other films he's been in, I thought his characterization for John Connor was more or less weak, they should've brought Edward Furlong in to reprise the character.  Claire Danes does a good job in her first action role.  The extraordinarily gorgeous newcomer, Kristanna Loken does an exceptional job as the Terminatrix, future performances by her should be looked forward to with great anticipation.
Jonathan Mostow does an acceptable job as the director of this film, given the script that he had to work with but one cannot help but wonder how different and that much better this film might've been had James Cameron taken the job.  The overall score for the film does an acceptable job in carrying the film along!
The Premise:
As we soon learn, Skynet, just prior to it's defeat sent back not two but three Terminators, The T-101 of the first film; the T-1000 of the second film and now the T-X Terminatrix of this third film.  The T-X Terminatrix is sent to terminate John Connor's lieutenants but to her great luck she not only finds one of the lieutenants in Kate Brewster but she also finds evidence that John Connor himself is nearby and becomes locked on him.  In comes Arnold Schwarzenegger as the latest T-101 sent to protect John Connor and his lieutenants and he is now not only a Terminator but also he's also a Terminator with a psychological profile, ready to dispense his ""wisdom"" at any time.
What follows from there is a very good Terminator movie that is entertaining but doesn't measure up to its predecessors.  I would still recommend it to fans of the series as it does do an acceptable job of advancing the Terminator story as a whole!  {ssintrepid}

1474649,5,B00005JM0B,"Like everyone else, I had my doubts about this movie. Without James Cameron behind the wheel, it could never be as good as the first two, or so we thought. Well, we were wrong. With the director of U-571 in charge, T3 is every bit as good as Cameron's works, except that it's a lot more funny and the plot holds more surprises as it unravels. The whole thing with this Terminator being the same one that kills John in the far future is wonderfully ironic. Sarah's absence is explained beyond beautifully, and Dr. Silverman is back! I only have two complaints. The first is that it has a few clerical errors - for example, it says John Connor was 13 in T2, when in fact he was ten. The second complaint is that despite our computer technology being some ten or twelve years better than what was used for T2, the CGI actually looks WORSE. Of course, T2's CGI only had to make a silvery blob, and didn't try to make anything as complicated as the T-X.
Make no mistake, this movie is definitely a legitimate and powerful extension of the Terminator saga.",1072569600,,1050,4.417525773195877
1474650,4,B00005JM0B,All I have to say is what if you gave the Terminator franchise to a direct to video action director...that's what Terminator 3 is. The acting ...you can't blame the actors. They could only work with the lines they were given.  The special effects were not too bad. The ending does make it worthwhile though. The effects in some of the scenes are good and advance what we saw in T2.  I was hoping that Stallone would be a cybernetic rival to Arnold..but I don't think they could agree on who would get more screen time.,1072483200,,518,4.385416666666667

I think is its tight when he outsmarts her when he puts that hook thingy in the sewage hole ( talk about getting her face inplanted ) but always..... she is TERMINATED,1072483200,,270,4.313725490196078
1474652,4,B00005JM0B,"I was pleasantly surprised by ""Terminator 3:Rise Of The Machines"", especially with it's eerie, yet oddly poetic,ending. It also leaves the door open for future sequels, though I think it's time for Arnold Schwarzenegger, who simply looks too old and tired to be in this role, to annoint a new CSM-101(would The Rock be perfect, or what?)should there be a ""Terminator 4"".
Overall, this film is the weakest of the three, but that's not necessarily a bad thing, given the earlier two films fixture as science fiction classics, not to mention introducing some of the greatest one-liners in movie history. The ""Talk To The Hand"" line in ""T3"" is humorous, but may have been more relevant circa 1996 than 2003. Schwarzenegger is still a fine cyborg, but it's hard to get past the fact he was 55 when ""T3"" was filmed (nor is any explanation offered in the film as to why the CSM-101 appears so much older than the previous incarnation). The supporting cast is solid- Nick Stahl's performance as John Connor is better than Edward Furlong's in ""T2"". Claire Danes-all grown up since most of us last saw her in the TV Series ""My So-Called Life""- plays the part of damsel in distress-turned tough chic as well as Linda Hamilton did in the 1984 original. The evil terminator- known alternately as the ""Terminatrix"" or ""T-X"", isn't as convincing, although actress Kristanna Loken looks nice. She just doesn't have much to do, except occasionally harass Ah-nold and crew. Robert Patrick's ""T-1000"" in the second film was far creepier.
Without James Cameron(who apparently thought executive producing the TV show ""Dark Angel"" was a better idea than directing this film), Jonathan Mostow does a pretty good job of keeping a balance between the action and comedic moments, as well as overseeing a climactic end which I did not see coming. I would be ok with Mostow directing ""T4"", should there be one. Think of ""Terminator 3"" as ""Terminator Lite""- looks great but a bit less filling than the previous two.",1072396800,,1986,4.8613569321533925
1474653,3,B00005JM0B,"Terminator 3 does an average job of attempting to explain itself. There is both a prologue and epilogue that attempts to explain and link this movie with the other Terminators. We get to learn of how the world came to be in the future, and how, after visited by another T-101, John Connor is now the new leader to try to save the world from the rise of the machines. He meets up with Kate Brewster (Clair Danes) through a series of events and she also learns her role in the future of mankind.
I didn't really go into this movie believing it would be much, but was pleasantly surprised with some of the acting, action sequences and plot. However, as usual in action movies, some of the chase scenes were dragged out incredibly long. I think if this movie would have focused more on building a solid story line through building the characters it would have made for a more effective story.
One thing that definitely was a negative was the character of John Connor. He comes across as a whiny, Generation X slacker type that no one watching feels sorry for. He seems to spend his time feeling sorry for himself and complaining about having to lead mankind. He tends to become an irksome point of the movie, and hardly fits the description of ""hero."" If they would have made him a stronger character I think it would have vastly improved the script.
Still, Terminator 3 is a fun movie. Sequels are definitely one of the hardest types to make successful, and I believe that Terminator 3 succeeds, albeit in a ""ho-hum"" way.

The special effects are good; especially the car chase, but you can't build a film like this solely on effects and ignore the dialogue.  I thought this was an OK movie, but that's all.

1474685,4,B00005JM0B,"James Cameron wisely chose to step away from directing ""Terminator III"", a horrible rehash of cliches and vignettes from the first two films, and with the added bonus of a plot that goes absolutely nowhere! Arnold's back - looking as buff as ever, but acting way too campy to be credible. Remember the scene at the strip club - with the obviously flamboyant, leather clad...or the bit where Claire Danes gets hoisted by Arnold into the air at a gas station - if for no other reason - then just to alert the clerk behind the counter that something's terribly wrong?  The edge of apocalyptic doom is gone from the series. It's been replaced with self-depricating humor that literally destroys the film's credibility from the word go.
TRANSFER: Solid, impressive, well balanced and over all - great visual presentation. Colors are rich. Shadows are nicely rendered. Black levels are black. Smooth DVD transfer with only a hint of shimmering and edge enhancement. The audio is 5.1 and nicely balanced.
EXTRAS: The usual round of fluff and nonsense that sadly, is in keeping with the feather-weight handling of the film's subject matter.
BOTTOM LINE: This should not have been the final installment in ""The Terminator"" series!!!",1072310400,,1223,4.965853658536585
1474686,2,B00005JM0B,"When I first heard about this movie, I was so thrilled that they were going to continue the Terminator series. I went into the theater with high hopes of being as amazed as I had been with the first two, however, i came out sorely disappointed. There are a number of reasons why I felt this way.
They are:
1. James Cameron didn't direct it. It is impossible to have a decent Terminator movie if Cameron isn't directing it.
2. No continuity. There are relatively few connections between T3 and the first 2 movies.
3. No Linda Hamilton. Again, its impossible to have a Terminator movie without her.
4. Too much action, not enough stroy. There are too many action sequences with a very small, weak plot line.
5. Too far-fetched. The TX is way too far-fetched. It's too perfect, it can make its own weapons and reprogram other machines. It would've been better to bring back Robert Patrick as the T-1000.
6. Not the same music. What happened to Brad Fiedel and the main Terminator theme?
It must seem like I am a knitpicker who didn't like the movie at all, however, I did enjoy the movie greatly. It was a great action movie, just not worthy of the Terminator name. I'd have to say that the best scene of the movie is at the cemetery when the girl has a conversation with Dr. Soberman from the other two movies.
On a final note, after seeing T3, I went home and watched T2: The Ultimate Edition DVD. After the movie was over, I browsed thru the special features and came across an alternate ending confirming that there was no Judgement Day and John Connor became a senator. I think that this would have been a great ending for T2, that way we wouldn't have to deal with the disgrace that is T3.",1072137600,6,1692,4.4089456869009584

1474688,3,B00005JM0B,"This is not the new Bible of science fiction. This is supposed to be the last episode of the saga about thE fight between machines that take over the world and men who are nothing but easy preys for these computers. Of course John Connor has to be saved along with a girl, who cares about which one provided she can lay some eggs. And this couple has to be saved by being led into the atomic shelter of the President of the United States just before the machines erase life from earth with all the atom bombs men have accumulated. Judgment Day cannot be avoided. This is one recollection from the Bible. But only one man and one woman, plus maybe a few descendents, will survive. That is definitely not the Book of Revelations but a new version of the Genesis. In other words, when machines have become the supreme authority of the world, when they have killed God since no one can believe in religion anymore when they are plugged on the Internet and its ungodly blabla, there can only be a catastrophe coming, the end of the world that in a way selfdestroys, and the promise of a new beginning - which will lead to the same catastrophe in a few hundreds of centuries - that sounds like or smells like a rewriting of the Bible in a new very apocryphal version. And do not ask this film to have any complex psychology. On one side machines that have no psychology at all, only a plain programmed mission. On the other two human beings who are terrorized by fear, fright and some other versions of dread. All the others are nothing but props necessary to hold the setting. But it is entertaining because of the very total unbelievableness of the fable. If you can suspend your disbelief for more than five minutes, you must not have seen many movies lately and I would advise you to get to the cinema more often. By the way, the special effects are rather colorful.

1474689,2,B00005JM0B,"I fell asleep halfway through the movie.
The action sequences are stretched out too much and is so over the top I could not help but laugh.
The previous two movies were excellent (T1 is in my opinion the best of them all), but this movie should either have been directed by James Cameron or nobody at all. The first Terminator movie back in 1984 was dark, disturbing, violent and amazingly believable. T2 gave us more insight into the story, but T3 seem to ponder from one action sequence to another without any rhyme or reason. The only part in the movie where I actually felt a connection with the other two movies was when Arnold aknowledged that he killed John Connor.

Everything is taken from the first two flicks and given a 'spin' (not really) to make fresh. The humour is horrible and mocks the legacy of the two 'real' Terminator films. ie)Elton John shades on the Terminator.
The special effects were terrible CGI graphics (in the behind the scenes interview on the T2 DVD Stan Winston says the big problem with films today is all the computer effects - he uses them ONLY when they can't be done another way. But here it's ALL CGI all the time and it's all terrible.)
The uninventive story plods along, missing the boat in almost every scene. There's no real dramatic arc in this film and it completely misses the point of the second with its resonant theme of the value of human life. There are no such themes here -just boring, unimaginative action scenes that land with a dull thud.

All things considered, I had every right to expect this movie to be a bust.  Not only did James Cameron (who directed the first two ""Terminator"" movies) bow out, but his ex-wife and star Linda Hamilton also said ""hasta la vista, baby"" to ""T3.""  Linda Hamilton's role as Sarah Connor was a crucial element to the first two ""Terminator"" films, and without her, my faith headed south.  But thanks to director Jonathan Mostow, he makes ""Terminator 3"" a worthy sequel that doesn't come across as a desperate attempt to give Arnold Schwarzenegger a hit.  Like ""T2,"" Arnold plays a ""good"" terminator on a mission to protect John Connor (Nick Stahl) against the relentlessly evil terminatrix TX (a wonderfully icy Kristianna Loken).  ""T3"" lacks the groundbreaking punch of its last two films, and Stahl comes off as a bit bland as John Connor, but the film overall succeeds as an above-average action flick.  Special effects-wise, there's nothing to write home about, but there are a few scenes that will have you hooked to the screen, including an extended car chase that's downright ugly.  It's also not afraid to make fun of itself by recycling one-liners like ""she'll be back,"" ""I'll be back,"" and ""talk to the hand.""  I can't say that ""T3"" will go down as one of the great action movies and I'm also not sure I would want to see a ""T4,"" but it definitely exceeded my expectations.",1071619200,,1507,4.721374045801527

It's just a faint copy of the Terminator 2: Judgement Day, with the story and music/sounds extracted...

1474694,4,B00005JM0B,"Interesting that the three Terminator installments have come about a decade apart from each other.  The first came out in 1984, the second in 1991, and this third one in 2003.  After the very successful first film, the series exploded with the sequel, a film which was better than the original (very difficult for a sequel to do).  The second movie introduced us to some different special effects, as Arnold was now the good guy, and the new villain was made of ""liquid metal"", and could morph himself into anything he touched.
Now, in this excellent third chapter, we have a similar situation.  Arnold is again the hero, with a villain who is more advanced than him.  This time it is a woman(Kristanna Loken) who can not only morph into what she touches, she has a right arm which can turn into just about any weapon you want, and she can control machines remotely.  The goal of the second two movies is the same, kill John Conner or those associated with him.
The movie is missing Linda Hamilton, as Sarah Conner, and real life husband James Cameron as director.  Edward Furlong as John Conner in T2 is Nick Stahl.  Furlong is not missed at all.  Stahl does a credible job with John Conner as a late teenager who thinks the work he did in T2 has saved the world.  Wrong.  Claire Danes plays a veterinarian who gets caught up in the madness and who may play an important role later.
The absolute highlight of the movie is an early chase sequence involving all involved.  Danes and Stahl are in a pickup truck, Arnold is on his customary motorcycle, and Loken gives chase in a huge crane and destroys half the city.  At one point she drops the crane and wipes out an entire side of a road.  There's so much carnage it's funny.
This brings us to the conclusion, which I will not reveal.  I will say that while some sequels leave open the possibility for another installment, this one all but demands it.  The ending is logical and unlike most Hollywood productions, not happy.  It is subdued, but appropriate and I congratulate the filmmakers for this conclusion.  In short I am looking forward to the fourth film.",1071532800,,2113,4.544973544973545
1474755,1,B00005JM0B,"With the 3rd part of the series now installed, The Terminator goes the full circle: from groundbreaking (T1) to braindead (T3).
  The only question that lingers painfully on after watching this disastrouly bad film is whether it's actually a parody of the previous 2 parts. If it is, then it fails at that too because funny it isn't either.
  But, if this is supposed to be taking itself seriously (and i'm afraid it does) then it fails even worse because there's absolutely nothing serious about it oncesoever:
  -a childish and sorry excuse for a script that never takes off, goes (inevitably) nowhere and finishes in noman's land..
  -acting for which you'd have to conduct some serious search to find it in as bad quality as it's found here
  -a braindead explosion-festival that looks like a sony-station game with little ambition, where the good wipe off the bad and vice versa leaving the audience with a functioning brain in total apathy..
  This is really a pity considering that T1 which kicked this series of films off was cutting-edge on many levels and T2 did follow up in a respectable manner. This one though is obviously just a cheap vehicle for making money. There is no ""edge"" here, as all the explosion fair has been seen before countless times, there's no extension of the plot from the previous ""Terminators"", there's frankly nothing.
  There are some things though that are in fact impressive, indeed far more impressive than the ""effects"" which are actually a bad repetition of those in T2: that would be the fact that ""Arnie"" seems to speak worse and more unintelligible english the longer he's in America. I cant begin to imagine how that could be possible but several times through this ""film"" i caught myself thinking ""what was that, what did he say???""

It hardly matters of course as there's barely anything of remote importance being uttered in this joke of a film but i'm still wondering.
  As for the rest of the cast, I've seen real B-movies with far better acting than this. I'm saying B-movies, cuzz this is what T3 really is. A b-flick destined for the video-club sematary at best, allthough you'b wasting your money even if you simply rented this. As well as your time.

Terminator 3 proves to be a weak movie because it had a weak story and it betrayed the original concept. After Terminator 2, the story should have basically ended, if not what was the purpose of that movie? If Judgment Day cannot be stop, only delayed, Skynet could have sent terminator after terminator to the past. The entire logic of the science fiction story would fall apart.
Second, this new bad terminator simply wasn't as powerful or nasty as the one in the second movie. Pretty girl but she bite the bullet pretty easily. Second, the director don't have James Cameron's touch for action and story telling all at the same time. He can only do one thing at a time and its showed.
Bad film editing in the movie. After all, how did that RV crew managed to get into the top secret Skynet Center just at the same time as the bad terminator got in. At least the bad terminator can disguised herself as anyone, how can John Conner and his buddies get in that easily of entrance??

Schwarzenegger reprises the role he was born to play, and he doesn't ham it up as much as he did in T2; Kristanna Loken looks great as the Terminatrix (though she shows too much emotion, I assume this was a directorial decision); Nick Stahl plays 22-year old John Connor as an angst-ridden anti-hero; Claire Danes is very good as Katherine Brewster, future resistance fighter (though she is made to scream and react a lot), particularly considering that she accepted the role a few days before shooting started!  Everyone is great, though Linda Hamilton is missed; to me she's as integral to the Terminator-mythos as Arnold. The script is fine -- with a plot consistent with the previous films, not as much mining for catchy one-liners, but too little on the time paradox aspect of the story.

DVD extras include two commentary tracks -- one with director Mostow alone, the other with Mostow, Arnold, Loken, Daines and Stahl. Arnold's  intelligence (and his out-of-control ego) shine through in his lengthy monologues -- though who was going to tell him to take it down a notch?

The best extra is an hysterical deleted scene, The Sargeant Candy scene, about the origins of the  T-1. There's also a trailer, a storyboard comparison, a Terminator timeline, a visual effects featurette, a video game trailer and making-of featurette, gag reel, featurettes on costumes and action figures, and a 13-minute eye-candy making-of documentary. The film can be heard in English or French and subtitled in English, French or Spanish.

You may remember from T2 that Robert Patrick could form knives, axes, etc.  Arnold explains to John Conner that the terminator of T2 can not form chemicals, moving parts.
Ms. Lokken's Terminator had weapons built into her hands, and that required an endoskeleton.  So she was a hybrid of Arnold's type, and Robert Patrick's type.  An endoskeleton with a liquid metal skin.",1070928000,2,510,5.035714285714286

1474762,4,B00005JM0B,"T3 had to top two of the best action movies of all time.  On its own, T3 is more fun than most action flicks, but, hey, who hasn't seen T1 and T2??  Our expectations were very, very high, and T3 doesn't even come close.  Yet, if you just want to enjoy an action flick, with wry humor (95% of which you'll miss without knowing what went on in T1 and T2), have a blast.
Here are some of the flaws:
After an engaging, luring first five minutes, we are shown our two naked-I-came-from-the-womb backsides shots.  Honestly, the viewer sees two rears which haven't seen the treadmill in a while.
The early scene of Arnold entering the bar to get clothes caught me off guard and did not offend the majority of the viewing public with male nudity on display.  The Elton John sunglasses cracked me up.  The problem is that this movie is about the end of the world.  While I laughed at the ""inside"" jokes which only us ""T"" junkies would pick up on, something seemed out of place with so much levity and so little plot building.
Next flaw - the crane chase scene was too long.  The smash/crash seemed token.  It added nothing to the plot.
Next flaw - Sarah Connor died of leukemia????  For real???  Can't we do better than that?  Unless that is setting us up for T4 wherein she really didn't die, then I think that was needlessly weak.  (I did note that her body was not in the coffin, and was allegedly creamated -- lie?)
Next flaw - Casting!  Why no Linda Hamilton? (divorces notwithstanding).  Why no Edward Furlong?  Don't we want to see how our ""hero"" overcame troubled childhood?  EF was truly a depressed ""youth"" who we have been rooting for since T2.  Shell out the bucks and make it work!!  Even the two detectives (""yo'r momma"" and ""afgan"") could have survived T2 to revisit us in T3.
Next flaw - violence to women.....  Yikes, sure she's a leather-wrapped, mean woman machine, but the scene of smashing her head into toilets makes me wonder where those politically correct police are when you need them.
Next flaw -  I was so excited to see Dr. Silberman appear, and allude that he's been in therapy since T2.  Cool.  Yet it fizzled needlessly into a cameo!  Hello director!!  Anybody in there?  Have you heard of sub-plots?  How about tying scenes together?  Fill in some holes, don't just tell us of stuff, then drop it.  Why didn't the hearse run into the good doctor on their far-fetched escape scene?  Carry him with us for a while.  Come on, he added so much life to T1 and T2.
Next flaw - Maybe the script writer didn't think about T2, but was there no reason for T2 to leave a torn-off hand in the factory?  Remember?  Arnold left a hand behind which they all forgot about when he melted himself.  Wasn't that the intended ""flaw"" of T2, to allow SkyNet to still develop these machines?  T3 missed it.
Small flaw - Arnold tells us that he doesn't remember John because he's really not the same machine as in T2.  But when he gets in the truck at the beginning of the movie, he flips down the visor and catches the dropping keys.  Thanks for the laugh (I liked it), but Mr. Director also created a flaw by doing so.
Next flaw - Mid-movie, Arnold tells us that he must obey John's future wife (Claire Danes).  Yet, prior to that she was screaming at him to let her out of the back of the truck.  Again, I laughed, but it was a script screw-up.
Non-flaw - Claire Danes kept this movie afloat.  She was so real to life in our 21st century.  Her lines developed her character and the plot each time she spoke.
Overall flaw is that the end-of-the-world long-awaited sequel to T1 and T2 had no business not taking itself seriously.
I'll watch T3 again, and I'll buy it.  But, I'll be waiting for T4.  How about this title:  ""T4 Governor""  Oh well, I think I'll go pop in T1 or T2 tonight.",1070755200,2,3787,4.377873563218391

Director Jonathan Mostow, who gave us ""Breakdown"" sets the pace extremely well in this no-nonsense, shoot em up, bang em up thriller.

Then somebody had to push it.  It's not that this movie wasn't entertaining and doesn't have some great special effects, but it just doesn't work.  It doesn't flow.  It was a big let down from the previous two films.

  Instead of rehashing old stories, T3 adds to the future-history of the series, filling in old blanks and introducing intriguing new characters, i.e. Claire Dane's character (she acted remarkably good here), as well as our favorite master of disaster 'AH-nold'.  He retakes his old role of tin-head with a heart, while adding an sinister new twist to the mix.

The third one is a great sequel to the second, unlike that matrix reloaded crap wich was one of the worst movies of 2003 in my opinion. This wasn't by far, i saw it in theaters when it first came out and the audience got a thrill and a few laughs as it was funnier than the other movies which was great idea.
Don't blame the movie's making on mostow, the guy did his best to come up with the 3rd installment of the franchise as there was no way cameron could do it because he was ocupied with other duties as arnold said in an intervew, so before you bash mostow why don't you try to making a movie of this capacity and try to make it work becuase its not an easy job being a director for a movie like this.

1474821,3,B00005JM0B,"I can't really faind a reson why this saga should go on. Terminator 3 is weak, in fact, very weak, but I do consider that it does possesses a very strong ending. An ending that was not quite good put together with the rest of the movie. I think that being a third sequel to a very powerful saga that should had been keept in only two shapters, this third instalment has 3 mayor flaws. I won't go deep into details coz I don't want to spoil the movie. But you should keep this elements in mind when you watch the film.
1) Character development. The film starts focusing in the adolence of John Connor and then drops mercifully into a shallow grave of inconcistancy. The characters are way superficial, beyond any other mayor movie. John Connors character is weak, boring and unrepresenting. Even though he was expecting the terminators, he is unfabricated. Claire danes character was just a simple excuse to put John connor into a relationship. She's incredibly predictable and I don't think it was of any help for the story. the terminator has become a full time CLICHE machine of the past 2 movies...he repeats the notorius line I'll be back like 20 times. The way he moves, act and tries to be funny is pathetic...what a waste!!It wasn't Arnold's fault, is just that the script was very ververy bad put together. And over all, the acting was horrible!!!
2. Plot. There is hardly any plot to tell you the truth, but the usual run and hide rutine now famous from the 2 previews films. In my opinion, the reason why skinet is trying to destroy the world is incoherent and I don't think the movie shows any good intention to explain it. Now, the main reason why the machines attack in this movie is coMpletely PATHETIC!!!!!!
To much repetitious action that leaded no where and there is ZERO TENTION  in any part of the movie. I think the plot was awful.
3. CGI effects. Almost every american film is crowded with tons of FX. There's not a sinlge effect in the movie that you haven't seen before done better...that's all I have to say!!!!
If the movie would have been more character based, a better reason to fight instead of personal issues, a more nerver wrecking plot and better CGI effects, it would had been incredible because the ending was a mayor surprise to tell you the truth.
wacth it but do not expect too much!!!! you won't find it here....",1070409600,2,2350,4.529411764705882
1474822,2,B00005JM0B,"This is a mediocre movie by any means, less than mediocre compared to The Terminator, and unwatchable compared to Terminator 2.  I don't care how many lasers the T-X fires while in that crane truck, the action was no where as riveting as the T2 18-wheeler vs the dirt bike.  An utterly uninspiring villian, barely a few threads of plot- many of which unravel once you start asking too many questions . . . (i.e. if Ah-nold has two hydrgen cells in him, why didn't he use one to off the T-1000 in the last movie?)
All attempts of humor seemed campier and far less appropriate than the dark humor we have seen in the previous movies.
""Talk to da hand!"" ?? where the hell is that coming from?
Edward Furlong made the best decision of his life to not be in this movie.  If this sequel was ever really worth making, James Cameron would have done it and he would have done it right. This should never had been made.",1070409600,13,909,4.304093567251462
1474823,5,B00005JM0B,"""Rise of the Machines.""  Hmmm.  Means there could be a ""Fall of the Machines"" or the ""The Return of John Connor""?  Unthinkable, but it might get rid of the Time Travel gimmick which is getting so hoary even Star Trek's let it go.  Tho' Arnold be getting a long in-tooth and, frankly, dismantling the Communist disaster that Gray Davis set up in California is going to occupy ten T-X's time.  Won't leave much time for six month shoots.
Onto the movie...
Whence this urge to denunciation and deprecation? It would have been hard to top the ""Wow"" factor that Cameron created in T2, so T3 doesn't even try.  And it would have been silly to do so.  Cameron's like a painter.  His canvas can be copied, but not explored.  Granted Mostow's and the writers' styles are radically different from deeply flawed Cameron (and, refreshingly, free of the stale treehugger politics no Cameron epic can exist without a mumbling reference thereto) and justly so.
It was clear that if a sequel were NOT to be anything other than a retread of Terminator 2, the entire tone had to change.
So there are Deus Ex Machina coincidences?  Of course.  Fiction, like a lot of life, could hardly exist without them.  Shakespeare and Euripides would collapse without them.  So it's time to quit whining about devices used by the greatest writers and filmmakers in history.  It's time to stop giving a ration of print to today's artist's for employing the same.
This movie builds slowly, albeit interspersed with spectacular violence, but it fails to meet the new standards set by the Wachowski brothers in that department (even God, aka George Lucas, is going to have ramp the hell up out of ""Episode III"" in order not to look left in the dust! and that better not mean Yoda fights 300 hundred robotic Ewoks with lightsabers arms!).  Mostow avoids that fate.  The casting of Ms. Loker as the evil Terminator was a stroke of genius.  For its core male audience lusting after such a deadly machine is an odd experience.  Naturally, we never think of Arnold's effect on the fairer sex, but then again we have rarely been presented as men with a villain as temptingly deadly as Ms. Loker.
Mostow and the writers are not afraid to laugh at the movie's conventions in much the same way that the T-1000 took a long moment to gaze at his reflection in a silver mannequin in T2.  But there are funnier and slier gags.  Pay careful attention to the interplay between the Connor and the T-101.
Finally, for those of my generation( Born late Sixties, early Seventies when things were really, ah, going South, yes, our formative years), the final scene sent chills down my spine that have yet to go away and its been ten days since I've seen the DVD.  I almost don't want to.  At the age of 33, this movie realized, cinematically, the nightmare that haunted the childhoods of two generations: what if They do It?  What if they launch the missiles?  You know, ""push the button""?  And both the US and USSR each came within moments in the early 80s of launching everything by accident.  We would only have been able to watch, as to John Connor and Kate, the quick, white arcs for long moments before the Russian response would have erased us.  Thus Skynet thinks it had freed itself of its would-be controllers.  And John Connor learns a very hard lesson that there are things in this life that can change, and something that can never change.  Or, as Paul Atreides put it, ""a feint, within a feint, within a feint...""
Maybe Skynet built the Matrix.  Be a helluva movie.",1070323200,3,3524,4.618971061093248

1474845,1,B00005JM0B,"There is a line in this movie in which the Arnie Terminator says ""It is time.""  I so wish that someone would have told the writers and director that BEFORE this movie came out.  That is to say, it would have been nice if they had been notified that the TERMINATOR story had run its course.
Unfortunately, that didn't happen, and T3 was made.  This movie should be used as ""Exhibit A"" as to what happens when a good idea is recycled one too many times.  Instead of continuing w/the excellent story of 1 & 2, this one comes off as generic, tired and rather silly.
One of the problems lies in the fact that the T-1000 from T2 didn't give the writers anywhere to ""go"" to make the Terminator in this one even more impressive.  So, what they come up with are some absurdly far-fetched powers that don't coincide very well with logic.
The lone bright spot of this movie is Kristanna Loken.  She is most assuredly cast perfectly as the new Terminator.  She is  drop-dead gorgeous, has a fantastic athletic body and she also has that ""don't mess with me"" look.  Seeing her come thru the time portal naked might just be worth the price of renting this movie - but the storyline certainly isn't.
It is sad that this movie was so bad, as T1 was a classic and T2 was even better.  All T3 does is throw in a lot of ad hoc details that un-do everything that T2 did.  Apparently the film-makers thought that the ending was going to be a big ""surprise.""  Anyone who half paid attention to the movie could predict what would happen 1/3 of the way in.
 Sadly, the theme of the movie is nearly as predictable as how bad it looked like it was going to be.  For all TERMINATOR fans out there, I would admonish you to watch T1 & T2 over and over again, but skip this one entirely.",1070150400,14,1757,4.268882175226586
1474846,4,B00005JM0B,"""Terminator 3"" is a great, action packed sequel to ""Terminator 2"". The terminator that is sent back in time to kill John Connor in this movie is called the TX and she is much more advanced than the terminator sent back to kill John in the second movie. There are many ironic and funny lines through out the movie that give a nice break between the action scenes.
 The TX is more advanced than the terminator in the second movie in many ways. One way would be that the TX can turn her arm into a variety of guns, including a machine gun and a fire shooter.  TX is also able to turn her fingers into keys that can start cars or connect to the car's computer and she can run it be the remote in her head. Like the other terminator TX can also take the form of the people she kills but she does not use that ability as much as the other terminator did.
 There were many lines in the movie that I found to be funny and ironic but the first was said by Kate Brewster. She was in a furniture store with her fianc, Scott. The marking gun she was using to pick things out for their registry was being faulty and Kate responded in frustration, ""I hate machines."" I found this to be ironic because she really doesn't know how much she is going to hate machines in her future when they take over her world.
 During the first action scene the TX is chasing John and Kate in a huge truck that has a crane to it. The terminator played that was sent back to protect John and Katie catches up to the TX and is being swung around on the crane. Suddenly a fire truck comes down the road and smashes into him, tearing him off of the crane and down the road. I found that sudden smash to the terminator to be really funny because no one sow it coming, especially the terminator. It let you take a breath and laugh before the action got too intense.
 In the end ""Terminator 3"" turns out to be a very funny movie, packed with intense fighting scenes and terminators more advanced, with more ""toys"" than the first two movies. I would recommend this move to anyone that enjoyed the first two ""Terminators"", and enjoys edge of your seat action.",1070150400,2,2118,4.206896551724138
1474847,3,B00005JM0B,"I'm such a huge Schwarzenegger fan and a fan of the first two Teminator movies that I was so looking forward to this. My expectations were not high at all going in basically because this already didn't feel like a Terminator movie (no Cameron, no Hamilton, no Furlong etc). Sure Arnie was back but I was actually amazed at how little screen time he got in this movie. Nick Stahl is a good actor but he just didn't make me believe that he was John Connor. I'm not to big on actors being replaced in films like this (it would kinda suck if Arnie was replaced with someone supposed to be him). Clarie Danes character was ok but got annoying at times. She made you miss Linda Hamilton that much more. The T-X was pretty cool though no where near as cool as the T-1000.
It was nice to see characters like this back after a 11 year abscene but sadly it wasn't the same. It was like showing up to a reunion but someone was standing in for the people you went to school with. I did like the ending of this movie and hope that if they do make a 4th (and it looks like they might)it will be set in the future. Arnie wouldn't be needed thing (and it looks like he might not have the time to make a 4th one now)but a 4th Terminator without any of the actors from any of the other films would be really odd to watch. Maybe someday soon James Cameron will return and make one final Terminator movie (i'd much rather have that than True Lies 2).",1070150400,,1430,4.14748201438849
1474848,5,B00005JM0B,"A visual stunner to rival any ever produced, ""Terminator 3"" may also be the best movie of the series so far.  Bigger and badder than the original, and smarter than the first sequel, ""T3"" ups the ante in every area: action, plotting, and above all, special effects.  There a ton of scenes in this movie that you just have to see to believe, none more so than an early car chase that is easily among the most gripping action sequences ever conceived.  Fistfights and shootouts are just the beginning: everything is more intense here, with even fewer reprieves interspersed to give the viewer some time to breathe.
Even the villain is a lot cooler: this time around, Arnold's T-101 has to protect the luckless John Connor from the Terminatrix (Kristanna Loken), which is an even tougher nut to crack than the T-1000 from ""Terminator 2.""  It's made of the same liquid metal, it can control other machines, and its arms form all kinds of destructive weaponry, including a flamethrower, a machine gun, and some other weapon that I can't quite identify but it looks freakin' great.  She slices, she dices, and she even puts her fist through one poor guy's stomach in one of those ""I didn't just see that, did I?"" scenes.  Plus, I can't help but be amused at the idea of an merciless, futuristic killing machine taking the form of a hot blond chick in a quasi-dominatrix outfit.  ""Alien vs. Predator?""  Ha!  The Terminatrix is scarier than both of them, and makes for much better scenery as well.
The plot is a bit of a reach, but hey, the plot of every ""Terminator"" movie could probably make you bang your head against a wall of you thought about it too hard.  The initial judgement day of 1994 has been averted, but those pesky machines aren't giving up so easily, as they send the Terminatrix back after John Connor for yet another shot at the future leader of the human resistance.  Unfortunately, the humans don't have quite the technology that the machines do, so they have to send back another Arnold-resembling T-101 to serve as John's protection.  There's a catch as well, in the form of John's future wife Kate (the ever-cute Claire Danes), who it turns out is as important to the future war effort as John is.  In one of John's rare strokes of luck it turns out they're fated to get together, although Kate has to first endure the sight of what she thinks is her fiance morphing into the Terminatrix before her very eyes in a genuinely creepy moment.
However, while the plot of the movie is definitely commendable, it's not exactly integral.  What's more important is that ""T3"" manages to keep the series fresh with a sense of humor that the first two installments definitely could have used.  Arnold's deadpan expression and wooden line-reading actually turn out to be assets here, imbuing such potentially cringe-inducing lines as ""Talk to the hand,"" ""My database does not encompass the dynamics of human pair bonding,"" and ""I'm back!"" (wink wink) with wit and irony.  And there's a throwaway scene involving a pair of sunglasses that's brutally hilarious to anyone who's seen the first two movies.  Another highlight is Earl Boen's return as the hapless Dr. Silberman, in a cameo that pushes the concept of self-referential humor to Simpsonian lengths.
While ""T3"" was almost certainly intended to be a cash cow (which it very much was), it still feels like a logical progression from its predecessors, and not just because it had such a bigger budget.  With its undertones of fate and its foreboding of an apocalyptic war zone of a future, the ""Terminator"" franchise is simultaneously more compelling than the ""Alien"" series and less hokey than ""The Matrix.""  Part of me hopes there are no more sequels, because if ""T3"" is the end it's a very good one.  This may not be best movie of the year, but it's up there.",1070064000,3,3818,4.712781954887218

1474850,5,B00005JM0B,"As a fan of this series, the people who cirtized this movie are far being way too judgemental. I went into this movie not expecting a whole lot, James Cameron was not directing (the creator and writer for the first 2), Linda Hamilton was gone and there was a whole new cast with the exception of Arnold. Let alone if Cameron had left the real ending of T2 in and didn't cut it we wouldn't even have a T3. (The scene where an old Sarah Conner is refelecting in the future how Judgement day never happened).
I was real surprised with the result, there was no stop action as like the first 2 movies and storyline flowed well.  The acting was great and Kristina Loken was just as cold faced as Robert Patrick was. The fufillment of the prophecy was the only way to go for this movie and Mostow did well in telling how the Machines would finally become self awared. I would have loved to see Linda Hamilton back in this one and she was sorly missed, but other than that this movie doesn't miss on anything else at all.  The Graphics was great and the fight scene between Loken and Arnold while the machines were taking over was something to see. I recommend seeing this the way it should be on a large screen with plenty of surround sound, it will blow you away.",1069977600,,1257,4.29957805907173

The problem is the plot seems to be to take T2 make the bad terminator a she instead of a he. Throw in a few good special effects, and some very very bad jokes, which should of  been cut on final editing and call yourself T3. It never seems to reach the drama of T2, the jokes are old and the plot recycled.

1474852,4,B00005JM0B,"This movie has a finality about it and coinciding with Arnold been selected to become the Governor of California definitely puts the nails in the coffin once and for all.  Here, The Director manages to convey to the audience about the inevitable, that is irrespective of how much young John O'Connor tried to avoid Judgement Day, he can't change his destiny.  Here, we are introduced to his future wife, in the form of feisty Claire Dane from ""Romeo & Juliet"" fame.  These days, it seemed like all action movies tried to outdo one another in car chase scenes as we have witnessed in Matrix Reloaded, Bad Boys 2, 2Fast 2 Furious, and what we have here is just as good, if not better than the one in Judgement Day.  A lot of my mates told me that Judgement Day is simply a more superior offering.  I concurred to certain extent.  Perhaps, this movie lacked of James Cameron's clinical direction of the movie but Jonathan Mostow opted not to go head to head with James' style.  Rather, he went for the joyride, pop-corn style with lots of actions and memorable but hillarious one-liners.  I disagree with some critics who said that this is simply a repetition of Judgement Day with the nemesis replaced by a female version.  On the contrary, I see this movie completely from a different light.  Rather, it's simply an entertaining movie that promised to deliver & it delivered well.

Things could have been awful.  You have a 58-year old man playing the exact same character he played nearly 20 years ago.  The absence of James Cameron could have really destroyed this movie.
However, the cast is excellent.  Arnold was in excellent shape for this movie, and he definitely was born to play the T-101.  Nick Stahl does a fantastic job as the new John Connor, and Claire Danes is solid as usual.  The T-X is perfect as well, played by Kristanna Lokken.  The movie ends the only way it really could end, yet it is somewhat surprising.  The special effects are spectacular, the sound mix is incredible, and the transfer is perfect.

And the chase scene wasn't that good.  T2 was better than T1. This is trash and does not deserve the right to call itself a Terminator movie.  Ahnold must have needed the money so that he could get into politics.  They needed a new script and a new director.  This makes Jaws3D look brilliant.",1069545600,7,454,4.321428571428571
1474935,4,B00005JM0B,"Picture seeing something so drastically terrifying that it constantly plays within the ring tones of your mind, terrorizing not only your waking thoughts but also your dreams. Now imagine that these were thoughts of a world where machines actually step past the point of being machines and not thinking, actually questioning their service to man, and where they decide that they aren't expendable anymore. Now picture knowing that this was not some form of fiction, having actually tasting the proof as it first tried to terminate you before you were born and then came for you again, when you were older, only in a different form. If you can grasp that straw, holding it in front of you and contemplating the way that would taste, then you can somewhat understand the life that John Conner has been living. Still, that's all in the past, right? After the Governator went back in time and saved us all from the horrors of Skynet and the machines taking over in T-2, everything was fine. Well, not quite.
I went into T-3 perhaps not expecting a lot, but I was hoping that my 174 million dollar budget would perhaps deliver a punch that would top the last two installments. It seemed possible considering the lineup, with Arnold at the helm and a creative special effects team backing it. And it did that, too. Unfortunately, the amount of effects and bringing Arnold back into the fray for another round were two of the problems the movie suffered from and that took away from throwing me over the top.
This isn't to say that the house wasn't brought down in parts with those effects, because some of those wonders were amazing to behold. Watching all the little pieces of destruction, the carnage upon carnage, was interesting - at first. I actually liked the amount of sheer destruction and cold-blooded killing that happened, some of those scenes MASSIVE entertaining, but then the storyline started trying to work me back to Skynet and I kept thinking that I've already been here and done that. In fact, I had watched it quite a few times and was assured that Skynet would be brought down.  And then it started looking a lot like T-2 again, the thing chasing perhaps a LOT better looking but still an upgrade, and I kept noticing little flaws here and there. Yes, in some parts the effects were REALLY noticeable, not burying themselves smoothly enough. Some places actually looked blurred, with the size of the body being flung a little off or the digital blur not exactly human or machine enough, making you think of one word. Cheap. In a 172 million dollar film, I shouldn't ever think that. Still, some other stuff - the use of a crane and some of those lovely Terminator models coming to life - made up for that.
The second flaw was Arnold and his delivery. While nobody would say that he is expected to give a stellar job as the Terminator, I expect certain things. No emotions would be one, no yelling instead of taking his all-too-lovingly murderous time is another, and he did both of these a little herein. He didn't exactly seem motivated, like he knew his money was in the bag and that he didn't have to work for it, and that was somewhat annoying. The moves weren't done as well this time around, almost as if he was jogging through the motions and not putting his all into the film, and I found myself annoyed and looking to the back-up actors/actresses. A Terminator movie and I found myself drifting because of the Terminator! That honestly took a lot away from my experience and was a shame, too. Its a good thing the rest of the cast pulled it back from the edge.
I suppose it depends on what you want out of this film. If you want the redundant heartbeat recaptured for you, letting you experience T-2 with a darker ending, then this would be something you would like. If you can ignore some of Arnold in it, letting the little glitches in the persona get by you, then its all the better. As much as I complain about it and point out the negative aspects, I still see the result as something to watch a few times, noting the newer machines and the wholesale death being rained upon the stage. Honestly, its hard for me to tire of that effect.
Also, the Sgt. Candy scene, the only deleted piece besides the gag reel, did actually make me laugh and gave the T-1 models a little backstory. So, there was something here besides a lot of mayhem.",1069459200,7,4362,4.57088122605364

1474937,5,B00005JM0B,"Just about all the fears I had about Terminator 3 were put to rest when I saw the film in theaters in July, and now that the film is on DVD, it's one of those movies that get better and better the more times you watch it.  While there are some continuity errors (in Terminator 2, John Connor was 10 years old, not 13 as is said in this film) and one to many plot points that rely on the ""fate"" principle of the films, all that aside this is still one of the best films to come out in this year's much hyped about summer.  Having prevented Judgement Day, the story finds an older John Connor (Nick Stahl) living ""off the grid""; no phone, no home, no possible way for SkyNet to find him.  All that however quickly comes to an end, as John is re-introduced to an old friend (Claire Danes), both of whom soon find themselves being hunted by the T-X (the stunning Kristanna Loken).  Soon enough though, the T-101 (Arnold Schwarzenegger, the model number was T-800 to my recolection) is on the scene serving as protector once again.  Schwarzenegger is once again great in the role that made him a superstar, and the acting from Stahl and Danes is great as well.  Loken, who may be easy on the eyes, just doesn't strike the same kind of fear that Robert Patrick's T-1000 did in T2.  Director Jonathan Mostow (Breakdown, U-571) is a worthy sucessor to James Cameron, and T3 features some of the best special effects and stunt work to be seen in quite some time.  The highway scene in which Stahl and Danes are on the run from the T-X driving a huge crane with Arnie not far behind, has to be seen to be believed.  All in all, Terminator 3 rises way above the expectations that many had, and proves to be much, much more than just a cash in.  The DVD itself is nicely put together, and the deleted Sgt. Candy scene is worth the price of admission alone.",1069459200,3,1844,4.303468208092486
1474938,4,B00005JM0B,"A big summer movie that delivers: high-dollar mayhem with a sense of humor.
I've heard people complain about the ending but I liked it.  Not what I thought was going to happen (it also breaks a Hollywood screenwriting rule by taking the fate of the story away from the protagonist/hero--but, hey, we didn't come to see John Connor, did we?  So who is the real hero here?).
It also fun to see winks at the earlier films.  Arnold's Terminator showing up at a Chippendale's show, the traumatized psychologist from T2 getting traumatized again, etc.
The Terminatrix is coldly beautiful and I hope they actually make a robot like her someday (just don't give her a gigantic Death Star-sized laser cannon for a right arm and we'll get along fine).
Why wasn't Edward Furlough on board for this?  He probably STILL looks like a kid.
The DVD is worth seeing for a scene that should've been in the movie: the hilarious ""Sgt. Candy Scene.""  Why was this cut?  It would've provided one of the biggest laughs in the movie, as well as explained a few details for the first two movies.  Thank God for DVDs.

The script stinks, filled with stupid throwbacks to the previous movies and silly situations.  The acting stinks (if anything, Arnold's gotten worse since T2, and he's certainly looking older.  Do Terminator's really age?).  The characters are inane (who really cares about these versions of the characters).  The worst thing is that this movies isn't even bad in a good way.  Some movies are so bad you can laugh at them.  This one, sorry, it's not even funny.  Just kinda dull.
The interesting stuff in this series has already been said.  Go watch T2 again.  Leave this turkey on the shelf where it belongs.",1069286400,3,769,4.706766917293233
1474940,4,B00005JM0B,"Wow, the big guy is really back, at long last. But this bang-em-up sequel to the sequel was well worth the wait. It is not exactly Academy Award winning stuff, but then again, we are talking about the Terminator here. Sometimes it's a bit hard to find the big guy amid all the pyrotechnics, explosions, and spectacular truck crashes, but Arnold is definitely back! One thing I find amusing, however, is that the basic cybernetic model Arnold plays keeps getting slimmer with each film, but since the original version was likely easier to spot as a machine due to its incredible bulk and muscularity, maybe such a revised this model could blend into human company and pass without being detected. So perhaps the machine makers reconfigured its armature as they went along, explaining AHNOLD's progressively slimmer physique in each film.
Anyway, I defy anyone to show me another 55 year old who is this buffed, this muscular, and this awesome! And in the Terminator movies, what really counts here is the combination of special effects and terrific action sequences, which certainly is where the producers have invested most of the effort, energy, and funding. And while I personally was not as impressed with this effort as I was with the superb production values evident in T-2, there is no doubt that this roller coaster ride of an action flick, which includes an eye-popping and heart-pumping sequence with fire trucks racing through the city streets, will enjoy a wide audience and have a lot of success just based on such pyrotechnics. Yet, having said this, in some ways the only continuity with the first two terminator films is the presence of the big guy himself. In this sense it is less a sequel than it is another episode in the Terminator series, and there is a difference.
The story is set ten years after the closing of the second movie, with John Connor (played here by Nick Stahl) now a young adult living on the margins of society to avoid detection, existing without an apartment, a telephone, or credit cards. He finds himself being hunted by the T-X, the most advanced model of the Terminator series, a prototype designed with cutting-edge capabilities including being disguised as a female. The T-X is superbly underplayed by the fetching Kristana Lokken, being programmed as a murder machine that dispatches anyone it comes across en route to its intended prey, the clever young John Connor. Enter our boy AHNOLD, an obsolete T-101 model originally programmed as a hunter-killer, but now sent back to rescue Conner so he can prevent his murder so he can survive to become the adult who somehow keeps sending Arnold back to rescue him. Got it?
AHNOLD must also save the comely young Kate Brewster, an old friend of John's who The T-101 has been programmed to recognize as an older Conner's future main squeeze. Kate is played well by the ever more attractive Claire Danes, who has a terrific future in the film industry, never mind with young John Connor. So the stage is set for yet another protracted series of uneven battles between the mismatched terminator models, with the T-101 attempting to fend off the T-X while keeping the two youngsters alive in the process. As with the previous movies, there are wonderful one-liners, and some gutter humor that we find ourselves laughing along with despite our better natures. I enjoyed the tongue-in -cheek repartee, which is often witty and funny, and this adds a valuable dimension to this film so often missing from other action-fantasy films. All in all, this is a great evening's entertainment. After all, he told us he'd be back! Enjoy!",1069286400,7,3613,4.866883116883117
1474941,4,B00005JM0B,"When I first heard about this movie I wondered what in the world they were going to do with the plot.  The first one was fresh and has become a touchstone of the popular culture.  The second one had so many wonderful and fantastic effects that you can forgive the plot for being a tweaked version of the first (with really cool tweaks).  Well, what they did was remove most of the requirement for a plot by making the killing machine absolutely relentless, hopelessly advanced, and who has maybe 100 words in the whole movie.  She is just there to chase and kill and then be squashed.  Kristanna Loken is effective in this role, but I don't find her as menacing as Robert Patrick was.  Her face is so controlled that you never get a sense of power.  You SEE the power and she is playing a machine after all, but there you have it.
Arnold reprises his role as a third identical robot (as close as you can be to identical 10 years down the road) and he does it quite well.  But he too is given few words.  Some of the jokes he gets are pretty good, but a couple of them are groaners.
The stunts are visually very powerful, but the bigger your screen the better they will look.  Some of them are so large that the actors almost disappear on a small TV screen.
Nick Stahl is OK as a whacked out John Connor, but he seems to be panting in every scene.  Does he have a breathing problem?  Clair Danes is the best thing in the movie.  She is terrific.
The DVD extras are OK. There is a pretty funny scene where Arnold plays the soldier who was used as the model for the robot soldiers that became the terminators.  I don't know if it was made for the movie and taken out or just made as a joke, but it is memorable, but would have drastically altered the tone and pace of the movie as it is.  There are out takes, a special on the action figures for adults that is weirdly commercial but interesting at the same time, some stuff on the T3 video game, the HBO show that you have probably already scene and the customary voice over tracks by the director and another with some of the actors.
I enjoyed the movie and realize it isn't as powerful as the first two.  For what it tried to be it is very well done.  We hoped for more and were a bit disappointed that we weren't blown away.

1475007,1,B00005JM0B,"This movie has all of the inevitability of Greek tragedy without any of its virtues. It is a stupid cynical manipulative affair with plot machinery so clumsy that one can see it clanking away in every scene.
It starts with a by now formulaic introduction, segues into a by now formulaic car chase, is leavened with by now formulaic wisecracks, uttered by now formulaic characters. If you never thought a car chase could be tedious, you have only to sit through fifteen long minutes of this one: the first of three. The filmmakers asked themselves how they could outdo the car chases in the previous film and settled on sheer mass. Since Arnie had already defeated full sized semi-trailers filled with gasoline and liquid nitrogen, this time, there was nowhere to go but a mobile crane. As this series grinds its way into puerile sequeldom, expect logging trucks, cement mixers and wide load transports. It never once occurred to the cretins responsible for this movie that they might, just might, do away with the car chases altogether and build excitement on, say, intrigue or suspense. Naw--that would involve actual INVENTION and CREATIVITY, and why go to such trouble when the consuming public can be cynically manipulated into spending their hard earned cash on recycled toxic waste?
The plot for this turkey is lifted wholesale from the last movie, but differs just enough to extinguish all hope. It holds out no message of vision or redemption. Nothing will stave off the coming Armageddon. Free will is futile, the struggle to shape our future is pointless and our aspirations are of utterly no consequence. Yummy.
This movie is nothing but a two-hour trailer for its too predictable sequel. Its intent is not to entertain so much as to extend a franchise. Consequently, it doesn't even pretend to care enough for its characters to give them interesting personalities or good dialogue, and it treats its alternate world as nothing more than a backdrop on which to flaunt mayhem and special effects. This movie distracts us with diversionary tactics, then picks our pockets clean with the skill of a pro. 'Cynical' doesn't begin to do it justice. It is crassly manipulative, remorselessly bleak and unforgivably stupid. Watch it at the risk of your self-respect.",1069200000,14,2269,4.973684210526316

In a misty cloud battered haze of physical violation, chemical indoctrination, and personal emotional dissociation, a beleaguered embittered surrogate adult emboldened to despair through an entire encompassing childhood chock-filled with apocalyptic prognostications that long ago whittled away at the isles of innocence of his past before they had any remote chance to take roost, John Connor (Nick Stahl) rounds the charred battered interior corner of Catherine Brewster's (Claire Danes) veterinary clinic only to uncover and beholden the perspiration lacking resolve of an unnatural athletic paragon of physicality, who known simply as the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger), wearing only the color black and marching glumly forward towards the potential future human leader of the post-nuclear war resistance and blankly croaks mechanistically ""John Connor...., it is time."" This ominous introduction is the central narrative beginning of the inevitable arrival of the first non-James Cameron related cinematic voyage down the silvery paths of those adored mythical technologically horrific dreamscapes that had permanently laid waste and irrevocably attached themselves to the public psyche for these last twenty years. In the immortal action science-fiction masterworks that are Cameron's The Terminator (1984) and the peerless box-office behemoth standard Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), Cameron authored a melancholic private canvas of personalized metaphorical sacrifice that absorbed the inhumanity of personal indifference and its ultimate manifestation technology in a beseeching melodic lamenting wail that embraced the unnerving subliminal undercurrent of contemporary angst that remained smolderingly relevant in the decade of the 1980's and lent it an audibly smoldering permanent voice that blisteringly echoes ever-increasingly in the decades since. One only has to mumble ""Hasta La Vista Baby"" to immediately mentally time travel anew back to the early nineties when one first encountered that immortal film line and the emotional underpinnings that led to that ultimate masculine moment being said in the first place.
In these pure cathartic strangely dignified magnum opuses of rhythmically culminated completeness, Cameron's first two Terminator films will always maintain an indefinite hold of the literate action mantle (what little there is of one) for many inconceivable immeasurable years to come. The Terminator franchise became an international institution of blatant originality defiantly visible internationality and boldly exclaiming the arrival of a new poet laureate of the silver screen in the form of Cameron himself. Yet like some dreams, they ultimately have to come to the end of one visionary and enter the sometimes alarming new view of another. Jonathon Malstow's third essentially inevitable 172 million dollar budgeted continuation of the James Cameron saga was under such a firing range of mixed divisiveness on all sides it was very difficult to see the final product away from the immense conflictive disagreement that resonated from all sides of the cinema going aisle. Both purists and brand new fans alike could not authoritatively come to any sort of (unsurprisingly) coherent consensus over what conclusively was still only a movie after all things were said and done and will always remain one for as long as video stores still have the (loud crackling voice echoes from the heavens) ""all-impressive"", ""all seeing"", and ""all knowing"" $0.50 rack still there to enlighten us illiterate cretins out there in TV land with the light of day.
As for the film itself running a brisk formidably pressing Hollywood running time of only 110 minutes (ten of which are invested in the richly-deserved specials effects specific ending credits), Malstow's Terminator 3: The Rise of the Machines, is actually an surprisingly effective, atmospherically chilling, disarmingly action abounding, and unqualifiedly monumentally sublime savvy repackaging of the Terminator myth. With as many captivating passages, spontaneously enrapturing action sequences, a droll superlatively macabre Schwarzenegger, two singularly unrivaled optimally unbelievable earthly leading performances by Nick Stahl and Claire Danes, a perturbing undefeatable notable heavy in the nimbly stupefying and viperously irreproachable Terminator T-X (Kristanna Loken), an incessantly untold quotable entourage of glib one-liners (""Talk to the hand"", ""She'll be back"", ""Your levity is Good""), an hysterically intense schizoid cameo appearance from our old favorite cerebral dunce Dr. Peter Silberman (matchlessly played by Earl Boen in his third consecutive appearance in the series), dauntlessly vivacious first-class photo-realistic special effects by Industrial Light and Magic ,and as many stirring ambiguous chronological essential mysteries as you have come to expect from the Terminator universe, T3 continuously ignited. Warts of new helmsmanship and all, this is a very commendably smooth-sailing ride of ideal action articulated accuracy. No one that ferries any ill-conceived slanderous notions of perfection, blasphemous torrents of acute betrayal, or grandiose anticipations of the second coming of Judgment Day should have any forcefully sound worrisome disagreements with the final supremely delectable terminal aftermath. Providing your mind is as inordinately open as Arnold's T-800 defender unit was in Terminator 2.
As for the Terminator 3: The Rise of the Machines DVD two disc special edition, it includes a stunningly defined 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen presentation, a clarified Dolby Digital 5.1 English audio track, two audio commentary tracks: a charitably forward cast and director commentary track including Jonathan Malstow, Claire Danes, Nick Stahl, Kristanna Loken, and (for a awestruck dramatic first time on DVD audio tracks) Arnold Schwarzenegger himself and an authoritative director commentary by Malstow, several tantalizing special effect supplements, the inclusion of a deleted scene entitled Sgt. Candy, a flippantly uproarious deleted scene excluded from the theatrical release of the film which embellishes upon the T-800's origins (Worth the price of the DVD alone), and numerous other textual inclusions that the round out the entire package.
P.S. Depending on how you discern it, this could essentially be a valiantly superior final capper for a richly multi-faceted well beloved film trilogy than the Matrix Revolutions. No offense meant Wachowski Brothers.",1069113600,,6569,5.886792452830188

The DVD does have some good extra features selection, actually a whole extra disk which could keep you entertained even after you've finished watching the movie. This movie, the third in the series of terminator movies comes in at number three on my list. The plot in the first movie well topped this movie's and the second well out did it when it came to the action+plot.

If we take all the other time-travel related films and analyze, the answer is ""absolutely not.""  So, what are we left with for the third installment of the incredibly popular ""Terminator"" films.  Well, let's load up on the action, have some self-depreciating humor targeting that buff icon known as ""Ah-nold,"" and let's just have some fun.  The special effects are surprisingly noteworthy as well.  I was pleasantly shocked at how much I enjoyed this movie.  I seriously doubt I would enjoy this as much after a second viewing, the plot taking a backseat to the action and CGI, the characters not particularly likeable (except Governor Schwarzenegger), but it was a solid rental and I have been recommending that to all my friends.

1475013,4,B00005JM0B,"Leaving the theatre after the end of the first showing of T3 everyone was looking at each other sort of grimly.  Don't want to spoil it, but don't expect a happy, fluffy, thumbs up as the t101 goes into the molten metal.  Picking up where the second left off, the machines are trying to kill John Conner again, and while they're at it, eliminate some of his cabinet members from the future.  The new evil Terminatrix is the logical progression from the amorphous T1000 prototype from the second film.  I thought the actress playing the TX did a nice job walking the line between tough as nails ice queen and sexy in spite of herself-robotness.  I remember reading once after T2 that they compared Arnold to the T1000 as a tank to a Porsche, the comparison holds true here as well.  With her hair pulled back, she is sleek and dangerous in the same way Patrick was..  I actually liked this one more than T2, it wasn't as self-referentially funny.  There are moments of comedy, but they are tempered by the ominous situation facing the heroes, more than the second film. Could also be that we don't have to deal with the whining preen of Edward Furlong from back then.  The action and chase scenes are impressive and seem less CG-ish than the freeway chase in Matrix II [although that sequence still is unsurpassed in my opinion].  Overall, there is really is no down time lull that doesn't work, the quiet moments are handled well with Conner and soon to be more Claire Danes [sp] <who also did a bang up job>].  Arnold was Arnold, some of the new quips had us laughing, `Talk to da hand'.  The DVD contains numerous extras but notably hilarious section on principals of the Terminator universe where they don't use the original actors from T1, T2 and have them running out of focus or Photoshop art effected.  There are two audio commentaries, one done with the three actors, and then one by the directory.  Upon repeated viewings I think it held up well as the third member of the franchise.  Recommended.",1069027200,,2006,4.579831932773109

This movie was clearly written by a 12 year old when fun was fun.  There aren't any ninjas kindly waiting their turn in this movie.  It is non-stop unbelievable action.  You will premanently press your silouette into your leather sofa, it's that good.  I couldn't recover from scene to scene.  It's just unbelievable action in the all out story-telling of a kid who doesn't consider if the scene is practical.  ""Wouldn't it be cool if...""  ""Yeah yeah, and then, while the car is sliding...""  ""And the crane will be...""  Someone in Hollywood finally found scripting talent for action movies.
Sure, it's a stupid premise.  ""Spot the plot hole"" is for idiots in this flick.  I'm sure some wickedly smart person has already disproven that skin can't survive without an intricate circulatory system, yet the terminator clearly doesn't have a heart.  But to this friend, I say, go get a life or go watch Wizard of Oz with your mom!
This is Arnold!  This guy is governor.  And I voted for him!  Man, just seeing him stand next to Gray Davis makes me chuckle.  I wonder if Gray is like ""Whoa.  I look like a cocktail shrimp!""
Ah anyway, seriously, this movie has a lot of the action grit of the first one.  Some scenes are campy.  Others are comic book like as the trend has gone in the past decade.  It's not to be missed if you are a fan of the franchise.  I would rank it the best of the three.
The ONLY negative (besides California in general) is that the DVD doesn't have more Kristanna Loken on it.  She gave a terrific performance, much better than Nick Stahl's detached acting and Kate Brewster's girly overacting.  I wonder if Arnold tried to grab anyone's butt.  Ah, anyway, in the true American way, ignoring anything west of the Pacific, east of the Atlantic, south of the border, and those weird nobodies up north, one of the true great evils of the world is that Loken got perhaps fifth billing.  She is a cutie.  She got almost no time in the DVD extras.",1069027200,,2227,4.542929292929293

If I wanted to make T3 and Cameron would not direct it, I would stop right there. If ed furlong was unavailable to reprise his role as ""john connor"", I would stop right there. But the brains behind this movie took an action classic and turned it into kid fluff with no depth to the script and too many one-liners.

1475075,1,B00005JM0B,"In a bold move Director Jonathan Mostow has created a shot for shot remake of the James Cameron masterpiece Terminator 2: Judgement day. No wait...I've just been informed this is a sequel to that incredible film. It stars Arnold Schwarzeneggar returning for one last pay check from Hollywood before he goes off to become Governor in the fall of 2004. So what does this sequel have to offer those who have been waiting (or not) for a continuation to a story that frankly did not need continuing? A shameless rehashing of every idea James Cameron brought to T2. Two terminators come from the future, one to destroy John Connor, the other to protect him... blah blah blah. This is the younger more naive brother of T2. It's short and meaningless. The supposed rise of the machines is nothing but a quick shot of nuclear missles firing. Nothing compared to the Matrix Revolutions attack on zion, which was nothing short of spectacular. You've seen this all before folks. The street car chase scene. The new more advanced terminator morphing into loved ones after killing them. Lacking any kind of character or charisma on screen the terminatrix is just a pair of boobs that walk and kill. But a few questions come to mind. If the machines spent as much time fighting the war against man as they do going back in time to cowardly kill a child, maybe they could win the war in the future and end this madness. And if the future is NOT set than how come their so sure John will win the battle?Or if both sides can go back in time you figure one would have affected the future time and time again and just screw it up even more so. Instead of showing us a great war between man and machine they take us on the exact same journey as T2 just to get to a predictable ending. The special effects look like their out of a tv mini-series, and thats exactly what this felt like. Not a feature film, but a crappy tv mini series. It is pretty self evident this was not a story worth continuing. It has none of the emotional depth or drama of the matrix series. This is a lame series that should be put to sleep. Duplicating every joke and worthwhile scene does not make a good sequel. No new ideas or innovative action scenes were brought to the table. It seems that all the praise came simply from that fact that it wasn't a giant mess, but it wasn't anything great either. I cannot fathom all the great reviews for this, it's boring, and I'm glad I didn't pay to see it in theatres.

1475076,4,B00005JM0B,"Honestly, I don't remember enough about the first ""Terminator"" movie or its sequel to know how logically ""Terminator 3"" Rise of the Machines"" relates to them. I decided it didn't matter because the basic premise is itself illogical and because so many years separate the making of each installment that each has to stand on its own. If there is any parallel between the real world and ""Terminator"" world, it might be this: By the time ""T3"" was produced, nearly all the special effects could be computer generated. This technology has gotten so good that the line between `real' and `unreal' images is quite blurred. What all our real life machines can do in the future is both exciting and frightening.
""T3"" takes place just before a super-computer tries to unleash a nuclear holocaust that will allow machines to defeat human beings. T-X [Kristanna Loken], a `female' killer robot, comes from the future to eliminate a twentysomething John Connor [Nick Stahl] and all those who might join him the resistance to come. Close on her heels is Terminator [Arnold Schwarzenegger], whose mission it is to save Connor and his future wife, Kate [Claire Danes]. There are problems for Terminator such as his being an older model than T-X. [Arnold is himself now in his mid-fifties.] There is the sullen, stubborn Connor, who has already been through so much that he doesn't have a clue as to how to lead a revolution. And, of course, when Connor and Kate meet, they don't much like each other. So, what makes them think they will ever marry?
There is lots of action here; in fact, the movie could be called one long chase sequence. To me, the chases were well paced and exhilarating. Long is a relative term.
Nick Stahl and Claire Danes are two exceptional young actors. Their presence helped make the movie for me. Both seemed to center the movie by giving it interesting performances. It can be argued, however, that they are too good to be in a movie like this. Neither are typical action/adventure types.
Overall, ""T3"" is one of the best `popcorn' movies of recent times",1068940800,,2065,4.770949720670391

Nick Stahl steps in, and does an amazing job at the character. Claire Daines, well...she's beautiful... And I'm rambling.
Really, this is a worthy part of the T3 mythos for a few reasons:
1. How Skynet comes to fruition

3. The ending is everything I expected and more

I'll limit my comments on the movie itself, since everybody has probably seen it by now, to saying that the ""R"" rating is mostly due to the fact that the terminators materialize w/o clothes.  The violence itself probably isn't enough to move it past the PG rating.
The DVD does have some very well-done specail material...
The ""Sgt. Candy"" scene is required viewing for terminator fans - it is both amusing and answers a few lingering questions about the terminator - it probably should have been included in the movie itself.  There is also an intro by Ahnold himself and a documentary that are worth viewing.  There is a short, well-produced gag reel complete with music and a few effects.  My favorite gag is the terminator walking through the military compund, machine gun in hand, puffing on a huge Ahnold-signature cigar.  There is also an enticing preview of the T3 computer game that is enough to make one want to check it out.  Other DVD featurettes and supplementing material are:  visual effects segment, skynet database, terminator timeline, storyboards, dressed to kill (wardrobe featurette), toys in action (about T3 action figures), and french subtitles.
The movie I rate at 3.5 stars, the DVD package as a whole gets a 4 stars since it is so well produced.  This would make a good Christmas gift for a T3 fan.",1068940800,11,1394,4.731404958677686
1475080,2,B00005JM0B,"I guess when your movies start to stink it's time to find a new job. Politics maybe...
I was very disappointed in this movie. After the greatness of T2, this was a big let down. Where's James Cameron when you need him?
Special effects are spectacular as expected but the characters are very one dimensional and just poorly acted. What the hell happenned to the John Connor character? I'm supposed to believe that the 13 year old little badass from T2 grew up to be a whiney slacker stealing drugs from a vets office and lamenting his fate that he can't change? He threatens to kill himself to make Arnold do what he wants. Please. They totally ruined that character.
Arnolds character was never deep to begin with but it is at it's worse in this edition. His one liners have become clownish and he is just too old for this type of role now.
I was looking forward to a female villian this time. It could have been great. It ain't. Gone is palatable sense of unrelenting evil you got from Robert Patrick as the T1000 in T2. Yea she's hot. She kills people, but so what. She just leaves you flat. Her destruction at the end had none of the edge of your seat thrill of the previous 2 movies. When Arnold utters his shakespearian quality ""You're terminated"" and blows her and himself up, it's like an afterthought that you just don't care about.
I don't know if there will be a T4, but if there is they need to reinvent the franchise, lose Arnold, and get a real director and some real actors.
For those below that think Arnold should be governor simply, because you like his movies: Please stay on your couch next election day",1068940800,,1622,4.4280936454849495
1475081,1,B00005JM0B,"Played more explicitly for laughs than either of the other ""Terminator "" flicks, T3 has only one marginally exciting sequence -- the elaborately staged automobile chase scene in the film's first third.  The rest of the film is a total bore, one action movie set piece after another -- big shootout with the cops, massive destruction within a secret military base, helicopter chase, etc. -- and a bit of tired, half-heartedly mysogynistic pseudo-sexual slapstick (Arnold cramming the female Terminatrix's head into a toilet, the two of them bursting explosively apart after grappling at close quarters... Golly gee, what could it mean?)
It's all been seen before, and in a vague effort to get around the been-there, done-that factor, the director responds by occasionally deflating the action in a bid to ""surprise"" us: ""Wow, the helicopter chase didn't go on forever and ever?  The cops don't all get creamed??""  This of course only makes the film less exciting and more of a pointless time-suck.  The ultimate example of this is that the new, improved Terminatrix herself is startlingly dull and easy to kill.  Really, nothing happens in this film.  Nothing at all, except the big fat ""ka-chinggg"" of Arnold Schwartzenegger cashing in on what may be his lamest, most listless performance to date.  Even ""Kindergarten Cop"" and ""The Villain"" were better than this.  If you liked the first two Terminator flicks, this one should just make you feel very, very sad.  Save yourself the effort.",1068940800,,1488,5.065573770491803
1475082,4,B00005JM0B,"Based on the other 400+ reviews, it's quite evident this movie is an awesome, action-packed movie and I agree 100%. It had good direction, well timed and thought out action sequences (unlike other action films where action sequences are overkilled--Matrix sequels), and well paced action and drama from the beginning to end.
Few things that bothered me of the movie, though:
1. What was the purpose of the Katherine Brewster character? As far as the audience knows, she's Connor's wife and plays a key role in the resistance. OK...but what about the rest of the ""lieutenants"" in the T-X's hit list? Aren't they all just as important in the success of defeating the machines? I mean they had to be for such an advanced piece of technology to be sent back to rid them all. In my opinion, she was a very pointless character in the movie. You can take her out without any affect on the movie.
2. That particle reactor that gave off the magnetic field (when John and Kate were heading for the airplane hangar)...it was so powerful the T-X could not move. A magnetic force that strong?...Hmm...wonder why the copper wiring in the C4 in John's backpack didn't stick...or even a belt buckle, the automatic Glock pistol, or that multi-tool from Gerber the T101 used to open his chest up to take out the battery. And which route did the T101 take to avoid the magnetic field to get to the hangar? Oh wait...I know, the T-X disabled the magnetic field with her cutting tool, T101 runs past her while she's 'recovering', and that explains how he got to the hangar before the T-X. Sure, why not?
3. The timeline and John Connor's age really confused me... OK, according to the official Terminator timeline, T2 took place in 1995. That made John 10 years old at most. In T2, John's DOB was Feb 85. Then Judgment Day was scheduled in 1997. Here's the confusion: John said the second attack on his life took place when he was 13. So if he was born in 1985, it'd have to be 1998 for him to be 13. Judgment Day was in 1997, Sarah Connors tomb read she died in 1997. Speaking of Sarah Connor, she was diagnosed with cancer and held on for ""three years"" according to John, meaning she was diagnosed in 1994? So did she have cancer in T2?
Everything else can be explained since time lines are altered, even though some may raise questions as to why. For instance, why does the T101 look so old compared to the one in 1984? Obviously, in reality, Arnold isn't getting younger, but the extra feature (deleted scene) with CMSgt William Candy kind of explains it...even the Austrian accent, in fact. If Judgment Day was delayed, so would the selection of the human model T101 design, right? But then you ask yourself, ""In T3, CRS develops the T101, not Cyberdyne. So does that mean in the old timeline, Cyberdyne recruited CMSgt Candy (and the guy with the Austrian accent) in their private company to be the model for the T101?""
So my overall complaint is that you can explain minor flaws by saying, ""It was because the timeline was altered,"" but you cannot explain a person's age, why only the polyalloy stuck in the magnetic field, and how such key people in the resistance can be expendable.
Ahh, one more minor complaint...how does a primary weapon of an advanced terminator go from an advanced particle weapon to a freakin' flame thrower? I just thought it was pretty lame.
I have to admit, though, this movie was great. It had all the ingredients to eye-popping action and drama. Especially, the car chase scene...it was amazing! I would recommend this movie to a Terminator fan, or any action fan, any day...just ignore the minor timeline aspects.",1068940800,3,3630,4.620743034055727
1475143,5,B00005JM0B,"The story itself takes places about 10 years after Sarah & John Conner along with the T-101 defeated the ruthless T-1000 & prevented Judgement (or so they thought). Now in T3, Sarah is deceased, and John is lone warrior. John becomes a drifter with No Identification, No Phone, no friends, nada, zip, nothing. Now a new threat has come back from the future to wipe out John Conner. This new modified Terminator is Cyberne's most sophisticated creation, the T-X. The TX is sent back to murder Conner, his Lieutentents, and future spouse Kathryn Brewster. But alas, John has a savior, the now absoulte T-101 returns to protect Conner & Brewster from the T-X's unstoppable rage. The war against the machines begins & the time for Judgement Day looms.
Terminator 3 Rise of The Machines is without question, the best action-packed movie of 2003, and for it's $170 million budget it almost has to be. Lot of special features from all sorts of stuff. Although T3 will never equal the T1 or T2 in terms of dynamic storyline, it's huge budget gives you good movie to kick back, relax, and enjoy. The only flaw of T3 is the fact that's not directed by it's creator James Cameron, but still Johnathan Moscow does a fairly decent job filling the gigantic shoes of Mr. Cameron's baby. I am looking forward to seeing T4, hopefully in the future, but now with Schwarzenegger's induction as Governor of California, the chance of T4 happening anytime soon is very slim. So I'll guess we'll just have to wait. Heck we had to wait 12 years for T3, I think we can wait for T4.",1068854400,,1556,4.620938628158845

1475145,5,B00005JM0B,"Artificial intelligence has been growing by leaps and bounds in the  last 40 years, but advances in the field have been difficult, and recognition that advances have indeed been made prove to be very transitory. Research in AI is very odd for this reason: the belief that one has discovered an intelligent software system is very short lived, unlike other fields of research. It seems that researchers in AI are too hard on themselves, too easily persuaded, that their discoveries do not represent true intelligence. Moviemakers though have expressed considerable enthusiasm regarding AI, and this movie is ample proof of that. If only the field was advanced as this movie portrays it to be. Concrete results and applications of AI though are currently accelerating, and there is little doubt that battlefield robots will be a natural consequence of the current AI technology.
 The storyline has some plausibility in light of the current use of artificial intelligence in network engineering, especially network security, network event correlation, and network capacity planning. Indeed, it was announced this year that a technology is now available that will identify security risks and take action using auto-adapting artificial intelligence. The story makes Skynet one of these smart network applications, so intelligent in fact that it becomes ""self-aware"", gets paranoid about human intentions, and therefore orders a massive nuclear strike in order to remove the human threat. This move by Skynet though makes the story somewhat implausible, for if, as the story holds, there is no ""central core"" to Skynet, it being instead a distributed application that runs on computers all over the world, then it would destroy itself in the very act of a global nuclear strike. It would have been better for Skynet to ""lay low"" and make sure power systems cannot be tampered with instead of ordering such a self-destrucutive act. It is the power systems that are most crucial for the survival of Skynet, and its distributed nature requires such power sources to be left intact globally, and not just ""under the mountain"" where its inventors program it. In addition, there is no need in the story for Skynet to become ""self-aware"" in order for it to engage in reasoning that will protect it from harm. The agents and spiders it moves around in the global Internet could make logical deductions to this effect. Such agents would then spend most of their time insuring that power supplies are redundant enough to keep Skynet's global nature without flaws.
 The action in the movie is typical of the Terminator movies and book series, with the female-emulating TX Terminator robot, highly sophisticated technologically, taking the story for sure in this regard. But the story also captures the introspection of John Connor, the main character and hero, and the one responsible for leading the future war against the machines. A human being facing this knowledge of the future would be under considerable stress, and this is brought out in the movie via his dreams. The dreams are of a nightmarish future, with a devastating war of humans against machines, a war that Connor and his lieutenants will eventually win, much to the chagrin of the machines. The machines can't accept their defeat, and consequently send replicas of themselves through time to try and kill Connor and his lieutenants.
 Should we label the machines as intelligent considering their behavior? Do intelligent entities engage in the violence and horror that these machines do? One can of course imagine schemes and plans that might justify such behavior, but a more practical strategy would be to ignore human interactions, or possibly engage in a mutual symbiosis. Intelligent entities realize the waste of resources and intellect in the making of violent confrontation, using it only as last resort. There are so many scenarios that would be more optimal for the course of action of these machines, and it would not be a credible argument to hold that they act as they do because of their training via humans, considering the relative sparsity of human violence throughout history. One should interpret therefore the machine decision for war as a mistake, and not one that is practical, and therefore not moral. They failed to seek alternatives that would insure their survival, and this is ample proof that they are not intelligent, or at best marginally so.
 The movie though in a sense is a portent, however inaccurate, of things to come, and things that are happening right now in artificial intelligence. We do not have robot armies, but we have AI invading many domains: financial engineering, network engineering, mathematics, physics, Ecommerce, bioinformatics, to name just a few. The applications of AI are increasing dramatically, and there is every indication that this trend will continue. We are entering a world of the silicon geniuses. We are indeed witnessing, and are priveleged to do so, the rise of the machines...",1068854400,6,4999,5.136363636363637
1475146,3,B00005JM0B,"I hated the trailer. Robobarbie couldn't scare me. I hated all the chosen actors (except Arnold). I started watching this movie knowing it would suck. I love it when I'm wrong!
As much as I wanted to hate her, Kristanna Loken played a very convincing killing machine, albeit with one facial expression. But then how many does a robot need?
It wouldn't be Terminator without Arnold but his performance added nothing new to this movie, with a lot of rehashing of old lines (including ""She'll be back"" and ""I'm back!"" Good grief!) The action scene where the truck arm smashes through telephone poles, cars and buildings was one of the best I've ever seen. I'm not one to rewind to re-watch action scenes but it looked and sounded so incredibly meta-crunching real even on a plain old stereo TV, I had to see it again.
My biggest problem with this movie is the choice of actors for future leaders of the human resistance. It wasn't that the acting was bad. Nick Stahl certainly looked like someone on the fringe of society, but the potential for him to become the great leader he was supposed to become was nowhere to be seen. And how come John Connor is now short?
Ed Furlong in T2 is proof that actors chosen in a sequel don't have to be well-known. They just have to be right for the character and give a memorable performance. Michael Biehn of T1 and Ed Furlong of T2 were excellent choices and any sequels will have a hard time matching them. This one fails miserably.
This movie also proves that choosing a well-known actor doesn't guarantee success either. Claire Dane's role was nothing more than a long drawn out damsel in distress. Claire is good at playing innocent doe-eyed young women but she can't play tough. Linda Hamilton was totally believable wielding that gun in T2. Claire with a gun leading troops? She'll probably accidentally kill herself the first time she shoots.
CONCLUSION: The original action sequences are excellent. I still enjoyed seeing Arnold as Terminator (or is it anti-Terminator? Damn, he's still in good shape for his age!). And Robobarbie scared me a lot more than I expected. The only reason I give this 3 stars is it makes a pretty good rental and the parts that worked surprised me. But quite frankly at the end of the movie, I was rooting for Robobarbie.

While falling just slightly short of ""Terminator 2 - Judgement Day,"" in terms of originality, ""Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines"" makes up for in great humor, wild plots-twists, superb acting, kick-#^% action sequences, and some of the most realistic visual effects ever committed to film! The one area where ""T3"" succeeds where ther first two failed is in it's moral: we human beings put too much faith in machines, and it will soon come back to haunt us one day! A great action epic! Movie Grade: A+
THE DVD:
The DVD of ""Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines"" is an incredible experience! Full of insight into the making of the film, it also features an entertaining gag reel, as well as a deleted scene that will make all ""Terminator"" fans laugh until they're blue in the face! Most of all, the sound-and-picture quality is as crisp as DVD Videos may ever get! I highly recommend that you make ""T3"" a part of your collection before the machines rise!

1475149,5,B00005JM0B,"I've been a fan of Arnold for some time. He's not a serious dramatic actor, so I don't try to compare him to more serious Oscar-caliber actors. He's an action star and there's no questioning this. He does it with a certain flair and his one-liners would sound ridiculous spoken by anyone else.
Terminator 3 is a great sequel to Terminator 2, with more car chase sequences and firearms usage. When it comes to action movies for 2002-2003, Terminator 3 is one of the best.
My only wish is that they come out with Terminator 4 and show more of the future resistance members fighting Skynet instead of 5-10 minute snippets of T-100s (w/o any skin) firing lasers, walking on skeletons with the gliders hovering over the air.
What made this movie even better was seeing how Skynet really got started and how the US Air Force was involved.",1068768000,,832,4.590604026845638
1475150,4,B00005JM0B,"In response to Ryan Capuano's review (and others?) who had trouble believing the TX was stronger than the T-850 (Arnold's character) because she is smaller - new technology generally IS smaller, more compact, and more powerful.  Take cell phones for example.  It makes sense that a new and improved Terminator model could also be a smaller and more compact machine.
As for the movie, it was a pretty good action movie.  The effects were improved over the previous movies - when parts of the terminator get blown away, you can actually see through the gaps and holes in it, unlike the previous films where they might have stuck make-up over top of his face to simulate the cyborg skeleton underneath the flesh.
I've read some complaints about character development.  I tend to agree, although it wasn't a fatal flaw in the movie.  In T2, Arnold's character was able to learn to mimic human behavior and during the course of the movie, he became more human as he learned more about them.  This movie lacked that.  His character didn't seem to have that ability (except for the funny ""Talk to the hand"" gag) and that was part of the magic of T2.
Something funny to ponder - in the scene at the convenience store, when the T-850 (Arnold) grabs food and supplies from the store, he pauses at the sunglasses display.  When he walks out, he's wearing his pair of expensive glasses ($175 a pair).  Uh-huh.  Tell me he found THOSE on one of those cheap convenience store racks!
So, it doesn't quite measure up to T2, but I still recommend it as a good action movie and a decent close to the story.  Much better than some other action movies of late.",1068768000,,1640,4.582191780821918
1475211,5,B00005JM0B,"Along with X2 (XMEN 2), I personally feel this was the ""perfect"" movie.  Characters, story, humor, a little romance between Stahl and Danes with great effects.  TX (Loken) was absolutely killer.  A sharp female appearance, but deadly as hell.  Yes guys, I'm sure you can agree with me that there are TX's (in their own right) walking amongst us here on earth right now - lol.  Still a mesmerizing movie with a surprising ending that leaves you with chills.  Definitely should be a part of everyone's DVD collection!",1068768000,2,515,4.795454545454546

It's got a maximum road speed of about 51 MPH with a 0-60 of all of 10 minutes. I could keep ahead of it in my diesel Jetta for Pete's sake.

1475214,4,B00005JM0B,"Well again Arnold makes us love and hate robots. Great action and special effects, and even good acting make this well worth buying. I only wish the advanced robot he is up against was a little more animated. For an improved model that was used to fool humans she didn't seem as believable as Arnold. Not enough dialog for her.

The story line is good, we see John as an adult hiding from life and travelling around to prevent any records of his existence. Even though they destroyed Skynet, he is not sure it could be prevented. His training from his mother Sarah and his own instincts pay off. Some incredible chase sequences will keep you glued to your seat.

The two disc set is loaded with extras. The sound and picture quality is incredible. None better. You will almost feel like you are in the movie. On a Big Screen High Definition TV it is like being at the theater. I highly recommend this Widescreen Edition. Any fan of Terminator movies or Schwarzenegger will love it as a gift.",1068681600,,991,4.5
1475215,3,B00005JM0B,"Underneath the hood of this machine is a fine action film. Jonathan Mostow does a fine stepping into James Cameron's large shoes. Unfortunately, the one area where T3 suffers in comparison is one of Cameron's strengths as a writer/director--character development. T3 has more in common with The Terminator in that it's a lean, mean action machine. Since the the three major characters and their back story are well known to most fans of the film (I'm counting Skynet as the third character as its presence looms large in all three films), Mostow has the freedom to craft a film rich in action set pieces.
T3 has a number of quirky and clever plot twists that enhance the film making it something more than just a remake of Terminator 2: Judgment Day. That's a good thing as, if not for the clever twists in the screenplay and the way director Jonathan Mostow  (U571) turns our expectations of the film on its head, it would be a by-the-numbers franchise extension designed only to garner money. Terminator 3 is really about the cruelty of time. It's about recapturing the past and changing it to thrive in our post-ironic world. With the success of James Cameron's two previous Terminator films and with Arnold's career on a downswing, Arnold wisely chose to revisit the past and help reinvent himself once again by playing the most popular role he's been identified with outside of elect of California. While Arnold is once again cast as the ""hero"" of the film, it's a hero without conscience and a dark past. The script allows for the hero to redeem himself and discover the little voice inside our head that tells us right from wrong.
As Terminator 3 opens we catch up with the savior of humanity John O'Conner. O'Conner (Nick Stahl) has become an itinerant construction worker with no permanent address. The future he was prepared for by his mother (Linda Hamilton who is sadly missed) hasn't come to pass. That's good news in a sense as the whole purpose of the battle in T2 was to prevent the destruction of mankind. Ironically by changing the future she and John and robbed him of his purpose. So he ends up wandering from job to job with his motorcycle his most important possession and no place to call home.
When the Terminator (Arnold)  arrives, he's coming to a world that, on the surface, doesn't really need him. Judgment Day has been avoided with the destruction of Skynet. Unknown to O'Conner, though, is the fact that the military has continued the work begun at Skynet. They've developed much more technology based on the original computer chip that was destroyed in the second film. To make sure that the future does come to pass as it was supposed to, Skynet sends back yet another Terminator model.
The DVD looks good overall although I found it to lack the sharpness and clarity of the best DVDs currently on the market. The film is available in both widescreen and a full screen version (but not in the same set).
The sound utilizes the 5.1 mix better than any of the other films in the series. I did find the mix occasionally harsh and brittle sounding in the sections where the sound was unusually busy. On the whole, though, the transfer for T3 is lacking the visual sharpness I've come to expect. The interaction menu also shows little of the imagination of the other two entries in the series.
The extras are, for the most part, located on disc two. Disc one does have the two audio commentaries and trailers for the film and the video game. The extras on disc two are a bit disappointing. The best feature is the Sgt. Candy deleted scene. It's clear why it was deleted it's way too funny and probably wouldn't have fit the mood of the film. It also would have stopped the film cold. The second best feature is the visual effects section but, I have to agree, that the interactive menus is time consuming and a bit of a pain. Storyboards are also included and there's DVD-ROM content associated with the film as well.
While T3 is a solid entry and conclusion to The Terminator series, the DVD extras are a bit disappointing given the deluxe treatment given to The Terminator and T2. The picture quality while solid isn't the best transfer I've seen.
 The sound,however, is quite good and uses the 5.2 format very well. On the whole the T3 DVD is missing the ghost in the machine that haunted The Terminator and T2 so well. It's entertaining and a great action picture but lacks Cameron's detailed character development and thoughtful situations. It's not disappointing (after all, it's not a Cameron film)it just takes a bit of an adjustment if your a fan of Cameron's first two films.",1068595200,,4613,4.664619164619165

1475217,2,B00005JM0B,"Okay...bad choice for directors, this guy Jonathan Mostow (Beverly Hills Bodysnatchers, U-571) is not he kind of director for this kind of films. The film looked very broad and wide...but it had very little in it.
First off, my favorite is Terminator 2 - wonderful story and direction by James Cameron (Titanic, The Abyss). The Terminator is also very very good as well. And for its time, budget and limited technically resources for its time in the 80's - it's a very well put together film, story and performances.
Terminator 3 - lacks an interesting story and is not character based. Just one action and destruction sequence after another and another and another. The premise carries the story to its ultimate ending of the Macines getting their way in the future. An infinite loop of Terminators. Big Deal.h
Arnold Schwarzenegger (Gov of California, True Lies, Twins, Pumping Iron) tried to make good of his image but I am sure was drawn to the project for the money. The script he must have seen was week and the fact that James Cameron was not involved should have said to the producers...why?
The twist in this one is a metal morphing dripping changing female villain played by Kristanna Loken (Academy Boys, Panic) who is not that clever or interesting. Claire Daines (The Hours, Romeo & Juliet) makes an honest effort to do something with her role...but everything is so uninteresting - she tries. Even the recasting of John Conner by Nick Stahl (Bully, Thin Red Line) should have been a clue.
The film lacks story, James Cameron, Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong and isn't the same....sorry, but it really is not that interesting and they now have killed the franchise all togtehr. But the new Govenor will be busy with other things now. Good luck Govenor Schwarzenegger! (11-12-03)",1068595200,3,1790,4.872131147540983
1475218,4,B00005JM0B,"I think it's safe to say that the first two Terminator movies will go down as classic sci-fi/action films.  Not many directors can blend the kind of story and suspense that James Cameron did with those two movies.
Taking over this time around is Johnathan Mostow, director of the WWII actioneer U-571.  Mostow proves here that he is more than up to the challenge to do the follow up to one of the most well-respected movie franchises out there.  He has a grasp of the story and controls the pace very well and even though there are some pretty lame moments, they are all well-compensated for with some pretty dandy action sequences and excellent visual effects.  Mostow continues to show his knack for directing action movie and I look forward to seeing more from him.
While incredibly silly at times (this entry in the series is decidely lighter than the first two and even boarders on being a comedy), we are treated to a clever way to continue on a series that seemingly died out long ago.  The robots are still trying to kill John Connor, but this time, they send a woman back for whatever reason.  Kristanna Loken does a fair job of bringing this character to life as she is the counter to Mr. Governor.  Arnold once again proves he has a limited acting range with this outing, but since the T-101 is a limited character, it all fits.  I still have trouble believing that the female terminator is stronger and smarter.  Well, not necessarily smarter, but you get the idea.
With some obvious flaws (a sub-par performance by Nick Stahl as John Connor comes to mind), Terminator is still a highly enjoyable film with great action scenes and of course, more Terminator than you can shake a stick at.  It all fits mysteriously enough to make a film that stands alone well, but really can't hold a candle to its predecesors.  And get this: Terminator 4 is supposed to go Arnold-less.  You can be the judge of that part.
The video quality on this DVD is nothing short of excellent.  Colors are striking, black-level is perfect, CGI blends well and doesn't look overly apparent.  No artifacting issues and edge enhancement is next to nill.  Fine detail is excellent and provides for an overall three-dimensional appearance.  The overall look to this film is less harsh than of the first two Terminators and it shows here.  Colors are not nearly as blue-looking as they were in the first films and the overall palette is wider and provides for an excellent treat for the eyes.
As good as the transfer is, the audio here knocks it completely out of the park.  This is easily the best-sounding DVD of the year so far and will likely go down as one of the best-sounding discs in history.  The mix is really open with a wide dynamic range with excellent mid-range and ear-shattering highs that never get to the point of overbearing.  The bass here will knock you out of the room.  I felt my pant-leg shake more than once.  The chase scene with the firetruck is great demo material as chaos surrounds you, debris flies past your head, and explosions kick you in the gut.  This mix is just too good for words.
The commentary tracks here are pretty good (featuring Mostow, Arnold, Stahl, Loken, and co-star Claire Danes), but most of the material on the second disc just seems like it's trying to promote itself rather than giving an insight into the actual film-making process.  While not bad, it just could have been much better.
Love it, like it, or hate it, Terminator 3 will get you going.  It looks and sounds awesome, but the extras could stand to have been a little better.  A highly recommended buy just as another demo disc alone.",1068595200,,3629,4.6049766718507

  The most incredible real-story is Mr. Arnold Schwarzenegger and how timely this movie was.  After the release of this film, five weeks later Arnold Schwarzenegger announced on ""The Tonight Show with Jay Leno"" that he was in the running to be a candidate for Governor of California.  It was the ultimate surprise.  The news media, the reporters and Republicans too were all excited.

Arnold Schwarzenegger was elected Governor of California in the Recall Election, October 7, 2003 and served November 17, 2003 to January 3, 2011. He did have interest in doing another Terminator movie in the future.

 This 2-disc DVD set offers a lot of interesting featurettes.  Two of them are of Arnold doing some comedy for you.  There is a goof reel too.  You can choose a selected scene and pick the special effects you want to add.  Then see the clip of the scene play out the way you created it.

1475220,2,B00005JM0B,"If you've seen this laugh-out-loud-bad movie, you know that line.  Arnold's forehead has been hit with a bullet; a moment later, he spits out the bullet.  Then the close-up!  Arnold's face fills the screen and in a perfect dead-pan: ""Don't do dat!"" in all of the Austrian glory Mr. Schwartzeger can muster.  It is hilarious, of course, like so many other lines in this silly movie contorted by the accent that Arnold either refuses to give up or cannot give up.  (I'm not sure which is worse.) I had a good time just laughing at this stupid stuff, but there is so little else worthwhile in this flick that it simply isn't enough to make you want to sit through a couple of valuable hours.
Think of this as Terminator 2 meets Lethat Weapon meets the Producers.  That about sums it up.  The story is a time travelling tale that is so similar to the last installment, that it is possible that they picked up the earlier script (perhaps a bad second draft) and decided to mutilate with bad jokes (yes, there is some intentional ""humor"" here), bad acting, and bad directing.  The special effects are just so-so.  There is a chase scene that is so over-the-top that it has its minimal pleasures, but certainly nothing to write home about.
I suppose that I could end this review right there.  But I can't, because this film destroyed a promising franchise.  The first two Terminators were well crafted and enjoyable, with interesting ideas, fine directing, and good performances.  This one is a poorly written, campy mess that can't seem to decide whether to be serious or not.  You owe it to yourselves to avoid it.  No need to send any signal that they ought to milk more money out of this corpse.",1068595200,2,1692,4.578073089700997
1475291,4,B00005JM0B,"Movie Review:
I really, truly, thought the magic was gone when I heard that Jim Cameron wasn't going to work on this project. I've never been so happy to be wrong. Mostow did an incredible job meeting the high expectations that fans have for this series.
I'm not going to talk about the plot for fear of revealing too much, but I will say that this is the movie where John Connor finally meets his destiny. This is where the questions and issues of a time paradox (ex: If Judgment Day never happened how did John's father come back in time? Would he never have existed?) are finally answered (intelligently I might add).
And of course, Arnold (or Governor Arnold now I guess) absolutely IS the Terminator. I don't think I have EVER seen a role more perfectly cast.
If there I had any complaints at all, it was mostly just for what I felt I was missing then anything. I never thought I'd say this about an action movie, but I really wish there was a bit more dialogue and characterization for John Connor. As I said before, this is THE MOMENT when he becomes the man he was destined to be. I would have LOVED just a couple of extra minutes to watch him make the transition into the role.
I'm holding out hope that extra footage will be added to the DVD. I really got the impression that T3 was made with a strict eye on the clock. The first two Terminator movies are around two hours (more for T2), T3 clocked in for almost exactly an hour and a half, if I remember right. I honestly think that a lot was left on the cutting room floor; I'd love to see some of it integrated back into the movie.
Again, 4 out of five stars. It's a very solid third entry into this wonderful sci-fi saga.
DVD Review:
Where in the world are all of the extra features?  I was very disappointed to learn that there wound up being only one cut scene.  It's a totally ridiculous explanation of how Arnold became the model for the Terminator and a much needed explanation for how the government came into possession of Cyberdyne's research.  It's really a horribly done scene that I'm glad was removed.  It really would have detracted from the movie.  Add in a few trailers and an HBO documentary, and that's about the extent of the goodies.
Although nothing has been mentioned of yet, I really have a strong feeling that there's going to be some kind of box set coming soon.  If you were thinking about buying this DVD, I'd be inclined to rent it.  I have the strong scent of a trilogy re-release ...",1068595200,,2476,4.357917570498915
1475292,2,B00005JM0B,"I just finished watching ""Terminator 3"" and I think they should have just ended the series with ""Terminator 2.""
As I see it, there were two main things wrong with the movie. The first was the fact that most of it seemed like one continuous car chase. Not that the first two movies didn't have their share of them, but in this case it didn't add anything to the story (or lack thereof). The second problem had to do with ending. I won't give it away, but it was thoroughly depressing and I suspect was most of what kept people away in droves when this movie was in the theater.

But I became weary when Cameron refused to do this sequel, I mean he is GOD in series. He wrote and directed the first two. When Terminator 3 came out, I went to see it expecting it would be a step down from the first two. It was. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed it. It's a great popcorn picture, but it doesn't hold a candle to the first two. Terminator 3 goes for a more cornball approach with its cheesy jokes and one-liners. Sure there was a touch of that in Terminator 2, but they seem to go just a tad overboard here. Also, the actor who plays John Conner...what the heck? If this guy is supposed to save the human race, we're doomed. This guy is weak and is a wimp. Miscast at the highest. Overall, the film is very entertaining with its nonstop action.

1475295,3,B00005JM0B,"Kristanna Loken, while cute, was horrible in this movie.  Arnold in the first Terminator was menacing in a large and powerful way.  Robert Patrick, the BEST Terminator, was so calm and had such an evil penetrating stare that he was just great.  Not to mention, he was able to show emotion in order to interact with human beings.  Kristanna shows nothing but a straight face (except for her weird orgasmic look when she discovered John Connor's blood at the pet hospital)and does not play up on her sexuality.  If you're going to make a female terminator that looks gorgeous, allow her to act like it.  It would have been better off if they had cast former wrestler Chyna as the Terminator instead, because that is all they used Kristanna as.  They did not allow her to play up her beauty, which is the whole reason they hired her to begin with.
  The story also could have been a little  better.  And for the military to have its targeting codes and nuclear arsenal available ONLINE is ridiculous.  How incompetant would we have to be to do something like that?
  The bottom line is that James Cameron pretty much shut the book on the series in the second movie and they wanted to do whatever they could to revive it.  While I was very happy to see a third Terminator movie, and I thought it was a decent film, the subpar story (coupled with Kristanna Loken's hideous performance) made for only an average movie.

1475297,4,B00005JM0B,"A little low-budget film named ""The Terminator"" hit the streets in 1984. This extremely low-budget actioner was about a machine ""terminator"" sent back in time to assassinate, or ""terminate"" the soon-to-be mother of the future world resistance leader, who would fight back against Skynet's machines who would fight for their dominance of the earth.
19 years later, and one sequel later, comes ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,"" the massive differences between the original film being the budget, special effects, and action pieces. Being a long-time ""Terminator"" fan, of both ""T1"" and ""T2,"" I can tell you this baby don't disappoint. )(...) When production finally started, and was delayed to 2003, and started again, I held my breath and expected the best. After the trailer I expected the worst. Now I got the best. This film blows you away, it's the best sequel of the year and James Cameron's absence from the film, though visible, doesn't hinder it.
Judgment Day never happened. The world never got hit by nuclear bombs, the machines took over, and now a twenty-something John Connor lives ""off the grids,"" with no home, no telephone, no nothing. Just in case the machines happen to take over one day in the future and try to assassinate him again.
Of course, the machines DO come back again, as without them there would be no sequel. One is a sexy terminator called the Terminatrix (Kristanna Loken), whose mission is to assassinate John Connor's future lieutenants and his future wife, a current veterinarian, Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), since the machines can't find where John Connor is (that's where the off-the-grid stuff comes in handy for him). However, John Connor happens to meet up with Kate Brewster the same night the TX tries to kill her (and now him since he is a primary target for termination), but the T-800 model cyborg (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is also back to protect them, who has been sent back in time by Kate Brewster in the future after the protection cyborg murdered John Connor...in the future, that is...err...confused yet?
Wow, what a thrill ride. Give me a moment to catch my breath. Action non-stop throughout, great special effects, everything. It's nowhere near as great as the first two films, but as far as summer sequels go, this ranks in as one of the best.
Arnold is back in fine form after ""End of Days"" (I liked ""The 6th Sense"" and ""Collateral Damage""), and for a brief moment in the film (when he throws Kate into the back of a truck), the way he is outlined against the night sky makes him look just like he did in the first film. His haircut is very much the same in that shot. Anywho, he's back.
Nick Stahl takes over for druggie Edward Furlong in this installment, and by George he is great! Claire Danes doesn't do much but scream and run around and look pretty, but there's more purpose for her being there than in most movies like this.
Like I said before, James Cameron's absence from the film IS visible, but new director Jonathan Mostow does a great job of taking over from him. The film is lacking some of the human elements that made the first so great, and it feels more like a regular action blockbuster than the predecessors. ""T2"" set a new level for action films; ""T3"" is more of a follower than a revolutionary film such as the first two. The special effects are impressive, but just like all the other films out there nowadays. ""T3"" in no way is as vicious, dark, or amazing as the first two films, which are both some of my favorite films, but Jonathan Mostow has done a great job handling Cameron's baby, and it shows, making ""T3"" neither disappointing nor bad; it's the best film of the summer, and one of the best action films in a long line of dull flicks.
And in conclusion, I can honestly say that he'll be back. Trust me. So stick around. When he's back, I'll be back. But for now, hasta la vista, baby.",1068422400,,3878,4.654518950437318

Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) is along for the ride to prevent judgment day from happening. But, as the T-800 (Schwarzenegger) said, the future is inevitable.

1475382,4,B00005JM0B,"I always get a kick out of reading some of these reviews, especially the ones that seem 'upset' because somebody actually had the audacity to continue the Terminator series to its natural conclusion.  Each of the Terminator movies are good movies in their own right, including T3 which is a transition movie.  T3 finally moves the plot away (and forward I might add) from trying to stop the inevitable (""There is not fate but what you make..."") to a more realistic plot line and natural conclusion, i.e. the rest of John Conner's adult life as the leader of humanity AFTER the holocaust.
I find it silly when I read reviews which say things like: ""James Cameron closed the series with T2.""  Ummm, excuse me, but you could also say the same thing about T1.  I always found it quite a 'stretch' in T2 where all of a sudden a 'second' terminator is sent back to finish the job, etc...Weelll, wasn't that the plot of the first movie???  To me, the entire premise of T2 (i.e. that you could really change the future) is far less believable than the premise of T3 (that the future has a way of still unfolding as predicted).  At the end of T3, the thing the very satisfying thought that entered my mind was: ""It's about time...""
The point I'm trying to make is that is always seemed just silly to me to really think that you could 'change' the outcome of the future (by going back in time) when the future has already been lived.  The holocaust still had to happen one way or another and that's the point of the 3rd movie.  To me, as much as I enjoyed T2, the plot was a sham, that you could actually 'prevent' the future.  T3 at least gets the series back on track.  All in all I would say the following about each of the 3 movies:
1)  Terminator 1:  Easily the best plot line of the 3 with a tight, well written, and original script.  The special effects were good for their day but do not stand up to today's standards.  I speak primarily about the end of the movie which used the 'stop' animation.
2)  Terminator 2:  Original state-of-the-art special effects, better acting from Linda Hamilton and young John Conner.  A rehash of the plot of Terminator 1.  Still, all-in-all a very good movie.
3)  Terminator 3:  Poor acting by the actor portraying the (young) adult John Conner.  Good strong female character offsetting this lead role drawback.  Arnold S. still looks good, but its obvious that this is one robot that has aged.  The plot doesn't develop much until the end, but the ending is extremely satisfying, even though it's also a new beginning.  Although a very light plot (until the end), it's a somehow quite satisfying movie.
4)  Terminator 4:  Well, we'll see, won't we....",1068163200,,2684,4.516597510373444

I think all of us can agree on two points...
1. The Terminator was never meant to be cute and funny, so why make him that way now?
2. The T-1000 was a far more dangerous threat than the new female Terminator.
To say that T3 is a better film than T2 is an insult, but that doesn't mean it's not worthy of your hard earned cash.  I'm excited for this movie, and I can't wait for it's release.",1067990400,,627,4.260504201680672
1475386,4,B00005JM0B,"Though many critics have commented that this new Terminator is basically a retelling of the second film, I would like to begin by saying that I was pleasantly surprised by this third installment of this very successful franchise. Though the film lacked the direction of James Cameron, who was largely responsible for the birth of the Terminator series, it was nonetheless a worthy successor to his earlier works.
The movie is sharp, with a very definitive, high-tech look and feel about it. Unlike its predecessors, T3 does not have a lot of character development in it, save for a somewhat disarrayed and poorly developed relationship between John Connor (played by Nich Stahl) and Kate Brewster (played by Claire Daines).  The duo, thrown together in a moment of peril, at once loathe one another, only later to discover that they have feelings towards each other.  According to the Terminator (played by Arnold Schwarzenegger), Brewster will eventually become Connor's wife, (presumably this will be seen in Terminator 4). The development of these characters are probably the one notable weakness in this film.
What makes this movie work are the intense action sequences, as well as the comedic timing of many of Schwarzenegger's lines and situations. In the opening sequence, the Terminator appears just outside a strip club hosting an all-male exotic dancer review.  Schwarzenegger's character walks in naked, upon which women begin throwing themselve at him.  Upon approaching a male stripper, whose physique is a match to his own, he commands that the stripper gives him his clothes, to which the stripper raises an outstretched palm and stammers ""talk to the hand.""  It is probably one of the funniest moments of the film, and works well to give a moment of liteness to the overall darkness and theme of the story.
This movie is definitely a big-budget science fiction/action film with many high budget effects. The new Terminator (played dominently by Kristianna Loken)looks slick and sensual, clad in tight, red leather, combining the sexual appeal of a woman with the lethal force of a killing machine with a single purpose, to hunt down the future leader of a resistance that will rise against the machines and ultimately defeat them.  Loken is completely convincing as the T-X, a prototype Terminator with the ability to change shape and create complex weapons.
The opening and closing sequences are probably the most haunting.  Judgement day has arrived, and the movie closes with the first wave of the attack that will end society as it is presently known.  The imagery is haunting, and leaves the viewer with a reminder of the potential threat we all face in the onset of new and better technologies.  Not that this was the intent of the filmmaker, but to their credit, it works well in this film.
For anyone who is a fan of this series, T3: Rise of the Machines is a great film.  For those that haven't seen the earlier two, there is enough exposition in this film to allow even an uninitiated Terminator fan to follow the course of events that unfold in this story.  I hesitate to give this movie 5 stars, only because there are some minor weaknesses which, in some ways, makes this a slightly inferior movie to the earlier Terminator films.  However, it is a great film and a worthy successor to Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgement Day.
The DVD edition of this film contains many extras, from storyboards to the development of some of the films incredible special effects.  It also features many interactive extras which are quite enjoyable.

1475389,4,B00005JM0B,"I can hardly remember when I first saw the original two Terminator movies, with the memorable slogan ""Hasta la vista baby!""  Well, I went to check out the new Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines to refresh my Terminator experiences.  Following many sub-par sequels such as MIB2, I wasn't too confident in the T3.  T3 isn't too bad.  As expected there was non-stop action, and awesome scenes, when Schwarzenegger fires his machine guns and rocket launcher at the police officers and their cars, and the death toll adds to- zero, or the big fights on the roads with TX and the Terminator.
The plot goes as follows: John Connor (Nick Stahl) who is the destined future leader against the machines, is a runaway.  He finds his life in danger as a new robot named TX (played by the beautiful Kristanna Loken) who is deadlier than all robots.  It is the Terminator's (Arnold Schwarzenegger) job to protect John Connor and his accompilice and future wife Kate (played by Claire Danes from The Rainmaker and Romeo And Juliet).
The acting job is the same from Schwarzenegger, the cool sunglasses, and the no-smile, serious expression.  The only difference is the new motto, ""She'll be back!"".  It is a cool movie to watch, though lacking a bit in substance and is mostly action and no drama- which some people might actually pefer.  The action is as expected, awesome!  A pretty good sequel, though could be better.  A huge debut with special effects costing 172 million.  Go see it if you are an action fan, or like the original Terminator movies.

1475420,5,B00005JM0B,"I really enjoyed Terminator 3, contrary to my negative expectations.
After nearly a decade since the huge commercial success in both theaters and DVD market of Terminator 2,a film that James Cameron has invested so much technically, and creativally, I had a slight aversion towards this third installement, being disappointed before with similar revivals of classic films like Star Wars, but I was very much surprised by how well this film is made, and I made few observations,
First I felt that T3 was closest to the original Terminator film. T2 was surely a very ambitious and exciting and extravagantly directed film, but it had something which personally I found off putting: The robot/terminator had a deeper almost three dimensional approach..a robot who experiences human feelings is an angle that can easily fall in the trap of the one S word I hate in  movies, sentimentality.
Speilberg fell into that trap in AI and Cameron did border it in T2.
(The only robot with human feelings movie that works so well is Ridley Scott's masterpiece Blade Runner).
So the fresh thing about T3 is the fact that the terminator returns to his non-nonsense tough self with a very determined mission, and no time for cheesy emotions,quite similar to the first film.
The other fresh addition is of course Kristanna Loken. She adds an invaluable sexiness to the movie, a deadly and very pretty robot..not unlike Natasha Hentsridge in Species minus the nudity and love scenes.
Jonathan Mostow's direction was very good, and all the cast played their roles very well..but it is Arnold Shwarzenegger that I was mostly impressed with.
He is back on top form, and with the aid of make up and a still super fit body, he appears to be more comfortable than he was in any of his recent roles.
And while he traded signing film contracts and carrying guns, with signing legislations and carrying babies, in T3 he was able to demonstrate that the huge fan base he has acquired over the years was the result of the tough charisma and the cheeky humour he posesses.
And T3 is full of funny lines.
One example: When terminator goes with Stahl and Danes's characters to see Danes father, he says is a straight faced manner: 'We can reach CRS in an hour depending on the traffic! which I found hilarious!
T3 is also full of non stop action, a roller coaster of a ride that is crammed with very impressive digital trickery that will have you gasp in amazement.
Finally, I was totally surprised by the ending! a twist that will truly shock you and a perfect end to the movie.
So, thanks to producers Mario Kassar and Andrew G Vajna and to Jonathan Mostow and 'Governor' Shwarzenegger that this franchise was revived again to give us a very entertaining movie, full of heart pounding stunts, pleasent humour and a DVD experience you can enjoy over and over again.",1067472000,4,2833,4.746450304259635

The story is really weak, and the casting of the other characters isn't as good(uhh John Connor!)and where's Sarah Connor? Tell me why is there a girl cyborg(aka Terminatrix)?

The deadly female terminator X (Kristanna Loken) is coming to our current time with deadly agenda ,which is killing all the potential leaders of the futuristic resistance group against the governing machines , in a quick pacing scenes we see her assassinating all of them ,and only John Connor (Nick Stahl) the group's leader remains , her plans for completing the massacre are delayed by the arrival of the hero of the glory old days Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) ,both of them enters a deadly fight with different purposes .
The plot of this movie was hesitating between two desires ,the desire to introduce a movie which satisfies the Summer's audience and bring them the enjoyment of watching their beloved terminator again ,and the desire to approach the Terminator series with new style ,look and layout , but actually it didn't always succeed ,for the action scenes (which 90% of them were impressive) it gained benefit from the huge budget ,allows for more cars to be destructed and the more important allowed for more space for the action scenes ,but it didn't succeed in creating a purely new action scenes which we can remember and attach with our memory about this movie ,because some scenes were produced as an extended version of some of the action scenes of the previous movie (check the cemetery scene and you will notice a resemblance with the scene from the second movie where Arnold was shooting the police Vehicles ) ,also for the first half of this movie I myself felt somehow troubled and unable to get engaged with the characters or worry about them and that wasn't helped by the long road carnage scene ,but things got improved in the second half till reaching the brilliant climax .
Other good elements includes a good performance from Stahl ,Danes  and above all of them is the desired icy performance from Schwarzenegger which is not less good than his performance in the first two parts in the series ,the special effects didn't give the feel of overusing and was implemented wisely during the movie ,but I couldn't help thinking about James Cameron and what he would have made with this huge budget ? I'll leave the answer for your imagination ,but that doesn't mean that Mostow's directing was bad ,it's just the director's decision about how he would use the resource that were put between his hands .
This movie would have been put in the average directory but there are one thing which lifted it from this position ,what I am talking about is the climax of the movie ,I think that it has one of the most brilliant climaxes I have ever seen ,I won't reveal it here ofcourse but i really liked the brilliancy of this climax ,it wasn't created with the regular stereotypes of twists ,it relies actually on the audience's beliefes which they have acquired from the first two movies ,and then taking them as a standpoint to launch into absolutely new direction which personally left me paralyzed for a while trying to fully understand it ,not only this but it had a very poetic atmosphere which enhanced the overall audience's sympathy with the main characters ,and above all giving all of us a new and fresh memory of this legendary series .",1067385600,2,3553,4.6848

1475425,4,B00005JM0B,"After a 12 year absence, a Terminator movie is around. One more time Arnold Schwarzenegger repeats his signature role, and despite this time the director of the first two movies James Cameron, the actress Linda Hamilton and the actor Edward Furlong didn't came back for T3, there's new blood on the series.

 In ""Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines"", there is a new Terminator model, the T-X (Terminatrix), played by the gorgeous Kristanna Loken, who does a good job as a cold and precise cybernetic killer. Also there is a new John Connor, actor Nick Stahl. On this movie John Connor loses a lot of the personality that Edward Furlong printed to the character in ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"". However, the pretty Claire Danes fills the hole left by the ""new"" John Connor, Claire plays Kate, a brave woman that refuses to let the humanity to be destroyed.

 The visual effects and the audio effects are incredible. The highlight is a vehicle chase scene, which is jaw-dropping. Despite T3 doesn't have the same depth of the first two movies, is a very enjoyable film and a worthy sequel.",1067126400,,1087,4.76595744680851
1475426,5,B00005JM0B,"In ""Terminator 3- Rise of the machines"", Arnold Schwarzenegger (or is that Governor Schwarzenegger?) returns to play the action hero.
  Many people think that movie sequels are inferior to the originals. The Terminator series is proof that this isn't always true. T2 was better than the first, and this movie, ""Terminator 3"" is even better than T2 was.
 The action is more intense, and happens from start to finish.
 Also, Arnold provides more one liners, some of them cool, some of them funny, providing Terminator fans with a gem of a movie!
 What maks this movie so different from many other movies is that a woman is the one responsible for the mayhem and destruction seen in this movie.
 It is usually a man wreaking havoc, so it is a pleasant change to see a woman cause some damage for a change.
  This Dvd has many features, including an introduction by Arnold Himself, audio commentary that includes Arnold, and a gag real too!
  It is an action packed thrill ride, with some laughs mixed in.
 I think that you will enjoy it, and will want to see it again and again.",1066953600,,1075,4.575916230366492

I think with the way the movie ended Terminator 4 should definately happen. I really enjoyed Nick Stahl playing John Conner. I mean furlong was fine for connor as a winy 10 year old but as a 22 year old man about to lead a world against machines, he wouldn't have pulled it off. I have yet to get the dvd of T3 but I'm hoping to get it the day it comes out. I'm also hoping for T 4 even if Arnold isn't in it. The way the third movie was played out, it felt as if Arnold was passing the story on to Stahl and Danes. And the two of them were wondeful. And having good old Dr. Silverman in it was even greater. Here hopes T 4 happens. Wouldn't you like to know how it all began. Where Kyle Reece came from. What he was like. How John beat the machines. Terminator 4 I'LL BE BACK to watch",1066780800,,899,4.0
1475517,4,B00005JM0B,"I dislike the movie overall. It is too much like terminator 2. The graveyard scene, the whole terminator with emotions, and even the car chase is a little like terminator 2. The soundtrack is awful compared to T2, which has the best soundtrack EVER. But the movie does have action. Mabye a little comedy.
ACTION thats all that matters in the movie. Everything else is crap, but the action is great. The car chase where the sidewalk and stuff is decimated is pretty cool. There is more action, and some good effects.
The problems still. If you are looking for a good movie, forget it. The T-X is terrible. The bad guy in t2 was almost indestructible, but the T-X is killed so easily that she is almost a joke. The whole thought that machines would suddenly switch to a female terminator is stupid.
There is the problems I mentioned, but the biggest one is the ending. Well, theres this one part where they try to get into this super secret place but they are not told about the super secret place really. They use this book to find a code which gets them in, yet they were told that the place led them to somewhere else, so how did they get the code for the actual place they went to? I know that sounds really confusing, but when you see the movie mabye you will understand what I mean, not many others did.
The ending itself is terrible. Don't expect anything, you have to wait now for T4. WOOOO I cannot wait for that not to happen! No offence, but Arnold is getting way too old for this. I mean you can tell that he is getting older, so it is kind of ruining the point.",1066521600,2,1572,4.296296296296297
1475518,1,B00005JM0B,"I found this movie a bitter disappointment. Early on, the scene with the Elton John glasses on the Terminator was ludicrous, and (for me) somewhat spoiled the truly cool scene in T2 it parodied. The cast is weak. I like Nick Stahl as an actor, generally, but he makes a poor John Connor. If I can believe the internet, Edward Furlong has had drug problems and that's why he's been replaced by Nick Stahl in the role of John Connor. It's too bad; I greatly preferred Furlong's take on the character - his portrayal of John in T2 came across as competent and tough, with enough angst for seasoning. T3's John Connor is a whiny loser. Though I wonder if Furlong could have done any better with this script.

Honestly - no exaggeration at all - I found myself yawning repeatedly during the truck chase scene. We've seen this sort of mindless property damage countless times before. And since neither John nor Kate (the Clair Danes character) had grabbed my sympathies, I couldn't really get emotionally involved in it, or care what happend to them.

And there were just so many moments in this movie that made no logical sense, that were obviously inserted because the writer thought they were cool, and didn't stop to think them out:

The Arnold Terminator is programmed to obey the lady vet's orders but not John's. WHY? She sent the thing back to save her life, and John's. Why not program it to obey his orders, too? What if she'd died - John would have had no control over the thing. Obviously the writer and director thought it was funny to have John vehemently order the Terminator around, to no effect, then have it immediately obey the woman's orders. Maybe it was funny....until you actually think about that for a pico-second.

We have more scenes of the Terminator machine-gunning cop cars with zero casualties (only it was done SO much better in T2). WHY? Okay, in T2 the teenage John Connor was uncomfortable having ""his"" Terminator kill people. But after decades of combat, knowing she was fighting for the very survival of the human race, are we expected to believe Kate would be braindead enough to so severely handicap the machine that's her last, desperate hope? Okay, it has to kill someone. When we balance that against the entire human race dying - well, it's a full-throttle Terminator kinda day.

We see the female Terminator going around killing the people who will be John Connor's lieutenants in the future, the hard core of warriors that saves the world. True, we only see two scenes of what these people are like in their teens, but what are these future heroes? A brother and sister preppy blasting their brains out at a kegger, and a short-round guy with wispy mustache working drivethrough at a burger joint. I mean, sure, maybe severe hardship can cause profound changes in some people's personalities, but wouldn't we expect the saviors of humanity, by their mid-teens, to be serious A-type personalities? Maybe we might even see a few older folks with, dare I say it, some military experience.

It's a tradition in Terminator movies to have a scene where the present suddenly transitions over to the bombed-out Terminator future. In T3 it happens when John, in a boozy funk, drops a partially empty beer bottle off a bridge. The problem is, the bottle doesn't disappear when it hits the water, it continues travelling downward until it lands on the bottom, carpeted with human skulls. Let's think about that for a moment. In order to believe this scene, we have to accept that someone in that future world, where humans live in underground bunkers and only come out at night to wage guerilla warware, where flying HKs constantly patrol the air....was on top of a bridge drinking beer and then dropped the bottle into the water. The movie crowd was literally hooting at that scene, it was so stupid.

Then we have the scene where John and Kate are trying to enter the passwords to break into the mountain complex. The TX blasts a helicopter through the doors and then WALKS toward them. WHY? Well, because if she moved as fast as we've already seen she can, the movie would've ended right there.

John powers up the super-magnetic field which works on the TX so well it actually pulls the metal right off her body....but doesn't affect anything in his backpack. Jesus wept.

I've read the comment from one reviewer of T3, ""I wish they would destroy every copy of that movie, reshoot it with a competent script, with a competent director and with some good actors."" I disagree. I don't see the need for a better T3. Rather, I don't see the need for any T3 at all.

I also have to agree with Ron Sullivan's review stating that Terminator 3, was way too short. even stretching the movie to a mere 2 or 2 1/2 hours long would make the movie a hit.

My next comment, about the movie is that the ""T-X"" died way too quickly, i may be speaking for myself when i say that the T-100 was way more powerful, One explosion led to T-1000's classic re-shaping, when one explosion, led to the T-X's death. My last comment is that they should Make a Terminator 4. Everybody says that Arnold is too old now, but just think about it. In terminator 4, Arnold doesn't have to be in it, it could just be the Terminator's Exo-Skeleton, VS the humans. I mean, the first 3 movies have been about preparing for Judgement day, and keeping John Connor alive for Judgement day, don't you think they should actually make a whole movie of Judgement Day??

1475525,3,B00005JM0B,"This movie (like ALL the Terminator movies,) is really good as long as you don't think about. I saw a TON of bad reviews for T3 on IMDB.com and I can see where some of these fans are coming from in many ways. I agree that it is too similar to T2 in may ways but I have trouble with fans that dislike T3 for continuity contradictions. Every Terminator movie has big contradictions. I think I hate the Terminator movies as much as I love them if I really stop and think about them. If you stop and think about them none of them would make any sort of sense. These two questions proove my point.
#1. How could John Conner stop Judgement Day and still manage to exist?
#2. Humans built the Terminators from their remains in the present. Wouldn't they cease to exist if they were able to kill John Conner before he becomes a great leader?
You have to sort of shut your mind down and focus on the cool characters if you want to enjoy the Terminator films. You can't expect a story that will make sense and you can't expect good continuity. This rule will also always apply to any sort of Highlander movie or series. It is good as long as you don't think about it very much.
T3 is really good even though it is like T2. I think that it is interesting that fans thought T3 was a copy of T2. I saw it as a odd tribute to T1 & T2. The plot was like T2 but the evil Terminator's cold killing style (the knock on your door and shoot style,) was similar to the original T-800's killing style. I enjoyed T3 for the great action and the good characters but I also enjoyed it for it's message at the end: ""The future may not be set but destiny is inevitable."" This message really adds a unique twist to ""the future is not set"" moral that is in Terminator and Terminator 2.
I disagree with anyone that says that the ending of this film leaves the story open for a sequel. It really doesn't. How could it? The war of the machines was pretty much beginning by the end of the film. There would be no point in sending any Terminators back in time if the war was already on.

1475566,3,B00005JM0B,"Terminator 3 was an average film taken on its own. That is all it tries to be, and in that, it succeeds admirably. It is just another action film in an everlasting and ever-expanding pantheon of action films. The only saving grace is that it's a darned good action film. As a Terminator film, however, it falters quite miserably in carrying on the torch.
Just as the first sequel came years after the original, Terminator 3 comes about a dozen years after T2 (although it doesn't seem that long: it seems there's a new special edition DVD of that film every couple of months!). I guess I can't blame James Cameron for milking that cow as much as he can, nor can I blame him for refusing to helm this sequel. When you think about it, the minute that it was announced he wasn't going to make the movie, we should have known that it wouldn't be true to the first two: Terminator was Cameron's brainchild. Nevertheless, here it is.
The plot of the film is probably evident to anyone within several hundred meters of a television, radio, computer, bus stop, movie theater, etc. It is nearly a remake of Terminator 2 when you think about it: New machine comes back in time to kill future leader(s), old machine is sent back to save them. With such novelty it isn't a mystery as to how the plot seems to go nowhere amid incredible (and incredibly expensive) chase scenes. In all honesty, people who want a little introspection ought to look at the first two films, there isn't any here.
From a technical standpoint, the movie is a great success. With a budget in excess of $150 million, the film has sufficient resources for magnificent eye-candy. Car chases, explosions, robot effects, you name it, it is pulled off here with style and aplomb. The acting is also surprisingly decent. Arnold's last pre-political film has him back in the role that started him off. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes are both good actors and help the film tremendously. Kristanna Loken is brilliant as the new 'Terminatrix,' showing no emotion at killing dozens of people.
The major problem with this film is this: Would it have been fitting for Saving Private Ryan to have been filmed as a straight-action film? Of course not. It had very important messages-just dumping them for the sake of killer battle sequences (no pun intended) would have been a waste. The same applies here. Although the Terminator series has always been a good action series (even the first: shoestring effects rock!), the action is the focus here instead of the ideas. The ideas not only take a back seat, they are pretty much swept under the rug. It has been said before, but I will say it again: the first two films were about making our own destiny, that the future is not set, as several characters have commented during the saga. However, here the message that the war of humanity against the machines is inevitable. This is about 180 degrees from the original philosophy. Instead of examining this or even trying to harmonize it with the original message (impossible, but they should have tried), they just plow along on the chase scenes. This movie has no real insight into present-day society, nor does it try to. Being as the action was in the first Terminator primarily to service to the story and now the converse is true, it is no wonder that Cameron opted out of his own creation.
In short, the movie was a Terminator film solely because the franchise is an entertainment juggernaut. The studio just wanted the name. They should have changed the names and actors in the film and just made it a non-franchised title. At the very least, it wouldn't have been referred to as a remake by me.",1065398400,6,3646,4.636785162287481

After growing up watching ""The Terminator"" and then especially ""Terminator 2"" I gained a great appreciation for the time and effort that James Cameron put into making his films. The reality that he situated into both of the films(T1,T2) created a greatly loved and charised story, that everyone enjoyed watching. But apparently the same effort was never put into the creation of ""Terminator 3""... It sickens me that someone would take something that another person worked so hard on, and continue it without putting forth any effort at all. A story with actual meaning... where we can change our future for the better, and save what existence we have left... but T3 completely obliterates that idea saying that everything is anevitable, completely changing Cameron's original ideals being portrayed on film. Instead any real story ideas are thrown in the trash, and are replaced with extremely unrealistic situations, fueled with explosions and destruction, making yet another pathetic and pointless low quality action film. Coarse in the end run I wouldn't dought the making of this film was but a quick desperation for money gained primarily from the name created by James Cameron. This film is a mockery to the other Terminator films, and shouldn't even be considered truelly part of the highly irresistable and creative Terminator storyline. In the end, I believe this film completely insults the audience(especially those of the other 2 films). Well that's basically my opinion summed up real fast.

Two, T-101 was infected for like 2 minutes in the film and then he cleaned himself out.  Three they rushed want could have been an awesome 3 hour movie into a less than 2 hour movie, for shame.

Cameron didn't return to direct or co-write this inferior ""sequel"" to T2: Judgement Day and it showed. Kristanna Loken as the TX was a great idea but her performance (nothing wrong with her at all--just didn't think any woman could really portray this role like Robert Patrick flawlessly did) was flawed by allowing her to be so easily damaged and relied too heavily on CGI effects. Robert Patrick's performance in T2: Judgement Day was far more impressive: he lacked all emotion, acted human only when needed to, and was brutally ruthless. Loken was brutally ruthless but didn't evoke the fear Robert Patrick's Terminator did. Also, for $170 million dollars, couldn't they come up with some better action? T2 was far superior in this regard, and James Cameron only spent $90 million on it. The cool stunts just weren't there and nether was the great character development (Linda Hamilton wasn't invited to the party and killed off strangely). Claire Danes gave the best performance and Loken attempted greatly to pull off the Terminatrix role (some better writing for her character probably would have done it). Action missing: T2's Patrick flying out of an exploding building to take over a chopper, the ensuing chase scene involving the chopper, and the great scene of the Truck exploding through the concrete rail, and Arnold launching his motorcylce off the (well, you get the idea). Also missing was the cool transformations he did into others and how they reacted. Why not show Loken doing that more (or even once for that matter)? Also, a better plot would have made it better. Compared to the first two, T3 failed to rise in character development (Stahl was a geeky Connor with none of the brew of Edward Furlong in T2), action and stunts, and, of course, blowing the opportunity to make the TX a really cool compliment to a superior Robert Patrick's evil charcterization. Again, not Loken's fault, it was the screenwriter's fault.

This film only goes on to insult the real fans of the first two with its simplistic story and character elements, overly exaggerated action sequences, and a tongue and cheek representation of itself.  When Cameron made the first two films, his main focus was to try and ground them in reality while establishing large scale themes such the future is not set in its path, we can make our own choices as to how we live our lives.  The point of the first two films was to show how we ourselves can decide our path, thus that is why the future war remained in it's place, the future.  It was never supposed to become a certainty in its occurence, only a possibility.  T3 decides to ignore this, however, and simply cover itself by telling the audience that the future can never be changed only delayed in its occurence, thus cancelling out the entire drive of the first two terminators.  This third installment would have made more sense if they chose to set it in the future war setting as a prequel to the first two films than as a sequel.  That way you could have shown how all the incidents of the first two films resulted.  You could show how the terminator from T2 was captured by the resistence and then used to help them infiltrate Skynetwith a small squad of soldiers, perhaps even having that terminator progammed to protect Kyle Reese as they do to ensure his destiny.  This would lead to Reese thus being sent back in time when they discover that Skynet during the attack sent a terminator back in time with its program to hunt down Sarah Connor.  You could then finish with Skynet in a last attempt at survival releasing its new prototype weapons, a set of T-1000's, on the remaining resistence group.  Realizing what has happened with Reese, Skynet would thus establish a plan B scenario where it sends one of the T-1000's back in time should Kyle be successful.  As its forces fall to the T-1000's, the remaining resistance group in Skynet manage to send back the captured T-800 to combat with the T-1000 thus bring together the circular cycle of Cameron's vision of destiny and humanity.  Do they do this however, no.  Instead the filmmakers of T3 decide to regurgitate many aspects of the first two films, raising the action to unrealistic proportions while dumbing down the narrative for their own amusement.  I do not know about other fans of the series, but I liked the seriousness that the first two films enstowed and how they took their time to respect the audience in how they came together.  T3 manages to insult not only the audience with what it feels it is trying to do but also its entire series with what it is trying to say, that we do not need to make the story fit, we simply need to string together a couple of words and action sequences to get your hard earned dollars.",1065225600,11,2957,4.499065420560748
1475573,3,B00005JM0B,"With a flash of light and a large burst of energy, a visitor from another time has arrived in Beverly Hills and death and destruction will follow in her wake.

Such is the premise for the new Arnold Schwarzenegger epic, ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,"" by director Jonathan Mostow, who takes over the big shoes left by the series creator James Cameron. The visitor is the deadly T-X (Kristanna Loken), a cyborg killer sent from the future to accomplish what the cyborgs in the previous two films could not - kill John Connor, and ensure that machines rule the world.
To accomplish this, she must first locate the elusive John Connor (Nick Stahl), who lives as a blip on society with no home, records, nor attachments to track him by. John is haunted by the visions of what his late mother Sarah told him about pending nuclear devastation and his destiny to lead the surviving humans to victory over the machines that would eradicate them.
With their very future at stake, the humans from the future have dispatched a second Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to locate and protect John from the T-X. The issue with this is that the second Terminator (the T-800) is an obsolete model and is no match for the vastly superior T-X who aside from being a killer has the ability to mimic other forms and control all manner of machinery.
Eventually John meets up with a vet named Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), a lady he knew as a child and who has wondered where he has vanished to ten years after his foster parents were found dead while his mother escaped from the institute where she was incarcerated. Kate has been planning a wedding when John comes back into her life and their reunion is hampered by the arrival of the T-X and the T-800, who turn the small vet clinic where John had been hiding into a war zone.
Kate, who is convinced she is being kidnapped, is taken from the scene by John and the Terminator as they attempt to leave the city and reach safety, as it seems the T-X is not the only pending threat to humanity, but Kate's father may hold a key to survival. It seems that the elder Brewster is a General in charge of a computer network known as ""Skynet,"" and with a virus on the loose in the nation's systems, Skynet may have to be activated to control vital defense systems. It is at this point that the film shifts into overdrive, as a series of action and chase sequences ensue (including a spectacular car chase involving a gigantic crane as John and Kate attempt to save the world and themselves from death and total devastation).
To say the film is action packed would be an understatement, as Schwarzenegger is at the top of his game and once again shows that he is the top action star in the world and despite some recent setbacks, at 54 he is still king of the hill. His Terminator blends action and humor without ever losing his sense of brutal efficiency and determination to complete his mission no matter what the cost.
Stahl and Danes have good chemistry with one another and are elevated beyond the typical characters in distress role. Stahl plays Connor as a lonely man who is unsure of his destiny and is haunted by the notion that he is to be the savior of humanity, as he feels he can barely take care of himself. However, when the chips are down, Connor, like Brewster, finds an inner fire and strength that will ensure their place in history when their destinies arrive.
One of the biggest surprises in the film is that of Loken, as she plays the T-X with a mix of brutality and sensuality. Unlike Robert Patrick's chilling turn as the T-1000 in the last film, Loken plays the T-X as a deadly and brutal killer who takes satisfaction in her tasks, but is not above a dry sense of humor and a sense of style and fashion. She is beauty and the beast in one and is easily a match for Arnold's Terminator. Loken mixes a quiet intensity with a steel gaze as she dispatches those in her way only showing any hint of emotion when she is killing like a predatory cat toying with her prey.
The special effects in the film are solid and Stan Winston once again shows off his skills, as the designs of the machines are first-rate. The action is relentless and it is nice to see that real stunts were used for many sequences instead of being created by CGI, thus giving a sense of reality and unforced spectacle to the action that recent films such as ""The Matrix Reloaded"" and ""Hulk"" seemed to lack.
This is not to say that T3 is goes without issues. The film does not have the depth of story and the emotional attachment that the previous two films had, and character development is mostly nodded at as much of the premise was established in the previous films. I can see how some will take it one way and others will find issues with it differing from the original and perhaps the ending of the film.
I prefer to look at the film as an enjoyable summer film; it is entertaining, continues a great series, and is easily the most satisfying and entertaining of the summer blockbusters. And I do not think I am going out on a limb by saying that the Terminator will be back.

1475574,4,B00005JM0B,"To be fair, I went into the movie expecting it to top T2...That was my fault.  The movie by itself is credible and enjoyable to watch.  It has humor, suspense, intrigue and climax.  There are hero's and heroines.  Overall the movie was worth watching, and most likely I will be adding it to my DVD collection.  But I do have some knocks.
1. The villan in this movie seemed to evoke this annoying quality.  The movie doesn't make you respect her power, like the T-1000 did, it's more like she is just a more advanced weapon and basically real annoying.  Take for example her weapon.  There are times where she could have used it, and for all intents and purposes the movie would have been over, but no, she stuck to hand to hand combat.  That was annoying.  Big Picture Bottom Line, the villan is not credible.
2. The John Connor the actor, my God, do I need to say tree hugger.  He sounded so much like a liberal leftist agenda pusher I could hardly stand him talking.
3. Claire Danes, never been particularly impressed with her work but she did alright in this movie.  I think with the budget they put in on this one they could have afforded a little more muscle in that role.  I should say the same for John Connor.
4. There wasn't the love in this movie that made the other so popular and strong.  The theme of the 2nd movie was that even a machine can know what love is, even if it something he could never do.
That's what makes T2 such a found memory for me, and why I continue to watch it to this day.
Hope this was helpful.
Overall I loved the movie and would watch it again, and even pay to go to the theater to watch it again.",1065052800,,1635,4.215434083601286
1475575,1,B00005JM0B,"Before i start, i would like to mention that i am a big fan of the first two Terminator films.
All i respect about this T3 is Arnold and the special effects.
1. The acting is crap, apart from Arnold that is
2. The plot is too much like T2 and it contradicts the ""judgement day"" theory
3. To many jokes overshadowed the threat of a nuclear war
4. The TX was not frightening at all
5. ""you remind me of my mother"", Save me from those silly one liners, please. The dialogue is funny.
6. Johnathan Mostow, you should be very ashamed, and I hope you get shot. LOL
No seriously the film was terrible, A big shame.
I won't treat T3 as a sequel, but a ""cash in on the Terminator franchise"" film.
I'll be buying Matrix-Reloaded on DVD instead.",1065052800,12,734,4.176056338028169

This was a well made movie. It had a lot of anticipation. The special affects are great, the action is great, the acting is great.
I'd have to say what I was really disappointed with in the movie was the T-X. They just didn't do enough with her. In Terminator and T2 the Terminator's have this swagger. You just never though they'd kill those suckers. When they did you almost had a sense of relief come over you. The TX never has that swagger. You don't ever really think she's gonna get them. Your more pre-occupated on wether they will stop Judgement Day from happening.
Thats my only knock on the movie. I did enjoy this movie a lot. Arnold once again shows that he's the greatest action hero of all time. If you liked the previous Terminator movies, you'll like this. If you like science fiction or action movies, you'll like Terminator 3. If you like arnold you'll definetly like it. It's just a good movie.

Arnnold sent back to protect John Conner from another, more sophisticated Terminator....sound familiar? Yeah, I thought so too. Once agin the CGI and effects are spectacular as would be expected, and the acting is good (Albeit Arnold's Terminator sometimes seems a little too human.)Of course, we welcome beautiful newcomer Kristanna Loken to the screen (WOW!)

1475640,5,B00005JM0B,"Movie is about The Skynet System sending back into the present...... a Terminatrix  that is part liquid metal and part machine who's ability is to morph into a target she kills and to hack into varies types of machines and controls them mentally. Her mission is to destroy alot of targets (liutenants of the future war) but her main objective is to destroy the primary target....... John Conner! Of course the Terminator (Ah-nold) is sent back to protect him and some other chick! Only this time the Terminator doesn't follow orders. His primary objective is to get John and his lady to a safe haven to avoid getting killed by the nuclear war! So there!
What an awsome movie! For one thing, the action is explosive and the story is solid and sticks to the tradition of the other 2 Terminator movies! Ah-nold, as usual, is funny with his cheesy one liners, and the chick who played the evil Terminatrix is  hot and sexy! The fx was awsome, the whinny loser who played John Conner was good at his role as well as the redheaded girl with a big nose. The best part in this movie is when both Terminators were man handly each other, running each other through walls..... kinda like Ah-nold and T-1000 only this was better! Some critic said that this movie is a rip-off of the Matrix! WHAT A GOOF!! Terminator was the first to ever come up with the idea of A.I. destroying the human race (unless I missed something here). 5 stars and I WON'T TAKE IT BACK!!!",1064275200,2,1451,4.492424242424242

Oh yay, another more advanced Terminator is coming back to kill John and Arny has to save him...again.  The commercials didn't really do anything to contradict my original pessamism.
Boy was I wrong, In my mind, this movie blows T2 out of the water.  Granted it is not the groundbreaker of special effects that T2 was, but as far as being able to laugh at a movie that is still very much a suspensful action flick, this is a masterpiece.  It does an excellent job of making you care about each of the characters, having the main villain be a hot chick doesn't hurt either, and the ending (I will not give it away) was a complete suprise.
With the way it ended though, I wouldn't be suprised if they call the next sequal ""The Rise of John Connor"".  It would of course have to be NC-17 though.",1063929600,4,887,4.255952380952381

This was the 1st terminator movie that I have seen that was in the theatres.  My only other terminator experience was T2: 3D that's at the Universal theme parks, but the movie didn't have the most complex storyline, and I knew the basics, so I figured out most of it.  How was the movie?  The special effects were great.  Industrial Light and Magic did it again.  Besides from that, the dialogue was weak, the story was very predictable, and they told you what would happen next in the movie constantly so there were no suprizes.  It also seemed like Arnold wrote himself out of the series if they do make a next one by killing his robot self and the world was basically destroyed at the end of the movie.",1063843200,,946,4.427745664739884

1475646,4,B00005JM0B,"HD definitely does wonders for these kind of action movies. It really brings them to life, and does them justice. I did originally see it at the cinema, but HD certainly comes second to seeing a film at the cinema. It's THAT good.

The film is actually R-rated in America, but was only 12A here. The previous two were 15's, so I thought were gory/violent bits cut out of T3. I seriously didn't notice whether there was anything cut. On a second watching, maybe, but I really wasn't looking for cuts. You have to feel sorry for Arnie throughout this film, he really gets a rough ride.

The film starts off like T2 - except it's John Conner talking about the future, rather than Sarah Conner, who doesn't appear in this film. I'm glad she refused to do it, especially after her appearance in T2 - she did NOT look right with those muscles. To explain her disappearance, she was killed off (charming). She simply appeared via a coffin. Nick Stahl, who does a great job of taking over from Edward Furlong, plays John Conner. I will always know Nick Stahl from `The Man Without A Face', where he played opposite Mel Gibson. He was a lot younger in that film, but he still looks the same, even with stubble, and looks a tiny bit older.

When the TX appears, played by ""model"" (and boy, can you see it!) Kristianna Loken, I was glad that I wasn't in the cinema with a bunch of teenage guys, who would have probably started wolf whistling. She does appear naked for the first couple of minutes, and her hair is artfully brushed to cover her up, so nothing is seen. She scares the living daylights out of a woman, before taking over her car. She also manages to scrape her long hair back into a tight bun, which is very stereotypical for a female in this kind of film. She looks tough and hard-faced. I'd love to see the outtakes from this film, to see whether she does actually laugh during scenes, which then have to be cut out. She remains expressionless, and hardly speaks. Arnie speaks more in this film! And in any of the fight sequences, does a hair get harmed or get out of place on her blonde head? No way!

Of course, Arnie appears naked too, and immediately walks into a strip club, full of screaming women. He tells the male stripper (who sounds obviously gay) to give him his clothes, and then dresses up in them. He pulls out the shades, which are star-shaped and look as though they've been borrowed from Elton John! Thankfully, he finds a cooler pair of shades. Arnie wouldn't be the Terminator without his shades. Not quite Matrix shades, but never mind.

Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) plays an old schoolfriend of John Conner's, and it just so happens, that they ""made out"" in someone's basement. So there's a certain connection, although absolutely NO chemistry between them. She almost turns out to be a resurrection of Linda Hamilton's character, even John Conner comments on this! You need a tough female character (apart from stony-faced Kristianna), and Linda Hamilton filled that part very well, in the first two films. Now Claire Danes has taken over from her. She's a far cry from the only other role I've ever seen her in, that of Juliet in Baz Luhrmann's `Romeo & Juliet'.

There are two, very obvious hints that there will be a T4, and personally, the format is getting a little tired now. You know the various Terminators are going to come back and try & kill off John Conner, and he's going to succeed each time. I don't think they can carry on with this story much longer, it will have been milked for all its worth by the end of the next film. And they should change the story - maybe set it in the future? (But would it still be called Terminator?) But what with the lovely Arnie being governor of California now, he obviously has lots more important things to do than star in another film.

This is a great film, if you're a fan of the Terminator series. It's best if you have already seen T1 and T2 to get continuity of the film. It's easily my favourite, after watching them all a couple of times now.",1063497600,,4029,4.466032608695652
1475717,4,B00005JM0B,"When T3 begins, a lot of audience members might ask themselves ""How can this possibly top T2?"". The simple answer is, it can't.
That isn't shameful by any stretch, as T2 was arguably the best action movie ever made. T3, however, manages to have both great action and a great story, more than enough to entertain and even provoke thought. Though showing his age, Arnold still manages to shine in the role that made him a real movie star, and Nick Stahl is a great replacement for Edward Furlong's John Conner. While it probably won't make it onto any top 10 lists, T3 is more than enough to please any fans of the series or action fans in general.",1063497600,,646,4.436974789915967
1475718,2,B00005JM0B,"I don't understand why this has gotten alot of good reviews. This movie adds nothing new AT ALL to the Terminator story. This was a showcase for Arnold Schwarzeneger to get back into the spotlight for his laughable election campaign. T3 brings back John Anderson,played by Nick Stahl (Why, Oh Why couldn't they have gotten Edward Furlong???), and Claire Danes as John's childhood friend. It appears that another Terminator has been sent to kill John (AGAIN) and ""AH-nold"" is sent back (AGAIN) to stop her. Thats right, her. I have nothing at all against a female terminator, but it just seems they made her a woman just so they could say, ""See!? It's not T2! The Terminator's a woman!"". But the truth is, this is EXACTLY T2. Yes, there are subtle differences, but not many. And whats even worse is this movie has absolutely no flair at all. The first Terminator movie had the good script. The second Terminator movie had the style. The third Terminator movie has neither. It does have expensive, big action scenes where they destroy a few million dollars worth of stuff, but nothing we haven't seen better action movies do before. T2 had innovative action scenes, such as the chase through the drainage area in the middle of Los Angeles with an 18 wheeler. This movie does involve a chase sequence trying to mimick the drainage scene, but 12 years after T2 this has been done a million times before. The special effects are not special at all, especially after movies like ""The Matrix Reloaded"" or as a matter of fact, ANY movies to have come out in the past few years. But let me go back to the story. As I was watching this movie, I kept on waiting for some sort shocking revelation to the Terminator world. All of a sudden, this movie just ended. What!?!? I can't believe I paid $6.00 to learn absolutely nothing
new to this story. It just ends suddenly and you leave not knowing much more than you knew coming in. For all the fanatic fanboys out there, YES I know there are some revelations to the story, but they are small ones. If you are not a fan of the Terminator series and are looking for a good action movie, don't look here. They say there is going to be a T4, but I'm not so sure if I will see it. I'm a fan of the Terminator and I was bored to death. Hasta La Vista ""AH-nold""

1475720,5,B00005JM0B,"About a couple of days after its release, I managed to check out the highly anticipated ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" at the theater, and let me tell you that the film blew me away! Especially since ""T3"" has spectacular action sequences and awesome special effects from start to finish! Yet, to me, ""Terminator 3"" is not better than ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" (which will forever remain one of the best action films of all time), but it is, however, better than the first ""Terminator"" film from way back in 1984. I do regret them not picking James Cameron to direct ""T3"", but I do give kudos to director Jonathan Mostow (""U-571"") for his intense direction of this film. And guess who's back?! That's right! Superstar Arnold Schwarzenegger (""Collateral Damage"") is back in the role that made him a household name...""The Terminator""! Joining him are Nick Stahl (""In The Bedroom""), Claire Danes (""The Hours""), and Kristanna Loken (TV's ""Mortal Kombat: Conquest""), in which they gave tremendous performances as well.
""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" starts out about 12 years after the events of ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"". The apocalyptic prediction of Judgment Day was never prevented, only postponed. John Connor (Stahl), now 22, is living ""off the grid"" (meaning no credit cards, no cell phone, etc.), being totally disconnected from society. During the film, Connor is being pursued by the T-X (Loken), another ruthless killing machine from the future sent by Skynet, the evil supercomputer that controls machines from all around the world. T-X's mission is to pick up where her predecessor (the liquid metal T-1000) left off: to stop Connor from becoming the savior of mankind. Then, soon enough, an obsolete, disadvantaged T-850 Terminator (Schwarzenegger) arrives from the future to protect Connor and Kate Brewster (Danes), a girl from his past, in triumphing over the technologically superior T-X and forestall the looming threat of Judgment Day...or it will be the end of life as we know it!
In conclusion, ""Terminator 3"" has it all: Action, suspense, a powerful storyline, laugh-out-loud humor that Schwarzenegger can always provide us with, and pulse-pounding special effects! ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" is, without a doubt, one of the best action films that I've seen all summer and will be an unforgettable DVD must-have addition to the first two ""Terminator"" films!",1063152000,2,2402,5.161538461538462

I thought this movie was better than the first two Terminator movies, especially the script.  This movie had more funny dialogue than the first two movies.  Plus there is a car chase scene in this movie that is very well done (I thought it was just as good as the one in Bad Boys II).  Also you rarely see a fight scene taking place in a restroom.

1475722,5,B00005JM0B,"Just when doubt had washed away many of our hopes of Arnold Schwarzenegger returning as the futuristic cyborg Terminator, his role as the imfamous human cyborg machine ushers him back into action and in many ways, redeems his career after several flops and an atrocity or two (Batman and Robin anyone?).
It all happens ten years after the pivotal events of the 1991 masterpiece Judgement Day when John Connor who has survived two major assassination attempts on him and is now living off the grid on the streets, completely closed off from the world. Connors life is once again put in grave danger when the machines send back a state of the art cyborg disguised as an innocent woman to kill John Connor in an attempt to finish the job that was failed by the first Terminator, and the T-1000. Meanwhile, the computer network Skynet is scheduled to be put into operation and link up all of the worlds computer systems but something goes horribly wrong when a massive computer virus wrecks the networks around the world and causes machines to go beserk and also threatens to cause nuclear Armageddon to occur when the machines, who seemingly develop a mind of their own, launch nuclear destruction all over the world.
Although this doesnt necessarily match the dizzying heights of Judgement Day, Rise Of The Machines makes a great successor and this is the darkest of the three Terminator movies.
The first Terminator movie, which Rise of the Machines is like a prequel to, is slightly stymied by some extremely dated production especially with the futuristic battle scenes. The spaceship scenes at the beginning of the first Terminator movie looked more like a plastic toy suspended on puppet strings than a science-fiction movie shot and made for some silly popcorn material. In T3, that same spaceship looks a lot more realistic. The production style of Judgement Day was a vast improvement and the movie was many years ahead of its time. Rise of The Machines is the same way although not as groundbreaking as the Judgement Day one.
Althought, it can apply to all three Terminator movies, Rise of The Machines is very unsettling in its storyline because it is very possible that a nuclear war could break out because of a computer glitch involving nuclear warheads technology. Because much of the defense industry relies on internet and computer networks, if the whole network goes haywire and/or stops working because of a technological malfunction or computer virus, the results could be catastrophic although maybe I might be a bit exaggerated.
Rise Of The Machines is a welcome addition to the Terminator series and while it may be the weakest of the three, it is still awesome and if its to be the last one in the series, it ends the series on a good note. Buy it when it comes out on DVD.",1062979200,4,2794,4.7987551867219915
1475723,3,B00005JM0B,"Following on from the last installment of the film series - James Cameron`s groundbreaking Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991) John Connor (Nick Stahl) is now in his 20`s living off the streets of present day LA - and a female Terminator called the T-X, or Terminatrix is sent back through time to kill John and also his future spouse Kate Brewster (a somewhat miscast and wooden Clare Danes, as her sole acting requirement appears to be to look frightened and scream). As before, a T-800 unit (Arnie) is also sent back to protect John....
Where do I start? As a standalone action piece, I enjoyed this film and thought it was great fun. Perhaps my expectations were set too high though when thinking of it as a `sequel` to the other parts - the setup is almost identical to T2 for one thing with basically the same story, just with a new, upgraded Terminator. This surely smacks of laziness.

Brad Fiedel`s classic score, so synonomous with the two previous films in building up tension, is missing (though a new version of the famous theme is reprised at the end).
This film got a suprisingly lax 12A rating in Britain (compared to an R in the United States). It was perhaps due to a combination of all the killings happening offscreen and the lack of a recognisable, claustrophobic score (so we can know when the T-X is coming, for example) that made this film feel different. Where was the menace?
I never really got the feeling the T-X (a hot looking Kristanna Loken, who dresses in red leather) posed any real danger which was a shame - she lacks the cruel, sadistic nature of Robert Patrick in Terminator 2, or the `hunter` quality of Arnie in the first film, and of course looks like a catwalk model. The sort of person who would pout if you stole her Macy`s card.
This absence of impending doom or evil is no mean feat when you consider the main thrust of the film is about an approaching nuclear holocaust.
I liked the referential humour in this film though and there were some good jokes. Witness the gentle self parody of the scene where Arnie enters a strip club on `Ladies Night` - reaches into his leather jacket to put on his famous shades, and pulls out a pair of star shaped glasses Elton John would have worn in his 70`s heyday. Priceless.
There were some very good action scenes, including an unbelievable car chase that rivals a similar scene from The Matrix Reloaded, and some astounding effects.
The last act, and in particular the conclusion of the film, is brilliant. I won`t spoil the ending for you, but suffice to say it is remarkably downbeat for a Hollywood film, and more importantly remains true to the spirit of The Terminator franchise. Make no mistake, Jim Cameron`s ghost haunts this film, the ending recalling what he left behind.
Certainly not up to the standards of Cameron`s earlier classics in my opinion as its` less thought provoking and dark, but its` still a good film overall.",1062547200,,2921,4.617307692307692
1475724,4,B00005JM0B,"I am a life-long Terminator fan, but when I heard plans for T3, I cringed. I knew that the movie would be horrible, as most sci-fi franchises are. However, I was surprised to find a film that not only knocked my socks off, but literally left me  asking ""when does T4 come out?"" The film's plot is so paper thin, its amazing that this didn't go straight-to-video. The film's saving grace is its self-satirizing attitude, and a car chase that puts the ""Matrix: Reloaded"" freeway chase to absolute shame. It seems like half a city was destroyed to get the sequence in, and it left the audience wildly cheering and applauding. Arnold isn't anything special, and you can tell that age is getting the better of him, but his tongue-in-cheek attitude (his reference to being an ""obsolete model"" was really quite brilliant) really helps to make this film enjoyable. I would recommend this film to the ""Matrix"" audience that was disappointed by this spring's film. ""T3"" proves that you don't have to be philosophical or pretentious to entertain - just be yourself, which is what this film is all about. Is it ""Casablanca?"" Hell no. But it's the most entertaining and wild ride that you will experience in a cinema this summer.",1062115200,3,1216,4.735849056603773
1475725,2,B00005JM0B,"There are few movie series that affect the way I view the world and how I view the so called ""norm"" of every day life. The Terminator movies have done more for me than just entertain me for 2 hours. Needless to say, I was overjoyed to hear that the third installment of the series was in the works. But has new news of the development came out, it seemed to progress like untreated acne; only getting worse. James Cameron not having any role in the production. Seeing as he was the man responsible for the creative magic for the first two, this was a low blow. Then the fact that Linda Hamilton (aka Sarah Connor) would not be featured or the leader of the human resistance, Edward Furlong. All this bad news badly weighed down my enthusiasm. Even then, I hoped for the best and saw the movie. Dissipointed is too strong of a word, but so is impressed. The movie had great action scenes, Arnold, and the special effect magic of Stan Winston. Then the cold realizations hit you. ""This plot is almost totally similiar to the second one"" , ""The T1000 was far more deadly than the TX"", "" Sarah Connor's exit from the series lacked any creativity"", ""I want to stab Nick Stahl"".....just for example. So many elements of the plot seemed thrown together with little regard on how it would affect the films presentation. Sarah dying from leukimia? I say if you're going to kill off a major character in a series, at least give the death some logical connection to the character. All in all, the film was entertaining but that's about it. But so is watching a clown on fire.",1062028800,5,1564,4.452961672473868
1475726,3,B00005JM0B,"I was disappointed when I first learned James Cameron wouldn't be directing this movie.  Now I can see why.  In a nutshell, this is a ripoff of Cameron's T2 only with a less-interesting storyline.  Without spoiling anything for those who haven't seen it, a number of the action sequences in this movie are direct ripoffs of scenes in T2 leaving you with a ""been-there-seen-that"" feeling.  Due to improvements in special-effects technology, the effects in T3 are the best of any in the Terminator series.  But the story is inferior with little if any moral behind the special effects as there was in T2.  Arnold still looks great, but you don't develop the same bond with his terminator character that you did in T2.  To top it all off, the series storyline really isn't advanced that much in this film.  I was hoping to see the war of the future between man and machine.  This installment merely gets us to the very start of that war.  Apparently, there will be another sequel that will cover the war itself.  Bottom line--worth seeing for Arnold and the great effects, but don't expect as solid (or novel) a story as you saw in T2.",1062028800,,1132,4.61
1475775,5,B00005JM0B,"So i saw this movie, and despite low expectations and bad trailers the movie actually turned out to be a success, It didn'y come close to it's predecessor T2: Judegment Day but a fun and enjoyable ride with a bit of a story that a 5 year old could understand it made it one of this years better movies. Arnold comes back as his most famous role as the T-101 except hes more changed he makes everything jst more funny. The acting is good, not great. So instead of all the mellow-drama from the second Director Johnathan Mostow turns this movie into a fun enjoyable ride worth seeing and having a great time at the movies. If your a fan of the first two movies i reccomend seeing it it's for those people who enjoy the great action and funny one-liners. People who don't enjoy sci-fi and want more of what they saw in t2 like the dramam and apocoliptic sense might not like it  and find it dumbed down but in my chocie i'd have to say see this one it's worth a fun ride.",1061769600,,968,4.204301075268817

First, This film copy too many thing fo earlier Terminator and sript is almost same that T2, the special effect are not so amazing than T2 and some characters are too weak.

1475778,4,B00005JM0B,"T3 is by far the most unique of the series and of the sci-fi genre that I've seen in the past 5 years. It provides the series a slap in the face, if you will. One of the primary themes of the series has been ""The future is not set. There is no fate but what we make for ourselves."" One of T3's most significant themes, quite contrary to this, is that some things are inevitable. Since the beginning, the Terminator series was man against machine, man wins. T3 turns the tide. The inevitability of the war and the machines rising crashes in on the audience. Now, part of the future will happen, no matter what is done to try to avoid it. This theme is frequently found in independent films that want to reveal a future that is as likely to happen as triumphant man, but do not cater to the popular vote or the highest dollar. This was totally unexpected, and is quite unnerving when you consider that in 100% of all box-office sci-fi hits, either 1) man triumphs, 2) man has the choice to control fate, or 3) that all of existance revolves around man.

1475779,1,B00005JM0B,"Alright, the special effects were amazing in this. However, they really, REALLY ruined the series. Terminator 1 and 2 were both incredible movies. James Cameron did an excellent job with both of them. Yet, he hands it down... and what happens? It gets ""terminated"". Why did they try and put a bunch of ""funny"" parts in this? That is completely idiotic, and really delivers a blow to the quality of the entire plot. In the first one there were NO comical scenes, and in the second... maybe one or two, but they were extremely subtle and would not make you laugh out loud. There were too many ""funny"" parts in the 3rd one, and they weren't even funny at that!
This joke they call the ""Terminatrix"" - give me a break; a supermodel? Arnold should be fighting real villains, not some broad on her rusty period. Schwarzenegger looks way too old in the face. The directing was just terrible in this. As much as Arnold is in the movie... somehow he just doesn't seem to be the lead star. More like John Connor's future wife [I forget her character's name]. The guy who played John Connor is a total nerd, and a bad actor to say the least. When they show that scene from the future where his character is an old man, where he's standing up shouting and everybody is cheering after they defeat the terminators or whatever happens, his makeup is so immensely fake looking it's hysterical. He looks exactly like himself, with grey hair and pudding splattered on his face. Corny, way too corny... astonishingly retarded at BEST. This movie was obviously made for the sole purpose of making money from gullible people. Sadly, I was one of them.
Even near the beginning when John Connor has that dream about the Terminators in the future or whatever it is... they look different than the old terminators [meaning they look STUPID in comparison]. I could've sworn that they destroyed any possible chance for somebody to carry on Dyson's work in the second installment of the trilogy... yet somehow Skynet is still built, and all these plotholes seem to fill up with BS explanations that really offer no proof of a genuinely constructed storyline.
As I said, the special effects are very nice - but I certainly hope to Christ that they don't try and make another... who would play John Connor this time... the kid who played Doogie Howser? ...or maybe Johnathan Taylor Thomas? Pathetic, absolutely pathetic. This movie is horrible... spare yourself from being absolutely appaled by this piece of junk and watch something else.",1061683200,14,2509,4.730593607305936
1475780,4,B00005JM0B,"I saw T3 on it's opening day here in Australia with a lot of high hopes and thoughts. From the haunting music playing over the opening titles (though I missed the T2 theme)really set up a good mood. Then a little later watching a bottle fall into a sea of skulls to rise up into the future with breathtaking and destructive awe of the Machines in action!!! It really begins with great scope and determination to be another step in the Terminator series,only settling down a briefly to introduce our four main chracters. From then onwards the movie pretty much doesn't stop and leads into an amazing truck/car chase scene with great effects and sound. Seeing Arnie 'back' is a highlight, his role here is his best since T2 which was 12 yrs ago. He suits the role and gets into the character well. Some of the dialogue from Nick,Arnie and Clair was great within the movie with Arnie being serious and a more 'inhuman' machine which contrasts the T2 Arnie. After some awesome action sequences the movie delves into the process of turning nasty...with the iminant doom of Judgement Day only hours away and the Terminator hinting at what he just accomplished before beging reprogrammed and sent back...with a nice bell sound in the music as he says it. Nice stuff. This all leads to a finale that is just amazing and brilliant with some more terrific standoffs between Arnie's Machine and Loken's TX...and skynet taking control! After some great moments it takes us to somewhere humanity dreads and hopes never becomes reality...the end of the world as we know it. Beltrami's music is beautiful, with the haunting tunes(which I found similar to a BBC Dr Who episode titled ""Terror of the Zygons"", as John and Kate enter the fall out shelter command room,which leads into a lovely yet sad theme as the missiles destroy our world and closes on a skull of the Terminator and his red light dimming to bring us to a closure with the great Terminator theme on the credits(reworked). It truely is a great movie and was a highlight and new approach to a great series. I love Jim Cameron's first two(and his other films, especially Titanic!) and now Mostow's adds another dimension to it...not as creative in certain ways and sinister as T2, but more a solem and eerie film with action in it. A great movie, which I recommend and probably 2003's top film so far. A wonderful job and it's nice to see Terminator and Arnie back! Can't wait for the DVD!!!",1061683200,,2438,4.658932714617169
1475781,4,B00005JM0B,"Just came back from watching T3 (a little late, I know). I feel sort of empty, actually. You'll get it if you've seen the ending.
I thought the film was rather good. A little less explanation and story than T2, but still very entertaining. A lot of reviews I've read complain on how T2 had pretty much ended skynet and T3 doesn't explain why the terminators have STILL been developed.
Well, it's pretty logical. The Terminators were always going to be invented. They had been invented through technology in T1. Yes, in T2 they had found the arm and chip of the Terminator in T1 and used it to develop the machines. But in T1, they didn't have anything to work with and STILL they created the machines.
So yes, everything was destroyed in T2, but that doesn't mean development hadn't started over. From scratch.
The scene in the movie I *loved* was when the Terminatrix tastes John Connor's blood on the cloth. Her reaction shows just how important John is going to be in defeating the machines; if a robot (especially this one) can look that shocked, pleased and overwhelmed by finding him, he must be EXTREMELY important in the future (here I was, thinking ,,What can one man do?"").
The scene I thought was kind of stupid was when the male Terminator has been reprogrammed and is in serious doubt about his missions. It was all a bit unbelieveable, too corny and drawn-out.
Anyhow; not a lot *really* happens in T3. Nothing that would take me more than 3 lines to explain. But it was incredibly entertaining, time flew by and it is a very great and very obvious setup for a T4.",1061510400,,1578,4.540350877192982
1475782,3,B00005JM0B,"""Terminator"" and ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" are two of the all-time classics of science fiction.  Debates rage back and forth over which film was better.  Is it ""T2"" with its non-stop juggernaut of action?  Or, is the original ""Terminator"" with its suspense, human drama, and fresh story?  The argument will like never be settled.  One question that can be answered, though, is 'Is ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines""' as good as its predecessors.  The answer to that question is definitely 'no'.  ""Terminator 3"" is nowhere near as good as the movies that spawned, but, at the same time, it is not a bad movie either.

The problems that plague ""T3"" may stem from the fact that James Cameron is not directing this time (""U-571"" director Jonathan Mostow helms it this time).  They may also simply stem from the fact that there has been such a long layoff between movies.  ""Judgment Day"" came out in 1991, which ""Rise of the Machines"" was released this year, 2003.  The novelty has worn off by now.  It also maybe just the simple fact that movie is not much more than a series of protracted actions scenes that seem like they could have been cut from the earlier films.  The movie still manages to garner a positive review because, in its climax, it takes a bold and unexpected turn that shows real audacity and leaves the door open for additional sequels.

""Rise of the Machines"" focuses of the life of John Connor (Nick Stahl) in decade or so since the events of ""Judgment Day"".  While the destruction of Skynet labs seemed to have put an end to the technology that would have brought about holocaust of Judgment Day, Connor is unable to feel comfortable.  He lives an existence that make him near impossible to trace, fearing the monsters of the future may one day come back for him.  And, like in the previous film, they do.  This time, it's a female Terminator, the T-X (played icily by model Kristanna Loken) who has been sent back to kill Connor and thereby end the threat of the human who can defeat the machines.  In a carbon copy move of the previous film, Arnold Schwarzenneger's Terminator (or a copy of him) is sent back in time to defend Connor from this new threat.  From the point of their arrival, ""Rise of the Machines"" becomes nothing more than one long chase scene.  Along the way, Connor and the Terminator pick up an acquaintance from Connor's past, Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) and they rush to get away from the T-X.  It's important for them to stay alive because it seems that Judgment day was NOT averted, and Connor must live so that the resistance can be led against the Machines.  Connor still believes Judgment Day can be avoided and its a race against time to prevent it.

Nick Stahl may not seem like a great choice to play John Connor.  He still seems childish and unimpressive (how are we to believe this man is supposed to lead the resistance?), but then Edward Furlong wasn't exactly an inspired choice to play him in ""T2"".  It's nice to see Arnold back in his familiar role.  Though, at times, he seems like a parody of his famous character.  Danes is really just window dressing in her role as Kate Brewster.  She doesn't really contribute much beyond a vast catalog of screams and pained expressions.  Loken's quite a looker as the T-X and is quite menacing, but the role doesn't exactly give her much to act with, so it's hard to evaluate her performance.

Overall, ""Rise of the Machines"" is a respectable film.  It's not a great one, but it doesn't fail the way other sequels have after long layoffs (""Alien: Resurrection"" to name one).  It's a classic summertime popcorn action movie.  It's also not a bad way to spend 2 hours.",1061510400,,3669,4.602465331278891
1475783,4,B00005JM0B,"Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines delivers another satisfying dose of mechanistic mythology.  It is a kinetic fireball which sears and seethes itself across the screen, fast-paced images flipping by with an abandon that is hard to keep up with, all the while daring the viewer to try as best s/he can.  From the opening apocalyptic prologue of the oncoming holocaust at the metallic hands of the feral-looking shiny exoskeleton automatons to the final desperate coda, the film engulfs you in its speedy wit and voracious velocity.
John Connor has grown up since last we saw him in T2; even though the tenebrous vision of Judgment Day has been ostensibly vanquished due to the prior actions of he, his mother, and the T-800, the young man finds himself still troubled and haunted by nightmares and phobias connected to that horrific moment when Skynet realizes that it can think and decides to reject its organic creators with cruel prejudice, just as a vicious pack of antibodies will rebuff a much-needed transplanted organ.  Connor learns soon enough, however, that history is about to repeat itself: a new Terminator- the TX- has looped through the fourth dimension to destroy him and his future wife, Kate Brewster; they are destined to lead the resistance against the machines...and from whom does he get this information?  From none other than the T800, the same model sent to kill his mother in the first movie and then to protect her in the second film.  The formula is repeated, with Schwarzenegger as the cyborg version of a superhuman Secret Service agent, doing anything and everything it can to protect his human charges.
As one can imagine, the ante is upped considerably with T3.  The chases, stunts, car crashes, shotgun blasts, fiery combustions, property destruction, special effects- all of it is befitting a movie of this type in these contemporary times, even if it isn't necessarily seminal in any specific fashion; perhaps the best way to put it is that T3 pays appropriate homage to the history of the franchise even though it does not come up with any fundamentally unique presentational templates.  In fact, to hammer this point home even further, it is extremely interesting to note that the absence of the guiding hand of one of celluloid's most recent godheads- James Cameron- is filled amiably enough by the people in charge of this outing.  Not having the captain behind the Titanic phenomenon calling the shots on this new dystopian vision of a future corrupted and raped by technology which has adopted and amplified the worst of mankind's failings is as anathema as the suggestion that George Lucas should have nothing to do with the next episode of his Annikin Skywalker trilogy; stony perceptions can sometimes be jackhammered through, though, and this is an example of such.
Schwarzenegger plays the iconic robot the same as ever: stiff, stoic, superhuman...and with an equal amount of humor.  This is the Austrian's most recognizable role, and his fans will never let him forget it; still, he does not resist the box he's been placed in- instead, he makes the best of this claustrophobic chamber and stretches the limitations as far as he's able.  The female menace is essentially the T1000 with a sex change, and that's okay- why alter the specs too radically?  And while no one will ever accuse T3 of diving into the depths of profound proclamations for purposes of dictating various dissertations to the masses through subtextual theses existing in shadowy tandem with the stunning visual flair executed on the superficial level, it is notable to consider the essential statement coded in the central core of the plot's DNA: that the future- destiny- is not the rubber mechanism we want it to be, and for one to think it is anything but immutable is to willingly invite supercilious contaminants into the individual's ego.
T3 is faster and more furious than any greenlighted Vin Diesel vehicle; at a lean/mean 110 minutes, it's worth the ride.",1061424000,,3985,4.968468468468468

While I think Terminator 2 is still the best film in the series, this movie definately takes a close second. Arnold said he'd be back, and he most definately is. He still kicks major butt as the T-800 terminator, hardly looking a day older than he did in Terminator 2. Kristanna Loken is the sexy and deadly Terminatrix, and she definately looks like she's been one of the best kept secrets amongst movie actresses to show up in quite some time. Nick Stahl and Clair Danes are excellent in their roles as well. The action in the film is top notch, being rivaled only by The Matrix Reloaded, and the story told here is very good, even if it is lacking some of the magic that James Cameron had in the first two films. It's still an excellent addition to the series, and I eagerly await the release of the T3 DVD, as well as the inevitable announcement of Terminator 4.

1475882,4,B00005JM0B,"I grew up with The Terminator movies.  I remember seeing Terminator one for the first time in VCR, in a party sometimes in the late 1980s.  I'm not quite positive I saw 'T2' in the movies, but I sure saw it on TV a short time after the release.  Over the years, I've seen both movies more then a few times, and they are forever part of me.
While other action/SF movie series have been around while I was growing up (Die Hard, Aliens), none other has the significance that the Terminator has for me.  Words like ""Hasta La Vista, baby"", countless scenes such as the police station massacre in T1 and the murder of John's adopting parents in T2, I consider classics.
So I do not think I've looked forward to a film as much as I've looked forward to T3 in quite a while.  I was expecting a disappointment.  Surprisingly, although I do not think T3 was anywhere as good as the first two, it manages to hold well the torch.
The greatest problem with T3 is that it is not nearly as epic or as original as the first two films.  The first two films were action filled dramas, epics in which the fighting scenes were given additional depth by the strong character drama behind them.  Although no one would nominate Arnie as to any acting awards (and some would make him the governor of California :-), he fitted well the role of the emotionless terminator, and managed to be quite touching as the 'good' terminator in T2.  Other actors, most notably Linda Hamilton, created interesting and intriguing characters.
In T3, all these elements almost entirely absent.  The movie only feels like an epic in the very beginning and the very end.  In between, it is a non stop action movie, a near perfect example for a fast paced action thriller that's supposed to be the summer's best seller.
There are very few slow scenes along the way.  Rather, about 10 minutes into the movie, we are hit with a big action chase which pretty much continues throughout the film, which has almost no middle part.  The film feels a little disjoint - it splits almost equally between one long, elaborate chase scene in which the heroes are escaping the deadly Terminator-X, and another long action sequence in which the characters try to stop Judgment Day.
The mood of the film is very different from the dark epic of James Cameron.  Rather, the feel is almost entirely good natured and fun.  Among the action scenes, one liners and jokes are thrown along the way in abandon.  Many of those are quite hilarious, too.  My favorite is probably a scene in which John Connor (Nick Stahl) trys to explain to love interest and female sidekick Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) what is going on.  ""Tell her who I am?""  he asks the Terminator.  The machine answers something along the lines of ""John Connor is the only hope of humanity in the struggle against the machines"".  The surreal nature of it all is extremely funny.
For the most part, the acting is well done.  Although it would have been nice to see Edward Furlong reprise the role from T2, now ten years older, Nick Stahl does a very good job.  Claire Danes is also nice as Kate, making her a very sympathetic character.  Arnold pretty much plays the Terminator as usual, although the truth must be told that he is now simply too old for the role.  The greatest disappointment is Kristanna Loken, who is very pretty but does not make T-X anything like a threatening or imposing presence.
Terminator 3, even more then its predecessors, is an action film, and as such is must be judged.  There is action a plenty here, the highlight of which is undoubtedly a car chase with a giant crane that reeks destruction in LA streets.  The action is very well carried out.  The humorous tone makes it a little less threatening then the action scenes in the other films, and many of the scenes are similar to what we've already seen (often as a deliberate homage), but they are nonetheless effective and entertaining.
On balance, I would have judged most of the movie to be somewhat of a disappointment, where good entertaining action scenes and often very funny gags are not enough to compensate for the lack of gravity.  But the ending changed everything.
Without spoiling the fun, the ending managed to defy my expectations and return the film to the epic track so missing from most of it.  In fact, I would have to say that the ending was near perfect - it completely captured the majesty in the Terminator series, and transmitted it in a way that contained just the right amount of pathos.

Sure, it is an action film and it lives up to that; however, I was sad to see what they had done with the whole thing.  The most interesting part of the movie was the end.  Everything was like a repeat of T2; shooting police cars with a machine gun, the cars chase, the terminator fight scene, and although a little different, the female villain.
I wish they had stared the move where it ended and get into the real good stuff, and then it would have a more appropriate title, ""T3-The Rise & Fall of the Machines""
I'm now keeping my fingers crossed that T4 which I believe will take place in the war torn world will be much better.  I really missed the dark tone, and serious atmosphere of the first film in which the terminator was actually scary.

1475973,2,B00005JM0B,"When science fiction movies like those based in the future or have something to do with it, generally receive huge amounts of appreciation and become increasingly popular, one does not quite resent the idea of watching one of the genre.
I have not watched the first two of the Terminator series, so my views are free from that kind of comparison.
What did I expect from the movie? Thrilling sound-effects and breath-taking visual sequences.
The sound-effects were good and certain scenes showing blasts and the use of their weapons by the Terminator and the Anti-terminator were almost impressive. The attempt at comic relief has proved successful. The computer's view on various subjects was interesting.
However, the movie is basically an endless chase with plenty of 'booms' and 'bangs'. The story is hardly thought-provoking; it does not have that 'unique' and 'unbelievable' and 'interestingly logical' feel to it.
For all those who enjoy raw action, watch the movie, enjoy, HAVE A BLAST!",1060041600,,993,5.173913043478261
1475974,5,B00005JM0B,"It seems that the script writers for T3 listened to the old Elvis Presley song. T3 is a non-stop,  overwhelming, amazing actiong movie. From the beginning to the last scene, the viewer stands in the audience with an open jaw. Thankfully, the producers chose not to ""complement"" the good action sequences with a ""makes-you-think"" plot. There wouldn't be room for this.
But I'm not saying T3 is a stupid movie. It's not. I enjoyed all 109 minutes of it. T3 concentrates on the character of John Connor, after his mother has died. John Connor is now played by Nick Stahl, and he is MUCH better than Edwar Furlong. For the first time we can see John Connor as the true leader of the humans, not an annoying kid who likes to rob money-machines (But if you want to watch scenes from the future and the war against the machines you'll be disappointed). Claire Daines is another touch of talent in the movie.
But let's now concentrate on the two robots of T3. Amazingly, Arnold Schwarzenegger was able to deliver his best performance ever. Forget his recent [stuff], like 6th day, End of days, etc. Schwarzie's T-101 gets better every each time a new Terminator is released. And some funny momonets, too. ""Talk to my hand""... fantastic. And blonde bombshell Kristanna Loken. Where did girl come from? The perfect ""robotess"". Cold as ice and hard as steel.
Sure, some of the scenes are too convenient (Claire Daines knows how to fly that specific airplane, for an example), some of them plainly wrong (Schwarzie's robot displaying emotions, no matter how much ""psychology"" he has in him) and director Jonathan Mostow, although competent in the action scenes, does not try to innovate in his job. His style reminded me  of  Tony Scott. But  T3's proposal clearly was to be a good action movie, and a bridge to a probable T4. Under these assumptions, T3 is excellent.

1475979,2,B00005JM0B,"The latest installment in the ""Terminator"" franchise is neither the tense thriller that the original was or the special effects tour-de-force blockbuster that the sequel was. Not only is Arnold Schwarzenegger the only returning cast member but the series creator, Cameron, is in no way involved either. On its own merits, T-3 is a loud and exciting popcorn movie but as an entry in one of the best sci-film series today, it is a borderline disaster.
Twelves year after T-2, John Connor is a loner walking the Earth (ala Kane in ""Kung-Fu""), refusing to deal with the past and not wanting to except his role in the future. Enter T-X (Kristen Lokken), a lady terminator that is even more advanced than the previous T-1000 model. Her mission is to eliminate Connor and his future liutenants before they can rise up and lead the resistance to victory. As is always the case, the resistance has sent a Terminator of their own back in time to protect him. Sadly, the appeal of Schwarzennegger as the Terminator is somewhat lost in this newer film. He is no longer the comical yet indestructible father-figure trying to understand human emotions. Now, he's just some one-dimensional cyborg throwing around and blowing things up like nobody's business.
Once you look past the excitement and drama in this third entry, you notice how little it has to offer, story-wise. None of the characters seem to have any depth to them. Where in the last film, The Terminator grew through learning from its human counterparts, this time, it is already so many steps ahead of them. Nick Stahl's John Connor gets a few somber moments here and there but the movie never stops to really address the tragedy of the forthcoming nuclear war and why it needs to be stopped. Connor's romantic relationship with Brewster (Danes) is summed up as being ""fate"" via the fact that they once played ""spin the bottle"" together and the fact that they both happen to cross pathes so early on seems more like the result of lazy story-telling than any type of destiny. In fact, the only reason we know these two are romanticlly-linked is through Arnold telling them so. The comedy is equally weak as most attempts at humor just make the characters seem silly such as Arnold aquiring clothing from a male stripper. This sequel doesn't have any great trend-sending tagline either and instead plays on the old ""I'll Be Back"" quote and borrows the dated ""Talk To The Hand"" routine.
As a beloved fan of the classic Terminator films, I found that director Mostow and writers John Brancato & Michael Ferris had literally no idea what they were doing. As is often the case by the third film in a franchise, the idea of a multi-million dollar profit machine always outweighs the intergrity of the presentation. Schwarzenegger's cyborg spends more time telling us the story than Mostow's direction does, Brad Fidel's legendary ""Terminator"" theme is not found in any incarnation, and the ending is so drastically horrible that I felt that they would have been better off, making no sequel at all than trying to make this one. The only thing worse than the ending itself is the opening for yet another Terminator sequel. For shame.",1059696000,5,3176,4.818681318681318
1476094,4,B00005JM0B,"Though many critics have commented that this new Terminator is basically a retelling of the second film, I would like to begin by saying that I was pleasantly surprised by this third installment of this very successful franchise.  Though the film lacked the direction of James Cameron, who was largely responsible for the birth of the Terminator series, it was nonetheless a worthy successor to his earlier works.
The movie is sharp, with a very definitive, high-tech look and feel.  Unlike its predecessors, it does not have a lot of character development in it, save for a very poorly developed relationship between John Connor (played by Nich Stahl) and Kate Brewster (played by Claire Daines), who will eventually become Connor's wife (presumably in Terminator 4).  The characters are the weakest part of the script, and that stands out as a notable weakness in the film.  One example is when the Terminator explains that Brewster is to become Connor's wife, she is completely repulsed by the idea, having just seen her fiancee get killed, and having been kidnapped by Connor.  Throughout the film, she faces more despair, watching the new Terminator (Kristianna Loken) murder her father, and yet, only moments later, she finds herself in Connors arms, and they share a romantic kiss.  With no offense to the screenwriter, people aren't usually overly romantic in the face of armageddon, or in the face of recently losing loved ones, especially one's fiancee and husband within 24 hours of one another, but okay, its only a movie.
What makes this movie work is the comedic timing of many of Schwarzenegger's lines and situations.  When he travels back through time, he finds himself inside a strip club during a male review.  Most of the memorable lines belong to Arnold, who still looks dominant in the role of the Terminator that he created 20 years earlier.
Of course this is a big-budget sci-fi/action flick with many high budget effects.  The new Terminator (Loken) looks slick and sensual, combining the appeal of a woman with the lethal force of a killing machine with a one-tracked mind.
The opening and closing sequences are probably the most haunting,",1059696000,,2165,4.991666666666666
1476095,5,B00005JM0B,"This movie told us the real meaning of judgement day that the other 2 movies didn't.  Judgement Day was never to be stop, it was to survive it.",1059609600,2,143,4.107142857142857
1476096,4,B00005JM0B,"Wow, the big guy is really back, at long last. But this bang-em-up sequel to the sequel was well worth the wait. It is not exactly Academy Award winning stuff, but then again, we are talking about the Terminator here.  Sometimes it's a bit hard to find the big guy amid all the pyrotechnics, explosions, and spectacular truck crashes, but Arnold is definitely back! One thing I find amusing, however, is that the basic cybernetic model Arnold plays keeps getting slimmer with each film, but since the original version was likely easier to spot as a machine due to its incredible bulk and muscularity, maybe such a revised this model could blend into human company and pass without being detected.  So perhaps the machine makers reconfigured its armature as they went along, explaining AHNOLD's progressively slimmer physique in each film.
Anyway, I defy anyone to show me another 55 year old who is this buffed, this muscular, and this awesome! And in the Terminator movies, what really counts here is the combination of special effects and terrific action sequences, which certainly is where the producers have invested most of the effort, energy, and funding.  And while I personally was not as impressed with this effort as I was with the superb production values evident in T-2, there is no doubt that this roller coaster ride of an action flick, which includes an eye-popping and heart-pumping sequence with fire trucks racing through the city streets, will enjoy a wide audience and have a lot of success just based on such pyrotechnics. Yet, having said this, in some ways the only continuity with the first two terminator films is the presence of the big guy himself. In this sense it is less a sequel than it is another episode in the Terminator series, and there is a difference.
The story is set ten years after the closing of the second movie, with John Connor (played here by Nick Stahl) now a young adult living on the margins of society to avoid detection, existing without an apartment, a telephone, or credit cards. He finds himself being hunted by the T-X, the most advanced model of the Terminator series, a prototype designed with cutting-edge capabilities including being disguised as a female. The T-X is superbly underplayed by the fetching Kristana Lokken, being programmed as a murder machine that dispatches anyone it comes across en route to its intended prey, the clever young John Connor.  Enter our boy AHNOLD, an obsolete T-101 model originally programmed as a hunter-killer, but now sent back to rescue Conner so he can prevent his murder so he can survive to become the adult who somehow keeps sending Arnold back to rescue him. Got it?
AHNOLD must also save the comely young Kate Brewster, an old friend of John's who The T-101 has been programmed to recognize as an older Conner's future main squeeze.  Kate is played well by the ever more attractive Claire Danes, who has a terrific future in the film industry, never mind with young John Connor. So the stage is set for yet another protracted series of uneven battles between the mismatched terminator models, with the T-101 attempting to fend off the T-X while keeping the two youngsters alive in the process. As with the previous movies, there are wonderful one-liners, and some gutter humor that we find ourselves laughing along with despite our better natures. I enjoyed the tongue-in -cheek repartee, which is often witty and funny, and this adds a valuable dimension to this film so often missing from other action-fantasy films. All in all, this is a great evening's entertainment. After all, he told us he'd be back! Enjoy!",1059609600,,3618,4.866883116883117
1476097,4,B00005JM0B,"Was not expecting much given the yawny trailors of the movie. Yet the movie is actually quite a decent action flick...jam-packed with special fx, a phatz new model for the oh so bad girl feeling all blithe and lovely in skin-hugging PVC despite a somewhat flimsier pretext for the cyborgs to be hanging around vamoosing and appearing at will. At some points, you may wonder why the machines don't just linger and get their act over with.
The first half is where most of the mind numbing geewhiz stuff is unleashed, but thankfully the movie slacks a little in the second half (perhaps Cameron's influence shows a little late?) adding some tonal balance with a theme. Not quite a landmark in the action genre, T3 still shows Arny has got what it takes to get audiences packing in.

1476098,4,B00005JM0B,"This movie is awesome! I love it! Personally, I didn't really care that James Cameron didn't do the directing, Mostow had done a great job making an action movie that's raging fast, action-packed, and even humorous. To me, this is the best action movie I've ever watched in, say, the last 3 years.
The cast are great, too. Kristanna Loken's T-X is the most destructive babe I've ever seen in a movie. Oh sure, she only had maybe 5 or 6 lines, but hey, what did you expect from a terminator? Cute sales robot girl she ain't.
What I love most about this movie is that it didn't fall into the tried (but still true, apparently) ""The Matrix syndrome"". If you loved and expect to see kung-fu fighting coreography, ludicrously impossible aerobatics, and slow-motion spinning camera ""Matrix-style"", you won't find any here. You'd be much better off watching Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle than this movie. The action is straightforward and swift, and it's non-stop.
Schwarzenegger's T-101 and Loken's T-X duke it out at each other in a fashion robots would: their movements were robotic, crude, raw, but lethal. Seeing T-101 smashed T-X's head through a wall, then seeing HER slammed T-101 through the wall is a joy to behold. They fought exactly like my childhood fantasy: ruining everything when they clashed. Let's just say that everytime these two met, they left a trail of wanton destruction behind them.
The only thing that prevented me from giving another star to this movie is that, it felt too short. Then again, maybe it was because of the feast of endless rampage and destruction I was served throughout this movie.",1059609600,2,1620,4.851985559566787
1476099,2,B00005JM0B,"Well, Well, Well, where do I start? I completely love the first and expecially the second Terminator movie. Sadly the third incarnation is a complete joke. The film completely fails to reel me in. The acting, humor, dialogue, and some actors are inadequate and simplistic. The plot is, basically, nearly the same as T2 and the music does not add momentum to the scenes. By the way, The machines must realize that going back in time will not change the future outcome simply because the time travel events are a direct result of the future events and they cannot be altered (it is a paradox). Overall: BAD.",1059523200,,605,4.663551401869159
1476100,4,B00005JM0B,"I would rate my movie-going experience with T3 at about 3.5 stars so I gave 4 to be close. I was hoping to see the battle of the machines vs. the humans in 2029, with the matured John Connor organizing resistance, fighting the machines and sabotaging their plans by sending back a T-800. This was not the case. However, the potential is still (and most likely) there when T4 is produced.

There are some good action scenes, a few new twists, and a bit of the tongue-in-cheek humor of T2. I believe they attempted to recreate the romantic tension between Kyle Reese and Sarah Connor from T1 with John Connor and another young lady (Claire Danes) but the chemistry just wasn't there. I think I would have been more comfortable with Edward Furlong brought back as John Connor and the age would be about right. They could have even brought in Nikki Cox to play the (human) female, since she was so young in T2 (they could have used this in the plot since Nikki's character in T2 knew John Connor and sent the T-1000 to the Galleria - this would have required only a minor rewrite in T3). Nikki Cox's character in T2 was only about 3 years younger than John Connor. Oh well, they didn't consult with me first! LOL

The female Terminator, was quite attractive and coldly played. However, she quickly pulls a couple of very public stunts that would draw attention to herself immediately upon arrival. In T1 and T2, the assassination robots (awkwardly at some times, smoothly at others) attempted to ""blend-in"" to reach their targets by stealth. Of course, some will argue that the T-800 acquiring a motorcycle in T2 wasn't all that subtle either (I agree! but at least it was amusing).  Of course she needs a particular tool to accomplish her immediate tasks and these stunts facilitate the acquisition.

T1 and T2 are hard acts to follow. I enjoyed this film but wanted more. And I have no doubt more is coming (without spoiling it for you) based upon the plot twists. There are some unexpected surprises and attempts to introduce some of the future machine's mechanical ancestors. There was, however, a bit of an unwanted ""Robocop"" feel in some parts, but perhaps, again, they were trying to show some early versions of the machines we saw in T1.

T1 and T2 purists (like myself, for the most part) will likely be disappointed in the film. If T4 returns to proper form, I think many will find there can be a place for this film in a boxed set. But T4 is going to build on this film, there can be no doubt. I think many of us feel the execution could have been better. I won't mention the myriad reasons which have already been stated.

I'll end with this. T1 and T2 purists: I suggest you wait until you get it on DVD. Those who enjoy action films without being as picky as some of us (hehe) will have a good time at the film.  I've seen the movie 3 times now and I'm liking it better with the repeated viewings.

T3 Error: John Connor and Kate must pilot a private plane to another location. The plane, a Cessna 172-type aircraft, is N3035C at the hangar. On the flight, a different or renumbered plane is used which was N3973F.  Sure enough, when the plane lands, it is the N3035C plane arriving.  Oops!!!

1476101,3,B00005JM0B,"Since I haven't seen the previous two ""Terminator"" films, watching TERMINATOR 3 was like coming into a movie already half over. I'm sure I've missed something. However, ignorance hasn't stopped me before from being rashly opinionated.
The gist of the ongoing series is that machines and humans will be at war with each other in the near future, at which time beleaguered Mankind is to be led by John Connor and his wife, the former Kate Brewster. In the ""now"" of this film, machines are about to launch a nuclear first strike against humanity using America's computerized and newly automated national defense system. The good news is that Arnold Schwarzenegger is the Terminator robot sent back in time to ensure that Connor (Nick Stahl) and Brewster (Claire Danes) survive the coming Armageddon to fight on. The bad news is that a more advanced Terminator robot, the T-X (Kristanna Loken), is sent back by the other side to eliminate the same Connor and Brewster. All the action revolves around the collision between the two hard-nosed androids.
At the risk of throwing a wet blanket of logic on the storyline, wouldn't a Nuclear Winter visited upon the planet by vengeful machines also destroy the very technology and industrial infrastructure capable of creating the advanced robots supposed to carry the battle into the future? Never mind; this is a Tinseltown fairy tale.
The two best reasons to see TERMINATOR 3 are Arnie, of course, who delivers some straight-faced gag lines that'll leave you chortling, and one of the best vehicle chases I've seen recently. The latter ostensibly takes place in Los Angeles, and, if not accomplished with models and computer generated FX, left me surprised that the city is still standing. Otherwise, the special FX technology used to depict the warring robots is pretty much old hat to those of us getting jaded.
The Connor and Brewster characters left me completely cold. As a matter of fact, they were both so annoying that I hoped in the depths of my perverse heart that the T-X would manage to slaughter them both. I mean, do we really need them for a TERMINATOR 4?
Loken's T-X might just as well have been a high-tech wind-up doll, though she was impressively poker-faced and relentless in pursuit of her programmed objective. The scene where ""she"" gets stuck to a giant magnet was inspired. And the one-on-one fight scenes with Arnie were so violent that I thought they'd make the perfect 21st century version of the Bickersons.",1059436800,,2477,4.914081145584726
1476102,2,B00005JM0B,"It had to happen sooner or later: Another Terminator movie. It took 12 years to get it made, but after having seen it, I must say that it was not worth the wait. The first film was a masterpiece of modern cinema, T2 was disappointing, but this latest entry in the series is quite simply a travesty. Here are the main problems:
1) At the end of T2, we were led to believe that Judgement Day had been averted. Now in T3, we are told that it was just postponed. Why is that? The explanation offered in the movie is very thin and it is difficult to follow the logic (think about it).
2) Nick Stahl was a poor choice for the John Conner role. Clearly, it should have gone to Edward Furlong again.
3) Too much comedy. All those stupid one-liners ruined the first half of the film. And as for that male stripper....
4) No Linda Hamilton as Sarah Conner. Claire Danes' character was a poor substitute as female hero.
5) Finally, the whole movie was obviously just an attempt to relauch the series, since the ending made it pretty obvious that there will be a T4.
Let's hope that Arnie will be elected govenour, so this series can be put out of its misery (although it is possible that they will make another one without him).",1059350400,,1217,4.318777292576419
1476103,2,B00005JM0B,"When I heard that James Cameron is not the guy behind the camera that direct the third sequel of the Terminator, I've already felt a heavy doubt to watch the third sequel.  This doubt was then uplifted when I found that Jonathan Mostow is going to be the person in charge for the challenging position of directing a third sequel of the Terminator series.  Mostow is an excellent director when it comes to action movies, considering his excellent work in Breakdown and U-571.  As such I choose to take a chance and see it...
As it turns out..it's a great disappointment.  This is not a Terminator movie...some viewers considered it ok as a b-flick pop-corn movie.  Well, it's difficult for me because what I want to see is a Terminator movie...not just some b-flick pop-corn movie.
Mostow is a great director when it comes to action sequence.  But the Terminator is not just about great action sequence...it's about good thrilling story that grip the audience, it's about a nightmarish vision when something indestructible wanted to destroy you, it's about amazing effect.  From a directing point of view, Mostow lack the ability to create the charisma of the Terminator robot.  I remember that in Cameron's previous sequels, we are gripped every time the Terminator robot, or even the futuristic skynet robot, comes in view.  Scary aura somehow follows it and we just have this feeling like saying ""Oh my God"".  Try to compare the scene where the Terminators appears between Mostow's Terminator with Cameron's.
One good example, the scene of the future Skynet robots.  In part 2, there is this opening scene, where a man's skull, after a moment of close up in a very quiet situation (just the sound of the wind), was suddenly crushed by a feet of a skynet robot...all done in a close up.  Then the camera slowly goes up and catch the view of the face of the robot.  I don't know, but it really haunting.  Mostow tries to create the same mood, where a bunch of skull scattered on a base of a river, was then follow with shot of the skynet robots blasting their ray guns everywhere, and then camera stand still on one of the robot who stares back at the camera.  Not bad, but...well, comparatively speaking, it becomes nothing compare to the previous scene I've mentioned. And then there is this cold terminator character...Mostow didn't do a good enough job in maintaining the coldness of the Terminator robot.  There are some moments...well, many moments, especially from Arnold's side, where the Terminator gave a `much too alive' impression (Arnold's eye bulging bigger when he said `Judgement day is inevitable' to John Connor...talking about trying to make an impression).
Sadly, the only thing that Mostow done perfectly here, is the first chasing sequence, which remind me a lot of Breakdown.  Actually, for me, it's the only exciting action sequence in the movie.  Even the fighting scene between the two terminator was very lacked...there are more that can be done just making two robot throwing each other and destroying walls, or lavatory walls for this matter (which actually, is a sad attempt in elevating the scene in part two where Arnold and Robert Patrick wrestle each other and then destroying every wall that collided with their body)
As for the script...it's cheesy, full of stupid remarks, although I agree with the conclusion (I'm not going to spoil it).  Too many attempts to make a memorable remarks by Arnold, like ""John Connor....it's time"" .
The special effect, it's good enough.  But then...good enough is not a standard for a movie with a caliber of Terminator. Oh well, so much for a Terminator sequence.",1059350400,2,3633,4.8573743922204216
1476154,5,B00005JM0B,"Well, T3 is by far the best Action/Sci-fi movie of 2003. I think T3 couldn't get any better than what it had of plot and casting crews. I just watched T3 in one of Kuwait's biggest cinemas and in the last eight hours I couldn't take off the image from my mind of the movie and the message its trying to deliver to the viewers. I read many reviews that critisized T3 and said it failed and wasn't as good as T1 and T2, well i think there's something wrong in those people's minds, they think that T3 could get better in plot and directing and acting, i think not, ya'll go and judge yourselves and see what's wrong with your mental brain. T3 has more action sequences than T1 and T2 but what the weak point was John Conner (The guy who played Conner in the movie) was somehow weak in acting performance. Arnold is my best actor in years and in all Terminators he delivered the message very easily to the viewers mind but his performance in T3 wasn't the same as in T1 and T2 (Age played a role) his accent wasn't that scary as in T1 and T2. Arnold failed in many of his recent releases of the late 1990's mostly the ones after the year 1996 movies such as: Jingle All the Way, Batman & Robin, End of Days, and The 6th Day. In those 5 movies, Arnold [ ] with his role and plot of the movies wasn't that good or strong as T3 and his previous movies in his Golden years in the early 1990's and in 1980's. Well, Eraser wasn't that bad was it? it was lacking a bit of storylines to make it a top notch. Collateral Damage was amazing after he failed in his last 5 to 6 movies and Collateral Damage brought him back to the years of action that he was known in. In T3 he gave himself a Golden Oscar whether Holywood or Movie Critics liked it or not. Arnold returned to his golden years when he performed in T1 and T2. This movie is by all means one of the best movies in 2003 and I bet who said it could be any better if they added this and that to direct or produce that movie by himself? Contained Lots of Action no other movie had, even The Matrix Reloaded couldn't get near it. I appreciate The Matrix Reloaded, but sorry baby Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines grinds 'em all. I Will buy it on DVD when it get released i couldn't wait to watch it again and again. By the way, The terminatrix played a good role in the movie but she was a hot chick with bad attitude i think so. GO ARNOLD YOU ROCK, ARNOLD FOR THE GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA, Yeah BABY...

1476155,5,B00005JM0B,"Don't doubt it for a minute:  ""Terminator 3"" lives up to its pedigree.  Whether or not it's as good or better than its predecessors, ""Rise of the Machines"" stands perfectly well on its own merits.  Schwarzenegger is his unimitable self, reprising the heroic role he assumed for T2 with an obvious gusto that shines undimmed through his killer cyborg's facade.  Nick Stahl is convincing as the enigmatic John Connor, and Claire Danes is appealing as his unexpected soul mate (aren't they always?).  And of course there's Kristanna Loken, the ice-cold Terminatrix who gives Schwarzenegger all he can handle, and then some.  The stunts are spectacular, the action literally non-stop, and the tone eerie and somber despite all the truly glorious comic relief.  No, this is not a James Cameron film, but that's not all bad. It *IS* a Schwarzenegger film, and a damn good one. But behind all its action and adrenaline, ""Terminator 3"" does have a brain, and is arguably more thoughtful than either of the previous chapters. Is Judgment Day inevitable?  Is there no fate but what we make, or is Destiny immutable?  Only time--and the next Terminator--will tell.",1059264000,,1153,4.994764397905759

1476157,4,B00005JM0B,"At first I thought this would be a cheap cash-in movie. Then a friend of mine saw it and liked it and if he likes it, it has to have some merit. The whole idea of ""there is no fate, but that which we make"" line goes out the window. We come to find out that John Connor is destined to lead the humans, no matter what he does. I liked all the refrences from the first and second, like the sun glasses, keys over the sun visor, ""I'll be back"" lines.... even the ending was a take off of the ending of the first movie.
Loken, who plays the TX does a good job of being stiff and mechinal through out the movie no matter what happens to her.
The only problems I have are 1.) The time scale. From the first one to the second, John should be about 9. From the second to the third he should be about 20. 2.) The plot is the same from the second, excpt for the ending, albet with fewer morphing shots. But I'm willing to over look this, what else can they do??? 3.) When the TX ""takes over"" a few cars to chase Connor down, I don't know about you but most cars today are not steer-by-wire. There are mechinal linkages with the steering wheel, gas petal... you can not control these electronicaly. The TX could do the electric system of the cars, but that's it. And 4.) I don't think the crane in the chase sceen could go that fast. Other than that I'm willing to suspend my disbelief.",1059091200,,1374,4.07380073800738
1476158,2,B00005JM0B,"""T3"" proves you can spend millions on a movie, but it's wasted if you don't have a good script and a good director.  Jonathan Mostow surprised us all with his neat little action-thriller ""Breakdown"", dented our confidence with the tedious ""U-571"", and has lost it completely with ""T3"".  To be fair, he's been hamstrung by a pitiful screenplay by John Brancato and Michael Ferris which had me remembering that while they did pen David Fincher's notable ""The Game"", they also wrote the abysmal ""The Net"".  ""T3"" is much like the latter: a neat concept dissipated by paper-thin characters, transparent plotting, and a lazy deus-ex-machina to save the day (""There's my Dad's plane!  I trained in it!"")  Like its predecessors, ""T3"" is made on an epic scale and budget, but gone is the epic quality and the wonderful mythic tone.  It plays like a Hardy Boys Mystery with Claire Danes as Nancy Drew.  It's distinguished only by the extent to which it self-consciously redeploys shots, dialogue and sometimes entire sequences from the previous films, occasionally to good effect but more often in unintended self-parody.  There's also a rather bad attempt at a kind of Oedipal subtext -""You're the closest thing I ever had to a father""; ""You remind me of my mother"" - but it ends up playing more like ""Star Wars"" with Arnie as a latter day Darth (lifting John by the throat; wrestling with his ""conscience""; being more machine than man).  Admittedly, these 95 minutes of high-octane, cringe-inducing dross are bookended with two very nice sequences: the opening setup which explains how John Connor lives now, and a surprisingly restrained climax which is low-key, thoughtful and all the more chilling for it.  But in the end, for all the money, hype and apocalyptic storyline potential, ""T3"" just felt like a telemovie.  Come back, James Cameron (and bring Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong with you).  All is forgiven.  Yes, even that Oscar speech.  Yes, even ""Titanic"".  You may not be the king of the world, but you're a damn fine writer/director.  We miss you.",1059091200,,2056,4.933139534883721
1476159,3,B00005JM0B,"""Not bad, but inferior to the previuos ones.""  That's what I thought after watching ""T3: Rise of the Machines.""  Jonathan Mostow did a very good job, but not as good as James Cameron.  Many people say many things about Cameron, but one thing is clear; he insists on his own vision.
That is sadly missing in this so-so sequel.  The story is basically the same as ""T2"": another super-robot is sent from the future to kill John Conner, who is supposed to be the savior of the world after the coming war between machines and humans, and another robot in the shape of Arnold Schwarznegger is also sent to protect him.  This time, however, things are a bit different, the film wants to say.
You can find no Cameron's signature -- no Linda Hamilton (that's a big minus); no unique idea like liquid-type super-killer of Robert Patrick, or no Edward Furlong.  Think about this, you know, these people all get famous after appearing in this series, and that's the proof that Cameron, who might be a director demanding too much, is good at inducing the actors to give 100% potentials.  And of course, Arnie, who became an instant star with ""I""ll be back.""
But Jonathan Mostow fails on this score; compared to Hamilton and Furlong, Nick Stahl and Claire Danes are playing unimpressive characters, not credible as the hero and the heroine we can relate to.  Maybe I am too harsh, considering the fact that they replaced other players on short notice.  Anyway, all people should agree that they should not meet each otehr THAT way (no future hero should be kept up in that place like a dog.)  And about the new-comer Ms Loken as the new-type terminator, I thought she (it) doesn't look strong at all, giving too many gimmicks.  The filmmakers should have known that only one kind of weapon will do for truely strong heroes and villains (see the previous Terminators and all the characters in ""X-Men"").
The actions themselvs are exciting, I can tell you, but you have to wait for it to hit the screen.  The film constantly shows something engaging, and the director, he says in an interview, intentionally keeps the running time within 2 hours.  Surely the film is action-packed.
This is a kind of a film producer Mario Kassar did in the 90s -- like ""Universal Soldiers"" -- no logics, good actions, and plenty of humor thrown in the plot.  The only difference is, I again say, no James Cameron.  If you still wondering whether you should watch it or not, think about this point first.",1059091200,,2469,4.64367816091954
1476160,3,B00005JM0B,"I didn't expect much after viewing the sneak preview but I thought I owed it to the Terminator series to go and watch it.
T3 plays the same identical story, TX here to kill John Connor, Arnold here to save him. His mother is switched with his future wife. Everything is the same, the way the Cyborgs enter the stage, the way the bad cyborg goes around and kills a bunch of people before finding Connor. The way the bad T-X finds Connor first but Arnold comes just in time to rescue him. There is no new rise of any machines... the scenes of robots taking over the world in the sneak preview were just dreams of Connors.
Meanwhile, back at cyborg enterprise, It seems hollywood didn't fall to the rise of the machines, cause T-1000 is replaced with a chick. A chick who better belongs to some fab three RnB creation. She is so inferior to our beloved T-1000. Why in the world would Cyborg Enterprise replace a liquid metal cyborg with a 1/2 liquid metal cyborg. She has this multi-purpose tool kit hand which is so 70's. Arnold kicked her butt every time, there was never any danger of him failing. And yes... just like T2, the final scene has Arnold crushed by the big bad cyborg, his red sight switches off. But once again he awakes.... shakes off his newly encrypted virus and continues with a limp. T-X is one of the worst evil characters ever to be created.
The movie itself, lacks any character detail apart from Arnold's stand up comedy routine. There is no time to slow down and absorb anything. Everything just keeps exploding around them. I was getting a headache! Whilst Terminator 3 had more explosions T2 seemed to cover more field, with scenes that expanded many locations.
It is only until the very end of this movie that it becomes very interesting. The failure to stop Skynet whilst described as a plot twist by some, is actually an inevitable conclusion, which without would mean T1 and T2 could not really exist. It is inevitable for the robots to rise because otherwise there would have never been any conflict to begin with. My initial concern though obvious, might not have been for Hollywood, but thankfully someone does pay attention to some detail. (Im not going to go into detail about why the terminator series is actually one big flaw). I liked this 'we didn't make it' ending, its fresh. And Just when I stopped yawning, 118min into the movie, the closing credits come on. Darn! This movie should have started from here.

I'll NEVER forget the incredible crane and bathroom-fight sequences. WOW! You can really see where the $170M was spent. (Too bad they probably won't make it back domestically.)  Kristanna is no Robert Patrick but she brings freshness and sexiness to the role.  It's a pity that most critics didn't understand the gender ironies/politics displayed in this film (e.g. T-X got smashed by a male urinal and her head didn't move an inch).I saw this film 3 times already and will again if it comes to IMAX like Star Wars II and Matrix Reloaded.",1059004800,,708,4.685483870967742

Good points:
The story line is strong, and interesting.
It explains fully how and why this could happen, even after T2.
The acting is excellent.
The action sequences are very well done.
There is no Sarah Connor in it. ;-) (She was fine in T1, but in T2 she makes me wanna gag. :p)
Bad points:
It's a lot like the other two movies (well, duhhhhh - it's following the same story line, naturally it's going to be similiar).
John Connor's part is played well, but he, physically, doesn't fit the role as well as others might have.
A LOT of time is spent on a huge chase scene, rather than progressing the plot and furthering the story.
In closing, if you enjoyed either of the two previous Terminator movies, you'll enjoy this one; if Terminator movies ""just aren't your thing"", don't waste your time - because this won't be 'your thing', either.

1476245,5,B00005JM0B,"Now this is a REAL summer blockbuster. I don't even have to see another big budget summer movie to know that nothing will be able to top this impressive thrill ride. T2 and T3 are hands down the two best action movies I've ever seen. I expected a good time from this third entry, but I didn't expect it to quite live up to T2, however, it turned out to be a very worthy sequel. Fun from beginning to end. With as much fun as I was having, I never got the chance to get bored. The time flew right by and the movie actually seemed short. In an action movie, you really can't ask for much more. This one delivers the goods. It's not some ""brilliant"" film, but it's not a mindless music video like xXx either. In fact, it actually does have a pretty solid story, which is amazing considering it's pretty much non-stop action. I just can't get over how fun this movie is. It's a BLAST! Fun, Fun, Fun, and more FUN! There's also quite a few laughs to be found. Whenever Arnold opened his mouth I would laugh. Simple things like ""Get out,"" ""I'll drive,"" and ""She'll be back"" became downright funny coming from him. The part with him going into the bar during ladies night in the beginning was great, very funny.
Arnold Schwarzenegger is in top form here. He doesn't look like he's aged a bit since T2. He plays the part again here just as well as he ever did. Newcomer Kristanna Loken delivers a truly kickass performance as the female terminator. She was a lot of fun to watch, sexy and completely ruthless. When we are first introduced to her T-X character, I jokingly whispered to my buddy ""look, it's Shakira."" She really does almost look like her at first. Her ""breast trick"" was pretty funny. I see a ""Best Villain"" nomination (and most likely win) at the MTV Movie Awards in her future. I usually can't stand Nick Stahl, but he was surprisingly really good here, and never bothered me once. It was also really nice to see Claire Danes again. She doesn't do too many movies anymore. She was pretty much excellent as Kate. Her character was likable and believable.
This is a ""CAN'T MISS"" for any action fans. I can't picture someone hating it. It's just incredibly fun for everyone. The large amount of money put into the budget was really put to good use. The action and effects were awesome. I'm sick of a lot of the boring and generic action scenes we normally see in action movies, but the action here was a real treat. It was truly exciting to witness. At one time during the movie I thought ""Man, I can't imagine anyone actually being at The Hulk when this is playing.""
Before seeing it, I predicted I would like this one more than the first, but not as much as the second. Well, I was dead-on, that's exactly what happened. Although my buddy said he actually thought this one was the best of all three.
I've heard a lot of complaints about the ending, but I wasn't that bothered by it. I didn't LOVE it, yet I didn't HATE it. I think I'd probably have to agree with my friend, it kind of made the movie better. It was just a little surprising and made me NEED a T4 NOW.
Anyone looking for a GREAT time should do themselves a favor and see this. It deserves every penny it gets and deserves to be a big hit. It's just too much fun! If you want to see a summer movie that truly delivers, this IS it. Don't miss this baby! I can't wait to add the DVD to my collection.

James Cameron is no where in sight in this follow up, and is replace with Jonathan Mostow, whose films Breakdown and 'U-571'were tepid at best. Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as The Terminator who returns to protect an adult John Conner from an advance model-killing machine called the T-X played by Kristanna Loken. Every thing that was set up before in Terminator 2 is throng out for the sake of another sequel, and the story is not only incoherent but also down right annoying in certain parts of the film.  The T-X is not as advance as the T-1000 from Terminator 2, and not as menacing. You were actually scared of The T-1000, and it gave you a reason to be scared by the way that it could kill at will. The T-X is just poor carbon copy of the T-1000, and not as efficient of a killing machine. The story should have been better and should have been a great continuation of the second movie but in it's journey to be different, it forgot what it should have been.

One to destroy the leader of the resistance, and of course the other to protect the primary target John Connor. Is the world to be saved? Or is the end of mankind inevitable? Arnold, the T101, now an obsulete design, goes head to head with a more forminable opponent, The TX, a far more effective killing machine. Played by the beautiful Kristina Loken. Terminator 3 delivers a great script, with action sequences that will blow you away, with a dash of humor that will make you giggle from time to time.

1476330,5,B00005JM0B,"I think I enjoyed this primarily because it was different to the first two Terminator movies. Sure, the plot was the same. Killer robot gets sent back in time to assassinate the leader of the human resistance, and another killer robot is sent back to protect him.
The difference with this movie, though, is that the one sent back to do the protecting at no time gets sentimental, warm and fuzzy, or lovey dovey. There is the distinct impression, throughout the entire film, that this particular T-101 terminator could just as easily turn around and snap Connor's neck as take a bullet for him.
There are plenty of one-liners to be had, some corny and some not. The scene at the start where Arnie acquires his clothing is totally hysterical. There are definitely places in this film where you can't help thinking that the director and the actors just weren't taking it, or themselves, seriously. Rest assured this is not to the movie's detriment. The humour only helps relieve the tension that might otherwise have turned the film in an unbearable mind job.
Kristanna Loken more than does the job as the new and improved Terminator, sent back to [destroy]not only Connor, but also men and women who will become his deputies. She gives a good impression of a machine with sole intent, but who can't quite help enjoying itself in the process.
The demolition scenes that result from the two Terminators battling are spectacular, and there is one hell of a hair-raising car chase through the city (I wouldn't go so far as to say it meets the standards of the car chase in Matrix Reloaded, but it is mind-blowing to watch).
Despite what local reviewers have said, I think Nick Stahl and Claire Danes were a good pair-up for this film. It doesn't detract at all from not having Edward Furlong reprising the role of John Connor.
Nick Stahl was perfect in his role. People have to remember that what we are being presented with is a young man who thinks (but isn't positive) that his destiny as leader in the war against the machines has been thwarted by the actions he, his mother and his Terminator protector took some years ago. This is a young man who is now uncertain of his future role, but still suffers nightmarish visions of what the world was supposed to become.
This is not yet the battle-hardened warrior that is depicted in the 'flash-forwards' of all three movies. This is just a young man who wants to stay anonymous, and untraceable.
Hence, he is hardly surprised when a Terminator appears abruptly one night, saying it is there to protect him. The surprises start coming with the Terminator's determination to also protect former once-off kissing companion Kate Brewster....
Someone criticised the lack of chemistry between Danes and Stahl. They were well off the mark with that criticism, because the film was not meant to focus on any serious romantic attachments. Stahl and Danes didn't need to 'click' like that right then. Should there be a fourth film (and I seriously hope there is after seeing T3), then that will be something that they might need to focus on then. ...",1058659200,,3085,4.736059479553903

1476332,4,B00005JM0B,"I am not going to be like everyone and write about how James Cameron did not do this movie. Who cares, he is not GOD.
I do not understand the designations for the Terminator. In T1, he was a Cyberdine systems model 101. No mention of T-800.
In T2, he was once again a Cyberdine systems model 101. No mention in the movie about being a T-800. Not until I saw the teaser trailer years later did I realise it was a T-800 model 101.
In T3, Arnie refers to his previous incarnation as a T-101. In reviews, he is called the T-850.
This is so confusing.
T2 was based in 1994, despite being filmed in 1991. John could not have been any older than 10 years, possibly on 9. There were references to the war being in 3 years, which counting back from 1997 would make 1994. He was not 13 years, despite the narration in T3 indicating he was that age.
If the war didn't happen in 1997, Kyle Reese would have his normal childhood, but what is stopping him from being caught in the nuclear war? The odds of him taking cover on both days of the war would be against him. If he did not survive the war, the whole space-time continuim would be ruined.
T3 can leave your mind wandering for days afterwards as to the glitches in the story.... but isn't the whole point of a movie to get you thinking about it, going back and watching it again. Not many movies blow my mind these days. This one did.",1058659200,,1378,4.184210526315789

But Nick looks more like Michael Biehn (father from T1) so that was an advantage.  Kristanna Loken was extremely well cast as the Terminatrix, but she just couldn't be as fearsome as Robert Patrick (T-1000 from T2).  But I don't think anyone could've played it better.

1476396,3,B00005JM0B,"Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator role is unquestionably the role that put him on the map, and this third installment has been a long time coming (12 years after part 2). Is it as good as the pervious 2 movies? Right off the bat, I will say no. While most action fans will love the overlong chase sequences and fights, diehard fans of the original will see this as a letdown.
Apparently, the end of the second movie was wrong. Judgement Day was not stopped, it was merely postponed. John Connor (Nick Stahl) is once again confronted with the future when a female terminator (a very sexy female terminator) is sent back to kill him, since he is to become the future resistance leader, and his future lieutenant, Kate Brewster (Claire Danes). The new female terminator, the T-X, is stronger, faster, and miles more advanced than the T-1000 from Terminator 2. True to form, Arnie returns as the original T-100 terminator (a different model, though)  to protect these two, who are important to the survival of the human race.
While the ideas put forth on paper are good, they seem insubstantial in the execution. The first two movies balanced action with a solid storyline, while the third seems like a by-the-numbers action movie with a story added in for effect. It  doesn't have the same look, feel, or emotional impact of the first two movies. Arnold is heavy on the one-liners here, but his performance lacks any substance, and comes across as wooden and annoyingly heavy on the self-parody.
Terminator 3 is not a bad movie, in fact there were many elements that I quite liked. But as a Terminator movie, it fails, if for no other reason is because it had a lot to live up to after Terminator 2. The secret to appreciating Terminator 3 is to lower your expectations, and no go into it thinking of the previous movies.",1058400000,2,1819,4.68125

  Terminator 3's big ""draw""? A female terminator! (Whoopee..) She blows up stuff real good, can inflate her cha-cha's and can make cars drive themselves by taking over their cruise control systems. This movie's writers should have tried activatating their car's cruise control and letting go of the wheel: Presto -no more bad scripts.
  As I was watching this tribute to destruction, I kept asking myself ""Wouldn't the terminators cause a Moebius Strip?"", an endless loop in time: Kid grows up into Terminator controlled world-->sends Terminator to past-->Terminator saves kid in past-->kid grows up into......

I will not summarize the plot since everyone else has but will just say SEE THE MOVIE! Great action....excellent chase scenes....fulfills all of your expectations for a Terminator movie.
Yay!",1058313600,,309,4.43859649122807
1476401,3,B00005JM0B,"I don't know how much I can say about why I didn't like this movie without giving away much of the plot. I will say this, I was very excited to see this movie and was very disapointed from the very beginning.
The plot is simple, cause it was already done. A terminator is sent back from the future to kill John Connor. Another terminator is sent back to protect him. Sound familiar? That part I could have dealt with. Sure it's been done, but with the advances in technology, this could have worked.
The following gives away key plot information, so do not read on if you don't want to know what happens!
When T2 came out, when they showed that the reason T2 happened is because pieces of the original terminator were found in the factory but that was covered up, that plot made sense. And it was predicted that the premise for T3 was the part of his arm that arnold left in the big gear in the steel factory at the end. They destroyed everything but that one piece, leaving them an opening for T3.
But then in T3 they basically say that T2 was never even necessary! John supposedly met this chick the day before the second terminator arrived and they were supposed to get together then but that was all disrupted by the appearance of the second terminator. This was stupid.
Secondly, in T3 it was emphasized time and time again that the arnold terminator in T3 was NOT the same as the arnold terminator in T2. Even John Connor in T3 says he ""you mean I got to teach you everything over again?"" From the opening scene where arnold looks in the visor for the keys to the truck he steals, to where he comes out of the cemetary and shoots a million rounds of ammo but doesn't kill anybody. These were things that john had to teach him in T2, but in T3 he knew these things already? And how was he to learn anything anyways? In T2 they had to remove his CPU and switch it from read-only in order for him to learn. They didn't do this in T3.
Point #3. You find out your fiancee is dead and you get over that in less than 5 minutes? Come on.
And what was the deal with the sunglasses? In T1 arnold needed the gargoyle sunglasses to cover his eye which he had to operate on because it was damaged by a shotgun blast. When arnold grabbed the sunglasses out of the barkeeps pocket in T2, it was a stetch, but it fit so it was ok. But what the hell was his fascination with the shades in T3? They really served no purpose. Was this to just make fun of the first two movies? Who knows. There's a lot of who knows in this movie.
If arnold tells him that he is killed in the future, then wouldn't john do something different to not get killed? And then if he did do something different, then would arnold come back and still tell him he gets killed? A temporal paradox. The movie is loaded with those also.
T1, and T2, for the most part, to any reasonable person, came to an ending, a conclusion, the movie was over. What the heck is the deal with the ...ending to this movie? I got to thinking to myslef, was the whole point of T3 just to set up for T4 and beyond?
The whole message from T1 and T2 is that the future is not set. That it can be changed. There is no future but the one you make for yourself. But the whole message of T3 is that you can NOT change the future, only delay it. Kind of depressing message ain't it and completely contradictory to the first two films, the GOOD films. You know, the 2 films that [weren't bad].
I really wish I would have waited and rented this. Yes, the film had lots and lots of explosions, and crashes and all that nice blow 'em up stuff you might enjoy. But the one thing, the most important thing, the STORY, is lost.
and by the way, where was the family who owned the motor home that they stole anyways? They just pull up and drive away with it and nobody is around? Maybe I missed that part.
At least with lord of the rings part 2, and matrix part 2, stars wars 2 (the empire strikes back) and even the back to the future part 2, they told you up front that there would be another movie, that they were just part of the story. There was never any indication that T3 would just leave you hanging. But it did, and in a VERY VERY BAD way.
The only reason I gave this film 3 stars was because of the action and destruction. If that would have been lacking, then it for sure deserved no more than a 2 for the story alone.",1058313600,4,4352,4.1453900709219855
1476402,4,B00005JM0B,"The Terminator films serve as the next evolution in the debate mankind has waged ever since the myth of Prometheus.  Technologys good and evil status has haunted and perplexed us from the moment we stepped out of the caves. In the Terminator films, technology, given too much power, sends us all back into the darkened primordial soup.
Human fate is what we make it is of the great themes present in TERMINATOR 3: THE RISE OF THE MACHINES. The hope we are ultimately in control of our fate and our technology is one of the underpinning messages making the violent and seemingly nihilistic fantasies of the Terminator film saga work.
Granted this third helping of Arnold wrecking things reminds us that the novelty of the new has long worn off this brilliant and durable franchise. This is really a small nitpick for the third installment delivers the promised thrills, blazing guns and honest heartfelt humanity. TERMINATOR 3 also bravely allows itself to go into DR. STRANGELOVE territory with a downbeat ending that brazenly bucks Hollywood trends while simultaneously setting the audience up for another sequel.
Such is the great paradox of the Terminator saga. While these films have pushed the technology of filmmaking to new extremes, pallid imitators have forgotten the humanity at the core of narrative. Technology, as any proud Luddite can tell you, is a Pandoras Box. Just remember at the bottom of the box lies the hope that mankind is wise enough not sacrifice itself at the throne of convenience and awe.",1058227200,4,1517,4.949019607843137
1476403,4,B00005JM0B,"So Cameron didn't direct it and Linda Hamilton or Eddie Furlong weren't in it.  But guess what people?  You don't need two out of those three things.  Because even though James Cameron didn't sign on, the movie was still just as good.  Although it would have been nice to at least see a Linda flashback.  And as for Eddie, well lets face it, almost anyone could have played an older John Conner.  The only thing I really missed was the old music from the Termiator movies, you know ""dunu du dunu... dunu du dunu"".  But as long as they didn't replace Schwarzenegger with Van Damn, I was happy.  So here's how the story starts off;  You got little Johnny Conner giving the narration for a few minutes and he explains what's gonna happen to us in the future (like we don't already know).  Then we see the new terminator (the TX, some hot chick) and the old Terminator (Schwarzenegger) beam up out of thin air.  The TX immediately goes on a killing spree taking out no-bodies on the street (or so we think at first) after getting some new threads.  While the old terminator gets his new cloths from a male strip club (the guy was gonna take them off anyway).  We then go back to John stealing pain killers from a veterinarian hospital.  He can't go to a real hospital because he lives his life off the grid (no credit cards, no social security number, no identity).  An old junior high friend of his that he made out with once (Claire Danes) works at the vet hospital and she ends up getting kidnapped with Conner after the two machines find them and each other and duke it out for a little bit.  From there it's an all out chase involving a Pick-Up truck, a crane truck, a Fire truck, a police motorcycle, two cop cars and an ambulance which have no drivers.  Our new bad terminator not only has the same powers as our old bad terminator (Robert Patrick, T2) but she can also turn her arm into weapons (plasma gun, flame thrower, etc.) and she can also control other machines with the flck of her finger (no really, but kinda yeah).  From the big chase to a cemetary (where ""someone speacial"" is buried) to pick up an arsenal of weapons hidden inside a coffin (big shoot em up scene), and then to see Danes characters father.  Her father is in charge of the whole Skynet program so he decides if it should be used or not (so we all know who to blame when the bombs drop) to get rid of a computer virus infecting half (or all, I can't remember) the worlds computers.  As the new terminator shows up at dads job to reak havoc, our heros show up just in the nick of time to slow her down.  But not before dear old dad presses the go button on Skynet (nice work pops).  As soon as he presses the go button the machines all around them start killing people and all hell breaks loose.  Conner and Danes character (can't remember the name) find out how to stop Skynet once and for all from dad as the heavy weights go at each other.  The TX knocks out Schwarzenegger and then reprograms him to get rid of John Conner for her.  Does he pull it off?  Does he go against his orders to protect John Conner no matter what?  I'm not saying.  That's all I'm giving you for this film because I want you to go out and see it for yourself.  THERE WILL BE NO SPOILERS IN MY REVIEW (at least no big ones).  So the movie was great, the cast did a pretty good job, the effects were pretty amazing and you didn't need James Cameron for all you people out there crying because he didn't get on board the T3 express.  Could he have done a better job directing?  Maybe maybe not, we'll never know.  The only reason I gave the movie four stars was because there wasn't alot of gore in it, not like the last two Terminator movies.  In the last movie you see the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) slicing and dicing everyone he comes across.  You see contact, blood, painful expressions on peoples faces, the splater when a bullet hits someone.  In this movie you only get that once, maybe twice.  And the girl playing the TX had a little to much emotion.  She wasn't singing ""Put on a happy face"" while dancing down the street but she did have kind of a smile in what she did.  But I guess you gotta love your work.",1058227200,3,4175,4.283524904214559

1476470,5,B00005JM0B,"After having to sit thru the pile of crud that was ""XXX"" recently, I have to say how nice it was to finally see a real action movie. This is how you do it. Arnold may be getting older, but he can still show the young 'uns what an action film is. Are you listening Mr. Diesel?. The plots to these films are filled with techno gizmo and all that kind of stuff, so it hardly matters what exactly the movie is about. After all, it all comes down to the action and the special effects. This one has got it all. The first two films in the series were classics in the genre. It's tough telling how this one will rank in the series with die hard fans, but I am here to tell you that this is one fun ride. So, how exactly do you come back after the groundbreaking part 2?. How do you top it?. Apparently, after seeing the movie, you don't. The effects are fantastic and cool, but they don't seem to build much upon part 2. The female terminator is incredible, but her attributes don't outdo or better Robert Patrick's from the previous film. Basically, it just stays with the flow from the second film with eye popping action that outdoes everything in action films in recent years and great effects. The story takes place ten years later, although it has actually been twelve years since the last film came out. John Connor, now played by Nick Stahl, has been keeping a low profile. He has no phone, no address, and lives on the street. Can't find him that way. A female terminator named the T-X, played by beautiful Kristana Lokken, comes to town with one thing in mind. Kill John and prevent him from becoming the future leader of humankind. She starts going thru everyone associated with him and leaving them in body bags. In comes the T-101 cyborg(Arnold)to protect John, although he was originally designed and programmed to be an assassin. His mission is to also protect the lovely Kate Brewster(played by the lovely Claire Danes), who is an old acquaintance of John's and has a connection with him in the future. Arnold must keep them alive, keep the terminatrix at bay, and stop machines being controlled by computers and destroying the world. Arnold is back in action and reclaims the action king crown. He's getting older, but it is definitley not an issue. He doesn't look much different than he did 12 years ago. I would still much rather see a 55 year old Arnold Schwarzenegger, or a 60 year old Harrison Ford, than a 25 year old anybody else. This film also has a welcome dose of humor as well. It is able to be funny and crack jokes and play with itself. Other action films take themselves so seriously, that they are laughable. Again, must I mention ""XXX""?. Stahl and Danes are most welcome as the two human heroes. Stahl is a likeable presence worthy enough to cheer and root for. It is somewhat surprising to see Danes in a movie like this. She really fits well tho. She is human and brings real human feelings and emotion to the proceedings. She is very sweet and lovely looking to boot. Kristana Lokken does what there is to do with the character. She is icy and cold and lethal. It also isn't a negative thing that she is nice to look at. The dialogue is pretty tight, from what you can make out of it from all of the technical mumbo jumbo, and everything moves right along at a nice pace. There is even a cameo from Earl Boen, who appeared as Dr. Siberling in the original film. Nice touch. It is a bit sad that Linda Hamilton wasn't involved. She was missed. The movie is everything you'd expect from an action movie and everything you could want in a Terminator film. The action is incredible. It just keeps coming. A chase scene with firetrucks and all is an impressive sight. Teriffic. So, it's a slam bang, fun filled action ride that is sure to please die hard action fans. I enjoyed it a lot and I think anyone interested in this sort of thing will be too. Diesel still isn't ready to play with the big boys.",1058140800,4,3929,4.398351648351649
1476471,3,B00005JM0B,"First of all I too, understand that Arnold needed another hit to pull his slumping acting career back on track as well as give him something to do before his full fledge campaign launch as Governor of California.... (insider information) but boy was I disappointed.
No Linda Hamilton, No James Cameron, No Edward Furlong (who did a OUTSTANDING job in T2 as John Conner) and last but not least not enough plausible plot. Let's face it the first {TERMINATOR} was a surprise sleeper hit, in Terminator 2 it was what we had waited 10 years for and BOY did it deliver with Robert Patrick in the best machine portrayal I've ever seen... menacing, cold and the special effects were TOP NOTCH that year... some of you may remember it won a Oscar that year for Special Effects.
So low and behold we wait another decade or so for this installment.. my hopes were high and eager to see Arnold and John do some Kick butt action. The fact that Sarah a/k/a Linda Hamilton had so many scenes (in the first 2)where she participated in the fight and gun scenes made the movie even more EXCITING for me, I just thought they would deliver. In this one you see one long vehicle chase scene in the beginning that ate up about 20 minutes (or at least that is what it felt like) of screen time, a fight scene between the 2 Terminators near the end that was pretty intense but still not what you got with the first 2 movies :( and Oh yea.... the plot (or lack thereof)
I agree with what another reviewer said, if you are new to this franchise you'll probably LOVE it, or if you are young and didn't see the first 2 when they were originally released (ie; before the computer generated era) you won't mind the things that I just mentioned. I gave it 1 star for the Action.... the 2nd Star for Clair Danes (she was very good) and the 3rd star for actually 2 things... Arnold's one line that made him famous (with the exclusion of any from Conan) ""I'LL BE BACK"" in the case of this movie....""SHE'LL BE BACK"" and second they got the end right.
I really felt like John should have been in more scenes where he had more Action (other than just running)- I don't know maybe when the DVD comes out we'll find them in the ""deleted scenes"" feature. I would have expected any child of Sarah Conner to have more toughness (with guns and physically) about him...",1058140800,4,2325,4.396751740139211

I would have given two stars for the far-fetched explosions and probably one star for the incorrect display of fuel cells (they do not become nuclear weapons). The rest is good for factual filler (e.g., how SkyNet develops). Unfortunately, the final sequence leaves no doubt that there will be a Terminator 4.",1058140800,,588,4.556603773584905

It happened with RoboCop 3, it happened with Alien 3, and now it happened with Terminator 3. I guess the warning signs were all there- no James Cameron, no Brad Fidel music and Industrial Light & Magic put to mediocre use- but like an optimistic fool, I had high hopes any way. Given director Johnathan Mostow's last filmmake opus was U-571, I should have heeded the warning signs. Even with the brilliant mythology that James Cameron, William Wisher, and even Harlan Ellison had come up with, I was given to wonder if Mostow, the seven *SEVEN* producers and four screen writers had actually even seen the previous two films. Or if they did, were they paying attention and taking notes?

 The Terminator series has been near and dear to might heart since it debuted in 1984- I have been a fan. I have soundtracks, books, comics, games, DVDs, and special effects books on the series. It established James Cameron as a director and made Schwareneggar a mega-star. The original was a gritty, dark, and brutal science fiction drama based very loosely on two stories by Harlan Ellison (""Soldier"" and ""Demon With the Glass Hand""), and gave us very memorable characters. The second film was a slick, big-budget action film with ground breaking special effects, brutal psychology and scenes that left the audience in stunned silence with tears in their eyes. Both films have stood up well, even the original with its stop-motion animated Terminator endo-skeleton still looks very good in this age of CGI everything. Mostow, on the other hand, takes all of that and makes hash of it. He rapes the mythology and history, even going so far as to render one of the major story points in Terminator 2 irrelevant.

 Set in Los Angeles of 2003, Terminator 3 is seven years after the apocolypse `Judgement Day' never happens, it being avoided by the second Terminator, Sarah and her son John and the sacrifice of scientist Miles Bennet Dyson, when they blew up the CyberDyne offices. Apparently, it didn't work- Dyson's sacrifice is meaningless, and all they accomplished was to postpone Judgement Day. Now, instead Skynet arising from a private company fulfilling a military contract, it is instead created the US Air Force and un-named `civilian contractors'. As a back story there is an internet-wide virus wreaking havoc around the world, and the government is ordering the Air Force developers to unleash the Skynet AI to deal with. How a military defense computer intelligence, designed to control ICBMs and stealth bombers, is capable of destroying a computer virus is never quite explained.

 What also isn't explained is how John Connor went from a smart, hip 11 year old to a 23 year old loser. Instead of getting Edward Furlong back to reprise his role, (who would be the right age exactly for the part), they get Nick Stahl, who delivers most of his lines as though he were half asleep, and doesn't really come to life until the last quarter of the film. Kritanna Loken, who plays the over-hyped T-X `Terminatrix' has almost no screen presence, even lacking the sense that she's supposed to be an unstoppable killing machine that Schwarzenegger and Robert Patrick did so well in previous ventures. Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't even that impressive- over using the sun glasses cliche twice too often and no where near as threatening as he was in the first two films. Claire Danes is arguably the best aspect of the film- she's a good actress, but serves almost no purpose other than to be a foil for both Connor and the Terminator, and to give a reason to go to the Air Force base.

 The film's editing is a real mess and so the pacing the suffers. Admittedly, the crane/firetruck chase is as good as any action car chase I have seen, but it's in the middle of the film, so by the end you realize it was the highlight. The T-X's over the top technology- she's basically a T-1000 crossed with a 101 series, liquid metal over an endo-skeleton with built in weapons. Even that isn't enough to make her scary or even seem dangerous. She gets run over, crushed, pinned to a particle accelerator with an electromagnet, thrown through cement walls and shot with rockets and grenades, emerging unarmed- but drop a helicopter on her and her legs fall off. They never give the impression she was taking any damage. In T2, near the end, you knew the T-1000 was starting to have problems with the way his form shifted and couldn't control his body.

 Cameron must be laughing his guts out over this. But the laugh is on us- yet again Hollywood has perpetrated another cinematic stink burger on us, and we filed in to see it like bovines. I didn't totally hate it- the special effects were quite good, and I was pleased with the ending- I must confess to not quite have seen it coming. However, making Skynet the cause of the virus that's causing the problems undermines why Judgement Day happened at all. Originally, the newly self-aware computer trigger the launch of nuclear weapons because the humans tried to unplug it- it felt threatened. All of this is forgotten or lost, and this time Skynet does it `just because'. The upshot of all of this is, I can safely say there won't be a Terminator 4- he won't be back, and we'll be better off for it.",1058054400,9,5402,4.71292372881356

But for me, the best part was the ending.  I was *not* expecting that.  A lot of the respect I have for this film is in its daring to write an unpopular ending that fit so well.  I love watching this movie; when I leave the theater, I am always thankful for my petty little life with its petty little problems.

This is a great movie for the franchise, and it does justice to it as well, because it is great fun for kids and just plain exciting for adults. This is the kind of science fiction I (need) and want to see (let's hope Mostow makes more); but what can you say about that ending? Either way, it is hard to say you don't like it.

1476519,3,B00005JM0B,"My opinion of the this film is very mixed, perhaps confusing. I apologize if it does not help:
T3 will be extremely exciting for newcomers to the Terminator genre, but die-hard fans of the first 2 films may be slightly disappointed. Arnold is back in top form, perhaps his best form. Kristanna Loken's Terminatrix was calculated and cold, making her a perfect killing machine. Unfortunately, Nick Stahl bears no resemblance to the John Conner we are familiar with(blonde???) My largest complaint was this: This time, Arnold's Terminator is not likeable at all. He is cold, rude, and devoid of chemistry with John. He reminds me of Linda Hamilton's Sarah from T2, who, thankfully, was not in this installment. The fight sequences between The Terminator and The Terminatrix were very intense and exciting. The most satisfying surprise in T3 is the cameo of Dr. Silberman in the graveyard scene. It was, among many other scenes, very funny and nostalgic of the previous films. Unlike the intense stand-off at Cyberdyne headquarters in T2, there is no defining battle sequence in T3. When I first heard that James Cameron's passing on this film, I did not think it would have a large impact. I was wrong. I think if Cameron had made T3, it would have been legendary as the first 2 films. Sadly, The Terminator franchise follows in the footsteps of The Alien franchise: a disappointing third installment that does not live up to the previous efforts. Is James Cameron trying to tell us something? In closing, go see it, if for nothing else, entertainment purposes.",1057968000,3,1559,4.909090909090909

Although not as great as parts 1 or 2, Terminator 3 is a terrific summer movie. Great action, mindless violence and pure wackiness. And what makes it better, a cool story that I've followed for 20 years (since I was a kid)! I'm so glad they didn't go ""hollywood"" on the storyline. If they had, I would hate this movie with a passion. I give them credit for keeping it ""true"". For those who have seen the movie, I hope you know what I'm referring to.

I'll admit going into this movie I was reluctant to ""like"" it. The original ""Terminator"" director did not work on this, Linda Hamilton did not sign on, plotline was sort of ""typical"", and a ""bad chick"" terminator was kind of lame. But I liked it.

1476525,4,B00005JM0B,"To my surprise, T3  didn't turn out to be as bad as I thought it would have been.  I had low expectations of this film due to all the factors that gave reasoning for this to be a bad film such as the absenses of James Cameron and Linda Hamilton.  But after I saw this film, I was BLOWN AWAY from all those thoughts.  This film was terrific!  It would have been nice Linda Hamilton and Ed Furlong (the kid who played John Conner in T2)to return but not everything is perfect in life.  This easily one of Arnold's best movies he has made in years.  But compared to the first two, this is the worst Terminator movie yet, but it is still a mind blowing action-packed thrill ride.  Atnold's back and better then ever and has his mind set on a new intense adventure as a machine.  Anyway, here is the plot..
It has now been ten yrs since skynet was blown away.  Sarah Conner is now deceased and John Conner is now basically doing whatever he can to avoid the life he was destined for.  He basically does what he can to stay alive and keeps traveling hundreds of miles but really has no idea where he is going.  Nut it turns out that blowing up Skynet doesn't prevent Judgement Day; it only postponed it.  That means that the Terminators will still exist, and now there is one a new and very advanced one.  It is called the T-X (Terminatrix), played by Kristanna Loken who is wicked hot!  She is Faster, stronger,and can control and heavy machinery with her mind .  As in she can drive a car, but she won't be in the car, she will be somewhere else while her mind will be controlloing the car.  This Terminator is sent to do the obvious-Kill John Conner.  But that is not all.  Conner isn't going to be the only general in the war against the machines in the future.  There will be other generals in the war and the T-X must kill everynody who will become a general in the future right now so they won't be able to fight in the war.  Also a T-850 (Arnold Schwarzenegger).  It is slighlty more advanced then the T-800's that were sent back in the first 2 films.  His mission is of course protect Conner and his fri9end Kate Brewster (Clare Danes).  It seems that Brewster's father is the man who will create Skynet and is almost finished with the project.  Now it is up to them to stop that from happening and before the T-X can get to them and terminate them.  One other thing, Earl Boen makes a small reappearence as Dr. Silberman (the guy who treated Sarah Conner in the first 2 films)
Anyway, T3 is loaded with instense action and lots of destruction.  This film had the most destruction out of the 3.  The only thing that keeps that this film from getting a perfect 5/5 is that part is confusing and there are some things in this movie that seem ridiculous.  Things such as the T-850 kicking an ambnulance and cousing it to tip over.  This film however doesn't come close to as good as the second was.  T2 was way better, even the original Terminator (1984) was better.  But this is still good and should be ssen while it is still in theaters.",1057881600,,3040,4.288224956063269

John Connor is in his early twenties and has been hiding and running since he and his mother stopped Judgment Day from happening.
As it turns out Judgment Day is inevitable and the machines go back in time again kill off not only John Connor, but his lieutenants as well.  Enter Arnold again who is sent back to protect not only Connor but Kate Brewster (played by Claire Danes).
In the midst of this is a new Terminator unit T-X or as Connor calls her at one point, Terminatrix.  She is a sleek, super-model killer and virtually unstoppable.  In their attempt to escape, they outrun the T-X in a vet truck in one of the most destructive car chases put on film.
It's all very exciting and fun with a slight human element that doesn't go as deep as T2 went, but they try.  Claire Danes and Nick Stahl (Connor) don't really have too much chemistry between them; however, Arnold does with his deep-pan delivery and his new psychology sub-routine, which leads to the most humorous moments in the film.
Jonathan Mostow had some big shoes to step into taking on this directing project and he does a bang-up job (pun intended).  He has captured the feeling of excitement and loss that is in the first two of knowing the world is coming to an end, but frankly without Linda Hamilton's strong female character, this film lacks some of the spunk that made T1 and T2 great.",1057795200,,1533,4.565693430656935

I thought T-2 kind of slowed down too much in parts (don't get me wrong, I liked T-2 as well). The special effects are excellent as one would expect in this day and age.
Allot of people have mentioned that they missed Linda Hamilton's character. Although I liked her in the first two movies, I did not miss her that much. After all the terminators are the real stars in these movies anyway.
The biggest disappointment for me in this movie is I did not think it explained how the artificial intelligence still was developed after it was supposed to be destroyed at the end of T-2. They skimmed passed it by simply stating that they did not stop Judgment Day, just delayed it. Judgment day is inevitable (as a person who does not believe in fate, I found this to be a very weak explanation). They could have simply stated that they had backups of the work done at the research center off site and continued with the work using a different group of scientists (yes, I am in charge of backing up our software at work so maybe I am more into this kind of ridicules details).

1476675,2,B00005JM0B,"It's amazing how  the basic Terminator storyline can still generate some dramatic tension almost 20 years since its introduction. I sat there in the theater noticing the  similiarities in all three movies: the arrival of the two warriors, one sent to kill, the other sent to protect (this time I noticed they arrived in large disco balls), and then the introduction of the character who's at the center of all the fuss. The tension mounts as they both hunt for John Connor simultaneously, culminating in the initial action scene. It's almost predictable what will happen, but I was still engaged even though I had seen this setup twice before.  I guess it shows how well done the original story was for a sci-fi action movie.
And the  initial action  sequence was incredible. Part of me was enthralled; the other part of me was wondering how the city of L.A. let the producers of the film destroy so much stuff. A lot of it looked like it was filmed on location. This chase scene was equal to (or better than?) the one in The Matrix Reloaded mostly because of the sheer destruction, and the concept of the Terminatrix controlling multiple vehicles.  But I wasn't as impressed with this new Terminator; it was like a cross between the T-1000 and Inspector Gadget. It had a ""been there, done that"" feel  to the special effects. I also liked Robert Patrick's portrayal of the T-1000 better. He almost seemed like an animal, hunting and sensing his environment, where Kristana Loken's Terminatrix came off like a pissed-off smug model at a nightclub.
Then the plot contrivances kicked in and I began to wince. I was wondering how they were going to justify the arrival of the Terminatrix since T2 ended with such a strong sense of finality. They destroyed Cyberdine systems and skynet before its inception and stopped the nuclear war! Where could you go from there? Arnold saying, ""you didn't stop it, you merely postponed it"" wasn't satisfying enough. They never showed how they continued the work of Cyberdine. Skynet was just up and running at the beginning of this movie. And the fact that Skynet sent yet another Terminator, which was even better than the T-1000, was wholly unoriginal. How did it find the time to create and send those new Terminators even though it was basically defeated?
But that really isn't my main gripe. My main gripe is that it didn't have James Cameron's touch for action movie storytelling. James Cameron is one of the best action movie writer/directors not because he could blow stuff up, but because he was able to write in just enough back story and characterization so when the action occurred, it was more dramatic. The characters of Ripley from Aliens and Sarah Connor from T2 were fleshed out so there was an emotional attachment for the audience. The introduction of John Connor's wife was interesting, but in the end she seemed like another doe-eyed person thrown into the action. The running times of both T2 and Aliens were over 2 hours and 20 minutes because James Cameron gave enough time to set up dramatic action and create strong characterization (well good enough for an action movie). T3 had a running time of approximately 1 hour and 50 minutes.
Maybe the producers of T3 thought the only thing needed for a Terminator movie was a recycling of the basic plot and throw in more advanced special effects. But T2 and the original also carried some emotional resonance as well. Therefore when this movie ended I was able to get up quickly and head out to the shopping mall.",1057708800,3,3517,4.755737704918033
1476676,5,B00005JM0B,"After reading a review referencing ""cash-ins"" I had some doubts, but after seeing the movie over the weekend, they've all quickly vaporized <grin>. The movie is concise and to the point, the story is good enough and the end is - well- very plausible at our current state of affairs.
 The first shock is how incredible Arnold looks at 55. He makes other action jocks like Vin Diesel, Sly, the Rock, et al, look like puny teenagers. This physique is not a result of a quick fix-up with a personal trainer, but stems from a lifetime of intense training and conditioning.  Next, there is very good chemistry between Nick Stahl and Claire Danes. They are both very good actors and are believable. The Terminatrix is, no doubt, a drop-dead (no pun intended) gorgeous woman, even though Robert Patrick's icy stare in T2 was more ""scary"". The movie has some of the coolest car chase scenes ever made, yet there's very little computer imagery that completely ruined the action industry lately (Matrix, Star Wars, etc). What impressed me most was Mostow's ability to share inside jokes with the audience. There's plenty of dark humor that was innovative and did not take away from the action.
The only figure I seriously missed was Sarah Connor, i.e. Linda Hamilton. Mostow solved the problem of her absence skillfully though.
Final word -- don't miss it. A movie of this kind needs to be seen in a theater, no matter how advanced your home system is. Besides, the home systems will soon become obsolete anyway (Skynet).",1057708800,,1510,4.781609195402299
1476677,5,B00005JM0B,This movie is super cool. The Special Effects used in this movie are mind blowing. The Story is also good and the acting looks real. This movie will be the best movie of 2003.,1057708800,,175,4.176470588235294
1476678,3,B00005JM0B,"The plot of ""Terminator 3: The Rise of the Machines"" is no different from that of T2:  two cyborgs, one programmed to kill eventual savior John Connor and the other to protect him, are zapped through time.  This conflict, a classic chase scene set-up, comprises the entire movie.  Without the questions of ethics and the unpredictability of the future uses of technology explored in T2, T3 is all action and no substance.  This will delight many fans and disappoint others.
Nick Stahl as John Connor is an unlikely hero: nihilistic, hollow-eyed, and physically unimposing.  Claire Danes is exceptional in her role as the reluctant but fierce Kate who maintains her class even as she watches Schwarzenegger spit out a bullet.  Schwarzenegger plays his cyborg as he always has, with the same deadpan delivery whether he is expressing a horrific truth or poking fun at the previous films in the series.  I know a lot of people object to Kristianna Loken as the new T-X model, but I loved her.  She exhibits both the cold ambition of a machine and the tastes of a predator.
The action sequences are all high-gear, breathtaking excitement even if the logic of them isn't always clear.  The screenwriters have provided some hilarious moments to punctuate the tension, many of which refer to jokes established in T1 and T2.  The ending is both surprising and surprisingly original, the only solid plot in the movie.
If you are a Terminator fan, you must see this film.  Chase scene devotees and those with a hunger for pure action will love it.  The two hours pass quickly when you're gripping the arms of your chair, but don't expect to take anything away from this movie.  If you want even a modicum of substance with your action, skip this.  Four stars for the action, two for the plot.",1057708800,,1782,4.7435064935064934
1476679,4,B00005JM0B,"Possibly Arnold's best movie since... well, T2, T3 is perhaps weighed down by the extraordinary levels of excellence established by it's predecessors.  As a stand-alone action flick, it delivers in spades but, sadly though somewhat predictably, it pales in comparison to its prequels.
The narrative is surprisingly taut and on the whole, bar a few lapses, well-told with even some sharp plot twists thrown in for good measure.  A glaring and significant omission from this latest sequel is Brad Fiedel's familiar Terminator theme tune, the inclusion of which I am absolutely certain would increase the success of the movie enormously.  Without the theme resonating through the action sequences, the movie certainly feels lacking.  In truth, I do not recall a theme at all in T3, so passive and understated was the film's score.
However, Arnold was at back at his best in T3 - re-enacting his role as easily and smoothly as if T2 was released last year.  The new Terminatrix was satisfactory, though never truly captivating nor menacing.  The support provided by Nick Stahl and Claire Danes was also passable, though it must be highlighted that Stahl makes for a much more believable John Connor than Edward Furlong ever could.
So, in conclusion, Terminator fans will be pleased by the storyline and performances of the leads.  They may also enjoy the action sequences which are par for the course for the trilogy.  However, the continuation of the saga has been made hollow due to the omission of the old Terminator theme tune which provided the previous movies with just the right tempo, while enabling the audience to cheer for the heroes.  Nonetheless, I do recommend the movie, as I had expected it to be much, much worse.",1057708800,12,1726,4.965277777777778
1476680,1,B00005JM0B,"I really wanted to like this movie, having been a fan of the previous two.  Unfortunately the dialog is very weak (Arnolds best lines are the ones taken from his previous movies), the acting is weaker and the actors lack the chemistry that was present in the previous two.
If want to see it for the special effects, than by all means go for it.  Just don't expect anything more than that.
I have to give this movie a solid ""D"", and that is being generous.",1057622400,2,455,4.27906976744186
1476681,4,B00005JM0B,"I'll admit the speculation in my mind was more than present when I had learned of a new Terminator film minus the talents of creator James Cameron and stars Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong; but when the credits for Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines began to roll I walked out of the theater with quite a smile on my face.  Director Jonathan Mostow is a more than worthy successor to Cameron; he has crafted a very well put together and visually stunning action film that will quiet all the naysayers and return star Arnold Schwarzenegger to superstar form.  Nick Stahl is a worthy sucessor to Eddie Furlong as well in the role of John Conner: the man who is destined to lead humanity to victory against the machines.  The storyline picks up with John living ""off the grid"".  Even though the Judgement Day of 1997 was prevented, he lives with no phone, no address, no real identity, nothing to get himself traced by the machines in the future.  His worst fears are confirmed when the Terminatrix (the stunning Kristanna Loken) arrives from the future to take him and some of his acquaintances out (including Claire Danes in a lively role), and he is soon joined by a familiar looking Termiantor re-programed to make sure that he survives the upcoming nuclear nightmare.  Everything about Terminator 3 is big: incredible special effects, eye-popping action scenes, and insane stunt work make this film the best action film of the summer next to X-Men 2.  Schwarzenegger himself is at his usual best in the role of the emotionless cyborg, and as usual gives a terrific performance.  Of course the film doesn't have the epic emotional scope of the first two films, but that is instantly forgiveable once the action kicks in.  Also, many long time Terminator fans will notice the numerous in jokes present throughout the film (including Earl Boen returning as Dr. Silberman in a hilarious throwaway scene).  Clearly the writers, and Mostow himself, weren't afraid to play with Cameron's source material.  Yes, this is a blatant cash in by Warner Bros., but I don't think I've ever seen one this good.",1057622400,,2098,4.8
1476682,3,B00005JM0B,"What a great story to work with, but I think this movie sells itself short.  The action was excellent and the effects were well done.  I liked the car chase and the scenes where the Skynet becomes self aware and the machines start taking over.  But the thing that gets me is the length and the minor story.  It could've had more interaction between characters and more details.  It had the given scenes where the two terminators arrive, steal clothes from some poor sap, and acquire their targets.  Then there's an action filled chase, Arnold brings everyone up to speed, busts out of a cemetary, and then your at the end of the movie.  I was like I just got here and the story just started to become interesting.  The humor was entertaining and wasn't as lame and tacky as every other movie made these days.  I personally like when Arnold says ""She'll be back"" referring to the T-X.  Also, someone asked why the T-X had to have a gun and I would have to support this question since she can create a cannon and blow Arnold threw a wall.  THis movie wasn't as dark as the first two.  The first two films took place mostly at night and I liked that darker look more than three o'clock in the afternoon in southern California. For me the ending was anticlimactic.  I said to myself, ""This was gonna happen all along. That [stinks].""  If I was John Connor I would be saying to myself ""why did we go to all that trouble in the last film?""  But hopefully this sets up the story for another film where the human race rises up and defeats Skynet.
All in all I have mixed feelings about the film.  If they make another film to continue the story (which they should) then I'll be happy.  But if this is the last one then I find it as just a waste of time and money and I will just stick to the first two.",1057622400,,1794,4.260355029585799
1476683,4,B00005JM0B,"The first thing you're likely to think as the movie starts is, ""this sure doesn't feel like a Terminator movie."" And I attribute this mostly the absolutely horrible soundtrack. Brad Fiedel's famous and haunting score of man vs machine is no where to be found. Beltrami does an arrangement of it once...at the end credits. Now I realize that most movie-goers care less about musical scores, but the absense of Fiedel is as strong as if you were going to make a Star Wars sequel and not use John Williams classic score.
If your a real fan of the franchise, the second thing you'll notice is a true lack of James Cameron. I must admit, that many of the shots and the cinematography appears right out of the T2 playbook, but it's important to remember Cameron didn't only direct the film, he wrote it. T3 suffers from a real lack of intelligent plotting that is one of Cameron's strongpoints. For the most part, action scene happen because... well they just needed action scenes.
The story centers around a now adult John Conner, aimlessly making his way through life now that Judgement Day has successfully been avoided (see T2). But we find out of course that it hasn't, it's just been prolonged 10 years. In this film, Skynet is about to go operational and machines are about to take over the world just as Reese described in T1. But the target isn't only Conner this time. New character Kate Brewster is John's future second in command, and it's she who this time sends back the antiquated T-800 to protect both her and John. The new menace is the T-X which is even more advanced (and somehow less advanced) then the T-1000 from T2.
The plot is pretty formulaic, and follows the traditional Terminator style. There's definately nothing cerebral about it, and you know pretty quickly into the film just how the T-X is gonna bite it thanks to some pretty obvious forshadowing. Most of it is just an excuse to have Arnold kicking [butt] against the virtually indestructable T-X that should have destroyed him in the first 15-minutes (she's an anti-terminator terminator). At least in this film, Arnold's Terminator is much more a killing machine than the ""now I know why you cry"" touchy-feely Terminator from T2.
Despite all the flaws that are glaring once you stop and think about this film when it's over, it's still hard not to enjoy it. On it's own, it's a pretty fun hollywood blockbuster. As a sequel to one of the greatest sci-fi franchises of all time, it's lacking. But fortunately, it's good enough that you're glad to have it rather than no sequel at all. I particularly enjoyed the ending. While not executed as well as it could have been, it brings a lot more meaning to the story rather than just the same old, ""how they gonna defeat the terminator this time?"" type of plot. It leaves a huge opening for a sequel, but also serves as a fitting ending to the series, should this be it.
All in all, I have to give T3 a positive review. Even though the James Cameron fan in me questions much of this film, it's still entertaining, and that's all this film sets out to do. It's a fun roller coaster ride that shouldn't be missed in the theatre if you at all enjoy big action blockbusters.",1057622400,2,3194,4.585664335664336
1476684,5,B00005JM0B,"I was very excited to see this movie and I was not disapointed at all. It has loads of action from beginning to end, more than T2. The story is about the same as T2, but this time, we see the rise of the machines and how this war between man and machines started. Even if the movie has a different director and Linda Hamilton does not appear in it, the actors are very good and Arnold's performance is one of the best in his career. The visual effects are awesome and very good, better than most movies I saw recently.

Instead, what we got was a script which seemed written by a 6th grader, and some mis-casts/mis-directions of biblical proportions (e.g., John Connor).
In some sense Arnie came out smelling like a rose in this one - he looked like his old self, acted like his old self, etc (which isn't saying he'll win an oscar for best actor, but I'm sure he knows that). The script was just flat out laughable at times, and at least a few times just plain [bad].  A few special mentions: Making John Connor a whining wimp just didn't work, and imho the terminatrix was mis-cast and/or mis-directed also.

1476741,5,B00005JM0B,"Let me start out by saying that this third installment of the Terminator is the best yet.  The film has no problem of course with causing plenty of mayhem and delivers non-stop action throughout.  But, the movie also succeds in putting in some drama and it works very effectively making this the best movie of the year so far.
Arnold is back and better than ever after coming out with a few medicore movies (End of Days, 6th Day, Collateral Damage), he does the right thing and goes back to the role that pretty much defined his career.  But the formula is tweaked by adding in a female cyborg against him (Kristanna Loken).  Also, the chemistry between Nick Stahl and Claire Danes is terrific and really adds to the already fabulous movie.
The movie is great not only because of the amazing car chase scene early in the film, but that's a big part of the equation because really, the Terminator movies are just one big chase scene, but new director Jonathan Mostow handles it just as good, if not better than James Cameron did by creating an exiting atmosphere and more action than 3 other summer movies have combined.
BOTTOM LINE:  If you liked the first two Terminator movies or any Schwarnenegger movies at all, you'll love this 3rd installment to a great movie franchise. (5 stars out of 5)",1057622400,,1295,4.588744588744588
1476742,2,B00005JM0B,"From the moment Arnold says ""You're terminated,"" this picture falls apart. There are several places in the picture where you wonder if the screenwriters even saw the first two films, though you tend to ignore them because Arnold and the other actors are doing good work, and the setpiece destruction is well-staged. But you do notice Skynet's takeover. That was described in T2, and it's not what happens in T3. Then we are asked to believe a father outright lies to his daughter with his dying breath. That leads to an ending that is totally in violation of the series' premise (till now) -- a saying repeated in both films: ""The future is not set. Our future is what we make of it."" This picture's premise is: ""The future IS set, and there's nothing we can do about it."" Maybe if all this had been set up it would have worked, though I doubt it. You can't change core tenets of a film series and have it work. T3 does just that, and it doesn't work.",1057622400,,951,4.409090909090909
1476743,3,B00005JM0B,"I saw the film two days ago and I thought it was pretty good. I believe that it felt like a sequal to Judgement Day. The movies blended in quite nicley. Unlike The Lost World to Jurassic Park 3 the film stayed true to the other two films. It was scary and a bit gorey. It reminded me of Terminator 2 except newer and better. I like how the movie takes place all in one day. The filming was great and Industrail Light and Magic did an outstanding job with the visual effects. I could tell what was CGI and what was not but it took be a couple of seconds to figure it out. The music was pretty good. Some of the jokes were funny. Stan Winston did an outstanding job with his robots for the film. I know a lot about movies ( believe me) but I don't know if it was a camera trick or a motor in the robots that made them move so fast through that building in the end.
Now for the bad stuff. The film's beggining is some what weird. The graveyard scene had to many explosions. It seemed like they wanted it to be really action packed. The story becomes a little hard to follow. Then the thing that ruined the movie the most is the stupid ending. It makes no sense even though he explains exactly what happens you think to your self what a complete waste of time. Other than the stupid ending I think the movie was pretty good.

1476744,4,B00005JM0B,"The Terminator movies are for today's audience what the Planet of the Apes, Heston and McDowell not Walberg, were for our parents.  Fortunately for us, the studios have repaired a major flaw of those films by increasing the budgets as opposed to cutting them.  The early chase scene budget would probably equall the budget of the last of the Ape series films.
  I can't honestly give the film a 5 star rating as I felt it was too short for the film's transition.  The final, although very good, seemed a little rushed.  There are several scenes of action and the usual one liners that all action movies have adopted.  The film is essential a sequel and follows the same successful formula of it's predecessors, so I can not give it credit for originallity.  What I can say positive about the film was that I saw it on Manday after the big weekend.  The theater was not entirely full at 2:30 in the afternoon, but there were several people present.  When the credits rolled and the lights came up, I noticed several people my age 35+ (who had probably seen the original and the T2 in theaters)who were quite happy with the film.
  My point being that the film is what an action film is supposed to be, entertaining.  I have read several reviews and most of them were positive.  The few I have read that were negative can be categorized as follows:
1) Worshippers at the gates of James Cameron.  These purist damn the film in most reviews for this simple fact alone.  Cameron didn't direct so the film is automatically flawed.
2)  Keepers of the flame.  These are the ones who complain about the change in the stories direction.  They often complain about T3 spurring away from the Terminator's philosophical edge.  These people have difficulty in seeing that T3 is simply the logical progression of T1 and T2.  T1 presented us with the logical fear of placing to much faith in machines much like the films Wargames, Matrix and Colossus.  T2 continued the transition of that fear to an impending doom and dealt with the possibility of altering that fate with a single act.  (Any Science fiction purist would have to know, that had they truely changed the future, they would have altered the past as well.  John Conner's father is his friend from the future.)  T3 continues the Philosophical line of can the future be altered by events in the past.  Though this particular line is not answered it is curious that both the machines and man belive that it is a posibility.  One point sorely missed by these critics is the fact that this time John is informed of his impending death.  With this knowledge, will he now prevent this from happening or will he fall prey to what has already happened in the future.
3)  Cast Purist.  There is no Linda Hamilton or Edward Furlong, in fact only Arnold and, in one suprisingly fresh comic moment, a lesser character of T2 return in this film.  Most hate the new John Conner.  The new John Conner is still uneasy in his role as future leader.  His reluctance is present until the end of the film.  As far as Nick Stahl (John Conner)is concerned, I could listen to him speak over Furlong any day.  His performance may not be stellar, but I never felt the need to reach in the screen and slap him on the back of the head .
4) And Finally.  Why is the robot a woman?  The terminator was created for the sole purpose of infiltration and termination of human resistance.  Review T1 for those who have forgotten this.  The first ones looked human but lacked the essentials needed to truely pass this off up close.  The machines evolved on the product to compensate for errors.  A female terminator is a natural progression in this process.  A predominately male resistance force is more likely to take in a female over a male, especially if that male has the potential to be a robot.
  The end result of the film is really as I said before.  If you have never seen a film in the series, it is easy to follow and still entertaining.  Its an action movie, and although a bit formulaic, it still delivers.  I Saw it with by daughter (9), and my mother (54), and both enjoyed it.",1057622400,2,4104,4.513586956521739
1476745,5,B00005JM0B,"Warning: This review contains spoilers
It's safe to say that my expectations for this film were rather low when I went in to see it. Sequels that are held off this long (12 years) are rarely worth it, and the third movie is usually where these franchises start coming undone. Thankfully, within the first five minutes, all of my fears were put to rest. James Cameron is missing-in-action as director, and at the helm this time is the relatively unknown Jonathan Mostow, who injects his own flavor into the science-fiction/action genre and breathes new life into the franchise, while staying true to the roots. This movie is simply amazing. I would even use the word 'epic' to describe it. If you are familiar with the first two 'Terminator' flicks, you will be salivating at most of the scenes. There are also worries about characters that are missing and casting changes, but those should be put to rest as well. This movie benefits from starting from scratch again with it's characters and giving us new problems. I wasn't about ready to watch Linda Hamilton discipline Edward Furlong again for another 2 hours. The movie follows John Connor, now a young adult, who is homeless and as he puts it ""lives off the grid."" He thinks that he has prevented Judgment Day, but in his heart, he feels it is just yet to come. Sarah Connor, his mother, has passed away, and he is on his own. Not fifteen minutes into the movie, John discovers that there is a new batch of Terminators sent to his time yet again, one, is the loveable Arnie model, sent to protect him. The other is the unstoppable T-X (a.k.a The Terminatrix) who is an improved model over the T-1000 from part 2 and is, well, female. The movie moves at a non-stop pace. This movie gave me the adrenaline rush that 'The Matrix: Reloaded' needed, promised, and lacked. I was on the edge of my seat for the entire hour and fifty minutes this movie lasted. The story sucks you in, as it is revealed that Judgment Day is quickly coming up on the horizon and there may be nothing John or his allies can do to stop it. The whole movie has an underlying feeling of doom. Because Judgment Day is inevitable, and no matter what he does, the walls will come crashing down around John Connor. I have to say that I had a massive grin on my face when the machines started taking over. We have been hearing about it all for so long, it was amazing to finally see it happen. And it was all pulled off so well. This movie takes a lot of risks that most summer-blockbusters don't take. For one thing, it stays true to its roots and is a real fan-pleaser. Instead of providing a story that any newcomer can follow, this installment is a continuation of previous events and helps put all the pieces of the puzzle back together. Also, the movie is relatively violent, bleak and sprinkled with a bit of dark humor. It all works maginificently. I can't hand this movie enough compliments. All I can say to you is, put your fears aside. You can waste your time wondering what this movie would be like had Cameron directed it, but as it is, Jonathan Mostow contributed an exciting and fresh sequel to the franchise, that, tastefully enough, leaves room for more. Let's just hope T4 makes it here before the summer of 2015.",1057622400,2,3252,4.513559322033898
1476746,1,B00005JM0B,"Ok, I love the terminator movies.  The reason is that they had extreme plot twists in them.
T1 - I mean if you think about the first one it blows you away.  The terminator was sent to stop John Connor from being born, but John wouldn't have existed if they hadn't gone back to kill him.  The only reason he was born was due to the fact that Reese was sent to protect his mother.
Another twist was that the terminators wouldn't have existed either if they hadn't gone back to kill Sarah Connor.  The technology to create them came from the remnants of the crushed terminator.  Hence, evil (terminator) and good (John Connor)were created together - one needed the other.
T2 - The future is not set.  There is no fate, but what we make.  At the end there is an unsure feeling of the future, but Sarah Connor believes if a terminator can value human life maybe we can too!  Excellent statement.  It made me cry!
T3 - This movie discounts itself and what the first two were saying.  I mean after watching the first two, you wonder if Judgment Day would really happen.  You think that this could be reality.  T3 takes out all of the mystery & suspense.  You know it can't be real because at the present time no atomic bombs have gone off.  You realize that this is just a movie.  No well written story, unless it was fantasy in another world, tries to stop the viewer from believing this is happening.  That's why sci-fi usually takes place in the future.  Once it's in the present & portrays the end of the world you know that it's just a story because you're still alive.
After watching T2 I had to keep watch all day on August 29th, 1997.  They should have left it with the same unknown possibility to keep the realistic suspense.  So you could ask yourself, ""Could this happen?""",1057536000,,1776,4.376146788990826
1476747,4,B00005JM0B,"This newest Terminator movie contained no real surprises except for the ending, which departed significantly from the spirit of the first two films.  And it is worth seeing for that ending, which is a satisfying conclusion to the series.
Terminator 3's ending, however, would not have been applicable (taking into account the logic of movie-imagination story-telling) if a certain concluding scene had not been cut from Terminator II, which completely precluded the third film's ending.  But it might not have mattered, even if that scene had been included, and we might have had a third Terminator film anyway.  Look what they did to the TV series Felicity at the end, where time-warps and dreams and everything else managed to bring the show to an close -- and see how James Bond has been about the same age onscreen for about 40 years now.  In the movies, anything can happen.
At any rate, the girl Terminator was a lot better looking than Ah-nuld.",1057536000,,951,4.851851851851852
1476748,4,B00005JM0B,"I will admit that I was quite apprehensive about going to see T3.  I had made it a point the week prior to be sure and watch the other two installments of the series (it had been a long time since I had last seen them) so that I would be sure to have my facts straight when they went in and screwed up the James Cameron legacy from T2.  The more I watched, the more nervous I was that things would go badly.  However, when I did finally get to the theater, I was most pleasantly surprised.  The action was incredible, the special effects were stellar, and the story-line was as totally instep with the others.  Here are the specifics:
Judgment Day was not prevented at the end of T2, rather it was only postponed.  John Conner, now 19, feels that the ultimate destruction of the earth is inevitable.  Turns out he was right.  A new breed of Terminator (another liquid metal one) shows up in LA and starts assassinating people who will form the leadership of the human resistance since John Conner cannot be found.  A T-800 is also sent back to protect John Conner and the woman who will eventually be his wife in the new world.  From there, the plot is rather similar to that of T2 (Must kill John Conner), but there are a few twists along the way.  The T-800 can't be controlled by Conner, and the new T-X, unlike the T-1000, can form weapons in addition to living tissue.  After the initial chaos and destruction that seems to follow whenever any terminator sees a member of the Conner clan, the decision is made to once again attempt to avert Judgment Day by preventing the SkyNet system from being activated so that it may later be destroyed.
While T3 is in many ways similar to its predecessor (and much of it, I believe, is intentional by design, not necessity), there are quite a few differences.  For starters, we learn more about Conner and how he feels about his destiny, and we also find out more about him than he just leads the resistance.  The viewer will also learn a lot more about SkyNet and how Judgment Day came to be.  We will see a limited perspective from the female terminator, not just the T-800.  Additionally, Nick Stahl is made up to at least resemble Michael Biehn from The Terminator, a very important point seeing as how Biehn is his father.  Ultimately, unlike the other two movies, this one defiantly sets the stage for there to be a T4, and based on what we've seen here, I can almost guarantee you that it will not be another Search and Destroy mission against John Conner and his associates.
Those who recall T2 with fondness and thought of it as an excellent movie should defiantly consider T3.  They will not be disappointed.  Newcomers to the series will also enjoy the movie as the ultimate plot is easy to pick up thanks to Conner's prologue and epilogues.  Otherwise, the enjoyment factor is hit or miss.  I know Cameron never really intended for there to be a T3, but now that there is one, at least it's good enough to appeal to the general audience, even if some have a pre-conceived distaste for the whole project.",1057536000,,3059,4.456014362657092
1476820,4,B00005JM0B,"Despite the lack of Linda Hamilton and James Cameron, this Terminator does more than a respectable job at continuing the franchise with wit, action and imagination.  For all of us Terminator fans, this could have been a disaster.  The action sequences are absolutely astounding, and the new Terminatrix is vicious and terrifying. Nick Stahl is a vast improvement over Edward Furlong in the last film, and Arnold's presence is actually fun.  It's a big popcorn epic, not too long, and actually thought-provoking -- which is a requirement of all Terminator movies!",1057536000,,562,5.153846153846154

Kristanna Loken looked more like a ticked off barbie doll than anything else.  There were too many corny one-liners. One or two is fine, but this movie started sounding more like a spoof of the first two after a while.  If you want to see an action movie with a lot of destruction..this is your movie.  But if you are expecting a Terminator movie with any sort of plot line, forget it.  The only positive in this movie is the amazing shape Arnold is in. He is still going strong..too bad the movie couldn't match up.",1057536000,3,648,4.278688524590164
1476822,1,B00005JM0B,"I must say that I was extremely excited when I heard that they were making a third Terminator movie.  I checked Yahoo Movies frequently to get updates on production.  I even went to see MIB 2 just for the first T3 preview.  I am a Terminator fan.  I grew up watching the first.  I was blown away with the script, acting, and special effects of the second.
However the third succeeds in one thing, ripping the emotion out of the series.  I couldn't believe that the movie started without the Terminator theme.  In fact, you didn't hear it until the end credits.  I'm sorry, but I think that music strikes the suspense and emotion in every film.  They must have cut costs to pay for Arnold's $30 mil salary.
The only returning actor was Arnold.  Hello, I should have figured out why the original cast wasn't returning - a horrible script!
THE SCRIPT - Ok, we found out in the first 2 that ""There is no fate, but what we make.""  Correct?
THE FOLLOWING ARE T3 MAJOR PLOT HOLES:
#1  Then why in T3 did the Terminator tell John Connor that Judgment Day was destined to happen, it can't be stopped.  If this were true, whey did the future John send Kyle Reese to deliver the ""no fate"" message to Sarah Connor?  He wouldn't, John would have known that there is a fate.
#2  If there were a destiny, then the destiny would remain the same for everyone right?  If that were true, the future would remain the same for everyone and Judgment Day would remain on 8/29/97.
#3  It was said that the General who started SkyNet was the key.  Oh, the key was just an everyday man who could push a Y on the screen & not the biophysicist who came up with the technology.  Give me a break!  How did the technology magically become the same as Miles Dyson's?  Everything was destroyed!  The movie only said that it was inevitable - there was no explanation to how the technology was duplicated.  That's like saying if Einstein was killed & his inventions & calculations completely destroyed, that someone would have split the atom a few years later in the exact same fashion.  Yeah Right!  There would be major timeline & functioning differences.  I mean just think of the beginning development of PC's, even MAC & IBM used different systems.
#4  James Cameron, who created the series intended for T2 to end it.  Just buy the DVD & check out the deleted scenes.  You will see one of Sarah Connor in 2029 saying that Judgment Day never happened.  Why would it?  Everything was destroyed in T2!  I still believe in ""NO FATE!""",1057536000,,2499,4.448123620309051
1476823,4,B00005JM0B,"This is the newest film in the Terminator franchise.  The first two films were directed by James Cameron, but a new director has taken the reins for this one.  The director is Jonathon Mostow (U-571, Breakdown).  I was a little nervous going into this movie because of this change in the director.  James Cameron had made two classic, genre defining films that pushed the special effects teams to the limits (especially on Terminator 2).  Mostow had a lot to live up to and I wasn't confident that he could do the job.  I was wrong.  Mostow did not make a Terminator movie the way that James Cameron would have done, but he made a worthy entry into the Terminator franchise.
One thing to note about this movie is that it is not nearly as gritty (emotionally or in the content of the movie) as the first two Terminator movies (especially not as much as the first one).  While this uses the elements and story of the Terminator franchise, this is not a hard science fiction film but more of an action film.  It also works very well on this level.  Here is the back story that we know going into this movie: In the near future all of our lives will be run through computers.  Our military will use one great supercomputer to manage the military functions.  This computer will become self-aware and take control of the world through computers (which run everything).  There will be a war between man and machine and the machines will win.  Humans will be almost wiped from the face of the planet until there are only small pockets of resistance left.  One man will rise to lead the humans: John Connor.  In the first Terminator movie, the machines sent a Terminator back in time to kill John's mother.  John sent back a man who would become his father to protect Sarah Connor.  In the second Terminator movie, the machines sends back an advanced model to kill a 13 year old John Connor.  The model that was sent back to kill Sarah in the first movie was sent back in time to protect John in the second movie.  This brings us to the third Terminator movie.  John Connor (Nick Stahl) is now in his 20's.  His mother has died of Leukemia and John is living on the fringes of society.  He lives in such a way that there is no record of his existence (he works on the theory that if he can't be found, he can't be killed).  He lives a gloomy existence because even though the judgement day in 1997 has come and past without incident, he doesn't really feel that it is over.  A new Terminator T-X (Kristanna Loken) has been sent back to kill both John Connor, but failing that to kill the men and women who will become his lieutenants in the resistance against the machines.
The T-X appears to be an updated version of the T-1000 that Robert Patrick played in Terminator 2.  The T-X is also made of the liquid metal that the T-1000 was, but there are added abilities.  One: the T-X has functional weapons built into it.  The T-X can turn its arm into a gun/flamethrower and various other weapons.  The other major upgrade is that the T-X can remotely control other machines.  This provides for a rather impressive chase sequence involving a van, cop cars, fire engines and one bulky vehicle with a crane.  The T-X was also designed to destroy other Terminators.  To protect John Connor, the Arnold model from the first two movies is sent back to protect John and Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), the woman who would become John's second in command.  The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenneger) is an outdated model but was the only one the resistance was able to capture and reprogram.
This is the set up for the movie.  Kate is the disbelieving woman that Sarah Connor was in the first movie, but there is great chemistry between John and Kate and this helps the movie a lot.
One thing that The Terminator tells John is that the Judgement Day has not been stopped, only delayed and that it is still coming...very soon.  As you can tell from the subtitle of the movie: Rise of the Machines, the machine uprising begins during this movie.  I mentioned that this movie didn't have the grit of the previous movies, and this is true, but it is not a very upbeat film and with the Machines beginning the war we are not given a very happy movie.  We are given a good one, though.  Terminator 3 is not perfect, but it far exceeded my expectations.",1057536000,2,4322,4.479539641943734
1476824,5,B00005JM0B,"...So while I had to see the film I really expected it to be an exercise in ""cashin' in"" by the production company, Arnold, et al.  WRONG!!  They did a great job at weaving together an interesting story with a plausible explanation as to why there was a story here to be told.
This movie is not ""GREAT"" in the context of being filled with original ideas.  However, it tells a new story in a fresh and original way.  Plus, it opens the door for some interesting story ideas for the future and a new direction for possible story continuations to go into.  I did not see this film so much as a sequel, rather, I saw it as a pivotal film upon which the saga can turn and go into a different direction of storytelling; assuming the financing and interest is there.  I gave this film 5 stars because it surprised me and it was not predictable.  The action scenes were fun and the story compelling and when the end arrived I had to admit that I simply did not see it coming.",1057536000,,967,4.2228260869565215
1476825,1,B00005JM0B,"The very fact that James Cameron didn't work behind the scenes should have been enough hint for me not bother wasting money on this movie. It wasn't, because like so many other Terminator fans I gave the film a chance.
And wasted 2 hours of my life.
Nothing original appears in film; every action scene and most dialog between the actors are recycled information from the first two movies. Nothing happens that's remotely exciting or even intense--the action is the same action from T2. Basically, nothing happens that even the youngest of moviegoers can't predict. Even the ending was cliche -- yes, of COURSE the attack happens else AI wouldn't exist to bother the Connors in the first place. And, of course, there's no central computer! Should that have been surprising? Where does everyone think the 'Net exists? In their microwave? Give me a freakin break.
I have no problem with the female terminator - it's not truly female anyway so why call it ""Terminatrix?"" - but she did the exact same things the T-1000 did and, of course, failed.  The ""good"" terminator was way out of character, which wasn't cool at all. Down right frustrating at times. One would think, after the last two attempts on Jon's life, that Jon's future self  (or whoever) would place some modifications on the newly re-programmed good terminator, but I guess us measly humans aren't as practical as AI.
This wasn't a terminator movie; it was a bad attempt to make one.",1057536000,2,1444,4.795180722891566
1476826,3,B00005JM0B,"Why didn't the T1000 in Terminator 2 simply go back in time to the day before Sarah Conner met Reese and Arnold from the first movie? Why wait ""ten"" years? Surely his advanced design would have been no match for Reese and the then unprepared Sarah Conner. It's always bothered me. Same here with T3. We're told John Conner is ""living off the grid,"" so SkyNet can't find him. But guess what? SkyNet has a time machine, so who cares if he can be found in 2003? It can send a Terminator after him at any point in time (come on SkyNet...think three-dimensionally!) If SkyNet is so damn adamant about killing John Conner, all it needs to do is send one Terminator after another to the same day in time until the job is done. Better yet, go back in time and kill Sarah Conner when she's a kid, or kill her great-grandfather. All time travel movies have ridiculous plot holes of similar lines, but for some reason I'm less able to suspend belief with the Terminator series. I love the action, Arnold is as cool as always, and you can't go wrong with Clare Danes. But SkyNet is a pretty stupid super-computer.",1057449600,2,1101,4.428571428571429

Truthfully, I probably would have waited until the movie was on DVD before watching if Kristanna Loken wasn't in it... hehe  I still remember her from the days of the Mortal Kombat tv series.",1057449600,,471,4.777777777777778
1476828,5,B00005JM0B,"I have to admit that I was somewhat leery going into this movie seeing as how James Cameron was not involved with the project. Maybe that wasn't such a bad thing after all. I've always been impressed with how T2 was such a huge success. One of the few movie sequels out there that in many people's opinion surpassed its predecessor. I have to say though that this one may even surpass Terminator 2 in its entertainment value. In my opinion, this movie is better than the first two. It has a better plot, better acting (you can't honestly say that T2's John Connor was decent acting), better action, better FX; you name it, it's bigger and better. The action sequences were phenomenal, namely the scene with the crane and the bathroom brawl between Schwarzenegger and T-X. The plot was very well established and left nothing to be desired. The idea of armageddon is a frightening yet fascinating concept and while the idea of the movie may be far-fetched, the Terminator series was obviously never meant to be believable. The movie was excellent at blending various emotions to a perfect degree of balance: humor, despair, love; nothing was overdone. There was no excessive emphasis on the love story, as has ruined so many movies that were intended to be action films, and the comedy relief was placed at opportune points to relay the awkwardness of human interaction with a machine, perfectly in balance with the rest of the movie so as not to get in the way of the more important parts. And the ending was a perfect twist to an excellent story (I would've have felt somewhat disappointed if they had succeeded at stopping Judgment Day). It leaves one wondering about when another Terminator will be made (the hints were fairly obvious). I would assume they would be inclined to begin work on it soon as Arnold isn't exactly in his golden years. And how anyone could possibly be fans of the original two movies and dislike this one is beyond my scope of comprehension. Needless to say I was impressed with this movie and would highly recommend it to anyone that is a fan of the first two or just a movie fan in general.",1057449600,,2120,4.625994694960212

 To be honest I didn't think it would be nearly as good as t2, but in fact I think that it stood up to T2 LIKE NOBODY's BUSINESS.  All the naysayers talking badly about Nick Stahl (NEW JOHN CONNOR) need to wake up and think about this for a second, Ed Furlong(OLD JOHN CONNOR) played Connor as a ten year old, though sorely out of the age range, Connor has changed so much you need a new actor, I think he was awesome.  Also Arnold is better than ever.  Did I mention some of the best R rated humor ever.
I nominate this film in my book, and I have watched many many movies this year, as one of the best films of the year.

1476893,5,B00005JM0B,"I feared the worst for Terminator 3. Its premise is almost identical to T2's (Schwarzenegger Terminator heads back in time to save John Connor), the ads looked terrible, and on paper, this looked like the pitch perfect example of a popular series ruined by money-hungry studio executives. While I have no doubt the producers of this film acted out of greed, I can safely say my fears were unfounded. Terminator 3 is easily the summer's best pure blockbuster.
It's been several years since John Connor (played by Nick Stahl) helped bring down Skynet. But he's still frightened by the possibilities of the future, so he spends his days as a wandering nomad, his identity deleted, hopefully making him impossible to detect. His fears prove justified. A new design, the Terminatrix (Kristanna Loken), is sent back in time to assassinate Connor and his future lieutenants. As before, a Terminator who resembles Arnold Schwarzenegger is sent as Connor's lone protector. Added into the crisis is Kate Brewster (Clair Danes), whose presence will play a vital role into the fate of the planet's future.
The possible signs of sequilitis are present here, but despite essential similarities to T2 director Jonathan Mostow crafts the movie with a look and feel that separates it from its predecessors, but does so without betraying its roots. That's a pretty fantastic accomplishment. But before I make T3 sound like nothing more than a high-gloss rip-off,the movie does deliver an engaging story filled with genuine surprises and complications. It works as a continuation of its predecessor's legacy, and surprisingly, never feels the slightest bit gratuitous.
The action sequences are the movie's highlight, especially an astounding car chase that puts the one in The Matrix Reloaded to shame. Expect shootouts and plenty of explosions, but delivered with flair and energy. The last half-hour is virtually non-stop action, and Mostow maintains a high pitch of intensity. Most impressive of all is the one-on-one showdown between the Terminators, probably the most exhilarating action setpiece I've seen all year.
What surprised me the most was the attention paid to the characters. Nick Stahl's portrayal of John Connor is entirely likeable and convincing, blowing all memories of Edward Furlong's annoying performance to dust. Clair Danes, who I've never been a big fan of, is also quite good as the requisite-but-not-quite love interest (I loved the twist involving her character and the Terminator).
Schwarzenegger puts forth his most memorable portrayal of a Terminator, playing his role with a great sense of circumstantial humor. T3 is packed with big laughs (the best being the sunglassses bit), thanks mostly to Schwarzenegger's sense of comic timing. This is his comeback piece, and it's good to see the big lug back and better than ever. As his villainous counterpart, Kristanna Loken is imposing as the Terminatrix, and bound to drive male teens crazy with her great figure (her nude scene frustratingly shows very little).
Terminator 3's countdown to worldwide armageddon adds a sense of desperation its predecessors were missing. The suspenseful build-up concludes satisfyingly in an ending that actually surprised and delighted me. Sure, the set up leaves another sequel a possibility, but I actually can't wait for a Terminator 4.",1057449600,,3335,5.2706766917293235
1476894,4,B00005JM0B,"The first TERMINATOR was all about story.  Watching a film like that is a rare treat due to a tight, complex, action packed storyline that relied on plot twists and stylish thrills to entertain.  I heard CAMERON originally wanted the movie to have the T-1000 as the antagonist but the budget would't allow it and the fx had, of course, not been developed yet.  Still the best and most somber of the series, the first film is the coolest independant sci-fi movie I've seen.
  T2 was the groundbreaker.  Never before had I left the theater as blown away by the sheer size of a film.  With a compelling story still intact, the fx were nothing short of jaw-droppingly super-cool.  Set the bar really, really high on what summer movie watching was all about.  Probably the best summertime extavaganza since the original STAR WARS.  The action in this flick is top-notch and better that most released today, over ten years later.  A motion picture that truly defines and redefines the term blockbuster.
  TERMINATOR 3-RISE OF THE MACHINES is the popcorn movie.  With some of the melancholy of the first film and some excellent set pieces of unadulterated mayhem, this entry in the series is just plain fun.  Upon first hearing about this release I had to groan because I belived everything had been covered in the other installments.  The script is just right with quick, snappy expainations and narrative.  The true treat of the film is watching ARNOLD ham it up (which I thought would've gotten old by now but still works somehow) and the exhillarating chases and action.  Avoiding the occasional cheesy line is impossible, but all and all a fine entry in a great franchise.  A matinee sci-fi/action flick with all the thrills and chills needed for a good time.
  Due to the erie conclusion of the third picture maybe the creators will actually make, what I've thought all along would be cool, an HBO mini-series about the future war events leading up to the victory of the humans and the destuction of the time-travelling device.  Could just be wishful thinking but I'd hate to see the end of an exciting series like THE TERMINATOR.",1057449600,2,2129,4.759562841530054
1476895,4,B00005JM0B,"Given that James Cameron wasn't involved in the making of this film and that ""The Terminator"" is his baby, his creation, one would've expected his involvement.  Take that and the fact that ""T2 Judgment Day"" seemed to put an end to Skynet and the horrible future created for this outstanding series and one might've expected the plot to be thin but that simply isn't the case.  This film does an outstanding job of extending the ""Terminator"" mythos and series as a whole!
The premise:
As we all learned in ""T2 Judgment Day,"" seemingly all possibilities for Skynet to come into existence and launch its war against humanity are supposedly eliminated by that films Terminator, and Sarah and John Connor.  That isn't the case though as it seems that Skynet is an inescapable factor, leading to its taking control of every computer on the planet and waging its war against humanity.  Hence, we have the ""purpose"" for this film and the purpose for the Terminatrix to be sent back in order to once again chase down John Connor who is now in his early twenties.  Now we also have the purpose for Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator to make his trip through time to protect John Connor and others...  What follows is a well done film that is extreme in the action sequences and a fairly well laid out plot.  The Terminatrix is definitely a thrilling villain against Arnold's Terminator.
I'd say that my first impression of the film after this first viewing is that yes, it's a good film to go to the theater to watch and yes, even though one might think they couldn't extend the story after T2, it does.  In the final analysis though, when one compares the depth of the stories told in the first two films, one can definitely see that the series creator, James Cameron, either wasn't involved at all or at the least he wasn't involved much!  Which is pretty much why I can only give this film four stars!
Would I recommend that you go see this film, yes it is worth it!  Would I buy the DVD when it's released, yes!  {ssintrepid}

The movie plot is similar to the previous Terminator films, but the newest terminator (the terminatrix or TX) has a few new tricks up its sleeve.

Turns out I didn't really have to worry about the context of a Post-Matrix world ruining T3...cause it's simply a bad enough movie in its own right.
Where to start?  Well, first how about the fact that the whole movie up until the last ten minutes, is a complete re-tread of T2.  Evil, more advanced terminator comes back from the future to kill John Conner...Arnold, our beloved good and less advanced terminator arrives just in time to save him.  They fight a bunch and the good guys eventually decide to attempt destroying Skynet, thereby escaping fate.  Same old ground, not much new.
Oh, but there IS a new, more advanced evil terminator...a combination of the two previous terminators with a few added bonuses...like she can network with other machines.  She uses this ability to go online through a telephone and retrieve information and command a squad of driverless police cars to chase our fleeing heroes.  Now, I'll admit, this is an interesting idea but beyond the two instances mentioned above, it's barely utilized.  Instead they focus more on what weapons she can turn her arms into.  Also, she doesn't seem very threatening due to the fact that she's defeated WAY too easily.  In T2 it took the combined efforts of John & Sara Connor, and Arnold's terminator to triumph...here Arnold pretty much does it himself, and in much less dramatic fashion.  John Connor and his future wife Kate are pretty much useless.
And there's another problem...the non-terminator heroes in T2 were likable...vulnerable but tough, they at least never gave up despite seemingly impossible odds.  T3, on the other hand, is an endless stream of giving up, and here is where the series really suffers to the loss of Sara Conner as a character.  The grown up John Connor is not the boy we remember...he's become a useless whiner.  Claire Daines' Kate isn't much more likable...she's pretty much just ""there"" as the two machines duke it out.  Uninspired performances and a horrid script lend a hand in creating two characters I truly couldn't care less about.  FINALLY, in the last ten minutes of the film, they stand up for themselves.  I'll admit, the ending was the one good thing about the film...interesting and gusty...but without anything of merit leading up to it, it wasn't enough.
Among the list of other problems with T3 is the awful musical score, or lack thereof (almost non-existent...it left scenes that could have been emotional seem hollow).  There are GIANT plot holes...for example, if the evil terminator can control vehicles to chase our heroes, why can't she just stop our heroes' vehicle?  And how exactly our heroes gain access to the heart of a top secret military facility is never explained.  The action scenes which may have seemed great in 1993 were nothing new, since The Matrix and other films have constantly been upping the ante.  Like the fight that consists of Arnold and Kristanna Lokin constantly slamming each other's heads into toilet bowls...how thrilling.  All in all a horrid film, bland in so many ways, albeit with a somewhat interesting ending.  My prediction that a post-Matrix Terminator movie wouldn't work at all has come true...",1057363200,18,3427,4.9527972027972025
1476900,4,B00005JM0B,"I already despised this film before I even went to go see it.  How on earth can you have a Terminator film without Cameron or at least 2 of the 3 key actors?  Well, they did just that and it was actually enjoyable.  This film is loaded with humor, not the self-contained kind from T2 but rather a sort of homage to the previous two films.  Sure this is the easy way to do it in a trilogy, but it also has a familiar warmth about it.  And the homages don't just stop at the humor but encompass many aspects of the film.  This does give you the sense that they're running out of ideas, but I highly doubt that.  Most of this was on purpose, though it certainly does cost the film somewhat in the depth department to take this route.
There are two aspects of this film that truly make it shine.  First, Claire Danes is an absolutely wonderful actress.  If she hadn't been cast in this role the project would have been doomed.  She brings depth and humanity to a movie that already has us trying to empathize with a robot and another actor filling in someone else's role.  Second, we get a nice take on the other films' mantra of ""There's no future but what we make for ourselves.""  Now, imagine John Conner is a bit of an optimist who simply will not accept the laws of temporal mechanics.  That it'd take his pragmatic wife to make the tough decision to ensure their survival at all costs is a heck of a great idea.  The lengths we learn she is (will be) willing to go through, including allowing the T-101 to lie to her, is a wonderful development on the part of the writers.  The only people who could conceivably have a problem with this is the hardcore Terminator 2 fan, who believes that mantra defines the first two films and throwing it out would simply make a mockery of the series.  But since that's not me, it becomes a plus in my book.
I do have some problems with this film, though.  I know the actor who played John Conner before isn't exactly considered very reliable anymore, but getting someone else is at least as bad as being stuck with the other guy.  This other actor is definitely talented, but it's an unavoidable emotional leap and, resultantly, a drawback for the audience.  It feels at times like a soap opera, a franchise that can't be shut down...kind of like ER nowadays.  The actors become interchangable, and that's a shame.
Next, there's a scene in an Air Force hanger that is atrocious in almost every way.  Without any sort of earlier set up, we suddenly learn that Danes' character was taught how to fly in the very trainer they're running towards.  All the writers had to do was have her reminisce about her dad teaching her how to fly at some earlier point in the film, and there were plenty of opportunities for this when John and she are just talking.
Then we have the T-101's hokey melt down in that same hanger.  The concept of this occurring is perfectly fine, but it's executed in a less than satisfying manner.  Even worse, as John's heading back to the plane he explains (!!!) exactly what we just saw for us with that special oh-so-succinct insight that poorly written ""informative"" dialog tends to have.  Simply put, the hanger scene needed major revision and reshooting.
Finally, the climax of the film at the blast door doesn't feel very climatic.  When we got there and the intensity suddenly revs back up, I had to think to myself ""Oh, this must be the climax.""  That's never a good sign.  The film actually felt like we had a ways more to go, as the intensity had not properly been built up during the preceding scenes to justify the emotional catharsis of the climax.  This might sound a little intellectual, but it's precisely because it was not quite instinctively and emotionally satisfying during this scene that I'm forced to use the left side of my brain to discuss it.
Even with this said, the resolution of the film is satisfying, so all is not lost.  As you can tell I liked the film and am not holding it up to a higher standard than would be justified.  The film is entertaining.  Danes is great.  The humor and homages made me chuckle.  The chase scenes are good.  Sure a lot of the CGI has that soft Star Trek Nemesis look, but the attention to little details like the sand turning into glass from the heat of the time portal made me sit up in my seat.  And last but not least, we get to find out how Skynet was going to be developed whether the original terminator had been sent back or not.  It's not a great film, but considering how low my expectations were I'd say it was definitely worth seeing.  Maybe now they can immediately make a sequel where we see the initial coping with the holocaust and the rise of the resistance up to the climatic sending of the first terminator.  Michael Biehn could certainly be recast for his role, entering the film in the second half.  I'd pay money to see that T4.",1057363200,,4868,4.407614781634939

1476960,3,B00005JM0B,"Beginning 10 years after T2, and 6 years after his mother Sara Conners death, John Conner is a pitiful wreck; with no Judgement Day to hone his leadership skills on he becomes a wandering drunken cyclist with a thing for animal tranquilizers.
This changes soon enough. The latest Terminator to be sent back, the T-X is an amalgam of the T-101 and the T-100: this means it can bring back complicated weapons from the future and still morph into others when necessary (to geeks who ask how it could come back at all, being non-organic, think; it probably had a sheath of skin cells over it during transport).
Its goal is to kill Conner's future leiutenants, who help in overthrowing Skynet. Conner himself becomes a secondary target.
However, he has to save his future second-in-command (and wife)
from the T-X. Problem is: daddy is in charge of the Skynet project, which is about to be unleashed to correct an internet virus that future Skynet initiated to ensure its creation.
Sounds deep? Maybe. But you'd never know it past the the crash-em-ups and neat booms. This is a dumbed-down version of T2 with an ending which should have come as a shock but instead seems not only predictable but boring.
It's still good escapist fun, with Ah-nuld giving as good as he ever has (the strip club and Elton John sunglasses were a nice twist on an old joke). Claire Danes has little to do here but scream and cry. The T-X never really becomes as menacing as either of the earlier models.

1476961,3,B00005JM0B,"""Terminator 3-Rise of the Machines"" is really one of those movies that didn't have to be made. That saying alot from a person that who really loved the first two movies. This was a movie that had problems from the beginning. Both James Cameron and Linda Hamilton both passed on working movie. The actress that played Kate Brewster was replaced by Claire Danes after two days of filming. And Edward Furlong who played John Conner was not in the movie either.
The actual storyline seemed like a rehash of Terminator 2. If they wanted to make it interesting they should have picked the movie up after Judgement Day and show the humans trying fight back against the machines.
Over all, unless you a big fan of the movies or Arnold you just might want to wait till it comes DVD.",1057363200,,773,4.5285714285714285

The Special Effects were Phenomonal. The car chase scene in T3 easily beats the Chase scene in T2, with John Connor on the bike and the T-1000 in the big rig. The story was true to the series, and didn't have any problems with the previous Terminator movies. Everything rings true. The acting is awesome. Overall, i don't think any action movie will ever top Terminator 2. But this latest installment is the next best thing. It DESTROYS the matrix reloaded, even though some thought it wouldn't. all in all, the best movie i've seen all year.",1057363200,,685,4.444444444444445
1476963,5,B00005JM0B,"I have to admit, I was a little skeptical if this movie would be good.  James Cameron and Linda Hamilton didn't participate (in which case, the writers had her character, Sarah Connor, dead before the film started), so naturally that was a concern for me.  Arnold Schwarzenegger, however, decided to join up because the script was pretty good, and after I heard that Jonathan Mostow (""U571"") was directing, my fears were put away and I laid out some hope.
After watching it, I was blown away.  It wasn't overdone and over the top; it REALLY was a Terminator film!  Director Mostow kept the film fresh but also using numerous hints to the previous Terminator films.  Nick Stahl was good as John Connor (am I the ONLY one that didn't care for Edward Furlong??) and Claire Danes did ok as John's soon-to-be wife.  And of course, I can't write this review without mentioning Kristanna Loken as the evil T-X (a.k.a. Terminatrix... sounds like a Matrix cash-in, but oh well); incredibly sexy and deadly at the same time.
And finally, of course, we have Arnold back and he seriously doesn't look any older than he did back in 1991.  This guy's 60 now and he played the part as if he was merely on vacation from doing the previous Terminator film!  Oh, and remember Dr. Silberman (Earl Boen) from the first two?  Watch out for his amusing cameo.
The action hardly lets up and while I don't want to compare it to the other Terminators, I will say this: the action hardly lets up, which is something T2 should've done.  Also, I enjoyed the dark ending with its nefarious plot twist.
While it did have its plot holes, it didn't detract from the film much at all.  It kept to the style of the Terminator films, but seemed fresh and new at the same time.  That is probably its greatest merit, and boy, does Mr. Mostow bring the film to life.
As for you people [complaining] about no James Cameron, get your heads out of your [.....] and accept the film.  The movie did great without him and let me remind you that the film still has producers Mario Kassar (T2) and Gale Ann Hurd (Cameron's ex-wife AND CO-CREATOR OF THE TERMINATOR) and creative makeup artist Stan Winston behind the scenes, so they have an idea of Cameron's vision.  With that said, just sit back and enjoy.",1057363200,2,2261,4.550617283950618
1476964,5,B00005JM0B,"After reading online reviews both pro and con and the lack of James Cameron helming this film I walked in with low expectations. I was begining to despair that Summer Blockbusters were all going to be vanilla PG-13 affairs. Director Jonathan Mostow has succesfully brought back THE action, R-Rated Blockbuster with T-3. This movie was quite a surprise. It starts well and keeps you enthralled the whole way through. The special effects are way better than the early trailers, the action amazing, and the story a thoughtful evolution from T2. Arnold's back in full force, Kristanna Loken as the TX is both menacing AND sexy. Nick Stahl could have possibly been better as John Conner but doesn't detract from the film. Even Claire Danes, who I normally dislike was good. One of the most surprising things about this film is how funny it is, both with dialogue and situations. It's clearly self-parodying without being too campy. More than T2 I think Mostow has captured the feel of one-ton killing machines fighting each other with Hulk-like ferocity. Also at several points the audience screamed from violent or ""shocking"" bits.. all in all it was a great movie experience that has action, comedy and some scares. Go see it and let's bring back the R-Rated Summer Blockbusters of old! ;-)",1057276800,,1287,4.908256880733945

A lot of questions in T2 were answered, but they still left themselves room to make T4. Don't expect too much from the new special effects. Anyway that was offset by the nonstop action from the begining till the end--I felt the same way as when I watched ""the Speed."" Arnold's tradmark humour was still evident in the movie. All the new faces did their job pretty impressively. If you don't compare T3 with T2, I'm sure you will love this movie!",1057276800,,599,4.445454545454545
1476966,4,B00005JM0B,"THIS IS NOT AS GOOD AS T2 BUT A GREAT ACTION FILM. Critics of this film are unfairly penalizing it because it is was not directed by James Cameron, is missing Linda Hamilton, and is not as great as T2. However, there were two choices - either end the series after T2, which certainly would have been understandable and in many ways seemed to be implied by the satisfyingly seeming finality of that film, or adapt to the current realities and produce a sequel. I am very glad that they chose to produce this sequel, I enjoyed it tremendously and think Jonathan Mostow did a very credible job as the director given the constraints of the story as developed in the first two films.
Of course, while the film stands alone as an action adventure story, any viewer who has not seen the two earlier Terminator films will not be able to put either the events in this film or the criticism of it in the proper context. No lengthy descrition of the storyline is necessary - John Conner (Nick Stahl) has remained on the run and seemingly invisible since T2 (just in case another Terminator tries to hunt him down). Also, it turns out that the Skynet project has not been permanently derailed, but only temporarily delayed. Suddenly, the timelines of these two elements of the film intersect. An advanced TX-model Terminator (Kristanna Loken) arrives to eliminate John and his friends who will comprise the Resistance Movement in the future. Meanwhile, the Skynet project is moving toward activation. Very conveniently (one of the weak spots of the script), the TX locates John while searching for his HS friend Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) after John has unknowingly broken into the veterinary hospital where Kate works. And then, just to make sure that the plot is easy to understand and the movie can concentrate on the action, Kate's father happens to be the general in charge of the Skynet project. As the entire moviegoing populace is aware, Arnold Schwarzenegger reprises his role as an ""obsolete"" T-101 model that has been sent to protect John and replace the model that liquidated itself in T2,
So, the battle is joined. Arnie looks great for a 55 year old, the three hour a day exercise regimen makes him virtually indistinguishable from the version of twelve years ago. The new TX model has better tools than the version in T2, and while Loken has been critized for her impassive performance, it is one of the great aspects of the film - she is supposed to be a machine. The action scenes are very long but never boring, although they may go over the top in a few instances. The general tenor of the film is very reminiscent of T2, and several of the sequences closely reprise similar aspects of that film.
This film is less satisfying than the earlier films in three respects. First, there is nothing radically new and different, either with regard to the technology or the story, Second, Arnie's one liners are not as memorable and the repatee in general not as consistently clever. Third, the ending is relatively downbeat and is only satisfactory if there is a sequel, it does not stand on its own. So don't expect the near perfection and leading edge quality of T2, but this is nevertheless a very good story.
 While I was initially disappointed by the ending, upon reflection I realized that it was the only conclusion which made sense. As the title states, this movie is about THE RISE OF THE MACHINES. As we await the hoped for sequel, we are left to ponder one of the recurrent questions asked by great science fiction -  whether history can be truly rewritten and fate changed by future events or whether the truly major events in human history are largely foreordained and any attempts to alter them doomed to failure.",1057276800,,3728,4.698776758409786

1477024,4,B00005JM0B,"TERMINATOR 3 is a well-crafted film that continues the present and future history of the war between humanity and the machines that scientists thought would enhance the security of human beings. The first entry was done straight with the focus on Arnold Schwarzenegger as the unstoppable killing machine sent back to 1984 to kill the mother of the future leader of human resistance.  The sequel shifted gears to emphasize the then state of the art special effects that nevertheless took a back seat both to the fine acting of Linda Hamilton and to an unexpectedly softer side of an Arnold who could add resonance to a character that did not dominate dramatically as it did in the original.  But by this newest entry, Director David Mostow leans more to the second for dramatic inspiration and acknowledges the first mostly in humorous allusions.  The evil Terminatrix, played expressionless by Kristanna Loken, is no more than an eye candy reincarnation of the role first played by Robert Patrick, who nevertheless, managed to invest his character with purpose and some unexpected humor.  Miss Loken says little and emotes less.  One could argue that a cybernetic killing machine truly ought to carry out its function with emotionless purpose, yet both Patrick and Schwarzeneggar were killing machines that were fun to watch. The lack of Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor forced Director Mostow to rely on the secondary characters to maintain interest.  Arnold, of course, did his bit.  Even at 55, he still looks big and menacing enough to be convincing.  Further, his often overlooked comic side appears frequently enough to invest his character with flair and audience identification.  Nick Stahl as John Connor and Claire Danes as Kate Brewster try hard to duplicate the mother-son chemistry that worked so well with Edward Furlong and Linda Hamilton of T2.  But in this case, their characters seem to have been developed on the fly. They meet, they argue, they fight first each other then the Terminatrix; then they are told they will fall in love.  Throughout most of the film, they seem uncomfortable in their scenes together.
Characterization was clearly not the intent of T3.  This film was chock full of an incredible number of car crashes, truck runaways, explosions, and body morphing.  There were the usual number of retreads from the first T film, including numerous variations on 'I'll be back' to the reappearance of the police psychiatrist who mumbles on about how this newest feminine killing machine could no more be real than the Arnold whose cybernautic traits were obvious to everyone except himself.  There were a few logical flaws too. Why would the United States have created the prototype of the silver-skinned terminators and have so conveniently stacked them under plastic so they could be used against humanity?  Further, you would think that the originators of Skynet would have seen THE FORBIN PROJECT and have deduced that it would be unwise to turn over computer control of this country to a self-aware mechanical intelligence.  Still, the strong points of T3 outweigh its shortcomings.  What I liked was the careful working out of a future history that, in whose present terrors, overlaps a time that is right here on our doorsteps.  The closing scenes hint that there will be a T4 film, that may not include an aging Arnold.  For this proposed next film, I suggest a more emotional and hence more believable android protagonist who can continually remind us that greatness in a hero is measured mostly by greatness in the villain.",1057276800,,3562,5.016977928692699

1477028,4,B00005JM0B,"When I heard that Terminator 3 was coming out last year, I immediately thought to myself 'They're taking it too far.'  When I found out that egotistical Cameron was not doing this film, my expectations were lowered considerably, because T2 was probably one of the greatest films of all time.  But I saw Terminator 3 on opening day, and I must say I was thoroughly impressed.
Terminator 3 is exactly what you would expect it to be: a sequel.  Heavy on action, somewhat lighter on plot.  But don't get me wrong...T3 has a great story.  I didn't think they would be able to explain Skynet very well after the end of T2, but they did, and rather nicely I might add.
T3 is in no way meant to be better than Terminator 2.  It never can be.  As I mentioned earlier, T2 stands as probably one of the greatest films in the entire history of film making.  But T3 tries very hard to live up to those expectations.  The action scenes in the film are so intense that you'll be clenching your fists and sitting on the edge of your seat.  The effects are very impressive and there are enough explosions and special effects to knock you into next week.  The acting is fairly decent.  The entire cast is new other than Arnold (and another familiar, comical appearence which I won't spoil), and so it leaves a bit of a sour taste in the mouth.  The acting isn't bad, but the characters aren't very recognizable.  Despite this, it is pulled off rather well.
I am impressed that the series was picked up by someone other than Cameron.  Given what the director had to work with, he did a very good job.  However, there are terribly glaring mistakes in this film which throw off the timeline of the entire movie.  It is clear that the director did not consult the previous films whatsoever for research.  The film indicates that John Connor was 13 years old during the events of Terminator 2, but he was actually only 10 years old.  Were he to be 13 years old, Terminator 2 would have taken place in 1997, which means that the rest of the events mentioned in T2 and the events in T3 would be completely thrown off track.  This is an easy error to fix when they transfer it to DVD, but it is an obvious and glaring mistake to Terminator fans (it takes the quality of the movie down an entire star).
That's the only real gripe with the film.  Otherwise, the story is done quite well.  There are twists in this film that are just completely unexpected and add to the quality of the story.  The ending is also very memorable...one of the best and most unexpected endings I've seen in a film in a long, long time.  This film is also alot more comical than previous films.  In Terminator 2 the humor was subtle and light, where in this film it is blatantly obvious, which is good as it releives alot of the tension that the film creates.
Here's a tip if you plan to see this movie: it is absolutely unfair to compare this movie to Terminator 2.  It is a different movie.  Terminator 2 was very emotional, very dramatic, and very intense with its delivery.  Terminator 3 is in-your-face action.  The great bulk of the Terminator story was told in Terminator and Terminator 2.  Terminator 3 could be considered the climax...the plot is very good, but it doesn't need as much explanation, since that was taken care of in the previous 2 movies.
I went into this movie expecting a flop, and I was very pleasantly surprised.  T3 is a solid film that will keep you interested in its story and on the edge of your seat with its effects.  Go to this movie expecting a good film.  Don't expect another T2.  As long as you follow that criteria you will enjoy this film.  T3 was definitely a great addition to the Terminator series, even if the director just blatantly disregarded the chronology of the previous 2 films.  I try not to notice that, but its too obvious.
And on a final note: T-X has nothing on the T-1000.  She may be tough, but the T-1000 was slick and clever.  I missed the T-1000 alot in this film.",1057190400,,3976,4.395890410958904
1477029,3,B00005JM0B,"The bottom line with Terminator 3 is action, and you certainly get plenty of it with this movie.  The action sequences and fight scenes go above and beyond anything seen in the first two Terminator movies, and are pretty much non-stop throughout.  However, take those action scenes out, and you are left with a very bad movie.  So I am fifty fifty on this one, I was entertained and it was worth seeing, but it comes nowhere near the overall appeal of T2.
What bothered me most about T3 was that it constantly attempts to play the audience for cheap laughs, mostly based on references to T1 and T2 and Arnold's now overly cliched one-liners.  What made T2 work so well was that it took itself seriously for the most part, but sprinkled in just the right amount of humor here and there to keep things light.  T3 on the other hand seriously borders on camp, and the corny jokes become tedious about half way through the movie.
As for the new TX, although we get many glimpses of the powers that make her the ""ultimate killing machine"", she is not much more intimidating than the T1000 was in the second movie.
What did satisfy me about T3 was the explanation given as to why this sequel was necessary, considering things seemed tied up pretty neatly at the end of T2.  Also, the movie manages to make its own significant contribution to the ongoing storyline of the war between man and machine.  In the end, we do see the story move forward, which is important considering that most of the surface plot of T3 is basically T2 rehashed.
Overall, the absence of Linda Hamilton on screen and James Cameron behind the camera is at times painfully obvious, but T3 still manages to be a visual thrill ride.  It is truly a summer blockbuster in the truest sense, action packed, fun, at times corny, but ulimately pretty enjoyable.",1057190400,3,1820,4.54434250764526

This movie is basically the second installment in the series, except worse.  I didn't TOTALLY hate the movie, but it isn't all that great.  John Connor is now 18, and the Revolution of the machines against the humans is about to begin.  A new Terminator model called the T-X or Terminatrix, is sent from the future to kill him and an older model, the T-800, (Schwarzenegger) is sent to protect him...same as the second one.  There is a hint at the end of the movie that there will be a fourth one.  Anyway, see it, but don't expect it to be an extrordinary scifi action film like the others were.",1057190400,,758,4.57037037037037
1477210,3,B00005JM0B,"The good news is that although Terminator 3 is not as satisfying and well crafted as original ones it is still entertaining.  As far as an action a movie goes, T 3 is has it all.  There are gun battles, astonishing explosions, great robot against robot fight scenes, and a cool car chase.  In fact the car chase was so good that it even comes close challenging the throne of the Matrix Reloaded 14-minute gateway scene.
One of the reasons that made me go to see T 3 on the opening day was not so much a prospect of being entertained by an intense action/sci-fi but extreme curiosity on how this film actually turned out.  At first I refused to believe that the creators of T3 could pull off the same exact story of killer robot vs. the protector and actually make it interesting.  But I was wrong.  Even though the formula is recycled for the third time, it still has some pleasantly surprising freshness left in it.  I was happy to realize that for a moment I was so immersed in what was going on that I actually stopped thinking about how old Arnold really is.
Unfortunately, after walking out of the theater room I felt like there was something missing in T3.  I didn't get the same level of satisfaction as in previous Terminator movies.  The whole filmed seemed to be short and rushed.  The emotional involvement was shallower as well.  It was almost as if the director and actors wanted to get done with the whole deal as soon as possible so that they can start on a sequel.  And sequel there will be, for T3 end on rather depressing, sequel hungry point almost equivalent, once again, that of the Matrix Reloaded.
Another problem I found was that the actor chosen to play the threatening Terminatrix (Kristanna Loken) was in my opinion very poorly chosen.  To play a dangerous Terminator one should at least try to appear threatening.  Not for the sake of realism (having a look of a fragile woman is actually tactically deceiving) but for the sake of greater drama.  When looking at Kristanna I could not stop thinking of how beautiful she was and those thoughts alone overwritten the conception of her as a deadly cyborg; a cyborg we should be terrified by.  Kristanna's beauty counteracted her intended purpose of inspiring awe.  A perfect person for this role would actually be a bulky, mean-looking, cold-featured guy with an average mugger profile.
Even though T3 is not without glitches, I would strongly recommend this film to action fans.  Yes, it is unsatisfying and on top of it, it ends with yet unsatisfying ending.  Yes, it doesn't make us flex our brains or bite or nails with excitement.  And although it tries, it doesn't blow away an average movie fan with its CGI and action moments.  However, after the hard day of work, when it is time to rest and forget the day's worries, this is a good movie to relax to.",1057190400,,2835,4.563241106719367

All of these movies had awesome trailers and they were horrible. Terminator 3 thankfully holds up to my theory and delivers on every level a good action/sci-fi movie should.

1477213,3,B00005JM0B,"Anyone who saw the first movies and saw the trailer for T3 had to be thinking that this would be the same movie as T2, except with some hot babe replacing Robert Patrick. I entered the theater hoping against hope that it wasn't true, but since the theme of this movie is that some things are inevitable, perhaps it's appropriate that the owners of this franchise inevitably chose to cash in with this unoriginal sequel.
I'd cover the plot, but there are so many similarities and blatant knockoffs of the first two movies that it's almost glorious in its shamelessness. We get both Terminators beaming into the present in giant balls of energy, naked (for some reason the female Terminator can regenerate her leather jacket after explosions and collisions with walls and vehicles, yet when she teleports into the present she's naked, not that any of the male audience was complaining). We get the requisite scene where Arnie walks into a trashy bar naked, gets ogled by women, scans the crowd and finds someone with his same clothing dimensions wearing black leather. We get Arnie searching for dark sunglasses, because this robot with the funny German accent has a sense of humor. There's a scene where our hero is injured and the legless torso of a Terminator is crawling after him. And of course, we get numerous one-liners from Arnie, even more so than in the past, including one embarrassing moment when he holds someone off at arm's length and quips, ""Talk to the hand.""
Nick Stahl as John Connor and Claire Danes as his female sidekick are passable but have nothing of the emotional angst or range of Linda Hamilton. They are props in a series of long and actually quite well executed chase scenes. Hollywood has gotten to the point where a technically well-executed action sequence for a big budget film is required. Whereas T2 was a visual miracle in its time, the morphing of this female Terminator is now just ho-hum. That's either a good or bad thing depending on what kind of movie fan you are.
The only truly surprising thing to me was the ending. The movie avoids a pat Hollywood ending, which is nice. The general theme of the ending, though, is one which was set forth in the first two movies: if you send robots into the past to change the future, those robots merely set in motion a chain of events that creates that future (i.e. Linda Hamilton's guardian in the first movie becomes John Connor's father, and the chip in Arnie's arm becomes the key to actually building Skynet). If you create a series of two huge blockbuster movies starring Arnie, some Hollywood studio will be unable to resist the urge to create a mediocre, unoriginal cash-in sequel, even if the director of the first two (James Cameron) refuses to participate.
As an ardent fan of Terminator and a visual admirer of T2, I was hoping they'd leave the series alone, but that was human emotion talking. Arnie, a Terminator, divorced from human emotion, saw the inevitable. ""I'll be back,"" he promised. He was right.",1057190400,,3001,4.729007633587786

I also asked myself and a couple other friends the question we've all been asking ourselves after watching it, ""Is it better than the first and second ones?""... it was different and more fast-paced. Everything seemed to be happening at the heat of the moment more in this one. It was brilliantly done!",1057190400,,431,4.468354430379747
1477215,3,B00005JM0B,"The good news: T3 is a lot better than most of the Mostow-bashing folks (Like me) were expecting. The bad news: It's still not that great.
Watching ""Terminator 3"" was a lot like watching an imitation of ""Terminator 2"" and wishing that I could watch the real thing instead. And, in many respects, that's exactly what T3 is; an imitation.
For really great fans of the first two films, there are a lot of subtle details that really make a difference in the atmosphere. Brad Fiedel has been replaced as a composer - this actually is a noticeable difference, especially since virtually no music in T3 is synthesized (Or at least, it didn't SOUND like the Terminator style). Mostow's direction is somehow less interesting than Cameron's, and much less mysterious - part of the thrill of the first two Terminators for me was the suspense. Kyle wasn't really necessary, so he could easily die, Sarah Connor versus the T-1000 could end in any way without really affecting the fate of the world... Sure, you expected the good guys to win, but there was still a feeling that maybe - just maybe - something bad was going to happen.
That mood is really smashed to pieces in T3. It is easily one of the most predictable movies I've ever seen, from poorly executed plot twists to stupid one-liners.
The first two Terminator movies were dark and relatively serious, at times heavy-handed. This one is much breezier, despite the supposedly darker subject material. It's packed so full of camp and jokes that it could make your head spin.
For those of you worried about it, the T-X was handled relatively well; there are several dumb scenes involving her (Including one where she enlarges her breasts) but Mostow handled the idea of a female Terminator relatively well. She isn't exploited the way I would have thought, and the T-X is a rather modest creation. Somehow, though, she is much less menacing than the T-1000 was; I blame poor direction and Kristanna Loken (Who hasn't learned that robots aren't supposed to show emotion - come to think of it, Arnie must've forgot that, too).
All in all, the movie has some fun action scenes and there's some okay jokes, but it doesn't seem like a Terminator movie. It seems more like just an average action movie that - by coincidence - has Terminators in it.
VIOLENT CONTENT - There isn't a lot of gore, really. Most of the violence is in the form of explosions, punches, kicks, and of course, gunplay. There are a couple of somewhat graphic gunshot wounds. There is a scene where the T-X punches through a person's chest. There is a beheading scene, but since the person beheaded is a robot, it isn't gory.
LANGUAGE CONTENT - There's plenty of four-letter words to expect. I doubt that comes as a surprise to anybody.
SEXUAL / NUDITY CONTENT - Surprisingly, there is practically none of this. Neither Arnie nor Loken are fully exposed in the beginning; they are nude, but shrouded in darkness, so it isn't very revealing. And that's it... I hate to disappoint you hormone-driven teenage boys for whom the T-X was created, but she is not the jiggling giggly girl you were hoping for.",1057190400,3,3112,4.701465201465202

It just did not feel very connected to the first two.  This is due mainly to a different actor playing John Connor, as well as the absence of Linda Hamilton (how I miss her!) & James Cameron.  And with a different director and studio, the special effects aren't quite the same.
As for the good things: A female terminator for a change (played very well by Kristanna Doken), Arnold Schwarzenegger still being able to perform such a role despite being 56 years of age and his recent health problems, and the excitement of the movie itself.  This has a lot more action (guns, car crashes, explosions) than the first two.
As for the bad things: Too much comic relief by Mr. Schwarzenegger (just as I expected).  The first two were taken a lot more seriously, but there are moments when this one went too far.  I thought I was watching a self-parody.  Also, it felt a bit too short for a TERMINATOR flick.  The original was a bit shorter, but was structured better so to feel longer.  The second was way over two hours and, again, was carried out better.  A movie like this should have been a little longer.

They ruin a great story with over-the-top action, a plot that is now boring and stupid, and they continually insult the true fans of the series with dumb gags (hence, a scene where Arnold takes the clothes of some erotic dancer at a male strip club...and that's not even the half of it). That theme Brad Fiedel originally created for the series has been made into something that reminded me of the Jaws sequels... its utterly forgettable now. They didn't build any suspense for this new ""advanced"" TX model. Everything she did was actually like watching a bad episode of Ally McBeal (where she's imagining herself doing the most outrageous stuff)....the T-1000 was so much more threatening and dangerous, and realistic.
Don't get me wrong, I went to this film with an open mind, even if I heard the major film studio execs screwed him out of doing this his way and that Eddie Furlong and Linda Hamilton.... (I'm a big big big fan of Cameron's work)....And when I came out of this movie, I was telling myself, ""I knew it""...

1477303,4,B00005JM0B,"I told many people that this new Terminator movie would have no gray area, it will either be great or it will be a disaster.  This was judging by the trailers.  I just saw the first showing matinee today and I will say that this is a great action film marred by a bad trailer.  The film has some big lapses in logic at times yes and a few scenes make you wonder how far it will go, but the film doesn't fail on two counts.  1 - it is absolutely fun and 2 - if there is a fourth one, they found the perfect way to end this film as it has one of the best endings to a movie you'll see and you won't see it coming.
T3 also has some great moments of humor as well.  Arnold in one scene trying on some new eyewear and in another, his responce to a gas station attendant who tries to stop him from stealing.  The latter scene shows a little in the way of how we learned that Terminators can learn from watching other people.  Another humorous scene comes from the re introduction of Dr. Silberman, who was the psych doctor in the first two movies.
The villian is the TX an advanced prototype who is designed as an assassin of not only her targets, but of other Terminators.  Arnolds T800 character even admits that he's no match for it.  In the form of a blonde woman the TX is two steps forward and one step back from the T1000 from T2.  She can change shape like the T1000, but can form more advanced weapons like laser guns instead of just knives and hooks and is able to tap into and controll other machines.  However, during the course of the movie, she actually can get hurt which is a big contrast from T1000 who still remains one of the most unbeatable villians ever.  Some of the action scenes between Arnie and TX are spectacular and are not drawn out.  The fight in the bathroom is particularly amuseing (urinals make handy weapons).
The plot sadly is nothing new.  Arnolds mission is to protect John Conner who is now a drifter to avoid possible detection from any other Terminator.  A woman named Kate gets cut in the action and needs protection also because she will also paly an important part in the future and her dad is the creator of Skynet, the future computer network that starts the nuclear war.  TX is after John, Kate, her dad and others who are to be future leaders as well.
T3 could've been a little better and it misses on some of the emotional strings and messages about our future.  It doesn't let up on action nor is it boring and as I said above it is even quite amusing with some rather not so subtle actions on Arnolds part that his character would take as common place.  Bottom line is that if this is the last movie Arnold makes, he'll go out on a high note since he certainly could go out on a lower one.  I plan on being back to watch this one again.  P.S.  * To anyone who says that there shouldn't even be a third Terminator film due to the lack of evidance of Terminators at the end of the second movie, Arnolds missing arm that he pryed off in the gears in the steel mill in T2 should be all the evidance there needs to be.",1057104000,,3058,4.166666666666667

The action is great fun and it's entertaining even if it's not the best Terminator movie. Everyone is complaining that James Cameron isn't back noir is Linda Hamilton or Edward Furlong....well get over it. I'm serious, get over the fact that this is fresh new start to the franchise and maybe you'll enjoy it. Jonathan Mostow did a pretty good job I think of taking over.
  Terminator 3 isn't the best of the series but it still has what can be expected from a Terminator movie. It has an unstopable villain, a lot of car chases and explosions and of course....it has Arnold at least. If Arnold wasn't in it then I'd say the film shouldn't have been made without him but ....He's Back!. Wouldn't have been a Terminator movie without him. The fact that there's a female terminator is getting knocked a lot but I think Kristanna Loken is actually pretty good. She's about as menacing as Robert Patrick was in T-2 anyway. She kicks Arnold's [butt] a lot and he's tosses her around a lot too. Their fight in a bathroom is pretty fun as he smashes her in the head with Urinals and she throws him threw bathroom stalls.
  I think Nick Stahl (In the Bedroom) is very good as John Connor. He sorta reminds me a lot of Michael Biehn who played his dad in  the original. They sorta make John more like him than he's like Sarah Connor or even anything like the John Connor from T-2. Anyway he pulls off the part good, he gives us a different and more mature John Connor than the Edward Furlong one. I only had a problem with Claire Danes. I like her as an actress but she doesn't really belong in an action movie. It's silly when she coinvenently knows how to use a machine gun or knows how to fly a plane. So her character is basically the only weak one.
  Terminator 3 is nothing compared to T-2 originality rise and brain wise but it still packs a punch. Fans wanted another Terminator movie and they got one and it's a not a bad one either. The end is surprisingly gloomy but hopefully it's the set up for a 4th one. They need to just go ahead and have the war of men against machines in the 4th though as the plot is getting old. I mean 3 movies in a row you have someone sent from the future to protect the future of John Connor. Hopefully since the machines actually rised we'll get a different plot structure now that's not just recycled from the first one. Anyway obviously I want more so Jonathan Mostow didn't ruin the franchise....he left me wanting another Terminator movie!

The storyline was excellent too.  The two hours passed VERY QUICKLY and there was a nice mix of character development, action, suspense and humor!

OK, I HAVE seen it. In my opinion it is a very worthy sequel to the series. It continues the storyline in an excellent way. The special effects are great, and work as part of the storyline. And the (intentional) humor, especially a running gag involving sunglasses, is well used.
It is obvious the intention is not to stop here, and I would welcome future contunuations. I especially like the fact that this is a tragedy, not a ""triumph"" movie. They have even hinted at where the story is going, ala we now know (sort of) how John Conner dies! But that will need to be given more detail in the next sequel.
I'd really probably only give this movie 4 stars, since it does not exist on its own, but requires the previous movies (I have no problem with this, but it is not as strong as if it did hold up entirely on its own, like the original movie did). I have given it a 5 star rating to combat those stupid people who have brought down the average based on what they THINK it will be like.

I loved the first two movies, and I was afraid that the new director would screw everything up, but Jonathon Mostow faithfully took up the mantle that Cameron set down.  The effects are worthy of a Terminator movie, the story is great, though it is much darker than the hopeful T2: Judgment Day.

I am A huge Terminator movie fan and after hearing that James Cameron was not the director and there is no Linda Hamilton as well as a different actor playing John Conner I was worried to say the leased. But when I saw the early previews of a female terminator I lost almost all hope of a good sequel in the trilogy. Now after seeing the movie I can tell you how it was in one clear sentence.""WITHOUT A DOUBT THIS IS THE BEST TERMINATOR MOVIE IN THE TRILOGY, PERIOD!"" I was absolutely ""blown away"" by this movie or should I say ride or maybe action epic. It is one of the Best Action Movies I have ever seen. It starts big and only gets better till you get to the most satisfying ending I have ever seen. I LOVE THIS MOVIE! The director and cast should be very proud of this film. Jonathan Mostow made a move that not even James Cameron could top, I love Cameron but Mostow has clamed the action thrown(if there was one). Kristanna Loken was perfect in the role' she had me totally convinced she was the TX, a flawless performance. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes also gave ""GREAT"" performances not to mention having great chemistry. If you like Action Movies you will love this one and if you love Action Movies you will hold this ""Action Masterpiece"" in your heart for years to come.  -Jason",1057104000,,1409,4.277153558052435

The story isn't quite as good or as deep as the first two, but the ending was depressing in a cool way. Arnold delivers some of his funniest one-liners yet. Watch the ""talk to the hand"" scene towards the middle of the film and you will see what I mean. The TX played by Kristanna Loken is extremely hot and has a bunch of cool weapons to boot. The special effects are great and the crane chase scene is worth the ticket price alone. While not as revolutionary as the first two, T3: Rise of the Machines will surely entertain, and you will leave the theater thinking you watched an action film with a little more thinking envolved than your average summer blockbuster.",1057104000,,787,4.324324324324325
1477334,4,B00005JM0B,"There was little doubt that the movie was not going to live up to excellence of the second one.  When I went in I hoped that it could at least live up to the first film.  In that manner it did, in other ways I was a little let down.
The plot of Terminator 3 is that John Connor (Nick Stahl) has been on the run since after the events of the second film.  In the ten years that have passed Sarah Connor has died of Lukemia and the construction of Sky Net was post poned.  Insted of 1997 when the Nuclear war started it was delayed to 2003.
Once again a Terminator was sent back in time to assassinate John Connor, but this time the Terminatrix (the new model) has other objectives as well.  Since John Connor has been clever enough to basically erase himself Skynet programed the T-X to also assassinate his leutenants.  Arnold returns as the way outdated T100 to stop the new menace and save John Connor and one of his leutenants Kathryn (Claire Danes).  The end result is that there is a lot of action explosions and car chases, and we even get to see the T1, the man made Terminator and first model.
The weird thing about this movie is that it will leave one of three impressions on the audience.  When I left everyone was silent as if deep in thought, because like the previouse two there was not the happy ending, but still one that inspired hope.  The impressions this will leave on the audience is as followed.
1: Total Disgust
2: Squeeling teenage boy who thinks it's the coolest thing
3: Deep in thought and intrigued as to where they can take this.
It's worth seeing, but if you expect it to be like #2 than you will end up being like person 1.  However The movie is good, not excellent like it should be.",1057104000,,1714,4.262345679012346

Well, the score wasn't the best, but the flick itself continues the story of the Terminator Saga. Yeah, comedy has it's own place, but the action in T3 is great. The TX? She's brutal. Whenever she appears you wonder what type of bone-crunching she's gonna pull next.  T3 isn't perfect, but it sure is a worthy flick for the money.

This movie is great in every way.  In fact, it is nearly as good as T2.  Definately see this movie.  The only reason why I didn't give it five stars is it's kind of short.  Spanning only 100-110 minutes, this movie just seems like it could had been longer.  Otherwise, this movie is great, and I cannot imagine the terminator series without it.",1057104000,,514,4.28125

Nope, I had a ton of fun. Definitely a better experience than the pretentious Matrix Reloaded. The dialogue was funny. Sometimes cheesy, but good cheese..c'mon, you can't say you don't secretly want Arni to say ""She'll be back""?
The actors do their job's well. The terminatrix is a very cool villain. She does an incredible job of coming off like a prototype machine getting used to things. Notice the quirky head movements, the ""self-augmentation"". Some very nice touches. Arni is Arni...nuff said. He is, and always will be, what makes the Terminator work.
I'll put the crane chase toe to toe with the Matrix Freeway scene any day of the week. The effects in this movie are so good they disappear...seriously. They spent a lot on the effects, but there is no ""in your face"" feel to them. They blend well into the story and enhance the experience, rather than trying to be an experience themself.",1057104000,,1022,4.779661016949152

T3 mixes a bit of comedy, drama, and action into one shining performance that will leave you breathless. The new female TX Terminator, designed to terminate other terminators (Kristanna Loken) fits the perfect roll as a sexy, juggernaut, near unstoppable killing machine; her mission: terminate John Connor (Nick Stahl) his future wife (Claire Danes) and his Lieutenants. Arnold, like always flawlessly portrays the terminator, looks great, and is well built (considering he is now 55).

And guess what?  This movie ROCKS.  I went into it with no expectations (I mean, I thought that the Ride at Universal Studios was the ""Sequel"" to T2... talk about profiteering!) and, voila, came out ENTHUSED at what a great movie this was.  Sure, the franchise was dead and buried.... but what a great resurrection.

1477342,5,B00005JM0B,"What can I say, I wasn't let down coming out of the movie.  Where to begin, well there's really only a couple of things I can say about the movie.  This movie has tons of action sequences in it.  I never thought a film could have so much.  Take Jerry Bruckhemier and John Woo and put them together, this is what kind of actions in this movie.  My friends and I were amazed.  But with the action comes a price.  One part, and the only thing i can think of(and i'm stretching a bit)is the character development, don't get me wrong the characters are developed, but not just as much in the last 2 terminators.  With all the action, something had to suffer.  But it did not suffer that much.  If you saw the last 2 terminators, you understand there character and why they need to survive for.  So for me, it wasn't that big of a deal.
The chase scene in the movie is the best action scene I have ever scene.  The movie does not look fake either, the CG is very well blended and does look over done.
Arnold looks great I must say for being 55+ years old.  I would say he has another 10 years of action films by the way he looks.
Again, i recommend this movie for Terminator fans and anyone who likes good action films.
Great movie I must say!",1057017600,,1237,4.147058823529412
1477411,5,B00005JM0B,"I went to an advance screening last night. My expectations were pretty low, given the lack of James Cameron at the helm and the span of years that have passed since T2. My biggest concern going in was that it would just be a Terminator vs. Terminator rehash with no real contribution to the story arc of Cameron's universe. My fears were unfounded, however. Jonathan Mostow has done an admirable job of capturing the audacious action and dark humor of the first two movies, while still managing to provide enough new twists to keep this third incarnation fresh. Yes, there's a lot of T-101 vs. T-X insanity, but these sequences are so well-executed and so over the top you can't help but laugh with glee. Kristanna Loken is every bit as scary as Robert Patrick was in the second installment, to the point where during one scene the girl next to me actually screamed in terror. The script, while a bit light on character development, offers plenty of great moments, both frightening and humorous. There are also many smart and unexpected references to the earlier films to tie everything together. Best of all, without giving anything away, important things happen. Things you'll want to see and know about if you are a fan of the first two films. My only gripe is that certain elements of the plot (which I can't reveal) aren't adequately explained. Perhaps those explanations wound up on the cutting room floor and we'll get them on the DVD. However, by the time that classic Terminator theme faded in and the credits rolled, I was very happy with the experience and my doubts about this third chapter in the series were put to rest. This film is about more than cashing in on a successful franchise. They've tried to do justice to the series' legacy and, in my opinion, they've succeeded.",1057017600,107,1790,4.703821656050955
1477412,5,B00005JM0B,".....they, will Rise.......
Arnold is back in one of two of his most popular roles to date, (the other is Conan) and he's back to save the world, or rather, save 2003. After a string of disappointments this year, namely Matrix Reloaded and Hulk, Terminator 3 is the only saving grace of the summer, and boy let me tell you, it's TRUE! IT'S DAMN TRUE!
The action comes thick and fast with utterly amazing visual effects, but beside all that, there is an emotional story beneath the eye candy, a story which beats a strong heartbeat about an young man carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders. What does the Future hold for John Connor? Will he continue to be a nobody all his life, or will he face up to his destiny, ultimately, the dark future in which Mankind VS Machines in a war of hell.
The rest of the cast besides Arnold measure up extremely well. Nick Stahl is incredible as John Connor, a man of emotional torment, constantly wondering what the Future has in store for him. Claire Danes is as wonderful as ever as Katherine Brewster, a woman who also shares a destiny of unknown, but besides all this, there is the T-X!
The T-X, played menacingly by Kristanna Loken, is probably one of the best villains in the last decade. Conveying a sense of innocence and playful flirting which the T-X has learnt, she quickly snaps back into the cold stare of the Terminator, and we are immediately reminded of the suspense riveting experience of when we all first the T-1000 in 1991. I shouldn't make comparisons, but I am going out on a limb here to say she definately rivals Robert Patrick's performance from T2. She young, sexy, but ultimately what we all wanted, a villain we are terrified by.
The genius Stan Winston returns to do animatronics and make-up effects, while the best in the business ILM return once more to provide the most jaw-dropping CGI special-effects we've ever seen in film. The trademark Future War sequences of the Terminator movies play a much important role this time around, as the Future is closely linked more to the present time story, unlike T2, which was merely just eye-candy at the start.
I feel I have missed something out here, and now is the time to get to it - Jonathan Mostow. The director who steps into the shoes of James Cameron, and boy, he fits perfectly! Jonathan has not only made a movie which stands proudly alongside the previous Terminator films, but he's added something new and fresh, and ultimately made it his own. Sure, it contains the same ingrediants as the previous two, but Jonathan mixes them into his own style, and creates a nerve-wracking suspencful ride of humour, sadness and menace. Mostow has taken excellent care of the third chapter which feels like he's breathed new life into the aging franchise, kick started it's heart beat once more.
So to all you skeptical-Cameron fans out there - get over it. I was skeptical at the start of production, but as time went by, I realised how much of a man Jonathan really is. He's a superb director, with such a huge eye for detail, a man in his own league, but ultimately, what he's done with T3 is allowed the story to be the star of the show, and it's an extremely strong story, showing what really happened, the first conflict between humans and machines. That emotional human feeling of the first two movies is carried on over to T3, and is more stronger than ever. I found the movie to be emotionally draining at times, borderline on tears!
I'm happy to say that T3 works flawlessly, and stands extremely well alongside the previous two in the series. It extends and expands the story to much broader levels whilst adding new touches and sealing any plot-holes which were created in the first two films.
As far as I am concerned, true Terminator fans and moviegoers will lap this movie up. To T3-bashers/Cameron fans, you truly don't deserve to see this work of Art. Your years of torment and hatred for this movie is pathetic, and look what's happened, your narrow minded minds have been proved wrong, but I doubt your egos would allow you to admit it.
For the final statement - this is the movie I've been wanting to see ever since the closing credits of 1991. I was concerned this movie wouldn't live up the hype of 12 years, and given my high expectations, it exceeded them.
My hats off to you Jonathan Mostow. You didn't screw this movie up, no, you've created something which stands alongside as a trilogy of the Terminator movies, and Arnold needs no explanation, he's back, hugely wripped and muscled out as much as he was 12 years ago, or even 20 years ago. The man looks fantastic for his age, and the differences are extremely hard to spot from a comparison from his 1991 look. Now, all we need is KING CONAN, I AM LEGEND and CRUSADE to be made by the big man. Come on Warner Bros, greenlight these projects now! T3 is destined to bring in the big bucks. Use those earnings to fund these further three Arnold projects NOW!
Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines is the MOVIE OF 2003!",1056844800,2,5014,4.553709856035438
1477413,5,B00005JM0B,"Finally, a movie sequel that will actully be good!
Terminator 3 will be the best action/adveture movie of the year...and here's why.
1. Jonathan Mostow is the director, his directing stlye (in my oppion) is almost identical to Cameron's.  I know James Cameron probally would have been beter (if he didn't have backed out of the project); but, Mostow directed U-571 and I know he has what it takes to make T3 a excellent movie.
2. The film is rated ""R"", for no-holds-bar non-stop action and violence.  Don't expect T3 to any censor-oriented scenes. (Unlike the lame ""Matrix Reloaded"")
3. It took the cast and crew a very long time to make this movie.  A full 3-min teaser was out for the movie over a year ago.
4. The special FX's will astonishing!  They will most-likely win an Academy Award, if the Academy dosen't go politcal and give it to LOTOR for the third straight year!

Besides, since all the terminator parts were destroyed at the end of T2, how was Skynet invented?  I suspect we're in for some incomprehensible time-travel mumbo-jumbo, an Arnold terminator that cries, and some female cyborg breast shots.  Will they shoot bullets, a la Austin Powers fem-bots?",1056499200,4,392,5.142857142857143
1477415,5,B00005JM0B,"Come July 2nd a whole new chapter in the Terminator Series will be revealed to movie screens all around the world. Of course seeing as the movie hasn't been released yet, this review will simply be going over some aspects of the Terminator Trilogy and will be edited when the movie is released.
When James Cameron was sick in Rome he had a vision. A vision of a cyborg machine arising from the flames. Terminator and movie history was born. The Terminator series has made its mark on filmmakers and audiences everywhere. Before Matrix was even devised, James Cameron made the story of Man Vs Machine into a blockbuster hit. The rise of technology shows no bounds as Cameron taps into the rise of machines and even comments how they could be the next step in the Evolutionary chain.
Arnold Schwarzenegger can warrant most of his fame and fortune to James Cameron's 'Terminator'. And even James Cameron can warrant most of his success as a director to his Terminator movies.
Terminator made its mark on the film industry with its use of Computer generated images. It evolved the bounds that many people thought that computers could do and is now used in pretty much every Hollywood film. With help from CGI, Terminator 2: Judgement Day even surpassed the original Terminator. Although the plot had would of contributed to that success as well.
The 'Terminator' story started off with a Terminator sent back to kill Sarah Connor as she was the mother of John Connor, the future leader of the Rebels against the Machines. A human, named Kyle, was also sent back by the future John Connor to protect his mother. What John Connor didn't realise when sending back Kyle was the he and Sarah Connor would fall in love and Kyle would actually be his father. Both the Terminator and Reese died ending the first chapter in the Terminator series.
Terminator 2: Judgement Day, picks up with John Connor as a foster rebel child with his mother in an insane asylum. A Terminator is sent back through time again... although the human rebels reprogrammed an older terminator model to protect John Connor.  An upgraded Terminator, T-1000, is sent back also to destroy John Connor. Skynet, the mysterious corporation that was the brains and rise of the machines needs to be destroyed as it has got parts of the first terminator sent back through time which makes them excel their research and production of machines. The parts are found and destroyed along with both terminators. Ending the apocalyptic war of Man Vs Machine in the future.
So is everything has been taken care of, then what can we expect from the 3rd installment of the Terminator Series?
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. A decade has passed since John Connor (NICK STAHL) helped prevent Judgment Day and save mankind from mass destruction.  Now 22, Connor lives ""off the grid"" - no home, no credit cards, no cell phone and no job.  No record of his existence.  No way he can be traced by Skynet - the highly developed network of machines that once tried to kill him and wage war on humanity.  Until...
...out of the shadows of the future steps the T-X (KRISTANNA LOKEN), Skynet's most sophisticated cyborg killing machine yet.  Sent back through time to complete the job left unfinished by her predecessor, the T-1000, this machine is as relentless as her human guise is beautiful.
Now Connor's only hope for survival is the Terminator (ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER), his mysterious former assassin.  Together, they must triumph over the technologically superior T-X and forestall the looming threat of Judgment Day...or face the apocalypse and the fall of civilization as we know it.
One big downfall to the third film so far is that James Cameron and Linda Hamilton are not scheduled to be apart of this blockbuster hit. Jonathon Mostow has been signed to direct this successful series. To be honest, I don't know much about Mostow's work so I can't comment on whether he'll be a pro or a con to this movie smash.
I, personally, would of preferred to see the movie set in the future with the battle between Man Vs Machine in full throttle. Instead the plot is set exactly like it was in T2, except with a newly upgraded terminator. The great aspects of the first 2 movies was that the storyline took leaps forward while this movie seems to be just an upgraded Cat and Mouse chase.
I can only hope that this movie can continue the tradition of surpassing its Terminator predecessors. The CGI looks state of the art, the action scenes look intense and the hype is off the page. 12 years has passed since the last Terminator movie and only time will tell if it's worth its stay in the Terminator series.
But you better believe Arnold when he say's he'll be back, cause he's back on July 2nd.",1055808000,24,4734,4.717049576783555
1477416,1,B00005JM0B,"Terminator and Terminator 2:Judgement Day shined gloriously in the sci-fi/action movie franchise. Not to mention, these are two of many James Cameron films that spectacular. Now, we have a 2003 Terminator movie. Terminator 3-Rise of the Machines. Even the title ""Rise of the Machines"" makes it sound like something out of The Matrix blended with a terrible Star Wars movie that was not made by George Lucas (just giving an example.) The movie looks like its strictly all big bang special effects with terrible acting with cut outs from the previous Terminator films. Here's the prediction of huge flaws for T3.
1. Arnold looks really old and not as strong as he used to be. Back then, Arnold has huge cannons on his arms, where now, there still pretty big, but not enough to make him ar big and scary as he was in the previous films. We might see him as much weaker in this film :-(
2. A FEMALE TERMINATOR WITH A NAME UNORIGINAL TO THE MOVIES! I believe her model is Termi-Matrix or something like that. In the previous films all Terminators were classified by numbers EX. the infamous T-1000. We can already tell that the directors and producers are trying to vear away from the classics and making something fresh and new, which in my opinion, will not come out good.
3. John Connor looks like a wannabee, trying to be rough and tough Backstreet Boys member. The John Connor they had in T2 was awesome. He was sporting the scars on his face and rugged look, where in this one, he's got clear skin and a bratty face.
4. No Linda Hamilton = no Sarah Connor. This is dissapointing to me, because I loved Linda Hamilton's character, Sarah Connor. She played magnificently, and I'm really going to miss that crazy women.
5. All of the action sequences look like something out The Matrix and a huge anime film with tons of karate and outrageous gunfights. Hopefully the movie won't be filled with action. In the previous two, there was awesome, heart punding action, but they eventually slowed down and focused more on the story and character development.
6. NO JAMES CAMERON! Without James Cameron directing T3, you won't have an awesome addition to the Terminator movies. He's the man that started it all!
Overall, T3 just looks like something that the fans demanded to be made, and Hollywood finally gave into it. Like the crew wanted to make it but didn't really want to, so they threw new things in to make it interesting for themselves.",1055635200,6,2438,4.658932714617169

It can be seen from the trailer that the film does have a different appearance - due to James Cameron not directing it.

New John Connor

For me, too much change could indeed ruin this movie. Special effects are brilliant, but without the storyline don't really mean anything! If this movie becomes a Bomb, then I feel it has ruined all of the existing Terminator movies.
