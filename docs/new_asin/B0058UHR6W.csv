4601563,5,B0058UHR6W,"If you are new to yoga and are looking for an at-home DVD, then you will love ""Element Hatha & Flow, Yoga for Beginners"" with yogi Tamal Dodge.  The routines Tamal uses are geared for beginners for sure, but could be used as a nice, contemplative alternative for more seasoned yoga students as well.  Tamal's calm demeanor and conscious approach enhance the flow of asanas that are both easy to grasp and also challenge you to listen to your body to find your own place to deepen each pose.  As a yoga beginner, I was sometimes confused by the names of poses and found certain DVDs hard to follow.  Not so with Tamal's instruction.  Every movement and pose is very clear and easy to follow.  This DVD is really well done.  I highly recommend it!",1316822400,85,745,4.474074074074074
4601564,5,B0058UHR6W,"This is a gem, and not just for beginners! I loved both practices, though one of the sections didn't utilize the strap.  Still, very well taught by Tamal, who I hope will instruct more workout dvds in the future!  Have always had tight hips, but if the workout didn't use props, I usually wouldn't bother.  Now I'm happy to have two different practices that I can use.  Love the outdoor setting, Tamal's soothing manner and voice, and his attention to detail.  This is a wonderful workout that is a pleasure to do!  Thank you so much!",1316563200,6,534,4.510416666666667
4601565,5,B0058UHR6W,This DVD is like water to my soul. There are lots of DVDs out there but not many that start at the ground and work their way up. It makes a beginner at yoga feel like they can conquer this already vastly growing sport and spiritual practice. The DVD gives anyone all the tools needed to not only start  their own individualized yoga journey but to have the confidents to learn new elements of yoga. It is a great DVD with amazing fundamentals that even advance practitioners could benefit from. HIGH RECOMMENDED!,1316131200,18,512,4.565217391304348
4601566,5,B0058UHR6W,"This DVD is extremely well thought out! It's perfect for beginners who want to try yoga for the first time and advanced students who are looking for a great workout.

Tamal is a wonderful teacher and learning yoga from him is something very special. This instructional video can help you bring a mindful & meditative quality to your yoga practice. The price is great and the DVD comes with a strap!",1316044800,12,398,4.605633802816901
4601567,5,B0058UHR6W,This is an easy to follow video that takes place in a lovely setting.  Tamal provides a easy to follow well detailed sequence of steps. You are all set to practice yoga.  The strap makes yoga accessible for all even if you are tight.  This video would be my first choice for a basic comprehensive yoga video.  Happy Practicing.,1315872000,6,327,4.491525423728813
4601568,5,B0058UHR6W,"Tamal Dodge is so widely respected as both a Yoga instructor and teacher that both his classes in the Los Angeles area as well as his teacher training workshops he does worldwide are always in demand. He has such a wonderful way about him, his voice, his spirit and his warm and encouraging words will open up the amazing and healthy world of yoga for anyone either beginning or looking for the perfect at home class. Enjoy!",1315872000,4,424,4.51948051948052
4601569,5,B0058UHR6W,"I'm a yoga instructor and will definitely be recommending this to students and fellow instructors! Because this is definitely, hands down, one of the best Yoga DVD's I've ever taken. The instruction is super clear and easy to follow, you could literally do it with your eyes closed. It's perfect for beginners, mid levels, and advanced.  No matter what level you are, the 30 minute sequences put most hour-hour and a half work outs to shame!  So whether you're looking to deepen your practice or get a good work out in, this will give you the chance to do both, guaranteed!",1315785600,18,573,4.663366336633663
4601570,5,B0058UHR6W,I LOVE this DVD! It's amazing what a great workout you can get in 30 minutes!! The instruction is super clear and easy to follow. It's the first DVD I've done that I don't have to look at the screen for the instruction. Great job Anchor Bay and Tamal Dodge!!,1315785600,5,258,4.18
4601571,5,B0058UHR6W,"Tamal is such an amazing teacher! If you can't make it to one of his packed classes in Los Angeles, this is the next best thing. And.....if you're new to yoga, this is a perfect introduction.

His teaching style is approachable, calm, and informative all at once. This is great for beginners as well as for seasoned yogi's those who want more details during their yoga practice.

In a calm and confident manner, Tamal outlines poses in simple, easy to understand steps so you can concentrate on being present in your practice (instead of looking up at the DVD every few seconds).

I'm a yoga teacher and have recommended this DVD to students who want to deepen their practice at home between classes.",1315785600,5,700,4.67479674796748

4601579,5,B0058UHR6W,"I really like this dvd. My issue I have had in the past with yoga dvds is trying to get into the pose, hold the pose and have time to feel it, I usually get stressed out trying to see what they are doing and keep up, just flailing around unproductively (yet I'm sure comically if anyone were to watch). He is easy to follow, gives enough time to breathe into the pose and feel it. The poses are also good for beginners introducing their body to yoga or if you have been out of practice.
Lately I've been using the slower paced session to complement my workout plan as I'm just getting back into it and doing HIIT (just started 30 day shred by Jillian Michaels) and this has helped with recovery and flexibility.
Update: I just attempted the flow session, it's definitely much more challenging. I guess that must be why I don't really remember it much, since I barely ever do it. It's too challenging for me at my current level. but maybe as I build endurance I will be able to try it again. I definitely laughed at myself tangled facplanting in one of the moves, I think I'll come back to that one lol",1489276800,4,1101,4.2727272727272725

It is not too complicated and really stretches and detoxifies your body but easily enough and in 30 minutes, I love the meditation at the end as well.

You try to follow what he is saying but as soon as you look up to the TV to check your position, it's all wrong! Perhaps it's OK if you are a seasoned pro (in which case you don't need the DVD anyway) but if you are new to yoga it's very hard to unscramble the reversal between the audio and the video. It just gets too confusing and I have to give up. This would be a very good DVD if it weren't for the permanent reversal of left and right. It seems ridiculous to me - I cannot think of any logical reason for it.",1477353600,,629,3.921875

Some were easier than others.  I really liked the trainer.  His voice is soft and easy to understand.

The only thing I can think of that I did not like is that some of the moves you're doing you have your head down or are facing down. Then he starts talking about doing the next thing, I mean you ""flow"" into the next movement. Well, I have to lift my head up to see how he's flowing or what's next, etc. It's not very flow like. I guess after a few times, you just figure it out. I am yet to that stage though so my flow looks more like amateur hour. Some day though, victory will be mine. I liked it though.

As someone completely new to yoga, I did find it to be difficult the first few days. After a month practice and persistence I can do all the stretches just the way he does in both programs. When I first started it was uncomfortable to try and stretch my hands past my knees.
I first got this program to help with lower back pain and overall relaxation. And both have been successfully elievated, I definitely recommend Tamal Dodge's program for those completely new to yoga. :)",1460246400,,635,4.256198347107438

I look and feel better...Ignore all reviews that say that it's too much...this is the reason to do Yoga to stretch out and feel better, calmer and stronger..
It does all that with a great Hawaiian view, beautiful music, and the calm, peaceful voice of a lifetime of Yoga...Wonderful!

A few of the parts are too difficult but it's easy enough to work around those. I find it to be a much harder workout than the others I have tried which I like.

It has helped my tight glut muscles relax so I no longer have any problems with pain in my legs. It is a total body stretch and I like the fact that I can work up to the Flow section when I am stronger in my upper body. Tamal's voice is very soothing and pleasant. He integrates all the proper names for the poses and explains what each pose is accomplishing for your body. It is very informative. I recommend this video highly. It is well thought out. I have been using the video for several months and wanted to send this review for others that are looking for a beginner session.

Though I bought three different beginner yoga DVD's, this is the only one I use anymore.  The flow section moves you through poses in time with your breathing and this is the kind of yoga I can really look forward to.  The best thing about the DVD is the instruction - Tamal is very clear, confident and easy to follow.  He directs you through each pose and keeps you on the inhale and exhale perfectly.  I found the hatha segment easy but the flow is just challenging enough for me to keep at it for some time before I feel I've mastered it.  At this point, one more plank and I'm going to hurl!!  If Tamal has more advanced yoga instruction I'll be getting those ASAP!",1439251200,,775,4.333333333333333

The first segment where you use the strap gives you a great stretch but isn't difficult so I think it is definitely good for the beginner.  The second section ""flow"" is pretty intense for a beginner.  I've gotten back into yoga and have been doing it daily for over three months and this segment still gets me a little winded.

I've purchased yoga dvds in the past and never liked them because the postures were too difficult for me or the meditative teachings took up too much of the dvd.  I like to meditate for only a short time.  Tamai is incredibly good at walking you through the correct position for the postures, the postures are perfect for a beginner, and the meditation after is a relaxing finale.  His voice is soothing but strong.  I am thoroughly enjoying this dvd and highly recommend it for beginners in Yoga.",1433462400,2,623,4.373913043478261

4601725,5,B0058UHR6W,"I like the approach in this video with the sessions that the instructor uses.  One of the routines was a bit more challenging, but I was able to do it.  Just take your time and give yourself a chance to progress.  I was using this as I was also using other videos and had it part of my rotation even when just starting out, so it is doable.

The first routine is slower and the easier of the two, including the use of a strap to help with the stretch, the second is the more challenging of the two, so start with the one with the strap if you are new.

The instruction is clear and the teacher comes across well.",1431475200,,612,4.024793388429752

4601734,5,B0058UHR6W,"I used to practice yoga quite some time ago at a great yoga center. I moved away and got away from it, especially after coming down with severe rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia some years ago. I tried several dvds, but most of them either went too fast with not enough explanation (so I was paying more attention to the video than my practice), were distracting in one way or another and/or were too rough on all my joints.

I just ordered this video today and absolutely loved that I could use it right away by purchasing it on Amazon Video (one less thing to clutter my home, as well!) My daughter and I tried it out immediately and loved it! Tamal is fantastic. His voice is pleasant and he takes the time to explain each pose and proper breathing without talking too much or too little. I was thrilled to not have to constantly stop to stare up at my television. I also appreciated being able to hear his breathing, at times, to help keep me on track. The Hatha session was great for my arthritis and I enjoyed the use of yoga straps (FYI-We both used tea towels folded lengthwise as yoga straps as my yoga strap won't be here for 2 days. It worked well for my daughter who is 4' 2"" and fairly well for me, except for a few times the folded towel was too short. I think I'll be happier with the strap.) My daughter and I were very relaxed after the Hatha session which ends in a guided meditation (which was great as we meditate together regularly.) She went on to continue enjoying her relaxed state in her room and I chose to continue on to the Flow session.

I started out great with the Flow session and really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a bit more difficult than the Hatha session, but not ridiculously so. Most of my difficulties stemed from the portion of the session where downward facing dog is performed often, as I had trouble with that pose after a bit due to the arthritis in my wrists. It may have also been from going from doing no yoga for some time to suddenly trying to do an hour of it. :) I think it's a great session, but I will be using my wrist braces next time. I'm glad that the Flow session presented more of a challenge than the Hatha (while still remaining beginner level), as it gives me something to work towards. I simply modified a few moves in the Flow session (until I can work up to them) and then jumped back on course with the session as it changed to poses that came easier for me. I enjoyed how encouraging Tamal was throughout both sessions without being saccharine and how he put emphasis on not pushing yourself too far, but rather helping modify the pose to your ability. This was exactly what I would want for a beginner video and am thrilled to have found a video I love on the first try this time! I'm excited to do both sessions again  (although, don't feel you have to to do both in one sitting or even in a day.) I also look forward to Tamal's other yoga videos. Enjoy!",1428796800,,2933,4.290613718411552

4601749,5,B0058UHR6W,"I loved it. I love the pace, I love how I was relaxed yet felt like I accomplished something at the end.

Understand I am a fitness guy but what I do doesn't carry over to Yoga; Yoga is my rehab. I loved the strength aspect of Ashtanga but was still suffering from physical issues so I met with a Yogi and she had me do Hatha. Due to her cost I didn't return but she got me thinking, maybe I should turn my focus from Ashtanga to Hatha. Well between the reviews of this DVD, the low cost, and the fact I was able to get a discount on it I bought this with reading very little of the reviews. I figured for a little over $5 what do I have to lose for we spend more on gas right? So I tried it this morning and I was pleasantly surprised on how much I enjoyed it.

There are many styles and one in particular I will never do: Bikram. The idea of being in a over heated room isn't my idea of a good time. I love the physical aspect of Ashtanga but I have many fitness focuses and they just clash with my present interests and push-comes-to-shove my Yoga practice will take a back door to my passions. So I then tried this style and again I love it.

He actually goes at a decent pace. I was concerned at first when he spent several minutes on breathing and thought ""Oh here we go again"" but then once we got into the physical aspect and the use of a towel/band/belt was a HUGE help. I personally used a towel and I love it for positions that I struggled with in the past, the use of the towel made it that much easier to do. Also note, you don't have to buy some overpriced Yoga band/belt, anything long and strong will work hence my cheapo beach towel.

Also, those that make comments such as ""by the time I check the position he is already into something else"" which I completely disagree. His pace in comparison to many others I have used is perfect. Also, lets say he is onto the next move, so what! Just rewind. It's a DVD people.

In short, I think it's worth the small cost.",1421107200,2,1978,4.048593350383632

Most positions were attainable and I don't remember thinking "" are you kidding, this is supposed to be for a beginner, maybe a 22 year old"" .  It also presented the right amount of challenge.  I would buy it again and will probably try advancing with this instructor.",1416268800,3,368,4.447761194029851

4601769,4,B0058UHR6W,I like the first exercise which is just straight Hatha yoga but 2nd exercise which is the flowing exercise is just too much for me to handle at my age and condition.  I like the poses but just can't flow from one to the other and I have taken enough Yoga over the years to know that this would be difficult for anyone just beginning.  This tape states for beginners and the 2nd half isn't that...I do enjoy Tamal as an instructor.,1415232000,,430,4.2317073170731705

4601773,3,B0058UHR6W,"I am a 49-year-old active woman who has have been doing yoga 2-3 times a week for a few years. At the yoga studio I go to, I do a 90-minute ""Slow Flow"" yoga class. I have several ""Gentle Flow"" or ""Slow Flow"" DVDs as well but was getting kind of bored of the ones I have and looking for something new. I was concerned that this DVD might be too easy, but it's really at more of an advanced-beginner/beginner-intermediate level. A true beginner would probably become frustrated, especially with the Flow segment (the Hatha segment is much easier). Each of the segments is approximately 32 minutes long. One of the things I liked best is the Savasana portion on the Hatha segment. On most yoga DVDs, just about the time I start to relax, Savasana is over. On this DVD, Savasana is a little bit longer. I debated between giving this DVD a 3 or a 4, so I guess I'd say my rating would be a 3.5 if that was an option.",1414281600,7,911,4.241379310344827

You can completely stretch your lower back and quads. It also has a lovely intro to breathing and shavasana which I think is vital to enjoying your practice.

Part 2: Flow: A very dynamic sequence of asanas designed to create a flow in practice. Though it is hard and is probably meant for  people who have been practicing for a while, it can be easily modified by a beginner to give a good workout.

Some of the other videos assume the viewer knows what to do and they move along at a pace that, as a beginner, is just to darned fast!

Tamal has a great voice, and explains why you're doing certain poses and what health benefits they give you. I also enjoyed the scenery and background music.

One thing I love is that he emphasizes focusing on your breath by audibly breathing so you can follow along. I find this extremely helpful as I constantly forget to breath and need a reminder. You can get so much more out of your routine if you focus on breathing!

There are (2) exercises on this DVD. The first I feel any beginner can keep up with. The second was extremely challenging for me, as I am very much out of shape, but it really gives me a great work out and something that I can work towards as a goal.

The only thing that would make this DVD even better, is a short ""what not to do"" guide on these poses. I previously watched one of Rodney Yee's beginning yoga DVDS and he had a section on what you should be doing and what not to do on the poses before he even started the exercises. Since I'm doing this at home, I found this guide extremely helpful!

4601830,4,B0058UHR6W,"This is a good introduction to yoga. The instructor, Tamal, has a very nice demeanor and gives good, clear instructions. His voice is very calming and soothing, too. The only problem is that he talks a little quickly, which can be problematic when you're moving from pose to pose (and you've never done them before). My advice: The first time or two you go through the workouts, plan a little extra time and keep the remote handy. You'll want to pause and make sure you're getting into proper position. Once you've been through it once or twice, you'll probably be able to move along with his instructions better.

4601835,5,B0058UHR6W,"I'm a 62 yr old female who was a runner for years. When my running ended due to 3 knee surgeries I started going to beginner yoga classes. This dvd has helped me  'bump it up' a notch as beginner yoga classes were becoming boring and redundant.  Knowledge of basic yoga postures will be beneficial. This dvd has two sessions. If you don't have too much time, the first video (hatha) is a great way to start the day (runs about 30 minutes...). The second video (hatha flow) is also about 30 minutes and is more challenging. Combine both practices and you'll have a great workout. Balance, stamina, posture and body shape will improve with consistent weekly practice. Tamal Dodge has a pleasant voice, is encouraging throughout. I've purchased 3 dvd's before this one and, without, doubt this is the best one.",1384732800,2,807,4.676056338028169
4601836,5,B0058UHR6W,"Okay, I have a lot (a LOT) of yoga DVDs. Of all of them, this is my favorite. It's great for beginners, or if you need to slide in a quick end of the day session to work on your flexibility. The first portion, Hatha, uses a strap and you will absolutely want one. Yogi Tamal is easy to listen to, has a nice smile and does a good job of guiding you through the poses. I never find him obnoxious or irritating, and after doing this DVD week after week, that really says something. At first, I thought the meditation section at the end was not that great, but as time has gone on I appreciate the mental image of watching objects float down the river. This is not a good DVD for you if you're looking for more cardio, or really advanced poses.",1384732800,,741,4.117241379310345

4601838,5,B0058UHR6W,"When I decided to buy a Yoga video, I already had a specific type in mind. I wanted something that was for beginners, something that made me WANT to use it everyday and a video with an instructor that was a pleasure to listen to, who didn't sound like he/she was 'talking down' to me, or stating the very obvious.

This video is exactly what I wanted. I knew it would be before purchase because, along with the written information, this DVD has a video preview that told me everything I needed to know to make sure I was getting what I wanted, for sure. Well worth the price! Look no further if your needs are like mine.",1381190400,2,620,4.254237288135593

4601840,5,B0058UHR6W,"I love Tamal Dodge, easy to follow and he has a calming voice.  Workout is well suited for someone new to yoga and also still challenging enough for someone who has some yoga experience.  I like having an alternative yoga DVD that uses the yoga straps to change up the workout a little bit.  I would definitely recommend this DVD.  I also love the other Tamal Dodge workouts: Element Intro to Yoga and Element Yoga Energy & Relax.",1379980800,,430,4.4743589743589745
4601841,5,B0058UHR6W,I bought this for myself in the spring and gave my first copy to my daughter who enjoyed doing it with me.  CAME BACK FOR ANOTHER!,1379289600,,130,4.0
4601842,4,B0058UHR6W,"My main issue with this DVD is that the difficulty level of the two workouts is really quite extreme and some people might not be prepared for that.

The Hatha session is wonderful, soothing, and relaxing.  It will definitely relax you at the end of a long day and help work on flexibility.  I encourage everyone, beginners and advanced yogis alike, to use the strap as the instructor demonstrates.  I didn't because I never use straps or blocks in my yoga practice but one day for the hell of it I did and it really adds a lot to this session.  You feel and stretch your muscles in new ways.

The flow session is quite a power packed little workout that those new to yoga, overweight, or new to fitness in general will find very challenging.  It is miles away from the ease of the Hatha session. There are some great strength building sequences, very good core and balance focus, and you will get a decent full body workout in 30 minutes.  I would hesitate to call this a beginner workout though.  You will need a beginning understanding of basic yoga poses and knowledge of proper form.

If you approach the flow session by going easy on yourself, taking breaks when you need to, and focusing on doing the best you can at that moment I think you may like this video and will be encouraged by your progress the more you do it.  Use the Hatha session as your reward for putting in a good effort.

The instructor is encouraging and manages to strike a good balance between being motivating and babbling on and on to the point of distraction.  His focus and guidance on breath, the essence of Yoga, is excellent.

For those brand spankin new to Yoga I recommend the beginner Yoga Zone dvds.  They are, IMO, the best at explaining proper form, giving a good background on Yoga, and guiding you as you learn about this great form of exercise that nourishes your soul at the same time.  For beginners with a basic knowledge of poses and alignment but wanting a little bit more challenge (not quite as difficult as the flow practice on this DVD) I recommend Baron Baptiste Power Yoga Level 1.  Don't be scared by the title.  You will work up a sweat and get a good workout that is very accessible and easy to follow.",1378425600,82,2210,4.441687344913151
4601843,5,B0058UHR6W,"Tamal does a great job at guiding you through this exercise.  He explained what each pose was doing which was a big help.  I would recommend this dvd.

4601848,5,B0058UHR6W,"I've always said ""I'm just not into yoga"".  Though I am an atheltic person, the truth of the matter is that I find Yoga difficult and the four other yoga DVD's I have, though labeled ""beginner"" really aren't, so much so that I can never do a complete routine.  BUT with this DVD, I think there is hope.  This truly is a beginners instruction.  Tamal Dodge has a wonderful way of gently leading through these beginning poses.  His voice is gentle and calm, the music background unobtrusive yet relaxing, and I think I may get into yoga, which is not to say it is easy; but finally do-able with this gentle DVD.  I highly recommend it for anyone who thinks yoga is difficult and that they will never be able to do it, you can!",1376784000,3,724,4.325925925925926

I am also overweight and the positions are attainable or at least to where I can modify them to work the way I need them to. There are 2 separate routines on here and I found the 2nd routine to be a little more difficult. It is more of a cardio workout and if you have bad knees it might not be right for you.

I love Kristin McGee's videos, but Tamal Dodge brings the practice back to a more spiritual level.  I really like that he is not speaking while performing yoga but has added his vocals to instruct the yogi on how to move through the poses and breath.  I also like that I can do one 30 min workout or do both for a 60 min workout.  The only con is that the video does not provide an option to play both workouts into one 60 min session.",1363219200,,532,3.990566037735849
4601879,4,B0058UHR6W,"After 30 years away from yoga, and having sustained a herniated disc along with degenerative disease and sciatica, I was in rough shape.  Trying to avoid surgery, I did yoga classes for 2 months, 3x a week with varied teachers.  Not sure I could have jumped into a tape of any kind without this background.  I bought another tape along with this one, the Zyrta (?) one.  I like her, but she spends a lot of arm waving time getting you from one pose to another.  And I find her too fast.  For my problems, the longer one holds and concentrates on the breath in the pose the better, and this is what Dodge does.  Acquiring something to use for a strap is not a big deal.  I have a stretchy rope that I acquired from my physical therapist, and it does the job well.  You can use your imagination on it, but SOMETHING of that nature will help you a lot to listen to your body.  I am most pleased with this particular tape.  He does the best visulaization and cool down I have heard, and I have heard a lot.  Not so chatty, not having to listen to ""relax this and relax that"" ad infinitum.  He guides you but he leaves you space to be with yourself, which is essential.",1362268800,2,1164,4.1891891891891895

This DVD is perfect.  I do have limitations (bad knee and hip replacement) so I listened to the suggestion of my teacher and adapted all the moves to MY body, finding a way to accomplish the end result of the poses.
I purchased a knee pad (used by contractors for installing floors) for my bad knee, works perfectly.
I discovered my right thigh had lost 1/2 inch while the left had not. Why? Because I favored the right knee and did not work as hard lifting the left leg.  The remedy is in the knee pad.

I attended an intermediate class 3-4 times a week and felt connected to my body, soul and spirit through it. Over time my body was looking fabulous - but my centeredness was most valued. Then my life took a FAST turn - engaged to a high school sweet heart after reconnecting at a 20 year reunion, getting pregnant naturally at 40 ( I swear it was due to my years of yoga and healthy eating,) leaving a job I loved, a home I purchased on my own and moving across the country to Los Angeles to have our baby and be closer to our family - surely to find a yoga studio as grounding as the one I'd loved so dearly. Three years later, a toddler in tow and I have not yet found what I need. So - I thought I'd try yet ANOTHER yoga video - in particular looking for yoga flow. I could almost cry right now - after simply one 30 minute practice - this stiff and stale, post later in life baby delivered body, feels at peace and strong. Ok, I'm going to need to do this quite a few more times to feel strong - but this video absolutely hits on a simple but very effective practice for a beginner or someone trying to find their way back to their BODY. I am out of shape, but a yoga teacher in Topanga Canyon told me my body and muscles would have memory. Following  this video is what helped me find that memory. I'm surely going to do it daily and hopefully find another of his videos that is a longer flow version. I just want more of it - but for now - it's perfect.

There is almost no guidance for the beginner in how to do the poses properly.  This seems to be common with these yoga DVD's that claim to be for beginners.  I think this can be dangerous, because a person could injure him/herself if they don't have adequate instruction.

The Hatha is great for shoulder and hip stretching and flexibility but still good core and strength work. The Flow video can easily go from beginner to intermediate level.  And the BEST part- Tamal explains why and how and then is QUIET while you work through your poses- not non stop talking like so many other videos out there.

4601895,5,B0058UHR6W,"I was afraid it would be too easy because my husband and I feel we are closer to intermediate, but we worked-up a sweat.  I like the flow, and the instructor is one of the best I have come across.  This is the third yoga dvd I have purchased in the last few months, and so far, it is my favorite.",1357516800,,296,3.8360655737704916
4601896,5,B0058UHR6W,"I am an older uncoordinated absolute beginner. The instructor explains and demonstrates the moves and positions well in a genuinely calm and well modulated voice. He also explains well the physical effects and benefits of each pose in real time. At the conclusion he explains the spiritual benefits through a guided meditation. These explanations are clear and down to earth. The setting is lovely and there is compatible background music. There is also an undertone of breathing that I find helpful to sync my own breathing with the moves. I have another Yoga DVD and I far prefer this one. The use of the strap intensifies the benefit of the moves.
There are two programs - a Hatha and Flow. I have been following the Hatha program for four months now 2-3 times a week. Even though it has challenged my muscles and increased my flexibility, I have experienced no soreness or strain whatsoever. At this point, the Flow program is beyond me. It goes too fast for the likes of me. I try it after the Hatha program about once a week and each time get a little further along.
I find this DVD well tempered and considered. The only reason for 4, rather than a 5 rating,  is than one cannot bypass Tamal Dodge's introductory remarks to access the programs (The intro was helpful for the first few viewings, but now is no longer needed.) The other reason is the degree of difficulty and the fast pace of the Flow program. It seemed a little intense for a beginner, but I acknowledge the problem could be me. I just upgraded to  5 as I figured out how to bypass the remarks. Elementary, really.",1357430400,24,1587,4.564912280701755

The Hatha is pretty mellow--lots of stretching.  The Vinyasa will make you sweat!  They can be done individually or as an hour-long Yoga experience.  Tamal Dodge guides you through it all with a gentle, calm voice.  There is breathing instruction and a brief relaxation/meditation at the end of each section.

4601903,2,B0058UHR6W,"I notice now that most of the great reviews on this video are from people who are already into yoga. I am very flexible and rather strong, but the pace and expectations here are not at a true beginner level...maybe an experienced beginner. After 15 minutes of the flow, I just gave up. The poses weren't hard, but there wasn't even time to get yourself into position and check if you were doing it right before he was on to the next.

Also, so much leaning on the hands so early on, my palms are still red and sore. He says to go at your own pace, but if you slow down to check your posture, you have just missed the next pose.

It's a shame...I really wanted to like this video, and the instructor is calm and pleasant. I want to be his friend. But he's focused on his own workout, not helping me figure out mine. I bet he's the best instructor in person, but this video is not an introduction to yoga.",1354924800,123,903,4.154285714285714
4601904,4,B0058UHR6W,I like this DVD a lot.  I only wish it had more levels so I could increase difficulty as I get better.  But I would still recommend it.

4601907,5,B0058UHR6W,I really really like this dvd because it's truly for someone who's at the beginner level of yoga but not necessarily a beginner at exercising which is the case for me. The pace flows so it's not super slow therefore I feel somewhat of a cardio affect but very low impact. There are no spiritual undertones or chanting which is great for me because I like yoga strictly for the physical benefits and don't want to dabble in yoga's spiritual side due to conflicts with my personal beliefs so it's perfect in that area. The instructor guides the moves well and it's just better too me than a lot of other yoga dvds that claim to be beginner but still have moves that inflexible people like me can't realistically do. I like it and plan to use it often. The fact that it comes with a yoga strap is an extra added bonus because many yoga newbies will need the assistance of the strap to help them ease into the moves as they learn them and progress to the next level. I wish I had purchased this years ago before wasting so much money on my other so called beginner yoga dvds that are really more intermediate. Atleast now I have this dvd to help me to prepare to one day be able to do the positions on my more challenging yoga dvds.,1354406400,3,1228,4.274678111587983

Tamal couldn't have more knowledge if he tried and he really aims to ease beginners in without making you feel like a beginner and the day after you do it you realise just how good the practice was. Great scenery, detailed explanations on everything and lots of focus on breath which I always would lose focus on.",1353283200,,475,4.173913043478261

Also, there's no option to play it back without the instructions for after you've watched it several times and just want to follow along. I haven't gotten through the whole DVD  yet, so can't comment on it as yoga instruction, but if subtitles and the ability to turn off instructions are important to you, you'll be disappointed.

In the beginning when i got I wasn't sure if i liked the fact that it had two separate 30 minutes yoga lessons. This was my very first yoga dvd and also the first time I started practicing yoga. He makes it very easy to concentrate on the pose, he gives very accurate and concise instructions to have the perfect pose without having to look at the screen all the time. When i took my first yoga class the instructor was amazed how well I was doing the poses, she asked me about this dvd. Now i have purchased some intermediate yoga dvds and they're nearly not as great as this one. I'm always finding myself coming back to this.
Bottom line, Money well spent!!!!",1348444800,3,735,4.294964028776978

After the first time I felt so good and the next day I was a little sore (which I have never felt with other DVDs). It's been a couple weeks since using it and I am noticeably more flexible and my posture has improved. The instructor is pleasant to listen to also, which makes the experience much nicer.

This is by far the best because Tamal Dodge is fantastic at keeping the flow going, holding poses with no rushing, explaining what's being achieved physically, reminding everyone to be careful not to go beyond what your body is telling you, adding tips and ongoing breath guidance, and offering pose options. The first segment concludes with a gorgeous guided meditation. The calming music enhances the experience, matching the tone of each challenge. Tamal is a hip, cool, inviting teacher, accepting of different abilities, and in love with what he does. I honestly cannot wait for his next DVD! Thank you sooooo much, Tamal.

The instructor is has a very calming tone to his voice and he explains things in such a way that doesn't require you to stare at the screen all the time.  I am in the medical field and he includes very minor, but very helpful tidbits on the purpose of the pose for your body.  It is very well catered to a beginner.  The poses are simple to follow but provide an adequate challenge, especially if you are not very flexible. The Hatha is very relaxing, and I prefer to use it in the evening to wind down from a hard day.  The backdrop is a scenic Hawaiian coast line, with the instructer in the middle of a patch of grass surrounded by various plants.

1.  I have very tight hamstrigs and like yoga that is more slow and controlled. This does slow deep stretches.  To me this is very effective in loosening tightness.  I think it is more beneficial than having a tape that you can't do the move and you feel like you are wasting time waitng for it to move to something you can do.  It also makes it safer.

The Hatha routine is very easy.  It doesn't give much of a challenge, especially for those with yoga experience.  However, it does make it easier to coax yourself out of not exercising when you are tired, and doing a half hour of Hatha is better than sitting on the couch!

The Flow section is somewhat harder and will definitely build a foundation a strength and coordination for those who are new to yoga.

I do feel, however, as if the video could contain one extra section to make it worthwhile.  With both sections, there is only one hour of workout, which seems kind of short.

All in all, this a good DVD for those new to yoga who want to get used to some of the basic positions.  Those who want something a bit more challenging, however, should probably look elsewhere.",1329350400,5,957,4.331460674157303

I purchased the DVD that included the strap but I am sure a towel would be just as effective.

Tamal Dodge is an excellent teacher.  The moves where easy to understand and his voice is relaxing NOT annoying.  I would not say yoga has been the only answer to my
PF but it, in addition to other measures, has greatly helped with my PF.

4601946,3,B0058UHR6W,"Why isn't there any description or comments on the strap ... Pro or con as to worth the cost included in the DVD ... Or could a person use a cloth belt they already have....buy less costly elsewhere...is the belt stretchable or not?  I just find it odd that there is no ""product description""of the strap.",1327190400,5,304,4.428571428571429
4601947,4,B0058UHR6W,"Recently purchaced this DVD to add to my collection.  My first impression is it's an excellent DVD for beginners.  Easy to follow, clear instructions, ect... So I have been regularly adding it into my daily routines.
My only dislikes for this one are that it feels like it's a rushed routine.  If he was to lengthen the time of some poses slightly & slow down transitions between poses, it would definitely create a better calming effect, allowing for breath practice & create a more relaxing experience.  To sum it up, this is more of a physical exercise routine then a calming stress reducing, meditation oriented session.
The only other slightly annoying part is every time he says exhale, he draws the word out & it sounds like he is saying eeeggggs-hale (eggs-hale).  To me it just sounds a bit weird.",1326672000,,806,4.728571428571429
4601948,5,B0058UHR6W,"Husband, teenage daughter and myself started practicing yoga at a studio. We found that we can accommodate all our schedules by doing it at home with dvd guidance. I have purchased a STACK of yoga dvds and Tamal Dodge's dvd is the only one we collectively enjoy. His voice is very relaxing and it brings your focus completely to the mat. There is the slight sound of his breathing that reminds you to breathe. Very important point - He uses descriptive terms of poses along with the Sanskrit name. Some dvds and even the studio we went to only use the Sanskrit terms...not very helpful for beginners. I found after numerous times practicing with his dvd that the Sanskrit terms came easily to me. The dvd has two sections. The first section is a great stretching routine that uses a strap. Big difference using a strap! The second section is more of a vinyasa routine -transitions between poses are smooth. It is a very well thought out dvd - scenery is nice, music is perfectly balanced with the flow. Love this dvd!!",1325808000,103,1018,4.5989010989010985
4601949,5,B0058UHR6W,This is a great DVD! A very good workout. Tamal has a fantastic teaching style and makes the workout enjoyable. I highly recommend this DVD. I'm going to get another copy and send it to my friend who just moved to Alaska and is missing the abundance of yoga classes available in California. Hopefully it will help keep her warm during the long winter. I hope to see more DVD's by Tamal in the future.,1325635200,7,400,4.346666666666667
4601950,5,B0058UHR6W,"This video literally changed my life. Been using it for two months every day, can feel the difference in my body and life. Definitely worth it, make the purchase!",1325635200,6,162,4.620689655172414
4601951,4,B0058UHR6W,"I've been practising Yoga for six or so years now so didn't really buy this DVD because I was after a beginners practice, I actually bought it because I was after a Yoga DVD featuring a male instructor which is almost impossible to find (as much as I love Shiva Rea's DVDs).

Having said that I really enjoyed this DVD. The instructor sets a great pace and explains the physical and mental aspects or the practice very clearly which brings a new depth to each pose. Being an Intermediate practitioner I can see myself coming back to this DVD every now and then when I want a slower practice.

This DVD is definitely aimed for Beginners though and unlike most of the other ""Beginnner"" DVDs on Amazon, this one would actually be perfect for real first timers or those who have only taken a few classes. Actually think I'll buy this for my mother as all of the other Beginner DVDs I've got are way too advanced for most first timers.

If you're like me however, and you find ""mirroring"" confusing (i.e. instructor says raise your right hand and he's shown raising his left) be warned as this entire DVD is in this style. Personally I don't know why instructors feel the need to do mirroring as I don't think I've ever seen it work in class and almost always confuses people who are trying to mimic the instructor only to realise they're doing it backwards. I actually found myself choosing to avoid watching the screen as to not through myself off during the arm and leg raises in the FLOW practice.

This DVD is also rather short compared to some of the other Yoga DVDs (like Shiva Reas which fit 2-3 hours of footage).

If you're after a male instructor and/or a complete beginner though I do recommend picking this up. Here's hoping Tamal releases a future DVD that is longer and un-mirrored.",1324771200,45,1792,4.518518518518518
4601952,5,B0058UHR6W,"Have been practicing with this DVD since the day it arrived.  Tamal is a fantastic teacher.  This is the best yoga DVD in my entire collection!

4601953,5,B0058UHR6W,"My husband & I received this DVD in the mail yesterday. We loved it!! We are both in our 50's trying to get back in shape-this absolutely will be a wonderful help to us! We can't wait to do it again today!! The scenery is beautiful & so is the music. Peace to all! Janey, Leo & Calico-our cat",1322956800,7,292,3.9661016949152543
4601954,5,B0058UHR6W,"I have many yoga dvds.  For almost two years I have been exploring different types of yoga disciplines, such as Iyengar and Anusara.  I previously tried two other Hatha yoga dvds, but they lacked modifications and moved too quickly.  About one month ago, I purchased the Hatha & Flow YOGA for beginners by Tamal Dodge.  I love this yoga practice!  With the Hatha flow, Tamal uses a strap with many of the poses and guides you how to approach each pose at your own pace and ability level.  The practice is challenging and I always finish feeling very relaxed. Tamal also has a soothing, calm voice and gives clear instruction so that I am able to focus on the pose and not on the screen.  He also describes the benefits of each pose as you are doing it.  I also like the Flow practice.  Tamal doesn't go too quickly, but creates a repetitive flow.  It is a great cardio workout.  I have already experience results and challenge myself to go farther into each pose each time I practice.  This is by far the best yoga instructional DVD that I have.  His positive words and guided meditation always leaves me feeling more at peace.",1322784000,327,1127,4.4926108374384235
4601955,5,B0058UHR6W,"I love this DVD.  Tamal Dodge is a remarkable yoga teacher.  The instructions are clear and the class is easy to follow.  I have been in Tamal's classes, which are great, and the DVD is almost as good as being in his class.  The photography is beautiful.  If you cannot go to Tamal's classes, this DVD is the next best thing.  I highly recommend it.",1321228800,6,349,4.292307692307692
4601956,5,B0058UHR6W,"This is an excellent yoga dvd. I'm 49 and do not wish to workout to dvd's geared towards the '20 somethings'.  This is the perfect workout for me. Excellent cuing, not to fast, just mellow. Two workouts, each 30 minutes long. First one is gentle, but challenging at the same time. The second is slightly more challenging, but not too much.  This is one of my favorites along with Rodney Yee's. It stays on top of the stack!",1321228800,8,423,4.410256410256411
4601957,5,B0058UHR6W,"Aloha & Namaste!  I just received my kit today and absolutely love Tamal's approach for beginners such as myself.  I am ""50+"" in age and I find Tamal's instruction so easy, peaceful and inspiring!  It is perfect for any age and makes great birthday or holiday gifts for loved ones.  The yoga strap is a nice touch and gift to his viewers.  I especially love how he explains in detail the importance of breathing and he explains each step in detail.  Tamal's voice and gentleness projects to the audience his love for this practice.  Thanks to Tamal, I can now learn in the comfort of my home with ease, simplicity and confidence and I know that through daily practice, Tamal's yoga will be added to my lifestyle of 'spiritual' practice.  I love the music and the beautiful landscape.  The colors are inviting!  The photography is exquisite and adds a calm and serene effect with the different panning of scenes.  I hope that Tamal continues to create a series of DVD instructions so that beginners can progress and grow along with Tamal.  Thank you so much Tamal for this beautiful project.
