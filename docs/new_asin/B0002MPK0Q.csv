2106695,3,B0002MPK0Q,"It's a great pity that 'Undead' could be much better.  Yes, it could have been a fantastic debut for the directors but its overlong running time and the low-budget.  Still, some part of it certainly reminds me of Peter Jackson and Sam Raimi's early days.

This is yet another zombie flick coming from Aussie twin brothers Michael and Peter Spierig.  The 'zombie' film (their feature debut) is, in fact, a curious concoction of genre, but the basic story is definitely that of 'Dawn of the Dead.'

The difference is, as you see in the opening, that the quiet people in the peaceful town are turned into 'undead's by ... er ... meteo showers.  Now, you get the point.  Unlike the recent remake of 'DOTD,' the film does not take itself seriously, made by the fans of the genre themselves, for the fans who know it.  And the characters are just stock types, which are no problem at all in this kind of film.

Anyway, the characters include the strong heroine Rene (Felicity Mason) and the laconic gun-slinging hermit Marion (Mungo McKay) who lives alone in forest, and who the townspeople think is a bit crazy.  Add to them, you see a pregnant woman and her love, an annoying cop and his partner.  They are all played by the unknown actors (mostly their debut), some little better than amateurs, Mason and McKay being the best.

The film's tone changes constantly.  It begins in the Sam Raimi-type tongue-in-cheek mood with (intentionally I hope) cheap gory effects.  You see an 'undead' lady punching a hole in another poor lady's head, and uh! gory scenes and decapitaions abound.

However, the film soon loses its steam, relying on occasional 'comic' effects (which are not that funny), and those situations we have seen in other previous (and more effective) zombie films, like a makeshift fort or the escape plans from there.  It is true that the film gives several surprising turns in the latter half, but though the introduced ideas are great (see the flying fish, for instance), the film itself fails to make better use of them.

'Undead' is a pretty amusing film, especially for the fans of the genre, but after watching many recent films about zombies, including 'Shawn of the Dead,' 'Undead' remains just ok.  Not a bad start for the first-time directors though.",1108252800,32,2269,4.759590792838875
2106696,5,B0002MPK0Q,"Best zombie movie of the year, style and class on a budget( ok the killer fish were kinda lame) BUY THIS FILM! Dont pay the inflated prices advertised by sellers here on amazon its available allover for cheap(got my copy for 5.99 from my local rental place)",1105833600,3,257,4.48936170212766
2106697,5,B0002MPK0Q,"I can't recommend this enough, I hired it out tonight out of curiousity and it was just brilliant.  The complaints by another reviewer regarding the cop, well, he (the cop, not the reviewer) reminded me of a lot of people I grew up with here in Queensland; the desperate squabble for power and control no matter how pointlessly arbitrary it is and his funny, obscene ranting was spot on.  If you see the movie and complain the cop isn't realistic, come to Queensland, pick a blue collar worker at random, get him REALLY drunk and ask mildly difficult questions and you'll see how accurate the character is.  The other stand out characters, Renee and Marion, are so clearly pisstakes of Hugo and Kate in Van Helsing it doesn't warrant exegesis, needless to say, it's a pisstake only Australians could do; it's like a drunken, zombie version of the Castle.

As for the movie itself, bits reminded me of Night and Dawn of the Dead, in one spot I thought of Cocoon (explaining would ruin it), the absurd gore of Bad Taste and Braindead, and arcade shooting games.  Complaints about plot are pointless; this is a pisstake pastiche of a thousand different things.  The plot is secondary in Undead, the gestures towards old horror, new horror, and myriad other points in film culture are the priority here.

I can imagine some of the humour being lost on Americans but that shouldn't matter: what I imagine being lost is the Australian in-jokes (like Dick Smart, Little Johnny and the cops) but there's plenty of the absurdity that came with Peter Jackson's films to sustain everywhere.  Australian cinema is in great shape and I'm glad to see that it still doesn't take itself too seriously.  Just watch it.",1103068800,3,1701,4.738983050847458
2106698,4,B0002MPK0Q,"I enjoyed this movie tremendously. I got the film because I am a fan of the zombie genre. And as someone who lives in Australia, the humor of a zombie film set in Queensland is inherently funny, even before you watch the film.

The entire movie is amazingly funny. The cliched pieces stolen from hollywood-esque action films are tongue-in-cheek and very well placed by the directors. Some of the humor is very Australian, which might be lost by international viewers. And the movie does become a bit flat in places. But that is to be expected for a film that was made by a couple of brothers who scrounged the hundred thousand dollar budget off friends and family, worked with unpayed actors, and did all the special effects (including one scene with airplanes and floating bodies) on their computers at home.

So I feel I have to disagree with the other reviewer - the fact that a film with no backing can have a market in the international film festivals proves to me that the Australian film industry has a real future.

This is a very funny film, created by kids who no doubt grew up watching hollywood monster-genre films. But I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see how those cliches are filtered through the humor of another culture.

And of course, for all you zombie-pic fans who want a good laugh.",1098662400,5,1323,4.593220338983051
2106699,1,B0002MPK0Q,"This movie deserves to be shelved. I have losted faint in the Australian movie Industry, being a zombie movie fan you would think I would love this movie well no. House of the dead was way more enjoyable then this cliched pile of Aussie wonder. The gore scenes are big let downs sure there are moments but they are nothing to Braindead in which critics bascially say Undead is the Australia version of braindead. This is the reason why we shouldn't make movies unless we have decent actors and a directable script and it's shot overseas.

Here is two things people in the Australia movie Industry can change to make their movies more enjoyble

Sterotypical characters eg A facist cop that even with the undead hordes he is bent on taking the guns off Marion, come on who would do that in real life?

Be with the plot and the dialog don't make up dialog as you go.

In short this movie is a dog and needs to be put to rest.

Ignore my grammer and see that this movie is hopeless. I watched it twice to see if my mind can be change, I wanted to enjoy this movie as much as other decent zombies but Undead fell flat. Don't waste your money house of the dead was better.",1098316800,3,1166,4.281818181818182

2106705,4,B0002MPK0Q,"Undead

 It seems kind of weird at the end of a Zombie movie to say to ones self Wow, that was fun but that is exactly what I said.  This Australian low budget goody is just plain fun.  From the exuberant stunts (one of the characters leaps into the air, does a flip, digs his spurs into the wall and hangs upside down while shooting Zombies.  Wow, Im breathless.) I liked the quirky dialog and the spectacular scope of the movie imagination that is shown at every turn.
 It starts conventionally enough.  A small town in rural Australia suddenly becomes victim to a rain of meteorites.  The stones from space have the ability to turn any living thing struck by them into a walking undead.  There is even a battle between a fisherman and Zombie trout.  Great stuff.  A band of survivors holds up with the local survivalist and gun dealer.  He is well armed and well equipped to survive what he suspected was coming.
 The survivors are not uniformly rational people.  Some are more often hysterical than not.  One is a cowardly bully.  Another is a shattered beauty queen, Miss Catch of the Day.  She is trying to escape from the little town when the outbreak breaks out.  The silent, brooding loner gun dealer is a scene stealer.  He is a deft hand with a gun.  The beauty queen is a deft hand with a saw blade on a broom stick.
 When the space aliens appear, we know we are on new territory.  The aliens are here to ameliorate the plague from space.  They do so with definitive alien power.
 The film written, produced, directed and special effects supervised by Peter and Michael Spierg.  The actors are all Australians and not familiar to American audiences.
 This movie has a little something for everybody.  The alien effects are strange and well done.  The Zombies are traditional brain eaters, which I always appreciate.  The overall tone of the film is a little bit sideways-the perspective from down under I suppose.  I found that to be refreshing.
 This Aussie import from 2003 runs 104 minutes.  It is rated R for gore, some language and lots and lots of Zombie slaying. Three strong brains for this recommended film.",1425945600,,2128,4.592

2106707,5,B0002MPK0Q,"I'm a huge horror movie fan, always with an eye open for a good zombie flick.  Unfortunately, with all the zombie films being churned out, most of them end up stinking.  I'm a little harsher when judging these films because it shouldn't be this hard to make a good one.  Look at some of the great ones made on a shoestring budget or from foreign countries like Shaun of the Dead and The Horde.  Well I feel Undead definitely joins the ranks of these greats.  Who wouldn't love Marion, the giant, Australian, Hill-Billy, John Woo style, gun toting, zombie killer with his triple shot gun (one more then the double shot gun used in the movie Phantasm 2).  For a million bucks, the Spierig brothers directed and wrote a well made, polished film.  There's plenty of blood, gore effects and awesome zombie kill scenes.  The story is an interesting new take on the zombie genre but I don't want to give anything away.  Overall, I found it very entertaining and for me that's what counts when it comes to watching movies.  Listening to the Crew Commentary, I admired the commitment and sincerity that the people involved put forth in making the film.  Too bad it didn't do well.

2106710,3,B0002MPK0Q,"A piece of space debris falls from the sky and hits an old lady.  She's instantly turned into a zombie with definite `containment' issues.

Undead is and isn't and is a zombie flick.  It's also supposed to be a comedy.  It takes an awful lot for granted.  Unfortunately, it doesn't really deliver any of what it promises because it's so busy trying to be too many things.  And at 104 minutes, it is a long stretch trying to juggle all these loopy ideas into one coherent piece.  It doesn't help matters that most of the characters are unpleasant caricatures (in particular Dirk Hunter as the certifiably obnoxious officer who tries to ride roughshod over everyone as he screams his dialog).  The few inventive scenes get buried under all the wreckage of things gone wrong.  (There is one startling image of people suspended in space that is quite captivating.)

But.  I just couldn't get past the personalities of the players to care what happened to them.  I will say that it moved along at a good clip even as it sometimes strayed.  I've watched it twice and I'm debating whether to keep it to watch again at a much later date.",1413331200,,1129,4.585

2106712,5,B0002MPK0Q,"Purchased this movie and really enjoyed it. Undead mimics the same formula dark humor of Return of the Living Dead and Return of the Living Dead 2 - it's serious and gory when it needs to be, and the dark humor happens at the right moments. The movie also uses Jon Woo-style combat sequences, where the main protagonist does outlandish things while dispatching the undead. In one particular scene, we see the hero toss his handguns into the air, grab a shotgun to shoot a group of zombies, and then discard of the shotgun just before his handguns land on the ground. The movie is full of these exaggerated, but well choreographed moments. Basically, the movie is fun to watch from start to finish. And since it revives the dark humor of zombie movies from yesteryear, I strongly recommend Undead to any fan of the zombie horror movie genre (especially if you enjoyed the first two Return of the Living Dead movies).",1401148800,,915,4.654320987654321

2106714,3,B0002MPK0Q,"This is an OK movie, worthy of maybe 2.5 stars instead of the 3 that I gave it - just finished watching it. This movie is about a small town in Australia that experiences a meteor shower that makes the dead arise. A small band of survivors are shacked up in a house trying to outrun and survive the ever present zombie menace. There was a vehicle accident on a road that townspeople kept trying to use but, whenever they stopped to investigate, zombies would suddenly appear and then everyone is running through the woods instead of running back to their perfectly functioning vehicles and trying to drive away - makes one think what one would do in similar circumstances. Acid rain comes and everyone starts burning; there is zombie F-I-S-H; ALIENS come and spread a cordon around the town and start abducting certain people; BLOOD & GORE everywhere; everyone learns how to kill the zombies by trial-&-error, NOT automatically shooting for the head; crazy stunts; plenty of gunfire, even if a particular weapon would be out of ammo in 6 shots; BLOOD & GORE; GORE & BLOOD!!! Overall, thought that this was a FUN movie to watch - something different. I thought that it kind of resembled a comedic ""Night of the Living Dead"", sort of ""Shaun of the Dead"", with a lot of ""Dead Alive"" all mingled together, as well as a few other movies.

Soon, they discover that there's alot more going on than just a virus turning everyone into zombies. That's it, basically. Come to think of it, the plot is pretty typical as well.

Despite the fact that Undead is pretty typical; it is, however, a good mix of action, black humor and horror. It's a good movie for the 97 minutes that it lasts. I found it rather entertaining. Kinda reminds me of another movie I saw recently, called Black Sheep.

overtones.  The movie didn't quite work for me.  I am old-school.  I believe
in funny shows, comedy drama, comedy action, and even shows like ""Shawn of the Dead"".
Stranger movies, like ""Pulp Fiction"" had comedy that worked.  This one didn't
mix.  It is different.  You may like it, but most people are not as long suffering
as me.  If you buy this movie, I bet it gets ""re-gifted""!",1333929600,,756,4.84375

This movie was filled with suspense, silly, and greatly executed. I also like the way it was filmed - and of course...the reason for watching it...the zombies. The main character's gun tricks were rad (although silly), but you get the idea that they were meant to be over the top. You can't go wrong here. Like I said, I could usually do without the campiness, but with this movie, it just made it that much better. The only thing I could have done without, was the super annoying pregnant girl.",1331856000,,661,4.426229508196721
2106742,1,B0002MPK0Q,"Wow is this movie terrible, it looks like it has promise for about 2 seconds in the beginning, then it becomes an awkward and pathetic attempt to be a comedy. I honestly have no idea why the directors said that every character except the 'cool' 'badass' bearded guy has to scream every last syllable of dialogue they have, was that supposed to be funny? Was that supposed to make the movie scary? All it does is make the characters unbearable and unfortunately they don't all die off instantly. Then there's the tough cool bearded guy, (we'll call him Twinkle) who's the lamest try-hard wannabe I've seen in a movie, he just grunts all of his lines and doesn't mind when the cops scream and point guns in his face for the billionth time. What a damn sissy, he doesn't even take control of the hectic situation, this guy's supposed to be a badass? Oh then there's the main character girl, who is basically Twinkle's lapdog protege, grunting her dialogue as well and having no emotional range. So you'll either hear screaming or monotone grunting from our 'heroes' while they try to scrape together what few braincells they have.

So this group of idiots go to Twinkle's house and eventually wander into his bomb shelter that has no food, no water, and no bathroom, it's literally just a metal room with empty shelves, which remind the audience over and over how idiotic and spastic these guys are. It's like watching a bunch of stoners try to survive in a zombie apocalypse or more accurately, watching paint dry. Then when our heroes are in the bomb shelter the pregnant woman decides that she's going to have her baby in their temporary safe zone and they must leave to get the plot moving (finally). When they're out of the safe zone and driving around the woman suddenly can hold the baby in for the remainder of the movie, but no one decides to go back to the safe room because they're all very, very special individuals, much like the two directors.

They drive out of the town and eventually hit a wall with spikes, and in all their wisdom they decide to hang out in front of it while one of the cops attempts to climb it. If you can tell at this point Undead decides it's not going to be a straight-forward zombie film which would help if the directors knew how to have cohesion and flow in a movie, but instead it's all a confusing mess that barely makes sense in the last five minutes. I've tried watching this movie twice now (the first time because the trailer made it look good, and the second time to try to laugh at how bad it is) and at the point where they reach the wall I mentally shut down, it's that stupid. The last half of the movie is a blur of screaming, Twinkle's bare white asscheeks (that's the most horrifying image in this film btw), people floating in the sky, Aliens making really awkward unfunny sex jokes, the main character poses for the cover of the movie, and it's finally over.

I can't even recommend this steaming pile of crap to MST3K it, it's just so unbearably terrible. I almost forgot about the music in this film, it sounds like porno music and it constantly plays in the background of the whole movie.

2106748,4,B0002MPK0Q,"When I first bought this little sleeper gem, I had no clue what I was getting into. I love zombie movies. My 1st one was Nigh of the Living Dead at a drive-in (gosh, if I had the bucks, I would make the drive-in of all drive-ins). My parents had a VW bus & I was in the back seat watching while everyone else was asleep. My mom woke up to see the little girl killing her mom w/the garden tool. She yelled ""Oh my God! Ed, wake up! We're leaving!"" I pleaded as we drove off, b/c it was a triple-feature & the last movie, Day of the Triffids was coming on & I so wanted to see it (I still never got to see it). Lo & behold I never got to see the end of George Romero's classic until some 20+ yrs later (I have ADHD...it takes me awhile to finish things...but you'd never guess that, right?). I was hooked immediately once I saw the ending...of course I was hooked before that b/c I always had that incomplete feeling in the back of my head...and it wasn't my haircut.
Well, back to this movie. It was nothing at all what I had expected. And thanx to having ADHD, I got to watch it a number of times before I finally remembered how the story went. Everyone I've shown it to has liked it b/c of how it turns out. Cult-movie yes. But I bet anyone watching it will mostly like it except for pic-aparty-poopers, like some folks I told to watch ""What about Bob?"" that told me later it was the worst movie they had ever seen...I was so surprised by their facial expressions of disgust that I never recommended a movie to them again. Of course, since it was a rental, I wonder if something else got slipped in there...hmmm. Ya just never know, eh?
I only had one small complaint about the movie. The terrible shooting. With as many bullets being shot I would have expected a bit more destruction, altho it was good for those that survived the lead hailstorm b/c at least they would be coming back ""normified"". In that sense it was good that none of them could shoot well. But I kept thinking ""head-shot you numbskulls...everyone knows you need to take out zombies w/a head shot!"" However, in a sense, all the shooting & missing is more realistic b/c even in real gun battles (as in cops vs robbers) there are more misses than hits.
Each character did their part well. From the irritating ""need-to-control-freak"" police chief (I forgot one more dislike-I can handle swearing...God knows I used to do it myself being a Marine...but it was a bit overkill, altho if it was intended to fit his character, maybe I could understand it...but I still could have done w/a bit less...ok, a lot less, out of just one mouth), to the ""50-shot 1-kill"" outback survivalist Marion, to the late-bloomer heroine Rene...I think this crew did a bangaroo job considering their low budget. It doesnt look like it ever came out on any US theaters. I think this would have been perfect for an outdoor theater movie.
Well, that's all for now. (""Phew, thank God...we thought this newby reviewer was never going to shut up. & what in the world is all the rubbish about his early childhood...one would think he's going to blame all of his problems b/c he never got to see the end of 'Night of the Living Dead' for 20+ yrs.

2106749,3,B0002MPK0Q,"It's understandable that Undead (2003) might develop a cult following.  Shot in Australia, it's a zombie movie that also features an extra-terrestrial visitation.  The film features surprisingly good special effects for the alien component, and a decent amount of blood and gore for the zombie part.  The story is inventive, but the plot at times isn't very plausible.  Still in the end, it's a weird and entertaining ride, that's mostly worth taking.

A meteor shower is apparently the cause of a zombie outbreak in the Australian town of Berkeley.  Fleeing from the sudden zombie outbreak, Rene (Felicity Mason) seeks safety at the farmhouse of Marion (Mungo McKay), a man who claims to have been abducted by aliens.  They are soon joined by Harrison (Dirk Hunter) and Molly (Emma Randall), a couple of nitwit cops, and Wayne (Rob Jenkins) and his pregnant wife Sallyanne (Lisa Cunningham).  Fortunately, Marion is a survivalist type, who has weapons and a hardened shelter under his house, which the group takes refuge in, after being attacked by the zombies.  The group later makes a break from the house in a van, but find that there is a barrier around the town that prevents them from going further.

Mysterious robed aliens with hoods, arrive to rid man of the infection.  The aliens cause strange rains to fall, and to keep the cured safe, they are suspended high in the sky.  The plan almost works, except that one infected person manages to get clear of the barrier around the town.

Written and directed by brothers Michael and Peter Spierig, The Undead starts out as a zombie horror/comedy, and finishes as a more serious post apocalyptic tale.  With a group of mostly buffoonish characters, and zombies that continually pop out of nowhere, the comedy element works pretty well, as the group is constantly on the verge of disaster.  Marion is an over the top cartoonish figure, who wields handguns like Chow Yun Fat, and is full of cryptic remarks.  Harrison is pompous loon, while Molly is a goof that is slow on the trigger.  After so much inept silliness, the transition to a more serious tone, doesn't play that well.  The color processing of the film is a bit odd, often either too blue, or too yellow.  The film does however benefit from a strong score by Cliff Bradley.

Some of the zombie fights are stylish, and have a dark sense of humor that is fun to watch.  The undead are the slow moving type, and mostly just get shot to pieces.  The special effects in general, are very impressive for a lower budget film.  Although the blend of comedy/horror with serious science fiction isn't a perfect match, Undead is solid provocative effort that is worth seeing.  The DVD is subtitled, and has some decent extras that includes some deleted and extended scenes, and a making of featurette.",1301443200,,2806,4.810020876826722

2106753,5,B0002MPK0Q,"After reading many of the 100 reviews of this film so far, it kinda seems like everyone watched a different movie. Very odd. Lots of people admitted they didn't get it and therefore didn't like it.  The rest who didn't like it, clearly didn't get it (based on what they wrote).

But this movie delivered everything a zombie fan (such as myself) could hope for, plus so much more.  Maybe it isn't very scary - I can't tell anymore, because I guess I've seen too much to be frightened by this stuff anymore.  But the zombies are pretty good, the gore is cool and plentiful, the characters are all hilarious (except the female lead, who's level headed, as YOU might hope to be in such a freaky situation, making her relatable), plus a completely unexpected additional aspect to the story.  And that's a key to the movie's unique social commentary (ala Mr. Romero).

""Undead"" is a fun zombie flick that pays tribute to numerous types of action movies, such as martial arts, spaghetti westerns, zombie horror, sci-fi, and throws in what I'd describe as hilarous ""sketch comedy"" characters.  And, it's almost as absurd as ""Army of Darkness.""  Not as perfect a zombie comedy as ""Shaun of the Dead,"" but almost as funny and a whole lot gorier.

There was a lot of blood and gore applied liberally to the sets and even some decent special effects, but what made this movie enjoyable were the humorous elements and an odd plot twist.

It sounds like plastic music where everything is synthetic... it's intrusive, boring, irritating, adds nothing, expresses nothing and it's everywhere!!!!

The cinematography is also a big problem because is it too dark and most of the time it is pitch black. The basement scene is ridiculous: all you see are flashlights moving around (with that horrible music). How can you relate to characters you barely see?

Special effects are a mixed bag. The early minutes of the film, when the meteorites fall from the sky are simply fabulous! The makeup effects are also great. But after the first 20 minutes, the effects get crappier and crappier. The light spots from the clouds look as bad as bad can be.

The actors seem to be good, but the characters are cardboard looking... and the cops look like they came from an Ed Wood film. Then the ""Cowboy"" character who uses the triple shotgun has a voice that looks like an impersonation of Clint Eastwood. And it looks like it was dubbed.

And most of the ""fresh"" ideas we see have been done before... like the legs that keep on walking after it's zombie torso has been separated by a blast. I've seen that one before.

In the vein of Night of the Living Dead, we find six people hiding in a farm house, completely surrounded by Zombies brought forth by a meteor shower. As they make their escape, we watch their numbers dwindle until there's only one left, or as the movie puts it, ""Strong ones are always the last left.""
The stunts in this film seem to be influenced by John Woo films and the Zombies themselves are the slow moving kind, making them all the more scarier.
While the movie itself isn't scary and there are certainly no ""Boo!"" moments, it's a decent Zombie movie that any fan of Shaun of the Dead or Dead Alive should check out.
Pizza, beer and friends should make this movie all the more enjoyable.

However, he attacks later in the film and one can see he's miraculously in one piece. A child zombie is brained at the beginning of the film and she's mark free in another scene.

The acting is wooden and the characters were forgettable. They even started to annoy me after the first 30 minutes. Everyone knows that zombies are taken out with a shot to the head. Apparently, the good people of Berkley never saw a Romero film. The characters shot the Zombies with clumsy abandon. Until the someone happens to hit one of them in noggin with a well placed shot between the eyes.

Other than those complaints, the movie surprisingly keeps one guessing at the plot twists. The film comes together really well, and I don't want to ruin the surprise at the climax. Just in case one does want to see, Un dead.

Should you find the film at the library, or a friend lends it to you or you catch it on cable on demand. By all means sit down and enjoy it. However, I really don't recommend buying it.

Instead of leaving giant craters and demolished buildings in their wake, these meteors leave something else: an infection that transforms humans into zombies.

The town now overrun with the undead, Rene barely survives and meets up with Marion (played by Mungo McKay), the town nut who claimed he was abducted by aliens a long time before. Soon joined by others, the group of survivors find temporary solace in Marion's cabin before the dead come a'knockin' and force their way in.

Blood and guts ensue as this band of not-so-merry-men try and fight their way through throngs of the undead and leave town.

They almost make it, too, if not for that giant, spike-laden wall bordering the town, keeping everyone inside.

This flick starts off as your run-of-the-mill zombie movie. Nothing wrong with that. Not at all. The blood, the guts, the guns--ah, yes, everything that makes up a good zombie flick. Even Marion's Matrix-like fighting style works well in the context of the story (though when that style was first introduced, I had a hard time buying it but quickly got used to it).

What separates this zombie flick from all others I've seen is the twist it takes when we find out these aren't your standard zombies, but instead the product of ""something beyond,"" namely intergalactic stuff. Toss in a few aliens and you got yourself a unique zombie film that pays more homage to the zombie clichs than actually follows them like a rulebook.

This is an independent film and I only point that out because it being indy really added to the gritty feel of the whole thing, enhancing the movie. This didn't carry that too-smooth-yet-too-cheap look that B-movies have. Even the directors' love for the genre really shone through in this and the cast did a fantastic job.

I can understand now why this movie got the cult following it did.

And lastly lets not forget the story told by Mungo himself about getting attacked by the 10"" fish. A real tear jerker guaranteed not to leave a dry eye in the house..

2106772,4,B0002MPK0Q,"Undead (The Speirig Brothers, 2003)

The last thing I was expecting from the surprisingly-heavily-promoted (and unsurprisingly-narrowly-released-in-America) Undead, based on the big, murky promo posters, was comedy. But that's exactly what I got. Better yet, we got a zombie flick that has pretensions of being a fifties sci-fi B movie-- imagine crossing Night of the Living Dead with The Day the Earth Stood Still with the script being written by Broken Lizard and you've got a good idea of where the Speirig Brothers are coming from here.

Rene (the stunning Felicity Mason, recently of Hollywood) is a small-town beauty queen who'll do anything to get out. She is, in fact, on the verge of doing just that when things go horribly, horribly wrong-- a meteor shower bombards the town, killing hundreds of people, all of whom rise as zombies and start attacking the other townspeople (as zombies, of course, are won't to do), turning them into zombies as well. Rene flees into the home of Marion (Inspector Gadget 2's Mungo McKay), a reclusive fisherman with a taste for weaponry. Other survivors congregate in the house, and the stage is set for a protracted siege between man and zombie. Except those aren't the only two species coming to the party...

The surprising thing about Undead is that it doesn't play its comedy straight, the way Slither or Return of the Living Dead do; there's always something slimy and uncomfortable just beneath the surface making you feel dirty as you're laughing at this. You know you're not supposed to be laughing at the stuff you're laughing at. If the Spierig Brothers, who are also responsible for the twisted, twisted script here, were attempting to simulate the unintentionally-hysterical factor of fifties B movies, they have succeeded in such a way that Undead may end up being remembered as one of the great satires of all time; a lot of movies have poked fun at the genre (and at themselves) by parodying that brand of humor, but few, if any, picked up on the ugliness that often lies beneath it. Here it is in spades.

The more I think about it, the better this movie was. You want to see this. ****",1169683200,2,2146,4.839237057220709

2106774,5,B0002MPK0Q,"First of all, I read other reviews to this movie, before I decided to take on this task. And I was just wondering what the hell is wrong with people? I mean, when did:

1. People became Siskel and Ebert... oops I mean Roper???

2. People stop sitting back and enjoy the art of the movie???

I mean, lets be honest. If the movie was really that bad, you wouldn't have watched the whole thing right? I wouldn't have. This is a classic, true to the genre B Horror Flick. There is gore, humor, and things that don't make any sort of conceivable sense. The only thing that it seems to lack is nudity. I have never seen such Baddassism in a fisherman, before in my life. I don't think that is a word, nor do I care. If I was to have to fight along side someone against an army of the living dead it would be that fisherman guy. I mean, any guy that can kill a Zombie with a shaken can of a energy drink (think red bull) stuffed in the Zombies mouth then throws a nail at it to make it explode, decapitating the Zombie, is ok in my book.

2106775,1,B0002MPK0Q,"Well, i just got done watching this movie and actually went out of my way to write this review.  Truthfully, i didn't catch the last 20 or so minutes because i found myself doing other things around the house and could  care less about what happend.

The trailers and the DVD cover of this movie is very misleading.  One would think that they are going to see something from a great genre of horror movies about zombies and a group of people doing whatever it takes to survive.  I'm a big fan of Romero movies and loved 28 days later so i thought this movie would be a cool australian take-off.  I couldn't be more wrong.  Nothing in the movie makes sense from the start.  The entire movie is over the top starting with the actors.  Everybody has entirely too much dialogue except for the main character who hardly says two words during the entire movie.  She looks lost, confused, and out of her league.  Other characters include a local pilot and his pregnant girlfriend, a ""wacky"" police sgt with his asthmatic partner, the bait & tackle clerk who never screams during the entire movie, and our heroin character who won the local beauty contest.

The movie takes place in a small town in austrialia somewhere.  When meteors strike the earth (and slam into people), it unleashes a germ which causes people to become zombies.  Our main characters all meet up and try to survive.  However, aliens are involved so the story goes from a survival story to beams of light dressed in capes and floating around right in the middle of a big battle.  The viewer is left to wonder what's going on at first, but as the dialogue and story become unbearably bad, you find yourself not caring as the minutes tick by.  I honestly couldn't tell you much else because it's just so terrible that I just simply couldn't take a minute more.  Bad acting, bad dialogue, over the top effects, and some of the worst camera work i've ever seen.  This movie apparently took two years to make... imagine if they only had one???

Another portion of this movie that makes me ill is the bait & tackle charater.  He shows up out of nowhere and saves the heroin's life like a bad clint eastwood impression (with big hat covering his eyes to boot).  Then, he walks away.  When he appears again, he's able to do these matrix style backflips (digging his ""spurs"" into the wall/ceiling) and making two pistols jump over his back and land directly into his hands.  Does this guy ever miss?  What do you think?  He manages to kill about 50 zombies with his two pistols while hanging from the wall upside down.  Not bad for a bait and tackle salesman living in the backwoods of australia!

If you dig the gore, this one is ok... but again, wayyyy over the top.  I had no idea that one bullet from a .45 could blow someone in half.  Our characters are so clueless that it actually takes them 3/4 of the movie to figure out how to shoot them in the head.  I personally counted several scenes where a character is shooting a police revolver and somehow manages to get 13 shots out of a 6 shooter.  Someone get NASA on the phone and explain how you can do that because i just don't get it.

The absolutely worst part of this movie, without a doubt, is the music.  It never stops!  There's never a scene without music for some reason!  And it just makes what you're watching seem absolutely cheesy!  It reminded me of a 1950's serial/pirate swashbuckling kind of thing with guys swinging on ropes and jumping across a gorge kind of thing.  The soundtrack is truly the worst i've ever heard with extra cheese included.  Did they use up their budget on the effects?  Probably!  I found myself wishing that i could mute the music during the film!

If you're a fan of good monster / zombie movies, i beg you to pass this one by and keep on moving.  It doesn't make sense, the story is amazingly weak, the plot is... well, there isn't one... you'll wish you could have your 2 hours back.  I know i do!!!",1165017600,4,3955,4.440890125173852

Previous forays in the ""Under $3"" shelves at Blockbuster have yielded such forgettable and awful films as ""Savage Island"", ""Python"" and ""Night of the Komodo"". So I was pleasantly surprised by ""Undead"". What could have been a paint by the numbers zombie flick is taken to the next level with a witty script, decent acting & great special effects. Sure, at the core it is a standard farm-country overrun by the living (and hungry) dead. But ""Undead"" offers quite a few laughs, (you WILL be laughing when the guy is attacked by the zombie fish!), the special effects are really a notch above what is expected with this type of movie. Sure some of the blood is excessive in that ""Kill Bill"" kind of way, but the effects are done well. And for a group of no-name actors (at least here in the U.S.), they do a great job. If you are in the mood for a solid B-Movie, then be sure to pick this one up. You will get quite a few laughs, (the intentional kind, not in the so-bad-it's-funny way), a couple of times where you'll jump....in short it's everything the big-studio, big-budget flick ""Slither"" tried to be.

2106778,5,B0002MPK0Q,"At first reflection after finishing Undead, it would be tempting to say, ""ho-hum, another zombie movie""----and that's what it is.  But that doesn't mean clich has to be droll.  This was the problem the Spierig Brothers seemed to have when they conceived this film.  How did they get around the problem?  They embraced the clich and ran with it!  What Undead is, therefore, is one part serious Romero mythology, one part Shaun of the Dead screwball, and a final part dark, X-Files style location.  It has a leg up on other zombie films in that the characters are pretty memorable.  Whereas most heroes/heroines who get put into these undead predicaments are faceless semi-professionals, our good guys in Undead are pretty much bottom of the barrel-an asthmatic deputy, a hyper-geeky sheriff, a former beauty queen for fish, a pregnant woman who lost to the beauty queen, and a soldier of fortune-like fisherman, whose gun shop has tanked.  As zombie movies go, the mayhem of zombie against human is kept relatively low; there are some great scenes of fists getting put through peoples skulls and chests, but these are the exception rather than the Dawn of the Dead-like norm.  What gets done to the zombies, however, is another matter entirely.  The extras on the DVD are almost worth the purchase.  My favorite is the zombie training featurette that has some of the zombie actors going through special yoga motions to prepare them for the zombie state of being they will assume on-screen.  One of the interesting tidbits you get from the main featurette is how, like other indie zombie films such as The Dead Next Door, this film was an act of love that started when two kids fell in love with the cheap video rentals they would watch late at night.  So take courage all you would-be Fulcis and Romeros!",1159488000,,1803,4.796116504854369
2106779,3,B0002MPK0Q,"Let's see: low budget, abysmal acting, underwhelming f/x, overdone zombie premise...I'll tell you what, even with all those negative elements, Undead still turns out to be a fairly diverting film. It helps to not expect too much going into it. These are new directors, and they've signed onboard an unheard-of cast of Aussies. The tone is tongue in cheek, the emphasis is on cheesy humor and gore, gore, and gore. Bearing that in mind, you might find yourself having a blast watching this.

Twin brothers and directors Peter and Michael Spierig knew that Australia isn't well known for churning out horror movies, which is the reason they decided to make Undead. The so-not-new premise has an infestation of the undead overwhelming the tiny Australian town of Berkeley. Surly beauty queen Rene (enormous-eyed Felicity Mason) is hightailing it out of town when she notices streaking meteorites plummeting nearby. Finding her shortcut exit blocked by crashed vehicles, she is assaulted by zombies. She fends them off and finds refuge in a lonely farmhouse, where she bumps into Marion (Mungo McKay), the well-armed town loony/recluse.

Soon, they are joined by four other survivors: a pregnant woman, an airplane pilot, and two police folks. But the zombies can sniff out the living and the six finds themselves trapped by invading ghouls and are forced into making a run for it. In their desperate bid to stay alive, they must also survive the acid rain which burns their flesh and face the unearthly cloaked figures who sporadically appear...As the group is quickly decimated, it's up to Rene to make a final stand.

If the crappy CGI effects don't discourage you, they might ultimately add a certain fun flavor to the film. My buddies and I ended up happily throwing popcorn at the screen, which, believe it or not, is probably something the directors intended. I must say, however, that the sequence near the end, where the pilot flies his plane in the night sky and witnesses...something, showcases some decent f/x. While not clever or that original, Undead does come up with fairly entertaining ways to kill zombies. And, on the zombie's side, there's one pretty cool scene early on, in which an undead fist punches clear thru a victim's skull.

While Undead, understandibly, isn't as resoundingly successful as Shaun of the Dead, it does give a hearty raspberry to the zombie genre. Undead doesn't take itself serious, so you shouldn't, either; just sit back and enjoy. I actually got a kick out of how long it took the frantic numbnuts to figure out that shooting the brain-eaters in the brain would stop 'em dead.

Again, tongue in cheek. Undead plants a knowing elbow into your ribcage as it every now and then unleashes hokey comments, uttered with straight-faced gusto, from its characters: ""When I was a kid, we respected our parents. We didn't f***in' eat 'em!"" or ""Aggie has the keys, but she doesn't have a brain!"" Meanwhile, Marion's throwdown with the zombie fish made beer come out of my nose. Undead also has fun by having the husky, overalls-clad Marion occasionally burst into graceful, John Woo/Matrix-style zombie butt-kicking moves. Incongruous? Yes. Funny? Why, yes.

So, by all means, give this flick a chance. Try it for its manic energy, its cheesy humor, and for its segue to another genre in the second half of the film. If for nothing else, I give Undead full marks for trying to be something a bit different.",1157587200,,3439,4.9309153713298794

  All of our familiar friends are holed up here from the loony cops, spiteful pregnant waitress, her clueless boyfriend, misunderstood beauty queen, and badass fisherman (whose fashion taste takes after Torgo from MANOS, THE HANDS OF FATE).  Our sympathies are tied to the multiple-barrel shotgun wielding fisherman Marion (Mungo McKay) and the lovely Rene (Felicity Mason).  The pair carves a swath through a seemingly endless supply of reanimated corpses only to find that zombies aren't the full extent of their worries.

  Comparing UNDEAD to Australia's other famous zombie film, DEAD ALIVE, is a tempting albeit simplistic temptation.  It's true that both films share similarities in their use of the walking dead and barrels of fake blood but what the pair share most is their wicked sense of humour.  The excessive gore, kinetic camerawork, and outlandish action mix well with the cross genre antics.  Hopefully this wonderfully silly film is a sign of things to come from the Spierig brothers.

2106786,3,B0002MPK0Q,"""Undead"" is an Australian zombie movie written and directed by the Spierig Brothers, Michael and Peter.  They also did the editing and the visual effects (supposedly on their home computer).  What they have produced is sort of a zombie comedy, although peculiar to the sensibilities of those who live Down Under, which simply means that it is an acquired taste.  It is certainly different from what we have seen in ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Dead & Breakfast.""  For example, you will see a man punch out zombie fish that are leaping at him, and punching holes through people so you can see right through their head or chest is a gag that is supposed to overcome your gag reflex.  But if you do not know that zombie movies in the 21st century are not for the squeamish, then this could well be the film to acquaint you with that reality.

This film takes place in the small fishing village of Berkeley in Queensland, Australia.  Rene (Felicity Mason), has won the Miss Catch of the Day beauty pageant but lost the family farm, so she is leaving town.  Otherwise there is a cricket match going on, when suddenly a meteor shower stops everybody from doing what they are doing because people start turning into zombies.  This is the point in the film where we have the small group of human survivors trying to fight off the zombies and avoid becoming one of the undead.  This is where Rene meets up with Marion (Mungo McKay), a local fisherman who knows exactly what is going on, namely an alien invasion that involves zombie fish, a giant spiked wall surrounding the town, and much, much more.  That is why he has the cool weapon made out of three strapped together shotguns.  Unfortunately, the more Marion explains what is going on and the rules of the game peculiar to this film, the more confused you might be.  This is much more of a science fiction film that most zombie fests, but that is not necessarily a good thing.  The zombies are more than enough fun, did we really need to bring alien into it?

""Undead"" won the FIPRESCI Prize at the 2003 Melbourne International Film Festival, ""For daring to be everything that Australian films are not supposed to be: part of a popular, disreputable genre.""  The prize committee declared, ""We commend it as an entertainment that is also political, while showing the pleasures of hands-on filmmaking.""  I mention this because there is something to be said for how the Spierig Brothers do not stop once the kitchen sink has gone into the mix and keep on piling it higher and deeper.  Zombie movies are not great works of cinema, even a low budget cult classic like the original ""Night of the Living Dead.""  They are excuses for all sorts of excesses in terms of blood and guts, and on that score ""Undead"" certainly delivers.  Just do not try to explain it to anybody else, because you will probably lose them when you get to the zombie fish.",1148169600,,2883,4.582846003898635

2106788,2,B0002MPK0Q,"The plot of Undead is still a mystery to me, even after seeing it and paying attention to every waking second, trying to figure out what in the world the movie was trying to say.  Undead attempts (and fails) to be some sort of zombie movie and alien invasion movie hybrid.  What starts out as an OK zombie film turns into a convoluted, unexplainable foray into aliens invading our planet.  The first big problem that I had with this film, is that, of course, the characters in the beginning don't know how to ""kill"" a zombie.  At this stage in zombie cinema, I am pretty sure that any zombie film you make, the characters in the film should already know that a head shot is what takes out a zombie for good.  Characters who somehow don't know that already are simply to unbelievably frustrating to even watch onscreen.  The other big problem that I had with the movie was the whole alien invasion angle they tried to play at the end.  Now I don't really care what causes your zombie infestation, but don't try to combine genres to explain what is going on.  The meteor shower at the beginning of the film was a good enough reason for me that a zombie outbreak would happen.  That is as far as you need to go in a zombie film.  From the moment that you explain the zombies, a zombie movie should focus on the main characters, how they survive, and doing as many gory, disgusting zombie kills as possible.  Undead, unfortunately, doesn't do this.  In fact, it has no focus whatsoever.  The whole alien thing isn't ever even explained, therefore the whole movie seems pointless, in my mind.

Also, Undead seems to be another one of these horror movies that tries to be scary and funny at the same time.  That just doesn't work for me.  Undead made me smile at a few parts, but overall I just wanted to watch a quality, independent zombie film, and what I got was some inexplicable, unfunny film that tried to play both sides of the fence when it had no reason to do so.",1144022400,,1966,4.404432132963989

I don't regret buying it, I've seen some really horrible ""zombie"" movies, and this certainly is not one of them.  I rate it 3.5 stars.  I'm glad I added it to my collection, although it is not spectacular, it's not bad either.",1143590400,,613,4.428571428571429
2106792,1,B0002MPK0Q,"Now please do not take this as a compliment when I say this may well have been the worst film I have ever seen. I don't mean it like that. I don't mean it was good awful, or even shocking. It was really, really a stinker.

The characters aren't just stiff and unsympathetic--they're unwatchable. You literally spend the whole setup period sweating like a Vogon poetry read, just begging the zombies to come eat everyone. But then when the zombies arrive, they are the gosh-awfulest marriage of the Evil Dead style uberpowerful rip your head off zombie with the Romero style slow zombie. Huh? It makes the kills profoundly dissatisfying. Not funny, not scary, just vaguely painful like a dull headache.

Aliens are involved, but they barely have five lines of dialogue and most of them are: ""the earthling begins to understand"" drivel.

Now you'd think with a movie like this, the effects would be one of the down points. Quite the opposite. It looks pretty slick. The alien transporters (think Galaxy Quest) look great. The meteorites that cause the plague are dang nice looking for a low budget film. The aliens even aren't bad--though here the low budget does show, particularly in long shots. The scene of a sky full of humans splayed out in crusifiction pose, hovering in the cloud filled stormy night sky is actually stunning.

Alas from the trailer I saw and the front cover I was expecting a grisly post apocalypse zombie flick--like 28 Days Later meets Fallout. I pictured crumbling ruins ruled by the undead, and folks in gas masks purged of all sympathy cruising the wastes preying on survivor and zombie alike. Sortova Land of the Dead on the move in the desert. Arg...was I ever wrong.

This is not to say, however that if you're looking for a comedy instead that you won't be in for any more of a woeful suprize. Nothing funny here, and the groans you hear won't be the zombies, they'll be your own.",1142985600,3,1912,4.678571428571429

This movie was outright TERRIBLE. Some say it is funny, now that one I dont' get unless you are using an illeagal substance.

Others say that this movie is right up there with all the other Zombie movies, and to that I say, ""Which ones have you been watching?""

I gave this movie only 1 star for the gore and I am a DIE-HARD ZOMBIE MOVIE FAN. The acting was terrible and the story was well, just outright stupid. I mean COME ON PEOPLE -  A fisherman who used to own a gun shop is the best they can do for one of the main actors? Especially with all of his gun props. 3 Shotguns together as a weapon, hey, cool ideas, but again: UNREALISTIC. (Maybe only in some backwoods place would you see that, but not in a small town)

And, the zombie fish was just pathetic. It would have made more sense if he got attacked by pirhanas. Give me a break!

Unfortunately, they left this movie open to another one and to that I say, ""Good luck getting this one a budget as well!""

2106800,4,B0002MPK0Q,"Like many other reviewers I too found this movie similar to early Sam Raimi films (Evil Dead anyone?).  It doesn't try to take itself seriously, and it does a respectable job with the obviously limited budget.  Is it on the same level as Dawn of the Dead?  Absolutely not.  But guess what, it wasn't trying to be.  Humor abounds, even during action sequences when the 'good guys' are going one on one with the undeads.  These zombies are more like those of the Return of the Living Dead series in that, unless you completely cut them to pieces, they keep getting up and coming, no matter where you shoot them.

The idea behind the film was very original, and unlike most zombie films, they included the reason behind the outbreak as well as the cure.  The acting was pretty decent, well above what your standard daytime soap opera would exhibit, and the ending had a nice little twist to it. All in all it's a worthwhile film to watch if you've got some time to kill and are in the mood for some gory fluff to to fill it with.",1137888000,4,1026,4.363157894736842

2106803,3,B0002MPK0Q,"Undead is a zombie film set within an Australian fishing town.  meteorites strike the earth and infect the townspeople with a virus that turns them into flesh eating zombies.  As it the usual case with these films a small band of survivors finds themselves thrown together battling the zombies.  They hole up in the home of a fisherman named Marion who seems overly prepared for the zombie hordes.  also there is the beautiful Rene, the somewhat reluctant winner of the Miss CAtch of the Day pageant in the little town.

The main problem with undead is that it doesn't seem to know what it wants to be.  it at first starts out as a humorous vehicle not unlike Shaun of the Dead (although nowhere near as funny).  Marion wows the rest of the group with his Matrix like moves as he flips around blowing zombies away.  Amusing and entertaining.  But then about a third of the way through the humor is completely abandoned as the film turns more desperate.

An acid rain that seems to burn clothing but not skin is a constant source of trouble and just when the little groups seems poised to escape the town they find their way blocked by a wall that seems to go on forver.  At this point the film turns into an alien abduction film as Marion relates how he was abducted but fought the aliens off.  People are hit with a ray of light that literally sucks them up into the heavens.  What role do the mysterious cloked aliens play in all this?

Undead has some good things going for it.  The acting by a cast of unknowns is fairly decent and the effects are actually quite good.  There's tons of gore for gore hounds with all manner of beheadings, bodies cut in two, entrails falling out, etc...but the film just tries to do too much and ends up being only OK where it could have been so much better.",1136246400,3,1794,4.407294832826747

Undead is a movie that you don't expect to be good at all, but it fools you.  It has comedy, gore and there's a few seens where you get scared (again this is no George Romero movie but it works).

I was so excited about seeing the trailer to this movie, but even the trailer showed signs of low budgetism.  But, thought, I'll give it a try.  I rented it for 3.99 using Comcast OnDemand.  Boy, I'm glad that's all I wasted!!  This movie was horrible!!!  I only saw literally under 10 minutes of this awful excuse for a horror movie.  I not only stopped the movie, but erased it from my cable box.  Now, I'm reading all these reviews about aliens and how they made the meteor shower happen as an experiment and also how the main character does acrobatics while killing zombies.  I'm so glad I missed all that junk.  My first clue was the terrible acting.  I mean horrible acting in the beginning.  The music was terrible and downright silly.  And some of the camera shots where out of frame I thought that it was the Pan & Scan trying to pick the right shot to see because the movie was probably shot in widescreen.  But, if that was the case even that wasn't done right.

My strong recommendation is NOT to buy this movie.  Don't even rent the movie.  My next recommendation is to watch these directors and be careful what they put out.

2106806,5,B0002MPK0Q,"As I've said in other reviews, zombie films are my least favorite type of horror films.  Zombies are ugly, boring, and - despite all the talk - rarely do we ever get to see one of them actually eating a brain.  This disinclination toward zombies on my part, though, actually helps me appreciate the truly great zombie movies all the more, and Undead, from those twisted Spierig brothers Down Under, is a great zombie film.  Not only is it deliciously gory, it also manages to form a coherent plot around not only zombies but aliens, abductions, and acidic rain; that makes this much more than your standard ""last one standing"" zombie survivor story.  I wouldn't put this Aussie product up there alongside Night of the Living Dead or Dawn of the Dead, but it's pretty darn close, mate.

Everything's peaceful in the little town of Berkeley (that's Berkeley, Australia, of course; nothing's ever peaceful in Berkeley, California) - until, that is, strange meteorites begin raining down all over the place and periodic showers of burning dark rain begin falling.  Clearly, these aren't your normal meteorological events - most people hit by meteorites don't get back up, and they surely don't start ripping people's heads off and eating their brains.  The zombies, constantly on the attack, spread their uglified condition even faster than panic can spread among the local populace, and pretty soon we're down to six survivors holed up in the old farmhouse of the town nutjob.  Everyone laughed at Marion (Mungo McKay) when he told of being attacked by zombiefied fish and abducted by aliens, but now he's the only one with half a clue about what is going on all around them.  If you don't mind, I'm going to refer to Marion as Torgo from here on out - Marion isn't a good name for someone with the best set of guns I've seen in quite a while, and the guy looks way too much like Torgo from Manos: Hands of Fate for comfort - it's pretty creepy, actually.  Anyway, Torgo finds himself holed up with Rene (Felicity Mason), otherwise known as Miss Catch of the Day 2002; an annoying pregnant woman who claims, even in the midst of a zombie holocaust, that she should have won the coveted Miss Catch of the Day title, and her man; and two police constables, a female who specializes in cowering uselessly and a male who tries to hide his cowardice by strutting around like he's in charge.  Despite the fact it takes them a good half hour to figure out that you have to go for the head if you want attacking zombies to go down and stay down, they manage to make a break for the border - only to find themselves fenced in with the most inexplicable of barricades.  Then, as if hordes of attacking zombies and frequent outbreaks of acidic rain aren't bad enough, aliens start popping up to add to the fun.  Maybe you're thinking this still sounds like your average zombie film, despite the alien presence.  Well, it's not, as the plot involves a really nice twist that changes your perspective on everything that's happened.  It's downright existential, and when's the last time you could say that about a zombie film?

The special effects are great, especially considering the movie's low budget.  The Spierig brothers know that zombie films are supposed to be gory.  They serve up tons of blood, more beheadings than I could count, heaps of bloody guts spilling out of abdominal cavities, some wickedly different head injuries that made me laugh with evil glee, severed limbs, and all sorts of stuff that will make a nervous Nelly feel quite sick to her stomach.  The meteorological events are fairly convincing, the alien activities on and above the earth are very nicely done, and you've simply got to love those zombiefied fish.

It suffers from one flaw that all horror movie have suffered from for the last thirty years; there are no scares.  No shockers.  Not even a guy in a rubber mask that jumps out and says, ""Boo"".  It's not hard to scare the hell out of someone.  Yet, most horror flicks inundate you with gore and deliver not on the scare. And here in America, when they do try to scare, there is so much eerie music and set up that the viewer anticipates the moment and gets nothing out of it.  Where's the fun in that?

One of the scariest scenes ever was in Silence of the Lambs, when Starling descends into the darkend basement after Buffalo Bill.  Totally creepy.

I know this was a comedy/ horror film but it still would have been nice to get the sh*t scared out of me once or twice.

If it isn't being terrorized by post-apocalyptic cycle-punks, it's being overrun by armies of flesh-eating zombies, former loyal Australian sujects infected by spores carried by the unexpected meteor shower that kicks off the first few minutes of ""Undead"", the uber-low-budget gorefest by the Spierig Brothers that proves that a kind word and a sawed-off shotgun get you farther than just a kind word.

It's a gorgeous looking piece of cinema, for one: all kinds of surreal, tricky shots, some sapped of color and bled dry to a wan ocher, others filmed through a blue-filter haze that only enhances the otherworldly feel of the film.

But more to the point, there are things in ""Undead"" that I've never seen before---for instance, have you ever seen a movie with:

Zombified Fish? Check!

Killer meteors turning the town spinster into a growling zombie hungry for blood? Check!

Acid Rain as a nice analgesic ointment to counter nasty Zombie skin irritation? Check and check!

Blood and gore upon the floor and you without your spoon? Given the spilled viscera, split skulls, ripped-off heads, and generous splatter, I'd say check!

Look: we could talk a lot about camera-angles, and funky plot-devices involving aliens---possibly malevolent, possibly not---and the bug-eyed but dead-sexy Felicity Mason, who goes from losing her family farm to donning a gas-mask and getting proficient with a scattergun---yeah, we could talk about all that.

But the fact is, ""Undead"" is an unapologetic little splatter flick filmed on enough money to buy three anorexics a big breakfast at Denny's on a slow Sunday night: it's sick, it's wicked fun, and it looks astounding.

The first five minutes are the best with a quick character introduction and also getting right into the meteor shower that turns the living humans into flesh eating zombies.  After the zombies show up is when things start getting sillier and sillier.  Example: the main guy is being attacked, in his home, by zombies from the front and the back so he lowers his head then raises his pistols and shoots in two directions at once like he was Christian Bale in EQUILIBRIUM and if that's not bad enough he then jumps in the air, flips upside down, jams his spurs (!?) into the wall above the doorway and literally swings back and forth shooting zombies.

The movie begins with strange meteorite showers that strike the peaceful Australian fishing village of Berkeley. They bring with them strange microbes that infect the dead and transform them into a living dead mob of rampaging zombies who hunger for human flesh.

Hell, I've sat down and actually enjoyed some real hunks of crapola like ""Zombi 3, 4 & 5"", ""House of the Dead"", ""City of the Living Dead"" and even Troma's ""Garden of the Dead"".  I honestly didn't think there would ever be a zombie movie they'd throw at me that I plain old just wouldn't enjoy.  Wow was I wrong.  Years ago I read of UNDEAD on the internet, hailed as the ""best zombie film since Night of the Living Dead"".

Whoever said that deserves to be eaten alive, I'm sorry.

I waited years for this movie to come to the U.S., and finally got a hold of it.  I popped it into the DVD player, sat down, and was excited as ever to watch what had been reviewed as a truly great zombie film.  I barely got through it.  I was so incedibly dissapointed, it was the first thing in my life that I ever actually regretted spending fifteen lousy dollars on.  Let me try to explain without having a heart attack.  WARNING! SPOILERS! (if you care, which you shouldn't)

The film opens nicely, with some really cool special effects featuring a meteor shower bombarding a happy town called Berkely.  It was accompanied by a goofy, but well done soundtrack.  In fact, the movie does have decent sound, and sound effects.  We are also introduced to a girl named Renee, who has just been handed a butt-load of responsibilities.  When she tries to escape town, her escort is eaten by a girl who had been hit by a meteor.  Next, the town loony comes to the rescue with a triple barrel shotgun.  Pretty good sofar, ignoring the really lame wisecracks and other failed humor.  This is where the good stuff not only stops, but slams in reverse.

Renee rushes after the loony in the rain, then spends about five minutes rinsing herself off with a jug of water that she finds.  Next, she bangs on the door several times before finding a key and entering the house (the loony not even realizing she's entered, but suddenly develops wolf-like hearing when she is standing right behind him).  Several more characters show up, including a ridiculous cop and his constable.  The cop was obviously an attempt at comic relief, but saying the F word repeatedly, over and over, throughout the entire movie, just really isn't that funny.  So anyway, a bunch of zombies break in, and the characters spend another five whole minutes shooting, and reshooting, and reshooting the same zombies before taking their time heading down the basement to a bomb shelter.  The loony claims it is the only safe place, but only minutes later contradicts himself by saying they can't survive there because they have no food or water.  So the characters waste time in the shelter trying to figure out what ""those things"" are, which is extremely difficult to watch, considering we have heard the same argument literally dozens of times in countless other zombie movies.

Eventually they go back upstairs, and there is another long battle scene in which they keep shooting the same zombies over and over, and there is a waste of not only special effects, but stunts as well.  The loony suspends himself from the ceiling with the spurs in his cowboy boots to fire at the zombies upside down, when it would have been much simpler and much more effective to just stand erect and shoot them.  Just wasted effort to try to impress modern audiences, if you ask me.  So they take their time getting to the car, more pointless shooting along the way, and eventually end up on the road, where they wash the rain off of themselves for another good while (which seems completely pointless, as if the pathogen was carried down in the rainand seeped into your pores, simply getting naked and dumping more water on yourself would do absolutely nothing to help).  There is also some boring subplot in which the loony had encountered the alien zombie plague before, but survived somehow.

Next they end up in front of a giant wall surrounding the town, wasting more time trying to figure out what it is, and whether or not hey should try to climb it.  So the cop decides to go for it, but meanwhile the constable spontaneously transforms into a zombie and... ughhh, you know what, I'll just skip to the end, the rest was so dumb I couldn't even pay attention and I'll probably get something wrong.

Anyhow, in the end, it turns out that the meteor shower was an accident, and the aliens quarentined the town with a giant wall to keep the zombie infection from spreading.  The aliens also ""cure"" all the zombies, which means all the ones that the people shot are now dead, and therefore fighting them was a complete waste of effort.  Now I will admit, I did kind of like the ending.  One of the characters who had escaped the town via a plane, is still infected with the zombie plague.  Just after the aliens leave, he turns into a zombie, killing and eating people, spreading the plague across the country.  The final scene is Renee in a house, holding up with several other people, and all of the towns zombies penned up in a giant cage, waiting for the aliens to return with their magical cure.

Now, if the whole movie had been as fast paced and exciting as the very beginning, and the very end, the movie would have been good.  But this in absolutely NO way even comes close to comparing to Night of the Living Dead.  I gave this movie a few tries, but I just do not enjoy watching it at all.  I very much enjoyed the movie ""Dead-Alive"", which had the same goofy humor and foreign accents, but that movie was MUCH more exciting, entertaining and intriguing than UNDEAD.  Wow, what a major disappointment, especially to someone who's usually never disappointed by a zombie movie.  That's really saying a lot.",1129766400,4,5892,4.553656220322887

Secondly, Felicity Mason is exceptional as the beauty queen/disenchanted townie/heroine.

What is it missing? Six String Samurai.

The entire time I'm watching this movie, I'm thinking how terribly uncool the character of Marion is.  Throw in a hint of Lance Mungia's Buddy and I think there would be a much more raucous good time to be had by all.

It's not 'typical' zombie genre. Yes, the sort-of-dead walk. But that's only a piece of it. Figuring what's going on and how to stop it is the real theme. Traditional zombie movies focus on survival, getting somewhere, but there's never a real solution to the problem at hand.

Undead has a great ending, which is a wonderful spoof on typical zombie movies. Sure, if you went into this movie expecting a Romero-like zombie-flick, you'll be disappointed. But, watch it for it is, an Ausi stab at the zombie/horror genre, it's beautiful. It's such cheesy/hokey humor on some parts that it's beautifully utilized.

The reviews that claim confusion and such do this movie such a disservice. Rent it or buy it here. Find someone who owns it. My brother who's a Romero addict, stated it blended parts of Evil Dead, and loved the flick. And he, like other Romero followers, is  down on films that aspire to copy the series, but follow woefully short.

Watch it without expectation, and you will like it. The action movies, as well. There's no stagnation. And there's enough questions that get wrapped at the end, yet allow for space for a continuation. Bravo!",1129507200,3,1354,4.720338983050848

The special effects are pretty good, though deliberately cheesy at times with lots of excess blood.  It is no Shaun of the Dead, but it was a nice mix of zombies/sci-fi/humor.  They had a great unexpected twist to it as well.  Some of the characters were overly stupid and annoying, namely the mustached cop, and the music was mediocre, but overall it was quite entertaining.  It reminds me of the Evil Dead series more than anything else with its blend of horror,humor, and deliberate corniness but it has its own unique feel.  It was refreshing to see an unpredictable horror film for once too.  It had several scenes that made me laugh out load too(like the flying fish).  If you don't like dry humor you probably won't find it funny though.  It is a nice homage to zombie films that doesn't take itself too seriously, and has some creative twists.

Why not 4 or 5 stars? Not enough zombie gore first off, but bear in mind, this is R rated, so what's here is nice, especially the shovel head scene. Next, we have a few too many close up camera views of the actors, which doesn't leave much room for expressions made through body language, such camera shots are plaguing modern films these days.

That aside, Undead is a strong offering in the zombie genre with some high-end visuals made with a small budget. Well done guys, just add more gore and I'd give it a four. :)",1129248000,,780,4.4475524475524475

2106829,4,B0002MPK0Q,"This Australian zombie import seems to be garnering a lot of love it or hate it responses on the internet.

While it is obviously a throwback to the old Evil Dead movies and Peter Jackson's early splatter horror-comedies like ""Bad Taste"" and ""Dead Alive"", Undead manages to feel like it's own movie thanks to some surprising twists in the movie that a lot of people will probably throw their hands up in disgust at.

But I found the ""twist"" to be very refreshing.

As a zombie film, this movie does tread some famaliar ground. Only head shots will kill them, they are just wanting to munch on some human flesh/organs and getting killed by one will eventually cause the victim to turn into one as well.

The cause of the zombie outbreak, however, is due to a meteor shower of some sort.

The characters in the film are your usual assortment of people from various backgrounds & professions, but the main character of Marion who steals the movie is a sort of backwoods Australian fisherman who just happens to handle guns like he's in a John Woo movie.  (He also can do some amazing stunts and moves that leave the other character's jaws on the floor).

The gore is pretty extreme at times, though it's limited to a few isolated scenes. I would have thought that the MPAA would have butchered this film, but it appears that the film made it through uncut.  You get a hand punching through a skull (with the brain in their hand), a zombie literally getting blown in half (twice), graphic head shots and numerous decapitations.

The film was made for about only 1 million Australian dollars but the filmmakers who are brothers make this look much better than a lot of major studio films with 100 million dollar budgets.

Most of the gore effects and basic F/X sequences were done on a laptop by the filmmakers and with the exception of a couple of scenes (the zombie getting yanked into the plane's propellers for instance), most of the stuff is pretty convincing.

I've heard comparisons of this film that's it's Evil Dead 2 meets Night of the Living Dead meets War of the War meets Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind. And as off the wall as that sounds, it's a pretty apt description.

The movie's main weakness IMO is that they tried to cram a bit too much into one film and the plot gets a bit scattershot at times as a result.

But overall, I was very impressed and this film entertained me a great deal.

Kudos to Lions Gate also for delivering a features packed DVD for the film as well.",1129075200,11,2488,4.5

Decent special effects, not enough death and gore, stupid plot, HORRIBLE music, weak characters, utterly atrocious dialogue and idiotic imagery.

An extremely poor representation of what Australia is capable of producing. Take my advice and watch ""Shaun of the Dead"" or ""Braindead"" if you want a GOOD zombie comedy.",1129075200,3,561,5.222222222222222

The ""acting"" is very solid, as for the ""plot"" which in many ways is confuing and left me baffled still does have a point to it. The ""gore"" is there, the ""make up effects"" are top notch and don't get much  better and the CGI ( Limited ) is very good probably the best I seen or can remember. Now as for the ""humor"" which there is some and definitloy not overdone( thank GOD ) is also a nice little addition at times dry but overall a plus.

This movie starts out a bit zany only to become more serious as the movie goes on which was a plus as well as the way they through the whole Sci-Fi twist in there it all happens in  an hour and thirty minutes and fast but the way the directors did it worked out very well.

I was very shocked to see at what a good and original idea this was and how well it was put together. YOu could definitly see these guys did the right thing a bit pricey for $23 but still IMO worth it, I enjoyed what this movie brought to fans ,with them showing the Aliens and how they were involved.

This movie i think will recieve many mixed reviews good bad and inbetween I rate it as 3 1/2 stars but gave it the advantage.

This is the first time in a while that I actually said what a good movie it was when it ended, its well done with some great twists be open minded to watch this and you will  enjoy it, I did.

Some parts are a little confusing mainly at the end but =maybe some can put it together better than I can I will watch it again in like a week and maybe get a better idea.
