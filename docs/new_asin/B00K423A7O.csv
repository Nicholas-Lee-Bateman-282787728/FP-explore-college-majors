8655804,4,B00K423A7O,"This is a standing cardio-based workout that focuses on the core. Debbie leads with two background exercisers. They do various standing moves, most of which impact the core in one way or another,moves like twists to the side, side kicks, etc. Debbie's cueing is not her best effort and I often started a move 1-2 reps after going ""huh?"". As with most BeachBody workouts, there is a timer and counter are on the screen at all times. Each time you start a different section, there is a counter that counts down that section. Plus there is a timer that shows how much time is left in your workout.

 I do like this workout and did it fairly regularly (I love standing core work), but now have gotten rid of it because it can negatively impact my wonky lower back. However, if you're looking for an intermediate standing core workout, this workout could work for you. Even though the cueing isn't very good, these are simple enough that you can pick up the moves fairly easily and, after doing it several times, you'll know what's coming up.

 Toward the end of this workout, she does a woodchop move. In the original version, she did it on one side but then didn't do it on the other side. The move is right at the beginning of a chapter point, so as soon as she's done on that side, use the skip back button to go back to the beginning of that move and just do it on the other side so that you're even. They did edit the workout to include both sides at some point, so I assume that currently sold copies will have both sides.",1424390400,2,1524,4.336842105263158

8655806,5,B00K423A7O,"Love this DVD.  It's the only workout that I've been able to maintain long term.  As soon as I feel like I'm going to die, it switches pace.  I'm SEEING the results!  I wouldn't do the regular Slim in 6 because it was too long of a tape and I'd dread it.  I can get this done in 25 min.  (I am using two 10lb. weights.)

I didn't agree with a reviewer on the other page (same DVD, so not sure why they are separated).  She said it's not intense.  I've been doing this one alone for a long time.  I'm about 10 pound from goal (less for being in my ""average range"" goal that they set for someone my height).  When I do this 5 days a week, I'm in that range.  You can't blame that on the DVD.  With 20 pounds of weights, this is a sweat breaker for sure!  Although I did agree that the woodchopper move is only on one side.  I just fit the other side in while she was doing the swivel move.  Easy fix!  I know you're supposed to mix things up but when life gets busy, I just wanted to make sure I was still moving!  This was not a long workout that I felt I had no time to squeeze in.  And sticking with it helped my stubborn pounds to go away without me stressing over them.  Just by staying consistent!  (And prayer!) Best advice...find what works for you and stick with it!  For me...this is it!",1411948800,8,1295,3.9765625
