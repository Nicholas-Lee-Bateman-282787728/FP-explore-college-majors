8668199,3,B00I08NLBE,"The film was great - really cute & funny.  But the DVD was a disappointment.  Apparently, French DVD's are a bird of a different feather and won't run on USA DVD players.  We could run it on our computer, and after much finagling, we ran wires from our computer to our TV to see it on a large screen.  Wish I knew that before I spent $50 buying the DVD!",1421107200,,353,4.0
