8687071,2,B00P9O63WQ,I have a bunch of exercise DVDs and this is one of my lease favorites. The instructor simply talks too much before each routine.,1434153600,,128,4.375
8687072,5,B00P9O63WQ,When you start battling with your stomach you start to think that it is a lost cause and give up on it. Luckily I got hold of these DVDs and tried them out one rainy day. The beginners was pretty easy but the intermediate and advanced certainly gave my stomach a good work out! Hopefully if I keep it going the pain should turn to gain!!,1420502400,,337,4.121212121212121
8687073,5,B00P9O63WQ,"I really like the warm-ups in these videos; they aren't just a few quick moves and then on to the video. There is a lot of time spent on warming up so that your body can actually prepare for the coming workout, and they explain why some of the warm-up movements are important for your body. The makers of this video had a lot of actual fitness knowledge. It wasn't just some celebrity moving around for 30 minutes. I also like how these videos are separated into beginner, intermediate, and advanced that way you can either work your way up or focus on one step at a time until youve mastered it. Great videos!!",1416009600,,611,4.368421052631579
