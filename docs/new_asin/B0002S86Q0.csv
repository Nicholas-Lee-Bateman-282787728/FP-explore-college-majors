Because I'm fleuent in German and English, which is spoken in this Miniseries, whenever the respective side is portrayed.
The Russian voiceover however made it a little bit harder.
The application of CGI and other special effects look fantastic. Acting was excellent, and as I understood the actors where some of the best in Russia. If you like me, a model builder of ships and airplanes, this movie is a feast for the eyes.
There's also a lot of combat action scenes, that are as good as the ones from Band of Brothers.",1400284800,,618,4.678899082568807

It seems like only standart hollywoods 1.5 hours was passed :-) It's a good look to the war from four sides - Russia, UK, USA and Germany. It isn't good that only Russian spoken people can see this movie - there is only Russian addition on the anazone.com (there isn't even english subtitles). But if you speak Russian and like history I suppose you'll like this movie.",1103328000,3,417,4.5
