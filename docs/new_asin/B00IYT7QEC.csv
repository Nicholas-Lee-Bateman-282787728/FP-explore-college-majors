6305511,5,B00IYT7QEC,"Gene Barry as Bat Masterson is great stuff! The BW transfers are very good with dark blacks and very little anomalies. The plots last a half hour which is perfect for these old shows. Many of these old BW one hour shows from this era suffer from being on screen too long with plots meandering aimlessly to fill a time slot. Not Bat Masterson, the show kicks off immediately and starts running fast. There is no down time to the plot. Character development, 1/2 hour tops! You get some fun old entertainment in a quick half hour.

James garner and Gene Barry were some of the smoothest western characters around. Gene Barry makes Masterson look like the coolest western persona ever. Gene always had the prettiest leading ladies to add to the mix also. The character actors are also some of the best that have ever been on screen. This set is not going to break you, and I think you will enjoy watching them over and over.",1437436800,,921,4.482142857142857
