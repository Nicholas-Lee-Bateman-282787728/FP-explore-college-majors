8397822,3,B003J3NGPQ,"Korean Robin Hood kind of story, with interesting twists and shifts in power. I'd give 5 stars, BUT the subs on the last DVD are pure crap. They obviously changed translator/editor in the middle of the series, so you have to get used to differend spelling and translation of lot of names from disc 4, but on disc 8 you won't understand a word, unless you speak fluent Korean, of course. Even Google Translate could to better! Also the quality of the video is not as it should be - with fast moving shots the picture gets pixelated, unfortunately.

Just to show you, how lousy the subs are - Kyrkyzstan Child = Hong Gil Dong (also written HONG Ji-Tong in the last disc) - took me some time to get it. Wang is of course King, but wait for it - there is a person called Costa Rica (= Gomi). And so on. The sentences just don't make sense at all. All of them.",1413590400,,855,4.213414634146342
8397823,5,B003J3NGPQ,"I'm not a fan of the Hong Sisters who wrote this drama however I do love Kang Ji Hwan who stars in this drama so I gave it a try.  I watched it on-line and after you get over the ""weirdness"" of the beginning it get better and better.  Really a great story, great acting ... excellent drama.",1350604800,3,290,3.9827586206896552
8397824,5,B003J3NGPQ,"Hong Gil Dong is my all-time favorite Korean TV series.  The main character is based on a Robin-Hood-like character in a popular underground novel written during the traditional Chosun dynasty.  Because he is the bastard son of an aristocrat, he has no place in society for his martial arts talents and natural smarts to flourish, so he becomes a ne'er-do-well and scoundrel -- until he is called to the hero's journey -- at first as a reluctant participant, and then, increasingly, as a popular outlaw leader of society's outcasts, downtrodden, abused, and impoverished. This TV version of the story includes an upbeat rock-and-roll soundtrack, and a feisty female lead character named Heo I-nok, who supplies additional elements of comedy and romance to the story. Each episode has it's own subplot, alongside the overarching plot running through the whole series, which involves an insane king, a prince trying to claim the throne, complicated conspiracies, and lots of adventure.  It's loads of fun. In the end, the series gives us a surprisingly moving story of a utopian community of outlaws seeking love and justice.",1299801600,7,1123,5.15934065934066
