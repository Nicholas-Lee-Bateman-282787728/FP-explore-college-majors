8280070,5,B001AXTV0G,"This survival kit has truly assisted me in talking with my children about the peer pressures and issues that face them everyday. As a parent I've had trouble talking to my kids and coming up with the best way to approach them. This dvd has guided me in doing this.

It provides practical advice from child experts, educators, and other parents who have ""been there"".",1214870400,2,366,4.630769230769231
8280071,5,B001AXTV0G,"I've long been a fan of Connect with Kids, having become aware of their initiatives through institutional access. This program, developed specifically for retail consumption, is simply a superb attempt in the company's ongoing efforts to assist parents and their kids in the development of communication oin subject matters that are sometimes difficult to approach with one another.

Internet Dangers, alchohol abuse, bullying and so on are areas/subjects  which kids tend to not want to talk to mommy and daddy about, yet somehow, as good parents, it becomes imperative that mommy, daddy and child develop pipelines of communications so that genuine understanding can be had by all. Moms and dads needs to know what kids face, and how they perceive what they face. Kids need 'steering' through the myriad of mazes that growing up is.

Connect With Kids' Survival Guides (both Middle School as well as High School) provide a forum where kids are talking directly to kids in the hopes that conversations open up between kids and their parents. This is not 'tough love' in approach. This is Julie telling Jane what happened to her. This is Mark telling Justin how it happened to her. This is one kid telling the other in the hopes that the other turns to mom or to dad and asks.....

It is the respsonsibility of parents to understand what kids face. CWK offers a forum to watch WITH kids and launch into process. Each program is a door opener... a self - developed guidance counselor. And, it's not only for kids facing trouble that is known. It's for kids who on the surface appear to be having no trouble at all, for they very well might be the ones keeping it to themselves... hoping someone will knock on the door and start them talking.

When it comes to kids, talk is not cheap. Talk is everything! The CWK titles are simply fantastic tools for all who view, telling stories that enlighten and help.

Highly Recommended!!!",1214870400,3,1927,4.789156626506024
