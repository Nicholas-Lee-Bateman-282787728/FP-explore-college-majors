1899010,5,B00009YXGW,"Susan Lucci plays a great role as Steaming Springs Country Club's Director. Also in the dvd version in one of the scenes you can definitely see a size chart for offical club wear up to XXL did not see any members with that size mentioned. I highly recommend buying the dvd. The only thing that was missing is the tv trailers and behind the scenes, Surround Sound, Commentary from the cast and crew, and a Closed Captioned Subtitle. The only goof was in the viewscreens of the suite Benign it is supposed to say Being. I wish they made a sequel to the film.",1116979200,6,556,4.355769230769231
1899011,4,B00009YXGW,"Not the best of Wes Cravens horrors but not the worst.
Simple but enjoyable horror yarn that is crude in budget but still interesting and compelling to watch.
Although one of the secondary characters, the film is most noticable for character actor/muscleman Nicholas Worth who plays the musclebound demonic sherrif guardian to the hell gate.",1060646400,5,341,5.218181818181818
1899022,1,B00009YXGW,"OMG, this was awful.  I am a huge fan of low-budget 70's and 80's horror movies (I was born in 65), made for TV movies, etc., so I LOVE the genre, the era, but this was pure crap.  I had just re-watched Summer of Fear (another Wes Craven) and while cheesy, I still loved it just as much as I did when it came out, so I expected to feel the same about this one and man, was I disappointed!!  The premise was ridiculous, the acting terrible, Susan Lucci looked like an overly made-up clown and was not very believable, the dialog was stupid, I could go on and on.  We made ourselves watch it to the end to see if there were any redeeming qualities, but alas, there were none.  I give this movie two thumbs down (4 thumbs, including my boyfriend), and I rarely say that about ANY films of this type from this era!! Don't waste your money.",1312848000,,835,4.161490683229814
1899023,4,B00009YXGW,"I enjoyed this movie for several reasons; It made me laugh, it made me nervous, and it blew my mind. There is something about the various characters in this film that are true to people, but obviously much more embelished. So I guess the acting really wasn't that bad.

It has something to say regarding people and the need to feel accepted or belong. That is a about the only thing that makes the story unique and timeless. Other than that a person would be horrified at the cheesy effects and sound on this film, though I liked it for that very reason. The way this movie is done makes you embarassed about the past and at the same time long for those days to be back. I can't imagine this would have required much of a budget. It indludes several familiar faces including Punky Brewster and the kid from the Neverending Story.

I would definately recommend seeing this movie once. At the beginning of this movie you might not know what to expect exactly so I won't spoil it anymore than I have. It might hurt a little at first... and all the way through for that matter. But if your head isn't made of concrete than you should get at least a little something out of this film.",1263340800,8,1179,4.3545454545454545
1899024,4,B00009YXGW,"Saw this movie years ago, and never heard any more  about it. Upon looking for old scary movies for halloween, This movie came to mind. Noone had heard of it. I went to Amazon and not even knowing the name of movie, I found it and purchased with no problem. I was so excited to see it again, and it was in great condition.",1255737600,2,322,4.03125
1899025,4,B00009YXGW,"It has been at least 17 or 18 years since I first--and last--saw this movie on TV. Even then, it was truly an inspiring throwback. What I enjoyed most was how potently 80's it was in every respect. The musical score particularly harks back to an earlier period of rich electronic music; using analogue synthesizers, and 'Tangerine Dream-like' soundscapes. It's always a wonderful experience returning to the spirit of that time. No other films can do it better than those low-budget relics such as this, which have been all but forgotten.",1254441600,2,538,4.923076923076923
1899026,3,B00009YXGW,"Wes Craven is an interesting director. The very same genius behind horror classics like THE HILLS HAVE EYES, LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, and A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, is also responsible for some major additions to the annals of cheeeze. His made-4-tv movie INVITATION TO HELL is a prime example of the latter. That nasty old satan is up to his old tricks again, this time in the guise of the beautiful Jessica Jones (Susan Lucci!), healthclub owner. Enter a loving family (including Robert Urich, Bladerunner's Joanna Cassidy, and Punky Brewster herself- Soliel Moon Frye!!) of unsuspecting suburbanites who are drawn into a devilish plot to get them to join the ""Steaming Springs"" health club. Little do they know, Jessica is only trying to imprison their very souls! Can dad (Urich) figure things out and save the day before health clubs like this begin popping up all across our great land? Let us pray for his success! Watch for Kevin McCarthy (Invasion Of The Body Snatchers, The Howling, Piranha, Twilight Zone: The Movie) as dad's boss, and Michael Berryman (The Hills Have Eyes, The Devil's Rejects) as a valet! Everyone should see this movie once...",1249603200,3,1156,4.903061224489796
1899027,3,B00009YXGW,"This is an eerie tale from the 1980s. It does not quite make it as a horror. More like a eerie drama. It is pretty entertaining, especially with the soap opers star, Susan Lucci. Shey played the female, succubus, demon in the movie very well. With a little more action and violence, this could have been a much better movie, still it is good for those who like a soft chill. I Did Like it though.",1238976000,5,396,4.223684210526316
1899028,5,B00009YXGW,"Invitation to Hell is an unknown and clearly underrated movie, done with very little budget but yet so strong emotionally. IMO a master piece.

It basically evolves around family bounds and how it feels to see the ones you love becoming strangers to you.

About the score, another great composition from Sylvester Levay (author of AirWolf main theme TV series) very simple and very emotional, that contributes a lot in creating the atmosphere of the movie.

Hope you will enjoy this movie as much as I did.

1899029,4,B00009YXGW,"A true howler: ""Invitation to Hell""; is an 80's shocker from Wes Craven before he hit it big with "" A Nightmare on Elm Street"". A mish-mash of ""The Stepford Wives"" and ""Rosemary's Baby"", it features Robert Urich and Joanna Cassidy as a couple who move into the the house seen previously in ""Poltergeist"" with their two kids so he can work on a new space suit that will be used by NASA to visit the superheated surface of Venus. It can also shoot lasers and has a built in flame-thrower, as well as have the ability to detect non-human life forms. For those of you who have never seen a movie before this is called ""foreshadowing"". But the real star is Susan Lucci as the Devil herself. This Devil doesn't wear Prada: she wears big-shouldered jumpsuits she stole from the set of ""V"" and hair bigger than a Chrysler. As this opening shows, you don't go mow down La Lucci with your craptastic K-car wagon and live to tell the tale....

The scene where the newly-evil Miss Cassidy mauls Urich is laugh-out-loud funny (he mewls like a starlet on the casting couch as she grinds him as much as is acceptable for ""family night"" and visibly blanches at her intentions), and is capped by him playing the next morning scene exactly like Mia Farrow in the Polanski movie. One half expects Miss Cassidy to remark that she didn't want to miss ""baby night"" and Ruth Gordon to pop in with his blender drink.

That's all I am telling you; buy this right now!",1209686400,2,1442,4.458333333333333
1899030,3,B00009YXGW,"This was not a typical slasher, or supernatural movie of the 80's. Wes Craven does a nice job with the creativity on this one. The story revoloves around a country club in california. The new family joining the club, is eluded into thinking that the ""secret"" part of the club is only for a select few, who are admired most amoung all the other club members. Susan Lucchi from the ""All my children"" is in this one, as the evil main characters, who may just be satan him/herself...",1206316800,4,479,4.454545454545454
1899031,4,B00009YXGW,"I find Invitation To Hell to be a strange and wonderful little flick.  I remember the first time I watched it.  It really sucked me into that cold, detached, materialistic atmosphere very well. Not like that's a place you want to visit other than with escapism.

 And even though it was just Tv movie from 1984, the acting was very good (IMO)  Even TV flicks from 20 years ago, carry way better acting than anything you'd see of similar ilk these days.  I credit Wes Craven for his excellent directing skills and love of true, effective creepiness.  Also credit Joanna Cassidy for an excellent turn as the once decent, well mannered wife.  Her morph into a superficial, devious and evil sexpot was really believable and effective.  Robert Urich as well.  To me he was great as the unintimidated, ""simple needs"" family man...the rock of good surrounded and tempted by sex, money power and superficial acceptance.  These are all the selling points of ""The Club"", headed by Susan Lucci.

i know this all sounds a bit cheesey and in a lot of ways, it is.  But with good acting, an ominous ""feeling"" and atmosphere running through the picture, some good directing, taut little script, the movie comes off most entertaining.

  Even Susan Lucci, I think, did a fine job within her hard to believe role.  She came off perfectly seductive, tempting and devoid of goodness.  I suppose she's meant to represent the devil.  In this case, the Devil in early 80's hair and make up and a really hot red dress  (among other interesting outfits)

This flick plays as much a morality tale as it does a TV horror film.  Again, it does own that somewhat cheesy TV horror flick dressing.  But to me, underneath, lies a pretty cool, thought provoking, fun movie that sticks with you.

*I've always liked the first 70-80% of the film best.  All the morality stuff....the family's decent into madness and deeper evil (loved ones losing their souls, etc.)  The ending couldn't help but be a bit over-the-top and cheesy.  It was 1984 and this was a TV budgeted movie.

**I really liked the whole scene with the dog too...(Urich's character would not fall to Lucci's temptations, but his family does)  This ""dog scene"".....Urich's first dealings with his family after their initiation into The Club.  their entrance into ""the spring""  All that with the dog knowing how they've changed.  How we now hate Joanna Cassidy's character for not only taking the family dog the vet to be euthanized, but also for ""wanting to watch""...I liked the vet character and his good decision to not let her get away with that.  At that point of the movie, we really bond with Urich's goodness

The full frame transfer of this DVD is very good.  Colors are strong and images sharp.  the sound is clear, somewhat dynamic and dialogue is audible throughout

Nice relase of a memorable little Wes Craven nugget from '84

**One thing.  I sure wish these TV movies on DVD would start to include TV SPOTS.  i mean, who wouldn't want to see a TV Spot for the ""upcoming"" Friday Night At The Movies feature.  Anyway, that's one thing this DVD is lacking...Special features. No trailer, TV Spots or commentary.

I sure wish the older films (whether A grade or B grade) would get some more respect in the way of special features.  I mean, newer films are so loaded with fluff and BS.  It's the older films we'd like to see good special features inclusive.  Who needs to ""look back on"" (or see for that matter) Cyote Ugly. Just an example. Or say, any of the bloated but empty CGI flicks.  Do we really need special features for those?  i don't even need the film, let alone special features! Always containing some fluff piece featurette with a bunch of lame, supposed actors overusing the word ""amazing"" for a half an hour

the 70's was a true golden age of cinema, in so many ways.  And the late 70's into the early 80's was a wonderful, inventive, fun time for horror flicks.  We WANT special features for these!

So, ""Invitation To Hell"" has no special features but it's a worthwhile purchase for those seeking a cool little ""morality tale horror film"" they could've missed out on back then.",1121212800,10,4138,4.662049861495845

Along with some very creepy movies, like the ABC movie of the week...this rates right up there.....

7994627,4,B00009YXGW,"A scientist receives a promotion for his work on a thermal space suit that will be used for the exploration of Mars. Among its features are the identification of human and non-human beings, and laser capabilities; and relocates his family to work at a large computer corporation 'Micro-Digitech'. Upon arriving everyone seems to be talking about a health club that ""anybody who is anybody"" is a part of.* Turns out the health club is actually a cult operated by a demoness**, which inducts members {or their 'souls'} through a portal to Hell, while their bodies remain on earth. The symbol of the cult consists of three flames somewhat resembling a fiery 666 rising up from The Abyss.

Despite repeated admonitions, he refuses to join, considering it the height of pretension, but when he finally discovers its dark secret, he realizes that his family are no longer themselves, beginning with the attempted disposal of the beloved family dog, but with the help of his secretary and her husband who runs the local animal shelter, who despite being in perfect health, was demanded that the dog be put down. He knows what he must now do, and enter those forbidden doors into the nether regions, donned in his space suit to rescue his wife and children.***

Despite several attempts at seduction, temptation, and in the end, a final battle, he uses the space suit's various tools to rescue his family, trapped in a hellish doppelganger-like realm.

* Much of the footage shot in the 'club' is none other than 'Rocky's Racquet World', later renamed 'Rocky's Health Club'.
** The first major confrontational scene is a good indication, as she immolates an occupant who 'accidentally' attempted to run her over, yet she arights immediately as if by levitation.
