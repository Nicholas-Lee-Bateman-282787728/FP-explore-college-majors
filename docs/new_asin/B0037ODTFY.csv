8390645,5,B0037ODTFY,"This is a chilling documentary of the Clutter family murders. Written superbly by Truman Capote, this documentary has rare never before seen crime scene photos, almost impossible to get. Listen to the killer confessions. Watch this in the dark, but don't watch it alone!",1221436800,,270,5.159090909090909
