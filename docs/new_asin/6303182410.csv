7840343,4,6303182410,This is a great workout.  I have been doing it for years and I never get tired of it and it never fails to leave me thoroughly worked out and in a complete sweat.  Dialogue is sometimes a little cheesy but who cares?--it's kicks my butt every time.  Too bad this particular VHS tape had a little part rattling around in it when I got it and wouldn't play in my machine.  Lucky my old copy still works--for now.,1363478400,,410,4.151898734177215
7840344,1,6303182410,"I ordered this video tape because the same one I already have, which I ordered a couple of years ago, didn't work when I received it. This video tape does the same thing. The picture blacks out and comes back on all throughout the video.  I know it's not my VCR, because all my other video tapes work.  I love this workout, but it is hard to workout when the picture isn't on half the time.  Seems like the whole bunch of them are broken.",1361059200,,438,4.129411764705883
7840345,5,6303182410,Wasn't sure what to expect and was pleasantly surprised.  Fairly easy to follow footwork and good level of intensity.  You won't need much space to do this workout.,1338422400,,164,4.821428571428571
7840346,4,6303182410,"Lynne Brick leads you through this 30 minute step routine, she instructs one on one, but is friendly, enthusiastic and cues well.  The choreography is pretty easy to pick up, you will see basic steps, v-steps, knee lifts, step kicks, over the tops, straddles, etc. She teaches one combination at a time and at the end of the workout you will do all of them one last time.  She also gives options to increase the intensity should it become to easy, as well as options for keeping it at lower intensity.

This video is from the early 90's, so the music is dated, but it's not too bad.  The set is the same as most of the Buns of Steel series, which is plain but never bothered me.  Lynne seems to be enjoying herself throughout the workout, which makes it more fun for me.  I always get quite a workout from this routine, which is best for beginner/intermediate levels, advanced will most likely find this way too easy.",1122854400,3,917,4.428571428571429
7840347,5,6303182410,"I love this tape!! You WILL sweat! I purchased this video for [money] at a [local store] two (2) years ago, when I began my fitness program. This tape is a must for your fitness library because as you become more fit, this tape will continue to challege you.
The tape is about 35 minutes long and can actually be broken up into two workouts because, after the first 15 minutes, you stop and take a heart rate.  Lynne is an excellent, bubbly instructor. She enourages and compliments you throughout the workout. She reviews safety guidelines in the beginning and re-iterates them continually  throughout the tape. This may be annoying for a seasoned stepper, but I find this very helpful.
The warm-up is about 5 minutes. The workout begins slowly, with Lynne introducing the basic step and the v-step. Then you move on to kicks and bun squeezes. After you learn all the steps, you repeat the sequence a few times. After 15 minutes you take a heart rate. The second portion uses the step to do lungs and squats. Again, Lynne teaches the steps, then builds to a combination. After the second 15 minute section, you put combine the moves from both sections and link all the movements together. Lynne also demonstrates propulsion moves that you can do as you become more advanced. Even without the propulsion moves, this is still a great workout.
This workout really works your buns, thighs, and hips. I feel energized after using this tape. I have done step aerobics for 2 years and I am always sore the day after using this tape. I highly recommend this tape.",1017878400,12,1556,4.654545454545454
