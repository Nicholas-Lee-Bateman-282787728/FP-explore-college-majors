2896999,4,B000TFFNSU,"I really liked this DVD.  It is actual falling snow, not still shots, and it very much like looking out your own window.  Also, the music was lovely!  It is more of a ""mood"" experience, not so much entertainment, so keep that in mind.  It is beautiful, though.",1223424000,21,260,4.354166666666667
2897000,3,B000TFFNSU,"This is a pretty good video of snow falling, especially if you don't get to see the real thing very often.  The music is quite nice and I know I'll enjoy this next Christmas.  My only complaint is that it looks like a series of snow scenes with the falling snow added in - the trees never move at all, not even a tiny bit.  But for a party backdrop, it'll be just fine.",1202774400,7,369,3.9594594594594597
2897001,2,B000TFFNSU,"Some what disapointed... I live in the midwest and I have seen much prettier snowfalls...It seems kinda grey.  We do have sunshine and snow.
I would not recomend.  However I gave it to my parents in AZ and they enjoyed it... As it had been years since they saw snow.",1200528000,4,266,4.3
2897002,5,B000TFFNSU,"My husband said that I was a geek when he saw I purchased A Christmas Snowfall. I purchased it as a backdrop for my Christmas party. It was a huge hit! Some of the scenes are beautiful. Although I wouldn't sit and watch the whole thing, it is nice in small doses. I can't wait until next Christmas!",1199145600,31,298,4.155172413793103
2897003,5,B000TFFNSU,"This DVD was shot in HD, so the snow is crisp and well defined.  The DVD was played on a plasma TV. The views are of differing scenes of a wooded area.  There are forests, fences, logs, streams and ice covered brush.  The snow is as beautiful as you could imagine--with large and small flakes swirling in the wind.  The snow is accompanied by soothing Christmas music, played on guitar and piano.  The tunes are:
Deck the Halls, Joy to the World, The first Noel, O Come O Come Emanuel, Away in a Manger, God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen, Oh Christmas Tree, Angels We Have Heard on High, Silent Night, We Three Kings, Carol Of The Bells, It Came Upon A Midnight Clear, We Wish You a merry Christmas, Coventry Carol, O Holy Night, and Auld Lang Syne.
If you want snow, this is a very good purchase!",1197504000,106,791,4.3175675675675675
2897004,5,B000TFFNSU,Great to play when you're taking a nap or going to sleep at night.  Love it!,1483574400,,76,3.75

2897006,5,B000TFFNSU,I have a xmas village that is set up right under my TV. With this video it make the village look like it is in a valley with beautiful falling snow all around. Perfect for the holidays and it has xmas music.,1482624000,,207,3.9523809523809526

2897008,5,B000TFFNSU,"I got this DVD for a friend that was missing her white Christmas- and, since I got her the 'Fireplace For Your Home: Holiday Edition' DVD the year before, well, I had to top that, didn't I?  The scenes on this snow DVD are lovely, the snow is natural, and it looks like the view out a window.  There's one close-up of an evergreen branch with snow on it, but most of the video is landscape scenes.  My friend likes the holiday music for this, but I wish you could turn the music off, and just listen to the sounds of nature; I'm a little spoiled, since the fireplace DVD lets you listen without music.  Anyway, beautiful DVD.  I recommend it.",1481760000,3,642,4.2727272727272725
2897009,1,B000TFFNSU,"Not good. One person playing a guitar, sounded like one string at a time. Picture didn't change much. Returned it for a different one by Our daily bread, i think. Which is excellent. Has an orchestra and the picture is always changing.",1481328000,,235,4.619047619047619

2897011,1,B000TFFNSU,What a let down. Scenery is fairly close up non moving. Color is washed out almost gray. Show fall is added to the scenes and looks too consistent aross all views. Really a poor reproduction....buy something else.,1480723200,2,213,4.783783783783784
2897012,4,B000TFFNSU,If you have a hi-def set then buy this DVD.  It will be a great thing to play on your tv during a holiday party.  Its better than having a big blank tv filling a room. Playing this DVD will add to the atmosphere,1480464000,,211,3.772727272727273

2897017,5,B000TFFNSU,"Ok, call me cheesy, but I LOVE this!!! We live in Southern California. We don't see much snow, unless we drive 2+ hours away. We definitely never get white Christmas mornings. I had a holiday party and had this playing in the background. Love that the scenery changes every so often and the music is soft. Several guest commented on how much they enjoyed it.

Seriously, just buy it.",1457222400,3,383,4.550724637681159

2897024,5,B000TFFNSU,I love love love this DVD! I have had it for five years and its still one of my favorites! Its wonderful for relaxation around the holidays and helps my stress levels. The snow scenes and Christmas music are perfect. I have other winter snowfall DVDs but they aren't near as good as this one. My Christmas isn't complete without this.,1450828800,,334,4.491803278688525

2897026,4,B000TFFNSU,The nude scene was brief and rather gratuitous -- having nothing to do with the other 59 minutes of this disc.  The rest of the material was lovely and the music fits perfectly.,1448409600,2,177,4.363636363636363

2897038,5,B000TFFNSU,Great DVD!! love the scenes..,1421020800,,29,5.0
2897039,5,B000TFFNSU,it is what it is. just a video on a loop of different scenes of snow falling. made a really nice backdrop on the TV for the holidays though. i'm glad I got it! will use it for years to come.,1420156800,,190,3.658536585365854
2897040,4,B000TFFNSU,Very relaxing. Music is well done.,1418860800,,34,4.833333333333333
2897041,2,B000TFFNSU,Some of its great but some of it has a huge scene of some wood - I am half blind so I had to walk up to the TV to see what the hell that was and it was what it looked like.  A pile of crap you would probably not have in your yard.,1418256000,,230,3.1818181818181817

2897044,3,B000TFFNSU,Was disappointed that there was very little movement in the video,1417219200,,65,5.0
2897045,2,B000TFFNSU,"Computer generated snowfall is unrealistic and even annoying. There appears to be some real snow in some of the scenes. If they had left that alone the video might be better. The fake snow is very similar in every scene, just the direction is flipped. There is one scene where you can see digital snow bouncing around continuously on the brighter parts of the scene. The music is okay. I prefer the Green Hill DVDs. Check them out before you buy this one. Glad I watched the Amazon digital for $1.99 before spending $15.00.",1417132800,2,523,4.574468085106383
2897046,3,B000TFFNSU,I liked it,1416700800,,10,2.6666666666666665
2897047,5,B000TFFNSU,"I ran across this on Amazon Prime last year before Christmas and fell completely in love with it.  While there a few things that could make this presentation even more awesome, I still think it is the best snowfall recording I've ever seen.

My ""upgrades"" would include an option for turning the music off and having just the snowfall/wind/forest sound playing (there's a few minutes near the end that are like this, without the music).  I also would wish for a higher definition version, BUT I do not find the video quality now in any way displeasing.  The one other thing I'd wish for is some information in the menu about where this was filmed, because it is so beautiful (I am guessing as least some was filmed in California).  Other than these extremely minor extras, I would not change this recording.

The one star reviews on this are extremely weird and off base.  Like one reviewer mentioned, I too have lived in snowy northern climes much of my life and this absolutely looks like the snowfall I am familiar with.  I don't know what that reviewer was talking about.  Another thing I especially like about this dvd is there are no blue skies and large mountain panoramas in it.  When I want to see snow falling, I don't want it interspersed with calm blue days of snow covered mountains.  I want to actually see gray snowy skies with continuously falling snow.  This dvd has that in spades and it most definitely does NOT show the same scene over and over.

One other point: if you do not like the included music, just mute it and play your own nature sounds or holiday music in another program.  Right now I have this dvd playing in windows media player, muted, and I am streaming an Amazon Prime Christmas music playlist I made.

Rent this on Amazon Prime if you are ambivalent, then buy it after you fall in love, like I did.

Happy Winter!",1415145600,3,1852,4.516516516516517
2897048,2,B000TFFNSU,NOT ENOUGH SCENES TO IT.,1414713600,,24,4.0
2897049,4,B000TFFNSU,Happy with this . Music is relaxing traditional and non traditional but all enjoyable. Sometimes the snow is a little blizzard like but not so much to be too much a bother.,1413676800,,172,4.40625
2897050,5,B000TFFNSU,"Love to watch this on my second monitor in the studio during winter in AZ. Gets me in the mood for the holiday paintings and crafts I create. I grew up in upstate NY where lake effect snow was my favorite kind of snowstorm. I don't care for the sound on this so I turn that feature off.
Nice scenes from different locations.",1412812800,,324,4.158730158730159
2897051,5,B000TFFNSU,"I love it! It was nice to watch it snowing in nice woodland settings. And very realistic, as in some shots you could see the evergreen branches moving in the wind, and could even see the snow piling up on some places, like the stump with the bark. I came back and ordered another one for my sister and brother in law who live in Florida now. I'm sure they will enjoy watching it snow around Christmas time.............and they won't have to go outside and shovel!",1408838400,,463,4.395348837209302
2897052,5,B000TFFNSU,"This is a beautiful, relaxing video that creates a peaceful background whether it's the Christmas season or Christmas in July! Highly recommend!",1408838400,,144,5.590909090909091
2897053,5,B000TFFNSU,By far the best snow video! Its like looking out a window on a snowy day! I bought extra for gifts!,1407974400,,99,3.761904761904762
2897054,4,B000TFFNSU,"I rented this video and liked it enough to purchase it. There are a few scenes which show nothing but bark on a log or a tree branch that I think are rather ridiculous, but then there are some lovely scenes of forest, trees, streams and where the snow if falling hard, something I didn't get on another snow video I purchased that had dazzling scenery.  Another thing I like about this--the snow is falling and the skies are gray the whole time.  I wanted to see snow falling and that's exactly what I got.  I've watched it for hours now and recommend it!",1391817600,2,555,4.3173076923076925
2897055,5,B000TFFNSU,"I have looked for a CD of this type for sometime.  it is a totally relaxing sight for me to see snow falling, and since it doesn't always snow where I live I found this to be perfect.  The scenery is beautiful and the photography  is excellent.  I can start to watch this CD and be totally relaxed and quickly asleep in just a few minutes.  It's also nice for those who like to watch the snowfall but don't have to shovel it.  JM",1390521600,,429,4.0476190476190474
2897056,5,B000TFFNSU,"ordered this recently and I  am very pleased with this product--the look of this video can be derived from the front scene of the DVD cover itself but the real beauty of this product is the Christmas music that accompanies the snowfall scenes---mostly acoustic guitar and piano arrangements that are serene and wonderfully performed--soft, mood setting and perfect--if you're looking for a pleasing audio and visual set piece this is it-outstanding all around-Nothing spectacular here as far as the visuals go but this isn't meant to be a nature video--buy this for the ambience.",1390003200,2,579,5.159574468085107
2897057,5,B000TFFNSU,"This DVD of different snowfall scenes is not only lovely to look at, the optional music is also quite beautiful.  All the Christmas songs and carols are familiar and well done.  The scene changes with the music and it will play as long as you keep the DVD going.  It's a beautiful background for your room and is festive for Christmas and for all winter long!",1389139200,,359,4.409090909090909
2897058,4,B000TFFNSU,"Very nice music set to beautiful snowfall scenes.  Some snowfall appeared computer generated but, enjoyed the view and especially the music.  Played it while passing out Christmas gifts.  It was a pleasant background.",1388707200,,217,5.515151515151516
2897059,5,B000TFFNSU,"I ordered this as another option to our fireplace DVD, especially for Christmas time.  Living in Southern California and this Christmas, we were looking at 80 degree weather.  I know many of you would kill for that weather during the winter, but for us, I just wanted it to feel like Christmas.  This DVD did the trick.  The Christmas music is so peaceful and the snow scenes change.  You can also turn the music off, which I also love as I can use it throughout the winter.  We had this playing Christmas morning while opening gifts and pretended that was the view out the window.  Took me back to watching it snow as a child on Christmas morning.",1388448000,,648,4.440677966101695
2897060,4,B000TFFNSU,I purchased this video as a backdrop for a Christmas play. Set up on a large wall the snow could be seen as if looking through a window. The quality was excellent. It shows around a dozen different wooded shots. All of them without people or anything to distract from the falling snow . Christmas music plays in the background. The music is a little too somber as background music for a party. However for a play I muted it and it was not a problem. Christmas day I played it at our media center. This dvd was really a good buy.,1388016000,,528,4.186274509803922
2897061,1,B000TFFNSU,I live in the north and have seen snow of all kinds - but the snow In this video is bizarre.  The effect is that of 'pouring' snow at a rate and depth that made my eyes water and my head ache. I cannot imagine who would think watching this video is in any way relaxing.,1387584000,3,269,3.8035714285714284
2897062,5,B000TFFNSU,Very real snowfall and the Christmas music is perfect. I enjoy that the video shows several locations and the trees waving in the slight breeze.,1387497600,,144,4.8
2897063,5,B000TFFNSU,Tranquil and relaxing. Exactly what I was looking for. The music is soft and not overpowering. The scenery is quite nice. The cover is hard to read because of color choices.,1386892800,,173,4.612903225806452
2897064,2,B000TFFNSU,"The snowfall was beautiful but the music was lacking. I wanted something more like Christmas Carols NOT music with a guitar, piano and NO singing.",1386806400,2,146,4.88
2897065,5,B000TFFNSU,Good price and good shipping time. I bought this item 1 year ago and it really put me in the holiday mood. It is very relaxing and almost sleep-inducing. Be sure to place an extra blanket on the bed when viewing!,1386633600,,212,4.195121951219512
2897066,4,B000TFFNSU,"Scenes were pretty, but the first scene on the DVD seemed to stay up forever.  I was expecting the various scenes to be up no longer than a minute to get a larger variety of backgrounds.",1386633600,,186,4.166666666666667
2897067,5,B000TFFNSU,"I live in an area of the country where it almost never snows-or even gets cold enough to snow, for that matter! I really miss the four seasons I got used to growing up in a more northern climate. This DVD is really soothing with its gentle piano Christmas music and the softly falling snow with several different scenes. It runs just under an hour, and I have been known to let it play over and over while I sit and knit or bake with my kidsI highly recommend this! It's very relaxing and I just love watching the snow fall. If only I could see some outside my windows too!!",1386547200,,574,4.18018018018018
2897068,5,B000TFFNSU,"the best !  Whatched this while we were decorating our christmass tree and it was so relaxing and great, Nice snow scenes with Classical guitar playing christmass songs no words (pefect).

2897072,5,B000TFFNSU,"I bought several snow/Christmas DVDs, but this is the only one I ever watch.  It is simply perfect.  Anyone who says the snow is computer-generated or that the picture is grainy needs to get a new TV!  You can actually watch the snow accumulate flake-by-flake in some of the close-ups.  The music is lovely, guitar and/or piano, simple yet interesting arrangements ---neither overly lush nor new-agey.  I usually put it on 1/3 to 1/2 the usual volume.  You can also just mute it if you want the picture only, or if you want to play different music.  I love the the variety of scenes.  At first I wanted the scenes to change more often, but then I relaxed into it and now it seems perfectly paced.  It is like looking out the window on a snowy day, something I used to do as a child living up north.  My favorite segment is the one that goes with ""O Come O Come Emanuel,"" because the snow dramatically changes in the course of the segment, even changing direction and speed as the wind changes.  This is the perfect video for background mood if you are having a party, for present opening, and --- what I most use it for --- to unwind after a stressful day.  I even watch it on miserably hot days, just to cool myself off.  I have given this DVD as gifts several times, and the recipients have all said they love it too.  If I can't live in a place with real snow, this is definitely the next best thing.",1375833600,11,1403,4.285171102661597
2897073,2,B000TFFNSU,"I was hoping for HD scenes of large, gently falling snowflakes, but every scene on the DVD - particularly the loops - seems to be running at a faster than normal speed (replicated on multiple devices) with more granular snow. It also doesn't seem very HD. Some reviews have claimed that the snow is just a digital effect over a still picture. I couldn't say, but if it is real, the results are no better. The background scenery is OK, but uninspired. The idea here is great, but the execution could have been so much better with just a little effort. I wouldn't recommend buying this.",1372550400,,584,4.518867924528302
2897074,5,B000TFFNSU,"I live in the south and our snowfall is limited to only once every few years. This DVD is like looking out your window and watching it snow, which is exactly what I wanted. This is snow falling, not still landscapes after it has snowed. If it is not Christmas time, you can just mute the music. The music is beautiful though and I will be watching the DVD with the music this Christmas. Sometimes in the winter, you just want to look outside and see it snowing.

2897078,4,B000TFFNSU,I have enjoyed having this DVD on in the background.  I'd much rather see snow on the TV screen than in my driveway!  Very enjoyable and worth the cost.,1360886400,,152,4.206896551724138

That may be so but my downloaded version was certainly not in HD. Also, and most disappointing, It's not widescreen!! That, I found really strange. Overall though, I love watching snow fall and I did enjoy it despite my initial disappointments. The price, given it's shortcomings, was a bit ridiculous.

It's like looking out your window and watching it snow. The scenes do change but not abruptly. I wish it came with a nature soundtrack but that not a big deal I just put the tv on mute.

2897095,3,B000TFFNSU,"While I wouldn't call this video ""depressing,"" ""majestic"" and ""breathtaking"" don't describe it, either!

What you'll get is plenty of close shots of creeks, woods and a fence, all with snow falling.  If you're looking for more open, expansive shots, you won't get them here.  The stills on the main page give a good indication of what you can expect.

The video is fine for our needs BUT it is way overpriced.  This would be better priced at $7.99, with $10 being the highest.",1354147200,2,476,4.619047619047619

2897099,5,B000TFFNSU,"I bought this DVD on Amazon two Christmases ago and just *LOVE* it. I play it when I am hosting events at my home during the Christmas season and everyone loves it ... I also listen to it when I just want some silence and downtime from all things hectic. With the fire going in my fire place, and a cup of coffee in hand, I love escaping into the snow scenes. Especially in south Texas where we rarely get a White Christmas, and when we do it's a historical moment. The instrumental stringed instruments strumming out the traditional Christmas music are just beautiful and the snowy scenes are majestic. I most definitely recommend it and look forward to playing it each December!",1326067200,,680,4.536585365853658
2897100,5,B000TFFNSU,"One of my favorite things in the world is snow... but I don't get to see very much of it.  This year I bought a fireplace DVD and this snowfall DVD and I love them both! (see here for the fireplace dvd I recommend: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KNAI2Q/ref=cm_cr_mts_prod_img)

The images are crisp and beautiful.  The music is nice and not over bearing.  I appreciate all the different scenes.  I prefer the scenes with heavier snowfall, there were a few (and only a few) where the snow had slowed quite a bit and the flakes were tiny... but like I said there were those were only a few of the scenes for the most part the scenes are full of snow.

I have two minor cons: #1 is that when I bought the dvd it was a little pricy, but I still don't regret getting it. I will enjoy it for years to come. & #2 unless I've just not figured out how to do it... it does not loop back to the beginning for continuous play.  It's a small con and not really a big deal to just go pick up the remote and push play again... but it would have been nice to be able to play all the scenes and they continue until stopped.",1325548800,,1112,4.192488262910798
2897101,4,B000TFFNSU,"This is one of the better DVDs of its kind.  The camera never moves and the shots linger for some time.  I've purchased others like this that cut too often and don't really seem to get why it is that people buy these.  These folks get it and even include some excellent, folky, Christmas music to go with the images.  The loops are a good idea and a great way to experience this sort of disc.

There are a couple of ways this could be better, though.  First, it should be on blu ray.  There's no excuse for it not being so since it was supposedly shot in high def.  At this price, it should be.  Second, the fades to black at the end of each song are distracting.  I'd do away with those.  Third, it would be nice if the natural audio was an option all the way through.  I really liked hearing it on the looped scenes.

Overall, I recommend this.  If it were on blu, it would definitely rate five stars.

Oh, and to the person who stated this to be a ""dreary"" DVD, they must have been off their meds.  I found the video to be very uplifting since I don't get to experience natural scenes like this here in LA.",1324425600,2,1109,4.088372093023255
2897102,5,B000TFFNSU,"I have it running on TV over my mantle behind a Nativity scene for Christmas, and everyone who sees it loves it.  The review that says nothing moves is not accurate -- some of the scenes absolutely do move.  As with live snowfall, often there is no wind, but look closely, there is some movement and the scenes are wonderful.  I might also watch it in the heat of the summer, too -- just to feel cooled by the snow!  I love it, and have ordered a second one for a friend.",1321747200,2,471,4.086956521739131
2897103,5,B000TFFNSU,I love this snowfall dvd! It's truly beautiful and yes the trees and water move so it's totally natural. The music is peaceful and compliments the beauty of the many scenes.

2897104,4,B000TFFNSU,"I purchased this DVD last year (2010) and used parts of it for our church Christmas program.  We just turned off the music and used it as a back-drop for individual solos.  It helped create a very ""peaceful"" ambience for the church.  This DVD has a moderately good variety of scenes.  Since all the shots are of snow falling, there are no scenes with any sunshine.  I'm thinking putting together my own DVD like this, but I would include beautiful scenes of snowy landscapes with sunshine and then also night scenes with some Christmas lights included.  What I like best about this DVD is that the camera does not move.  There are no camera pans or zooms, so the scenes really are like a live ""painting"".  Overall a very nice DVD and I'll be looking for more like it.",1320883200,27,767,4.467625899280575

2897111,5,B000TFFNSU,"This was exactly what I was looking for! I read the reviews for every snowfall DVD on Amazon, and with apprehension, chose this one. I was mesmerized from the first 30 seconds. I'm not sure what one reviewer was talking about when they claimed the trees didn't move - they sway in the breeze with the blowing snow - I saw that in several shots. You can see every type of snow imaginable - big, fat flakes, swirling snow, tiny, icy flakes, fast snow, slow, lazy snow - you name it. The scenes are all gorgeous and the music is very relaxing. I felt each scene was held for just the right amount of time, and I appreciated the large selection of scenes. As a midwestern gal, I've seen much snow in my time. It's only Sept here in north Texas, but I can't stop myself from watching it every morning, and I plan to have it up on my big screen playing nearly constantly this Christmas season. My kids are guaranteed a Christmas morning snowfall as they open their gifts. My Mother will be getting one of these for her birthday, as she loves snow just as much as I.

8208857,1,B000TFFNSU,"I just missed the return window by 1 week, as I was saving this for December 16th and didn't preview it. This is the most depressing music I have ever heard on a ""Holiday / Christmas"" album. It would be beautiful, soft guitar, except it is off-pitch on purpose so often it makes me cringe. Most of the typical songs we love are played instead in a minor, or agonizingly slow pace, without the harmonies associated with that particular piece of music. I'm a musician and I don't know how this is supposed to be ""cheerful"". It is depressing. I just missed the return window, but maybe I can steer someone else away from it. People with a ""tin ear"" who don't know the difference will think it is fine. I guess the guitarist thought it was ""cool"" to completely rewrite traditional Christmas music.",1512604800,,793,4.513888888888889
