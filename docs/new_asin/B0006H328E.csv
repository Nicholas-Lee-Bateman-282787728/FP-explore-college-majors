2183634,5,B0006H328E,"Where this might not be the greatest TMNT film or program ever made, for any die hard TMNT fan like myself it's a must have. And I was so glad to find it for A.) a great price and B.) in excellent condition! It's a concert I remember watching over and over from my childhood and after losing it years ago I thought all hope was lost of ever finding it on Tape again, as well as ever seeing it. Watching it when it was delivered brought back so many memories and I was amazed I still knew the words to the songs haha!",1254441600,5,516,3.9711538461538463
2183635,5,B0006H328E,"This is the best ever concert, very great and classical, with great music from spirtral to rap all to inspire people from messing up in thier lives...  A great gift fro anyone...",1250726400,5,178,4.5625
2183636,5,B0006H328E,"Since Shredder's defeat at the beginning of this season, things have been relativly quiet for our heros.  Well, that is, if you consider running into a ninja from another dimension and dealing with giant mutant crocs and mad scientists a vacation.  But now, the turtles must face the Foot, the mob, and the Purple Dragon gang.  All battling for control in the Shredder's absence in one of the best three-parters this series has to offer.  All this, and a new player joins the game as well.  But where do her loyalties lie?

  This Dvd also includes Rogue in the House, another enjoyable two-part episode in which the turtles must face an old enimy.  Well, its the Shredder, ok?  Didn't want to give it away but he's too cool not to mension.  So you defenatly want this one.  So order this from Amazon!",1146960000,2,801,4.563380281690141
2183637,5,B0006H328E,"Now this video is cool! The episodes on it are greate! Also, the Triceraton who escaped into the seawers in part one of, Secret Origins is alie of our heroes, the teenage mutant ninja turtles! And,name is Zog! Plus, he appears to the turtles's ultimate alie! Even Shredder dosen't stand a chance againest him(well he does, but barely)! So, buy this video buy all means!",1127260800,,369,4.6923076923076925
2183638,5,B0006H328E,"I didn't know if this DVD was going to be a good buy, but I have no regrets.  It's even amusing just for the fact the Turtles end up fighting alongside a couple old enemies, though the episodes are quite enjoyable.  There were a few parts they could have been a little more subtle on, but they did clear up at least one hanging plotline from the Secret Origins episodes and all in all this was a genuiunly fun purchase.",1107648000,5,419,4.225
2183639,5,B0006H328E,"This disc collects the three-part ""City at War"" story arc, as well as the ""Rogue in the House"" 2-parter. Note that with this release, the first two seasons of TMNT are now available on DVD.

City at War, while fairly entertaining, is an example of the poor story pacing that plagued the series in its second season. The story was adapted from a 13-issue miniseries from the original comic, and while many subplots needed to be dropped or toned down for saturday morning standards, that's not the problem here. The problem is that plot points like the robot battle go on for far too long, cutting into time needed to develop Karai's arrival and her association with the Foot. You don't see enough of the gang violence to really get a sense that the entire city is at war. And Leo and Raph's arguments are annoying and circular - they argue because the writers make them argue, not because their arguing actually goes anywhere. And 4Kids TV standards are painfully clear, as no one gets remotely injured even when people are firing rocket launchers at each other from only 10 feet away.

However, Rogue in the House makes up for all the problems with City at War, and is my main reason for recommending this disc. Featuring the fan favourite Triceraton Zog, this 2-parter is a clever homage to the original series that old school fans will love. Low on plot and high on quick action and references, we get Foot Mechs (the equivalent of the old Foot Soldiers), a robot Splinter (used in ""Plan 6 From Outer Space"") and replicas of the President and Prime Minister (""Cowabunga Shredhead""). This is as close to the old series as the new one gets, and manages to be mindlessly fun while playing everything straight-faced (gotta love that 'Superfriends' battle charge).

With a great 2-parter and a flawed but entertaining 3-parter, this disc comes recommended. Now bring on season 3!",1106438400,12,1876,4.730886850152905

2183674,5,B0006H328E,"well, as some have stated, the movie isn't as good as the originals (or the  series) and i hated the origin story they gave the turtles. the one from the original cartoon in the early 90's was better and more plausible. with that said if you take the movie here as well as out of the shadows and watch them not expecting it to be like the original cartoon or movies, then this is decent. i didn't like the turtles, either they look like mutated steroid freaks. but i got used to it and now it's pretty cool.

as far as this gift set goes it is awesome. it comes with a 3 disc copy of the movie in 3D (BUT t's useless unless you have blue ray and a 3D tv( the second disc is the one with the special features and blue ray movie on it and the last disc is the movie on regular DVD + plus a digital copy and the action figure of raph looks awesome sitting on my computer desk. and if you do buy the edition with the raph figure don't expect some tiny little 3MM figure it is approx 7in tall and 6 or so inches wide and has the look of raph from the new turtles movie in a combat stance.",1500422400,,1083,3.918181818181818

2183681,5,B0006H328E,An outstanding movie I love both of them but you can't beat retro turtles like these companies are doing like the cartoons for example.  The digital copy worked perfectly just gotta make sure you have the right HDMI cable connected.  I would recommend this to anyone but if your getting DVD's amazon.com or else where make sure it's new not used in anyway to avoid the possibility of getting the digital code ripped off from you.  I now own both of the most recent release of the mutant turtles.  I would purchase from this company again in the future. thanks very much,1495065600,,569,4.549019607843137

2183686,1,B0006H328E,"I am a die-hard Ninja Turtles fan. I love their video-games, I love the 2003 cartoon with all my heart. I think that cartoon is actually the best out of everything the turtles had and I've actually been rewatching it now as an adult and it still provides a great story, acting and just stands up very-very well. But I am here to talk about this 2014 movie, right?
It's not bad. I mean, it's an okay movie that some of you, guys, can watch with friends and such, but it's nothing more. There is 0 to think about, there is 0 interesting characters or character development for anybody that is not laughable. Basically, if you want me to make it short, hear this: Turtles are kids of Batman and She-Hulk, April is a sexy chick, her co-worker is dumb, Shredder is a Transformer. Add some explosions, some generic orchestra, some ""sexy chick"" jokes and more or less bearable fight scenes. There you have it, that's your movie.
Now, the actors are okay - and that's it. They are not good or bad, they are just okay. Don't expect anything catchy or performance-worthy. It's just alright. I do have some complaints about turtles' voices. If you are like me and remember those great actors from 2003 cartoon - you are going to be pissed the hell of. Leo does not sound like a leader, Mikey sounds like he is from ghetto, Raph sounds pretty much like Leo, not grumpy at all, Donattelo is nothing different. Is this so hard to find memorable voices for turtles? They are the stars here, what the hell? Instead, they sound like your regular neighbours. Also that Sacks (sorry if I wrote it wrong) scientist-guy... oh boy, you could kinda see that he tried to make a good villain, a bearable villain, he tried, but some of the lines were just so damn stupid! What, his motives are to become ""Stupid rich""? The hell? Also another ""villain"" - Shredder. Despite the fact that he is a transformer, he also says some of the dumbest villain-stuff I've ever heard. ""Take innocent people as a bait"". What kind of a villain would admit that he takes innocent people? This is just bad writing, horrible writing. Shredder would never say that.

And I've touched the writing aspect, so I'll go into this in a moment. April is dumb. What, she really thought that someone would believe her story without anything to prove it with? More than that, someone would publish it on news? The hell? Her co-worker is even dumber. It's like he had stopped growing up at, say, 13-14 years old and stayed there. All he cares about is to dive into April's butt. I mean, sure, some people care about sex more than others, but like THIS? It's just stupid.
The story... there was none. April discovers Turtles, bad guys kill Splinter, Turtles fight with them. There's not even that much of a dialogue going on between them. Again, if you take a look at 2003's cartoon, you will see that it has actually had a lot of character development, multiple story-lines, its own unique characters, cool dialogue, nice jokes or even something to think about. What do you have here? Co-worker of April joking about her butt, while she takes photos. Great.
To the good stuff. Some of the fight scenes were pretty bearable, turtles' design is great and the CGI is pretty good on them. I really like the design of these Turtles. It has a very unique feel to it, it suits their characters and looks very-very nice. But that's about it. There was nothing more for me to like.

A disappointment. I don't know how else to name this movie. And I also sorry for those people that will have this as their first Turtle movie. It's just a generic shoot-all and blow-all type of deal. I hope there is a better future for my favorite Turtles.",1492214400,5,3673,4.521804511278195

2183747,3,B0006H328E,"The original TMNT (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) was better in my opinion.  The story line was better the acting was better.  By the way it was not that the actors in this film were bad it was the direction and production that left them with a flat performance.  The original TMNT used Muppet type costumes and gave the actors a greater range of expression, emotion and a more life like feel.  This movie failed because of the technology.  They depended too much on the technology and left out the importance of a good story well told. The need for the actors to really feel their parts.  I felt like the actors were not given direction or made to do several takes with different emotion and dynamics so that the best could be used and cut into the scenes so that there was a proper feel of energy at the proper time.  The industry has forgotten that the story is more important than the technology.  It is ruining the art of entertainment.",1486080000,,940,4.456140350877193

The main negative is the nonsensical story and alternative origin story that's just beyond stupid. So we are to believe that her dad was killed in a fire but then the main villain claims he shot him? Which is it. Get your story straight. Not only that but splinter and the turtles apparently could understand English and comprehend plans while they were still a rat and four box turtles in cages? It makes no sense. April is the one who puts them in the sewer and thats how she knows who they are when she hears their names? Okaaaaaayyyy.....

Stop making movies Michael Bay....",1485302400,,845,4.626666666666667

Yes, 4 stars. That is correct.

This is a solid 4-star movie simply for its nostalgia and hilarity factors. The songs are terrible, the acting horrendous, the product placement appalling...

2183976,2,B0006H328E,This movie looks like it was made to focus on 3D action rather than any actual story.  Will Arnett was the only actor I liked in this movie. I did like Megan Fox in transformers but her acting in this movie was terrible I find her annoying and hard to watch. William Fichtner (Eric sacks) is usually a great villain but in this movie he is also terrible.  I don't believe any of their backstories these characters have no depth.  Can it be blamed on a horrible script or poor direction? Maybe.  Examples of bad writing/direction begin in the first few minutes.  Your telling me a reporter would interupt a conversation in which she was about to break open a story to walk over to her camera guy after he yells at her they are going to be late.  It's no wonder she has never been able to get a good story.  The scene where she is supposed to have stayed up all night can only be described as awkward.  I was really disappointed in what could have been a great movie.  If you are looking for action there is an avalanche of great scenes.  For the record I am a huge tmnt fan and have accepted multiple different origins and story lines.  Also it took my kids a while to want to watch this because they didn't particularly like the look of the turtles they are also huge tmnt fans.,1483315200,,1278,4.261410788381743

1. Megan Fox can not act.
2. Shredder looked too much like a Decepticon from Transformers.
3. The movie jumped from place to place too much and too fast.
4. The movie's pace was too fast at times.
5. They left Hamato Yoshi completely out of the story.

What I liked was:
1. The CGI turtles looked amazing!
2. The action sequences (including the battles) were awesome!
3. The basic plot of the movie was good.

Overall; Micheal Bay and the rest of the production crew kinda messed up our
'heroes-in-a-half shell' a little too much. I was a little let down in the end...

If you are someone who grew up with the Ninja Turtles back in the 80s and 90s and have been waiting for a live action adaptation that makes silly nods to the source material (i.e. use of the word Cowabunga, references to Pizza infatuation, the turtle's unique personalities i.e. goofball, tough guy, leader and nerd), then you'll enjoy this film. There isn't much story here, and the movie feels a bit short, but honestly if you're watching this its to watch the Ninja Turtles kick some butt and crack a few jokes here and there. Again some elements are just silly, and Megan Fox isn't the best pick for April O'Niel, but when it comes down to it I enjoyed the movie for what it was.

Here is and example at one point they're at a mansion on a mountain outside the NYC. The fight seen leaving said house was fought sliding down the mountain for what seemed to last for 20 minutes. After all that time you would have thought it ends at the bottom of the mountain but no it ends on a massive cliff.  The mountain out side the whole city was so huge its like they were sliding down the Himalayas. Also the Shredder suit is ridiculous and the last fight ends somewhat anticlimactic.,1477440000,,645,4.286885245901639

Very well done. I found the turtles likeable and would watch it again. As a dad, I found it family appropriate. Very little inappropriate language compared to most movies; nothing harsh. Kid friendly. Will watch the second one now. Found no stupid political agenda or inappropriate hidden meaning in this movie. The moral was: Always take care of family.

As entertaining as it tried to be, it just veered entirely to far from the source material for me to maintain my suspension of disbelief to enjoy this trash. For kids who never read a comic book or were ever exposed to better iterations of the franchise, this might be a pretty good action flick. Also, the acting was pretty terrible. I expected hot garbage from Megan Fox but the caliber of performance from William Fichtner and Will Arnett was significantly worse than their abilities based on evidence from previous works.

Of the 4 turtles, Raphael's character was the most fleshed out, with Donatello  and Leonardo as well developed and scripted as a set of store mannequins. Michelangelo's transformation from California-surfer-dude in the original series to an embarrassingly mentally handicapped character was annoying to watch and never explained.

I was impressed with the story line it was similar to the first movie but went into more detail the background of the turtles. The graphics are better. The only thing is the turtles were immensely bulkier than original movie. The turtles still had the same personalities. Good family movie,1471824000,,454,4.416666666666667

The dialogue for the turtles does a great job with their individual personalities and characters. Once when I was drinking and watching this movie Raphaels dialogue at the end honestly made my eyes water. I was really drunk though...
Point is, if you read any of the comics and watch any of the shows the turtles themselves will not disappoint you.
I particularly like the singing in the elevator part and the part where Donnie tells Raph to ""let him be the badass for once"".
As a whole, not a good movie, but if you like the turtles in other media then you will laugh at least once at their dialogue.",1471132800,,723,4.323529411764706

If you're looking for a movie that does justice to the TMNT legacy, then avoid this movie like the plague.

But being such a big TMNT fan as a kid I thought I'd give it a try since it was on Prime Instant. The story deviates a little from the origin story from the classic cartoons, but that's actually nice to see they attempted to be at least a little original.

I do not feel that Megan Fox was the right person to put into the movie because one she did not fit the description and two she is not the best actress out there by all means.  Honestly I believe that the cast makes a big impact on how the movie is and how much I liked it.

Also the origin of their growth and intelligence has changed from accidental to deliberate (by April's father) testing.  There is no explanation of Shredder's origin, unlike in the original series.  In this movie, Shredder is out only for the serum that changed the Turtles.

I was shocked just now to see that the female lead was Megan Fox. She's really changed; not sure what to say about that. This is obviously a movie that targets an audience of mostly children. I thought that some of the language in the movie was very inappropriate but most of what comes out of Hollywood these days seems to not show any type of moral countenance for children audiences. I've seen the same thing with even Disney; not really a surprise seeing the path they are going down. I'm sure if it was possible, Walt Disney is flipping over in this coffin and ashamed of what the powers that be have done to his family oriented company. I digress. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was entertaining, I wouldn't go out of my way to watch it again but this is just my opinion. I would recommend parents watch it first to decide if the small amount of inappropriate language in the show is okay for their children or if it would even register.",1469059200,,1058,4.430769230769231

For a kids movie, the underlying plot was a little ridiculous - huge multinational company engineering disaster for profit is too heady and convoluted for children - and the entire film is a substantially worse movie than the 1987 classic - which, here, says something about modern film making in general.

About 15 minutes in you realize that the miscasting of Megan Fox as April O'Neil is the least of this film's problems. Perhaps small children will enjoy this film because they have no reference point for the original series, but even then I give pause. Why? This movie is somewhat inappropriate for small children. Will Arnett's character Vernon's only role seems to be to ogle and make sexual remarks about April O'Neill. I haven't seen the sequel yet, but I only hope he has a reduced role with the introduction of Casey Jones.

The turtles had a lot of fun lines and they seemed to be mostly true to the characters. Megan Fox did fine in her role... if I didn't think of her as April O'Neil. In other words, her acting was good and the character fit the story, she just didn't resemble the April that I know at all. Also it kind of bugged me that [SPOILER ALERT] they killed off the Shredder in the first movie. They did the same thing in the classic Turtles movie and it always bothers me when they kill off the main villain in the first movie so he can't come back in the sequels.

2185897,3,B0006H328E,"I really wanted to like it more than I did. It's hard to judge a reboot without comparing it to what has come before. If you were to sit down with this film without any prior knowledge of the Turtles' universe, you might be able to fully enjoy it and may even say it was a rip-roaring good time. It had great visuals, good action and pacing, and a simple yet engaging story with decent jokes.
However, having grown up with the turtles cartoons, movies, and video games, it will let you down hard. Master Splinter had a completely different personality which wasn't convincing and ultimately failed to evoke empathy for his character. The other turtles were amped up stereotypes of their own characters, which created a strange dissonance that I had a hard time trying to reconcile. In effect there is really no character with which to bond.
That Shredder though, he was pretty badass.",1466553600,2,884,4.673076923076923

2186201,1,B0006H328E,"As a fan of the old 80's cartoon show and growing up a huge Ninja Turtles fan, watching this movie wounded my soul. I never saw it in theaters, saw it in the Prime library and thought, I'm sure it couldn't be as bad as I've heard. Wrong! I paid nothing to view this and left feeling owed restitution.

For the good guy line up, the film stars Megan Fox, who, as usual, is a pretty face who can't act her way out of a Pizza Box. The whole contrived story of April O'Neil having the turtles as pets and her dad being a Mutagen scientist is so contrived and unnecessary. She's a reporter, she finds Ninja Turtles, 'nuff said, don't need to complicate it.

The turtles themselves are okay, but underdeveloped in favor of screen time for Fox and lengthy over the top action sequences.

Will Arnett's comedic relief is the one saving grace in this movie.

On the evil side of the fence, you have a wealthy corporate bad guy whose sole motivation for doing evil is to go from really rich to ""stupid rich"" - what? And then there's Shredder who looks like a left over extra from Bay's Transformers debacle and more closely resembles an actual paper shredder than the iconic villain.

On the whole, the film was painfully generic and completely predictable from start to finish.  Only watch this movie if you need a film to make fun of, or need a reminder that not everything needs to be remade.",1465776000,2,1385,4.411764705882353
2186202,5,B0006H328E,One of my all time favorite when I was younger. I wanted my four year old daughter to see it and she just loves it. I also wanted her to see it before she seen the new one that just came out. I haven't seen this movie in forever and it brought back a lot of good memories. The actors did such a great job and the turtles look so amazing for such an older movie. I definitely recommend everyone watch this movie and show your kids.

The plot for a movie like this is basically just an excuse to get the action going. So the plot is pretty much nonsense and falls apart if you think about it too much. The action is decently entertaining though. There were a few moments though when my brain realized that I was (again) just watching CGI characters with no weight or occupying real space fighting. That took me out of it a bit. That's been a recent trend with a lot of movies though.

I'd liken it to a rickety carnival ride in our small town fair.  Thrilling but ready to fall apart at any moment - good harmless fun.  The characters are strangely likable and we all laughed.  Nothing about it is ""realistic"" so the violence didn't bother me and I'm a bit sensitive to that.  The effects are passable.",1465257600,3,452,4.321428571428571

Since the comics were first published when I was 2, all my reference for the series comes from the original Cartoon series. This movie reminds me more of the first episode of that series. On a more critical note, the movie lost steam towards the middle and the action sequences drag a little. This story arc includes Aprils' boss Vern, and he adds a comedic touch to the human cast, one thing that none of the movies have ever done is portray April, she is story obsessed and is pretty much Lois lane in a Jump suit(1940s and 50s Superman cartoon Lois Lane)at least in the Old Cartoon series anyway, Don't know how she is in the Comics.",1464739200,,827,4.341935483870968

I guess the problem is really that the kids who grew up loving the Ninja Turtles are not who this movie was made for.  I get remaking something was popular with kids once and updating it so that it can be popular with different kids today, but I think it's lazy to aim for the lowest possible bar.  There are so many movies out there that are for ""kids"" and ""families"" that are also big hits with the grown ups, and I really wish this movie could have been for fans of the franchise, old and new.",1463529600,,669,4.336

2187004,3,B0006H328E,"I only heard terrible things about this movie, which actually made it easier for me to enjoy. The action scenes can be pretty fast-paced and upbeat at times, albeit not very martial artsy, and there were a few points where the turtles are suddenly bulletproof or something else impossible, but when you get to these points in the movie it's crucial that you remember a few things:

1. This is a movie about talking, intelligent turtles.
2. These turtles claim to be teenagers.
3. These turtles are also mutants from some sort of genetic experimentation.
4. Of all things, these turtles call themselves ninjas.

I've never been someone who understands much about music, so I can't really give you any sort of reliable assessment of the score. It didn't hurt my ears, so that's a plus.
  All in all, I started this movie expecting to only keep it on for a few minutes so that I could laugh at how terrible it was but ended up finishing it. It made me laugh several times and had some decent feel-good moments. If you can get past the predictability and unbelievably creepy rendering of Master Splinter, you very likely might find yourself pleasantly surprised by the time the credits roll.",1463356800,,1187,4.6923076923076925

2187041,2,B0006H328E,"The first two films from the 80s were silly fun, if the plot was utterly ridiculous. TMNT (the computer animated one) was probably the best film thus far. So if a ranking was given this film would compete with the third live film for dead last of the theatrical releases. This doesn't mean there wasn't some good moments or development in this film. Even though Megan Fox is known as a terrible actress, she does a decent job in this film as a mostly career focused woman. They did fall back on using her as a frail woman, unfortunately. She fainted when meeting the Turtles, even though she can handle herself with career terrorists (the Foot)? The use of Whoopi Goldberg as the head of news outlet was a good move and worked well in the film. The elevator scene is the one part of the film that I quite enjoyed.

I hope to never ever watch this one again. It just wasn't very good. The turtles were ok, their voices were ok, but there was nothing special about any of the characters, human or otherwise, in this movie. Megan Fox isn't even all the pretty. The girl in the 1990 version had attitude. And the guy that was with her (in the 1990 version) was much more interesting. The guy in this movie had absolutely no personality.

It's a kids movie, based on a television cartoon that pretty much all of kiddos watching have no idea that it used to be on TV, much less a critical view of the movie.
I watched the cartoon as a kid. Now the movie as an adult.
Simply put:
Great fun. Exceptional morals, leadership and camaraderie shown throughout.
Fantastic sfx action. Excellent stunt action. Both the live-action work and the CGI are very well done, flow pretty seamlessly for these difficult characters to render. The kids will love it; gamers should dig the gfx/sfx.

Don't miss a fun movie because some grumpy fans/critics panned this flick. Fun action and good-guys winning. Don't miss it.",1462406400,,760,4.801526717557252

The story isn't terrible and the banter between the brothers is nice. Will Arnett is kinda funny. Megan Fox might be the worst actress ever. Shredder looks like a Transformer and his dialogue isn't very good. Michael Bay loves that guy-dodging-things-coming-toward-the-camera-in-slow-motion-with-that-dumb-woo-woo-woo-sound-effect scene that is every single movie he's made. They make a couple of homages to older, better movies that don't rely on CGI and slow-motion effects to make the movie good.

I took it for what it was. Whether you liked it or not, I can purely say as a fan I was just happy to see The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on the big screen again. Plus, the release of this steel book fit amazingly in my collection",1460851200,,384,3.753086419753086

2187607,3,B0006H328E,"As a person who grew up in the ""Turtle"" era this movie pails in comparison. Its ok it has decent nuances but overall lacks decent development of the movie.

It is rated PG-13, but most kids 13 or older would be bored with the quality of this movie. Doesn't make much sense (plot, script, etc). A movie for the sake of making a movie. Typical flash-cut action scenes. It might entertain a 5 or 6 year old child for a few hours (if you can stomach it playing in the background).",1459641600,,448,4.160919540229885

Megan fox is good in some movies, just way off the mark for this one. The CGI was good, fight scenes were great. The dialog was either stale or was so predictable it made the movie almost boring.

2187637,3,B0006H328E,"I still like the originals.  They aren't perfect either.  I could not buy the Shredder's robotic suit, nor the magnetic throwing knives. It was too over the top.  Maybe, in the 2nd movie. But, before the Ninja Turtles, Shredder was all of that...unbelievable.  Many times it didn't make sense that the Shredder didn't kill or seriously injure the Turtles. Where was the connection to Master Splinter vs Shredder? He trained himself by reading books and taught the Turtles to be ninja's?  The original movies had him at least watch his master and injure the Shredder.  The somewhat connection and/ or the anger against Splinter by Shredder was blah.  Raphael's cracked shell was believable...until...he used duct tape and then was launched into an armored vehicle before launched again.--Very excited to hear Rock Steady & Beebop are in the next one. And, to hear that maybe the Turtles faces are going to be slightly adjusted to the retro look.  If not for my kid, I'd give the movie 2 stars.  A PG-13 movie advertised heavily for under 13 children is not the best idea.  Even they probably didn't get the big show down of the last fight, not to mention the epic (of a fail) fall from the building. --I thought the action was alright for all members of the family, but the cussing was not needed.  Although, I still give a bravo for not making it worse.",1459209600,,1353,4.690677966101695

2187751,2,B0006H328E,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, suffers the same array of problems that the Michael Bay directed Transformers films have suffered. The film takes emphasis away from the title characters of the film to put an increased focus on the human characters. To the film's credit, it doesn't clutter up the film with the same degree of human characters as the Transformers film did, but those elements of the film distract from the main thrust of the narrative. Further, the rest of the film's action is so cluttered and chaotic that it can't compensate for the rest of the film's weak points.

The film follows April O'Neil, played by Megan Fox. April, like her counterparts in the first film and animated series, is a reporter for Channel 6 news in New York City, who is investigating an increase in the crime rate brought on by a mysterious criminal organization known as the Foot. This is, also, unfortunately, where everything starts to fall apart. This version of the Foot is less a ninja clan, and more a PMC, carrying assault weapons, driving heavy machine gun equipped Hummers and so on. In the original film, The Foot had managed to operate with a considerable amount of subtlety and discretion. In the original animated series, Shredder and Krang were generally operating out in the open, but they still maintained the pretense of being a ninja clan, as opposed to going full Cobra. Here, they've gone full Cobra.

While investigating this organization, April discovers the existence of the title characters, and eventually their origin - the film's second major and dramatic break from the source material. In this version of the Turtle's origin, the Turtles and Splinter were laboratory experiments worked on by April's father, a scientist, along with another scientist, Eric Sacks, played by William Fichner. After a tragic fire broke out in the lab, April saved the turtles and Splinter, but was unable to save her father. If you're familiar at all with Fichner's recent filmography, it should be clear from early on the film that Sacks killed April's father - with the real mystery for the audience being not being the reveal of his identity, but why he killed April's father.

This also means that while the turtles certainly have a connection to April, and, by extension, Sacks, their historic connection with Shredder, through Oroku Saki, and Saki's connection with Hamato Yoshi (Splinter's former owner), is gone. The writers attempted to replace this connection with a contrivance that the Shredder is Sack's master, but this information is hidden until the middle of the film, and it's not clear why. This also means that while in earlier films Splinter was written as a Japanese American, either through casting (Mako in the animated film), or the voice acting performances for the character (as in the first two live-action films). Here those elements were absent. it almost feels like Whitewashing.

This leads into April and the Turtles attempting to defeat Shredder and Sacks, and where the film's action sequences come in. These sequences are either unfortunately darkly lit, or very chaotically structured. Early on in the film, fights are shot in a way where the Turtles aren't clearly defined in the film's environments - initially to play up the stealth elements of their fighting style. However, in the middle of the film, the amount of stealth used in those sequences is downplayed significantly, yet the characters are constatly shown in shadow, as if the director and crew were not confident in their CG.

In the back half of the film, the Turtles are more clearly lit, but the action sequences are also more chaotic and more difficult to track. There's a mix of shakey-cam, and enough visual clutter and busyness on screen to make it hard to figure out geography and more than the general gist of the fight scene. There are exceptions, fortunately. In particular, Splinter's fight with Shredder and the Foot is very well done, in terms of choreography and composition.

This is still a better film than TMNT III, but that is damning with faint praise. Otherwise, the film is completely missable, and indeed should be missed.",1458259200,3,4149,4.971181556195965

2187901,3,B0006H328E,"The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are a strong enough franchise to not only survive a bad incarnation, but also imbue an otherwise stinky one with a level of charm. Their latest movie  directed by Jonathan Liebesman (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battle-Los-Angeles/dp/B0034G4ORC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battle: Los Angeles</a>) and produced under a storm of fan protest by professional polarizer Michael Bay  exemplifies these points by being a middle-of-the-road action movie with a few inspired moments. While much better than I had expected, its ultimately a $125 million video game lacking emotional clout.

The story: Four ninjutsu-practicing mutants are New York Citys last line of defense against the criminal Foot Clans murderous scheme to bring both the metropolis and the world under their control.

The movie struggles to find its balance as it tries to pander to both nostalgia nuts and the PG-13 crowd. Personalities and storytelling are blunted, and mesh awkwardly with the post-modern humor. I enjoyed the scripts take on some characters - like the adorably nerdy Donatello (Jeremy Howard) - and I appreciated the relationship between the TMNTs and their papa Splinter (Tony Shalhoub), but I was turned off by the spectacularly unfunny Michelangelo (Noel Fisher) and horrified by what a socially-subnormal weirdo the movie passes off as April ONeil (Megan Fox). Theres a handful of legitimately humorous moments to even out the parts where you're just laughing at the weird ideas the film presents with a straight face. When weighed together, this all merely amounts to a dramatically staid story. No surprises, not much in the way of emotion, and not even anything in the way of pulpy charm.

The action content is a combination of fight scenes and larger environmental pieces. The latter aspect is a trademark of Michael Bay, whose crew has a knack for creating computer-driven adrenaline scenes that are very fluid but too bombastic to be taken seriously  just check out the so-cool-its-silly chase down the mountain. The fight scenes are a nuanced set, but I have to admit that there were some that I really liked. The best onscreen performer isn't one of the Turtles but Splinter, whose choreography in his fight against the Foot soldiers feels like a combination of something out of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Revenge-of-the-Sith/dp/B00005JLXH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Revenge of the Sith</a>&nbsp;and the work of Donnie Yen. The strength of the choreography sustains subsequent fights, but their pacing makes them feel less like karate encounters and more like a video game, with a ton of slow motion and other directorial gaga in place by the time we reach the showdown with the Shredder (Tohoru Masamune).

Also, I have to say it: the Turtles are butt-ugly. Though I know some die-hards who approve of these abominations, I think it looks like someone took their pre-production sculptures and melted their faces before converting them to 3D. But I got used to the design, much like I got used to the other faults, and was surprised to come away from the movie focusing more on its strengths than its weaknesses. Though theres no shortage to how much better its characters and story could have been handled, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles makes an impression with its visuals and gets my blood pumping. The filmmakers have laid groundwork for themselves, and while I won't get my hopes up too high, it would be great if they could build on it in with the upcoming sequel and fill in the organic gaps in this ones armor.",1457308800,2,3633,5.363157894736842

If you like Megan Fox, sure. Does it have Teenage Turtles? No. These are mid-20s turtles that are vastly different than the turtles that we all knew growing up.
I would not recommend at all. If you want to see the best part, watch the clip they released of the turtles beat-boxing in an elevator. Other than that, easily skip the whole thing!",1457136000,,518,4.350515463917525

I liked how the turtles were made to look like actual human/turtle mutants, not giant cute foam turtles. Many complaints were about this very fact (they liked the cartoonish foam look). Ha. I hated those cutesy foam Turtles,  these guys  definitely can emote, and looked badass. They actually acted like teenagers. Michelangelo's comments about everything "" She's hot! My shell is tightening!"".  The little number they put together on the fly  in the elevator then switch gears to fighting mode was fun. The fact that the end song Mikey used to serenade April was sung by the band the Turtles. Of course there was pizza, and one Kowabunga. It was fun funny fast action packed. I'll probably wind up buying this. Will Arnett and Meg Fox made it interesting and didn't suck, their acting was believable and not wooden.

And what's up with how some of the turtles are these weird semi-racist black stereotypes? That's not how I remember the brothers in the comics or other movies. The product placement is downright distracting, the turtles are over-flanderized caricatures, and it says a lot when I say that the only person not phoning it in was Megan Fox. It's actually kind of sad how much she effort seemed to put in for this role when no one else looked like they gave a s***.

As for this movie, based on other reviews you'd think it had shoddy CGI, terrible punch-lines and zero heart.  I would argue the opposite on every count.  Perhaps some critics were hoping for an ""adult"" TMNT that favored the storied original comics, but TMNT branding remains locked in to young boys.  As such, the jokes, action, pace and fun vibe of the movie is what you would expect, with plenty of thoughtful bonus touches.

I reserve 5 stars only for my personal all time favorites.  Considering the genre (kid flick, nostalgic, humorous action) this was easily 4.

It was a pleasant surprise.  Especially liked Mikie's personality and most of his jokes.  Enjoyed what they did with the turtles' different sizes and accessories relative to their known personalities.

Biggest negative: Shredder's costume design was the most glaring lack of subtlety for the whole show.  He came out looking like a super shredder robot in his very first fight scene.",1455580800,,1104,4.783068783068783

Clearly whoever wrote the script has never read the books and knows nothing of these characters and what makes them appealing. Just more mindless explosions and slo mo transformers type nonsense. With all the great storylines to draw from in the new graphic novel franchise reboot like ""city fall"", we instead got this cg filled disappointment. Not a fan of the sequel trailer either.

2188324,2,B0006H328E,"This movie was probably about 2 hours long, and I never did understand what was really going on; I believe that two hours is ample time to answer that question. In order to keep from spoiling the movie (if that's even possible with a plotless movie) I'll just say this:

1. The point of the movie is not very clearly defined. This is a must for any movie! An audience should be able to identify the plot-line of a movie, even if it sucked. In short, this movie isn't good, it's not even bad.

2. The ninja turtles aren't just out of character, but apparently they are also incapable of making other facial expressions besides ""pissed off."" I'm not kidding. There may have been three moments in the whole movie with very brief facial changes...I think it was the look of surprise. There were often times where their voices would sound excited, but they would look so miffed up, the result would be a confusing effect that cast an  overall mood where I didn't know if I should feel angry or excited, and both were inappropriate for the scene.

3. Who is Shredder?  And is it Shreddar like cheese (cheddar/shreddar?), or shredder like paper? Now I know there are some old school fans out there who know who he is (I'm one of them) but the movie really doesn't explain anything except that he exists and is evil. Sweet! So was Voldemort, so was the Green Goblin, so was Magneto, and countless other evil dudes who were far better explained in other movies. We know that bad guys are bad, the question is why? Who is he? What is he doing? Other than wanting to kill some turtles who were...created, and something about New York (you'll have to watch it....but you probably shouldn't) and more importantly (and this is where they really failed) WHY is he doing it? If you ask me...they should've just stole the plot from one of the old movies. It would have been better.

All those things came to together and made a weird and boring movie with tons of useless action with no plotline. (Also random inappropriate jokes, though not nearly as bad as the second Transformers)",1455321600,,2066,4.540322580645161

The dynamic between the characters was well built, and they even, get this, developed those characters.

It's like Michael Bay heard there was a thing called the teenage mutant ninja turtles and got bored while making it.

Shredder is basically Iron Man with that suit and all the gadgets it has, the turtles look stupid, their new background makes no sense, it's just bad all around. Maybe if I'd never seen the cartoons or been aware of the turtles before it might be slightly enjoyable.

2188384,2,B0006H328E,I have been a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fan a long time. The original canon was awesome. This movie is a cgi horror show. Bad actress Megan Fox performance is laughable. The turtles are so ugly they look like four cgi alien predator relatives. This is not suppose to be a horror movie. The story was really badly done. This movie is a cgi mess. The video game makers would probably never use the ugly turtle models used in this film version for a game. Just because the film makers over use cgi does not make the film a winner. People are getting tired of computer cartoons.,1454803200,,577,4.401869158878505

Even though I would have thought they would have used a lower key actress that would have played to April's demeanor a little better. I thought Megan fox did a good job.

2188808,4,B0006H328E,"I am not a fan of the series.  Never read the 80s comic book or watched a single episode of the tv show from that same era.  I guess it also becomes obvious that I never watched any of the movies that were made before this new iteration.  However, in a sense, I'm the perfect person to go into a movie like this blindly as a ""newbie"" to judge this world devoted to four 6' teenage anthropomorphic turtles who live in the sewers of NYC and fight crime with their ninjutsu skills.

Color me...surprised.  While Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3D remains mostly geared for teens and younger with its juvenile humor and tamed
violence, I was quite taken back by the film's level of production. This is certainly a Blockbuster orientated release and as such, all stops have been
pulled to push the envelope on its effects and entertainment value.  It's no wonder that the film has not only been released in 3D, but has Dolby putting its Atmos brand behind it as well.  More on that in just a moment...

If you are like me and have no idea of the history behind these crime-fighting leatherbacks, don't fret....the film does an excellent job of giving viewers a complete history of how a laboratory accident allowed the mutations of the four turtles: Leonardo, Michelangelo. Raphael, Donatello and their master, Splinter, a rat who became their adoptive father and taught them the ways of ninjutsu.

As the film opens we find that New York City is under attack from the a criminal organization known as the Footclan.  It's leader, Splinter, is a
sinister, highly-skilled dark master of ninjutsu.  One evening, a young, beautiful reporter named April O'Neal (Megan Fox), who has been investigating the Footclan activities, suddenly stumbles upon a crime-in-progress that puts her face-to-face with the city's superheroes. April attempts to convince her editor (Whoopi Goldberg) to break this sensational story in the news, but soon finds that no-one will believe that these crime fighting vigilantes even exist.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is filled with cutting-edge effects thanks to the efforts of Industrial Light & Magic.  Their motion-capture system that uses actors in body suits to emulate the turtle characters, comes off with very convincing results. And, with Michael Bay's production team behind the helm, it's no surprise that this film contains some very impressive over-the-top action sequences and effects work.

The transfer, in a word, is ""fantastic.""  Colors look suitable, and black levels are deep.  There is not one digital distraction to be seen anywhere.  Picture is so crisp that the amount of detail that can be seen within the turtle faces and long hairs attached to Splinter's nose is just immense. The day-lit scenes of New York City benefit the most from this transfer. They just ""pop"" with vibrancy, as do their neon-lit signs at night.

The 3D is a mixed bag.  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3D is not so much an out-of-display experience than it is in-display.  This is another typical film that production felt would be better upconverted than shot natively in 3D.  As all of you are aware, this greatly limits the format's impact.  Fortunately, there is an excellent level of depth represented here that saves this film from being a completely wasted upconverted effort.  New York is one of my favorite cities in the world, and I was quite pleased to see how much was filmed on and below its streets and how perfectly the
enhanced definition brings this metropolis to life like never before.  There is an absolute sense of expansive space as the camera swoops above and across the city during a climatic showdown between Shredder and the Ninja Turtles.  It's quite astounding.

I was surprised that a feature called ""In Your Face! The Turtles in 3D"" is included as a special feature.  I would not even venture to say that this film contains any impressive level of pop-out to quantify that claim.  I mean, c'mon, this is a film that was upconverted to 3D in post production.  That's one hell of a major strike against it.  There is no blatant ""In Your Face"" pop-out anywhere.  At best, some bladed objects as well as chunks of rock and snow do manage to slightly protrude themselves forward. I will tell you that this film is absolutely littered with light spots, smoke and floating debris that were purposely placed to give viewers an added sense of layered 3D effect.  Those are the elements that when combined with background depth, look very pleasing to the eye. Elements like falling snow, flying sparks and floating dust debris often place themselves just outside of the screen as if they are darting right before your eyes.  I just wish Michael Bay would stop using so much sunspot type effects in his film.  It's grossly overused here.

Absolutely no ghosting or crosstalk to be seen.

As I previously mentioned, Dolby had enough faith to attach their Atmos sound technology to this film.  While I do not have a Dolby Atmos compatible system (as of yet), I knew that the mix would automatically be reconfigured for my 7.1 setup (and subsequently 5.1 systems).
This is one hell of a powerhouse audio mix even at 7.1 level.  The overall sound design is nothing short of amazing with a precise level of detail that is craftily delegated to specific speakers across the entire soundstage.  The clanging of swords jump across channels while the swoosh of bullets whiz by your ears.  With our turtle heroes dispersed in every direction, it's not uncommon to hear them communicate from one channel to another.  LFE activity is extremely aggressive as it accents every punch and explosion on screen. Even Brian Tyler's choral-filled score gets some impressive LFE undertones.  This is certainly a soundtrack that can be considered demo material.  It's no wonder Dolby has their Atmos name behind it.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3D arrives as a 3-disc set housed in lenticular cardboard packaging.  The discs include the Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray and DVD feature discs and Digital HD content.  Extras include the usual behind-the-scenes production features as well as a ""Shell Shocked"" Music video.

As someone new to the franchise, not not knowing any of the history behind these characters, I found Teenage Ninja Turtles 3D to be a tolerable, entertaining experience. Most of that was due to it's extremely aggressive (and impressive) soundtrack and level of depth that its 3D presentation provides.  The 3D presentation won't even make my most recommended list, but it is still somewhat satisfying -- particularly for its scenes on and above the streets of New York City.

Hardcore fans of the turtle series may not like this film as much as I did.",1453075200,,6671,4.897595725734639

That being said,  I have avoided this movie for some time for one two reasons;  Michael Bay and Megan Fox.  Chiefly Megan Fox.  I usually avoid anything she appears in.  I find her acting very flat and 2 dimensional.  Her main claim to fame is her looks and that only holds up for a second or two for anyone over the emotional age of 15.  Anyway, back to the movie.  The entire plot is just a reworking of the script for Amazing Spiderman.  Come on.  Isn't there anyone in Hollywood with an original thought?  The action was good but nothing spectacular.  The special fx are again good but not groundbreaking.  A real waste of the talents of Whoopie Goldberg and Wil Arnett.

It made the turtles more impressive for a modern generation used to everything big.  The acting and dialogue of the turtles is brilliant.  April Oneal has never been important so I could care less who they cast but Fox is adequate. The changes to the plot make it seem slightly more realistic and feasable,  while they do still manage to like fun at the sillyness of the concept. The action is non stop.

There is a really cool snow mountain action scene that was amazing.

The CGI work is excellent.  Whether you prefer puppets, animations, or fx make-up, the workmanship on the CGI turtles were undeniably impressive.  The only problem with the CGI maybe the decision to make Master Splinter a bald wet rat.

I lopped off a star from my rating because of a few story line flaws I couldn't forgive.  I wished the story started out with the turtles and stayed on the turtles.  I felt April O'neil should have been a supporting character, not the main one.  This movie should have been titled ""The Adventures of April O'neil and the Mutant Turtles"".  My other beef with this movie were the side stories about Eric Sachs and Shredder.  Their motives for being evil felt a little flimsy.

I was also surprised at some of the adult humor in this.  It's not terrible, but it might be too racy for really young kids under 10 watch this movie.  Either they might not get some things or you'll have to explain it.

Let's of course be fair to the negative reviews: Michael Bay and the Transformers movies appear not just in Shredder, but also in the sound effects. Pay close enough attention and most of the action scenes have audio ripped directly from his other movies.

Having said that: I came in with low expectations, but it had several funny moments, the action was far better than I was prepared for, and I thought the turtles themselves were more interesting than in the past. They seemed more nuanced, less caricatured.

And his motives are not some weird vendetta, or convoluted ideological disparity with American culture. No. He just wants more money for the sake of having more money - no crazy debt, or evil plan that needs funding. There is no reason given for going through with all this, save getting more money. Never mind that he is releasing said chemical agent from his own building, effectively destroying his company's standing in the world.

2188906,3,B0006H328E,"As a huge fan of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, I grew up watching the cartoons, the movies, and I have even read all of the comics done by Kevin Eastman, including the classics, the ultimate collection, and the newest series. I had the toys, the sewer system, the pizza thrower, the turtle van and about 30 different themed turtles including the originals. And when I was very young, my parents took me to Six Flags to watch the ""Coming Out of Their Shells Tour"" in which I won't go into great detail about. I feel I've read or watched every iteration of the turtle's back story. So as a kid growing up at the time the turtles were at their peak and being a huge fan still at the age of 29, I feel I owe it to myself and to others to do this review.

****Spoiler Alert**** I will probably reveal parts of the movie, comics, and previous movies in my review.

The Good:

The characters personalities are spot on. I honestly thought that Johnny Knoxville doing Leo's voice would ruin the movie for me, but he did an outstanding job with the voice of Leo in this movie. Donny is still the nerd, Leo is still the Leader, Mikey is still the party animal, and Raph is still angry all the time.

Karai is in the movie. She is Shredder's great great great...etc Grand Daughter in the comics and plays a significant roll as well. I may go into detail about that later.

The turtles are not from outer space. Thank God that was just a rumor. I would have buried Michael Bay in this review if that were the case. The ooze is still the chemical that turns the turtles and Splinter into what they are.

I like that Michael Bay didn't make this movie as long as all of his transformer movies and kept the back story to a minimum. It leaves room to reveal more later, and to answer unanswered questions in future movies. I feel as though this movie is just kind of an acquaintance meet and greet movie with the turtles for people who have never seen or read about ninja turtles to get a feel for what they who they are and who they're against. Not to reveal all details of their past, shredders past, and the foot's past. Those details could be made into a movie by themselves depending on which iteration Michael Bay is going with.

I like that Raph says why he's angry all the time in his speech as the turtles are hurled to the earth in a near death experience. It's something I think he owes fans for a long time coming.

The back story is somewhat like the comic books in that they were a lab experiment that April let's loose when she's very young, but it ends there. The comics go into how splinter and the turtles are reincarnated with the souls of a Japanese Ninja and his four sons from futile Japan that were murdered by Oroku Saki (otherwise known as the shredder, in case you didn't know). In this movie, splinter finds an old martial arts book and reads it and learns it, and then he teaches the turtles. If this is how the backstory stays, I'll probably dock another star in a few years when the second turtle movie is released. But If the story goes into any details about splinter or the turtles being from futile Japan, I am all in on this movie series because I will have a better idea of where the story is going.

This movie wasn't as bad as the movie Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3 that released in 1993. Although it doesn't take much to be better than that one.

The Cons:

This movie doesn't even show the turtles fighting regular crime on the streets. They're crime fighters too. They're only enemy isn't just The Foot. Or at least that's what my impression has been growing up with them. This movie portrays the foot as the turtles' only enemy and there is not a single fight scene where they're just stopping a robbery or a mugging, or anything like that. It goes straight to the docks where they throw shipping containers. That's one of the flaws in the plot IMHO.

Meagan Fox is April O'Neal and she doesn't have red hair. Both of those facts are a con. Need I say More?

Shredder looks like a transformer. Yup. Thanks Michael Bay for ruining Shredders suit after you've done a few Transformer movies too many. The turtles are dressed with items that represent their personality. They couldn't just let you see what each turtle's personality was, they had to make it so obvious it's all over them. I guess whoever thought of that had very little faith in the minds of people who went to see this movie. I mean really? Donnatello...with GLASSES???? AND what seems like a backpack from the Ghost Busters. I mean COME ON.

Splinter learned martial arts solely from a book he ""just so happened to find"" ""conveniently laying in the sewer"". But as I said previously, this back story could still turn into something more complex so I'm not losing faith just yet.

A little more plot depth. I can put the plot into one sentence. Here: The ninja turtles were part of a lab experiment, learned martial arts from their rat master who learned it from a book, fight against shredder and the foot clan until shredder tracks April O'Neal to their home in the sewer, kidnaps almost all of them, and then Raph, April, and Vernon go on a road trip to save them, and in the process they just go ahead and defeat shredder while they're at it. Ok so it's not grammatically correct, but my point remains the same. It's still a very shallow plot.

Final thoughts on the movie:

The movie itself wasn't spectacular. It had it's moments that made me laugh. It had it's moments (Raph) that gave me goosebumps the first time I watched it.  It is similar to the plot from the 1990 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, but it isn't as bad as the third movie where they go back in time to Futile Japan. Although I'm giving this movie the benefit of the doubt, I'm very excited and very nervous of how the story develops from here. I will always have a special place in my heart for the turtles, but this movie didn't add any significance to that place nor did it degrade that place.

2189180,4,B0006H328E,"What is not to love about this movie if you're a kid? This is a good family movie to watch on a chilly night. My little girl loves TMNT! I'm embarrassed to admit that she knows who the characters are. I know their names; but, I always get mixed up with ""who is who"". She pinpoints each one and corrects me. My husband and I just laugh because she is definitely more interested in TMNT than I ever was when I was younger. Ahem, I believe I was a few years older than her when it was popular back in my day.
Honestly, I know that if you're a TMNT fan you'll be impartial to the original movie and this one won't live up to it. However, it's over 20 years later, so I understand how the studio tries to attract and appeal to the kids today and somehow tries to incorporate some old with new. My only qualms are that the turtles look too ""roided"" and Splinter looks extremely grimy (I know real rats are; but....you get the idea). I'm not going to nitpick every aspect of this movie; but, I can't remember how Splinter and the turtles learned Ninjitsu in the original movie; but, this movie depicted that Splinter learned it from a manual that was laying in the sewer and he taught himself and then the turtles. Of course, having done martial arts for a few years and for my husband who has practiced martial arts for over 20 years; this is inaccurate. However, this is a movie ie. make believe. We won't get bent out of shape about this.
Overall, the movie is definitely more ""updated"" than when I was a child.  I know I'll be watching this a few more times since this is one of my daughter's favorite movies.",1448064000,,1606,4.2655737704918035

2189202,2,B0006H328E,"This movie was a wonderful exhibition of CGI, and the connection between computer technology and film-making.  Unfortunately, the story falls flat.  There was never any real tension, which made the nearly obscene product placement seem even more obvious, if not desperate.  As I recall, the 1990 TMNT release actually had some heart even if it was predictable that the good guys would win in the end.  Sometimes our memories fail us, so feel welcome to take this 2-star review with a grain of salt.

Wife: Can I watch the new Ninja Turtles without you?
Me: Go for it.
Wife: Yesssssss
[15 minutes later]
Wife: So far, it's terrible.
[90 minutes later]
Me: Headed home, need anything?
Wife: An hour and 41 minutes of my life back.

Though to be fair, she kind of did this to herself, telling me ""11 minutes in I realized it was awful, but not awful enough to not finish it.""
