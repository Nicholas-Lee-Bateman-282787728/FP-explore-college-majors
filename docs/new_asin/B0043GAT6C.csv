8414897,3,B0043GAT6C,"I have a strange affinity for these obscure Renown films that VCI for years now has gone to the trouble of compiling on various sets and individual discs; and although their 'Crime Thrillers' collection is only okay as far as entertainment value goes, the prints are nice, the performances are above-standard and, at least, one of the titles ('Pit of Darkness') is unusual enough to make this otherwise lackluster trio of early-sixties U.K. B-movies worth owning.  Mr. Lovins fills in the technical specs capably in his review, and I generally agree with his ratings of the content, grading 'The Marked One' and 'Murder Can Be Deadly' (featuring a very young David Hemmings) each around 2 1/2 stars, and POD a significantly higher 3-plus.  Presentation (no extras-- unfortunately, as some academic context likely would make viewing more interesting) earns 3 1/2.",1414454400,,862,5.15

8414899,3,B0043GAT6C,"VCI Entertainment and Renown Pictures LTD presents ""RENOWN PICTURES CRIME THRILLERS COLLECTION"" (1961 & 1962) (203 min/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) --- Triple crime thrillers British style films from the '60s, stories of call girl gangland racketeering backdrop, blackmail and an amnesia victim falling under the guise of ""Crime"" of the ""Thrilling"" kind --- Check the Editorial Reviews for Product Description on this Amazon page for details.

MURDER CAN BE DEADLY (aka: The Pleasure Lovers) -- (1962) (60 min/B&W) -- Lance Comfort [Director] - Liz Fraser, Kenneth Griffith, Peter Reynolds, Tony Wickert, Craig Douglas, Nanette Newman & Ray Smith
This falls out of the realm of British crime thriller, rival gang bosses are not fighting over a girl but a con game gone wrong. [3 Star Rating]

[Trivia Note: The role of nightclub singer, played by Craig Douglas, was originally offered to The Beatles, but they were rejected by the producer, who thought they were too young]

THE MARKED ONE -- (1963) (65 min/B&W) -- Francis Searle [Director] - William Lucas, Zena Walker, Patrick Jordan, Laurie Leigh, David Gregory & Edward Ogden
An ex-con knows where the plates are for forging banknotes and because of that he is popular and unpopular in some circles at the same time, which does not live up to the thriller genre [3 Star Rating]

PIT OF DARKNESS -- (1961) (78 min/B&W) -- Lance Comfort [Director] - William Franklyn, Moira Redmond, Bruno Barnabe, Leonard Sachs, Nigel Green, Bruce Beeby, Humphrey Lestocq & Anthony Booth
Our hero has questions to be answered, how long have I been away, am I married, plus where am I now, in a blitzed bomb site. This solid B-British film works, thanks to a good cast and not a run of the mill plot and foremost a good director Lance Comfort at the helm.. [4 Star rating]

Check out ""The British Are Coming"" is the three minute sum and pieces of various British Films coming attractions to view on VCI, other than that no other bonus or extras --- Have been enjoying this series and prior British Films inclusive with drama, comedy and horror --- Looking forward to others in the series that have not seen the light of day for some time --- As a film buff and collector, will welcome future releases.
