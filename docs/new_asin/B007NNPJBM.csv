5100107,3,B007NNPJBM,I bought this because I really liked the first 2 docs of this series but this one was mostly footage about them and (spoiler alert) at the end when they were freed from prison the movie was over and I thought we would get some life after prison footage and interviews but no not really so I was a little disappointed in this one.,1365811200,,329,4.15625

5100111,5,B007NNPJBM,"A great film, a great series!  These guys are innocent.

I was shocked that the police got away with this for as long as they did.  The justice system is broken, and this movie points it out!",1362873600,,191,4.108108108108108

5100115,3,B007NNPJBM,"This was good.  Not as good as the first one, and much, much, worse the the 2nd (which was pretty brilliant imho).  I believe there is another documentary coming out either early this year, or maybe it came out late last year.  I believe it will focus more on the WM3 and their case for getting out of prison and a little less rehash.  There are a few very disturbing photos of the dead children/crime scene that I'm not certain had a place in the movie---since they had already shown more than enough of those images in the first two movies and thankfully in less gory detail.",1357862400,,577,4.364485981308412

They will certainly not be getting a handout from any tax payer (i.e. there is no Government funding for them) unless we give it willingly because we strongly believe  in justice.",1357516800,2,449,4.8311688311688314

5100119,5,B007NNPJBM,"I remember watching the first Paradise Lost film back in the day.  I remember thinking how it was presented in a way that was so brutal and real.  When I saw the evidence footage of the victims my heart sank.  This is not a documentary film series that I recommend for anybody with a weak stomach or other sensitivity to viewing real unedited evidence or hearing about brutal crimes.  The series is about as real and brutally honest as it gets.  The first film felt like it was biased at first but left you absolutely puzzled as to wether the convicted really did the crime or not.  The second film opened up the idea of other possibilities about what happened and gave you a better sense of the possibility that the boys were innocent and that a double and deeper injustice was taking place.  This third film solidified the fact that the accused were innocent and that it was the orchestration from a ignorant police investigation.  It is unbelievable to watch the hard headed beliefs of a police chief and judge their inability to change those beliefs, even when real hard evidence was falling on their laps. It was their undeserving pride in their profession and pseudo style justice that has led to this.  The end result, which at first seems like a victory, leaves you still feeling angry that true justice may never be found for ALL the victims and families.  I won't say anything else but to say that this is probably one of the best documented cases ever filmed, and that anyone who is open and willing to endure a few haunting and painful images as well as emotional story should not miss out on this series.",1355356800,2,1617,4.544827586206897
5100120,5,B007NNPJBM,I have the first two and this completes the collection. I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend this to others.,1354665600,,124,4.434782608695652
5100121,4,B007NNPJBM,"This is an excellent movie covering the fate of the West Memphis 3 from their conviction in 1994 through their release by the State of Arkansas, by way of an Alford plea, in 2011. This movie stands well on its own, however, I would also suggest the prior two movies on the subject for anyone interested in this case. The movie shows quite convincingly, how 3 young men were convicted of a heinous crime despite a deplorable lack of evidence. I feel so sad for the young victims, and was glad to see their names in the final credits. It is unfortunate that the real perpetrator will likely never be brought to justice, unless someone comes forward with new evidence. There were other leads, that could, and should have been investigated, but never were (the book ""Devil's Knot"" is very interesting, as well as articles on the WM3 website).
I rate the movie with 4 1/2 stars; 1/2 less due to the sound track, which was not good. Sometimes the music got so loud, that I could hardly hear what was being said.",1347667200,2,1005,4.497267759562842
5100122,5,B007NNPJBM,"I saw the 2 previous Paradise Lost dvd's & this one sums all of them up....a definite purchase for those who have the previous 2 documentaries!

See some previously unseen bits of footage and new information regarding the trials and witness testimonys, new revelations, different opinions, DNA evidence....it has everything you need to see that proves the innocence of these men....Good bonus features also!....a great dvd, highly recommended!",1347321600,2,443,5.514705882352941
5100123,5,B007NNPJBM,"This is an excellent DVD; I have seen them all, own them all and this is great as either the last one or the only one.  Either way, you will see three young boys be wrongfully convicted of the tragic, horrific deaths of three younger boys.  They are deserve freedom; I was shocked to hear on Jason's Facebook that Damien was upset with him for partaking in the production of a true story that must be told Devil's Knot.  Damien will likely come around and who can blame him for any and all bitterness but Jason is not the enemy; he has forfeited so much for Damien.  Jason to me is the most inspirational of all because he has never lost his amazing attitude.  Watch this film and all the others; I never believed until this case that the innocent were ever convicted of first degree murder much less given the death penalty in America but if it happened here and it did it must be happening plenty of other times.  I just hope the rest of their lives are filled with endless joy; as much as humanly possible under such dire memories of a lost childhood.  And those three precious little boys, may they rest in peace.  Terry Hobbs I believe is the most suspicious, Mark Byers used to seem so but realizing he was brave enough to take a lie detector test directly onto film and pass; he is just dramatic and was desperately lost; watch the one who is silent in the shadows, that man is Hobbs who was also the last to ever see the boys alive even though he denied it witnesses came forth.  One day hopefully the right person will be convicted and The West Memphis Three will be exonerated! But who could trust a system that so burned them the first time to give them justice the second time; they made the right choice I believe.",1346284800,3,1727,4.321981424148607
5100124,5,B007NNPJBM,"If it sounds as though I give away the end of the movie by saying the 2011 documentary PARADISE LOST, PART THREE: PURGATORY depicts a trio known as the West Memphis Three winning their freedom seventeen years after being erroneously found guilty of murder in Arkansas, please know I am not revealing the circumstances of their release, which makes for as surprising an ending as I've seen in fact or fiction.  As the state of Arkansas reconciles with the wrongly-jailed Jason Baldwin, Damien Echols, and Jessie Misskelley, Jr., in PARADISE LOST, PART THREE: PURGATORY, I was yelling at the television screen as loudly as I did at the end of PARADISE LOST: THE CHILD MURDERS AT ROBIN HOOD HILLS, from 1996, when the jury convicts the innocent men.

While you will still understand PARADISE LOST, PART THREE: PURGATORY if you haven't seen the '96 film and the 2000 sequel PARADISE LOST, PART TWO: REVELATIONS, make sure you see all three, preferably in order.  I'd like to meet one person who can view any of the PARADISE LOST titles and not seek the other two.  The PARADISE LOST films exhibit the best and worst in humanity and by that I don't mean good and evil but rather ignorance and knowledge as well as courage and cowardice.  While other reviews name the individual, I won't, but the transformation of one of the murder victim's parents through the eighteen years the films cover proves a sobering lesson for those who think they know it all,  in this Nancy Grace era of condemnation by conjecture.

How does the judge who turns a blind eye and deaf ear to evidence as he denies requests for new trials live with himself?  PARADISE LOST, PART THREE: PURGATORY reports he is now an Arkansas state senator.  May he repent.

And the same goes for others in the state of Arkansas.  As to why I say that, you'll have to view PARADISE LOST, PART THREE: PURGATORY to see just who the ones are, getting away with destroying the lives of the innocent.",1345420800,4,1949,4.653061224489796
5100125,5,B007NNPJBM,"My wife and I first stumbled onto Paradise Lost: The Child Murders of Robin Hood Hills a little over a year ago.  We purchased the first two films in a box set here on Amazon.  We weren't too familiar with the story but quickly became enamored with the court proceedings and revelations that involved the story of the West Memphis Three.  Not to mention the music by all-time favorite Metallica fit the feature perfectly. Without getting too in-depth I think the most ironic thing is that like West Memphis we watched the movie hoping the three were the culprits for the horrible crimes committed.  Everyone likes to think that the culprits of any crime are off the streets.  Unlike West Memphis however we became increasingly leery by the lack of evidence and police work involved leading us to the conclusion that the wrong people were behind bars after the first film.  Documentarians Berlinger and Sinofsky let us feel the same emotions that the town did and left the verdict up to us.  Expertly directed and produced series.  Clearly done with love and care for the topic.  If you're a documentary fan like we are you will watch this and face the hardest task of trying of finding something better and more engrossing.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paradise-Lost-Collector-s-Edition-Paradise-Lost-The-Child-Murders-at-Robin-Hood-Hills-Paradise-Lost-2-Revelations/dp/B001CDEGWM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paradise Lost (Collector's Edition) (Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills / Paradise Lost 2: Revelations)</a>",1345161600,,1579,5.771551724137931
5100126,5,B007NNPJBM,"This ""Paradise Lost"" trilogy is beyond documentary film making. A better description of the films would be that they are legendary journalistic heroism that are philanthropic education for the American public, in regards to the horrors that CAN arise from the U.S. justice system when it fails.

This film was never meant to be the ""final chapter"" of the Berlinger and Sinofsky series on the West Memphis 3 case.  When the film was practically 100% finished, a surprise hearing was called regarding the case. The hearing was prompted by the fact that the original trial judge David Burnett (who was also the judge for EVERY SINGLE APPEAL HEARING regarding this case) denied the WM3 an evidentiary hearing, despite allegations of juror misconduct in the original trial, recantations of testimony used in court, and DNA evidence that excluded the three defendants from the crime scene or the bodies AND pointed in a different direction that the police never investigated.  Burnett's decision caused the defense to go to the Arkansas supreme court to show that Burnett was in error. The defense team succeeded and received an evidentiary hearing for the 3 men in prison, a hearing in which David Burnett was finally NOT going to be the judge that the West Memphis 3 would have to appeal to.  The cops and District Attorney's office knew there would be a retrial, and that the defense would likely win. The unexpected hearing was called four months before the new evidentiary hearing.  If you don't know how it turned out, I won't spoil that part here.  Just know that because of that hearing, ""Paradise Lost 3: Purgatory"" became the final installment that the film making team would ever make.

Now, we have the DVD and not only is the film a revelatory piece of brave journalism and a highly entertaining film, it also has good special features.  The bonus material features deleted scenes from the original ""Paradise Lost: The Child Murders At Robin Hood Hills"" film, as well as interviews with the West Memphis 3 and the film makers, and previously unreleased footage that is incredibly valuable... most notably, we see the film makers finally address the false testimony of Vicki Hutcheson, who said she went with Damien Echols to a Satanic Esbat / occult meeting, in an attempt to play detective.  The bonus features show her recantation of the testimony (as well as past of the testimony) on video and when it was addressed at the ""new evidence press conference"" in 2007, accompanied by her own statement, presented by attorney Dennis Riordan, which she admits ""Every word was a lie"" and details her drug use at the time of the testimony.  Also, the ""Hollingsworth testimony"" that is alluded to in the first film (but not shown) is included, and shown to be total hogwash.

I could talk about this case forever, but I won't. You should watch this entire trilogy, but part 3 is one of the best documentaries I've ever seen, and the bonus materials are simply awesome.  Historic documentaries and heroic journalism led to an outcome of compromise, which really satisfied no one more than 50%.  If you know the case, don't hesitate to pick this DVD up and make sure you check out the very valuable special features, which provide further evidence of corruption, incompetence and indifference of the police and the justice system in this case.  A wholly satisfying view, with a great message, along with the ability to teach the American public some things they need to know about cops and courts.

The West Memphis 3 Case was a tragic miscarriage of justice, and it's been filmed from the beginning. Everyone should see all 3 films in this trilogy.  A heart-wrenching tale, while showing the strength of the human spirit even in the face of injustice.  This story changed my life, and I hope you are moved too.

In my opinion, we have to EXONERATE these men!  And go find the real killer.",1344902400,21,3888,4.828313253012048
5100127,5,B007NNPJBM,"There is so much evidence that proves the West Memphis Three had NOTHING to do with the murders of three boys in 1993... and this third part of Paradise Lost brings it all to light. These documentaries are probably the most important crime documentaries ever made. Last year, around this time, I was thrilled to hear that the WM3 were to be released from prison. I had to watch parts 1 and 2 of Paradise Lost again, to further my excitement and happiness for the three, especially for Damien Echols.

I've been watching part 3 right now, as it is on HBO.... this is incredibly awesome.

I am SO buying this DVD this week.

If you're reading this review... and are on the fence.... seriously, this is the best part of the whole trilogy.",1344729600,,735,4.470149253731344
5100128,5,B007NNPJBM,"This video tied everything together for me. Knew nothing of this case and read a TC book about it years ago( title forgotten) it was written as if these boys were guilty,I remember thinking.wow! So little evidence

I came across the first documentary on HBO I kinda thought they did it. Damien's attitude..the confession.it almost had me convinced.
The second documentary swayed me the other way. I was just unsure but leaning  much more towards innocence. I learned that ALOT of people make false confessions after all that pressure from police( who knew?)
After this documentary I am totally convinced. I have grown up ALOT my self over 18 years and looking back I don't know how I could of ever thought them guilty..because of gossip,Satan worship sites that didn't exist! Kids dressing in black..small town ignorance at it's best.
I am so happy that these men are now free,so sad that they were robbed of their youth,but very much in awe of the strength that they showed through this ordeal!

I know the real killer will never be caught because the state will never admit that they were wrong But I only hope the worst for him.
I hope those three can get on with life,so much to learn. I can imagine walking out of prison after 18 years. God bless these guys and give them long,happy,productive lives!",1341964800,4,1305,4.689956331877729
5100129,5,B007NNPJBM,"I saw the premiere in cable tv, throgh HBO, it`s a great documentary, and there is a lot expectation in Southamerica for this DVD, It has Spanish subtittles of course, or not??",1338336000,,176,4.53125
5100130,5,B007NNPJBM,"In 1994, three teenagers in West Memphis, Arkansas were accused and convicted of murdering three 8-year-old boys. These events were captured from the beginning by documentary filmmakers Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky and released in 1996 as Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills. The documentary and the 2000 follow-up Paradise Lost 2: Revelations made a compelling case that they were innocent and fifteen years since the story was told, Paradise Lost 3: Purgatory brings a bittersweet close to the saga.

Damien Echols, Jason Baldwin, and Jessie Misskelley (known collectively as the West Memphis Three) spent over 18 years in prison for murdering Steve Branch, Christopher Byers, and Michael Moore, a crime they claim they didn't commit. The ""Free the West Memphis 3"" movement enjoyed celebrity support, with some actually paying for the three's legal proceedings. Berlinger and Sinofsky initially travelled to West Memphis to follow the trial, believing the three were guilty. What they caught on film stunned them and that first documentary is credited with getting people involved in helping free the three men. This is the third and final (?) film in the series. It was already completed when the three men were surprisingly freed last August and the directors quickly returned to the editing room to give the film an ending with more finality. This surprising epilogue added 12 minutes or so.

The doc is separated into three chapters (Past is Prologue, What's Old is New, and All Means All) and an epilogue. If you have not seen the previous two, there is no need, but it does make the end of the journey seem more extraordinary. Aside from bringing to light all of the newfound information, there's a recap of the entire case. The horrifying opening is set to Metallica's atmospheric ""Sanitarium,"" while it goes over the crime scene video and summarizes the case, mixing old and new interviews. This includes previously unseen courtroom footage and depositions, as well as major details like Misskelley's controversial confession that provided the first link in a chain of events leading to their conviction.

The chief investigator of the case disputes their innocence and offers those who believe in it to look at what wasn't shown in the documentaries. He begrudgingly admits that it's all public record, but seems to assume that all opinions are based solely on the films. We're also shown footage of celebrities like Johnny Depp, Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder, and Natalie Maines of the Dixie Chicks voicing their support.

Most importantly, the film continues its investigation into whether the three received a fair trial, as well as the bias that may have hindered their release. The judge who heard their appeals and denied all of them presided over their original trials. During the original trial, a defense lawyer pointed out that a testifying occult expert lacked the education necessary to be labeled an ""expert."" The judge's response, few would argue, is ridiculous.

There are new interviews with the victims' families, some of whom are still skeptical about the public support and believe, without a doubt, that the right men are in prison. In fact, Todd and Dana Moore wrote a letter to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to request the film be removed from consideration. One parent isn't skeptical however and that may be the documentary's biggest surprise.
In the two previous docs, one man was honed in on and became a prime suspect in the court of public opinion. His passionate, over-the-top declarations of hatred for the three men and the mysterious coincidences in his life around the time of the murders didn't help. This man is John Mark Byers, who now has ""Free WM3"" stickers adorning his truck and admits he ""lead the bandwagon"" when it came to believing the three boys were guilty. I was aware of Byers' newfound convictions, but to actually see him proclaim their innocence and read a letter he received from Damien Echols (who publicly stated that he believed Byers to be the killer) is quite surreal. He's much more sedate now too, but no less passionate about their innocence than he was their guilt. Thankfully, he's less over-the-top. The negative focus on a parent has not ended with Byers, but instead directed its gaze towards another stepfather.

The center of attention is now Terry Hobbs, whom Natalie Maines publicly accused of murdering the three boys. Hobbs sued Maines and videos of his deposition are included here. Hobbs is a man of contradictions. His alibi for the night the three children disappeared has been disputed, he claims not to be violent but it's revealed that he hit his wife and shot her brother. He claims not to have seen his son that fateful day, but a neighbor, who was never questioned by police and was unaware of his claims, says she saw him with the three boys on the day they went missing. Most damning is that a hair was found on one of the shoelaces used to tie the boys and it could match Hobbs.

Certainly, the documentary railroads Hobbs in the same way West Memphis railroaded the WM3 and the previous documentaries railroaded Byers. It paints Hobbs in an unfavorable, dishonest light and many will walk away with the belief of his guilt...Just as they did Byers. In his interview footage he often seems weary and cynical of the situation, making this whole ordeal unfortunate if he's truly innocent.

John Mark Byers certainly believes he may be guilty and in a display that suggests more intelligence than we've seen before, he holds up a homemade sign presenting evidence of Hobbs' guilt and his innocence. The former side is much heavier on facts than the latter. He explains his case with passion and (maybe unintentional) humor, but it's an undeniably strong, but mostly circumstantial, case.

While, arguably, more people believe the West Memphis Three are innocent than guilty, there have been complaints that these documentaries are biased in their favor. Berlinger and Sinofsky deny the notion, saying they began the project convinced of their guilt. Almost any documentary will contain bias, so it's certainly possible that these films pass over certain information. With all of the facts a matter of public record, you should certainly form an educated opinion by doing some reading instead of basing all your views on what you see here. However, with this closing chapter in the saga, it's clear that these documentaries make a more compelling case than one based on simple guilt or innocence.

In the United States, anyone accused of a crime must be given the right to a fair trial. In some situations, killers with strong DNA evidence implicating them have been released on the basis of a mistrial. No one likes seeing a killer walk, but it's great that we live in a country that affords us the privilege of proving our case without bias and beyond a reasonable doubt. Whether Damien Echols, Jason Baldwin, and Jessie Misskelley are innocent becomes irrelevant in light of the facts.

Regardless of their guilt or innocence, these men should never have been imprisoned based on the juror misconduct, unreliable witnesses', shoddy detective work, misinterpretation of evidence, and witch-hunt climate that took place at their trials. Three months before new evidentiary hearings were to begin; the state of Arkansas released these men by allowing them to enter Alford pleas, a rare legal move where the accused maintains their innocence while entering a guilty plea.

This freed the three after 18 years of imprisonment, while freeing the state of Arkansas from admitting they were wrong, behind held responsible in court, or delivering the real killer. Baldwin claims he didn't want to accept the deal and did so only because of Echols' death sentence. The film closes with Baldwin saying ""this isn't justice.""

During the press conference immediately following their release, Echols' lawyer says that the state of Arkansas admitted the WM3 were innocent by allowing them to Alford pleas. Three months before an evidentiary hearing (that would be the men's last legal option), they allowed them to walk in a way that kept them from being sanctioned. It's hard not to buy into this; why would Arkansas let three men walk if they were so convinced that they were guilty of brutally murdering three children?

These films were paramount in gaining attention and support for the West Memphis 3 and are evidence of what a powerful medium the documentary can be. This makes Paradise Lost 3: Purgatory a powerful cinematic statement and a triumphant, but imperfect end to the trilogy. The documentary is just as fascinating and enlightening as the previous two, only growing dull when the film begins covering information you may already be aware of. The triumph and imperfection also applies to the true end to their story, although if whoever is responsible for the murders is caught, there may be more to look at.

This may be the most poignant and, ultimately powerful documentary in the trilogy because it finally concludes a story many have followed for sixteen years or more. I'd make a case that the Paradise Lost trilogy as a whole makes for one of the most compelling and important documents in cinematic history. These films changed everything for these three men. Those few still convinced of their guilt won't find much to enjoy here, but those who have followed this story for years will rejoice and perhaps even shed a tear. This is a phenomenal closing chapter and a terrific documentary, one of the best documentaries and one of the best films of last year.

8519694,4,B007NNPJBM,"A powerful, if frustrating, conclusion to the Paradise Lost films which chronicle the extremely questionable conviction of 3 high school aged young men for the horrible murder of three little boys. Despite the fact that the case against the three was absurdly weak, seeming to be based as much on the idea that they acted 'strange', or listened to heavy metal music as in any hard evidence (the strongest 'evidence' being a recanted confession given by one of the young men with an IQ of 72, who was questioned without council for 12 hours, and with no recording or transcripts of what went on in the first 11 hours. And even then, the confession was full of factual mistakes).

This third film picks up with the men having been in prison for 15 years, and finally moving towards possible exoneration under pressure on the Arkansas justice system from across the country and even the world. Mostly the film focuses on the uncovering of yet another possible 'real' killer (although the 2nd film also did so and pointed convincingly at the wrong man, showing just how hard it is to ever fully know the truth). It also shows the lengths to which those involved in the first trial, especially the judge, put their own reputation and their inability to admit error, or even questions, above a search for true justice.

The film has it's flaws; it spends a lot of time re-capping the story, and never seems to acknowledge how confusing the issue of guilt is, as the 2nd film showed in seeming to point at the wrong man for being 'weird', just as the trial did with the 3. Also the dramatic conclusion feels tacked on and incomplete - not the fault of the filmmakers, as much as of timing. The film was essentially done when the directors had to race to Memphis to film a climax that ended up more like an epilogue than it should.

But this is an important document of just how easily the legal system can fail when prejudice and self-interest come into play - as they will continue to do as long as we are human and frail creatures.",1454803200,,2026,4.545205479452055

8519699,5,B007NNPJBM,"I've followed this story since HBO aired the first documentary and have been interested in this case for many years.  This is the last installment in the trilogy. The producers had an open agenda to attempt to prove that the three young men were arrested on the basis of hysteria and religious intolerance.  I still have my own doubts as to their guilt or innocence.  God will prove who was right or wrong when the time comes. Still, this is a very well made film and takes you inside the case and the lives of those involved.",1405728000,,526,4.402061855670103
