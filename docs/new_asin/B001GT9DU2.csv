3619606,1,B001GT9DU2,"Firstly I will state that I am a VERY big Xenosaga fan and that is probably why I hated this show. It is riddled with a myriad of problems that stem from it not following the game very well.

Firstly lets talk about the animation. Toei animation is the LAST studio i would have wanted to do a Xenosaga anime. The games have a great look(despite them all looking different) and they made this look more like Astro Boy or Dragon Ball then they made it look like Xenosaga.

In terms of storyline it's a total mess. Characters appear when they shouldn't certain characters die later in the story which completely removes the significance of their death(Virgil for example)  Many characters act NOTHING like they do in the original game and take actions which are going against what they are trying to accomplish. All the deep Philosophical, Religious and science aspects of the show have been all but removed(which considering Toei makes stuff for kids that's probably why despite the show not being a kids show at all).

The action scenes fail to live up to the game in any way shape or form which should have been pretty easy considering animation is alot more free form then making a game engine.

The beautiful soundtrack from the games is gone and replaced for a crappy mediocre one that adds nothing to the show(which is a shame as music was a VERY big part of the games).

And if you happen to be a fan of the original voice cast from the English version of the game(which were top notch) you will be disappointed yet again as every single character is recast and in most cases are HORRIFYINGLY miscast.

If you are a fan of the game don't bother with this show. It will do nothing but sadden or anger you. Hunt down the special Edition of Xenosaga 2 that comes with a DVD of all the cut scenes from the original game and watch that instead. You will have a infinitely more enjoyable time.",1281916800,8,1892,4.482558139534884
3619607,5,B001GT9DU2,"I went into this expecting a fairly decent series, and I got my wish, basically this is a retelling of Xenosaga Episode 1 following some of the plot and ending the same way as the first game, with some differences, like a certain side character surviving the Gnosis attack on the Woglinde, and the way several characters are already on the Elsa.

Keeping with the tone of the games, this is a fairly fun Scifi series with some drama added in, the animation is good, the music too.

I love how they made this series fresh to players of the games, even the final scene, but at the same time keeping the final climax from the games story in tact.

I fully recommend this series, although it has a new dub cast, it's really well done, and with it being 12 episodes long, could work if you want to marathon it.

I realise it may not be for everyone, but for the price on Amazon, it really is worth picking up and watching.",1271635200,8,917,4.283236994219653
3619608,1,B001GT9DU2,"If this is the only animated show version of the series that exists, then I have seen it, and as someone who completely worships the games, this show version made me cringe.  The events are completely out of order, people show up in scenes they're not supposed to be in, and things jump around and happen so fast that it makes the overall meaning of the story hard to follow.  Some of the characters do things that conflict with their own personalities and/or motives, and it makes you wonder as a fan what exactly the show producers are going for; my favorite character, Albedo, for example, is shown doing things he would NEVER do in the game, partly because of his personality, and partly because it would conflict with his goals and completely waste his time.  As he is a brilliant mastermind in the game, it completely ruins his character to show him doing petty, useless things in the show (and worse, they make him look like a pedophile, which he totally isn't if you fully understand the game's story).  In a lot of ways it seems like they are going for dramatic shock value or something, because there are plenty of scenes in the game with long, involved, thought-provoking dialogues which would probably not grab the attention of many anime viewers, and which were thus left out of it.  (I know this because I've actually read more than a few reviews of the game which criticize how drawn out the cutscenes are.)  While Xenosaga explores several deep, philosophical themes, and many new popular anime shows do the same, for some reason this anime version seems more shallow and designed almost for children, it's sad to say. As far as the technical aspects, the animation/graphics are decent, and it is interesting to see the characters drawn in a different way physically, but the graphics in the game are far more attractive, and the game's soundtrack is so engrossing that it is not to be missed either, unlike the show's soundtrack.  It's hard to tell how the voice acting/dialogue compares with the game, as the version of the show I've seen is in Japanese with subtitles, but the subtitles do seem to cut out a substantial amount of depth.  And like I said, this show version is SHORT, compared to the cutscenes in the game.  Any way you look at it, if you are a fan of the game, the anime series seems something of a disappointment, and I would definitely not recommend showing this to someone to try to get them involved in the series.  If they were trying to showcase the game's story to a larger audience, this was not the way to do it.  I really hate to say this too, because I desperately wanted to like it.",1259539200,4,2629,4.572340425531915
3619609,3,B001GT9DU2,"I really wanted to like ""Xenosaga."" As sci-fi, the show has a fantastic post-earth premise.  The art is well done and the characters are generally compelling. The Gnosis are the type of antagonists that you love to hate. Then comes KOS-MOS. While she may appear to be a vixen, KOS-MOS is really an android super hero who may be the only thing that can save the human race. The mysterious KOS-MOS immediately jumps the shark. For starters, she's an unsympathetic character. KOS-MOS' abilities are entirely unbelievable and her design is clearly a desperate attempt to appeal to the adolescent male demographic. While I could have made my peace with a smaller dose of KOS-MOS, she's a central figure. After watching the first disc, I decided that I couldn't go any further. In the spirit of disclosure, I never played the game so my review is entirely based on the merits of the show. Unless you're watching the show as an extension of your love of the video game, like minded anime fans should first check out something like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Starship-Operators/dp/B000IHYVOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Starship Operators</a>."" ""Xenosaga"" has much going for it but in the end, there's better anime out there.",1254873600,5,1260,5.363636363636363
3619610,4,B001GT9DU2,I enjoyed this Anime collection very much. You can find other reviews that will tell you all you could want to know about the story and content. So in summation it was amusing and enjoyable.,1253577600,,190,4.457142857142857
3619611,4,B001GT9DU2,"I'd rather watch the games sequences in order from the first game, this is just the same with anime drawing style instead.  The game was prettier.  If you can't play a long game like",1250121600,,182,4.323529411764706
3619621,5,B001GT9DU2,"Seeing the series sold separately into different DVD boxes, and even the complete series was pretty expensive for my tastes. Especially when considering the shipping, I wanted to pay less. I am glad that I got my chance. I am a big fan of the games, and and I did not want to spend too much on something that I had already played through many times. At least the story is slightly skewed to make things interesting. I am more satisfied that I waited to get this instead of impatiently purchasing the series more much more earlier.",1352592000,,530,4.474226804123711
3619622,5,B001GT9DU2,"Xenosaga is difficult to review because it has two disparate interest groups: those who want to know how the movie compares to the video game and those who want to know if it is worth buying as a movie on its own merits.  Reviewers from the first group have already written excellent reviews.  I'll address my review to the second group.

In many ways, Xenosaga is a traditional anime science fiction movie.  The humans are threatened and need new weapons to counter the threat.  Their best hope is a female combat robot constructed by a woman named Shion.  Shion is pretty cute and her robot is also pretty cute.  Xenosaga has something for the boys to look at.

Except for Kirsch, the characters are traditional anime science fiction characters.  The animation is very good.  There is plenty of mecha combat and subplots to hold your interest.  It has 12 episodes, which seemed right for the story content.  It's not rushed, nor is it drawn out.

What makes Xenosaga exceptional is the subplot that centers on a 100-series Realian girl named Kirsch.  The issue is whether or not Kirsch possesses free will.  To find out, you'll have to wait until the end of the story.  Be prepared for a Japanese river of tears.

Xenosaga is not about the female combat robot.  It's about whether or not Kirsch possesses free will.  That is what makes Xenosaga a meaningful story.  After finishing it, you won't remember the mecha combat, you'll remember how Kirsch showed whether or not she possessed free will.

I recommend Xenosaga.  It was more than I expected.",1352246400,,1551,4.730337078651686
3619623,4,B001GT9DU2,"If you've played the games, then you are familiar with the story. The anime is about as good a representation as you can hope for. The story in the game is pretty complex, and the anime stays pretty true to it. There is a lot of stuff to cover and it is hard to do it in 13 episodes. We do get a little information about Shion's past, and the whole thing with Jr. and Albedo. So the animation explains the basics. I think it should have been longer though. All in all I really like this series. The animation in and voice actors are all good. The soundtrack is good too. The quality of the game is definitely not lost in this animation. Like I said before they should have made it longer, it's an unfinished piece of work. It could have an epic feel like the game did if they made another season. Even as it stands, Xenosaga is a good anime that is worth watching.",1350777600,,864,4.148809523809524
3619624,5,B001GT9DU2,"This is a very well done dramatization of the game...not that the series only encompasses the first of the three games, however it does so faithfully...they even manage to get in most of even the most unbelievable special attacks in a fun scene...I highly recommend this set for fans and newbies alike...",1345852800,,304,4.865384615384615
3619625,4,B001GT9DU2,"If your a fan of the games you will enjoy the anime watching the familiar characters I like the dubbing I am a dubb person I perfer it,  so its rare I ever complaint about it.  Good series having played the games you will enjoy it more.  Art style is diffrent its a good different nice change . For the price I paid 13 bucks its worth it",1344470400,,337,3.926470588235294
3619626,5,B001GT9DU2,"If you have played the games then you know the basic story of this anime.

Compared to the Video Games of the same titles the story seems trimmed down and quit a few things changed.

However as a anime this story is done rather well, the animation seems choppy in some places but it is done rather well as well.

The story moves quickly due to it only being 12 30 min. episodes but you will enjoy it over and over again.

This is a great Sci-fi anime with alot of action.

If you like sci-fi action then this one is for you....",1326844800,7,527,4.077669902912621
3619627,3,B001GT9DU2,"The english dub... sounds good, don't expect to hear the familiar voices tho. Don't expect to hear words pronounced right ie: Woglinde. I miss Albedo's insane laugh lol. Play the game first or you'll never enjoy this anime. seriously.",1320364800,5,234,5.0256410256410255
3619628,4,B001GT9DU2,"The series is good, but it seems like it would have been better at 24 episodes since it's pretty dense and doesn't cover everything in the game.

Note that this only covers the first game in the series.

It's good to have along side the game to help follow along with the extremely dense plot in the game.",1294617600,,305,4.241379310344827
3619629,5,B001GT9DU2,"First off I'm a huge fan of the video game series.  In all the rpg games ive played in my life XENOSAGA is on the list of my favorite games an epic storyline amazing characters beautiful music its a dream.  When I heard they made an animation I was skeptical but once i saw all 12 episodes I was very happy.  The anime follows the game very well unlike most animes ive seen based off video games.  Even the ending is intact.  Some minor difference but nothing severe.  The last anime ive seen based off a game was Star Ocean EX though I liked that series also I was dissapointed in the cheesy action scenes,Xenosaga makes up for that thankfully.  To really apreciate this show you would have to be a fan of the series (which I am) other than that its a good series the voice acting is incredible and the emotion they put in it is authentic the only thing i wasn't crazy about was the opening sequence but no big deal.  If your a fan of the series or just interested in a new series then this is your show hope you enjoy=)",1291075200,,1021,4.173469387755102

This is to save the future as those in the team must relive the past.  Space battles, mecha, androids, cyborgs, and clones are out and about 4000 years after leaving Earth.

Self sacrifice and living for a purpose.

It opens the door to a 2nd season.

I liked it.  Some political maneuvering, some underlying plots, and the characters were developed with enough information throughout the series concerning their past.  Not all the heroes survive, but it gives that much more to the great story.
