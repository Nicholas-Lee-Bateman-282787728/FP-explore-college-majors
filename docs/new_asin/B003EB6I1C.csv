4114003,4,B003EB6I1C,I ordered the video and it was quick delivery. I appreciate the message and the reminders that marriage is important for both people. It is truly life saving. This movie documents the importance of marriage. Specifically in the black american community.,1285113600,,253,5.195121951219512
4114004,5,B003EB6I1C,I really liked this DVD. First off it arrived much faster than the time frame that was listed...thankful for that.  I appreciated the realness felt from each couple and the honesty that was shared.  It is a great tool for encouragement for yourself or any married couple!,1282348800,2,271,4.74468085106383
4114005,4,B003EB6I1C,"I really enjoyed watching You Saved Me with my husband.  We both enjoyed the real-life examples of black couples talk about the challenges and benefits of marriage.  We did feel, however, that the film ran longer than was necessary.  The status of the last featured couple's relationship was confusing and the comments seemed to go on and on- it could have been edited.  That being said, I am pleased that we watched the film and will share it with others.",1281225600,,456,4.6625
4114006,4,B003EB6I1C,"My fiance and I watched this video because things weren't going as smoothly as it should have. This video wasn't a quick fix, but after watching it, it did motivate us to really seek out what our issues are. We each identified with several of the individuals interviewed. I have recommended this to married, engaged, in a relationship to wanna be in a relationship people. This video is so inspiring, and it just reiterates that BLACK LOVE is still alive!",1278979200,8,455,4.7
4114007,5,B003EB6I1C,"My husband and I just finished watching ""You Saved Me""...we were so encouraged! We laughed, cried, cuddled, reminisced and thanked God for all He brought us through. The sentiment behind ""You Saved Me"" saved us from giving up on our marriage. Lamar, Ronnie, Tyler New Media and BMWK bottled that sentiment up with this documentary and sold it for the masses to partake of. You better get you some!",1269993600,8,397,4.768115942028985
4114008,5,B003EB6I1C,"I've been a reader of [...] for sometime, but I wasn't sure what to expect from their latest documentary, You Saved Me. My husband and I both enjoyed watching the movie together.

The movie interviews seven different couples at various points in their marriage along with one widow and several marriage experts; Dr. Shane Perrault from African American Marriage Counselling ([...]), Nisa Muhammad from Wedded Bliss Inc. ([...]), and Dwayne Buckingham author of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Unconditional-Love-What-Every-Woman-and-Man-Desires-in-a-Relationship/dp/1608620638/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Unconditional Love: What Every Woman and Man Desires in a Relationship</a>. All of the couples and experts in the movie are African American. However, this is a movie that all couples should be watching. The movie is interesting viewing to all couples because they discuss topics relevant to anyone who is married.

The movie makes an excellent date night for any couple because it is fun to watch REAL ""reality tv."" The couples interviewed aren't out to become the next reality superstar, these are real couples talking about real issues in marriage. From one year to over fifty years each couple reveals that marriage is work, but in the end, marriage can save each of us because together we are always stronger than we are apart - ""the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.""

Our biggest take away was that both partners should enter marriage as if there is NO plan B!",1269993600,20,1524,5.6173913043478265
