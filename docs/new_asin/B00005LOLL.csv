1623674,5,B00005LOLL,"I LOVE Tracey Nelson, although she's not a big Hollywood name.  The Perfect Nanny is one of my favorite movies featuring Nelson, and is well worth a watch.  The acting is good and overall, it's a good story, although somewhat violent.

The plot thickens when Nelson's unfaithful, controlling husband tries to ""re-enter"" her life, causing her to go somewhat ""amok,"" and eventually she murders him to get the man of ""her dreams,"" a doctor whom she housekeeps for and doubles as nanny for his two children.

If you like Nelson, and a plot that is interesting, The Perfect Nanny is for you.",1229385600,7,586,4.715686274509804
