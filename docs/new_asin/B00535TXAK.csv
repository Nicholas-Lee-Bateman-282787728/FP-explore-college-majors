8455007,5,B00535TXAK,"I watched this because as a Noomi Rapace megafan, I feel the compulsive need to watch all her movies. My only complaint about this particular movie would be ""not enough Noomi"". She's in about half the movie, maybe less. Maybe even just a third. At least it feels that way.

The rest is told in flashbacks as life growing up with an abusive, alcoholic dad. It was pretty poignant, because it seemed like a realistic portrayal. I've known families and parents like that, so that was totally believable. The actress who played a young version of Leena also did a great job. I remember she was also in ""The Girl who Played with Fire"", so it's nice they used the same actress for young Noomi.

One thing about this that felt odd was there was really good chemistry between Noomi Rapace and Ola Rapace. Onscreen, they made a great couple. It's too bad they couldn't work things out in real life, for whatever reason. I just couldn't help thinking about that while watching those scenes. It makes me curious about what happened privately between them, though it's none of our business.

Good acting, somewhat slow story, but worth watching. Recommended.",1512950400,,1146,4.72
