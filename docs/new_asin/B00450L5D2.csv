8416435,5,B00450L5D2,"I think this is probably my favourite video from CVO!  A 75 minute interval work out that will get your heart pumping and help to train your body for all sorts of rides once the snow melts.  While, the workout doesn't simulate riding a century, it does help get a solid ride in for those who might be pressed for time.  This video is most definitely worth adding to your collection!",1416960000,,382,4.352112676056338

8416438,5,B00450L5D2,"This is one of the first cycling videos by Paul Gallas that I purchased.  I had expected it to be a gentle ride through the plains and hills of the upper Midwest based on the landscape covered.  I didn't really pay attention to the title, which you should do.  If you follow the RPM and heart rate guidelines on the dashboard, this is a very intense and satisfying ride.  This one is shorter than the other videos that I have, but none the less it is a well thought out workout.",1351814400,,478,4.21978021978022
8416439,5,B00450L5D2,"I have several of Paul's videos and they are all excellent. This one is short but intense, with a strong, steady pace through rolling hills. The scenery is terrific and so is Paul's narration and coaching. I recommend it without qualification.",1350691200,,243,4.951219512195122
8416440,5,B00450L5D2,"Let me start by saying, I thoroughly enjoyed this ride. But I realize that some folks may puchase a DVD expecting video perfection.  It ain't here.  Some of the scenes are cobbled together from two different rides, one on a rainy day and one on a better day.  So, you're riding down the road and suddenly the scenery changes.  Someimes there are water droplets on the lens and other times it's clear.  It can be a bit startling, even though Paul explains what's going on.

So why, you might ask, did I give it a full 5 stars?  Because none of that matters.  This isn't meant to be a tourism video detailing the finer points of the state of Minnesota that you watch from the comfort of your couch.  It's a real bike ride.  It's meant to provide a productive, stimulating indoor workout, and that's exactly what it is.  It's an hour and 12 minutes of cycling fun.

This video provides a nice feel for riding with a group.  The scenery is beautiful, rain or shine.  The efforts are definately anaerobic, as the title states, but don't let that fool you.  Trying to match the intensity of the ride takes practice, and that practice can be helpful with weight loss and all-around fitness goals as well.  The more you try, the better you get.  The narrative instruction (which you can opt to turn on or off) provides motivation to keep you going.  The on-screen training tools (heart rate, cadence, hill profile, etc) give you all the necessary information you need to try to match the workout.  The hour and 12 minute length makes the whole ride very do-able in one session.

A great, self-contained workout on one disk for an affordable price!  I highly recommend the Minnesota Rollers.  It's become an important part of my indoor cycling video library.",1329264000,,1749,4.592233009708738
