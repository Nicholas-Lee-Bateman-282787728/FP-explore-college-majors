Too much input ! Plan on screening this in short doses and repeat as necessary. Still, MUCH better than trying to understand the rules by simply reading them. Happy sailing !",1202860800,,339,4.396825396825397
8358035,3,B000FUIUF2,"David Dellenbaugh explains all the rules of part 2 one by one. He explain the definitions as it is used in the book.

The explanation is good with a good level of detail. There are also some basic graphics too.

I got disappointed by the on-water images. They did not bring anything new and I think they repeat a lot.

So, this product is not a DVD. It is more like a listening book on TV.",1181952000,2,389,4.092105263157895
8358036,4,B000FUIUF2,"This is a very comprehensive explanation of the racing rules. Black and white, nuts and bolts, classroom style. This is not entertainment, but rather designed for those sailors who would prefer a more visual presentation of the rules over reading the rule book. - Craig Leweck, Scuttlebutt",1151020800,5,289,5.170212765957447
