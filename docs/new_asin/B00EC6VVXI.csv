5901514,5,B00EC6VVXI,We loved this All Star Comedy Jam! Red Grant and Finesse Mitchell cracked me up to the point of tears. I didn't much care for the lady comic. She wasn't all that funny. We had this recorded on DVR but had to get a new box and lost it... I got right on here and ordered it. Too funny!,1394582400,,283,3.8135593220338984

5901517,2,B00EC6VVXI,"I have always liked Faison Love. He's a clown! But, I don't think that stand-up comedy is for him. And I have never heard of any of the other comedians, who were more pathetic than Faison Love. So how can the other comedians be stars if they have no talent, and no one have ever heard of them? I have 3 other All Star Comedy Jams, not including Gary Owens as host of a comedy jam. The ones with Monique, DL Hughley, and Cedric the Entertainer. Those were great, except for Monique's jam, which I did not think was a great!",1393891200,2,522,4.178217821782178

5901526,5,B00EC6VVXI,"I don't care what anyone says. This was soooo funny. All of the comedians made me laugh hard. The woman wasn't too funny. She only had one funny moment for me but that's okay, her time was short. All of the other comedians had some good stand up. I laughed more than I've laughed in a very long time. I lost my DVD, but it was so funny I ordered another one so my man can watch it and laugh as hard as I did. I love to laugh and this definitely did the job. I think it's worth it if you want a good laugh. My dimples were deeper after watching this.",1414972800,,549,3.8672566371681416
