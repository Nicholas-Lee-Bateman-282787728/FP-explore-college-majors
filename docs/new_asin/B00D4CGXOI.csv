8589526,2,B00D4CGXOI,"eagerly awaited, the first video was fantastic - a cultural glimpse into a seedy underworld of chick fights, booze and metal.  The Second?  well, it's like the second time you have sex with a trailer shaking slut.  the first time is a HUGE load,  the second is a dribble.

THis was an okay video,  but I felt raped.  I was expecting the brilliance of the first,  the Boone Brothers are hilarious.  But this video?  (which I would STILL buy again) was a bit of a letdown.  Great special effects, it seems they blew their budget on the opening scene.

The sad story about sequels not exactly living up to the original?  yeah  -  Next round?  more chicks.  more fights, more silliness.  You need help?  we know some guys in San Jose who can add 'local color"" for ya....",1410393600,,766,4.420289855072464
8589527,1,B00D4CGXOI,I LOVED brawlin broads 1. I have been anticipating this one for a few years. This one sux! We were sooo disappointed. Even the guys talking weren't funny this time. Don't waste your money!!!,1373846400,2,190,4.617647058823529
