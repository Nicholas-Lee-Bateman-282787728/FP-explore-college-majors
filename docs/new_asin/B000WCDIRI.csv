8222469,5,B000WCDIRI,"This is a fun set of explicit erotic vignettes, each of which includes a black woman.  There's sort of an espionage theme here.  When one of the women rolls around on top of a table, touching herself, she also uses a pistol with a silencer as a prop (*CAUTION: This violates several firearms safety rules!*); a pair of women in the next scene are laying on a bed with a tray of sparkling jewelry between them.  One could hardly call it a plot, but it is a nice, subtle theme.

The actors are all professionals, attractive and capable.  There's an MMF threesome, solo sex on top of a table, and a lesbian encounter on a bed.  This is neither all-inclusive nor gonzo, but the actors look good, and they don't look unhappy to be together.

The sound is dominated by a porn soundtrack, with most of the verbal responses, grunting, and slapping of flesh-on-flesh subdued.  This isn't a great soundtrack, but it isn't obnoxious, either.  Visually, there's a softness to the camera work, including low lighting.

Extras?  There are two: a ten-minute collection of deleted scenes (cuts to fit the necessary length and a couple of 'prep' shots rather than gaffes) and a

This is an unusual bit of porn.  It's hardly softcore; you'll see penetration, clear shots of oral sex, and even ejaculation, but it's a departure from much of what's out there for hard-core sex movies.  You won't see gallons of fluid spraying everywhere, and the lack of dialogue is both a sign that it's porn (""No plot?"") and a sign of its difference, as there's a very limited script of ""Oh yeah"" and ""Harder!""  The sex tends to be gentler.  Not that there isn't a fair amount of hard thrusting, but there's much less of an impression of an actor dragging an actress into position for the next sex act.  Combined with the lighting, it makes the scenes seem much less clinical and harsh, and more romantic.

Altogether, a fun and gentle porn movie.",1303516800,2,1912,4.623145400593472
