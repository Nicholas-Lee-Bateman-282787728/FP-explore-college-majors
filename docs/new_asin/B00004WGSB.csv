1364540,5,B00004WGSB,"""The Awful Truth"" is Michael Moore's unofficial follow-up to the groundbreaking ""TV Nation"" show that ran in 1995 and 1996.  Available only on Bravo for Yankees and on Channel 4 in Merry Olde England, this DVD set will satisfy any fan wanting more of Moore.
This first season was 12-30 minute shows, with Michael taking on people like Humana Insurance, who ""decided it was cheaper to kill people than to heal them,"" the Swiss Banks (he dressed a guy up as Hitler to withdraw the Nazi gold taken from the teeth of Jews), the ""Teenaged Sniper School,"" where he teaches kids how to kill better in school-shooting situations, and more.  A progressive television show is refreshing enough, but when you put a satirist like Moore at the controls, who knows what is going to happen - except that it is funny, depressing, maddening, and educational all at the same time.
His techniques are about as subtle as a brick through the window, but let's face it, Americans need more bricks, because there are too damn many ""awful truths"" out there right now.  There are too many companies that think they can get away with murder, too many politicians that think they can play us like harps.  Without people like Michael Moore and shows like ""The Awful Truth,"" they just might get away clean.
I can wholeheartedly recommend the first season of ""The Awful Truth"" to anyone who wants to learn about what is really going on in the US today.",972172800,62,1422,4.676
1364541,5,B00004WGSB,"All of Michael Moore's work (TV Nation, The Big One, Canadian Bacon, Roger & Me, and his book, Downsize This) are amazing works by today's premiere comedic cynic. Moore cuts through to the truth on big business and THE AWFUL TRUTH, his new show on BRAVO is a continuation on this standard.  I've seen the entire first season of THE AWFUL TRUTH (I taped them all), but I'm also buying this DVD, because this stuff is hilarious.  However, I would have to rate THE AWFUL TRUTH below TV NATION, as that show was longer, had higher production values, and was a little more biting in some of its satire. I really hope they put that show on DVD!  But, for any Michael Moore fan, you must buy this DVD! The Awful Truth is a great show, and it just finished its 2nd season, which hopefully will also make it to DVD. For now, just buy this one. If you haven't seen the show, but know Michael Moore's work (especially if you like TV NATION), you will definitely enjoy this. For [the money], the whole season (almost 300 minutes) is worth it.",969926400,19,1030,4.382198952879581
1364542,5,B00004WGSB,"Moore is a hilarious and thoughtful media renegade. Both of his movies (Roger and Me and The Big One) as well as his first show on NBC (TV Nation)  and the Awful Truth are funny, entertaining and poignant for anyone that is  concerned with the state of the union.",967766400,5,263,4.346938775510204
1364543,4,B00004WGSB,"I caught a few episodes of The Awful Truth on the tele and must say it is a pretty mixed bag.  I liked the episode on guns, where Moore went to the NRA with his new idea for a mascot, a walking talking gun.  Needless to say they wanted no part of it, but it was much more to the point than was ""Eddie the Eagle,"" or whatever the NRA calls its stuffed bird which tries to warn tots of the dangers of guns while at the same time it fights any and all legislation on the hill to combat the proliferation of handguns.  But, at other times Moore sounds pretty sanctimonious, such as when he is wheeling through New York in his rented Taxi refusing to pick up white folks. In other words it is the Michael Moore many have grown to love, not afraid to take on the big boys, and at the same time pointing out the many inherent weaknesses in our society.",1084579200,4,845,4.078313253012048
1364544,5,B00004WGSB,"Michael Moore is one of the few journalists out there who understands and acts on the need to present the story as it stands, regardless of the consquences. He refuses to sell his soul in order to satisfy media magnates, and this means we get a combination of (a) the hidden reality behind the big media stories, and (b) a rather irreverent look at the way many large US corporations operate. Both of these are tackled in humourous ways (Crackers the Corporate Crime-Fighting Chicken taking on Disney was an absolute classic), but can also be alarmingly sober (e.g. cold-hearted insurance company refusing to pay out to save a client's life). The Awful Truth is thus social conscience as well as great entertainment.
We need Michael Moore - he helps to keep things honest. If he does something you disagree with (e.g. anti-war speech at the Oscars), just put your prejudice on the back-burner for a minute and think about the issue from another angle. As the great Canadian singer-songwriter Bruce Cockburn said (in 'Maybe The Poet'), ""...maybe you will not agree, but you need him to show you new ways to see."" This is, after all, the essence of free speech.",1073260800,10,1159,4.7711442786069655
1364545,5,B00004WGSB,"I would have to say that the recommendation or the lack thereof from the states of California and Ohio on March 26th. of this year sold me on buying this first season of Michael Moore's show. When a product such as Mr. Moore's gets that much negative review from the conservatives of the country it has to be very worthwhile. Incidentally, I'm one of the few who applauded his honesty at the Academy Awards (Just where are all those WMD's that the president and his advisers swear are in Iraq? Wasn't that what the president's war was all about?) Mr. Moore reminds me of the great political sage/cartoonist Walt Kelly, who, during the Vietnam War era of Dick Nixon, placed in the mouth of his cartoon character, Pogo, the profound proclamation, ""We have met the enemy and he is us!"" Mr. Moore's style reminds me of one of the sayings of the great comedian, W.C. Fields, who once said, ""There comes a time in a young man's life when he must take the bull by the tail and face the situation."" Thanks Mike.",1051401600,15,1003,4.4863387978142075
1364546,5,B00004WGSB,"Many thanks to the ""reviewer"" who, like all of the flag-waving, jingoistic fascists demands that we supress any dissent and has the audacity to decide what's ""right"" or ""wrong"" or ""correct"" expression. I count myself among those who love the America our founding fathers envisioned, not the America of McCarthy and Nixon. The McNixons want us all to shut up and tell us what to do, or say, or buy if we ""love America"". Well, I love America so much I'm buying Michael Moore's work; and I'm STAYING in America and fighting for America and it's flag, despite what the counter-revolutionary Stalinistas want - a silent, compliant, slave-state.",1049328000,62,639,4.925925925925926
1364547,1,B00004WGSB,"After less than an hour I had to stop watching this diatribe.
Moore does little but play the loud-mouth obnoxious bull who you just agree with to get him out of your china shop.
He rants..and rants, but really does little but pander to the extreme liberal left.
Though some of the wrongs that needed righted were a very serious commentary on what needs fixed in this country, Moore's way of handling it is silly and immature.
I have to wonder how much he cares about the ""causes"" he takes on as opposed to the [money] he'll see from the selling of it.
Do I agree with some of the causes?  Yes
Do I agree with Moore on his way of handling it? No",1048636800,30,644,4.193548387096774
1364548,5,B00004WGSB,"If you have never seen any episodes of THE AWFUL TRUTH, here is the basic premise:  Michael Moore, the documentary filmmaker on wheels, spends a half hour showing you (and a studio audience)segments where he and his intrepid band of associates travel all over the country, attempting to right wrongs...or at the very least shine the blinding light of factual truth into some very dark corners (health insurance loopholes, police force admission requirements, the notorious Fred Phelps of Topeka, KS who demonstrates at funerals of people who have died of AIDS, etc.).  A lot of fact finding and a little tongue-in-cheek humor make this an entertaining--and insightful--series to watch for yourself...and then show to your friends!!!

1364549,5,B00004WGSB,"Michael Moore is sort of a hero of mine. He takes on causes that are impossible, and gets results. The way does it is shocking (and often very funny), but for one reason or another it works. The Awful Truth shows him taking on these causes, and keeping big corperations honest. It urges you to become more active in the political world around you, and helps you to realize that what this country needs is less political apathy, and more political awareness. Michael Moore is a Genius, and seeing this helps you understand why.",1043107200,,526,4.6063829787234045
1364550,4,B00004WGSB,"Michael more is a brilliant crusader.  This is an amazing hyperbole to make a point about the Awful Truths that make up many of the issues that are pressing in the United States today.  This man takes no prisoners; he never gives up.  He will attack any corporation that he feels has wronged its consumers, the environment, or the work force they exploit.
In the first episode, he takes down an HMO by staging a funeral of someone who was dying as a result of a claim denial.  He attacks people who are against gay rights.  He attacks the Disney for the treatment of employees around the world and in the Magic Kingdom itself.  There is no stopping him.  He uses so many incredibly over the top methods to make his points (hence the hyperbole).  Christmas carolers with voice boxes from smoking related illness, storm Phillip Morris and a few other tobacco giants.  What a trip.
Have no misconception of this man; He is a bleeding heart liberal.  If you do not like that sort of politics, do not buy this.  It is not for you.  This is defiantly something that should be known before you even consider looking at it.
For any bleeding heart liberals out there, this is great.  It makes you feel good that the little man can take something back for once.  If you like this, you would like Michael Moores other works.  They are nice because they are more focused and can spend more time on an issue.  That is my only real issue with the show.  It is too quick.  A lot has to be said in a little time.  But, it is to the point, therefore, it is pretty good.  It is well worth the money.  I am happy with it.

1364551,5,B00004WGSB,"If you like Moore's work at all, get this set of DVDs. The funeral at an HMO was great. Watch Michael frustrate and harrass greedy corprate types, politicians and more.  Some of the segmants fell flat but most delivered.",1022803200,3,220,4.641025641025641
1364552,5,B00004WGSB,"If you're a Michael Moore fan, this is essential for you. Roger & Me should probably be the first thing you see, but after that the best thing I think would be the first season of the Awful Truth. Moore goes after all the targets you thought needed to be attacked, and a few you wouldn't have thought of. (Who outside of Ohio had heard of that chicken coop with 11 million birds?) If you're liberal at all, you'll have a ton of fun seeing Moore heading into corporate headquarters and demanding a change (his specialty) and, surprisingly, getting his way a lot of times, going after those pesky Clinton impeachment folk, and otherwise trying to give the working man his fair share. You'll be a better person having seen it.",1017100800,8,723,4.526717557251908
1364553,5,B00004WGSB,"Michael Moore is a rogue journalist who unapologetically states what many people are thinking, but don't have the guts to verbalize. He's like Penn and Teller, the magic comedy duo that deconstruct magic tricks and expose how they're done; only instead of showing you how the rabbit gets in the hat, he exposes the hypocrisies of major industries, companies, and people who desperately want to save face while hiding their true motives. These people want you to either stay ignorant of their doings, or simply remain apathetic to them. Moore isn't afraid to hold a mirror up to their faces and show them the ""warts"" they so desperately try to hide, while making you laugh in the process.
Moore reminds me a little of a smarter but less charismatic Abbie Hoffman, without the baggage or controversy. The difference is that in the 60's, most people had a grasp of the hypocrisies and controversies Hoffman highlighted. Nowadays, it's a struggle to get people to even care what those controversies are. Thus, Moore's goals aren't as lofty as Hoffman's, but he uses similar guerilla theatre tactics. Hoffman demonstrated the Greed of the 60's by throwing money onto the New York Stock Exchange floor and watching the traders scramble on top of each other to grab it. Moore shows the greed of our time by getting a group of cancer stricken former smokers to sing Christmas carols to Tobacco companies through their mechanical voice boxes. Moore uses the same style of shock theatre to bring out into the open modern travesties, and exposes the recipient's hypocrisies. Moore uses guerilla tactics because he knows that if he does so, the perpetrator can't hide behind spin and his PR people. In this compilation, he is almost always successful, and the result is almost always humorous.
Moore is chubby and frumpy (sorry, Mike if you ever read this- do you think if you looked like Brad Pitt it would help your cause?), but this allows the focus to be his message instead of his pecks and sexy smile. This lets him appeal to the common man, who is his target audience anyway! Since this is guerilla theatre in documentary form made for a T.V. show, you can't expect the quality to be the best. The production isn't the slickest- it was made for the Bravo network, and if you're familiar with this network, it isn't exactly in the upper echelon of cable channel cash cows! That the show had a shoestring budget might be an understatement. But as above, the quality is not the point- it's the message, and on that point, Moore hits home runs on almost every account.
I think that many of Michael Moore's critics misinterpret the concept of ""nonpartisan"". That doesn't mean it's free of politics or opinions. The definition of nonpartisan that is being used is that of political party affiliations. He is definitely not a spokesman for the Democratic Party or its agenda (in present form anyway). Where many people get confused is how he chooses his ""victims"". He chooses to pick on the hypocrisies of Corporations and the rich- the fact that those groups are usually ""Republican"" or ""conservative"" is not his fault. In fact, it's secondary to his purpose; the fact that they are abusing their power is what Moore is concerned with. Besides, as shown by Enron, when it comes to politics, corporate ties are more often in the right than the left (if you go by campaign contributions, 3/4ths more!) Admittedly, Moore is a self-avowed left leaner. But if you familiarize yourself with some of his other work, he's definitely not a Democrat- he criticizes them just as much, albeit for different reasons. In fact, he supported Nader during the election, even though Nader fired him a decade ago!
Despite what his critics desire to portray him as, Moore is simply an equal opportunity offender, exposing hypocrisies wherever he sees them. For instance, Disney can hardly be considered a radical right wing organization (note their track record on gays and demonizing by conservative Christian groups), and yet the Big Mouse is the butt of one of his stunts. He simply wants to show the world how corporations and people in power simultaneously abuse their power while desperately trying to convince the common guy, you and me, that he has our best interests at hand. Moore simply wants to show us what's really going on, and does a bang up job in this compilation of the Awful Truth, as well as the rest of his work. Keep it up, Mikey!",1015372800,11,4422,4.796854521625164
1364554,5,B00004WGSB,"My only disappointment with The Awful Truth is that there aren't more (or should that be Moore?) episodes available for me to watch. Come on Bravo. Another series, please?
Each week's show was a new delight and poked good old American fun at the Corporations which rule over the rest of us like contemporary Feudal Lords.
How can you not love a crime-fighting chicken that discovers the ""awful truth"" about his old buddy, Mickey Mouse? How can it not be entertaining to find out that ""the rich"" don't know the first thing about repairing a dsyfunctional toilet or can't even remember their zip code?
There were so many good bits in the series that I can't remember them all. I do recall being doubled up on the couch though, my stomach hurting from laughing so hard. Now this is what I call entertainment!!!

1364556,3,B00004WGSB,"Michael Moore can be very funny.  Some of the brilliant bits in this DVD set are, e.g., the ""witch hunt"" segment, the ""I need a pancreas"" segment, the ""beat the rich"" segment, the ""voice box choir"" segment, and a few others.  Many of the other segments are misfires--some like the one with Hitler in Zurich or the Debt Collector are simply embarrassingly bad.
I don't have cable, so I will wait for the next season to come out on DVD, but I hope the ""quality assurance standards"" go up a bit.  Some serious re-examination needs to be done.  Things need to be thought out a bit more.  I get the feeling Michael Moore prefers to improvise, but with a little preparation (or perhaps some better editing) the show could be a lot better.  I fondly remember the consistent quality of TV Nation.  What happened?",983404800,9,804,4.541666666666667
1364557,4,B00004WGSB,"... otherwise, you'll ruin the series. For those who know Moore's style, this is more of the same Michael Moore. It's just the situations that are different. Moore is a genius indeed for satirizing things that desperately need to be satirized. My advice, however, is to make sure not to watch the whole thing all at once. It becomes a bit tiring to watch the same joke played on different situations over and over again. In that respect, the show is like watching a bunch of Scooby Doo episodes: same plot, different mystery. In the meantime, Moore shows one of the great things about America in that he does a great job in expressing his First Amendment rights. To him, I say, keep going! Bravo!",980294400,6,696,4.576

After a typical frazzling Friday of high-school English teaching, I arrived home to find the three-videocassette box of THE AWFUL TRUTH's first series finally had arrived. I binged, and I watched all five hours in a single sitting.
I loved every minute of the series. Moore speaks truth to power, and let's get off this left/right political stuff: there are people for the little guys and people for the giants (I call them ""Goliathans""). Moore consistently is on the side of the little guy, of the downtrodden, of the oppressed. Ever hear of the fellow called Jesus? (Lived a few years ago.) He was pretty much in the same ballpark, and he liked to speak truth to power, too.
We all know what happens next: Jesus gets crucified, and the corporation co-opts the radicals.

7925273,4,B00004WGSB,"I had never heard of this series before and, being a fan of Michael Moore, I decided to buy this earlier this year.

If I could rate each disc, I'd give the first disc 5 stars and the second 4 stars.

There are many memorable and bizarre moments in the series, and some of the skits are so simple and effective that I kept saying, ""why didn't I think of that?"".  As you'd expect, the first season is overflowing with the populist, blunt, political and social satire that has made Michael Moore famous.

If it weren't for some of the distasteful skits, such as ""Teen Sniper School"" (not funny), I'd give this five stars, as it's otherwise a low-budget, but very straightforward and eye-opening series.  I recommend this set to fans of Michael Moore or people looking for some good and funny exposs on corporate America.",1197504000,,818,4.575342465753424

I knew he was a reactionary dribbler before I watched the tape but I thought it might be entertaining anyway. Too bad it was just sad. I only liked the first two episodes because he actually attempted to help people (the guy who needed an organ transplant, and the guy who was layed off,) but otherwise it was uninteresting and unfunny. His early episodes attempt to deal with issues which are mildy interesting (tobacco industry, homophobia... same old same old, but still noble) but in later episodes it becomes more about just lampooning the ""bad people"" (aka rich people) and not actually doing anything proactive. This would be fine if he were actually funny, but he's not, and his comedy bits sound more and more like leftist diatribe as the show goes on... And no, I'm not a republican, but I know garbage when I see it (GIGO.)",1100390400,7,1024,4.726256983240224
