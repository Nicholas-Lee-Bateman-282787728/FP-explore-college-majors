8259529,1,B000E1ERDQ,"This film is absolutely one of the worst I have ever watched. It was so strange,disturbing and sick that I sped through it in a forth of the time. If you are looking for a classic or even fair vampire film this isn't it and it should not be classified as such. Please consider carefully before renting this one.",1360281600,,311,4.288135593220339
8259530,2,B000E1ERDQ,"Quality is dire compared to the German DVD (Mosquito der Schnder), which includes the English and German audio tracks.

Spec says it included a trailer which it doesn't - it's simply an overlong promo reel of some sort. Best avoided.",1332720000,,233,4.825
8259531,5,B000E1ERDQ,"This Film is an excellent first class example of a very actual international every day occurence of an Underdog within a minority group (Werner Pochath),being mobbed on a daily basis whilst working in his office as a simple clerk ! WHY ? just because he is deaf & dumb ! This very direct & realistic psycho- analitical approach in the form of this ""Psychogram"" of this poor underprivelidged person by the Yugoslavian film director Marijan Vajda,broke a Tabu in the early 70's,namely ""mobbing"",not just ""bullying"" which takes place in the school classrooms,& playgrounds,but taken to an extreme degree in the work places of everyday life. This unfortunate fact was successfully ignored up untill fairly recently. It was a world-wide embarrassment. Hence it remained a Tabu,considered quite rightly as a ""declaration of bankruptcy of modern day behaviourism & Civilized attitudes within a so called Christian upbringing.""-Vajda hit the nail on the head by showing the ""Course & Effect"".How & Why he became what he was,eg.underprivelidged,simply structured,of limited intelligence, violent working class prolertaric background of extreme frustration,without love & nest warmth,which is still today widely spread !-Special mention should be made of the fine acting of the Austrian Actress,the late Ellen Umlauf(in real life an aristocratic Countess)& of course the late Werner Pochath a brilliant German Actor,who died young,unfortunately not so well known outside the german speaking territory. Portraying the role of a deaf mute(devoid of speech as in the early days of Silent Movies of for example Charlie Chaplin),demands a very special talent,in which he executed in a subtle yet virtuosic fashion. Only 3 actors of such admirable ability come to mind today who could have possibly equally fullfilled this very difficult role, being the american Dustin Hoffman (of Rainman,& his exellent role as Shylock in Shakespears Merchant of Venice on the stage in London.)The welshman,Sir Anthony Hopkins (of Hannibal fame. By the way for the record,Bloodlust was made long before Hannibal!)& not forgetting Sir Christopher Lee of Dracular fame etc.and it must be specially mentioned the very unorthodox psychological use of the excellent music underlining & supporting the Apocalyptic pure Horror of this true story,with very unusual orchestration eg.singing saw solo & with orchestra,composed by the welsh composer Dafydd Llywelyn,living in Munich where the film was shot. He was known for his exceptional scoring of such German Cult Films of the 60's & 70's, as ""Lenz, "" ""Kuckucksjahre,""""Liebe & so Weiter,""directed by the American George Moorse.etc etc. He now no longer composes for Film & TV with very few exceptions,as he was under tremendous pressure from leading international classical musicians to dedicate his time exclusively to compose music for posterity. His music is mainly composed for,& performed by Soviet Russian,German,Israeli,Georgian,Turkish musicins & Pianists such as Boris Berezovsky,Severin von Eckardstein,Amir Katz,Dudana Mazmanishvili,Nino Gurevic,& the genial Turkish Iconic Grand Dame of the Piano World, Idil Biret. They have performed his works eg:""Time Quake"",""Fantasia Apoplectica-Off the Devils Spoon"",""Arch-Angel Gabriel"", at the Hercules Saal Munich,Berlin Philharmonic Hall. Musikvereins Saal Vienna,Sale Cortot Paris, Carnegie Hall New York,Washington, London,etc to name a few. All live Radio or TV Broadcasts,receiving standing ovations.-Quite a major loss to the world of European Cinema &TV,for without this outstanding music with very limited dialogue,this film would be unthinkable,it fitted perfectly hand in glove,& twice as much Music as in normal Dialogue length Films. Perfect inspired teamwork at the highest level,totally missunderstood at the time of shooting, but now the film is deservedly available on DVD in various languages,will no doubt reach a wider & more appreciative international Audience. Bravo ! Da Capo.- G.D.de St. Germain. (Paris,France)on travels in Germany.",1286582400,5,4023,5.729096989966555
8259532,1,B000E1ERDQ,"The two other reviews must be for other movies, as this one comes nowhere near anything they are talking about.  The main character is deaf and mute so 90% of the movie lacks dialogue. I understand the era in which this movie comes from, but there is still no excuse for this film. I actually feel bad for the 1hr 30 minutes of my life I lost to this boring production. Stay away, far,far away.",1270944000,,394,4.253333333333333
8259533,5,B000E1ERDQ,"Totally screwed up and fun movie! The girl is beautiful and reveals herself quite a bit - typical of good horror films!  Definitely worth the price.
