8592451,4,B000VD5HN6,"if you are jewish or know anyone who is jewish - you have been through or heard about the ""bar / bat mitzvah"".

for those unaware, in judaism this is when a young person officially becomes an adult.  there is a big celebration,  before the celebration there is a ceremony that takes months (posisbly longer) of preparation.

both funny and touching, it takes you into the story of one boy's journey to ""adulthood""  and - as with any situation - the basic reasoning gets lost and something that should be simple and meaningful becomes more of an ordeal.

 i enjoyed the film.",1222992000,,574,4.568627450980392
