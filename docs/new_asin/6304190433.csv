7864229,4,6304190433,"To my surprise, ""Bad Blood"" is not only one of Lorenzo Lamas' best vehicles, it's also a pretty powerful entry to the DTV karate-action scene of the 90s in general, up there with the best work of Jeff Wincott. Journeyman filmmaker Tibor Takacs (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Gate/dp/B002I41KNC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Gate</a>) seems to have been pushed into the genre by accident, but he makes the most of his directorial talents to craft a very adrenalizing flick, setting Lamas to the top of his game as an action hero. It's got some pretty goofy parts and obviously won't appeal to people who are in it for the drama and clever writing, but action fans who know what they like ought to have a great time with this one.

The story: an ex-cop (Lamas) comes to the defense of his brother (Hank Cheyne, ""Sunset Beach""), under fire from an underworld mercenary group for embezzling money from them.

Part of the movie's strength as an action feature is its relatively short runtime: at under 90 minutes, it keeps a good pace of things and you never have to wait around too long for an action scene to occur. Even if you did, they're generally worth waiting for. I think that Lorenzo reached his peak as an onscreen martial arts in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bounty-Tracker/dp/078200167X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bounty Tracker</a>, but he's definitely close to that standard here. It's clear that much effort was put into the five fight scenes. Lamas enjoys a well-shot showdown with lead villain Joe Son (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shootfighter-2/dp/6304109350/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shootfighter 2</a>), a decent brawl against superkicker Simon Rhee (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Best-of-the-Best/dp/B0002O7XUE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Best of the Best</a>), and a stickfight with an uncredited Robert Chapin (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ring-of-Steel/dp/B00004TITL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ring of Steel</a>) that's much better than it has any right to be. What's more, the shootouts aren't bad at all, either, and culminate in a John Woo-inspired gunfight in a junkyard. Entertainingly, the filmmakers often choose to highlight the athleticism of Lamas' character via incredibly unrealistic jumps; they're fun to watch, but more fantastical than anything most Hong Kong directors would consider putting in a movie.

The movie definitely has a sadistic side that's harder to swallow, though. Early on, a family is massacred, and inappropriately silly music plays over a shot of their corpses. Later, a thug played by Chuck Zito (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Homefront/dp/B00HEPC0TS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Homefront</a>) beats a man to death with a hammer. Less blatantly vicious but endlessly creepy is bad guy Joe Son's performance: he shows that he had potential as an actor beyond the ""karate man"" image, but if you know about his real-life criminal background, then the scenes wherein he threatens and molests women are pretty uncomfortable. Less jarring qualms include some missed opportunities of characterization (e.g. what's up with Lorenzo's playing cards?) and the fact that for all its adrenaline, the movie doesn't really invest viewers in any of its stars. Lamas & co. are cool, but there's no way I'd rate the movie this highly if it weren't for the strength of the action content.

In short, if you want good action and you want it from Lorezno Lamas, this tape is a great investment. If you want anything else, go fight it in another movie. Lamas fans should definitely own it.",1405814400,,3775,6.024208566108007

7864231,5,6304190433,"With our constant devotion to 90's B action rolling on we have decided to give Lorenzo Lamas a shot at the crown. It's quite incredible that despite knowing about the pony-tailed warrior named Lorenzo Lamas, we have never watched any of his films. Just at a quick glance you can see this man is oozing with B potential. After the final credits started to roll we could do nothing but applaud at the mind numbing B goodness we were just subjected to. Bad Blood has everything one could ever hope for in a 90's B action, including plenty of nude scenes which a young Sid sought after. You could tell Lamas was very focused in this role due to the disappointment he faced in 1992 while casting for the film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Ring/dp/B00069QD74/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Ring</a>. He was 99% assured the role for John Blackwell and was said to really be getting into character, until the rug was pulled from underneath his feet. The director decided to go with the legendary Don Swayze instead infuriating Lorenzo. Bad Blood was allegedly fueled by this situation. Lamas and Swayze still have not spoken to this day.

Despite being dropped from Death Ring, Lorenzo proved why he is such an action powerhouse playing an outlaw ex-cop named Travis Blackstone. Travis has a tender heart for his deadbeat brother who is in constant trouble. Wow this sounds like the exact script for EVERY other 90's action B. Travis even lost his job as a cop by destroying evidence against his brother, sparing him from a life in Treadmore. After Travis did time for his cover up he humbly began a career as a truck driver living out of a trailer. Naturally when his brother is in debt to a Chinese run gang for $5 million Travis must put his ponytail and abs of steel to work. Travis breaks out the most hilarious martial arts that one could ever be subjected to. He roundhouse kicks every enemy into submission with ease while never messing up his hair. In between kicking in skulls were are subjected to uncomfortable soft core action devoting most of the camera to a bare a**ed Lamas. Obviously this was done by his request. In the end you know Lamas was the victor and single handedly dismantled the crew of killers.

Bad Blood is an action film that keeps pace with some of the best on the market. This film has now launched a new focus as Sid must be involved with the Lorenzo Lamas movement of the 90's. Thankfully he pumped out so much junk we seem to have more then enough to riffle through. The great thing about Lorenzo Lamas is you feel like you're watching an action Yanni whose one step away from working in porno movies. This guy is the poster boy for unintentional comedy and has the arrogance of a Charlie with a few bucks in his pocket. Despite his best efforts he deservingly lost our to Don Swayze for the role of John Blackwell, but easily could have earned himself a spot as the tattoo shop owner. The man exudes toughness that could only be topped by the like of Chad Mcqueen. The one surprising factor here was the lack of a DMF. Usually these movies are jam packet with it. This however could be overlooked by the sheer excess of ponytail action that most simply could not handle.",1333238400,,3253,4.695271453590193
7864232,5,6304190433,"HOLY MOLY! Viper AKA Bad Blood! is only the best ever! Holy, I saw it last night and BAM!! I was struck by a true diamond, a diamond in the rough of course! Just look at the cover: a guy with huge muscles and a gun with ""BAD BLOOD"" words written in letters that have been smashed or shot maybe! The whole film is like the most amazing ever, but there is no beating the final scene where a huge gold eagle swoops down and steals the gun from the gangster Tony ""Souce Mes Boules"" Panapizzah (I think! I can't hear my TV sometimes!...) and lets the blond girl Cherry get off the cruise ship alive. PARENTS: Not good for kids because it has lots of people snorting coke! So watch out and watch this because it is coming to a VCR near you! To quote Viper himself, ""This..."" movie ""..isn't over till its over!"" and when its over push rewind again until your VCR is no longer an operational machine! Ah-woo!...",1041552000,,903,4.255813953488372
