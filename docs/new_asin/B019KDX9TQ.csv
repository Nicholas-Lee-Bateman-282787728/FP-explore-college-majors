8745432,3,B019KDX9TQ,"I have seen Yamishibai seasons 1-3 and enjoyed most of seasons one and two. Three was just alright. I was hesistant to buy the Blu-ray version of this show because these short-format animes are such obvious cash grabs. This ""box set"" proves my point. each season is crammed on a single disc and the audio and video quality suffer for it. The video shows very visible pixelation and the audio seems low and lacking detail. The previews for other Sentai shows (contained on these discs) were loud, bright, and visually perfect, so I know that higher fidelity can be had with DVD. I watched a 80s/90s b-movie afterwards (Dark Angel/I Come in Peace), and was amazed with its level of detail. If anything the low quality of these DVDs will make you appreciate other movies you own that were made by companies who actually tried.",1499472000,,823,4.682758620689655
8745433,5,B019KDX9TQ,Season 1 AND 2??!! YES.,1490227200,,23,3.8
8745434,4,B019KDX9TQ,"Came fast and in perfect condition. This is my favorite show ever and watch it repeatedly on crunchyroll. I was so surprised and excited to see there was this DVD. I wish it had season 3 but i guess that will br combined with season 4 coming up.

1 thing i didn't like is the slight change in narration and the menu is weird...but whatever. It plays on my japanese ps4 so that's a plus!",1481587200,2,386,4.1466666666666665
8745435,5,B019KDX9TQ,Was exactly what was asked for. Perfect gift!,1462924800,,45,4.75
8745436,4,B019KDX9TQ,"Loved this series.  It's not scary by Western standards, but it's a glimpse into the folklore of Japanese society.  Each episode is under five minutes long, and it's told like a story book, but it was a very satisfying series.",1461628800,2,226,4.625
8745437,3,B019KDX9TQ,"I watched the first 5 episodes and really tried to like it as Im a huge Jhorror fan and Nihongo student. Ainiku ... I was disappointed in the anemic story lines. Maybe a child would be more impressed. You're better off watching ""Tamami""",1461196800,2,236,4.511627906976744
