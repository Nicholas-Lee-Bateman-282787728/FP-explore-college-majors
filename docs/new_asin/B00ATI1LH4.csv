5509455,5,B00ATI1LH4,"I do love Daniel Tosh's skewed humor!  ""Oh no he didn't"" is frequently uttered while watching his show.  But I can't stop watching!  I came to Tosh. 0 in 2012 so it's kinda cool to see these early shows and how the program has evolved.  Good stuff!",1395705600,,248,4.212765957446808
5509456,4,B00ATI1LH4,"This mixed season DVD offers a lot of laughs. However, it seems like Tosh hasn't quite caught lightening in a bottle here like he did with the first and second installments. This product is worth seeing just not the 1-2 punch I was hoping for.",1371600000,4,243,4.4222222222222225

5509458,4,B00ATI1LH4,"For those wondering, this ""volume 3"" set is only available on dvd and collects the last 6 episodes of season 1 and the first 9 episodes of season 2, which bridges the gap between the already available volume 1 & 2 sets. It is a Wal-Mart exclusive and retails for around $20. You can find more info here: <...>",1360022400,4,309,4.254237288135593
5509459,1,B00ATI1LH4,"seeing as this is the 15 episodes that are the end of season 1 and the start of season 2, why is there no Blu Ray version, furthermore after going on CC website this one isn't even listed in the shop section, nor does it exsist, I have a feeling this is nothing more than a Bootleg",1359417600,2,281,3.9473684210526314
