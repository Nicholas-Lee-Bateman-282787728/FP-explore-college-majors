This is not just for environmentalists or Philip Glass enthusiasts.  It can be enjoyed by all,  including children.  I hope that it is released soon in conjunction with  the recent re-release of the complete score on audio.",916963200,,335,4.807017543859649

709772,5,6303832563,"This film is about the beautiful world in which we reside, and our own inability to enjoy what it provides, or to live in harmony with nature.  I believe the title of the film means something along the lines of ""a  life in conflict with itself"".  That certainly describes our daily  existence!  The film has no dialogue, but relies upon imagery to convey  meaning.  This is by no means boring or difficult to sit through.  The  filming is extraordinary and captivates the audience from the moment it  begins.  I walked away after watching this film astounded at the beauty in  nature, and at the banal existence of most of the world's population.  I  was so moved by the beauty of this film, that I am still searching for a  copy of it eight years after viewing it for a college course.",914198400,3,786,4.475177304964539

709966,4,6303832563,"Aside from the incredible imagery, and the story line (don't let the director kid you; there's definitely an intended message), this film is particularly interesting to watch from a back-in-time perspective. Crowds of people reading news papers and not checking their cell phones. Crowds of people smiling and making eye contact.  USA manufacturing scenes takes the viewer back to a time when you didn't have to go to Asia to find such scenes.  Streets and freeways full of American built automobiles. Amazing how much things have changed, and not necessarily for the better...which was the prediction of the film.",1508976000,,614,5.191919191919192

Phillip Glass deserves a ballet, not an after-the-fact cinematic collage, no matter how good is the latter.

The intended meanings of Godfrey Reggio's film are suggested in its environmental imagery, in its focus on industrial civilization's high speed and large scale, and by the translation of the title: ""life out of balance."" But meanings, and the fact that the film's use of raw footage is more propagandistic than documentary, are of secondary concern. ""Koyaanisqatsi"" is a powerful work of art because is a pure sensory experience. Long cuts of sped-up landscapes and cityscapes are set to a Philip Glass score, and the effect is utterly mesmerizing. The first time I saw it, I only noticed at the end that my hands had been gripping the armrests. Comparing a film to a roller coaster is a clich, and in this case it doesn't do the film justice; I've been on roller coasters that have less effect on my adrenaline than ""Koyaanisqatsi.""",1423094400,,1008,4.765714285714286

710671,5,6303832563,"This film is a montage of images, including stark natural environments, the abandoned Pruitt-Igoe housing project, and frenetic, sped-up scenes of urban life.  The message is at once critical of the modern ""life out of balance"" while at the same time, patronizing in its ""condemnation"" of modern society, without the accoutrements of which it could not have been made.  It concludes with several Hopi prophecies of the destruction of the earth and the need to live in harmony with nature, whatever that is.  One of them, ""A container of ashes might one day be thrown from the sky, which could burn the land and boil the oceans,"" sounds as if it could be referring to some kind of toxic waste or nuclear fallout - or, it's just confirmation bias.

The film capitalizes on the popular view of Native Americans at the time, epitomized by the image of Sicilian actor Espera Oscar de Corti (better known as ""Iron Eyes Cody"") weeping over litter and other pollution.  No actual Hopi appear in the film, although the title and propecies evoke the wise Indians, living in harmony with nature and gently reminding us that civilization is on a path of destruction.  Criticizing the film for this attitude is inappropriate, as it was light-years ahead of the negative stereotyping of Native Americans typical in movies until that time.  If you want to see a film where Native Americans are depicted as real people, try&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Atanarjuat/dp/B00006RG78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Atanarjuat</a>.

The images are perfectly complemented by the music of Philip Glass (the soundtrack was the first ""modern classical"" album I ever bought).  To some, Glass may be uniquely ""accessible;"" others may consider his work inhumane if played for the prisoners at Guantanamo Bay.  Another way to approach the film is as a video to accompany the soundtrack.  Either way, the film was unusual at the time for a mass-released, popular movie, and still retains its ability to captivate and provoke the viewer.",1407196800,,2046,5.264615384615385

And yet . . and yet . . it is quite simply the best and most profound movie I have ever seen.

It looks at the world, at the modern western way of living, and implies it's absurdity, it's ridiculousness, and yet, in seeming contrast to this, its sheer awesomeness (in the original meaning of the word). It's the perfect movie for an alien to watch to understand us and our world.",1392249600,3,504,4.456521739130435
710748,2,6303832563,"I was born in 1992, so I was not around when this film was released. Maybe it was revolutionary back in the '80s, but as a member of the millennial generation, I'm tired of the message this film presents. I can appreciate the fact that maybe this was the first film to call to attention the way modern progress has drifted so far from our natural roots, but since then, this message has been repeated in every children's television show, award-winning documentary, Animal Planet special, and Oscar-nominated film. For my entire life I have been told that the way I'm living is wrong, and that it's up to me and my generation to solve all the world's problems that were started long before I was born. Because of this, I cannot see this film as giving me a ""new perspective"" because to me, a new perspective is that everything is okay and that even though life may not be perfect, things certainly aren't as bad as some alarmist films such as this might lead you to believe.

In terms of filmmaking, I thought it was very well-done, as one can expect from the creators. The use of time-lapse photography matched with the unique score can be seen mimicked in many films since then, so it has obviously been influential. Perhaps my generational jadedness has once again ruined this film for me as I have seen many similar shots done before both on the Discovery channel and IMAX theaters at natural history museums. Once again, I can appreciate that this film may have been the first to popularize this kind of filmmaking, so I can respect it for that. However, anyone around my age may not be as blown away by it all since we've kind of seen it all before.

I don't mean to generalize my age-group as much as I seem to be doing right now, and I do not want to assert that anyone under the age of 25 will be unable to enjoy this film; I'm simply stating why I was unable to do so and why I think that might be.

Basically, if you've managed to get through life so far without ever seeing an IMAX movie or hearing the opinion that maybe modern life has drifted too far from nature, then this movie will be truly eye-opening for you. For the rest of us who have heard this repeated to us ad nauseam, you may be frustrated by yet another voice telling us that we're wrong for being human and for imagining and creating a life for ourselves unlike anything this planet has ever seen. We might not be getting it right, but it's only our first try. I think that we could use more solutions to the problems presented in this film instead of even more rehashed, over-done commentary on the fact that these problems exist.

Without a single English word, Koyaanisqatsi takes this familiar imagery of the world around us, and draws clear parallels between man and nature, and perhaps wants to show the perils of man seperating itself from the natural order of the world.

710814,4,6303832563,"Ancient as I am (56), I first beheld this genre-bending film when it came out in 1983. It was shown in a small, alternative theater in Eugene, Oregon. This was when, in days of deep yore, one trekked to a location, sat with others, and saw a film. When the film's run was done it was gone. One could not put it into a device or view it on line. So, one tended to forget.

Now thirty years later, with more degrees, more knowledge, and more weariness about life under the sun, I watched Koyaanisqatsi anew with a discerning young friend who is the same age as I was when I first watched it. This lends itself to some reflection.

There is no narration, and voices only are heard as the credits run. The cinematography is everything and is impressive in its variety, depth, and scope. The theme is the relation of nature to culture, of the wild to the human and the domesticated, so to speak. We behold vistas of creation's grandeur and sublimity. The film begins very slowly with ulta-slow-motion footage of a rocket launch. Then scenes of dry mountains and deep ponds appear. These may have been present to juxtapose the permanent beauty of nature with the fleeting ugliness of man. However, what is the point of beauty if we blame the beholder for existing and trying to flourish? There are no scenes from forests or jungles or icecaps.

Something is then blown up. A mountain falls--and we move into civilization, where humans touch nature. There is little emphasis on the achievements of man, but on his failures and miscalculations. All is overcrowded, much is ugly, workers are mere drones on assembly lines, and more.

Hopi ""prophecies"" are shown at the end of the film, giving the viewer the idea that they knew. They knew what would be lost. They knew what would come...

But these prophecies are quite vague and offer no hope. In this, the film is romantic about nature, forgetting about its redness in tooth and claw; in fact, animals are scarcely seen. Man is not measured by both his majesty and misery (Pascal), but by how he as despoiled nature. The film also neglects man's conservation of and concern for nature.

The credits reveal that several social critics, such as the Christian sociologist, Jacques Ellul and the Catholic priest, Ivan Illich, have helped in inspire this documentary with no words. The score is by Phillip Glass, and is, of course, very repetitive, both in its slow scenes and in its speeded-up scenes of humans driving and bustling about. This waxes cloying after a few moments.

The technology, which is generally vilified in this film, is, to the contemporary eye, rather antiquated. People play huge, public video games, such as Pacman. They stare at bulky and non-digitized television sets. There is not a laptop or cell phone in sight. Thus, the gap, as it were, between nature and culture has widened. Have we become ""tools of our tools,"" as Thoreau said?",1370131200,8,2900,4.708086785009862
710815,5,6303832563,"Unusual, but I could watch it over & over again.  The visual is just part of the draw: Phillip Glass' music keeps the viewer enthralled.

711099,2,6303832563,"Although Joe Beirne tries to lay to rest the aspect ratio troubling this dvd release he isn't right about the original release format for this movie.
He may be right on the decision making for the aspect ratio of the current release and the fact that pan and scan would be an awful method to transfer the original image to 1:1.85 aspect ratio but that doesn't mean that there isn't any problem with the chosen aspect ratio for this release.
The original theatrical release was in the 1:1.33 aspect ratio mentioned and that was the ratio used when screened at the cinema.
He implies that the current release has the original aspect ratio at which the film was shot and that now finally it has been released in it's full aspect ratio.
If that is true then there would be more to see in the images presented on this new dvd version, mainly left and right of the image frame would show more and additional picture information. and therein lies the problem of this release, there is no more information there to be seen but the picture looks like a cropped version of the original 1:1.33 release. Cropped in this instance means that the picture has been zoomed into to fit a different screen format than the original format for this movie. It shows up like there is a portion missing at the lower and upper sides of the original freme of the picture as is the problem with this release when compared with the older versions of this release on dvd and vhs videotapee and the way it was screened in the cinema. On the other hand there are no black bars on either side of the picture when viewed on a widescreen display that were unavailable when the movie was originally released for the home market.
But that doesn't mean that the print used for this release was shot in 1:1.85 aspect ratio! When I compared the new release with the original IRE release of this dvd and the older vhs tape it became very clear that the frame has been cropped to fit the 1:1.85 screen.
This is clearly to be seen at the approx. 10 minutes into the movie when there is a rock face to be seen that fills the original frame with just the top of the facia at top of the screen and the base of the rock with it's sediment lines at the bottom. The new version doesn't show either the top of the facia nor the sediment lines at the bottom but it does fill the tv screen from left to right without black bars. So there is a substantial portion of the picture frame missing when compared to the older version and there isn't more or new sights to be seen in the newer version on the left or the right hand of the new picture frame versus the old picture frame.
I hope when the Blu Ray version will be released, that they make it available in the old aspect ratio because there is nothing more being added to the picture by cropping the originl frame format just to loose the black bars in the screen, I can live with those perfectly.
If you can't, well, change the aspect ratio of your tv to make the image fit your tv screen and loose those black bars when you want to.
Something that should have been left to the costumer to decide instead of cropping the original picture in the first place.",1283299200,10,3161,4.341216216216216
711183,2,6303832563,"Koyaanisqatsi made an artsy splash when it came out in 1983, but for reasons now lost I couldn't make it to a showing.  Twenty seven years later I finally got my wish.

I wanted to like Koyaanisqatsi, but was forced to realize it hasn't aged well. Godfrey Reggio shows a very good eye for dramatic shots, but then works them to exhaustion.  The time lapse scenes of people scurrying around like harried ants grew wearisome after two minutes, let alone ten.  The movie's metaphor of modern life as a hotdog highway, with people as the hotdogs, was soon made abundantly clear, but Reggio seems uncertain of his audiences' intelligence and just pounds this thought into their collective skull.

Likewise, Phillip Glass's score became an exercise in repetition that eventually began to grate on my ears.  To be fair Glass captures the atmosphere of the movie and the repetition in the score is a faithful reflection of the cinematography. Given the singularity of Reggio's vision he had no other option.

Koyaanisqatsi would have been great as a fifteen minute short subject; but like having a guest who overstays his welcome, I was relieved when it was over.",1282348800,9,1155,4.862244897959184

This film from 1983 continues to be a landmark achievement regaleling the state of our planet and what 'we' have done to ravage it, even if only a slice of the entire.  The seamless beauty of the southwest is comparable to none.  We are treated to vistas, mountains, peaks and valleys, awe inspiring clouds and then the reality of man, milling around as a colony of ants to all we create and all we destroy.  An important lesson in our just realized eco-climate world.  I've also read the bad reviews concerning it's supposedly bad 'aspect ratio', and 'sound' issues, and others saying ""what a waste of time.""  To them I would have to wonder just how cultured and intelligent they are.  Even in it's ""bad"" widescreen presentation it is a sumptuous and thought provoking piece of film history.  Things may be somewhat 'cropped', but you only have to envision what you don't see to get the full meaning of what Koyaanisqatsi brings to the heart, soul and mind.  I would not only highly recommend this film, but to challenge the viewer to take what is on screen, project what you feel, widen what you feel, and expand this to encompass the entire globe.  I personally love this film because with each viewing I come away with something knew and even more thought concerning.  There are other films that create the visions of our reality and they are all excellent in their nature, Koyaanisqatsi just prequels them, encouraging future visionalist to share that what we see, feel and hear concerns us all.  So there, Koyaanisqatsi is what it is and so much more.  An introspective journey of thought.",1279065600,2,1749,4.691803278688525

711191,3,6303832563,"Many reviewers on these pages have written at length about questions of aspect ratio for 'Koyaanisqatsi', and I'm glad to see people finally taking these questions seriously. But why has no-one mentioned the marked problems with the soundtrack of this DVD version? Few films rely on the effect of the music as much as this one, and I would suggest that the experience of viewing this film derives in fairly equal measure from Reggio's visuals and Glass's music.
Why then is the sound quality on this DVD so shoddy? It really is appalling - much worse than the stereo of my old MGM VHS tape version, which takes some doing. To anyone who works professionally with audio (as I do) it's clear what has happened - the audio has been shabbily processed by someone who hasn't even bothered to listen to what they've done. If I may quote from a perceptive reviewer at DVD.net.au: ""the audio has been time compressed in an effort to pitch-correct the music. Unfortunately, the time compression software (or hardware) that's been used here is sub-standard and not suitable for music. As a result there are clearly audible audio glitches throughout the film, particularly on sustained notes of particular pitches. In the case of this disc, the LFE channel is the worst-affected (thanks to the sustained notes from the organ) but there are problems in the other channels as well. Whether you'll hear them depends on how keen your ears are, but to this reviewer's ears it made the audio almost unlistenable at times. A real disappointment."" Now why the music should need pitch-correcting is a whole other question, but the answer is simple. It doesn't.
The fact is you don't need to have particularly keen ears to hear the mess they've made of this marvellous music - you just need to be listening properly. If you are interested in music, audio fidelity or quality DVD authoring, buy this disc with caution. In fact the two-disc set is cheap enough to buy it just to see what it's like, but be prepared for possible (if not probable) disappointment.",1271635200,8,2038,4.792613636363637

711251,5,6303832563,"Perhaps if enough of us write reviews, Koyaanisqatsi in BluRay will become a reality.

The decision on whether or not to make a BluRay version of a given movie rests with the studio executives.  MGM in this case, I believe.  I hear that MGM is in financial difficulty.  K-Qatsi is a cult film and may therefore not be high on their priority list.  But any money they invest to remaster and release it on BluRay would probably produce a very fast and very large (percentage-wise) return on investment because just about everyone who owns the DVD version of this film is itching to buy the BluRay disc as soon as it comes out.  The same cannot be said for most films.

Studios often underestimate the profitability of niche-market products that have a small but dedicated fan base.  For example, the Fox TV Network had a science-fiction series about ten years ago called ""Firefly"" that developed an intense (albeit not huge) fan base.  The ratings weren't as high as Fox had hoped for, so the show got cancelled before the first season was finished.  Later, they released the series on DVD almost as an afterthought, probably not expecting to make much money on it.  As it turned out, everyone who'd been a fan of the show immediately bought the DVDs and Fox made a ton of money very fast, much to their surprise.  Consequently, Fox Studios decided to bankroll the theatrical film ""Serenity"" based on the series.  Perhaps not by coincidence, ""Serenity"" was one of the very first movies to come out on HD-DVD back when HD-DVD had a head-start over BluRay.

Fast forward five years.

I attempted to absorb this film again this year, February 2010. No luck. This is, IMO, the best joining of film and music ever conceived (for this genre of course). This is a haunting piece of work that is beyond description.

To the soul not receptive to the vibes put forth from this film, I would assume the watching to be pure torture. Such a person would probably fall asleep after five minutes or shut down their whole system and go to bed. From this reviewer's perspective though, this film cannot be described---you have to feel it.

Subsequent to feeling it, there really are no words to describe it in detail. Depending on your mood and depth, you will either walk away with a troubled spirit, OR you will be fascinated. Or both! The filmmaker did a SUPERB job constructing this jewel to illicit both responses. Also, without the unbelievable music, which was perfect for the film, there would be no reviews for this.

While I do not doubt that Mr. Beirne is correct that the theatrical version is what the director intended, I found this site's comparison of the DVDs to be very enlightening:[...]

The most disheartening part is the clearly inferior sampling rate of the MGM DVD release compared to the original IRE DVD. The clarity in the IRE images, compared to the MGM images, is startling. Also, seeing both aspect ratios directly compared, it seems obvious to me that the images were very much composed with 1:1.33 in mind, if not exclusively for it.

Personally, I think the composition of the images in that ratio are superior, but the poor sampling rate of the widescreen version makes it hard to make a fair comparison.

I can say this DVD doesn't capture the experience, what with it's not so glamorous picture quality. But until the inevitable Blu-ray comes on the market, this is the best we've got and it's fairly good. The colors are vivid and there aren't too many defects. The picture does need some clean-up work. The source would greatly benefit from a high-def remaster.

Koyaanisqatsi is quite an original film, having influenced everything from television ads, music videos, nature documentaries and even feature length Hollywood movies. The film is all about pulse and movement conveyed by the time lapse editing style it made famous.

It's style and essence has been ripped off so many times during the nearly three decades since it came out, that it's easy to take Koyaanisqatsi for granted. But going back to the original is always thrilling and I don't think there has ever been a better film of it's type.

The film and it's director, Godfrey Reggio, have been criticized for being preachy. I think these criticisms are partially valid for this film but far more valid for the subsequent installments of the trilogy. Reggio and Glass give an insightful interview which can be found on the special features that goes into Reggio's background and how they collaborated on this film.

Koyaanisqatsi starts off slow and some of the nature photography tends to drag, but things take off as humanity comes on the scene and the final portions of the film reach a fever pitch that neither Reggio, nor his later imitators ever captured again. The score by Philip Glass is a classic of sorts in modern film scoring. Glass' minimalism can become quite grating on it's own but with the constant visual onslaught, it meshes rather well. Glass would become a big name in film scoring afterwards and he's been repeating the same style for decades.

The images are beautiful and of poetic quality.  The music by Philip Glass is great.  I have seen this movie several times, and I still find it one of the best pictures ever made.",1234483200,2,627,4.464912280701754
711442,5,6303832563,"This is a solid, very well made artistic film about modern life being out of balance.  It is similar to Baraka... yet it somehow has a clearer impact.  Noticeable are the VERY impressive transitions from each shot to the next.  Very well thought out and brilliant editing of the various shots.

It is so refreshing to watch a real movie after years of Hollywood tripe and drivel.  This is that rare thing to find - a real movie, with really brilliant editing, a clear message and awesome execution.  You will not find silly, pointless plots here or immature sitcom pratfalls.  This movie tells the story through the use of powerful visual images set to stimulating yet minimalist music.  This is not simply eye candy - there is a deep, well thought out theme going on throughout.

It is pretty clear after watching this that humans, though they have advanced... have also created a strange nightmare land that enslaves every person caught up in it.  The wonder and awe of technology is there... and yet it becomes clear that, in many ways, it has gone much too far.  Overpopulated, caged, frantic, nightmarish, absurd.  There seems to be a kind of ""middle path"" possible where technology and the planet can be in balance... things are currently ""out of balance.""  I won't spoil it for you... however the final transition where the stock market floor turns into the NASA rocket is epic.

711443,4,6303832563,"I viewed this movie on a watch instantly feature (ie, computer monitor) and the picture was kinda fuzzy. This might be sharper on a DVD form? This film starts off with about 20 minutes of videos of rocks, clouds, water. Then it starts moving into the human aspects. You see the camera swoop over radio antennas (whatever kind of antennas those were). You also see things like: skyscrapers with reflections of clouds, parking lot of multicolored cars, a lot of busy intersections with the film sped up, buildings and a bridge or two being demolished, Twinkie/hot dog/car factory all with music in the background. There is no narration. This movie definitely had a I should watch this in IMAX type feel to it. Some of the nature shots had this high school nature film aura about it. If you're in the mood for something like that, then you should like the film!

The title Life out of Balance insinuates that wed be viewing more of a harmful human effect on nature. But I personally felt this film showed more of the hecticness of human life (a lot of the people scenes were sped up). Maybe we are out of balance in this ant/drone like way.... but I didn't get the feeling of destructive with the exception of one or two shots. Some of the skyscraper shots were, well, pretty. I just don't see how that reflected a life out of balance or portrayed our current situation in a horrific, bad-steward-of-the-earth type of way. My personal opinion. Take it or leave it.

I loved the Indian quotes (very small part of the film).  But, like I said, I didn't understand how Koyaanisqatsi was displayed in the overall message the film actually put across (ie, the filmer's intentions didn't match what was portrayed on screen).",1229299200,,1715,4.653465346534653

711445,5,6303832563,"Film buffs frequently create lists of their 10 favorite movies. My answer changes from day to day, but there are three films always on the list: Koyannisqatsi, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Fantasia. A new age documentary, a science-fiction drama, anda cartoon; three completely different films.

Koyannisqatsi is the newest and least known of these three films. It is a 1982 documentary with ads that said ""Until now, you've never really seen the world you live in."". Director Godfrey Reggio combines stock footage (rocket launches, landscape vistas, building demolitions, munitions tests) with spectacular new footage by cinematographer Ron Fricke (cityscapes, commuter crowds, clouds and waves, traffic jams, assembly lines). He creates a mosaic of life in the modern industrial world and how it has become disconnected from the natural world and is now a `life out of balance', which is a translation of the title. Although the film has no characters, dialogue or narration, the dramatic editing and stirring score by Philip Glass create a great emotional, and even physical impact. I once talked my mother into seeing it with me. While she liked it very much and still comments on it, at the end of one particularly frenetic sequence she said, with a sigh of relief, ""Thank goodness that's over"".

2001 is an imaginative look at how man's evolution might have been affected by outside influences. Much of the film has no dialogue whatever. The rest has occasional patches of dialogue, with most having nothing to do with the plot. There is the TV interview, a father's phone call on his daughter's birthday, proud parents radio message on their distant son's birthday, a computer's seeming random questions while working up the crew psychology report, the rambling song of a computer having its memory erased. None of this has anything to do with the search for the source of the strange artifact first found by prehistoric apes, then later by explorers on the moon and how it may affect man's future. More important than dialogue are the amazing visuals and music. The spaceship ballets, technical hardware, and the ending star gate dance of lights, combined with magnificent music evoke the sense of wonder and awe that the vastness of space and the possibilities of the future should inspire.

Walt Disney's Fantasia is a groundbreaking film creating a painted ballet to accompany several pieces of well-known music. The only dialogue is short introductions to each piece by renowned musicologist Deems Taylor. He briefly comments on the composer, if the music tells a specific story, and whether Disney's animation follows that story. Music can evoke strong emotions in the listener with or without a story. Fantasia frequently creates new stories for the music, but the power of the music to arouse the listener remains. The mouse king is gone from the Nutcracker Suite, but a circle of dancing mushrooms, and bouquet of waltzing flowers is no less charming and whimsical. The primitive dances of the Rite of Spring have been changed to the struggles of prehistoric life, but the music is still powerfully thrilling. The rage and fury of demons in Night on Bald Mountain end at dawn as the serene beauty of Ave Maria accompanies the glory of a sunrise. Image and music again stir the viewer's soul.

A science-fiction drama, a cartoon, and a new age documentary; three completely different films thematically that each show the power of image and music to reach the viewer emotionally.",1220918400,,3492,5.057291666666667

Why they chose to stick to 3 - 5 MBPS is appalling. For those of you who do not know MBPS = Mega Bits Per Second. MBPS is similar to Megapixels (when speaking about a digital camera).  The higher the Mega Bits used per second the more information used to store thie picture and thus the higher the quality the picture will be and the better it will look.

711557,5,6303832563,"If you can show a little patience for the first 18 minutes of this film, it will suddenly become very entertaining as well as informative about our world. It's a totally wordless collage of great camera effects which I wouldn't doubt, probably set the stage for using time-lapse filming and dramatic slow motion effects of the simple things that we may have never put in such perspective before.

After the initial start of the film, we see a world before man has put his hands to it.  We see God's creation as it can be today, as it was probably a million years ago.  Philip Glass offers a great musical score to the visuals of this entire film.  You see the beauty of the natural earth, and then suddenly, we see man starting to cut into it, build on it, expand man's existence upon it, and definitely alter the beauty of what it once was.  But, do we have a choice?  Technology must prevail and it certainly does as this film shows you.  But how much technology is enough?  How much is too much?  As we continue to grow and take from the earth, and deplete our earthly resources everyday, we are also returning our manufactured waste to the earth, which is in turn, polluting our earth.  But, what can we do?

Man is destined to destroy itself and our mother earth and although it's nobody's fault, we have no choice but to either bury our waste or burn it.  Neither one benefits our planet.  This film of Koyaanisqatsi (filmed in 1983) inadvertently shows us the effects of ""global warming"" even before we gave this earthly disease a name.

Watch this film, and then watch Al Gore's ""The Inconvenient Truth"" and hopefully someone with some tangible clout can stand up and make a difference for our future.  Will our grandchildren be wearing masks to breathe and skin protection from the sun?  That appears to be the direction that we are going.  Godfrey Reggio saw this even back in the 1970's.  This movie of Koyaanisqatsi warned us nearly 25 years ago.

If anything though, this film is a lot of fun to watch.  And the music is great!  Also check out Godfrey Reggio's other two films ""Powaqqatsi"" and ""Naqoyqatsi"".  And also check out ""Baraka"", a film from the same cameraman Ron Fricke filmed just a few years ago that almost consolidates many of the ideas that you see in Godfrey Reggio's work.

711558,3,6303832563,"Koyaanisqatsi (Godfrey Reggio, 1983)

I've been waiting over twenty years to see Koyaanisqatsi, and now I finally have. From what I've been reading, I get the idea that perhaps I should have held out for a big-screen showing (or an IMAX showing, since it seems there's a grass-roots movement for an IMAX translation); I keep hearing that it loses a lot in translation, and I can see that. It's a movie that's full of sweeping landscapes, brilliant cinematography, and the kind of soundtrack that begs to be heard on the kind of half-million-dollar sound system you find in upscale movie houses. That, however, is not to say that renting the DVD will not give you any sense of those things; like most lost-in-translation cases, what's really missing here is the majesty of the thing. The basic idea still comes through loud and clear. And I'll tell you right now--despite having no actors, no script, no real structure (Reggio cut and pasted the movie together according to the way Philip Glass had structured his awe-inspiring soundtrack)--Koyyanisqatsi is an unabashed message movie, and a great deal of whether you like it or not will depend on your reaction to its message. Those of you who know me, and know anything about Koyyanisqatsi, can probably recite the rest of this review in your head without actually having to read it.

In short: Koyyanisqatsi is beautiful, beautiful propaganda. Looking at it a full quarter century after its release, my first thought was, in all honesty, ""what makes this different than the kinds of movies you see in museums and the like?"" (cf. Sedona: The Spirit of Wonder.) The answer becomes obvious about ten minutes into the film: it's the quality of Ron Fricke (Baraka)'s incredible camerawork. (Remember that this was Fricke's first feature-length project, and it's even more impressive.) It takes about ten minutes because the first section of any substance in the film takes that long to show up; the first sequence is basic shots of the same natural wonders we've seen a thousand times (in fact, IMDB reports in its trivia section that one of the mountain scenes was ""leftover footage"" from Kubrick's The Shining). Now, I know a lot of people are going to criticize that statement, because it means I missed the point of that sequence. No, I didn't miss the point. If you want to show the majesty and grandeur of nature, there are certainly better ways to do it than showing stock footage, especially when you've got Ron Fricke doing your cinematography. I mean, come on, is there any American-made Western from the fifties and sixties that doesn't have grand, sweeping pans of red rock country?

Then we get to human beings scurrying over the landscape like tool-using ants, and we get to the body of Fricke's footage (there are still some stock shots interspersed, but they don't take up as much room). What you see in these pictures will depend entirely on your viewpoint coming into the film. Is the scene of two policemen and some EMTs lifting a passed out (or dead) man onto a stretcher in New York City a scene conveying the horrors of humanity (in the dead man), or a scene of professional servicepeople admirably doing their jobs? How about the scene of a (presumably) husband and wife eating a meal, sitting at a table in a mall food court, while people stream around them? While it's filmed in the same fast-motion as many of the other human scenes, are they part of the problem, or an island of calm? Or, earlier on, a scene of a fight pilot standing in front of his plane. You can tell from the scenes that surround this one that we're supposed to view this man and his instrument of destruction with horror. But how does that scan with the brave, slightly humble look on his face?

Simple: it doesn't, unless you're willing to work the edges a little to get the piece to fit into the hole.

The fact that Koyyanisqatsi is slanted should be obvious even to the most idealistic devotee of the film. To be fair (and to address my points above), it's probably less so than any fictional environmentalist movie I've seen (I'm thinking specifically of Prophecy here--Frankenheimer's '79 ecomonster flick, not the Walken/Mortensen fallen-angel amusement). It leaves more room for interpretation, though I'm assuming that its target audience mostly has a `preaching to the choir' mindset. All this by way of saying that even if you're a member of the pave-the-earth society, there are a lot of pretty pictures here, Philip Glass' soundtrack is as wonderful as the rest of Glass' work, and you might come up with some interesting points when debating the fanatics. Recommended, though I'm not sure it would stand up to a long series of repeated rewatches. ***",1184025600,11,4710,4.809876543209876
711559,5,6303832563,"Shot in the late 70's and early 80's, this film has aged quite a bit from its introduction.  This, as it turns out, only adds to the works splendor.  I first saw this work in a live performance at Symphony Hall, Boston in 1990.  Then, which seems like yesterday, it was less then 10 years old.  Never-the-less, it made a deep impression on me and the audience as it received a tumultuous standing ovation at its end.  In the 17 years that have passed since I first saw it, it has only grown in its meaning and complexities.

For me, the films ultimate meaning resides in the depiction of God's creations and man's futile attempts at that same act.  Looking back at the nearly 30 years since it was first shot, the scenes of the Grand Canyon, clouds, deserts, Niagara Falls, etc., look as wondrous as ever, while the clothing, cars, haircuts, etc., seem hopelessly dated and tacky.

711706,5,6303832563,"The images in Koyaanisqatsi portray ""mass technology as the environment of life."" There is a meditative quality as image and music create a fusion of nature and city life. There is an undercurrent of loneliness, as if the humans walking through these settings have lost some deep memory of a tribal life where people felt more connected and cared for. The name of the film means ""life out of balance"" and is a word from the Hopi language.

After a brief viewing of cave paintings we are taken on a journey where clouds summersault through the sky or rush through mountains like sky rivers. There is a stark contrast between the aging of the earth, which brings even more beauty to the world (mountains, jagged peaks) and the disintegration of buildings which scars the landscape. Perfectly still lakes present mesmerizing beauty while cities at first seem poetic and serene, then turn chaotic.

Some of the images are profoundly moving, like when you look into the eyes of people who seem lost or when viewing a bomb-testing site in the background and a tree dying in the foreground, completely deformed.

Humor is sometimes present when the pictures are sped up, although they seem to imply a hungry consumer culture. There are a few images of people on a beach, but most of the images seem to be implying that people are isolating themselves and destroying a serene beauty enjoyed by cultures more in tune with a natural flow of life.

Electronic music creates a pleasant background that merges as easily with scenes from nature as the organization of a city and a computer chip. In this artistic dance of machine and music there is still a lot to think about and while survival is always a universal factor, how we want to live in the future is a question we have to ask ourselves today.

My work has been informed by the mesmerizing images and non-conventional storytelling I first encountered years ago when I saw Koyaanisqatsi on a large screen in the theater.  The images were crisp and breathtaking -- little stood between the experiencer and the lens on the camera that had photographed those powerful images.

Without a story or a plot, this film's parade of images engaged me -- I thought about things, had insights, drew conclusions, yet I was not told WHAT to think as in other films.  Therefore, what I took away from this film was all the more powerful, because I made it, not had it handed to me.

The disk provides but a memory of that experience to me.  I have a sophisticated viewing set-up -- a DVD player that 'up-rez'es the images to 1080i feeding a CRT broadcast evaluation monitor.  My speakers are industry-standard evaluation monitors.

This set-up revealed banding (posterization) and MPEG artificating, suggesting the disk was a cheap single-layer (4.7Gig), not dual-layer (8.5Gig).  My examination of the disk confirmed -- single layer (sigh).

I guess I can always HOPE for a future release that will have a 10-bit transfer and will support a bit-rate that will do justice to the subtle shadings and detail in the static scenes and, during the high-delta (change/motion) scenes, won't deliquesce (melt) into a techno-psychedelia of MPEG macroblocks ('pixilate').

711713,4,6303832563,"""Koyaanisqatsi"" reminds me a bit of a 1980s National Geographic magazine a bit, just without the written words to back the pictures up. It's an 82 minute film of nothing but images of nature and cities, some sped up, others slowed down, with a soundtrack of ""theatre music"" by Phillip Glass. It's an interesting spectacle, but not quite as much as I thought it would be.

Director Godfrey Reggio has an eye for detail, and it makes for some fascinating shots, like the dance of cars across the traffic lights, the flow of the freeway like blood in a vein, the billowing of clouds and the detailed delicate crest of a breaking wave. It's interesting to see the people of New York during this period too, how they worked, how they walked, what they did for fun, etc. Trouble is, all these shots and music one after the other can get a little tiring after a while if you're not up for it. It's a film that does feel a little longer than it actually is sometimes. I mean, if you saw some of these shots in plot driven films with a proper context, you'd be impressed I'm pretty sure, but in this film sometimes their meaning and purpose is a little vague. I'm not the biggest fan of vague meanings.

The meaning I get out of them though, out of the whole film, is to do with rhythm. The clouds have it, the shadows have it, all of nature that can be seen has it. Man has rhythm too in his everyday life, in his habits, in the architecture of his systems, and definitely in his music (though it's more about a certain kind of repetition with Phillip Glass more than rhythm, I'd say). Trouble is, man's rhythm is a bit faster than what the world's set up for, and it may be putting life ""out of balance"" as the title suggests.

From the creeping slowness of shadows across red canyons, to the fitful churning of clouds, to the blur of crowds in fast motion, and the monumental stillness of a single human face emerging from the mass, this film pulls the viewer through an evolutionary journey from balance to disintegrating glory. The meanings, as Reggio says, lie somewhere in the space between the images and the music--but it is for the viewer to find them.

Watching ""Koyaanisqatsi"" is something of a religious experience. I come away from it with an aching heart--aching from wonder at the world's beauty, at the fragility of humankind, and a sense of tragedy underneath it all.

Just brilliant, dramatic cinematography with a groundbreaking soundtrack to match. I showed this film to my daughters before they even attended Kindergarten and they have remained big fans now that they are college age.

What I love is the irony at work here. The filmakers attempted to draw a comparison between the natural and man-made world with the usual heavy handed Al Goreish leftist slant: Nature-good, mankind-bad! Open space-good, making products people want-bad! Mountains-good, cities-VERY BAD!

What happens, though is the opposite effect whether they intended it or not: beautiful rhythms and patterns are repeated not only in nature but also in industry! Time elapse photography will have you marveling at the graceful flow of such seemingly mundane scenes as thousands of people exiting Grand Central. It almost defies description. Have a look for yourself.

Highly recommended. A classic.",1155513600,7,1038,5.355828220858895
711803,5,6303832563,"Over the past few years, I've taken notice of the complaints about the MGM version of ""Koyaanisqatsi"". Specifically the blurriness and out of focus transfer they did when they first released the film. I have since made it my quest to find a 'cleaner' transfer of the film.

I was in Barnes & Noble the other day, when I saw (quite in disbelief) a copy of the MGM release with a sticker on the outside wrapping. This sticker was located on the upper left corner on the front of the DVD that said, ""New high resolution transfer"" or words to that effect. The packaging was exactly the same as my blurry version I already had at home. There was virtually no difference whatsoever in the artwork or details of the film listed on the back. I went up to a clerk and made them promise me to let me exchange the DVD if I took it home and discovered that it was the same muddy version that I already had.

When I got home I opened it up. The disc also has the exact same artwork as my muddy disc......and nowhere on the disc or on the cover did it say anything about being changed (only the sticker on the outside wrap). I really had little if no hope at all that this was going to be any different that my other one. I put the disc in and started playing it, and to my pleasure and surprise, the film had indeed been sharpened up quite nicely.

Now, don't get me wrong......the transfer wasn't crystal clear like Powaqatsi and Naqoyqatsi.....but it was definitely a marked improvement.

For those of you who are trying to find this new transfer, just make sure you see that sticker in the upper left corner on the front. I think you'll be pleased at how much clearer the images are now.

And as for all the complaints about the 1:85:1 aspect ratio, I think that you should all read Producer Joe Beirne's (Naqoyqatsi) entry here in the Koyaanisqatsi page. He has made it abundantly clear that the 1:85:1 version IS the DIRECTOR'S APPROVED version of the film. You may not like the bars at top and bottom, but that's the way that Director Godfrey Reggio wants you to see it. So, I'll use a great quote made popular in the 1990's.....Get Over It!!!

Now down to some business...........would anyone be interested in buying a copy of the muddy version of Koyaanisqatsi? hee hee :-)",1154995200,2,2268,4.400954653937948
711804,5,6303832563,"This is my FAVORITE movie. A true work of cinematic art, poetically melding visuals and music into one singular experience. It just cannot be translated into any other form of art or communication.

Of course all of this hype is in vain. Now, to me, this movie IS that good. (As good as can be translated by strategic use of capitalized text? Don't be sarcastic.) But my first viewing of ""Koyaanisqatsi"" was unplanned, spontaneous. It just happened. (And I love it when that happens.) It wasn't part of my curriculum as a photographer or college student, and never mind the exact circumstances -- I could go on for pages -- but I came to this movie with absolutely no hype, a little curiosity, and an hour and a half to waste. It ended up changing the way I look at motion pictures, my country, and the world. (No BS.)

Having seen the whole Qatsi Trilogy and Baraka, several times each, and owning all those DVDs and soundtrack albums, I think I'll compare and contrast a little. (Well, at least between this and Baraka. So much has already been said of both pictures by themselves.) First of all, the two movies are very different. Their ideas, pacing, and execution differ very much, despite being shot by the same guy (who is a genius, if not a bit mad.)

::MUSIC VS. IMAGES::
Baraka feels much more like a 'movie', where the music of Michael Stearns, Dead Can Dance and the rest, serves to follow the images (which take top billing,) and have little bearing on where the movie goes. Koyaanisqatsi is more like a music video, or musical, with Philip Glass's music being the only sound on the movie's audio tracks (aside from wind and traffic noises during ""Organic"" and ""The Grid"",) and was edited together with the images in a series of movements. Sometimes music comments on action, other times they are equal partners. ""The Grid"" deserves particular mention, aside from being a musical/technical masterpiece, it sounds exactly the way it looks--and vice versa. Complete cinematic poetry. And in both movies, Stearns' and Glass' music serves to put you in a state of mind and body; it lets your mind wander and wonder as you digest the imagery. And in my case, my mind wandered far and wondered deeply.

::PACING::
Reggio, Fricke, and Glass could have been young, tenacious, naive, ballsy, pathetic, or any one or several of those things when they were making Koyaanisqatsi back in the late seventies-->early eighties, but the fact of the matter is that it plays with your attention span, and tests your tolerances for the peripatetic and hyperkinetic more than any film the three have made afterwards. The film won't come to you---you must come to it, because for the first third or so, it could care less whether or not you're watching. Some people interpret this as boring and lazy filmmaking (and maybe it is) but it does contribute to the film's major point. And it wasn't meant to be pure entertainment anyway. But if you are watching and listening, there is a chafing strength that rumbles beneath the surface and only intensifies, until you are practically watching an ultra-commercial. This film cranks up the tension like no other.

----And speaking of commercials, most every one made since '83 when Koyaanisqatsi came out have borrowed from its cinematic flourishes and knack for visual puns and illustrating simple truths... and made it all *shudder...* marketable and commonplace. How blasphemous! How tragic. Nonetheless, what you see in commercials nowadays (though technically brilliant) is only a lame attempt to emulate greatness. Doesn't come close to even scraping the tip of the iceberg.

I cannot conclude which film is the better one. Baraka is techincally heads and shoulders above its predecessors (and its sequel Samsara promises to be phenominally even better.) Its scope is broader (both in its ideas and from a cinematographical standpoint,) it is less critical with regards to the way we live our lives, is arguably more beautiful to watch, has more tolerable music, and is generally a much less jagged pill to swallow. However, Godfrey Reggio once said that some negativity these days is healthy for a change, just like a body that is able to feel pain knows something is wrong. And with that knowledge, change is possible. It would also be too simple to say that Baraka tries to do in one movie what the Qatsi Trilogy explores in-depth over the course of three. It's just that the planes on which they operate are different, but are nonetheless enriching for the soul.

Koyaanisqatsi was the first film that made love to me, in a spiritual/mental/physical way. Before that, I didn't know a movie could have such power. Seeing my other favorites again and again can't possibly compare to the experience I had when I saw THIS movie for the first time. Don't invite your friends.

A God's eye view of planet earth and its inhabitants. From the opening scene of tribal heiroglyphs and chanting reverberation, the film launches into an enchanting series of impressive environmental scenes set to haunting electronic and instrumental music,  with scenes I have divided into five sections:

1. Homage to The Four-Crown Princes of Hell.

Stunning vistas of the elements in flux, from canyons to plains to forests to volcanos to fields of kaleidoscopic color, to clouds and storms and the massive movements of the ocean.

2. Infernal Machines.

Cut to behemoth land-tilling machines, man-made industrial environments, expansive scenery of automobiles, planes, and space-age technological inventions.

3. The Herd.

The teaming masses shuffling to and fro, set to insect-like speeds. The proles kept in perspective. Crowds and clusters of humanity, with a few individual shots of amusing foibles and locations.

4. The Concrete Jungle.

Skyscrapers, slums, implosions, construction and destruction, as well as beautiful shots of the metropolitan evening.

5. End.

A return to the heiroglyphs, which seems to signify a primal contemplation, a return to The Source.

Koyaanisqatsi is certainly a Satanic meditation, which would prove beneficial after any interaction with the herd, a veritable ""eye in the sky"" - asserts the ""larger picture"", as it were. A LaVeyan recommendation, I imagine this would be much more enhanced on a big screen; it is mostly comprised of time-lapse film, adding a certain eerie element, and the tenebrous music compliments it well.",1143158400,3,1727,5.4232209737827715

I have yet to meet someone who has not been impressed by this movie and wonder why it's not better known by the public. As the ""life out of balance"" comment suggest it also carry a strong message. While there are no dialogue, this is far from being an emotionless movie either. Of my close friend who watched it recently in my home, said it was of the 10 best movies he's seen. I had never though of comparing it with other movie because for me it's always been in it's own class.

A word on sound and image : to fully enjoy this movie you need two things : 1) a large, high definition screen 2) a superb, high end audio system (if you do not have one this I suggest using a headphone but not one of these wireless ones with bad acoustics).  If you are lucky to have both the overall experience is likely to be better than watching it in a movie theater because the DVD was made from an original tape while the movies theaters are showing  old, used tapes with plenty of glitches and the sound would be better too (if...).

There is one tune that seems to have been inspired by techno/transe...except that it was written before the musical genre existed at all...who copied whom ?

Philipp Glass made two follow up to this movie, Powaqqatsi, which is boring and where the music lack any interest and Nagoyqatsi which is very interesting as well, and is also lucky to have good music from Philipp Glass.

711811,5,6303832563,"Koyaanisqatsi is a Hopi Indian word that means ""life out of balance"". Godfrey Reggio, the director, said he had to be talked into even giving the movie a word title.  He, in fact, had to be talked out of giving it a symbol title (which probably has never been done in movies). He also made the movie without any spoken words, making it come straight at you without any supports, or carry on baggage.  There is an energetic sound track from Phillip Glass which is really not a support either. It is explained in one of the DVD features that the viewer is to understand the film by entering into the space between the scenes and the music, which I thought was a very interesting concept.  (By the way, be sure to visit the special features.  They are highly informative about how the film came together).

Our planet is displayed to us as if we had come from outer space to see it for the first time.  The film migrates from some truly astounding and spiritual nature shots in the first part of the film to hectic and sometimes disturbing civilization shots later in the film.  We go from clouds, mountain, and oceans to big cities with lots of people, buildings, traffic, and machinery. Some of the film is speeded up to show the flow of clouds (that looks like the ocean) and the flow of traffic (that looks like arteries).  Also, at times, the film is slowed down to study people and their faces as the try deal with the pace and density of things in the cities.  Add to this the unique Phillip Glass sound track, and you get the full effect of  the meaning of Koyaanisqatsi.

The Phillip Glass music is integral to the strange feel of the movie.  He, of course, is the guru of Minimalist Music, which sounds to me roughly like a morph of Classic Rock with Classical music (maybe Baroque).  It is repetitive, but in an engaging and powerful way, with enough variation to keep you into it -  which is hard to envision if you have not heard his music before. I like it very much.  Though it might not be for everybody, I think it really works for this movie.

711812,1,6303832563,"""Koyaanisqatsi"" is a pretentious ""man vs. nature"" film that is repetitive to the point of annoyance. It only presents the serenity of nature, and the worst of society, and evades the achievements of mankind, as well as the violence and shambles nature can create, without any human assistance.

The beginning and end of this film is in normal or slowed time (with much use of time-lapse photography), but the bulk of the film is a hyper journey through highways and downtown rush hours, at a dizzying pace. The music by Philip Glass is particularly irritating in this section, and its effect is like having a frenetic ice cream truck parked in front of your house for nearly an hour. The music for the rest of the film is a Hopi chant, and would be nice if it was a little more varied.

The scenes presented of human habitation are of dire slums, Las Vegas garishness, rusted machinery, etc. It is a never-ending parade of the most dreary and unattractive filmmaker Godfrey Reggio could find no doubt, in his search for images in which to despise his species, and particularly America. One has to ask, if technology and modern life are so evil, and we would be better off living in caves, how much fuel did Reggio waste making all that aerial photography?

The simplest review that I can offer to you is to simply watch this film.  Even if, having sat part-way through it, the images have not provoked thought, at least watch the film to its end.

Humans pour up and out of escalators as clouds over the sides of canyons.

711958,5,6303832563,"Following the end of this visionary film we are confronted with the following:

Ko-yaa-nis-qatsi (from the Hopi language), n.  1.  crazy life.  2.  life in turmoil.  3.  life out of balance.  4.  life disintegrating.  5.  a state of life that calls for another way of living.

Director/Producer Godfrey Reggio presented this film in 1983, a production that has more in common with the prophets of the Old Testament than anything else.  Reggio has looked deeply into modern technological society, and he is distressed by what he sees there.  The film is haunted by concepts, by books, by ideas, and at the end of the film he offers some of the intellectual inspirations for the movie.  First and foremost, there is the French protestant lay theologian Jacques Ellul, author of a host of books that reflect on human hubris before God and his Creation.  In an age where we associate evangelical religion with right wing politics, Ellul stands out as a stunning exception.  No one evinces greater religious devotion and genuine Christian humility than does Ellul, yet his study of the scriptures leads him to a conception of humans as called by God to be careful stewards of his creation, not exploiters and defilers of it.  Ellul also is disturbed by the way that modern consumer society, driven by ever-increasing dependence on technology, cuts human beings off from God, nature, and themselves.  Although Reggio cites no one particular work, the most relevant book by Ellul is unquestionably his classic THE TECHNOLOGICAL SOCIETY.  He also cites the French philosopher and filmmaker Guy Debord, whose own critique of consumer society he famously titled THE SOCIETY OF THE SPECTACLE.

The message of the film as taken from these thinkers suggests that we perhaps haven't ended up with quite the kind of world that we would have hoped, that we have in fact ended up with a pretty rotten state of things.  The point is established visually by simple methods:  a beginning section that shows marvelous scenes from unadulterated nature told in a style that underscores the majesty, the serenity, and the balance of nature.  The subsequent and larger portion of the film graphically depicts the frenetic, artificial, and unnatural essence of modern society.  Much of one's reaction to the film will be determined by attitudes one has formed prior to viewing.  During the 1980s, Reagan's notorious Secretary of the Interior James Watt (the same person who stated his conviction that we didn't need to worry much about preserving nature because he believed Jesus would return to earth before his grandchildren died) visited the Indiana Dunes National Seashore on the shore of Lake Michigan.  Instead of looking about and marveling at the massive dunes, he looked at the huge industrial masses visible along the shore in the distance, and praised the vitality of the industry he saw there.  Perhaps others will react similarly to this film, thinking that the depiction of the frayed, nutty nature of urban society is skewed and deceptive.  My own sense is that Reggio, Ellul, and Debord pretty much got things right.  We have somehow created a world that few of us have actually wished for.  On this I think Reggio is unquestionably right.  He offers no suggestions in this film about how to extricate ourselves from the mess we've gotten ourselves into.  He understands that the first step in curing a disease is for the patient to realize that he or she is sick.

The importance and influence of this film can hardly be overstated.  A vast number of the images of this film have become part of the visual language of modern cinema.  I would bet that few or no modern cinematographers have failed to study this film.  I remember seeing it when it first came out, being struck by the utter originality of almost every image.  Today, it feels far more familiar, but that is because of all the films that have assimilated his images.

The other star of the film is, of course, Philip Glass.  The score for this film easily goes down as one of Glass's greatest compositions.  In fact, except perhaps for his MUSIC IN TWELVE PARTS, there is no work by Glass that I can more enthusiastically recommend.  The only other two works that I love anywhere nearly as much are EINSTEIN ON THE BEACH and the opera he wrote to replace the soundtrack of Cocteau's BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.  Even if the film wasn't a stunning visual masterpiece, I could very strongly recommend this merely to listen to the music.  I'm almost tempted to say that this is the finest soundtrack in the history of film, though I would have to think about that for a bit.  Certainly no soundtrack stands so well on its own.  Just by itself, Glass's score is a masterpiece, but combined with the equally masterful visual images, this is an utterly unique multimedia experience.",1119139200,9,4825,4.857843137254902

Some of these reviews suggest the first part of the film was slow - I thought it was incredibly moving - beautiful streaming organic natural images set up to underlie and contrast with rectangular and linear man-made images later in the film.

Another stunning and connecting example of natural/man made image is the nose of the aircraft coming toward us - an intense complementary blue/orange abstact landscape painting. Wow.

I happened to see that it was playing on commercial-free television this evening and decided to take another look. I'm glad I did. While it is not now one of my favorite films, I'm going to go halfway to great and up my rating to three stars.

I'm not entirely sure why I enjoyed it this time. Perhaps I was less distracted; maybe I was in a better frame of mind... but the net result is that my opinion of the film has changed.

I found many of the scenes to be fairly interesting. For some reason, the quality-control lady in the Twinkie factory pulling what I assume to be ""bad"" Twinkies from the assembly line, somehow struck a chord with me. In this sped-up scene, the woman working appeared to be getting a rather aerobic workout as she grabbed the snacks and placed them into a discard area. However, she was still rather overweight. I couldn't help but think that perhaps her life was ""out of balance"" because she wasn't discarding ALL of the malformed Twinkies.

I also had to up my review because an anonymous reader of my original review had let me know that her dad was in the movie... a scene in NYC when a number of people were emerging from an elevator. I exchanged a couple of e-mails with this nice lady, and in viewing the film again... I think I spotted her dad! It might be kind of stupid --this is a COMPLETE stranger to me-- but in a weird way, it made the film a tiny bit more personal.

THE ORIGINAL REVIEW.... ENTITLED,

""PAINFUL""

Well, I might be bucking the trend of glowing reviews for this 22-year-old ""arthouse"" flic, but here goes:

While I recognize that the production was ahead of its time in 1982, and elements have been imitated over and over again --with very good results-- by many other filmmakers, I cannot in good conscience recommend this film.

When my wife and I sat down to watch it, we honestly didn't know what to expect. I had *heard* of the film, but didn't know what it was about. With apologies to Seinfeld, it is basically about nothing. Yes, it starts out with dramatic footage of beautiful scenery overlayed with some haunting music (Native Americans chanting ""Koyaanisqatsi"" over and over again), but my FIRST comment to my wife was: ""This looks like file footage.""

In my attempt to watch the movie without knowing anything about it first, I hadn't realized that it was 22 years old. It looked like file footage because it WAS essentially file footage. More to the point, the cinematography looks dated.

As the film continues, the beautiful natural scenery is supplemented by scenes that have been dramatically sped up, or dramatically slowed down... images of human activity are generally shown sped up. While some of these scenes were effective in conveying the idea of ""Life Out of Balance"" (which is what ""Koyaanisqatsi"" means), I thought that most of them were way too drawn out.

As for the soundtrack, unlike most people I absolutely love ambient electronic music. Most of the time. But not in this film.

Finally, I'll just say that my negative opinion of this film has nothing to do with a general dislike of 'artsy' films. I thought ""Winged Migration"" was wonderful. ""Whale Rider"" was fabulous. ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" was incredible.

I just thought ""Koyaanisqatsi"" was painful.",1109721600,2,3499,4.685154975530179
711962,5,6303832563,"Everyone obviously has taste and opinion, but simply put, this is my favorite movie of all time (altho, as at least one other reviewer mentioned, not as powerful as the big screen).  There is no film like it, except perhaps the Imax film Chronos (which is basically the eye candy with no substance) and possibly the sequel.  But those are only similarities in style of filmmaking, not in quality.

But I will say, while it's my favorite movie, I can only stand to watch it about every 5 years, because for about 3-4 days after watching Koyaanisqatsi, I can barely deal with this society.  It just makes me want to cry to drive on city streets.

So if you're already trying to come to grips with reality, this movie probably would be counter-productive.  But for everybody who thinks everything about modern western civilization truly is ""progress"", I couldn't recommend this film enough.

What it will be for those people, is a priceless perspective adjustment.  It won't make you permanently pessimistic or anything, it will just give you a new perspective.",1096416000,92,1058,4.838888888888889

It is unfortunate that so many people my age don't take time to seek out other things aside from whats on the surface of popular trends. The film is great because it lets you interpret it in any way you like. To me, it showed how nature is at a standstil in comparison to the constant move of human life and technology. Nature doesn't have to remodel or update every year to keep up with people. We have moved so high up above it we forget its there, and without it, we can't exist.

712032,4,6303832563,"It is hard to believe this movie is already over 20 years old. I remember seeing it on the big screen when it was first released. It was an unexpected experience to say the least. At the time, this movie left a strong impression on me, not simply a particular image or sequence, but rather the duality of the images and music. That duality is inherent throughout this movie; an observation made only on repeated viewing.
There is the obvious nature vs technology duality. In parallel, this duality can be expressed as god-made vs man-made. There are the old world vs the new world, Hopi cave drawings vs high-tech cinematography and music (the movie we are watching), communication by drawing with coal vs television commercials, ocean waves swelling and receding, cities rising and falling, deserts eroding while factories assemble cars and package massive amounts of food, insurpassable terrain and numerous roads, cars, and airplanes, the slow tide of nature and the fastlane happening all at once.  And in the midst of these dual forces is man, a product of the natural world creating the technological world. It is rather like the yin and yang, yang the primary color at present. Technology has usurped first place in defining the world around us and nature is merely a prelude. We are increasingly defined by our technological achievement rather than by our nature. We are gradually defined by our creation, perhaps as god is defined by us. Yet echoes of nature pulse within the concrete fortresses of our technolgy. The roads are like arteries pumping red and white cells to and fro, the factories generate food to help us survive, we record our deeds on film for posterity (the very movie we are watching is a testament of sorts),and we aspire to break free of gravity's tethers reaching for whatever lies ahead.
The director claims that this movie is meant to be a journey without making any value judgment. I believe we should take him at his word. Man is depicted becoming ruled by his own creation and neglecting, even destroying, his creator. It is never confirmed that this is a bad thing, but the implication is that balance between the natural and technological worlds is inevitable. Even the old world is fading, eroding away like the deserts, monument valley a cemetery of the ancient world. A day of judgment so to speak is in the making and technology will be forced to reckon with nature one way or another. People, despite their technological prowess will buckle under nature's creative supremacy and the inescapable cycle of creation and destruction. The Hopis understood this cycle and predicted an end to koyaanisqatsi. Of course, the Hopis are victims to the cycle themselves.
The media is the massage wrote Marshall Macluhan.  Koyaanisqatsi is an excercise of this idea.  The images and music move us, affect our perceptions of the world and ourselves on some level.  On a global scale, media is inseparable from everyday life and from our collective consciousness. Via images and sounds we are moved to act, and society moves along.  The cave drawings were the media-massage for the Hopis.  Koyaanisqatsi is our high-tech cave drawing. The Hopis idols are destroyed slowly with the desert, our idols will be destroyed in due time.  The only thing that never changes is change itself ... This seems to be the central theme of this movie, despite assertions there is no central theme.
Overall I like this movie. But, I think that Godfrey Reggio failed to create a balanced artistic statement. He says the movie is not an indictment of technology and I can see that he attempted an earnest effort to make a balanced statement. Nevertheless, my gut reaction (and many others' as well) when viewing this movie is ""what are we doing, what are we thinking, where are we going?""  There is an element of misanthrope in this movie that is unmistakeable and largely responsible for the ""environmentalist"" interpretation of the movie so popular among many viewers. This is because Mr. Reggio, in my opinion, didn't quite pull off what he intended. If he had, he wouldn't need to explain his intention or his method in interviews and essays. You never heard Stanley Kubrick explaining 2001: A Space Odyssey.
Regarding the format controversy I have only one comment to make.  See this movie whatever the format.  After you see it then argue which format is better.  I have seen both the 1.33:1 and 1.85:1 versions.  They are both good; my preference is wide rather than tall and this DVD is quite good.",1076889600,4,4516,4.873533246414603
712033,4,6303832563,"My interest in KOYA (Koyaanisqatsi) and the Qatsi trilogy was sparked after watching a video called ""Baraka"" (1993) filmed by Ron Fricke, who is also the DP for KOYA. Fricke, however is not the DP for POWA (""Powaqqatsi [1988]) or NAQO (Naqoyqatsi [2002]). I relate to this form of filmmaking (aka ""eye candy"") since I too am a visual person working in film media.
KOYA isn't for the movie- goer who uses movies to forget about the world and sit through 87 minutes of fantasy. Nor is it for the lover of explosions, chases and climactic scenes that most filmmakers and studio execs thrive on these days. There are implosions and explosions here. But what sets these apart is that it isn't make- believe. It is happening all the time, in our world right now, even though this movie was created in 1983. While mankind slowly takes control over the world, we see through Fricke's filming that we are actually out of control. And some people can feel rather uncomfortable having such images thrust in their faces.
Watch this DVD only when you've had sufficient rest. If you are at all sleepy (or restless, even), put the disc aside and find something else to do until your mind is clear and you're ready to commit your full attention to KOYA. Otherwise you won't be able to appreciate the film. Also, you may want to hold off watching KOYA if you are living with depression since this film does nothing to lift up one's spirit or offer a sense of hope at the end.
I think of KOYA (and the other films that Fricke embarked on) as a moving painting. So many people will gaze upon it and each one will have a different reaction to it. Look at the many different reviews that have been posted so far. And you'll see that in over 100 reviews posted for KOYA alone, each one is quite interesting and even unique. Some are rather passionate, even about what they feel is the correct film aspect ratio. Art has this same kind of effect. It can be either exquisite or trash. But no one is unmoved by KOYA (or the Qatsi trilogy or Baraka, for that matter). I can't predict if you'll like, hate, envy, despise, or even be born again. I can only tell you that you'll feel something. And you will look at things a little (or much more) differently that you do now.
The music by Philip Glass at times sounds outdated now (especially with KOYA being 20 years old). The strange thing, however, is that Philip's composition can sound more outdated than other electronic music has been composed years before his.
I give POWA 4 stars because it simply isn't a total success with its moments of weakness. I do suggest that you watch the ""qatsi"" trilogy in order; start with KOYA, then view Powaqqatsi (1988), and then complete your journey with Naqoyqatsi (2002). But no matter what, I urge you to consider ""Baraka,"" currently my favorite film of this type and what I consider an essential DVD. Fricke expanded his filming to capture an intimate vision of humanity (good and bad), adding this with nature and technology and capturing it all in 70mm true letterbox (2.35:1).
The DVD I have (I purchased the 2-DVD POWA/KOYA set) has not even a pamphlet in either DVD. There was a video with interviews of the director and composer, but I wished that the DVD had included an interview with Fricke.",1063497600,4,3269,4.561224489795919

If you have never seen this film, I suppose the way it is framed in this version might not really bother you, but if you actually CARE to see the film as was originally presented, THIS ISN'T IT!

I am not sure exactly HOW they managed to frame this transfer so poorly, but if ineptitude is a virtue, these folks go to the head of the class.

I won't get into the technical terms of aspect ratio, framing, and the like, but suffice it to say, this release LACKS a good amount of the original image.  The image on the screen might be presented in the original apsect, but the framing of that aspect was done in such a way as to ""zoom"" too far in, thus eradicating, in my estimation, approx. 15-20% of the original image.  In a film like Koyaanisqatsi, where the artist's framing of the image is so critical, changing the original image by framing it this way is unforgivable...well...maybe merely a waste of time and money.

The frustrating thing for me was that the ""full screen"" vhs release actually gives the viewer a closer approximation of the original!

I won't go on and on about it, but like I said before;  If you want the original, you're going to have to wait.  I suppose there is a laser disc version out there that is framed properly, but that's not really much help!

Save your dough!

<edit 2016>

I got into a brutal argument years ago with someone who worked on the last of the trilogy about the aspect ratio. I now understand what the deal was between all the formats, and, the simple explanation is that of the three version that are available, the IRE limited release, the MGM release, and the new blue ray, is that the IRE version, although not in widescreen shows the most visual information of the three. If you want to see comparisons of the three formats, this link is great; [...]

The long and the short is that, against all logic, the fullscreen version shows more of the film than the widescreen version.

712037,5,6303832563,"Life out of Balance
As Western Civilisation tears a path across Earth, it leaves the debris of its construction scattered over the surface of the planet. America's `purple mountained majesty' and `spacious skies' have fallen to strip mines and heavily patrolled air space. Biological evolution has become irrelevant, replaced by the manipulation of our environment and genetic modification. We are rapidly constructing a civilisation of destruction. We have raped the earth of her beauty and replaced it with towers of corporate power and industrial wastelands. We have dehumanised ourselves, disconnected of earth itself we lose all identity as human creatures and are now but the interchangeable parts of a global machine.
It is the horror of what we have become that forms the core of Godfrey Reggio's Koyaanisqatsi. By juxtaposing the cool tranquillity of nature against the frantic rat race of man, Reggio demonstrates to us just how far we are removed from our origins. Unlike the desert calm or rolling clouds, we are the violent actions of Earth. Volcanoes, we erupt upon the surface, creating havoc and destroying all that lie in our path. Reggio prompts us to ask ourselves why we are what we have become.
Koyaanisqatsi, despite dating to 1983, is still highly relevant. It's timeless. It transcends the barriers of language, relying only upon images and music to transmit its message. The message is sometimes confused, hidden behind a faade of beauty, but it is in this faade that the message is found. The juxtaposition of nature's beauty against man's hideous creations is intended to reveal our true nature. Our awesome construction projects, the very indicator of our power, are ugly. The fabric of our society, the web we weave, is weak. Every inch we raise ourselves above what is considered base, is merely another inch for us to fall.
Reggio's film is a cinematic masterpiece. Each shot is beautifully composed, offering us new perception into the world we spend our every waking moment in. However, it is in the manipulation of the images that the message is created. By under and over cranking the camera, Reggio changes not only our visual perception but also our relationship with time. He is able to isolate people on the crowded streets of New York and Los Angeles, slowing the rush of a nine to five existence. The sense of worthlessness is overwhelming, these individuals are lost amongst the masses, one of millions who crowd the streets. Yet for a few brief seconds this individual is bought to a near halt, immortalised on celluloid. It demonstrates the very banality of modern human existence. Humanity strives for immortality is some form or another, but in our very quest we have wrought our own destruction.
Humanity's zenith has passed. In the final shot of the film, one which lasts several minutes, we watch a shuttle launch into space. Space exploration, man's greatest achievement, becomes a metaphor for its creator. As the craft rises above the earth it carries the hopes of a species. It is majestic, the pinnacle of technology, the culmination of 100 000 years of modern human existence. However, like man, the craft is doomed for failure. As the explosion tears the craft apart, so are the dreams of man strewn across the empty sky. The camera follows a piece of flaming debris as it falls to earth. This is our fate. As Lucifer fell from heaven, so must man fall from grace.
The film attempts to illustrate the flaws of man. In our success lies our failure. It does not advocate any cause or lifestyle, it merely informs us of who we are and what we will become of our future should we continue as we are.",1052956800,,3651,4.89983844911147
712038,3,6303832563,"Hi, I've known this film for 10 years now (being 30) and it's probably my top all-time favourite. But it's rather difficult to secure a copy (let alone enjoying any theater presentation or TV broadcasting!) so I was soooo glad it came out on dvd! I bought it even before I had a player! I'm glad I did, even though my present player is Zone 2 only!
However I agree that this dvd is not very good quality. The image is unprecise, the flow is jerky, and the sound (Philip Glass's score, ever so demanding on sound quality!!) is poor. Were these drawbacks already present on the vhs version? Or in the original film itself? I wonder. As for aspect ratio, I fully trust frankenberry and join in calling for a truthfull rendering of Ron Fricke's art work.
When will we get a remastered, affordable (and Zone 1 + Zone 2 releases!) dvd??
Yet all in all, it's still the only one available: so buy it anyway. No matter how (rather) disappointing the quality may be to the original film, if you like it you just have to have your own copy so you can watch it every week, or every night, or every hour-and-a-half in your life!!
G. Reggio's and Ph. Glass's interviews are interesting too: they shed additional light on the work, without demythifying the work of art in any way. It *is* a spiritual and esthetical experience.",1052784000,2,1312,4.470833333333333

This film is a must-have for anyone who likes minimalism, loud music, bold new cinematic ideas, clever juxtaposition of images (the airplane on the freeway is my favorite), or just plain old good art. That's really all this is - art as beautiful as any Beethoven symphony or Rembrandt painting. And you don't have to buy into Reggio's culture-condemning worldview to appreciate the movie, either; as one critic said, the speed shots of hectic city life are almost exultant, celebratory.
So go out and buy this film. I've heard there are issues with the DVD version, so it might be wise to stick with VHS for now.",1052265600,,945,4.839506172839506
712159,5,6303832563,"The first of Godfrey Reggio's finally finished trilogy, Koyaanisqatsi, is a visually-stunning non-narrative film depicting a life and world out of balance.  Koyaanisqatsi is a Hopi word meaning one of five things:  ""crazy life, life in turmoil, life disintegrating, life out of balance, and a state of life that calls for another way of living.""  After watching this film, one will definitely see all five definitions painfully applicable.
Basically, the first fifteen to twenty minutes of the film has some wonderful shots of the desert, waterfalls, geologic formations, clouds billowing so close it's as if one's inside them, and aerial photography that makes one appreciate the landscape.
The rest of the movie then shows the human side.  Caterpillar tractors lay out pipes, dotting the landscape with a network of electric towers, resembling wire framework travesties of men, power plants billowing steam and smoke smack in the middle of the desert, atomic tests in the desert, nuclear plants... abominations invading the environment.  Rivers have been stopped by dams.  And the military testing in the desert does nothing more than pollute the ground and air with explosions.
Switch over to the big city and the 12 lane highways, with its network of overpasses, byways, merging lanes, cars moving bumper to bumper, passing each other.  Then we see the decrepit slums, abandoned projects, which are then blown up, slowly sinking to the ground in clouds of dust.
The time-lapse photography of people milling in line for subway tickets, eating, bowling, playing video games, etc. shows the city as the organism, streets, entrances and exits as blood vessels, humans as the blood cells.  The night scenes of traffic, with white and red dashes zipping is very telling, as is the cycle of traffic going, stopping, going, stopping at each signal light.  Later on, the speed of the film goes quicker, to demonstrate the quickening rate and insanity of human consumption, waste, and stress.  Is this really worth living for, I ask you?
There are some images that are analogous.  An aerial view of the concrete jungle, at what we've created, is replaced by an infrared satellite photo, then a closeup of a computer chip, showing the inputs going into multiplexers and demultiplexers, coming out as outputs.  It shows how mechanized we have become compared to the more serene, less chaotic ways of nature, going in one way, going out through another.  Another is a shot of sausages being cranked out, followed by people moving up escalators.  Notice the similarity?
The most telling shots of the thousands of people in New York, Los Angeles, or San Francisco is that they don't look very happy at all, but for them, it's what they know, what they are, part of this mechanized, corporate world.
The translation of Hopi prophecies sung in the movie follow the conclusion, and they are sobering and chilling:  ""If we dig precious things from the land, we will invite disaster.""  ""Near the Day of Purification, there will be cobwebs spun back and forth through the sky.""  ""A container of ashes might one day be thrown from the sky, which could burn the land and boil the oceans.""
Philip Glass's score, which alternates from frenetic synthesizers during the time-lapse footage and elegiac sobriety in the slo-mo shots, adds to this one-of-a-kind movie.  However, this is best seen on the big screen for maximum impact.",1047168000,46,3407,5.053571428571429
712160,5,6303832563,"Koyaanisqatsi is an audiovisual time capsule. It shows America at a time of great transition--with microcomputers, global outsourcing, and technology on the brink of relegating the American worker to obsolescence. Filmed between 1977 and 1982, Koyaanisqatsi takes place on the doorstep of automation. Throughout the film, and especially during ""The Grid"" sequence, we observe several examples of the outmoded 1970s economy:
1) Pontiac TransAms being assembled by factory workers. Car assembly has been mostly automated.
2) TVs being assembled by American workers. I can't name a single company that still manufactures TV's in the US.
3) Thousands of workers streaming from a Lockheed plant--a vestige of Cold War military build-up.
4) Letters being visually inspected by US postal workers. Text recognition technolgy has since automated this process.
Koyaanisqatsi contains many shots of corporations/businesses that are defunct or on the verge of bankruptcy. Examples from the film include:
1) K-Mart: the film contains two tracking shots of K-Mart cash registers. K-Mart filed for bankruptcy in 2001.
2) United Airlines: During ""Vessels,"" we view two UA 747-200s taxiing at LAX (accompanied by Philip Glass's sublime score). Today, UA is undergoing a massive corporate restructuring.
3) Chemical Bank: The Grand Central Station sequence contains a shot of Chemical Bank ""Express"". What ever happened to Chemical Bank?
I agree with the reviewer who claims that Koyaanisqatsi is an ode to-not indictment of-modern technology. However, most of what we see in the film, especially during ""The Grid"" sequence, is no longer modern by today's standards. During ""The Grid,"" we experience a spellbinding time-lapse ride along the Embarcadero Freeway in San Francisco, which was subsequently demolished in the name of new urbanism. For any fan of modernity (in the late 1970s and early 1980s sense), Koyaanisqatsi is essential viewing.",1045440000,7,1927,5.580204778156997
712161,5,6303832563,"After I unwrapped this DVD, I re-played it constantly throughout the day.  This is the most addictive DVD I've ever owned.  The whole point of this film is to take things that form the background of modern life (landscapes, industry, technology, transportation, etc.) and bring them squarely into the foreground.  The musical score contributes heavily to this process.  The opening sequence, which switches from Anasazi pictographs to an ultra-slow-motion closeup view of a Saturn-V liftoff, has an almost religious feel to it.  Koyaanisqatsi was made over a period of about 6 years and was released in 1983.  Many aspects of this film have been imitated in movies, television, and advertising since then.  However, few people have actually seen this masterpiece, and it was nearly impossible to get ahold of prior to this recent DVD release.",1045440000,7,842,5.192592592592592
712162,5,6303832563,"Koyaanisqatsi opens with stately, wide-angle shots of mesa fields and clouds.  The world they depict is vast, uninhabited, almost unearthly.  This continues for about a quarter of the movie's length, lulling you into a pastoral reverie.  Then suddenly the Philip Glass score becomes more insistent and earthmovers loom up from out of nowhere.  Man has arrived, and he's up to no good.  What began as ode to unspoiled nature becomes eerie urban dystopia, a montage of slums, factories, and city streets through which hordes of people scuttle in speeded-up motion.  (Is ""koyaanisqatsi"" also the Hopi word for ""time-lapse photography""?)  In the final sequence a rocket roars off the launch pad only to explode in mid-air, and the camera follows a burning engine as it tumbles Icarus-like back to earth.  Then, just in case we've somehow missed the point, the title of the film appears on a black background along with its translation: ""a way of life that calls for another way of living"".
The great thing is, it's entirely possible to miss the point.  Director Godfrey Reggio is too inspired a cinematographer for his own good.  The sumptuousness of his images keeps undercutting the film's ham-fisted man-as-spoiler message and replacing it with something subtler and more humane.  Though the opening landscape shots are beautiful in a National Geographic sort of way, the movie only gets going after it moves into the city.  The most distinctive part of Koyaanisqatsi is its time-lapse footage of man-made environments: images of headlights racing down freeways, office building windows blinking on and off, and crowds streaming through Grand Central Station.  In the last of these, it seems that all this speed is supposed to be dehumanizing, to make people look like insects, but instead the bustle is jittery and comic, like an old silent film.  Crowds that might have been anonymous if filmed at normal speed become individuated as your eye is drawn around, frantically making note of all the faces, gaits, and endearingly bad late-seventies hairstyles.  You're literally people watching, and the effect is a humanist one, warm and oddly touching.
There's a similar happy misstep in the depiction of technology.  Roughly speaking, progress is this bad guy in Reggio's world, with the role of progress played by cities.  (As opposed to pristine mesa fields and cloudscapes.)  Unfortunately for Reggio, urban settings are stubbornly cinematic.  Try to make a beautiful movie about an ugly city and you'll end up making your city look beautiful.  (Blade Runner and Metropolis had the same problem.)  Though Koyaanisqatsi's official position is a sort of anti-technological moralism, Reggio (like so many moralizers) ends up making the thing he condemns more compelling than the thing he praises.  Sprawl has never looked so appealing.  Even a side trip into a processed cheese factory is less a swipe at consumer society than a welcome bit of comic relief.  Reggio's cityscapes are so strange and vibrant that it seems worth paving over a little nature to have built them.  Koyaanisqatsi may have been conceived as an ecological warning, but it ends up being a love letter to skyscrapers.",1044144000,10,3188,5.14368932038835

712165,2,6303832563,"Someone thinks I may have mistaken IMAX 15/70 for standard 4X3??
No way!  My apartment neighbor here in town is an IMAX projectionist. Koyaanisqatsi has never been released in IMAX 15/70, nor has it ever been screened in *any* form at our three IMAX theaters, so I don't understand how I could possibly have confused the two. I grew up on 4X3 films, and was about 8 years old when the first widescreen films started making the rounds. By now, I believe I've viewed every widescreen process there is, including 3-projector Cinemiracle (which was only ever used for one film: ""Windjammer""). As a person who has spend almost 4 decades of his life involved in virtually every form of legitimate theater from fringe to grand opera, I'm also pretty familiar with such topics as matting, masking and cropping.
I'm glad that the writer from Poulsbo, the projectionist, was able to say with certainty that he ran a 16X9 (1.85:1) Koyaanisqatsi print. I'd have loved to have been there. But I will reiterate what I said a few months ago: the Koyaanisqatsi print I saw here about 10 years ago was 4X3 (1.33:1), no possible exception. I'd watched it on laserdisc many times and was *very* curious what differences would turn up on a large screen. There were none.  None.  The image appeared exactly the way one would expect a 4X3 image to look when it's thrown up on a contemporary wide screen: an almost-square postage-stamp of a picture smack-dab in the center, reaching all the way from top to bottom, with the side curtains drawn way, way in.
The other thing about these home video releases that I've found particularly galling since the audio. As one other writer put it, the current MGM DVD 5.1 mix sounds like expanded 2-channel. I agree, but it wasn't that way in the theater. The surround sound was solid and highly directional, with the synthesizer clearly jangling away at you through the rear speakers. I say again, this MGM DVD could have been SOOOO much better!
Now, here's a question I don't think anybody has yet asked. Koyaanisqatsi is sometimes done in concert format, with live music by the Philip Glass Ensemble. Has anybody ever attended one of these things? If you have extremely *clear* memories of what you saw and heard, and would like to share, I, for one, would be absolutely delighted to hear from you.  :-)

712166,4,6303832563,"Koyaanisqatsi is not at all your typical film. It has no plot, no actors, no dialogue. Yet it carries a strong message through a visual barrage of beautiful cinematography and accompanying music by composer Philip Glass.
I had been curious about this film for some time, so I finally checked it out expecting to be bored by it but kept an open mind. I broke my usual rule of no drinking when watching a movie for the first time and had a few shots of tequila, then settled into Koyaanisqatsi. Right from the start as the naturalistic images washed over me, I felt them carry me away. Each image gave way to another, juxtaposed to compare or contrast with the shot before it. Eventually the naturalistic visuals gave way to city and technology, the shots becoming more and more fast paced. And the music fully enhanced the experience, making each view come even more alive. Of course I was somewhat drunk too. But that state only seemed to enhance the film, rather then detract as is usually the case. Without dialogue or plot, my condition helped me let me take in the underlying message of technology creeping into life, taking away individuality and ruining peoples lives. Of course that's just my interpretation, the beauty of this film is it means something different to everyone who watches.
This film is, of course, by no means something everyone will enjoy. Most mainstream viewers would find it utterly boring. To be honest, near the end when the alcohol began to wore off, I was beginning to lose a bit of interest too. But in the proper reflective mood, this film almost works as therapy. And if accompanied by a few drinks, can become eye opening. Definitely worth while if intrigued by the idea.

712259,5,6303832563,"Koyaanisqatsi is a landmark film, a modern rejoinder to old silent cinema conceived and executed with all the subtlety of a modern technological assault. Images and sound alone convey some essence of human existence.
Life in the lens of Koyaanisqatsi moves in slow motion, drifting in near stasis only to quickly shift to incredibly high speeds, moments are filled with hours of images condendsed in seconds of time and strangely enough that when a scene presents itself in real time it becomes almost unreal. The velocity or stillness in the film do not become exaggerations but acquire a new dynamic of seeing and perceiving the very ordinary in an extraordinary manner.
Many of us have waited for the DVD with much anticipation, wondering at times if it would ever be released at all. I have mixed reactions about the DVD, not so much with the images which are brilliant and more colorful than I remember them being when the film was originally released in the theaters (which was a long time ago indeed). Images are bright clear and focused. The DVD is in Wide-Screen format but it is 4:3 Letterbox and not 16:9 ratio. Sound is the only flaw in this DVD release and a definite disappointment it is. The DVD release is in 5.1 Dolby Digital and has great presence and fidelity, however, the first 30 minutes of the soundtrack seems to be mixed away from the voices and more pronounced on the accompanying instrumentation. This is bothersome for those who have the Audio CD and are all-too-familiar with how the soundtrack should replay. Considering the important coordinate film-music dichotomy, I would have thought that greater care would have been taken in mastering the soundtrack.
Taken as a whole it is still a wonderful package. Images even more vibrant and beautiful than I remember. The soundtrack is mostly very good with sections that do not live up to the original theatrical soundtrack, but those sections are relatively few and should not detract from the overall greatness of one of the most original and ingenious films ever produced.
Also comes with an extra bonus film ""Essence of Life"" which consists of interviews with Godfrey Reggio and Philip Glass. A very good supplement with worthy insights from both Glass and Reggio on the nature and message of the film.",1033689600,,2283,4.88659793814433

712261,5,6303832563,"I love pushing peoples buttons, but I very much *dislike* spreading misinformation. Since my post of September 16, questioning the 1.85:1 aspect ratio of the new MGM DVD release of Koyaanisqatsi, a few people have written in to either contradict me or uphold me. Over the weekend, I sent an e-mail to the Institute for Regional Education in Santa Fe, requesting a first-hand clarification of the matter. I received a reply bright and early this morning (Sept. 30), e-signed by Joe Beirne, Producer, Naqoyqatsi. His reply won't award the blue ribbon in this debate to any one person, but each of us will receive a piece of it to take home. I summarize:
1) Koyaanisqatsi was always intended by director Godfrey Reggio, and the cinematographers, to be shown theatrically in 1.85:1 widescreen. This was the way it was shown at its premiere in 1983 at Radio City Music Hall, New York City.
2) The decision to create a 1.33:1 Academy aperture (4:3) version was made at the time of the *first telecast* on the grounds that a pan-and-scan approach would yield ludicrous results to the film on typical home sets of the time. Fortunately, the way Koyaanisqatsi was shot, they were able to ""open up"" the picture to full-television-screen size 4:3 (1.33:1), and every subsequent home video version was brought out employing that particular ratio.
3) With the improvements made in television sets in recent years, chiefly the rise in popularity of widescreen sets and the ability to display widescreen films adequately in the home, the decision was made this time around to take advantage of the new technology and bring out Koyaanisqatsi (and Powaqqatsi) in the aspect ratio in which they were meant to be viewed theatrically in the first place.
4) Which is the ""correct"" version? On that matter I will let Mr. Beirne himself speak:
""I don't mean to imply that the 4x3 image in earlier transfers is somehow 'invalid'. I think this way of watching the films is very interesting. It is a mark of how carefully crafted were these films that both ratios work very well. However, in no sense is the viewer of the MGM DVDs 'losing' something by watching the films as they are shown as a motion picture, at 1.85, anymore than the audience was 'missing something' watching the premier of KOYAANISQATSI at Radio City Music Hall in 1983.""
I *hope* that settles this debate? BOTH home video versions of Koyaanisqatsi have the blessing the IRE as being equally valid. One last word from Mr. Beirne:
""PS The Private issue DVD is no longer available, sorry.""
(My own PS and ""last word"" - I still prefer Koyaanisqatsi in 4:3)",1033344000,26,2598,4.814317673378076
712262,5,6303832563,"The issue with the aspect ratio of the MGM DVDs of KOYAANISQATSI and POWAQQATSI has come up here and on the Amazon website, among other places.  As a producer and technical advisor on the third Qatsi film, while I was not directly involved in the process of manufacturing these DVDs, I was well aware of the decision-making behind that process. I can say definitively that the 1:1.85 aspect ratio (letter-boxed) on the MGM DVDs accurately reflects the author's intentions and reproduces the original theatrical aspect ratio of the projected films.
KOYAANISQATSI and POWAQQATSI were both principally photographed in the 1980s, when widescreen television was a vague idea somewhere off in the future and a large picture tube was 27"" across.  While conceived as theatrical features, both films were shot with consideration of possible television broadcast, which at that time was almost exclusively full-frame 1:1.33 (4x3). The alternative to ""protecting"" for 4x3 by composing the image to work well in full frame would have been to ""pan and scan"" the widescreen image when transferred to videotape for home video release and TV broadcast.
I am sure that anyone who has seen KOYAANISQATSI and POWAQQATSI would agree the pan and scan approach would have yielded a ludicrous result for these films: for this reason when the films have been broadcast they are presented in  the full ""academy"" aperture of 4x3, showing _more_of the original film frame than was shown in the theater.  And when video transfers of the films were made prior to the MGM DVD they were also made 1:1.33. This reflected the conventional practice at the time, when very few films were transferred to video wide-screen.
However in the past few years there has been a markedly increased interest in wide-screen home video and the the technical means to display wide-screen video adequately in the home has become commonplace, arising chiefly from the popularity of larger displays.  Reflecting this new environment the decision was taken now  to release the films on DVD in their original 1:1.85 aspect ratio.  I repeat that this image is exactly as originally intended by the director, Godfrey Reggio and the cinematographers.
I don't mean to imply that the 4x3 image in earlier transfers is somehow ""invalid"".  I think this way of watching the films is very interesting.
It is a mark of how carefully crafted were these films that both ratios work very well. However, in no sense is the viewer of the MGM DVDs ""losing"" something by watching the films as they are shown as a motion picture, at 1.85, anymore than the audience was ""missing something"" watching the premier of KOYAANISQATSI at Radio City Music Hall in 1983.

That is how simply and profoundly this film communicates its portrait of our world. I first saw it as a rental in the 80s; my Dad somehow thought it was a science fiction film. But as we watched it, we were absolutely mystified and awed. Yes, its message is obvious, but seeing this film one is confronted with the beauty of our world and the horrific excess of human civilization in a unique way. The Philip Glass score is wonderful and highly appropriate (I enjoyed his music in this setting far more than I ever did on its own), and the time-lapse sequences, particularly toward the end, are dizzying and bewildering. While one is struck by how dated many of the images of American society are - looking back on the early eighties - and one is aware that many environmental abuses have since been tamed somewhat, one also realizes that little has changed fundamentally in the past two decades, and that many things the film depicts merely hint at developments which are now seemingly insurmountable problems.

712266,3,6303832563,"As many already know, MGM's new DVD of ""Koyaanisqatsi"" is incorrectly hard-matted to an aspect ratio of 1.85:1 which IS NOT, and I repeat, NOT the correct aspect ratio for the film.  Shot in full-frame 4:3, the film was obviously intended to be seen in 4:3 and WAS theatrically shown in 1.33:1 - I personally saw the film 3 times theatrically in Los Angeles upon it's original theatrical release (twice at the Plitt in Century City (a premiere cinema at the time) and once at the Royal Theatre on the westside.  All presentations were 1.33:1 and NOT 1.85:1.  It was distinctly obvious that the presentation  was 1.33:1 upon it's theatrical release with much head room and unusually open scope to top and bottom, not this atrocious fake matting that MGM has now decided to instigate on their new disc.  It destroys many scenes that are WAY too cropped - and this is NOT the intended format of the director as many may think.
Godfrey Reggio oversaw the limited edition ""members-only"" DVD that IRE put out a couple of years ago to anyone who contributed $180+ to their cause to clear up the legal issues for the film. That disc was the original full-frame (no fake matting) version of the film and was identical to the way the film was originally theatrically presented.  Reggio apparently oversaw the production of that disc and approved it - even personally signing the sleeve each one came in.  Would he approve his own personally produced DVD with the wrong aspect ratio of his own film?  I think not.
Who came up with this idea that the film was theatrically shown in 1.85:1?  It wasn't shown that way in Los Angeles, that's for sure.  I understand the whole ""matting/not matting"" issue as far as some films shot open but are intended to be seen matted, but this is not one of those cases.  ""Koyaanisqatsi"" was shot and intended to be seen open and MGM's disc is an atrocity to Ron Fricke's cinematography, cropping out important information from top and bottom.
I am glad I didn't sell off my IRE disc of the film in anticipation of this new MGM release.  The IRE disc will now be even more valuable to film fans and collectors - and any TRUE ""Koyaanisqatsi"" fan will most likely NEED to locate one of those IRE discs now if they want to have the film as it was INTENDED to be seen.
MGM should have put both versions of the film on the disc if they were so adamant about including a ""widescreen"" print just to appease fans who always think widescreen is ""right"".  Well, in this case, they have basically released a pan-and-scan version of the film, but a vertical pan-and-scan instead of the usual horizontal.  A true disappointment all around.

712407,5,6303832563,"If you've never seen this one, you're in for a truly unique experience. No dialogue, no characters, no conventional plot. Music. Images. Hear me out, here!! The film starts off with nature shots against a slow tapestry of horns and winds. Eventually, we interfuse the nature shots with those of technology; dumptrucks working the land, airplanes in the sky. Eventually, the photography and music get faster and more electric, till we wind up with images of New York City streets sped up 200% give or take. Behind this is the grandest, most energetic and spectacular music Philip Glass has ever composed, bringing us to a pinnacle of sublime excitement.  Atlthough there's no 'plot' to give away, I will not give you the ending lest you lose the fun of EXPERIENCING IT FOR YOURSELVES!!

  Of course, if anyone but Godfrey Reggio and Philip Glass had done this film, it would've been disappointing. After all, we've all seen Baraca. Nature images, music; still, this is the original. So many films, just like Baraca, have imitated this one and even after one viewing, it will not be hard to see why! Although, on the 'DVD speical feature' interview, Reggio did offer one peice of advice for viewing. He mentioned that if, while watching, the viewer is asking herself why she's watching this, she will not enjoy it. So, yes, I suppose it takes 30 or so minutes to warm up to- as these are the slowest moments of the film, both visually and musically- but once you're there, it may just capture you!!
  One complaint about the DVD. The music, even though touched up from the original soundtrack has WAY too much reverb. On the 'vessels' cue, the keyboard reverb COMPLETELY drowns out the vocal. I listened back to my CD soundtrack and even that doesn't have but half the reverb of the film. Although it doesn't come close to ruining the film, it's definitely a pain. Here's a minor gripe. The Philip Glass Ensemble redid the soundtrack in 1998 and I know they toured with it that year, playing it synced up to the original film. I was REALLY hoping they would actually use the new soundtrack, as it would line up perfectly. They did not. Instead, we have to learn to live with the old one laced with careless reverb. Oh, well!! For all that, still five stars!!",1032480000,5,2256,4.670025188916877
712408,4,6303832563,"First, I have to say I'm a bit disappointed in the print quality of the DVD version - quite a few scenes show evident wear and tear on the print used. I have to keep reminding myself though, that this movie was made TWENTY years ago... the negative and master prints have certainly had quite an adventure during the past 2 decades. (If ever there was a perfect argument for film protection and preservation, Koyaanisqatsi is IT.)
I'm also wondering about the aspect ratio. It seems incorrect at 1.85:1 - I could've sworn I've seen a version that was 2.35:1, but since it's been so long since I've actually seen the film, perhaps I'm mistaken. If however, this is not the full aspect ratio, then that's a ridiculous choice by the DVD makers - I mean, fans of a movie like this are the LAST people on earth who would be ""scared off"" by wide letterboxing, something the studios still seem to think consumers are terrified of.
Ok, so how about the movie itself? Koyaanisqatsi came out the year I graduated from high school, and it was an extreme influence on me (and others - it's become quite legendary and has been name checked countless times everywhere from MST3K to The Simpsons). But after not seeing it for well over 10 years, how did it affect me when I watched it last night?
Hmm. Maybe for the very reason it's become such an icon, it was just a bit of a letdown. On a superficial level, I am AMAZED at how much has changed in just 20 years. Many things in the film are downright quaint now - the cars, the hairdos, the fashions, the huge old mainframe computers, Ms Pac-Man, billboard ads for Betamax players! And MAN, Times Square really was totally squalorous, wasn't it!?
On a deeper level, one of the inadvertent profundities of Koyaanisqatsi is that, in watching it now, the relentless march of time is all too apparent. When compared to the mountains of Arizona or the layers of the Grand Canyon, everything we do as a civilization seems thoroughly disposable. 5000 years - big whoop.
One thing that hasn't changed is our relentless consumption of the planet's natural resources, and that's only accelerated since the early 80's. We were all well aware of the risks we were taking with the environment back then and we knew we had some difficult choices to make. The decision of the majority since 1983? Buy a 12-mpg SUV, build a McMansion and participate in adding another billion people to the world's population. Good going.
OK, I'll get off my soapbox and back on the subject at hand :-) Koyaanisqatsi is still quite marvelous to behold - one thing that I've built an appreciation for over the years is how important EDITING is, and Koyaanisqatsi is BRILLIANTLY edited. And last but certainly not least is the absolutely astonishing music by Philip Glass - it can stand-alone from the film as a separate work of art. ""The Grid"" portion of the soundtrack is, in my mind, one of the towering achievements of 20th century music. (I can highly recommend the 1998 recording of the soundtrack which is even better than the version made for the film.)",1032307200,10,3061,4.618348623853211

While difficult to describe, much less spell, Koyaanisqatsi is a visual explosion of images coupled with a fantastic soundtrack thanks to Phillip Glass.
You will see references to this movie in everything from car commercials to the Simpsons (which has a direct reference to the movie). Therefore it is, in my humble opinion, a watershed movie. Watch this movie, then make your friends watch it.",1022889600,,638,4.756756756756757
712416,5,6303832563,"Well, I must get on the bandwagon of 5 starz yeasayers on this generally overlooked, unique, and unsung hero of the otherwise vast film wasteland.  The perfect example of pictures being worth a thousand words; a million in this case.
I first saw Koyaanisqatsi on a local PBS station, and also borrowed a copy (tape) from my local library (I believe they still possess it).  I have picked up both the vinyl and c-disc versions of the Glass soundtrack music.  Being a superhype standing alone; the score coupled with the in-your-face documentary images of the film together produce a transcendental experience.  Figuring that the length of the film is only 87 minutes, we feel as if we've witnessed a full-blown epic-length opus.
I was elated to see so many high-praise reviews from the Amazon faithful.  Since I'm 118th, there isn't much else I can add to what's already been pointed out.  Maybe movie retailers should peruse all this testimony, then smarten up and (re)-release this specimen of organic social comment on all available media.",1021852800,5,1041,4.954022988505747

The film also works as a reflection of our relationship with nature and the way human beings are dramatically changing the planet for the worse.

Then I got to hear Phillip Glass perform live, with the film in the background, in  Washington DC.  I have been absolutely astounded by the film each of the  four or five times total I have seen it and have fervently wished to have  it on video.  I have checked lots of places and have only a few leads to  show for it.  But last night, 7-26-99, I heard a BBC interview saying that  it WAS being re-released.  It was infuriatingly short on details,  naturally, but hopefully we'll start to see things show up on web searches  soon. If you have info, please contact me at thomahal@yahoo.com.

I sure would like  to get to the bottom of why it's no longer being made and available. I  recall the splendid way the camera went from the natural scenery to the  hustle & bustle of the cities using slow-motion & fast-motion  cinemaphotography, particularly of the rocket launch and the moonrise. Just  an awesome documentary showing God's creation contrasting with man's  creation, the 'life out of balance' paradox!!

The unbelievable images, in perfect timing with Glass's hypnotic music, leave the viewer in awe. This film asks the question of  whether technology, as it has progressed, is benevelent in the long term.  Reggio and Glass's perspective on this question is obvious to those who see  the statement they make. The underlying message, which one must take from  the viewing of this film is the hard fact that life, especially urban life,  has become ""out of balance."" The director portrays a time when  electronic development, production, technology and the pace of people is so  fast that we end up missing life all together. For if we continue on this  path, we would reach a point where we would cease to be human at all. One  of the best films I have ever seen!",917654400,2,851,4.695945945945946

Since then, its images retain their power, but the technique has greatly improved, as has this particular narrative style (Baraka is the best example so far). Reggio, Fricke and  Glass have put together a wonderful film, full of life and sharp criticism.  Unfortunately, the criticism can be heavyhanded at times, but that doesn't  negate the power of the visuals and the music. Personally, I've worn out  three video tapes, seen it twice in the theater, once with the Philip Glass  Ensemble. Get it if you can!",917481600,,553,4.903225806451613

7853313,5,6303832563,"Like many other reviewers here, I too saw this in the theater in '83ish.
I remember, after the film was over, I sat there in silence for a time, afraid to make a sound for fear of breaking the trance. This lasted only a moment and when I realized what I was doing I looked around to see that I wasn't the only one, just... sitting there.
I am not a ""deep-thinker"" by any stretch, but I honestly felt something by the story I was just told through no dialogue at all.

Since '83 I have seen many other visually appealing videos of the same type of things. Slow-motion clouds, waterfalls and time-lapse city streets all in Super 4K and HD. I oohed and ahhed over them, sure, but, I have never felt the story behind the videos as I did with this film.
When describing this film to someone, I try not to say that there is no dialogue. There is no ""spoken"" dialogue but this film speaks volumes directly to your subconscious.

Reading the comments about the quality of the film and I can't help but feel a sense of... whatever word best fits here lol... The film speaks of nature vs technology throwing life out of balance. However we are criticizing the technology of the film to todays Ultra 4K/HD. Someone please come up with the right word for me :)

That being said, I would love to see this redone in 4K :)

Please, if you have never watched this film, give it a shot. Watch it alone or with a quiet friend with no distractions and just allow yourself to be absorbed into the story. Like it or not, you will have at least experienced something unique.",1520812800,,1552,4.304794520547945
