8350997,5,B00256VWUY,"excellent movie.  good to see a nice story filmed well.
did miss the flesh that didn't make it to DVD from what i read in a
review of the film version.  johnron tanada is doing well with his acting, as well as ray-an dulay.
everyone else did a great job also.",1243814400,3,259,4.0588235294117645
