8294525,5,B001DQDB6U,"videos done well, clear and concise. would purchase other videos by this seller",1514764800,,79,5.153846153846154
8294526,5,B001DQDB6U,"Techniques in this DVD are pretty advanced.. I would say more on the lines of 'easy expert' on up.. at least in my state clubs levels.  But hey if your advanced and want to get better than this is what you need..

Instruction is very clear and the demonstrations are great!  But do consider buying the lower level DVD first if can't do the basics (front/rear hopping, wheelie, splatter, Jap zap) that type stuff..",1459900800,,413,4.554054054054054
8294527,5,B001DQDB6U,"he teaches combinations of lessons learned in his first video. Must see that to use this one. He uses a mortal advanced student as an example (very refreshing)  Ryan's skills are so good,  it is hard to see the finesse, so a student makes it easier to understand as well as he, with intent shows you how not to do it. My only want would be more slow motion on finesse.",1453248000,,368,4.169014084507042
8294528,5,B001DQDB6U,I personally know Ryan Young.  He is a very good rider and explains things in a logical way.  Some of these techniques will probably not be mastered by most riders but it's still very good instruction.,1398038400,,201,4.555555555555555
8294529,5,B001DQDB6U,"Although geared toward the advanced rider, the techniques offered in this DVD are helpful for all levels.  Ryan's Trials Training Techniques DVD should be the first choice for any beginner-novice.  As with any of his lessons, techniques in this DVD are explained in detail.  This is, in my opinion, one of the best methods to get to the next level, short of attending a trials school.",1381708800,,384,4.787878787878788
8294530,5,B001DQDB6U,"I've been riding dirt bikes for 52 years and learned so much from Ryan's two videos.
If you are new to trials get the Trials Training Techniques and Cross Training Tools first.",1369353600,,176,4.53125
