8628315,3,B00GX7WSMC,"Profiles a day in the life of an artist of adult graphic novels. Shows him sleeping, smoking, and  then he draws. He talks along the way. He appears to be completely alone, says he lives in the house he was born in and is compelled to draw, perhaps in an effort to create some sort of companionship. Occasionally insightful and at other times surreal. Includes music in the background.",1465257600,,385,4.579710144927536
8628316,3,B00GX7WSMC,"Semi Colin purports to be a documentary on famed erotic artist Colin Murray. We get a peek into his daily life, including his drawing, while in voiceover he tells us about life, his work, and what it means to make erotic art.

There are two huge problems with Semi Colin, whether you are a fan of Colin Murray's art or not. The first is the form of this documentary. We watch as Murray goes through a day. That means the first 5 minutes of the film are a static shot of him sleeping. I'm not kidding, nor exaggerating. The camera sits there while an old guy lies in bed, apparently sleeping. We don't know his name, what he's dreaming of, or anything. Then he finally speaks, says maybe three sentences, and then it's another 5 minutes of silently watching an old guy go about his day. Of course, some of that day includes making very nice art. That's wonderful, but we don't get a view of it that means anything; he could be drawing Disney cartoons or pornographic doodles best left to a bathroom stall. Because we don't get any privileged access to what he's drawing, it's hard to care. That pattern continues for much of the film, though Murray does say a bit more as the film progresses.

The other problem with Murray is what he says. Though the box art claims the documentary will be ""stimulating the intellect,"" Murray's observations are kind of juvenile and tedious. His own story is all too commonhis parents didn't approve of his erotic urges, so he sublimated them by making naughty drawings. It's a near-universal urge (as bathroom graffiti will attest), and there's nothing particular unique about Murray's experience with it. Except, of course, that he didn't stop and instead went on to publish acclaimed erotic art. That's great, except we don't get to see nearly enough of the art to justify listening to his tired pronouncements about sex. If you're already a fan of Murray, then revealing the man behind the art is no good, because he's just another guy like the rest of us. There's no great mind behind the drawings, able to penetrate the mysterious of sex and eros. Murray's just another guy who can draw, putting his fantasies on paper. Based on what he says in this documentary, he should speak less and draw more.

I admire Semi Colin for trying to do something newheaven knows we don't need another bland talking-heads-interspersed-with-drawings-style documentary about a famous comics creator. I get that. In principle, Semi Colin could have been fascinating, but it just doesn't work. The compositions themselves can be nice to look atthough I didn't particularly enjoy watching Murray sleep, the framing was interesting. The film's music track is also excellent, which made Murray's occasional pronouncements all the more frustrating for interrupting the music.

The DVD itself is pretty solid. The 1.78:1 anamorphic transfer is fine, with decent detail and fine colors. When Murray is interviewed he's often alone in a chair that's set in a pool of shadows, and black levels seem nice and deep. The Dolby Digital stereo track keeps the voiceover clear and well-balanced with the excellent score. Extras include a commentary by the director, a gallery of Murray's illustrations, and a music montage.

8628317,2,B00GX7WSMC,"Ive reviewed quite a few documentary films about artists over the years but this is definitely the most unusual one Ive seen and probably the hardest to write a review about.

First off, Colin Murray (the graphic artist; not to be confused by the BBCs radio personality) is 71 and has published two erotic graphic novels, both out of print. He has also created erotic pin-up art but none has been shown publically (at least until this documentary was released.).  So I was looking forward to learning about the artist. Well, as you will see, I don't know much more after watching this DVD.

The best way to describe it is to list what happens on the screen after you press Play:

The first image you see is a man (Murray), sleeping in a bed with a solo piano playing an very nice original score (by Chris Morgan). There is NO movement for the first 3:33. He moves a bit to wake up and at 5:15 minute mark he gets out of bed.  At 6:45 minutes he goes to the bathroom up to urinate (which we see from the back) and he returns to bed until the 10-minute mark.  He finally goes to a table and begins coloring a drawing of one of his nude women. At this point there are brief scenes of him sitting in a chair describing his attitude toward art. Finally, at the 40-minute mark (remember the film is only 75-minutes long!) the director shows us Murrays finished art. Some of these are REALLY graphic with both male and female private parts shown.  (Can we call this graphic-graphic art?). At the 65-minute mark we get to see his full color story board for his novels and at the 72 minute mark he goes back to bed.  Sound like fun? More like watching paint dry/ (I can only tell you the times above because I was trying to stay awake while seeing where this film was going.

There are two bonus features on the DVD: First is a 4-minute fast-paced slide show of the graphic panels from the novels, set to Morgans music. (BTW, Morgans music is minimalist but would be nice to hear on a CD). The other is a Directors commentary. Normally youd hear this while watching a full movie but it doesnt start until the 10-minute mark and is really short and adds nothing to understanding Murray.

I  guess this is the first truly minimalist documentary Ive seen.  Life is too short already and watching a man sleep for six minutes and draw for another 20 to 30 minutes more certainly wasn't the best use of my time. Play the trailer (54-seconds) and youll have heard much of the dialogue in the film. And if graphic sex images offend you; be forewarned.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8628318,5,B00GX7WSMC,"Semi Colin is a wonderfully-designed exploration into the long asked question: Where is the line that exists between art and pornography? What is, if any, the deciding factor(s)?

The film is challenging. It challenges the viewer on multiple levels. But this is an intelligent film produced in ultra wide screen (3:1) for maximum impact (feels like Cinerama on your HD monitor:). It is very real. Yet it's very surreal at the same time. I personally found it mesmerizing to watch in a way that took me by surprise. Ultimately Semi Colin will coerce you to explore your inner self just as Colin does... for the first time in his life; stimulating your intellect and providing you the opportunity to explore your own natural voyeuristic urges. ""Semi Colin"" is a beautiful and simplistic look into the eyes of an artist, facing the morality of his passion, his art and his compulsion.

I highly recommend it for adventurous film-viewers who are open to something extraordinarily new and very different.",1387411200,,999,4.976047904191617
