7002409,5,B00T73AQJG,"I highly recommend this show. It is something for the whole family to sit down and watch together which is what the world needs more of these days. If you loved shows like Little house on the prairie, Anne of green gables, Dr. Quinn Medicine Women, or Christy then this series will be right up your alley. It has Romance, Comedy, Action, Drama, loss, faith, hope, friendship, family, and etc. I could be here all day telling you all the wonderful things about this series. I recommend it to all my friends and family.",1432771200,,517,4.51063829787234
7002410,5,B00T73AQJG,"If you are looking for some great quality family movies, then you might want to check out When Calls the Heart, a heartwarming series that is reminiscent of Little House on the Prairie but now for this generation. Michael Landon Jr. is the executive producer for the series that has been gaining popularity on the Hallmark Channel and now is beginning it's second season! I have absolutely fall in love with every aspect of this series, because in light of the programming you find on television these days, there isn't much there in the way of good moral values and family friendly shows the entire family can watch. This series is based on the novel When Calls the Heart by Janette Oke!

As Season Two begins we capture the season premiere with Trials of the Heart in this DVD episode. A lot has changed from season one, especially with all our major and well-loved characters. Elizabeth Thatcher (Erin Krakow) has been a schoolteacher for Coal Valley and has begun a new start out west despite coming from a family of affluence. When her mother falls ill, she feels she must return home now that school is out for the summer so she can spare the time. She is escorted back home by her love interest Canadian Mounty Jack Thornton (Daniel Lissing) who ensures her safe passage back home to the town of Hamilton. Once there, Elizabeth's father has hopes that she will fall in love and marry her childhood friend Charles Kensington, but he has to dissuade Jack that Elizabeth hopes for a better life are here in Hamilton and with Charles who can offer her the life her parents have always wanted.

Jack can't stay and immediately makes plans to head back to Coal Valley and leaves Elizabeth wondering what has happened between them. He only gives her the assurance that he will be waiting for her if she decides to return to Coal Valley. Meanwhile the sizzling anticipated romance between Abigail Stanton (Lori Laughlin), a widow and cafe owner in Coal Valley and investigator for the Canadian Mounties, Bill Avery (Jack Wagner). But now just as Bill returns on another case, a woman shows up claiming to be Bill's wife and she advises Abigail to look no further for any relationship with Bill. Oh what an interesting beginning for this series as love for our favorite women hang in the balance.

I received When Calls the Heart: Trials of the Heart compliments of the Hallmark Channel and Edify Media for my honest review. I did not receive any monetary compensation for a favorable review and received a complimentary copy of the DVD to review. The opinions contained here are my own. I love this series and can't wait to see how it will all play out. Once again we have to have conflict for our characters otherwise where would the series go from there. The one thing I don't care for in the season opener is the liberties that are taken with the clothing and hairstyles some of the women are wearing. I know they might be going for a more casual approach but during the time period depicted in this series, women still wore their hair up and were not seen with it down except when they were at home in the company of their husbands or family. It seems to have lost that originality in keeping with the consistency it had in the first series and I hope they realize it before the series ends. Well worth all 5 out of 5 stars in keeping with a family friendly series the entire family can watch together. This DVD even includes some bonus features like exclusive behind the scenes interviews!",1432771200,5,3493,4.603531300160514
7002411,5,B00T73AQJG,"Thank you Edify Media for this review copy.

I have enjoyed the When Calls the Heart series so much! I was excited to receive the the two hour season premiere DVD this week. Erin Krakow and Daniel Lissing are magnificent together as Jack and Elizabeth. He's a down-to-earth Canadian Mountie. She's a upper crust society girl who came to the town of Coal Valley to teach. Watching her learn to live in this whole new world has been endearing and amusing at times. Watching the two of them grow to like each other more and more has been fun and refreshing. I've had the benefit of seeing all of the first season. This series is a family favorite. My girls have really enjoyed the videos. They were so excited to hear that Hallmark is making it for a second season. This one has developments that may turn the town upside down. ~smile~

It appears that this season is going to be full of surprises. In this episode alone...
Someone confesses.
Someone ingratiates.
Someone irritates.
Someone breaks the law.
Someone startles.
Someone surprises.
Someone makes a right choice.
Someone is fearful.
Someone does something stupid.
Someone is rude.
Someone is conspiratorial.
Someone blackmails.
Someone lies.

""They've got to make a new one!""
- Amy upon watching the ending. Actually, I think that one of us says that after every episode!

This one is worth watching!",1432339200,8,1358,4.7905982905982905
7002412,5,B00T73AQJG,"""When Calls The Heart"" is absolutely the BEST show on television and is a breath of fresh air in this day and age!!  The season 2 premiere will hook you and keep you coming back for more.  With its subtle faith-filled undertones and blend of romance, mystery, adventure, and community, it is a modern-day mix of ""Little House on the Prairie"" and ""Doctor Quinn, Medicine Woman.""  Try it, and I bet you'll quickly become a fan!!  The Hallmark Channel has a gem of a show in ""When Calls The Heart,"" and I hope that it'll be around for many more seasons to come!",1432080000,2,558,4.388349514563107
7002413,5,B00T73AQJG,LOVE IT! Best show I've seen in a long time.,1432080000,,44,3.5
7002414,5,B00T73AQJG,"The season premiere ""Trials of the Heart"" was just as epic as when the season ended last year. Hallmark has stepped it up by added more characters and locations to deepen the story line. Rather than take away from what Hallmark created with the first season, the network adds greatly to it, making it more intriguing than before. You'll still find family friendly entertainment. There are some who, after only the first episode, have immediately jumped on the band wagon of condemning the show by citing soap operas, immodesty, bar fighting, etc. Those criticisms are a bit extreme. First of all, it is nothing that didn't happen in season one. Elizabeth's dresses aren't neck high anymore, but neither was the one when she went on her first date with Jack in episode 9 of season one. And bar fights, what happened in episode 5 of the first season when Jack broke up a fight at the saloon? This is no soap opera either. Elizabeth is spending time with a childhood friend who happens to be male. However, she is not cheating on Jack even in the lightest sense of the word, even if her childhood friend is sweet on her. Overall, this was a great springboard for the new season, and I'm looking forward to more of ""When Calls the Heart's"" charm, life lessons, and most importantly, family friendly entertainment.",1430956800,14,1309,4.695652173913044
7002415,1,B00T73AQJG,"As a fan of this show's first season, and a founding member of the so-called ""Hearties"" fan club, I can't express how bitterly disappointed I was in this Season 2 premiere program. All the quaint charm and family values that epitomized the first season -- and, indeed, Janette Oke's original books which allegedly inspired this program -- were completely missing in this new season. The show has become a victim of its own success and sunk to the level of a soap opera overflowing with poor, melodramatic writing, rampant historical inaccuracies and plot/story line inconsistencies,and garish over-production in everything from cleavage-baring dresses to barroom brawls. This program, as with other film adaptions of Oke's novels, has never resembled the original books' stories; but now, it doesn't even resemble good television. I will not be watching further episodes of this season, nor can I any longer recommend this program to my family and friends. Very, very disappointing.",1430092800,12,982,5.301282051282051
7002416,5,B00T73AQJG,"Thank you for letting me know someone was interested in my review of June in January.  Well I also watched the new show of When Calls the Heart Sat., and it was fantastic.  I am so glad that I am purchasing it from Amazon.  This series on Hallmark is my favorite.  I love the actors and I love the plot, and the series moves right along.  I have followed Jack Wagner thru different shows.  But the actors on this series is good.  So yes I am glad I am trying to collect the shows.  So thanks for keeping me informed.  So bye for now.  Glad my reviews help people.",1430006400,5,563,4.08256880733945

7002421,4,B00T73AQJG,"This new season brings new characters and some changes to the town. A couple of my favorites are no longer part of the series, but I am intrigued by new developments with the new characters and further development of some we were previously introduced to. There also seems more of moving on to a new chapter from the tragedy of the deaths of so many coal miners. The trial concludes, bringing some closure to people's lives and turning to a new direction. I did not love this one as much as I have those from season 1, but there were quite a few changes for me to assimilate. It's just my nature to be hesitant when new things come along. But, I have no doubt I will be drawn back into charms of this series. I am closer to a 4.5 stars for this one.

7002427,5,B00T73AQJG,"This Season 2 premiere is wonderful!!  You will love seeing the continuing stories of Jack & Elizabeth, Abigail, Bill Avery, Rosemary, and all the characters in this series that is totally entertaining.  And, you will enjoy meeting the new characters such as Elizabeth's family, Jack's brother, and a new saw mill owner, to name a few.  There is flirty, fun banter and clever dialogue, along with heartfelt, warm stories.  The writing and acting are superb!  The relationship between Jack and Elizabeth, played brilliantly by Erin Krakow and Daniel Lissing, is amazing........their scenes together are really special.  You're going to really enjoy the character of Rosemary and her developing relationship with a new man in town, Lee.  I love the relationship between Jack and his brother, Tom.  It's interesting to see the family of Elizabeth--Aunt Agatha is a hoot--and get an idea of the high-society life she comes from.  I could go on, but I think you get the idea.....this show is great!!  I had not watched any show on a regular basis until I found this one last year, and I can't get enough of it.  It truly is the best!!!

7002443,5,B00T73AQJG,"The two hour special of When Calls the Heart season 2 is just fantastic. It is full of love, surprises and danger, but so very, very good.
  What we have all been looking forward to is the trial and many, many surprising things happen with that.  I love that it was a lady lawyer who came. At first everyone thought she couldn't do the right job, but that soon changed.
  Elizabeth is called home because her mother is ailing and Jack takes her. She fits in like she never left, but Jack doesnt.  You can watch as Elizabeth shops with sisters, has parties and renews old friendships.
  You will be astounded at all of the new things that happen and also rejoice at the old friends we made in season one and meet many new people who become friends in season two.
  Two hours of suspense, family, love and hope.  I highly recommend this fantastic show. I love it because the values are wholesome and it is just an exciting show. You need to buy the DVD and if by chance you have never seen these shows you must watch just one. If you do watch one you will be hooked and join all of us Hearties.
Highly recommended.

7002444,4,B00T73AQJG,"My thoughts:

Inspired by Janette Oke's novels about a well bred city born teacher moving to the rugged Canadian frontier, this series brings to mind Little House on the Prairie. Producer Michael Landon Jr. follows in his father's footsteps (Producer/Director of the 1980's sitcom) with this new series, always family oriented and a little gem in a otherwise blase world of cinematography.

It is a relief to see such movies for any family and the charismatic relationships makes even adults look forward to see what happens next.

That said, this episode surprised us as new actors were introduced to replace established characters and along with inaccuracy in details such as period costumes (few women wore such colours or even ventured outside without hat/head covering) and too many 'newcomers' to remember, this episode disappointed. The series might well soon fall in the 'deja vu' category.

Still, I enjoyed the chemistry between our favourite Mountie and spunky teacher and I too cannot resist wondering what happens next in the series!

4 Stars.
