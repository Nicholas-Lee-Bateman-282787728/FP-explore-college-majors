1350391,4,B00004TJFM,"this is my son's favorite thomas tape (he has 7 of them!), and it would be mine as well if alec baldwin was not the narrator. i find it offensive and annoying that he chooses to verbalize james as an over-the-top, effeminate, gay character and he does so in a very mocking way. james' exultations of ""oh puhleeze!"" and ""oh heyulp (help)"" and numerous inferred eye rolls are ridiculous. i find this akin to his portraying the chinese dragon as saying ""ah so, me so solly...."" i so wish they would rerelease this video without mr. baldwin's narration, not only because it is annoying and offensive but because it is a well-written script with interesting situations for little kids that would otherwise be valuable.",1053734400,14,713,4.758064516129032
1350392,2,B00004TJFM,"positive first: alec Baldwin speaks very good and understandable for my 3 year old.
negative:the thomas the tank engine dvds are very simple made. Especially the people have only one or two expressions.
negative: on the whole dvd is no acting female engine and one acting lady, Mrs. kimbal. She really is a helpless lady in distress, who needs the support of all the male engines and sir topham hatt.
I hope, not even ladys 100 years ago where as the reverent pictures them.",1043107200,,474,4.654761904761905
1350393,4,B00004TJFM,"My 22 month old son loves the Thomas series.  In all we have The Best of Thomas, The Best of James and this one. Although my son doesn't seem to mind the narrator's voice, I find Alec Baldwin's narration horrible.  The narrator in the Best of Thomas video is much better.  Alec Baldwin narrates the Best of James video as well, and that is my son's favorite one of the three.  So, he doesn't seem to mind. I can also understand those parents who are concerned about the rude comments, despite things working out in the end.  I find the same in the Best of James video as well.  (I don't much care for James.) However, my son loves it nonetheless, and I don't think he is learning bad habits as a result.  Quite the opposite--I think he wants to watch to see how things resolve in the end.",1029456000,7,788,4.248322147651007

7922545,2,B00004TJFM,"In general, my kids love Thomas. We love the books (we have the super-huge treasury, among others), and the other videos are usually fine. However, this one drives me NUTS. Alec Baldwin's voice acting here is horrible. He makes all of the characters sound like spoiled brats, thus changing the tone of the whole video to a negative, whiny experience. All of the engines sound the same - snobbish and rude, even when speaking common, every day phrases. Not only does this make me really dislike this video, but I worry about my children mimicking his attitude.
Look for the videos with the other voice actors - they do a MUCH better job of portraying childlike behavior without making you cringe. (Ringo in particular does a great job.) We like this video, but it does not get as much play as the others, simply because of the narration. Get it, but don't pay too much for it.",1334966400,,875,4.579617834394904
7922546,5,B00004TJFM,This was great another tape with my favorite narrator Alec Baldwin. It was cool and funny and loved it. Thomas isn't sexist and think how people complaing about it being sexist is a load of BS. And its Mrs. Kyndley not Mrs Kimbal. Its fine the way it is and girl carrigaes being pulled around by male engines is not even remotely sexist. And if you people have a problem with it don't let your kids watch the show. Dont ruin it for the older thomas fans like my nephew because he has fun with it and your kid will grow out of it probaly and if not then he`ll be old enough to know these things. So don't tell HIT to change and put in females and screw up thomas just don't watch it. I mean your kids whole life cant be sugar coated all the time. There are plenty of female chrachters and Rev W Awdry made them kind enough you guys just cant take a little humor.,1153526400,,861,4.070588235294117
7922547,5,B00004TJFM,"Personally, this is one of my favorite Thomas videos. It is better than all the other Thomas videos that came out around that time like Cranky Bugs; Races, rescues, and runaways; and Spills & Chills. Some overprotective parents have said that there is to much nasty words exchanged from the engines. So what. It's not even close to being ""nasty"" and besides, kids will here stuff like that someday.  Most of these stories focus on Percy but they are still very good anyway. My favorite is Thomas and the Rumours. Here are the stories:

Make Someone Happy  A:
Thomas is tired of James bragging about how good he is and saying that he's to important to pull messy coal cars. He tells James that if he makes someone else happy for a change, he'll make himself happier too, but James refuses to believe him. Meanwhile, Mrs. Kindly is looking forward to her sister coming up to visit her but finds out that she can't come, so she is sad now. Will James cheer her up, or will he just keep trying to feel important?

A Big Surprise for Percy  B:

Pushing and pulling cars back and forth all day, that's what Percy has to do every day and he is very board; he longs for a surprising thing to happen. Well he gets it soon enough when the cars break free from his train and start running away.

Happy Ever After  A:
Mrs. Kindly daughter is getting married and Percy is on a mission to find the good luck package which must contain: something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue. But just where does he find those things Percy is wondering. With some help along the way, Percy will soon find the good luck package.

Thomas & the Rumours  A:
When the children tell Thomas that their playground has been closed down, Thomas tries to help them. Then, when Sir Topham Hatt has Harold take a visitor around the island instead of the engines, the big engines get mad because they think that Harold is taking over their work. Now Thomas has two problems to solve, but maybe they are connected somehow.

James & the Trouble with Trees  A:
When Sir Topham Hatt sends James to help Thomas and Percy clear the line of fallen trees, they warn James how dangerous trees can be and James doen't listen to them. But who will come an help him when he encounters a giant tree?
  Baa!  A:
Percy is sent to Maithwate station with some flowers for the ""Best Dressed Station"" award and runs into a hungry ram. Luckly, his driver is able to lure the ram away with some food.
Then later, the station gets trashed and everyone thinks it can only be one thing, the ram. But come to find out, the ram isn't the culprit, he is just making sure the real suspects do no more damage.

Again, great Thomas video. Even the music video, ""It's Great to be an Engine,"" is good. I'd recommend that you buy this Thomas video to add to your collection today. If you don't, you're missing out.",1096934400,3,2866,4.420152091254753
7922548,3,B00004TJFM,"Make Someone Happy is a decent video with a few decent episodes. Alec Baldwin narrates, and his narration has pros and cons. The pros are the narration itself, is rather good and Baldwin does give characters creative character voices but the cons are that some episodes aren't that exciting and Baldwin does make James sound like a sterotypical gay man. But those Chinese Dragon and eye rolling complaints or full of crap. The Chinese dragon never said anything and all the engines roll their eyes to make up for the fact that their mouthes don't move! Also, not to sound rude but those complaints about the lack of a strong female character are just annoying. Mrs. Kindly needs help in about 2 episodes in the entire show, and in her first appearance she saves Thomas and is rewarded with a Christmas party. A female steam engine wouldn't be needed, because Mavis is a strong female character and an engine. Though it seems like HIT listened because Emily was introduced a few seasons later. Happy Ever After, James and the Trouble with Trees, and A Suprise For Percy are the best episodes on this Thomas & Friends release.",1088035200,3,1124,4.710659898477157
7922549,3,B00004TJFM,"It's been awhile since I did a Thomas review but i've had this one thought out for awhile. Let me start off with the fact that James used be be a moderatly good character. Now all he can do is whine. James has never been a nice engine but he was considered a tough guy. Now Salty with his two major roles is now a tough guy. I think before making new characters they should use the old ones that are never mentioned. Duck has not had a major role since Alec Bladwin took over. Niether has Daisy, Bertie, Terence, BoCo, Duke, or Sir Handel. The engines that have had bad major roles are Edward, Gordon, Henry, Toby, Donald, Douglas, Mavis, or Oliver. I never like Bill and Ben from the start so I didn't list them. If anyone from Hit Entertainment ever reads this have them fire Alec Baldwin.",1075334400,7,791,4.28
