8482028,4,B005OUE9OY,"Otherwise known as `The Swindle', this is a French film from 1997 and stars Isabelle Huppert (`La Ceromonie' and `I Heart the Huckabees') as a small time con artist called Betty, but she uses loads of aliases. She `works' with her papa one Victor, and between them they hustle, drug and rob convention attendees like dentists or lawn mower sellers.

Then they are set for another job in Switzerland but Betty has sort of got a gig going herself and is going to work on long term acquaintance, Maurice for some five million Swiss Francs. But as relationships start to unravel it is hard to figure who is actually gaming who and so the plot and the intrigue take on a lot more of a sinister hue.

Well that is the synopsis and is it any good? Well it is above ok but far from the high end of French cinema. The problem I think is its pace it only ever ambles along and in places, despite the on screen antics, it starts to slow down. This is a crime caper and I felt it should have had more immediacy, but it still has more than enough moments to prevent you from getting bored. The acting is all fine and the settings are great with nice attention to detail when it is needed. It really is more of a gentle comedy, but not a laugh out loud type.

In French with good sub titles, and a run time of 101 minutes. Directed by French, icon Claude Chabrel ,who was also behind the aforementioned and rather good, `La Ceremonie'. So if you like a bit of Gallic humour with a reasoned pace and semi intriguing, plot you should enjoy.",1355270400,,1524,4.284722222222222
