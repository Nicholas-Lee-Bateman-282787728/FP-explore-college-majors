2099456,5,B0002IQK7M,Why are people bad mouthing The Simpsons?  Who cares if they did do random episodes they are still good right?  I just don't get it!  I bought it for $9.99 at Target.  It is four whole episodes plus Krusty the Clown.  The only others ways to get these is to get kazza (illegal) or buy seasons which Iv'e seen go for $49.99.  I just don't get it!,1099267200,6,345,4.074626865671642

I love The Simpsons, and so far I own all four of the season box sets, with season 5 pre-ordered. Someone gave me ""Gone Wild"" for a present, and always willing to watch The Simpsons I popped it in. The DVD starts off with an episode already available on Season 1? I don't understand why they would include something that has already been released onto another dvd? The other 4 episodes found on this collection are not available in the season box sets...yet, but to be honest, I would much rather wait and get the entire season complete than purchase one show on this disk, another show on another disk etc. Only if you are a die-hard fan of the show and cannot wait for Fox to slowly dole out the remaining seasons would I recommend this dvd.",1098921600,37,880,4.33939393939394

It's Not Like Any Of The Shows On The Dvd's They Put Out Are Bad By Any Means They Are All Great. But I'd Rather Put My Money Into The Complete Seasons Seems More Worth It Then These Single Dvd's They Put Out. It's Just Fox Trying To Make As Much Money Off The Simpsons As They Can!

2099459,1,B0002IQK7M,"Why release random sets of some of the more mediocre (relatively speaking) episodes?

Why not do a ""Fan Favorites"" DVD, with the most popular episodes according to fans or something like that?

Poor choices for a theme, and while the episodes are funny and watchable, there are so many better ones around.

2099460,5,B0002IQK7M,"Let me just say that people are overreacting.  Some people really like these episodes.  I enjoy them.  I am not going to get it but, people out there aren't going to spend $40.00 to get their simpsons fix.  i payed full price for season 4 and thats it.  When a new season comes out, a store at my mall sells each volume for $15.00.  Thats how i get the so-so seasons.  The holloween one is a great idea, those are the best episodes.  Other people like the Christmas and the ""gone wild"" ones.

  I do agree that fox should release these things a lot faster, at least season 5 by Christmas.  Im buying the seasons from now on because these are the best episodes and the special features are getting better.  What im saying is, i don't even know if fox has started work on season 5 yet.  Please FOX, you did awesome with Futurama, now do it with probably your most succesful show.",1095638400,5,877,4.2682926829268295
2099461,1,B0002IQK7M,"NOTE TO FOX - We are tired of your gouging The Simpsons fans by piece mealing these lousy single DVDs in order to make more money.  Just release the box sets without the comentaries.  Then  release another version of the box sets with the commentaries for those who think it's worth the years of waiting. I have listened to some of them and half the time, the creators drift off into subjects not related to the episode. Why would I want to listen to that?",1095638400,11,456,4.341176470588235
2099462,1,B0002IQK7M,"So this just comes out and already we are lined up for another Christmas collection in the next few weeks.

Here's an idea...how about just releasing SEASON FIVE!!!!

I'm going to be middle-aged by the time the seasons are all released.

Absolutely NO EXCUSE seeing as how other shows like Star Trek, Buffy, Angel, etc. release their season sets every 4-6 months. Yet we have to wait YEARS for Simpsons. What is even more of a slap to the face is the relatively fast release of Futurama!! Who exactly is the dingleberry in charge of these release schedules.

As for the length of the time before complete season release.  All I can say is they better wise up.  Every month they make me wait just lets me wonder whether I want to spend $500 on all the seasons over time...",1095379200,4,414,4.1375
2099464,1,B0002IQK7M,"They really need to speed up the seasons release schedule. Or give us a truly legitimate reason for going so slow. With the decline in quality of the show over the last few seasons you guys are in danger of losing your fan base. As others before have said, we do not care about the extras. The episodes speak for themselves. I urge all Simpsons fans to write the studio and let our collective voices be heard. I think they are forgetting that the window for selling the most sets is limited. Money talks and the rest walk. When I see other shows with reasonable release schedules it makes wish I was a fan of them. Do not waste your money (and more importantly) give them more reasons to release these teaser DVD's.",1095292800,5,715,4.383458646616542

Unless I die first .... waiting another 8 years for all of the seasons to be released. But then they won't get any more of my hard earned dough!!! So let's speed up the releases here guys ....

2099466,2,B0002IQK7M,"At the very least they could've included the episode where the Simpsons went to FL for Spring Break and ended up running from the law after killing/knocking out the alligator, ended up working in the South at a diner.

There are any number of Simpson Vacation episodes to choose from that could've been included on this dvd.  Had they asked for my input, I would've done it for free.

This does not tide me over till season 5's release.  Friends/Buffy/X-Files/Sex and the City/South Park dvd release schedule beats the pants off the Simpsons dvd release schedule.",1094774400,5,563,4.833333333333333

2099468,3,B0002IQK7M,"This dvd is obviously just a bone thrown to us to chew on until the next season is released. I'll chew on it but I would like to see a shorter release time from season to season.

While I understand it takes longer due to the commentary recording, I really would rather have the episodes themselves. The commentaries are seldom interesting anymore and border on annoying. I think they would be better if the cast contributed more comments. Rather then just a silent Groening, Al Jean, and other assorted writers/directors. I really enjoyed the commentary with Hank Azaria on the most recent set.

Simply put, I would rather just have the episodes themselves without the commentaries if I could get them quicker. As opposed to waiting another year just to hear Al Jean talk about what somebody brought to lunch one day while they were having a writers meeting.",1094601600,7,859,4.758389261744966
2099469,5,B0002IQK7M,"The most annoying thing on this board are the box set people in this case Simpsonheads.  They assume everyone is going to buy each season set at $40 a pop.  How many seasons has the Simpsons been on now 13...that's $520?  How many of you are willing to pay that kind of money to have every episode?  The Simpsons is MAYBE one of my 10 favorite shows of all-time.  Do I want to spend $520 on this and say 10 times that so I can get all my favorite shows ($5200).  Are you people rich or just that loyal?  Well we are not all going to spend $520 on the Simpsons.  So think of others before trashing this product.

I applaud Fox for trying to appeal to all types not just the Simpsonheads.  I have the Christmas DVD and it was very well put together.  Thanks you Fox.",1094515200,3,764,4.094594594594595
2099470,3,B0002IQK7M,"Obviously this is another collection of episodes in between the season sets. The line-up of episodes -- including Homer's Night Out, Sunday Cruddy Sunday, The Mansion Family and Homer The Moe -- appears to be fairly unappealing considering the vast trove of material they have to pull from.

That's not to say that these episodes don't have their moments -- it's just it could've been so much more. I suppose they couldn't safely release a DVD dedicated to Homer's greatest screw-ups -- I mean what would they call it?

I don't know if this will staunch the hunger for more season releases. Apparently, the reason why the season sets are taking so long to release is due to the fact that they record commentaries for every single episode.

The commentaries are something that I enjoy listening to very much. I'm willing to wait for them. The season 4 commentary with Conan O'Brien's first episode with the great comedian himself is great.

The season sets are an example of quality over quantity. It appears it may be the reverse for this release.",1093392000,14,1047,4.767955801104972
2099471,5,B0002IQK7M,This DVD is most likly like the other small DVDs. It has four episodes and some of them are not yet on the season DVDs which makes the DVD a buy.

2099472,1,B0002IQK7M,"Alrighty then, what do we have here? Another random assortment of episodes that FOX churns out to make a quick buck inbetween the box sets. If they really want to make more money, then they should release the box sets faster! I love the Simpsons, and the box sets are always done well. While I wait patiently for the 5th season, they churn out this dud. FOX, what are you doing? Now, the Halloween and Xmas DVDs were bad in the sense that we would eventually get them, but at least they were good episodes. Here's the roster for ""Simpsons Gone Wild"":

Homer's Night Out (Season 1)

Kwik Synopsis: At a bachelor party, Bart snaps a photo of Homer dancing with an exotic dancer, and must make it up to Marge.

It's a pretty bad sign when a season one episode is the best one on the set. We already HAVE this on our first season collections. We don't need it again. It's a pretty good episode, but still a little weird to watch now, as the characters, and animation, have changed so much.

Homer the Moe (Season 13)

Kwik Synopsis: Moe goes back to bartending school to rekindle his love of getting people loaded. Homer tends the bar while he's gone, and when Moe returns, Homer starts his own bar.

This one is alright. The first act was pretty funny. Then the jokes start to get tired and cruel, i.e.: Homer forcing Lisa to cut lemons that he doesn't need at his bar. Then at the end, it turns into a hunting episode for a turkey and... whatever. It doesn't make sense. There's a few funny bits, but not nearly enough. R.E.M. guest-stars by the way.

Sunday Cruddy Sunday (Season 10)

Kwik Synopsis: Homer forms a group to go to the Super Bowl. Meanwhile, Marge and Lisa paint eggs.

Wow. Just wow. This may well be the worst episode ever. The first act had about two funny things. Then pretty much nothing else. And this plot had potential. You've got Homer's group comprised of pretty much every single secondary character, but none of them were in character, they were just all a part of the mindless mob. Then, you have pointless guest star after guest star. Troy Aikmen, Rosey Grier, John Madden, Dan Marino, Rupert Murdoch, Dolly Parton, and Pat Summerall. You'd think they'd be used, but they aren't. Especially Dolly, who uses some kind of makeup thing to sear a hole through prison bars. Umm... right. While this mindless Super Bowl plot goes on, Marge and Lisa have a wonderful adventure of their own. They paint eggs. That's it. Then they call Vincent Price for a refund. Price, at the end, saying, ""Quiet, Jody, you're not helping"" was probably the funniest thing in the episode. This was just one big pointless piece of garbage. But wait, there's more!

The Mansion Family (Season 11)

Kwik Synopsis: While Mr. Burns goes to the mayo clinic, the Simpsons tend after his mansion.

Here's another episode that starts out well, but then goes nuts and collapses. Britney Spears appears... pointlessly. The Simpsons at the mansion was funny. Burns at the clinic was funny. But once Homer has a party in international waters on Burns' yacht and they're boarded by pirates, the entire episode goes down the tubes.

The only extra is a featurette of Krusty's greatest moments, similar to Burns and Kang and Kodos' on the other sets. The only real reason you should get this DVD is if you are a completist, if you must have every single Simpsons item. If not, skip it. If you must have more Simpsons, buy the other two mini-sets. If you have those, then why don't you go watch something else? Or go outside? That's a grand idea.",1091923200,33,3531,4.559241706161138

It contains 4 episodes, and 1 extra feature featurette.  The sound is pretty good, even though it is just Stereo sound, and the picture quality is excellent.  This DVD is mainly for the people who don't collect the Simpson Season Sets, and just want to see acouple of various episodes from time-to-time, when there is nothing else on TV.

8028159,5,B0002IQK7M,"I hate to admit I do not watch much T.V. at all, but I love R.E.M. and wanted to see the episode where they made a guest appearance so I picked up this 4 episode disk. Although R.E.M.'s appearance consisted of a partial performace of ""Its the End of the World as I know It (and I feel fine)"" and a few lines by each member of the band, I think it was worth it. The performance just picked up so much of the band's personality (Homer telling them it was a benefit to save the rainforest to get them to perform in his garage turned bar from Stipe wanting to wack Homer with a broken beer bottle when the deception is discovered and being told that was not the R.E.M. way, to recycling the broken bottle bits). It was a little freaky how much the cartoon depictions resembled Stipe, Mills and Buck.

So if you are an R.E.M. fan this is a disk to pick up as it is just so funny (if not brief) and such a parady of the persona the band was dripping at the time.",1110412800,6,956,4.031578947368421
