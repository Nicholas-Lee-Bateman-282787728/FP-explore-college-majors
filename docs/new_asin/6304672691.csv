This is a message movie that uses the topic of abortion for its drama. This is set in Milwaukee, those who know that area an comment on the scenery. It provides viewpoints for each side, but leans in one direction. But thats how show business works; who puts up the money calls the tune. This is also true for the newspapers, magazines, and broadcasting that entertains and informs you. It argues for abortion rights and their need everywhere. Do rural areas have the same needs and interests as urban areas? Is there an economic correlation as well? Its an interesting drama but not one for the whole family. There have always been abortions available even when they were illegal. The Oath of Hippocrates banned physicians from performing them, although some did D & Cs for their patients.

Roe vs. Wade legalized abortions in this country. Some True Crime books may have told about these operations. This story tells how emotions can drive a person to commit a crime in contradiction to their beliefs. The lesser evil? Its a sad day when violent are used against people who are not breaking civil laws. This conflict provides the drama for this movie. Why was there a movement after 1969? After this date wages became stagnant or falling while productivity increased. The economic pressures led to abortions as a solution for the costs of children. The reason the Establishment supported abortions in place of higher wages for workers. Children have costs in raising and education. The Establishment would prefer to bring in immigrants whose costs were borne by other countries. But none tell about this.

Small family farms raised children as well as crops and cattle, their reduction lowered the number of people who would migrate to cities to provide workers for business and industry. Of course people should obey the laws. But think of other examples in past history. What if a class of people were taken away to resettlement camps? Longfellow wrote a poem about Evangeline; was this a comment on President Andrew Jacksons Indian Removal Act? There are more examples in modern times. What would you do if the government did this with whatever groups of people are objects of hate today? When people of Asian extraction were forcibly removed from their homes and lands in California how many protested at the time? Or even today? Should reason always prevail over emotion? Does Big Brother control your thinking?",1453766400,,2447,4.934466019417476
