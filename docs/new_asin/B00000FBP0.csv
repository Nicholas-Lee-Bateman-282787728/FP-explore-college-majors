1207864,5,B00000FBP0,"As a pilot, I really enjoyed the ""hands-on"" experience this video gives you. From the walk-around, to the detailed instructions of engine start-up, it puts you IN the aircraft. The first part of this video is all flying ... and it assumes you are a pilot. In my opinion, it's the best materal I've ever seen on the P-38.
The second part is an historical reenactment of two missions that's so-so, but fun. Not Hollywood, but you can tell the guys had fun doing it.
The scenery in this video is beautiful and the Dolby sound of those Allisons is incredible. Crank up your surround sound! I don't how anyone could film a better warbirds video!",969840000,7,640,4.525862068965517
1207865,5,B00000FBP0,"This has the best sound of all the series (all of which are good).  It is quite a thrill when, from the cockpit view, the engines are started.  It continues with the run up before take off.  I had this in a VHS version and  bought the DVD to get better sound.  It is the best of the series (I have  them all)",933120000,21,308,3.8095238095238093

7907778,5,B00000FBP0,"Me X Lockheed employee. Passed dvd on to a friend who was a P-38 pilot in North Africa in WW II. He is 94 yoa and still flies, sailplanes!",1389744000,,138,3.793103448275862
7907779,5,B00000FBP0,This is another great DVD with the late Jeff Ethell on the Warbird series. Jeff explains the P-38 and makes you feel as though you're flying with him. His knowledge and explanation of the  plane is superb. If you're interested in US World War Two fighter planes you won't be disappointed.,1361836800,,288,4.647058823529412
7907780,5,B00000FBP0,This is part of a very nice series. I've enjoyed this DVD. The story on this airplane is a long one but the DVD puts most all of it nicely together for you. It shows the airplane up close and personal. There is a pilot story also in the DVD that takes you back in time. I'm very happy with the purchase. Thanks. Rick L.,1357948800,,319,3.923076923076923
7907781,4,B00000FBP0,"I bought this for my Dad as a birthday gift, and he liked it. Was missing some of the war footage others have, but probably makes up for it with modern footage and overall quality. If you're a P-38 fan, this one will have modern footage you can't get in the others, so it's probably a must have.",1319932800,,295,4.103448275862069
7907782,2,B00000FBP0,Very short on real information of war bird employment in the war.  Some pretty good but not outstanding modern inflight.,1224460800,,120,5.0
7907783,5,B00000FBP0,"I've always been interested in this great aircraft, originally concieved as a high-altitude interceptor.  This plane was very far ahead of its time, thanks to Lockheed's Clarence L. ""Kelly"" who also designed and built the F-80 Shooting Star, F-94 Starfire, F-104 Starfighter, the U-2 and SR-71 Reconnaissance Aircraft.  I've always liked the P-38 because it came from that great Art Deco era of the late 1930's, with a beautifully sleek and unique design that was typical of the period.

The P-38's tough, twin engine design and its nose-mounted multiple gun platform was deadly and highly accurate, and in my opinion made it a more effective weapon than the more glamourous P-51, with a much longer range.  Before the P-51's and P-47's reached Europe in quantity, the P-38 was tasked with escorting the heavy bombers on their missions, and it was there the Luftwaffe began calling it ""The fork-tailed devil"".  Tom Lamphier shot down Yamamoto with his P-38, and Richard Bong became the USAAF's top scoring ace in a P-38.  The Lighting served in all theatres of the war.  I was very happy to learn that one had been recovered from Greenland and restored.

The Roaring Glory Warbirds video gives a marvelous review of the P-38, giving us a peek inside the cockpit, to see how complex this plane was.
With great aerial photography, and some re-creations of actual incidents, I am very happy to have this video in my collection.  I'd also like recommend the Roaring Glory Warbirds F6F Hellcat video.  Just wish they would do a similar video for the great P-40 Warhawk.",1186099200,4,1564,4.890151515151516
7907784,5,B00000FBP0,"True fans of the P-38 ""Lightning"" will find this DVD a truly moving experience, with stunning aerial footage of the late Jeff Ethell flying an immaculate P-38L over the Pacific coastline. This is more than worth the purchase price for these latter-day scenes alone, though other portions are interesting as well. Not really mentioned was that the P-38 was designed as an interceptor, and never intended to 'dogfight' smaller, lighter opposition. That it succeeded in doing so was greatly to the credit of it's pilots, and it's versatility. D. Judkins",1175040000,3,550,5.122222222222222
7907785,5,B00000FBP0,"This series represents an important archive of information about a crucial part of World history. This collection should be part of every Middle or High schools' media center. If you have the means, buy even one episode on DVD and donate it to a local school. Specific to my review, now, this episode about the P-38 Lightning was my first exposure to the Roaring Glory experience. It completely entertained and informed me, giving me an entire new respect and admiration for the men who designed and fought in these machines. The DVD is astounding in it's image quality and sound. There are many extra features, making this little nugget of history a steal at the prices found on Amazon! Want to keep history alive? Want to feel renewed pride as an American? Start your own adventure with Vol. 9 of Roaring Glory - let the ""Lightning"" strike you today!",1030752000,17,852,4.724832214765101
7907786,5,B00000FBP0,"This DVD has excellent sound. It gives just enough technical detail to keep it interesting and then moves to the flying scenes. The ""Young Pilots"" part is a little corny, but my children love it because it reads like a story. The training film is quite interesting and explains a lot of the technical aspects of flying the Lightning. Be sure to have a surround sound system and then crank it up loud!",984960000,12,400,4.493150684931507
