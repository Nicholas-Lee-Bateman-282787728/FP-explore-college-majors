5540367,3,B00B0FRQQU,"The cover shows the original Jeff Beck Group with Rod Stewart, Ron Wood and Mick Waller. The video is actually the second Jeff Beck Group with Bob Tench on vocals, Cozy Powell on drums, Max Middleton on keyboards and Clive Chaman on bass. They put a blue background which affects the picture quality. It appears that the sound and picture are not in synch in some spots. Still, for Jeff Beck fans, this is the best video I have seen of Jeff Beck Group II. Powell's drumming really comes through. By the way, Max Middleton wrote one of the best Gary Moore instrumentals, ""The Loner.""",1363219200,23,582,4.552380952380952
5540368,1,B00B0FRQQU,"Question: , the description says this is with Bobby Tench, if this is true why is Rod Stewart on the cover?",1363219200,2,107,4.142857142857143
5540379,2,B00B0FRQQU,"The DVD is very misleading, starting with the cover, Rod Stewart is on the cover yet he is not in the video, The music does not match the video, totally out of sync and song 3 Morning dew froze up on all 3 of my dvd players, I do not recommend this dvd as it is far from a musical documentery as it says on the cover, The dvd does show what good players the band had, but they are only going thrue the motions as the songs are totally staged, very low budget production.",1392595200,,470,3.957894736842105
5540380,3,B00B0FRQQU,"As stated elsewhere here, the title and the photo on the cover are totally misleading. First, it is not a 'documentary'. And the Rod Stewart line-up of the band (w/drummer Micky Waller, who was about the third of fourth drummer at that point) does not feature at all. Instead this is Jeff Beck Group MKII, the early 70s line-up with Bobby Tench fronting the band and Cozy Powell drumming. And it is simply 6 clips (in not-so-great resolution) from Beat Club, the German TV show. Had the cover been honest - THE JEFF BECK GROUP MK II LIVE ON BEAT CLUB - there would likely have been no complaints. Indeed, that would have boosted the value of this disc given that the MKII line-up had a whole lot of fan and aside from YouTube clips (of all these tunes), most of us had never seen the band in action. Unfortunately there is too much bootleg stuff found within legit retail outlets, from HMV and Wal-Mart, to Amazon. Still, if you're a fan of the JBG MKII, you will likely want thiswhich is great except the video is not as crisp as on YT.",1387670400,,1037,4.3782383419689115
5540381,2,B00B0FRQQU,"On several of the songs, the video and audio were unacceptably out of sync. If you're interested in observing Beck's technique, this video will not be of much use.",1386979200,,163,4.655172413793103
5540382,5,B00B0FRQQU,"Originally on an English tv show, this documentary shows the Jeff Beck Group with
Bob Tench, Cozy Powell, Max Middleton and Clive Chaman in nice performance.",1371686400,3,157,5.076923076923077
5540383,1,B00B0FRQQU,"Not at all a documentary. Doesnt feature the JBG on the cover, just a blatant rip off that I fell for. Everything is available on YouTube and has been released before. Save your money, plenty of free Jeff Beck Group stuff out there, and plenty of great stuff on Amazon and other sources that ARE worthy of your hard earned dollars.",1368057600,10,331,4.442622950819672
5540384,4,B00B0FRQQU,"Despite putting a picture of the wrong Jeff Beck Group in the DVD's cover (the contents are, in fact, Jeff Beck Group II), I'm psyched to have found this little nugget. Given that this was filmed 41 years ago, the visual content focuses on the only thing that I'm interested in... the musicians. There's a real shortage of film of Jeff Beck, and although brief (running time: 39 minutes), the song selections are a good choice for the period represented:
1. Got The Feeling
2. Situation
3. Morning Dew
4. Tonight I'll Be Staying Here With You
5. Going Down
6. Definitely Maybe
The last two songs are worth the cost of the video by themselves, and to my knowledge, this is the only place that you'll find this version of ""Morning Dew"" (not to be confused w/ the earlier version done w/ Rod Stewart).
The only reason that I didn't give this five stars is due to the length. If you're a Jeff Beck fan, I think you'll enjoy this.",1366848000,12,925,4.415204678362573
5540385,1,B00B0FRQQU,The video and audio are not synched. You have to either listen to it or watch it with the sound off. This is really bad! Don't get this DVD!,1366588800,,140,3.8620689655172415
5540386,4,B00B0FRQQU,"The Jeff Beck Group II was quite a band - Jeff (of course) playing some very nice guitar; Cozy Powell proving his reputation on drums (sorely missed); Clive Chaman solidly supporting; and Max Middleton playing excellently on keyboards. Six great JBGII songs, pity about the cover pictures (the 1st JBG - nearly any Beck fan could have told them that this is wrong).

JBGII was a tight band and exploring some new directions (so evident later when Jeff recorded Blow by Blow but with a different band).

This is worth getting, quality is a bit down and some out of sync (interesting to have the visuals slightly ahead of the sound!). T'was 40 years ago and well worth still listening to.",1366243200,10,686,4.661157024793388
5540387,1,B00B0FRQQU,"Just like the Santana DVD, this is simply a re-hash of a media recording. You can see it for free on You - tube.",1364947200,,112,3.7083333333333335
5540388,1,B00B0FRQQU,"This dvd sucks, video is out of focus, audio is out of sync with video, you get six songs with no info at all. I find it hard to believe that Beck approved this dvd. He may not know it is for sale, if he does I am no longer a fan!!!",1363392000,3,232,3.480769230769231
8560277,5,B00B0FRQQU,This is my favorite era of Jeff Beck and Truth....of course..So far ahead of his time with this. I wish he would've done more stuff like this instead of his fusion. Not a fan of his fusion stuff. But this is fantastic.,1526342400,,218,4.214285714285714
8560278,1,B00B0FRQQU,I love the music but the video was a disappointment because the audio and video is not synchronized. And the cover is with Rod Stewart not Bob Tench.,1479513600,,149,4.357142857142857
8560279,2,B00B0FRQQU,Were they all sleeping when they put this together? Wrong band on the cover and so far out of sync by the third song it is almost un-watchable. Great band though.,1456790400,,162,4.258064516129032
8560280,5,B00B0FRQQU,Audio sometimes out of sync but still excellent show.,1447718400,,53,5.0

8560282,1,B00B0FRQQU,"Don't waiste your money, this is terrible quality and all video and sound are not in sync,same video have been on You tube for years (out of sync also) Totally bad production !!",1444608000,,177,4.393939393939394
8560283,4,B00B0FRQQU,"GREAT JB GROUP PERFORMANCES.FOR SELFISH AND OBVIOUS REASONS I ENJOYED THIS VIDEO.FOR ME ONE OF JEFF'S GREAT MOMENTS IN HIS MUSICAL CAREER WERE THE TWO LP'S HE RELEASED WITH THIS EXCELLENT ENSEMBLE OF MUSICAL GREATS! I WAITED A LONG TIME TO HAVE THIS BAND ON DVD.
  YES,MANY NEGATIVES AS STATED CLEARLY BY MANY REVIEWERS-I AGREE WITH MANY OF THEM.BUT I PUT THE DVD ON AND I WATCH AND HEAR THIS GREAT SHOW AND I'M GLAD!",1432339200,3,417,4.546666666666667
8560284,3,B00B0FRQQU,"The other reviews are correct, the band in all the photos on the DVD case is NOT the line-up on film. This is the Rough and Ready Jeff Beck group, not the Rod Stewart version. That out of the way, the couple albums by this (heard it called jeff beck group mkII), are great. I consider myself a knowledgeable beck fan and had never seen the footage. For that reason alone it was worth adding to my collection. The audio isn't bad, the guitar is a little to far back in the mix for me. And seeing jeff stand in front a Marshall full stack, I expected more snarl and presence. His playing seems somewhat subdued. Maybe tv studio isn't the most inspiring environment or the sound engineer wouldn't allow the volume he needed. In any case, for a fan of Beck's history it's a good watch. My biggest complaint is the audio/video timing during ""Going Down"", terribly out of sync and that song was what I really looked forward to. I find it hard to believe the producers wouldn't spend a few bucks and a little time  to fix that.",1428364800,3,1020,4.340314136125654
8560285,4,B00B0FRQQU,This a piece of history My favorite Jeff Beck band. It's to bad the vocal track doesn't match the auto Track .  But its still is one to have,1423008000,,140,3.8275862068965516
8560286,5,B00B0FRQQU,I saw JefF Beck Group in May 1971 and was disappointed with the concert. They redeemed themselves with this DVD. Everything I wanted to hear and then some. Much better sound quality too.,1392681600,3,186,4.666666666666667
