8441579,5,B004UIGIEK,"This is one of the most excellent television series I've ever seen that deals with the issues of teen sexuality. We heard about it before the 1st episode aired and faithfully watched through all five years. The actors were excellent, but even more than that, the writers had the courage to look at all sides of an issue, including parent and child, whether pro, con, or confused.

We grew up as teenagers in the 60s and early 70s, and we've just now hit the age of 60. Our grandkids are now 14,12, 10, & 7. Whether your teens watch the series or not, it can serve as a great jumping off point for you to listen when they talk. You can see lots of great examples of what works and what does't work. And you might be able to give a little better advice without getting so upset. Very right-wing families may have more problems with this show than moderate families and liberal families. I have not been able to find it streaming anywhere so that you could watch one or two episodes before buying the whole series.

When our kids were teens, the best help we found was from an out-of-print book about the confusing messages society gives regarding when someone becomes an adult. This TV series help us to be available as grandparents to listen and respond appropriately - as long as we remember we're grandparents and not parents this time around.",1394323200,2,1344,4.504098360655738
