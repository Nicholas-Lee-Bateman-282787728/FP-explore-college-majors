8167682,5,B000MC1FHS,"If you come upon this Canadian gem of a film....BUY IT! Clocking in at a perfect 81 minutes,TRAMP AT THE DOOR,an exact retelling of the magical short story by Quebec authoress Gabrielle Roy,is a film that equally enchants adults as well as children.
This is a film of no glitzy special effects, no mythical creatures from unknown worlds with Rings and Wardrobes; but rather a gentle and profound tale of a man (like a male Mary Poppins) who is a daydreamer and a tale spinner who comes to the Fortnier family in the rural plains of Manitoba,Canada in 1936.
""Gustave"" is full of wonder and amazing tales of  the  Fortnier's ""family"" back in Quebec. He seems to know how to extract just enough information to weave a tale that Mr. Fortnier and his daughter Danielle want to believe. They fall under Gustave's magical tale-spinning spell. Mother Madeleine is more reticent to daydream,and is relatively skeptical; but who is NOT able to resist Gustaves' stories? Is he for real? Is he secretly the doctor Ephrem Brabant? Is he an escaped mental patient? Is he a long lost brother Edouard? Or is he all and yet none of these people? The Fortnier's start not to really care,because their lives are becoming so enriched by this ""tramp at the door"".
TRAMP AT THE DOOR is so affectionately written and directed by Allan Kroeker for Telefilm Canada T.V. Kroeker's later success was the 1987 HEAVEN ON EARTH (concerning the English transport of orphans to Canada) and a long list of television credits including BONES, CHARMED,ROSWELL and STAR TREK.
Ed McNamera,who plays Gustave (and died the following year)is heartwarming in his portrayal. McNamera will be best known to American audiences as Jake in THE BLACK STALLION.
August Schellenberg who portrays Mr. Fortnier,the Justice of The Ministry who has become a ""cactus not needing much water"" and is need of daydreams to bring him substance in life,has had a long and distinguished career as a television actor, but has appeared in such films as BLACK ROBE,FREE WILLY,THE NEW WORLD,LONESOME DOVE and FRIDAY THE 13TH.His real life daughter Joanna debuts as  the inquisitive child who falls under Gustave's spell. She herself will become a tale-spinner.
Monique Mercure,who has appeared in the t.v. series PROVIDENCE, but won a Jutra Award as best supporting actress in the 1999 Oscar Nominated hit THE RED VIOLIN,plays Madeleine with the correct amount of suspicion about Gustave, and yet becomes his biggest defender by films end.
TRAMP AT THE DOOR is  appropriate for the entire family. It is 100% clear of any potentially offensive material or language. It is very much in the genre of BABETTE'S FEAST,a well told,precise and exactingly paced story that is so genuinely heartwarming that it will indelibly cement itself into your heart and mind. It is character-rich and full of great thought-provoking material that enchants the viewer. This is not some ""sappy"" ABC Family flick (no offense intended);it is far better than that! There is also a hint of resemblance to films such as THE RETURN OF MARTIN GUERRE and SOMMERSBY.
As for my interest in this film; my Grandmother was a ""Tale-spinner"".She filled my life clear up to her death at 97 with tales of family and events that to this day I will never know if they were true;
but they taught me to live,love and daydream-a rare woman with a rare quality just like ""the tramp at the door"".
VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.I believe this movie is only on VHS.If you find it...BUY IT!",1191542400,4,3471,4.8979591836734695
