5094314,5,B007L6VR6M,"What a nice surprise.  Somehow this traditional indi film escaped to the multiplexes and I had occasion to check it out.  For my taste Wes Anderson is a mixed bag when it comes to his projects.  I'm about 50/50 on the likability meter.  This is his best yet.  Co-written by Anderson and Roman Coppola, the cast contains some of the usual suspects including Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, and Jason Schwartzman.

The story, which takes place in 1965, revolves around a couple 12 year olds, both of which are seen as odd by their classmates and the adults around them.  Sam (Jared Gilman) is an orphan, seen as a troublemaker by his foster parents as well as his Scoutmaster (Edward Norton).  The girl, Suzy (Kara Hayward), likewise is a bit off-putting, has no friends and hates her parents (Murray and McDormand).  While watching a church play, Sam becomes smitten with Suzy dressed as a blackbird.  Suzy appreciates the attention and together they plot to leave their homes and go off together on a great adventure through the Rhode Island coastal wilderness.

Bruce Willis is the local island cop who is also having an affair with Suzy's mom (McDormand).  I can't say enough about the cast.  Harvey Keitel plays a tight-assed Scout troop leader and Scoutmaster Ward's boss.  Tilda Swinton plays ""Social Services"" which is how she refers to herself.  Bob Balaban pops up here and there as The Narrator, keeping us informed as to time, location and an approaching storm.  Schwartzman is another Scout leader at another camp who agrees to help the young lovers for a bag of nickels.  Every character is wonderful and every actor delivers exacting performances.

Having said that, much of the credit must go to first time film actors Gilman and Hayward.  Played with a straight face, their budding love feels right for their age.  Some of the best scenes are when Scout Sam (he says he has now resigned and is an ex-Scout) leads Suzy through the rocky hills and woods.  Suzy travels in a short ""go go"" style dress with high socks, a yellow suitcase and a battery operated record player.  You can't help but laugh.  And wait `til you see the Scout's attempt at a tree house.  I'm still laughing.  A must see.",1339545600,9,2206,4.742105263157895
5094315,5,B007L6VR6M,"Please also check out Roger Ebert's review--he gets it:
[...]

I especially like what he says of the underlying wistfulness of life--the transcience of even a happy moment, because of life moving ever forward--I thought, how rare for a director to touch down on such a subject that is rarely spoken of.",1339459200,2,302,4.8076923076923075
5094316,5,B007L6VR6M,"There is no accounting for taste.
The magic of this film worked for me and for thousands of others.
But it doesn't work for everyone.

If the magic doesn't work for you that's fine.
A prior review here used considerable intellect and very good critical faculties to justify a response that is emotional and taste related.
It doesn't come close to capturing the beauty of the film.

What Anderson does miraculously is distance you with satire and artifice at the same time he draws you in emotionally with a look at good people struggling with complex feelings.
Good fairy tales do the same.
The imagery, use of music, cinematography, and script are all creative and for me were magical.

Look at Anthony Lane's review in The New Yorker. Lane is one of our better reviewers and has the expertise to look at this film far more perceptively than I can or the prior reviewer can.
You may still not like the film.
I've been a serious filmgoer for 50 years. I'm also not a Wes Anderson junky. I don't like all of his films.
I loved this one.",1339286400,8,1035,4.49468085106383

5094394,2,B007L6VR6M,"Moonrise Kingdom is a film about two 12-year old autistic kids who run away from home (and a scout camp) in order to discover their sexuality. I didn't like the film. Several scenes could be seen as normalization of paedophilia. I was glad I wasn't the only one who made the connection, since everyone was so positively smitten by this production. A similar film could easily have been done without the sexual subtexts, the weirdly effeminate male characters, the suspicious-looking narrator If Hollywood wanted to raise consciousness about autism, this probably wasn't the best way to do it!",1514678400,,592,5.051020408163265

5094396,5,B007L6VR6M,Out of all of the Wes Anderson films the story in this one is my favorite. The Main characters are quirky and funny. This film made me miss being a child and the sense of wonder.

5094493,5,B007L6VR6M,"First time I watched this movie, I didn't like it. I was around 16 or 15 years old, and the many things happening all at once went over my head. However, the second time I watched this movie, I really enjoyed it. Moonrise Kingdom only gets better with viewing. There are so many little details you can miss the first time around. There isn't a bad actor or actress in this movie and that in itself is commendable. All the many character developments occurring in this movie are perfection.

5094532,5,B007L6VR6M,"'Moonrise Kingdom' is a great, great film by writer/director Wes Anderson.

The children [from the Royal Tennenbaum's going to school and attending Boy Scouts~ via their community on the East Coast...It isn't super, super, funny; however, it is very detailed and darkly funny. [Should you laugh?] Especially, given that one character is born into a family who doesn't understand/appreciate her. While another is born into a family and then later adopted into multiple, multiple host families [due to his quiet nature and strange habits.] Do I think it could be better? Yes. However, I personally can't imagine a better Wes Anderson film...

It truly is that beautiful and well made...",1495411200,,684,5.209090909090909

5094652,4,B007L6VR6M,"When young Sam and Suzy (Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward) run away from an adult world that has disappointed them to build their own life together, representatives from that world (Bill Murray, Bruce Willis, Frances McDormand, and Edward Norton) attempt to track them down in the face of an approaching hurricane.

This is only the second Wes Anderson film I have seen, after Fantastic Mr. Fox, and it largely continues the whimsical, otherworldly tone of that film.  What worked so well in an animated feature could become cloying and precious in live action, but Anderson avoids this pitfall by encouraging deadpan performances from his cast that help to establish a tired, resigned melancholy as the foundation for his fable about adolescence.  The kids have been let down and think they can do it better.  The adults seem to know that they have failed their kids, but they love them and are not eager for them to rush into a premature  maturity that is bound to disappoint them as well.  The approaching hurricane that provides a ticking clock for the action serves as a potent metaphor for adolescence.  It meanders a bit but has a lot of charm and many pleasant surprises.",1481328000,,1176,4.82089552238806

Bill Murray and Frances McDormand are Suzy's parents...Bob Balaban pops up every now and then breaking up the lulls.

The interior shots evoke memories of elementary school dioramas and dollhouse miniatures. The characters are not as fully developed as they could be, and there seems to be an emphasis placed on style over substance compared to some of Andersons other films. This small criticism aside, Anderson's incredibly inventive costumes, sets, and color palette magically transport the viewer into an alternate universe that is both familiar and dreamlike. The film has underlying pathos and wistfulness, especially in the scenes between Sam and Suzy  as played by newcomers Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward. Anderson is a master at capturing the melancholy that accompanies the realization that time passes inevitably  he reminds us that it is impossible to turn back the clock, no matter how hard we try.",1451865600,,934,5.43448275862069

If you enjoy Wes Anderson's crazy world, then you will love this misadventure that has something for everyone that ever enjoyed summer camp or sent their child off to summer camp.  For anyone who grew up in the 60s it is a real trip down memory lane. For anyone who ever fell in love with someone just a little bit nerdy you will recognize yourself here and for all those who ever loved Bruce Willis before he was cool, you will be in love with him here as the mild mannered local cop who cares more for others than himself.",1437955200,,545,4.230769230769231

5095307,5,B007L6VR6M,"This is an absolutely wonderful movie. My brother showed it to me, and Wes Anderson in general, and I'm so glad he did. This quirky flick just gets better every time I watch it, which has been about once a year, when I find out one of my friends hasn't seen it yet. It's magic leaves my happy every single time I watch it, and I don't think that will every go away.

I also love Wes' directorial style as well. His distinctly quirky ""Rule of Third's"" cinematography is immediately recognizable, and always serves to further his purpose of delivering a fantastically unique, engaging, and charming story.

The acting is superb, and even the young kids did a great job. This is actually very important, as two of the young kids are the main characters, and get a large amount of screen time. It's funny to see Bruce Willis in a very submissive role, contrary to his usual macho persona. He pulls it off surprisingly well though, and delivers a surprisingly good and well fit performance. Edward Norton and Bill Murray did fantastic, as usual, and succeeded in adding to the movie's atmosphere.

So yes, I would definitely recommend this movie, especially if you're a fan of any of Wes Anderson's other films. Awesome acting, directing, cinematography, and music really make this movie the whole package.",1437523200,4,1301,4.747787610619469

I've long sentimentalized the popular culture I remember.......sleeping bags lined with flannel prints of the north woods, Indian motifs, plaids, New England scenery and everything scouting.  This film romantically stylizes these elements, infusing all with a golden light of nostalgia.  The story draws from the innocence and rebelliousness of childhood fantasies of running away and living off the land, with ideal casting that includes a quirky pair of young romantic leads and endearingly fallible adults.  Add the most fantastic soundtrack since, well, ever.....and like me, you may want to own both the DVD and the soundtrack.

Part of the enjoyment of this movie for me is many of the awkward choices the director made. Characters that are a little off. Scenes that are a little off. Music that is a little off, but works perfectly. Plus, it's set on an island in 1965, so a wonderful flashback for anyone whoever lived in that time.",1434153600,,466,4.131868131868132

If Oscars were awarded to the best movie rather than the most popular then the next would go to Moonrise Kingdom. Im still smiling.

Delightfully quirky, Moonrise Kingdom is a triumph. Its curious, off-beat and has so many layers you may not fully appreciate it until much later as you relive the adventures mentally and realize the depth of the interactions.

I don't think this is a movie for children, or even for families. People seem to be thrown off by the main characters and think it is a kids' movie, but it isn't. It is PG-13, not PG or G. It is for an adult or late teen audience, and I think even the latter might not ""get it.""  The cast is great, and Willis' performance is especially touching. I always thought he was great when he takes it down a notch and actually acts (see ""Unbreakable"" or ""Sixth Sense"" or even Moonlighting""!).  I responded to someone else's review in what I hope was a respectful manner - I think Anderson's films are an acquired taste and you either like them or you don't. Neither should be faulted - it is just a personal choice. LOL....

Bob Balaban is delightful as the Narrator of the film.  Harvey Keitel and Jason Schwartman are both very funny in smaller roles.  Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward are really engaging as the main characters Sam and Suzy.

I'm sorry to say but this movie had us saying WTF! within minutes of the opening scenes, we were laughing hard and crying softly. This movie does take you back to your 1st childhood romance, that awkwardness that you fought to overcome will flood back in when you watch this... the story goes out of its way to over exaggerate some of the things in the story, but they serve to highlight that awkwardness.

5095943,2,B007L6VR6M,"Based on the high number of 5 star ratings and the fact that it was purported to be a good romance and comedy film (essentially suggesting that it was good for families), I took a chance. I had no problems with the comedy aspects of this movie. The humor was subtle, much like many British comedies, but I like that kind of off-beat humor. My biggest problem with the film was that it centered around an adolescent love affair between two 12 year olds, each of whom had problems with their parental relationships. They run away and decide flee to the wilderness where they could live out their lives together. While there is no nudity in this film, there are a few scenes where the sexual discussions and physical contact are inappropriate, especially for 12 year olds. Later in the movie, after they are located and brought back to the scout camp where the boy had escaped, one of the scout leaders agrees to marry them (kind of) and help them escape again. I was really turned off by the basic concept of the movie and by the portrayal that this kind of young love should be both accepted and encouraged.",1421366400,,1106,4.507462686567164

5096383,5,B007L6VR6M,"A delight.  Imaginative and creative.  The scenes always seem like a fantasy even though they are set mostly in reality.  This effect goes through all aspects of the film, including the cast.  For example, Bruce Willis in a non action role.  Bill Murray is perfect for the genre if it could be called a genre.  (The Wes Anderson Genre?).  There is a quirky narrator who we see (vs voiceover) and who even gets into the action.  Tilda Swinton plays ""Social Services"", a single character embodiment of bureaucratese.  It is a comedy told as a touching coming of age story. There are no hero's or villians just endearing human foibles.

This Amazon version of the film is the second time I watched this film and it seemed redacted from the first time I saw this film which was streamed from Netflix.  For example, there is a scene where the runaways name their camp by a lagoon as ""Moonrise Kingdom"" but that scene was not in this version of the movie.  Was it there and I just missed it?

5096475,5,B007L6VR6M,"In 2012 there were two films that absolutely charmed the socks off me. One was Beasts of the Southern Wild; the other was Moonrise Kingdom. Now normally, I'm not a big Wes Anderson fan. The only other Anderson film that I thought worth having in my library is Fantastic Mr. Fox. Even the recent Grand Budapest Hotel--for all its spectacular design and artistry--just didn't get to me. But Moonrise Kingdom is such a terrific time trip back to 1965--every detail perfect, in its depiction of a summer holiday island. Moreover, its whimsical and ravishing depiction of very young love--and the huge risks one takes for it--is spot on. The romance of Sam and Suzy is a wonderful portrait of the first clumsy, dazzling infatuation with the opposite sex. Their escape to live in the woods together is classic. And Anderson's cast? To die for! Murray, McDormand, Swinton, Norton, Willis, Keitel, Schwartzman, Balaban, et al. If you love romantic comedy, as I do, you have to have Moonrise Kingdom. One technical caveat, though. I bought the Blu Ray from Amazon UK, which presumably is the same as the US version. Most of the transfer is visually mediocre--not Blu Ray-sharp quality, but ordinary DVD visual quality. My advice, save money and get the DVD instead. P.S. There's apparently a Criterion version available which, I would hope, will have better image quality. It will certain cost a lot more.",1414281600,,1396,4.919491525423729
5096476,3,B007L6VR6M,"I'm glad Wes Anderson makes movies, I just don't know what he makes them for. This is not film noir. Yes, there's a story -- good guys and bad guys even, the bad guys being the oldest -- but does anyone really take it seriously? And that's the problem w his films. Two hours (or 90 minutes) of froth. I admire most Anderson films, I've never gotten lost in any of them, save The Royal Tenenbaums, his masterwork, for my money. And this is a very sweet story, I do get the sense that Sam and Suzy care for each other, belong together. But.... but...

Certainly worth watching, though not the best example of one of my film-watching rules of thumb: the better the performances by your least-favorite actors -- Edward Norton, Bruce Willis -- the better the film.",1414195200,,759,4.460431654676259
5096477,5,B007L6VR6M,"For me, the color and texture of this Wes Anderson film stands above all his others. Only GBH comes close to tying.

Anderson creates a world of misfits, awkward, but charming. Everyone is seeking an escape: via romamce, imagination, summer camp programs, costumes, thoughts of self pity, disowning, death and of course literally (escaping on the island).

Everyone is different and yet everyone is the same (hiding in their futile efforts to escape the banality of their chosen, regular lives). Only the two kids, outcasts who embrace their otherness,  rise above, discovering in reality what others can only imagine.

Their actions are the catalyst for everyone else on the island to finally own their own lives as well, achieving something far greater than all the hiding and pretending every could.

And the music is phenomenal.",1414108800,,832,5.133333333333334

5096513,3,B007L6VR6M,"I have very conflicting emotions about the films of Wes Anderson. On the pro side he has a visual eye for composition that seems antithetical to the nauseating hand held camera style and the films a beautiful to look at His choices of accompanying music is superb and draws from an ecclectic selection, especially The Darjeeling Limited which was the CD that occupied my portable CD player (this being before I had an Ipod) for an entire week after purchase. But on the negative side his films are hollow on the inside and his characters are oftentimes too quirky for their own good where it actually strains their likability as well their credibiliy even within context of the film. When I watch the Wizard of Oz I have no problem with Dorothy's trip to Oz or any of the inhabitants because it creates its own cinematic gravity but Wes Anderson makes his characters so stiffly mannered at times that they come of a life size dolls reciting recorded dialogue. In all his films (that I've at least) I felt no great interest or sympathy for any of his characters because there is never any real need to. I used to look forward to a new Wes Anderson film but lately (especially after The Hotel Budapest) not so much. As to Moonrise Kingdom I can only say that I liked the kids and their own adventure (despite a couple moments of sexuality that seemed creepy and out of place) but the rest of the cast were the standard assortment of Anderson oddities. Bill Murray sleepwalks through his few scenes. Edward Norton is annoying. Tilda Swinton is....well, Tilda Swinton and not much of a character. Bruce Willis was a bit more grounded in reality and was the best adult character on the film. There is a silly moment toward the end involving Willis and the two children and how this is resolved seems to be a big FU to the audience as they seemed to have painted themselves into corner they didn't have the imagination to get out of with any degree of plausibility. If Buster Keaton were given a similar scene he would have figured out a brilliant way to end it without just cutting away from it. I did not wholly dislike the film but it was very disappointing and is another example why Wes Anderson films are getting more and more superficial and frivilous as the years go on. He needs to find a good book to adapt (and I don't mean another Roald Dahl book) to apply his superior visual sense to. There is no shame in not producing one's own material.....Kubrick made a career out of adapting books---only his first two films were of his creation and he pretty much dismissed them as amateurish exercises. Herein lays the rub with Wes Anderson who should be making great films instead of wasting time and money on these cinematic bon bons.",1413936000,2,2735,4.560975609756097

The story takes place in the 60s, seemingly before the sexual revolution, and its sexual tension is innocent and child-like as appropriate to the time.  It was the first film for Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward and they play characters their own ages (both were born in late 1998).

If you are like me, you will love the whimsical, tongue in cheek humor of Wes Anderson plus his wonderful sets and photography. I did not pick up this movie until after I had seen Grand Budapest Hotel and thought that one to be terrific, although dressed much more in adult humor. The cast in Wes Anderson's movies must love his productions as well, since so many of them are repeat performers.

The two pre teen peformers do a terrific job of portraying the awkwardness, yet profound feelings of two youngsters finding each other and themselves in a youngsters' world in which they do not seem to fit. Bruce Willis plays a substantially different role than I was used to seeing him in. Ed Norton plays a nerdish scout master, who ends up doing the ""right thing"". The rest of the supporting cast is great as well. They just seem to be having a lot of fun. This is a movie where the kids act more like adults and vice versa.

Don't miss this one if you liked Second Hand Lions, Stand by Me, Breaking Away, Vision Quest, October Skies and undboubtedly others of the same genre I may have missed.

I just bought the DVD and will add it to my collection.for repeated viewing. Wes Anderson is a genius. As I watched the movie, I kept thinking, ""How does he think this stuff up?""

5096853,5,B007L6VR6M,"Here's another story from Wes Anderson about people who are very smart.  The interesting thing about smart people is that they are so stupid about some things even though they are smart about the things they know about.  This can be particularly poignant during the transition out of childhood, and was even more so back in the 1960s, when this story takes place, when the struggle to piece together sensible information about romance and sexuality took place without the internet or much cooperation at all from the adult world.

Yet even within the storm of misinformation, certain truths come shining through, so clear that a kid can invest major emotion and will into a relationship that befuddles and enrages adult observers.

Thus the world of Moonrise Kingdom.  There are structural limitations on the lives of the leading players, two adolescents who find a common spark, but along with the ambition of their connection comes the clear intuition or realization that these limitations are phony, or unfulfillable, or for some reason just do not and cannot apply to their own lives.

I have a great sympathy for the bizarre, romantic, inescapably intellectual search for meaning which this story follows.  I also love the setting, the surrounding characters, place, and time, and the chain of events which get us from point A to point Z.  This is almost too kooky to be fiction.",1407801600,,1384,4.961038961038961
5096854,4,B007L6VR6M,"Wes Anderson,is a director that has an untouched pristine vision,fully-story-boarded,in primary colours. He imagines closed worlds or communities,backed up by costumes and music,the characters are an extension of the clothes and manufactured sets. Does he repeat himself?Does he exclude reality?Is he trying to contrast amateur worlds with professional worlds,adults and adolescents,the messy grown-ups and the single-minded kids?Is first love like a state of Eden,with the island inlet where the children escape to to fully experience that love,no longer existent? Do the adults see this intensity beyond their control so threatening? Common to all his films isa cast of well known actors(Willis,Norton,Murray,McDormand,Keitel,Swinton) who are asked to play painted figurines in the background of this clockwork universe.

Andersons composer of choice is Benjamin Britten,his Noyes Fludde and The Young Persons Guide to the Orchestra. Britten wrote very well for children,providing the sound-world of the movie. Noyes Fludde suggests the world of amateurdramatics, that conjures up the spirit of this movie. Of course Hank Williams has been thrown in to echo to Captain Sharps(Willis) doleful presence. The two children are running away from worlds of emotional absence and trauma. Suzys(Kara Hayward) parents (Mc Dormand and Murray) alert the local sheriff Captain Sharp(with whom Mrs Bishop/McDormand is having an affair).Sam(Jared Gilman) has disappeared from a Scout camp, with his map-reading and bush-keeping skills to look after his beloved, Suzy,who brings along her binoculars,battery-operated record-player andfluorescent adventure books. They elude parents,police, social services and fellow Scouts,are caught and escape again against a backdrop of raging storms and parental discord. There is no development of character,there is only surface depth,deadpan emotions.

I liked the film,it was funny,clever,beautifully constructed,artfully composed,full of great pop music of the 60s,the two children were brilliant,full of choreographed zany energy and spontaneity,and there was enough insertion of accidental happenstance to upset the predetermined elements in Andersons head with tremendous luck.",1407715200,,2210,6.172077922077922

5096890,5,B007L6VR6M,"Wes Anderson's unique style is not for everyone, but personally I enjoy his movies. This movie is set in a sterilized view of 1965 on an island somewhere in the northeastern United States. Wes uses bright and colorful sets with intense, flamboyant characters yet deadpan humor similar to what he used in ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" and ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" and in some ways ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" but this movie has more ""laugh out loud"" scenes.

The plot is moderately complicated containing many situations and problems being dealt with by characters other than the two twelve-year-olds who ran away and things are further complicated by a major hurricane hitting the area.

There were a couple of plot points which I predicted before they materialized, but that did not take away from my enjoyment of the movie. I was disappointed with one scene between Bruce Willis and Tilda Swinton. When Captain Sharp (Willis) and Social Services (Swinton) face-off against each other I was reminded of a scenes from Walt Disney's ""The Last Electric Knight"" where detective Jake Rizo (Gil Gerard) faced-off against the supervisor from Social Services. Unfortunately in a comparison between the two Wes Anderson fell short of Walt Disney in fulfilling the potential for this scene. However, if you have not seen ""The Last Electric Knight"" I doubt you will feel let down by Wes Anderson's scene.

While on the subject of Bruce Willis, while all of the characters are unique Wes Anderson characters, I especially liked Bruce Willis as Captain Sharp. While the character still has Bruce Willis' unique subtlety, Captain Sharp was at the same time a unique Wes Anderson character. Bruce Willis' subtlety in his portrayal of characters and Wes Anderson's character's subtlety are a perfect match.

In summary, the way you felt about ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" and ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is probably how you will feel about ""Moonrise Kingdom"". Personally I loved them all.",1407283200,,1970,5.089783281733746

Set against the backdrop of an impending hurricane (you find this out in the first couple of minutes, so I'm not giving anything away), the tension slowly but constantly builds, compounded by other story elements that thicken the plot. The dialog is witty, if not a bit dry, particularly for the two main protagonists, but that's the film-maker's style; think Rushmore, or The Royal Tenenbaums. You either like it or you don't. I do. There's also a wonderful synchronicity between Anderson's unfolding story and Benjamin Britten's ""Noye's Fludde,"" both musically and thematically.",1405382400,,720,5.162393162393163

5097137,5,B007L6VR6M,"If you're a Wes Anderson fan, you'll LOVE Moonrise Kingdom.

If you've never seen a Wes Anderson film, this is a great place to start.

Moonrise Kingdom is a sad, sweet love story about two misfit, outcast pre-teens who plot to run away together in 1965. The touching script alone, filled with precocious children and sad adults, is worth the price of admission.

But of course, what you get with a Wes Anderson film is so much more. Striking colors. Exaggerated dolly shots. Sweeping camera pans. Sharp cuts and zooms. And of course, very quirky characters. Elements of magical realism (like an impossibly high tree house, a character struck by lightning, or the strangely elaborate infrastructure of the fictional Khaki Scouts) help you suspend your sense of place and realize that you're in a fairy tale.

And the soundtrack is inspired! the music switches back and forth between Benjamin Britten and Hank Williams, and it just works, propelling the story forward in a way that you just don't want it to stop.

I find all of his movies are a tribute to those many 20th century books written for the eight to twelve year old target market. Upon writing this, I realize the some what deadpan line delivery that has become a distinct aspect of his style, resembles that of a child reading just such a book and is probably intentional.  His films tend to always hit me with an unexpected, and usually unexplainable wave of emotion at the end, which always brings about reflection days after, and not just on the movie, but my own life. ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is no exception. He is an acquired taste that not everyone gets, which is also part of his appeal.  Upon looking back at his filmography I have a hard time putting any of his movies in front of another.

I may subscribe too much to the idea that the individual story should be a universal story and vice versa.  It may be my limitation but I usually find that ""quirky"" means I didn't get the universality of the characters.  I didn't lose myself in accepting the reality of these characters.

5097307,5,B007L6VR6M,The hyper-stylized world of Anderson takes you on a journey well beyond your couch. The writing perfectly captures the bitter sweetness of childhood-delving into darker aspects of growing up. The characters are complex; the performances of Kara Hayward and Jared Gilman are especially strong. This surface love story undergoes a metamorphosis into the poignant tale of two outcasts finding a place within each other.,1400889600,,416,5.515625
5097308,5,B007L6VR6M,"Wes Anderson does it again. This one is good for families, whereas other Wes Anderson films have dark moments that get violent or bloody. This doesn't have that. Its themes are travel and childhood and it is really really funny.",1400889600,,228,4.725
5097309,5,B007L6VR6M,"I loved the movie, but it's not a typical Bruce Willis movie.  If you want his usual action packed, speed 'em up, shoot 'em all, save the day type movie, then this is not for you.  It's just a simple movie about growing up. Yes, I would recommend this movie.",1400889600,,258,4.14
5097310,5,B007L6VR6M,"Like any Wes Anderson movie, ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is literally a journey into a place that, 'if it isn't real, it should be,' to paraphrase Winston. It has that amazing earnestness that children are capable of bringing to the silliest things, taken to absurdly mature extremes: running off to live with your lover; chasing down anybody who breaks your club's rules, armed with improvised maces with nails sticking out of them  this is Wes Anderson's Vietnam movie. It's the 60's generation, as twelve year olds. The ones who follow the rules, the counter-culture kids who break them, the clueless parents, and a storm coming to destroy them.
  You can see seeds that will grow into the dark themes of Anderson's ""Grand Budapest Hotel"" in this stuff, but it still has the weightlessness (in a great way) of a child's game, by and large. Anderson has always been exquisitely precise in his ability to depict death: Max sitting at his Mother's grave in ""Rushmore,"" Richie's suicide attempt in ""Tenenbaums,"" Sam the orphan here. The resonance of loss, the yearning for love  the perfect safety of an Arcadian realm, carved out of and separate from the world. It's the goal of so many of his best characters (almost all of them, really), and an act of will they share with their creator.
  If you've enjoyed any of Wes Anderson's movies, I think you'll love this one. If you've never seen one, this would be a great gateway drug. If you've seen them all... maybe you'll share my secret belief that Sam could grow up to be Bert Fischer. I don't know why that made me so happy, walking out of the theatre, but it really did.",1400716800,,1615,4.689045936395759
5097311,5,B007L6VR6M,"Wes Anderson is to film what primitive painters are to art. They communicate the way they see truth in a highly stylized way. Moonrise Kingdom is a film you must watch on Wes Anderson's terms, or you won't enjoy it. The cast  has first rate character actors like Harvey Keitel, Bob Balaban and Tilda Swinton. Bruce Willis plays a lonely police chief who runs a one-man police department. Bill Murray and Frances McDormand are lawyers locked in an unhappy marriage. But the stars of this film are the two young actors who play the star-crossed lovers: Jared Gilman as Sam and Kara Hayward as Suzy. These two are drawn together because they are kindred spirits and feel unloved and rejected by their peers and families. Sam actually is a foster child. I won't provide spoilers, but it's fair to say they have a series of adventures and mis-adventures which will both amuse and touch you. The film has a dramatic theme, but Anderson maintains an undercurrent of humor throughout. This is the kind of film you will want to see more than once. It not only has a coherent plot, but also has a happy ending.

It is loaded with excellent camera angles and has a unique form of narration. Perhaps most importantly, it is a movie about freedom, independence, and true love. It throws in some useful survival tips and also shows how great the Boy Scouts are. The two newcomers (Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward) play the 12 year olds and they are both so precious they steal the show hands-down from a star-studded cast.

As to the plot, well it's a contemporary take on Romeo and Juliet, with the astonishingly young hero and heroine, overcoming every challenge and villain in the way of love that transcends adolescence, set  in a sort of scout-style island summer camp with a vague Lord of the Flies undercurrent, and many adult malcontents adding amusing complexity to the story line.  These adults don't seem to have a clue what's going on right beneath their noses, being as self-absorbed as they are, with their own silliness.

5097470,4,B007L6VR6M,"Thanks to two appealing juvenile leads, Wes Anderson's ""Moonrise Kingdom"" succeeds in engaging and sometimes moving us.  Set in coastal New England in 1965, it is about two misfit thirteen-year-olds who fall in love (each, it seems, intuiting the other's ""misfittedness"") and decide to run away together and set up a home/camp where they can live isolated from the world of their parents and other adult authorities.  Since the boy, Sam, has survival skills (he runs away from a scout camp) and the girl, Suzy, is as resourceful in her way (she brings the scissors and other things), they do pretty well.  Suzy's parents are two lawyers (Bill Murray and Frances McDormand) who seem as indifferent to each other as they are to their children, and their marital conversation is mainly about the cases they're working on.  The fact that the mother communicates with her children via bullhorn is obviously both funny and pointed.  Sam is an orphan in foster care, and Edward Norton is the well-meaning scoutmaster of Sam's troop.  These three adults and the local sheriff (Bruce Willis) are the ones who have to deal with the fact that the young people have run off.

All of that seems ordinary enough, but Anderson frames the story in interesting ways, both visually and dramaturgically.  The adult world of the scout camp and Suzy's home is presented in terms of a high degree of linear organization: rooms are boxy and behaviour is regimented to a cartoonish extent, and the regimentation of the scout troop is very clear, and the impression that the viewer gets is of two young people trying to get away from life in a cartoon and escape into something more authentic.  The parents and scoutmaster are emotionally incompetent to a comic degree, and the only adult who seems to have an inkling of the kind of freer life the young people want is the sheriff, who in a climactic scene faces down Social Services.  Tilda Swindon literally calls herself ""Social Services"" and that tells us all we need to know about the ""flattening"" of most of the adult figures in the movie.  Swindon is marvelous in the role, and Bruce Willis as her antagonist gives a performance of great charm.  Bill Murray here has a role that fits well with his usual deadpan affectless schtick, but he remains, for me at least, a very limited actor.  In the course of the movie most of the adults unfreeze to some extent.  McDormand, who is presented as being drawn to the sheriff, has a touching scene with her daughter at the end.

Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward are Sam and Suzy.  Neither actually says ""There must be more to life than this"" as they view the adult world, but the seriousness with which they take both their escape (very carefully planned) and their affection is both funny and endearing.  They are trying to act as the kind of adults that they want to be -- not the kinds of adults who have shaped their lives thus far. The deadpan seriousness with which they take all this is funny -- they even go through a form of marriage and unembarassedly acknowledge their sexual feelings, which seem to them to have nothing to do with their love, which has more to do with their mutual recognition as misfits.  The young actors pull off Anderson's conceptions of their characters just about perfectly.  One way of understanding them, I think, is to say that they want a narrative, and it's no accident that Suzy takes half-a-dozen storybooks along on the escape, and we see her read aloud from them on several occasions.  This perhaps clues us to the idea that adult life in the movie has stopped -- it has no ongoing story, at least as far as the young people can perceive, and no story means no future, so they decide to create their own.  Maybe with the onset of adolescence we all do this -- adolescent ""rebellion"" is a bit of a cliche, but here Anderson manages to find a fresh way of representing it.  Maybe too the allusions to Britten's children's opera ""Noyes Flood"" (based on a medieval drama about Noah) are deployed to suggest this: the flood (looked at it one way) is a chance for a new start, and it is seeing Suzy dressed for the part of a raven in a local performance of the opera that wins Sam's heart, so to speak.  The movie ends after its own flood (a hurricane), and if Bob Balaban, the narrator who frames the whole story, is to be believed, it ushers in a sense of renewal that extends even to the crops in subsequent years.  With that suggestion, Anderson reminds us of the apparent natural magic of renewal, not only in the natural cycle but in the revelations that can follow crises in narratives.  (To put it like that sounds heavy-handed, but the movie itself avoids the portentousness that thematic analysis is prone to fall into!)

I'll avoid spoilers, and say nothing about the fact that there are really two escapes, the details of the storm, the scout troop's pursuit of the runaways, or the sheriff's defense of Sam.  It's a comic movie, finally, and it clocks in at just about 90 minutes, so it doesn't drag.  The degree of stylization with which the adult world is presented keeps us at the distance required to appreciate both the pains of growing up, the dangers of having grown up, and the need to keep open the possibility of change and (if we're lucky) growth.",1395964800,,5280,4.624197002141328

I would think they wouldn't want one of his box office disasters on their resume.

This one made less than $46,000,000 worldwide according to MOJO.  None of his movies have actually made much more than that, and some a lot less.  Why?  Because no one likes what he is putting out.

5097537,5,B007L6VR6M,"Set in 1965, ""Moonrise Kingdom"" captures a summer adventure/romance between two quirky outcast 12-year olds, Sam and Suzy. Suzy is the only daughter of the odd characters played by Frances McDormand and Bill Murray, both lawyers who are certainly not vying for parent of the year award. They both seem distant and mildly depressed, and in general uninterested in their 4 children. Their home near the sea on a New England island is beautifully designed set featuring large perfectly symmetrical, brightly hued rooms. It seems like a perfect place for creative children to exercise their minds. The symmetry design is carried out throughout the film, almost to excess, but is certainly a defining feature.

Sam is a 12-year old orphan, residing in a foster home and spending the summer in Khaki Scouts camp, lead by Ed Norton. Sam and Suzy carry on a pen pal correspondence for a while, before they agree to run away together. Sam has planned a scouting expedition in great detail, and Suzy brings along her battery operated phonograph and favorite books. The relationship between these two like minded adolescents is charming and fun, though it borders on the uncomfortable when then start to explore their sexuality.

The search for the two runaways is lead by Bruce Willis, only member of the Island Police Force. The Khaki Scout troop is also pressed into service to locate their fallen comrade.

""Moonrise Kingdom"" is not exactly a drama, not exactly a comedy, but is certainly interesting, quirky and whimsical. The set design and cinematography are stunning, the all-star cast play understated roles, and the whole adds up to an interesting and entertaining experience.",1393804800,,1675,5.083636363636364

5097570,5,B007L6VR6M,"I purchased this lovely little DVD for $2.00 at my local store. It was originally supposed to be rented out, but no one rented it- and the poor little thing was left in a dusty pile in a 'sale bin'. Such an undeserving place for a magnificent film. I'd read many beautiful reviews about it online and always wanted to see it- but living in rural Alaska we don't have any place to buy such a thing (and I rarely buy movies anyways). So when I came across this at such a very affordable price, I snatched it up, carefully carried it home, and watched it almost immediately.

I loved it dearly, but I know it has received some interesting view-points from its audience. The content, although childish, is quite mature. There are a few scenes many may find inappropriate. But I found them truthfully captured for what they are- an accurate portrayal of pre-adult love. They are tastefully captured, as not to exploit the children, but rather to simply show the world what they are experiencing. The awkward yet comfortable first experiences of finding 'the one' (or at least the one you think is 'the one').

The scenery is magnificent and the acting by all people involved is exquisite. I was especially blown away by the younger characters and how well each one of them shown on screen. The dialogue, although quick-witted and sarcastically-humorous was delightful in it's own unique way. This is the first film I have seen by this director, but after watching it I look forward to viewing more of his work. I absolutely loved how simply the dialogue was, yet how complex the storyline it was involved in happened to be. It was a combination of amazing script writing and well-done filmography. All of the actors and actresses played their parts just right. I really couldn't imagine anyone else being cast for each of the parts. I fell in love with each and every character (aside from, of course, the social worker- who I'm fairly sure was not meant to fall in love with).

For those who have not yet witnessed the movie and are reading reviews in hopes of an overview here is a short bit about what this movie is about: The movie takes place on a lovely little island. On the island there is a camp where boys meet and essentially become, what is similar to, boy scouts (in a more modern and less judgmental sense). One boy who attends this camp is a foster child, moved amidst many homes, and in dire need of a direction in life. On the other side of the island lives a family with two parental lawyers and four odd-in-their-own-way children. The eldest is a girl, whom I related to quite closely. A girl stuck in the position of moving forward to adulthood a bit too fast, being held back by parents who don't care as much as they should, yet too much in the wrong way. What more fitting couple than the lost foster child and the strong-willed daughter of a lawyer couple. So, alas, they run away together. And so the story begins. Young love in it's truest form, amidst not the most intelligent of decisions.

The storyline was beautifully drawn out in a way that explores adolescent love for what it is; often condemned by adults and yearned for by those young and lucky enough to find it. I know that many people seem to think otherwise, and find the storyline to be inappropriate. The film does accurately portray some of the more... adult-themed actions of young adults. Many find this distasteful. But I found it honest, and the backdrop it was told amidst was just beautiful. I'm in love, and Moonrise Kingdom is among one of my very favorite movies. I can't really compare it to anything else- it's wonderful all on its own.",1391472000,,3635,4.570552147239264

5097575,4,B007L6VR6M,"This movie is absolutely enchanting IF you want to reconnect with the child you were at age 12... the kid who believed all kinds of surreal things could happen, just because you wished them to happen.

This isn't a simple, happy story. It's complex. It has some dark aspects and implications. It ends in a way that will make you say, ""Oh.""

And then, if you're like me, you'll watch it again, a week later.

I bought this because a friend suggested it, to get a better understanding of stereotypes and their use in stories.  This movie IS wall-to-wall stereotypes... and they're people we've all known and loved. Or hated. Or just had to stare at because they were... well, stereotypes, and you just can't get enough of that weirdness.

This is probably a love-it-or-hate-it movie.  I loved it.  I liked it far better than Royal Tenenbaums, which had its own charm but didn't capture youthful idealism as well as this movie does.

If you like predictable movies well-grounded in reality, run in the other direction. This isn't for you.

If you like offbeat films that require suspending disbelief -- and make that effort worthwhile -- this movie is a must-see.

The acting is flawless. The artistic direction is a delight. The casting is perfect. The makeup and costuming... utterly eccentric and almost a parody of that era, but -- at the same time -- not too far from fact.

There's one somewhat intimate scene that made me uncomfortable. It's not extreme. It's not total nudity or anything. I'm sure it's consistent with the rest of the film. I'm sure 12-year-olds do that sort of thing, and I'm sure it fit the writer's creative vision. It just bothered me, because the actors really _were_ 12-years-old. (I checked.)

Wes Anderson gets does all of the things that draw him criticism (i.e. quirky love story, bad dad, precious art direction, over head shots, check lists of items, etc.) but in this, his first period piece, it all comes together and meshes perfectly. There are some very cartoonish, out of this world moments in this movie that shouldn't make sense but do. The mail lead isn't always the most likable kid but the relationship between he and Suzy is so sweet that it can be forgiven.

5097665,4,B007L6VR6M,"Moonrise Kingdom tells the story of two troubled, misunderstood kids who meet and bond over their inability to fit in. Its certainly not a revolutionary plot, but this movie is anything but run-of-the-mill. Quite the opposite actually  its fantastic. Equal parts quirky, charming, witty, and genuinely funny, its a deft and completely distinctive rendition of this well-worn tale.

Therere just so many great things to say about this film. Right from the opening credits it establishes a very unique tone with the musical selection, setting, and (most notably) the camerawork. The cinematography remains consistently amazing throughout the movie, utilizing really creative, often symmetrical shot compositions and lots of side-tracking pans. The visuals play an integral role in setting the off-kilter and playful atmosphere of the film (think Fantastic Mr. Fox, Wes Andersons last film).

The cast is also excellent across the board, and whats really impressive is that the two child leads manage to steal the show from huge names like Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Frances McDormand, and Bill Murray. And the success of the two leads isn't just due to acting ability, its also simply because the characters are really well-crafted and endearing. They both have an unabashed eccentricity and deadpan humor (think Napoleon Dynamite) that just makes them very likable and easy to root for. The deadpan humor is also a very integral part of the success of the film. Theres definitely a serious message here about never compromising who you are to fit in with crowd, but its delivered in a very light-hearted, good-humored way that never takes itself too seriously.

Overall, Moonrise Kingdom is a movie that gets nearly everything right. Its a movie during which you just cant help but smile from beginning to end and which is bursting at the seams with creativity, wit, and charm. The only real criticisms I can muster is that the middle third drags just a tad and that I wish there was a bit more resolution with Mr. and Mrs. Bishop (the parent characters of the female lead). Aside from these minor quibbles though, the movie impresses on every level and is a thoroughly entertaining and heartwarming affair.

Wonderful performances by the two child stars and the entire cast.  Stunning cinematography of a beautiful natural landscape and clever, intricate architectural set pieces.  The adult characters sympathetic to the plight of the two runaways at the center of the story (Ed Norton, Scout Master, and Bruce Willis, local cop) are particularly poignant in their connection with the boy.  Each character is treated with humor, sensitivity and love (except for the bully and the state child services rep).  As always, Wes Anderson creates a very particular world - life on an island that feels very remote and protected from the modern world.  It's a wonderful world to inhabit for 90 minutes.

5097705,5,B007L6VR6M,"This is a film...not a movie. Now my 2nd favorite Anderson film behind Rushmore. Anyone who knocks this film completely misses the whole point of film as an art form in general or doesn't know of the directors past works. Set in the 60's on a remote coastal community, the story is basically a forbidden love story between two slightly weird 12 year old. Yes its quirky, yes its long, and yes the biggest named actors are not the leads, but the film is pure art, and simply beautiful. Think of your first kiss...and how it was awkward, mysterious, a little scary, and yet completely AMAZING!!! That is this film, so if the world hasn't completely broke you yet, and you still have a little kid inside you somewhere, you cant help but find enjoyment in this film.
  Ive always believed that the point of films are to entertain and take you on an adventure. They either bring you back, take you far away, or expose you to aspects of the world that is foreign to you...and through that, evoke an emotion that will last past the closing credits. A movie, on the other hand, is really just eye candy that is in one ear and out the other, has no redeemable qualities, and evokes no thought or emotion other than basic caveman  s***. The people that trashed this film were obviously looking for a mindless hollywood blockbuster. Art is not for everyone.",1377043200,,1346,4.530864197530864

5097708,5,B007L6VR6M,"What can I say?  ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is simply charming, and if you don't get it, you don't get it.  It's not a perfect movie:  Jared Gilman, the boy lead, is uneven (he's best when not speaking), and the themes and execution are a little too close to another Wes Anderson gem, ""Rushmore.""  But if you can get past that, the movie is well worth your time.  Kara Hayward is sweetly teed off as Suzy, that girl from childhood you always hoped had the potential to grow to independence without instead disappointing you and becoming a self-loving twit, and I don't know that I've ever seen Bruce Willis or Edward Norton in better form.  Bill Murray, Harvey Keitel, Bob Balaban, and Frances McDormand are all used sparingly, and less really is more.  What of the plot?  To describe it here would rob you of the joy of simply experiencing it, but suffice it to say, in an age of ham-fisted garbage like ""The Notebook"" and ""Twilight,"" it's a refreshing coming-of-age comedy romance for the rest of us, much more ""Amelie"" than ""Titanic,"" thank goodness.  As a former Boy Scout (yeah, I sometimes have a hard time believing that, too), I'm also stunned at how well the movie captures the oeuvre of just what that means.  Sure, they're called the ""Khaki Scouts"" here, but there are the same kooky, pseudo-military attitudes mixed in with an aw-shucks saccharine purity -- Anderson steeps his production in such authenticity that I could smell the musty canvas tents again, feel the scratchy cotton of the heavy olive drab shirts.  And it's obvious that he's enjoying what he's doing, creating a movie that has the off-kilter choreography of a puppet show mixed in with a movie's sense of the grand, wrapped up in the dewy remembrances of summers gone by.",1376438400,3,1744,4.7227722772277225

I liked the photography - beginning I thought the house resembled a doll house and picturesque family, same goes for the scout club.  I thought the plot was good and original.  The acting was very well done.  My favorite characters are Suzy Bishop (Kara Hayward) and Scout Master Randy Ward (Edward Norton).  Suzy was bad a$$ and Randy was a cute dork.

5097713,5,B007L6VR6M,"Okay, so you know a Wes Anderson film when you see it. They have a look and a feel. Visually they pop with color. Dialogue is usually clipped and clever and the characters and situations ooze a similar quirkiness. He even managed the same feel in the stop-motion animated ""Fantastic Mr. Fox."" But these elements can often feel ""schticky"" and have in many of his movies left me disconnected or disinvested. In short, not taking them very seriously.

Not so with Moonrise Kingdom. Moonrise Kingdom for me is a home run because Mr. Anderson's devices all work here throughout and actually help connect the viewer with the movie. The colors and cinematography work perfectly in telling the story of two angst-filled tweens running away together on a tiny (fictitious) island off the New England coast. The setting is an odd little place with odd little customs and lifestyle so the quirkiness of the characters and situations work naturally.

The performances of the ensemble cast are also spot on and the two new-comers in the lead roles have an endearing chemistry. Mr. Anderson also treats any physicality between the kids with taste and humor and though they are both troubled and have chosen a troubled and hopeless path, you root for them anyway.

Moonrise Kingdom scores for me because it deals with innocent, uncomplicated emotions, in an innocent, uncomplicated setting and delivers its story in a fun, uncomplicated package that is well paced, with a well balanced mix of interesting characters, beautiful locations, clever dialogue and emotions with which we can all identify. As I've said to many who have disagreed with me, ""What's not to like?""",1375488000,3,1654,4.9855072463768115

5097729,5,B007L6VR6M,"My girlfriend and I love this film.  The 1st time we rented it, the second time we bought it because we knew we'd want to watch it again and again. If you've seen a film directed by Wes Anderson (The Royal Tenenbaums, The Darjeeling Limited, etc.) you will already be familiar with his directorial style. He has a way of portraying the quirky side of human nature that I have loved in all his films, and this film is his best yet. Mr. Anderson portrays various aspects of each character's internal dialogue without putting the dialogue into words. Each character filters events from within his or her own reality construct coming to completely different and sometimes contradictory or mutually exclusive conclusions about it. It's as if they are in different movies. Often two characters with contradictory interpretations of their lives will be intimately related, or romantically involved.  Mr. Anderson doesn't spell it out literally for the viewer.  Rather, what you're supposed to be getting from a particular scene is implied.  Anderson assumes that the audience will have sufficient intelligence to follow the story.  I like being given the benefit of the doubt. I imagine that while the cast and crew are making the film there is debate about whether the point they are trying to make in a particular scene has been illustrated clearly enough. In this case I think the film wonderfully conveys the unspoken thoughts and feelings of the characters.

To conclude, this film is a keeper.  It's a joy to watch and every time I watch it I notice things that I hadn't seen before.  I know what's going to happen, but I'm still entertained every time I watch it. I cry every time too, but that's one of the reasons I like this film so much.  :-)",1372982400,2,1746,4.774086378737541

This is my review:

Moonrise Kingdom is another wonderful Wes Anderson film that, like so many of his other films, contains a few wonderful elements:

- geeky kids
- a cutaway of the characters' living environment
- a wimpy fight sequence near the end
- some sort of natural calamity

Not so sure about the last one, but all of these happen in Moonrise Kingdom, which does its best to re-create Waris Hussein's 1971 puppy love comedy Melody (also known as Sealed With A Loving Kiss), but with his inimical ironic style. Set in rural America in the 1960s, it also has a soundtrack of quirky little musical gems, such as April March's ""Les Temps De L'amour"", and Benjamin Britten's famous "" The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra (Introduction/Theme; Fugue)"", as directed by Leonard Bernstein. A strange young orphan and an odd girl run away from home, get married, and build up a posse of other strange youths, most of them fellow boy scouts, and a sympathetic police captain played by Bruce Willis (?!?!). Harvey Keitel makes a cameo appearance as a grizzled old Scout master, and there's all sorts of bizarre Scout politics involved (John Cusack is a scout leader who, initially disgraced when he loses his squad, who manages to redeem himself). Tilda Swinton is also resplendent as a very serous social worker. A really wonderful film.",1371254400,,1419,4.779591836734694
5097747,2,B007L6VR6M,"I really did.  All strapped in ready for some side-splitting laughs and guffaws and yet these movies (Moonrise Kingdom, The Life Aquatic, Royal Tenebaums) really don't hold a candle to the original Rushmore perhaps due to the era in which they were released (Bush/Obama 2000s vs Clinton 90s).  I know they're not sequels or supposed to be related in an way even though many of the actors are the same.  It's just that as supposed comedies, there's a hell of a lot of down time between laughs, too many serious moments and an emphasis on cleverness and useless information that I just don't need.  These generally aren't funny movies, they're interesting movies, some scenes of which are wonderfully filmed and acted out.  Beautiful scenery, sets, imagination, special effects.  All the films have their humorous moments but for the most part, they seem to rely and focus on life's quirky little oddities, strange coincidences and the ""just keep it safe"" factor is in full swing, rarely venturing into LOL territory as Rushmore seemed to accomplish at all times.  Bill Murray has done a wonderful job over the past decade (or maybe more) of reprising his role as some kind of manic-depressive, mid-life crisis husband or divorced father of three who can't wait to frown on camera or say something average.

His genteel rebellious streak is unlike any other.  His films feel like a parallel universe with characters much like ourselves who are slightly off kilter.  ""Moonrise Kingdom"" finds Anderson at his most romantic.  Our protagonists are Sam (Jared Gillman) and Suzy (Kara Hayward) two disaffected adolescents who find each other and run away from unfeeling authority figures to explore the island terrain and their feelings for one another.  Gillman and Hayward are natural and unaffected and at their tender ages can't be faulted for not tapping into the ironies contained in Anderson and Roman Coppola's script.  The ironies, however, are not lost on the adult cast members (Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, et. al.).  ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is a piece with Anderson's iconoclastic body of work.

5097756,5,B007L6VR6M,"As two 12-year-olds calmly discuss the pros and cons of getting married, beside them a Khaki Scout drops from a two-story platform onto a trampoline, proceeding to turn somersaults as the earnest conversation progresses.  And that, ladies and gents, aptly demonstrates the highly nuanced, charming quirkiness of Wes Anderson's MOONRISE KINGDOM. Until seeing this film I was unaware of this director, but count me in as a fan now.  Anderson can make a film that not only is entertaining, charming, and downright funny--he can create images and sets and combos of colors that are as mesmerizing as they are haunting.

MOONRISE KINGDOM is the story of two tweeners--an orphaned boy (Jared Gilman) who deserts his Khaki Scout troop, and a troubled girl (Kara Hayward) who runs away from home to join him in the wilderness of a New England island in the late summer, as a massive storm approaches.  The pair develops a budding camaraderie and romance (all tastefully done, I might add), and a firm determination to elude the considerable search that's been launched to find them.  Gilman and (especially) Hayward have considerable talent; I look forward to following their acting careers.

Yet MOONRISE KINGDOM is peaked by its stellar ensemble cast, including Edward Norton as a gung-ho Scout Master, Bruce Willis as the island's lone policeman guiding the search, Bill Murray and Frances McDormand as the girl's frightened (yet dysfunctional) parents, Tilda Swinton as a stark, bureaucratic Social Services worker, and Harvey Keitel as a take-no-prisoners Scout Commander.  Special kudos to Bob Balaban, playing the story's deadpanned narrator that constantly had me in stitches.  In fact, if you don't have a grin on your mug from start to finish of the delightfully nuanced MOONRISE KINGDOM, then maybe you just need to lighten up.

5097765,5,B007L6VR6M,"just finished watching Wes Anderson's Moonrise Kingdom, which is, hands down, one of the most whimsical, magical films I've encountered in many moons. An Anderson fan, I hesitated to see this when it was released as mixed reviews (which usually happens in Anderson films anyway) many discounting it as ""a series of poses and postures"" often singling out the ""awful"" acting of the two leads discouraged me. Well, I was a silly goose, and those critics, as earnest as they may have been, couldn't have been more wrong in describing this thing if they'd tried.

The leading couple, Sam (Jared Gilman) and Suzy (Kara Hayward) are a pair of emotionally challenged 12 year olds who fall in love during a performance of Britten's Noye's Fludde. I couldn't imagine either role cast better than here, nor more nuanced performances coaxed by a director who actually ""gets"" kids - particularly troubled ones. The story begins when Sam, a highly decorated, though not well liked cadet Sam flees the confines of Camp Ivanhoe and his Khaki Troop (think Boy Scouts of America) to run away with unpredictable and misunderstood Suzy. Their inventory for survival includes a kitten in a basket (with accompanying cans of gourmet cat food), a battery operated record player and a suitcase full of stolen library books. My kind of kids. Living on a remote island (about to be hit by the storm of the century) they can't really escape far . . . or can they? Through (several) ensuing chases, unsuccessful captures, and re-escapes the story grows exponentially, layer by layer as it introduces us to the foibles, quirks and ticks of the residents as our Island Romeo and Juliet explore their burgeoning sexuality (all tastefully within the confines of its PG-13 rating).

Speaking of Noye's Fludde, Anderson had me from the start, as any movie that bookends its opening and closing scenes with Britten's Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra, has already got plenty going for it! And Britten's music (in addition to large chunks of Noye) looms large throughout, as does that of Schubert (An die Musick), Mozart (Cosi's Soave sia il vento) Saint Sans (Carnival of the Animals) and Hank Williams. So, too, does the score by composer Alexandre Desplat who pays tribute to Britten (remarkably directly in the closing credits, where his own ""Guide to the Orchestra"" is narrated by the film's hero).  Rarely does one find film music these days that is this integrally bound to the storytelling that it's virtually impossible to imagine the story without it.

Anderson sets his tale circa 1965 on the fictional New England island of New Penzance. The nod to Gilbert and Sullivan is here more dramatic than musical, but nonetheless unmistakable. The parallels between Moonrise's young Sam, and Pirates' Frederic are plentiful. While entirely original, Moonrise nonetheless feels punctuated throughout as it evokes gauze-covered memories of other things. It was constantly conjuring fleeting instances causing my mind to race to discover connections between it and Romeo and Juliet, The Tempest, The Keystone Cops, Lord of the Flies, and more. Robert D. Yeoman's remarkably nuanced cinematography makes every frame look like a page from an old family photo album, capturing summer camp, skinned knees and emotional secrets barely covered through veils of thin smiles. Moonrise Kingdom, indeed.

Though Sam and Suzy are the heart of the film, Moonrise is truly an ensemble piece and Anderson is able to evoke marvelous, sometimes larger than life, performances from an inspired cast of Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton, Jason Schwartzman, Harvey Keitel and Bob Baliban (who serves as narrator/Greek Chorus), and all of whom create the believable, quirky, characters who populate this magical island town.

In my estimation critics who found this ""stifling"" simply are never going to like films made by the likes of Mr. Anderson, directors who essentially eschew The Hollywood Way, as they put out beautiful, boutique films for small audiences willing (or wishing) to escape into the fantastic worlds they've created for us. For those not willing to do so, I suppose these films really can be, as one critic described Moonrise ""a long, dull exercise in alternative comedy."" For the rest of us . . . it's a dream.",1369094400,2,4321,5.096045197740113

It's almost like robot-speak.  This becomes tedious, affected and deadening, and unfortunately the script is far less eccentric or humorous than it would seem to believe itself to be.  Here's about as close to any real bond as we get between the runaway boy and girl, starting with the girl: ""It feels hard."" ""Do you mind?"" ""I like it."" ""You can touch my chest.  I think they're gonna grow more."" I mean, is this for real?  It sounds like Alvin and the Chipmunks by way of David Mamet.

The audiences enjoyment of Moonrise Kingdom really depends on their like for Wes Anderson movies. If only one thing can be said about Wes Anderson its that he definitely has his own style. Anderson movies are usually slower paced in oddly detailed environments with intelligent dialogue and a sense of comedy that is exceptionally dry. Moonrise Kingdom is no exception to these conventions, however it falls short because all of the oddities don't amount to anything of particular interest this time.

Moonrise Kingdom is a love story between children. Sam (Jared Gilman) is a Khaki Scout who leaves the organization to run away with a local girl, Suzy (Kara Hayward). When his escape is discovered by Scout Master Ward (Edward Norton) an investigation is started involving the rest of the scouts and the Captain of the local police, Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis). Bill Murray and Frances McDormand are the Bishops, Suzys parents. The two are very confrontational and constantly get in the way of the search for the run away kids. There is never a sense of danger for the movie, thats not what Moonrise Kingdom is about. It is a quirky love story set in a real enough era but with a surreal twist.

The movie never ramps up enough that the audience is on the edge of their seat about anything. There is no question about the progression of the movie or the end results. Even when new elements are introduced to the audience it is clear where things are going to end up.

Moonrise Kingdom boasts a very solid cast but no breakout performances. Gilman and Hayward are solid child actors but the deadpan delivery that comes with Anderson movies may be the cause for that. Bill Murray is a staple in Anderson movies and usually provides a good amount of the offbeat humor. In Kingdom he is more a placeholder than anything. Frances McDormand has never been a great actress, she got lucky with Fargo and that is the sole reason she continues to receive acting work. Edward Norton was probably the funniest performance of the movie. Norton is usually an edgy and very serious actor but in Kingdom he plays the complete opposite.

Unfortunately the movie lacked substance so there isn't much more to say. Its one of Andersons weaker movies. In a year filled with amazing performances, break out stars, and truly original movies it is a complete mystery how Moonrise Kingdom got nominated for an Academy Award at all.",1368489600,3,2429,4.773809523809524

There is a strange feeling that the very unreal characters are so very real.  The film suspends you in a state of unreality that just allows you to let go while watching and kind of forget how uninteresting our own lives can be while you follow these very obscure people down their rabbit holes.

Overall,  touching, sad, raw, and hilariously sarcastic tones permeate the movie.  The characters are so quirky but believable that you find yourself saying ""did they really just say that?""

The film, of course, has usual Andersonian quirkiness, but the story is solid and provides laughs and touching dramatic moments.

Highly original in both concept and style -as is customary with any Wes Anderson production - ""Moonrise Kingdom"" nevertheless proves that, even in the most skillful of hands, a little quirkiness can go a long way.

Set in 1965, this surrealistic indie comedy focuses on two misfit children - one a twelve-year-old orphan and the other the daughter of two whacked-out parents - who run off to a remote New England island so they can live in isolation with one another, right as a hurricane is about to hit the area.

The talented Jared Gilman and Kara Haywood play the two social outcasts, while the adults are portrayed by Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Edward Norton, Bruce Willis, Tilda Swinton, Jason Schwartzman and Harvey Keitel as an assortment of parents, troop leaders, detectives and social services officials. The irony is that most of the adults turn out to be even more bizarre and dysfunctional than the children who've run away because they just don't fit in.

Co-written  by Roman Coppola and Wes  Anderson and directed by Anderson, ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is overflowing with wit, striking imagery and on-the-mark deadpan performances. But the archness does get to be a bit much at times, and the atonal, emotionless line readings eventually take their toll on the audience.

It's a clever and likable enough little trifle that, even at a relatively brief 94-minute running time, winds up overstaying its welcome. But the critics sure seem to love it.",1364601600,6,1471,5.004098360655738

For two preteen lovers, their love will create a fireball of drama for a peaceful island. I've seen many of Wes Anderson's films and they've truly been enjoyable, but ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is definitely a one of a kind romance that would be impossible to recreate.

The film takes place on a small New England island in 1965. We see some of the island's sights and landmarks that makes it so somberly. The story starts when one morning, a Khaki Scout troop leader (Edward Norton) discovers that one of his scouts has gone AWOL. So with the help of his entire troop and the local sheriff (Bruce Willis), they're going to find him by any means necessary.

Later, we find our runaway boy named Sam (Jared Gilman), who is secretly meeting Suzy (Kara Hayward), the girl he's been infatuated since they first met a year ago and have been communicating in letters since. They had made a pact to meet each other and their relationship starts to become more deeper. The two make their way through rocky hills, pine tree forests, and the more they're together, the more their love grows.

Meanwhile, the residents of the island go on a wild goose chase to find the two lovers. When Sara's parents (Bill Murray, Frances McDormand) hear about her disappearance, they are more than shocked about it. But they discover that the island people are looking, Sam and Suzy are determined to outplay they, no matter what the consequences are.

If you're expecting a sappy lovey-dovey teen romance, well forget it. This romance is just so unbelievable and so genuine that you'll be aching to see what's next. The cast is very superb, with Gilman and Hayward that won me over, as well as small roles by Jason Schwartzman and Tilda Swinton. There are a few moments in the film that will surprise you, as well as you laugh a bit. Wes Anderson fans will call this his best, while others will call it so-so. For me, it's a romance I wouldn't mind seeing over and over again.

Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0

 Some may say 'Moonrise Kingdom' is charming and whimsical. Others might say it's simply trivial. Perhaps the best assessment is somewhere in between. One thing for sure is that the cinematography is a visual feast. Set in 1965 on the fictional New England island of New Pezance, it was actually shot around Narragansett Bay in Rhode Island.

'Moonrise' is formulaic up to a point. Quirky comedies usually feature protagonists who are outsiders, non-conformist, slightly emotionally unstable and victims of persecution by an established order. In this case, Sam Shakusky and Suzy Bishop fit the bill. A year before the break into the 'Second Act' where Sam and Suzy run off to their 'Moonrise Kingdom', they become pen pals after meeting at a church performance of Noye's Fluddle. A year later, Sam, who has a history of acting out behavior, finds himself ostracized by his Scout troop and then is dropped by his foster family after he disappears at his 'Khaki Scout' summer camp. Suzy comes from a more 'stable' family of dysfunctional attorney parents but also has behavior problems, and ends up running off with her 'soul mate', the equally troubled Sam.

Quirky comedies also feature a group (or groups) who persecute our quirky heroes. In this case, Sam is the subject of vituperation by his scout troop. Similarly, Suzy is rejected by her parents, who have no tolerance for her rebellious ways. Perhaps the most unpleasant scene in 'Moonrise Kingdom' is when the Scout Troop attempts to chase down Sam out in the forest. Fortunately, director Wes Anderson later redeems his antagonists. The scout troop realizes that they've been bullying Sam and finally decide to help him. Suzy's parents also realize the error of their ways and employing their legal acumen, aid Captain Sharp as he adopts Sam and prevents the Social Services matron from hauling Sam off to the Juvenile Refuge.

With both actors playing wondrously against type, Bruce Willis and Edward Norton as Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis) and Scout Master Randy Ward (Edward Norton), also play characters worthy of redemption. Sharp, who's been having an affair with Suzy's mother, Laura Bishop, ends the affair and later nobly adopts Sam. And Randy, who initially loses his scout troop after they split camp aiding Sam, saves his superior, Commander Pierce, after Pierce demotes him for incompetence. Only the Social Services matron, who represents bureaucracy, finds no redemption in Anderson's redemptive pageant.

'Moonrise Kingdom' feels a bit too long especially when Sam and Suzy run away TWICE. And we also see one too many chases throughout the film. Nonetheless, Wes Anderson employs a number of great creative touches that distract us from the drawn out narrative. I'm referring of course to the fictional books he creates for Suzy as well employing the marvelous Benjamin Britten music.

One must realize that Anderson's characters are farcical types--not meant to be at all realistic. Rather, he's gently poking fun at those neurotic type of adults who lack insight into their own behavior. Fortunately, Anderson ends things on a positive note, as most of the adults such as the Bishops and Captain Sharp, redeem themselves in the end. As for Sam and Suzy, it's sort of like the kid's version of 'Silver Linings Playbook'--amusing up to a point but slightly over baked. When all is said and done, 'Moonrise' is sometimes a little too cute for its own good. But look a little closer and you'll also see it's a tale of the power of redemption--which is no small thing.",1363392000,9,3607,5.0200668896321075

The adult actors were equally great and the story was just so endearing.

Moments of sheer delight in the settings, genuineness of dialog, and music.

The two young people who play Suzy and Sam are fabulous, morose, goofy, and sweet.  And I love the turn around of the 'scouts' (bullies) to support the 'lovers' later.

I haven't been this impressed with a movie that touches all aspects of what good movie should be in a very long time.

That being said, I don't know that this movie is for everyone. There are some parts of it that may be shocking or distasteful to more conservative-minded folks and its odd humor may not sit well with everyone. Unfortunately, there's nothing I can compare this movie to in order to give you an idea if you might like it...it's just that unique of a movie.",1361923200,,708,4.619047619047619

5097952,5,B007L6VR6M,"I was reading through some of the 1 star reviews and had to throw in my rebuttal. The only people who could give this movie one star are overprotective mothers and those who would probably enjoy something like 'Madea Goes to Jail'. Anybody who's immature enough to even remotely associate this movie with child pornography is a pervert and shouldn't be watching movies in the first place.

Wes Anderson movies aren't for people who can't comprehend the simple things in life. Try slowing down and paying attention to the world around you from time to time. I enjoy every detail in this movie (and all of Anderson's movies for that matter). Each time I watch it I see more things I didn't notice before.

The only thing not to like about this movie is that it's not long enough! If you can't handle small details or subtle humor, then go back to watching 'Fast and the Furious' or 'Madea' or something that your tiny brain can handle.",1361750400,,933,4.580838323353293

It was a great find.,1361491200,,325,4.620689655172414
5097964,4,B007L6VR6M,"I think Wes Anderson films are an acquired taste so this film is not for everyone, but I really like this film.  The cinematography is very similar to other Anderson films.  Many closeups, sets that are a cut away of an entire house, and somber but appealing color tones. The story is pretty outlandish yet works on many levels, with quirky characters and no one character or actor taking the limelight.  The kids, Sam and Suzy are very ordinary, but I liked that.  However, the first 'kiss' scene on the beach is smokin sexy!  Made me remember what is was like to be 16 again.

If you have scene Royal Tannebaums and hated it, you probably will not like this movie.  If you are up for something different than the crap Hollywood has been coming out with, give this film a try.",1361491200,,777,4.429577464788732

We watched for 30 minutes, only because the reviews were so good. We would have watched it for 10 minutes before turning it off had the reviews been honest.

This movie is very slow, the plot isn't coherent and headlining actors have very minor roles. I'd consider them cameos really.

5097976,5,B007L6VR6M,"I gave it five stars because I loved every character, loved the costumes and loved the set details. The two leads never raise their voices above a monotone, yet they have so much youthful emotion welling upside that their behaviour is essentially bezerk wrapped in reasonable. The are adorable together, yet you struggle to decide whether how well you would have accepted them as one of their 12-year-old peers.

Some of the adults are very reserved like these lead children, while others of the adults are essentially the opposite, letting emotions completely run amok while they try to corral the behaviour of the adolescent scouts.

The 1965 vibe is great. Being born in the 1970s, my feelings aren't exactly nostalgia, but I feel like I'm watching a dramatization of the old family photo albums I flipped through as a kid. The costumes are so much fun, ie: the foster father who has a phone to match his house which matches his pants. It seems like everything in this world is tinted with the green, brown and orange hues all those old photos have.

We enjoy a lot of movies because they are about huge disasters or massive criminal plots -- big stuff. I would argue that the transition into adolescence is about as big as it gets for most of us, and certainly something that I can identify with. I really liked this film and would recommend it to most people.

I think it suits certain tastes. My wife thought it was fine, but she knew that it was the sort of thing that I love -- a character story chock-full of quirky people and quotable dialogue.",1361318400,3,1554,4.59927797833935
5097977,4,B007L6VR6M,"My wife picked out this movie on amazon on demand (I wanted to Expendibles 2) and I figured I would watch a few minutes than read a book while she finished it.  I ended up watching the whole thing and to my dismay I enjoyed it.  Let me start off if you like Wes Anderson movies than you are getting more of the same however it would rank on the bottem of his list.  The movie itself is to lack a better word cute.  It moves at a steady pace, you never laugh out loud but you do smile throughout and at the end you appreciate it for what it is a simple nice movie to pass away a lazy evening at home.

The movie centers around two children aged 12 who choose to run away together on a small island.  For a moment I thought this was going to be an updated Blue Lagoon but that just for a few moments.  Both children have an interesting back story and their desire for one another is amusing.  The strength of the movie is the supporting actors eveyone from the scout master, the scouts, the girls parents (bill murray) and the police officer looking for them (bruce willis) contribute to this movie which is heavy on dialouge but lacks any real action scenes.

I was very surprised that I ended up enjoying this movie but feel strongly that it would make a good date night movie for just about anyone.",1361318400,2,1299,4.184738955823293

The characters' staid lives are suddenly scrambled by a couple of stoic yet star-crossed kids. Outstanding performances come from both the veteran favorites and new youthful actors. This is a fun watch, but I  left wanting a little more in story. I won't spoil it, by telling the ending, but the story buildup leads you to this inevitable conclusion especially as you watch the last of the action scenes unfold with sometimes cartoonish tableau displays.

Overall, this is a fun movie. I hope they do well with the awards ceremonies.",1361318400,2,701,4.882352941176471

5097981,2,B007L6VR6M,"Moonrise Kingdom is a movie where none of the characters begins to come to life, save for a understated performance by Bruce Willis (of all people). The film is set on a small wooded island off the U.S. east coast in the 1960s where a troubled 12-year-old Boy Scout runs away from camp and elopes with a deeply disturbed 12-year-old girl. Various other scouts and assorted adults give chase. Everyone speaks in a stilted way and the children fire off shots of dialogue that are supposed to be clever but instead are just confusing, so rather than watching the movie (which I'll say is beautifully shot) unfold you're scratching your head and saying ""What did that mean?"" The adults tend to show off too and come out with lines that make no sense. The fundamental problem is that Moonrise Kingdom can't decide whether it's a romance or a comedy or a satire and veers in and out of each form, making it very hard to follow. Bruce Willis is good, though, as a sad policeman who's rather had the life crushed out of him.",1361232000,9,1016,4.5271739130434785

You never quite know what is going to happen next. As one other reviewer said, it almost seems like it was made by kids. It's fun and takes you back to a time when everything seemed simple. My cynicism falls when I watch this movie.

At the same time, it shows just how powerful and vulnerable humans can be. It will make you cry. There are wonderful, heartfelt conversations between all the characters in _Moonrise Kingdom_.

It's also just plain beautiful. The background music and the scenery (nature shots) are just plain spectacular. It's all mixed in well with a great story. _Moonrise Kingdom_ uses music very well, and it creates the experience.

Summing it up, if you have lost all hope of finding love, _Moonrise Kingdom_ will make you believe again. Never have I rooted harder for a couple than I have rooted for Sam and Suzy.",1361145600,,995,4.706896551724138

The characters are quirky and (exceedingly) human and the cinematography is gorgeous and static, letting you enjoy the story and the acting without being distracted by camera tricks. The story and characters speak for themselves. As a period piece, the costuming and set decorating are also spot-on.

I had gotten a glowing recommendation from my brother, who likes things that are a bit more on the independent side of mainstream, so we knew that the movie might be a bit strange.

We were not disappointed.  It was strange, and beautiful, and extremely cute, if occasionally disturbing.  Equal parts dark and uplifting, the cast was superb, the camera work was deliberate, well thought out and occasionally brilliant.  The effects budget was obviously small, which resulted in an emphasis on storytelling that I found refreshing.  For better or worse, it seemed more stage than cinema.  My wife's reaction was ""That was great but I'm kinda glad I didn't see it in the theater.""

I found the story itself addressed a number of deeper issues, from social justice, to depression, to marital strife, responsibility, parenting and small town life.  It addressed these issues seriously, but often using the viewpoint of a child, though I would be aware that some of the themes may require a good deal of explanation to be understood or appropriate for younger children.

The movie is definitely worth watching as a primer on finding the extraordinary in the ordinary, both in terms of people and places.  Go and enjoy it!",1360627200,,1439,4.954166666666667

This time, however, the script itself lacks emotional nuances and resonance of this boy and girl that the visual details only partially compensate for.  It's well worth renting but not owning because you absorb it all the first viewing.",1360540800,,402,4.882352941176471
5098016,5,B007L6VR6M,"You just have to see it the kids were fantastic in this movie. It was a refreshing different movie, a must see",1360540800,,110,4.045454545454546
5098017,4,B007L6VR6M,Classic Wes Anderson film.  Style and substance reminds me so much of the Life Aquatic with Steve Zizou.  Romance between the two young children is so true for that age range.,1360540800,,175,4.612903225806452
5098018,5,B007L6VR6M,Loved this quirky movie and it's time dated subject.  It was wonderful! it will be part of our dvd library for a long time.,1360454400,,123,4.125
5098019,4,B007L6VR6M,"MOONRISE KINGDOM is a totally different sort of film, the sort I don't want to over-analyze. I can, however, say the following: Although a bit slow-moving, it's highly imaginative and has a quietly slapstick, satirical humor that's just all its own. Kara Hayward (as Suzy Bishop) and Jared Gilman (as ""Sam"") are very natural in their roles as two outcast 12-year-olds who find a bond and just want to be alone together, but alas, the world won't let them be. Excellent scenery on ""New Penzance,"" a fictitious New England island without roads that seems to symbolize childhood itself or something like that.

It's one of those films that makes a point of saying ""Childhood's real--adulthood's fake."" All the same, much of the adult cast, especially Bill Murray as Suzy's crackpot father and Frances McDormand as her tyranncial mother, plays its part very well. MOONRISE KINGDOM also has a great deal of embedded satire regarding bureaucracy in education, paramilitarism in the ""Khaki Scouts,"" dysfunction in the American family, and many other things.

Enjoyed it!",1360454400,,1063,5.138728323699422
5098020,4,B007L6VR6M,"This was a good cast and the camera work was artistically done.  The island is picturesque and feels just like how I imagine life could be like on a small New England island town.  There were some cringe-worthy intimate scenes, but nothing felt gratuitous.  It was an enjoyable, smart piece of story telling - something rare compared to the many mindless action movies out there.",1360454400,2,379,4.8
5098021,4,B007L6VR6M,"Be warned - this movie is in the vein of other Wes Anderson movies.  It's very quirky and not for everyone.  But if you can get past that, the story is very sweet and funny.",1360454400,,173,3.914285714285714

5098028,3,B007L6VR6M,"Watched this one twice...at home. His movies just don't seem to warrant having to be seen on a big screen because the stories are always intimate and charming but not really cinematic masterworks that rely on a grand visual scale to have impact. It was fun and slightly eccentric like all of his films, but I almost felt like this one was starting to become a little formulaic. It just didn't stick with me like Rushmore or Royal Tennenbaums. Still, I'll eagerly look forward to what comes next and definately make the effort to see it.",1360281600,,536,4.59375

I have to say I loved it. I loved the storyline. I loved the characters. I loved the cinematography. I loved the actors. Overall this was a great movie to me and after you are finished watching the movie you start to like it more and more when you think about it. So give it a try!",1360108800,,445,4.247058823529412

5098037,5,B007L6VR6M,"Normally I don't write reviews, but more people need to see this film. I could tell within the opening few shots that this would be one of the best films I have seen in decades. This film was obviously made with painstaking attention to detail that gives it a feeling of complete wholeness--there is nothing extraneous or out of place, everything fits and the music wonderfully compliments the action on screen without too pushily telling the viewer how to feel. The big names deliver the caliber of performance you would expect (you can't go wrong marrying Frances McDormand and Bill Murray), but you find yourself surprised by the quality of the child actors and their poignant performances. Moonrise Kingdom is intoxicating in its feeling of storybook-esque nostalgia without becoming cheesy or hackneyed as has unfortunately happened to Tim Burton's work. Perhaps there is something particularly moving about a love story between twelve year olds whose egos haven't yet become confused by the ordeal of adolescence and high school and whose relationship isn't complicated by sex, although the subject certainly is not skirted. Overall, it was wonderful and I could watch it again and again.",1359936000,,1194,5.15979381443299
5098038,5,B007L6VR6M,"Much of the characters' personal struggles are left ambiguous and I found that really refreshing, Moonrise Kingdom never loses focus from the immediate plot for the sake of tragic pasts.",1359936000,,186,5.233333333333333

5098056,5,B007L6VR6M,"People often complain that Wes Anderson films are too pretentious. While that may be true, Moonrise Kingdom doesn't suffer from it. The movie, about the naivety, adventurousness and rebelliousness of children, is something that many can relate to. It has a beating heart that sets it apart from his other films. As usual, his cast of characters are odd and quirky, but ultimately endearing. The child actors are perfectly cast and do a wonderful job.

I also really liked Life Aquatic, though I think it is considered by many to be his least interesting effort. Moonrise Kingdom was nice, and charming, and mostly true to his vision, but I found it to be a little too self-conscious and perhaps a tiny bit overwrought.

Also, Amazon's streaming service seemed a bit wonky on the day I watched it. Perhaps it was my Roku. Hard to say exactly. (No stars were deducted for this aspect)",1359331200,,511,4.494623655913978

5098077,3,B007L6VR6M,"I'm not a Wes Anderson fan, but I don't especially dislike him. The only other of his movies I've seen is The Royal Tenenbaums, and I didn't much like it but don't much remember it either. So I enjoyed this movie more than I expected to.

It's quirky and sort of dark, which I like, and it has a consistent tone of unreality all the way through, which I also like. I'd gotten the idea that the Wilson brothers (Owen, et al) are closely bound up with Anderson, so I was relieved not to see any of them here because I can't stand any of them.

But I didn't mind some actors whom I usually can't stand (Tilda Swinton and Bill Murray), I liked one I always like (Frances McDormand), and I was indifferent to the rest, to whom I'm generally indifferent (Bruce Willis, Harvey Keitel, Edward Norton, Jason Schwartzman, etc). The kids were okay but nothing exceptional.

I don't see what in this movie freaked out the people who were freaked out by it, unless it was the sex play between the kids; but heterosexual sex always disgusts me so this was no different. Overall, a movie I enjoyed more than I expected to but probably won't ever watch again.",1359244800,,1143,4.407582938388626

I turned this off after an hour and much deliberation of whether or not this movie was worth watching more of. This movie was a fantasy trip of someones idea of first love.  Please do not let your children watch it, its really not for kids, let alone adults.  I tend to believe that this movie represents an adult's fantasy about childhood first love than anything else.

However, he really puts together a great movie this time around, getting excellent performances out of all of his actors and actresses. Highly recommended. Also, I normally hate child actors with a passion but these two did really excellent jobs since, it being a Wes Anderson film, they weren't asked to be extremely melodramatic.",1359072000,,502,4.848837209302325

When I tried to watch it today by clicking on the link provided in the email with my purchase it came up fine and then wanted me to PAY to watch it!! I already paid once thank you! It asked for a promo code, but the email doesn't include a code....Nice....NOT!
I've been saving watching it for a snowy day. Well that snowy day is here and now I can't access it on my computer. I guess it means you have to watch it immediately or they take it away. Pretty deceiving.

5098089,5,B007L6VR6M,"Definitely a crowd-pleaser too.  My very picky, cynical parents who never like the same movies as I do absolutely loved it!  Thanks again, Wes Anderson :)",1359072000,,154,4.884615384615385
5098090,5,B007L6VR6M,"Wes Anderson has never disappointed me and this is no exception.  In fact this is the best movie he has made.  It is funny, sweet, disturbing, and creative.  Great soundtrack as always!",1358985600,,185,4.71875
5098091,4,B007L6VR6M,"I've watched most (if not all) of this director's films, and, while I loved them for the offbeat, quirky, and somewhat-arty feel, I still scratched my head at the end going, ""Huh?"" This movie is still a little weird, but it has so much heart compared to his others. Really sweet movie.",1358985600,,285,4.5
5098092,5,B007L6VR6M,"This movie was sweet and unexpected and fun. It has the classic Wes Anderson charm and while it started a little slow, by the end I was practically out of my seat, totally enthralled in the story!",1358985600,,196,4.324324324324325
5098093,2,B007L6VR6M,"I was hopeful when viewing this movie because of the great cast lineup. But one-third into the movie, I started watching the clock. Never a good sign. By the two-thirds mark, I didn't care if I watched one more minute because the story was meandering and nothing was relatable.  Very disappointed.",1358899200,,297,4.823529411764706
5098094,3,B007L6VR6M,"I love Wes Anderson films.  They are all vaguely the same and have similar characters- but that's ok.  In this case though, it didn't feel like the same characters in a different situation... it felt like the same characters in a pastiche of several Anderson films stuck together.  Entertaining, but far from great.",1358899200,,315,4.90566037735849
5098095,5,B007L6VR6M,"Moonrise Kingdom is a brilliant movie about two kids falling in love, running away, and the absurd reaction of an entire island when they disappear. While the acting comes off as flat, that seems to be a mechanism of the movie, rather than poor acting on anybody's part. Very funny, in a cerebral way.",1358899200,,301,4.592592592592593
5098096,5,B007L6VR6M,this was the best Wes Anderson movie I've seen since Rushmore. yay. i liked the benjamin britten soundtrack. And noah's flood.,1358812800,,126,5.0476190476190474
5098097,2,B007L6VR6M,I liked the movie but the quality of the stream really diminished the experience for me considering this is a nice looking film its a real shame.  I checked the internet connection on my end and was downloading around 10 Mbps at the time so that should have been more than suitable for HD so I am not sure what was wrong here.,1358812800,,326,4.174603174603175
5098098,4,B007L6VR6M,"A very quirky sort of film with a consistent eclectic style all its own. Edward Norton as the OCD Boy Scout Instructor is fun to watch as are the two young leads in the film who share a ""young love"" story quite unlike anything we've seen onscreen in the past. Visually the film is as unique as its direction and story-line. The film is peppered with nerds, bullies and other interesting youngsters and Bill Murray is particularly amusing in his role as Frances McDormand's wife and co-counsel, as they are both knowledgeable, yet ""not quite right"" lawyers. As I said, this film has plenty of style and a lot of warmth, too. It's exceedingly watchable and a good family movie for a rainy Saturday afternoon. Totally a Wes Anderson film from start to finish!",1358812800,,756,4.649253731343284
5098099,5,B007L6VR6M,"Ah, the joys of adolescence.  You are hounded by your parents, chastised by your peers and scorned by your first love.  You are misunderstood, underappreciated and overprotected and at the end of the day, your life is just now starting to `begin' and you have a whole lot of life left to live, so you better get used to it now!

I don't know why I'm drawn to movies about childhood, but I certainly am.  Maybe it's the fact that it is a part of my life I often reflect on, or maybe it is because I can see it starting to form in the eyes of my children, but the bottom line is that these films truly impress something upon me, truly speak to the core of me.  Like Jonze did in a more fantastical way, and Zietlin did in a more earthy way, Anderson proves that he understands the misunderstood in a more humorous and charming way.

Yes, Wes Anderson understands what it means to be a child.

I'm a fan of Wes.  I'm not a rabid fan.  I don't bow down at the altar of Wes Anderson.  I thought `Rushmore' was uneven and `The Life Aquatic' slightly vacant, but `Fantastic Mr. Fox' was fantastic (pun intended) and `The Royal Tenenbaums' is one of the best comedies of the past decade.  For me, `Moonrise Kingdom' is his finest film and, without question, a masterpiece!  A beautifully intricate screenplay (so much subtle depth), a brilliant ensemble (Willis!  Norton!  Swinton!), not to mention two leads that truly understood the balance needed to sell all aspects of their situation.  Gilman and Hayward were outstanding to say the least, full of such adolescent truth and wonderment mixed with the sparks of individuality that make themselves prevalent at that ripe age of change.  Mix in with that Anderson's keen use of visuals (the sets, the costumes) and the beautiful score and you have a pitch perfect film from start to finish.

What makes `Moonrise Kingdom' so insightful is the subtle way in which Anderson is able to bleed his themes into all aspects of his film.  When you consider the core story regarding Sam and his relationship with Suzy (the birth of adolescence through the pangs of first love) and then you see that same central theme trickle into the depiction of the adults around him, whether they be the lonely Captain Sharp (a magnificent Bruce Willis) or the repressed Laura Bishop (McDormand) or the childlike innocence of Scout Master Ward (a beautifully toned turn from Edward Norton), Anderson took the time to develop so much substance behind every conversation.  There is so much to glean from the development of story here that it demands repeat viewings.

The key being that this film is wonderful enough to deserve them!

And that is certainly key here as well.  Wes Anderson has a distinct style of filmmaking.  He is clever and witty and possesses a charm that makes his films rest warmly on the palate.  Using his sharp sense of direction, Anderson creates such a welcoming format for his tale.  He has perfected his approach and delivered a film that is tonally perfect, one that pulls us in and holds us close and urges us to keep watching with gentle prods that assure us, like a parent does a child, that we truly want to see how this story unfolds.",1358812800,,3188,4.6
5098100,2,B007L6VR6M,Thought the movie was pretty boring. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is looking to be entertained. I turned it off with 45 minutes left.,1358812800,,144,4.576923076923077
5098101,2,B007L6VR6M,"The plot was confusing and very slow to build.  If a movie doesn't hook me right away, you've lost me.  I guess the acting was okay, but again it was an odd plot with odd characters.",1358812800,,182,4.027777777777778
5098102,5,B007L6VR6M,"Great movie start to finish. If you've enjoyed any of Wes Anderson's previous films, then Moonrise Kingdom is a must see.",1358812800,,121,4.809523809523809
5098103,5,B007L6VR6M,Fantastic movie with a great star studded roster. The kids were wonderful and they are definetly the stars of the movie. Lighthearted and fun. Will definetly watch again.,1358812800,,170,5.107142857142857
5098104,1,B007L6VR6M,"The video quality was so poor I couldn't stand to watch it. Way out of focus. The film wasn't compelling enough for me to want to get  past the poor quality, so I can't really review the film in a fair way.",1358812800,3,206,3.9047619047619047
5098105,5,B007L6VR6M,"Beautiful, funny, touching, exquisitely well done.  Amazing cast- Bill Murray and Frances McDormand especially.  I always love Wes Anderson's movies, Royal Tenenbaums particularly.  This is another fine example of his work- wonderful characters, impeccable sets.  It is as if each shot is a piece of art.  It is incredible to me.  Writing this is making me in the mood to watch it again.",1358812800,,387,5.063492063492063
5098106,5,B007L6VR6M,"A child hood fantasy, a world of wonderful memories, a beautiful aesthetic and a very simple complicated story, believably told through the eyes of children, thus is a delightful little movie :)",1358726400,,194,5.09375
5098107,3,B007L6VR6M,"this is a dry humor movie. I liked it but would not watch again. Just kind of slow going but it has a lot of good actors in it which is why, imo, that it works.",1358726400,,160,3.4722222222222223
5098108,5,B007L6VR6M,"Loved this movie, it was a very charming look at young love, and I would certainly recommend this movie to all my friends",1358726400,,121,4.304347826086956
5098109,5,B007L6VR6M,"This was a sweet little movie with characters I could totally relate to. The dialogue was exceptionally witty...so witty that my husband didn't get a lot of it -- haha! I think it would be ok for most kids over say 9, except for 2 things -- a brief boys hand on girls bra, and giving a kid a slug of beer in his milk glass. After the milk was poured out, of course.",1358726400,,365,3.945945945945946
5098110,2,B007L6VR6M,"a clear case trying too hard and appealing to a very narow audience.  terrible story, performers  acted as if they knew the secret but forgot to tell the audience.  un waste your time.derage children having sex and parents out of touch with reality.  a tale of people who have lived on an island too long and force their children to be the victims.  sad statement on our regional east coast life.  dont",1358726400,,402,4.513888888888889
5098111,4,B007L6VR6M,"Who is Wes Anderson's Art Director?

I knew from the first frame I would love this film.  Composition, quirkiness, underlying genius, all of Anderson's trademarks embodied long before the first word of dialogue.  Gotta love this man, he is a unique voice, an impeccable filmmaker.

Honoring his first actors/devotees/stars, Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman join in the fun, adding offbeat panache in colors only they, unique craftsmen, could muster.  And nothing quells a brief rush of joy when Francis McDormand sneaks onto screen as a militant mother who shamelessly smokes indoors and wrangles her brood using a megaphone--there is no doubt she will turn in a layered, thoughtful study.  With Bruce Willis headlining, Tilda Swinton and Ed Norton round out the all-star ensemble supporting two child-star leads (Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward) and their story of pre-pubescent, town-rattling, romance.  Innocent, mostly, as adventurous, this is not to be confused with a children's movie.  Adult themes outweigh what's childlike, even as kids out-number adults 5 to 1 in this flick.  Think 48 Hours Missing Persons meets Teletubbies, and you're getting close to where Moonrise Kingdom's rating should be.

For the rest of us, especially the ""well over 18"" crew, Moonrise is rare cinema candy with great performances, welcomed simplicity and trademark Anderson uber-creative strokes.

Gerald Sullivan, by the way, is the Art Director here.  And his work here is Oscar-worthy.",1358726400,,1476,5.397379912663755

5098114,5,B007L6VR6M,"This was a stunning accomplishment. It was as if I was transported back in time to my childhood. Everything looked 'right'. The film, the props, the outfits - everything. Not only that, the acting was great and balanced, the story was engaging light hearted and innocent - with just enough of a dose of reality to make it not feel too surreal. Great accomplishment. I'll likley do something with this movie I seldom do - watch it again soon!",1358726400,,441,4.594936708860759

5098118,3,B007L6VR6M,"You should know by now what you're getting into when you check out a Wes Anderson movie. Oddball characters, all with the same artsy monotone adult voice (even the kids) that find themselves in silly situations. I rank this above Steve Zissou, but it's WAY below Royal Tenenbaums and Rushmore, as far as comedy goes. Don't expect too much from Bill Murray in this one. He's barely in the movie at all. The real star is Ed Norton as the scout master. It is a sweet movie about young romance and how you can find love even if you're a troubled weird-o.",1358640000,11,550,4.401960784313726

5098124,3,B007L6VR6M,Strange and sometimes it borders on weird  and then again there is an ultimate beauty in this piece of fiction. Well acted with a few of Hollywood's best and the boy in the lead role is going to go a long way if he doesn't lose his natural personality. I was close to giving it four stars and changed my mind. Pg 13 is the right rating for this film.,1358553600,,350,4.0
5098125,5,B007L6VR6M,"This movie made me feel so much.  It was a sweet and painful and improbable love story between developing pre-teens.  A time when everything is just so intense, especially true when you are ""different.""  I rooted for them and really enjoyed the other story lines and cast.

You wonder, who came up with this story? You find yourself getting really invested in the various (all interesting) characters. Every single person in the movie is portrayed perfectly by their respective actors.

In particular, I loved the art direction and photography, both of which sustain a 60's feel throughout the entire film. It was a delight to watch. My personal favorite was Tilda Swinton as Social Services. What a riot.

5098159,4,B007L6VR6M,"Is it any good?

If you have seen a Wes Anderson film, you will know what to expect. The wide angles, the centre framing, the Bill Murray's. They are all here. It's a love story about some runaway kids; sure, maybe not everyone's cup of tea, but you cannot help but be swept up by the nostalgia of 60's. Simpler times, where kids were either playing outside or listening to the radio. Anderson again pulls together an all star cast, including Murray of course, but also featuring the likes of Bruce Willis, and Edward Norton as the Scout Master desperately searching for his member before a violent storm engulfs the island. This cute and quirky film will defiantly appease Wes Anderson fans, but may also be appreciated but those who have yet to experience his genius.

Best bit?

Sam and Suzy set up camp on the Cove, kind of like lord of the flies, but with less murders and more romance.

5098162,4,B007L6VR6M,"At the surface level, ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is a simple story of puppy love.  But there is far, far more going on beneath the surface.  The two puppy lovers are both troubled youths, and it is only through the inattentions and inactions of all the adults around them that they are able to create, ultimately, a life-or-death crisis.  To what extent are the kids responsible for their perceived failings?  Moonrise Kingdom presents a compelling case that the kids are alright and it is the adults who are screwed up.

The stars of Moonrise Kingdom are the two twelve year-old lovers, portrayed by child actors Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward.  Both do a more-than-credible job, and will have you rooting for them to succeed on their attempted escape.  The main adult roles fall to Bruce Willis and Edward Norton, who turn in fine performances of somewhat stereotyped characters: the sleepy town police chief, and the by-the-book scoutmaster.  The roles of Bill Murray and Frances McDormand are not significant enough to showcase the talents of those two accomplished actors.

The movie takes place in director Wes Anderson's picture postcard-perfect alternate universe, a visually striking place in which everything (even including kids' play areas) is perfectly ordered and ready to be photographed.  Even Kara Hayward's 12 year-old runaway girl somehow maintains her neatly applied eye shadow during the course of a multi-day outdoor excursion.  Similarly, all of the characters aside from the two lovers are simplified stereotypes: the government bureaucrat, the bully, the loyal dog, even the narrator with perfect diction.  Yet Moonrise Kingdom not only works, but it delivers some deep messages in a touching, humorous way that will capture the hearts of most audience members.

Definitely recommended, for adults and families with older children.",1358035200,,1847,5.284246575342466

Top notch cast, script, and acting. Very artistic camera work with tremendous attention paid to every detail in every shot, even the stuff in the background. The film is highly yellow tinted for emotional effect. Probably not suited for viewing by pre-teens for promoting running away, dancing in public in underwear, and lots of smoking.
This film would have been much better without the constant smoking promotions as product placement through out the entire film. Perhaps a good idea to teach your kids how product placements in movies work so they can grow up to be aware of them.

5098174,2,B007L6VR6M,"Moonrise Kingdom got great reviews and was favorably compared with ""Fargo.""  Well, it's no ""Fargo"".  The scriptwriter seems to have borrowed the technique of stilted dialog and quirky characters from ""Fargo"" but someone forgot that the audience has to care about the characters.  The single biggest flaw  of this film is the casting of the male lead, Sam, played by Jared Gilman. Sadly, this kid has no charisma.  How he made it through the screen test is a complete mystery; they could have probably dragged some random kid out of any 5th grade class in America and gotten someone more appealing.  It's hard to ""care"" what happens to him. In fact, he's close to unlikeable.  And so, there is a hole at the heart of the movie, for which all the other excellent actors--who do a good job with their roles--just can't compensate.  The second biggest flaw is the casting of his supposedly pre-teen love interest, who seems to have some sort of never-explained mood disorder. Once again, a little back-story might have helped, as would the casting of someone who looks and acts closer to age 11/12 than 17.  I might also say that whoever wrote the dialog for these kids apparently hasn't talked to a preadolescent in a looooong time.  Here's a clue:  kids don't talk like Wikipedia and if they do, it turns everyone else off.  There is a sort of semi-sex scene with these two kids late in the movie which as a pediatrician and child psychiatrist made my skin crawl.  It was unnecessary and gratuitous and frankly creepy.  As I write this, I am still baffled by the rave reviews.  I have to stretch to give it even 2 stars.",1357862400,9,1618,4.628070175438596

Even though we know a bittersweet ending is coming, we can't help but root for Sam and Suzy as they escape from Sam's looming commitment to an orphanage and Suzy's dysfunctional family. They stave off the ambiguities and compromises of adulthood for a couple of days (if Suzy's parents are what adults are like, count me out), but we know they can't hold out forever. Somehow it all works out through the magic of Wes Anderson.

5098225,3,B007L6VR6M,"This movie was recommended as entertaining & quirky...I can take some quirkiness, but it was over the top for me.  I did enjoy the 60s look and feel, but I kept waiting to discover the whole point of the movie, which was never really revealed.",1357430400,,243,4.4
5098226,1,B007L6VR6M,"I watched this movie because it had a 94% rating from Rotten Tomatoes, which I had never seen for any other movie before.  Let me be very frank here:  this is the type of movie you would expect from some untalented french director who thinks he is an artistic genius.  This movie is not witty, nor funny, nor smart nor are the characters likeable, interesting or quirky.  Moonrise Kingdom is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, primarily because the viewer is acutely aware every minute of the movie that the people behind it were trying hard to create Oscar material.  Moonrise Kingdom is a waste of time and money, and not even Bill Murray can change that.",1357344000,9,664,4.5

5098229,4,B007L6VR6M,"This was a magical film for children and adults. It takes a little magical thinking to transplant yourself back to adolescence. This story all begins on an island, and no one else seems to live there but the people involved.

Suzy, played by Kara Howard lives with her family on this island. She seems to be the 'difficult' one in the family. On the same island is a Boy Scout camp, where Sam, played by Jared Gilman, an orphan, also seems to be the odd man out.  No one seems to like him, and strangely he and Suzy met last summer and have planned a rendezvous to run away together. This sets the wheels in motion for an adolescence hunt by some very strange people.  Bill Murray plays Suzy's father, and Frances McDormand plays her mother. Any film with McDormand amd Murray is sure to be a great one. We also have Bruce Willis playing the Island Policeman, Scoutman Ward payed by Ed Norton, and SocialServices played by Tilda Swinton. All these characters lead to an often time humorous film that deals with the turmoil of adolescence, the goodness of scouting, and the trials and tribulations of life.

This film is all played with straight faces, none for laughs, and the children are as superb as the adults. Wes Anderson has put together a film for us all, shining examples of life as we remember it.

5098230,3,B007L6VR6M,"Some critics have seemed to fallen in love with this quirky indy film.  I am not one of them.  Despite the presence of several top notch actors - Bruce Willis, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Frances McDormand, and others, its quirkiness is so over-the-top that it never rings true.  There is not a single character in the movie that acts in a realistic manner.  One could argue that since, after all, it is meant to be a fantasy film it need not be realistic, but any fantasy film still needs some grounding in some semblance of reality.

I found the relationship between the two lead children, which some have characterized as whimsically innocent, to be only creepy.  What is their mutual attraction based on, simply that they both are weirdo outcasts?  There appears to be a sexual element which seems hardly innocent in two preadolescents.  The adult characters are all strange ducks - but not in any cute cuddly way - they all seem capable of being ax murderers in their lives off-screen (except for the Bruce Willis character).

Finally, the characterization of the Boy Scouts in this film is so exaggerated, so stereotypically negative (whose leaders seem either Nazi control freaks or potential pedophiles) that it loses any sense of credibility.

Critics seem to love indy director Wes Anderson, I find his quirkiness only annoying - witness Rushmore, The Royal Tenenabaums, and my most un-favorite, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou.  Give the Bottle Rocket formula a rest Wes!",1357344000,,1485,4.923694779116466

5098249,5,B007L6VR6M,"Sure, it's capital Q Quirky.  And I hope they paid Bob Balaban extra for wearing that ridiculous gnome outfit.  But if you let yourself into the universe of this movie, it's worth it.  Maybe it doesn't quite touch the heights of all time masterpieces of whimsy like ""Local Hero"" and ""Big Deal on Madonna Street,"" but just the brilliant pairing of Benjamin Britten boy's choir music with the poetic goof of the imagery alone would make this film soar above average indie fare.  Alexander Desplat's score strikes the right notes, too, holding its own alongside Britten, Schubert, and Saint Saens.

But at the core are the characters, and I bought the intense and weird love story around which everything else winds.  Think of this as Blue Lagoon starring the cast of ""The Munsters,"" ""Fargo,""  and ""Edward Scissorhands,"" and you'll have the idea.  Add the overall aura of enchantment, and you have something as charming as the French music on the soundtrack.

One of a kind-- and a brilliant gem.",1357084800,,993,4.828402366863905
5098250,5,B007L6VR6M,This is definitely my favorite movie to come out in 2012 - and quite possibly my favorite Wes Anderson movie yet. MUST OWN.,1357084800,,123,4.391304347826087
5098251,3,B007L6VR6M,"MOONRISE KINGDOM is the latest, quirky movie by Wes Anderson.  Fans will love the story of childhood love set on a New England island called New Penzance in 1965. Sam and Suzy are 12-year olds who meet one summer. They write throughout the year and make a pact to sneak off together the next summer. Sam abandons his scout troop, and Suzy leaves her parents. The two kids meet up and share an innocent love while the entire island is looking for them.

I've enjoyed all the Wes Anderson movies I've watched (only missed one), but I'm not an ardent fan or defender. His casts are always top notch, and this film includes Bruce Willis, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton, Jason Schwartzman, and Edward Norton. Fans of Anderson will find plenty to like in this quirky coming of age story.

Kara Hayward and Jared Gilman steal the show as Sam and Suzy, two young kids who are in love. They share adventure, and a first kiss on a beach they call Moonrise Kingdom. I however, wanted to point out that I believe there is a little too much sexuality in the film concerning a 12 year old girl. I don't deny that it is realistic, or that it works in the movie. While on the beach, the two kids go swimming, stripping down to underwear. Suzy's bra shows tons of cleavage, and one shot basically shoots straight down her bra. Also, she asks the little boy to put his hand on her chest. I felt uncomfortable watching scenes on film that are usually depicted by actors at least 18 years of age.

I went on Amazon affiliated IMDB to see other viewer's thoughts on this, and anyone who was critical of the sexuality in this movie was called every name in the book. I've never seen so much hate in my life. Fans of Anderson have every right to defend this movie. But as someone who considered watching this movie with my 11 and 9 year old kids, I'm sure glad I didn't. I'm writing this review to give a heads up to parents who may feel the same way I do. People may bash this review too, or think I'm a prude or out of touch. Trust me, I'm not. I enjoy sex and romance in a movie just as much as the next guy, I just don't want to see 12 year olds doing it.",1357084800,2,2151,4.264705882352941

Example- Frances McDormand just needed more to work with. Edward Norton was outstanding as the tense and challenged scout leader. I have never been overly impressed by Norton, but he nailed it with this movie role.

The storyline of the movie is amusing, fast moving, sweet, nostalgic, and filled with great sense of the period. It is not hollywood style with the typical unrealistic stretch of sensibility. It tells a story and it tells it well.

The lead characters are actually a pair of 12 year-olds who have respectively run away from the Khaki Scouts (think New England boy scouts) and her parents (wonderfully portrayed by Murray & McDormand).

The story takes place on a 12 mile long island (whose location is never quite identified, but is clearly in New England) that provides a nostalgic arcadian setting. There are cliffs, rivers, grass paths, forests, lagoons, Indian trails and no paved roads.

The dialogue isn't as snappy as ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" (but then, few movies are), but it's entertaining and at times, funny.",1356998400,,715,5.31858407079646

Turns out these stars are more of background characters. I hoped it would be funnier and less, I guess, poignant. As other reviewers said, this is a stylish movie. I loved the details. It was kind of funny because my husband is the boy scout type and I'm the one who would bring a suitcase of books (actually I'd just bring a Kindle but this it's set in 1965 so I get it). It was very cute. However, the part on the beach got a little too Blue Lagoon for me. My husband thought that part was why the movie wasn't mainstream popular. For some reason I was really annoyed with the part where Edward Norton jumps across the water to save the Khaki Scouts leader or whoever it was.

Then I found that, like Comcast, Amazon has apparently switched to a version of Adobe's player that's incompatible with the browser version I have to use with my considerably-less-than-new Mac. I couldn't download the version of the player Amazon required, so I thought I couldn't watch the movie on Amazon, and though I looked and looked, I could find nothing that would allow me to cancel the rental. So I paid Amazon for a rental, but watched the movie elsewhere. This was disappointing, because I love Amazon and was happy to discover Instant Video several months ago.

I'm updating this to say that since I initially wrote my review, I found that I could download an older version of the player Amazon's using and still watch movies, here. It would have been nice if Amazon had let me know I could use an older version of the player, but I'm still happy.

Edward Norton carries the movie as a no-nonsense Scout Master. Bill Murray's expected appearance relegated to sparse appearances, with little opportunity for humor.

The child actors aren't perfect, but the incongruity between Anderson's peculiar dialogue makes for funny and heartwarming scenes. Bruce Willis might seem completely out of his element as a small town cop with no Germans to blow up, but he still manages to carry his role well.

The story line, the actors, the setting and Wes Anderson's vision is magical, other wordly and provides a view into a more simpler time where technology didn't dominate and control the world. Even though there are many ""A- List"" actors featured in this movie, the true focus of the film is on the two young lovers Sam Shucusky and Suzy Bishop. This movie offers an escape from this complicated and ever-changing world to the simple Island of Panzance- an imaginary island that is so quaint and beautiful.

I guarantee this film is worth watching not only once, but many times. Please try and have an open mind. Love the characters, embrace the oddities and become a part of the creative genius that Wes Anderson offers in his amazing ""Moonrise Kindgom.""",1356480000,,1050,4.579787234042553

I kept waiting for it to pick up and it finally did... About 45 minutes in when I slipped into a coma-like dream on my couch. That dream was a pretty good one. Fueled by my desperate need to escape the abysmal monotony of pointless masturbatory trash that had preceded it. This may be one or the worst movies I've ever seen. Don't let your pretentious friends make you believe you didn't ""get it."" There is nothing to get. This film is as deep as a Katy Perry song without the catchy hook. Whomever is responsible for giving Wes Anderson an unrestricted creative license needs to have their granting powers revoked. Looking at you, Weinsteins. Rushmore was good. Royal Tenenbaums was solid. Everything since has been absolute garbage. Anderson is the M. Night of indie films. Sooner or later I'll realize that there will never be another Sixth Sense.

5098395,5,B007L6VR6M,"MOONRISE KINGDOM addresses a problem that is prevalent at present in that we seem to be less educated about relationships, despite endless eBooks and blogs and regular books, and lectures/seminars from teams of goodwill popular gurus that can be hired for a price. Wes Anderson takes a different view by placing relationships under a microscope, using children to act out the fragilities and joys and consequence of allowing someone else into our heartspace. The result is a charming story about first love and coming of age that is respected by not only the writer/director Anderson, and the musical director Alexandre Desplat, but by a cast of both seasoned veteran actors as well as refreshing newcomers. It just works.

Set on an island off the coast of New England in the 1960s, as a young boy Sam (Jared Gilman) and girl Suzy (Kara Hayward) fall in love they are moved to run away together into the wilderness. Their moments together reveal a growing love and as they carefully step into the territory of first love relationships they gradually become physical:  conversations occur - `Sam: It's possible I may wet the bed by the way. Later, I mean. Suzy: Okay. Sam: I wish I didn't have to mention it but just in case. I don't want to make you be offended. Suzy: Of course, I won't.' and when hugging each other and having their first kiss the very simple words are so memorably sensitive `Suzy: It feels hard. Sam: Do you mind? Suzy: I like it.'  A storm brews and the `adults' begin a frantic search for the youngsters - Suzy's parents (Frances McDormand and Bill Murray) who state ``Our daughter's been abducted by one of these beige lunatics!', the scout master (Edward Norton), the Social Services person (Tilda Swinton) and the local sheriff Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis).  And it is this hunt that the meanings of the film fall into place.

When the youngsters are found, the conversations rings like `Sam: I admit we knew we'd get in trouble. That part's true. We knew people would be worried, and we still ran away, anyway. But something also happened, which we didn't do on purpose. When we first met each other, something happened to us. Captain Sharp: That's very eloquent. I can't argue against anything you're saying. But then again, I don't have to, 'cause you're 12 years old. Look, let's face it, you're probably a much more intelligent person than I am. In fact, I guarantee it. But even smart kids stick they're finger in electrical sockets sometimes. It takes time to figure things out. It's been proven by history. All mankind makes mistakes. It's our job to try to protect you from making the dangerous ones, if we can.' There is so much that can be said about this dear film, but nothing equals experiencing it.

The portrayal of Social Services was coldly accurate, as I can attest from first hand knowledge of 'her'. The story was like having a wonderfully magical dream of childhood where kids do the right thing for each other and adults are mostly not shady, exploitative creeps. The delightful music reached into my body, got a grip on my spirit and pulled me along with the story like rushing down a river. The crescendos of music and plot were paired so perfectly that the movie felt almost interactive.

The acting in this movie was spot-on. Especially the child actors, those two were brilliant.

This is my new all-time second-favourite movie. Bruce Willis happens to be in the best movie ever created as well, so he must occasionally have fabulous taste in scripts.

5098431,5,B007L6VR6M,"Yes it's mannered, precious, East Coastaphilic stuff, but I enjoy the acting and meticulous precision of Wes Anderson's films, including this one.  I'm rarely if ever emotionally affected but I love the recreation of the world through the eyes of someone with a unique vision.",1355788800,,276,5.133333333333334

5098433,1,B007L6VR6M,"OK, am I the only person on the planet who hated Moonrise Kingdom?  At first, I was thinking , ""Perhaps I am just dead inside"", but my roommate wasn't crazy about it either.  She didn't hate it.  ""I didn't have the violent reaction you did.""  But, when pressed, she said she would not recommend it to a single person on the planet, nor would she ever watch it again, and she also felt that, at 94 minutes, ""it was really long"".  When I saw the trailer, I could not have been less interested.  I loved Rushmore, and especially loved The Royal Tenenbaums, but I  hated The Darjeeling Limited, and hated The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (something I found particularly crushing since I loved some of Wes Anderson and Noah Baumbach's previous efforts).  So, given the trailer, and TLAWSZ and TDL, I was not excited about Moonrise Kingdom.  However, it seemed like everyone said how great it was, and it got terrific reviews, so I finally rented it, thinking maybe it was just a crap trailer.  Nope.  The film is exactly like the trailer, but an interminable 94 minutes long.  The first 45 minutes, I hadn't gotten to the point where I was hating it, but I was not at all engaged.  Then, at around the 45 minute mark, there was about 1 second of a moment that resembled something moving.  I thought, ""Thank Christ!  Perhaps now we'll find the heart that's been missing thus far.""  NOPE.  As the film wore on, I started mentally counting down the remaining minutes, gritting my teeth, and periodically heaving sighs.  Moonrise Kingdom plays up Wes Anderson's worst impulses, with nothing to back them up.

Afterward, in full rant mode, I told my roommate that I was not exaggerating in the slightest when I said I'd found Hallmark commercials more moving.  Finally, I exclaimed, ""I hate Wes Anderson!  We're in a fight!""

Moonrise Kingdom has a 98% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.  ?!?!?!  Miami Herald says, ""Most of Wes Anderson's previous pictures came from the head; Moonrise Kingdom is one from the heart.""

wrong, Wrong, WRONG!!!

Ugh.  I WANT MY HOUR AND A HALF BACK!

1 out of 5 stars because even the score and soundtrack annoyed me (unlike Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums).",1355702400,16,2176,4.670184696569921

5098435,5,B007L6VR6M,"I have been a fan of director Wes Anderson for many years. It's not the promise of a blockbuster and fat paychecks that lure big names like Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, and Bill Murray to star in his movies - it's his ability to so brilliantly portray the absurdity and wonderment of life, and more specifically in this film - childhood. Moonrise Kingdom is a work of art and quite simply beautiful to behold. It sucks you right in and you forget the world outside your screen.

This movie starts out sort of strange. However after watching it for a while it gets sort of strange. Everything gets wrapped up in the end as it is sort of strange.

Two twelve-year-olds fall in love and run away together. They are pursued by all who care, from relatives, kaki scouts, police, welfare, and a storm.

Lots of exadurated personalities. However it is just as I remember it as a youth. So maybe it is not so exadurated. There is a welfare lady could be a character right out of a Roald Dahl story.",1355529600,,588,4.416666666666667

I was very disappointed in Moonrise Kingdom. Still trying to figure out what it was about: first love? pre-teen angst? precociousness? how parents/adults scar their and other kids? the soul crushing evils of living under the boot licking heel of the pseudo- boy scout state (to paraphrase Big Wednesday)?

It was the weakest of stories IMO, with more than pedestrian dialogue. Now, perhaps non-fans of Anderson's works would make the same complaints about his other movies, some of which, like Rushmore, I think are great movies. But Moonrise Kingdom to me comes across as a half-assed effort at story-teling and film making.

The two main kids' characters are almost robot-like, speaking in short monotone sentences. I understand that was part of the characters -- not bad acting -- but it got old pretty fast.

5098498,5,B007L6VR6M,"The Royal Tenenbaums was very good; Moonrise Kingdom is beautifully great.

Wes Anderson took a story that romanticizes childhood yet injects some hard truths of real life -- parents that don't love each other, a child kicked out of his foster home, a sad middle-aged policeman, a young difficult girl, self-important scout leaders -- and does it all in an uplifting and very artistic way.

It is hard to imagine just getting the basic plot and dialog right to pull off such a feat without coming across as syrupy, a downer, leave-it-to-Beaverish, overplayed, underplayed, etc.  Yet he not only did that, he added such wonderful cinematic (and very Wes Anderson) visuals along with the story, layered with all sorts of subtle recurring themes and inspired musical choices.

I'm a pretty stoic guy, but it's hard for me not to slightly tear-up in the end when the young man slips out the window with ""Cuckoo"" being sang by the boys' choir -- both tying up a recurring theme of the movie while so perfectly ending the work of art that is this film.

I so truly admire Wes for creating something so original, so beautiful, so sweet yet so hard, so multi-layered, so artistic, just so plain enjoyable to watch again and again.

When I saw the ad for this on the slides that they show before movies start,  I was not interested.  The synopsis on the slide was: "" A 12 year old boy and girl run away and have the people of a small island town looking for them as a storm approaches""  The slide also showed a picture of some old 1960's stuff like a record player on a beach.

5098541,1,B007L6VR6M,"This sick movie depicts 12 year old children engaging in sexual interaction.  How far the interaction goes I cannot say because I stopped watching it as soon as the 12 year old girl french kissed the 12 year old boy (they were both in their underwear) then commented on him becoming sexually aroused at which point he proceeds to start feeling up her breasts.  That is the point at which I stopped watching it so I don't know if it proceeded to depict them taking off their underwear and having intercourse or not, but it would not be surprising given that the director and producers of this movie are clearly very disturbed and perverted individuals who enjoy watching children interact sexually.  I intend to contact the U.S. Attorney's office to ask that they investigate the makers of this film to determine if they violated any laws.  Having two child actors essentially sexually molest each other should be illegal but I am guessing that Hollywood may have an exemption under the guise of creating ""art"" so that they can legally do it.

This move is repulsive and anyone who is not a sexual deviant will not be able to enjoy it.  The preview made it seem like a quirky comedy about dysfunctional families and the presence of very talented and well known actors gives the impression that it will be a very enjoyable movie.  Nothing about the movie was enjoyable.  The characters are not engaging, watching it was uncomfortable even before it devolved into child sexual interaction, and the thematic content is also disturbing on other levels with child-on-child violence and brutality as well.  In short, there is nothing whatsoever about this movie to recommend, and the fact that the making of the movie caused children to molest each other should motivate any normal person to avoid it.  I would NEVER have rented this movie if I had known that it was so perverse and I call on Amazon and every other distribution vehicle to place a warning on this movie so that children are not exposed to its perverse content.  This movie is proof positive that the rating system has become utterly worthless because if this movie does not contain content that no child should be exposed to (meaning at least an R rating), then I don't know what would.

Avoid this film and protect your children from being exposed to it at a friend or neighbor's house by letting other parents know how perverse and disturbing it is.",1354492800,9,2411,4.727923627684964

5098560,4,B007L6VR6M,"Wes Anderson's best films seem to be about young people, rather than the neurotic adults for which he became famous, and ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is his most youthful effort yet. It takes place during the summer of1965, on a sparsely populated island somewhere in New England. Twelve-year-old Sam Shakusky (Jared Gilman) has resigned his commission and gone AWOL with a miniature canoe and some supplies from a Khaki Scout camp under the command of Scout Master Ward (Edward Norton). The local authority, police Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis), goes looking for Sam only to discover that Suzy Bishop (Kara Hayward) is also missing from her parents' home. The young couple have apparently run off together, just as a hurricane works its way up the coast.

Sam and Suzy have a hard time getting along with people, but they see themselves in each other and hit it off right away. In spite of their frustrations, they're full of youthful optimism and a yearning for adventure. And they go out and have that adventure, leaving the adults to worry and search frantically for them. These two young actors are very appealing, and their antics, however eyebrow-raising are sympathetic and funny. The adults are also sympathetic, if a bit disengaged from life until this incident galvanizes them. -With the exception of a woman representing social services (Tilda Swinton), who wants to have Sam committed. She seems to represent the menace of the mainland, where people do things differently than on the friendly, laid back island.

I love the period touches -Suzy's minidresses and blue eye shadow, record player, and less neurotic, simpler, dispositions in general. But ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is not a period film. Anderson uses 1960s motifs when it suits him and anachronisms just as easily. Sam and Suzy are more romantically sophisticated than sheltered middle class kids were before the internet. Suzy's parents are both lawyers, which leaves me to wonder who takes care of her three little brothers if her mother works long hours. There were not many female lawyers in the 1960s, much less with young children. The couple is also old to have children that age by the standards of their generation. It's Wes Anderson's whimsical universe, not 1960s America.",1354233600,,2241,5.070460704607046

While a movie that is loaded with stars doesn't always guarantee an excellent movie, this movie delivers!  Bill Murray, Bruce Willis, Ed Norton, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton, Harvey Keitel and all the various young newcomers featured, all deliver amazing performances.

5098564,1,B007L6VR6M,"I rented this film because it featured several of my favorite actors - Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand.

It turned out to be a colossal waste of talent. The basic plot - two pre-teen kids run away when they fall into mindless infatuation - could have been interesting, but the screenplay fell far short of the basic premise and the two lead child actors were simply awful.  Could-not-act.  Truly painful to watch.

As for Anderson's directing, he doesn't seem to know whether he wants to be John Waters or a kiddie-porn anime director.  How this film ever garnered enthusiastic reviews simply befuddles me.",1354147200,15,634,4.943396226415095

The film is shot in what I can only refer to as a ""choppy style."" The characters are all strange and difficult to relate to. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of one, was because it was partially filmed in Rhode Island. That was it's only appeal.",1354060800,,389,4.131578947368421

I personally was not a fan of director Wes Anderson's well known film The Royal Tanenbaums, but this movie far surpasses Tanenbaums in almost every way. The acting is excellent all around, especially Edward Norton, Bruce Willis and the 2 kids who play the lead roles.

It is all promise: I like the premises of the show, and continue hoping it will be a good ''installment''. It is not, but you will watch it because the style builds a certain loyalty.

It's like saying, give some stars, because I still want Wes Anderson to make movies like that, only better.",1353974400,2,454,4.481927710843373

5098594,4,B007L6VR6M,"I thought it was an excellent movie. Didn't quite know what to expect, as reviews were not exactly descriptive. A movie that shows characters who don't fit the mold, how people need to really, REALLY learn that people are unique, and develop behaviors that embrace the differences in all. Good for families to teach their kids to view differences in friends and others as OK, as a learning experience, and something to broaden their perspective. Some parents may not like the friendship that develops between the two main characters, especially if they have children in that pre-teen age range, but also to see that what adults may view as wrong, is to give too much ""shame"" to something that children don't quite have the knowledge of.",1353888000,,736,4.849206349206349

Everything is so precious, the kids are precocious, and a whole cast of extremely talented adult actors are underutilized.  If you are expecting Rushmore caliber Bill Murray, look elsewhere.  More broadly, I think my issue was a lack of a engaging story.  Off to catch the bus...in slow motion...set to a 60's era punk song.",1353888000,,498,4.666666666666667

Wes Anderson's magical thinking is unapologetically on display here, but the most remarkable thing about this movie is how deeply it understands the experience of being 12, and combines both a child's and an adult's understanding.

The fact that it shows up with a zillion formats is interesting but mainly useful for people who want to play it at home, in the car, on the iPad, and on the computer all at once (meaning, I suppose, lots of kids) and that's not my situation.

They hold the screen with just as much emotion and quirkiness as the icons they share it with (Frances McDormand, Bill Murray, Bruce Willis, Ed Norton, just to name a few...). I'm sorta addicted to Anderson's stylistic flourishes that reside somewhere between heartfelt memory and satire of youth.

5098663,5,B007L6VR6M,"The sign of a true auteur is that their style becomes their artistic strength. I'm a fan of Wes Anderson's style, certainly--he had me at ""Rushmore"", a movie that touched me by reminding me just how joyous it was to have the boundless but immature ambition of my youth. But as much as I love his quirks, they've never before congealed into the cohesive artistic vision that ""Moonrise Kingdom"" presents. In the manner that Woody Allen made many great urbane comedies before his cinematic skills (and collaborators) finally caught up with his ambitions, Anderson has made quirky, fun movies that have indulged and defined his peculiar aesthetic. But ""Moonlight Kingdom"" puts him in rare air indeed, where his creation is not merely quirky by nature--but damned if it isn't quirkiness distilled to its very essence--no longer the color, but the actual substance of his art.

Masters like Fellini, Altman, Hitchcock, and Scorcese produce their greatest films not by inhibiting their visions, but indulging them--the more Fellini is being Fellini, the more exciting his creation. I think making his first animated film, ""The Fantastic Mr. Fox"", liberated Wes Anderson's artistic muse--and now that it's been unleashed on the medium of live action, his weirdness becomes even more weird, and all the more wonderful. This film is more Wes Andersonesque than any of his previous films, relentlessly so. But the plot, the cast, the music, the sets, and the scenery are all in tune this time--in the same manner that the Gershwin music, luscious black-and-white cinematography, and iconic New York landscape contributed so mightily to Woody Allen's masterpiece.

It seems that the more Wes Anderson is himself, the greater his movies become. I dearly hope he can continue to make movies of this artistic standard--because I'm very excited by both his vision, and his fidelity to it.",1353456000,,1872,5.134426229508197

It's a bit like Romeo and Juliette and also involves family and their  young  fellow contemporaries. There's nothing like your first love, especially when you're a teen, you just never forget it. Of course the fun also comes from seeing how the grownups handle it. Ace actors like Bruce Willis, Frances McDormand, Bill Murray and Edward Norton give wonderfully touching performances as the befuddled adults.

films with the exception ""Mr. Fox"". I've got similar impressions after watching each of his films, light, quirky(including the names of the films), colorful with not much of a story and did not leave much impressions afterwards.
This film is no exception.  It has great production design, engaging actors, some from top drawers, colorful and quirky
but it is so light that did not make a good movie watching experience, for me.  It was like reading a comic book for children.  Love him, or dislike him, Wes Anderson.",1353456000,,679,5.044642857142857
5098670,4,B007L6VR6M,"This quirky, sometimes goofy young romance tale focuses upon a small island community in the 1960s which is so idyllic that it probably never existed. Minor annoyances turn into big crisis which gets the whole community involved at times and several of the characters have deadpan deliveries which reminds you this is a film by Wes Anderson. In fact, the case that the actors are not pushing for laughs adds to the quality of this picture.

Tale focuses upon an insular community which boils its problems over as an impending disaster flood hits the community. Our big ""crisis"" however is between two young lovers  (12 year old Sam and Suzy, who seems to be close to him in age) who fall in love, become pen-pals, agree to run away together and name their secret cove ""The Moonrise Kingdom"" (influenced by the fantasy books read by the girl). Did I mention both of these kids are socially maladjusted and might have some issues upon reaching adulthood? Look for how Suzy uses those scissors, people. Ouch.

Anyway . . .

The child actors (played by Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward) are up to the task of matching the impressive ensemble cast (one could argue they are a supporting cast): a subdued Bruce Willis, Bill Murray as his usual melancholy self, Frances McDormand, Ed Norton as a Dudley Do Right Cub Scout leader, Jason Schwartzman in a conniving role, Harvey Keitel in a small supporting role and Tilda Swinton (is she wearing a red wig?) as the ominous ""Social Services"". The fellow cub scouts to the Sam character had some characters of their own, too.

Gotham Awards has currently nominated this feature for ""Best Picture"" and ""Best Ensemble Performance"". The budget was $16M for this feature and so far it made a bit over $65M at the Box Office.

5098691,3,B007L6VR6M,"If you are a fan of Wes Anderson (as I am), you pretty much know what to expect from his films by now.  Beautifully staged and obsessively detailed sets and cinematography, great music, quirky storylines about underdogs who don't quite fit into society... and characters whose main defining trait is usually a deep and pervasive melancholy.

In all these respects, Moonrise Kingdom is a ""typical"" Wes Anderson film.  However I don't think it quite lives up to his classics like Rushmore or The Royal Tenebaums.  The performances are excellent.  Many of Anderson's usual cast of players return, including Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman.  Edward Norton is hilarious as the scout troop leader who takes his responsibilities a bit too seriously.

But this film really belongs to its 2 young stars, Jared Gilman as Sam and Kara Hayward as Suzy.  Both of them are excellent in their roles, although they are somewhat boxed in by Anderson's usual tendency of having his characters display very little emotion, or much enthusiasm for anything.  In a story about young first love, it would be nice if the 2 young people at least seemed a LITTLE bit excited about finding romance and a kindred spirit.  The flat affect does make the kids seem wise beyond their years, and it hints at the sadness that both have experienced - but I also think it detracts somewhat from the excitement and rush of that first adolescent romance.

Like all Wes Anderson films, this one is enjoyable and fun to watch.  The supporting cast is excellent especially Norton, and also Bruce Willis playing against type as a quiet and lonely bachelor who ends up caring about Sam.  While not up there with Anderson's classics, it is still enjoyable and worth watching.",1353283200,,1733,4.873720136518771

I will say, that while the director does a fantastic job bringing the pieces together, the actors do an equally fantastic job.  The two lead kids perfectly convey being both wise, yet terribly nave.  The big name actors are almost invisible.  By invisible, I mean you don't see Bruce Willis and say, hey, that's Bruce Willis.  You see the character instead.  I was pleasantly surprised.

Very much like prime Robert Altman, his films seems to wallow in  oddball collections of wacky characters with sometimes overly familiar actors doing dazzlingly unconventional work bringing them to life.  This is story of a pre-adolescent nerd doing a wildly romantic thing, kidnapping a young girl and running off to escape a hostile world. It is totally absurd, and is played, very much from the viewpoint of his character's warped pubescent  viewpoint.  His actions cause a major upheaval in the 1960s scout camp environment. Everyone is in dead earnest to get things back to normalcy. Edward Norton is his immediate scoutmaster, Bruce Willis is a cop trying to communicate with him, and Bill Murray and Frances McDormand are his parents. And Harvey Keitel, in an unbilled cameo, is the grand poo-bah of scout camps. Each of them are completely delightful in their roles, unlike any of their previous appearances in other films.

but if you say that adults cannot understand kids, this is outrageous at best.

my name is from Lyra and Will, if u read his dark materials you will know, I am a child supremist. Everything in the movies that describes naiveness of children are true, except for the fact that they assume that childrens are the weak minority.

Childrens are not weak minorities, as much as I am not banned to write what I think after I watched one of the best movie I have watched on boy and girl affection and its social and spiritual context.

Adults should not lose their children's heart either. I am 20, so what?

After the movie at Marquee, I climbed the wall on the side to the patio where I walked my bike in, I assume that the people waiting in line to get out from the main exits must think I am childish, hopefully in a good way or they sat here 2 hours watchin this movie for nothing.

When I enter the Marquee, there was only one girl from WUD film outside in charge, she was goingn to stamp me but then she didn't eventually, she just smiled and held the door for me. I was waiting for her to say bikes aren't allowed, but guess what, she did not even stare at my bike, all she did was implying me that she appreciate that I come for a good movie. And isn't it good? I barely read any review, I only read about Wes Anderson and stuff.

We all have a rebel in us. Rebellious makes us creative, free, and organically naturally beautiful.

I hope with all my soul that you have your own haven of heart. If you don't, you never will go for one in real life, you just won't ever have the chance to, and even if you are given the chance, you won't enjoy it cus it means nothing to you. (inspired by Bridge to Terabithia and many more)

The answer is in the attemp, the value is in the effort, the happiness is in the journy, the reward is in the process. (again, inspired by Before Sunrise, and many other essays I read about life, and again, I do not care if you quote it without my discretion, because I do not consider high of myself, nor do i think those artists consider high of themselves, as much as they deserved to be considered highly, because in life, giving instead of having is the source of happiness)

Me, Lyrill, hereby encourage all of you to start here, start ourselves, start right now, to rebel. Do something with heart, do something with a child in you, do something creative. Do something, that makes you happy, if it could be leaving some witty comments that makes me grin and touch my head.",1353024000,,2680,4.237254901960784

The rest of the movie involves the parents and other interested parties trying to find them.  The actors who play the young boy and girl, are relative unknowns, but they give great performances for first timers.  Also, strong performances by Edward Norton, Frances McDormand, Bill Murray(always great), and Bruce Willis make this a must see for Wes Anderson fans.",1353024000,,677,5.008928571428571

5098711,5,B007L6VR6M,"""Moonrise Kingdom"" opened to mixed reviews, but yours truly finds it to be a thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining look at life and love as seen through the eyes of two ""troubled"" preteens. Sam and Susie, the youngsters at the heart of this film, are a bit like Bonnie and Clyde. They're both a bit antisocial and they both unleash a storm of trouble--often without intending to. Their form of rebellion starts out innocently enough when they decide to run away together. They are, in effect, eloping. Sam, an orphan, is trying to break away from all the foster families that just don't understand him. And Susie, who lives with her mother, father and three brothers, is trying to enter some kind of fantasy world like the ones in the books she reads. She, too, is often misunderstood, but in Susie's case it's largely her own fault for embracing and expressing ideas that are [deliberately] alienating to those of her parents and siblings. Sam, on the other hand, seems genuinely to dance to the beat of his own drummer. If Susie is something of a poseur, Sam is unabashedly eccentric! Well, after hooking up and hiking out (they live on an island and, Sam, a Khaki Scout, wants to retrace the steps of a Native American tribe's so-called ""Harvest Trail""), they are pursued by everyone and everything they're trying to leave behind--a troop of scouts, the local police, Susie's parents, a social worker and their own prelapsarian states of mind. It isn't long before they realize that, while there's no Garden of Eden for them anywhere on the island, one's home isn't entirely in one's head, either. There's a trade-off that has to be made between living one's dreams and sharing a life with all the other misfits and crazies who co-inhabit the entirely too physical reality over which none of us has any more control than we do our own thoughts and feelings!",1353024000,,1860,4.761609907120743

5098722,5,B007L6VR6M,"Wes Anderson certainly uses the cinematographic medium to its full advantage in this wonderfully creative film about adolescent love. Even though the story is your basic 'boy meets girl', Anderson's attention to detail and nuance balanced with deadpan humor and sight gags make this movie a delight to watch. Unpredictable at times, formulaic at others, it is a visual and auditory treat. The underpinning of the entire film is Benjamin Britten's ""The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra"" (a brilliant choice!) Even though the story takes place in 1965, don't expect any traditional 'Top 40 Hits' of that era -  Anderson is much too eclectic for that. This isn't necessarily a profound cinematic experience - but it is an entertaining, eccentric, funny, touching, and a visually and musically arresting one. (Rated PG-13 for 'sexuality and smoking'??? Come on, they were only kissing, and the girl was in her undergarments. But the PG-13 rating shows just how ridiculously prudish America and the MPAA have become.)",1352937600,,1017,5.201219512195122

He really hasn't had a misstep just different tones and ideas that some like more than the others. It's pretty hard to rank his films to be honest as they are all pretty damn good. This one has a great theme of childhood exploration and satisfies for me the remembrance of an innocent time long past. This one really singles in on some personal stuff if you get it but I would imagine a lot of people won't have a clue and maybe that is for the better. The directing is astute and creative as always and the acting from all involved fits the film perfectly. The romance between the two kids is sweet and subtle. People who are calling it awkward or lewd are friggin' amazingly daft. The whole point of the story revolves around childhood love and imagination. I give it the full five stars. Wes is clearly a very talented guy and I look forward to each film he puts out.

Veteran actors like Bill Murray, Frances McDormand and Harvey Keitel are wasted. The true standouts of the film are the Khaki Scout troop 55 boys; they had some of the best parts in the film. I think Anderson should re-team up with Owen Wilson on writing duties since his best work (""Tenenbaums,"" ""Rushmore,"" ""Bottle Rocket"") has been with him.

Wes Anderson's films always remind me of the saying about Chinese food:  you feel full enough while seated at the table, but half an hour later you're hungry again.

I would like to like this movie.  In fact, I'd like to like several of Wes Anderson's movies.  They generally start with an intriguing premise and a talented cast.  Opening scenes promise a strong story, characters we can relate to, situations that touch our emotions.  But then, somewhere along the line, the storyline blurs, characters lose their focus, connections between scenes become tenuous or downright missing.  The original concept becomes muddied, the victim of a director who can't seem to maintain his interest in a central theme for enough minutes to add up to a feature film.

Moonrise Kingdom is like a book you pick up expecting a novel and instead find yourself reading a collection of vaguely related short stories.  There's no lack of humor or cleverness or emotional highlights.  But the pieces don't add up to a whole.  Call it light entertainment, which has its place in the world, to be sure, but it's disappointing if you're looking for in-depth character development or intellectual stimulation or cinematic excellence.",1352678400,2,1265,5.053140096618358

5098759,5,B007L6VR6M,"A real joy of a film. Wes Anderson created a delightful slightly off kilter world where the mundane becomes monumental and this movie very much reminded me of the ""The Great American Fourth of July and Other Disasters"". Anderson always seems to draw the best from the actors in his films but he's really outdone himself here. I don't think any actor stole the show but its amazing that this is the first film roles for the two primary child actors.",1352592000,2,448,4.54320987654321
5098760,5,B007L6VR6M,"This is the best example I've seen of what I call ""iconic directing"" (which is Anderson's unmistakable style) in which there are a lot of still camera shots of subjects, beautifully framed (often with symmetrical surroundings) and often still or hardly moving. Sometimes the camera moves only laterally while it surveys a scene. The subjects in these scenes are like icons of an idea or of humans or personality types. It is as if Anderson is trying to deliver a cinematic art museum complete with Mona Lisa shots: the still shots of lovely Suzy (Kara Hayward) staring into the camera, and even a museum guide, narrator Bob Balaban.

This is in stark contrast with  ""I want you in the room with them"" style of directing done with hand held camera action - the best example IMO being the very remarkable film `Biutiful"". In such films it's not icons but real people in your face.

The story is a kind of fairy tale, of course, but amusingly and charmingly presented with the great music of Benjamin Britten adding to the artful atmosphere. But it is the directing with its beautifully framed images, even more than the cute adolescent love story, that is well worth the ticket price.",1352592000,7,1182,4.728155339805825

5098763,3,B007L6VR6M,"Honestly, the rest of Wes Anderson's film all are above this one.  Moonrise Kingdom is my least favorite, would not watch it again. The sexualization of the children was very disturbing to watch as an adult...and I don't think that was the point.

The cast was, of course, phenomenal but the dialogue and delivery was off.  It was as if he was trying to make a quick version of his past films.  The costumes, sets, and cinematography were excellent and made the film watchable.

5098787,1,B007L6VR6M,"I brought this DVD home to watch because it seemed exactly like the kind of movie I would love: retro, cute, quirky, eclectic and amusing.  ""Moonrise Kingdom"" tried to be all of those things, but fell far short of the mark.  The movie tried so hard to be those things, in fact, that it was annoying to watch.  The sets and costumes were so overly stylized as to be trite and contrived.  The dialogue was dry and mono-toned, so much so that it seemed that all of the characters were on opiates.  (They weren't)  The characters were weak and undeveloped; you never really cared about any of them or what happened to them.

Years ago, Wes Anderson pulled off a huge success very nicely with ""The Royal Tennenbaums"", a dry, offbeat story about dysfunctional characters.  He did not manage to recreate the ambiance and delight of that great movie in ""Moonrise Kingdom"". The thing that irritated me the most what the use and overuse of Hank Williams' songs throughout the movie.  As an ardent Hank Williams fan, I did not appreciate hearing his great songs bastardized as an inept and ineffective movie score. For one thing, the classic Hank Williams songs evoke the nostalgia of the 1940's and early 1950's, not the mid-1960's.  The use of his iconic songs was one thing that actually ruined this movie for me.  Wes Anderson would have done much better using music that matched the era that he was trying to recreate, (which he was obviously confused about.) Perhaps he should have moved the story to the 40's or 50's. Not that there was much a story.  Putting a coon-skin cap on an awkward boy with nerdy glasses and having him run off to hide with a morose, skinny girl who loves to walk around in her underwear is hardly a story.  This movie has no redeeming value, please do not waste your time.",1352160000,17,1794,4.56875

Genre: 8.5 Movie: 5

Become a fan of ""The Lowedown"" on Facebook.

What's it about?
Set on an island off the coast of New England in the 1960s, as a young boy and girl fall in love they are moved to run away together. Various factions of the town mobilize to search for them and the town is turned upside down -- which might not be such a bad thing.

What did I think?
This is classic Wes Anderson work...it's too bad I am not a fan of Wes Anderson.  I gave it high marks, as it was a great film, But I found it odd and difficult to follow.  Not like ""Inception"", as I wanted to watch that one a second time...I just wanted this one out of my player.  If you are a fan of Anderson's work (""The Royal Tanenbaums"", ""Rushmore"", and ""Life Aquatic"" are examples), then you will love this movie.

5098830,5,B007L6VR6M,"Moonrise Kingdom is a great movie. It's heartfelt and loaded with great and compelling characters. The true beauty of this film lies with its masterful direction from Wes Anderson and its strong performances from its great cast. Wes Anderson's direction is excellent. He is clearly having fun doing what he's doing because his creativeness can even be seen through the credits.(Ex. Dots appearing on the screen in rhythm to the song, company logos popping up one at a time). That's something quite frankly no other movie director does.
As for the cast, Edward Norton pretty much steals the show as Scoutmaster Ward. Jason Schwartzman is hilarious as Cousin Ben. He his role is pretty minor and actually more of an extended cameo, but he steals every second of it. Bruce Willis is also very good as Captain Sharp. Taking a break from being an action hero, he shows that he has a big heart to show as well.(Not to mention hair! Was anybody else surprised by that?)
Jarad Gilman and Kara Hayward(the two kids who played Sam and Suzy) are also great as well. They played their roles perfectly. I would not at all be surprised if this is the start of successful careers for the two of them. Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton and Bob Balaban nail their roles as well. Also, the film features a beautiful musical score from Alexandre Desplat.
To conclude, Moonrise Kingdom is a beautiful and heartfelt motion picture that anyone can enjoy. This movie should at least be nominated for the Oscar for best picture. I personally think it should win it. Also, quite frankly, I would love it if they made a sequel.",1351814400,,1613,4.7437722419928825

I appreciate this (not that there's anything wrong with Transformers 4 or Expenables 3 or whatever, it's not like anyone watches those expecting to be blown away with nuance and subtext) because this, unlike the plethora of films out there lately that I actually sat down and paid attention to in order to make sure I didn't miss anything.

Insofar as the ""type"" of acting, production values it is pretty standard Wes Anderson film making so if you've seen The Royal Tenenbaums, The Life Aquatic etc you'll know what to expect.

I leave four stars simply because I had expected the film to be more based around the adults (Norton, Murray, McDormand, Willis) and their looking for the two runaways as opposed to being more about the runaways (Hayward and Gilman)and their being looked for.  This is a small matter that reflects my expectations and personal preference only as both Hayward and Gilman give performances as good as that given by their adult costars.",1351555200,,1181,4.690821256038648

She hadn't heard of it and I didn't really have a good idea of what to expect. We were actually searching for another film that featured Tilda Swinton, who plays a frosty villain in this piece, and decided to give it a go.

Moonrise Kingdom is lyrical, filmed in a lush, color-soaked style and steeped in a kind of faux Norman Rockwellian nostalgia for it's 1960's setting. It is a vision of a bucolic America that never existed, populated with famous actors, male and female.

A word of warning: this is not a children's film, per se, even though it is about children and is told in a fabulist style that hews close to Walt Disney. This film features themes such as adultery, sexual awakening, loss, the nature of family, and so forth neatly interwoven into its innocuous and breathtaking landscapes. It's not as hard-edged or crude as, say, Blue Velvet, but it's mighty subversive. Think ""Benicio del Toro directing your kindergarten Christmas play with visuals from Terence Malick""?

5098848,5,B007L6VR6M,"The Indy style movie has become so popular, major studios have copied it. This film has a well written script, effective sound track, excellent acting, background distractions, and of course quirky memorable characters. The film might may be best classified as a light drama, leaning toward comedy.

In this 1965 tale two misfit 12 year kids conspire to run off together. Sam (Jared Gilman) is a teased orphan scout. Suzy (Kara Hayward) is the daughter of two lawyers. They live on a New England island. A search party for the two missing youths is lead by ""sad dumb policeman"" Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis). Captain Sharp is having an affair with the mother of Suzy (Frances McDormand). Bill Murray plays the rather straight husband.

There is a scene where the two youths get close to each that made me uncomfortable for a moment. Fortunately the scene didn't last long and the film returned to its quirky self, with bits of dark comedy. While it is PG-13, I wouldn't want my 13 year old to watch it. It might give them ideas.

This is Kara Haywood's first full length film. I see a great career for her.

All the things I like about Anderson's movies - the cinematography, the unique narratives, the dry, clipped dialog, the attention to minuscule detail - seemed forced and predictable in Moonrise Kingdom. I just didn't believe the love story between these two at all, though they were both wonderful in their roles. I did love the Hank Williams soundtrack. And I'm happy to see Anderson has found a wider audience.

Life Aquatic, Rushmore, Royal Tannenbaums - these movies inspired me. Moonrise left me a little disappointed.",1351296000,,688,4.781512605042017
5098850,5,B007L6VR6M,"I usually only review older films (especially Criterion re-releases), owing a lot to the banality of Hollywood blockbusters.  So for me to pen a review of a recent film is rare.  But I think that is owing to the quality of this film, and to add one more positive note to the other mostly positive reviews.

This is terrific, vintage Anderson.  I wasn't crazy about Life Aquatic, though I can't really put my finger on why.  But Moonrise Kingdom was an enjoyable and lighthearted storybook style tale about two odd youths.  The first thing I want to point out is that the acting is terrific.  Anderson does seem to go for a campy style of film, and the actors all seem to be cast very well.  Edward Norton was my personal favorite in this film as the straight arrow scout leader.  I also enjoyed Bill Murray in his wonderful, yet small role.  And Bruce Willis has been hit or miss for me lately, but he was great in this film.  Folks might forget that he had a great early career with more comedic roles (Moonlighting for example).  And I can't forget to mention a wonderful Frances McDormand as well as a quirky and enjoyable Harvey Keitel in a rather fun role for him.

Wes Anderson creates films that seem to be the film equivalent of a modern children's tall tale (at least his last two).  I would imagine that Anderson has a tiny little 6 year old tucked in his mind somewhere that he taps for storytelling.  Or he might just talk to kids a lot, who knows!  But what I know is that these films are grown up, but not in an adult way.  They are a bit more complex than a kids film, and with adult situations (though this one is more lighthearted than Royal Tenenbaums of course).  But I compare this a bit to Fantastic Mr. Fox (amazing film!) and Life Aquatic as well.

The Blu-Ray transfer is very clean.  This set has the DVD version as well.  Just be aware that the Ultraviolet copy has several issues.  But any digital media is going to have issues with multiple devices.  And I understand that eventually the digital copy goes away (according to previous Ultraviolet releases).  My question is, why isn't Criterion marketing this?  I thought he had some kind of arrangement with them.  But regardless, the hardware is worthy.  Just don't count on the digital copy as being perfect.

I don't think this film is going to appeal to everyone.  But those viewers who want a fun trip through childhood nostalgia will enjoy it.  The acting and direction are spot on.  There are a few slow moments to the film, but there is quite enough humor and just plain silliness to keep the viewer riveted.  I highly encourage purchasing a copy because it makes a great film to watch with friends and family.  Even for those folks who have not seen an Anderson flick, this would make a great introduction to his work.  One of the better, ultimately feel good films of 2012.  Perhaps a couple of Oscar nominations will be had.  Though the film will probably follow the typical Wes Anderson Oscar story: nominated, losing to a film less deserving (Royal Tenenbaums was better original screenplay than Gosford Park - which ripped off 'Rules of the Game' - in my humble opinion).  Is it the best Wes Anderson film?  Perhaps.  But it all depends on your preference.  Lets just agree that it is equally as good as anything he has created.",1351209600,2,3320,4.514285714285714

The only one I've liked was Fantastic Mr. Fox, which was thanks to Roald Dahl and NOT Anderson. Moonrise Kingdom was arguably the worst of his films I've had to endure. It was a miserable, depressing movie about a bunch of miserable, depressed people. The basic plot - burgeoning adolescent love - was not original or interesting. The characters were awful, despite being played by some fantastic actors (I especially love Tilda Swinton and Edward Norton).

Warning: spoiler-ish items ahead.

The only remotely likeable character was Sam, the boy, and even he was only mildly interesting. Suzy was atrocious. How is a movie about a girl who stabs another child in the kidney with a pair of scissors billed as a heartwarming, romantic tale? And there were never any consequences for her behavior. Her obvious mental health issues were not addressed. The completely unnecessary killing of the dog was the final flush of the toilet for this film. I also hated that all the adults were portrayed as inept, incompetent, barely-functioning morons. They all looked aged, washed out and depressed, yet little Suzy appears in teeny dresses (or just her underwear) and a full face of make-up in every scene. The make-out scene was painfully awkward, rather than sweet.

I could go on and on. I'll just leave at this - I just do not understand what it is about Anderson's films that inspires a cult following.",1351123200,10,1527,4.910852713178294

The scenery was beautiful, and the cast, absolutely first rate.

It wasn't supposed to convey reality.  And the violence put my wife off of it.
Over dramatizing the scout stuff was clever and funny at times.  But I was still not sure what part of never-never land the director wanted me to reside within.

Wes Anderson's movies have simply gotten better over time.  I feel I enjoy each more than its predecessor.  He straddles that line between genius and insanity (and films it right between the swim fins I'm sure he wears daily).  While I look forward to his next endeavor, I'm also fairly sure he should be locked up because his brand of crazy is probably communicable.  The cast was fantastic and I highly recommend to people that understand this kind of storytelling.  The story is simple.  Two pre-teens fall in love and run away together... on an island that's about the size of your local mall.  Everyone (seriously, everyone) takes scouting very seriously in this movie.  I also think it's possible that if you put Bill Murray, Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, and Jason Schwartzman together on an island for 6 weeks, this movie would have been the likely result even without scripts or planning.",1350950400,4,1050,4.783333333333333

5098864,5,B007L6VR6M,"First, let me get something out of the way: I'm a brainless Wes Anderson fan and couldn't possibly offer you an actual review of this movie.  I'm a hipster twit who would love this movie even if it were just a blank screen for 2 hours, etc., etc.  If you don't like Wes Anderson's films, and he is entrenched in his style enough that you know what that means, please save yourself the frustration of reading my review...because I do like Wes Anderson and I won't respond to any comments along the lines of the above.

I don't think Anderson is a one note director even though there is no debate that his films all share a particular feel, style, and tone.  When the opportunity presents itself in this film, quite a bit of it takes place outside in larger spaces, his typical meticulous mis-en-scene is showcased.  The dialogue is as spare, direct, and tight as ever.  Some people apparently find this off-putting since the two leads are children...I think this betrays a lack of familiarity with Anderson (maybe more, but at least this) since he has always handled children /as they are/ - as young adults.  I mentioned RT in the title because I think it is the closest to MK in terms of emotional tone.  There is a desperation in all of these characters that cuts through my defenses as a viewer.  I won't deny being a willing audience, but I have no trouble finding my way into each moment.  Finally, to wrap up the general stuff, there is a touch of the fantastic in Moonrise Kingdom that seems like a holdover from the Life Aquatic - but I don't think it is central to the film and it doesn't change the overall tone.

This is an adventure story, and a love story, and an escape story...at times it's tragic, at times funny, at times awkward, and it's almost always exciting.  In short this is a movie about being a young (pre-)teen.  The leads are in that embarrassing moment in which hormones, desire, and passion meet with inexperience.  They are isolated from the world in many ways and alienated from their peers and most of the adults around them.  It's the two of them against the world.  And the really lovely thing about this film is the way they succeed.
The adults are all disconnected from the children to different degrees (for different reasons), but one of the many exceptional things about the film is the way that each adult is a foil for the leads.  One easy example is the failed marriage of Suzy's parents contrasted with the feverish and indomitable love between Suzy and Sam.  As is always the case with Anderson, not a moment or exchange is wasted or empty.

I'd like to say more about the movie, but it would really be best for you to just see it.

Product note and two tangents:
- The blu-ray release is very fine in terms of picture and sound, but many fans will find the lack of additional features somewhat disappointing.  I am sure that a future release (Criterion maybe) will include such features.  In the meantime this bare-bones release will either sate your appetite for the film, or just seem like a money grab, etc.  I'm not disappointed enough, or cynical enough, to feel cheated...and besides, I don't want to wait...
-  If you're on the fence about this film because you've heard that there is something voyeuristic, pornographic, or indecent about Suzy and Sam's relationship (a particular scene really seems to have bothered some viewers)...please do yourself a favor and put that out of your mind.  I have no idea how anyone could find this so offensive...I could venture a guess, but it would be very mean...if you live in a world in which teenagers do not think sexual thoughts, utter sexual sentences, or do sexual things, then you may very well be offended.
- Along the same lines, if you're on the fence because you've heard there is gratuitous violence against an animal...please put that out of your mind also.  If you think a good film CANNOT portray an animal being harmed, then you will not think this is a good film.  If, instead, you think that a film can portray an animal being harmed as part of a larger story, as part of a particular moment in a character's development, then you should not hesitate to watch the film on this account.  For anyone suggesting that the death is unnecessary, callous, or in poor taste, I implore you to watch the film again and consider this moment more carefully.  Some people have pointed to RT - since an animal dies in that movie as well - and drawn a larger conclusion about Anderson's lack of concern/care for animals.  I worry that these people are not watching the films...these deaths are catalysts for the story, triggers for changes in certain characters, and are deeply emotional moments.

Of course, this film is not for everyone.  The leads are children, but the film is not for most children.  If you have a strong opinion about Wes Anderson, let that be your guide.  I think this is Anderson's best since the Royal Tenenbaums and I cannot break the tie between them for my favorite of his movies.",1350864000,7,5005,4.580246913580247

5098866,5,B007L6VR6M,"Very few movie makers can pull off something like this. Something which is not only engaging, but really sweet and touching while still having moments of pure hilarity (another movie which comes to mind is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost-in-Translation-Blu-ray/dp/B001AQO400/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost in Translation [Blu-ray</a>&nbsp;also starring Bill Murray) and Wes Anderson really pulls that off in this movie.

Here we have these two kids who just want to be together and yet they're surrounded with dozens of clueless adults and a whole scout troop out to sabotage the young boy. The film is essentially about being with the person you love against all odds. I don't really want to go into the story too much as it's really something worth seeing as this isn't a movie you can describe to people without them going ""So, like, these kids run away on an island? Why are you telling me to go see this?"" - trust me, it happens a lot trying to get people to see this.

As for the Blu-ray quality, it has very good sharpness, good black levels and great colours. The film was shot in 16mm so there's grain throughout the whole film. Let me make this clear: This is intentional on part of the filmmaker to give it a specific look. The Blu-ray looks exactly how it was intended.

The audio is mostly spoken mixed with the excellent music selection which usually accompanies Anderson's films and it all sounds perfect. I can't comment on the surround as I'm still on a 2.0 system.

5098868,5,B007L6VR6M,"Have you ever looked at someone and, in an instant, felt a powerful connection to them? Something that made you want to abandon your life and run away with them? Not me, but the same can't be said for two teens at the center of the latest comedy from the mind of Wes Anderson.

  It's 1965 and, on a small, picturesque island in New England, there are two very unhappy children. One of them, Sam Shakusky (played by Jared Gilman), is an orphan visiting Camp Ivanhoe with his troop of wilderness-oriented Khaki Scouts. The other, Suzy Bishop (played by Kara Hayward), lives on the island with her parents, Walt and Laura (played by veteran actors Bill Murray and Frances McDormand) and three younger brothers. Walt and Laura (Murray and McDormand) are both attorneys who are struggling to maintain both their personal and their professional relationship. One year before the beginning of our story, Sam and Suzy meet backstage during a play which Sam is attending and Suzy is acting in. Despite the brevity of that encounter, the two find themselves inexorably drawn to each other and exchange letters during their separation. They vow to run away together the next summer. We fast-forward to '65 and Sam has vanished from Camp Ivanhoe and done it without alerting his scout master, Randy Ward (played by Edward Norton) or any of his fellow scouts. The search is well underway before the Sheriff, Captain Sharp (played by Bruce Willis) is made aware of the fact that Suzy has vanished as well. When the young lovers meet again, Sam has brought a multitude of camping necessities while Suzy brought books, her cat, records and a record player. They hike and camp for days until finding a deserted cove and make camp, naming their new home Moonrise Kingdom.

  Obviously, there is more to the story. There's the revelation that two of the adult characters are involved in a clandestine relationship of their own, additional details of Sam's life story are revealed, and his eventual confrontation with his former scout troop who see it as their responsibility to bring Sam back using any means necessary, including lethal. All this culminates in a scene that had me on the edge of my seat. More than likely, this film, like some of director Wes Anderson's previous efforts, will fail to resonate with the viewing public. I, however, enjoyed it a great deal.",1350777600,,2354,4.828784119106699

5098877,5,B007L6VR6M,"""Moonrise Kingdom"" is the best film I've seen in years.  It was flawless.  Brilliant!  And, really, I've never seen anything like it.
""Moonrise's..."" uh, sensibilities... are...
whimsically nuts is one way to put it, I guess.  I'm really at a loss for words.
But I can't recall when I last had so much fun watching a movie.
SPOILER ALERT!  Essentially, this is a story about two twelve year olds (a boy and a girl) who run away from home.  Partly because they're misfits, but mostly because they've ""fallen in love.""
Which is exactly the sort of story I'm predisposed to dislike.  In the main, I don't care for movies featuring kids.  Never have (with only rare, rare exceptions).
But I think my bias in that regard was a non-issue with ""Moonrise,"" because even though it stars kids -- and its plot is centered upon them -- it's not really about  kids.  Having said that, though, I'm not completely sure what ""Moonrise"" was about.
Director Wes Anderson took an inherently sad, melancholy --potentially tragic -- story about two kids who don't fit and made the audience (me, at least) smile and laugh while watching it.  Given that, then, I think ""Moonrise"" is much, much more than a charming little film about two endearing twelve year olds.
As I said earlier, however, I'm at a loss for words in trying to describe this film.  It really overwhelmed me.  First chance I get, I intend to watch it another time or two, and then try again to organize my thoughts and feelings about it.  In the meantime, though, I'll say this in closing:  ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is a gem of a film, and I can't begin to imagine anyone who sees it not enjoying it.
Oh... almost forgot.  Bruce Willis, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Ed Norton, Harvey Keitel and Tilda Swinton are all positively great in ""Moonrise.""  As were the two young actors.  The casting and acting in ""Moonrise"" are as good as it gets.
* What follows was written an hour after I wrote the preceding and added in an ""edit""*
Had to take a little more time to really digest this film.
Clearly, ""Moonrise"" is social commentary.  But social commentary done with wit, insight and intelligence.
Wes Anderson's caricatures of people like clueless parents, self-important attorneys, simple-minded, but well-meaning scout masters, and social workers who take themselves too seriously (to mention just some of the ""Moonrise"" adults) are spot-on.  And people such as those invite send-ups.  Which I thought Anderson did splendidly.  And with a sense of humor.
In any case, I could go on at length about ""Moonrise.""  It worked for me on a number of levels.  Which is why I facetiously entitled this review ""Wes Anderson For President.""  Because, in my experience, it's rare, rare, rare to come across a film this well-done.
I should point out, however, that until seeing ""Moonrise,"" that I'd never really heard of Wes Anderson.  But after seeing this film, I'm eager to check out what else he's done.",1350518400,,2935,4.773809523809524

5098879,5,B007L6VR6M,"Wes Anderson is the most under-appreciated director of this generation. Sure, his fans are quick to expulse praise, but the general film-watching public has been slow to warm to Anderson's brand of quirk and charm.

Moonrise Kingdom takes all of the Anderson trademarks and bakes them into a touching story about adolescent love. As expected, the writing is sharp, the direction precise, and the attention-to-detail mindboggling. With every subsequent viewing, you'll notice new details in the background and begin to smile at your favorite lines.

The Blu-Ray version is stupendous. The transfer is clean and the extras are adequate. What more do you really need?

As to the movie itself.... It's obvious that it was intended to be quirky.

All-in-all it was entertaining just to see the oddity of it. Something totally different than the usual Hollywood offerings. If you want a bit of lighthearted and unusual entertainment for a rainy afternoon, this is your movie.
For those that are concerned with the content (warning: some may feel this should be given a spoiler alert, so here you go): Some foul language: I think 2 or 3 that I noticed (I think there was 1 SOB, and 1 or 2 D-words, and one JesusC). Only one 'big' fight scene of two boys struggling with one being punched in the sides, lasts for only a moment as the aim in that scene is not to fight each other. Views showing/dialog of weapons, none of which you see actually being used - although you see the after affects of two of them (bloody craft scissors, and an injured/dead animal). One 'make-out' scene that while was innocent enough in the acting, the dialog pertaining to it was adult in nature, something parents might not feel comfortable having their own children hear being discussed.",1350345600,3,1501,4.7110266159695815

5098889,4,B007L6VR6M,"The 411 by Maria:

The movie starts off feeling very odd to me, I mean Ed Norton, Bruce Willis, Bill Murphy, Francis McDormand, and Harvey Keitel (to name a few) big name folks in a movie that seems very dated, slow and ""stage"" like.  Ed Norton in a ""cub scout leader"" like uniform through the whole movie was just odd.  BUT...once you get past that you see it is a yesteryear look into the 60's done in a beautifully nostalgic way when life was simpler.  BUT...beside all of that, it is a beautifully done, well act movie by all players.

The story focuses on two tweens, one odd and an orphan and the other from a well to do home. Their love story is very sweet, and the actors both in their first film are incredibly talented.  The girl, Suzy played by Kara Hayward reminded me of a young Abagail Breslin and the actor Sam, played by Jared Gilman was adorably odd and dorky with his slightly askew glasses and crooked smile.

The scenes are set up beautifully and while the movie is slow, quiet and sweet, the love story of these two children affect all around them mostly for the better.

I love the scenes of the two off on their own, making camp, fishing, taking inventory of their belongs and taking care of each other. Very sweet.

There are a few scenes that I was uncomfortable with as the two youths (I sound like Joe Pesci), were 12ish during the filming and spend a bit of time in their underwear. I mostly imagine 70 or so people on the set while these two walk and dance around in their skivvies and how wrong that is. Their kissing scenes are adorable too and not overly sexualized but I always wonder what sick fantasy the writer or director are living out.

All in all, this is a good movie with a great cast!",1349395200,,1727,4.318885448916409
5098890,4,B007L6VR6M,"Wes Anderson does his thing again with a quirky, rich, melancholy character piece. The particulars may be different, but really he's been making the same movie (in many cases, even using the same actors) for years and this one's no different: it's artfully arranged, leisurely paced and quietly withdrawn. It rewards those with the notion to read in between the lines, embraces the beauty of a natural setting, and cracks awkwardly funny stone-faced jokes at the most unexpected moments. The mood is decidedly childish, both in subject and in perspective, but for the most part that works to put the audience in the right mindset, rather than dumbing things down. It does occasionally overstretch itself, though, particularly as events begin to climax and believability abruptly becomes less of a priority. If you've enjoyed Anderson's earlier pictures there's plenty to like here, although it doesn't even begin to rival Rushmore or The Royal Tenenbaums and I was surprised by the lack of a matching soundtrack. Non-fans should continue to keep their distance.",1349049600,,1061,5.2105263157894735
5098891,2,B007L6VR6M,"*Spoiler Alert* I just finished watching this film & didn't know at what point to stop watching.  It was was one agonizing scene after the next.  Where do I begin?  Do I start with discussing the emotionless, unrealistic, adolescent acting?  Or analyze the story's unpalatable, schizophrenic love affair?  Clearly, this is two deeply disturbed children that need serious psychiatric evaluation.  I saw one reviewer's title as ""Stirs the memories of adolescent love"".  Okay, for one, I personally don't know anybody that has the fond memories of running off into the wilderness at the age of 12-13 with a schizo girlfriend who's capable of stabbing a person.  Nor do I know of any 12 year old's preparing to jump off a church steeple together (Another filmmaker trying to take a blow at the Christians too).  I understand the heart-wrenching crushes we've all endured & my 1st kiss near that age, but this goes far beyond what I can consider a relatable trip down memory lane.  The raw imagery of the girl being felt up by the boy & likewise of the girl describing his erection is far more than the audience needs in trying to captivate the emotions that are being felt.  We're all adults.  We get it or we've been there before!  It borders voyeurism & pedophilia disguised in the name of ""art"".  I'm so sick of these masks used in the world of art & film.  Anderson tries to cleverly wrap all of this with his usual bland, retro-colored imagery as recognizable in The Life Aquatic, Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums & The Darjeeling Limited.  The film also blatantly displays a socialistic viewpoint (much like Rushmore) in where the kids are the product of a sterile, systematic environment molded by a regimented scout troupe by means of uncaring, inept parents & dumbfounded adults.  Shamefully, the strong cast this film has assembled (Murray, Willis, McDormand, Norton) was wasted as character cannon fodder for the mundane, misguided love affair between two cardboard cutout kids & taking a backseat to the story's development.  The character's are all 2 dimensional & make no emotional connection to its' audience, hence the reason I wouldn't have cared if the kids jumped off that church steeple.  Much like the Life Aquatic, I had a very difficult time determining when to laugh & when to take it serious which makes it somewhat emotionally strenuous.  It draws no clear distinction in its' intentions or direction, which makes it boldly pretentious.  I did not like this film & will not recommend it to anyone.  I don't care for Wes Anderson's work beyond The Royal Tenenbaums.  He's lost his touch of quirky comedic delivery & offbeat humorous, heartwarming storytelling (The Darjeeling Limited was an exception, I did mildly enjoy it).  People are drawn to pretentiousness & traditions, so that's why fans of Wes Anderson will like this film, because it follows his latest formula & since they liked most of his previous work they will give this a good review.  Most people have a hard time looking at an individual body of work for what it is & making a clear & fair judgement, which is why it only makes sense this is getting so many rave reviews.  Sorry to burst Anderson's pretentious bubble, but this film is just not good & can hardly be called entertainment.",1348876800,12,3274,4.843525179856115

This may end up being a pretty short review because since this is a Wes Anderson movie people have already kind of made up their mind on whether to watch or not. His style is not for everyone. To me I either really love his stuff or I don't. I really like almost all his work (I didn't like ""Royal Tananbaums"") but to me ""Rushmore"" and ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" are his best. This one is not at the level of those movies but this is still pretty funny. There are few directors that have a definite style and you know instantly that it's one of their movies. Anderson, Kubric and Hitchcock are the ones that come immediately to mind. Again though this is funny but not for everyone, very dry humor.

For Cahiers cred I used to flash a more highbrow list, Tarkovsky, Kubrick, Malick etc. I could also cite Spirited Away, Apocalypse Now, and hundreds of films which gave me something. But the big four, in some kind of order, are the films which have forged my structure in the crucible of the multiplex.

The year Mulholland Drive and Royal Tenenbaums came out, 2001, was a year of miracles. Since then I have dared to hope many times, mostly that Wes Anderson would pull out of his post-Tenenbaums tailspin and once more make the projector spit fire. But INLAND EMPIRE was the nearest to a fresh revelation.
Or maybe I got too old to understand the oracle's smoke blackened speech.

Maybe Mr. Anderson's theme of failure no longer resonates the way it used to do. I'm certainly pocked with dents in which it could resound, such as unemployment, but, having met my strange standards in poetry and photography, become Wilder's dad, and sheltering in Maile's light, I don't identify quite as much with Wes' usual bereft man-child (Excalibur is also a story of failure).

Finally making a film about children (instead of, as one critic observed, about the disappointed adults they become) should have loosed a serpent into Mr. Anderson's exquisitely manicured style. Despite initial appearances, maybe it did. Top critic consensus seems to be ""Tweer than ever, I love it!"" I found the trademarked deadpan Anderson dialogue in the mouths of those child actors (no doubt giving it their all) hard to buy. Kids have grave feelings, and sometimes speak gravely, but this wasn't making it for me. Didn't quite get belief in their characters. Mr. Anderson seemed to be keeping the whole story a dolly's length away. Relentless over-stylization breaking immersion.
I did think Mr and Mrs Bishop's separate bed dialogue was an excellent encapsulation of the Anderson ethos: ""Quit feeling sorry for yourself."" ""Why."" (That is the only reply that makes sense when you're riding a bummer.)
Some new homages, Pierrot le Fou (invoking the whole doomed lovers' society-abandoning nature idyll tradition of Badlands, Marie Baie Des Anges). Bande a part, with the Francoise Hardy dance on the beach.

But despite all the antics I walked away thinking not of a romp, but feeling like I had lived through a perilous journey into the abyss of sex and death. That kid got stabbed in the back with scissors, (and Sam punched the wound repeatedly), Snoopy got killed by an arrow, the grown ups were gonna give Sam electroshock therapy, and I squirmed in terror of how far the sexualization of Suzy was going to go. Despite continually snapping back to comedy (sometimes in the same shot), I found Moonrise Kingdom intense.

But Moonrise Kingdom is a sort of an ode to this beautiful man and the great films he has given us. He can simply bring a script to life and make you believe its an story book tale. Moonrise Kingdom gave me a beautiful feeling in witch I haven't had since watching Rushmore years ago. This movie is a thing of beauty and makes you urn for young love.

5098898,5,B007L6VR6M,"Once in a while, a movie comes along that's just so magical that there's no way to describe it. Moonrise Kingdom is one such. It comes across as an utterly low-key indie flick, but with boggling star power: Bruce Willis, Bill Murray, and Tilda Swinton. But even at that, the kids take the movie over, as they should.

The couple, age twelvish, come across with authenticity that borders on painful. Each is disaffected, each wants more and sees it within reach, and each sees it within the other, somehow. They take off on their doomed trek, together, trusting in each other and not a lot else. And, along the way, they share some of the more awkward moments of young love - with utterly serious solemnity, as kids do when trying to act grown up.

The thing is, they do it - at least sort of. They make enemies, and defeat them. They need allies, and make them. And, in the end, they win, sort of. The adult actors rise to the children's level, especially Swinton in the role of Social Services (apparently wearing what she found in a Pan Am stewardess's closet). But, don't worry. Nothing I can say can really be a spoiler. When something, even something very familiar, is done very well, it becomes a new thing. This is done very, very well. Even with its near-total lack of special effects, it's very special indeed.

5098899,5,B007L6VR6M,"Wes Anderson's Moonrise Kingdom opens with the sound of the composer Benjamin Britten's ""Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra,"" which breaks down, piece by piece, each section of the orchestra and then later builds it back up.  The work is reminiscent of opening up a pocket watch in order to see all of the gears working in conjunction.  It is not lost on the audience that as Britten's music is deconstructed, Anderson presents the inside of a household, using perfectly choreographed camera movements, that is itself immaculately designed by the eye of an idiosyncratic artist.  This got me thinking: is Wes Anderson one of our greatest creators of fantasy worlds?

It might seem strange to suggest that Anderson should be mentioned alongside people like C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien, and George R.R. Martin.  You won't find dragons or magic spells in his work, but what you will find is a hermetically sealed universe that seems to jump wholesale out of the mind of a singular artist.  Is Anderson's fetish for vintage audio equipment that far removed from Tolkien's love of medieval verse?  While every one of Anderson's films is created in a world that is slightly out of step from our own, of all his live action work Moonrise Kingdom seems to rest out on its own plane of existence.

And much of Moonrise Kingdom's potency comes from the understanding that children and adults inhabit distinct and separate realms.  The film takes place in the 1960s on a sleepy New England island, New Penzance, which is not only largely separated from the mainland but also bares a name that would look comfortable written on a map of a fantasy world.  This close knit community is frayed when two young children, Sam and Suzy, go on the lam, making their way deep into the woods of the island thanks to skills Sam has picked up attending the Khaki Scouts.  As the children retreat into the wilderness, the adults scramble to catch up with them.  As we move back and forth between the adult world and the world of children, we understand the distinct sort of dysfunction that infects both.  In the 1960s both Sam and Suzy might have been called ""trouble children.""  Sam is an orphan who doesn't fit in well with his foster family (in fact, his foster father decides that he won't invite him back to the house after hearing about his flight) and Suzy is prone to outbursts of violence and rage.  But where the children have trouble suppressing their emotions, the adults, in typical Andersonian fashion, hide their dysfunction under a laconic haze.  Suzy's mother and father (played by Francis MacDormond and Bill Murray) are mired in a loveless marriage, which has led her mother to take up with the local police chief, Sharp (Bruce Willis).

Wes Anderson clues us into his interest in world making through a series of books that Suzy brings along on her retreat with Sam.  These books carry fantastical names like The Francine Odyssey, The Disappearance of the 6th Grade, and The Girl from Jupiter.  This need for escapism obviously parallels the children's flight into the woods.  To disappear into the world of fantasy isn't far off from dropping off the map and slipping out from under the expectations of adults.  Anderson constructs this universe with the help of a map as well as the narrating power of Bob Ballaban, who doubles as a wizard-like character who figures out how to catch up with Sam and Suzy.  As the film progresses, it becomes further and further detached from our world.  In fact, at times it seems as if Anderson is applying techniques he learned in his animated film, The Fantastic Mr. Fox, onto a live action palate.  This allows him to ratchet up the scope of his film towards the end by introducing a flood that seems to be borrowed from one of the world's most famous fantasy epics, The Old Testament.

But of all the great fantasy writers out there, perhaps none pervade Anderson's universe more than the great artist, Charles M. Schulz.  Anderson, never one to be shy about his influences, even names a dog Snoopy.  In Peanuts, Schulz may have created one of the longest lasting fantasy worlds, stretching out over a half of a century.  And while he may have made the adults invisible (they only appeared in the TV specials as indecipherable and disembodied voices), he never ran away from adult concerns.  Where Anderson creates a world where two misfits can largely escape the dysfunctions of the adult world, Schultz had his prepubescent characters shoulder the crushing burdens of existential malaise.  And yet, there's something refreshing about the optimism found in Moonrise Kingdom, along with much of Anderson's work (an optimism that Schultz often struggled to find).  He manages to be both critical and highly empathetic towards his characters.  For Anderson, a fantasy world isn't so much a retreat as it is an invitation, and one that I am never hesitant to take up.",1343520000,7,4903,4.827751196172249
5098900,5,B007L6VR6M,"It is something of a challenge to write a review of a Wes Anderson film. How do you explain a film where the soundtrack includes pieces by Hank Williams and Benjamin Britten and yet they both fit perfectly?  Everything about Anderson's style is so unique, from the way the visual shots are composed and the way the dialogue is written to the way the actors deliver the dialogue, not to mention the myriad odd little background details that are worked in throughout.  It's almost impossible to simply describe the film and still do it proper justice.  The best I can really say about Moonrise Kingdom is that it's arguably the ultimate Wes Anderson film, his masterpiece at least to date. And I say that as someone who isn't - or at least wasn't prior to this film - a particular fan of his work.

Written by Wes Anderson and Roman Coppola, Moonrise Kingdom takes place in the summer of 1965 on an island off the coast of New England, where two twelve-year-old misfits - Sam Shakusky (Jared Gilman) and Suzy Bishop (Kara Hayward) run off together into the wilderness because they've fallen in love.  In flashback, we learn that Sam, an orphan who's a member of Khaki Scout Troop 55, which has its summer camp every year on the island, and Suzy, whose utterly dysfunctional family has a summer house on the island, met the previous summer and felt an instant affinity for each other, which resulted in their corresponding over the year and hatching a plan to run away together when the two of them would again be on the island the following summer.  When they meet up, each brings what they think they'll need to survive.  Sam brings camping equipment; Suzy brings six books, her cat, and a portable record player.

A search begins for the two runaways when their respective adults notice they're missing.  In the case of Sam, this is Scout Master Randy Ward (Edward Norton), and in Suzy's case, her lawyer parents, Walt Bishop (Bill Murray) and Laura Bishop (Frances McDormand) , who in turn call in the island's local police chief, Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis), who we subsequently learn has been having a long-term affair with Laura that both realize is hopeless but neither has the strength to walk away from.

I don't want to give away any more about the plot as a lot of the enjoyment of a Wes Anderson film is simply watching things unfold in delightful, unexpected and sometimes simply weird ways, and Moonrise Kingdom is no exception.  I will say that the ending was perfectly written and executed, bringing a number of plot threads and themes together in ways that you'll truly have to experience to appreciate.  If nothing else, Moonrise Kingdom truly merits an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay.  The dialogue, the originality and the way in which the themes are developed in in which all of the intricate elements are tied together as the story plays out is truly a work of art. Not to mention all of the myriad little cultural cues and references worked into the visuals and the dialogue, from the more obvious ones like Noah's Ark and Peter Pan to the more obscure like Chief Joseph and the Flight of the Nez Perce.

The performances are all top-notch, to the point that it's difficult to single out any one as being superior to the rest. Newcomers Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward turn in particularly deft performances as Sam and Suzy, more than able to carry the film's center as events swirl around them. Bruce Willis does a particularly nuanced job as the island's police chief, trying to do the right thing by the two runaways even when he can't manage to do it for himself, his eyes and his pauses delivering volumes about the things he doesn't say.  Bill Murray's Walt is a bleakly comic mix of bluster and despair, while Frances McDormand's Laura runs the family show, herding her kids around with a bull-horn (something apparently Anderson's mother actually did). Edward Norton's Scout Master Randy goes through one of the film's more interesting evolutions as events lead him out of his comfort zone of structure and order into swirling chaos and eventually to surprising self-discovery.  The boys who make up the rest of the Khaki Scouts in Troop 55 make an excellent supporting group-think character, as do the boys who play Suzy's three younger brothers.  In addition to the cast already mentioned, other notable actors who show up are Bob Balaban as the film's on-screen Narrator (who is also apparently the island's local historian and who gives a bizarre visual impression of having been one of Santa's elves in a past life), Jason Schwartzman as one of the scout's Cousin Ben, Harvey Keitel as Khaki Scout Commander Pierce, and Tilda Swinton as ""Social Services"" (it's one of the running jokes in the film).

A lot of themes run through Moonrise Kingdom, particularly with regard to the question of whether there is any real difference between adults and children.  The adults in Moonrise Kingdom all experience private feelings of inadequacy in their roles as adults, and in fact act like children in their dealings with each other, but maintain the pretense nonetheless in the presence of the 'real' children.  The children in turn act like little versions of the adults, the only difference being that they're not yet aware of their inadequacies and hence do not feel inhibited by them.  A lot of this is played out in the dialogue and the way the actors deliver it, maintaining an even consistency in the level of vocabulary and in the rhythm of delivery, whether the words are coming from an adult or a kid, further erasing the boundaries we generally use to distinguish between the two.  The adults sound like the children and the children sound like the adults, but without the doubts.

There are a number of memorable scenes in the movie, many humorous but some surprising in how they speak again to the issues of whether there really is any difference between adulthood and childhood.  And in the inadequacies adults feel in their roles as adults.  One of my favorites is a moment where Walt and Laura are lying awake in their summer house, unable to sleep with the two kids missing and the sound of the approaching storm beginning to rise outside. As they stare at the ceiling, Walt, in a moment of despondent candor, says ""I hope the roof flies off and sucks me into space.""  When Laura reminds him ""We're all they've got,"" Walt replies simply but tellingly ""It's not enough.""  Another great scene occurs when the other Scouts in the troop go searching for Sam, but only after arming themselves with every weapon they can find or make. It's darkly comic and appalling at the same time when you realize that the boys are just mimicking what they think adults are like.

On a side note, the books in the film that Suzy takes with her - and from which she reads to Sam and to the other Scouts - are completely fictitious.  Or at least they were.  Anderson commissioned six artists to create jacket covers for the books, and then he wrote the passages for each of the books that Suzy ends up reading aloud. Anderson had considered creating animated segments to accompany the reading scenes, but in the end he chose instead to just have Suzy reading with the boys listening enraptured. After the film was completed and released though, Anderson decided to animate all six books and use assemble them in a video in which Bob Balaban, acting against as narrator, introduces the segment for each of the books.  This video may appear in the DVD/Blu-ray release as bonus material.

All in all, I would highly recommend Moonrise Kingdom, both to fans of Wes Anderson as his best film to date, and to anyone else who enjoys quirky but highly engaging story-telling with masterful attention to every detail and fine performances by an extremely talented cast of actors.",1343347200,89,7815,4.744649446494465

I'll be re-watching this movie for years to come.",1343088000,11,312,4.589285714285714
5098902,5,B007L6VR6M,"Best described as one part ""A Christmas Story"", one part ""Stand By Me"", and one part ""Lord of the Flies"", with an extra helping of young estrogen from newcomer Kara Hayward to help balance out all of the snakes and snails and puppy-dog tails. Confused? At the end of the day Moonrise Kingdom is a very unique movie, one that is worthy of the copious amounts of praise that is being heaped upon it.

Set on a small, sparsely populated chain of island in the 1960s that has more boyscout camps on it than townspeople, a twelve year old boy and girl decide that even if nobody likes them that they love each other. They set off into the wilderness with a coon skin cap, bb-gun, a yellow pup tent, some french records, and a few stolen library books. When they turn up missing, their parents, the police, and fellow scouts set out to try to find them, even though in many cases they were the ones that drove them away in the first place.

This is all done in a light-comedy, tongue in cheek kind of way, but because you end up caring about the characters so much the movie carries with it a fair amount of emotion. The funny scenes predominate, but there is also a lot of suspense towards the end when you realize the fate of the kids and the movie itself is entirely up in the air. It has been a long time since I've seen a film where I sensed it was about to end but did not know what was going to happen.

Although littered with many well known stars for the adult roles, both of the leading kids are played quite well by unknown newcomers. Jared Gilman reminds me of Ralphie from ""A Christmas Story"", wearing thick glasses and relying on his Red Ryder as he tries to navigate the perils of both the wilderness and his tween years. He may be a little more take charge than Ralphie, having already taken Scutt Farkas' coon skin cap from the school of hard knocks, but you'll see many similarities. One of Kara Hayward's on screen brothers is also interestingly the spitting image of Ralphie's younger brother Randy.

Hayward plays the female tween misfit in this backwoods Romeo & Juliet, and would remind you a little bit of Wednesday from the Addams Family if not for the fact that she wears all pink and carries a kitten with her instead of being dressed in black with a headless doll. But she definitely carries Wednesday's personality, dry wit and style. Whereas Jared Gilman plays an orphan, Kara's character comes from a dysfunctional family who makes her feel like she wishes she had none. When she tells this to Gilman he quickly responds ""I love you, but you don't know what you're talking about"". While sometimes seemingly vulnerable and filled with self doubt, her trusty pair of ""lefty-scissors"" are quick to leap into action when she's forced to defend her man against some jealous boyscouts who have played with too many GI Joes.

While that may sound a little violent, this is all delivered in the very quirky tongue in cheek style of Wes Anderson movies. This is probably his most accessible work to date. It does not feel too highbrow, and does not come off like it is trying too hard. He has really created a movie that is incredibly hard to define, and the more you try to do so the more all of your efforts seem lacking; he's really made his own genre here, with a nostalgic light-comedy coming of age love story kitchen sink suspense backwoods adventure.

Ultimately I can see some people describing this as a chick flick and others as a guy's movie. Both would be right.",1342828800,,3491,4.472527472527473
5098903,3,B007L6VR6M,"If you saw the trailers, waded through the torrent of PR, and had to put your arm up to shield yourself from the never ending buzz generated for this film, you would be forgiven for thinking it was a zany comedy about kids at camp and the adults around them.  Aside from the ""zany"" part, you'd be technically correct.  Did you like ""The Royal Tennenbaums"" or ""The Life Aquatic""?  If you did, then you're perfectly prepared for what this film has to offer.  If you didn't, then you should think about that before watching this film, because ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is a close sibling to the other two, a trio of painfully shy, slow moving, detail obsessed movies;  It's funny, in parts, but it's a chuckle not a guffaw.

 For almost as long as Hollywood has been associated with movies, Hollywood has had a thing for playing kids as adults, and making their parents out to be childish.  This film takes that premise and makes it pretty much the backbone of the film.  Almost all the kids are more mature acting than any of the adults.  Other than that, it's essentially a story of outsiders among the conformist masses, with love instead of revolution at the center of their co-existence.  (""The Addams Family"" did much the same, but did it better).  It's a story that could be told in the present tense, but they decided to use the sixties and did well enough by it.  Yet, for me, the film didn't deliver..  I liked the ""Royal Tennenbaums"", and ""The Life Aquatic"", but ""Moonrise Kingdom"" didn't seem to make its story interesting enough to make me want to care about the characters.  The title didn't help, ""Moonrise Kingdom"" suggests much more fantasy than the film offered.  Certainly the buzz was overdone, and affected my experience.

Fortunately, you can watch the DVD for a lot less money, without all the in-theater commercials, and you may well find it amusing.  It's not a bad film by any measure, I just don't think it''s nearly as good as the Media  insisted.",1342828800,12,1965,4.627167630057803

5098905,5,B007L6VR6M,"With Wes Anderson, you either buy into his odd, very idiosyncratic and distinctive style, with it's touches of
twisted, surreal fairy-tale tone, and performances that are both restrained on yet not at all naturalistic -
or you don't. For me, I find his style almost always endearing, and both very funny and very touching (The
Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou was the one time it didn't really work for me).

As always the performances here are remarkable from Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Bill Murray (the quintessential
Wes Anderson actor), Francis McDormand and Tilda Swinton as the adults, to two luminous and unique
performances by the film's pre-adolescent lovers Kara Haywood and Jared Gilman.

While imposing a seemingly astringent style, all right angles (almost every cut within a scene is at 90 degrees or
180 degrees to the shot before it), and carefully composed tableaux, this film captures the wonderful, surreal
weirdness of first love (or at least one's childhood fantasy of first love) with a moving and hilarious honesty.

Somehow, while the story of Sam and Suzy's attempt to escape from the insane adult world that surrounds them
has little to do with the realities of day to day life as we know it, it has everything to do with the realities of the
budding heart.

I can't remember when a film so reminded me of my own first fantasies of love and (tasteful but honest) sexuality.
I love when a film makes a tear fall from my eye at the same time I'm laughing, and that's the rare trick Anderson
has accomplished here.",1342396800,2,1537,4.8106060606060606
5098906,5,B007L6VR6M,"This a singular Anderson achievement which outdistances his unique body of prior work both by stepping more out into the real world.  The characters and music merge seamlessly with a plot on the surface humorous and entertaining but on reflection thought provoking as well--one of the few movies I have seen in a long time that I have thought about for a long time afterwards and actually look forward to seeing again.  There are really two movies going on at once.  On first viewing, you see the outward moving by focusing on the story and action of the main players; but behind that, as is true of all Anerson films, there is a literally a background plot most of which is missed unless you ignore what is going on in front in order to see behind.  The movie has its strange points, Suzy with the bloody scissors after fending off the scout attackers and Sam's nonchalant reply that it was either them or us, the lighting hit on Sam near the end, and the chaotic final scenes when the storm hits.  I think one of the most poignant moments is when Willis agrees to adopt Sam to save him from Social Services and before agreeing Sam looks to Suzy for her approval--a look that speaks volumes of the depth of their relationship.  A superb cast all around but in my view Suzy steals the show.  Best move I've seen as long as I can remember.",1342396800,2,1338,4.436734693877551

The child actors in this movie are uniformly terrific, as are all the adults.  The movie looks like a Norman Rockwell painting come to life, but with a twist of Salvador Dali thrown in.  There are laughs aplenty, from the parents who refuse to take their foster child back, to the Khaki Scout troop members who are featured prominently.  Edward Norton deserves lots of praise for his performance as the scout master, but the real star is director and writer, Mr. Anderson.

5098908,5,B007L6VR6M,"Wes Anderson is a true singularity. I suppose I aught to be amazed he manages to get green lights on his projects but I'm glad he does. This film is no exception. It is one of the most wonderfully weird flicks I've ever seen.

Here's the scoop. Sam is an outsider in his scout troop. Suzy is an outsider in her home. The two meet, fall in love, and head for the road. The rest of the troop, the family and the local police band together to find the lovers.

It's difficult to convey how entirely odd this film is. The characters, the sets, the story are all goofy beyond belief. But somehow it not only works, it makes its own sense. And all the actors seemed to get it. They all played their roles to a ""T."" Even Bruce Willis (this is not his usual fare) worked his part and made it happen. Now, to be fair, there were some heavy guns here. Ed Norton, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, to name a few, are all veterans, so that should be a given. But the two kids are first timers and they managed their roles beautifully as well.

The film is gorgeous. The opening doll house-like scenes, with their clean lines and primary colors, made me wonder (until I saw the moving bodies) if I were watching an actual set or some bizarre special effect. The outdoor scenes (this is set on an Island off New Hampshire) were idyllically filmed. I wanted to be there. The music score/sound track was great as well.

There is nothing in this movie I didn't like. It reminded me how versatile the medium can be, and how it can fill an audience with a sense of wonder.

Another very note worthy aspect of 'Moonrise Kingdom' is that the two child stars are the age they play in the film, no early 20's kids pretending to be young.

5098911,5,B007L6VR6M,"Who doesn't remember their first crush, when the first pangs of pre-adolescent loneliness and confusion resolve into the possibility of everlasting happiness? Director Wes Anderson's ""Moonrise Kingdom"" gives us his typically-tilted take on young love. Sam Shakusky (Jared Gilman) plays a scout troop reject who, early in the film, decamps from the spit-and-polish Maine island campsite run by his super-efficient troop leader (Ed Norton). Sam sets off alone, decked in Davy Crockett-style coonskin cap and armed with an air rifle, determined to rendezvous with his true love. The object of his affections, Suzy Bishop (Kara Hayward), is another disaffected 12-year-old who lives in lonely ennui with her doofus attorney parents, (Bill Murray and Frances McDormand) and her three, goofy classical-music-crazed young brothers. Suzy scans the horizon with her binoculars, obviously looking for something, or someone, to take her away from her boredom and problems. Soon, the pair of misfits has joined forces, and set off on a forest adventure while parents, fellow scouts and the island police (Bruce Willis) join in the search.

I'm not usually a big Wes Andersen fan, but I found this film irresistible. Partly, because of the film's sometimes-cloudy plotline. Suzy's parents treat her adolescent poutiness as a sign of emotional disturbance, making them even more distant to her. Sam, too, comes from a tragic beginnings. He is a peculiar and nerdy kid (like an old college prof, he smoke a small corncob pipe filled with god-knows-what) but is essentially harmless. Sam and Suzy Set up camp in an isolated inlet, and express their love in mostly innocent ways - dancing, talking, reading to each other. Soon, we learn that her pursuers have problems of their own. Suzy's parents are having marriage problems, and the adults on the island seems to have settled for lives of quiet desperation. The search for Sam and Suzy is the shakeup that everyone needs to (maybe) shuck off old habits and take a new tack.

Andersen's film, set in 1965 (though with a 1955 mindset) is shot in the pale hues of fade photographs. His signature cutaway houses make an appearance, as does the stilted, mannered acting style he directs onto the cast. He riffs lovingly on scouting and church theater. But what makes this film tolerable (and what was missing from the unbearable ""The Undersea World of Steven Zisou"") is the suffering at the core of the silliness. Suzy, Sam and the gang really are desperate for love. And it's a testament to Andersen's creative heart that he is able to hold the cute humor in check long enough to take their quest seriously.",1341619200,11,2639,5.064367816091954
5098912,5,B007L6VR6M,"Moonrise Kingdom is the magical seventh film by Wes Anderson. It's undeniable that Anderson has carved a niche for himself, making highly evocative films that treat each frame as a canvas and tell the story with a perfect amount of wry humor and minimalism, but I've always had a love/hate relationship with his films. While I always admire his style and the unique vision he brings to every project, out of his previous six films I've loved only three. His skill as a director aside, he's a terrific writer with a great feel for character, a dry sense of humor, and a great penchant for subtlety. My gripes with him only arise when his style completely overrides substance and his film becomes a stylistic exercise in monotony. Thankfully, this is not the case with Moonrise Kingdom, the best film I've seen this year. It's too soon to say (and his greatest admirers may call it heresy), but this may be my favorite Wes Anderson film.

The film takes place in 1965 on an idyllic island called New Penzance. The story centers around two young children, Sam Shakusky and Suzy Bishop (Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward, making their film debuts). Sam is an orphan attending a Khaki Scout summer camp on the island led by Scout Master Ward (Edward Norton). Suzy is staying on the island with her dysfunctional parents Walt and Laura Bishop (Bill Murray and Frances McDormand) and her three young brothers. Both are troubled, awkward social outcasts who met the previous summer and remained pen pals, ultimately agreeing to run away together on the island. This prompts a search posse for the two, led by Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis). As is characteristic of Anderson's work, the adults in the story are just as dyspeptic as the children, if not more so.

For me, Moonrise Kingdom is the summation of the cinematic techniques, stylistic vision, and depth of character that Anderson has honed in his previous films. He doesn't depart far from his formula in Moonrise Kingdom, but he puts all of his strengths on display and produces an adroit work of art that resonates on an emotional and visual level. With a directorial style that's so infused into the DNA of his films you can often identify his work by a single frame. He keeps his work from growing repetitious by expanding on and refining his talents; as a result, this may be his most beautiful film. A cynosure due to his impeccable use of a color palette that is rustic, vivid, and nostalgic, but never garish. He's worked with cinematographer Robert Yeoman since his debut Bottle Rocket and Yeoman's camera work has never more clearly had such a confident grasp on Anderson's visual aesthetic. Every frame looks like a great photograph. It's not only beautiful but atmospheric, particularly in the way it evokes the chimerical 1960s that exists in Anderson's head. Anderson is a master of style and setting, but is even more masterfully adept at using music to complement mood, style, and setting. Both the original compositions and time-specific music are essential to the spell this film casts.

I've never questioned Anderson's ability to create a beautiful cinematic canvas, but what elevates Moonrise Kingdom is the script he co-wrote with Roman Coppola. It has the substance and the beauty necessary to validate the style. With style and substance working together in perfect harmony, he weaves a fairy tale tapestry of magical realism and whimsy that's effortlessly charming and likable. It helps that he never seems preoccupied with things going on outside the realm of his own creations. There's never the impression that anyone else on the island exists except for those directly involved in the mechanics of the plot. Keeping the focus solely on these characters gives them very distinct personalities and attributes. His characters are often quirky, reserved, and poetic, but they never feel rehashed from previous creations. What makes Moonrise Kingdom so heartfelt and poignant is that it's essentially a love story between two pre-teen children and it takes these characters seriously. By treating them with respect rather than as a foil, he captures the innocence and purity of young love in a way that's rarely captured so effectively and beautifully. I imagine he admires the lack of pretense that exists in these children, especially in relation to the story's dysfunctional adults that go through similar trials and reveal themselves as the more nave personalities.

Anderson never falters on casting wrong and he pulls frequently from a troupe of actors well-versed in the rhythm of his films. There are familiar faces here; Jason Schwartzman, and of course Bill Murray, both of whom seem perfectly at home here. Bruce Willis gives one of his best performances in years; a succinct, quiet role that reminds us of his ability to go beyond ""action star"" when given the right material. Norton takes to Anderson's world natural, giving a quirky, alacritous performance as the timid Scout Master. Moonrise Kingdom is very funny, but in the most subtle way, never pining for laughs or acknowledging that something a character has said was supposed to be funny. Anderson really pulls great work from the two newcomers, Gilman and Hayward. They're both the same age as the characters they play and they bring that nave, yet perceptive quality that Hollywood films so often fail to capture by casting grown men and women as young people. The entire cast does great work and fit this grand puzzle perfectly.

Moonrise Kingdom is an astonishing accomplishment that envelops you in its warm symmetry and entrances you in its spell. It's a light, funny, and feel-good film that I can't imagine viewers being able to easily disregard. In the coming months, it'll certainly remain one of the year's best films. It panders to the visual and auditory senses, but plays just as strongly on emotional and thoughtful level. Wes Anderson has really outdone himself as a filmmaker and his latest effort is a work of undeniable beauty and artistry.",1341619200,13,5998,4.97011952191235
5098913,4,B007L6VR6M,"Wes Andersen remains in a place apart as far as contemporary directors are concerned. Last we heard from him, he brought us ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"", a delightful stop-motion movie of all things. Now three years later, Anderson returns with this.

""Moonrise Kingdom"" (94 min.) brings the story of 12 year olds Suzy and Sam, who have run away (she: from home; he: from scouts camp) on an idyllic island in the northeast in the summer of 1965. That is the starting premise of the movie, and to tell more would ruin your viewing pleasure. Several comments and observations: this movie captures a lot of things, but clearly tugs at the hearts of those who grew up in that era, now almost 50 years ago. It was a completely different world, where communication was not instant and not omni-present. In that sense, the movie is very nostalgic indeed. Second, the visuals of the movie are outstanding. Lots of brown and orange are filtered into the scenery, making it look even more idyllic that it already is. Third, the acting here is mostly superb, with lots of juicy performances from Bruce Willis (his best in years), Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, and even Tilda Swinton and Harvey Keitel in short cameos (Swinton as the Social Worker, and Keitel as Commander Pierce).

But the jewel piece in the movie goes to the 12 year old actors, Jared Gilman as Sam and even more so Kara Hayward as Suzie. She is simply amazing. I enjoyed this movie immensely. It is funny, poignant, and whimsical at its very best. I read that this movie was made on a $16 million dollar budget, which is less than 1/10th of many of the current blockbuster movies. It's amazing how much more can be achieved with so much less. If you are in the mood for an outstanding indie movie, ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1341014400,7,1790,4.6613924050632916

Of Wes Anderson's films I would say The Life Aquatic and the Royal Tenenbaums are my favorite. Moonrise Kingdom would be next. I liked the younger cast as they really put a different spin on the story, as even with adult themes they pulled it off with tastefulness. There also is an interesting link between the adults and the children as each of there interactions are mirrored in the others story.

It is a very solid movie, well written and very well directed. Wes is at the top of his game. The soundtrack was also outstanding, as it is in most of his films.

This is a real STORY, with real characters, in which everything that happens is actually possible. What a concept. Told with humor and compassion, the film sweeps you along without the dreaded need for suspension of disbelief. The story is pure Americana - life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Some do it better than others. Not everyone is a winner. Its stars - seven of them! - are all totally out of character. This is not a Bill Murray vehicle or an Edward Norton vehicle or a Bruce Willis vehicle. The stars fit in, almost as afterthoughts. It's the story that counts. Most impressively, it has style. From the opening shots of Susie, face on with her binoculars in various rooms of the house, you know this film will be stylish. And understated. It is worthy of any screen in the world, in a world where American films have become overpoweringly boring and repetitive and entirely predictable. This is the kind of film that France would have originated, and which Americans would have remade into a noxious overkill of action and adventure. It is therefore rare and precious. It will endure long after Transformers XXVII has faded. Kudos to Wes Anderson and team for resisting the urges that every other Hollywood production takes for a granted as a requirement. Bob Balaban as the narrator, making his own appearance in the story, is inspired, as is his framing in the shots. That kind of attention to style gives Moonrise Kingdom the ability to sweep you away.

5098917,5,B007L6VR6M,"This is the Ideal Perfect Summer Movie

The miracle of this movie is that it not only offers a glimpse/reminder of what it was like to be young without idealizing youth (aren't all young people unsatisfied customers) but it also offers a glimpse of what it feels like being old (still an unsatisfied customer). And yet Wes Anderson films suggest (and this one better than any of the others) that we can find comraderie/community and, yes, even love, by simply sharing our dissatisfactions with another.

The island community puts on a play every year about Noah's flood, and in Wes Anderson's version of this Bible story the only way to survive the rising tide of youthful/adult dissatisfaction is in twos.

Moonrise Kingdom has the power of an allegorical fable and the sheer visual delight of a toy store/amusement park fantasyland. No other director is as good at conveying what ails us as humans and yet presenting it in a way that makes us ok with our imperfect status.

An immediate all-time favorite.",1340496000,11,1007,4.837209302325581

5098919,5,B007L6VR6M,"***This review contains spoilers***

I have to admit that I hadn't seen any Wes Anderson films until two or three years ago and Moonrise Kingdom is the first that I have had the pleasure of seeing in the theater.

My first Anderson experience was Bottle Rocket, and it didn't strike me as remarkable the first time I saw it. However, I found myself thinking about it over the next few days and ended up buying the Criterion Blu-ray.

I think there are a couple of important things to understand about Anderson's films:

The first is the level of detail. It's an assault on the brain and I've come to appreciate subsequent viewings more than with most films. Many lesser comedies fall flat because they run out of ideas and end up repeating them until they approach 90 minutes. Anderson's films have so many ideas it's ridiculous, but five of his seven films are also over by the 94-minute mark. The difference is that they are crammed with ideas and feel fresh and original.

The other major thing to note is the brand of humor. Call it offbeat or quirky, or whatever you like, but it's certainly distinctive. It's the type of humor that uses a phrase or situation which is familiar to you, but surprises you by giving it a different meaning. Think of Police Squad, Naked Gun, or Monty Python, and you'll understand what I mean. Like David Lynch, I think Anderson's mind makes unusual connections that most are incapable of. In order to appreciate his films, you need to investigate all of his worlds and understand the way that he thinks. It might be too much work for the casual viewer.

Let's get to Moonrise Kingdom.

The film is set in the 1960s on a small island off New England. It evokes a sense of nostalgia that's present throughout. This is a time in which cell phones and most electronic entertainment didn't exist. Take a look at the primitive record player for example. The story focuses on the budding romance between Sam (Gilman) and Suzy (Hayward). Sam is a scout and invites Suzy to run away with him, causing the small town to send out a search party.

The supporting cast includes some big names and a few Anderson favorites. The local cop is played by Bruce Willis and he's particularly effective in the role. The Scout Master is played by Edward Norton, who has an exaggerated sense of his own importance. He provides a lot of the humor in the few scenes he is in. Look out for the homage to The Shawshank Redemption when he discovers that Sam is missing.

Frances McDormand and Bill Murray play a married couple and both are lawyers. Jason Schwartzman's appearance is brief, but he makes good use of the time. One of my favorite characters is played by Tilda Swinton, and she is simply referred to as Social Services. Even Bob Balaban's narration is funny. It's hard to go into any more detail without ruining the entire plot, such as it is, so I'll stop there.

I mentioned that Anderson's films require several viewings to take in all the details, but I have to say that Moonrise Kingdom had an immediate impact on me. This is my style of humor and it felt like a Coen brothers movie, such as Burn After Reading, at times. Nothing much happens, but it's the style that's important. If you like Anderson's other films, you will almost certainly appreciate this.

I sometimes wonder what kind of childhood Anderson had. Are these characters based on his own experiences? Most are intelligent and suffered something of a troubled upbringing. When I think of Sam, or Max (from Rushmore), am I seeing the way Anderson views his own early life? Dysfunctional families are a favorite topic of his and Moonrise Kingdom is filled with them. Perhaps I had such an immediate connection to the film because it felt familiar after seeing his other work?

I'll close by saying that Anderson's films won't have universal or even large appeal, but if you appreciate his quirky style, you might just end up loving everything he does. I know that's true for me. I'll always remember that I first watched the film on my 50th birthday with two friends I have known since I was 11. That was a great experience and I would like to watch Moonrise Kingdom again right now.

Overall score 4.5/5 (with the potential to rise to 5/5 after repeat viewings).",1340150400,9,4253,4.6172185430463575
5098920,5,B007L6VR6M,"Set in 1965, Moonrise Kingdom is a stylized coming of age film that delivers on its promise to bring the viewer of any age back to the intensity of just-entering-adolescence love. That alone makes this an extraordinary film. In addition, the music and imagery are beautifully orchestrated to delight the senses. The casting, characters, and acting are superb. It is rare to have a film that puts together this much talent and then taps it to the fullest.

Heavy hitters include the brilliant Edward Norton (for once watching his language and holding his temper) as an anal but dedicated troop leader, Bill Murray who in stark contrast to the young stars in this film, fails to find any joy whatsoever in his work in the law profession, wealth, family or beautiful surroundings. His dissatisfied wife (Frances McDormand who was the psychiatrist in Norton's first film Primal Fear), is also an attorney (the lawyer banter are some of the funniest lines in the film). Bruce Willis (who plays very well with child stars as he has a bit of child still left in him) is the bachelor, island cop who goes head-to-head with the chilling Tilda Swinton (white witch from Narnia) known only as ""Social Services,"" as she callously plans to put ""the boy"" in juvenile refuge to undergo shock therapy as needed.

Despite the exceptionally strong adult cast, the two main child stars Sam and Suzy not only keep pace, but outshine the grownups with their unfailing loyalty and unconditional love for each other, both express an unthinking complete giving of themselves to one other. The film captures beautifully in the persons of these two intriguing social outcasts the experience of moving from being trapped in isolation into discovering and developing a union with another. I love how the two of them are so adult and wise in one way and still very much children, with childlike reasoning and priorities, e.g., Suzy runs away and packs a suitcase full of books and her kitten but not a change of clothes.

The cast is rounded out by a boyscout troop with scouts having inappropriately derogatory names as we did in my youth - such as lazy eye for the boy with the eyepatch. Also true to life was how dangerous and unsupervised our childhoods were then. Seeing the boy jump from two story height onto a trampoline without a surrounding net or a single spotter in sight, for example, really brought me back. And interactions with our parents really were pretty much restricted to being called to the table for dinner. I loved seeing Suzy's little brothers (Irish triplets) while away the time with all of the board and other none electronic games, fueled by a couple of dice or imagination.

Wes Anderson spins a simple, sweet story - yet the viewer never knows exactly where it is headed. Throughout, the film is subtly hilarious. In trademark Anderson fashion, the lines are delivered in an almost deadpan way with all the characters completely oblivious to the irony and ridiculousness of the situation, dialog, and even their lives and themselves. I highly recommend purchasing this movie; it's one you'll want to watch again and again and share with other people. I've already seen it four times and it hasn't even opened in theaters in my state, yet.",1340064000,382,3241,4.834234234234234

5098923,4,B007L6VR6M,"It can probably go on record that Wes Anderson has never made a bad film. Certainly some are better than others and everyone is going to have their favorite(s) that they connect to the most (cough ""Rushmore"" cough cough), but his films are always enjoyable. It's hard to believe that ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is Anderson's first live-action film in five years and it may be his most well-rounded and personal film to date.

The film begins with a tour of the Bishop house, which is extraordinary. The camera pans from room to room as you're introduced to what seems like a life-sized dollhouse. The score of the film also enters the picture through Suzy's brother, Lionel's (Jake Ryan), battery operated record player. It's like a narrated introduction to the different types of instruments used in a full orchestra including harps, cellos, flutes, piccolos, electric and acoustic guitars, ukuleles, banjos, woodblocks, organs, and pianos among several other instruments. The score practically encompasses your senses and is very eclectic; the type of score that sticks to you like glue.

One of the first scenes in the film is the ""flew the coop"" scene. Any movie that references ""The Shawshank Redemption"" in its opening moments should already be on your radar of greatness. Anderson is also able to create these magnificent plays within his films. ""Rushmore"" had several and ""Moonrise Kingdom"" has the Noah's Ark play where Sam meets Suzy for the first time. If schools were ever able to put on plays like this regularly, their audience would only expand over time. They're just so creative.

The dancing scene on the beach is perhaps the one that has the most impact. Not only does it provide humor, but it's the first scene that really shows how far Sam and Suzy's relationship has actually escalated. The entire beach scene is just great anyway. It's not often that something of that length can be touching, memorable, and hilarious all at the same time. Only Wes Anderson can pull off something like that.

""Moonrise Kingdom"" has all of Wes Anderson's trademarks including eye-catching cinematography, a fantastic score, intelligent humor, and an incredible cast. Many believe that this is Anderson's best work to date. The comedy-drama is certainly a welcome change of pace during a summer filled with blockbuster action and extravagant special effects. Although Bill Murray throws his shoe at Edward Norton and it's one of the best moments in cinema for the entire year. For once, ""leaving your brain at the door,"" doesn't really apply here. ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is the type of movie that is charming for the soul and makes your brain happy in the process. All in all, it's just a heartfelt and well-written experience that will appeal to everyone.",1339804800,4,2749,5.008752735229759
