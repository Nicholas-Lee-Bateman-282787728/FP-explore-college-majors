8256505,3,B0014VZ0D6,"Made up of several segments from the late '80's In-Fisherman tv series as well as some additional material, this lean, 60 minute video is a good primer for fly fishing for pike. Emphasizing the 3 prong ""Fish Location and Presentation"" system that made In-Fisherman unique, there are concise treatments of each. Seasons are largely overlooked and there is no discussion of differences between spring, summer, and fall locations or tactics. Good instructions on tying a Dahlberg mega diver and how to tie wore bite tippets are presented and some useful material on wind and water temperature was most illuminating. Fishing how-to videos have come a long way since in-fisherman out these out, but the information and action are still helpful and timeless. Worth a watch if you're interested in throwing flies at pike.",1457395200,,814,5.12781954887218
