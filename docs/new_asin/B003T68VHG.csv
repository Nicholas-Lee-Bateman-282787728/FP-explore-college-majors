8404971,4,B003T68VHG,Weird but I enjoyed it. I'm in the process of discovering Szymanowski,1423699200,,69,4.833333333333333
8404972,5,B003T68VHG,"I have owned a recording of this opera for quite a while, as part of my obsession with Entartete Musik and because I love Szyamanowski's music.  Thus I was overjoyed to find it on DVD, and in such a gorgeous production.  For those who might not yet be into the ""secret"", Szymanowski was not only gay but obsessed with homoerotic Mediterranean culture (I bet he knew of Von Gloeden's photographic works, since he had toured Sicily and Sardinia).

And the opera's meaning revolves around this.  The Shepherd is none other than Dionysus, the god of Mysteries and Bacchanalia, portrayed here as stronger than any Christian God.  It is through him that King Roger finds illumination.  Will Hartmann has the looks and the voice of a god.  Scott Hendriks is superb in the title role, Olga Pasichnyk in radiant voice as Roxana.  For those who complain about a static production I'd have to point the real action is in the incredibly multilayered and ecstatic score.  A pleasure to the ear, and to the eye.",1352678400,3,997,4.716763005780347
8404973,5,B003T68VHG,"I do not know Szymanowski's work at all.  However, the music for this opera is hauntingly beautiful.  I found it mesmerizing.  The staging was distracting -- the same set was basically used for all three acts -- a series of white riser platforms.  The staging does not help focus or elucidate the plot at all.  But if you like bald sopranos and all of the soloists covered with blood by the end of the opera you will love the staging.  The singing was beautiful, the orchestra excellent.  The images were clear.  The camera work was not distracting and focussed on the right parts of the stage.  I thought that the sound was fine.  Don't be put off by the staging, listen to what the composer wrote and be astounded.",1325030400,5,716,4.48062015503876
8404974,4,B003T68VHG,"Symanowski (1882-1937) travelled to Sicily and North Africa before the first world War, where he bcame interested in ancient and oriental cultures, that influenced the opera King Roger. While he was in Sicily, he read Sufi poems. A mystical branch of Islam. He them tried to combine the elements of Sufism he had read, with the ancient Greek Philosophy and theater, with the Christian faith. This vision gave rise to a bridge between the West and Eastern views which became King Roger. He was a real figure, Roger the second(1095-1154), who ruled Sicily from 1130. He spoke excellent Arabic and was the centre of the exchange of ideas between the East and West, the Islamic, Byzantine and Catholic Worlds.

The First Act takes place in a  Byzantine Church. The Second Act is set in the Royal Palace,with Oriental decor. The music is of  rapture. The Third act is set in the ruins of Ancient ampitheatre. Whereas the music of the first  two acts uses West and Eastern themes, the third act has no Greek musical ideas. Symanowski was a Romantic and emotion remained central to his music. In this opera, the mysterious Shepherd leaves us to ponder whether he is a false or true prophet. He enters King Rogers kingdom, dedicated to learning and faith. At the beginning the people demand the Shepherds death, then they and the Queen fall under his spell and allow him to lead him to the other world. Only Roger and Edrisi,refuse to be swept away by the general ecstasy.

 The Vienna Symphony is conducted by Mark Elder swiftly. The singers King Roger, Scott Hendricks, Roxana,his wife Olga Pasichnyk, Edrisi,John Graham-Hall and the Shepherd are excellent. So is the rest of the cast and chorus. The lighting catches the spirit of the piece. But the problem is the head of the Bregenz Festival, David Pountney. His direction creates chaos. When you have an opera that should be played regularly in the opera house, in the staging of it, you use pointers, clues as to what is going on. Therefore, instead of having  seats in an Ancient Greek Theatre, as the background for all three acts, you use in the first act, the outline of a Church. In the Second, a few props indicating a palace.  The third Act a few Greek Pillars. Very minimalist. These backdrops can be dropped within a minute, lightening can do the rest. What we really have is a mess. If you wish to gain support from Traditionalists and Modern supporters of opera,this is what one has to do.

Should you obtain it. Yes. Hear Szymanowski's Violin Concerto's 1 &2,on Emi Classics. Excellent. Gets to the heart of this composers art.",1309392000,6,2588,4.733333333333333
8404975,3,B003T68VHG,"To be sincere, I understod more of what happens in this opera from the reading of reviewers than from the opera itself. Eventhough the strange setting suits the strange music, it has no action at all. Everything seems to come from the mind of psycothic people, driven to madness and death. To me, it makes one understand why Opera became a fadding genre in the 20th century. It worths beeing watched in a historycal perspective, that's all",1297728000,2,439,4.714285714285714
8404976,5,B003T68VHG,"Karol Szymanovski has been  systematically forgotten by orchestra directors and public alike. Hs is a great master, it's high time that this injustice be corrected.
King Roger is one of the best operas composed in the 20th Century and this performance does justice to the text and the music. Please don't let this neglect of a masterpiece go on !  Buy this disc, you will be charmed as I was. Don't miss it!

8404977,5,B003T68VHG,"... or Carmen or Aida or - ughh! - Madama Tignola, or any of the perennial melodramas with second-rate music that crowd out new and interesting compositions from the stages of the major opera companies of the USA. The notes for this DVD speak of ""King Roger"" as one of the great 'dark horses' of 20th C opera history, along with Enescu's 'Oedipe' and Nielsen's 'Maskarade', that have been acclaimed by musicians but ignored by the general public. Well, I've heard both the Enescu and the Nielsen, and I thoroughly agree that they are major masterworks which ought to be staged at least as regularly as Lohengrin or Rigoletto. This DVD, however, is my first exposure to Karol Szymanowski's ""King Roger"", filmed at a performance of the Bregenzer Festspiele in 2009. I'd be very loath to give any such daring performance less than a five-star review - lest I be condemned to hear Manon Lescaut in saeculum saeculorum. On the other hand, I can't in good conscience recommend this DVD to anyone but a strenuous devotee to expressionist art.

Actually, the music may well be better than second-rate. It has a tumultuous grandeur. If I listened to it another two or three times, I suspect that it would reveal depths and splendors. Or perhaps hearing it as a choral symphony would focus my attention on its compositional strengths. The problem, for me, is the dramaturgy. The libretto. The stuff that happens on stage and is intended to engage my emotions. Frankly, as a drama, King Roger is pretentious symboliste drivel, a quality that this Bregenzer staging exaggerates in every manner possible. The stage is a bare set of steps, like empty bleachers overlooking a stunned orchestra. The story concerns an abstract monarch in an abstract kingdom, whose subjects are clamoring for him to apprehend a heretic. The heretic, an abstract shepherd, turns out to be a charismatic witness to an abstract God. King Roger, like Pontius Pilate, is both contemptuous and overawed, while his wife Roxana is 'seduced' by the Shepherd's message. Eventually, the Shepherd and the Queen flee together. That's Act One. In the second act, Roger becomes a pilgrim in pursuit of his wife and perhaps of his sanity. He finds Roxana, as this production shows it, in a bizarre land of blood sacrifices. Yet just when it seems that the Shepherd is apocalyptically triumphant, the Sun rises and Roger is 'restored'. Huh? was it a dream? Nah, that's too easy! A religious epiphany? Frankly, I don't hear such a message in the music, which churns on in anguish and atonal anomie.

This staging is mercilessly static. The singing is quite good, but the sound recording is atrocious, as if done with a single mike on the yonder side of the orchestra pit, so that major vocal expressions sound 'back stage' arbitrarily. If the vocal lines were 'present' and full of timbres, the music might well carry the show. What I see and hear strikes me as a missed opportunity to make a case for this neglected opera. But I'm a 'hard sell' for meta-religious expressionism. If you, dear reader, know the films of Lars von Trier -- ""Breaking the Wave"" for example -- and like them, there's some possibility that you'll appreciate this film of ""King Roger"".",1284940800,25,3210,4.834545454545455
