8592734,5,B000SIHX36,"Almost as funny as it's counterpart ""Am I Normal? A Film About Male Puberty."" This one follows around a young girl during her troubled preteen days. Well, again, I was forced to watch this in sex ed at my school. Again, I'm glad they made us, though this isn't quite as funny as it's counterpart. Maybe it's because there is just less to laugh at when it comes to girls and puberty. Maybe the acting is just getting, dare I say it, better. Maybe they were trying to be funny in the other film. Whatever the reason, it's still worth finding and watching. This poor attempt at educating teenagers about puberty is just so hilarious to watch, you have to go get it now and see it.",1304035200,2,677,4.338582677165355
