2870556,5,B000RO6K7G,"Our son loves the tv show so we tried the books.  He enjoys seeing the characters in book format and is quick to rattle off their names.  Its the association between seeing them on TV and then in a book that excites him most.  At less than 2 years of age, its become his favorite story collection (we own several others too).",1214611200,,325,4.209677419354839
2870557,5,B000RO6K7G,"MY GRANDSON IS IN LOVE WITH DAVID KIRK'S MISS SPIDER AND ALL OF HER BUGGY BEST BUDDIES.  THIS WAS THE VERY FIRST MISS SPIDER DVD THAT WE GOT.  I WOULD ACTUALLY RECOMMEND AS YOUR FIRST, THE ORIGINAL SUNNY PATCH FRIENDS.  THE VERY FIRST DVD PUT THE STORY INTO PLACE.  THE MARRIAGE TO HOLLY, SPIDARIS THE SPIDER'S JEALOUSY AND THE BIRTH OF THE 5 BUGS AND ADOPTION OF THE OTHER 3.  OUR FAMILY OWNS ALL OF THE DVD'S CURRENTLY AVAILABLE AND AM WAITING FOR THE NEXT RELEASES.  MY GRANDSON IS JUST 24 MONTHS AND WATCHES LIMITED TV AND DVD'S BUT ANYTHING MISS SPIDER WE MAKE AN EXCEPTION.  EACH TALE IN DVD TELLS A STORY AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF MISTAKES.  MY GRANDSON IS ALWAYS ASKING 'WHAT HAPPENED' AND I GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO TELL HIM WHAT IS RIGHT AND WHAT IS WRONG.  THANK YOU DAVID KIRK AND ALL OF THE BUG BUDDIES.",1211155200,,811,4.3533333333333335

8201643,5,B000RO6K7G,"Great movie for kids with vision impairments!

We purchased this Little Spider Sunny Patch Friends Bug-a-Boo Day Play movie for our 11-year-old disabled daughter with vision issues. Delivered super-fast as always, thank you Amazon! This movie keeps her attention for hours. The characters are big and have bright colors. The quality of this DVD looks amazing on our HDTV!

Currently, it's her favorite DVD to watch. It features 8 stories that run for a total time of 93 minutes. You can pick a favorite story or play all stories back to back. It doesn't automatically play, like some kid DVDs, you do have to hit play with the remote or on the DVD.

You can look up Miss Spider on YouTube to see if this DVD will gather your child's attention. The quality of this DVD is so much better than YouTube and is convenient to have, so you can use without the internet. This DVD is a bargain and I can't wait to get more of these Miss Spider movies to add to our collection :-).

8201648,5,B000RO6K7G,"This is probably my kids favorite Miss Spider DVD and that is saying a lot.  Both my 3-year old daughter and 6-year old son love it.  Fun stories, good messages, and a little spooky, but not too scary.  I enjoy these DVDs because I think they have good messages for kids on how to interact with siblings, adults and friends, on consequences of good and bad actions, and family.  Kid adored, mom approved.",1232928000,2,404,4.493150684931507
