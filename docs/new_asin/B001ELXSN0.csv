8298792,5,B001ELXSN0,"A particularly hot-blooded version of ""The Tempest"" ""Sombre Verde"" stars Hollywood's Ricardo Montalban (muy guapo) as a scientist scouring the Vera Cruz jungles for sources of the miracle drug, cortisone.  A rather thrilling jungle adventure is only the prelude to the revelation of paradisiacal compound at the edge of a plunging waterfall, where a crazed loner and his nubile daughter rule.  She's a feral sexpot, and more than a little cr..cr..crazy, adding a dangerous and unpredictable edge to the classic plot.  Shot on location in breathtaking locales, ""Sombre Verde"" was judged ""never boring"" by my entire family. In Spanish with English subtitles.",1265155200,4,656,5.411764705882353
