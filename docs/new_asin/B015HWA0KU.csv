8733637,5,B015HWA0KU,"Who says you are not lucky?  You're lucky that these gems have stayed with us.
I was going to say that these collections just get better and better as they come out.  That's not true.  They are all excellent.
Get this if you love silent comedy.
Get this if you like to laugh!!  It will make you do that.  More please!",1443225600,,317,4.131147540983607
8733638,5,B015HWA0KU,"It's a real privilege to be able to view these silent films, which, were it not for the proliferation of 16mm rental libraries, would most likely have been lost to the ravages of time. Each one of them is a gem, and many feature talented comedians at the height of their prowess. This is the third DVD in a wonderful series that has captured silent comedies from the brink of destruction. These are professional productions, with top-notch visual restorations and carefully crafted scores. I'm already looking forward to Volume 4...",1443225600,2,532,4.9222222222222225

8733641,5,B015HWA0KU,"Can't get enough of this series. More rare shorts presented in the best possible way with the wonderful Ben tinkling on the ivories (well, probably bits of plastic if the truth be told) but if you love silent comedy you'll love this!  Can't wait for the next Accident.....",1443225600,2,272,4.666666666666667
8733642,5,B015HWA0KU,"Once again, Accidentally Preserved present very rare gems of the silent era. Very funny subjects with, as usual, excellent new music by Ben Model, and beloved comedians such as Jack Duffy, Charlotte Merriam, Anne Cornwall or Bobby Ray (who teamed with Babe Hardy before Stan).
Recommended.",1443225600,,289,5.304347826086956
8733643,5,B015HWA0KU,"Good news for silent comedy buffs! Theres a new installment of Accidentally Preserved, brought to you by Ben Model and the folks at Undercrank Productions. This DVD series offers very rare comedies (along with the odd cartoon or industrial short) which survive today only because they were made available, long ago, for home use in the 16mm format. Now held by collectors, these prints often represent the only known copies to be found anywhere. Mr. Model, a renowned silent movie accompanist, presents these offbeat rarities with his dynamic scores, along with introductory notes by film buff extraordinaire Steve Massa, who provides useful background information on each shorts personnel, production history, and related matters. This series has been a real treat for fans. For those of us who are middle-aged, opening up a new disc of Accidentally Preserved selections is like a flashback to the 70s, when a package of brand new prints would arrive in the mail from Blackhawk. (Only nowadays we don't have to thread any projectors.)

Volume 3 is another goody basket of rarities. I have several favorites in this set, especially Joe Rocks THE WHIRLWIND (1922), a delightfully surreal, dreamlike comedy thats surprisingly elaborate. The star of WHOSE BABY? (1929) is Arthur Dagwood Lake, who is quite engaging as a well-meaning young fellow trapped into tending the baby of a busy shopper. Its always a pleasure to see Mr. & Mrs. Sidney Drew, who were so adept with marital comedy. In WANTED, A NURSE (1915), Mr. Drew fakes illness so that he can make time with a pretty nurseplayed, of course, by Mrs. Drew. I would bet this premise was already familiar to audiences a century ago, but the Drews always manage to find humor in every situation. Only the second reel of HALF A HERO (1929/30) was available for preservation. This short was shot silent but dubbed with music, sound effects, and a few lines of dialog, and is thus the only selection for which Mr. Model did not supply a score. It features famed midget actor Billy Barty, approximately 5 years old and plenty lively. HALF A HERO concludes the set on a suitably wacky note.

But Id be remiss if I neglected to mention A CITRATE SPECIAL, the shortest but easily the most memorable selection on the disc. This film, possibly made as a prank for screenings at parties, must be seen to be believed. Our lead player is character actor Thurston Hall, familiar from his many appearances as politicians, military officers, and other dignified authority figures . . . but after seeing him in this, I can never regard him quite the same way again. Beyond that, Ill say only that if you thought scatological humor was introduced to the screen in BLAZING SADDLES, this short will be most enlightening.

At the risk of echoing what everyone else has been saying about this series, I salute Mr. Model and his team for their heroic efforts to share these rare films with the public. And I, too, look forward to the next volume!",1442448000,4,2975,4.840864440078586
