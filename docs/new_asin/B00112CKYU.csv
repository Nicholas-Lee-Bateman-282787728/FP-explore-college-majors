8239872,3,B00112CKYU,"Remember Yakov Smirnoff? Well, with this DVD you can! This brief performance captures the essence of his comedy routine, and I'm sure that a variant still plays well today at his ""What a Country Theater"" in Branson, Missouri (""He is the funniest Russian comedian in Branson, MO!"" claims an ad at the end of the film, exhorting you to call 1-717-33-NO-KGB for information....) The truth be told there are several funny moments in this show, though the effectiveness of much of the humor has decreased over time in the post-USSR world, to the point that many if not most younger viewers won't get it at all (""Americans have things that we didn't have in Russia...like warning shots."")

The show is occasionally tedious and quite predictable, but with little comedic moments that are enjoyable. I could have done without the home movies segments (seriously,) but I admire his willingness to do a candid question and answer session at the end with the audience, which he handles well. While much of this is corny, I genuinely do admire his patriotism and especially his work after the 9/11 attacks. While some of his contentions seem a bit weird (claiming that Oregon is a very conservative state,) he comes across as a genuinely nice guy. If you don't mind wincing at the occasional joke and are open-minded enough to watch this for the humor that does shine through, this is worth watching once if the price is reasonable",1341532800,2,1419,4.815573770491803
