6120380,4,B00GWJIDB6,"This show was an always watch program for our family on Sunday nights. I was quite surprised when season one was released on dvd and equally as surprised to see season two released on dvd. As has been pointed out before, neither season has been digitally remastered but rather seems to be some very nice film transfers. The quality of these episodes is still quite nice with very vibrant colors and decent audio quality. I guess you could say the shows look about like they did when they were originally aired. I have no problem with that. All in all, I'm quite pleased to own both seasons of this series. I don't think I've seen them since their original broadcasts. Thank you CBS Home Video for releasing this series!",1398556800,3,719,4.5813953488372094
6120381,1,B00GWJIDB6,Review.  I did not receive Gentle Ben 2. I received another dvd which was supposed to go to a lady in New York State. I shipped it to her at my expense so at least one of us would get what they ordered. If you review my account you will find that I buy a lot of things through Amazon- This is the first complete failure that I have had . Therefore the bad report.,1395619200,2,363,3.84

6120388,5,B00GWJIDB6,"""Gentle Ben"" is by far one of the very best TV shows that's ever been made.
It's such an exciting, adventurous, unique, underrated and marvelous TV series and it has such beautiful scenery too.

Dennis Weaver was perfect in the role of the Florida Everglades Wildlife Officer named Tom Wedloe.
Beth Brickell was perfect in the role of Ellen Wedloe.
Clint Howard was perfect in the role of Mark Wedloe.

In this television series, Clint Howard's character had a lovable and tame black bear named Ben as a pet.

Such a large variety of animals are seen in both seasons of this classic television series.

All 28 episodes from Season Two are presented in uncut and unedited form on this 4-disc set.
All 28 episodes from Season Two have running times of over 25 minutes each on this DVD release.

The second season of this classic TV Series originally aired on CBS from September 29, 1968 until April 27, 1969.

The video quality is good and the audio quality is good too.

The packaging that CBS/Paramount used for Gentle Ben: Season Two is perfect.
Season Two is stored in a plastic DVD case that holds all four discs.
None of the discs share the same side of any of the disc holding trays and none of the discs overlap any of the discs either.

Notable guest stars from Season 2 were Bart Starr of the Green Bay Packers, Albert Salmi, Chester Morris,
Douglas Fowley, Lou Antonio, Malcolm Atterbury, Michael Burns, Ron Howard and Victor French.",1428969600,5,1442,4.627450980392157
