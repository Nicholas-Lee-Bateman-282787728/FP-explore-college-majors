4885657,5,B005SIMGRO,"In the grand scheme of things, there is probably nothing less important in life than a Major League Baseball Game. It is entertainment much like a movie or a stage play. Certainly it is important to the team owners and others tied in to the daily operations who rely on profits from ticket sales and concessions. It is also important to the players themselves who spent their entire lives training for a career in the sport.

  The treatment that Steve Bartman recieved from the crowd that night was despicable, disgusting, and totally inexcusable. This poor innocent person had his very existence turned into a nightmare over a simple twist of fate.  Other fans had their hands out to catch the ball hit by Luis Castillo but by luck it bounced off Steve Bartman's hands.  The actions of the network sportscasters as well as the post game commentators only sought the feed the anger already felt by the fans.  What was not shown in the network broadcast of the movie (and should have been) was a statistical depicition of just what type of impact Steve Bartman's actions actually had on the game which was almost nonexistant in comparison to the subsequent mistakes made by the Chicago Cubs themselves. This was in the ""Extras"" portion of the DVD.

  Alex Gibney managed to do what should have been done by the TV networks long ago and that was to exhonerate Steve Bartman. As he has kept to himself and gone about his life and accepted no money or offers for appearances, Steve Bartman in the long run has shown himself to be a truly class act in comparrison to his fellow Cubs fans.  Catching Hell is a movie which has to be seen to be believed. Just when we think that we have advanced as a culture we realize that the farther we think we've come, the furthur we seemed to have regressed. It makes us reevaluate what is important to us in life both collectively and as individuals.",1409788800,3,1884,4.580357142857143

4885660,5,B005SIMGRO,"I am a huge baseball fan and I must say I enjoyed this film. This documentary goes into great detail describing the events that surround the Steve Bartman incident. It also does a great job explaining baseball curses and the important role they play in baseball. There are parts of this movie that were hard to watch. The blame that Bartman received and the treatment by other fans was heartwrenching. This movie his a must for any baseball fan and it gives you a lot to think about. ESPN did a great job putting it together and you get a good balanced view of the situation. You can see why Bartman gets so much blame, and you can also see why it may be overblown.

I have watched this documentary a couple times and everytime I learn something new. I would highly recommend it.",1385078400,,779,4.409722222222222
4885661,4,B005SIMGRO,"As other reviewers have noted, this is a truly great film, and it covers the Saint Steve Bartman story exhaustively. I realize ESPN probably requested a specific running time to fill a 2-hour (w/commercials) time slot, and that is why it runs as long as it does. The amount of time devoted to the 1986 Bill Buckner story as a point of comparison is a little much, although Buckner does come across really well in his interviews. The line is crossed, however, when a unitarian minister is interviewed about a sermon on ""Steve Bartman as Scapegoat"": this is absurd. But as with everyone else who has pursued this story has found out, there remains one final enigma:

Why does Steve Bartman refuse to talk? Is he a) resigned to wallowing in self-pity for the rest of his life, or b) completely convinced he will be killed by a drunken Cubs fan seeking revenge? By refusing to talk or make any appearances, he has only created a Salinger-esque mystique around himself that makes the story just that much more of a journalist's holy grail. If he had only made the rounds on the talk shows and showed everybody he's just a regular guy who made a blunder rather than evil incarnate, this story would be FORGOTTEN by now. Instead, he willingly chooses to live his life with an alternate identity and a legal team. By avoiding celebrity, he has become a celebrity.",1383782400,,1355,4.622406639004149
4885662,5,B005SIMGRO,"Incredible true story of how normal people can turn on individuals over something as inconsequencial as sports!!!  What happened to Steve Bartman is inexcusable!!!  A classic line is this DVD went something like this - ""Its not a question about whether Chicago will ever forgive Steve Bartman......the real question is will Steve Bartman ever forgive Chicago!!""

about human behavior, mob behavior if you will.  My 15 year old daughter  who is not a big sports fan

4885667,5,B005SIMGRO,"What a fascinating, if sometimes frightening and unnerving, journey into the darker side of sports fanaticism this film is, via an innocent, isolated incident that incurred the wrath of nearly an entire fan base - never mind the fact that it could have happened to any one member of that fan base.

Wrigley Field has affectionately, if cloyingly, been called the ""Friendly Confines"" since the days when Jack Brickhouse manned the broadcast booth and called games for the Chicago Cubs on radio and television, but this film almost makes one think twice about attending a baseball game within its ivy-covered walls. The uneasy realization that perfect storm circumstances can suddenly turn inhabitants of packed stands into an angry mob, as shown in network and home video in this presentation, shakes one to the core. This engrossing film explores all aspects of the infamous Steve Bartman incident, which took place during Game Six of the 2003 NLCS, when the Cubs were six outs away from defeating the then-Florida Marlins and advancing to a coveted World Series berth for the first time in several generations of long-suffering Wrigley faithful. Interviews with fans, writers, TV announcers, Wrigley Field security personnel, and players from both sides enrich this exploration of the collective psyche of sports fanatics gone ballistic.

The inclusion of a Boston Red Sox correlative appears to have provided a bone of contention among some Amazon reviewers. I can say that, despite the overabundance of Red Sox-oriented drivel that's most certainly circulating out there, this film actually benefits from the addition of a shared Boston perspective. The similarities in the ways Bartman and 1986 Boston first baseman Bill Buckner became whipping boys for the fans from their respective ""nations"" (Bartman being a Cub fan) are undeniable. It makes perfect sense to include the Sox side-story: both Buckner and Bartman were unfairly singled out for the failure of a team to close the deal in a game six. Both were unfairly branded and chastised as embodiments of imagined curses which were supposedly cast upon these storied franchises, purportedly causing each of them to go without winning a championship in several decades (in the case of the Cubs, more than a lifetime).

Most folks forget that the damage had already been done prior to the Buckner incident, that the game was in fact already tied thanks to a series of Mets singles and a wild pitch. And Mookie Wilson attests that he would have beaten the aged, bad-kneed Buckner (a former Cub, by the way) to first base even if Buckner had fielded the ball cleanly. Video of the play bears him out. Similarly, Bartman had little to do with the Cubs' group implosion of October `03, all of which happened on the field in most dramatic fashion, including a costly infield error and, also mirroring the Boston collapse, a wild pitch. And can we really assume that left fielder Moises Alou would have caught that foul ball if Bartman hadn't touched it? As in life, there are no guarantees in baseball, and stranger things have happened in this venerable old game than a semi-competent fielder not making what may or may not have been a sure catch. Who would have been the scapegoat then?

If anything, the Buckner correlation makes ""Catching Hell"" interesting to a wider audience than just Cub fans, who by the way should be thankful to Mr. Gibney for this; if the content were limited solely to the carryings-on of Cubbies loyalists, the ugliness of sports fans at their absolute worst would be associated only with them in this film. They would, in fact, be more likely to become scapegoats of sports fandom in general, much like Bartman became their scapegoat for Cubs futility. Thanks to the added Boston angle in this film, the darkness that envelops bitter fans' hearts is spread around a little.",1350950400,9,3855,4.9813664596273295
4885668,5,B005SIMGRO,"If you're a baseball fan this is a MUST SEE movie (like the equally excellent ""Moneyball""). It is also one of my top 5 movies of 2011 --along with ""Moneyball"".
 Alex Gibney may be America's top documentary film-maker & his talent is on full diplay in this fascinating look at 2 recent ""goats"" in American sports. Bill Buckner's infamous gaffe in the World Series is explored here along with the target that was painted on Steve Bartman's chest by various entities when he may or may not have cost the Cubbies their 1st WS appearance in decades.
 Buckner speaks very movingly about what he & his family have gone through since his error. Your admiration for him can't help but to grow as you listen & watch him talk. (I've been a Buckner fan since his days with the Dodgers).
 Buckner made himself available to Gibney, but Bartman didn't. This makes Gibney's exlporation what happened that night in Wrigley much more difficult to tell. However Bartman's personal absence is treated as perhaps a smart move by him & makes him an even more fascinating character -- a J.D. Salinger of baseball lore if you will. The flight of that fated foul ball is given all the study of a police shooting review (I'm tempted to compare the attention given to the Zapruder film but I don't want to compare a baseball game to a presidential asassination.) Some people may find all this analysis a bit much, but it allows for other players to emerge for better & for worse. Bartman comes off as a really good guy & every bit an enigma.
 The extras on the DVD are well worth checking out as well.",1331510400,,1574,4.53169014084507
4885669,4,B005SIMGRO,"The oft-delayed ""lost chapter"" of ESPN's 30 for 30 series, this strives to be more than just a routine examination of the infamous Steve Bartman incident that may (or may not) have cost the Chicago Cubs a shot at the 2003 World Series. With the famously publicity-shy Bartman refusing to take part, the film instead leans on interviews with several of the fans to rub elbows with him that fateful evening and insightful confessionals from the announce crew that called the game, a good portion of the Cubs' starting lineup, the local news team that outed Bartman's identity to the public and several of the security guards that escorted him to safety as the situation escalated. Director Alex Gibney deserves credit for not only painting a broad, fair portrait of a chaotic, emotionally charged situation, but for rightly comparing it to other instances of misplaced blame and shameless scapegoating in pro sports and asking the difficult question of what exactly spins a knee-jerk reaction into a bonafide vendetta. Though the scrutiny of the Bartman play itself is a bit too intense at times, resulting in a run-time that's about 30 minutes too long, it accomplishes much more than a simple reenactment and should leave any serious sports fan wondering how many times they've reacted with the same brainless mob mentality over the years. Smart, challenging and honest; it's what any good documentary should strive to be.",1326240000,6,1422,5.029661016949152
4885670,4,B005SIMGRO,"...and never boring.  A must for baseball fans.  Not only Cubs fans, but there's some great coverage of Bill Buckner and the 86 fiasco.  Really worth watching!",1324166400,,159,4.814814814814815
4885671,3,B005SIMGRO,"The subject of this film is fascinating. For those who can't find it on ESPN (especially Cub fans) this film is a must see. The filmmaker, however, missed a great chance to make a remarkable film. His inclusion of the Red Sox 1986 disaster is understandable but takes precious time away from the film that could have been used to get other ""Cub"" viewpoints. I do appreciate the interviews of people involved which provides great insight into that night. Just wish it would have been more ""Cub-centric""",1318032000,,501,4.7701149425287355
4885672,5,B005SIMGRO,"I am a Boston Red Sox fan so I can understand how the Cubs fans felt back then. This documentary I thought, was well presented and the entire premise lies around how Steve Bartman become the scapegoat for the Chicago Cubs when they lost that NLCS series. Since the fans cannot cussed out their favorite players on the team, they found someone they can and that someone was Steve Bartman.

I found the documentary interesting because it shows how in one unthinking instinctive moment, one life was totally ruined in a baseball game. It was made worst thanks to the media who kept hyping it up and emotional Cubs fans who needed someone to blame beside their beloved Cubs. That is amazing. It is totally amazing as the documentary shows that Steve Bartman took every Cubs player and their coaches off the hook for their terrible failure to win that series at home. You would think that they owed Steve Bartman a vote of thanks for taking all the heat off their back!! The documentary skillfully used the scapegoat analogy but it was more then that. Bartman was clearly the whipping boy for Cubs' failure. He took the lash for every one of the Cubs mistakes, failures and strikeouts of that series after that incident. Every hit Kerry Wood gave up in the seventh game was Bartman's fault. Every hit the Marlin had was Bartman's fault. Every time a Cub player strike out or grounded out, it was Bartman's fault. Lashes were coming down hard on that poor guy's back while the Cubs players got off scot free.

Sad thing was as the documentary clearly show, Bartman was doing what anyone of us would have done if we were there at that spot.

I thought the documentary making comparsion with the fate of Bill Buckner was very proper. Buckner was the scapegoat, the whipping boy for the Red Sox fans and media for that one monumental error in the World Series. The major difference was, Buckner was a professional, he was paid good money to make that play and failed so what he got, no matter how unjust it was, came with the territory while Bartman was just a fan who flatlined it for a brief moment of his life and that cost him.

Maybe it was the curse of the Billy Goat that took control of Bartman that night. I am sure it the Curse of the Bambino that forced the error by Buckner. As a Red Sox fan and a minority on this, I did not blame Buckner even although I was teased for the next 18 years with ""between the legs"" jokes. What human can fight a curse, eh? But Buckner wasn't forgiven until the Red Sox won the World Series...twice!! Chances are, Mr. Bartman may remain infamous to many die-hard Cubs fans until they do the same, at least making it to the World Series should count!! Then maybe they may let Mr. Bartman throw out the first pitch or something. Maybe panda bears might learn how to fly too, eh?

Excellent documentary that need to be view by every single baseball fan out there. It is also an interesting study on how quickly you can be cut out of the herd and laid out for sacrifice by the mob.",1317772800,11,3010,4.425992779783393
4885673,5,B005SIMGRO,"I watched Catching Hell a couple of nights ago and I saw just how much of our humanity we lost. I felt a massive chill run up and down my spine and a wave of horror all over my face as I heard every ominous detail of what went down on that fateful day and witnessed just how low the human race sank. Steve Bartman did not mean to cost the Chicago Cubs a chance to go to the World Series by reaching out and catching that foul ball that Moises Alou was about to make a grab for. This particular fan was probably so excited about catching the ball that he didn't realize that he was interfering with a possible game winning catch. But the way the fans reacted to his mistake just proved to me that we, as a species, HAVEN'T LEARNED A DAMN THING AT ALL in this evil world we live in. This poor man didn't really mean to hurt his team this way and he must have felt horrible when he realised what he had done, but the fans in the stands and outside Wrigley Field looked at him as if he was Osama Bin Laden  The desire for retribution they showed chilled me to the core as I could see on their faces that they wanted to CRUCIFY this guy for what he did. These people obviously lost their minds. It was just a foul ball that he reached out for and nothing else. He was pelted with debris while being escorted outside and people kept on abusing him. He later apologized for his mistake and begged for forgiveness;however, it mostly fell on deaf ears, at least amongst the fans that night.  I understand that he received numerous death threats following this incident and the isolation he's feeling to this day must be unbearable, and I wonder if he can ever have a normal life again. We've all made foolish mistakes in our lives but Steve Bartman DID NOT deserve the living hell that those animals put him through that night. What an absolute disgrace that was, the darker side of our humanity has reduced us to behaving like savages and we have the nerve to wonder why our species is in so much trouble today. I hope God can forgive us all for our stupidity though I feel we don't deserve it.",1317254400,5,2086,4.225563909774436
4885674,3,B005SIMGRO,"""Catching Hell"" is a mixed bag for Cub fans.  It's told from the director's perspective and he is also the narrator/writer.  Trouble is,  the director makes a lot of the film about his view of things as a Red Sox fan.  Cub fans don't care about this.  The documentary starts with ten minutes of stuff about Bill Buckner blowing the Sox 86 series against the Mets.  Later the director returns to this theme and tries to tie it to Bartman by calling both men scapegoats and going at it from that angle.  That structure is artificial and not necessary and seems like a stretch.  Maybe Buckner can be compared to Alex Gonzalez of the Cubs,  but not to a guy in the stands.  Makes no sense.
  On the plus side, the movie does a good job of tracking down and interviewing key players in the Bartman situation.  People sitting near him, reporters nearby,  Moises Alou, security guards,  etc.  Even a jerk fan who admits he was thrown out of that game and others.  Why that fan isn't asked if he wants to apologize for going after Bartman is not clear.
  The film also does a nice job with effects,  like showing that Alou would have caught the ball, showing how others reacted and where they were sitting.
  Back on the down side, there are no interviews with Steve Stone or Pat Hughes, the Cubs radio team that would have the best perspective on why fans would focus on Bartman.  No Stone or Hughes is a major miss.  No Alex Gonzalez or Mark Prior interviews.
  And there's a lot of video used of a guy at the game speaking about it on camera as things unfold.  Who was this guy?
  Some other junk should have been taken out like a Howard Stern fan calling a show pretending to be Bartman.  Who cares?  And Will Ferrell doing a Harry Caray impersonation.
  Also way too much of Steve Lyons and Eric Karros.  These are not people who have Cub history to have the best sense of the situation.  No Ernie, Billy, Ronnie,  Fergie.  They could have explained how years of frustration came to this.
  The filmmaker needed to go into Chicago neighborhoods ...bars and hot dog joints to find out how the city really felt about this incident.  You don't really get the sense of Chicago here, just national people who are disconnected from Chicago and wanted to tell this story.
  Also,  the director being interviewed and narrating is all wrong. He's too Boston and it needed a Chicago voice, both literally and figuratively.  You get the impression this filmmaker likes the spotlight and that doesn't work.
  Overall, a mixed bag that needed a tighter focus.",1317081600,6,2543,4.514348785871965
8485144,5,B005SIMGRO,"Saw this movie on cable and the whole scapegoat theme struck a chord with me.  The guy is just an ordinary fan who tried to catch a foul ball, just like everyone else sitting near him.  For that, he was forced to go into hiding for the rest of his life -- hated by an entire city who needed someone to blame.  This film is not so much about what happened to this particular fan but is more about the human (or inhumane) condition.
