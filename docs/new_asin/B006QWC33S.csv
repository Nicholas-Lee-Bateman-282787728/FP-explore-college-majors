5014214,5,B006QWC33S,"I love movies that my whole family can enjoy together. The movie is based on a true story which had my kids heads reeling ""what? they sent two dogs into space?"" I was explaining to the kids that 50 years ago two dogs went into space, returned safely, the girl Strelka eventually gave birth to puppies, with one of the puppies sent to President John F. Kennedy's daughter Caroline Kennedy and are now stuffed in the  Cosmonaut Museum in Moscow.

All this information made them even more interested in the movie. We all truly loved the story of these animal friends and their sweet faces as they worked together. Personally, I am a sucker for good CGI, this was a really great CGI movie.

Great characters, great songs, great movie! Some really funny parts and some very heartwarming moments.",1333670400,7,790,4.669064748201439

The first dogs that were sent into space: Belka and Strelka. Beautifully made, great songs, great characters and a beautiful happy end.

5014383,3,B006QWC33S,"Space Dogs follows suit in a long line of computer animated feature films that tell of earthen critters being sent into space prior to mankinds own journey to the stars (check out Space Chimps or Fly Me To The Moon for further examples in the genre).  While all of the above films claim to be based on some degree of historical fact, Space Dogs represents the first animals to have survived a Soviet launched orbital space trip; particularly from the fictional perspective of real-life canines Belka & Strelka.

If you're very familiar with contemporary CG film catalog, it could best be described as a cross between Sonys Open Season 2 and Starz Space Chimps.  If that means nothing to you, read on for a more in depth breakdown of the film on its own merits.

Released in Russia back in March of 2010 as    (Belka n Strelka), the film wears a G-rating, comes in a run-time of 85-minutes and was created on a budget of roughly $35-million.  Phase 4 Films gave it the English dub treatment, burned it to Region 1 standards and released it to DVD and blu-Ray as Space Dogs a couple of years later (June 10, 2012).

The story, which is far more simplistic in summation than its 85 min-run-time demands, tells of a stray and a circus dog who are in essence kidnapped into military service, which begins with rigorous training for what will be controlled space flight.  Since, at its core, the story could probably be told in about three to five minutes, what you really get is quite a bit of fictional back story in attempt at character building among the many talking animals involved in the tale.

Additionally, the films pacing seems a tad askew as a result: the vast majority of the tale centers on the dogs training with only a couple of minutes dedicated to the space flight itself (and even then its a bit curious in terms of the Belka & Strelka repairing the original Sputnik with a flashlight battery or Strelka suddenly taking control of the ship, flying it through an asteroid belt and so on).  Perhaps Im being overly critical concerning elements that were surely added for the visual enjoyment of children.  History buffs, youve been warned.

The films visuals are also a bit lackluster for what was possible by 2010 in terms of computer generated animation.  The animal models themselves are certainly passable enough but the textures throughout are simplistic and drab, and the animation rather stiff.  The human models seem to represent the production crews biggest challenge and are thus absent almost entirely throughout the picture (though it is only fair to mention that a brief appearance of JFK in the beginning both looks and sounds great).

Of course all of this criticizing surely makes the film come off as unwatchable and in truth, it does many things well deserving of mention.  For starters, the dub is surprisingly solid.  For a film not originally created in English, Phase 4 did a bang up job adapting the mouth flaps to the sentences of the new script.  This is more than just a timing accomplishment; as making a coherent film is more than just having words and mouth flaps match, credit is due in designing a script that manages to tell the story accordingly, keep the flow of conversation natural and so on.  Space Dogs certainly succeeds here.

Additionally, while kids young enough to get the most out of the films gags will likely care little for the fact that the story is based on some semblance of history, the actual footage of the dogs (and even rodents) involved in the spaceflight during the closing credits is certainly a nice touch; especially appreciated by older viewers who find the space race and the science behind it interesting.

In conclusion, Space Dogs is a cute little film that does its best not to offend but never really strives for excellence in any arena either.  Younger viewers will be a lot more forgiving of the fluff but that abounds to fill its run-time and everyone else who enjoys it may also want to give 2008s Space Chimps a look.",1412294400,,4001,4.690987124463519

5014401,2,B006QWC33S,This is a pretty silly computer animated movie for kids. Don't expect anything too spectacular from this movie. It's fairly disjointed and jumps around a lot.,1351036800,,158,5.115384615384615
5014402,4,B006QWC33S,"It's hard these days to find a movie the whole family can enjoy without me or my husband cringing at certain parts that are inappropriate for our twin 6 year olds -- but this movie was just fine. No, it's not Dreamworks or Pixar, but that's okay - it's animation is crisp and the characters are fun and just enough goofy stuff happens to make our kids laugh. It's not the best movie you'll ever see, nor is it worthy (in my opinion) to purchase the DVD, but for a Netflix night or cheap rental, it will deliver entertainment and laughs and a happy ending.

Be sure to point out the ending credits to your kids, where they show real footage of the actual dogs, Belka and Strelka, on which the movie was based.",1348185600,8,708,4.2835820895522385
5014403,1,B006QWC33S,"Wow, what a scam this half-baked 'toon is.

They very carefully HIDE the fact that it's Russian on the box, which is clearly by design, because when it comes to piracy, that nation takes a backseat only to China, and this movie is pure piracy.

They steal almost every trick in the Pixar book, from the look of the dogs to the movement of every character to the dialogue feel, etc etc. Not that any of it is very good, mind you. The one thing they really couldn't even pretend to steal is the quality of the animation, which is 1990-level at best. There is no clarity or depth in any of the images here. The colors are washed out and never pop from the screen like Up or The Incredibles or Kung Fu Panda or any of the other truly fine animated features of the last decade. Nor do the dogs or people have any of the feel of those truly fine 'toons. All in all, this is, for 2012, F-grade animation.

Add weak voice work and you've got a real dog, however twee the premise.

It's also full of really weird pro-CCCP/Russian propaganda, ironically, because the only thing I took from this is that Russia was just lots of sweet fun for all in the recently post-Stalinist era. Alrighty then...just don't tell the folks who lost tens of millions of family members in the various Stalin etc pogroms.

And by the way, in real lie the dogs were just left to die in the capsule. Funny, that scene isn't in this crappy piece of lying propaganda.

This might be good for very young kids, and those who don't care about the art of animation (or truthful history), but for those who know what real quality is, and know what straight-up theft looks like when they see it, however weak, Space Dogs is a weak and childish propaganda mess, and well worth avoiding.",1336953600,,1745,4.37037037037037
