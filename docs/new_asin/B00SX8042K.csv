6994197,5,B00SX8042K,"I love love this Beauty and the Beast.  The Blu ray is fantastic the picture, color, clarity, and sound sre supurb.  The english dubbing actually sound like the french actors who played belle and the beast.  The reason I'm saying this because I have this movie on Dvd as well in original french language with english subs.  I cant tell you how happy I am right now!",1425254400,17,365,4.402985074626866

6994199,5,B00SX8042K,"A mesmerizing & unusual adult version of the beloved faerie tale...Beauty & the Beast...  The actors, sets, & costumes are breathtaking!  With an ending that is both beautiful & poignant.  Vincent Cassel is enigmatic & masterful as la Bete, while Lea Seydoux embodies Belle with just the right touch of innocent sexuality, vulnerability, courage & compassion opposite her Beast. The chemistry between them is believable & palpable. It has become my absolute favorite movie of all time!",1449619200,,485,5.2727272727272725

6994203,4,B00SX8042K,"One of my favorite movies of all time but the box cover shows a spoiler and the title menu almost seems like a pirated copy, but it's not. It is legitimately a beautiful blu-ray copy, don't worry!",1444953600,,196,4.324324324324325

6994205,5,B00SX8042K,"Fabulous production, cast, special effects, direction and telling of The Beauty and the Beast story!  As many reviews have stated, the dubbing is barely noticeable, and the Blue Ray plays here in the U.S. So glad I bought this version of this tale.  It was well worth the wait!",1438300800,,277,4.63265306122449
6994206,5,B00SX8042K,"Not a real fairy tale. Not childish as the Disney story is. Excellent acting, superb photography, lovely rewrite on the tale. I don't usually like dubbed films, preferring subtitles, but in this case it was very well done.",1436486400,,222,4.868421052631579
6994207,4,B00SX8042K,"I was so excited to be able to get this movie! Beauty and the Beast is one of my favorite stories and this is such a beautiful movie version. The only reason for four stars instead of five is because I would
Have preferred subtitles in English instead of dubbing. Otherwise I love it! It's a gorgeous movie and I'm happy to have it in my fairytale and fantasy collection. I also really like the two lead actors.",1436400000,,411,4.282051282051282
6994208,5,B00SX8042K,Love this version of Beauty and the Beast. If you love fairy tales then add this to your collection. The sumptuous sets and costumes alone are worth watching the movie apart from the beautiful re telling of this fairy tale romance!,1435104000,,231,4.658536585365853
6994209,5,B00SX8042K,Loved it! Such a fresh and imaginative retelling of a cherished classic. The cinematography was fantastic and the mood was more adult. Anyone who loves the story should own this DVD.,1432166400,,182,4.903225806451613
6994210,5,B00SX8042K,This film is fabulous and the voice over is great!...much better than subtitles but it has those too if you need them. The actors used for the voice overs were excellent...I saw the movie originally with subtitles and took a chance on this one as my husband doesn't like subtitles....we were both extremely pleased. This movie is a wonderful remake of the classic and adds a touch of reality to the fairy tale...the sets and costumes are great and special effects don't go too far as is done in most movies. I very much recommend this film.,1431561600,,540,4.577319587628866
6994211,5,B00SX8042K,"Not only is this an amazing movie, but when you order the Thai version you get English subtitles. There is also a voice over choice of English.  The only way this could be better was to have them speaking French, and had English subtitles.",1429228800,2,239,4.431818181818182
6994212,5,B00SX8042K,Beautiful movie!!,1428796800,,17,8.0
6994213,5,B00SX8042K,"Ohhhemmmmgeeeeeee Amazing. This is a region 1 Bluray , put it in my DVD/Bluray player and the picture is SUPERB. Sound is awesome, and that's just the disc itself. The movie is flawless. I also own ""Brotherhood of the Wolf/Le Pacte des Loups"" by the same director, and that version I have is also dubbed in English. But its so perfect I forgot a few times it was actually a French movie. Same with this film- the English dubbing is near perfect and you can't even tell the difference. This is probably one of the prettiest movies I have ever seen- if you are a fan of fairy tales and of Beauty and the Beast particular, the echoes of the 1930's 'Belle et la Bete' by Cocteau is definitely evident in this movie...but this film also stands on its own as a beautiful adaptation of this beloved story.",1428451200,4,798,4.398648648648648
6994214,5,B00SX8042K,love this movie worked fine. very beautful.thanks,1428278400,,49,6.142857142857143
6994215,5,B00SX8042K,"It was great I thought the English subtitles would be choppy but in fact flowed very nicely and although it was recommended to get an international DVD player, my regular American DVD player worked just fine. Loved this film :) beautiful costumes and sets",1427673600,3,255,4.818181818181818
6994216,5,B00SX8042K,This is an amazing movie.  Interesting story. That's why I purpose this movie.  Beauty and the Beast has always been my favorite movie to see. Great classic.  Romantic and a beautiful story.,1427155200,,190,4.875
6994217,5,B00SX8042K,"This is a good bluray plays great in bluray players that are region A. The movie is not the Disney Beauty and the Beast it is more for adults or teens PG-13. The movie  is about a merchant's daughter Belle (Beauty) in most versions exchanges her life for her fathers  to a Beast over a rose. I am very happy with the product. The English dubb is very good. no complaints no extras. If you like Beauty and the Beast be happy you have a chance to get it since it has not been released in the USA.

8699671,5,B00SX8042K,"This movie is beautiful and overlooked.  It was banned from the US due to the version Disney was making.  If you want to be mesmerized, choose this version.",1494547200,,156,4.535714285714286
8699672,5,B00SX8042K,Absolutely stunning movie. I have shared it with at least 5 people who were all very impressed. If you are a Beauty and the Beast fan this is definitely worth your time and money.,1474588800,,179,4.294117647058823
8699673,5,B00SX8042K,"I was looking for another version of Beauty and the Beast for a while now, and when I saw the trailer for this, I was excited. I love the CGI in the film; it didn't look overdone and crappy like I see in a lot of fantasy films to date. At first glance of the human form of the beast, I thought I wouldn't take to him, but seeing his parts in the movie, as the beast and the human, I did quite enjoy his performance. Belle is great in this. She's a good heroine and worth watching. It's nice that she's not just a one dimensional heroine in need of a lover and out to make everyone happy. She can give what you throw at her, especially when talking with the beast. I liked their chemistry in this, and the background story.

I was worried that I wouldn't like the dub at first, because (me being so used to watching dubbed anime) I thought the mouths would always match the voices for the dub. But The mouths still move very much in french, but I easily forgot once I submerged myself into the actual story.

Glad I took the time to purchase this because it was just the kind of fantasy romance film I'd been searching for, and I wish there were other movies like it.",1473120000,,1166,4.13215859030837

8699677,5,B00SX8042K,"This was a gift for my friend and she absolutely loved it. I was worried it wouldn't reach us in time for the holidays as I ordered kind of late but was pleasantly surprised when it came sooner than expected. The movie was 100% authentic, still in its original packaging, and played without a hitch in their DVD blue-ray player. This version was particularly hard to find, as I am from the United States. Thank you so much! Excellent service!",1460073600,,442,4.5375
