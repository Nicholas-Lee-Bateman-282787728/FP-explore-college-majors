8285137,2,B001BXRRN8,"This half-hour DVD is simply episode of a dramatic anthology called ""General Electric True"", which aired during the 62-63 season on CBS, on Sunday nights.  It was tucked in between ""The Real McCoys"" and ""Candid Camera"", but was up against ""Bonanza"" and the ""ABC Sunday Night Movie,"" so even if you are an old-timer like me, you might not have seen it. An IMDb reference to this episode can be found at [...]

Each episode was a dramatization of a story taken from ""True Magazine"" so their veracity might be subject to skepticism.  What can't be denied is that the CIA, National Archives, or any other government entity probably had little to nothing to do with this episode's source material or production.

In fact, I am most certain that Jack Webb, the narrator, would have agreed that even ""...the names may have been changed to protect the innocent.""

BTW, if you would like to see what is being offered, do a little Googling for ""CIA True Stories Security Risk,"" and you can see the whole episode, sliced into three parts, on YouTube.",1296172800,2,1039,4.686813186813187
