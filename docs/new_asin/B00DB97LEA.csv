5787137,5,B00DB97LEA,"This wasn't for me. There is a young man that works at the grocery store I go to occasionally and he didn't have the money to get it right then and he said, that was the only one of Star Trek's movies that he hadn't seen, so I got it for him and he paid me later for it.",1484784000,,270,3.593220338983051
5787138,5,B00DB97LEA,"Great movie's, I am not a fan of the newer releases of the Star Trek movies, I like the Utopian theme of the TNG, the Idea that the future will be better and all the old crappy ideals and Biases of the past are finally gotten rid of. So I like these movies and the actors and actresses who play in them.
In the best traditions of Star Trek, these are great.",1469664000,,357,3.9722222222222223

5787141,5,B00DB97LEA,I'd been looking forward to Star Trek 9 and 10 on dvd for sometime to complete my Next Generation movie collection. Both movies are awesome and the extras are great. Thanks Amazon.,1464739200,,180,4.65625
5787142,4,B00DB97LEA,"I'm still enjoying the Next Generation serial on Amazon Prime.  And probably my favorites of the Next Generation movies would be ""First Contact"" and ""Insurrection"".  The new Enterprise is appealing, and the new uniforms don't quite resemble pajamas as much as the earlier Next Generation sets.  I'm still looking forward to the ""Q"" Continuim movie.  That's one character I'd suspect who couldn't resist tinkering with human evolution.  And I've seen no indications that the Continuim has the least respect for Federation's Prime Directive.",1464652800,,539,5.445783132530121

5787152,5,B00DB97LEA,"I am really a fan of all Star Trek series and movies. These are very good dvd's, clear and bright colors, and priced well. I am trying to collect all of them while I can. I don't want to wait until they makes changes and increased cost, like they did to Star Wars.",1433462400,,264,4.0

8591222,4,B00DB97LEA,"I bought this for Insurrection.  One of the more tongue in cheek episodes.  Dana finds a race of people who live long and have no desire to modernize.  Great joke when Dana repeats a line to Worf that he overheard Troi say to Beverly.  Nemesis really confused the timeline about the Romulans as far as I 'm concerned, and it also confuses Dana's time line as well.  One of the worst of the series with the second generation crew.
But as a two pack it still leans towards better than bad.",1529539200,,487,4.3076923076923075
