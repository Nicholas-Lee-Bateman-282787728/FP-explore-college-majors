8274994,5,B00068S3UA,"I saw this when I was just a kid in North Carolina, liked it so much that I bought  this for VHS tape until it got lost in transition, glad that Amazon has it. Picture quality isn't like things are now but I can still see whats being shown on the tape.",1431648000,2,252,3.8461538461538463
8274995,1,B00068S3UA,Very poor copy. You state it has been digitally remaster. It looks like a copy of a worn out film. I want my money back.,1378512000,,120,3.84
