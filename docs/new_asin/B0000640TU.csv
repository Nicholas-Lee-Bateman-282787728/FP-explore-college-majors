7960038,3,B0000640TU,"This was an ok dance show. The dance numbers were good, the story line had potential, but I didn't really like much else. The costumes were strange (mainly on the female dancers) with the exception of two. I didn't care for the singing and the lighting was sometimes dark. Also, they used a bit too much slow motion during partnered dances which was kind of annoying. As for the story line, I don't think it was developed that well. All in all ok, but not my favorite Irish dance show.",1462838400,,485,4.4

7960041,3,B0000640TU,"I picked up a copy of Gaelforce Dance at my local Half Price Books and paid less than $10.00 for it.  I'm glad I didn't spend very much on it.

I thought I would see something similiar to Riverdance that would be about Irish mythology.  This show, while it was good, wasn't haunting and magickal as Riverdance is.

The storyline was strikingly unoriginal and was therefore easy to follow. However, some of the numbers didn't seem to have anything to do with the story itself.  And why they had a Riverdance-type finale at the end...It didn't seem to belong at all.

Basically, this show was a ballet, and as a general rule, when a ballet is over is over, it's over.  They don't usually do a finale-type last number.

The music was good, but the singer was hard to understand and wasn't very good.  However the dancers were very good.

So I rate the other parts of the show at 2 and the dancing at 5, which it gets a 3 altogether.",1146009600,13,929,4.348837209302325
7960042,4,B0000640TU,"I am referring to the last ballad called ""My heart, farewell"" that was mercifully omitted on the CD.  It ruined the whole show.  Celine Dion knock-offs simply have no place in an Irish show.  Why couldn't the director put a more authentic Irish lament, preferably in Gaelic?",1134345600,7,274,4.787234042553192
7960043,4,B0000640TU,"I don't like montage of this show. Many moments was unnecessary I think. When the dancer show the crazy tap - why they don't show this, on screen we see only his had or other dancers...? And moment like this not only.

Music is boring and monotonous. Musician performance was uninteresting, and for most moments - copied from M.Flatley shows.

I place 4 stars only for professionalism of the dancers.",1112745600,12,400,4.7
7960044,4,B0000640TU,"expecting the excitememnt of an Irish dance show, and well recieving it.  the story was easy enough to follow, but it still had some loopholes that were not explained.  the lighting made it difficult at times to see what was going on, but when the lighting was bad, the camera focuses on the highlight of the moment in the shot.  overall, gaelforce is a well done show worth keeping and watching over and over again.",1108252800,16,416,4.52
