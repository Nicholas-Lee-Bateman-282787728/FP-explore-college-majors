8461431,5,B0058EAPNU,"""A prisoner is forced to serve as a doctor's assistant, giving her a front row seat for the horrible going-ons. There's the experiment to revive Nazi soldiers who have frozen to death by having nude women rub their bodies all over the corpse (that one works), and the experiment tries to ""cure"" homosexual men by having nude women dance for them. This is only some of the horrors that are going on there""  decent word transfer, ok? from back of case",1416787200,,449,4.54320987654321
8461432,2,B0058EAPNU,"A group of women are sent to an experimental prison. The stated goal was to increase the twin output, but the experiments did everything but that. One of the prisoners is a doctor and is allowed to be part of the staff conducting experiments which tended to be sexual in nature. There is also a janitor named crazy Kurt who gets to rape the women.

The film includes rape, full frontal nudity, and bad cinematography. The transfer to DVD was horrible as was the sound. It is an Italian film, spoken in English with Dutch subtitles. The fuzzy film, which makes an nude scene not worth watching, has some authentic footage from concentration camps thrown in.

Film is available on a grindhouse multipack. The pictures on the Amazon DVD cover is not of this film.",1389916800,,760,4.622222222222222
8461433,1,B0058EAPNU,"1. WRONG MOVIES ON COVER! this is NOT Last orgy of the Gestapo!
2. Horrific transfer from VHS with Forced Dutch subtitles and tracking errors throughout!
3. Awful compression issues!!!!!!!!!!

only for completists. I am not sure how they are selling obvious bootlegs on amazon.",1371513600,,277,5.155555555555556
8461434,1,B0058EAPNU,"This DVD is a horrible VHS rip to a DVD-R!

Pros:

-The film itself (best viewed on VHS)

Cons:

-A horrible VHS rip to DVD-R
-Overpriced for poor transfer quality (very grainy, dark imagery, and limited visibility of the picture itself)

With that being said, save your money and wait for an actual licensed DVD (not DVD-R) to be released or revert to a VHS copy.",1365724800,3,364,4.454545454545454
8461435,2,B0058EAPNU,"Another reviewer has already spoken up about the horrible video quality on this DVD, and I agree very much. Specifically, the contrast is drastically offset, the picture has strange interlaced lines which are reminiscent of CRT lines, waviness in the picture suggests that this DVD came from a tape that had tracking issues, and the movie is lazily presented in a letterboxed instead of anamorphic format. (This means that black bars are present in the top and bottom of the picture itself, so it cannot be viewed properly on a widescreen TV. It would either be centered in a small box, or be extremely warped.) If you enjoy exploitation films, this is a good one, but stay away from this release! I think it's a real shame that this notable classic work of Bruno Mattei hasn't been given an even remotely good quality transfer. (The only reason I've generously given this product 2 stars instead of 1 is that I like the movie itself.) Also, I'd like to point out that I suspect this release to be a bootleg. I'm not certain of this, though. If that's correct, however, it's not legal to be sold on Amazon. Some of the signs of this that I've seen are that the cover is simply a theatrical poster with the distributor's logo next to it (which is quite common with some bootlegs), a typo on the back of the box left out needed punctuation at the end of a sentence, the material of the label seems sub-standard and looks more like folded computer paper, the disk itself shows signs of being a retail DVD-R with a sticker printed label (which is cheaper), and of course that no studio in their right mind would make this visibly bad of a release. Whether or not this is a legitimate copy, if you're going to purchase this movie, I strongly urge you to find another release.",1338681600,,1770,4.534375
8461436,1,B0058EAPNU,"Don't even bother thinking of buying this junk, the picture is of the poorest quality! I have yet to come across a DVD this bad! The film wasn't any thing to brag about either (Bruno Mattei), but to be able to rate the film fairly, we have to be able to really see it! The picture was dark and grainy, with jumps, fade outs, etc. And even worse, it was dubbed into English with Dutch subtitles that can't be removed, why would they bother to sell this junk? Until someone does a complete restoration to the original source material, pass on this one. Desert Island Films is not to be trusted, I now know not to buy anything with their name on it!
