8200461,4,B00004TJFT,"There is nothing better than seeing Burt Reynolds as an action star.  This  is the straight-to-video/straight-to-television film that premiered on and  was made by TNT (Turner Network Television).  The story is about a  candidate for congress whose speech at a congressional convention is ruined  because a Vietnam vet has set-off grenades inside the ritzy hotel in which  it is all taking place.  The villain kidnaps the congressman's wife and  daughter, and holds them hostage inside, while Burt Reynolds' long time  partner tries to save them, but ends up a hostage himself.  Now it is up to  Logan McQueen (Reynolds) to come to the rescue and save everybody inside,  including his partner (now it's personal).  The story is okay, the acting  is good, but it all ends up being the funniest movie of all time because  not only does Jefferson from ""Married With Children"" make an  appearence, but we get to sit for 90 minutes and watch Burt Reynolds make  the funniest faces ever!  This is a cool film and could rank as one of the  most horriblist, most funniest, and most greatest films of all time!",965088000,2,1101,4.817204301075269
