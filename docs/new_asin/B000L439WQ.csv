I especially liked the making of the schnitzel which I have found hard to handle but no more. The beef with horseradish includes a lot of horseradish if you aren't used to it - I'd try 1 T of glass jar prepared horseradish (not creamed). The potato & saurkraut salad is basically hot potato salad - use a little more sugar is you are not used to saurkraut. In beef rolls, I used middle eastern pickles which are milder than american pickles. I cheated on Bavarian cheese dish and used cream cheese rather than brie or soft swiss - made a great spread. The goose recipe needs goose rather than chicken as whole recipe is aimed toward the flavor of the goose. My Grandmother made her potato(leftover mashed) cakes like the recipe but with cooked onions mixed in, also. What was new to me was the onion (I used French's fried onions) buns which I love and have some in the freezer. Another sucessful video from cookingondvd. They still show the ingredients before demoing the recipe. And the recipes you print out have the final product in color.",1194652800,5,1142,4.575609756097561
