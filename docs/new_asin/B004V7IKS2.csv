This is a quite low budget production and is reasonably predictable, with most of the india stereo types of charater and culture on show.  I did enjoy it and I think that it was made by an Indian expatriate, so I think that it does portray the feelings of seperation that might be felt on comming home to India.
Worth watching if you want to a pleasent story and bit of a feel of Indian life",1376784000,,493,4.178947368421053
8443006,5,B004V7IKS2,"Hyderabad Blues is refreshing and sincere in its portrayal of the internal conflicts and the material adjustments that one has to go through when returning to India from the USA. What is honest is the predicament that a lot of first generation Indian professional settled in the USA are faced with. Where we work and live is home and where we are from and who we are is also home. I believe that this predicament is unique to Indians because their assimilation with the mainstream in the USA is just beginning.
Nagesh Kukonoor in the lead role as Varun is very comfortable in his debut as actor/producer/writer and director. He addresses the complex multi cultural issues and the emotional conflicts of an unmarried American returned professional male through the eyes of Varun who is bride hunting.
The film is rich in it's under current of sensitivity while retaining the honesty of the story line. There is levity in the film using commonplace daily routines which is brilliant and captures the essence without having to fall back on torturous monologues or tirades.
While the ending may seem clichd to the average viewer the underline message is important. Through his own experiences he conveys the possibility of a happy medium.
Good movies need not essentially be tragedies or about tortured souls. What is unique about this movie is its intelligence and skill in capturing the story of millions of Indian professionals settled in the USA, sticking to the fundamental honesty of the representative experiences and still creating a celluloid treat.
Highly recommended for all those who interact with such Indian professionals in the USA.",1068076800,11,1643,5.044117647058823
8443007,4,B004V7IKS2,"Hyderabad Blues is the story of Varun (Nagesh Kukunoor, who also wrote, produced and directed) who returns home to India for a visit and has to deal with his matchmaking parents.  It takes a humurous look at the customs and behavior, from an American perspective.  He meets childhood friends who have of course changed over the years to embrace what he can't contemplate.  Eventually he falls in love with Ashwini (Rajshri Nair) setting up some melodrama.  The last act is a little disappointing as it moves towards a cliche ending.  The movie works for the most part despite the low budget and amateur (yet natural) acting.  The comedy is spot on and is very authentic, mixing dialogue in English, Telugu and Hindi. This is not typical Bollywood fare with the obligatory songs and fights.  I also recommend 'American Desi' for something along the same lines..",995241600,12,860,4.889655172413793
