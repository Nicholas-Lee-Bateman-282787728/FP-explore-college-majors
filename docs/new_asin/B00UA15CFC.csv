7031506,4,B00UA15CFC,"Street Fight Match: Dean Ambrose vs. Luke Harper - This started before the opening bell as a brawl in the isleway with weapons used right away to just beat on their opponent or make moves more impactful such as a suplex onto an open chair as Ambrose relied on his unique style such as an elbow drop to a vertical Harper as they just continued to brawl all the way to the backstage area with something happening that had everyone asking questions for over half an hour resulting in a fun match that definitely lived up to both men's reputations as this was the type of ""fight"" that wasn't been seen since the Hollywood Backlot Brawl in almost 20 years.

Kiss My Arse Match: Dolph Ziggler vs. Sheamus - The loser of this match would have to kiss the ""arse"" of the winner as both men started trading fist to the outside with both men hitting some big moves only for Sheamus to get the advantage keeping Dolph grounded with mat wrestling & attempting submissions while fighting off any offense while Dolph played defense being able to have quick counters & reversals as this was a good match that played up to the story of their feud with Dolph being the ""underdog"" that Sheamus was out to destroy.

Tag Team Champions Tyson Kidd & Cesaro vs. New Day - Kofi Kingston & Big E represented The New Day in this match with the champions taking control playing to their strengths with Kidd using his superior quickness & wrestling ability & Cesaro showcasing his strength including how was caught Big E in mid-air without buckling or having to balance himself while using their opponent's own momentum against them causing New Day to attempt to single out one member & work him over in their half of the ring as both teams traded momentum through double team combinations & some impactful offense from a spear through the ropes to the deadlift superplex with even Woods & Natayla at ringside making their presence felt in what was a great match.

Russian Chain Match: United States Champion John Cena vs. Rusev - This was held under the traditional rules of the first man to touch all four corners without their momentum being broken wins the match.  Both men showcased their strength in the early moments using the chain in a tug of war before both men would go on to use the chain in unique ways such as to isolate in order to deliver offensive moves or to pull their opposition into a certain direction like the ring post or off the top rope as each man had used different ways using making themselves dead weight to stop the other's momentum by either using the ropes to their advantage of going to the outside to add extra pressure as they traded momentum back & forth executing their trademark offense while also having counters to their opponent's as this was a match that's told a nice story using the stipulation & chain in other ways than just beating their opponent with it as this was one of the best matches I've seen with this type of stipulation but it was a step down from their previous encounters as the bigger story here was who was drawing the most attention from the crowd & how someone reacted to it.

Divas Champion Nikki Bella vs. Naomi - Naomi had a completely different look (complete with boots that you had to see to believe) & attitude including new theme music as Nikki attempted to work over a specific part of the body before Naomi focused on the head & neck area with different types of facelocks along with some unique offense such as a bulldog directly into a turnbuckle as they went back & forth with both girls delivering some big moves in what was a solid match but missing something to make it truly click along with the fact that technically both girls were still heels so the crowd didn't have someone to cheer for didn't help matters.

Last Man Standing Match: Roman Reigns vs. Big Show - Reigns was able to get the advantage early knocking Show over the top & pushing him into the ring post before Show showcased his own strength tossing Roman around ringside while physically showcasing that he didn't want or need to use a weapon while Reigns used various weapons such as a table & chair to inflict punishment on Show as they traded momentum with Show using his size to his advantage with the weapons sometimes working in his favor while Reigns continued to take advantage of any opening he had in & outside of the ring destroying whatever got in his way while continuing to throw whatever he had at the giant resulting in a good match showing that Reigns definitely had to ""work"" to earn that win with the only downfall being the ending which we've seen more than once in this same type of matches in the past few years.

Steel Cage Match: WWE Champion Seth Rollins vs. Randy Orton - The RKO was banned for this match while Kane was in charge of the cage door for this match as Seth kept trying to escape early showing some Spiderman ability while Orton showcased he was more focused on punishment than victory including later delivering a move that was a direct message to The Authority as both men hit some big offense such as a running release powerbomb into the corner & flying knee of the top rope to a mid-air powerslam & superplex off the top of the cage while each man sent their opponent into the cage only for be thrown across it themselves multiple times before Kane was provoked to get make his presence known from ringside by more than just the participants in the ring as the winner ultimately came down to who was able to catch their opponent with something they never expected in a main event that delivered solid action but also continued the storylines involving all of the participants in the match.

(Preshow) Neville vs. Bad News Barrett - Daniel Bryan wasn't cleared to defend his Intercontinental Championship resulting in this match with Neville showcasing his superior speed constantly staying a step ahead of Barrett with armdrags & close pinfall attempts before Barrett was able to take advantage of his surroundings to get the advantage by grounding him & heavily focusing on a part of the body as they traded momentum hitting their signature moves with the winner being the one man being able to avoid one big move to hit their own in a good opening match.

Extreme Rules is usually one of my favorite PPV's of the year & this was no different as there wasn't a bad match on here with the action ranging from solid to very good so it's worth a look.",1430524800,,6414,4.536732929991357
7031507,3,B00UA15CFC,"Pre Show:

Adrian Neville vs. Bad News Barrett- This was a really good match, both looked great. Actually thought BNB was gonna win. But neville wins and really happy with his main roster showing so far. 3/5
Main Show

Chicago Street Fight: Dean Ambrose vs. Luke Harper- really fun match, these two were great. The match was different. Both guys get into a car and drive off. They come back later during the New Day interview. Ambrose gets his first ppv win in a year. Fun match and loved how long it was. 3/5

Kiss Me Arse: Sheamus vs. Dolph Ziggler- This was good match, sheamus really is a good heel. The stipulation was eh. But I really liked the match and aftermath. Ziggler wins and Shemaus was a great heel. 3/5

Tag Team Championship: Tyson Kidd and Cesaro vs The New Day (Kofi and Big E)- This was my match of the night. Really good match. Near falls and new day looked great. Ioved Cesaro and the end. No problem with new day winning titles. 3/5

Russian Chain Match for U.S Title: John Cena vs. Rusev- This was a good match. Probably my least favorite of their 3. Loved Lana and really liked the end. 3/5

Divas Title: Nikki Bella vs. Naomi- Both looked good and was a good match. Wanted Naomi to win but eventually she will get it. 2/5

Last Man Standing: Roman Reigns vs. Big show- Really damn good match, had table spots and barricade. Only complaint is ending kinda week. 3/5

Steel Cage/ RKO banned for WWE Title: Seth Rollins vs. Randy Orton- Good match , just kinda boring. Mania was way better. But didn't like Kane at all. Just glad Rollins retained though.

7031508,3,B00UA15CFC,"The Dean Ambrose vs. Luke Harper-Chicago Street Fight was good but much too long for it's own good. The Dolph Ziggler vs. Sheamus-Kiss Me Arse match while not great but pretty good, it felt more like a house show bout then a PPV Bout. The Cesaro and Tyson Kidd (w/Natalya) vs. Big E and Kofi Kingston (w/Xavier Woods)- Tag Team Championship was a really good tag match. The John Cena vs. Rusev (w/Lana)-Russian Chain Match for the U.S. Title was okay, but the finish was nothing special and the match wasn't very memorable. The Nikki Bella (w/Brie Bella) vs. Naomi for the WWE Divas Championship was so-so at best. The Roman Reigns vs. Big Show in a Last Man Standing match was solid hardcore bout with great work from both men to boot. The WWE World Heavyweight Title Steel Cage Match: Champion Seth Rollins vs. Randy Orton was going well, but the complete WCW style overbooking hurt it badly. This was a disappointing ending to the show. I give this PPV a 5 out of 10.",1430092800,,970,4.517045454545454
8704882,4,B00UA15CFC,"The WWE Extreme Rules Event in 2005 took place at the Allstate Arena in Chicago, Illinois. Thanks!!!",1496102400,,100,4.9411764705882355
8704883,3,B00UA15CFC,"WWE Extreme Rules 2015 on WWE Network and DVD. This year's was a formula of nostalgia and hardcore previously seen in wrestling's past eras.

The opening match (Chicago Street Fight), Dean Ambrose vs. Luke Harper is one of those examples where nostalgia came about because it was a pretty crazy war between these brawlers in the similar fashion of WrestleMania XII (Hollywood Backlot Brawl) which Dean had won after the WWE Tag Team Championship Match the following hour.

Dolph Ziggler vs. Sheamus - The losing wrestler has to pucker up to the winner. Dolph Ziggler wins, but the stipulation didn't live up to its name.

The New Day (Big E & Kofi) took on Cesaro and Tyson Kidd for the WWE Tag Team Titles and yep we've got new champions that brings a new day to this faction.

The Russian Chain Match: Rusev vs. John Cena - I've seen better Russian Chain matches than this, but when John Cena's winning, it doesn't live up to the hype. Rusev in 2014 was better back when he was unstoppable with such a powerful gimmick outta Russia.

Nikki Bella retains the WWE Divas Title, Roman Reigns wins the Last Man Standing match over the Big Show, and then the WWE World Heavyweight Title Match was contested inside a Steel Cage where Randy Orton takes on Seth Rollins (champ). However, Randy Orton is prohibited from using his RKO finisher which didn't stop Seth Rollins from winning at the vipers own game.

At least this WWE Network PPV was acceptable as possible.",1443052800,2,1461,4.665369649805448
8704884,3,B00UA15CFC,"Well this event for me only had 2 highlights - The New Day winning the tag titles (well deserved btw), and Nikki Bella retaining the Divas title!  (also well deserved).  The rest was just mumbo-jumbo mediocre type matches that could have been much better!

1.  Luke Harper vs. Dean Ambrose (Street Fight) - Really?  Looked like a replay of Piper vs. GoldDust from WM 12 - except not near as good as that!  They fight a little here and there, taking the ""brawl"" back to the back area where they had their trusty props awaiting them to use as weapons... they wind up taking off in a vehicle going who knows where!  They come back about an hour later, get out of the vehicle and head back to the ring where Ambrose gets the win!  (Like that's a surprise)!!  I rate this one 6/10.

2.  Sheamus vs. Dolph Ziggler - Hey, glad to see Sheamus as a heel again, I thought he was better as a heel!  This was a great match and one of the few highlights of the event - lots of cool spots and back and forth action until Ziggler finally gets the roll-up surprise win!  Sheamus does a great job acting shocked - and you didn't really think a tough guy like Sheamus was gonna kiss Ziggler's behind, did you??  Of course not!  He wound up beating up Ziggler instead and making him do the kissing instead!  Great stuff on this one!!  (8/10)

3.  The New Day vs. Tyson Kidd & Cesaro (Tag-title match) - I really liked this match - these are probably the two best teams in WWE right now and it showed!  Xavier Woods sure knows how to be annoying with his corny cheers, which I found amusing!  Great back and forth action with Kingston getting the pin (holding the tights but who cares)!  The New Day are new Tag Champs and I say HOORAY for them!  (8/10)

4.  Rusev vs. Cena (Russian Chain Match) - This match was a big let-down for me!!  As well as these two did in their previous matches I was definitely expecting something more!  I bet half the match was taken up by a simple tug of war with the chain!  YAWN!!!  I think this match was only used to help turn Lana face and to further her storyline of breaking up with Rusev!  Cena wins at the end and Rusev blames Lana - how in the world anybody could blame beautiful Lana for a loss is beyond me!!  (5/10)

5.  Nikki Bella vs. Naomi (Divas Title Match) - What in the world is Naomi wearing??  She's way past her cheerleading gimmick and much too tough a wrestler to be wearing all those glimmer-glammer glasses and shoes!!  Oh well - here comes Nikki Bella with Brie - looking gorgeous as always... my heart always melts when I see Nikki holding up the Divas title - that's wonderful!!  Well this was a pretty good match... I wish Nikki could have gotten some offense in early on in the match but Naomi controls the first half, hitting some great moves and showing her talent!!  Nikki comes back for the 2nd half and gets a flurry in herself, her top comes un-tied in the process, allowing us to see more of her beautiful chest!  They do a spot where Naomi sticks her head through the ropes, waiting on a chick-kick from Brie on the outside, she hits it - Nikki capitalizes and hits her Lex Luger rack attack to retain the title - great win for Nikki but I still missed seeing her forearm smash!  (7/10)

6.  Big Show vs. Roman Reigns (Last Man Standing Match) - Eh - not much going on here... they do a few spots where they crash into the (cushion-layered) outside barricade and Big Show flooring Reigns only for Reigns to get up at the count of 9.  There was one spot where Big Show waited FOREVER for Reigns to jump up on the announcers table and knock him down!  Show sat on the floor and got ready for Reigns to push that table over on him for the win!!  I really felt for the announcers trying to pass this stuff off as exciting!  I miss ECW!!  (5/10)

7.  Randy Orton vs. Seth Rollins (WWE Title Match) - once again, a big letdown for me - these two had a 10/10 match at WM, and this is what follows?  Why in the world would you want to ban the RKO after Orton hit the most thunderous RKO in history in their first match at WM?  Another thing... Ric Flair made a living blading himself after hitting the steel cage in the 1980's!!  In this match - both Orton and Rollins continuously hit their heads on the cage but no blood!!  Are their heads tougher than Ric Flair's, Harley Race's, or Dusty Rhodes'?  To me, that's a slap in the face of tradition!  I think they should have at least used those little pellets with red ink in them, making it look like they were busted open!  I know it's PG but it wouldn't hurt kids to see a little blood, the horror movies they see are much worse!  Another peeve I have with this match is Kane!  Who's side is he on?  He chokelams both Rollins and Orton, but puts Rollins arm over Orton for him to win?  Why?? The Kane I remember was a MONSTER!!!  Now he's playing a corporate guy letting little spoiled Rollins tell him what to do?  I don't get that!!  This was probably the worst steel-cage match I've ever seen - the only thing I liked about it was Orton using the Pedigree!  Anyway, Rollins USES the RKO for the win even though it's banned... JBL tries to make up for this by stating it was only banned for Orton!  UGH!!!  (4/10).

Well overall I thought this event was only good for the New Day and Nikki Bella wins and also the Sheamus/Ziggler match.  Everything else was disappointing and just... BLAH!!  (5/10) overall.",1439251200,2,5405,4.269496544916091

8704886,4,B00UA15CFC,"Skip the first hour (Ambrose v. Harper, Sheamus v. Ziggler) and go direct to the Russian chain match between Cena and Rusev. Both contestants make use of the chain around their wrists and the wrestling is excellent. Rusev had the power and Cena used tactical thinking against a superior foe. Five star match.

The next match, the Divas championship, Nikki Bella (c) vs. Naomi. Since Paige was injured and could not compete, Naomi was chosen as replacement. Despite this being a good match, it was all being carried by the champion. Plus having two heels puts this viewer cheering for the champion as Nikki retains.

Roman Reigns takes on the Big Show in a last man standing match. Truly shows what Reigns can do against a larger opponent. And the main event Randy Orton v. Seth Rollins for the WWE World Heavyweight title in a steel cage match. Riveting and no fast forwarding here. Action and better than either their match at WrestleMania or the main event. This is what a main event is!!! (5 stars) Overall rating for PPV four stars, perhaps 4.5 Worth the rental and would recommend purchasing the dvd.",1436054400,2,1105,4.72020725388601
