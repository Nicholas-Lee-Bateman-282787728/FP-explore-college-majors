4716911,5,B005KC4LKS,"This is an outstanding recording which shows how important is not only to people in general, but to Tibetans in particular.
How perfectly the Chinese plan to wipe out Tibetan culture. Even their music is prohibited, changed, or totally wiped out by very load Chinese propaganda songs.",1331942400,3,284,5.0638297872340425
4716912,5,B005KC4LKS,"I was in the process of reading the book Freeing Tibet and wanted to have a better sense of the country, the people and their culture. This film really showcased the Tibetans customs in song, dance, traditional clothing and their efforts to keep them alive while the Chinese government works to eliminate them. A very enlightening and educational film for anyone that wants to have a better understanding of the Tibetans struggle for independence.",1326585600,2,447,5.054054054054054
4716913,5,B005KC4LKS,Warmly suggested to who is interest in Tibetan culture! One of the best movies on the subject I saw in recent years!,1325289600,4,116,4.318181818181818
4716914,5,B005KC4LKS,"This is an exceptional film. It tells the story of music in Tibet, including when the Chinese invaded with their ""box music"" ie. cultural radio music. The director of this film was imprisoned for trying to collect Tibetan folk type songs, and several artists are shown who were imprisoned for keeping music alive. There are images of Chinese invasion of TIbet including smashing of priceless buddhas which I found upsetting, having visited Bhutan and seen similar 17th century treasures. The music keeps the film on a fun, uplifting note and is well translated. Cool even if you know nothing about Tibet or buddhism, just for the music history and culture clash aspects.",1315353600,6,670,4.991071428571429
8476743,5,B005KC4LKS,"This is a beautiful documentary that everyone in the world should watch.  We live in a world where we take our freedom and expression for granted.  I'm so grateful that Ngawang was able to live through his experience and share the truth about China to the world, the devastation and destruction that has been done to Tibet is appalling and should not be accepted.  Anyone who has been around the Tibetan culture understands and appreciates their simplicity and way of life.  For those that have not, this sweet film will open your eyes to an almost lost culture.  We all could benefit from this as the Tibetan culture teaches us about impermanence and what true freedom is all about.  Tibet is very special and we should not let the Tibetan culture die.  Thank you for bringing this awareness to the world.  May TIBET BE FREE and the suffering end now!

8476744,5,B005KC4LKS,"If you live on this planet and have any roots in a culture or tradition, this film will speak to you and mean something that will surely ignite a yearn for change in the way we are going with the flow of cultural depression, as a society.  The film depicts a story of blind hope from a distance, while capturing endless beauty and truly inspiring values. Whether you are Tibetan, Central- or South American, African, or from any other region with a long lineage of indigenous arts, most likely this will resonate with you as to what has happened in those cultures over the centuries as well.  More than a documentary film ,this is a message to humanity. Do not miss it!",1413936000,,669,4.475409836065574

8476749,5,B005KC4LKS,"This film offers a wonderful glimpse into the indigenous music of Tibet. It also tells a parallel story: the making of this film led to the filmmaker being jailed in Tibet by the Chinese for six and a half years. His eventual release due to public pressure on the Chinese government is a remarkable thing.

The stories told in the lives of ordinary people and the effortless expression of their music make this a memorable film. The sadness in it, I wish I could forget.

There is a great deal of pain being caused in Tibet, and not so subtle pressure on Tibetans to abandon their language and culture. It is illuminating to see that story unfold throughout the film. It remains to be seen whether the Chinese government's efforts will be successful. Will Tibet in the future resemble anything of the country that existed before the Chinese government ""liberated"" it in 1959?",1371427200,,875,4.712418300653595
8476750,4,B005KC4LKS,"this is more of a political tract than a musical documentary - i didn't come away with insights into the musical nature of Tibetan music - but I learned a lot about China's takeover of the country

at least there are plenty of impressive musical demonstrations - the voices are very pure and powerful - and the music is unusual and fascinating - but there is almost nothing on instrumental work - and no musical analysis at all

the bulk of this film focuses on the country's history since China's takeover - and on the filmmaker's experience in jail - and the experiences of others

it's almost like bait-and-switch - you borrow/rent/buy this DVD for the promise of music - and view an historical expos instead

nevertheless - i'm giving this documentary 4 stars - the history lesson is one worth learning about - if all you know about Tibet is the Dalai Lama's exile - here's a chance to deepen that understanding - as long as you stay aware this this is a one-sided view - still - presented in this framework - the history is easy to follow",1359936000,,1043,4.473684210526316
8476751,5,B005KC4LKS,"The beautiful country and the enduring spirit of Tibet is revealed in stunning photography exposing half a century of Chinese occupation. Simple wholesome people whose customs, language and song have been commandeered by a brutal occupation in this story show how insidious and deliberate this erase of a culture in modern times has occurred without any opposition from the rest of the world. The essence of Tibetan songs, they have a song for almost every activity in their daily lives, has been swapped out for Chinese music celebrating the communist party. The ensuing generations of young people now listen to Chinese song and know little of their culture. Is the motive simply territorial? Certainly the remaining ""Autonomous"" Territory of Tibet is half the size of the pre-occupation country. The WHY? of the culture-cide otherwise remains a mystery to the world. The Spirit of Tibet lives on in the older generations, but seems to be headed for the anthropologist's library as the deliberate erasure of their culture continues. A beautiful way of life, a simple people in one of the world's most spectacular landscapes, is systematically being disappeared. Prayer wheels, prayer flags, staggering mountain top vistas, yaks, nomadic life, all being replaced with modern Chinese boom boxes and traffic jams...
This movie is a moving experience presented with appropriate simplicity. The Dalai Lama presides over the Tibetan government in exile in India. Like his people, he continues to celebrate the good, the true and the beautiful. Is he fighting a lost cause...?",1356652800,3,1571,5.2629482071713145
8476752,4,B005KC4LKS,Courage and music go together hand in hand in this movie. The terrifying process of culture destruction by a big power crushing a pacific country is happening in front of our very eyes. Keep on singing from the ttop of the world Thibet. All things must pass. Even China.,1348876800,2,270,4.530612244897959
