8217008,3,B000V79RCE,"The Zigma Television network has come up with a doozy of an idea to resurrect its faltering ratings: HUMDUM, the Game of Love and Money. The shaky theory behind HUMDUM, the network's new reality game show, is that when a couple lives together for a time, they fall in love. Two young strangers, Rrutu Joshi (Anjana Sukhani) and Siddhant De (Romit Raaj), are chosen to be the first ever contestants in HUMDUM, a show to which they'll devote one month of their lives. The reality game show is divided into four zany stages and then culminates into one all important question: whether to choose love or the prize money of Rs. 10 crores. So, to win the prize, all Rrutu and Siddhant have to do is not fall in love. But choosing the money would mean that they cannot see each other again for 20 years. This, to a romantic fool like me, is a supremely diabolical twist.

Both Rrutu and Siddhant have their own agendas and could care less about love. Lovely Rrutu has a deadline to meet to pay off some thugs so she can keep her dog adoption center, and, besides, she's already engaged. Meanwhile, the irresponsible, happy-go-lucky Siddhant had just totaled a car he had ""borrowed"" and must somehow make financial amends. So they're both in it for the money, and easy money, at that.

So on to four weeks spent in playing the game. The first week is the ""Will You Be My Friend?"" segment, as Rrutu and Siddhant go on various dates, except that they end up despising each other. The second week has each of them spending time with the other's family (and they have to be liked by each other's family or they're disqualified). The third week, the show really gets serious and plonks them at a romantic resort for some alone time. And, O my friends, love has a way of sneaking into unwanted places and effing up all kinds of plans. So, just maybe, that theory behind HUMDUM isn't that shaky after all. Rrutu and Siddhant spend the last week apart from each other, and this turns out to be the most challenging, most torturous seven days. Because, yes, by this time, those two had fallen in love.

I've seen this movie twice, and honestly I didn't think too much of it on the first go-around. I saw it again a second time and, to my surprise, ended up liking it better, and I don't know that I can put a finger on exactly why. HUMDUM, a 2005 Bollywood film, features two young and good-looking newcomers in the lead roles and, in its breezy sensibilities, the film caters to the younger audience. Romit Raaj as the rascally Siddhant, in particular, is easy to identify with, while the lovely Anjana as Rrutu is fairly brilliant and espouses a contemporary outlook on life, so she isn't at all confined to the traditionally subservient and very played out ""heroine"" role. I don't have a problem at all with these two actors; I thought they do well with what they're given and their performances are solid enough that they do build an emotional connection with their audience.

I guess what made me not like it the first time is that the game sequences aren't consistently interesting and suffered some with weak execution and just from simply trying to be too cute (the ""Friendship week"" segment has many aggravating moments). And, given that this is a romantic comedy, it's a cinch that these two contestants won't be able to help but fall in love, and I guess it played out the way it did so that the melodrama could be built up, but it's just lame to me that they wait until it's almost too late before they let each other know how they really feel about each other. I also don't think much of Siddhant's best friend. The reason I caught HUMDUM a second time is that I dug the two lead actors, liked them enough that I stuck around again just to see them try to achieve that happy ending. Anjana Sukhani and Romit Raaj both have a future in Indian cinema, and they deserved a much superior screenplay. As it is, their energetic debuts balance out the could've-been-better storyline, rendering HUMDUM merely an average film.",1240531200,,4013,4.546334716459198
