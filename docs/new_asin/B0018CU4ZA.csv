Vincent Pastore from GoodFellas is in this as loan shark and gambler who works under Big Paulie. If you liked GoodFellas, Casino, and One-Eyed King, then buy it!",1391817600,,316,4.660714285714286
8269436,3,B0018CU4ZA,"Lucky Man (2007) from Ruvin Orbach, is a 30 minute film that is
perhaps not as interesting, as it can be useful for those involved, in
showing their skills and getting financing for future projects
in the underworld film genre.

Overall, the story is fine, (although reminiscent of Martin
Scorcese's work MEAN STREETS), in that the story follows over 30
mins, the life of a compulsive gambler, shooting craps in back
rooms, and losing all his money, incurring losses and the wrath
of collectors of illegal debts aka ""the muscle"".

All the ingredients are here: an introverted outlook on life,
from being born, raised and socialized exclusively in a
particular area of Brooklyn, the tradition of Catholicism,
muggings, beatings, loan sharking, middle and high level
management overseeing various underground profitable
activities in their restaurant back rooms, various rival mob
families, etc.

From an outsider's point of view, the fascination is more in
contemplating the  total lack of defense that some individuals have
from the pleasures and thrills of gambling and games of chance,
despite the extremely unlikely possibility of beating those
odds or winning anything now or in the future.

The music is appropriate, as is the pacing of the action and
the scene locations. Vincent Pastore's presence is perfectly
fine while  Frank Vincent is dazzling as a high-power crime boss running
operations and deciding on the strategies of his crew, etc.

Lastly, the only weakness, is the total grainy quality of the DVD
release, which is unexplicable, despite a perfect lighting of
each and every scene filmed, and so on.",1257984000,,1619,5.180076628352491
