I'm not going to explain the movie. What I will do is explain the technical details of quality. 1) Pretty good transfer to streaming format; 4:3 with some Telecine problem (VCR source). 2) Good audio. 3) Good color. So, all the tech aside the cast is perfect and will not disappoint.",1470355200,,472,6.507936507936508

712877,3,630385303X,"There was a lot of 90s hair and I loved the old cars. Mostly high camp, acting - college drama department levels",1468886400,,112,4.136363636363637
712878,5,630385303X,"OK.  My roommate and I have loved this movie ever since we saw it on Showtime Beyond.  It's hilarious, but oddly touching.  And Nicole Eggert is fabulous!  However, it is DEFINATELY not worth paying $70 or even $30 for.  I would love to have a ""real"" copy of this movie, but I would NEVER pay that much!",1070496000,6,303,4.245614035087719
712879,3,630385303X,"I rented this because two things seemed to go together; rated R, and Nicole Eggert was in it.  Need I say more? :-)
However, this is no ""Blown Away"".  The closest you see ""the Egg"" naked is when she strips down to briefly enter the shower to help the alien (who at that moment had control of a beautiful woman's body) wash herself, but you never see anything of her.
I don't remember much else except the alien eating everyone and Amanda falling in love with the alien itself, rather then the body it takes over.  However it is funny and is worth it for ""Egg"" fans.",1021766400,2,565,4.261682242990654

713216,3,630385303X,"Simple movie with little to be interested in. And yet, not boring for some reason. Okay for an airline trip download (to watch while flying) or if you have 2 hours to kill.",1472428800,,172,4.242424242424242
713217,2,630385303X,"The only reason I even considered watching this movie was because Michael Dorn (Warf) was in it. Having only seen him in Star Trek Next Generation, it took me a while to figure out which character was him. Before I watched it I thought he would be the alien. I liked the actress that played Amanda, but the story line was silly. There was some unexpected nudity and some rather explicit sex scenes. It is worth watching only if you have plenty of time to waste and are really in to sci-fi alien movies.",1472342400,,502,4.351063829787234

713350,2,630385303X,Silly movie but ha some entertainment with some witty social criticism.  Could be funnier,1471478400,,89,5.357142857142857

713357,1,630385303X,It was beyond B as a film. I laughed all the way through it. I watched it because Stacy and Micheal dorn were in it. Then it was like a train. Wreck. I could not look away. Lol,1470700800,,176,3.6578947368421053
713358,5,630385303X,"This movie is based off the short story by Robert Silverberg that was featured in the magazine Omni, vol 5 no 8, May 1983. The story was very, very good - so I was leary when I saw they made a movie from it. Though a few minor points were changed, it kept true to the main story and enjoyed it more for that. If you can find the original story, worth a read as the movie is worth a watch - campy, but original.",1470355200,3,410,3.835294117647059
