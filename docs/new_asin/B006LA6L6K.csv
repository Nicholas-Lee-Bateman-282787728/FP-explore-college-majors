5002566,5,B006LA6L6K,Just keeps getting better with this series. If you haven't seen this you don't know what you're missing. Nickelodeon didn't know what a gem they had on their hands when they cancelled it. Excellent in nearly ever category- which is so truly rare in television today.,1346803200,6,266,4.804347826086956
5002567,5,B006LA6L6K,"It's been a very long time since My Life as a Teenage Robot first hit the airwaves of the Nickelodeon T.V. channel in 2003. It was (and still is) a very different cartoon from any other, ESPECIALLY next to the majority of shows on Nick. Since then, Jenny's small-but-passionate fan-base has struggled as best it can to catch the show when it's on, due to a lack of availability on interactive media, and have paid tribute to these adventures with fan-art, a few fanfictions here and there, and uh... well, in case kids are reading this, I'll not mention the other stuff.

Well, our Teenage-Robot Diaspora has been quenched after all these years; at long last, all three seasons are available on DVD. Each episode is in the most pristine quality; however, there are NO set-up options or bonus features. Quite a pity, really; I would have loved to see interviews with Rob Renzetti or the other magic-makers concerning the making of the show, as well as each one's opinion on the characters. Still, it's a minuscule matter when we have the show itself after so long.

For what it's worth, I purchased this, the Season 2 set, first. I'd already paid for a few of the Season 1 episodes when it came out on Amazon Instant Video, you see. If you've already read my review there, you probably know I'm a big fan of the show myself, though I didn't find out about it until about 2007.

This show is a gem, and a most unique one- it is woven with fun, witty humor in contrast to Nick's other shows, most of which are loaded with gross-out jokes; the story arc of each episode is dynamic, engaging, comes full-circle as a proper story should, and holds noteworthy morals without coming off as preachy; each character is her or his own memorable being; the art style is easy on the eyes, and give the world an unmistakable look all its own; All these assets and much, much more systematically work together to bring out the best in each other, resulting in all the richer of an experience.

I admit that my prattling here is quite subjective; if you've not already watched the show, but would like to try it out, please don't go in on my word. Instead, go in with a curious, open mind and allow the show to grow on you, if it will. I'd hate to cause disappointment in future viewers.

So in closing, it's a great collection; each episode is clear as crystal; a lack of bonus features is a bit of a downer, but a very light one to be sure. I recommend this show to anyone looking for an experience, not just a gag-fest; however, it's your call.

Amazon, thank you for this!

Signed,
Ryan.",1331683200,7,2575,4.4543524416135885

5002569,4,B006LA6L6K,"Like everyone knows, who considers to buy this DVD, the content is super fantastic. So I'll focus on the quality.
The DVD's cover and the back of the DVDs itself make a very expensive impression. Each season includes 3 DVDs. I bought all seasons and the first two DVDs of each season had scratches. These haven't been a problem up to now, but I think for 20 USD scratches should be excluded.....
The quality of the episodes itself is good. The DVD menu consists out of and <CHOOSE EPISODE> or something like that. So it isn't very easy to find out which are episodes and which are EXTRAS, but I think this isn't really a problem.
All in all I think it's completly worthy to buy these DVDs because these are only minor problems and the content itself is too good to miss it. I hope they will produce a fourth season of this amazing cartoon.",1329091200,3,839,4.384615384615385

5002578,5,B006LA6L6K,"For the record, I purchased this on DVD during the summer of 2014 on a different account. I can honestly say that was one of the most memorable, and overall, best purchases I made that year. This show is fantastic! Although, I love every season of this show, but I can honestly say that season two is probably my personal least favorite out of the three. However that does not mean I dislike it at all. In fact, I love it. This season slightly drifts away from the theme that season one had, being about the life of a robot out-cast and the general life of a teenager. This season defiantly dealt with some elements of that, but it leaned more towards goofy humor and being a ""super hero"". One of my favorite qualities about the show is the animation style. This looks very retro and simple, I LOVE IT! Throughout the show there are countless different shades of color and lighting variations that illuminate on the characters. This show seams to specialize best in is expressing the mood. Throughout the show, you will always be able to read Jenny's feeling in various situations, making her more relatable. She always expresses herself with strong emotions, visually displayed through her eye shapes, body postures, and pig-tail positions. Its perfect for this tone. When it comes to entertainment value, it is very, re-watchable, up to a point. Unfortunately, there are only 22 episodes in season two (77 in the entire show). With so few episodes, this would be like re-watching a regular movie over and over. In fact, the running time of every episode in this season put together is roughly the same as a feature length movie. That being said, you will fly through this very quickly. At the end, I wanted more. Being unfamiliar with what interests children today, my guess is that they will like this. However, others, like me, who grew up with this cartoon will love it much more. This is beyond worth it if you fall under that category. This show is not very well known at all, unfortunately, so you are likely revisiting this title. I highly recommend watching this show. Re-watching this cartoon nearly ten years later was truly more nostalgic than words can express. I hope I have helped you out. Thank you for reading my review!",1455321600,,2238,4.682741116751269
