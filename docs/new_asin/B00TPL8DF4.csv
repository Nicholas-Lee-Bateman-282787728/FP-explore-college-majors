After a disappointing Curious George 2: Follow That Monkey and a relatively pedestrian Curious George Swings into Spring, executive producers Ron Howard and Brian Grazer have given this popular childrens book character the kind of animated adventure he deserves. Curious George 3: Back to the Jungle may be better than the original Curious George theatrical release, and thats quite a compliment for a direct-to-DVD release.

This outing, George (voiced by animated voiceover genius Frank Welker) is recruited by a space program run by a man named Houston (John Goodman) to fly into space to link a gizmo to a satellite and then return to Earth with it so that the gizmo can be installed in Africa to prevent flooding. And yes, we do get the line, Houston, we have a problem. So while the previous two Curious George films were aimed directly at preschoolers and everyone else be gosh-darned, this time there are a few more embedded allusions to entertain the older siblings and parents who watch with them.

The screenplay is more clever, too, with non-stop action in a tale that has George crash-landing in Central Africa and the Man in the Yellow Hat (Jeff Bennett) going off in search of him, while Houston and his flunkie (Alexander Polinsky) do the same. Along the way there are animal encounters, plane and land rover and helicopter and log rides, a scientist (Angela Bassett) who mistakes the Man in the Yellow Hat for a poacher, and a high-stakes situation where everyone is depending on George and his best friend.

The animation is as it was with the first films in this seriesfirst rateand theres the added bonus of great songs by Heitor Pereira and others. Theyre not memorable enough to stick with you after the film is long over, but they do help drive the narrative and give the film a cheery tone.

CuriousGeorge3screenIn fact, even the most threatening moments are muted because of George or his screenwriters. George has a disarming way of making new friends, whether those friends are human or animal, and this movie details a number of his encounters helping other animals and making instant friends. The message is clear and downright biblical: Do unto others, as you would have them do unto you. Pay it forward, would be the modern secular equivalent, and thats exactly what George does. He helps everyone, and it comes back to him and the Man in the Yellow Hat when they need it the most.

There are lots of primary colors (that appeal to preschoolers) and a fluid three-quarter to full animation that impresses, even in sequences that could have proved challenging. Its still a movie thats aimed at a target audience of six year olds and lower, but Curious George 3: Back to the Jungle transcends that audience . . . if viewers still let that little kid inside them flourish.",1436054400,7,2974,4.833005893909626

7013605,4,B00TPL8DF4,"Thank you Universal Pictures for sending us this DVD to review!

Curious George is back and up to his usual unintended trouble making.  The story begins with George and Ted (the man in the yellow hat) flying a kite in a park.  For most people the worst case scenario is losing the kite to a tree, but for George it's a very expensive excursion with many food vendors  getting their carts knocked over and losing any chance of  turning  a profit.  The man in the yellow hat hands out yellow contact cards with his insurance information to those impacted by George's kite flying.  It makes me wonder what his insurance premiums are.

Later George and his owner head back to the museum where Ted works and they are greeted by Mr. Houston.  There is an opening for an astronaut to go on a mission to alleviate the massive flooding in Africa.  George is eager to go, but the man in the yellow hat isn't sold on the idea right away.  Fortunately for George, he relents and lets him go on the mission.

Sadly, the mission doesn't go as planned and George gets lost in Africa..  Houston and his team estimate George's location within a 500 mile radius.  Not surprisingly, most of the movie revolves around locating George.  Even though George starts off alone, it's short lived as he befriends many unlikely wild animals.

While this movie teaches the value of friendship, it has a very dangerous ending that involves flying a metal framed kite in the middle of a thunderstorm.  Other than that, I recommend this film for kids of all ages.  The music is catchy and arranged by Heitor Pereira.  Besides the movie, the sound track is worth looking into as well!",1435363200,,1651,4.5699658703071675

7013607,5,B00TPL8DF4,"Mr. Houston (voice of John Goodman) from the Global Space Agency has his eye on George for a very important space mission. George is eager to participate. Ted is not comfortable with the idea, but if George can complete the training without a hitch he's allowed to go.

There are animated films that have scenes and dialogue more suitable for adults, so it's good that children have a character like Curious George to entertain them. Even when he's causing havoc, there's an innocence that is so adorable. I believe children will enjoy watching this spunky little monkey's adventures in space and Central Africa, along with listening to nice songs with good messages. The colors are so vibrant and cheery. And Tech Andrew (voice of Alexander Polinsky) is a likable character, with his bouncy red hair and computer expertise.",1435190400,2,824,4.971014492753623

7013678,5,B00TPL8DF4,"This has been my two year old's favorite movie 'of all time' for about nine months. Like the PBS CG series, this is a movie that you, the adult, will also probably find yourself being drawn into as George tries to figure out how to get out of several sticky situations.  There are lots and lots of exciting subplots that hold a little one's attention.

I liked that this movie had no evil villan type character or adult subtext, and that it was fun for my son without being crass. in that sense, it's like the PBS series, one of the many reasons I love Curious George. I hasten to add, CG1 and CG2 do have evil villans, and my son is not at all interested in those two big screen CG movies, although he loves the entire PBS CG series and the Curious George movies that were made to air on PBS. He has yet to watch any other type of children's movie the whole way through.",1461542400,,871,4.178571428571429

7013750,5,B00TPL8DF4,"This just aired on PBS last week but since my oldest started school he couldn't watch it on TV.  I was unable to watch even half of this one on TV to really see if it was good enough to purchase, but I took a chance anyway.  If you haven't seen both the first movie and the tv show, then some of the things I love about this show won't matter to you.  However, in the first movie, Will Ferrell (who I love in movies) plays the part of Ted (the man in the yellow hat).  He does NOT play a part in this movie, which is completely fine with me because I LOVE Jeff Bennett playing the part in the TV show and then continuing it to the movie.  Don't get me wrong, Will Ferrell is a great actor but because he is who he is, I can imagine him talking in the part instead of seeing ""Ted"".  (I don't think kids will care about this part of the movie at all).

Was it worth purchasing instead of trying to find a way of viewing or taping it on tv?  I think so.  We only have free channels and no way of recording a tv show easily but this allows me to have a legal version of the movie that I can move between tvs and take to Grandma's house if needed.  In this age of technology I probably could have purchased or found a different version but we use DVDs often and use them as a way to let the kids make choices, so buying the movie was a good idea.

The movie itself is entertaining enough for children to sit down and watch (mostly... kids get fidgety!).  There are a lot of animals and some educational material in it but there are some differences from the show.  Where I think the tv shows are extremely geared to teaching a lesson or process this movie has more entertainment value with a mix of education.  It will probably get watched at least a few times while the kids are still young so I'm glad I got it!",1440374400,,1808,4.0139664804469275

It kept him and me (normally not easily entertained) watching! This movie is SOOOOO much better than Curious George 1 and much better than 2. Such a cute movie!,1439769600,3,305,4.464285714285714
7013755,5,B00TPL8DF4,"I love and have all the Curious George Series and movies available.  Interestingly they are mine, so my Granddaughter watches them with me.  She's going to be 5 years old next week. Since My Granddaughter introduced me to the first Curious George Movie  a little while ago, they are my favorite  programs on PBS and also  my collection.
I love Back to the Jungle.  Ithink the music in the programs is wonderful and this film is neat.
I noticed throughout the Back to the Jungle there are little sections of music from  the other films.  Just subtle and creative.
I am thankful for Mr. Howards and Mr. Grazer's and allthe people who make these programs.  I read the credits (it's a habit)  and it's clear why the programs for Curious George are good.  Thank you. Suzanne Demers",1439769600,,776,4.591240875912408

7013792,3,B00TPL8DF4,"I thought the animation quality of this latest George edition was much less than movie 1 and even less than the PBS George tv episodes.  The music didn't seem very inspiring or memorable.  My young child only wanted to watch it once, compared to dozens of views for the first movie, so it seemed to not be much value for the money for us.  The mini-lesson on dams and water management was interesting, the variety of African animals was neat to see, and the space component was fun, but the complete package seemed to be a lower budget rendition than other George efforts.  I bought the DVD as a pre-order but should have waited for the reviews to come in.",1436745600,,656,4.441666666666666
