8739607,5,B017KT1RRS,"""Back to Basics"" is a very fitting description of this dvd.  I wasn't looking for anything ""flashy""--just something that would get me using weights more.  I like that the instructor does the exercises with me.",1511049600,,209,4.942857142857143
8739608,5,B017KT1RRS,"At first I didn't like the little rest times she takes, but I can't argue with the results.  And I'm not new to weight lifting. This is really GOOD!",1488499200,2,148,4.103448275862069
8739609,5,B017KT1RRS,"I really like the mix & match option so you can create your own workout. I would say these are lower intermediate routines using the weights Charlotte does but since the instructor focuses on slower controlled movements, I was able to use use heavier weights and def got a great workout. Heavy up & you will feel the burn. I liked her personality and enjoyed these routines. The DVD has almost 100 minutes of workout time so it is a great bargain",1485907200,,446,4.451219512195122
8739610,5,B017KT1RRS,I ordered this DVD after reading the reviews and wanting to change up my weight routine.  This is really a great option for me.  In the menu you can choose your workout. (any combo of the 6 workouts...plus the warm up or cardio)  You can choose the size of weights.  I'm a 53 year old woman who has been using weight workouts for approx. 1 year and I use 8 and 10 pound weights. The instructions are easy to follow and there are tutorials for added instructions.,1484006400,4,462,4.275862068965517
8739611,5,B017KT1RRS,Great quick workouts that you can program in any order you like each time. Charlotte Ord has a nice way about her and a nice accent.,1483660800,,132,4.115384615384615
8739612,1,B017KT1RRS,"This is probably the worst exercise dvd I have ever bought (and I own a lot).  It looks like a home movie that was done in the instructor's living room. There are more breaks in between workouts than the actual workouts themselves which are also very low quality and I believe does nothing for you. The dvd states that it is for beginners to intermediate but is actually more for extreme beginners who never exercise and just want to do a little something.  As an avid fitness person, this is a joke even if I was a beginner.  If you want good beginner dvds, I recommend any from the 10 Min Solution series, which still gives a decent workout without being overwhelming. I own a few of them also and they are great. As for this dvd, I just got it a few days ago and it is going into my bag to donate to Goodwill since I don't even want to keep it.",1483488000,3,847,4.152439024390244
8739613,3,B017KT1RRS,"It's OK - good mix of exercises, but it's kind of boring.",1478736000,,57,3.8333333333333335
8739614,5,B017KT1RRS,"I didn't really know what to expect from this workout DVD, but I was very happily surprised to find out how good it is.  I've done all five of the strength workouts on the disk and I love the exercises and how the instructor put them together.  Each workout is around 15 minutes.  For each strength workout you do two exercises twice, then two more twice, then two more twice.  So you've got a total of six different exercises done twice each -- most of the time you do 15 reps of each.  I normally do a 30- to 45-minute cardio workout, and then tack on one of these 15-minute workouts at the end.  This DVD can be for beginners, intermediates, or advanced exercisers depending on what size weights you use.  I consider myself intermediate/advanced and get an excellent workout from all of the sessions.  I'm extremely pleased with this purchase!",1475280000,5,846,4.556291390728477
8739615,5,B017KT1RRS,Fantastic workout.  Charlotte gives great pointers and takes her time leading you through the routines.  I love how she programs the workout for you--takes the guesswork out of it!  She comes off very natural and fun.  I hope Charlotte will be making more DVDs in the future.  I'm a definite follower!,1464048000,5,301,4.823529411764706
8739616,5,B017KT1RRS,"I'm surprised this has not gotten more reviews.  I agree with the other poster, this is a fantastic set of workouts and I really hope she puts out more in the future. The six workouts are anywhere from about 11 - 17 minutes each on average.  What I appreciate most is that you really get a lot of bang for the buck in a short amount of time without somehow feeling like you're killing yourself to do it.  I'm 52 years old and an intermediate exerciser and love her pace, her tone, disposition throughout them all.  These contain basic strength, compound moves, some plyometrics, some HIIT (cardio about 11 minutes) and very good core work interspersed in them, even the ones that are not specifically core work. She provides voice over on all the workouts which I'm not always a fan of, but it didn't bother me a lick here at all.  She gives great form pointers, encouragement and seems very natural.  You can play them all at once or program/customize them yourself.  The music is good, set is bright and airy and it's just her doing a fabulous job leading.  I don't miss that there aren't others in the background. And I'm one who normally does.  She doesn't rush and gives you time to recover so you can work through each set properly with good form.  She even includes tutorials to preview the moves and options to moderate where needed.  Bravo Charlotte!  Please consider future workouts for the home consumer.  Please, please, please!!!",1464048000,15,1442,4.6299212598425195
