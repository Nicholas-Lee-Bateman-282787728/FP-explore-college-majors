8593575,5,B00DIOB46O,Ghost in the Shell Arise - Border 2 is the retelling of the creation of Section 9.  It really is quite good.  I plan on buying it when it is dubbed in English but simply couldn't wait till then.  The anime is clean and sharp and the storyline is interesting.  As a fan of GITS I will take whatever I can get.  I love this series and hope that it inspires more.,1393113600,3,360,3.9444444444444446
