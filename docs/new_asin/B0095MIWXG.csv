8536185,5,B0095MIWXG,A very good training video by a master photographer Michael Andrew.  A resource to refer to from time to time.,1455062400,,110,4.5
8536186,5,B0095MIWXG,"I'm changing my review.  At first I thought that because the first thing Michael Andrew says on the DVD is this is NOT for beginners, or even intermediate photographers, that I would have to return it because it would be over my head.  I decided to watch it anyway to see if I could get anything out of it, since I'm basically a hobby photographer.  It is GREAT.  It starts with something basic, ""What Is Light"".  Everything is explained in a way that even someone completely new to photography can understand.  He even explains what camera functions control which kinds of light.  Lots of details, explanations, and worthwhile info going on here.  I'm sure I will watch it several times as I learn the techniques and become more comfortable.  SO, if you are just a beginner and you buy it, DON'T be discouraged when he says it's not for beginners or intermediates...you will definitely learn from this DVD.",1420675200,5,907,4.689873417721519
8536187,4,B0095MIWXG,This helps make you a better planner and visualizer.  You want to watch it  over and over and over again.,1388016000,,105,4.2
8536188,4,B0095MIWXG,"I have viewed a few of Michael Andrew's videos and his explanation of lighting is great. He breaks down lighting into something easy to digest and teaches you how to work with natural and reflected light. This video also details more of the science of photography and how with just a little flash can make a hug difference in a shot.

Like all his video there are some sections that I've already learned but the way he teaches is bar none the best I've seen and worth watching because there are little nuances that can make the shot better. If you have little understanding about lighting this is a must buy. Even for me with ten plus years of experience I've learn a wealth of information and even improved my skills.

The only reason I didn't give it five stars is the price. The video is almost four hours which is typically the length of all his other videos. This video seem much higher than his others. Not sure the price discrepancy, the only thing I can guesstimate is he works with a model on just about every sequence opposed to his other videos. But overall very well made video highly beneficial and recommended when it comes to lighting. Will be going back to this video as a reference.",1365206400,4,1199,4.470319634703197
