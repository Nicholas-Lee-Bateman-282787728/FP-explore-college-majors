The Afghans played a big part in the early exploration of this country. The camel  are still there thriving. There are families living there today related to those early Afghans.
A great movie.",1379894400,,295,4.673076923076923

8243523,5,B001221DT2,"Synopsis: Three spiritual traditions collide in the Australian Outback; Christianity, Islam and the Aboriginal Dreamtime and there point of intersection is within a little girl named Jila. The daughter of an aboriginal Mother and a Muslim Father, but raised in a Christian mission station Jila lives a life of spiritual uncertainty.

Little Jila loses touch with her native roots when taken to live at the Mission when an influenza epidemic comes to the region. After several years of Christian instruction her Father claims his child and she is taken away to be raised in the Muslim faith.

Some years later Johann, her childhood friend from the Mission drops in for a surprise visit at the same moment her arranged marriage is about to be announced. Seeing her displeasure with her husband-to-be Johann attempts to rescue his friend from an unhappy future. Is Johann the answer to her problems or does her freedom lie in her own ability to break free and find her own way?

Critique: I've been fascinated by the aboriginal culture and ""things Australian"" ever since my initial viewing of Nicolas Roeg's classic `Walkabout' in '71 starring David Gulpilil and Jenny Agutter. Since then many other great films exploring aboriginal spirituality and culture have followed; `The Last Wave' (79), `Where the Green Ants Dream' ('85), `Dead Heart' ('97), `Rabbit-Proof Fence' ('02) and `Ten Canoes' ('06) just to name a few.

The '00 release `Serenades' fits in beautifully with the 37 year tradition of insightful and profound Australian films to follow in the lineage of `Walkabout'. The production values are excellent the acting solid and the storyline layered and open ended leaving the viewer to ponder the possible futures that lay ahead for the brave and defiant Jila.",1216425600,6,1769,5.110726643598616
