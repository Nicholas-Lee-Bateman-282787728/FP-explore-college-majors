7908413,5,B00000FCYT,"I saw this film only once -- on CBC television's ""The Passionate Eye"" -- in 1992, but I will always remember it. It was the first time I learned of Nixon's dirty tricks campaigns against Jerry Vorhees and Helen Cahagan-Douglas in the 1940's and the 1950s. There is also some interesting stuff on Nixon's role in the Hiss trial. The film is both irreverant and serious at the same time. I hope and pray that the executors of the de Antonio estate have the good sense of re-releasing this film on DVD.",1149897600,8,499,4.434782608695652
