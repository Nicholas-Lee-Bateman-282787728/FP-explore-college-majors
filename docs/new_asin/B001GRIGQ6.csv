3619067,1,B001GRIGQ6,"I used to watch the old Bowery Boys movies in the theatre so I was pleased to see them available on dvd - what a let down. These films look like they were taken from really rubbish quality old video tapes complete with scratches, blips & jumps - I don't expect movies of this vintage to be perfect but in view of the 3 Stooges box sets that I have bought from you which are brilliant this lapse in quality is a disgrace to Amazon & collectors should avoid being ripped off - hope this helps. I returned my copy for a refund on Feb 8th - it's now Feb 22nd & still waiting. Never again.",1298332800,3,584,4.043103448275862
3619068,5,B001GRIGQ6,"What fun! The Bowery Boys and a haunted house, times 2! Add a bit of the legend Bela Lugosi and you have a night of shivers and laughs!",1238803200,7,135,3.857142857142857
3619069,4,B001GRIGQ6,"This scary comedy double feature contains 2 film with The Bowery Boys (aka The Dead End Kids, East End Kids, etc) running around a haunted house. The first movie features Bela Lugosi at his menacing best. I am reminded of ""Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein"" by these movies and their light and innocent humor. Muggs and the boys are interesting images of what New York youth looked like back then. The rest of the country must have thought that New Yorkers are pretty goofy. Mild shocks and laughs make this a fun DVD to watch in the dark with a bowl of Fiddle Faddle!",1222560000,10,572,4.509615384615385

8306790,5,B001GRIGQ6,"There are two types of people- those that like the East Side/Dead End/Bowery Boys movies and those that don't.
If you fall into the former, then the question becomes - how bad is the print? These are not bad prints, not great, but until somebody ponies up the money to do a professional remaster, it is the best we can get.
If you are a fan, enjoy- if not- save your money",1362355200,,372,4.180555555555555
8306791,5,B001GRIGQ6,It was great to see these movies again.  You cannot find such great acting talent in today's shows.  It is good to see it in the original black and white also.  I plan to collect all of their shows.,1334966400,,198,4.0256410256410255
8306792,4,B001GRIGQ6,I am happy with the product 'cause it's in excellent condition and the delivery came on time. And of course those Boys of the old days are funny without having to hear bad words. You don't see clean movies like in the old days. I'm happy with the movie,1333843200,3,252,4.163265306122449
8306793,5,B001GRIGQ6,"I ordered a copy of this on Amazon after I read some reviews on line. I only remember watching them on black & white TV in the 60's on Saturday mornings so I was used to a few blips and lines in the picture as these are very old movies that have not been restored. Well I read one review by someone who was not happy with it . Well sorry about your luck but I have seen much worse , these films are worth watching. The first one has the patina of a old film but very watchable and what a classic ! Bela plays a great part and it has a twist to the story in the end. The second film almost looks to be restored. It is very clean . I recomend this one !",1320105600,12,651,3.7246376811594204
8306794,5,B001GRIGQ6,"This movie is a classic!  I enjoyed watching as a kid, and now my family and myself enjoy this move over and over again! Excellent scary tale, without the gruesome gore of today's movies.",1319068800,2,187,4.5
