I have fond nostalgic memories of it, but no. I will buy it for $15 for the presence of the adorable Lynn Holly Johnson and a few 80s makeup effects.. This has nothing to do with Alien or Predator.

In the early 1970s NASA was evidently doing some experiments in a space lab that ""could not be done on Earth.""  Then, that space lab crashed in Spain.  Despite the setting, this is just a typical American horror flick that has a few people with accents and an Old World town.

Samantha, Damon (Dennis Christopher; Stephen King's It, Necronomicon: Book of the Dead) and Michael are RV-ing across Spain and they discover that strange things are happening in Duarte.  The town is shockingly empty, the locals are behaving strangely and they encounter the weirdest, evil, red-headed, pod person-Cher waitress ever.

As this--we'll call it a plot--endures, we learn that the Apollo 14 moon mission recovered dormant lifeforms.  Nothing as zany as the rock spiders from Apollo 18 (2011), but pretty heinous.  A NASA scientist, who behaves a lot like a criminal, provides all of the unsensationally ho-hum revelations of the plot.  Basically, the research station crashed, alien life contaminated and mutated the local fauna and people, and they need go to a NASA facility that's in the basement of a Spanish stronghold tat's hundreds of years old in order to get some canister so they can create an antidote to the mutagenic alien DNA.

They really put some effort in the writing for our three protagonists.  The dialogue between these three doesn't feel nearly as stiff as the standard 80s ilk.  Although, all of the other dialogue and acting is awful.

The gore is strong from the get-go.  Loads of guts, little slimy monsters, pulsating and erupting mutations...also, I've never seen a dog get dragged inside of the disemboweled body of an alien-infected bull.  Very cool.

This movie was really quite fun for some random flick I never heard of--I picked it up at a convention horror booth).  I'd retitle this movie The Trouble with Flesh-Eating Tribbles.",1352937600,,1886,5.009646302250804
7809447,3,6301004809,"This film is early 80's sci-fi. It appears to be an independent film of low budget. Their is one scene early on where a cow has been killed by something unseen and when wild dogs are eating it one of them gets sucked into the cow. This is the only exciting scene, everything else is very plain. The story continues on to explain of alien DNA found on the moon was being tested in space on lab animals. The satellite falls to earth crashing in Spain. Over a years time they experiment on the alien DNA until it gets loose and starts killing of the residents of a small town deep in Spain. The movie spends most of the time on useless chatter and rarely gets into exciting dialogue. At the conclusion only a few escape the town moments before an air strike believing they are free from the alien virus and incineration, only to find out they were wrong. The alien kills a store clerk. The film ends there and its up to you to imagine the outcome.",1176854400,5,944,4.279329608938547
7809448,3,6301004809,"While this movie may not be a great sci fi film, it is good if you want a little cheesy fun. Dennis Christopher (Breaking Away and Chariots of Fire), Martin Hewett, and Lynn-Holly Johnson (Ice Castles) star as three California teens who are traveling through Europe for the summer. They end up in Spain where years earlier a NASA space station had crashed landed. The space station contained an alien being who you never see though you hear skitter in the background and has the unfortunate ability to posess people and turn them into pod people. Our young heroes wind up being the only people in the small Spanish town not infected by the aliens and they must save themselves before they become infected as well. The only problem I had with the film is that some of the dialogue seemed like it had been dubbed into English. For example, the scene in which the three Americans are in a small resturant where they meet a man who worked with NASA and tells them about the project, the dialogue doesnt match the movements of his lips.",1115596800,2,1031,4.548387096774194

However if you like cheesy, simple plot, low budget horro films... this one is a good time.",1020038400,2,262,4.531914893617022
