831157,5,6304288883,"This is one of the few videos I will let my kids watch!  It does an excellent job of teaching.  It teaches both the subject matter and object recognition/vocabulary using real photography.

Drawings in animated videos can be hard for inexperienced little ones to recognize--plus my 2-year-old daughter is frightened by animation!  So Baby's 1st Impressions' real videography is far better.

My children love the bright colors, fun movements, good music, and cheerful children.  The videos are pleasing to an adult's eyes and ears, too.

Most of all, kids love the learning!  I've never seen age-appropriate material presented in such a simple, uncluttered, unconfusing video.  My daughter has learned a lot from these videos very quickly!

I really like how they say and show the initial letter, then say and show the object, putting the rest of the printed word onscreen, as well.  Even though they're only teaching letters, not reading, it's nice to subtly include the big picture, too.

I do wish they would do an additional video with lower-case letters, though.  This one teaches only capitals.

Best of all, everything in this series is 100% moral and positive.  No one is dressed immodestly. No one is fighting or crying.  There are no simply no negative lessons hidden in it to create problems where none had existed before.

The target audience (toddlers and preschoolers) should not feel pressured to learn academics yet; they should all still think of learning as a game.  But so many kids' videos and books show a character very frustrated and discouraged while trying to learn new things.  Even if the other characters are trying to help the learner have fun and understand, by showing initial agony, the videos leave the impression that learning is difficult and painful.  That's not so bad if your child is already struggling, but if he's enthusiastic and untroubled, why spoil it?  Babies' 1st Impressions shows kids at all stages of learning just enjoying the process.

(The same thing goes for media which supposedly teach how to overcome fear, or rudeness, or selfishness.  It's great for parents to creatively help a child who's already afraid of the dark.  But introducing masses of unafraid children to the idea of imaginary monsters just may create new problems!  Kids come up with enough challenges on their own without adults introducing everyone else's.  Baby's 1st Impressions doesn't introduce ANY negative scenarios.)

I just wish Baby's 1st Impressions would expand and do the same thing with more complex material marketed to older kids.  Anything needing memorization would work with the same approach.  Cities, states, presidents, the periodic table of elements, anatomy, phonics, math facts-all done in a fun, repetitive, positive manner.  Wouldn't that be great?

I highly recommend Baby's 1st Impressions: Letters.  You won't regret it!",1096502400,9,2872,5.162689804772234
831158,5,6304288883,"I have a home daycare and my 18 month olds are recognizing their letters and saying them!  Before finding the First Impressions videos I used to have 2 year olds barely speaking!  The 18 month olds know their colors and can say them!  They know shapes! And can say them too!  I have Letters, Colors, Shapes and Numbers.
I couldn't go a day without them! They absolutely love them!!",1031443200,,381,4.478260869565218
831159,3,6304288883,"I read all the reviews and was expecting something really great. My 16 month son will watch a couple shows, but shows no interest in this one. It is done nicely, but the music is slow and calm and it just doesn't catch his attention. The children show foam letters at a park and then it goes to letters with pictures of objects that starts with that letter and then it goes back to kids and a park. I think it is a nice addition to your video collection, but don't look for it to teach your kids to read all by itself.",1029715200,,518,4.038834951456311
831160,5,6304288883,"The Baby's First Impression series is very good. I didn't get all of the cassettes, but the best were: Numbers, Letters, Colors and Animals (in that order). This is until the age of two, since I don't know about after that yet.",1015632000,,227,4.428571428571429
831161,5,6304288883,"My mom bought a couple of these for our daughter over a year ago.  Since then we've collected the entire set!  Kids are absolutely glued to them and they learn at an incredible rate.  Our daughter is not quite 2 and has been able to recognize and recite numbers 1-20, the entire alphabet, all of the shapes, colors, animals, signs, and opposites for months!  She's heads and tales ahead of her peers.  I highly recommend these for your kids or as gifts to the kids in you life- they're fantastic!  Your kids will sing and laugh and dance their way to learning- it's effortless!:)",1012003200,,579,4.519230769230769
831162,5,6304288883,"My 23 month old daughter could recognize all of her letters within two weeks of viewing this video.  Although I did not think it was nearly as entertaining as Sesame Street, she did.  She wants to play it endlessly.  She loves watching the babies in the videos.  I love the fact that they use diverse real children interacting with letters in real-life settings.  This sends the message that letters are everywhere.  She is now 24 months old and points out letters when we are in a store or driving down the street.  This video along with the shapes and colors versions are now my new baby shower gifts.",1010188800,,603,4.527777777777778

7866986,4,6304288883,"I thought this was kind of dumb, but my 1-year old thoroughly enjoyed it for over a year. He's over two years old now, but he'd probably still watch it if I popped it into the DVD player.",1382918400,,187,3.9473684210526314
7866987,5,6304288883,My son loves the real life pictures of Kids and items depicting each letter. He follows the actions of the kids in the video. Very few DVDs for kids have real life pictures. Most are cartoon based which he does not seem to like.,1358553600,,228,4.204545454545454
7866988,5,6304288883,"My daughter started watching this video at four months old when she would wake up in the wee hours of the morning wanting to play and I wanting desperately to sleep! i started, just on a whim popping this in for her - and she was RIVETED right from the start. the music, the kids, the colors, all of it just drew her in and kept her attention every night! i went ahead and bought her the whole set of videos! Well, by the time my DD turned 1, she knew and recognized teh ENTIRE alphabet and the SOUNDS (not just surface ABC singing here), not to mention she knew her shapes and colors and numbers to twenty by aroung the same time. well, I was floored!

Since she understood so much, by the time she was 2, I went ahead and got her started with Hooked on Phonics&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Learn-to-Read-Kindergarten-Complete-Amazon-Exclusive-Edition/dp/160499178X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Learn to Read Kindergarten Complete - Amazon Exclusive Edition</a>&nbsp;(I have review on here about it somewhere) - she didn't need any priming because all of the foundation was there - and by the time she was 3 she was reading simple books quite well. by the time she was 4, she was into chapter books! Fast forward to her current age of 7 and she is going into the FIFTH GRADE! I have had to homeschool here because the schools could not keep up with the progress she was making. I can honestly say that having this video series opened up a whole world of potential for my daughter and I have bought the set as gifts for EVERY new family member!",1340841600,,1588,4.816849816849817
7866989,5,6304288883,"ONE OF THE BEST VIDEOS TO TEACH YOUR KIDS THE ALPHABET AND WORDS.  RECEIVED AS GIFT, OUR DAUGHTER LOVES IT AND SAYS THE ALPHABET AND WORDS WITH THE VIDEO.

7866990,5,6304288883,"I can't say enough, my kid freakin loves this video! He loves the whole series actually, but this one has always been his favorite. Forget ""your baby can read"", those videos are so cheesy and boring, this video is just right; not too fast or slow, not overstimulating, no cartoons, only real things and children. This is the perfect video for a baby or toddler! I have already given this out as a gift!",1310083200,,402,4.445945945945946
7866991,5,6304288883,"This video is very straightforward and well thought out: introduce the letter, then objects that start with the letter, with a focus on learning both capital and small forms and the sound.  Scenes associated with each letter focus on the object; there are no other distractions.  There are no muppets, no Elmo, no purple dinosaurs singing.  If you rate everything by whether it was produced by Sesame Street and has tons of great ""WOW"" effects and took a lot of money to produce, this isn't for you (see the reviewer that gave this video a ""3"").",1253404800,3,545,4.65625
7866992,5,6304288883,"My twin sons have had this video since this they were about 6 months old.  Now, at 23 months, they recognize every letter of the alpahabet and are well on their way to reciting the alphabet.  They also know which letters certain words begin with, such as ""A"" for Apple and ""O"" for Owl.  Besides being educational, this video is also entertaining.  They love the music and love the live action.  While allowing children to watch television and videos is a highly controversial topic at the moment, I have never hesitated to show them any video in the First Impressions Line.  They also have Numbers, Colors and Shapes, and have learned an amazing amount from each one of them.",1125273600,3,675,4.630252100840337
7866993,3,6304288883,"This video shows lots of live-action, no still photos.  It begins with kids playing at a playground and then they hold up foam letter pieces and say the letter name.  After the playground they go through each letter.  Here's an example of what they say for the letter D:

""D"" (they show the upper and lower case and say the letter name)

""D, Ducks""

""D"" (showing upper and lower)

""D, Daddy""

""D"" (showing upper and lower)

""D, Dog""

""D"" (showing upper and lower)

After evey 6 letters or so they do a review.  The only thing that could be improved upon is that they could have said the sound of each letter too.  But, Baby's First Impressions is now Brainy Baby and they have a ""Brainy Baby ABC's"" video.  This has much of the same footage of Baby's First Impressions Letters but they do say the sounds of each letter, they also say ""big D, little d"" (instead of just showing the upper and lower case) and they say both sounds for the vowels and for the letters C and G.  But, I have *major* issues with Brainy Baby ABC's because they are not consistent in their sounds and they add the sloppy ""uh"" sound to many of them.  Frankly, Brainy Baby should be ashamed by their ABC video.  Please read my review for that video and you'll read more about it.  Because of this I'd have to recommend Baby's First Impressions over Brainy Baby ABC's.",1114560000,,1339,4.373983739837398
