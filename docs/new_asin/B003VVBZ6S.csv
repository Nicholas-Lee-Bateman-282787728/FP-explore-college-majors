8407120,1,B003VVBZ6S,"The recording of this concert DVD is probably the worst one I've ever seen. The sound quality is awful, the concert recording is worse. You can only watch it in block form and only part of the stage and musicians are visible throughout the concert. It's almost like half of the stage view has been cut off. There was no way to change the view to a full screen. It was so bad, that I could not sit through the entire thing. This was a terrible waste of money.",1353888000,,458,4.157303370786517
