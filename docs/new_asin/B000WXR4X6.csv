The scene of Tamino/Pamina going through the tests almost makes it dramatically convincing--although it takes the energy and joy on Roschmann's (Pamina) face to add the final touch. (A director can only do so much with the limited time the music gives.)

No superlatives are too great for Roschmann as Pamina; the 3 boys are also outstanding--as good as actors as the adults. Beczala as Tamino is new to me; not a great actor, but a clear tone.

Detlef Roth as Papageno is not the funniest I've seen, but that's not a detriment here; the final scene where he meets and plans a family with Le Roi as Papagena is not as erotically charged as some other productions; however, Le Roi is excellent, gazing up at him with love and erotic desire.

Salminen is of course excellent as Sarastro, although I don't know why they put him in that fake enlarged brain.

Dsire Rancatore as the Queen of the Night is young for the role (relative to her ""daughter"" Roschmann), but sings superbly and acts with vigor (especially when limited by a robe that enwraps her arms. The special effects accompanying her appearances are excellent.

Monostatos' body suit is well-designed; he acts well, but seems to run out of energy at the end.

The animals are exceptionally cute, considering their dramatically limited role.

In sum, if you want a traditional staging, this is it.",1228608000,15,2071,6.141868512110727
2993028,5,B000WXR4X6,"I was intrigued about the references to special effects in the two reviews already posted and, as these are features I like to see in movies as well as opera I decided to go ahead and get this version of The Magic Flute. I have had the version from The Metropolitan Opera House for many years and acquired the Covent Garden version as soon as it became available. It immediately became a great favorite of mine and I was impressed by the performances of Simon Keenlyside, Dorothea Roschmann and none more so that Diana Damrau as the Queen of the Night.
I have had the opportunity to view this latest version several times and think that in almost all respects it is a more interesting and enjoyable interpretation to see. I love the clarity of the orchestra, the clever and artistic stage-sets, the special effects, the fantastic (in the true sense of the word) costumes and agree with one of the other reviews that almost all of the singers give truly outstanding performances. I would beg to differ about only one of the singers and that is Desiree Rancatore who, while giving a perfectly adequate performance, is nowhere near as impressive and completely in charge of her role as Diana Damrau. It was also good to see Dorothea Roschmann advance from the smaller part of Papagena (which she did with great comical flair) at Covent Garden to the more substantial role of Pamina in this one.

2993029,5,B000WXR4X6,"This DVD instantly goes to the the top of the list of great DVD MAGIC FLUTES.  This is going to be an easy review because everyone and everything is just right:
1) Tamino-Piotr Beczala is a new tenor to me.  He has a sound that has a little bit of Fritz Wunderlich in him; not always consistent, but it is there none the less.  I cannot imagine anyone singing it any better today.
2) Pamina-Dorothea Roschmann even outdoes her earlier DVD performance with Colin Davis.  She is more involved in this magnificent production.
3) Queen of the Night-Desiree Rancatore is up there with all my favorite Konigins; and I mean Damrau on DVD and Berger, Moser, Deutekom, Popp on CD.  She is just as dramatic as Diana Damrau.
4) Papageno-Detlef Roth has a little of Herman Prey in his vocal color. Great singing and acting.
5) Sarastro-Matti Salminen is just perfect.
6) Conductor-Ivan Fischer one of the great interpretations!
7) Sets & Costumes-truly magical.  A traditional Magic Flute with tons of high tech special effects.  The stage director-Benno Besson and the set designer and costume designer-Jean-Marc Stehle truly get it ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

8226010,5,B000WXR4X6,"This is a beautifully-sung, well-conducted, and well-conceived version. The opera is not simple to bring off completely, as it is a utopian fantasy where the enlightenment dream of paradise on earth is taken seriously.

This production respects each of the characters, and it allows the music to ennoble them all.",1399161600,,313,5.26
8226011,5,B000WXR4X6,"The performance was excellent and exciting.  They took full use of the stage elevators and moved sets and people in and out with alacrity.  Some of the costume choices were strange.  I agree with another reviewer that the simian costume for Monostatos was racially insensitive.  However, making Sarastro into a conehead (ala Saturday night live) did the gravity of his character no favor.  Fortunately Sarastro's head extension did not interfere with the beauty of his splendid bass voice.  The video images were clear.  The Dolby sound was good.  The video direction focuses on the main action with minimal distractions.",1377475200,,621,5.202020202020202
8226012,5,B000WXR4X6,"Finally, a Die Zauberfloete with a real touch of magic!
The staging is imaginative and thoughtful, with good masonic imagery and sumptuous sets, and even with hi-tech effects that compliments the plot well.
Tamino finally looks like a prince, and Pamina a princess (isn't her mother the 'Queen')?  Even the bird-catching duo got a vey decent and likeable set of attire.
I agree with one reviewer that the Moors are rather badly-clad - Monostatos got a rather 'indecent' attire that is fairly criticised as being over the top.
Then the music itself - the vocal cast is generally very fine, with perhaps a slightly weak-link in Roth's Papageno (compared to Simon Keenlyside and Christian Gerhaher).
Rancatore is a competent Queen of Night, but not outstanding in the league of Erika Miklosa (for Abbado), or Diana Damrau (in Covent Garden and Salzburg DVDs). She is a petite and amiable looking Queen, more so than Elena Mosuc for Harnoncourt.
Certainly, however, Roschmann's Pamina has few pears for the past 1.5 decade. With a timbre as beautiful as a flawless diamond, Juliane Banse simply isn't in the same league. In this Paris performance, Dorothea has the added edge of being young and beautiful, cutting a petite and nimble figure on stage in the lovely period costume that gave her Pamina tremendous stage presence. Her shaping of phrases and her musical nuances are simply exemplary.
As Tamino, the now celebrated lyrical tenor Piotr Beczala simply raised the question of why he did not rise to the present fame until the recent 4 to 5 years?
His Tamino has a slow start - the Act 1 Aria could have been given a freer delivery, but as it is, he sung it impeccably.  His true colour comes out fully when he delivers the long accompagnato with the Speaker in the second Act.  With his striking presence and beautiful singing, he is simply the best Tamino of the 21st century, and that is taking into account eminent ones like Christoph Strehl and even Jonas Kaufmann.
Matti Salminen looks surprisingly like Rene Pape in this production.
This would be a very good set for Flute starters.",1347235200,,2092,4.837988826815643
8226013,5,B000WXR4X6,"I recently purchased this DVD having never watched this opera before. To my surprise I enjoyed it tremendously. The unsubtle imagery obviously masonic and bearing quite on the development of the two young lovers. I loved this opera and this particular production for its exploration of more period settings than I would have liked a very, upscale modern milieu for this story to unfold. Since I had no frame of reference on the performances of the principals, I would declare that I loved, loved, loved, Piotr Beczala, who remains my favourite tenor. Jssi Bjrling was my favourite before that so you can imagine the benchmark for greatness I've heaped on this exciting talent in the world of opera and concerts.

I shall keep coming back to watching this production. At the end of listening, I can't help but give a sigh of satisfaction!",1305158400,2,837,4.853146853146853
8226014,3,B000WXR4X6,"This is an excellent traditional performance. It is traditional in staging as well as singing, but it isn't a patch on the marvellous Colin Davis interpretation, where Simon Keenlyside's total performance and Diana Damrau's singing take the opera to unusual heights. Some of the high tech effects are quite good, the birds flying into Papageno's basket, for example.

I have trouble with this opera, speaking as a dark-skinned woman. The opera is openly misogynistic, and I have learned to suppress my knee-jerk reaction to this, but I am rather annoyed that in this production, Monastatos is portrayed as a black man with rather simian features. It seems quite unnecessary to the plot. That gives a racist overlay to a sexist opera! I could be over-reacting.",1240704000,2,759,5.072
8226015,5,B000WXR4X6,"Why do we purchase a DVD copy of an opera? Because opera cannot be fully enjoyed by just listening to the music; we must also delight the eyes, hence the importance of the sets, costumes, and design. This Magic Flute is magical in every way. Not only are the singers in top form, but there is only one exclamation for what the Parisiens have done with the opera stage: WOW! This DVD is exquisite candy for the ears and eyes. If you buy only one or two opera dvds a year, make sure that this is one of them.",1236988800,5,506,4.121212121212121
8226016,5,B000WXR4X6,"This is indeed an enchanting Magic Flute. Does it trump the Colin Davis ROH performance? No, but it is a matter of swings and roundabouts. A major weakness in the Davis set is the Tamino. It is simply not an attractive voice when compared to other Taminos. The Paris Opera boasts a young tenor from Poland, Piotr Bezcala who not only sings well, but is attractive and musical. They both share the same Pamina, Dorothea Roschmann. She is clearly the Pamina that trumps all other contenders. If the voice is not idiosyncratic, it has that wonderful creamy sound that only seems to come from Central Europe. The Papagano is Detief Roth; perfectly satisfactory but Davis has Simon Keenlyside, one of the most charismatic baritones currently singing. Roth doesn't sings badly, it is just that Keenlyside has the voice the looks, the physicality and panache that make for a really great singer; in short he is incomparable. The Queen in the David set is also superior, Diana Damrau. The role is essentially thankless. Mozart provided two of the most difficult arias for a high soprano, a miniscule amount of dialogue and no involvemnt with the other characters. This is not to say Rantore doesn't sing well, but Damrau is clearly the superior technician and being German provides her with an edge. To be frank I would never base my decision to buy a Magid flute on the QofN, but it does end up in the plus column at the end of the day.

The production for thie set is wonderful and quite imaginative and totally traaditional. Which brings me to a comment made by a previous reviewer of this set, mainly that it succeeds because it is French. I have no idea what was meant by this comment. The director (regie) is Swiss, and trained under Felsenstein in East Berlin. the cast is from central Europe. Of course the orchestra is French and the three ladies are French--at least two are. No Paris is simply another house on the main European circuit. There is no more French style; France has provided two artists who have attained ""star"" status, Natalie Dessay and a  wonderful lyric baritone, Ludovic Tessier who deserves to be better known.  The days when the French repertoire was an essential core rather than the ""odd"" man out (Carmen, Manon, Werther, Faust and Pelleas and possibly Hoffman)have long since vanished with the artists who sang it.

The one artist I have not mentioned is the conductor, Ivan Fischer; he favors sprighly tempos on the fast side when compared to Davis. But he is not superficial or glib and he clearly loves this opera; it is simply that he has one eye on the 18th century while using contemporary instruments. Davis takes a  more measured path but at no point do you find yourself wanting Davis to ""get going"". Davis has enjoyed a high reputation as a Mozartian and his Flute does nothing to weaken that reputation.",1229644800,10,2841,4.719758064516129
