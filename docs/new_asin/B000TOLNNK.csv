8210245,4,B000TOLNNK,"Bought this collection for ""Unknown World"" and it is as clear a copy as any I've seen. ""This Is Not A Test"" is an interesting little film but directed very poorly. The other two films are entertaining but I already possessed them. Good collection for an avid sci-fi fan. Price is very reasonable.",1525132800,,296,4.60377358490566

It was something to watch.
Happy I did not have anything else to do that day. :-)",1429747200,,95,3.8
8210247,5,B000TOLNNK,"This is a great addition for your sci-fi collection. It has the best version of ""Unknown World"" bar none and bests the crap out of the Alpha Video release. Also, it has ""This is not a Test"" which is a pretty good print, and I say that lightly.

For the hardly any money, it's well worth it!!!",1399852800,,292,4.12280701754386
8210248,3,B000TOLNNK,"This DIGIVIEW movie 4-fer features two films per side of a flip disc. There's no subtitles or extras beyond plot synopses on the cases's back cover. It's a nifty bargain-priced space-saving collection.

Transfer quality of the unrestored titles on this edition of THE SCI-FI INVASION! is good on all but ""This is Not a  Test,"" which has a soft appearance. Audio levels are superb, some of the highest distortion-free sound you'll find on a DVD, which makes this one ideal for watching on a laptop PC or portable disc player.

SYNOPSES--
THIS IS NOT A TEST - Highlight of the set is this atomic age frighter with a script that would make Rod Serling proud.  Here, a small number of motorists stopped on a mountain road by a 4 AM roadblock learn that a nuclear attack is imminent. They huddle in a big rig trailer and pray for survival.

KILLERS FROM SPACE - Stylish '50s sci-fier starts well then deteriorates into silliness. Peter Graves dies in a plane crash but is revived by aliens with ping pong ball eyes. He's hypnotized into spying for these hostiles who plan to conquer Earth with a menagerie of enormous bugs and lizards.

WASP WOMAN - Laughably cheapish Roger Corman story about a lady exec of a beauty products outfit. Her youth obsession leads to injections of wasp enzyme serum and a campy distaff Jekyll/Hyde result.

UNKNOWN WORLD - Riff on Verne's ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" has a nuclear age twist. Searching for a haven from fallout, a half-dozen scientists ride their weird-looking 'cyclotram' in a burrowing expedition that begins at the mouth of an extinct volcano.

8210249,2,B000TOLNNK,"Found this on the shelves at Wal-Mart.  I so enjoyed the first one for its international flavor and provocative storylines.  This one, however, lacked that intrigue and I soon found I was suffering through the stories and uninspired special effects.  This one was probably not worth the buck I spent on it - unlike the first one.",1189555200,,329,4.7368421052631575
