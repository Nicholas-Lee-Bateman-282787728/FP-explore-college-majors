8139070,3,B000HEVARG,"I found this video at times very interesting but a lot of times very boring, especially when the audience got to ask questions, most of the time you couldn't make out what they were saying. You can learn some but you'll have to sit thru lots of boring lecture nit picking the nuggets.",1349136000,,284,4.377358490566038
8139071,1,B000HEVARG,"As our understanding of human consciousness evolves and develops, several types of people are necessary to bring new ideas and ways of thinking into the mainstream. Some are those who have the original insights, who are able to bring through ways of looking at things that really jolt the rest of us into awakening.

This is not that kind of program.

If what you are looking for is someone to toss around the cool words, and make it seem okay to think those ""far out"" thoughts, maybe you will find this DVD of interest. If you want a lesson in self-promotion, this is definitely your cup of tea.

If you are looking for real substance, keep moving -- there's nothing to see here.",1293494400,,680,4.512195121951219
8139072,5,B000HEVARG,"You will enjoy this dvd.  There is alot of insight on subjects that is hard to find.  Buy this dvd on the subject of quantum, you will be glad you did.",1277769600,2,151,3.838709677419355
8139073,1,B000HEVARG,"I am a spiritual and positive person.  I bought for example Eckhard Tolle's newest book "" A new earth"" and it is great.  I like Wayne Dyer, Toni Robbins, Cource of Miracles, liked ""the Secret"", ""What the bleep do we know I and II"", etc. etc....  This DVD however was so bad that I didn't even finish it and sent it back.  Don't waste your time.",1196553600,3,344,4.166666666666667
8139074,5,B000HEVARG,"While I don't usually write reviews I had to write this for two reasons - first because ""Intention, Belief, Emotion, and Will; Consciousness and The Scientific Basis for Magick and Miracles"" is a ""profound video"". It has insights for both the beginner and the expert. Secondly, I write this in order to respond to ""Anonymous"".. , Anonymity - ah - such a comfort. Why Anonymous ? Afraid Dr. Miller will turn you into a toad?
First, my review.

In Dr. Miller's world of Magick there are no secret handshakes, wishful thinking, or mumbo jumbo there is only the clear, cool, and often scientific information about the process of transformation and the techniques and discipline needed to advance. He shows how one ""becomes Magick"" through practice and study. He defines the process and he reveals secrets that some I think would prefer be kept secret. He is authentic and speaks with the authority of someone who has been there and done it. Dr. Miller recounts some of his lifetime of experiences and anecdotes about the process and how it has manifested itself in his life. In one part he tells a particularly emotional story and the effect on the audience is amazing. In my opinion, Dr. Miller does as much as one can do in ninety minutes and provides an incredibly brilliant flash of insight for any intelligent seeker on the path. I eagerly await his book.

Now for Anonymous.
Anonymous seems to be obsessed with the setting and props. First he says he was ""disappointed"" the video was done in a ""lecture hall."" Look at the description on the cover - it clearly states ""In this 90 minute LECTURE Dr. Miller explores this mysterious energy and the links between ancient wisdom and modern day science""

This ""lecture hall"" by the way happens to be the 8th.""International Conference of Science and Consciousness in which people from around the world attend to hear the top lecturers in the field of which Dr. Miller is one.
Anonymous also says ""the speaker used an overhead projector with sloppily handwritten points""
Einstein used chalk and a blackboard. We're all glad you didn't review E=MC 2. It's content that counts! This review is very unfair. I found the DVD excellent and anyone interested in the subject should get a lot out of it.",1190851200,37,2238,4.777777777777778
8139075,1,B000HEVARG,"Being a lifelong student of metaphysics and occult philosophy, the title of this production intrigued me.  I was very disappointed to see that it was a cheaply produced video done in a lecture hall.  The speaker used an overhead projector with sloppily handwritten points on them.  From the beginning, the points were glossed over, with the speaker reading directly from the slides on many occasions.  Any serious student of magick will find no new information in this video, and in fact will be quite disappointed in the basic and superficial treatment of concepts such as intention and universal law.  Beginners will be confused by the way the information is presented.",1183852800,29,671,5.0636363636363635
8139076,5,B000HEVARG,"This video is profound, and what I'd consider a must watch for anyone studying the way to their highest potential.  It places much focus on the powers of intention at its highest and best, by highlighting the miracles and the mirages of intentionality.

If your spirit is a hungry sponge, soak this one up immediately.",1167177600,23,318,4.763636363636364
