8239609,4,B0010ZDFPQ,"This is a review for a silent western film called THUNDERING
THOMPSON, starring an actor known only as Cheyenne Bill.

THUNDERING THIMPSON was directed by Ben Wilson with a story and script
by Robert Dillon.

The story concerns a cattlemen who complains to the Sheriff that
sheep herders are squatting on his land.  Land that's meant for raising
cattle, not sheep.

The sheriff sends his deputy,Thundering Thompson who soon discovers
that the sheep herders are in reality Marie Valarian and her elderly
father who are not on private land but on open range.

Deputy Thundering Thompson learns that the catleman, Bill Edwards, was
using the apparatus of the law hoping to force the sheep herders to
unload their sheep to him for very little money.  Thundering Thompson
returns back to the sheriff without evicting the sheep herders and this
angers the cattleman who vows to get rid of the sheep on is own
terms using other cattlemen.

Thundering Thompson decides to do everything within his power to
stop them from driving off Marie and her father and he does just that.
The film includes some exciting action sequences mostly involving
Thundering Thompson and the cattlemen and members of their crews.
The fight sequences are done pretty well considering that this is
before the art of movie fighting was really perfected.

And eventually THUNDERING THOMPSON comes to a satisfying climax,
roughly 48 minutes after it started.  I should say 48 action packed
very entertaining minutes. So if a silent western with plenty
of action is your cup of sasparilla, THUNDERING THOMPSON could be the
film for you.
