6065604,5,B00G7QQ1Y0,This movie charms you from the opening credits through the whole movie. Can't wait to have my own copy of it.,1389571200,,109,4.238095238095238
6065605,4,B00G7QQ1Y0,"The title phrase, ""In a world ..."" refers to probably half of all movie trailers ever made. This movie is about that claustrophobic world of voice actors whose job is to record things like ""In a world ...""

And what a world. That handful of vocal specialists form a little culture all their own, with their leaders, their myths and legends - and no women, a true boys' club. Carol (played by Lake Bell) was raised on the edge of that world, a coach and voice actress in her own right, but also daughter of one of the greats of the movie trailer voice-over clique. That sets in motion the two big conflicts. First, there's the war of the sexes, with men not yet ready to cede professional territory to the female interloper. Second, there's the inter-generational conflict, with the paterfamilias not yet ready to cede anything to the generation he sired. It becomes especially brutal when the man/woman and generational tensions appear between the same players.

But, for all that, it's still a comedy. Competitions create high feeling, but never descend to true bitterness. And Carol's voice coaching reaches out to women most desperately in need of it. Good fun, good candidate for a safe date movie.

6065606,5,B00G7QQ1Y0,"I never go to the movies.  (I NEVER TYPE IN ALL CAPS EITHER.)  I just wait to be able to rent or Netflix things that sound interesting, and then I'm almost always somewhat to very disappointed.

This one sounded so good that I could not wait.  I went to the movies.  And then I went again.  And I would have gone a third time, except I paused too long and it was gone.  It is that good.

It's hilarious and sweet and human.  And incredibly well made.  In a RATIONAL world, this would be 2013's Best Picture.  I'm serious.",1389312000,2,521,4.161616161616162
6065607,5,B00G7QQ1Y0,"In a world of sexist jerks and clueless bimbos one woman strives to make us laugh.  This is hands down the best comedy of 2013 and yes I saw The Worlds End and This is the End.  Loved the first, the second was uneven.  Lake Bell give us a charming comedy about a young woman that I think would be a lot of fun to have as a friend.  She is trying to get into the voiceover end of show business and is meeting resistance from all ends including her father who is a legend amongst the voiceover community.  It has some really nice cameos and small parts from very A-list actresses.  There is not a dull moment in the film and I give it my highest recommendation.",1389225600,,659,4.109375
6065608,4,B00G7QQ1Y0,"I'm not sure how this movie got overlooked during this awards season-- it was a wonderful little movie. It was perceptive, witty, and entertaining and despite great critical reviews upon release, managed to still be underrated when it has come time to the big awards shows. I'd highly recommend if you're looking for a quality movie that is as funny as it is smart.",1389052800,15,365,4.71875
6065609,5,B00G7QQ1Y0,"This is a fun, fine movie.  It centers a striving, tense family that sports two generations competing with mixed success in the business of Hollywood movie trailers and voice overs.  We're shown in-your-face male chauvinism and we see it challenged.  We also may be led to wonder about our own tacit complicity as consumers who get motivated by movie trailers.  It's a sociological drama -- family, industry, society -- laced with love and laughs.  Well written and well put together, Lake Bell stars as the the protagonist, writer, and director alike.  Original stuff.  I saw it on the big screen at an art house and I'd be glad to see it again sometime.",1384992000,20,655,4.743362831858407
6065610,4,B00G7QQ1Y0,"""In a World..."" (2013 release; 93 min.) brings the story of Carol (played by Lake Bell), a struggling voice coach trying to break into the fiercely competitive and men-dominated voice over industry for doing movie trailers. As the opening credits roll, we see archive footage featuring Don LaFontaine, the legendary voice over artist for countless movie trailers who coined the phrase ""In a world"". Carol is living with her dad Sam, himself a top talent in the voice over industry. But soon Carol is kicked out so that Sam's 30 yr. old girlfriend can move in (Sam tells Carol ""I'm supporting you by not supporting you"", ha!). Carol moves in with her sister Dani (played by Michaela Watkins). Then by happenstance, Carol is able to land a movie trailer project, much to the dismay of others (""she is the chick who snagged the gig!"" screams one). To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first and foremost, this is the ""Lake Bell show"" from start to finish. In addition to starring, she also wrote, directed and co-produced the movie. And shine she does indeed. oozing charm from start to finish. Even though she's been around quite a long time on TV and in movies, I really hadn't seen much of her, and this movie is for me Lake Bell's grand coming out party. Second, Bell surrounds herself with a lot of great talent, including the already mentioned Michaela Watkins but also Rob Corddry (as Dani's husband) and Geena Davis as the movie producer. Eva Longoria plays herself in a hilarious cameo at the beginning of the movie. Third, this movie is actually funny, as it actually made me laugh! It is rare for a movie to make people laugh out loud, reason why comedies are so hard to make and be successful. Last but not least: this movie is more than just a comedy, with a couple of serious undertones, including ""women empowerment"" (check out the hilarious ""Amazon Games"" parody of ""The Hunger Games""), and the voice over industry itself (why indeed are there no movie trailers voiced by women)?

""In A World..."" made quite a splash at the Sundance film festival earlier this year (it won ""Best Screenplay"" for Lake Bell), and deservedly so. I saw the movie this past August at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati and I was frankly surprised how well attended the screening was when I saw it, as this has gotten little or no marketing push. But that is great news as it turns out that ""In A World..."" is one of those ""little movies that could"". I enjoyed it from start to finish, and would readily recommend that you see this, be it in the theatre or (more likely by now) on DVD/Blu-ray.",1384300800,51,2702,4.615384615384615

It wasn't what I expected at first and it was slightly slow at the beginning. However, within about a half hour I was hooked in by the characters. I was pleasantly surprised by how funny it was at times and quirky. I really enjoyed the overall plot and how the characters grew through out.

6065637,5,B00G7QQ1Y0,"I was slightly hesitant about watching this comedy film, but am glad it turned out better than expected. A couple reasons. First, I could relate to the overall premise of the film in that you're always going to be subject to someone or something else unless you take charge of your life and grab hold of the opportunities that are floating around you. Second, I thought the production and acting within this film was flawless in that it portrayed the average human's struggle to survive in the cutthroat world we all live in. Third, I noticed that this film had little nuggets of wisdom scattered within thereby making it more enjoyable to watch outside of its funny moments. Overall, I highly doubt that if you watch this film in its entirety that you will be displeased though I may be wrong because that's my opinion.

6065639,5,B00G7QQ1Y0,"Lake Bell nails it on every count-- writing, directing and starring.  As Carol Solomon, voice coach, she races around recording strangers' voices in all accents and dialects to replicate them for herself and her students. But she wants a whole lot more. She wants to be that commanding narrator's voice in the movie trailers. Her dad Sam (Fred Melamed) is the current king of this male-dominated industry of voice acting. And now a contest is mounted with the ultimate goal of winning the role of the voice in a new epic quadrilogy.  All will compete in their attempts to reproduce that deep, rich, resonating, reverberating, thunderous phrase that sounds like it originates from the Lord himself. That phrase was actually coined by the famous narrator, Don LaFontaine, and it punctuates countless movie trailers. It is ""In a world... "" , and that phrase is the genesis of this wonderfully funny and smart film, loaded with some of the best comedic talent.  Enthusiastically recommend.",1491955200,4,985,5.030674846625767

She's also going up against her father's prot&eacute;g&eacute;, but they don't know that until the winner gets the job.

6065797,5,B00G7QQ1Y0,"Lake Bell plays Carol, a voice coach who, through good timing and luck, breaks into the male dominated voice over industry. She soon discovers that she has entered a competitive and unwelcoming business that wants to keep the status quo. Her early good fortune is met with resistance and she must rise to prove everyone wrong, including her own father.

That is probably the IMDB version of what this movie is about, but that would be selling it very short. This movie has an awkward charm to it. It deftly touches on themes of family, sexism, marriage and new love, while almost always being funny. The performances from Rob Coddry, Michaela Watkins and Lake Bell are understated, but so right. And this movie made me a fan of Lake Bell.

If you are looking for a movie to watch with your wife that won't make you want to claw your eyes out, In A World won't disappoint. It is a funny and sincere movie that departs from the romantic comedy formula and becomes something much more engaging. I truly enjoyed this movie.",1445990400,2,1019,4.593406593406593
6065798,5,B00G7QQ1Y0,"This quirky little movie really surprised me.  It was written and directed by Lake Bell, who also plays the lead, Carol.  But it has the unreheared freshness of a Christopher Guest mockumentary.  The casting is superb, the dialog earnest and often hilarious, and the characters each enhance the story line.  I felt a lot of empathy for Carol, her sister, her too-shy-to-say-how-he-feels coworker (and a great job by Demetri Martin), and even her overbearing but forgiving father (played by the always-wonderous Fred Melamed).  Highly recommended movie.

Lake Bell and crew have created a wonderful movie that seems to address some of the most urgent issues of our time, such as equal rights, misogyny, male posturing, mumbling, vocal fry, and award shows. Ms. Bell's performances on multiple levels floored me. If you find squeaky, vocal fry, valley girl vocals annoying this movie will make you chuckle. Amazing they can still make an awesome film and there is not one ""gun scene"".

6065871,3,B00G7QQ1Y0,"IN A WORLD is a somewhat entertaining indie film, but I can give it only 3.5 out of 5.0 stars.  The cast members give earnest performances and the production values are good for a relatively low-budget film.  But the plot puts too much emphasis on unpleasant, poorly-developed personal relationships and too little on the film's special setting -- the very small ""world"" of the voice-over artists who work in the film, television, and advertising industries.

Thousands of movies depict the troubles between parents and children or between siblings.  Even more emphasize budding romances between co-workers.  IN A WORLD is among them.  But how many movies show us about how voice-overs and sound effects that are carefully and powerfully crafted into films, TV shows, and advertisements are made?  IN A WORLD is unique and special because it attempts to do this. Unfortunately and quite disappointingly, it quickly devolves into a conventional story of family and workplace relationships that we've all seen so many times before.  Its special opportunity to show us the world of voice-over work is buried by a bunch of father-daughter-sister-coworker relationship nonsense.  To add insult to injury, the relationships in this particularly movie themselves seem simplistic if not cartoonish.

Films such as THE PLAYER, FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION, and THIS IS SPINAL TAP prove that movies about the often unflattering inner workings of the entertainment industry while still having a interesting characters and a captivating, humorous story arc can be made.  Sadly, this is not one of them.",1440633600,2,1584,5.321285140562249

I liked the main character, she was a hard worker who was very much aware of her own geekiness.  It was a good screenplay. I thought the story was very clear.

Entertaining as hell for a subject that would seem to be so mundane (though real talent lives there) that no one else that I know of has ever done a movie with this as the background - voice over for media.

Based on what I saw, Lake Bell could create an entertaining film about your life, with it's highs and lows, mundane and exceptional.

6066109,3,B00G7QQ1Y0,"The Geico commercial  with the classic opening line "" In a world"" is one of my favorite TV commercials ever.  Even though the advertisement is clever, the voice of Don Lafontaine acts as  a special sauce to make it unforgettable. See it and you will know what I mean.
The voice over industry does not get a lot of recognition  but without the voices of these people what would the movie previews or advertisements sound like. It is also an industry that is male dominated and this is why the movie In a world is relevant because it highlights the struggle of a female voice over trying to get a foothold in a male dominated industry.

Carol Solomon ( Lake Bell), is a vocal coach and is competing to land a gig  to be the voice for the preview of the film called Amazon Games, her competitors are Gustav Warner ( Ken Marino), an industry veteran and her own father Sam Sotto ( Fred Melamed) .
Lake Bell who also directed the film keeps the proceedings simple and sharp. The presence and glimpses in the life of Carol's sister (Michaela Watkins) and brother-in-law (Rob Corddry) make the film watchable and so is the romance that Bell has with her recording friend.
The film is fun to watch and the final few minutes sets things straight for the audience. A very good directorial debut from Bell and just can't wait to see her next film. Three stars. Jan 20th 2013

Even in the end, her character's triumph is generated as much by the guy who wants to date her as by her own talent. It's disappointing to me that this wasn't a movie about a woman overcoming sexism by dint of her own strength, but rather it's a film about a lame chick who happens to be in the right place at the right time with the right set of pipes.

It's about a woman who hits it big in a male dominated industry, much to the annoyance of the men who dominate it. As a father with a daughter, it's refreshing to see a movie with a strong independent woman as the lead character.

It looks and feels like a lower budge indie film.....because it's a lower budget indie film. But the story is interested, creative, and funny! And the acting is very well done. All the characters are totally believable in their roles.

Lake Bell wrote, directed, produced, and stars in the movie as the lead character. This film was her personal project and you can really see the love that was put into making it.

Then, when we got no real character development, the story let them flourish. I actually preferred the middle act because it was the most entertaining and relied on real human interaction. What bothered me was the ""Peggy Sue"" theme.

The final act was superfluous. Daddy issues resolved and solved, and then we can move on with the relationship.

6066250,3,B00G7QQ1Y0,"""In A World..."" is a comedy that takes place in the fairly specialized world of voice over artists who narrate film trailers, do product advertisements, and read copy for radio. The title as it makes evident in the opening credits originated with Don LaFontaine, a prolific vocal artist whose voice appeared in thousands of trailers and countless ads. Carol (Lake Bell) is a freelance vocal/dialect coach living on her dad's couch. Her income isn't stable and she doesn't make enough money to live on her own. Sam (Fred Melamed), a successful voice over artist in his own right who's being honored with a lifetime achievement award, kicks her out of his house perhaps out of misguided tough love and so he can move in his girlfriend Jamie (Alexandra Holden). She moves with in her sister Dani (Michaela Watkins) and brother-in-law Moe (Rob Corddry). Through a series of events and coincidences, Carol begins to get steady work doing voice overs for children's films and romantic comedies. She learns that ""In A World..."" as a line is being resurrected for a new female YA book-turned-movie franchise called The Amazon Games and she will be considered for the job. Carol ends up competing against Sam and Gustav Warner (Ken Marino), another up-and-coming vocal artist and her father's would-be protege for the job of voicing this franchise's new trailer.

This was an OK but ultimately unsatisfying comedy. Lake Bell is funny and very charming and this film has some amusing scenes, but Lake's character is a clumsy, unorganized ditz who spends most of the time walking around in sweats, baggy shirts and overalls. She's a woman trying to make it in a man's world while dressing like a slob. Her onscreen sister played by Michaela Watkins works at a luxury hotel in a concierge role and dresses more professionally than her. Her onscreen dad played by Fred Melamed is a petty misogynist who's driven more by lust for a younger woman than any desire to help his daughter. He even becomes jealous when Lake Bell's character starts finding work. I understand that the Lake Bell character and sister are supposed to have a complicated relationship with their dad but it seems like weak stereotyping with a non-supportive male in a female-centered comedy  . There's also a pro-feminist message at the end but it feels tacked on, more of an afterthought. I saw the trailer for this movie and it looked really funny. I was hoping for a lot more, a  satirical look at an industry many people don't know much about but have had a lot of contact with since many of us watch film trailers and see advertisements in movie theaters and beyond.",1419984000,,2629,4.837777777777778

Such a gentle portrayal, in such contrast to the typical Hollywood melodrama, was a welcome highlight.  The main character was lovable and gullible and served in the role of an Everyman who is at the mercy of familial affection--or lack thereof--and of the negative and positive aspects of gender inequality.  The real victory in this story is that of her own personal growth and strength of character, despite the obstacles put forth in the plot.

6066409,4,B00G7QQ1Y0,"My wife and I found this film very funny.  One of the yard sticks that we use to measure a comedy is how many comic scenes we revisit the next day.  We found ourselves quoting or describing scenes from ""In a world"" at least 10 times with accompanying chuckles. Of course, there were dramatic scenes, so this isn't a typical brainless television style comedy.  Much of the comedy comes from the complex relationships between the daughter (Carol, played by Lake Bell who also wrote and directed) and her father (Sam, played by Fred Melamed, just looking at him makes me laugh).

For example, in one scene, Sam who is dating Jamie (played by Alexandra Holden), a woman younger than his daughter, pulls up in a Corvette to give his daughter a ride to a party.  But, Jamie is already in the passenger seat.  So Carol is forced to squeeze into the space behind the only two seats in the car to ride to the party.

6066486,3,B00G7QQ1Y0,"This low-budget production was my first introduction to Lake Bell, the star of the film.  It seemed like a ""chick flick"" and I wasn't sure I was going to find it interesting, but it surprised me with what seemed like honest emotions, realistic situations, an interesting plot, good acting, great dialog and cinematography that was well-done without being in the way.  The centerpiece is supposed to be her competition with her own father in the cutthroat world of voiceovers--but then, what part of Hollywood ISN'T cutthroat, and even what business anymore isn't cutthroat?  Anyhow, the story is more interesting and complicated than that.

Fred Melamed plays her father, the current King of voiceover since its founding father passed away.  Demitri Martin plays Louis, another reigning champion in voiceover, still in intense competiton with her father as well.  Michaela Watkins plays Carol's (Lake Bell's) sister Dani, and Rob Corddry, in a performance he still manages to make funny, plays sister Dani's husband.  Plenty of other characters appear, including a cameo appearance by Eva Longoria, playing herself, in an imaginary film role in which she blew the accent and Carol/Lake Bell's job is to teach her how to do the accent right in a voiceover...

To say much more would be to ruin what's left of the plot but it raised lots of genuinely awkward situations: parents re-bonding with someone approximately old enough to be your brother or sister; the awkwardness of being an adult having to live with a sibling and their spouse, witness their arguments and problems more than you'd prefer; sleeping with someone you later find out is a competitor, and the film still it manages to pull out a happy ending.  It's a decently-done, honest drama, perhaps mainly about the problems of young women making it in the world of business.  PS: Rated R, presumably for references to sexual activity, drug use and some swearing.  Decent amusement especially as a rental.",1416787200,,1966,5.055727554179566

6066556,4,B00G7QQ1Y0,"Lake Bell does a good job writing about the subtleties of a dysfunctional creative family.  The opening scene pretty much sets the tone when you see the patriarch walk into his LA-area home in a chocolate brown velour warm up suit and announce to his slacker daughter that she needs to move out because his girlfriend (who happens to be slightly longer than the daughter) is moving in later that day.  The world of Hollywood voice overs provides a framework for an examination of the emotional tug of war between the daughter, her sister and their father in all of their emotionally stunted glory.  Demetri Martin is perfectly cast as a clumsy love interest, Ken Marino is also quite good as the arrogant, overprivileged antagonist and Fred Melamed is very funny as the perpetually self-absorbed father.  Michela Watkins expands her one dimensional role as the harried sister and manages to flesh out her character with the help of Rob Corddry as her apparently meek, but sage, husband.  Not a deep or complex movie, but very enjoyable with a lot of great lines and quick emotional zingers that don't come off as cheap or formulaic.  I am very interested to see what Lake Bell shows us in her next creative project.",1416182400,,1215,4.761904761904762

This movie is while mostly just a chick flick I think it's very underrated. Maybe seven out of ten at worse but no less and if you're interested in feminist mumbo jumbo than you might like it even more! Now as for the 'feminism' angle I don't think the strongest statement was made by the main character or even her job at the end (though taken by this male perspective that career swing was really good!). The part that stood out to me by FAR was the girlfriend. At first I was like my that is the most logical and sensible, the BEST character, its just too bad she plays the part of a gold digger. I just can't say enough, and the speech she made at the end, short and to the point IMO one of the greatest female characters I've seen in a long time. I just think she outshined this movie and she was a relatively minor character too! I just can't say enough about the directing here!

Script writing though now that was bad. Could the romantic situations in this movie be any more generic? You have no hint of a feminist spin till the very end (well maybe a hint cuz I guessed it could go in that direction and it did) just not impressed it had a feeling of having no real focus.

6066644,5,B00G7QQ1Y0,"I hope you're lucky enough to see this movie - stream it on Amazon for free if you're a Prime member. Best movie in our house this year, mainly for the simple enjoyment of the characters that told the story.

The casting, the acting, and the writing are all great. Why? The choice of actors didn't focus on big names (to me), but on people more concerned about the role. The acting was witty and consistent throughout. The writing was true to real life, with uncomfortable elements of conversation, and, yes, people talking over one-another at times (which some viewers did not like, but I found it genuine).

This was the first time I can recall seeing Lake Bell. Was she great or am I just enamored with the resemblance to Amanda Peet? That comparison is more than striking. It seemed that she and Michaela Watkins truly were sisters, given their brilliant, somewhat confrontational, and I'm-there-for-you-when-it-really-matters interactions.

Other things I enjoyed:

-Terrific sound mixing! Quite unexpected surround greatness.

-1.5 hours told the story, and they didn't drag it out

-No chase scenes or killings to hype the story

-Not social commentary, just fun (other reviewers disagree)

-Bit-part roles added, not distracted (neighbor, office staff)",1415577600,,1260,5.142156862745098

This film emphasizes that. while making the voice pivotal to the development of this film's plot (Almodovar's film didn't.)

My favorite place for listening to an interview (burned to CD from a podcast) is my car. It's just me and the voice or voices. There is nothing more intimate, in my opinion - even reading powerful lines does not compare to hearing them spoken.

This was a gem if you are interested in history of ""the Voices"" who you've heard thousands of times for movie trailers, car ads, etc.  This movie is fictional and portrays a three-way competition to voice an upcoming blockbuster  Movie Trailor (Think ""Hunger Games"", etc.) by three  giants in the voice over business.  One competitor is at the end of his career, another is younger, up and coming and the last is a young, quirky female).

The title, ""In a World"", is based on a real, legendary Voice star who introduced thousands of movie trailers.  He is a highly respected person who elevated the Voice over to a new level of fame, attraction and monetary gains.

These Voice Artists are amazing!  They can knock off just about every accent in the world plus every celebrity's speech..  The plot is fictional but is amazing, fun, and quite engaging and emotional.  It's a small time investment to watch and you are rewarded with a movie that is fact based yet great entertainment .

It's a hoot.  In the same vein, I also recommend ""Muscle Shoals"", ""20 Feet from. Stardom""' ""Catfish"".

This movie had very little to do with that ""World"", it was instead the story of a whiny spoiled brat who can't seem to notice the only thing holding her down is her own horrible attitude despite the fact that she has massive opportunity right in front of her. This seems to be the theme for Lake Bells entire generation thou so maybe it will play well with them. Beyond the whining of a spoiled girl the pacing of this movie is horrible and despite the fact that the movie has a decent amount of talented actors their talents are wasted with a bad script and terrible directing.

But wait, she Wrote and Directed this? and it's her DEBUT??? This has to be one of the strongest comedy debuts coming out of hollywood in a long time. And i'm going to avoid being sexist by not lingering on the fact that this is a rare feat for a female filmmaker/comic to boot.
The story is light, but well executed. The characters are well rounded for the most part. The sub plots are charming. The setup is quite original and engaging. And it's funny enough to make you laugh out loud. After all, he tried to put the tip in.

6066868,5,B00G7QQ1Y0,"It's an indie flick written, produced, directed, and starred in by Lake Bell as she tries to show us something new. Lake Bell directs us to an obscure, cut-throat corner up in Hollywood, and it's the one inhabited by egotistical voice-over performers. Say, you may not know Don LaFontaine, but odds are that you'd heard his voice many times before in any one of 5000 movie trailers. He's that mellifluous hombre who coined the catch phrase ""In a world..."" In the highly competitive voice-over industry, Don LaFontaine was THE top dog. And when he died, imagine the feeding frenzy left in his wake.

31-year-old Carol Solomon (Lake Bell) is a struggling freelance dialogue coach forever languishing in his father's shadow. Doesn't help that she still mooches off him by living in his home. Her dad is the celebrated Sam Sotto (Fred Melamed), now the world's leading voice-over talent with LaFontaine's passing. Sam is sort of a jackh01e, conceited, boastful, dismissive, not at all interested in nurturing her daughter's try in his specialized profession. Sam is deep into that stage in his life where he's taking on trophy girlfriends. And things have gone on swimmingly enough with the latest ""window dressing"" that he kicks Carol out of his ""crash pad."" He tells his daughter: ""I'm gonna support you by not supporting you.""

Sam is passing the torch to Gustav (Ken Marino), an up-and-coming voiceover talent. And it's in their scenes - lots of old boy networking in steamrooms - where you get a sense of how much of an uphill battle Carol is fighting. Still, little by little, Carol starts landing these modest voice-over gigs until, finally, these continued job offers pit her in a head-to-head competition with her father.

In A World... won Best Screenplay at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival, and it's a fine day when them high muck-a-mucks are in agreement with low brow peeps like you and me. In A World... is a wonderful screwball indie satire. It has stuff to say about the power of voice and the baggages we carry when it comes to who we choose to listen to. The movie has stuff to say about how we utilize our voice in the art of conversation to shape our identities. We're conditioned to these powerful male voices selling us movie premises. But then there's the soothing female voice embodying the GPS in our vehicles and the PA/navigator in our Apple devices.

***Possible SPOILER in the next paragraph***

At first I thought it superfluous, the inclusion of the B-arc revolving around Carol's conscierge sister, Dani (Michaela Watkins), and her husband Moe (Rob Corddry). But then we note how the power of voice - in this case the confident, charming Irish voice of the sister's client - can crumble a solid marriage. In the film's most telling, most emotional scene, Dani confides to Carol what her marriage means to her. Words are a creative force, but they can also undermine and destroy.

I don't think I've gone over how funny this movie is. I mentioned it was ""screwball,"" and I meant it. Lake Bell as ""Carol"" is delightful and warm and charming and neurotic. She consistently puts herself into these demented situations, whether it's trailing and recording accented folks or being party to perhaps the world's most awkward seduction scene. But there's also equal attention paid to witty, observational humor. Lake draws plenty of humor from her characters' interplay. Family dysfunction is still a dependable gold mine for snark.

I'm so glad that Alexandria Holden isn't relegated to just playing the dumb trophy girlfriend. That character, it turns out, has moxie and heart when it counts. But the film's secret weapon is Fred Melamed who is brilliant here. Melamed has a fantastic voice and the acting chops to convey Sam Sotto's larger-than-life swagger. What else? Eva Longoria has an early cameo. Geena Davis' cameo punctuates the narrative by providing that balancing somber note of reality to what otherwise is an upbeat ending.

The DVD's bonus stuff:

6066871,4,B00G7QQ1Y0,"""In a World..."" is in some ways a hackneyed indie drama with the requisite quirky characters and angst, but this one takes us into the world of voice artists, whom we hear all the time and never see. Carol Solomon (Lake Bell) is a struggling freelance voice coach and daughter of lifelong voice artist Sam Soto (Fred Melamed), who will soon be receiving a lifetime achievement award for his work. Sam is less than encouraging to Carol professionally, and she is forced to move to her sister Dani's (Michaela Watkins) couch when her father's young girlfriend Jamie (Alexandra Holden) moves in. By serendipity, Carol is asked to do a short job while in the studio coaching Eva Longeria. Her work attracts the attention of the producers of an upcoming movie quadrilogy, and Carol finds herself competing to be the voice on the trailer with her father, his slick protg Gustav Warner (Ken Marino), encouraged by Lewis Parker (Demetri Martin), an audio engineer who has a crush on her.

Lake Bell wrote, directed, and stars in ""In a World..."". The title refers to the world of voice artists as well as to a line that made the career of a famous voice. The cast are all good, but the film does feel self-consciously quirky. The lead, Carol, is a little annoying and not easy to root for. Her junior-high-level awkward flirtation with Lewis is also a motif that's been well-explored in indie dramas. I like the movie, though, because Sam Soto's unabashed chauvinism is funny. He can be full of himself and dreadfully insecure without being a bad guy. And Jamie is allowed to be a dumb blonde trophy girlfriend who is self-possessed and down to earth at the same time. I don't know why the marital drama between Dani and husband Moe (Rob Corddry) is in there, but I didn't mind it. And the peek inside the world of voice artists is fun. Eva Longoria and Cameron Diaz have cameos, and Geena Davis has a small part. The movie is a pleasant spin on familiar themes.

6066876,4,B00G7QQ1Y0,"We all love a good movie voice over and there are even awards for the deepest most sensuous baritone delivery of a plot synopsis designed to reel in the punters. This film is based on that. A female voice coach is struggling to make her way in a male dominated industry; worse still her father is now the leading `voice' after the retirement of the guy who coined the phrase we have all heard a hundred times ...'in a World ....etc'.

Still undeterred she goes for an audition for the latest teenage blockbuster film and only lands the gig. Hence parental disapproval and the first cracks appearing in an industry that could only really work if you had a voice deep enough to give Barry White a run for his money. What ensues is a genuinely funny and touching story.

Written by, directed and starring Lake Bell as the heroione Carol - who has to be applauded for being able to make a comedy that is both sophisticated and will appeal to both sexes in a sensitive yet very amusing way.

6066932,4,B00G7QQ1Y0,"Lake Bell is a pretty exciting new face in the actor/writer/director triple-threat department, and ...IN A WORLD is clearly a fine example of bringing a lot of talent to bear, and a very solid first film.

Set against the incredibly cutthroat world of voice-over performers, Carol (Bell) is scraping by as a VO trainer to other more recognizable people, and trying very hard to compete in an extremely male-dominated field. When an opportunity to bring back the most recognizable phrase in modern movie trailer history, the grand ""In a World..."" opening, Carol finds herself competing primarily against her increduously egotistical father (Fred Melamed) and his equally egotistical protege, and Carol's one-night lover Gustav (Ken Marino) all while navigating through the fracturing marriage of her sister (Michaela Watkins) and her husband (the wonderful Rob Corddry) and the romantic inclinations of her co-worker (Demitri Martin).

The film lives and dies by its quirky charms, which exist more often than not, and illustrating the difficulty of a young woman trying to break into a male-dominated profession is something that is an important story. Although, the biggest problem I had was the film, at times, felt too fractured under the weight of all the different stories it's trying to tell. It's something of a family drama, a romantic comedy, an inspirational against-all-odds tale, and a quirk-filled indie delight all at the same time, and it makes the whole experience a little uneven, especially in its 93-minute run time. However, the film never gets too bogged down or tries to be a ""message"" film. Bell does a very good job of keeping it light and breezy and fun, if not always hilariously funny. While Bell is the star, the performance that most impressed me was that of Corddry, who got to play with his vulnerable side rather than the consistently obnoxious characters he's been featured in films like HAROLD AND KUMAR GO TO GUANTANAMO BAY and HOT TUB TIME MACHINE.

IN A WORLD isn't a film on the same level as recent indie breakthroughs like DON JON, THE SPECTACULAR NOW or SHORT TERM 12, but it's a very good start for someone with Bell's obvious talents both in front of and behind the camera.",1402272000,,2216,5.0

The premise is of Lake Bell's character trying to break into the male dominated world of voice-overs, which is currently dominated by her father. I'll leave the plot at that.

It's not particularly suspenseful where the plot is concerned or going, but the joy is in the journey and Bell really fills the film with interesting subplots and entertaining characters. And I'll say the film sacrifices spectacle and drama when it could have them at times, instead opting for real reactions and emotions. It just felt genuine, and I appreciated that.

It's a cute film that's a good first step towards Bell's hopefully continuing directorial career. Good date night movie, or just in general a solid film. I liked it a lot.",1401667200,,830,4.7972027972027975

6066999,4,B00G7QQ1Y0,"I had never really thought about it before, but by just watching the trailer for this movie about trailers -- kind of ironic -- it made me realize that, yeah, how come women never do movie trailer voice overs?  Is it really that men are better suited for this profession than women, just like Geena Davis seems to imply here in a nice little cameo?  Or is it that people just haven't thought about women doing voice overs before, just like me, and so women don't get the chance?

Well, no matter.  The star here -- Lake Bell -- who gives a very nice understated performance, shows that perhaps she can easily do voice overs.  She reminds me of a toned-down Sarah Silverman in a way, and this film reminds me of something that Ms. Silverman would do, with perhaps a little Woody Allenesque camerawork here and there.  (Note a scene where a husband and a wife are in an apartment, separated by a wall, where one camera is used in a mildy-lengthy shot.)

I really liked this film a lot.  It's very funny, and I think that perhaps the best work went all the way back to the writing of the screenplay.  It may have been even earlier than that, where someone just had the idea.  He -- or she -- just sat around probably and thought, ""Wow.  How come women don't do trailer voice overs anyways?"" and the idea for the initial screenplay was probably born.  I also liked the cast, as most of the well-known stars really just do cameos, and the rest of the cast -- no slouches, mind you -- do excellent jobs themselves but never seem to get in each others' way.

I'll go with a pretty big recommendation on a surprisingly thought-provoking film that makes fun of the film business itself.  ""In a World. . ."" shows that, just maybe, it might be OK to bite the hand that feeds you.",1397779200,,1768,4.350609756097561

6067013,4,B00G7QQ1Y0,"IN A WORLD is set in the hitherto unexplored world of voice-over artistes; those people who are always heard announcing film trailers whose identities are seldom revealed.  Carol (Lake Bell) is struggling to make a living in the shadow of her father Sam's - stage name Sotto's (Fred Melamed's) reputation.  Hitherto the voiceover market has been dominated by male artistes, with Gustav (Ken Marino) seeking to challenge Sotto's position.  By accident Carol manages to obtain a high-profile gig at Gustav's expense, and from then on she is set on the road to voiceover stardom.  Needless to say her male rivals are outraged by this subversion of what they perceive as the 'natural' - i.e. patriarchal - order of things, and try to unseat her, even though Sotto is initially unaware of the female rival's identity.  IN A WORLD makes some neat satirical points about the inflated egos of voiceover artistes, who in their way are equally as prima-donna-like as any other performers, even though they spend their time having to teach better-known actors how to speak properly.  There's a neat scene in the film where Carol is shown trying to teach Eva Longoria how to speak cockney, a difficult task at the best of times.  Nor does director Bell - who also wrote the screenplay - give us the pleasure of a wish-fulfilling ending: Carol is shown returning to her first love of teaching young women how to pronounce better, so that they may advance their careers.  Voiceover artistes do not necessarily have to restrict their professional focus to the movie world.,  The script is both sharp and witty, with good supporting performances from Demetri Martin as a sound engineer trying to declare his love for Carol, and Rob Corddry as a long-suffering husband.",1397001600,,1752,4.931972789115647

6067130,4,B00G7QQ1Y0,"Lake Bell, perhaps best known as a television soap opera actress and second banana in sexy film romcoms, takes her first shot as a film director and hits the bulls eye.  She also wrote the screenplay and plays Carol in the film.

Carol is a voice coach who is currently tutoring Eva Longoria (other stars have cameos throughout the film).  After the death of the long time star of movie trailer voice-overs (Don LaFontaine), Carol's dad Sam (Fred Melamed) has risen to the top.  Carol still lives at home as her career doesn't provide steady income.  Sam has struck a romantic relationship with Jamie (Alexandra Holden), a 30 year old woman about the same age as Carol.  Sam wants Carol to move out, so she checks in with her sister Dani (Michaela Watkins) and her husband Moe (Rob Corddry).

Looking for a change, Carol decides to audition for a 4 movie series of trailers about Amazon women gleaned from graphic novels.  To everyone's surprise, she gets the gig now entering the rarefied air that her father breathed along with rising star Gustav (Ken Marino).  Initially unaware that Carol got the job, Sam has moved on and Carol has a one night stand with Gustav.  Once they realize Carol got the job, the two misogynists decide to go for it as well.

What makes this film a bit different is certainly the writing and Ms. Bell charisma.  The interplay between the characters is all very natural sounding.  The story isn't terribly complicated, although there is an interesting subplot with Moe and Dani that Carol helps resolve.  I smiled throughout this film and laughed out loud on occasion.  Highly recommended.

The Sony Blu ray disc is in 1080p with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  It looks very good but does look a bit soft on occasion.  The colors are accurate and black levels good.  It just doesn't jump out the viewer.  Generally the transfer is well-defined and has good detail.  No complaints.  The audio is also very good coming with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track.  With ""voice"" the primary heart of the story, when the characters speak, it comes across loud and strong.  When Sam uses those low bass tones from his voice, I swear I heard the subwoofer go into action.  Clear, consistent and effective.  Subtitle options include Spanish, French and English SDH.  Extras include an audio commentary by Ms. Bell, 9 deleted scenes, a gag reel, ""In A World"" promos and some previews.",1393286400,,2391,4.72639225181598

6067155,5,B00G7QQ1Y0,"I used to work in radio, the voice over industry is essentially the same thing. So I get the inside humor in this film, but lacking that it is still a funny look at the lives of a family and coworkers in a show-biz industry.

The story follows two adult sisters, whose father is a world famous voice artist that does commercials and movie trailers. One daughter is a hotel concierge the other is a voice coach and VO artist like her father.

Dad is an older obese guy with a fantastic voice leading that industry after the passing of Don LaFontaine who wrote the book on voicing movie trailers with his God's brother-like voice. Dad is dating a woman close to the age of his younger daughter.

An opportunity to voice the trailers for an upcoming series of movies attracts several of the films main characters, all of whom think they are the best one for the job. Enter the battling egos. Hilarity ensues.

My personal favorite moment in this film is when the star is in a street level foyer on her cellphone as a young girl walks past on the sidewalk looking for a place to get a smoothie, their chance meeting dialog has me laugh so hard my sides ache.

6067159,2,B00G7QQ1Y0,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

 'In a World...' refers to the clichd opening line in countless movie trailers performed by the master of voice-over artists, Don LaFontaine, who died in 2008. Whether LaFontaine himself would have liked 'In a World...' (the movie), a comedy about the voice-over movie trailer industry, is a matter of conjecture. Certainly it's an original concept but does it sustain itself over the entire 93 minute running time?

'In a World...' derives most of its humor from a new trend in American comedy: the observation of the passive-aggressive type. Not unlike such independent films as 'Cyrus' or the mainstream hit, 'Bridesmaids', the passive-character constantly is unable to say 'no' and is so afraid of displeasing others, that they constantly cave into the demands of those who they actually dislike. Often these passive-aggressive types will express their true-feelings of disdain in front of the person they ultimately give in to.

A prime example of this type of behavior is illustrated by the actions of the 'In a World...' protagonist, Carol Solomon (Lake Bell), who is an up and coming voice-over artist, who happens to be the daughter of the voice-over industry darling, Sam (played by the well-known, real-life voice-over artist, Fred Melamed). After Sam makes it clear she can't live with him anymore, Carol moves in with her sister, Dani, a hotel concierge.

The main plot concerns Carol and Sam competing for a big voice-over job for the new 'Amazon Games' movie trailer (a slightly amusing take-off on the 'Hunger Games'). Carol is a classic passive-aggressive type who can't say no. Despite her disdain for Gustav, her sleazy voice-over rival, she ends up staying the night with him after attending Gustav's raucous party.

There's a subplot involving Carol's passive-aggressive sister, Dani, who can't say no to Carol, when she wants him to tape a handsome Irish flirt at the hotel for her special 'voice archive'. When Dani's husband Moe, accidentally comes across the tape, he assumes Dani is actually making a play for the Irishman at the hotel and decides to leave her. You can probably guess that the now estranged couple, eventually reconcile.

When Carol actually ends up winning the job for the 'Amazon Games', her father throws a hissy fit at the awards ceremony where he refuses to acknowledge that Carol actually earned the job fair and square. Only through the intervention of his sagacious younger girlfriend, Jamie, does Sam finally see the light and end up acknowledging both daughters for their talent, love and support. Carol seems to find love herself with the incredibly nerdy Louis, her recording engineer, and finally probably realizes better to end up with an equal (than an opposite, like Gustav).

'In a World...' never really rises above the level of sit-com humor. The characters are modeled on these passive-aggressive types, who thrive on repeating the same kind of self-deprecating jokes, ad infinitum. There is some gentle ribbing of the movie trailer industry which occasionally is amusing, but ultimately there are few laughs here at all. Better to watch the movie trailers themselves than this light weight, formulaic put-down.",1391990400,2,3216,5.159309021113244

A teen chick flick quadrilogy about mutant female Amazons (leader Cameron Diaz) is produced by Katherine Huling (Geena Davis) who plans to revoice Don's iconic three words ""In a world . . ."" for the new quadrilogy trailer. Competition among VO actors is fierce to become the voice of a new generation.

Carol Solomon is an underpaid accent and vocal coach. Carol's dad Sam Sotto (Fred Melamed) considers himself peer to VO voice over legend Don LaFontaine. Sam just published a self congratulatory autobiography making him appear ""hot"" to book addict groupies like sound recording studio receptionist Nancy (Stephanie Allyne).

Moe (Rob Corrdry) the gentle husband of Carol's sister Danielle (Michaela Watkins) and Louis (Demetri Martin) the owner of a sound mixing studio with a crush on Carol, are both supportive of women.

In a world. . . has several verbal arias about growing up, disappointment in ourselves when we choose to hurt another's feelings, liking someone and wanting their attention, fathers and daughters, blaming, apology, forgiveness and affirmative action in this thoughtful comedy.

Carol is one of the fortunate. Life has given her a doting sister Dani who puts up with imposition, a dad in the business with connections, friends who advance her career even though she is unaware and unappreciative, and raw good luck. Carol's humility to accept that she is given opportunities denied others leads her to look at what she can craft of her talent for vocal coaching, professional credibility, and invent a life.

Lake Bell does a terrific job in the tough triple role of director, writer, star and makes a film that's original, and even has something to say about sexism, fathers and daughters and ego.

A young wanna-be voice over artist who has never gotten support from her very successful father  a star in that universe - we watch her as she tries to find place in the odd and specific world of people who do voice-overs for movie trailers, dealing with her own journey, but also her friends and relationships.

Bell took a risk by casting a lot of people we know more as comics than actors in supporting roles, but they almost all do her proud and pull off the heart in the story, as well as the comedy. (And the couple who don't quite have the needed acting chops don't hurt the film enough to do serious damage).

In the end, this isn't a 'change the world' film - if you go in over hyped you could be disappointed - and not every moment or twist works, but there is a lot of raw talent, passion, smarts, and good humor on display, and that puts it pretty far up the ladder in the

And I don't mean that as any sort of slight, given that almost all first time directors are bound by these same constraints. In fact, the best thing about this film, after Bell's performance, is the cheerful anticipation that it engenders for whatever her sophomore project might be. As to other cast members: Rob Corddry excels in an effortless, understated achievement, as the genuinely nice guy brother-in-law (reminiscent of his work in Jim Field Smith's film ""Butter"".) Michaela Watkins was the perfect choice to add a subtle bit of friction and gentle yearning, as the spouse faced with troubling ennui.

I've enjoyed watching Lake Bell perform since The Practice/Boston Legal. She clearly has what it takes to be a filmmaker as well. The ensemble shines with some of her co-stars from Childrens Hospital (Rob Corddry & Ken Marino, as well as several others who have guested). Lake and Demetri Martin are particularly outstanding, very sweet but not clich much. None of the others are phoning it in here either.

It's a very interesting look behind the scenes at the world of voice acting, including both the personalities and the technical aspects thereof. The characters are what made me smile, laugh, cringe, and ache though, and that's why I loved it.

6067262,5,B00G7QQ1Y0,"In a world were one voice stands out as universally recognizable far too few people know the name that issued those rich, resonating tones, Don LaFontaine. He was the man that provided the voice overs used in movie trailers that preceded most of the movies that we watched for decades. By instilling the phrase In a World into the popular jargon he has alter the zeitgeist of the last few generations.  As it happens the phrase is also the title of one of the most imaginative independent films I have seen in a long time.  Understandably the underlying plot point of the film is concerned with the highly competitive world of voice over artists. Many actors want to move on, expanding their repertoire to include screenwriting and directing.  The ones with more ambition than talent and patience they push for some vanity project to exploit the name recognition they built up through their work in front of the camera. Fortunately for those of us that are fans of real cinema Lake Bell has carefully plotted her eclectic curriculum vitae by waiting, learning and understanding the intricacies of the full scope of cinematic artistic expression. Ms Bell has acted in comedies, dramas, and dabbled in thrillers even staring in a short lived but well produced science fiction television series. This film, aptly titled In a World is her freshman opus as screenwriter and director and thanks to the years of diligence it is exceptional quality from inception through execution. With a start as an independent filmmaker like this Ms Bell is certain to continue to be a festival favorite lauding her work in in any number of capacities.
Carol Solomon (Lake Bell) has had an ambition to become the first well known female voice over artist. While she does possess a string and extremely versatile voice that career seemed doomed before it could take flight. The problem is not talent but a distinctive form of reverse nepotism. Carol grew in the formidable shadow of her father Sam Soto (Fred Melamed) the current most famous member of that small be fiercely competitive industry. Sam is widely hailed as the heir apparent to the late, great Don LaFontaine. Cementing that lauded position is the success of his autobiography and the fact that it has been announced that he is to receive a life time achievement award for his industrys Guild. While working on getting her big break doing voice overs Carole earns a living and continues to hone her voice by working as a voice coach, besides a class and private lessons she does find work in the movies helping actresses master accents. In one instance that we get to witness Carol has to teach Eva Longoria to use a passable cockney accent in her upcoming movie.
Carol had been living in her fathers house but is unceremoniously tossed out so Sams girlfriend, Jamie (Alexandra Holden) can move in. Adding to her consternation is the fact that Jamie is almost exactly the same age as Carol. With literally nowhere else to go Carol moves in with her sister Dani (Michaela Watkins) who eschewed the vocal family business to work as a concierge. Carol uses her sisters hotel connections to record the voices of clients in order to expand her library of accents and speech patterns.  Dani is sympathetic to Carols dilemma have grown up under Sams exceptional narcissism. From Sams perspective Don LaFontaine was just a warm-up preparing the world for the greatest that is him.  When a major studio announces that they were going to turn an extremely popular series of books into s film quadology; The Amazon Games every voice over artist in the industry is ready to kill for the job. This is pushed to unheard heights when as part of marketing to promote the franchise the plan to bring back Lafontaines trade mark phrase, In a World. Of course Sam is in consideration but he removes himself from consideration in order push the career of his friend and hopeful successor, Gustav Warner (Ken Marino). He is already sufficiently established in the field to afford a nicely appointed mansion. Always ready to show off his success and rub it in the faces of others Gustav throws a party to push his certainty that with Sams endorsement he will be the one to resurrect the most famous line in the history of trailers.
Circumstances seem to conspire against Carol. Because of her constant tapping the voices of guests the hotel where Dani works bans Carol. Anxious to add a certain dialect to her collection she Dani to record a set of questions recording the clients responses.  When Danis husband, Moe (Rob Corddry) inadvertently hears it out of its proper context he become certain his wife was creating on him. Carol and Dani wind up at Gustavs party where Carol is flirted with by the host. In her cups Carol spends the night and later on Gustav brags to Sam about the party crasher he had sex with not realizing who she was. When Carol takes the lead in the Amazon Games job Gustav is outraged that he stole  his jog although he never officially was offered it. Carols agent, Louis (Demetri Martin) is ecstatic but soon the offer is up for grabs with every voice over artist scrambling to record an audition file that will put them over the top.  More is on the line for Carol; this would make her the first woman to do the trailers for a major film franchise and place her name alongside Don LaFontaine as associated with those iconic words.
This movie in, for a large part, and film industry inside joke but it is crafted with such imagination and executed with a degree of skill that is incredible, that will inexorably pull you into this thin slice of the movie industry and hold you. The reason for this is although the story line is centered almost exclusively on the voice over community the themes that Ms Bell has infused in it are universal. At the heart of the film is a tale of a family that somewhere along the road veered into dysfunction. While the father put everything into pursuing his dream he alienated his family. One daughter sought a life away from films in a position where she catered to the whims of her clients while holding on to a marriage with a nice guy. The other daughter so loved and admired her father that she wanted to follow in his footsteps. When she finally gets her big break instead of being proud of his daughters accomplishments he names a self-serving, clone of himself to be his heir apparent. Beyond that Sam is ready to throw his daughter and friend under the bus for a shot at one more accolade. The humor is on the darker side built upon the tragedy of a father and daughter torn apart by ambition.
Ms Lake not only stared in the film, wrote the screenplay and directed she also wore the producers hat. I would be at all surprise if she got to the set extra early to set up the craft service table. Apparently the principle photography for this movie was under three weeks with what had to be a miniscule budget, not only is Ms Bell a versatile actress and in her ascendency as a filmmaker but she has already garnered a crucial part of the art form; the ability to stay in budget and on schedule. Some filmmakers go on for decades without master the pragmatic aspect of making a movie. You can tell she has earned a lot of good will in the industry by noticing the guest stars. Besides comedians that have made a name for themselves in that venue like Rob Corddry , Demetri Martin and Ken Marino but some A list names are liberally sprinkled throughout the movie with Eva Longoria playing herself, Geena Davis as the studio executive and, if you look closely at the Amazon Games trailer, Cameron Diaz has a cameo as their leader. One little inside reference I admittedly needed IMDB to realize; one on the voice over artist was Joe Cipriano as himself. He was the announcer for the 2006 NBC science fiction series, Surface which stared Lake Bell. This is a witty Indy with strong character development, a solid narrative and directorial style. Most of all it has an abundance of heart.",1390867200,2,7975,4.659090909090909

6067280,4,B00G7QQ1Y0,"The odds are pretty sizable that you won't recognize the name Lake Bell.  By todays standards, you could easily make the case that this particular actress has yet to leave her outstanding mark on the entertainment industry.  Over the years, shes previously been a series regular on television shows, including Boston Legal and How to Make It in America.  Her roles in film are all over the board, appearing in supporting roles for popular films like No Strings Attached, A Good Old Fashioned Orgy, and Black Rock.  And, while her roles in both film and television have been far from noteworthy, the outstanding work she does in the film, In a World might just be the primer she needs to hit the big time.

Lake Bell takes on the heavy task of writing, directing, and starring in the film  portraying struggling voice coach, Carol Solomon.  Upon first meeting Carol, its clear shes passionate about the voice-over industry, especially since shes the daughter of one of the most prominent figures in the business, Sam Soto (Fred Melamed).  But, being a woman in a business thats dominated by men has put her career in a massive funk and limited her to random voice coaching jobs.

Theres also quite a bit going on in Carols personal life.  Her father abruptly kicks her out of the house so his incredibly young 30 year old girlfriend can move in, forcing Carol to stay with her sister, Dani (Michaela Watkins), and Danis husband, Moe (Rob Corddry).  Coinciding with her new living situation, Carols co-worker (and secret love interest), Louis (Demetri Martin), informs her that theres serious interest in using her in commercials and various other projects.  However, the problem with that is it takes voice-over work away from the industrys biggest up-and-coming star, Gustav Warner (Ken Marino)  whom Carol also becomes entangled with.

Due to the passing of the voice-over legend, Don LaFontaine (most notable for coining the movie trailer voice-over phrase in a world), there is now a free-for-all in the industry.  Carols father appears to be a shoe-in to replace LaFontaine as the industry leader, but he decides to put his support behind Gustav.  At the same time, Carol starts receiving more and more voice-over jobs, creating the possibility for her to steal the role of a lifetime when news hits that an upcoming film, The Amazon Games, will be searching for a new voice to bring back the famous in a world line.  Suddenly, the race is on to land the most sought after role in the voice-over industry.

The fact that there is a whole film devoted to the voice-over industry doesnt necessarily look that exciting on paper.  But, as usual  looks can be deceiving.  In fact, In a World is a complete breath of fresh air, mostly because the majority of films these days feel repetitive and stuck in the mud.  Lake Bell, who recognized that the actual voice-over industry lacked a female presence, has decided to create a surprisingly entertaining story to give that particular industry some attention.  And, on top of that, she also manages to throw in some absurdity and screwball humor to go along with it.

As the lead actress of this film, Lake Bell is very enjoyable and brings a massive amount of female dominance to the table (both in a production role and character portrayal).  Her character thats funny with the way she goes through the motions of life, yet still remains to be some what driven  looking for her big break.  To Bells credit, some leading roles suffer when the same person is responsible for the script and the directing, however, Bell never misses a beat.  This role, her finest role to date, is impressive, not just from a comedic standpoint, but also from a dramatic standpoint.  If this is what Lake Bell is capable of accomplishing, then her future is unbelievably bright

Bells co-stars are also rather charming, starting with comedian Rob Coddry  who has recently starred in films that include Hot Tub Time Machine, Pain & Gain, and The Way Way Back.  Hes also responsible for creating the popular web series, Childrens Hospital, which he stars in, alongside both Lake Bell and Ken Marino.  Bell and Coddry share several scenes together, as do Bell and Marino, but sadly the trio never share a full scene together.  In any event, Coddrys role is mostly of little importance to the underlying direction of Bells character, Coddry serves as mature voice of reason for both Carol and her sister who are continuously at odds with their overbearing father.

Marino plays the self-absorbed king-in-waiting that has very little to gain and plenty to lose  which is evident when Bells character begins stealing his jobs.  Marinos character is the closest thing to an antagonist in the film, coming off as slay and manipulative.  He oddly and abruptly becomes interested in Carol  although the humorous dynamic here is that he has no idea that shes related to his mentors daughter (they have different last names).  Still, the majority of the films comedy comes from the interactions between Bell and Marino  especially during a party where they meet for the first time.

Overall, In a World is a small budget film that will not likely garner the attention of most moviegoers.  Never the less, Lake Bell has delivered an enjoyable flick that proves she can not only handle being the lead in a feature film, but she is also quite talented with a pen and being behind the camera.  This film will give you a generalized look at the voice-over industry, and leave an understandable impression of just how competitive the industry can be.  This particular feature knows when to be serious and when to throw in a few moments of laughter.  Its romantic at times, graceful in others  combining for a surprisingly pleasant viewing experience.  If you're into smaller budget films and are willing to give anything a shot, you won't be disappointed by this invigorating comedy.
