4435860,5,B004NJC0IO,This season is a great follow-up to Season One! You've got to preview an episode of this adorable little fellow on Amazon Instant and see for yourself! All cast members were well-picked! This is a classic comedy show that I really appreciate Amazon Instant Video for making available to us!,1340928000,,290,4.82
4435861,4,B004NJC0IO,"As a lover of 80's sitcoms, this is great. Webster will warm your heart just like he did the first time you watched it!  If you haven't seen this sitcom, what are you waiting for?  It's a good one, Exactly the way I remember it.",1330300800,,228,4.044444444444444
4435862,5,B004NJC0IO,"As with the Season One set...this set WILL NOT dissapoint! There were many heartwarming and touching episodes...as well as many episodes that touch on MANY important subjects! As with many sitcoms of the 80's, serious subjects were touched upon in a very honest, straight-forward, yet effective manner! Webster was and still is an amazing 'FAMILY FRIENDLY' sitcom! You and your children can watch these episodes together! Not without flaws, but Katherine and George were very kind and loving parents! Relive the moments when television sitcoms could melt your heart!",1321315200,,566,5.370786516853933
4435863,5,B004NJC0IO,"I love this show.  It is well made, well written, and appropriate for the whole family.  My kids are 3 & 5 and will sit and watch it with me.  It's hard to find something we all enjoy.

The discs were well packaged as well, which I find is rare when buying ""older"" TV shows and movies on DVD.  They did a great job putting together the DVD format as well.

I was very happy with this purchase.  Just ordered Season Three as well.",1313107200,4,429,4.035714285714286

4435865,5,B004NJC0IO,"Shout! Factory is really doing a great job with these sets. Really enjoy ""Webster"" S2 because it brings back so many memories of watching it when it first came on TV years ago. The first couple of eps in the set are a continuation from S1 which are among my favorites. These are the full and unedited eps that fans remember from the original run. These are packaged in the same type of clear plastic case as S1 was. Season 3 will be out over the summer. Let's hope Shout! puts out further sets. Remember, you are what you watch.",1298419200,6,528,4.29

4435875,5,B004NJC0IO,I always liked when he would ride up and down on that shoot thing that they had at the house. That was funny. Oh...and I remember the episode of when their house had a fire. WOW! I cannot believe Webster made it out of that fire.  He was pretty short...he probably just walked out right underneath the smoke and fire....haha,1365033600,2,324,4.4
4435876,5,B004NJC0IO,My wife and I still think Webster is a great little family show. It's just a shame the TV shows today aren't decent enough for the family to sit and enjoy together. None of the so called new sitcoms and shows are children friendly.,1361577600,2,231,4.2727272727272725

4435879,5,B004NJC0IO,"I loved Webster season 2, one of my favorite episodes was The Uh Oh Feeling. Websters school friend was being molested by a substitute teacher, she was too frightened to tell, so Webster stood up to the person and told the authorities instead. Guest stars on this episode were Allison Sweeney (Days Of Our Lives) the late Meredith MacRae (Petticoat Junction) and Tiffany Brissette (Small Wonder).",1348012800,,396,5.015151515151516
