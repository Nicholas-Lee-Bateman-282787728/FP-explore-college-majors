8380672,3,B002TVQ4B2,"I guess I'm in love with the old Care Bears stuff. My oldest son went through a Care Bears stage and luckily is out of it for the moment, because I had enough of those songs in my head. But I can say that I do like the old movies and shows more. These for some reason seem so cheap. Sigh.",1429228800,,288,3.737704918032787
8380673,5,B002TVQ4B2,I loved the series as a little girl and am thrilled my 2 year old son loves it as well. Each little mini episode has a wonderful story/theme.,1373414400,,141,4.071428571428571
8380674,5,B002TVQ4B2,"My daughter loved the Carebears when she was little and wanted to introduce them to her son so I purchased this movie for all my grandchildren, ages 2-7, both genders. All of them love the movie, especially the 2 year old, and the 3 year old, & the 5 year old. They are very glad when I put this on for them to watch. The movie is a teaching tool about friendship and helping others and what better way to get that across. The movie is cute, easy for really young ones to follow. It keeps their interest, and they sing and dance (the 2 year old is a riot to watch) and really enjoy the movie, songs, dancing, etc. I highly recommend the movie to everyone.",1301443200,,655,4.165354330708661
8380675,5,B002TVQ4B2,"I grew up with the original plump fluffy care bears in the 80's.  This is  a more modern version of the care bears.  The stories are very cute, teaching little ones to care about other peoples feelings and belongings and about being careful.  Each story has a point it's trying to make too.  I recommend this for little ones.  My 2 year old daughter loves it and I find myself watching and liking it too, especially since I watched the original care bears when I was little.  I like this even better.",1269907200,3,500,4.369565217391305
8380676,5,B002TVQ4B2,I purchased this item for my 3 year old daughter.  She absolutely loves it.  I viewed it with her (in its entirety) and must say I was pleasantly entertained as well.  The theme/message with each episode was love & sharing.  I recommend this item to all parents with little ones.,1269302400,3,279,4.52
