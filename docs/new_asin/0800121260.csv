168309,3,0800121260,"I like it however after watching it again, it was just ok.  I like all the three top stars especially Geena Davis.  She was a very cool lady and her acting was exceptional in Thelma and Louise.  ANDY GARCIA  is one of my top stars and does not disappoint!",1395100800,,255,4.142857142857143
168310,5,0800121260,I accidentally ordered a zone 2 or district 2 when I only watch zone 1.  The company was very helpful to resolve this problem for me.,1369785600,,133,4.115384615384615
168311,5,0800121260,"Highly entertaining; hilarious; great plot twists.  We are ""Prime"" members and got to watch it for free.  What a bargain!  But even if you are on a pay-to-play basis, it would be money well spent. You won't be disappointed.",1316304000,,223,4.666666666666667
168312,1,0800121260,I didn't have the patience  for this -- first few minutes watching a thief / crook -- then boring scenes - then fastforward and didn't get better,1305936000,2,145,4.37037037037037
168313,4,0800121260,"This was an engaging, wonderful film about human nature and how there is a potential hero (or the opposite)in all of us. Great acting, etc., too.",1200614400,,145,4.615384615384615
168314,4,0800121260,"Very few actors can play Idiots or losers like Hoffman does in this movie. He does it with so much grace that you want to adopt him. Maybe not fully intended, but it's a brilliant comedy. Hoffman's indifference while trying to open the door of the plane is, in my opinion, one of the funniest scenes in cinema ever.",1016841600,2,315,4.3559322033898304
168315,5,0800121260,"Hero is really a gem.  It features consistently good performances and is sharp, thought-provoking, and is touching without approaching sappiness.  You get Geena Davis while she was still making good movies, Dustin Hoffman without much visible ego, a solid Andy Garcia, and the always-fabulous Joan Cusack.
This movie was SO underrated.  I remember reading that Quentin Tarantino said this was a movie he wished he'd had a chance to direct because it could have been so much better, that in this movie you see a director reaching the extent of his abilities, and while I was glad to see that someone was recognizing it in any way, it also really made me mad that Quentin Tarantino, not like the most consistent or productive director, should say that about Steven Frears, who directed My Beautiful Laundrette, Dangerous Liaisons, and this.  Really!  This is for me up there among the best movies of the past 10 years, certainly among the most underappreciated.",991872000,35,959,4.96875

168350,2,0800121260,Dustin Hoffman is a great actor but the language got very boring. It had the potential to be very funny; underlying good life lessons.  Just bored with the same profanity over and over. Lazy writing.,1441584000,,199,4.685714285714286

168353,5,0800121260,"One of the great movies that goes under the radar. Loved it in 1992 and still love it. Some people may point out some cheesy graphics in the movie, or yada yada yada about the script, but ultimately it is feel good movie with a great cast.",1426896000,,239,4.1063829787234045

7792906,5,0800121260,"One of my all time favorites - wish they would bring the DVD back into circulation so that I could buy it. Dustin Hoffman in a classic anti-hero role that has a feel of realness to it. Dry, black humor - my experience is that some people love it and some people hate it, but for my money you cant go wrong with Dustin Hoffman in a role like this one - the only weak link in the movie is Chevy Chases extreme overacting in his scenes. It was like he was playing in a different movie from the rest of the cast. I blame this partially on the director, who either didn't have the insight or the confidence to tell such a huge star to tone it down.",1521158400,,643,3.992248062015504

7792908,3,0800121260,"Perhaps worth 3.5. Not a movie I'd watch a second time, but I enjoyed it. I couldn't believe they were going to be able to tie it up - Hollywood movies always botch the ending - but they did. Plausible (in the context of the movie) and satisfying.",1488153600,,247,4.166666666666667
