2643638,4,B000HWXOQI,"The Bell Witch Haunting closely follows the two real-life, non-fiction, written accounts I recently read. A handful of scenes are those I am not familiar with, but they could have been mentioned in some obscure journals or newspapers of the 1800's, so I'm not going to score the movie down on those conditions. I will say the acting was not top-notch, but as I have mentioned before, the account itself seems to be authentic. A few scenes may startle the viewer, but it is in no way a ""blood and guts"" film. For those who are curious about the Bell Witch of Tennessee, this movie is worth watching.",1289088000,5,598,4.546296296296297

2643643,1,B000HWXOQI,"There's only one word to describe this movie, and it is 'awful'. A perfect testament to the effort that went into this movie is when the screen goes black and the date comes up, it said ""January 21th"", yes the -th is correct and not a typo on my end. The dialogue is tired and lazy, and it's insulting to us viewers that this takes place in Tennessee and yet there are Palm trees. This is something you'd expect from a high school film student... When the bed sheet got lifted into the air, they could have made some effort to not make it completely obvious that it was being lifted at the four corners by string. Really this movie is more entertaining than scary, in the way that fairly quickly I started to focus more on spotting the flaws than caring about the story, it was funny to see how little they put into the production.",1423526400,,831,4.2993630573248405

2643646,3,B000HWXOQI,"Found footage horror fans will enjoy this one - especially if you are having a hard time wading through the ever-growing tar pit of terrible micro budget c-horror films on the market today. The trailer definitely provides a much greater impression of the scares you'll find in this film compared to the actual experience itself, as the film really is not scary. But, it does have its moments. The acting is average - not terrible and not notably good. However, I'd recommend this one if you're a fan of the genre, though even having watched it twice (rented it a second time by accident), I am still on the fence about it. Is it a ""tell all your friends"" horror movie? No. But, if you're home alone, sick, or bored and you've got some time on your hands and the rental is in your budget, then I'd say it's met the criteria for a rental.",1416528000,,836,4.4

2643648,3,B000HWXOQI,"I also saw this movie on Netflix. It was very similiar to Paranormal Activity, which I like those kinds of movies and the found footage genre. People do get bored with these kinds of movies, but I thought it was worth 3 stars and would watch it again (although I probably wouldn't buy it). Some of the ""teens"" acting was a little bad, but I thought the affects were pretty good.",1416009600,,378,4.338028169014085
2643649,2,B000HWXOQI,"This had a lot of promise but never developed. Im not the kind of viewer to attack a film as Im sure the process involved is difficult and a lot of work. That being said, found footage films have a lot of conventions that if followed at least please fans of the genre, and this film didn't do that. The ""Bell Witch"" was simply seen too much/too clearly and she/it was not scary at all. There is one effect that is very impressive, and without ""spoiling"" it happens in the woods with one of the teens friends talking on camera. You'll notice it immediately as it is something that appears to be done at a level found in a studio film vs. this indie effort.",1413936000,,655,4.248

2643651,1,B000HWXOQI,"This movie is one of the worst movies I believe I have ever scene. It almost seems as is it was made straight out of High School. I live very close to Adams, Tennessee and have actually been on the old Bell property in the last couple of weeks. As I have yet to explore the Bell which cave and the remake of the cabin I did get some things told by the tour guide. First off January in Tennessee is cold, not as cold as Michigan but cold enough that we ware allot of cloths. Secondly, there is no such thing as Adams County PD, It is Adams PD or Robertson County Sheriffs Office. Third, we do not have Palm trees growing anywhere here in Tennessee as far as I know specially not anywhere close to the old Bell property, it is a very nicely farmed farm that just happens to have some unique history to it if you ask me. The director and producer should of went and visited the property and should of taken the tour, they would be a whole lot wiser if they did so and would of probably not made such a fool out of themselves with this movie.",1401148800,,1038,4.068292682926829

2643654,1,B000HWXOQI,"The camera jumping all over the place gave me a headache. My mother took better movies in the 60s and her thumb was in most of the footage. How did anyone allow this to become a movie? It's 'supposed to be Tennessee, yet there are palm trees. It's 'supposed' to be winter, yet there is a pool party going on. This is an insult to the word 'movie', an insult to the word 'actor' and an insult to the intelligence of anyone who tries to watch it! Last, but not least NO ONE IN THIS MOVIE EVEN HAS A SOUTHERN ACCENT! I guess the new fad is to hand anyone a camera and call them producers. Luckily, I watched it on Netflix for free. I really feel for those who actually go out and rent or buy it!",1390089600,2,692,4.021739130434782
2643655,2,B000HWXOQI,"After growing up near Nashville and hearing about the Bell Witch my whole life I was excited to see a movie made about it. I'm really not sure anyone checked the movie out before releasing it. It is set Jan 2011. In the opening scene the officer is wearing short sleeves, then the next scene is of a pool party with people wearing bikinis and mini dresses. UM, hello??? I wish it was that warm in Jan! Then it is filmed  a lot like the Paranormal Activity films so if you can handle the bouncing camera you will be ok, but the dates are put up on the screen as Jan 21th, Jan 22th, etc. Come on. The only reason I gave it a second star is because of the choice of story.",1389830400,,669,4.030075187969925
2643656,1,B000HWXOQI,"I'm a big fan of the Blair Witch Project and the Paranormal Activity movies. I like the found-footage genre in general, and I like a well done horror movie. This movie is just terrible. The teen boy puts cameras all over the house to record any odd events. That night the sister and a friend are visited by the witch in what should have been a ""let's get the hell out of this house"" event, but did anyone bother to look at the footage that the camera had recorded? Apparently not, because the next day everyone acted like nothing was out of the ordinary. That's what bugged me the whole movie - all the way until the very end everyone acts like nothing is out of the ordinary. They freak out about individual events, but nobody sees a pattern in five deaths, freaky dead animals, goo shooting out the plumbing, wet footprints where there couldn't have been anyone to make them, a ton of camera footage that the characters never bother to look at (including a death; you have a death and a camera that recorded it, but you don't look at the what's on the camera?), two instances of people getting locked in the basement... on and on and on, and nobody seems concerned about any of this for more than five minutes. Weird thing happens, five minutes later everything is fine. This was, by far, the most stupid and inane of all the movies I've seen in this genre. It wasn't worth the time to watch.",1389312000,6,1394,4.406976744186046
2643657,1,B000HWXOQI,Yet another movie where it's Blair Witch crossed over with Paranormal Activity. That's something that's way overdone anymore. The acting was horrible and the story line was completely botched. There was maybe one good scary part and that was about it. Definitely not worth the time or money.,1389225600,,291,5.083333333333333
2643658,3,B000HWXOQI,"Seeing this one on Netflix I really didn't have much too lose other than my time. Movie starts immediately with no introduction and ends the same way as well. The acting in part is pretty bad and thought that the two actors who played the teens parents were totally miscast as the parents. They seemed a bit too young to me to have children in there older teens.
Movie plays out just like the paranormal activity series even to the point of the same exact soundtrack music being played just before a paranormal occurrence happens.
Watching it just seemed funny and very very predictable when a killing was going to happen. The end as well just had be baffled. Especially the lead characters reaction as to what just happened and what she did. No fear, no sadness, no reaction at all. (I won't ruin the end for you).  How can one take this movie one bit seriously and to really believe the haunting.",1389225600,,898,4.50920245398773
2643659,1,B000HWXOQI,"If you feel you just have to watch this movie, download from Netflix.  Do not spend money on this, for that will really haunt you.  There's not much I can add to the other reviews except to say if you really want to watch a decent (not GREAT, but pretty decent) movie about the Bell Witch, I direct you to An American Haunting, with Sissy Spacek and Donald Sutherland.  At least you've got acting done right.",1389139200,,408,4.342105263157895
2643660,1,B000HWXOQI,This movie is just eh. It goes like this: couple found dead then nothing. Girls at pool party with boobs exposed then nothing. Girls dancing around then nothing. Girl screams then nothing. Girl screams some more then nothing. Flickering lights then nothing. Blanket pulled up by what clearly looks like strings then nothing. More screams then a lot more nothing. You get the picture.,1388880000,,383,5.0

So... no it won't... actually made it through the whole thing because I was laughing... watch this movie with captions as deaf people probably think this is the best movie ever!",1385424000,,322,4.8545454545454545
2643663,1,B000HWXOQI,"I would have given it minus 100 stars if it were possible but you work with what you have.
This movie made NO sense what so ever. It was supposed to be about the Bell Witch, which is in Adams Tn. As I live in Tennessee, I can assure everyone, we DO NOT have palm trees and there is no way in hell we would be in summer clothes as it is freakin COLD in January here. Aside from getting that major (to me) detail totally wrong, the movie would change scenes so much you never knew who, what or when - you were at in the movie. Even the opening scene . . .  who was that and how did they get there?
This movie was so bad I can't even cover all that was wrong with it but PLEASE take my advice and DO NOT rent it. Don't buy it. Hell . .  I wouldn't even make eye contact with it.
That is an hour and 32 mins I will NEVER get back. It might cause me nightmares but only because it's a nightmare that I even rented the God awful thing.

2643664,1,B000HWXOQI,If you like screaming females jumping up and down this is the movie for you. They scream and jump up and down whether they are or happy or terrified. They also all use vocal fry when speaking which is annoying as hell. I don't know which is the most annoying so I guess I pick the non stop screaming with vocal fry a close second. As far as found footage movies go this is pretty much the bottom of the barrel.,1381708800,2,410,4.074074074074074

2643666,1,B000HWXOQI,"Major spoilers.... My gripes about this terrible movie. 1) No one ever checks the footage of the tapes of the cameras they placed around the perimeter except for one time during the whole film. What's the point of them if you never check the footage. Especially after certain events. Illogical. 2) No one acknowledges the murder that have taken place and find worry in them. Come on, any parent would be worried if there were frequent murders or deaths in the neighborhood. 3) No one has real concern after someone has been attacked or acting strangely. Come on! Girl goes missing, has blood all over her face and her parents are more concerned about how they feel about the situation. 4) Bad acting on everyone's part although they did have some moments. 5)  After girl has many events concerning her and parents leave her alone all the time and once again don't check the tapes. 6) After all the bs, no one wants to check into a hotel and mother has no backbone to take her kids to one when the husband acts all crazy. 7) If the electrician is being electrocuted, I highly doubt his stupid video camera works just fine during the whole event.

I get it that it's just a movie... but it's a very bad one and towards the end, I was just bored wanted to turn it off. I am sure I could have dreamed up a better ending. If someone had actually put some LOGIC into this movie and cut out the cheesy not scary bell witch, that looked like a typical high school goth student, I my have actually enjoyed this movie.",1380153600,2,1508,4.401433691756273

2643679,1,B000HWXOQI,"A family moves to Tennessee and buys a home that was on the land of the Bell witch. They set up cameras and you know the rest. This film is far worse than the Paranormal series. Perhaps the bright spot was cutie Catherine Alter who played a teen who had her own blog ""Dressing with Dana."" The teen son also had a camera as did Policeman Bungalon who had a shirt cam, the house was wired, and even the bonehead electrician had a cam, ""Get Electric with Denny"" (GED). All this added up to a bunch of herky-jerky motion of stuff we have seen before and better and just about yesterday. The house had a pool, I'm surprised they didn't steal the pool crawler too.

Teens who can't get enough of the Paranormal hand held stuff might like this, but I found it boring, except for the playful ghost (that uses strings) to remove covers off of sleeping teen girls in bra and panties.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex. Topless girls by pool.",1379116800,,929,4.364161849710983
2643680,2,B000HWXOQI,"It's pretty bad... very badly paced movie that feels like it goes on forever, utterly ripped off of Paranormal Activity with Blair Witch and Exorcist, there's nothing original or intelligent about the movie, it just goes on and on and on, and no one checks the footage or tells anyone if they do, it's ridiculous. I wasn't expecting much. The beginning partying, teen scene goes on forever, obviously to draw in a younger crowd.

I mean if you're working like I am, you can watch it and kinda laugh at it, but if you want a good movie, I'd recommend Poltergeist, The Conjuring was alright, and Sinister.

I get it's low budget, so I forgive it a lot of problems, but it's clearly just cashing in on the other found footage films hype.

2643682,4,B000HWXOQI,"Might not be realistic to have a pool party in TN in January but the creepy factor over-shadowed that mistake.  Camera shots made it seem you were there with the family at their every move.....and every move of the Bell Witch.  The muffled whispers and music will leave you in tense anticipation of the witches next move and you may find yourself yelling as loud as the possessed sister.  The cast may be a bit amateur but they carried off what the movie needed them to.  The brother behind  most of the camera footage seemed to have more potential than what this venue allowed him to show.  Would hope this is his stepping stone to a bigger opportunity.

2643687,2,B000HWXOQI,"This isn't so much a movie as it is 20 or so brief, generic jump scare scenes in a row. A couple of them are effective, most are dull, and every one of them is - in 2013, after hundreds of ""found footage"" exercises - a tired riff on this (still fertile, imo) genre. The characters are FF stock (there's the annoying brother w/ camera he can't/won't put down; a big sister who's pretty, vacant, and screamy; and anyone's mom and dad, making poor choices throughout). The scenes are hacky, disjointed, and frustrating and the ghosts/scares are lazy and contrived.

Here's how hard the director thought about what he was directing: about a third of the way through watch for the dad, who with his wife and son in the basement has just heard a persistent scratching sound, decide to right away stick his hand into a blind crevice to... what? Feel around and pull the nesting raccoon/squirrel/skunk out of its hole, maybe get a little light rabies? He seems genuinely surprised when he gets bitten by something. That's a move you expect from, say, a toothless meth-head who's been awake for 72 hours, but not so much from a rational adult. Maybe they cut the rest of the 'alcoholic dad' subplot and left this in by mistake.

BOTTOM LINE: A competent but formulaic FF flick that's reasonably fun if you're in the mood for one and have low expectations. After that it'll just swirl in with the rest of them in your memory.

BETTER USE OF YOUR TIME: If FF is your thing - and it's often mine - lately I've seen ""Frankenstein's Army"" and ""Evidence"" (the 2012 release, not the 2013 film with Billith and Radha Mitchell), either of which is better than this. FA is a fun and fresh sample of what the genre can be, and Evidence is a slog in the first half that totally makes up for itself in act 3.

There was obviously minimal research into the original Bell Witch legend which is rooted in the pioneer days of Tennessee. Absolutely no effort was made to remain true to the setting of middle TN. The actual Bell Witch legend is intriguing enough without cheesing it up the way this movie did. If you want a movie that is more true to the Bell Witch legend, watch Bell Witch the Movie starring Betsy Palmer and John David Hart.
