2394774,5,B000AXW0WS,I loved this dvd! I've tried some other pregnancy workout tapes and they were all too easy. Finally a pregnancy workout that is challenging and makes you feel great. Highly recommended!,1142121600,6,185,5.0
2394775,5,B000AXW0WS,"As an older first-time mother-to-be and pilates enthusiast, I was eager to try several pilates DVDs as soon as my doctor gave me the go ahead to continue doing pilates.  The rest of my purchases are sitting on the shelf because they are not challenging enough and don't incorporate a wedge to eliminate lying flat on your back after the first trimester.  It's also much nicer to do a prenatal pilates workout when the instructor is also pregnant!  If you're relatively experienced with pilates, this is the DVD for you.",1141603200,3,519,4.7444444444444445
2394776,5,B000AXW0WS,"First off I love this workout because she doesn't break anything up into segments..like show you how to do it then do the moves..it's fluid and the continuity is a breath of fresh air! It's like literally taking a class right in your own living room.  Niece is very likable, personable, and skilled.  The lower body workout was very challenging to me and I found how weak I actually was in the particular areas worked.  Love this workout and highly recommend it!!",1141084800,4,463,4.621951219512195
2394777,5,B000AXW0WS,"I own quite a few pregnancy workout DVD's and this is one of my favorites. I consider myself having a moderate fitness level; I walk a few miles most days and do other workouts a couple times of week. Pilates is an amazing all-round and safe workout that can be tailored to any fitness level. Results can be felt (a good soreness) and seen pretty quickly. If you abhor gyms, machines and weights, as I do, Pilates is a great way to strengthen and tone--even during pregnancy.",1139443200,5,475,4.471264367816092
2394778,5,B000AXW0WS,Pilates During Pregnancy is a challenging and safe workout that quickly yields results. I found the excercises to be fluid and evenly paced. The video is broken into two workouts with is much easier for my schedule. Great workout!,1139356800,5,230,4.923076923076923
2394779,5,B000AXW0WS,"I would just like to start by saying that I love this DVD!!  Before I became pregnant I was an avid fan of anything Pilates.  I loved the way my body looked and the way I felt.  When I found out that I was pregnant I immediately started looking for a pregnancy workout that incorporated pilates.  The first dvd that I bought was Pilates in Pregnancy and it was horrible, the pace was so slow and it didn't make me feel like I had accomplished anything.  So I had to start my search all over again.  I saw this dvd, read the reviews, and took my chances.  I must say that disappoint is not a word that I would use in the same sentence with this dvd.  It is great!!!  I do this workout every night and it makes me feel really good about the way my pregnancy and my body are progressing.  I would recommend this for any mom-to-be.  If you purchase this dvd, you will be happy that you did.",1138233600,,886,4.093023255813954
2394780,5,B000AXW0WS,"I am a yoga teacher and I absolutely love this cd. Some morning I get up and do the abdominal series only. Also, the leg series really helps strenghten the hips!

I highly recommend this CD.",1137024000,7,190,4.277777777777778
2394781,5,B000AXW0WS,"This is a great workout. I really feel a change in my thighs and  abdomen. This workout helps me to stay motivated and to ""keep moving"" as Niece says. This is my first baby and I was really scared about gaining the weight and losing my figure. Well this DVD has helped me keep my figure and at seven months pregnant, I am still energised and ready to go. The exercises are safe and effective, and focused on the areas that pregnancy changes the most. I have never had so many compliments in my life. I am so glad that I purchased this DVD and I would recomend it to any mom who wants to stay healthy and look great.",1130457600,18,615,4.125
2394782,5,B000AXW0WS,"Beautifully shot!  What I liked most about this dvd was that it WAS NOT painfully boring like the rest of the pregnancy dvd's that I own!  It gets right to the point.  You can do the first section which is more focused on your abs or you can add on the lower body workout.  It helped keep the thighs under control! HA!  The instruction is clear and easy to follow.  I think it's great that this is a program that doesn't confuse women as to when it's permissable to exercise flat on your back or not. It has a nice pace and flow, whereas alot of the other Pilates routines are too broken up.  Everything is modified for each trimester. All the breathing really helped me focus through my natural delivery.  I've actually continued to use it since I've had my baby.  It's been a great way to get back into a routine.",1129161600,14,815,4.2745098039215685
2394783,1,B000AXW0WS,Amazon must have received a bad batch of this program because both the original copy I purchased and its replacement were so severely scratched that I have now requested a refund.  My best advice is to find another Pilates for Pregnancy program.,1128902400,,245,4.833333333333333
2394784,2,B000AXW0WS,"I'm not sure I could have comfortably done this DVD BEFORE I was pregnant. Pecenka is amazing, but she's clearly in better shape than me.",1405468800,,137,4.52
2394785,5,B000AXW0WS,"I've never done pilates, and this was a good intro. It felt like a combo of ballet and yoga. Thanks",1395014400,,99,4.0
2394786,5,B000AXW0WS,"This has 3 levels of difficulty.  The easiest is pretty easy and most any pregnant woman can do it.  Once they get stronger and more fit, moving up to the medium level is not bad at all.  This is the level my wife stayed at most of the time.  Advanced adds a level of difficulty that is great for those who are already doing pilates a lot before they got pregnant.
I do suggest this product.",1392336000,,391,4.105263157894737
2394787,4,B000AXW0WS,"I NEVER worked out before pregnancy. So this video is a great way to get into shape for the delivery! I like that Niece Pecenka goes through the video like you know what you are doing already, instead of doing step-by-step instructions for each exercise. This way, you are not getting annoyed or bored because she is ""dragging"" when you get into the hang of what is going on. Watch the video before you start it. Also, Since I was out of shape when I first started the video, I only did part of each segment (there are 2), I didn't kill myself to finish the entire video. I did take a star away for her black clothing. It was a little hard at times to see her movement with all the dark colors in the background and clothing but not difficult. Overall, great video!!

Key Points:
-Watch video before attempting to use
-Go at your own pace (it's okay if you don't complete an entire segment)
-Easy to follow instructions
-Fast workout, time saver",1391558400,,945,4.4
2394788,1,B000AXW0WS,I feel aweful saying this but other buyers need to know.... she is wearing all black.  She is laying on a black mat and there is hardly any light.  You cant even see the moves you are suppose to be doing.  it looks like she is filming this in a basement .  Its really dark.  If it wasn't written on the dvd you would have no idea she was even pregnant.  Choose a different dvd,1390348800,,376,3.9466666666666668
2394789,5,B000AXW0WS,"Tough but effective! My stomach went back pretty quickly, and I feel that it is due to keeping up me stomach muscles! But this is for a person that is familiar with palates and was in good shape pre-prego",1385424000,,204,4.256410256410256
2394790,5,B000AXW0WS,Got it today and was very happy with the leg and hip section. It definitely burned and was challenging. I would recommend,1380758400,,121,4.545454545454546
2394791,2,B000AXW0WS,"I read the reviews and thought it might be ok. But to be honest this is just lacking. The scene she is in is boring, what she is wearing does make it impossible to understand what to do and it just isn't inspirational at all, especially when you need an extra lift.",1373414400,,265,4.115384615384615
2394792,2,B000AXW0WS,Got it for my wife.  She did not like it.  I also thought the production was pretty low quality. And the instructor was uninspiring.,1369353600,,132,4.458333333333333
2394793,5,B000AXW0WS,"Refreshing work out, not too intense but just enough to feel good and work your muscles. She recommends adjustments as pregnancy progresses, as well.",1363996800,,149,5.25
2394794,5,B000AXW0WS,"I am 23 weeks pregnant and have had a perfect pregnancy so far, however my back has recently started to hurt, after looking around for a Pilates in Pregnancy DVD, i found this one. The other reviews were good for this, so i thought i would give it a go. i am so glad i did as it is great, i have realised how weak my abs have become in such a short space of time, this is a really good work out and one i would highly recommend. Its easy to follow and a great price!",1360627200,,466,3.814432989690722
2394795,5,B000AXW0WS,This video is wonderfully difficult.  Being a person who previously exercised very rigorously before I was pregnant I was pleasantly and painfully surprised with how challenging this workout is.  I will most likely continue this workout postnatal.,1360022400,,247,5.648648648648648
2394796,4,B000AXW0WS,"I got this video to help my hips during pregnancy.  It's a hard workout, but I feel great for a couple days after.  I think it will really help me keep my strength and recover after the baby comes.",1359936000,,197,4.0256410256410255
2394797,4,B000AXW0WS,I am pregnant with my first child and I thought this would be a great way to stay active since I knew my days at the gym were numbered.  I found this video to be extremely relaxing and enjoyed taking the time to do the short 15 minute or 30 minute segments during the week.  I would recommend this for anyone who is pregnant.,1357257600,,325,4.0625
2394798,5,B000AXW0WS,I I love this video. I used during both pregnancies and have even shared with my friends.  This video is even good to use after pregnancy.  It gives you several options and it really helped my belly get back immediately. The nurses at the hospital even remarked about how my stomach and fondus (not sure correct name). Quickly regained its original shape.  I know it was from doing this Pilates video because I ate like crazy!,1356480000,,426,4.578947368421052
2394799,5,B000AXW0WS,"Really nice  pilates workouts for pregnancy.  I did not find it difficult to do and have not done much pilates before, I had done a few classes and worked with a couple of pilates videos.

The routines are of good lengths.

Highly recommended if you are looking for pilates",1350691200,,273,4.510204081632653
2394800,5,B000AXW0WS,"This video is great for someone who may not have enough time but wants an effective workout.  You can do the abdominal series (15 minutes) or the side series (21 minutes) or both, depending on how much time you have.  I find the abdominal series to be really tough, and once completing it, I feel so proud and exhausted at the same time.  Great feeling!!  Highly recommended.",1348012800,,375,4.552238805970149
2394801,3,B000AXW0WS,"I've only done Pilates once before, and have also done some exercises during ""body balance"" classes.
I knew the basic rules of holding in your ""bee line"" and the breathing technique.
As some peoples reviews have mentioned, the instructor doesn't go into too much detail about this, however I found this Program to be pretty good.
When you're doing the exercises you can feel the muscles you're supposed to be working and you do get a good workout -especially the leg exercises.
I found the abdominal exercises to be too advanced for me, will the full roll ups, so I adjusted the moves and just went half up. When in doubt I used common sense and sat those exercises out.
In all, it's an enjoyable workout and goes really quickly - very easy to fit it into your day as its broken up into two sections.",1341360000,,800,4.486301369863014
2394802,5,B000AXW0WS,"I ordered this dvd with high hopes as I am in the second trimester of my second pregnancy and have been working out almost daily throughout.  I consider myself an intermediate to advanced and found this dvd to be a great challenge!  I've done some seriously tough Pilates dvd's in my life and this was definitely a challenging workout.  My workout buddy (who is not pregnant) was feeling it just as much as I was by the end.  We are putting this in our weekly rotation!

For those who have left negative reviews - they were probably NOT in that great of shape before starting this DVD and probably not that familiar with Pilates if they required a lot of instruction in order to complete the series.  This is not for a true beginner, I agree, but it's not SO difficult that you can't figure it out after a few tries.  All of the moves I've done before in one way or the other, I think what makes this a 'pregnancy' DVD is the order in which they are done and the small modifications being made for the beginning when you are on your back.  (Side note to the one-star reviewer that states she was horrified she was being told to come to a seated position from lying flat on her back obviously did NOT watch this DVD - Niece is propped up by three blankets and is therefore performing 'assisted' situps!!) For the reviewers bemoaning the lack of stretching prior to working out - uhm, Pilates IS STRETCHING.

Anyway, if you are relatively fit and active and know how to not injure yourself doing some stretches and continuous Pilates moves, then this DVD is for you!  I am using this along with the Jennifer Wolfe's Prenatal Vinyasa DVD in addition to the Tae Bo PT 24/7 program.",1334534400,7,1677,4.415584415584416
2394803,5,B000AXW0WS,"I thought this was a very challenging DVD!  The ab section, was average, but the side section kicked my butt!!! My first DVD was scratched up by my 2 year old, so I ordered another, thats how much I like this program :)",1323993600,,219,4.093023255813954
2394804,5,B000AXW0WS,"This was a good workout, not too hard but hard enough to make you feel like you've done some work.",1312848000,,98,3.95
2394805,2,B000AXW0WS,"I appreciate the way she has modified normal Pilates moves to be safe using your abs during pregnancy and you will get a crazy burn in your hips from the side work out series but that is about all.  She does not evenly work out the whole body.  She works the abductors (hip muscles) more than any other muscle group, which was really frustrating to me.  There is ZERO upper body work done in this video.  The music is very boring and not motivating.  When I wake up in the morning and think about how I want to work out, this video is the least appealing option.  I don't recommend you get this video unless you are looking for a way to work your abs and you are REALLY concerned about your hip muscles and even then I suggest you incorporate many different workouts with this in the week our you will develop strength deficiencies in your body from over working some muscle groups and ignoring many others.",1311552000,,907,4.369047619047619
2394806,3,B000AXW0WS,"I liked the Hip section, but I beleive the abdominal excecises are too intense for a pregnant lady in the last two trimesters. I beleive they may increase the chance of diastis recti. I just did a few excecises from that section.",1302998400,,229,4.476190476190476
2394807,5,B000AXW0WS,"I am 35 weeks pregnant and still using this video - my husband often joins me, which he prefers I not share with his friends!  It is a great way to safely do strengthening and toning during pregnancy",1293926400,,199,4.2368421052631575
2394808,1,B000AXW0WS,"I am a very active person who works out 6-7 days a week.  I am an elementary PE teacher, Zumba fitness instructor, I do regular strength and weight training, and I do the Insanity DVDs by Beachbody.  I do not usually do Pilates but wanted something different to add into my workout rotation during my third trimester.  I did the video for the first time when I was 28 weeks.  I did not feel challenged at all.  I had no trouble breezing through the workout.  I agree with some of the other reviews that say she does not take adequate time for stretching.  I did this video one time and will never use it again.  Instead I ordered the Fusion Pilates pregnancy workout and will give that a shot.  It requires some weights and lasts for about an hour which sounds like more of the challenge I am looking for.",1292976000,,805,4.3133333333333335
2394809,4,B000AXW0WS,"This is a really good video with many classical Pilates moves modified to be able to do safely while expecting.  I can see where some of the reviews complained about there not being enough instruction or that is was too fast.  If you have never (or rarely do) classic mat-based Pilates, I would agree - you would probably have trouble knowing exactly what to do.  However, if like me, you have been doing mat Pilates for a while, you will recognize most, if not all, of the exercises and you know proper form already.  I am excited to see this video is a great substitute for my Pilates class (which does not offer prenatal modifications) and feel as good after this video as I do after my regular classes!",1291334400,,706,4.449612403100775
2394810,1,B000AXW0WS,"I bought this dvd based on all of the positive reviews. I am 7 months pregnant and did both segments of the video for abdomen and legs. After doing the abdomen exercises I had severe heartburn (which I know happens during some excercise) back pain and shortness of breath, so I stopped using it. After talking to my CNM (certified nurse midwife, she is also an RN) and described to her the abdominal series of exercises she was shocked this was being marketed for prenatal use and advised me to stop using it immeadiately. It is NOT recommended to do abdominal work that involves direct flexion like this. Coming to a full sit up from laying down flat on your back unassisted puts direct pressure on your abdomen and back that could be potentially harmful. How this got endorsed by the OBGYN association is beyond me but I definitely felt like it was a waste of my money and time. I gave it one star because the leg work may be worth trying again, it was definitely challenging. But I am skeptical of trying anything this dvd recommends at this point. Just goes to show you, don't always believe what you read, check with your health care practioner!",1289779200,15,1150,4.533653846153846
2394811,3,B000AXW0WS,"The exercises are modified for pregnancy and I feel they are safe, but I would like more of a challenge.  I am only 24 weeks pregnant, so perhaps as my belly grows this exercise routine will feel more rigorous.  I wouldn't recommend learning pilates in pregnancy, but if you have novice experience with pilates, this may be the video for you.  I do find the video relaxing and a nice way to cool down after a good cardio workout.  It does provide a bit of a workout, but not as much as I had hoped.",1288051200,,498,4.2105263157894735
2394812,4,B000AXW0WS,"Originally I posted that I thought this video was easy.  I am now 29 weeks along, and I've changed my mind!  It is definitely a challenging workout for pregnancy.  If you've been regularly doing Pilates and want to keep up with it, this is the video for you.  If you are new to Pilates or are not in the best shape, I would recommend another video.  This one kicks my butt!  Below is my original review.

I've been doing Pilates once a week for the past year.  I purchased this video as a supplement to my normal classes.  The routine is very similar to what we do in class for the abdominal series.  The abdominal series was easy in my opinion, being someone used to Pilates.  I am only 7 weeks along at this point, though!  The side series kicked my butt - literally!  I like the difficulty of this part of the workout, though I wish there was more work in this section on the obliques.  Then again, maybe I will think differently as I progress in my pregnancy!  All in all, a safe workout that follows the principles of Pilates.",1286928000,,1031,4.296875
2394813,4,B000AXW0WS,"I bought this video in my first trimester and am now just starting my third trimester. I have done Pilates matwork in gym classes in the past and in the last year or so just was doing (non-prenatal Gaiam) Pilates videos. During my first trimester I was a bit of a slacker - I probably did the ab section once a week or once every few weeks. In my second trimester my back starting really hurting a lot because my posture was getting bad, so I decided to stop slacking off and starting doing the video 2 to 3 times a week. My back is feeling a lot better now.

The ab/core workout is 15 minutes long and is challenging. You definitely want to feel free to hit the pause button or just rest in Child's pose if it's too hard.  Sometimes I hit pause on the DVD player to take a little break in the middle of the one routine that has 5 moves performed in a row. I often skip the bridge routine as it's really difficult. Often I do a lower back exercise instead at that point (which I wish she would have included in the video).

The legs workout will give you legs of steel. I thought my legs were strong from weights at the gym, but this workout works those small muscles you didn't know you had.  I've noticed my legs look more toned now, and I also find it helps my back feel better too - the side lying moves seem to loosen up the hips (while burning my butt cheeks). Even my non-pregnant super-fit friend who does the workout with me couldn't do the whole routine the first time.

My complaints: Now that I do this workout so frequently I'm getting really sick of the narration. I wish that Niece would have created an alternate soundtrack that just cues you to start an exercise, or switch legs, etc. Maybe set to some different music. I've been muting the video lately. I'm even thinking of just writing out the exercises and doing them without the video. Also, I have to fast forward at the start of the segments because she always introduces the video ( a chapter skip here would be nice).

Also, this is kinda silly and minor, but I often have trouble setting up the blankets in a good incline for the ab segment. I wish she would demonstrate how she sets up her incline. And if this video is to be redone in the future, I would recommend the format where you have three women working out in the studio - one for each trimester.

Overall, this has been a great workout and has helped improve my posture and decrease lower back pain.",1285545600,3,2437,4.261904761904762
2394814,4,B000AXW0WS,Great video especially for legs!  i'm dying!  Sure wish there were some moves for your arms though,1282694400,,98,4.705882352941177
2394815,4,B000AXW0WS,"I decided to try pilates, I have done yoga for years, while I was pregnant.  Because I am a runner and not flexible, I find that this pilates workout is very good for me.  I think it'd probably be good even if I wasn't pregnant, it really loosens up my hips.  It's a great butt workout, not really a good ab workout, but I guess you can't have more than one ab when pregnant!  I would recommend this product to anyone looking to get a bit of a workout while pregnant and waiting to deliver.  The woman narrating the video gets to be irritating after a while, so I put it on mute and listen to music.",1281916800,,599,4.085470085470085
2394816,1,B000AXW0WS,"This dvd has interesting exercises for doing during pregnancy, but it's focus completely for a person that needs only 15 minutes of exercise per day and only brings 2 programs, one of abdominal and breath workout of 15 mins and one for legs workout of 20 mins.  I didn't like it at all because it start with the exercises right away, no warming, no nothing and it finish with the last exercise and there is no stretching exercises or anything.  Besides, the video quality it's really bad and it takes place in a very dark room and the instructor it's dressed in dark colors too what makes difficult to follow. No worth the money.",1280448000,6,629,4.508771929824562
2394817,3,B000AXW0WS,"I purchased this videos (along with the Perfect Pregnancy Workout DVD) because I discovered I was pregnant a few weeks ago and I want to maintain a decent level of fitness throughout my pregnancy.  Just for background, I consider myself to be relatively fit, I  lift weights and perform moderate cardio a 4-5 times a week. Also, I am familiar with pilates, I own the The Method Precision Toning DVD with Jennifer Kries which I really enjoy but only do on an infrequent basis.

Pros to the program
- Instructor is pleasant and non-annoying
- There isn't any fluff or time fillers in the program

Cons to the program
- There isn't much instructional guidance for proper form on the movements or modifications for various trimesters.  She does indicate breathing patterns but this may be difficult to follow at the pace the instructor is moving.
- The setting is dimly lit and the instructor is wearing dark clothing so it is somewhat difficult to determine her leg placement on some of the moves in the side series.

I was able to follow through most of the movements *only* because I was familiar with pilates. I had trouble keeping up with the instructors pace, partially because I feel yucky (1st trimester) and partly because she moves rather fast. I think that if you are a beginner to fitness or have never done pilates before, this will likely be too much and you will be frustrated.  I also experienced hip pain with some of the side lying movements (the movements where she indicated 'internal rotation').  I don't know if I was performing them incorrectly but the joint pain was bad enough to where I had to stop (I don't experience this type of pain when squatting/lunging/leg press, etc).

I won't write off the program entirely but I will try to make it work with the rest of my training. I think if you are already skilled at pilates and enjoy it, this would be a good way to keep doing it throughout your pregnancy.  However, you might also find that the only difference between this program and another is that your ab work is done with your back on an incline of blankets, and your side series is exactly the same as if you were not preggo.",1279584000,2,2155,4.574025974025974
2394818,1,B000AXW0WS,"I was pretty disappointed with this DVD. I had just begun pilates training before I found out that I was pregnant, and found that it really was having a wonderful affect on my posture and core strength. I was hoping to continue with the training through pregnancy, and looking forward to the adapted exercises.
However, I find that Niece Pecenka does not cover ways to adapt the poses depending on your trimester, nor previous experience with pilates. She doesn't take enough time to discuss what is safe nor ways to adjust yourself to ensure you're doing the exercises correctly, especially for the first half of the DVD. I find the second half (leg & glute work) very challenging, and I do continue to do this part, but compared to other prenatal pilates & yoga dvds, I find this one really disappointing and careless.",1279238400,6,820,4.741258741258742
2394819,5,B000AXW0WS,This is the only prenatal workout I have tried so far that isn't a complete snooze fest.  This workout is actually challenging.  I was an advanced exerciser prior to pregnancy (now 21 weeks along) but have begun to struggle in my workouts in the past few weeks.  Since adding this to my rotation I have noticed added definition in my butt and thighs.  It is definitely hard but will not wipe you out.  My butt and legs are ON FIRE during the side-lying series (which I LOVE).  It does get easier with repeated use.  So far this is the only prenatal DVD I've purchased that wasn't a waste.,1278460800,,588,4.388888888888889
2394820,4,B000AXW0WS,"After reading many reviews for this and other prenatal pilates DVDs, I chose this one because most women said it was a challenging and effective workout.  I was in good shape before becoming pregnant (I ran a few times a week, lifted weights, and occasionally did yoga and pilates classes).  This workout is short (about 30 minutes when both side and abdominal series are done) but it is challenging.  The side series is especially hard on the hips, if you have weak hips like I do.  I like this workout because I feel like I accomplished something good for my body in a short amount of time.  It is great for core and leg strengthening.

There are some drawbacks to this workout. As mentioned by other reviewers, there is almost no instruction regarding body positioning during the workout.  There is no warm up or cool down.  Also, she moves through the exercises quickly and doesn't stop for water breaks, which are essential during pregnancy.",1276646400,,946,4.725609756097561

My goal was weight loss and also to be healthy.  I ordered this after reading some good reviews.  I am currently 5 months pregnant and this workout is tough.  The instructor in this video goes very fast.  I find it hard to keep up with her pace, so I don't.  I do things at my own pace.  I have to say that the exercises are great and they really work your legs and core, but dang, she needs to slow it down, I'm pregnant and I'm not trying to kill myself or my baby.  I still workout and continue to do a variety of exercises, but I find this DVD difficult.  I will keep at it though and just keep things at my own pace.",1275177600,,762,3.9215686274509802

2394823,1,B000AXW0WS,"I did this Pilates routine three times a week during my pregnancy. I caught a cold in my third trimester and took a break for a week until it was gone. Then I did the routine again and bruised my ribs on the right side. We later found out my baby was in a breech position with his head right under my right ribs. I went into early labor 5 days after bruising my ribs and delivered my baby 6 weeks early by cesarean. Furthermore, I was in shape when I started using this video (running and lifting weights regularly through my first trimester), yet I found it to be an advanced workout. Compared to other pilates DVD's I've found recently, it does not provide ANY beginner level modifications for the exercises.
I do not recommend this exercise video for any pregnant woman.",1267315200,7,773,4.4125874125874125

2394826,5,B000AXW0WS,"I'm in the 5th week of my 3rd pregnancy. I gained 45 with my first and was in terrible shape. I didn't loose the weight until after my 2nd pregnancy where I only gained 25, but started overweight. I finally lost all the baby weight and then some and now here I am for #3. I am no where near in great shape, but at least my weight is down and I'm working on it. I promised myself I would have a more healthy pregnancy this time. My diet is great, I just needed to find a workout that I would enjoy and that wouldn't take an hour of my time. I purchased 4 pregnancy workouts - 2 pilates and 2 yoga and I love them all. I looked at pretty much every prenatal workout Amazon has to offer (spent a couple days reading reviews) and am super happy with my choices. All 4 make the workout very personal, the music is great, and there isn't any of that super peppy over acting stuff like so many workouts. They are all well trained in their art and have many years of experience behind them.

#1 - Pilates During Pregnancy with Niece Pecenka
All I can say is - wow! My legs are out of shape. The ab workout is great and helps me feel open and even helped my bloated feeling pass. The leg work is a challenge and has a lot of different moves my other pilates workouts don't, but I know it will get easier as I gain strength. Some of he movements aren't always the same length, but I still love doing this workout.

#2 - Prenatal & Postnatal Yoga with Elena Brower
This is a great workout! This is my first time doing yoga, though I've done some of the moves in my regular non-pregnancy pilates workouts, and I'm loving it. It has really loosened up my stiffness and made my hips and lower back feel so much better. I thought I was going to die during my 2nd pregnancy because of all my aches and pains. I talked with many of my friends about yoga and what I should look for. They told me about how I should feel it, but not overstretch, to know what my bodies limits are. The breathing really helps. This one also has a postnatal workout I am looking forward to!

#3 - 10 minute Solution Prenatal Pilates with Lizbeth Garcia
This really energized me. It uses weights along with great moves and my heart rate was up and going. I love Lizbeth Garcia. I LOVE that you can pick which order you do the workouts in and you can do one or as many as you like! I'm looking forward to the postnatal workout after my beautiful little one arrives!

#4 - Yoga for Pregnancy Labor & Birth with Colette Crawford
I did this today and it really relaxed my body and mind (which I needed as my 3 and 5 year old were running around the house doing crazy things). It's very simple and straightforward and anyone can do it. I feel motivated after doing it and so many pressures are gone. As mentioned in some of the other reviews the girls in it aren't super skinny and that is kind of nice sometimes. She talks a lot about breathing, being in the moment, and just knowing your body. I would recommend this to anyone who just needs some time to learn to relax and do some great stretching to help with aches and pains!

I hope this helps anyone out there looking for some great workouts to stay in shape and feel in control during pregnancy. Just a side note, I've noticed working out really helps me control my cravings and wanting to over eat. It strengthens my mind and helps me feel in control.",1264809600,4,3366,4.188271604938271
2394827,3,B000AXW0WS,"I suppose it may be good if you are not used to doing much exercise.  I was in fairly good shape prior to my pregnancy, but haven't done much of anything since my pregnancy.  I'm about six months pregnant.  After this workout, I felt as if I hadn't done a workout at all.  Maybe I'm just missing the point of pilates, but I would not recommend if you intend to feel some type of workout on your major muscle groups.  The only time I felt somewhat challenged is with my hip flexors being used in a way they have never been used before.  I felt it did nothing for my biceps, triceps, hamstrings, calves, etc.  It was good if you just want to loosen up a bit.  It was relaxing.",1264032000,,674,4.130769230769231

I was in average condition when I got pregnant-- not in as good of shape as I once was due to a heavy work / school schedule, but trying to get some cardio and sculpting in here and there. I tried a prenatal yoga video, but it just bored me to tears. I admit this workout hurt-- yes hurt. My thighs and butt burn. However, it was also doable. If you like to push yourself and you aren't in great shape getting started, this workout is for you. While the moves are challenging, the workout is short (I do both together). I felt no trauma to the pelvis or to any areas where strain might be a problem for the pregnancy. I HIGHLY recommend this video. Such an efficient, challenging, yet gentle workout.",1263686400,,722,4.2773722627737225
2394829,3,B000AXW0WS,I like this video. I think it may be hard for those who did not have any experience with Pilates before pregnancy though. The only thing I did not care for was the location and this is why I am giving it 3 stars. I think this would have been the ultimate must have pregnancy video if it was taped by a sunny beach with some nature music instead of the stagnate dark warehouse.,1263686400,,376,4.094594594594595
2394830,1,B000AXW0WS,"Like some of the other reviewers, I found this workout to be lacking in a sufficient warm-up. I am very athletic (long distance runner, advanced pilates, and yoga) yet was in so much pain during the side series that I could barely finish. I didn't feel like the exercises targeted the muscles, but I certainly could feel it in my hip joints. I thought it was just me until I read some of the other reviews. I won't be using this DVD for my next pregnancy.",1262908800,3,455,4.3023255813953485
2394831,2,B000AXW0WS,"I have practiced Pilates both at home with DVDs and in a studio with a private instructor for over seven years and I wished to continue to do so during pregnancy.  Unfortunately, because so many Pilates mat exercises are performed on the back or stomach, I couldn't continue using my other DVDs (Stott Pilates, Windsor Pilates) after a certain point in pregnancy. I hoped this DVD would be the solution, but it has very limited use.

With respect to the content:
The DVD has two parts, an abdominal section and sidekick (legs) series section. Instruction in the exercises is limited and no guidance on additional modification (they come slightly modified) for different points in pregnancy is offered. I am in my third trimester and am now unable to do many of the abdominal exercises even with considerable modification of my own. With respect to the sidekick series: these exercises don't require much if any modification - even late pregnancy - and none is offered here anyway.  If you already own a Pilates DVD with a sidekick series I would recommend simply using the sidekick series section of that DVD.

In sum:

If you are in your first trimester and you have practiced Pilates regularly or are reasonably fit, you should find this DVD easy and, truthfully, you're not likely to derive much physical benefit from it.

If you are in your second trimester, this DVD may be good for you. The demonstration of exercises with back support will continue to allow you to work your abdominals with traditional Pilates moves for the core.  Unfortunately, as your belly increases in size and your mobility decreases, these exercise will grow more uncomfortable regardless of your fitness level.

If you are in your third trimester, I would not recommend this DVD.  There are other strength training exercises that you can do to stay fit that will not unduly strain the abdomen.  Challenging muscles is not the same thing as straining them and you have to accept that, in pregnancy, you will become more easily strained as the months go on.

Essentially, this DVD is good for one trimester for abdominals, a sidekick series you can find elsewhere and not much more than that - it's up to you whether or not the purchase is worth it.",1260921600,9,2229,4.793733681462141

The sections go quickly and are easy to squeeze in after work or in a spare weekend moment. I also used this as a complement to prenatal yoga; was a great balance.

It isn't long, I can squeeze it in after bath time, during nap time, or even while my son is quietly playing next to me. As a newbie it was challenging to complete, but I quickly built the strength to finish the workout. The instructor was pleasant and encouraging.

2394838,3,B000AXW0WS,"I've been looking for yoga and pilates videos to keep me fit during pregnancy. I bought this one and Shiva Rea's Prenatal Yoga. If I compare the two videos, Shiva Rea gives alot of reminders and guidelines for each stage (trimester) of pregnancy. In this video there is only one person giving instruction, and she seems to be doing the exercises as if she wasn't pregnant. Even though her back is supported by blankets and some positions slightly modified, the movements are too fast and range of motion is too wide.
For Pilates videos I like Mari Winsor's videos better because she gives specific instructions for each level and there are several people doing the workout. In this video I felt that the focus on the pilates workout more than the workout being catered to pregnant women. THere was alot of dead air time anyway, she could have added more instruction or reminders for her pregnant viewers. I'm not too fond of the music either. :(
I also find the set/location of this video to be unappealing. I don't think the warehouse atmosphere is appropriate for the theme of the video.
I gave the instructor 3 stars because she gives a lively performance. She does the exercises well and she does it while being very pregnant. She is more fit than the average pregnant woman. I wouldn't totally disregard this video. It's worth the try for those who are more fit, more active and want a challenge in their routine during pregnancy.",1251331200,,1435,4.698412698412699

I love that there are two segments so if I only have time to do the abs workout then I can save the leg workout for later (and visa versa).I've done this workout through a pregnancy and beyond. It is a great workout even when I'm not pregnant. Eliminating the folded blankets when I'm not pregnant adds even more of a challenge.

It was fun in the weeks after my delivery to progress from the suggested three blankets to none, which went much quicker than expected. I think this can be credited to doing this video  my whole pregnancy.

One complaint- this video seems a bit expensive for only 35 minutes of workout material. At a minimum for this price, the workout segments should total an hour, where the user can do the whole thing or pick-and-choose. But I guess this falls in line with pregnancy stuff generally being more expensive. However, this is why I gave it only 4 stars and not 5.",1247011200,,668,4.700854700854701

However, the length is very good, and because it wasn't as ""easy"" for me as expected, I look forward to doing it again and again until I can tell my fitness level and form has improved.

Before becoming pregnant I was in ok shape, not great shape. I took 4 weeks of pilates mat about 1 1/2 years ago, so I'm not a pilates regular. I would say my level is high beginner since I have the fundamentals but did not have a regular practice.

I totally disagree with the review that says this is too hard for a beginner or even intermediate student. I only had to stop once or twice and couldn't do the last couple of reps of the move being played- my legs were burning too much. Otherwise, I did all moves no problem. I did both sessions back to back.

The length is perfect!! You feel like you've done something but definitely not like you won't be able to finish or that it's dragging on too long. The pace is good- uptempo but not crazy. The instructor is soothing and does not over-explain anything. She is easy to get the feel of the move from quickly.

Your thighs will be burning while doing this, it really does work!  I did not have a problem with viewing the movements like some others have mentioned.  Niece's pants are dark and so is the mat, but I could still tell exactly what she was doing.  The only point that I really didn't like was when she is standing up, the camera cuts her legs off and you can't really see the movement as well, but this doesn't interfere that much.

2394854,5,B000AXW0WS,"I've been on the hunt for a challenging yet safe pilates video to do while pregnant.  In my first pregnancy, I had the luxury of doing pilates on machines with private and semi-private lessons, which I continued for 2 years post-pardum.  Unfortunately for me, we have moved away from my beloved pilates studio and I have been unable to find a new studio at an affordable cost to continue machine work.  Luckily, I feel that my experience gave me a good foundation in order to do this video at the pace it is performed at, while still maintaining proper pilates form.  Without my previous experience, I think doing the exercises properly and effectively would be frustrating and very very difficult.
After no abdominal workouts for during my first trimester due to awful ""morning"" sickness, my muscles are very week, and I did have a more difficult time with the exercises than I'm used to having when in shape, however I am completely confidant that with consistent practice, this video will get me labor-ready and back in shape.
The video is broken up into 2 distinct sections, the first being for ab work, the second for leg/butt work.  If you are not in the best shape to begin with, I would recommend only doing one section at a time, and not overdoing it in the beginning by doing the entire video.  Pilates is very effective and you will quickly be able to do both sections together, should you choose.
I chose this video knowing from other reviews it would be challenging and best for more experienced practitioners, and I completely agree.  It is FABULOUS for me, and I'm thrilled that I was able to find a workout to do at home that is worth my time.",1240099200,,1659,4.603389830508474

The stretching and light exercises are good but I don't feel like it really works me hard enough to be called a workout.  If you want more challenging workouts I would try Hotmama's Challenging Prenatal Workout with Teddi Bryant, The Perfect Pregnancy Workout with Karyn Steben, or Erin O'Brien's Prenatal Fix.

Before getting pregnant I went to a regular class on the pilates beds, so doing mat work isn't my favorite - but the DVD is great. I appreciate that it's still somewhat challenging, yet enjoyable AND that the instructor is pregnant, as well. You can do as much (or as little) as what's comfortable.

Do note that the two sections: abs/lower body do not include any arm/upper body works. That's my ONLY complaint. But, I'd buy this DVD again if given the choice.",1235347200,,610,4.486486486486487

2394860,3,B000AXW0WS,"The video is good, but it lacks guidance and explanations or modifications for different trimesters, especially the third one. Also the background is very dark, and if you were to watch it on a computer, like I do, the details are hard to distinguish, such as the proper leg positioning etc.
In terms of difficulty, I have done Pilates before and did not think it was difficult.
Another concern is the stretches which are almost none for legs.
In terms of recommending, I would say buy it if you don't find anything better. Otherwise, buy something else.",1235088000,,554,4.721649484536083
2394861,5,B000AXW0WS,"I love this workout! For those who would like a break down of the pros and cons, here they are.

Pros:
-The instructor is pleasant but doesn't talk too much
-breathing is explained and easy to follow
-well organized, good length
-Can be broken up into two smaller workouts if you are feeling tired
-Will definitely tone the lower body

Cons:
-While I do not find the moves difficult, this DVD is not for the newbie to pilates. The moves are not broken down as they would need to be for a beginner. Also, technique is not given in detail. It seems that it is expected you are familiar with pilates.
-Took a LONG time to get to me. This is a popular DVD and was hard to get my hands on. From the time I ordered it from Amazon it took almost 3 months to get to me....ORDER EARLY!

I will definitely be adding this to my pregnancy workout routine (and postnatal!). For those who are worried about reviews that say you are on your back too long, this is not the case. The ab work is done while being propped up (the instructor uses blankets, I like to use pillows) and at no point are you flat on your back. Aside from feeling I nice burn in my bum during the leg work, I was comfortable throughout the whole workout.

I will definitely be recommending this DVD to anyone who asks for pregnancy workout tips.",1235088000,,1303,4.2631578947368425

Also Niece is really pleasant but not cheezy at all like some workout videos I have seen. Hope You enjoy as much as I do.,1234742400,,421,4.209876543209877

You might as well just do a normal Pilates workout, but lean against some pillows. I found this very lacking as a specifically ""pregnancy"" workout video.",1228176000,,494,5.036585365853658

The instructor also does not talk you through the movements, which is difficult since you're supposed to be looking down toward your belly, not at the TV screen.

I am a fairly active person with a high fitness level, although I had only done a moderate amount of Pilates workouts.  Much to my surprise, I found this DVD challenging even before I got pregnant!  I chose not to use the blankets for obvious reasons, but will reincorporate those as I enter my third trimester.  The abs series was not overly challenging before I became pregnant, but once I was, it was just the right level of ""stress"" I would be willing to take on during the pregnancy.  The side series...well it is great, regardless of whether you are pregnant or not.  I am a distance runner, and I can tell you from the first workout I felt a lovely level of burn in my hips and thighs...not too much, just enough to confirm I had accomplished something.  I look forward to using this workout throughout my pregnancy, and afterwards to get back into shape.  I recommend this DVD for any level of fitness, starting before the actual pregnancy where possible.  For those totally new to pilates, who were unable to start it before the pregnancy, I recommend doing fewer reps and pausing as often as necessary to do some stretching.  While I agree with some reviewers that there is not enough focus at times on the perfect positioning, a little research on the fundametals of pilates stances can help offset this weakness in the video.",1218931200,,1499,4.601503759398496

The dvd is calming but does not waste a lot of time explaining moves and you can just fly through the workout (if you have little kids waiting to be entertained, a quick no-nonsense workout is handy). I really like the instructor and like that she is visibly pregnant and decently clothed. I also had to pause the video a few times because my muscles were really burning the first three or four times I did the workout (and a day or two afterwards).

This along with Shiva Rea's Prenatal Yoga and Steben's Amazing Pregnancy Workout are the perfect workout combination for me, and I think it's why I feel so full of energy this pregnancy.",1217980800,,861,4.584415584415584

2394876,5,B000AXW0WS,"Let me first preface that this is Geoff's wife writing this review.

I was a little nervous to try this DVD after reading the 1 star review by a physician who was injured by this workout.  I am familiar with Pilates and have practiced for approximately 5 years before the conception of my first & current pregnancy.  I was 26 weeks when I began this particular DVD.  Most OBs will advise you to NOT take up a ""new"" form of exercise during your pregnancy.  If you have NO Pilates experience prior to pregnancy, then this may NOT be the video for you.  I use additional modifications not shown on this DVD when I perform these exercises to make them more comfortable for my stage of pregnancy.  You're better off to take a prenatal Pilates class if you have no experience & are unfamiliar with additional modifications.  If you do have experience, however, you may be very delighted with this purchase.  I feel great after I complete this workout & there are only 3 exercises I completely avoid on it (the 2 twisting ones on the AB section, and the laying flat on your back leg stretch on the Legs section).",1216944000,,1105,4.485
2394877,3,B000AXW0WS,"I was really excited to receive this DVD, since I wanted to add another pregnancy workout DVD to mix things up. I am currently using ""The Perfect Pregnancy Workout"" on a daily basis, which I love, but I'm starting to get a little bored doing the same thing every day.
Here are my Pros and Cons with the ""Pilates During Pregancy"" workout:

Pros:
- The instructor was not the least bit annoying
- The spoken instructions for each exercise were easy to follow
- At 36 minutes, this workout is not too long or too short
- Very little equipment is needed: a workout mat and three blankets

Cons:
- The lighting is very dark throughout the whole DVD, and the instructor is wearing dark, long pants, a dark, long-sleeve shirt, and does all the exercises on a dark workout mat. Do you see where I'm going with this? It's really hard to see what's going on. At times, you have to rely entirely on her spoken instructions, which thankfully are very good, to follow along.
- The camera work is kind of off at times. For example, the camera shows the instructor's face, while she is explaining and doing a leg exercise, instead of showing her legs. That's kind of dumb.
-  I don't know how the instructor does it, but I couldn't do half of the exercises the way she did them, because my growing belly was in the way (I'm 26 weeks).
- The workout is brutal. I was able to somewhat struggle through the abdominal section, taking lots of breaks, but the side leg series was brutal. My hip hurt so bad, I had to stop doing the exercises. And it wasn't the good kind of hurt that you feel when you are getting a good workout. It was just plain pain. I almost couldn't get up from the floor because it hurt so much.
- At times, during the abdominal section, my belly felt very uncomfortable. I even experienced some piercing pain in my stomach, which freaked me out a little.
- Section II, the side leg series is actually 21 minutes long, not 30 minutes as stated.

This DVD got a lot of positive reviews, so I figured I was going to like it a lot, but it just didn't work for me. I hope I can return it for a refund and try a different pregnancy pilates DVD. The ""10 Minute Solution Prenatal Pilates"" DVD looks good. Until then, I'll stick to ""The Perfect Pregnancy Workout"" which always makes me feel great afterwards.",1214006400,5,2302,4.346511627906977
2394878,5,B000AXW0WS,"I love this video. I have been doing it since my 14th week of pregnancy and wish that I had it sooner. I like how combined it is only 36 minutes, which gives you a quick workout (I was using it 5 times a week).  My legs and core have been strengthened tremendously from this video.  I am now in my 28th week of pregnancy, and am still using it (but not as frequently, as I notice that some of the core moves have been difficult).  I use this video and the Prenatal Vinyasa Yoga Video with Jennifer Wolfe (a must have for those who did yoga before pregnancy).",1213747200,,558,4.10091743119266

2394880,4,B000AXW0WS,"This is a tough workout but felt great!  The exercises are fast paced and really work your core and thighs.  There's not much in the way of basic pilates instruction about breathing and the movements (i.e. making sure the moves originate from the core, rather than your thighs and how to modify for beginners), though, so if you're new to pilates I'd recommend taking a class first to make sure you learn effective breathing techniques and can modify the exercises on your own.",1211587200,,477,4.734939759036145
2394881,5,B000AXW0WS,"I got several prenatal pilates DVDs off netflix before I bought this one.  Most are boring and I never felt like I did anything.  THe instructor moves through the movements quickly enough to keep boredom away. The abdominal section is good for maintaining core strength while pregnant.  The side kick series is a good challenge.  I did this with my mother-in-law and her comment on the side kick section was ""does it feel like someone is stabbing your butt with a knife?""

2394883,4,B000AXW0WS,"This is an excellent Pilates video I think I will use even after I have the baby.  I am a beginner to Pilates so I know I need to practice more to keep my core more stable to make the exercises more efficient for me.

I feel she does the movements almost too fast.  I don't have a problem understanding what she wants, but I feel the movements should be slightly slower.  That is only my opinion though.

I wasn't able to do all the repetitions today because towards the end my posterior and hamstrings were burning, but in a good way.  I am sure if I am persistent though that in a couple of weeks I will be much stronger.  I have learned the hard way not to push my body more than it can handle.  My advice is not to feel bad if you cannot do all the repetitions or all the exercises right away.  Take your time.  It's better to move at a slower pace than to feel overachieving and then injure your body.",1208044800,,906,4.067796610169491

I started at 11 weeks and am now 14 weeks and have found that it is still effective and expect it to be even more so further into my pregnancy.,1207785600,,436,3.965909090909091

It's wonderfully split into 2 sections so you can do as much or as little as you have time to do.
It is CHALLENGING, which I found FABULOUS, because I didn't want to be ""babied"".  I wanted to be comfortably ""pushed"" to truly get a workout.

2394888,5,B000AXW0WS,"I have been doing this tape since week 6 of my pregnancy.  I am currently over 38 weeks pregnant and am STILL doing this thing, even through mild contractions.  People ask me all the time how I kept my legs and butt in shape during pregnancy.  Before I got preggers, I was a serious runner and did very strenuous workouts.  I thought that there was no way I would keep my weight down after removing those types of workouts.  I did this tape 3-5 times a week and supplemented only with a quick arm workout (3 sets reverse pushups) and a 30 minute walk 3 times weekly.  I gained a total of 35 pounds with the pregnancy but have remained toned and tight (from the waist down....i cannot speak for my puffy face!)
Niece's voice is calm and relaxing.  My hubby LOVES when I do this tape because between the calm music and the relaxing routine it is very stress-relieving.
If nothing else convinces you of buying this tape, try this:
I was packing my hospital bag today and looking for a ""going home"" outfit for me.  I dared to try on my pre-preg jeans.  Now, my size 2s will take a little time, but I ended up packing a pair of SIZE 4 jeans to come home in.  They have stretch to them....let's not go overboard here.  BUT I must say that a size 4 that can button over a currently 160 pound body is a true testament to the lower-body capabilities of this tape!

2394890,3,B000AXW0WS,"Definitely one of the more expensive options on the market, but based on the reviews I selected this DVD. It provides a good work out - even if you were fit before starting. Many of the techniques are standard pilates moves, but she shows you how to be safe in pregnancy. One problem I did have - and this goes for many fitness instructors/DVDs- You shouldn't wear black pants when showing leg moves... it makes it much more difficult to see the moves especially in something like pilates where the moves are small and controlled... for that reason I wouldn't recommend this DVD if you have not done pilates before as identifying the moves can be tricky. However if you know basic pilates already it does give a good work out.",1202428800,,726,4.549618320610687

I have been doing Pilates for 4 years and did not expect to be challenged by a pregnancy-modified version of the exercises.  I was thrilled to find this video because I was concerned that I wasn't going to be able to continue doing Pilates during pregnancy and did not wish to lose the fitness that I had gained.

I like that it is divided into 2 segments and that it has a section devoted solely to abdominals, an area often left out of or glossed over in most pregnancy workout videos.  The side-lying section is especially challenging and would be even for non-pregnant exercisers.  Your glutes will burn and you may even want to pause it about 2/3 of the way through the segment for an extra stretch.  My only critique is that she performs the rond de jambe sequence a little too fast for optimal benenfit. It's great to do both segments at once or do one segment when pressed for time or on a low-energy day.",1201564800,,1006,4.405405405405405

This tape is definitely not for beginners and those not familiar with pilates.  In that case, it could do much more harm than good.  If you've been to pilates classes or have done other videos consistently and are able to cue yourself to hold your body in correct alignment and know your limits then I found it to be a good workout.",1200700800,,486,4.355555555555555

I had been doing Pilates for about a year on a consistent basis before becoming pregnant.  I had always been urging my instructor to make a video as she was an excellent teacher and her classes were very rewarding.  Of course, she never did make a DVD but this one, specifically Niece herself, gives that same feeling of satisfaction upon completion.  The abdominal series is a little less intensive than I'm used to but of course, being pregnant one has to be careful to not overdo it.  Also, as other reviews have said, the side series is really challenging and I have to admit I wasn't able to finish it completely which I feel is a great thing because it gives me a goal to work toward.  It is definitely a product that can be used post-pregnancy as it certainly is challenging enough.  I would very much recommend warming up a little with some breathing exercises and some gentle movements just to get the blood flowing as the DVD jumps right into the abdominal series from the get go.  I also supplemented some additional Pilates exercises for those areas that are missed.

I did some research on the fundimentals of pilates and was able to master the moves and workouts.  More importantly the instructor says as the beginning of the workout that she feels you will have ""a quick delivery and a speedy recovery"" if you do her workouts regularly through your pregnancy.  Well, my labor was maybe 6 hours (active) and I only had to push through one contraction.  Yup, it went fast.  Recovery was a breeze.  I went home from the hospital the day after my daughter was born.  I over did it a bit that night but within 2 days of being home I was back to functioning normally and actually started daycare back up (I run one at home) when my daughter was 9 days old.

The reason I did not give 5 stars is because not many people (even ones in pretty good shape) will be able to do the abdominal workout along with her.

In other words, this was my first ""Pilates"" video and I had to do EXTRA  research after starting it to perform the poses without injury and effectively (I'm pretty determined)~ I could tell that my body was not aligned properly because alot of the poses were uncomfortable and my yoga knowledge was NOT enough to perform this dvd safely...there are other dvd's for prenatal pilates that if you are a beginning pilates person or even intermediate you may be better served to buy.

There are two series to this DVD: abdomen and sides.  I like how it gives you the option to do either series one at a time or both straight through.  Abdomen section wasn't too difficult, but the sides section was challenging.  I could really feel my legs and hips burning and working.  All workouts were done evenly on both sides.

It does not include arm or shoulder exerises (most pilate workouts don't).  If you are looking for a workout that exercises all parts of your body, I recommend The Perfect Pregnancy Workout.  This DVD includes little bit of pilates but something even beginners who are not familar pilates can do.

*Update - December 2010
I ended up having a C-section.  When my doctor opened me up, he complimented me on my stomach muscles (the strangest compliment I ever received but great nevertheless).  I had a very quick recovery after my surgery and the post-surgery pain was fairly durable.  I was mostly on Motrin by the second day, which was pretty good considering I have a very low pain tolerance and this was my first and only surgery. I used this DVD 3-4 times a week up until the last 3 weeks of my pregnancy (I was having severe pelvic pain so I couldn't exercise at all).  The strength of my stomach muscles which led to my quick recovery was probably largely due to this workout.  Even though I'm not pregnant now, I still do this workout, just without the pillows and blankets.",1177977600,2,1676,4.555183946488294

The isolated leg movements basically caused me to sprain my pelvis.  In addition to being unable to walk and having to give up exercise *entirely* for several weeks, I've spent hundreds of dollars seeking treatment for this injury.

The video is divided into two sections--a 15 minute abs section and a 25 minute legs/side lying series section.  It is no-nonsense, and Niece is visibly pregnant while doing everything (apparently effortlessly) and guiding you through it.  It's well-cued, and everything essential to doing Pilates correctly is covered.  You can do this throughout your entire pregnancy.

The toning for your hips, butt, and thighs cannot be overemphasized.  My legs look great, even though I'm 7 months pregnant.  And you definitely feel you've done a workout--your butt muscle will feel like it's about to fall off during the side-lying series.  I recommend you keep the remote close by so you can pause it and stretch for a longer period of time than what she does after you finish each side during that series, because you will be feeling the burn!

1) She is wearing black tights on a black mat - not easy to see what she is doing.

2)All the exercises are done way to fast - not slowish and regulated but really fast - not like i do at Pilates

3) She does not rest at all in between exercises - not even for a few seconds before continuing - i was pausing the DVD the whole time and like i said i have been doing Pilates for over 2 years it is not rushed!.

4) The stretch she does after the lower body exercises is no where near  long enough to be effective - a stretch has to be at least 20 seconds to have an effect on the muscles.

5) She does not explain any of the exercises properly (how your body should be placed which specific muscle you should be feeling/using etc.) so you don't know if you are doing it correct or not.

6) There are no upper body exercises to strengthen back muscles, arms, shoulder blades or posture - exercises all very important while pregnant.

In short a very good workout if you really know what you are doing, If you don't really know Pilates before I would go as far as saying it can be bad for your body (especially if you're pregnant) - I spent the whole workout telling the DVD to `SLOW DOWN'",1170028800,80,1339,4.123076923076923

I loved that DVD  it was fast paced and very chalenging.  Sense I had to stop doing the exercises I've been trying to find a good replacement for it while I'm pregnant.

Now that I'm exercising in between an infant's naps, I keep track of how long the segments of exercise are--and unless I'm crazy, which I may well be in my sleep-deprived state, the second segment is only 21 minutes, not 30. That's a really big deal when you think you're doing 30 minutes and that's what it states on the packaging and on Amazon's website. And I am disappointed to discover the discrepancy! That's almost 30% of the lower body workout I'm being gypped out of!! So my rating reflects a 40% discount from 5 stars, a little more than was taken from me...",1155513600,,971,4.3646408839779
2394957,5,B000AXW0WS,That's the great thing about this dvd!  You can do it and it's a real pilates workout.  I did this workout with my pregnant friend and was hooked!  You can choose to get rid of the blankets for the inclines if you aren't pregnant.  It's challenging and clear and easy to follow.  I highly recommend this dvd!,1154908800,2,308,4.333333333333333
2394978,5,B000AXW0WS,"I've done Pilates for several years now and wanted to continue during my pregnancy. I stumbled onto this video and after reading all the good reviews, decided it was definitely worth a try.  Let me tell you, This workout is fabulous!

The first 15 minutes is a light ab workout, perfect for your swelling belly. The next 30 minutes focuses on your legs and butt and it's a heck of a workout. My legs were screaming the first time I finished this video. I was pleasantly surprised. Most pregnancy videos I've found aren't really workout videos at all, this one definitely is. I love this video. Try it, you won't be sorry.",1153699200,5,621,4.535714285714286
2394979,5,B000AXW0WS,"I really enjoy this tape. I got a very good workout with this tape and I've been doing pilates on and off for several years. I also like the instructor, she isn't annoying like some can be.",1151798400,4,189,4.135135135135135
2394980,5,B000AXW0WS,"This DVD is awesome!  Clear direction, easy to follow but challenging!  It will keep you moving - but safe for each trimester.  I am a beginning Pilates student - I started with private reformer sessions when I was 12 weeks pregnant- I am now 7 months along and have added the dvd to my routine.  I have no trouble at all following the routine. My legs actually get more work from this DVD than I do with my private sessions. LOVE it!!!",1151452800,6,436,4.280487804878049
2394981,3,B000AXW0WS,"The workout routine was well designed, yet I felt correct posture was not well explained for most of the video and due to poor image quality it was difficult to determine correct posture by observing the instructor.

I liked that it was fast, yet I wish she had taken more time to explain alignment, which is critical not only for prenatal, but also for an effective workout (who wants to do 100 leg lifts if not working the right muscles?)

All and all, an okay workout.",1151280000,9,471,4.465116279069767
2394982,5,B000AXW0WS,"This is an excellent video.  Niece Pecenka has such a calm, real demeanor and has put together a very nice prenatal pilates workout.  I enjoy the challenge of mat pilates, and this routine does not disappoint!  She starts off with the 'abdominal series' where she has modified the standard mat pilates abdominal series to be do-able when you are quite pregnant.  I am in my 3rd trimester and have no problem with the moves (just a little trouble with the endurance aspect!).  Then she moves into a series of leg raises that will burn your hips like crazy!  Doing this routine has the added benefit of relieving back and pelvic pain - probably from strengthening your core and loosening up your hips.  You will enjoy it!",1150675200,44,719,4.658730158730159
2394983,5,B000AXW0WS,"I was so thrilled to find a prenatal pilates dvd that is well produced and challenging. The length of this is perfect at about 40 min, and it is split into two sections, abdominals and a side and standing leg series. I love that the abs section is modified with blankets/pillows on an incline. The instructor and set are great too.

I plan on doing this once or twice a week to stay toned. Highly recommend this one.",1150070400,48,416,4.333333333333333
2394984,5,B000AXW0WS,"Very fluid DVD - no stopping to explain how to do the motions, just an explanation as she is doing it.  I have taken pilates for 5 years pre-pregnancy and the leg work on this one is still a challenge to me!  I love that the instructor is pregnant, it makes you feel safe doing all of the exercises.  The first part lasts 15 minutes and is done entirely on a mat.  The second part is 30 minutes and is all lower body work (and balance/coordination too)!  LOVE this DVD because it is not too easy.",1149552000,6,496,4.125
2394985,5,B000AXW0WS,"I am in my third trimester and love this workout! The exercises don't bore me and have been slightly modified without sacrificing the strengthening results. If you are new to pilates, you may find the moves initially to be a little too rapid.",1149120000,7,242,4.651162790697675
2394986,5,B000AXW0WS,I love this!  I am finally happy to say that I have found a non-froofy prenatal workout.  She does a nice job modifying the moves for pregnancy AND the dvd is good for ALL trimesters.  No having to figure out which ones to do.  If you get frustrated with the slow pace of workouts like Shiva Rae's yoga tape as I did you will be happy with this one.  I just wish that she did an upper body workout too so I don't have to switch tapes.  I will definitely look for any other dvds she decides to put out.,1148601600,,501,3.96
2394987,5,B000AXW0WS,"I have been doing Pilates for some time now - 6 years or so...and have actually taken the steps to get certified to teach someday (after the baby - I'm 7 months along.) I love this routine because it is taught similar to a class format. It is the closest DVD that I've found to taking an actual class - which is what I wanted.

I am a fan of ""pure"" Pilates - classical - if you will. I love the fact that this routine is ""PILATES"" - it is not a yoga/stretch/cardio/weight-lifting/put your hand on your belly and breath class.

This routine is ""movement.""  Joseph Pilates, himself, taught in a way that emphasized precision, flow, movement with the breath, and concentration.  I am so happy to have finally found a video that has incorporated these principals into a routine designed for pregnancy.

The first section is every move from the ""intermediate"" mat routine that can be done while pregnant.  The second section is the entire side leg series - love it!!

I have continued to use this DVD again and again. It is definately one that I highly recommend!!",1147564800,16,1059,4.542105263157895
2394998,4,B000AXW0WS,"I like the fact that this workout is broken into two segments.  After one segment I'm tired and done for and can do the other segment the next day.

If you are familiar with pilates, the workout is doable, however if you are new to pilates the moves are not explained very well.",1147564800,9,278,4.226415094339623
2394999,4,B000AXW0WS,"I got this DVD to add a little extra something to my everyday routine. Since I had been practicing pilates, I didn't think that being pregnant would make a big difference. I'm not sure if I overestimated myself or underestimated this workout, but you definately get your money's worth with this purchase. The only reason that I gave it 4 stars is that I feel she does the moves too quickly and doesn't allow enough time to fully develope each move. Also, those who have never done pilates may be confused at first since there is little instruction on each move. Otherwise, it's a great investment!",1147132800,5,597,4.6415094339622645
2395000,5,B000AXW0WS,"I am a fairly fit person and I have taken pilates for a couple years now. This DVD has one of the most killer leg workouts I've ever done. Your butt, thighs and calves will be burning incredibly by the end. I highly recommend it for pregnant and non-pregnant people.",1146355200,10,266,4.34
2395001,4,B000AXW0WS,"I really like the pilates routine on this dvd, which is broken into 2 segments, abs (15 min) and lower body (30 min). It is a great pilates workout - pregnant or not! In fact, I found the lower body routine to be more strenuous than the ""regular"" pilates videos I've used! The only significant modification I could identify is that the ab exercises are done propped on pillows. This doesn't make it much different from any other pilates dvd, but it is nice having a pregnant instructor. :) She is pleasant but not cheesy. The dvd could be improved upon by having a more attractive setting (it is in a very bland room) and some relaxation and stretching at the end. The routine ends somewhat abruptly. Overall I am very happy with this dvd and know it will go to good use over the next few months!",1146009600,8,796,4.385135135135135

2395003,5,B000AXW0WS,I own several pregnancy dvd's and this one is the on the top of the list!!!  It is a workout - which is nice because it does not put me to sleep like the rest of the dvd's that I own.  I feel like I have accomplished something after completing this.  It gets right to the point - not alot of chit chat! I highly recommend this dvd - especially if you have worked out before getting pregnant and know a bit about Pilates.,1143676800,2,420,3.9761904761904763
2395004,3,B000AXW0WS,"As far as videos go, I guess it's OK.  The flow is good and it's not cheesy.  I just didn't find it all that helpful and don't see myself doing the workout.  I can do the same exercises by myself while watching more entertaining TV.  The workout consists of basic ab series stuff which she does leaning against a stack of folded blankets that offer a slight incline.  Then a few things like spine stretch and roll-up.  The second part is a bunch of side kicks and butt work, which was challenging.

It's not a good video if you don't already know pilates as she doesn't really go over a lot of the techniques that make pilates effective and challenging.

In general, it was an OK workout for pregnant people, but it didn't give me the info I was looking for as to what's good to do and what's not good to do during the different trimesters and how to modify traditional pilates exercises.",1143417600,5,888,4.371951219512195

I became too nervous to continue my full Pilates routine when I entered into my second trimester, but wanted to still find challenge with my practice.  The skills in this video are all traditional Pilates skills with only a few modifications, so there was no learning curve, and still quite a bit of challenge.  Note that this workout  may be difficult for someone that has never done Pilates in the past as it does not review basic Pilates posture or core engagement.",1425168000,,570,4.66

I only ended up doing this a few times and then changing out for another exercise video.  Her intro is long and unnecessary after the first watch, so it was annoying to have to watch it every time.  She doesn't do the best job of explaining the positioning of the body either.  She says not to rock in your back, but not what to do if you can't help it (decrease range of motion? slow down?).  A few of the hip moves made my hip literally crack/pop and I was left unsure whether the move was even safe.  Also, I didn't really feel like this workout was even doing anything for me.  I realize I didn't do it enough to see a difference, but I practically felt like I hadn't worked out when I was done.  Really disappointed it this one.",1421625600,,843,4.225
