They continue to collect dust on my DVD rack but I do occasionally take them out to watch them. I always put them back though. First time I tried, I made it through the warm up (Im not completely out of shape either).",1445472000,,310,4.098360655737705

8633213,5,B00HKM29QE,"Jeanette Jenkins is NO joke! She's very inspiring, she's very informative & she has more energy than the energizer bunny! I love that Kelly Rowland is involved. I first learned of this duo in Shape Magazine w/Kelly Rowland on the cover. You won't be disappointed. More than your money's worth!",1428796800,,293,4.88
8633214,4,B00HKM29QE,The bikini boot camp is difficult. Don't care for the yoga dvd. The others are ok but I prefer Jillian michaels,1425168000,,111,4.333333333333333

8633216,2,B00HKM29QE,"I received this set in two days, and was very happy about that. The music is horrible in each video! I do not think it will keep me motivated while working out. The moves are great but I am not feeling the music at all!:(",1410998400,,221,3.933333333333333

8633219,5,B00HKM29QE,"I got all 5 of her DVDs for $50 and considering the level of workout you get, this is an amazing deal. She breaks her workouts into chapters which keeps you from getting bored. It's tough and I am seeing results (10 pounds in 3.5 weeks). She's a great instructor and offers creative and challenging workouts.",1397779200,,308,4.517857142857143
8633220,5,B00HKM29QE,"WOW, these workouts are awesome! I am a 25 year old female and enjoy the most challenging workouts. I used to primarily run for exercise, when I ran track and cross country in high school and college. I started running less and looked into workout videos. I did Insanity for a while, also did P90x here and there, have a few Jillian Michaels DVDs, but wanted something new because I did those two workouts so many times. I found ""POPSUGAR Fitness"" on youtube, with 10 minute workouts, where I discovered Jeanette. She only has two 10 minute workouts on there, but they were so challenging that I finally bought her workouts. I enjoy all 5, but Bikini Bootcamp and Cardio Kickboxing are my favorites.

1. Bikini Bootcamp - Broken up into 5 chapters: Warmup (5mins), Cardio Camp (28mins), Chisel Camp (25mins), Ab Camp (9mins), and Stretch Camp (8mins). I usually do the warmup, cardio camp, and stretch for a nice 40 minute workout. I am nice and sweaty afterwards and am definitely challenged. Jeanette uses plyometric moves, jumping jacks (and star jacks, which are similar, but I find them to be more challenging) and other interesting moves. I like it because you are constantly moving, no breaks at all, with some new and interesting moves I have not done before.

2. Cardio Kickboxing - This is the best kickboxing workout I have found, definitely. I have done the workout on P90x, Jillian Michaels, a few others here and there. This one is much more challenging. Some of Jeanette's moves are less-traditional, but they are also more dynamic and very challenging. The workout is 89 minutes total, broken up into 10-15 minute chapters. I usually do the warmup, first 3 chapters, and stretch. Sometimes the 4th. The last two chapters are abs. Love this workout.

3. Sexy Abs Cardio Sculpt - This workout is also very challenging, and features Kelly Rowland. It is cardiovascular plus targeted ab moves. I have not done this one has much as the first two because it is more challenging for me, but I will once I work myself up to it!

4. Sexy Abs - similar to #3, but less cardiovascular. Is good when you are too tired to do #1-3.

5. Power Yoga - Just did it once, only because I am not really into yoga. I am trying to get more into it though, and this one is a good ""transitional"" yoga video for those who cannot slow down that much. You are constantly moving and it is not too slow. Seems good, but again, I only did it once, and did not do the whole thing.

Overall I really love these videos. I find them to be more professional than its competitors because there is less ""chatting"" in Jeanette's videos, which I find to be a little annoying. She just keeps giving instructions, encouragement, and is always positive. I like Jillian's workouts, but find it annoying when she says ""this move sucks, but we're going to do it anyway!"" If you don't want to do it, why would I?? Jeanette, on the other hand, is always positive, encouraging, and makes everything sound like it is going to be fun. Love her attitude. Great deal on these 5 awesome workouts.",1396656000,5,3058,4.581352833638026
