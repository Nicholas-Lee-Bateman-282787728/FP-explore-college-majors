1196244,5,B000006QQ6,"This is a good movie about how the Jews came to run Hollywood, and Broadway, for most of the last century. Of course, it is somewhat biased because we are so immersed in the culture of Jewish Hollywood movies now, and the whole film is from the Jewish perspective. It is difficult for Americans now to ""think outside the Jewish box"" so we are automatically biased. At one point the film says that Jews made only 2 anti-nazi movies before the war. This is so absolutely untrue that it is laughable. I have seen several anti-German pre-war films (not the two they mentioned) not to mention the books and comic-books they published against Germany and the Nazis. Charles Lindbergh went on tour speaking out and warning America before the war that Jews were the ""war agitators"" even... Anyway, the movie does show clearly how and why Jews took over the movie industry. It even gives some insight as to why they promoted and fomented communist revolution in Russia against the Czar. It helps you understand these people and is a great example of how they tend to go straight for the lines of communication in any nation they enter as a ""diaspora"" people as part of their strategy.

You can see why Mel Gibson is not likely to do many more big-role movies in Hollywood after what he said, and after ""The Passion of the Christ""... Anyone interested in US politics, and understanding the politics of Hollywood especially would do well to watch this. It answers questions I have always wondered about. Riveting. Highly recommended.",1223596800,52,1905,5.711267605633803
1196245,5,B000006QQ6,"This film follows the life experiences of Hollywood's future movie moguls, as they migrated to America, to escape persecution and have a slice of the American dream. The film traces their journey from New york to Hollywood where they ruled the movie industry for over thirty years. First hand accounts are told through a series of interviews with their children and grandchildren. In addition, there are comments by film historians, critics, actors and producers. A real eye opener. Fascinating.

7904720,5,B000006QQ6,A marvelous and insightful study of the Jewish migration to Hollywood and the remarkable transformation they brought to the entertainment industry. It was an eye-opener for me. Whatever you think you know about Hollywood there is still something to learn from this adventurous documentary.,1465689600,,289,5.590909090909091
7904721,4,B000006QQ6,"A decent documentary on the initial making of the studio system now known as Hollywood, Ca. Most of the Studio ""bosses"" finding S. Ca. their home were of Jewish descent and this program is from the Jewish perspective. It's 100 minutes long, sound and picture quality are fairly good for a standard DVD. For a more thorough documentary I would recommend ""Moguls and Movie Stars: A History of Hollywood"". It is 7 episodes over 3 DVDs. Exceptional! This one here is a mere ""sampling"" of the entire story that took place.",1426377600,2,517,4.6923076923076925
7904722,5,B000006QQ6,"One of the most amazing documentaries I have ever seen. The book describes how the immigrant Jewish people from Eastern Europe literally created the paradigm of ""America"" which permeates every level of American life today. The Jewish moguls of Hollywood taught us how to think about our own country.",1370649600,2,299,5.122448979591836
7904723,5,B000006QQ6,"This is a great documentary an so many different levels. I love old movies and after seeing this I see the influence of the Jewish moguls on American life, man we have so much to be grateful for. They helped shape our country in a good way.

7904727,4,B000006QQ6,"With the immigration debate raging on today this film makes for an interesting watch. Like all films on Hollywood history it whitewashes the famous Hollywood Ten, Communist and Leftist writers and are shown as victims of a witch hunt. This film takes the viewer back to the start of the film industry in Hollywood and how the Jewish studio moguls shaped the industry and America's view of itself. This documentary is only a primer.
