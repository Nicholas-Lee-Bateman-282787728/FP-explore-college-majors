8237917,5,B0010K67ME,Actually kind of charming! NONE of the chefs featured would have a PRAYER on on a REAL broadcast format...but their clumsiness (and lack of a stylist!) Is oddly endearing.,1519171200,,171,4.931034482758621
8237918,5,B0010K67ME,"I loved the DVD.
It really teaches you not only what but how to cook it.
It has tricks of the trade only a 5 star chef would know.

I highly recommend this DVD for first time cookers (myself) or experienced chefs.

8237919,5,B0010K67ME,"I purchased this as a gift for my wife and she loved it. As far as I know this is the only kosher DVD out there and the quality of the food and the entertainment value was both superb.

The DVD has all types of meals and many unique kosher dishes. This DVD is four hours long so there are tons of different recipes.

Highly recommended.",1197417600,2,336,4.075757575757576
