5942952,5,B00ET2ODYE,"Dennis (Paul Giamatti) and Rene (Paul Rudd) are small time guys with small dreams.  They travel from Quebec to New York to sell Christmas trees.  For Dennis this is a chance for personal redemption after his release from prison for burglary.  Rene just wants to earn enough money to buy his girlfriend Therese (Amy Landecker) an engagement ring.  Therese also happens to be Dennis' ex-wife so there is an obvious friction between the two business partners.  Along the way they meet a sundry  assortment of characters including a  Russian dental assistant, Olga (Sally Hawkins), who sympathizes with sad sack Dennis.  ""All Is Bright"" is at turns funny and poignant.  Giamatti plays Dennis with a degree of sullen pathos and Rudd's Rene is affable.  The chemistry between these two underrated veteran actors sparkles.  Director Phil Morrison establishes a melancholic mood which is punctuated by a terrific soft jazz score of holiday standards.  Some of the reviewers have said this isn't really a Christmas movie but that couldn't be further from the truth.  Hallmark doesn't have a trademark on seasonal fare.  This offbeat indie sleeper is filmmaking at its finest.",1387065600,7,1166,5.132978723404255
5942953,3,B00ET2ODYE,"Dennis (Paul Giamatti) has spent four years in prison. His divorced wife (Amy Landecker) wants nothing to do with him. She has told their daughter(Tatyana Richaud) he died from cancer. She plans on marrying Rene (Paul Rudd), Dennis' partner in crime who didn't get caught. With no money, home, or job, Dennis goes with Rene to sell Christmas trees in NYC, which is not a great idea for either man. Apparently this is something NYC generously allows Canadians to do without a permit, license, or sales tax ID number.

The film attempts to be quirky, except it does so in a sad pathetic way and not as a comedy or dark comedy. The jokes didn't make it, even when delivered by some of Hollywood's finest. I consider the film an early Christmas gift for writer Melissa James Gibson.

If I was going to miss one Paul Giamatti film, I would miss this over ""Lady in the Water.""

5942954,4,B00ET2ODYE,"I have to disagree with most of the reviews, it was bittersweet and heart warming. I really enjoyed it and it didn't have a Hollywood ending.

If you only like slick comedies, than this is not for you.",1385251200,9,201,4.2894736842105265
5942955,3,B00ET2ODYE,"""Season's Greetings from Canada."" After being released from prison Dennis (Giamatti) returns home to see his kid he is surprised when he finds out his wife told the daughter he was dead. Things get worse when he finds out his ex crime partner Rene (Rudd) is now dating his wife. Looking for work Dennis joins Rene on a trip to New York City to sell Christmas trees. The trip not only forces them to deal with the present circumstances but winds up affecting the lives of everyone involved. First of all even though this is about selling trees I would not call this a Christmas movie. Going into this I was excited because I love Paul Giamatti and think Paul Rudd is underrated. While the movie is good and the acting is great as expected it is very depressing. This is a movie that I can't really talk about what is going on too much because it will give something away but just know that you see the full arc of Dennis from happiness of being released to happiness with himself. If you are a Giamatti fan you will like this but don't expect a happy Christmas movie at all. Overall, great acting and worth seeing but don't be shocked if you are sad when its over. I give it a B.",1384560000,4,1178,4.3108108108108105

8609167,5,B00ET2ODYE,"I guess most people want Hallmark films for Christmas. This isn't one of them, though in many ways it could be.  The people are real, the story is real, the acting is superb, the music is great, and I find it as uplifting as any Hallmark film.  This seems a labor of love for both Giamatti and Rudd, and most viewers wouldn't recognize their characters from other roles they've played.  I thought their interplay was very complex and interesting. If you want to be surprised and challenged by a great, small story that offers compelling characters and a compelling storyline, and that offers in the end a very traditional narrative about Christmas, then give this a watch.",1450483200,,672,4.726495726495727

8609169,5,B00ET2ODYE,"This is my new all-time favorite holiday movie; in fact I've watched it about eight times since I bought the DVD and see something special I hadn't noticed before almost every time. The movie is about multiple, complex relationships. It's also (I think) about the main character (Dennis) working through the classical stages of grief (denial, anger, bargaining, and finally acceptance) over the loss of his family. Dennis may be an ex-con, but he's not mean or greedy; just trying to survive and go straight and find meaning in his life with few options available. The bleak winter settings remind me of the film ""Nebraska"" and offer a nice, sobering contrast to the usual holiday glitz. The background music is absolutely fantastic--a bright, jazzy take on traditional tunes that makes them all sound fresh. (Wish I could buy the soundtrack!)",1418860800,,843,5.0285714285714285

8609171,1,B00ET2ODYE,"Really thin plot.  Giamatti gets out of prison for theft after 4 years to find that his wife was planning to marry his friend and has told his daughter that he was dead of a very painful cancer.  His parole officer tells him there are no jobs around, but he cannot leave the area so with no job, no place to live - Have a nice Christmas.  His friend Paul Rudd, who is romancing his wife, is going to go to New York to sell Christmas tree  Giamatti forces him to take him with him.  They are going straight so Rudd smuggles him across the border from Canada.  I won't get into their dismal and dirty adventures, but it is a stupid storyline without much to offer as a finale.  Not very humorous at all.",1401580800,,701,4.148148148148148
8609172,5,B00ET2ODYE,"Much maligned film deserves more mature audience and a better evaluation.  Not a cookie cutter, simple minded trip through the Yuletide experience, a bit of cold reality, some unsavory characters attempt to get their act together by scoring big with Christmas tree sales in December.  A bit of their own medicine leaves them completely broke setting up the unusual ending as they try to at least make Christmas joy and magic for a sweet little child.

Paul Giamatti (Dennis) is one Bassett Hound faced, dissatisfied mutt throughout the entire story and Rudd (Rene) is not an ideal partner as he tries to steal Giamatti's character's family away.  One character, Olga, is likable and probably the only redeeming body in the whole story other than the little girl.  She helps Dennis make his first sale (to her) and then invites him in for food and a much needed bath.

This feature had one quality that I adore in movie making.  It is unique.  Not many, if any viewers will say that this one reminds them of any other film.  That's a virtue.  And it entertains from beginning to end.  Just don't go in thinking that this is your typical feel good Christmas story with a lollipop ending.  That's just not what this movie is.

The theme song ""JOY"" is ear candy..  It was written and performed by Tracey Thorn.  Very nice.  I always enjoy a beautiful musical score.",1391817600,,1361,4.679324894514768
