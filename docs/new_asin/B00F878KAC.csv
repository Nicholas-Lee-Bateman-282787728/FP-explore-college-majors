5969949,5,B00F878KAC,"There is little I can add to previous reviews other than this is one of the best, most beautiful, thought-provoking accounts of two people falling in love ever filmed. Erotic, sexually-charged without relying on gratuitous sex or nudity.  It is my favorite of Berger's films.  Well worth your time.",1390608000,12,298,5.061224489795919
5969950,5,B00F878KAC,"Part of the exceptional beauty of Marco Berger's Hawaii is its rhythm, the slow, deliberate, observant pace of its story.  But that  rhythm finds a counter rhythm in the frequent cuts from shot to shot.  Some linger, some come and go quickly.  Watching it, both in the experience of it at the moment and later in reflection, you become increasingly aware how much is being shown, how much you are witnessing.  The film is remarkable, among many other reasons, for the acuity of its eye, not only how much it sees, but how much detail is brought forth to ponder and feel.  Its clarity, in a profound sense, means something.

The setting evokes in its light something of a pastoral world.  Only the two main characters really matter.  It is like a world elsewhere, where the outside world need not intrude. What this isolation allows for is enormous concentration.

It is a two person film, with three other characters very briefly in it, only two of whom speak.  What the movie unfolds is the complexity of two men's falling in love.  But that complexity includes more than who they are.  It embraces the world in which they find themselves, the house, its pool, its lawns, trees, and flowers, the river near by.  It means that their pasts, who they once were together, also must be relived and revived.  As they work, together or separately, as they eat, as they talk, as they relax or compete or play, their feelings, their sensual responses to the world around them and to each other, are changing, intensifying.

When such emotions are being aroused, slowly, often quietly, unsurely, deeply, perhaps surprisingly, the whole world matters.  It becomes more present.  The ""island"" of a sort where they find themselves together becomes more and more part of who they are.  That, I suppose, is one of the meanings of lyricism in film.

Each shot in the movie has its own beauty.  Marco Berger is a film maker whose work is informed by a painterliness, not in the slightest bit arty or self-conscious, but clear, attentive, intense, where the whole composition enlightens the totality of its details.

Desire makes the whole world around you more keenly present.  So it is in this film.  The story of these two men's becoming lovers involves all that surrounds them as well, especially memory which, more than in Berger's earlier work, plays a vital part in this movie and, in one instance, gives it its title.  Memory, among other values, is here restorative.  It becomes, in many senses, the means to return, the way to spare love the failures of loss.

Sometimes, when a character is speaking, the movie goes silent.  You do not hear him.  Why that is so is as important as the dialogue you do hear.  How silence and words interplay in the film is nowhere more astonishing than in the significance of the word 'pineapple.'  Only a filmmaker of great sophistication and depth could have imagined this image and how it becomes so important to the movie, not only to its conclusion, but to the whole of it as you think back upon it or watch it again.  Both in words and in gestures much of the film resonates with what is not being said, in glances, in glimpses, in looking away, in looking back.

The actors are as fine as the film in which they appear.  This is a great work.  That it is also a great act of gay film making is not incidental.  I think this might be one of the finest films about two men's falling in love ever made.  But there is no need to categorize.  It is a work of art that resists categorization.  That is part of its brilliance as an astonishingly beautiful and perfectly crafted movie.

But it is also an unusually generous film, generous in its vision.  Its two men behave decently,  are good, and act to one another's benefit as much as or even more than for their own.  It is a film about gift-giving.  One character almost loses what he longs for, hopes for because he doesn't what to risk the other's happiness or future to get it.  The word 'good' can too easily collapse into moralism.  But the moral vision in this movie, its spirit of generosity, is at once both serious and elating.  This is an unusually fine movie, rare for its illuminations, its sensitivity to detail, its attention to the nuances of silence and gesture and to the richness of simple conversation, its sensual allure, and its ethical depth.  I felt, after watching it, elated.",1389830400,97,4381,4.6139896373057
5969951,5,B00F878KAC,"While looking for temporary summer work, Martin runs into a childhood friend, Eugenio, who hires him to do some odd jobs around his familys house.  Eugenio seems attracted to Martin from the start, but is very insecure that the feeling is mutual.  They relive many of their childhood adventures, which becomes a bit of a courtship ritual.  They are both rather uneasy about the direction their relationship seems to be going, with Martin the more reluctant to admit his feelings as they surface.

This is a very emotional and highly sexy film, focusing solely on these two characters and their growing feelings for each other.  It is certain to resonate with those who recall misgivings about their early attempts at cultivating a loving relationship, reconciling their sexuality, and fearing rejection from someone who has become an important part of their lives. There are no real secondary characters, and relatively little dialogue, with most of the communication of their feelings acted beautifully through their actions we see on screen.

The film was made in Argentina, and actually has nothing to do with Hawaii (except a reference that both of them considered it a bit of a nirvana when they were kids).  Recommended as a refreshingly simple film about the complex matter of love and sexuality, from a filmmaker, Marco Berger, who seems to have nailed down that concept several times.  In Spanish with English subtitles, and would be a light R rating for sexual situations and brief nudity.  I give it a full five stars out of five.",1386720000,44,1541,4.964980544747082
5969952,5,B00F878KAC,"I saw Hawaii couple of days ago and am still flying in a cloud of hapiness. The casual encounter of former infance friends Eugenio and Martn develops slowly but intensely to an attraction beyond friendship, however with almost childish innocence: tender, platonic and poetic like the summer days they enjoy in Eugenios countryside house. The story brought me back to my adolescence, to my first love which was an overwhelming feeling only expressed with innocent and furtive glances and gestures. Light years away from today's explicite and superficial communications. Thank you Marco Berger and team for this extraordinarily beautiful poem!",1384732800,37,641,5.42
5969953,5,B00F878KAC,"Hauntingly beautiful portrayal of love and longing.  Less IS more.  The long periods of silence and the long and lingering camera views communicate so much. The two characters in scenic settings makes a great home for this love story. And this film feels like falling in love in real time.

The silence and lingering views directly correlate to the character's apprehension and thoughts about how to move forward and whether or not to reveal their feelings.  The silence and lingering views also invite the viewer in.

Unlike an action-adventure Hollywood movie that keeps the viewer intentionally outside, Berger leaves time for his viewers to dive below the surface.  There is time to become part of Hawaii and to think about one's own reactions to what is going on in the film.

There is subtle tension through much of the film when the viewer wonders if either Martin or Eugenia are operating with less than honorable intentions.  There is subtle proof that Martin is happiest in water based on his smile while swimming in the pool or river.

Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the film is whether both characters are operating on 20 year old feelings from childhood attractions or whether the possibility of love is new. There is also each character's feelings developing on their own time table.  Eugenio seems ready for love when Martin is still questioning.  Then Martin provacatively exposes his body and Eugenio seemingly does not react. And when Martin kisses Eugenio and Eugenio pulls back and says NO...no...no.

Make sure to watch Barber's Plan B & Absent.",1383696000,42,1573,4.961832061068702

5969976,5,B00F878KAC,"What an absolutely glorious film.  Watching these two former childhood friends become reacquainted, one wealthy, the other indigent, is tedious because we know they deserve love and affection and----each other.  But, my god, are they opposed to letting it happen until the younger lad, after an eager kiss, pushed away, flees, we watch the older coming to terms with his regret and foolish behavior. But he finds the means for repair with the ViewMaster slide of the Hawaiian pineapples and leaves it on the branch by the younger's former outdoor hideaway.  The reunion is lovely and all too brief, but we know they are lovers for life now.  Beautiful performances and sensual in quiet ways that merely suggest repressed feelings.

5969980,3,B00F878KAC,"Very watchable men in a painfully slow moving dance of mutual attraction. My problem: the extreme hesitancy between them for the duration of the movie was not convincing. At first I thought the older gay man was just coming out and having great difficulty coming to terms with it. In fact, according to his brother, he had already been sexually active. The younger boy with those large liquid eyes and appealing glances (and the occasional dropping of his pants) was asking to be asked. So what was the older guy holding out for? A reach of the hand, a simple question would have settled the matter.
I believe the film maker was determined to avoid the usual tiresome jumping into bed scenario, but he went way too far in the other direction. The movie was beautiful but finally not convincing.",1473638400,3,794,4.678571428571429
5969981,5,B00F878KAC,"Very poignant movie about two men falling in love without either of them knowing it.  There is full frontal nudity but it is not gratuitous.  It was done in a very tasteful manner and only when the scene called for it.  Sometimes, you can tell that Eugenio is creeping on Martin just a bit, like setting it up so he can see Martin naked or what not, but he only comes close to really creeping on the ""straight"" guy once when they are drunk, but nothing actually happens then.  Anyway, I do not want to give spoilers away so I will not say anything more about the plot, but I was a little apprehensive about renting this movie, but I am glad I did.  It definitely fed the sappy romantic in me.",1472860800,,692,4.212121212121212

5969999,5,B00F878KAC,"Hawaii is certainly one of the best gay themed films in quite some time. Most films about gay men are either terribly preachy stories, cautionary tales, or loud and proud empowerment films that often times come off as trite. These films in my opinion tend to reinfornce rather than break gay stereotypes. Hawai by director Marco Berger offers a different look in his slice of life film ""Hawaii"".

Hawaii tales the slow building relationship between educated Eugenio and the somewhat lost Martin. One summer Martin has come to his rural hometown in Aregntina hoping to find his aunt and a place to stay while waiting on ajob in the city. Disappointed to learn she has moved and he is basically homeless he ask about town for work doing odd jobs. His job seeking takes him the home of Eugenio who is instantly attracted to Martin and heistantly offers him some work.

 Their relationship, like the film itself, builds slowly. Eugenio wants to known Martin better but tries not to come off as forward or let his know young worker know he is gay. Eugenio enjoys his time with Martin but does not want to scare him off and discreetly sneeks peaks at Martin's body - the taboo you can look but don't touch. The bromance that developes allow Eugenio to swim, talk, and interact with Martin on a level that he feels may not be possible should Martin know that he is gay.

As the film continues we see their friends ship deepen and expand. Each character with their feelings and reservations. This film avoids the cliche of pointless sex scenes, offering just enough intimacy and intimate looks at the characters (both figuratively and literally) as to peak interest with spoiling the mystery. Tense scenes are here. In one scene Martin has cut himself on his upper thigh prompting Eugenio to Clean the wound. In the scene Martin is standing clad in his underwear, jeans pulled down while Eugenio dresses the wound. Ithe scene is framed perfectly - Martin's most intimate area boldly exposed and yet ignored by Eugenio as he tends to his friend's cut. The film continues in much the same way and does reaches a satisfying ending and one that I felt was natural.

This film spoke to me as Incould relate to my own relation ships growing up and the mixed signals and rservations that sometimes crept up. A gorgeous film.",1458604800,3,2309,4.691358024691358

It's a very erotic film without explicitness, and thus very romantic as well. I think that gay men, certainly, will identify with the behavior of both character's believably portrayed struggle and caution, but I think the experience of tentative love is universal. The dialogue is sparse, but exactly enough. The direction and cinematography was artful but felt natural and unselfconscious. It's frustrating to watch the two men push and pull and try to figure out what the other wants, and heartbreaking sometimes, but the happy ending is well earned. The director filled this languid two-character film with tension and humanity. As for the odd title, it refers to pictures they shared on an old Viewmaster 3D viewer, and it serves as a metaphor for what brings them together. An altogether very satisfying and well made film about gay desire, fear, and love.",1443398400,8,993,4.9879518072289155

5970007,1,B00F878KAC,"It's not the worst film I've ever seen, but it is definitely among the bottom of the barrel. I kept waiting for something to HAPPEN. I wasn't expecting a ton of intimacy or sex but *one scene* would have been good.... What could have been a great love story between the two guys ended up being 90 minutes of backwoods footage of virtually nothing at all. After reading the other reviews, I was expecting that this would be one of my favorite gay films. It's probably my least favorite as of right now.

Some people have commented on some kind of deeper meaning in this film, and about the churning hormones of Martin and Eugenio and think it is a work of genius. When all is said and done, there isn't much of either. But, the slow-moving stuff should only go on for maybe 30 minutes, tops. Marco Berger has us sit through a fricking hour and a half of it and ultimately, *nothing* comes of it. What happens to the two characters? Nothing! It all comes off as if their whole time together wasn't really all that important to begin with. If you write a screenplay, or you direct one, the golden rule is that you constantly have to believe that the characters in your story are the most important people who ever lived (in film school, this is one of the first things you learn.) And, you have to make sure your audience believes it too. It all just felt like one big cop-out.

And to add insult to injury - this film should have been called ""Brazil"" or ""Costa Rica"" because that's what it looked like! There was nothing to suggest that this film was a story set in Hawaii, except the title. Oh, and the pineapple. Can't forget that.

I agree with a couple other reviews that discuss certain points in the plot where the viewer is taken out of the movie entirely, like when they talk about killing a cat together (and laugh about it!)

When I hit the last 20 minutes of the film, I was thinking, ""Something good had better happen really fast or I'm going to walk away thinking this was total crap."" The final scenes of Eugenio and the old-fashioned Viewmaster were cool...I had one of those, and tons of those picture discs, when I was a kid. But sheesh....it shouldn't be the way the film concludes!  It would've made for a nice B-story to the film, if it had been utilized in a more interesting way.

On a more positive note...I think the guy who plays Martin is gorgeous. The guy who plays Eugenio, not so much. They aren't great actors though, and that's yet another problem. If they had been, perhaps the film would have been better. One star. I'm disappointed. I really wish I could have liked this one.  Maybe sometime I'll give it another try but I don't see my opinion changing.  There's way too little action.",1436745600,4,2717,4.42

5970009,4,B00F878KAC,"""Hawaii"" is a film that demonstrates the power of the Internet and social media in its very genesis.  Argentine auteur Marco Berger successfully raised the monies for this movie through a Kickstarter campaign, and those who contributed financially certainly received value for their money.  It is a pastoral sojourn centred around a house in a small town in the Argentine countryside.  The residence with its pool and the lush green lands' surrounding it create an enclosed little world, an island in which two men interact and come to know each other.

From the very first meeting of Eugenio, the intellectual who lives on the property, and Martin, the wayfarer who seeks employment, the chemistry between them is obvious.  It is emphasized by the fact that they discover that they knew each other as boys and were playmates. Director Berger allows the relationship between the two to build slowly at a pace that is nearly glacial, more European in style than North American.  There are periods of silence where the camera slowly reveals the characters expressions and the scenery around them.

Guileless, ever-so-appealing Martin shows all of his emotions in his face, and at times, with his body language.  Much of the time you know just what he is thinking before he says anything.  What he does conceal is revealed through his expressions as being troubling to him.  Eugenio displays not just an attraction to Martin, but a caring for his welfare, as well, that reveals a sweet side to his nature.  One nice thing that is a pleasant contrast to so many movies with gay characters is that it is shown by a visit by kin and by remembrances from the past that Eugenio comes from a happy, loving family.

In a dreamy, languid manner, director Berger, and actors Mateo Chiarino as Martin and Manuel Vignau as Eugenio, allow the story to evolve and for the men to show their growing affection for each other by glances, and by what they don't say as much as they do say. The things they do make sense and are not forced, and the viewer comes to like them and have a desire as to how he wants this tale to progress.  It is refreshing to watch a film that features two good, decent human beings.

This is not a fast-paced film with either metaphorical or literal fireworks: It unfolds deliberately and quietly.  It is a movie to watch in the evening with a glass of Argentine Malbec or Merlot when you are in a pensive mood and would like to see something soothing.  The two actors and the lovely Argentine scenery deliver that.  I do know that if Marco Berger ever turns to Kickstarter again to fund a project, I will definitely donate to him.

The movie on DVD is in Spanish with the option offered of English subtitles.

In addition to this film, the DVD, also, has trailers for the movies: ""Cal,"" ""I'm A Porn Star,"" ""Last Match,"" ""Matterhorn"" and ""Truth.""

This film is on my ""Great & Good Gay Movies For The 2010's"" Amazon Listmania List.

5970012,3,B00F878KAC,"Berger has found his niche, his signature focus, his methodology, and with Hawaii he further hones it. His chaste and subtle films seem determined to demonstrate the cultural clich of the promiscuous, courtship-challenged male homosexual to be a myth. He is to be commended for that aspiration, but while I found Plan B to be a riveting if maddening journey to intimacy through fear, the whole delayed love-declaration thing again emploted (a rather ambitious way of putting it) in Hawaii failed to sustain my interest for the duration. Berger's latest is a short-story turned into a novel and evinces the padding-out such augmentation necessitates. Everything plays out--by way of intimation, anticipation, and half-gestures--in the fore-court of actual intimacy, conflict, and drama. The long-delayed pay-off--a few chaste kisses on chin stubble--is too paltry to relieve the burden of expectation.

Besides the incomprehensibility of the whole view-finder thing, and the even less comprehensible reaction of Vignau's character (SPOILERS ALERT!) to his childhood friend's (Matteo Chiarino) unanticiipated (?) affection, I found the conspiratorially tight-framing of events, the over-use of music (especially during the first half-hour, where it seemed unduly manipulative and somewhat of a cheat), and the complete want of charisma on the part of Chiarino, deeply frustrating. The latter is a blank page; the location in any frame where attention goes to die. Vignau, on the other hand, has a kind of magical presence. It never hurts to be attractive, though proportions and symmetry can't explain why some actors are so adept at broadcasting feeling states. He's the only reason to sit through this.

Perhaps in his next film Berger will start with the sexual encounter of two men who hook up at a urinal and only then proceed to fall in love. In such a scenario, he would not be able to coyly over-rely on--horrors of heaven!--the tentative promise of tenderness between men as if that were the final revelation of truth and beauty.",1424476800,2,2036,5.30030959752322

Marco Berger has done a brilliant job, both in directing the film and in selecting the two primary characters, played by Manuel  Vignau (as Eugenio) and Mateo Chiarino (as Martin).  There is little dialogue or true action, but both Eugenio and Martin convey the story clearly through the sparse dialogue and their personal expressions.  I was particularly drawn to Mateo's portrayal as Martin.  Mateo's facial expressions are both clearly understandable and moving, his eyes sometimes penetrating and serious and other times sparkling with love and emotion, and when he smiles it could melt the coldest heart.

5970018,4,B00F878KAC,"If you're familiar with Marco Berger movies, you may recognize some of his work's traits in Hawaii. There is novelty, however, as the lead characters interact in what seems to be a more realistic, tense manner (if you compare, for instance, ""Plan B""). From the beginning of the movie, you start to take pity in Martn's (Mateo Chiarino) predicament, looking for temporary jobs to (barely) sustain himself during the hot (and wet) summer in the Argentinian countryside. And it is rather obvious that gay writer Eugenio (Manuel Vignau) takes an interest in Martn as he offers his repairman/pool boy services. The two begin a slow, but inexorable, gravitation towards each other, while not daring to make a move or speak their feelings openly, which keeps the audience tense and attentive, only waiting (and wishing) for it to happen. The gentle ""boundary pushings"" made by each in turn is gracefully counteracted by the other, and the way the plot is developed in its slow-paced simplicity shows just how awkward it can be, at times, to try and approach someone in a genuine, loving manner.",1419206400,2,1087,4.945355191256831

5970021,4,B00F878KAC,"Okay, I'm going to start off with what this ISN'T. It is NOT a film about hard-bodied, generic-handsome guys ""going at it"" with no provocation other than being in the same room with each other. It's not fast-paced. Not a lot actually HAPPENS. It does not rely on lots of dialogue. What it IS is a ""slow burn"" film-watching experience. Each of the actors is charismatic is a very real, down-to-earth way. They are able to convey SO MUCH internal questioning, longing and affection with just a sideways glance or a clench of the jaw. Really. It's astounding. HAWAII is a very SENSUAL film, but, not a sex-filled one. It IS slow-paced. A few times, I lost patience with the length of time spent showing ach character alone and sad about having missed an opportunity. HOWEVER, that's a minor quibble. The scenery is beautiful but low-key. The score is LOVELY. The kind that only seems to come out of Europe or Japan these days. It combines with natural, ambient sounds of the woods around the house where the story is set. I believe the obstacles, both real and imagined, faced by each of the men will make sense and resonate with anyone who has ever fallen in love with someone after a difficult, awkward start- and with anyone who has done so BEFORE jumping into bed with that person. :)  Afterwards, I felt it was a sort of ""impressionist"" movie-watching experience and I can't think of another film to compare it to.",1418169600,,1416,4.619047619047619

If you want to see a film with two adults (yes two males) fall for each other in a cute, sincere and honest way then you'll enjoy this movie.

Again this is a movie about two men falling in love with each other, so you need to have an open mind when watching this. I personally think it shouldn't be a problem for most people in 2014, but don't give a bad review because of that otherwise its your fault for not reading the reviews.

P.S. i discussed it with a friend and i want to also point out that the two males are not ripped with abs or any other crap, but yet they are both very good looking men (it seems South America has a better view on whats attractive).",1417651200,6,953,4.191256830601093
5970024,5,B00F878KAC,"Hawaii is a gay movie only in the sense that Citizen Kane is a film about building a house.

Writer and director Marco Berger explores the universal themes of lost opportunities, lingering jealousies, and mutual interpersonal dependencies. The film starts with an out-of-content flashback and then moves very slowly (Eat the damn piece of fruit already!).

When Martin (Mateo Chiarino) comes knocking at the yard gate of his boyhood friend Eugenio (Manuel Vignau) looking for summer employment the pace picks up. The old patterns of their boyhood relationship are quickly reestablished. Eugenio was the rich kid, with a big house and a swimming pool. Martin was the poor kid from down the street who grew up wearing Eugenios discarded clothing. Eugenio seems to be the sexual predator and the dominant of the pair. At the end, however, ask yourself who most got exactly what he wanted.

Both actors are masterful at using their eyes to move the story along. Chiarinos eye movements are mesmerizing. Vignau, working from behind a pair of glasses, uses his eyes to reveal both his characters motivation and Eugenios need to win when they replay games from their childhood. One scene in particular is worthy of the great Fred Sanford (Red Foxx). If you are old enough to remember Sanford and Son, the scene will make you smile.

Mateo Chiarino is from Uruguay (as is his character). I apologize for not realizing that Uruguay is producing such fine actors and not knowing more about Uruguay in general. Situated between Argentina to the south and Brazil to the north, Uruguay is considered to be the most stable democracy in South America.

The film is in Spanish with English subtitles and takes place in Argentina. The Spanish is not the Mexican/Latin American dialect we more familiar with in the U.S., so don't feel bad if your high school Spanish fails you at times.

My only disappointment was the dialog in the scene that justifies the name of the film. I found it mostly inaudible and its without subtitles. While other reviewers on this site caught the meaning of Hawaii immediately, I missed it and consequently had to struggle with the motivation underlying the last few scenes.

Berger and his actors have done a masterful job! This is not the Adventures of Tom Sawyer, its the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.",1417392000,3,2318,4.913043478260869

It's a nice slow burning  (but never dull) story of two men who meet and suddenly realise they were friends in their youth.  For the duration of the film it isn't clear if either is gay, but you do suspect.  Even if one turns out to be gay, will the feelings be reciprocated?  It's a nice ride to find out!  Much anticipation and patience pays off.  How?  I can't reveal how, but it isn't until the end of the film that a real payoff is presented, which makes it all that much sweeter.

It's nice to have a film with very little dialogue needed.  Nothing is blatant or obvious.  The characters are very likable.  Sex isn't the object of the film, it isn't needed either.  The amount of sexual tension is still very high.  High enough to satisfy!

The story reminded me of how much true life is.  The manner in which we question whether or not we're correctly interpreting signals.  The movie contains it's fair share of suspense, too.  The final climactic scenes revealing the importance of the title of the film.  A very sweet title, too.",1410912000,3,1112,4.47
5970032,4,B00F878KAC,"Im giving this film 4 stars, but I realize that it is not a film for everyone.  It moves  very, very slowly.  The plot is minimal, as we watch two men, once childhood acquaintances, getting to know one another again.  There are long stretches with minimal  or sometimes no  dialogue.  The two men share a hot Argentinean summer, with one of them sometimes working on his novel as the other does repairs around the country house and its rambling rural property, and occasionally cooling off in the swimming pool or in the nearby river.  There are plenty of scenes of these two (not unattractive) shirtless, sweaty men as they each seem to try to come to grips with a growing degree of unacknowledged sexual tension.  Both the men and the lush scenery are visually appealing throughout.  The tension slowly builds to its climactic point, and -- to the directors credit -- the resolution of the will they or won't they question does not get instantly resolved with a simple foregone conclusion, giving the viewer ones own sense of this tension.
If you are in need of an action-packed plot or of torrid sex scenes, then this is not the film for you. But if you have the patience to watch this slow redevelopment of a relationship, you will be sweetly rewarded.",1410739200,,1256,4.642533936651584

The two leads (all other roles being well-placed but sleight) are played with believable restraint. The acting makes the just believable premise quite plausible.
Many scenes, particularly in the first section, are in the manner of Chaplin's early talkies: A lush score, composed for the film, accompanies scenes of one of the main actors making his way alone. We then see the other main character, seemingly a more content human being, alone and wistful. When the two meet (or reunite, it being what may or may not be a chance encounter one of them has been seeking with his long-lost childhood friend) the music recedes until dialog and the sound of rustling grass and birds chirping comes to the fore.

But, in my opinion there's no story here, rather a string of scenes supposedly depicting a burgeoning sexual/romantic interest developing between two men.  Yet, strangely, the two never seem ready to recognize this growing attraction at the same moment, so the connection between them often feels unearned, not real.  When the older man is sending signals of attraction, the younger one is seemingly oblivious to his intents...and vice versa (in fact, the first overt advance is inexplicably rebuffed).  As a result, no true heat builds between the two.  The whole affair feels chaste, and the ending tepid.  On top of that, there is zero character development.  The younger man just comes off as slightly dimwitted. Worse, the older man comes off as slightly creepy, as he devises (sometimes in an adolescent manner) coy ways to try to get a peek at the other guy undressed.  There's also the mention of a cat being stoned which is jarring, considering the overall tender, gentle mood that the movie seems to be trying to achieve.  I really liked the filmmaker's previous movie ""Plan B"", which is also slowly paced, but in which much more happens in the way of plot and character development...and which does realize a satisfying payoff at the end.

From the opening chord, lushly romantic orchestral colors complement the idyllic, verdant space these characters inhabit. Slowly, gently, the score expresses a prolonged sense of longing in the Wagnerian manner of Tristan and Isolde. Its a beautiful fantasy, a metaphorical island of friendship and nascent love.

My subject matter, hence model, hence muse, has from time to time become a friend or a lover and usually builds itself slowly as in the relationship of these two childhood friends.

5970055,5,B00F878KAC,"Director Marco Berger has already proven he can make great cinema with `Plan B' and `Absent', so I was expecting great things from this. Initially I was a tad disappointed as the first fifteen minutes of `scene setting' don't seem to go very far. Then it all changes and I was drawn in hook line and sinker.

It is about Martin who is down on his luck and has returned to the area where he grew up but is surviving by doing odd jobs for a few pesos and food. He asks at the house of Eugenio, who is house sitting for his Aunt and Uncle, if there is any work and Eugenio tells him to come back tomorrow and he will see what he can do. What starts out as a handyman, soon turns into a passion of unrequited love that sees both men going on a journey of discovery.

This film has a smouldering quality that makes you want something to happen to break the tension - a mood very reminiscent of `Absent'. Most of the action is concerned with the two male leads and yet it does not feel stifled for it - quite the opposite.

5970058,5,B00F878KAC,"...the scene where Eugenio's friend comes to visit and they 'dish' a little. In my opinion, that scene should/could have been left on the editing floor.  After all this extraordinary set-up and pacing--kudos to the director--this scene was like a clump of wet manure in an otherwise pristine meadow. Why? It is not needed. The detail in showing us all we need to know is quite technical and beautiful and the actor's art of letting us see their thoughts is quite skillful.  You will remember Manuel Vignau from the movie, Plan B. He is an accomplished actor and skillfully threads his way through what could be very treacherous and unknown waters. After all, these two guys haven not seen each other for years...and you know what, I get why that scene I find unnecessary, is in the movie.  We see Eugenio's longing, but not his lust and all his previous conquests. Perhaps, the story teller wants us to know that for Eugenio, this thing with Martin is different from his past and the visiting friend is needed to let us in on Eugenio's usual M.O. Great flick!",1403740800,,1059,4.652406417112299

Martin, left homeless after his grandmother's death, travels to his childhood village in rural Venezuela and attempts to find work.

He is hired by Eugenio to perform repairs on his uncle's house. The young men soon discover that they were childhood friends, and their renewed friendship grows. Each in his own way fears rejection. Martin doesn't know that Eugenio may have a secret and that his kindness may have ulterior motives.

The acting is done very well and there's a gentle & pastoral natural beauty to the film that is rather captivating. That being said, the number one criticism of other reviewers (even ones that gave it high ratings) is that the film is slow, very slow, and I couldn't agree more. In fact, I found that the tempo of the movie, apparently done on purpose to add a sense of escalating tension, so belabors the point that it shot itself in the foot and began feeling artificial. On top of this, we neither get much depth regarding the main characters nor do we see much in the way of character development. This isn't necessarily bad in some movies that have a singular point (action or horror movies perhaps), but here I found myself wishing for more knowledge & and intimacy with the leads, but the plot revealed next to nothing.

The story was curious because it was difficult to guess who was seducing who, after you figure out this is what really was happening, or was it? I kept thinking that it was, then that it was not. There was the feeling that the answer would be in the next scene. It was one long seduction film that held together.

Also, I realized that upon the second viewing that there are no long shots in the film... you never get a good look at the house, just the rooms. I think this makes the film seem much more intimate. I loved the two main characters, they are both gentle, kind, introspective men. Their interactions are sometimes awkward but always with a smoldering fire beneath. Manuel Vignau and Mateo Chiarino were wonderful in their roles.

I can't imagine anyone being put off by what is on the screen.  It is a love story told in an emotional buildup between two men.  This is a movie which makes you realize what film making is all about.  I have watched it several times and still see different things, different emotions between the main characters.  Marco Berger is amazing.  I did some research and it was made on a credit card budget.  Instead of money (digital Superman shots) Mr. Berger used talent and sensitivity and two  excellent actors.

Martin is a so innocent in character, so he let's think. and ""E"" shows a great restrain when he sees Martin looking at him like bottle of ""Coke"". Which they seem to like to drink a lot. I do hope there is chance to have these two back on the screen. Once again, the only thing I wasn't sure about was the title.

5970110,4,B00F878KAC,"Argentine writer/director Marco Berger always creates works of art and Hawaii is no exception. From the overwhelming musical overture to the subtleties of nature and human expression without words, this film hits perfect notes.

Two men have lost their homes but fate brings them together to relive their childhood friendship and re-surfaces feelings each had long ago forgotten despite their totally opposite economic positions in life.

I felt Eugenios (Manuel Vignau who played Bruno in Plan B) inner turmoil, disguised beneath his long, blank stares as he went inside his head instead of sharing, even when Martin (Mateo Chiarino) made the first move. The uncertainty of young love for any couple will raise questions such as Does (s)he feel the same way about me? and Am I about to be rejected? Hopefully, we eventually learn that the best course of action is to reveal our feelings or we needlessly suffer endlessly the what could have been regret for years or even decades.

Can Hawaii be used as the ground upon which we can walk out of our fear and into love? Take the risk.",1393632000,5,1083,4.875
5970111,4,B00F878KAC,"An unusual film like this with its sporadic dialogue and long stretches of quietude demands great skill and agility of its score and unfortunately the score could not deliver. I recommend watching it as a silent film (there are English subs anyway), possibly playing The Durutti Column's Another Setting in the background on repeat, starting the album when we get the first shot of Eugenio. Any sensitive, lush and fairly mellow music is better (and somehow more appropriate) than the score, which I'm guessing was, as is too often the case, the first thing to get gutted when they cut the budget down to make the movie with their kickstarter funds.

If this film was released without any sound at all, it would have gotten an easy and quick five stars. The visuals are beautiful and tender and the performances are very solid and generally quite subtle and multidimensional. The heavy-handedness of the score overcodes the experience, squeezing out all the ambiguity and making the performances feel much less skillful and open than they are.

But as for the visual world, performances and story, this is really a very special film and definitely worth seeing.",1393459200,,1161,4.948717948717949

5970115,4,B00F878KAC,"Marco Berger's Spanish language Hawaii is small with a simple story made into something more than the narrative. Boy meets boy, boy becomes attracted to boy but doesn't know what to do about it, there's a history; what's going to happen? Berger uses long scenes of pause on scenery, character's processing, and body framing that evokes erotic tension, to evolve the story into an unfolding emotional journey. He's talented at using all the elements of film; character posturing, shot framing, scenery, music and dialogue to that result. The sparse dialogue incites and exhibits complication in human behavior rather than define everything. (Except a clumsy scene between Eugenio and a visiting relative where the dialogue makes perfectly clear the situation.) I read that disparity in character vocabulary is used to manifest class difference, which was lost in translation on me (subtitles ;-). Class or status is a component of the character's stories but I missed it as a struggle between them aside from Martin's shame of his situation. Intentional or not, Berger's themes are fodder for porn fantasy. However, he engages them as real world, contemplative journeys of discovery, though certainly sexually charged. Berger's use of eroticism is a bit obvious in this. Perhaps because I've seen his moves before, they stand out as a bit contrived. Berger might just be f****ng with you in using setups he's probably seen in porn and turning them into something else, there's no sex; he's a tease.
I didn't get a powerful sense of chemistry between the leads. The guys are handsome real world types. Manuel Vignau gives Eugenio purpose and inner workings that make the character interesting. He projects charm and warmth. Mateo Chiarino's charming too. His angelic good looks and almost wide eyed innocence are engaging. He's good as the down on his luck Martin but he doesn't match Vignau's abilities so he's out classed in many scenes. Maybe intentional, but it made question any attraction beyond the physical.
I suspect Marco Berger will be doing ""bigger"" things soon. I applaud him telling these small stories that he wants to tell. If you haven't seen his other films, you should. For me he's played out this toy box. But that said, I hope that he continues using his beautiful voice to tell stories of this genre.",1393286400,2,2320,5.044270833333333
5970116,5,B00F878KAC,"The many quiet moments weave you in so closely with the characters. You're quickly one or the other, sometimes both, as their feelings unfold and you see the way they are slowly peeling back their true feelings for one another. Not a sappy movie at all, a complete joy to be in the presence of these characters.",1393200000,3,311,4.473684210526316
5970117,5,B00F878KAC,"This movie crept up on me and ended up making me love it. Very quiet story of two people, for whatever reason life dealt, making a connection.",1393113600,,142,4.296296296296297
5970118,3,B00F878KAC,"Be aware that it is in spanish with captions and slow, for some people, I imagine, even unbearably slow.

The movie is romantic, two guys next door type (kind of), not the usual hunk types, acting good.
The story is about the fact that sometimes we deny ourselves our strongest desires and feelings.
True, but why? Billion dollar question, this movie tries to show the complexity of this subject but still... we are without an answer.",1393027200,4,434,4.7105263157894735
5970119,5,B00F878KAC,"A very quiet movie that requires some patience.  Beautiful to look at, and a reminder that not all movies need to be at full throttle. Settle in and take the time to experience what film can actually be.",1393027200,2,203,4.342105263157895
5970120,5,B00F878KAC,This film starts off very slow...but it's well worth it in the end....I am glad I watched it and sure others will enjoy it too.,1393027200,,127,4.12
5970121,5,B00F878KAC,"This film was gorgeous.  I found myself totally entranced by Berger's languid story of two handsome, but lonely young men, who were friends as children, finding each other anew and falling slowly in love over the course of a quiet summer at a secluded estate.  This film probably won't appeal to the 'short attention span' mob as it's pace is slow and lilting like the flow of a deep, winding stream.  And, our heroes, Eugenio and Martin are the focus of the story with only a few tangential characters making brief appearances.  But, this sharp focus and gliding pace are never boring, I even found myself wishing the film wouldn't end.  If you have the ability to detach, observe and absorb a lovely romance story, this film is for you.",1393027200,5,738,4.6461538461538465
5970122,5,B00F878KAC,My only wish is that it could have shown more of Argentina's countryside. This was a very well done love story with a wonderful ending.,1393027200,,135,4.44
5970123,5,B00F878KAC,"I loved this film.  Two quiet, handsome, masculine men--childhood friends from 15 or 20 years ago who have gone their separate ways since then--find themselves living together one summer in a country house in northern Argentina.  One man works as a handyman for the other.  The attraction is immediate but unspoken and unacknowledged.  Through ponderous scene after scene, we see the dance play out, expecting to see it bear fruit but not sure that it will.  The characters are riveting to watch, for us and for them.  This film requires patience but it's well worth the time.",1392940800,7,576,4.88659793814433

5970125,4,B00F878KAC,"Love quiet films--- no need for all that auditory clutter commonly found in motions pictures. It's not a perfect film, but it's very pleasant to watch. I would have liked to see better expression of the mental and intellectual connection between the two main characters. Other than that, if you like slow/lazy films, like I do, then this one is a treat.",1392854400,,353,4.709677419354839

5970127,5,B00F878KAC,"If you're interested in this film, I bet you've seen many of the duds that American gay filmmakers churn out.  You know the ones: clich coming out stories, drug addicted gay men selling their bodies, over the top queens who exist for their accessories or perhaps the worst, the preachy ""social message"" gay film that forgets what filmmaking is.  So maybe you've given up on ""gay"" films...I was almost there.  Then I discovered this film.  There was something in the description that made me want to risk two hours with the film, something that seemed to set it apart from the others.  And I'm certainly thrilled that I did.  The casting is superb.  They've chosen beautiful men who would never fit into a gay male underwear commercial; in other words, they've chosen men who can act.  The story is anything from complex.  It unfolds slowly, the tension building as the viewer gets glimpses of the passion underneath the surface.  The dialogue is sparse; the photography is rich.  There's nothing preachy here.  The films shows you; it never tells you.  It leaves you wanting more yet somehow fulfilled.  Take a chance on this one if you've given up hope on gay cinema!",1392854400,7,1168,4.746268656716418
5970128,2,B00F878KAC,It is possible that I missed something while checking the time remaining on Hawaii. Then again it could have been the ten minute nap.  Prepare for extended periods of silence and painfully exaggerated facial expressions.  Add an extra shot to that latte and endure.  Do yourself a favor and watch Plan B again.,1392768000,5,310,4.811320754716981
5970129,5,B00F878KAC,"This was a stunning movie. Only heard of it here on Amazon, and after reading the reviews decided to risk buying it. Deserves much wider viewing and popularity.

As the viewer you are given time to feel what they must be feeling, each struggling with their own emotions. The two main characters are very good looking, and there is no shortage of shirtless man views.
WIthout giving anything away, I had to smile when the viewmaster showed up, hinting back to the movie Plan B.
Loved this movie and very glad I purchased it.
I recommend this movie.",1391385600,9,559,4.283018867924528
5970133,5,B00F878KAC,"I'm sure there will be a lot of people who will think this film is boring and overly long and drawn-out.  It is this very skill of Marco Berger (Plan B, Absent) that allows the viewer inside the minds of the characters in what seems to be almost 'real time'. Words are often superfluous and Berger uses them sparsely, relying on the emotions of the actors, atmosphere and beautiful cinematography to tell the story. The silences are almost organic. Give me this sort of production any day as it delivers real depth and the sort of gratification that 'wham-bam' film-making can't even come close to.  It is meditative, gripping, involving and ultimately deeply satisfying.",1391126400,9,671,4.87719298245614
