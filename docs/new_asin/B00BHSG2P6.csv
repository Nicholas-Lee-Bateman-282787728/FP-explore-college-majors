5621867,5,B00BHSG2P6,"Great fun dance workout. It's almost like hip hop dance but indian style. Fun workout. I actually did sweat a little to this dance routine. Definitely would recommend it to couch potatoes or people who get tired of regular cardio, weight lifting or other routine workouts. It's a good way to customize workouts rather than the usual every time.",1390176000,2,344,4.8474576271186445

8568698,3,B00BHSG2P6,"it's actually a really fun, full cardio workout.  the dance moves are easy to follow and it feels like dancing, and you will sweat.  however, it suffers from the same fault as most cardio dance dvds.  it spends too much time breaking down the routine.  this is fine for the first 2 viewings and then immediately gets old.  I thought they would put all the routines together at the end for once big dance through.  they did not.  I can't see myself going slowly over the moves again and again and again.  I hate when workouts do this.  don't they realize users want a routine they can just dance to?  gilad is still proving to be the best cardio video I've found.  which is too bad because I would like some variety.  the best ever cardio workout is an old weight watchers tape with aileen Sharon.  she breaks down the moves into small segments and then you put the whole routine together at the end and dance through it 4 times.  too bad it's not on dvd.  too bad this workout didn't think to do the same.  there are some really cool moves here.",1476662400,4,1045,4.309278350515464
8568699,5,B00BHSG2P6,"I've had this video for nearly 6 months now, but kept putting off reviewing it because I couldn't decide what level of workout to describe it as.  It feels like the low end of moderate, but as I would do the workout, I would think about the types of movements and number of repetitions I was doing, and, as they seemed to compare favorably to workouts that felt more intense, I suspected what I was actually doing was a solid moderate level workout which felt easy because it was fun, because the movements were varied, and because it starts off so slow and easy, that by the time you're really getting a workout, you don't even notice since you were eased into it.
However, despite my suspicions that it really was a good workout, I just wasn't sure, so I would just use it for just about one workout a week, when I just didn't have the motivation to do a ""real"" workout. Un/fortunately, the past few weeks, I've just felt so worn out, that I spent two weeks unable to motivate myself to do anything more than this workout! Which is really not good, but it had an interesting result. When I went back to my favorite ""real"" workout, it seemed easier than I remembered. There was even a point in the workout (Spiderman push-ups to plank to mountain climbers) where, in the past, I had to go to downward dog for a few seconds to make it through the second set.  Following my two weeks of Doonya, I thought I would have to push harder that usual to make it through my normal workout - instead it was easier!  Always the skeptic, I figured maybe my body was just rested and ready for the harder workout after two weeks of a lighter workout. So I decided to test it a bit. I did a few more days of Doonya, then did what I considered a solid middle of the line moderate workout.  It was easy!  I didn't even break a sweat - and I ALWAYS sweat when I work out...a lot...it's gross. :-p Then the next day, I did my favorite ""real"" workout again.  Again, it was easier than I remembered: I was able to push a bit more weight, move a little faster, and had a slightly greater range of motion, and again, I didn't have to take a downward dog break during the hardest set!  Not only did this Doonya workout maintain my fitness level, it may have actually improved it. That's pretty fantastic for my 'I only have enough motivation to do an easy workout' workout! :-)
So clearly I'm a big fan of this workout. I give it 4.5 stars; and since I can't do that, it made more sense to round up. Most of all, I'm pretty excited I get to add this in to my workout rotation as a solid workout, rather than relegate it to my 'once a week because I'm to tired to do a real workout' workout.",1470441600,3,2666,4.2362204724409445
8568700,5,B00BHSG2P6,"I'm not the type of person who works out, but I've watched enough Bollywood movies to think this looked like it could be a fun way to do so. And I was right. I love it!
I wasn't sure if the first DVD in this series was necessary for learning the steps, but went ahead with this one anyway. I'm sure I would have benefited from it, but there is a refresher on this one to learn the steps if you so desire.
I love the way this DVD is broken up into segments. The main workout consists of 11 different routines, ranging from about 3-5 minutes, with different levels of intensity. I love this idea, 1) because you can fit what you want into your schedule, and 2) as a non-workout-er, it's a nice way to ease into it.
Lots of pluses to this workout. I highly recommend it!",1465862400,,767,4.12

8568703,5,B00BHSG2P6,I subscribed to a website with a wide selection of workouts types from many different people. I only had eyes for Doonya. The workouts were challenging and fun. I loved it so much that I had to purchase it!,1422403200,2,206,4.3076923076923075
8568704,5,B00BHSG2P6,"This video is over an hour long, and is full of energetic dance routines.  I did the warm-up, the dance step refresher and only half of the routines and that was just about all I could take.  I did only 40 minutes of the video and I was tired and sweating like crazy.  These two girls make it look easy but it is a workout for sure.

This video is not for the absolute beginner.  If you have no dance experience or if you are totally new to Bollywood dancing, then you may become frustrated because they don't explain the steps extensively.  As I said before, they provide a ""refresher"" for those who have been doing Bollywood dancing.

Otherwise, if you are into dancing, want to change up your routine, and are looking for a long DVD workout video, this one is worth the money.",1419379200,3,779,4.3310344827586205
