8405374,2,B003TPA698,"It is such an annoyance to watch mutilated foreign films, specially Italian productions as in this case, which was obviously a well-mounted co-production, benefiting from the participation of the Yugoslavian film industry, which provided beautiful art direction and bright choreography, as well as fine performers, combined with Italian professionals: cinematographer Mario Bava (a year before making his first feature, ""La maschera del demonio""), composer Roberto Nicolosi and director Riccardo Freda, all working against pretty scenery and fine sets. This version is English-dubbed and 10 minutes shorter than the original (even with the restoration of some footage that had originally been censored in Spain, where the copy was issued): it is a strange mixture of average-looking sections with others that seem to come from a blown-up VHS copy. ""Agi Murad"" though is an attractive wide-screen adventure film with a touch of history, in spite of being not very well acted by Steve Reeves, who this time seems a little beyond his scope for the title role in the dramatic scenes, although he compensates his shortcoming in the action scenes and has Grard Herter to counteract as the Russian villain, and sexy Scilla Gabel as his scheming wife, who has fallen for the ""White Devil"", as Murad is called. By the state the home-video business is today, it is a pity that we will probably never be able to watch these films in their original form.",1456531200,,1442,5.166666666666667
