Its about the struggle of the human spirit in the corporate work place where customs, policies, and corporate traditions often are the invisible bars that block the fulfillment of the human spirit and work potential.  We've all been there at one time or another.

Absolutely one of THE best movie series you will ever see!  Like the first reviewer on Amazon of the show, I was hooked on it with the first episode.  Written well, casted well, directed well, this show is one of the best you will ever watch - EVER!  Granted I watched it with English subtitles but it was well worth it.  The acting is surpurb and the writing is so clever - it will have you entertained from start to finish.  Every episode is filled with the dramas and struggles of people in corporate life, from meeting deadllines, writing contracts, forming trade agreements, finding materials and raw goods, to the squeezes and struggles of the ""salary"" paid employees in their professional and personal life.  You will feel the show flow through your veins and rally with or against the characters.  There are enough twists, turns, and unexpected things that happen, so clever, you will feel deep in your heart the things intended.

I, like the first reviewer of the show stated, saw this on Netflix first.  And I would also purchase the series if I could afford the cost.  But it is a great series!  There seems to be a underrunning vibe in the show, perhaps in alignment to the ""I Ching"", that we tend to be our own worst challenge, and that the Universe has its own way of solving problems.  As in life, there are unpredictable twists and turns and things are more complex than first appearing on the surface.

Many western-made television shows are very narrow in their presentation, keeping things somewhat on a fantasy level, clear cut good and bad guys (ad nauseum), acts of vengence or ""come-uppin's"".  But this show has a style that presents the challenges and hardships with grace and wisdom that will help you laugh, cry, smile, and feel deeply for the characters - and yourself as well!  A great show at a time we need it for today's challenges.

This show has 29 nominations and 16 ""Best"" awards, (when last I checked on the imdb website) from best actors, to best television drama, to best series, to best....best....best... The list goes on and on.  It has 20 episodes that are usually about 1.5 hours long each episode.  After seeing this series, I have also expanded my horizons and have seen some of these talented actors in other television series shows as well.  To find many of them all pooled together in this series is amazing.  What a great, smart, awesome show!

I wish, and am waiting for Season 2 - if they make one!",1519171200,,2749,4.667359667359667
8705538,5,B00UF8G94I,"I found this title on Netflix. Before watching ""Train to Busan"", which is also excellent, I had never before watched Korean films/television. I watched one episode of Misaeng and I was hooked! I watched the entire first series on Netflix. I laughed out loud. I cried big crocodile tears. Please give this show a chance. I promise you, you will not be sorry!

This is one of the best television series I have ever seen. Hands down. In fact, if these discs weren't so expensive, I would purchase them myself. I highly, highly, highly recommend this. Don't worry about it if you don't speak Korean (I don't!) - there are English subtitles!

Wonderful! Heart-warming!
I loved it! I'm telling everyone about it! I hope they make a Season 2!",1509580800,2,735,4.689922480620155
