885288,5,6304437234,"They can remake this movie a hundred times but they'll never get another actor to play Arthur as hilariously as Dudley Moore. He was so good, he raises this movie to a new level, with his pixilated millionaire who drinks way too much and spoils himself rotten, and the butler, brilliantly portrayed by the staid British Shakespearean actor, John Gielgud. Those two get involved in the life of young Liza Minelli, who shoplifts in order to get a birthday gift for her father.",1510531200,,474,4.72289156626506

885335,5,6304437234,"Hilarious and charming! Loved every minute of it.
From the plight of a lonely, drunkard and troubled playboy, we see the story of how one man falls in love with a woman he saves from a shoplifting scheme. Dudley Moore is perfect in this role, and you almost feel sorry for him, despite is upper-class and affluence. His role is augmented by his succinct and brutally honest butler, who attempts to keep him on the straight and narrow, but often fails.
Would definitely recommend.",1500336000,,479,4.714285714285714

886209,5,6304437234,"Another of my favorite movies the comedic genius of Dudley Moore is rampant here and never lets up. It's an absolute crime that mr. Moore is no longer with us.  and the same goes for Hobson- John Gielgud's character with  the dead Pan delivery of one liners and his caring nature for his care-Arthur being just perfect for this movie.  It's just a fun movie that although is a laugh a minute, does have some points in it that show some hints of a serious undertone and field it expertly. I think so highly of it I own in in VHS DVD & Amazon's video streaming formats.  A must see if you love to laugh",1461715200,,600,4.191304347826087

John Gielgud earned his Oscar with a wonderfully witty performance. Dudley Moore was so much fun.

886559,5,6304437234,Still as funny and heart-warming as it was when it was released in 1981. It showcases Moore's greatest film performance in his tragically shortened career as well as John Gielgud's hysterical and Academy Award winning role as Arthur's beleaguered butler and father figure Hobson.,1443484800,,279,5.363636363636363
886560,5,6304437234,"Arthur is an overgrown child in a 40something body that refuses to grow up. His parents and grandmother have pre-arranged a marriage to very wealthy heiress Susan, a well intended, but too straight laced match for the juvenile delinquent Arthur. He needs to resolve himself to the marriage because the resulting union will result in over a billion dollar estate.

The movie opens with Arthur drunkenly babbling in the back seat of his 500,000 cream colored Rolls Royce, looking for company on the streets of New York. He eventually ends up home with a lady of the night where Arthur's servant, Hobson, quickly expels the lady. The two banter and it's obvious they've known each other since Arthur was a boy. He sort of follows directions from Arthur with the ever present brilliant humor that the English are so well known for.

Arthur is at a fifth avenue men's store when he spots Linda Morolla, a very cute, witty, and bubbly waitress in New York. She is caught stealing a tie, and on the way out of the building a security stops her. Arthur follows her out and intercedes and saves her, but after he forces a kiss from her, claiming he's her husband.

What ensues are the antics the two engage in while Arthur painfully moves closer to his wedding date to the very wealthy, innocent Susan ultra rich heiress. Susan's father basically intimidates Arthur and tells him after marriage he will employ him in his business and ""straighten him out.""

Arthur faces a major dilemma in his life. Does he want to fulfill the family destiny and create a billion dollar dynasty, or chase after the cute, smart girl waitress from the Bronx?  You'll have to watch the movie and find out.  While the humor and surroundings are dated, the story is still beautiful and very funny and witty.

Highly recommended.",1443225600,,1797,4.722044728434505

I did appreciate his conviction to not marry a woman he didn't love and his willingness to do whatever would make the woman he did love happy.  Hobson the butler was good for a few funny lines.  Some of his wit was snobbish and not appreciated by Arthur, but it appeared that Arthur felt that Hobson was his only friend, not to mention father figure, as Arthur's real father was far too busy.  Arthur seemed to be a wastrel with no focus until he is smitten by Linda.  The movie ends positively, but I couldn't help but wonder how much his drinking would get in the way of his having a meaningful relationship with his new bride.",1419552000,,800,4.217105263157895

Trouble is, he falls in love with a poor wannabe actress played by Liza Minnelli.  John Gielgud plays Arthur's butler, who tries to help Arthur out.

This is supposed to be a comedy, but I found it humorless.  Being an alcoholic is not funny-if you want to know how it really is to be one, watch the movie ""Leaving Las Vegas"".  Even when he is sober, Arthur is simply an unlikable character, as Gielgud sees as he tries to get Arthur on track.  When the butler is dying, Arthur starts showing concern for him-but after he does die, Arthur goes back to his bad old ways, publicly humiliating his bride during the wedding ceremony, and the bride hardly deserved it.  And in the end, the mother lets Arthur have his inheritance despite everything.  What a beautiful ending.

Another bad element-Liza Minnelli.  She clearly only got into the entertainment business because of her father, and she is ugly and a mediocre actress, and as appealing as eating a worm sandwich.  She makes John Wayne look like Lawrence Olivier.",1394064000,,1207,4.64622641509434

This film has so many memories for me especially now, I walk by all these places in the film on my walk to the office, but nothing can be match by the chemistry and wit of Sir Jon Gielgud, Liza Minnelli, and of course Sir Dudley Moore.

The cast is amazing, the writing, astounding which make this film timeless. If you have never been to New York City, watch this first before you go, most things in the film are the same, and it will make your visit that much more special.",1387324800,,672,4.083333333333333

Arthur (played brilliantly by Dudley Moore) is a billionaire playboy who has never grown up or held a job...he is also an absolutely FUN LOVING alcoholic.  When his rich family decides a ""merger"" with another wealthy family would be in everyone's best interest, they tell Arthur he must marry the daughter or lose EVERYTHING.  The problem is that Arthur has fallen in love with Linda, a poor waitress (Liza Minelli) and doesn't want to marry Linda (Jill Eikenberry who makes Linda deliciously mundane).  Linda's father, who never drinks (""you probably never run out of ice your whole life""), loves his little girl more than anything and is extremely menacing.

Arthur Bach (Dudley Moore) is a very rich short man in New York City. He is going out for the evening with his driver, Bitterman (Ted Ross). He picks up a lady-of-the-evening, Gloria (Anne De Salvo) and is just full of laughs and liquor. You see Arthur likes to get tipsy. He takes Gloria to his favorite restaurant for dinner and embarrasses his wealthy Aunt (Justine Johnston) and Uncle (Maurice Copeland) there.
 The next morning, a train set circles a bedroom. It is Arthur in bed with his overnite guest. His butler, Hobson (Sir John Gielgud) comes in to awake him and give him his hangover breakfast. After Hobson sends the woman off and Arthur decides to take a boyish bath, they later go to a clothing store in the Bach building. He sees a woman, Linda (Liza Minnelli) wearing a yellow rain jacket and with a yellow tote bag, she is shoplifting. He is astonished, but amazed. Security stops her outside and insists, they see what is in her bag. After she causes a scene, Arthur steps in to save her. To make his act convincing that he knows her, he suddenly guesses her.
  Later that night, they go on a date. The Bach family warns Arthur he must marry Susan (Jill Eikenberry) or he will not be allowed to have his family fortune. But he likes Linda.

888622,4,6304437234,"There are certain comedy classics that are truly ""timeless"" even though they are remarkably dated. You could not get away with making films such as ""Blazing Saddles"" in today's ""PC"" environment, much less this 1981 comedy gem.

Arthur Bach is a drunk, spoiled, and lecherous man (superbly played by Dudley Moore). He has no redeeming qualities. His public drunkenness is the stuff of legend. He frequents prostitutes openly. He holds no position in his father's company, nor does he really contribute to society in any way....

....yet we LOVE him.

Moore channels the spoiled child perfectly. He's certainly not a ""mean"" drunk, but he is clearly without focus or direction in his life. His loyal man-servant Hobson (a well deserved Oscar nod for Sir John Gielgud) seems to be his sole anchor to sensibility. Moore falls for a street wise waitress played by Liza Minelli, much to the chagrin of his father, and his father's potential business associate Bert Johnson. He stands to lose $75 million if he doesn't marry Johnson's daughter Susan.

Though the drunken shennanigans make for some funny moments, the true heart of this film isn't with Arthur and Linda.....it is with Arthur and Hobson. It is in the midst of his heartache over Hobson's illness that Arthur truly learns what it is to be a grown up, and that life is too fleeting to let what is important slip through a drunken haze.

An attempted remake in 2011 would not remotely compare to this timeless classic...and, quite frankly, I'm astonished an actor of Helen Mirren's caliber would agree to such a hack job of an endearing classic.

The interaction between Dudley Moore (Arthur) and John Gielgud (Hobson, his butler) makes this an unforgettable classic!  I hadn't watched the movie in many years, but some of John Gielgud's lines have become regularly heard around my house (like when Arthur announces that he is going to take a bath, and Hobson remarks dryly, ""I'll alert the media!"", and when asked if he will prepare the bathtub, Hobson says sarcastically, ""It's what I live for, sir.""). Liza Minelli also makes a good ""nobody from Queens"" as Arthur's mother refers to her. Dudley Moore does a great job of not only making you laugh at his drunken antics, and feel pity for an adult that never left childhood, but also hopeful for him as he finally starts to ""grow up"".",1304899200,,865,4.684210526315789

It seemed like humor came naturally to him. I loved everything he was ever in. I'm sure there will be a lot of people comparing the two movies, but it's my opinion, that this one is the best. Of course, I am older and some of the vulgar language and things that the younger generation find funny are lost on me. I recommend that folks watch this movie first before they see the new one and make their own decision. I wish Hollywood would stop making all these remakes of old movies and just make new stuff. To me it looks like they have run out of new ideas so they pick an old movies and do these remakes. They need to stop doing that and just come up with new stuff.

888838,5,6304437234,"Recently, I watched the 1981 romantic comedy ""Arthur"" for the first time in a long time.  I discovered that nearly three decades after its initial release this film has not lost its any of its charm.  Arthur Bach (Dudley Moore) is a hapless millionaire playboy who is rarely sober and seems entirely incapable of doing anything for himself.  Lucky for him that his trusted valet Hobson (John Gielgud) is usually around and looking out for his interests.  Sadly, Arthur is a young man with no goals and no ambition.  And to make matters worse his family has arranged for Arthur marry to a wealthy socialite named Susan Johnson (Jill Eikenberry).  The only problem is that Arthur has no feelings at all for this girl and his family has threatened to cut off his inheritance if he refuses to go along.  It's no wonder that Arthur is resorting more and more to the bottle for comfort.

Then one day during one of his frequent and frivilous shopping excursions downtown Arthur witnesses an event that would change his life forever. An attractive young working girl named Linda Marolla (Liza Minnelli) has been nabbed for shoplifting.  Seeing her predicament Arthur comes to her rescue by pretending that she was with him.  It is quite apparent that in just the course of a few short minutes our hero has fallen head over heels for this young lady.  And who could blame him?  As I recall I was so taken with Liza Minnelli in her role of Linda that I wanted to step right into the movie and marry her myself!  For the first time in his life Arthur is in love and Linda views Arthur as her knight in shining armor.  But hold on!  Will Arthur renounce the family fortune to marry Linda or will he cave in and submit to his father's wishes and marry Susan?  The fact is that there are hundreds of millions of dollars at stake here.  It is this dilemma that ""Arthur"" is all about and it makes for both a touching and hilarious motion picture.

""Arthur"" was a huge hit at the box office back in 1981 earning Warner Brothers in the neighborhood of $82 million.  Dudley Moore did a workmanlike job in the role of Arthur Bach and was nominated for an Academy Award.  But  I particularly enjoyed the work of Liza Minnelli and John Gielgud who both turned in unforgettable performances.  In fact, Gielgud won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.  In addition, the Burt Bacharach/Peter Allen tune ""Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do)"" sung by Christopher Cross won the Academy Award for best song and ranked among the top singles for 1981.  Recently, I discovered that plans are afoot to do a remake of ""Arthur"".  Bad idea.  It is doubtful that you could ever recreate the magic that you will find in the original.  ""Arthur"" remains one of my 20 or so favorite movies of all-time.  Don't mess with it!  Very highly recommended!",1262131200,,2811,4.577154308617234

A fun and witty comedy that makes the most out of Moore and Gielgud's considerable comic talents, Arthur is hurt slightly by Liza Minelli (who isn't nearly as charming as the screenplay makes her character out to be), but nonetheless represents quite an enjoyable 110 minutes in front of a screen.",1238803200,,315,4.833333333333333

888895,5,6304437234,"This is one of those surprisingly delightful films that rarely gets the attention it deserves yet for some reason got that attention.  Watching the movie I was floored at the fact that it won two Oscars and was nominated for more.  It just does not feel like an Academy movie at all, with over the top yet resoundingly sincere performances that just don't seem like the type the Academy would recognize, and yet Dudley Moore found himself an Oscar nominee and John Gielgud actually WON the Oscar.

The film is an entertaining little comedy about a rich young heir named Arthur who falls in love with a struggling actress named Linda.  She loves him despite his money, but his father is adamant that he marry another woman.  With the threat of losing his money, Arthur relies on his trusty butler to help him make the right decisions and ultimately `get the girl'.

It's a feel good movie, nothing more nothing less.

That doesn't overshadow the fact that it is a wonderful movie.  Just because it isn't as deep as you may want your Oscar fare to be doesn't mean that it isn't worthy of all the praise and adoration it has received.  It is wonderfully constructed, wildly entertaining and is memorable to boot.  You could watch this movie over and over and never tire of it; that is for sure.

The acting is also a nice touch.  John Gielgud is the standout, and the Oscar he has proves that.  He is witty and sharp and heart touching to boot.  Dudley Moore, in my opinion, also should have won the Oscar.  Sure he was up against dramatic heavy weights like Warren Beatty and Henry Fonda but seriously, his pitch perfect comedic timing is flawless and needed to be recognized.  He plays the majority of the film drunk yet he never lapses into mediocre repetition but is constantly fresh and his performance is beyond rewarding.  Liza Minnelli is decent here, but she falls to the wayside when you consider her leading man.  Still, she has talent and that charismatic touch that elevates her performance.

It's witty, charming, touching and most importantly unforgettable.  It's a surefire comedy that you will enjoy and can enjoy again and again.",1233273600,,2144,4.681818181818182

888897,1,6304437234,"I feel sorry for the late great Dudley Moore as he's a much much better comedian than he is portrayed as here in a very poor movie in far too many aspects.  The script is poor and the jokes age very, very poorly too.  The only exception for some reason seems to be Sir John Gielgud's lines which were able to raise a chuckle or two from me and his was the only redeeming acting feature from this film.  ""That"" song was another redeeming feature written as it was by the great Burt Bacharach but otherwise, this is a poor excuse for a comedy and actually a poor excuse for a film.

I actually enjoyed Dudley Moore's performance as a guest on ""The Muppet Show"" a whole lot better than his work here as he seems woefully miscast here.  I can't understand how the script can be so unbalanced and it seems as if only Gielgud was reading his lines while Moore and Minnelli seemed to be making it up as they went along.  I truly struggle to recall the last time I watched such a boring and totally uninspiring film.

Not that this matters given the lousy content but this dvd version is also very, very poor.  It hasn't been restored or remastered and so the picture quality is average at best while the sound quality is pathetic; it was so soft volume wise and even when you increase the volume a lot higher than you'd usually do for other dvds the quality is still so poor that you have to struggle at times to hear the dialogue but in the case this film I guess you could say that it's a blessing here.

Very bad film, even worse quality dvd makes this a very highly not recommended film.  Please don't judge the late great Dudley Moore's comedic qualities by this film as a great talent like his deserves to be remembered differently.  Practically anything that he's ever done is a vast improvement to his ""work"" here.",1231545600,,1815,4.340236686390533

888900,4,6304437234,"4 1/2 stars would be more accurate. While many comedies revolve around the cruel ridicule of certain parties, this is a MAJOR exception. We meet the millionaire Dudley Moore who seems to be a heavy drinker. But is he a drinker by nature? Perhaps not. His father wants him to marry Susan, (who he doesn't love) for financial reasons. Later, Arthur meets the poor (but likable) Linda. While Arthur seems to know that there are some things that money can't buy, he is realizing he may seem to know real love. In his small role, Linda's father goes from suspecting Linda's dating life to cheering it. But if we want to understand him, he probably doesn't want to think of his daughter being destitute after he dies.

While Arthur loves Linda, he is afraid of being disinherited and has to make a choice between love (Linda) and money (Susan). Geraldine Fitzgerald tries to make the choice easy. She says to marry Susan and cheat with Linda, but Arthur can not do that.

The character who steals the movie is John Gielgud as Arthur's servant.  At first, he seems to abhor Arthur for his heavy drinking and self absorption. (Much like a father would be annoyed by his son at a young age.) One of his most memorable lines is: ""Arthur, if you feel unloved, welcome to the world."" But is he so unfeeling? Realizing he may not be around much longer, he explains to Linda that he won't be around much longer, and he asks Linda to take his role.

The most wonderful thing about this movie is that portrays the transition one goes through from the love a 'father' has for his 'son,' to the love  a man shares with a woman.

There is an interesting mix of suspense, menace, comedy, and a happy ending. It is a wonderful, beautiful, poignant movie.",1212969600,,1733,4.520766773162939
888901,4,6304437234,"DIALOGUE QUOTED

The late, great comedic genius Dudley Moore does a star turn as Arthur Bach the lovable lush in this 1981 comedy also starring Liza Minnelli as the love of his life, Linda Marola, and Sir John Gielgud as Hobson, his snooty but faithful manservant.

ARTHUR could not have been made today. His incessant drinking, comic then, would be considered so Politically Incorrect today that nobody would want to touch it---the sequel, ARTHUR 2: ON THE ROCKS, released a bare two years later, was already being criticized as too flippant in its treatment of alcoholism. So went the Reagan Revolution.

Regardless of the political climate, ARTHUR is a funny film. The witty by-play between the two Englishmen, Moore and Gielgud, is so dry snd razor sharp it has yet to dull after twenty seven years and countless viewings. Moore described their dialogue as ""the give-and-take between two RAF pilots during the War,"" and that is as accurate a description as can be found anywhere---

""Hobson?""
""Yes, Arthur?""
""Do you know what I'm going to do?""
""No, I don't.""
""I'm going to take a bath.""
""I'll alert the media.""

***

""Arthur, I see no reason to continue this conversation  [with Linda Marola]; that is, unless you're planning to knock over a fruit stand later on this evening.""

***

Linda [To Arthur]: ""What should I wear?""
Hobson: ""Steal something casual.""

***

Bert Johnson [Athur's father-in-law-to-be]: ""I protect what's mine. And I do it in an ugly way.""
Arthur: ""Um...I can see that.""
Bert Johnson: ""I killed a man when I was eleven years old.""
Arthur: ""When you're that age I bet you don't even know there's a law against that.""
Bert Johnson: ""He was hungry. He came into our house. To steal our food.""
Arthur [waving a hand]: ""Oh. Well, he was just asking for it.""
Bert Johnson: ""I took a knife. And I stabbed him in the kitchen.""
Arthur [horrified]: ""I guess your family ate out that night...what...with that man... lying there on the...floor.""

***

Perry's Wife [screaming]: ""WHAT DO YOU WANT???????
Arthur [startled almost sober]: Yaaahhh! I was looking for Linda I hope this is the wrong house excuse me!
Perry's Wife [screaming]: ""MY HUSBAND HAS A GUN!!!!!!!""
Arthur: ""I'm sure he does, Madame. For all I know, he probably shot it while you were shouting.""

---and so on. ARTHUR contains some of the funniest and most memorable one-liners ever written for the screen, and the dichotomy between Arthur's stuffy Old Money family, the gentle Arthur, and the solid working class Linda is riotous. When viewing ARTHUR, I am always surprised at how fast this film moves along, the hallmark of an enjoyable experience.

Stormy weather ensues, with probably the least likely heroine coming to the fore at the film's climax.

Liza  Minnelli, Geraldine Fitzgerald and the rest of the cast are all very good and her comic timing with Moore and Geilgud is razor sharp too.

889087,5,6304437234,"This has been one of my favorite movies for a long time.  Recently I was happy to see it on DVD which is a relief from watching the old, grainy VHS versions.

I hadn't seen it in years and watched it today to find myself amazed at how well the movie stands up to time.  It's one of those rare, perfect storms of comedy where great writing (truly funny line after truly funny line) is paired with great direction and outstanding performances all at the same time.

Dudley Moore got an Oscar nomination for ""Arthur"" but lost (although John Gielgud won for best supporting actor).  If Moore's performance in ""Arthur"" doesn't win a Best Actor Oscar -it's proof that no comedic actor could ever win the title (another example is Gene Wilder in ""Young Frankenstein"").

Steve Gordon crafts the film beautifully keeping true to each of the characters and the warm-hearted tone of the story.  Quite simply, IMHO the movie is a rare gem.  It's only sad that Steve Gordon passed away just a year after ""Arthur"" was released.

Regarding the DVD, it's so/so.  Although the video quality is a leap over the old VHS copies, there is still no widescreen version available.

The DVD has a few extras that are nice but it's just not enough.  One example is commentary from the Director stating how he greatly wished how certain deleted takes and scenes could have been included (because they were hysterical), but that he had to make tough choices for a final edit.  The DVD, being the perfect format to include such material, certainly should have offered it as well.

This, the original ""Arthur"", is a classic comedy that is one for the books.",1167609600,,1627,4.643356643356643

The story is a trite replay of the ""poor little rich man meets golden hearted girl, and love conquers all"" theme, without any attempt at originality or sophistication (anyone who compares this favorably to 30s screwball comedies needs his/her head examined). The script doesn't even bother to exploit the most obvious opportunity for humor, the English/American divide - unless I missed something we aren't even told why all these Englishmen are in the States and what it is they are dong there. Absolutely awful - the only redeeming aspect of it is Sir John Gielgud (""SIR JOHN"", NOT ""SIR GIELGUD"", PLEASE, LIKE ANOTHER REVIEWER WROTE!!!) who is mildly funny most of the time although again the script does not bother to develop his character: while he supposedly loves Arthur loyally and deeply, in one scene he calls him - quite deservedly - a useless little sh.. or something along those lines, but this is never repeated and never explained, just a throwaway line without any relevance to the character.

889090,4,6304437234,"This is one of the best 80's comedies ever. I think this movie speaks to all of us who are still thinking about growing up and reminds those that had to grow too quickly because of a truamatic event. Arthur lived a pampered life by most of our standards and he resisted the world he knew was coming quickly (i.e. marriage, career, and growing old.) The part I love best about the movie is his several refrences to Santa Claus. Which affirms in my mind that he was still very very young at heart. What I appreciate most about this movie is the very subtle and detail oriented comedy that Dudley Moore is known for. In my mind he is only second to Lucille Ball in the physical comedy department. I hate to put a list in the middle of this review but I just hope these subtle points make the movie that much more enjoyable when you see them.

1. In the Plaza restaurant is the first refrence to Santa Claus when he refers to waiters.

2. When he is waiting for Susan and her father says something like: ""If ever someone got in my way, they got hurt."" Arthur looks up at the moose on the wall out of the corner of his eye.

3. I don't know why I find this so funny but after his engadgement he goes to visit Linda and he knocks the evelope rack off of the half wall, the director literally spends almost a full minute just focused on Arthur drunk trying to put it back together. After he can't do it he delivers my favorite line of the movie: ""This is a goner""

4. At the reception party Arthur sings Santa Claus is Coming to Town.

5. I love that Linda is portrayed as not being used to wealth at all when she is completely out of place at the formal party and she makes the cute comment that it ""feels just like prom night"" because she is all dressed up. To Arthur this is just a normal night.

I could go through dozens more but I will leave you time to order the movie. This is a well made and well acted movie and well worth the bargain that it is. Thanks for reading.",1158710400,,1969,4.114583333333333

I first saw Dudley Moore in ""Foul Play,"" thought he was very funny. Based upon that, I bought ""10"" and ""Arthur,"" as it turned out a downward trajectory.

What I dislike about ""Arthur"" is Moore playing a loud, obnoxious drunk telling unfunny jokes, and Minelli playing a salt-of-the-earth working girl who loves Arthur for himself, not for his $750 million fortune. Even John Gielgud, who was great in ""The Loved One"" a much better comedy, can't resurrect this turkey.

889092,4,6304437234,"This 1981 comedy still sparkles thanks to the combined efforts of writer/director Steve Gordon and stars Dudley Moore and John Gielgud. Sadly, Gordon, only in his early forties, died soon after completing this, his only feature film. It's an especially unfortunate loss since he shows a truly deft hand at character-driven farce that makes the whole film irresistible. It plays almost like a 1930's-style screwball comedy revamped for contemporary tastes. The plot centers on Arthur Bach, a drunken, diminutive millionaire playboy who is at risk of losing his $750 million inheritance if he doesn't marry the dowdy and boring Susan Johnson, an heiress handpicked by his old-money father and dotty grandmother. Of course, he doesn't love her and by chance, runs into Linda Marolla, a working-class waitress (and of course, aspiring actress) after she pilfers a Bergdorf Goodman tie for her father.

The standard complications ensue but in a most endearing way with loads of alcohol-fueled slapstick executed with classic lan by Moore. That he makes such a spoiled character likable is a credit not only to his comic talents but to Gielgud's feisty, acidic turn as Hobson, Arthur's devoted but reality-grounded valet. It's the type of role he could play in his sleep, but Gielgud makes Hobson such a truly memorable character that his fate in the film brings a welcome injection of poignancy in the proceedings. In probably her most likable film role, Liza Minnelli hands the picture to her male co-stars by toning down her usual razzle-dazzle personality and making Linda quite genuine in motivation.

A pre-""LA Law"" Jill Eikenberry plays Susan just at the right passive-aggressive note, while Barney Martin (Jerry's dad on ""Seinfeld"") steals all his scenes as Linda's slovenly father Ralph. The one fly in the ointment is veteran actress Geraldine Fitzgerald, who overdoes the eccentricities of the grandmother. And I have to admit that I still can't stand the very dated, overplayed Christopher Cross song that inevitably won the Oscar for that year's best song. Unfortunately, the 1997 DVD, certainly in need of remastering, has no extras worth noting except some photos and production notes.",1153612800,,2194,5.230113636363637

889140,5,6304437234,"When Arthur came out in 1981, I thought the trailers looked stupid.  But I finally broke down and saw the film.  I was not in the best of moods walking into the theatre but was smiling from ear to ear walking out.  This is one of the funniest films ever.

Arthur Bock (Dudley Moore) is the quintessential spoiled second generation millionaire.  He has never had to work a day in his life.  He has his own penthouse suite complete with running trains and butler.  Arthur's favorite pastime is getting drunk and embarrassing the upper-class.

 We first see Arthur as he is being chauffeured through the red light district.  He picks up a profession (her friend gets $50 for coming in second).  He takes her to a fancy restaurant, saying she is a princess from a small country (so small that last year the recarpeted the entire country!).  The next morning enter Hobson (John Gielguld), an acerbic British butler.  He has the perfect one line response to any situation.

Arthur is summoned by his father.  The edict is given that Arthur must marry the daughter of dad's business rival or be cut off from his inheritance.  Arthur's answer to that is to go shopping and spend more of dad's money.  There he spies a quirky shoplifter, Linda Marolla (Liza Minnelli).  Something about her interests Arthur and he pursues her.

Eventually, reality wins out and Arthur must come to terms with his pending nuptials.  Now this leads to the funniest scenes of the film.  First is when Hobson realizes that Arthur really loves Linda and goes to her apartment to tell to go to the engagement party. (Best Line: ""Please get me two aspirin.  You will find them on the second shelf of the medicine cabinet behind the unused shave cream."")  Next is when Linda shows up at the engagement party.  (Best Line: ""I was in the neighborhood, it took two taxi's, a bus and a train.  But I was in the neighborhood"")  Finally, is the wedding that completely falls apart.

This was one of the best written comedies with one liners that are still being repeated.  Dudley Moore gives his best performance ever.  Unfortunately, it was too good and most people thought that he was like Arthur.  Liza showed she inherited her mother's comic timing.  But the film was stolen by John Gielguld.  Gielguld deservedly won an Oscar for his perfect performance.  Also notable is Ted Ross (Tony winner as the Cowardly Lion in The Wiz) as the chauffer and Geraldine Fitzgerald as Arthur's hard as nails grandmother.  Oh and don't forget the great theme song!!

""Arthur take my hand.""

""But that would leave you with one.""

(Ah, yes, the years have passed and the City doesn't exactly look that way anymore but it's still a great place for lovers. And, although it doesn't have the legendary romance of Paris, New York City has a long history of being the backdrop for movie love stories.)

But back to the movie: Dudley Moore is so energetic, so loud, that he threatens to steal every scene. And yet, you want him to. When Arthur is not on the screen, the movie suddenly seems to have lost a little giddiness. However, Liza Minelli more than holds her own here, and displays an incredible sense of comedic timing.

He is on the verge of marrying Susan (Jill Eikenberry) when he meets Linda (Liza Minelli) shoplifting clothes she can't afford to buy. They fall in love and, despite being threatened with the loss of his inheritance, Moore marries her. It's fairly predictable, though well-acted and interesting throughout. The humor is bright. Moore is very good as the lush who sobers up to Minelli, and his relationship with his valet (John Gielgud) is moving. For me the best scene is at a Christmas Eve party where Moore is asked to play the piano and he goes from an elaborate classical introduction into a jazzy ""Santa Claus Is Coming To Town."" It only lasts a minute, but it's breathtaking. (Moore was a jazz pianist before turning to acting.) Worth a watch.",1122422400,,869,4.723684210526316

The following year,he co-starred with Bo Derek in ""10"",which was his first starring American film. The disappointing WHOLLY MOSES followed in 1980. That same year,Moore did this film with Liza Minelli,daughter of the late Judy Garland. It was filmed in New York City and was theatrically released in July 1981. Moore won a Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Arthur Bach,a drunk millionaire who goes broke. Arthur is engaged to Susan Johnson(pre-L.A. Law Jill Eikenberry) but the engagement is broken and Arthur's money is taken away by Susan's father. In one of the first scenes,Arthur spends the night at his apartment with a hooker named Gloria. Then Arthur meets Linda,a diner waitress(Minelli) in a department store where she is shoplifting. Arthur and Linda hook up immediately. But the wedding between Arthur and Susan almost happened. Susan was dressed in her wedding gown and Arthur tells her at the very last minute that he's in love with Linda. Susan's father enters the chapel and beats the crap out of Arthur. The movie soundtrack album has been long out-of-print(it was never re-issued on CD). It features ARTHUR'S THEME(Best That You Can Do) performed by Christopher Cross. That song is available on some CD compilations and was one of 1981's top hits. For the next eleven years,Moore relentlessly made movies such as SIX WEEKS with Mary Tyler Moore,UNFAITHFULLY YOURS,BEST DEFENSE with Eddie Murphy,LIKE FATHER LIKE SON with Kirk Cameron,LOVESICK with Elizabeth McGovern,MICKI & MAUDE with Amy Irving and Ann Reinking,CRAZY PEOPLE with Daryl Hannah,BLAME IT ON THE BELLBOY and of course,ARTHUR 2:ON THE ROCKS with Minnelli. ARTHUR 2 was theatrically released in 1988 and wasn't as successful as the first film. Sadly,Dudley passed away in March 2002 of complications from diabetes. He was 66.

Dudley Moore shines as the loveable Arthur (for which he earned an academy award nom.) who just can't stay sober. Just about everyone in the cast of this film is simply brilliant. Especially Dudley and the man who plays Hobson. (I forgot his real name) These two are simply magic on the screen and work off each other extremely well. Liza Minelli is also very good in this film and her and Dudley have a great chemistry together and pull off some wonderful comedy.
This has been one of my fav. comedies for a long time now and I just saw it again today and was compelled to finally write a review on it. It's so ironic, considering that Arthur is somebody current society frowns upon deeply. A womanizing, drunk who drinks and drives at every excuse and is immature and irresponsible. But you just can't help but adore him. He's as funny as funny comes and the comedy in the film is true to life. (not stupid comedy like Something about Mary or films of the like)

It was something of a flashpoint for a young kid from rural Ontario; not only was I rolling in the aisles throughout the picture, it was also the first time I had zuccini, (a love affair that continues to this day).
  Warner Bros. deserves high marks for their presentation of ""Arthur"" on DVD.  The plentiful supplementary materials include trailers, (one from the original theatrical run as well as the re-release trailer - YES!), archival footage, a brief-but-candid documentary on the making of the sequel, ""Arthur 2 - On the Rocks,"" and generous actor and crew bios.

The screen relationship between these two was played to such perfection that both men earned Oscar nominations, and Gielgud deservingly walked home with the statue.
In retrospect, there is so much more to like about the movie now than there was more than 20 years ago. Arthur is someone who our society has taught us to abhor -- a wealthy, drunk womanizer who seemingly takes every opportunity to drive under the influence. And yet we love him. He's witty, he's cute (as Liza Minnelli opines, ""Like one of Santa's helpers) -- and yet's a lot like most of us, searching for the someone inside of him who someone else can love. Steve Gordon, who tragically died less than a year after this film was released, created the perfect blend of humor, romance and drama. The result is something which can be watched again and again, and which somehow never gets old.
Everything about Arthur is incredible, from the Oscar-winning theme song to the finely-honed screenplay to the myriad of wonderful performances. Simply put, this is by far my favorite movie to watch, and I rank it among the five best comedies ever made.",1022803200,,1262,4.767123287671233

I still loved that delightful tune, ""Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do)"", which was sung by Christopher Cross. Of course, ""Arthur"" focuses on Arthur Bach (Moore), a playboy millionaire who is usually drunk most of the time.

""Arthur"" is a movie that has received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor by Sir John Gielgud (""The Elephant Man""), who plays Arthur's unusually wisecracking butler Hobson. In fact, ""Arthur"" was considered to be such a hilarious classic that it had spawned a sequel named ""Arthur 2: On the Rocks"" about 7 years later in which Arthur experiences what it is like to be poor and among the working class, etc. In closing, there will be nothing quite like ""Arthur""...definitely one of the best Dudley Moore films of all time and of the 1980's.

Although I eventually got tired of hearing the overplayed ""Arthur's Theme"" on the radio back in the early '80's, I really have not tired of watching this movie. It has aged surprisingly well for a film that makes such good use of the New York City locations that existed at that time (not to mention the quaint old taxicabs). This is a film with a basic romantic plot that deals primarily with how love wins over money; however, this film never takes its own plot too seriously. Instead, it has much more fun with the assorted *characters*, like Arthur Bach (Dudley Moore), Linda Marolla (Liza Minnelli), the wisecracking butler Hobson (hilariously played by the wonderful Sir John Gielgud, who deservedly won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for this), Arthur's dominating mother Martha Bach (Geraldine Fitzgerald), Arthur's WASP-y bride-to-be Susan Johnson (a pre-L.A. Law Jill Eikenberry), Susan's brutish father Burt Johnson (Stephen Elliott), and, of course, Bitterman, Arthur's Chauffer (Ted Ross, in a much better role than the Cowardly Lion he played in the big-budget 1978 misfire THE WIZ).  Some of dialogue is classic, especially between Arthur and Hobson! Also, this is arguably the last great movie that Liza has ever starred in.
ARTHUR is one of the great comedies that most of the family can enjoy.  However, it's not really for kids under age 10, as the language is fairly racy and major plot points involve prostitutes, shoplifting, and in the case of the perpetually inebriated Arthur, alcoholism.  In fact, when it was released, many people criticized this film for turning alcoholism into one big running joke, as well as glamorizing it. This is what prompted the much-later sequel, ARTHUR 2: ON THE ROCKS, in which Arthur finally gets to experience the dark side of his habit.

I can't even pick a  favorite part because every thirty seconds something that was absolutely  milk flying out of your nose funny would happen.  Another good part to the  movie is you see a person who on the outside is just a hilarious drunkerd,  make decions based on love and kindness and you see him give a little of  himself.  I just rented the movie and i'm going to buy it ASAP i suggest  you do the same.",966297600,,985,4.03125
889505,5,6304437234,"Dudley Moore at his finest.  I've seen 'Arthur' touted as a ""screwball"" fest that seems to hail from the past, yet I disagree.  Arthur seemed to me both original and sentimental.  Moore's  drunken, child-like, character confronts mortality within the only father  figure apparent, John Gielgud's ""Hobson"", Arhtur's butler/nanny.  Touching and effective, we find that through Arthur's eyes, we too can  remain adults yet feel as children through the guidances of those we love.  All involved turn in superb performances.  Gielgud's performance is not  only incredible but touching as the ""father-apparent"". Do  yourself a favor and buy this movie.",960508800,,646,5.489795918367347
889506,5,6304437234,"Dudley Moore is absolutely irresistable in this delightful screwball comedy, which strikes the perfect balance between hilarity and sentiment.  Liza Minnelli does an exceptional job with an undrwritten part, and Jill  Eikenberry deserved accolades for her superb comic-foil uptight fiancee.  And John Gielgud bites into his role of the acerbic butler with glee.  To  top it all off, and I think the reason this movie remains such a favorite,  there is the genuine surprise of the emotion you feel for each of these  characters.  Helped along by the snazzy Burt Bacharach-infused musical  score, featuring the absolutely delicious pop hit ""The Best That You  Can Do"", this movie deftly conjures up both the 30s screwball comedies  so affectionately evoked here and the contemporary magic of New York at  night. It is a warm and moving movie, and it understands completely that a  comedy must do it all to win your heart -- Arthur and company do,  completely.",945993600,,957,5.051282051282051
889507,5,6304437234,"I have only seen this movie about 50 times - and it never gets boring - a classic that will endure forever.  Dudley Moore is unforgettable as the infamous Arthur Bach. He is generously funny and warm. I highly recommend  this movie to anyone who is either a romantic, or a drinker, a thief, a  rich person or a poor person.  There are people/places/scenes in this movie  that everyone can relate to.",944438400,,399,4.486111111111111
889508,5,6304437234,Arthur is an alltime feel good movie which is well casted and incredibly funny!! Yhere is not better actor than Dudley to play a drunk so convincingly whilst being so funny.  The scene where he fall out of the car  is brilliant as well as his scene in the restaurant with the hooker!  Recommend this to anyone.  I have watched this movie at least 20 times!  Just brilliant,937008000,,372,4.411764705882353
889509,5,6304437234,Arthur is a wonderful ride through a poor little rich man's life.  He's forced to into love only to find true love all by himself. My favorite part of the movie is when Arthur goes searching for Linda and winds up getting  into a fight with her neighbor.,930268800,,254,4.270833333333333

7872277,5,6304437234,This is the TRUE CLASSIC.. Forget Russel Brand...  This is one of Moore's best films.. It is about a rich man being forced into a relationship with a woman he does not love.. But when he is told that his money will be cut off if he and Susan do not wed.... One of the fondest memories of childhood comes back in this classic... Hobson was my favorite as he was more of a dad to Arthur then the person's real dad... This movie will make you laugh and cry... The newer version will NEVER be as good as this one... Arthur is one that never gets old...,1517875200,,548,4.074074074074074
