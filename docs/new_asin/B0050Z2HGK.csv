8452055,4,B0050Z2HGK,This western is one that I always have been fond of since I was a teenager.  It is a typical Gary Cooper movie with plenty of action and also a typical De Mill movie.  It is a good old western with plenty of twists.,1420761600,,215,3.8636363636363638
8452056,1,B0050Z2HGK,"This was billed as a new product by the vendor that sold it to me, yet when I received it, it was in an unwrapped (shrink wrap) case with a poorly designed cover. It turned out that this movie had been copied from the AMC channel (had the logo that poped up halfway through the movie) and that it was NOT an original version, which is what I expected. This vendor should not be allowed to even be selling anything on AMAZON and should be investigated for Pirating movies!",1391731200,3,471,4.303370786516854

8452058,3,B0050Z2HGK,"Great movie, I have wanted it for some time.  Obviously a copy as is the case it came in, but the copy was still better than my old VHS tape of the movie.  The other problem is they obviously shipped this from California to Texas via a combination of Pony Express and Overland stage.  It does not take 2 weeks for any kind of mail to travel this distance.  Also, I was dismayed when I saw  the menu.  It was identical to a movie I bought from another west coast distributor that had terrible quality and that I water found out was duped off of a tv copy in China.  Don't know if this is the case but I won't be dealing with these folks again.",1367280000,,642,4.0476190476190474

8452062,5,B0050Z2HGK,"This was a movie I recall seeing in the theatre most likely as a re-release following its original 1940 showing. Gary Cooper plays a Texas Ranger (named ""Dusty"" Rivers) in Canada on the track of a man, Jacques Corbeau, who killed in Texas and fled North. Preston Foster (as Sgt. Jim Brett) and Robert Preston (play Mounties). Paulette Goddard appears as Corbeau's daughter. Madeleine Carroll, as April Logan, is a nurse and the sister of Robert Preston.

Corbeau is in Canada not only to escape Rivers. He intends to lead the Metis (French-Indian) in a rebellion and establish a separate state. He has acquired a Gatling gun in this aim and attempts to persuade the Indians to join in the rebellion. A demonstration of the gun's firepower leads the Chief to agree to join Corbeau if he can bring the red coats of the Mounties back covered with their blood as Corbeau boasted. This sets the stage for an ambush of the Mounties and the ensuing action.

The love interest in the movie gets somewhat complicated. Both Jim and Dusty are after April. Logan is madly in love with Corbeau's daughter. She tricks him into leaving his outpost. A ploy that aids in the ambush of the Mounties column.

There are a few twists in the plot before the ""good guys"" win. I won't reveal either the twists or who wins April.

I highly recommend this movie.",1313280000,2,1336,4.624472573839663
