372023,4,6301810678,"Released in 1982 and directed by Andrew V. McLaglen, ""The Blue and the Gray"" covers the Civil War era from 1859-1865 focusing on two related families: The Geysers, farmers from Charlottesville, Virginia, and the Hales from Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, who own a newspaper. John Geyser (John Hammond) leaves Virginia to get a job as a sketch artist at the Hales newspaper in Gettysburg. When war breaks out after the Southern states secede from the Union, John covers the war for Harpers Weekly.

MAIN CAST includes Stacy Keach as a Pinkerton-turned-Union-officer who romances Johns cousin (Julia Duffy); Gregory Peck as Lincoln; Kathleen Beller as an aristocrat-turned-nurse; Dan Shor & Michael Horton as Johns brother; Rip Torn as General Grant; and Lloyd Bridges & Colleen Dewhurst as Mr. and Mrs. Geyser. These are just the principle characters; there are scores of others (Robert Vaughn, Geraldine Page, Warren Oates, Robert Symonds, etc.).

I prefer The Blue and the Gray to the similar North and South (Books I & II, 1985-86) because its more streamlined and less soap opera-y. Director McLaglen had decades of experience by this this time with both TV shows and films, including a few notable Westerns, like Bandolero! (1968) and Chisum (1970); in fact, his Shenandoah (1965) was a Civil War Western.

The first half is great, but the second half flounders a bit and includes some cheesy plot gimmicks, like the mad slasher Confederate officer and John mistaking his babe (the nurse) supposedly making out with the Union stud (Keach). The floundering includes some abrupt shifts, like from the Battle of Vicksburg (July, 1863) to the Battle of the Wilderness (May, 1864), which can likely be explained by cuts from the original mini-series. If you watch the longer version you probably won't encounter this problem.

What I like best about this miniseries (i.e. long movie) is that, despite some elements of TV-production cheese (e.g. the two Union & Confederate deserters almost goofy meeting in the woods), the film takes you back in time to the Civil War era and provides a quality picture of what it was like.

Some of the notable events covered include: The Battle of Bull Run, Army camp life, dysentery in the camps, cowards in battle and the branding thereof, balloon reconnaissance, fraternizing with the enemy after hours, brother vs. brother, the Gettysburg Address, the siege of Vicksburg and the desperation thereof (e.g. the Caves), prisoner-of-war camps (Elmira), Lees surrender and Lincolns death. Yes, some key events are off-screen (e.g. the Battle of Gettysburg and Lincoln getting shot), but thats the nature of the beast with a TV-budget and an overview-styled story. Lastly, Keach shines as one of the main protagonists, easily one of his best rolls, and Duffy is a delight.

The film runs 296 minutes (4 minutes shy of 5 hours), with the original 3-part miniseries running 381 minutes. It was shot entirely in Arkansas (Fort Smith, Eureka Springs, Fayetteville, Van Buren & Prairie Grove Battlefield State Park). The script was written by John Leekley & Ian McLellan Hunter based on Bruce Cattons material.

372142,3,6301810678,"While remembered fondly, the production and performances suffer on fresh viewing.

What is sort of amazing is just how clearly the South is portrayed (correctly) as the villain.  This is not romanticized Gone with the Wind, noble cause, etc., etc., apologist stuff.

372296,5,6301810678,"Wanted to say... This is one of my favorite movies. Unfortunately, the dvd ""remastered release, as everybody is complaining is about 78 minutes shorter than the vhs original release. Having listened to all of the complaints, the vhs which has been hard to get for some time.... Suddenly... Is everywhere on the internet! They have a dozen or more on ebay.... Plenty here on Amazon too.... Well, You probably know the old saying, if its too good to be it probably is? ? Well.... I warn you fine people.... I believe these VHS sets to be defective. I purchased a copy here on Amazon. Watched it for four and a half hours. Put the third vhs in the player, and... nothing... The entire third tape was BLANK! This has only happened to me one time before. When i had purchased, for a far too reasonable price, a copy of the movie Longitude. On that set... The second tape was either defective... Or... If you were one of the lucky few, you happened to get two of the SAME episodes (two part ones in the same box). At the time, Everyone returned them to either Sam's club or the Barnes and Nobles in our area where they had been sold. Unfortunately, all of these VHS tapes are sets, apparently defective, originating from either 1994 or 1999... And cannot be returned to any store. Thes best we can do now, is to warn the rest of you to buy at your own risk. And be prepared to file a complant. Ask yourself this (those of you who might not believe me), how is it possible, an otherwise rare copy of the VHS is suddenly available (BRAND NEW IN THE BOXES), from the nineteen nineties...? And Everywhere on the internet sooooooo suddenly.... Coincidence? Probably not. The sellers know people who still own vhs machines are worried that they'll never be able to get movies for those machines anymore as they don't even make them... And they also see people complaining about how the dvd version of this movie is the extremelly cut copy available now.... And bam... Your screwed.... I only hope you.... As i did in this case... Purchased the item from a reputable dealer on Amazon whom made up for this. I got lucky this time... Do you think you will be lucky too? If so.... Buy a copy....

372516,4,6301810678,"Fortunately ries, The Blue and the Gray seemed a bit ""too fun"".  Now, while I expect that much from television, and this was a television miniseries of the 80s, was is anything far from fun.

As television, this was enjoyable, if not predictable.  First, we already know the outcome of the war.  We know the tragedies on both sides and the horrors committed by both.  Even so, the story line of the separation of brothers fighting brothers is something the country has fortunately never forgotten.  The acting is very much as one would expect from the Walton's, to which this production seems to favor.

Blue and the Gray has shown things in equal eyes from the north and the south.  With ""John, War Correspondent of Harper's Weekly,"" showing the war and battles as an independent set of eyes, things seem to be fairly neutral.

All in all, while hokey as all get out, The Blue and the Gray is fairly enjoyable to watch.",1433635200,,920,4.595092024539877

372986,1,6301810678,"I am a longtime hardcore fan of all types of movies and TV mini-series type productions that are related to the Civil War.
But after only watching the first of the three DVD set for ""The Blue and the Gray"" former TV mini-series, it is so bad or amateurishly done, poorly acted, and downright corny at times, that for the first time ever I just may not be able to finish watching the rest of it!
Just one of way too many things to list here on why ""The Blue and the Gray"" was not well done is that action depicting the Battle of 1st. Manassas (or 1st. Bull Run) was filmed at some location in the winter time and when the leaves were off the trees!
 And of course any person who knows Civil war history is aware that the Battle of 1st. Manassas was fought during the summer of 1861 on July 21st.
I also own on DVD the TV mini series ""North and South"", and that production is 100% better and by far much more well done then ""The Blue and the Gray""!",1364947200,5,946,4.086021505376344

AFTER HAVING RECENTLY WATCHED NORTH AND SOUTH, THIS WAS A MAJOR LETDOWN.  THE PLOT WAS SERIOUSLY IN NEED OF STRENGTHENING, STACY KEACH WAS WRONG FOR THE LEAD AND OVERACTED THROUGHOUT THE MOVIE.  ALL IN ALL, WHILE I'M NOT SORRY I PURCHASED IT, I AM SORELY DISAPPOINTED IN IT AS A WHOLE.",1364342400,,401,4.4520547945205475
372988,5,6301810678,"This is SO well done about a family split due to location and allegiance to North or South.
The main character is based on Brady who was an actual artist in battles who reported the battles and met everyone who was anyone in the four year struggle. You will learn many interesting facts...this isn't a push 'em up low cut story
that incidentally mentions the Civil War..it is several hours but you will feel what happened. It is very well done.
You will be happy you watched...happier to own!",1363824000,,492,4.53932584269663

373061,4,6301810678,I thought this mini series was good.  It was entertaining and did provide some good info about the war.  I however think the series North and South is much better.,1362700800,,163,4.4
373062,4,6301810678,Like Stacy Keach. Good Acting through out the series. Stacy Keach can make anyone believe that he is a clairvoyant union officer hunting down a mentally deranged confederate officer portrayed by Warren Oates. It branches  out and gets into the split in the family of a young journalist who goes north and leaves behind his southern family. It's a greatstory.,1361232000,,358,4.966666666666667

As far as for the movies stars in the that is great.
I do not like the TV SHOWS all together in a weak box set that comes in cardboard and you have to touch the dvd which you should never do
I only gave it 4 stars for the movie stars in this not for the Box set
This is why i tell people if you can get each show you like no matter what it is and get is separate not all together in a box set",1360108800,,536,3.3658536585365852

And then they showed Lincoln giveing his Infamouse speech right afterward the battle. He didn't give his speech until November. Another thing that was wrong was the fall of Vicksburge. The city was surrendered on the 4th of July 1863 the day after Gettysburge. Last but not least as with all movies about the war they failed to mention the true causes of the war which were political coruption in the north andthe fact that Lincoln was a SOCIALIST.",1359676800,2,626,4.648648648648648

The only problem we had was on the third disc it hung up mid way but finally got going again.  The sound was lost so we had to pause and then the sound came back.  We just backed it up to where the mess up was and it was fine.  The movie itself was enjoyable and concentrated more on the personal aspects of the war instead of on so much fighting.  There are some battle scenes, but that is not the major content of the movie.  Anyone who is a Civil War fan should enjoy watching this.",1359676800,2,614,3.864

373163,5,6301810678,"It might be because this was the first big Civil War movie I ever saw, in 1982 and I was 9 years old and 100% geeked out.  My dad taped the originally aired CBS mini-series onto one VHS tape (6 hour speed!) and I literally wore the tape out watching this over and over and over.  I still have the tape after 30 years and even though this movie holds great memories for me - the casting is GREAT, better than ""North & South"" a few years later and the look, tone, way it was shot, and overall ""Feel"" of this TV movie is wonderful and honestly feels more authentic to me than anything else done on the Civil War, covering this much of the war.  ""N&S"" in 1986 was way too cheesy and glossy and overly colorful (more eye make up!) for my taste, but something about this feel more primal, dirty, sepia, 19th century.  I don't know what, but I love the movie.  I also like the fact that it's not based on a book and hamstrung... it's an original story and screenplay based on actual people and events and accounts.  A much smarter way to go and the way this movie covers all parts of the war is very cool.  Uniforms might not super uber-authentic, but who cares when it FEELs right?",1329264000,,1175,4.195555555555556
373164,3,6301810678,"Long ago there were 2 mini-series that tried to look at the human aspect of the Civil war.  This story which centered around the eldest son of a family of Virginia farmers and what he sees as a ""artist/correspondent"" who is pledged to avoid fighting while following the armies in the field.  And the bigger ""North and South.""

Strangely I think this one had more heart.  It's a smaller series in that it doesn't try to cover as much ground and it keeps largely to 2 main characters.  John, the artist and his Union scout friend Jonas (played by Stacy Keach)  They are often following John's two cousins who join a union regiment and fight at Bull Run and later in the Wilderness.

The characters are well developed, even the ones who only have a few moments of screen time and the series tries to avoid having a too romantic feel.  War back then was brutal and this series doesn't try to hide the cost.

Still its fun to watch.  Well acted, well written and still viewable after 20 years.",1323302400,,988,4.438888888888889
373165,5,6301810678,"I am a long time fan of this miniseries, having seen it on tv when it first aired, then owning it on VHS, then purchasing it on DVD.  I wasn't aware the DVD I had was so severely edited until I purchased this one.  I cannot believe the difference.  The edited version leaves several holes in the storyline that leave the viewer wondering what's going on.  Editing for time constraints is one thing, but to chop up a miniseries so that important scenes are deleted is ridiculous.  For example, John Geyser has a scene with John Brown before his hanging.  In the edited version, you never see the scene, but hear about it later.  Now the scene with John explaining that conversation to his cousins makes a lot of more sense...obviously.

Anyone who is a fan of this miniseries should definitely purchase this version instead of the other one.  If the other version can't even get their cover right (one photo says Colleen Dewhurst, but that's definitely not her in the picture), that indicates the production company didn't pay much attention to detail, and that carries over to the film itself.",1321833600,6,1093,4.680628272251309

It begins around 1859, and the hanging of John Brown is included in one of the first episodes. From there it goes on to all the known battles through to the murder of Abraham Lincoln. All in all it is pretty good, and the uniforms and equipment of the soldiers seems fairly accurate. With one exception: The collars of the private soldiers' sackcoats are to wide.",1316390400,,495,4.11340206185567

The young actors sometimes fail to perform much at all.  The reenactors are obviously there and it is good due to that as it shows reenacting and not a genuine CW experience.  The newer Gods and Generals and Gettysburg are well done in comparison to this even more dated film.

The renactments look like they were performed in a barn with scenery and the re-enactors are limited in numbers.  Bullrun looks like a barn dance with guns as brigades are represented by about 10 guys.  Some of the cannon look simply silly supported by a ""regiment"" that has about twice as many men as the gun crew of the obviously phony cannon with small charges and little or no recoil.

373212,5,6301810678,"I came to this miniseries after being a fan of other, later Civil-War dramas produced for TV, North & South and Gettysburg. With respect, my experience of The Blue & the Gray is rather opposite to that of Amazon's reviewer: the battle-scenes, next to those of the more technically advanced films, Gettysburg in particular, seem rather underpowered (although accurate and representative of what happened); while the personal and historical dramas are authentic and compelling. Even that line of dialogue about ""sacred soil""--far from being hackneyed--perfectly fits the dramatic and emotional situation in which it occurs. I think the Civil War has been very fortunate in the depictions it's received on film. The Blue & the Gray, despite its modest means or perhaps because of them, is especially good at capturing what mattered to the people of that era, and at showing what happened to them. For that reason, it does seem to me to be the freshest, the most eternally young, of Civil-War movies.

Gregory Peck as Lincoln and Stacey Keech as Jonas are the highlights. The production value is pretty good for the time it was made. The only problem I have is that there are no extra features and the packaging is a little weak in the fact that all the DVD's (there are 3 disks that are placed on top of each other instead of having their own slots).

373259,4,6301810678,"In November 1982 CBS broadcasted a miniseries which dealt with the lives of two families--the Geysers in Virginia and the Hales in Gettysburg connected by the marriage of two sisters.  The story follows the fortunes and misfortunes of the brothers, sisters and cousins during the war.

It has an outstanding cast--Stacy Keach as the dark and mysterious Jonas Steele; Lloyd Bridges as the family patriarch Ben Geyser; Warren Oates as the sadist and somewhat mad Major Welles; Rip Thorn as the unassuming Ulysses Grant; Colleen Dewhurst as devoted mother Maggie Geyser who would suffer the most lost during the war; Rory Calhoun as George Meade the aging warrior; Robert Vaughn as Senator Reynolds who wanted to make sure that his beautiful daughter Kathy played by Kathleen Beller would marry in her class and to keep her away from that newspaper  man John Geyser played with such charm and passion by John Hammond.

Gregory Peck delivered one of his best performances as Abraham Lincoln.  You believe in watching him that this was the President.

Paul Winfield as Jonathan Henry a freedman living on the Geyer Farm gives a brilliant performance.  What happens to him is a historical reality of the times.

The love story between Jonas Steele and Mary Hale, beautifully played by Julia Duffy, is brilliantly written and acted.  Like all great love stories there are joys and sorrows.

One has to comment on Sergeant O'Toole.  Gerald S. O'Loughlin gave a stellar performance as the hard as nails sergeant who had a caring heart for his men.

Don't watch this min-series for historical, tactical details of the battles.  It is character driven.  You have all of the stories-a nation torn apart, romance, fear, bravery, hope, dreams shattered, death of friends, family and enemies, human misery, and psychological trauma.

The Wilderness battle in the last part is truly a depiction that war is hell.  Misery, suffering, and death take it toil on the characters.

This series was nominated for four Emmy awards; won the American Cinema Editors award for part one; and the People's Choice Award for the best mini-series.",1281139200,2,2115,5.01432664756447
373260,4,6301810678,"""The Blue and the Gray"" was among the first attempts to dramatize the events of the American Civil War in an epic miniseries, preceding ""North & South"" by about three years. Told primarily through the eyes of a Newspaper Artist, the story deals with all the issues of the war, such as slavery and states' rights, while presenting a good-though-fictional story framed within the four years of the war. While it tends to be melodramatic at times, and there are a few slow passages, the fine storytelling, inspired performances and terrific battle sequences make up for the film's weak points. Overall, this is a fine Civil War drama.

373319,4,6301810678,"I first saw this when it aired on TV. Once a VHS copy was available, I bought it. We've worn it out. Spotting it in DVD forum, I snatched it up. A good, solid movie/miniseries without a lot of flash, TB&TG has a fine cast to portray both sides of the Civil War and how two intertwined families cope with their feelings and duties through the war years. Linked by two married sisters, one in VA, the other in PA, TB&TG shows not all Southerners and Northerners were rabid for war.
Stacy Keach, Lloyd Bridges [terrible Southern accent!], Colleen Dewhurst, John Hammond and Gregory Peck [as Lincoln] anchor the cast with a number of cameos by established actors and up-and-comers [Robert Vaughn, Sterling Hayden as John Brown, Paul Winfield, Warren Oates, Rip Torn and Julia Duffy - to name a few].
The only jarring note in the script was the ESP factor, supposedly coming from Keach. In the 1860s, I doubt if something like that was as freely discussed and described as ""ESP"". I don't think this particular science was that widely accepted. Most likely, he would have been ""locked up as a loon"" rather than have his dreams being taken seriously.
BUT that was the only quirk I found in the entire series - other than some off-note southern accents. We've lived in the South for over 18 years, and I've NEVER HEARD some of the accents that were in this show. This is a good DVD for a rainy/snowy Saturday to curl up and watch while sipping on some homemade soup and a sandwich. There is a bit of everything in here for the whole family: some romance, some war violence [not as graphic as ""Saving Private Ryan""] and some history that could spark discussions and further interest by all. It's not as flashy as ""The North & the South"", but it'll do.",1261008000,3,1742,4.533333333333333
373320,3,6301810678,"I bought a used copy of the ""Recut"" version, having never seen the original miniseries.  I presumed the recut version would be an improvement on the original, as I remember some of the miniseries made back then tended to be much longer than they needed to be.

Even though I did get a sense of scenes missing, I thought the production was OK overall.  However, I didn't find it as compelling as I was hoping.  I think part of the problem was the lead, played by John Hammond, who throughout came across as too ""soft"" to be convincing as someone who witnesses both the horrors of war and the death of family members.  Hammond's limitations as an actor make it seem as if his character's persona remains unchanged.  As a result when he arms himself at the end to defend his home, the result is more comical than dramatic.  Having his father playing by Lloyd Bridges (who would later go on to co-star in ""Airplane!"") didn't help in that regard.

There are also a number of little details throughout that sort of throw the film off from time to time.  Someone earlier mentioned the nightmare/vision that Stacy Keach (who's especially good) has of Lincoln's death.  There are other distractions.  Here is just one example of many: Lincoln's Gettysberg Address, with Gregory Peck as Lincoln, is given without Lincoln even remotely projecting his voice.  It's as if he's having a normal conversational with a group of people standing around him in a living room rather than being of in front of a huge outdoor crowd.  When the crowd erupts into applause at the end, I wondered what they were clapping for since almost no one would have heard him.  It's a pivotal moment in history as well as in the film, and it should have been filmed in a more powerful and persuasive way.  (Too often, television back then had a way of flattening out the highs and lows of dramatic situations.)

Nonetheless, the movie manages to be more effective than not, even in this recut version.  Most of the cast is pretty good, including when they're reduced to saying corny lines of dialogue.

One comical goof on the DVD box: Diane Baker is identified as Colleen Dewhurst.",1250985600,3,2145,4.644562334217507

373324,5,6301810678,"I first saw the complete miniseries in stores in 2001 when the set came out. The thing that really caught my intrest about it was the fact that it was based on the works of Bruce Catton. This had me returning to look at it, trying to decide if I wanted to spend the money (and believe me, I didn't really have enough money to spend on myself for what this cost at that time). Well, things got settled for me when I ended up getting it for Christmas from my folks.

Now I don't remember seeing the miniseries when it originally aired in 1982. At the time the first part originally aired I was just over a month from my 8th birthday. Though watching it my folks began to remember seeing it back in '82 and suggested maybe I might have seen bits and pieces or maybe it came on after I went to bed. Either way, after getting the DVD set none of that mattered as now I can watch it whenever I please.

Years later I was in my local Borders and in their advirtisement flyer they announced ""The Blue and the Gray - Recut."" I was excited, wondering what had been left out on the original DVD. That is I was excited until I saw the run time. Something was wrong, it looked too short compared to what I had at home. Was I wrong and it actually was longer? I mean it had been a while since I'd watched things, maybe I was imagining the set at home was longer. But when I checked I came away with 381 minutes versus 296 minutes. Recut? I'm guessing that must mean either editted for folks with a short attention span or the folks at Sony figured no one would have seen the earlier DVD and were counting on over twenty years from the original airing for memories to fade.

There is no way I'd advise anyone to purchase the Recut version as it cheats you out of 85 minutes. Sure, you probably don't get the recap of what's already happened and there's probably only one set of opening and closing credits. But figure all told that eliminates twenty to twenty-six minutes tops. That still leaves plenty cut out. Which you get with the Complete Miniseries set.

The story itself centers around two characters Jonas Steele (Stacy Keach) and John Geyser (John Hammond IV), son of a Virginia farmer. It begins just after John Brown's Raid on Harper's Ferry, as evidenced by a discussion between John and his friend Jonathan, a free black man who lives in a cabin on the Geyser Farm who runs his own pottery buisness. One of four boys in the Geyser family, John is the least intrested in farm work, instead being an artist. This results in his folks allowing him to travel north to Gettysburg where his uncle, his mother's sister's husband, runs the local paper. There John gets his first job as a sketch artist and his first assignment is to attend the trial of John Brown.

It is at the trial that John first meets Jonas Steele, a Pinkerton Detective who earlier in his life used to ride with John Brown. Because of his current life Jonas wants to keep things a bit hush hush as certain individuals wouldn't understand. Seeing John sketch in during the trial he confronts him at a local tavern, explaining how his sketch could ruin his life. Being the understanding sort, John quickly alters the image of Jonas so no one can recgonize him, thus beginning a friendship between the two. After the trial the two travel back to Gettysburg where Jonas is introduced to the Hales, John's uncle and aunt's family. Jonas falls for their eldest daughter, eventually marrying her.

Christmas of 1860 John returns home for the holiday. The talk is of secession, which leads John's sister and her fiancee to get married right then and there as he knows his home state of Mississippi will undoubtedly soon follow suit. During the party the local sheriff and some runaway slave hunters show up. Turns out Jonathan has been harboring a couple of runaways in his cabin. The runaways are taken back, but because Jonathan's a free man he's hanged as his life is supposedly worthless. This leads John to denounce his home and swear he won't fight for the South.

However, John also can't fight for the North either as he can't risk the possibility of firing on any of his brothers, all of whom sign up to fight for the South as do all three of his male Hale cousins. It is thanks to a chance encounter with the newly inagurated Lincoln that John get's his answer to his quandry. Even when he first went to work for his uncle he admitted that he wanted to some day work for a major paper such as Harper's Weekly. Lincoln convinces him the best course of action for someone who can't fight for either side is to become a war correspondent, which results in his getting a job with Harper's.

Jonas, meanwhile, had served as a bodyguard to Lincoln and becomes a scout in the Union Army. His first duty as a scout is during the Battle of First Bull Run (Manassas). As the war progresses he finds himself working for each successive commander of the Army of the Potomac. Sadly, the war transforms Jonas a little in Mary, his wife, is killed during the Battle of Gettysburg. He becomes filled with hate because of it, something he later tells John is what keeps him going. Despite this, Jonas is able to keep doing his job and doing it well. He also cronfronts the very man, now a Confederate Major, who had Jonathan killed.

The Blue and the Gray was the kind of TV miniseries one might have expected in the '80s. Which is to say it was filled with an ensemble cast of some well known stars from the time including Gregory Peck, Rip Torn, Lloyd Bridges, Robert Vaughn, and Julia Duffy. The story itself provides hours of entertainment as it touches on various elements of the war. Some well known such as First Bull Run (Manassas) and Gettysburg. Some lesser known such as the Confederacy's observation ballon made out of womens dresses and folks in Vicksburg having to live off horse and mule meat during the Siege of Vicksburg. In addition to these the miniseires has it's light-hearted moments, such as John's youngest brother sneaking him and their two surviving cousins in the Union army into a barn dance on the Virginia penisula during the fighting or when John and Jonas bet on whether or not John can successfully miss a shot at a Prussian officer when the two duel (John's shot probably causes the guy to wet his pants but he did win the bet).

Is it worth spending more money to get the Complete Miniseries over the Recut version of ""The Blue and the Gray?"" Well, $7 to $8 gets you another 85 minutes. But more than that, it ensures you see the full miniseries. No scenes are missing so you don't have to ask what you're missing out on.

Also, a Little Rock TV reporter, Chuck Dovish, played the part of the injured soldier that John Geyser's girlfriend helped at Bull Run.  He the one who says ""God bless you, miss.""

Both happened at the same time in July of 1863.  And, Lincoln didn't give his famous speech until later on in the Fall.  He gave the speech months after Vicksburg had fallen.  And, true, the hairstyles were very early '80's on many of the soldiers.  They didn't spend as much time and money on facial hair as they did on Gettysburg years later.

The costumes were great- although I too noticed that the hair styles were often modern. I'm a descendent of 20 Civil War soldiers (both sides)-so I have a particular interest in the period. Of course, I loved the miltary scenes- which were done well. The historical sequences were not always accurate- but that was okay too. The series was loaded with stars- many of whom are now passed away. Gregory Peck was great as Lincoln. However, I have to say that I thought some of the acting of others seemed sub par. At times, I felt like I was watching a high school play. There were too many predictable elements as well- you just knew that Julia Duffy's character was going to die.

  the uncle sends john to cover the trial of john brown, the first of many historical figuers john will meet,and there he meets jonas steele(stacy keach,who is very good in the role) and they become fast friends.

373397,4,6301810678,"I see from other reviews people upset by the fact that this does not have documentary-style factual accuracy. That is true. However, it has a great deal of emotional accuracy. I saw this as a child and for the first time, I began to understand that the Civil War wasn't just about the Union vs. the Confederacy or the war over slavery. There were real people in those uniforms, and this miniseries very effectively conveys their pain and desperation, but also includes their occasional joys and celebrations.  It's a good intro simply because it eases one into the Civil War and thereby engages interest. If you want to learn more, you can.  Also, the violence is portrayed in a way that still gets the horrors across without being horribly graphic, which is good for younger viewers.

And even though there are inaccuracies, they do not in my opinion distract from the storyline and are not glaring unless you have specialized Civil War knowledge. Why pop a vein over the fact that a uniform doesn't have the right number of buttons on it or something? If they allow Mary Todd Lincoln to arrive with her husband instead of a couple hours later in order to show them together, is that really so horrifying? What's the other option, showing a scene of her coming up later, Lincoln explaining the situation as Geyser waits around for her, then finally drawing a picture of them together? That kind of thing slows a show's pace down to a crawl. The same is true for the expecations that every battle sequence should be long and elaborate. They do only have six hours. But if that kind of thing is all you're concerned about, then it's true you won't like this film.  If you're looking for an interesting tale of the Civil War, though, this does the trick.

Consider - how accurate is Gone With the Wind?  How realistic is it? Yet it's considered a classic. And Scarlett even has (gasp) psychic dreams!  (Remember the recurring dream where she's running through the fog searching that foretells her doing so at the end when she runs to Rhett?) I'm not saying this is Gone With the Wind; however, it is obvious that one can't judge the quality of a film soley on rigid standards of realism.

The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because there is a bit of overacting and cheesy dialogue at times. After all, it IS a miniseries.  But as I said before, it's entertaining and a good way to engage interest in the Civil War, especially in a younger person.",1143158400,10,2452,4.567198177676538

Gregory Peck does his usual stellar job as Abraham Lincoln and really becomes the man.  Stacy Keach and the rest of the cast also turn in decent performances.

373519,4,6301810678,"My parents got me this movie when I was a kid and I must agree with another reviewer in that it opened my eyes to the uglier side of war from starvation to POW camps to the psychological effects of war.

I don't like the way people like to compare it to other Civil War films. It's truely nothing like Gettysburg at all. It follows the main character who chooses not to fight for the South and pursues a career as a newspaper illustrater for Northern Newspapers.

Someone pointed out that Vicksburg happened After Gettysburg. Not really. Vicksburg Surrendered July 4th, 1863. Gettysburg was the 3 days before. Keep in mind, the movie doesnt actually portray the battle of Gettysburg. What you see after Vicksburg falling is only the corpse strewn battlefield and a cavalry skirmish which I took it was after the battle.

And I never got the feeling the main character teleported anywhere. He started in Virginia, moved around that theater of operations then went to Vicksburg which was besieged.

Bull Run was as good as the action of the movie got. There could have been more but I think they made the best of the ammount that they put in. It did a very good job at portraying different areas of the war.

Some people say they wanted an action movie, other people wanted some strict steriotypical portrayal of the life of your typical people at the time. No The Blue and the Gray just portrays 2 families related, focusing on a few characters and the many different problems. Really, so what if one character was psychic and others don't follow the rules of the time. It cant be a history lesson in every area. It does a very good job to portray the characters as humans and show the situations they were in. If you want a history lesson, you should get that PBS documentary on the Civil War. I'd recommend this movie for kids. Maybe if I watched it for the first time at my age I would not like it too much. But it could do a lot for a kid, I believe this movie played the critical role at turning me into a Civil War buff.

Gregory peck should be ashamed, though he did a splendid job of acting the script was un-believable. Stacy keach did a great job of acting. The Geyser family did not make you feel like they were a real family. This really took away from the reality of the whole mess. Again, I watched it. I will never watch it again so Im going to sell this. I made the mistake of watching Maxwells  Gettysburg and God and Generals. Those were the BEST EVER MADE SO FAR!

373521,4,6301810678,"Once upon a time in a place far, far away, I was a Civil War buff. I couldn't read enough books about the massive war between the North and the South from 1861 to 1865. I paged through texts about ironclads, reveled in the descriptions of Shiloh, Bull Run, and Cold Harbor. I studied pictures of the movements of troops led by George McClellan and Ulysses S. Grant, Stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee. I thrilled to the drama of Lee's surrender to Grant at Appomattox Courthouse. And I mourned as Abraham Lincoln fell to a southern assassin's bullet at Ford's Theater. I would read books by Bruce Catton, a sort of everyman's historian of the war who churned out books by the boatload twenty or thirty years ago. Moreover, and probably most importantly, I yearned to watch shows and movies based on events during the war. I remember being presently surprised at the time to learn that a huge mini-series, called ""The Blue and the Gray,"" would soon air on television. Finally, I would see the events, people, and places I had only read about before. Yep, I vividly remember watching this series when it first premiered on television over twenty years ago. And I liked it, at the time. When I saw it coming out on DVD, I decided to watch it all over again.
The passing of years can definitely modify prior assumptions. While I found parts of ""The Blue and the Gray"" intriguing, far too often the film descended into the deepest depths of sentimentality of the sappiest sort. The star of the picture is John Geyser (John Hammond), a young man with a knack for drawing who lives on his parents' farm in Virginia. He's got a bunch of brothers, a sister preparing to marry a successful businessman from Vicksburg, and several slaves. He yearns to head north, to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania where his Uncle Jacob runs a newspaper. John figures his relative will hire him on the spot once he shows the man his drawings. Geyser gets the job when his uncle assigns him to cover the John Brown trial and the abolitionist's subsequent execution. At the proceedings, John meets Jonas Steele (Stacy Keach), a shady character with ties to the Pinkerton Agency and to the White House. A fast friendship forms between the two, with an even faster bond emerging between Steele and John's cousin Mary Hale (Julia Duffy). John heads back to his Virginia farm just in time to witness a bunch of bounty hunters commit a heinous crime against Jonathan Henry (Paul Winfield) for harboring a fugitive slave. At one point, young Geyser even meets the newly elected Abraham Lincoln (Gregory Peck).
By the time the war breaks out, John Geyser's artwork covering the Brown trial lands him a job at Harper's as a war correspondent. It's just as well since John refuses to fight for the Union or the Confederacy, a position that alienates him from his pro-southern family. His anti-war views do not stop him from facing danger as he rescues the daughter of Senator Reynolds (Robert Vaughn), a girl named Kathy (Kathleen Beller), at the Battle of Bull Run. Predictably, John and Kathy become an item. So do Jonas Steele and Mary Hale when they tie the knot after Jonas joins the Union Army. We also learn Steele possesses an annoying psychic power that allows him to foresee disastrous events. Meanwhile, as Vicksburg falls to the North, John's sister loses her husband and nearly loses her child in the siege of that city. As the war grinds on and on with no end in sight, members of both branches of the family, Hale and Geyser, fall on the battlefield from bullet, disease, or both.
This rather slipshod summary will have to suffice for a series that runs nearly six hours. The filmmakers did a good job covering many of the important issues of the day. John's internal conflict over whether he should fight or not, and for what side, is one many Americans faced during that conflict. Battle sequences inevitably rely on budgetary restrictions, so the only lengthy combat sequence is the Battle of Bull Run. It seems the filmmakers wished to focus on things not widely known about the Civil War, such as the use of hot air balloons for aerial surveillance, a repeating carbine, and the horrible conditions of prisoner of war camps. The movie keeps violence to a minimum, as per television standards, but a viewer does get the sense that the Civil War was no walk in the park for both soldiers and civilians. What do not work as well are the inaccuracy of the uniforms, the occasional digressions into comedy and romance, and the tendency of characters to teleport themselves across the country. I realize the whole idea of the movie is to show the war through the eyes of one man, but it gets ridiculous after a time when you see John Geyser popping up everywhere from Vicksburg to Bull Run.
The cast roster is enormous. In addition to the actors listed above, you will see Sterling Hayden, Lloyd Bridges, Colleen Dewhurst, Rip Torn, Rory Calhoun, Warren Oates, and Geraldine Page filling roles both major and minor. Mr. Bentley from ""The Jeffersons"" even shows up for a minute or two! I think I can safely recommend this film to movie buffs. It's not perfect, not even close, but it would give a viewer a general idea of the issues that led to the war. You can't really hope to adequately inform through the medium of television, but what you can hope to do is get someone interested in reading more about a topic. ""The Blue and the Gray"" will do that, with a little luck.",1086825600,87,5442,4.658004158004158
373522,5,6301810678,"First off, yes there are a lot of problems with this as factual history.  This is not Gettysburg or Gods and General.  Don't think they ever set out for it to be.  This is for the person who wants more personalities, more emotions and less history.  So PLEASE do not judge this against the two movies based on the Shaaras' Books.  This whole intent of this was distinctive different and it achieves what it set out to do.
This is not for historians, this is for the people who have a little knowledge and interest in the Civil War - and likely that is all they want.
For someone looking for a more emotional view of the Civil War, with more 'people and feelings' than true history, then this is a very nice read. It is the fictionalised account of the Geyers and the Hales, cousins - one family of the South, the other from the North, that find themselves divided and fighting each other during the War Between the States in the US. The Geyers were farmers, of the land, though were not slave owners, and the story focuses around their eldest son, John, an artist who went into the war as an artist correspondent, torn by his love for both families and seeing both sides of the argument. He hates the institution of Slavery, a hatred amplified by the hanging of his black friend, a freed man for hiding fugitive slaves. The Hales were city-folk. Not only were they divided on their views, but by their styles of life. You see all the various scenes of how families were divided, how the glory of war could turn sour for the many boys simply looking for adventure.
There was a real John Geyser, and he did draw a lot of pictures as his time as a soldier. But he was not a war correspondent, and not that professional of an artists. Still is immature drawing carry a power to convey the horrors of war.
So take the 'history' with a grain of salt and enjoy the 'emotions' of the great conflict that ripped families and friends apart.
Stacey Keech is simply marvellous as Jonas Steel, and I defy anyone not to be moved by his and Julia Duffy's Mary performance as Mary, the woman Jonas loves and loves.  Duffy, best known for Designing Women and Bob Newheart, show a charming, heart-wrenching portrayal of sweet Mary.  Peck is super as Lincoln, in a roll he really wanted to play.
So pop the popcorn and sit back and enjoy the sweeping 'Gone With the Wind' Hollywood version of the Civil War.  There is fine acting and a lot of nice 'historical' touches since Bruce Catton was consultant to the film.
The DVD is the full length version.  Many video copies are a shortened version, so you you will be thrilled the see it in its intended form.",1045785600,150,2637,4.409465020576132
373523,1,6301810678,"This is not just a bad civil war movie - it is one of the worst movies ever made about anything.  It has no point, it makes no sense and it assumes the viewer is either brain dead or simply stupid.  Imagine - in the middle of this terrible war, a southern private gets a message to his cousin in the federal army to meet him that night for something important.  Two yankee soldiers and a correspondent (southerner's brother) meet the southern private, ride in his rowboat together to get to a barn dance behind southern lines - punch and girls and music to dance to.  Southern general catches them and is going to send the yankees away as POW's.  Southern private complains because he gave his word he'd see them back to their side of the river safely.  General relents because, as his private wonders, what's the point of the war if the southerner doesn't honor his word.  Then - he offers the southern private his choice of hard labor or joining the ""balloon corps.""
Awful, awful, awful.  Bruce Catton was either asleep, away or drunk when he gave permission to use his name on this piece of trash.  It's not just inaccurate - the only relationship to the civil war is the statement that's when it takes place - it is badly acted, badly conceived, badly staged and just plain stupid.",1039392000,14,1285,4.48068669527897
373524,4,6301810678,"I remember watching this miniseries when I was five years old. I was amazed by the whole thing. Being a little kid, I wanted to watch it for the cool looking battles, all the guns, swords, horses, and cannons. What I didn't know when I was watching it that it opened my eyes to a whole bunch of things I had never thought about before. For example, soldiers peeing there pants and running away in the thick of battle; innocent people being shot by straying gunfire; people who were so hungery that they would eat horse meat; the non-fighting hero taking up arms to defend his family and home; were all things that had never entered my mind before. The miniseries gave me a greater appreciation of the Civil War and a beginning understanding about the grimness of war in general.
Now, with that said I must admit that some of the acting is kind of lame and a lot of the dialogue is cheesy. However, keep in mind that this was a television miniseries made in the early 1980s. Computer special effects were non-existant and the film had to appeal to a huge audience of people over three different days. The whole prophetic gift of Major Steele is a bit farfetching, but other than that everything flows together fairly well. There are some fine acting performances and the battles aren't too shabby. A good film to introduce people to the Civil War.",1030838400,11,1346,4.54320987654321
373525,3,6301810678,"When watching this mini-series its best to keep in mind that it was made about twenty years ago and shown on television over several nights.  The over acting and the simplistic dialogue were probably a lot less cloying when spread out over many hours and interrupted by commercials.  This version of the Civil War leaves out most of the grime and blood and introduces a number of anachronisms and phoney sidetracks, among the most bizarre of which are the Stacy Keach character's numerous ""psychic episodes"" and the incident where one of the characters informs some slaves on a Mississippi plantation that they are free by letting them read the Emancipation Proclamation. (Any one care to bet how many slaves knew how to read in 1863?)
Having said this, I should also point out that there are some reasonable reenactments of battles, particularly First Bull Run.  You can also get a fairly good idea of the way families were torn apart by the war and the dilemma that conflicted loyalties caused many people.  I guess my favorite character is Malachi Hale, who joins the Union Army sure that he will be a great hero, then has to deal with his terror when he comes under fire.  He eventually makes friends with a similarly frightened Confederate and ends up with a battlefield promotion!  I don't know of many other scenes in war movies that point out the absurdity of the whole thing so successfully.",1030406400,12,1400,4.764462809917355
373596,4,6301810678,"This is a nice tv mini-series, and explains the Civil War and it's era pretty well. It's about a neutral Virginian farmboy/amateur artist (played by John Hammond) who leaves his home and family to work as a newspaper artist up north, eventually becoming a war artist for Harper's Weekly. Along the way, at the trial of John Brown, he befriends Stacy Keach's character, a U.S. army scout and good friend of Abe Lincoln named Jonas Steele. While his brothers fight for the Confederacy, his cousins fight for the Union, tearing their family in two.
It is, as other customers have said, a good introduction piece to the War Between the States. It tells the basics of the war and it's time period pretty well. However, it is not without it's errors: I don't know why there's the murder subplot....it's kind of odd, but still spooky. The love stories are a bit corny at times, but otherwise the story is interesting. The music score is VERY early eighties, but that's okay. The thing that made me want to laugh though is that each army seems to have about 50 people on each side, though the battle scenes are pretty good. The cavalry battles are great though! Oh well, if you want vast armies, watch Gettysburg (a GREAT Civil War movie), or something. Hammond and Keach give good performances, while the best is Gregory Peck's performance as Lincoln. He fits the part very well, and is quite believable. (but stay away from the overacting of sister Emma's overacting!) So, if the Civil War is your thing like it is mine, take a look at this. It's worth a watch!",1029542400,14,1555,4.617328519855596
373597,4,6301810678,"Everything can't be perfect.  Being 2002 it's easy to look back and be critical of filming in the early 80's.  As we see some 80's filming styles and approaches common of television come through.  This 3-DVD set is perfect for those who really don't have a general knowledge of the war.  The story follows historical timelines (most of the time) and also brings up key events to situations like John Brown's Raid, Bull Run, Vicksburg, Gettysburg,etc..  This movie includes common and popular situations that arose during the war such as an army trading coffee or tobacco with the enemy, or punishment procedures for being a coward, popular soldier and civilian life.  It is almost like the movie has taken the most popular things of the Civil War and created a 6 hour movie from it.
Sometimes I thought the acting and romance was a bit ""sappy"" for the movie but I realize that it is nearly 20 years old.  As far as actors I found Gregory Peck acting as Lincoln to be more believable than most of the characters in the story.  This movie isn't a Gettysburg though it isn't a flop.  It is a perfect movie for people learning about the Civil War. Blue and Gray explores the realities of families broken up by war and how people had to ask and find themselves when choosing to fight for the North or South.  It brings a well rounded view of the war and puts it together in a fine movie. I would recommend it for many ages as I think children learning about the Civil War can find great value in this movie.",1029196800,9,1502,4.4489051094890515

If you are able to get past the early 80's haircuts, uniforms which don't look quite right, Civil War battles that look they were fought by maybe 30 people, and painfull to watch overacting, then there is still the writing.  Stacy Keach's character for example, had dreams in which he predicts the future (you hear about them throughout the movie - somehow Keach is able to deliver his lines with a straight face).  Hard to believe someone wrote this movie on purpose, harder still to believe that someone thought it was a good idea.  Save your money and get Gettysburg instead, or make your own movie with sock puppets, which will still be much better than The Blue and the Gray.",1022025600,15,712,4.582677165354331

Most of us farbies don't know the difference anyways. This is a highly entertaining movie that I have watched several times. No, you are not getting an in depth treatment of any particular battle, but an overview of the entire war from John Browns hanging to Lincolns assaination. There are many memorable scenes like the use of hot air balloons to spy on the other side, the trading of supplies between the blue boys and the gray boys by using a toy sailboat, and Stacey Keach riding across the battlefield at Gettysburgh that is littered with hundreds of bodies as the Gettysburgh address is read by Gregory Peck's Lincoln. Speaking of which, Peck gives the best portrayal of Lincoln that I have ever seen. Worthwhile viewing and a personal favorite of mine.",1018051200,9,893,4.805194805194805
373601,2,6301810678,"This film did contain many correct historical facts as far as the war itself, and I did enjoy the quotes and terms that were used from that time era.  However, it was quite apparent that not enough research had been done as far as the appropriate dress and conduct of women (especially southern women) during the Civil War.  I have done quite a bit of research on this topic since I am a reenactor, and I portray a southern woman.  They were not ""bold and brazen"".  Southern women were sheltered and protected by their men--not out flaunting themselves, chasing men, and bragging on being ""bold"".  Low neck dresses were worn late in the evenings--not the middle of the day.  They did not pick up their skirts with both hands, high above their ankles (heaven fordid!), and run chasing a man on a train asking him to come visit.  Women were either escorted by a male relative, if not married, or some older woman.  They did not go out in public alone.  Also, one scene shows John Geyser running down the dirt street in Vicksburg--someone forgot to cover up the cement sidewalk with dirt!!  No cement sidewalks then!  All in all, the acting in this movie was something to be desired.  It seemed like most of the actors were just repeating memorized lines--not really living it.  The acting did not appear natural.  Abraham Lincoln's face looks like a monster. Mary Todd Lincoln did not accompany him on the train to Washington, D.C.  There was an asassination plot, and Lincoln went by himself traveling at night.  She followed later with her sons.  If you are looking for facts about the war battles, this will suffice.  However, if you are looking for information about everyday life and how it was lived during the Civil War, do not use this as a reference item.

Also, the use of historical acts and people is wonderful as well, even if the filmmakers took artistic liberties. The main battles and historical figures are depicted, from the Battle Of Gettysburg to the Assassination of Abraham Lincoln.
And the best part about this series is the plot doesn't deviate from the main characters and their heart-wrenching story.

I do agree w/ previous reviewers on many points (both pro and con)and feel a need to point out that the mid 80's wasn't the best time to find a thought-provoking or indepth made-for-TV movie. However, as you watch the movie, you become emotionally involved w/ this extended family and their struggles. As the carnage of war progresses in the movie, I challenge you to ignore the deeper messages regarding the heavy, heavy price payed by all (of Mother Earth's creatures) when we choose violence as a legitimate means of conflict resolution.",990489600,2,671,4.743589743589744
373649,5,6301810678,"Let me begin with a caveat. This movie is available in two versions. The full-length film (from the tv mini-series) and an abridged version. By all means, get the full length video. It's six hours long, but every scene in  the story is relevent.
The film itself chronicles historical events from  a year or two prior to actual hostilities, up to the end of the war and  Lincoln's assassination. The story is related from the viewpoints of two  families (related by marriage): The Geysers from Virginia, and the Hales  from Pennsylvania.
Events and happenings in the movie are generally (but  not always) seen via John Geyser's (John Hammond, IV) perspective. John is  the youngest son of a well-to-do, but not wealthy Virginia farmer who is  turned against Southern ideals by the death of a black friend. He seeks  solice and employment with his Uncle Hale's newspaper and moves to  Pennsylvania. However, John is not comfortable in the North either. He  cannot bring himself to join the military because of the possibility of  having to face his elder brothers in combat.
The story is a moving one  with several themes running through it. Brother against brother is one of  the stronger themes, but also present are the price of friendship, loyalty  to one's home, family and State, and responsibility. The issue of slavery  is minimized - and probably well so, as that was not a major issue in the  outset of the actual war in any event.
The cast is superbly chosen for  their parts, and play them with enthusiasm and credibility. All manner of  charactorizations are present from the young boy who thinks of the war as a  lark and adventure, to those who are committed due to home and family, and  those who believe the war will be short and can't wait to be a part of  history.
Especially well done are the parts of Lincoln (Gregory Peck) and  R.E. Lee (Robert Symonds). All charactors are believeable - moving the  audience to tears at times.
What's the bottom line?
Well, scene for  scene this may not be the most accurate depiction of the Civil War that can  be found, but it certainly captures the flavor. I was disappointed that  Gettyburg was so glossed over (but then there's an entire movie dedicated  to that battle itself under its own title), however everything else seems  to be there. The drama and acting are some of the best you'll find anywhere  -- and the story is compelling.
If you've any interest at all in what the  Civil War was about or how it impacted those living during the time, this  is the film to see. Two thumbs way up.

373652,2,6301810678,"I both agree and disagree with the existing reviews.  I too first viewed this film when I was in fifth grade and fell in love with its majestic epic.  Having re-viewed it, though, I have to state my misgivings. Although  it has a star-studded cast, the script is awful--it is compressed and  focuses upon melodrama rather than character development. My biggest  criticism of the film is its depiction of the Civil War.  The film uses the  familiar theme of brother against brother as the thrust of its narrative.  This of course was the power of D.W. Griffith's Birth of A Nation.  It  speaks to the post-Civil War sensibilities of a nation needing healing  after it's most violent and devastating war.  However, it downplays the  issue of slavery and emancipation, probably to avoid contraversy (It does a  pitiful job with abolitionism and the underground railroad in the  beginning. It feels like the filmmakers did this to throw a bone to its  Post-Civil Rights Movement audience).  At least Griffith recognized that  these were key issues of the war, despite his racist twist (Did the North  really want to thrust miscegination upon the defeated South?). The  filmmakers of The Blue and the Gray, in order to maintain the melodrama,  use similar themes as Griffith (probably because of its epic power), but do  not seek to extract the meaning of the conflict, which in my mind does a  dishonor to the men who fought (on both sides) and recognized what they  were fighting for.  This movies is pure sentiment. Like Gone With The Wind,  it wraps you up with the everyday life of its characters. Unlike that movie  though, it neglects to give you a sense of how people tried understand what  the war is about.  Gone With The Wind focuses upon a few characters, The  Blue and the Gray attempts to tell too many stories without much  resolution.  Although the series has its problems too, I suggest potential  viwers should see the Burns' Brothers The Civil War docudrama before  watching this.",948499200,3,1994,4.8017751479289945
373653,5,6301810678,"As a civil war buff, I rate this movie probably as one of the most accurate of all Civil War movies ever made. It has an excellent pedigree, based on a book by the legendary Civil War historian Bruce Catton. No  propaganda in this one - scenes such as when the soldiers threw away cards  before a battle in case they were killed, soldiers conversing and trading  along the lines with the enemy - all true and little known by most.  Most  soldiers were very scared during battle - even veterans, and many died of  disease before ever firing a shot - again, something dramatized effectively  in this movie. Many incidents in this movie were factual such as two enemy  soldiers stumbling on the other and deciding whoever wins the battle will  take hte other prisoner and Confederates inviting Union soldiers to a  party, interrupted by Confederate officers.  I encourage all that  enjoyed ths program to pick up a copy of Catton's ""Reflections on the  Civil War"" to understand just how historically accurate much of this  movie is.  The battle scenes in this movie are first rate without being  gory and of course are very realistic, a la ""Gettysburg"".  There is a longer version of this video that is even better than the  shortened one.  I encourage watching this one with kids studying this era  in school - it is highly educational and entertaining.",937612800,15,1351,4.6923076923076925
