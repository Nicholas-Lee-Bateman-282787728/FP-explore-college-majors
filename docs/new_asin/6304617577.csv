903187,4,6304617577,In this movie Mario Moreno plays police officer 777. The movie shows his battle with everyday crime and a group of thugs. It's quite funny but not as funny as some of his other films. The DVD is not done well in my opinion. The audio is horrible. You can still hear everything but it is not as clear as it should be. The picture is okay but they could have done a better job focusing it. There are no special features and no subtitles. The movie plays on its own. Hopefully people will start respecting cantinflas classics and make better DVDs.,1111536000,3,544,4.3431372549019605
903188,5,6304617577,"Mexican comedian Cantinflas is an incredibly youthful-looking 65 in this, his next-to-last movie. This is a comedy with a lot of heart and goodwill. The diminutive Cantinflas, playing a cop, can't pull a Dirty Harry on the preppy rich kids parking on the sidewalk, can't lasso a suicidal husband off a high ledge, but uses his wits and wit to resolve the problems. Naturally, he gets off his share of great one-liners and sight gags, too.
Not surprisingly (due to his age and build), the only scene that doesn't work is when he singlehandedly beats up four burly mafiosos. The main plot centers on his battles with these thugs, who also keep a stable of hookers. Perhaps the movie's greatest accomplishment was portraying the prostitutes as complicated humans, without romanticizing them a la ""Payback"" or ""Pretty Woman.""
Cantinflas also battles his bribe-demanding superiors and colleagues in a frank airing of the problem, which unfortunately has only worsened. The movie's idealism is admirable and almost poignant in light of the deterioration of Mexico City's police department since the movie's 1977 release.",998352000,4,1114,5.194444444444445

7875022,5,6304617577,"I grew up with my parents watching these movies and wanted to watch this one that was one of my favorites!
my dad and uncle came over and we truly enjoyed watching this movie, my dad said that the picture quality was absolutely amazing. We will definitely order from this seller again. If you can understand Spanish, you need to watch this movie, Cantinflas isn't just absolutely hilarious, without needing to use vulgar language (like so many comedians do now) but his movies always convey some kind of message that I think is remarkable for people of all ages. Thank you seller",1431302400,,579,4.686274509803922
