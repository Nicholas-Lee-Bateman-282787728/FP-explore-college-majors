8130755,2,B000GDIBGQ,"We were looking to expand our DVD collection for our twin 13-month-olds and gave this a try based on other reviews.  The main problem with this DVD is the uninspired approach and amateurish production quality.

After watching several of the Baby Einstein DVDs, this one feels like it was produced by an local volunteer-based cable TV station.  Horatio's voice is flat and unremarkable, the three kids in the DVD aren't very attractive and are filmed clumsily in someone's house, and the background music doesn't match the pictures or what's happening on the screen very well.  Pedagogically, the topics it covers are fine (counting simple numbers, etc.), but it does so in an uninspired way. Horatio has a little song for the topics he introduces and it gets a little boring after a while.  There are long sections where there is just Horatio talking on screen, as well. Our toddlers quickly lost interest and stopped watching.

If you're looking for a good DVD for your toddler, try some of the Baby Einstein or Brainy Baby ones instead.",1201392000,,1038,4.869318181818182
8130756,3,B000GDIBGQ,"This DVD is good for Baby children.
It is a bit short.
For about $10 it would have been great. I don't think that it worths more than this.",1184976000,,139,3.8275862068965516
8130757,5,B000GDIBGQ,"Move over Elmo....my daughter has a new love. Horatio is absolutely her favorite video! She gets excited when we put it in the player. She counts along with Horatio, knows EVERY color from the video, learned shapes and animals. I know for a fact she learned how to say ""hi"" from it.

I find the Einstein videos interesting, but my daughter hasn't learned anything from them... other than to sit and stare for a half hour almost in a trance. I guess that's O.K. for some parents, but for us, if she's going to watch T.V., it better be educational. I can absolutely say, that this is EDUCATIONAL. The people behind this video obviously know what children like!",1160611200,5,658,4.576271186440678
8130758,5,B000GDIBGQ,"My 18 month old son is Horatio's biggest fan. He smiles and gets so excited the minute Horatio walks on the screen. The character, music, and songs are all very baby-friendly. The concepts of counting, shapes, and colors are presented in a fun way. He likes to see the other children on TV and especially loves to see all of the animals. When he watches the video, I know that he is not only being entertained, but also learning.

As a parent I like the educational aspect of the video. My son is interacting with the tv, not going into a trance. The mix of a puppet, animation, live children, and classical music holds my son's interest. I highly recommend this video!",1159833600,5,669,4.483606557377049
8130759,5,B000GDIBGQ,"My 18 month old daughter loves this DVD. I agree with the reviewer below that the DVD is cheerful, friendly, colorful and on target with the concepts being taught. I personally had no issue with hearing Horatio or that it's a puppet talking. I like that it is trying to teach, rather then just showing flashy toys with music.

What's important is that my daughter enjoys this video.  It entertains her and I truly believe that she is learning from it.

I definitely would recommend this video!",1159142400,8,493,4.64367816091954
8130760,5,B000GDIBGQ,"Our son loves Horatio!!  He likes watching this video over and over.

What's great is that the video is educational and my son also interacts with the video.  He waves Hi when Horatio waves Hi and he claps when the kids on the video clap.  And he laughs when Horatio does peek - a - boo!

The video isn't as polished as some other videos, but it's still great!

I highly recommend this video!!",1154563200,7,393,4.243243243243243
8130761,5,B000GDIBGQ,"My twin daughters(18 months)absolutely love this video. When I put it on for them, they are drawn to the TV. It really holds their attention. The lion is very cute and friendly, the colors in the video are bright and cheery, and the music is soothing.

What I love most about the video is that my daughters are not just staring at the TV - they actually respond. They giggle when Horatio does peek-a-boo, wave when Horatio waves hi, and dance along with the other children in the video.

Horatio is terrific!",1152576000,9,508,4.510869565217392
8130762,5,B000GDIBGQ,"Both my kids absolutely love this video - they are mezmorized by Horatio Lion, as well as the colors, sounds and songs in the video. Whenever my 10 month old is crying, I pull out Horatio Lion and it calms him right down. My daughter also loves it and walks around singing the songs. I highly recommend this video to anyone with young children, it is not only entertaining for them, it's even educational!",1152057600,9,405,4.486486486486487
