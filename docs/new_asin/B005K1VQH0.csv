4714129,5,B005K1VQH0,"Definitely a movie I will show my three children! A fun love story with great actors that incorporates a strong ""do the right thing"" message in a meaningful and relevant way.

There are fictional lines in this historical setting, but they are reasonable for their context and they help keep the screenplay engaging and entertaining. They also flesh out the issues of that day including media bias, civil liberties, and eugenics. It is also refreshing to see the events surrounding the ""Monkey Trial"" presented in a more historically accurate way.

What a great medium to discuss important yet complicated social issues! The ensuing discussions with my children are certain to be meaningful, with tangible examples of real-life questions and challenges.

I originally purchased this film expecting to compare its historicity of it with that of ""Inherit the Wind."" It is no secret that the public perception of the Scopes trial was highly influenced by the media's portrayal and the play, RATHER than the facts of the case and the historical context. Although ""Inherit the Wind"" is an entertaining play (and screenplay), it gives a highly biased and blatantly incorrect account of the context and events surrounding the trial that has left most of the public with an incorrect perception...though a politically correct one.

But instead of merely contrasting historicity, I was surprised and delighted to discover an entertaining and well-done film.

Although the ""Monkey Trial"" is certainly the focal point of the movie, no doubt there is much more history that could be corrected...but how to do this in a short yet entertaining movie?",1321401600,6,1635,5.178030303030303
4714130,5,B005K1VQH0,"If you like history this film is for you. This DVD will correct some of the many incorrect beliefs about the famous 1925 Scopes trial, such as those in the play Inherit the Wind. One fact that it covers was the importance of racism as a motivating factor of W. J. Bryan to involve himself in the trial. Those who have read the trial transcript will soon realize how distorted the public view of the trial is, especially the play Inherit the Wind. This film was embellished slightly, but such is necessary to get a story out of a trial. Nonetheless, the basic story is accurate and the acting and cinematography are great!!! In contrast to the play Inherit the Wind, no one is demonized except possibly the Baltimore Sun news reporter, and anti-just about every minority, H. L. Mencken. The fact that the evidence for human evolution in 1925 was pathetic is brought out well in the film. The examples include Nebraska man (named Hesperopithecus found out to be a pig's tooth, specifically a peccary), Piltdown man (found out to be a hoax in the early 1950s), Neanderthal Man (now considered just another race of humans) and Java man (regarded simply as an Australopithecus). I would have quoted more from the trial transcript, which included the written testimony of the leading scientists, to show this, but the producer had to get this information in the film into a brief segment to keep the story moving, so had to abbreviate. A must see film.",1319673600,16,1446,4.696850393700787

Superb dimensional blend adds quality enhancement to interwoven Historical context , flowing action , buildup , and visuals in 'Alleged.'

*Yesterday October 22nd 2011 I participated in viewing 'Alleged' at the Made in Michigan Film Fest , in Lapeer ""at the PIX""...I'm glad I went and this film was a highlight work , Also a selected Award winner!*

It was a pleasure to watch this finely developed narrative unfold with depth , warmth and balanced sensitivity to issues of  Religion , Regional locale , Science , Medicine , Evolution , Education  and Human interaction. At 91 minutes 'Alleged' is right on schedule in drawing emotions and sympathies to the main ""Love Interest"" taking place as well!
( ...the timetable includes authentic old cars , trains and Antiques too!)

IN the ""monkey trial"" there are huge and famous egos participating in contrast to some of the more subtle personalities and the Issues taking place do get National Attention. Conflict , tensions , friendships, and enmity , Evolve to Growth although change is not always easy.

...veteran actors Brian Dennehy and Fred Thompson bring expected flair while the ""young couple"" does a range of nuance...

4714133,1,B005K1VQH0,"Alleged attempts to stir human emotions in favor of a faith-based description of the origins of life.  The movie also encourages the viewer to misinterpret Clarence Darrow's agnostic views as favoring Christianity.  In reality, Clarence Darrow was just as much a humanist as he was agnostic which meant the theory of evolution wasn't a blueprint for morality and it meant he could never support the notion or application of eugenics.  The theory of evolution was simply a more evidence-based argument for the origins of man than the imaginative origins of man that are now a major part of our human heritage.  In addition, he realized that any organized body of ideas - faith-based or factual - could serve as a basis for poor choices and irresponsible acts. There are plenty of Christians who believe in the death penalty and plenty of Darwinist who believe in eugenics.  Being properly or improperly educated about the origins of life has nothing to do with the wisdom necessary to live life compassionately. Religion and science is not like a mixture of vomit and water.  Religion has been the best carrier for moral ideas even if generally unapplied.  Science is only worthwhile if it serves humanity in a moral as well as compassionate way.  Einstein placed it best:  ""Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind.""",1400803200,8,1343,4.986547085201794

4714135,5,B005K1VQH0,"The famous ""Scopes Monkey Trial"" is often portrayed as a showdown between the forces of ignorant fundamentalism and enlightened evolution. Yet we didn't realize that in those days, many pro-evolutionists favored the ""eugenics"" idea that some people were ""defective"" and should be sterilized! The ""defectives"" were not only the disabled, they included ""mixed race"" individuals, black people and the poor.
We had no idea that ""Alleged"" would teach us so much while still being so entertaining! This ably acted, highly watchable film features seasoned performers Brian Dennehy, Fred Thompson and Colm Meany, and shows, without preaching to us, that a Christian social viewpoint can be based on compassion and not politics.
The American ideas from ""eugenics"" were promoted by many of the ""one percent"" wealthy: people who saw themselves as biologically superior. They sent American educators to Europe and Russia and elsewhere, where the totalitarians lapped up these ideas and applied them, helping kick off World War II (from which, of course, the wealthy profited).
The Eugenics movement is a shameful part of U.S. history, often covered up today. It contributed to the ""social Darwinist"" movement that helped ""robber barons"" gain control of the economy, much as they have again today! For more, see [...]. Does trying to apply Darwin's ""survival of the fittest"" to human beings lead to ideas of racial and class superiority? If so, haven't we made a mistake in accepting evolution lock, stock and barrel?",1392422400,,1504,5.297071129707113
4714136,1,B005K1VQH0,"I watched this movie with no expectations but about 15 minutes into it I realized it was a ""Christian movie"" - I've run across a couple of these films lately and it's an unusual breed of film. The characters are exaggerated - H.L. Mencken is portrayed as a shallow egoist who writes articles to just manipulate people, Darrow is portrayed as incompetent in his presentation of scientific fact and Bryant is portrayed as a wonderful witty moralist with all of the answers. Now this is hardly the truth of the Scopes Monkey trial. The complexity of the issues before American society cannot be boiled down to easy moralizing. Drinking is associated with the press in the most simplistic of ways. There is no depth to the characters - their motivations are never revealed. A real strange new portrayal of history with a Christian perspective. I went on the Christian Film website and there was no way to review the film on the website. 90 minutes not well spent",1390348800,8,958,4.708333333333333

Mencken; Fred Thompson depicts William Jennings Bryan in what would be his final trial and act as a public figure (he died shortly after winning his case); and Brian Dennehy deftly portrays Clarence Darrow (the ACLU lawyer Mencken hired to create the media storm surrounding the trial just to sell newspapers).

4714142,4,B005K1VQH0,"Let's start with the bottom-line of this movie: It's not grandly entertaining, but should hold your interest fine and has some worthwhile things to say that can be excellent discussion points.

It's a mix of true and fictional. For instance, there's a whole subplot of a young reporter with his on, then off, then on-again fianc, where he misleads people with his stories about the Scopes trial in order to try to be seen as successful in the world's eyes. To my knowledge this was a fictional part of the movie in the sense that it was written for the movie, although my guess is that there probably were such reporters at the time (that's just human nature). But several other parts of the trial itself seem to be grounded, at least partially, in true events.

This movie makes a strong link between evolution and eugenics (which was very popular in some circles at this time) and portrays the problem with both, though they are both portrayed in rather simplistic terms. You don't get a grand defense of Creationism in this movie, but it does clearly showcase two different worldviews: an atheistic one where there is no God and thus He didn't create us but that we are rather the product of evolution, and the Biblical one where there is a God and He did create us. And the evolution side is the one showcased by the movie as being foolish (though again, not because of any grand defense of Creationism that the movie portrays - more just by the ""attitude""/""tone"" of the movie).

It does showcase how the whole trial was started under very questionable pretenses and showcases that some testimony used was scripted, etc. It also lightly touches on the problems with some of the evolution ""evidence"" used such as ""Nebraska man"".

This movie is a great family or small-groups movie with lots of worthwhile discussion topics brought forth by the movie's focus on evolution, eugenics, Creationism (for instance, a main character in the movie talks of how he doesn't believe it was a literal 6-day creation), the importance of the Bible - taking God at face value, lying/deceit, the problem with trying to please the ""world"" vs. how we should do what's right before God, difference in atheistic vs. Christian worldviews, etc. There's even a discussion guide included on the disc that gives some Bible verse references, etc. relating to a few of these discussion topics (mostly on the lying/deceit/personal integrity themes).

Production quality was ""good enough"", but wasn't anything to get excited about - and actually the stylistic choice to try to make it look like the 1920's in the soft/hazy look and color tones, started to get to me a bit by about the half-way mark in the movie on the Blu-ray I watched (by the way, the Blu-ray quality was nothing to get too excited about - you could probably watch on DVD and not see much difference). The acting was fine - I must say I thought Fred Thompson did a pretty good job. I would generally put the overall quality level in the ""good made-for-t.v. movie"" type category.

4714143,5,B005K1VQH0,"Yes, the setting for this movie is the Scopes Monkey Trial. Yes, it's taken from an anti-evolution viewpoint. I'll get to that later. In reality, though, this movie deals with a young man who has the apple of fame and fortune dangled in front of him, a prize that threatens to cost him his friends, fiance, and conscience.

The focal point is Charles Anderson (Nathan West), a young reporter who wants to make it big-time like H. L. Menken (Colm Meaney). He gets the chance at the above mentioned trial, with Menken arriving. He learns, though, that some see journalism not as much as reporting the facts as influencing the reader.

I've recently read John Truby's Anatomy of Story. This book does an excellent job of following his advice in the writing of the story. The acting is strong enough to make it as well, with West a great lead, Meaney a human villain and Ashley Johnson being doing a great job as the love interest. Fred Thompson and Brian Dennehy fill the shoes of the big names of the trial, William Jennings Bryan and Clarence Darrow. Thompson did a fair job, and I'm a Dennehy fan, but in this rendition they're the supporting cast.

This movie does have an agenda on the issue. There is no question it takes an anti-evolution stand. Note I did not say creationist, which most equate with a six day view -- It sites Bryan allowing for a long day interpretation. However, it does show some of the weakness in evolutionary evidence (effectively with Darrow questioning ""witnesses"" for evolution). It also shows the tie in between evolution and eugenics/forced sterilization, which I've noted in a novel dealing with the creation/evolution debate (The Shadowed Mind by Julie Cave).

That being said, the only person who may be considered villainized is Menken. Darrow here is a good antagonist, one you root against but also has some redemptive qualities. Scopes is seen more as the innocent bystander that gets hit by the train. Bryan is showed very favorably, ignoring some of his weaknesses such as racism, but the reality is that Bryan was beloved and respected and while losing three elections himself also had a hand in the election and re-election of Woodrow Wilson.

On this video is a discussion guide, dealing with six or seven topics for a discussion of a church or home group. The focus on those questions reveals what the movie is about -- it focuses on integrity as opposed to creation/evolution.

I loved this picture, and whole heartedly recommend it.",1345939200,4,2480,4.7827102803738315
4714144,5,B005K1VQH0,"A delightful movie for a number of reasons.  The characters are real and from the ""get-go"" I cared about what happened to Rose.  Bryan, Darrow and Mencken are extremely well played.  The falsehoods and false impressions of the trial we all were subjected to in ""Inherit The Wind"" are corrected.  The story line moved quickly with twists and turns, making my afternoon viewing very enjoyable.

As a retired home school mom, I strongly recommend that parents show both movies to their teens, (most likely your child will view Inherit the Wind in school) do some research from primary sources on the trial, and discuss with your kids how movies shape the thinking of the culture for better or for worse.",1335657600,3,700,4.8
4714145,3,B005K1VQH0,"Worth watching to gain a balanced perspective on ""Scopes"", especially if one has watched Inherit the Wind (better presentation, but lacking balance of details in what actually happened).

4714146,3,B005K1VQH0,"It seems that the knowledge people have these days comes from the easiest source and that more often than not is the television. The sales of newspapers are down and it seems the art of discussion is rare these days. Fortunately the internet has changed some of this but even there a ton of misinformation can be found. So imagine what it must have been like years ago when the only source of information was the newspaper.

That's the basis of the story found in ALLEGED, a different takes than we've witnessed before concerning the Scopes monkey trial. For years the only way to learn about this trail was through the film INHERIT THE WIND. I've always loved that film, in particular the acting done by both Spencer Tracy and Frederick March. But that movie made it seem as if the trial was the result of the people's wills often depicting anyone who was religious as fanatical.

This time around we have a different story. Instead of the trial being brought about by a teacher who has a fire burning inside of him to teach students about Darwin we instead have a town that's slowly fading that needs a hook to get folks into town again. They recruit the local science teacher into saying he believes in Darwin so that they can get people riled up about the question of creationism versus evolution.

Pulled into the midst of this whole circus is Charles Anderson (Nathan West), a reporter for the local newspaper whose father was the owner years ago. He wants to move on to better things, to the big city where he can achieve fame like his idol, H.L.Menken (Colm Meaney). Menken was the leading journalist of his time and one of the most read. Getting him involved means more folks hearing about the town and then coming for the trial.

To make it an even bigger event, the townsfolk get the best speaker they can find for the prosecution, Williams Jenning Bryan (Fred Dalton Thompson). Bryan has already decried the idea of evolutionism and the trial seems like a slam dunk. But then Menken and his paper bring in noted lawyer Clarence Darrow (Brian Dennehy) for the defense. What seemed like a slam dunk is now a case that will be viewed and used across the country.

In the middle of it all is the story of Charles. He becomes caught up in the spectacle of the entire situation more interested in impressing Menken than in reporting facts. And while hanging around with Menken he is tutored in the art of twisting a phrase or creating a story where none exist. This was the state of journalism at that time and is represented much more here than in INHERIT. Charles becomes so invested in the lines and way of life Menken presents him that he nearly loses the most important thing in his life, his fianc Rose (Ashley Johnson). It isn't until a crisis slaps Charles in the face where he must decide to either tell the truth or become a part of the bigger world where truth is not told but created.

The movie is well made but appears to settle into the made for TV format in feel and appearance. This movie would not have made much released to the box office. But it does offer a nice evening's entertainment as well as offer a new look at an old story.

It also has the ability to make you think differently when looking at the news. How much of what we are told these days is the truth and how much of it is twisted to suit the needs of those in charge of dispensing the news? Many claim that FOX is little more than this but the fact of the matter is that in these days EVERY news network has their own agenda when it comes to the news they disseminate. It is rare to find the absolute truth without digging deeper to find it.

Perhaps it is this reason that more people are turning away from the major news networks we all grew up watching and trusting. Too many fake stories, too many stories that turned out to be twisted and too many stories that were ignored to support one side or the other. I think that's a good thing. People need to look deeper than the surface no matter what the outcome. And with movies like this at least getting made, perhaps more people will take the time to do so.",1332201600,7,4104,4.405013192612137
4714147,1,B005K1VQH0,"Movies should be about telling a story.  This film is a polemic against Darwin Theory and skeptics (Mencken is inaccurately and shamelessly villanized).  Events and personalities are historically inaccurate.  No surprise as this film was underwritten by the Christian Right.

No informed person would make any connection of Darwin and natural selection with eugenics or ""food-chain"" social theory. These are simply old evangelical anti-Darwin canards.  Saccharine dialog imposed on a partisan reinvention of Dayton's historical events just doesn't pass for drama.  What you get is a mawkish and transparent harangue.  Or, more kindly, a very specialized film for a small section of viewers.

4714148,4,B005K1VQH0,"We bought and finally got around to watching a movie last night that we have more than simply an entertainment interest in. The movie is Alleged and is a look at what is known as the Scopes Monkey Trial. This is the trial, back in 1925, in Tennessee that focused on the teaching of evolutionary theory in public schools. As Alleged shows, there is a lot more to the story than that! There are worldviews and motivations underlying this event that are rarely addressed, or at least addressed honestly and in a balanced way. Even the trial itself, famously portrayed in the movie Inherit The Wind, went quite differently in real life.

Unlike a lot of privately produced films in the family friendly genre, Alleged has some heavy hitters in the cast. Most notable on this list are Fred Thompson, Colm Meaney (who has been in quite a few films but is best known to me as Chief O'Brien from Star Trek:TNG and Deep Space Nine!) and Brian Dennehy, all major film stars and solid actors. Because of this, the acting and production quality of this film is substantially higher than other films like Facing the Giants that target the same audience. The film is also less overtly religious although clearly the film is not only very family friendly, it is also sympathetic to people of faith. As part of the special features, the DVD includes a series of discussion questions making this a great film to watch and discuss with a church gathering, especially in a small group study or a youth setting since they are often on the front lines of the debate over evolution and creation.

What was most interesting about this movie is that it looked at a crucial moment in American culture in a way that pushes through the cultural nostalgia of a principled defender of education and knowledge pitted against the hordes of uneducated religious fundamentalists. The reality is far more complex. For example, William Jennings Bryant was hardly a fire breathing fundamentalist, he didn't even hold to a six 24 hour day creationism. The newspaper reporters of the day were not nearly as noble as made out to be. Most importantly, the driving forces behind this event on the ""evolution side"" held to some terribly abhorrent views of human beings, views that are repugnant but also a natural result of an evolutionary worldview.

Certainly Alleged is approaching this highly charged topic and event from a particular worldview but I didn't find that it beat you over the head with it. This wasn't a feature length film clamoring about six day creationism. What it seems to be setting out to do, and I think it accomplished, was to look more at the worldview of those on the defense team, defending Mr. Scopes from charges that may not have even been true, and doing so more to push a point rather than out of a sense of justice and fairness. Regardless this event from nearly 100 years ago is still a hot issue today in our culture, educational systems and the church. Alleged is a great way to look at a crucial topic while also being an entertaining film to watch with the entire family.",1328745600,3,3068,4.677777777777778
4714149,5,B005K1VQH0,"An excellent film! Finally we have a balanced and fairly honest account about the so-called trial of the century, the Scopes trial. The writer had to add a love story to make it interesting to non-historians, but otherwise the film was a fairly accurate history of the trial and the times. The producer and writer, after he earned his law degree from Harvard, decided to research the trial and realized that the common beliefs perpetuated by the Darwinists are mostly a myth, and produced this film to more accurately show that actually happened almost a century ago in the trial still talked about today.",1321488000,4,605,4.826923076923077
4714150,5,B005K1VQH0,"Just got my Blu-ray version of ""Alleged"" and watched it.  I could tell from the opening menu it would be a quality piece of work... it was!  The cinematography, casting, costumes, props, acting are all top notch.  All the period pieces are stunning without drawing overmuch attention to themselves -- even the steam train, buildings and all.  Every detail is exquisite.  I liked the natural beauty of the Tennessee setting and the use of color and light, both inside and outside, with a variety of camera angles.  The orchestral music was classy without becoming overpowering.

The plot is an engaging story of love and moral conflict leading to a satisfying resolution, with a surprising and fun ending that will appeal to everyone.  By weaving the facts of the Scopes Trial around a story of two young lovers, the movie achieves a story-like appeal without being in-your-face about the creation-evolution controversy or coming across as a documentary.  Brian Denehy and Fred Thompson were perfect picks for Darrow and Bryan.  The H.L. Mencken character is a delightful devil worth some good hisses.  Throughout the film is seen the demoralizing, dehumanizing effect of Darwinism on individuals and society.

Compared to the darkness and arrogance of ""Inherit the Wind,"" ""Alleged"" is warm, human and believable.  More importantly, it is based on true history that ""Inherit the Wind"" ignored or mangled.  I hope ""Alleged"" leaves ""Inherit the Wind"" in its dust and becomes the new Scopes Trial movie.",1321488000,5,1499,5.11522633744856
4714151,5,B005K1VQH0,"It is a great shame that this video didn't get distributed to theaters. I heard in a radio interview that it has done well in a number of film festivals. It has some well-known actors showing how talented they are, and the quality of the filming is also equal to or better than most films that Hollywood has produced.

I call it ""The antidote to Inherit the Wind"" because many people have gotten the impression that ItW shows what the Scopes Trial was like, but this movie shows what actuallly happened. However, the primary focus is on the roots of the problems of modern journalism -- sensationalism (shocking stories about what has been ""alleged""), focusing on negatives, juicing up the plain facts (""paint a picture""), and seeking to make the public share the ""progressive"" view of events.

The protagonist of the story is a young reporter, torn between the high, ""old-fashioned"" standards of his father, and the success of H. L. Mencken, who comes to be a sort of mentor in the new ways of making news. Fans of Star Trek may marvel at how well Colm Meany plays this cynical man, so different from his character in ST:TNG. Meany doesn't soft-pedal Mencken's cynicism and cold-hearted pragmatism, yet he also doesn't go overboard and turn the character into a cardboard evil-doer. He displays Mencken's flashing sense of humor and enjoyment of life. People who admire Mencken shouldn't feel offended, and may well not see anything wrong with his ideas and behavior even when presented as belonging to the closest thing to a ""bad guy"" in this film. Which is best, honesty and integrity or fame and fortune? And can you have both?

This movie is far from the sort of propaganda or polemical affair that would portray real people as simple villains and immaculate heroes. If anything, Clarence Darrow (expertly portrayed by Brian Dennehy) is treated more positively than he deserves. Atheists and evolutionists needn't fear any offence of that sort. This is not the mirror image of Inherit the Wind in that way.

However, the movie does bring out the sorry lack of evidence, at the time, for the theory that humans evolved from lower animals. Again, the movie is perhaps overly gentle in this regard, for the sake of historical accuracy I assume, showing (for example) a presentation of the doctrine that embryonic development of humans recapitulates our evolutionary history, complete with gill slits. It is not pointed out (few if any knew it at the time) that this was a gross misrepresentation, based largely on fraudulent drawings made by Ernst Haeckel to support his own ideas about evolution. Likewise, the fact that ""Nebraska Man"" was known only from a tooth is brought out, but the fact that it was later determined to be the tooth of a pig is only brought up in the notes after the movie proper is over. It is interesting that the weaknesses of the evidence that the panel of scientists wanted to present (and did submit in writing) are brought out by Darrow (at least in this movie), as he evaluates how they would play out in the court. Likewise, the movie leaves to the unbelievers Mencken and Darrow to destroy the idea that evolution and Biblical creation are in any way compatible, either way you look at it.

Perhaps the one aspect that some may find offensive is the depiction of the connections from Darwinian evolution to eugenics to the application that included the sterilization of 60,000 people in the States, which was sanctioned by the Supreme Court. However, this too is the way it was historically. While it may be argued that Darwin's theory shouldn't be connected to socio-political attempts to purify the human gene pool, it is a fact that Darwin himself raised questions about the wisdom of allowing inferior sorts to breed, pointing out that it would be considered a bad practice in breeding animals. It's also a historical fact that the biology book that Scopes taught from (briefly, as a substitute) taught many things we would all find offensive now, and tied them to evolution and what it claimed were biological facts. It is clear that these ideas were held by very many scientists and leaders of academia.

Vying for attention with all this is a love story, nearly qualifying this as a romance movie. To my relief, it does not make the film into a ""chic flic"", although it may add some attraction for women. Fortunately, it also does not distract from the rest of the story, nor does it seem to be an afterthought that interrupts the main storyline. I found all of the different aspects of the story seamlessly blended together.

All of this adds up to a movie that is educational, but in a way that you wouldn't notice if you weren't looking. I was looking, and learned some things even though I've studied the subject a bit more than most people probably have. Some things I wonder about and would like to do some research on, and that's a good thing. You can enjoy it just for the performance of Colm Meany (and/or the other actors; Fred Thompson does a good job bringing William Jennings Bryan to life, again as a man with both good qualities and human frailty). It's enjoyable as a tale of Boy engages Girl, Boy picks up bad habits, Girl breaks off engagement... (Sorry if this is a spoiler, but it has a happy ending!). It's fascinating as a picture of a bygone era, a period when foundations held for centuries were being exchanged for what was considered the modern, progressive way of looking at the world. Without being preachy, it invites us to question things we are told we must accept as true and good.

(BTW, if you would like to experience some of the scenery first-hand, come to Genesee County, Michigan, where much of the filming was done. Look up Crossroads Village and Huckleberry Railroad. It's close to Flint.)",1321401600,9,5771,4.746759720837487

Mencken, love interests Ashley Johnson (The Help, The Avengers) and Nathan West, and the adorable Khori Faison as the half-black step sister targeted by her racist uncle/doctor for sterilization (relevant side story). This great movie Alleged is accurate to the history and trial transcript of the Scopes Monkey Trial, unlike Hollywood's previous Inherit the Wind attempt. Also, it presents what Hollywood and others intentionally leave out of their popular renditions, that the textbook that was being defended by the ACLU's Darrow was Hunter's ""Civic Biology"", which portrayed Blacks and Jews and other racial minorities as closer to apes as compared to those of European descent.

I believe it could have been told in a more refined way. In order to undo the wrongs of the extreme propaganda of the earlier movie, the producers should have been careful to avoid swinging too far in the other direction because it then began to seem contrived and thus defeated the intention,",1455580800,2,648,4.692982456140351

Lawrence and Lee's classic Inherit the Wind has been a yardstick for excellence in popular theater entertainment for more than a half-century and has repeatedly attracted top line actors of all political stripes:  Spencer Tracy, Gene Kelly, Fredric March, George C Scott, Jack Lemon, Melvyn Douglas, Ed Begley, Claude Akins, Kirk Douglas and Jason Robards.  It is regularly played at schools and local dramatic groups.  It does however contain some over-dramatizations of the famous ""Scopes Monkey Trial,""  such as the prejudgment incarceration of the defendant, the musical parades spouting hateful death wishes and a local fundamentalist, presumably Calvinist clergyman who is vile beyond belief.  Nonetheless the play and the original Stanley Kramer film remain established classics.

In ""Alleged"" -- a title merited far beyond the contemplation of its creator -- the fundamentalist christian movement takes a strong counterfire with all new purely fictional characters and ""allegedly"" fair portrayal of the actual trial and principal historical characters.  William Jennings Bryan is treated with hornbook hagiography extending to his death from diabetic complications rather than failure at trial and is played by Fred Thompson, a leading portrayer of down to earth authority figures.  Clarence Darrow is Brian Dennehy, perhaps in a role marking a descent to irrelevance.  In an entirely false and fraudulent scene near the end, Dennehy/Darrow, rather than making huge efforts to have the orthodox science of the time, as represented by leading experts from the best universities, admitted into evidence, meets with those experts to reach the conclusion that all of the evidence for evolution couldn't fit between his fat butt cheeks.""  The gratuitous phariseeic commentary at the end of the film fails to mention how that profoundly dishonest line has held up in science over the subsequent 90 years for the great majority of folks not wearing the blinders of fundamentalist religion.

The greatest crime of this grossly criminal tome is the attacks it offers on the honesty, integrity, motivations and character of one of America's best and wisest thinkers and social commentators, Henry L. Mencken.  The libel, slander and defamation here is far, far beyond what would make even a garden variety fraudster or con-artist blush so shiningly red as to stop highway traffic in the area on the spot.  The brilliant and didactic Mencken is portrayed as a Mephistopheles dedicated to using the bible as toilet paper and stealing the soul of a talented young local newspaperman who has ambitions to surpass his hick father's career writing stories about the county fair and cats rescued from trees.  These attacks on Inherit the Wind and Mencken in particular are equivalent to portraying Da Vinci's Last Supper as a private gathering at a gay bar.

But the deceit and outright misrepresentation don't stop there.  The loathesome Butler Act forbidding the teaching of accepted science in favor of the allegorical at best, purely mythical superstitions of Genesis is now represented as an early warning against the Hitlerian crimes in the name of Eugenics that did happen -- but only more than 20 years later.  There is not even a breath of a suggestion that this was in reality a piece of pure political hokum by an ignoramus for ignoramuses to gain some short term support from the fundamentalist morons so prevalent in 1920's Tennessee.  Again, 80 years of history put paid to the lie embodied in the script.

The reader here will notice that I gave two stars instead of zero or one to this nonsense.  I do because there is a fair amount of instruction to be had here on the subject of propaganda.  While Lawrence and Lee took some license in their play, they aimed at a different political target, the communist investigations of the early 50s.  Here, it is clear that the so-called christian family movement is out to do nothing more than mislead and misrepresent historical fact in hopes of bolstering some idiots' acceptance of their biblical hogwash.  In this effort, the reach heights (or depths) of bulls*** not achieved since the passing of the unlamented Josef Goebbels.  Take the time to watch this crap, if only to realize the lack of truth and principle in christian fundamentalist America in the Twenty-First Century./",1422835200,4,4363,5.172119487908962
