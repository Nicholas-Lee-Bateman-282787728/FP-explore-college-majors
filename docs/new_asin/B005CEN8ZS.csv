8465159,5,B005CEN8ZS,Great movie.,1429747200,,12,5.5
8465160,5,B005CEN8ZS,This is a fun guilty-pleasure sort of movie that delivers exactly what it promises: wall-to-wall music and lots attractive LA types up to no good.,1376265600,,146,4.88
8465161,1,B005CEN8ZS,"I can't honestly remember the last time I saw a movie that imploded quite so completely as iCrime does.  It starts out as a sassy and entertaining riff on Veronica Mars with Sara Fletcher as an aspiring actress and internet journalist investigating to try and expose an online kidnapping as a hoax.  The first half has some plot holes (there are two secret sex tapes in play but we never find out what's on the second one or why the main character is interested in it) but the movie coasts along on the likability of its lead character and actress, which more than compensates for the film's occasional first half clunkiness.  Then iCrime springs a big plot twist on the audience that erases every ounce of goodwill that the movie managed to create up to that point and basically demonstrates that the filmmakers had no idea what made the first half of their film good in the first place.  The shockingly ill-advised third act twist (which is nearly identical to the one in the lousy horror movie Smiley) makes it impossible to recommend iCrime or even watch it a second time with any enjoyment at all--it ruins the movie completely.",1376179200,,1133,4.65
8465162,5,B005CEN8ZS,"I really enjoyed this flick! The plot and plot twists held my attention from start to finish. Kerry was very real, very human. There were many times through out the movie that I just didn't like her but by the end I really felt I knew and understood her. If you're looking for a mystery wrapped in a comedy/drama peopled with up to the minute characters you just found it!",1358380800,,372,4.328571428571428
8465163,5,B005CEN8ZS,Cast was great.  Fast moving plot with interesting twists.  This film will hold your interest throughout.  The theme is close to what maybe a reality of today.,1317859200,4,159,4.814814814814815
8465164,5,B005CEN8ZS,"This movie is a must see.  I didn't know if I would like it, but once it started I found myself loving it.  It is witty, charming and suspenseful.  There are so many plot twist and turns and the final reveal is a shocker.  If you love fun movies...see this!!!",1316390400,5,259,4.12
