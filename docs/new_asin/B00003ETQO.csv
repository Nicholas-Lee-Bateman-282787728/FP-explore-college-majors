1329920,5,B00003ETQO,"I first discovered this in Sony's Sonystyle mag, and sure enough, it is a fantastic DVD; Will Smith's blend of Movie and Music lends itself perfect for DVD. Sadly, some songs (""Gettin jiggy wit it"" and ""Just  the two us"" seemed to be too much bits per sec for my computer DVD.  (Dell Margi) Even without the two songs this DVD rocks with MIB, WWWest and  Will 2K.
Extra takes include Behind the Scenes of Will 2K and Bloopers.  also DVD bonus ""So Fresh"". This DVD pushes the envelop on whats  possible with upbeat music and camera action.",960595200,9,538,4.448979591836735

7918769,4,B00003ETQO,"In the video ""Will 2K"" some sound effects are barely audible, namely:
1. the time displacement phenomenon
2. the police whistle
3. will smith reaching through the interstital(dimensional) transparency

Other than that, it's outstanding to watch it in Hi-res.
Rolling Stone once ranked the Video ""Will 2K"" as one the worst videos of all time,
near the bottom, in fact, out of 100. It may have even been number 99.
hmmmm,  I don't know about that... perhaps they didn't like the message
I haven't yet watched the other videos",1454457600,,523,4.865168539325842
