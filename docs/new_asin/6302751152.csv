503540,5,6302751152,"John Ford's Sergeant Rutledge is a fine combination of the standard cavalry western with a murder mystery.  Added to the mix is the social commentary of racial prejudice and you have a fine movie for 2001 but this was released 40 years ago at a time when I imagine few had ever heard of buffalo soldiers.

The lead charecters are exceptional from Jeffrey Hunter and Woody Strode to the lesser charecters without which this would have been almost impossible to film.  Sergeant Skidmore's character is a case in point, when asked to state his age it turns out he saw the first steamboat on the Mississippi River, observed while he was still a slave and which makes him over 60 years old!  Constance Towers does double duty as the romantic (after awhile) interest and also the focal point by which a great deal of the story is told.

Ford makes excellent use of his people and terrain to present a breath-taking view of the southwest.  The courtroom scenes have just the right touch of lynch-mob mentality competing with the need for fairness.  The board of officers who will decide Rutledge's fate, have pretty much already determined his guilt but at the same time respect him as a soldier - some have even served with him.  The Colonel's comments during his wife's testimony are both funny and just a bit demeaning at the same time.

Yet throughout the film, Strode's performance holds the whole thing together - whether confronting Hunter as he is being arrested after saving Towers, to convincing a dying soldier and friend that service in the Army will bring a better future for blacks to his superb and chilling performance as he is being questioned by the prosecutor, all are outstanding.

This is a little heard of film that is a must for any western fan or one interested in social commentary via movies.  I recommend it to everyone as an examination of prejudice.",996969600,4,1871,4.708588957055214

503716,4,6302751152,"John Ford steps out of his usual western motif to examine the Buffalo Soldiers that helped win the West - (I hate that phrase because it makes the killing of Natives-Americans seem glorious and inevitable.)

However, it is a product of its time, as the title character, Woody Strode is NOT given the star billing he so richly deserves. Had Woody Strode been born 20 years later, he would have been a celebrated and rich Hollywood star.

The acting must be viewed with the prevailing style exemplified in westerns of that time - e.g. a hero who is larger than life, a herione who refuses to be a victim and a catalyst for moral reflection/growth.

503807,5,6302751152,"Of all John Ford's westerns this is the only one with the main hero being black and the only one which action is situated mostly in the courtroom - and in fact it is as much a judicial drama as a western.

This film was made in 1960 and its beginning, which even today can be a little bit scary, was even more controversial in those times. During a dark moonless night, in an deserted train station in the middle of nowhere, a young white woman is suddenly brutaly grabbed and overpowered by a gigantic black man with a menacing face. And things get soon even worse, because we soon learn that this man, Sergeant Braxton Rutledge, is a deserter and a fugitive, wanted for brutal rape and horrible murder of a white teenage girl and also for the murder of her father - who was also his commanding officer...

I will say no more, but believe me, this film contains many brutal and shocking twists and surprises, which are only very slowly (but always very logically) explained, with the final shocker coming only at the very end. The timeline in the film is somehow similar to the later ""Man who killed Liberty Valance"", but even more complicated - there are many comings and goings between events which happened in the past and the ""present time"" courtroom in which witnesses take turns to tell the story. Some events are also described by different witnesses in a different way, a little bit like in ""Rashomon"", although here there is no doubt about the real truth - at the very end of the film things are established with absolute certainty.

This western was one of the very first to picture the ""Buffalo soldiers"", black soldiers serving in US Cavalry in the plains during Indian Wars and it shows them with a great respect - and also some quite tender humour...

This is also one of more brutal films in the whole John Ford's career. The crime which is the central piece of the film is absolutely horrible and the violence of ongoing war against the Apaches is described in pretty graphic words (no images though - this is an old film). During some of the scenes in the desert, the fear felt by black soldiers and white farmers is almost unbearable, as the arrival of Apache raiders in the area surprised everybody and pending the arrival of military reinforcement, they have the upper hand - and they are known for horribly torturing people they capture alive...

Even if on the poster of the film his name was put only in the fourth position, the real star of this film is the black actor Woody Strode (1914-1994), who plays Sergeant Rutledge. This very tall and athletic man with a quite threatening face played in quite a lot of Hollywood films, albeit mostly in second roles. His career started with a western (a cameo in ""Stagecoach"" in 1939) and ended with another western (a cameo in ""The quick and the dead"" in 1995 - the film was released soon after his death). Other than those films, he also appeared in ""The Ten Commandments"" (a cameo as King of Ethiopia), ""Pork Chop Hill"", ""Spartacus"" (Draba, the black gladiator who fought Kirk Douglas), ""The man who shot Libert Valance"" (Pompey), ""The professionals"" (the mercenary with the bow), ""Once upon a time in the West"" (one of gunfighters who wait for Charles Bronson in the beginning) and in a great number of lesser movies. A great friend of John Ford, married to a real Hawaian princess, he had a long, well filled and pretty succesful life.

The second major star of the film is Jeffrey Hunter, who in 1960 was at the beginning of what seemed as a very promising career - and he indeed was to star in some important movies and even play the main role of Captain Pike in the pilot of ""Star Trek"" (the legendary ""Cage""), before his untimely and tragic death in 1969. He does a great job in this film as the counsel for the defense and possibly the ONLY MAN in the courtroom who doesn't want to simply hang Sergeant Rutledge and be done with it...

All other actors, mostly experienced veterans from ""Ford's Company"", also did a great job. Although very dramatic and for those times pretty brutal, ""Sergeant Rutledge"" contains also some pretty funny moments, quite typical for John Ford's sense of humor. The testimony of the wife of the old colonel who presides the court martial is an absolutely marvelous moment of great comedy in the middle of a great tragedy...)))

I watched this film for the first time when I was just a kid and recently I was very pleased to see that it didn't age AT ALL. It is an excellent, very original, very intelligent and very surprising film. Enjoy!",1361491200,,4547,4.570552147239264

This 1960 movie dealt with racism in the west about a 100 years earlier, while it was just truly being dealt with when this movie was being made.

503810,4,6302751152,"I've seen this film on television at least three times, which speaks well for the programming decisions.  I was shocked, to be restrained about it, to find it was released in 1960.  Before I found that out, I had thought of it as being considerably older.  Part of that was the various memes and conventions about the Old West and the Army and Indians.  The other was a series of caricatures of the black privates.  Horridly demeaning, I thought, comparable with the Gone With The Wind actress who didn't know nothin' about birthin' babies.  Strode's character was magnificent.  Some of the unnamed privates were probably ashamed of what they had to do to get a paycheck.  It had not occurred to me that screen writers were still doing that in 1960.
That said, the movie is well-shot, with Ford's enormous landscapes and what may as well be realistic fighting scenes, so strongly has he told us what they were.
Having been a lieutenant, I can sympathize with Strode's commander.  At that age with that experience, you should be, but probably won't be, calm, confident, and unfazed.  In fact, as a Hollywood hero, he is calm, cool, and unfazed in combat, but the other parts of the story give him trouble.  Yeah, I can see it.
I was also interested, not to say, surprised about this movie and it has nothing to do with Hollywood.  1960 is the year Harper Lee's ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" was published.  An interesting year for that theme and between them, they probably had something to do with the ramping up of the civil rights movement.
Some conflicts are pretty lame in story or on the screen.  But in both, the viewer or the reader sits there, practically yelling at the characters, ""He's wrong!'  ""You're wrong!""  ""Don't you see?""
Terrific movie and one of those you can see over and over.  Like, surprise, ""To Kill a Mockingbird"".",1328140800,2,1834,4.663551401869159

Other than that, I always liked Jeffrey Hunter.  He plays a lawyer in the Army defending a soldier accused of violating and killing the daughter of the commander of the Army post.",1306281600,,430,4.605263157894737
503861,5,6302751152,"I had the distinct honor of meeting Woody Strode who plays 1st Sergeant Braxton Rutledge, at a California film retrospective in his honor shortly before his death on New Year's Eve, 1994.  Strode was usually depicted as a brawny character actor who was featured prominently in ""Two Rode Together"", and ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"".  This film chronicles the 9th Cavalry and their first sergeant who is on trial for the rape and murder of his commanding officer's daughter.  It is in every way a John Ford production, handsomely mounted and shot primarily in the picturesque Monument Valley.  While Jeffrey Hunter and Constance Towers give impressive performances, Woody Strode should have been nominated for an Academy Award.  His character knows the inherent racism of the times which includes the less-than-equal status of the segregated unit of which he is a member.  During the film retrospective when Rutledge makes his impassioned speech during the courts martial, Strode turned to me and gently said, ""it still gives me goosebumps"".  I agree, because when I first saw this movie at the age of nine during its 1960 premiere, I left the theater having witnesed my first African-American ""hero"".  I have not the space to go into a lengthy dissertation about the history of the Buffalo Soldiers, but a wealth of information is available.  Next to ""Shane"", ""Sergeant Rutledge"" is my favorite western and I applaud John Ford for putting it all together.",1305849600,12,1460,5.05
503862,4,6302751152,"One of the best DVD's I've seen, short of Blu-Ray quality. This is an almost forgotten classic. Solid acting and fantastic direction from John Ford. Looked great on my high definition T.V.",1296864000,2,188,4.90625
503863,4,6302751152,"... muse for this little film about the black man's place in the segregated army of the late 1800's. No wonder Strode inspired Ford to make this film which stars Strode, although he does not get star billing. Strode is a  magnificent looking actor, who though untrained, (and this is obvious in parts of the film) has a tremendous impact on screen. He is absolutely believable as the chisel-featured ""top soldier"" at his fort, where black cavalry troops are stationed. Here he expertly fights Indians and saves white damsels-in-distress from certain scalpings, without compromising his position as a man who otherwise cannot entertain romantic thoughts about them.

He encounters a problem in that he is seen leaving a white officer's home wherein said officer and his lovely daughter are found murdered, the daughter nude, and raped. When Rutledge is charged with the violence he runs away and deserts the army. He is captured, recaptured, and brought back to the fort to stand trial for the crimes. The white officer charged with capturing him defends him at the court martial.

Whenever we see a trial in a Ford film, we know we have to put up with some really corny humor and hijinks (Young Mr Lincoln). Why Ford thought the courtroom was the place for idiocy is a mystery. At any rate, some of the important drama in Sergeant Rutledge takes place in court, and the nonsense with the chief judge's wife and her lady friends is not very amusing. It detracts from the drama of the courtroom sequences and lessens the film's impact in my opinion.

As in much of Ford's lesser efforts, some of the acting is also subpar. Jeffrey Hunter is not effective as Rutledge's superior officer and trial defender. He has two acting ranges, wooden and shrill. The murderer also does a poor job in his confession scene. Strode, Juano Hernandez and Constance Tower are all good in their roles, and the scenes when the black troopers talk amongst themselves is revealing and engaging. When a black troop is killed during a scuffle with some Indians, one troop comments that he doesn't want to die fighting the white man's battles, after all what is in it for him? When his troops want Strode to account for the charges against him he explains ominously that it is ""white women business"" a situation in which the black man is unlikely to prevail.  But it is Strode's confession as to  why he  lets himself be recaptured to stand trial when he could have gotten away that is compelling and believable. He states that he came back because he had found his dignity and life's work in the army, and he did not want to cheapen his record by running. Strode is very effective in this scene. Although there are problems with the pace and acting in the film it is worth seeing. I think most viewers will come away impressed with the film as a whole.",1280016000,4,2826,4.685483870967742
503864,4,6302751152,"This movie is well acted, well written, and has a strong cast.  But most important it is directed by a man who was not afraid to take on racial issues in the days prior to the Civil Rights Act.  Perhaps it was because of efforts like this film that Americans realized the land of the free was less free for people of color.

A black sergeant from a group of ""Buffalo Soldiers"" is accused of rape and murder.  Through it all he maintains his sense of duty as a soldier to protect the civilians in the region of his post.  He doesn't whine about mistreatment, he doesn't complain about life being unfair.  He simply does his duty as a soldier, mindful of the responsibilities his rank demands.  During an attack he rides off into the blaze of battle to assist an injured comrade.  During a siege of a remote ranch, he is alone with a white woman but offers her protection and safety.

It is the whites of the military and of the main post that try to play the race card when the assault and murders occur.  No one, it would seem to them, would mind if a black man was charged and hanged for the offense, even if it meant the perpetrator remained free to repeat the crime again.  At first the defense attorney at the courts martial was not even going to put up any kind of serious defense of the accused.  He does come around to point out the innocense of his client, only to wrongly conclude who the actual guilty party was.  It is only at this time that the real killer breaks down on the witness stand and confesses.

This movie does not get a lot of air time nor does it get a lot of credit.  It was filmed the same year as John Wayne's ""Alamo"" which the Duke criticized Americans for not cozying up to his film.  Wayne said those who did not appreciate the Alamo did not grasp their nation's history.  One could make a stronger case for Sergeant Rutledge.  This movie was even moreso about American society's failure to come to terms with its own lofty standards when it failed to apply equally the tenets of the constitution.  Sergeant Rutledge does much to illustrate the racial divisions at work in American society.  This is also a very gripping movie with a high entertainment value.",1278892800,5,2190,4.373762376237623
503865,3,6302751152,"Not one of John Ford's stronger films, but still well worth seeing.  This is the first film Ford & Woody Strode worked together.  They then became fast friends til Ford's death, & Ford used him in his subsequent films.  (Woody played a VERY unique Mongol barbarian in Ford's last film ""Seven Women"".)  The film studio allegedly didn't want Ford to use Strode in ""SR"", instead pressing for Harry Belafonte or Sidney Poitier, but Ford said the latter two actors ""weren't tough enough"". Here in his first Ford film, Strode is a bit stiff & wooden, but he's absolutely an iconic physical presence & lends great dignity to the role. The movie's racial politics are today somewhat dated, but for its time it was pretty daring & it completely is on the side of the angels.  The final ""shocking"" revelation about a young woman's rape plays like a VERY bad ""Perry Mason"" climax, but that aside, this is a solid (good, but not great)film.",1272931200,4,928,4.668711656441718
503866,5,6302751152,This movie is an excellent story of a man struggling with a conflict between his friendship and his duty.  The theme was ground-breaking for its time and the performances by Jeffrey Hunter and Woody Strode are perfect.  The supporting cast is also excellent and the many glimpses into life in that period round out the movie.,1271203200,12,325,4.785714285714286

503899,4,6302751152,"Ex-pioneering footballer Woody Strode, gives a powerful performance as top sergeant of U.S. cavalry troop 9 Braxton Rutledge, stationed in Arizona territory in the 1880's, in John Ford's underrated ""Sergeant Rutledge"".  Rutledge, a proud, brave and heroic soldier and ex-slave has been unjustly accused of a double homicide and is standing for a court martial.  His long time comrade Lt. Tom Cantrell played by Jeffrey Hunter is acting as Strode's defense counsel.

Braxton is a member of the celebrated Buffalo Soldiers, an all black squadron known and feared by the troublesome Apaches who inhabit a nearby reservation.  Using flashback sequences, we see the actions that brought Strode to the predicament he finds himself in.  Constance Towers playing Mary Beecher, returning from the east to be reunited with her father unwittingly runs smack into this drama and serves as a defense witness for Strode.  Billie Burke appears in her last significant movie role as the wife of the commandant the comedic Mrs. Fosgate.

John Ford does well in depicting the struggles felt by the black soldiers, emancipated years ago, to be accepted with equality in the U.S. army.  Strode highlights this point with a moving soliloquy as he testifies in his own defense.",1164672000,2,1255,5.178217821782178
503900,5,6302751152,"Ford has a collection of work that is both gritty and exciting. Not only is this a story of the Cavalry in the southwest, not only a story of Calvalry versus Indians, not only of romance, and not only of solid characters, this is a gutsy story of inherent racism in the country, of murder and of courtroom drama.

Woody Strode plays an excellent Sergeant Rutledge, the black 9th Cavalry top sergeant accused of the rape and murder of a white woman. Jeffrey Hunter plays a strong Cavalry lieutenant, assigned to the black ""Buffalo Soldiers"" that patroled the 19th century southwest. He leads them in combat and he stands tall to defend Sergeant Rutledge.

The storyline moves along with each element working in tandem. It's a Ford work and it lives up to his standards and to his love and respect for the western Cavalry.

Well worth seeing as a social and historical review. Certainly worth watching for anyone interested in the time of the Cavalry generally, the Buffalo Soldiers in particular.

Hope the DVD is released soon.",1163721600,22,1027,4.752808988764045
503901,5,6302751152,"""Sergeant Rutledge"" speaks alot about the character of director John Ford in the twilight of his storied career.  His track record allowed him the luxury of tackling hotbutton issues without consideration of controversy or commercial concerns.  By tackling racism so bluntly in a day where others kind of sugarcoated the topic is a tribute alone to Ford.  That he does so superbly makes ""Sergeant Rutledge"" indispensible.  The film works on so many levels aside from an exploration of racism.  It is a moving tribute to the 9th Calvary division that consisted of African-American troops.  It's also a riveting courtroom drama where you don't feel cheated by the denouement.  Excellent performances with Jeffrey Hunter compelling as the lieutenant assigned the duty of a defending a ""buffalo soldier"" of the unthinkable and Woody Strode solid in the title role.  You can separate this film from Ford's other work but it is a piece of a complex puzzle that is a master director's outstanding output.",1152057600,35,997,5.111111111111111
503902,5,6302751152,"What stands out for me about this film is not simply that it deals with racial prejudice at a time when blacks were still struggling for their basic civil rights (there were at the time other films that already dealt with this racism), but rather that it unflinchingly confronted perhaps its most sensitive and poisonous manifestation, namely the fear of whites, especially white males, of the black man ravishing the white woman. In this film, we are set up with the classic stereotype of such fantasies, young, blonde and virginal, and then confronted with the fear and hatred that the accusation against the benighted Sergeant Rutledge of having committed a brutal rape and murder against such a victim evokes in all of its raw ugliness.  Moreover, I think that the film is still relevant in this regard in that it suggests that we should ask ourselves how much of a role this fantasy continues to play in the racism against the black male that remains today.
Although I do not consider this to be one of Ford's greatest films, it was, especially for a major and established film director like Ford, a profoundly courageous undertaking.",1061078400,6,1139,4.841025641025641
503903,4,6302751152,"Director John Ford's strident civil rights drama, set among a troop of African-American ""Buffalo Soldiers"" in the post-Civil War frontier, is more than a little heavy-handed, but has its heart in the right place.  Woody Strode plays a veteran cavalryman falsely accused of molesting a white woman, and facing a legal lynching at the hands of a kangaroo court presumably typical of the times. The script is relentessly one-sided, but is aided by an innovative narrative structure, with ""Ran""-like flashbacks that lead backwards to the whole big picture that absolves Rutledge (yet still may not be enough to save his life).  Strode, typically stolid and reserved, coolly unfolds his character's emotions, coming to a rousing crescendo at the film's end.  Interesting Hollywood ""issue"" film made as the Civil Rights Movement was still doing a slow simmer in the American South.",1041465600,4,875,5.235714285714286
503904,4,6302751152,"I have seen this film called a ""minor Ford work"" many times. That may be; however, it rises above much else that is available.  The story of Braxton Rutledge,former slave and U.S. cavalry sergeant is captivating and Ford was ahead of his time in making such a story. The film was released in 1960 and the climate of those years was not as it is today. As a result, the film had a rather limited release.
Woody Strode was wonderful in the title role (note though in the credits he receives minor billing); bringing a quiet strength and dignity to the accused man. The scene in which he responds to the battering of a race-baiting attorney is powerful and makes one think that Strode could have been put to better use during his long career.
Sergeant Rutledge deserves reevaluation.",1021680000,12,780,4.611510791366906
503905,4,6302751152,"I don't remember when I first saw this excellent film, but I would imagine that it was on television,complete with commercials,so as soon as it came out on video I rented it.
  It is on my top ten list of films. Woody Strode is magnificent as Rutledge,and Jeffrey Hunter as his court appointed lawyer gives one of the best performances of his (at the time the film was released)young career. I have said before and will say again
that he was one of the most underated actors that ever graced the silver screen. Wont get into the romance in the film because it is really rather irrelevant to the main body of the story,except when Mary( well played by Constance Towers)becomes Cantrell's
conscience when Rutledge tries to run away. You can just feel the tension as Cantrell struggles to come to grips with his own prejudices to defend Rutledge to the best of his ability.  The
courtroom scenes are excellent,and I appologize for forgetting the name of the actor who plays the prosecutor. Trivia fans will recognize Billie Burke(Glinda the good from Wizard of Oz) as the
commanders ditzy wife!)  Terrific film!",1004486400,13,1108,4.755208333333333
7830370,3,6302751152,"Watchable but weak John Ford movie. Ford appears to be channeling a cross between Perry Mason and Anatomy of a Murder and this is a mediocre imitation of both. Woody Strode is wooden, Constance Powers not much better, and the histrionics and violations of courtroom procedure  by the prosecutor out of line if this is meant to be a serious courtroom drama which you seriously wonder if Sergeant Rutledge was ever meant to be based on the Billie Burke character and the Judge.

7830376,5,6302751152,Although this may be considered a western it really is much more than that. Whether you are a fan of the western genre or not it is still a good watch! It has action. It has suspense. It has mystery. It has drama. It has all this and enough plot twists to keep you guessing what is going on and who done what. Above all that though there is at its center a heart touching story with a moral behind it. Woody Strode was absolutely one the greatest actors in any genre but he was especially great in western settings! Sadly he is no longer with us. This movie is a fitting tribute to him. Also Jeffery Hunter does a great job! Another great actor who died much too young. It is great to see his performance as well. If you're considering purchasing this one stop. There is nothing to consider. Get it while you can. Enjoy!,1477180800,,820,4.229299363057325

7830379,5,6302751152,"This movie is a hidden treasure. Why it is not more well known? Possibly because it is a 1960 western that has a large African-American cast, one of whom is the title character. It could also be because it is a court room drama, and the action sequences are only in flashbacks. Whatever the reason, the fact is this movie is way ahead of its time. It is a dark tale that reveals the ugly side of many of its characters. It deals with the subjects of racism, sexism, and sexual assault in a frank and adult manner. The film does not beat the viewer over the head with a message, but it does not ignore the existence and reality of these issues. Another reason to love it is that there aren't many films that are about the Buffalo Soldiers of the Old West, and this is a John Ford film that tells a story about them and does it well. It may not be quite the masterpiece that John Ford's The Searchers, Stagecoach, and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance are, but it is up there among the great westerns. Perhaps in time its proper place will be better understood among film fans.",1473724800,,1074,4.269607843137255
