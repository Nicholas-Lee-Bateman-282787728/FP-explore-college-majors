3894508,4,B002BIULN0,For anyone who appreciates British comedies this is a great DVD to buy. Mr. Meldrew the grouchy husband of a long suffering wife is hilarious.  Life seems to throw wrenches in his plans on a regular basis.  In spite of his sour demeanor he is not totally without some redeeming qualities they are just very difficult to find.,1382313600,,325,4.586206896551724
3894509,1,B002BIULN0,Wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy. Junk! How did this get out of England? Only saw one show and the rest will go into the trash.,1366502400,,131,3.888888888888889
3894510,5,B002BIULN0,"This DVD completed my collection of all the shows.  If you are a fan of the series you must get this DVD.  It is brilliantly funny and, as always, devilishly clever.  Not only is the acting spot on, the entire series is written by ONE PERSON!  What an unbelievably talented mind he has!  One Foot ranks as one of the all-time greatest Britcoms.",1363046400,4,344,4.396825396825397

3894512,4,B002BIULN0,"These are Christmas Specials that are not the least bit Christmasy. If you're looking for snow and mistletoe this dvd is not for you. But if you have enjoyed the bbc series, and understand what it's all about, you'll enjoy this. I did!",1294790400,4,235,4.488372093023256
3894513,5,B002BIULN0,"For those interested in comedy that is not slap-stick, in-your-face, or obnoxious, One Foot in the Grave is the perfect remedy.  The situations depicted in the Christmas specials are definitely not typical, but I find the very bizarre quality of them to be wholely entertaining and funny. From time to time we all have some ridiculous situation occur in our lives, but the writers of One Foot in the Grave stretch the limits to its breaking point, and provided a hilarious ride along the way. Defininitely one of Britain's funniest.",1275696000,5,532,4.911111111111111
3894514,5,B002BIULN0,"One Foot in the Grave was spread over 6 seasons, plus specials. This DVD provides only 2 specials, called ""The Christmas Specials"", but actually are not the typical Christmas special. They are two typical segments of the life of Victor and Margaret Meldrew, who face unbelievable mishap and buggery, throughout their suburban survival. 126 total minutes of laughs, mostly based upon the griping, badgering, growling, cynicism, verbal attacks by Victor, forced-retiree, who confronts head-on all of the unpleasant accidents and ridiculous atrocities of living after age 60.

Quite funny and only unrealistic due to the mountain of distress fallen upon poor Victor, some of which is caused by his own miscalculations, misguided efforts, misunderstandings, and aging infirmity. Victor is played by Richard Wilson, a role he'll never live down. He's the Grumpiest of Old Men. Victor is the World champion of smart aleck retorts. He's King Curmudgeon. The British Bard of Barbs. Just when you give up hope for something more than cynicism from Victor, he provides an oasis bit of tenderness, a note of loving affection toward his wife.

This 2 episode set is a good way to introduce to others or yourself the ""One Foot in the Grave"" series. It's like another fine British older couple series, ""As Time goes By"", also recommended, see my review. I'd recommend this set as a trial, but then you'll likely want to buy ""One Foot in the Grave: The Complete Collection"" which, by the way, includes this DVD specials disc, as well as 4 other Christmas specials, 36 episodes, and other extras.  Try ""As Time Goes By: Reunion Specials"" for a taste of that series prior to buying the complete series (again, see my review).

One Foot in the Grave is a masterpiece of convoluted plots, woven together so smoothly, that one is forgotten in the movement into another, then, when least expecting it, some silly consequence occurs from the earlier plot activity. In the end, it's all drawn together, but often leaving one tiny aspect left to the viewer's imagination. It just makes it that much more fun. My wife and I are 60+, retired, and could relate.

REPEATING, this DVD is NOT the complete set, but a delightful portion.
I would NOT recommend this for CHILDREN.
Adult humor, retiree humor, senior citizen humor, grumpy neighbor humor, side-splitting gags.",1264377600,10,2341,5.007712082262211
3894515,5,B002BIULN0,"There are two episodes on this DVD, one entitled 'Starbound' and one entitled 'Endgame'.  They represent the final pieces of the 'One Foot In The Grave' puzzle.

8361437,5,B002BIULN0,"This is a series where normally the episodes are about a half hour long.  This DVD includes 2 episodes that are more like an hour long and includes the usual mix-ups, interweaving of odd plots and circumstances, and the familiar grouch who looks at the world with anything but rose-colored glasses, Victor.  He and his wife and their (poor) neighbors endure mishap after mishap, all of which leaves you laughing out loud.  Victor putters around and gets into trouble and you think you should dislike him--and probably would if he was actually your neighbor--but you really feel how much he loves his long-suffering wife.  These two episodes include such things as a supposedly haunted caravan, their neighbor's mother apparently being taken on trips by aliens, a mistake of identity that results in a supposed kidnapping, a man who takes up residence in their shed while they are gone who turns out to be something more than what they imagined...and Victor being cheerful, scary as that is!  And that's just for starters...  This is not a show for children, but for those who love British humor, ""One Foot in the Grave"" is well worth watching.",1429488000,,1143,4.865979381443299
8361438,4,B002BIULN0,There was no episode dealing with the Christmas season on this DVD but I kept it because I enjoyed it anyway. Victor can be the neighbor from hell!,1396569600,,147,4.285714285714286
