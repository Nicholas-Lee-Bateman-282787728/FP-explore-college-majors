2389854,1,B000AM6P20,"To be clear, I love B and C horror  movies. To me, this deserved half of a star.  Yikes. Buyer/Renter beware - this has a Release date of 2013 when it is clearly made in the 60's or 70's. Gotta be careful in the digital age - even on Amazon.",1394755200,3,241,3.8
2389855,3,B000AM6P20,"This is a female vampire story. The historical background is similar to Vlad the Impaler, except it involves a baroness whose spirit is kept alive at this castle. In the basement of the castle, topless women in long loin cloths perform rituals to bongo music. Some young girls arrive at the castle unaware of the rituals. They are enticed to come to the basement through the enchanting bongo music. Here they get naked and have sex. No silicon. The vampire aspect was kept to a minimum.

Nudity, minor full frontal nudity, sex, lesbian sex, female masturbation. While this sounds pornographic, it is actually less graphic than today's soft core.",1308268800,7,645,4.91743119266055
2389856,5,B000AM6P20,"Joe Sarno was an early director of erotic films who always added a bit of psychological depth to his tales, as well as hints of perverse sex (incest is a favored topic in many of his works). We're not talking Ingmar Bergman here, but unlike many other grindhouse directors, Joe's films are elaborately plotted, well acted, and nicely shot. No blurry out of frame compositions here. Devil's Playthings exhibit many of these traits. The vampirism is left in a gray area, as we are never sure if the Countess is a real vampire, or simply acting out the influences of the cult who believe they have reincarnated her. There is implied brother/sister incest, and true to the period, writhing females painted with mystic symbols. Where are these cults, anyway? Sign me up! The film is soft core, but exudes an erotic throb, and the gals are swell. The head of the cult is one of those women who is creepily sexy. If you're looking for an offbeat piece of retro-erotica, this film will do nicely. And try other Joe Sarno works, they don't disappoint.",1178236800,16,1042,4.668478260869565
8078847,1,B000AM6P20,The Devil's Plaything IS HEAVILY CUT by 17 minutes. Do not buy this edition. It is extremely cut. The info on amazon about the running time of the film is wrong.,1470873600,,161,4.225806451612903

8078853,2,B000AM6P20,"We'll... let's see.... The good points..... 70's type drive-in movie with lots of female nudity. The bad points.... bad acting, ludicrous plot, horrible sets, and just plain awful filming.

It's a friday night movie that takes a couple of bottles of wine to enjoy! (Per person of course)",1404432000,,287,4.979166666666667
8078854,4,B000AM6P20,I found this a good B Horror movie. It is made in Europe and is a little slow and the plot is simple 500 year old dead witch wants to come back to life and a new host is needed for her soul. There is some nudity and sex and vampires and would not recommend viewing by young children. But for all it's faults I did enjoy this movie so I will let the public decide if watching this movie is worth while read the reviews then decide.,1404000000,,430,3.897727272727273

8078856,1,B000AM6P20,"Strange.  Boring.

Incomprehensible cult of mysterious spirit/vampire woman.  Not sure why.

Terrible editing. Seemed like it had been cut down.",1397433600,,144,6.05
