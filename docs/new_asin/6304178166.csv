802469,3,6304178166,I've been a big fan of this series and was over the moon to see it hit the dvd shelves. Without a hesitation I bought Series One and quickly settled down to revisit the glorious world of Mapp and Lucia. Egads!... What did they do to the transfer?? The sound level bounced all over the place and became such a distraction I hurried back to the store for a replacement. With a new copy in my dvd player I was dismayed to find the problem still plagued this grand bit of British TV. I returned it for the second time and decided some things are best left to memory. Tis a shame indeed.,1044403200,11,582,4.15929203539823
802470,5,6304178166,"Unlike so many 1980s British TV shows, which have had mediocre transfers to DVD, MAPP AND LUCIA is stunning.  Someone must have taken good care of the master tapes because these are bright, sharp, and detailed.  There is the occasional spot and scratch (most noticeably during the opening credits), but these are so much better than the VHS tapes which were released a few years ago.  Most likely, these DVDs are better than what we saw when they were originally broadcast as well.",1037232000,6,481,4.771084337349397
802471,5,6304178166,"Just a word of warning for new M&L viewers: the comedy from this series depends on the extremely eccentric cast of characters rather than pratfalls and such. As a result, a whole episode can be a set up for one very funny puchline but there are a lot of subtle jabs in between. If this sounds good to you, read on!
I have never read the book on which this series is based so I have no comment on how good the adaptation is. All I can say is I know good British humor when I see it.
Lucia is an elegant, controlling, eccentric widow who moves into the small town of Tilling. The queen of Tilling is Mapp, a dowdy spinster who keeps control of the populace through manipulation. At first, all is sweetness between the ladies and then more and more venom creeps into their actions. Before long, it is a deliciously civilized social war.
Other amusing characters include Georgie, Lucia's effeminate best friend/suitor; Quaint Irene, a zany modern artist who dresses like a boy; Diva, a silly woman who jumps sides depending on who is winning; the Wises, Mrs. Wise wears a fur coat in the middle of summer; and Major Benjy, Mapp's suitor, a military man who shouts in Hindi and is often drunk.
I found the first tape in the set to be rather dull but things picked up near the end of the second tape and by the third, I was hooked. I suggest watching the whole set before making a judgement.
One last note, I don't know who designed the costumes but they deserve an award of some sort. Each character is dressed perfectly for their personality.
Any fans of the comedy/drama (dramedy?) will find these shows to be a delight. (If you can afford it, buy both sets at once, you will be hungry for more after this)",1009584000,54,1703,4.3924050632911396
802472,5,6304178166,"I first saw this production on PBS in the eighties.  I was immediately enthralled, and I have watched it frequently ever since.  Each role is protrayed with pinpoint accuracy by each performer.  The adaptation is very close to the novel with one noticeable exception -- the absence of ""the mouse"", Evie Bartlett, the Vicar's wife.  Although I enjoy her in the books, most people will not miss her.  This boxed set is better than the second set for three reasons:  the tempo is slower and seems to fit the feel of the novel more closely, more of the detail and texture are apparent (probably related to more time), and the adaptation follows the original text far more directly.  This set encompasses ONE Lucia book; the second set covers three novels, I believe.
All considered, this is one of my most treasured possessions, and I highly recommend it.",989798400,16,851,4.7482993197278915
802473,5,6304178166,"The, er, jewels in the crown of 1980s British costume drama are generally assumed to be 'The Jewel in the Crown' and 'Brideshead Revisited'.  To these eyes, at least, the need of those serials to be scrupulously faithful to their highbrow literary sources resulted in programmes that were overlong and dramatically inert.  For me, they are superceded by the likes of 'The Irish R.M.' and 'Mapp and Lucia'.
Because these are based on so-called 'light' literature, the adapters feel freer to rework the material, to create more narratively coherent plots, to play with characters.  'Mapp and Lucia', from its glorious opening credit sequence, a diarama painting of our heroines and the coastal surroundings of Tilling, and that movingly nostalgic English waltz theme, is a beloved comic gem, an art-deco piece of period stylisation about the civilised 'war' between two dotty dames in the middle-class nouveau-rich society of a provincial backwater.
There is no attempt at period realism; rather, director McWhinnie and writer Savory adopt the modes of contemporary musical comedy and comic theatre, emphasising the artificial sets, the insane costumes, the preposterous affectations, gestures and dialogue, with which a series of glorious marionettes go through their demented, hysterically funny motions.
Because TV doesn't take the same interest in its past as cinema, the quality of the print is a little faded and grey; otherwise, make sure you watch this box-set early in the morning, because you will not be able to stop - it is more compulsive than the best suspense thrillers.",988243200,24,1583,5.273809523809524
802474,5,6304178166,"An almost word-for-word dramatisation of the hysterical book by E. F. Benson, wonderfully played.  Prunella Scales could not be better as Miss Mapp (she even has the walk down) and Geraldine MacEwan matches her as  Lucia (although physically she doesn't resemble the description of Lucia in  the book).  Made with the care and attention to detail that the British  television industry excels in, you will enjoy every moment of these tapes.  I wish they had made the other four.",964137600,12,477,4.974683544303797
802475,5,6304178166,"American sit-com actors should be forced to watch this series to see how highly trained actors can be funny without being cardboard and predictable. We all know people like Mapp and Lucia, although people like Georgie are a  little harder to come by. Of course social pretensions are meat and  potatoes to British satirists: ""Keeping Up Appearances"" being the  best example. But keep your eye on the sheer brilliance of the techniques  of this cast, right down to the smallest roles. The little town in which  this takes place is inhabited by utterly believable beings and the things  they do are equally believable. Well, perhaps floating out to sea on a  kitchen table during a flood is an exception, but the reactions of the  townsfolk are exactly what flawed mortals would display under similar  circumstances. This set is a real right-on winner: what I have to call a  Grabbit. (And yet I found some who find such sophisticated comedy not to  their taste. Well, I never!) Note: the second series somehow does not quite  live up to the standards set by this one but is still lightyears more  stylish than anything on commercial primetime.",926380800,36,1142,4.824742268041237
802476,5,6304178166,"This TV dramatisation is a superb realisation of the intense and grand rivalries of the two would-be leaders of small town society in the 1920s world of Tilling, poking fun at pretension and social rivalry. It is  difficult to believe that the leading roles of Mapp, Lucia and Georgie  could be better cast and the supporting roles all bring joy. Au reservoir.",916012800,11,360,4.790322580645161
802560,4,6304178166,"Believe me when I tell you this is the most bizarrely camp TV series you will ever witness!  Based on a series of novels by E.F. Benson and set in the seaside town of Tilling in mid-1930s middle class England ""Mapp & Lucia"" centers around two women: elegant, refined Lucia (Geraldine McEwen) and dowdy, putting-on-airs Mapp (Prunella Scales).  They are two sides of the same coin playing an extremely subtle game of one-upping each other in this very small and VERY uppity community.  Thrown into the mix is Lucia's extremely effeminate gentleman friend Georgie (Nigel Hawthorne) and a host of small-village England stereotypes: the humble vicar Rev. Bartlett, the blustery Major Benjy, the artsy-tomboy woman Quaint Irene, an extremely snooty couple Mr. and Mrs. Wyse, and Mapp's second banana Diva.
Nothing can prepare you for what you find in this show.  The pace is sometimes bizarrely slow and outrageously campy (from the costumes, mannerisms, and quirks of every single character!)  This is high-caliber middle-class snobbery at it's most rediculous, odious best.  One has to rationalize that this must be some kind of over-the-top satire on the pretensions, traditions, and mores of the middle classes.  The situations feel bizarre to us the viewers, running the gauntlet from organizing a garden party for the village, pretending to be fluent in Italian to impress a visiting countess, and going to extreme lengths to obtain a recipe for lobster!  But to the characters the implications of Mapp or Lucia's actions are a matter of life or death in this village (socially speaking).
The acting is a big part of what adds to the whole ethos of other-worldly pretentiousness.  The cast all seem to be playing their characters with a mix of the hamminess and grace.  Geraldine McEwen is beautifully over-dramatic elegance while Prunella Scales masters the art of dignified ruffled feathers.  Anyone who knows Nigel Hawthorne from the ""Yes, Minister"" series will be blown away at his transformation as the effete Georgie.  One of the more graceful touches is the show's opening music... an airy, waltz of a ditty that gets stuck in my head every time I hear it.
If you stick with this to the end, you may just see what all the fuss is about and just who will be better than the other... Mapp or Lucia?",1416268800,,2304,4.9404145077720205
802561,5,6304178166,"Geraldine McEwen is one of my favorite actresses, I have followed her from series to series and this one is fabulous. This series portrays the extravagance of the 1920's and 1930's and the fun they must have had. Cant get enough!",1413590400,,229,4.609756097560975

This rendition on film is just okay, not terrible, but cannot compare to the slow character development and nuances of the books. I found the film Lucia to be grating and wanted to give her a slap and didn't feel this way about her in the book. Georgie was perfect in the DVD, fey but not over the top. Mapp wasn't too far off and I liked Diva, too bad there wasn't more of her.

802624,4,6304178166,"Having enjoyed many a British sitcom in my day, I gave ""Mapp and Lucia"" a whirl, and I am all the better for it. The two actresses are both effective; Geraldine McEwan tends to stand out more with her regal presence, delightful fashions and her trilling vocal acrobatics (what range!), but Prunella Scales is also a delight here as the often defeated and hilariously frustrated Mapp. The one upmanship is carried to the Nth degree here, and that's the focal point. Lucia and Mapp lock horns ... but usually in the most dignified manner.

Here's one little taste of this fun:
Lucia, upon being affectionately called 'Lulu' by Mapp: ""Elizabeth dear, I must ask that you not call me such a vile name as 'Lulu'; how would you like it if I began to address you by something awful, such as 'Liblib'?""

If you're a fan of historical period series (the set dressing, the costumes, the production design), then this might be just your cup of tea. Perhaps, like yours truly, you might become very fond of the uproarious power play of ""Mapp & Lucia"". This is one series I will revisit again and again.

While the show is not 'roll on the floor' funny, its charms are many. And if you like this, I'd strongly recommend ""Jeeves & Wooster"" (more charming British comedy of manners, with delightfully sumptuous settings).",1307491200,2,1306,4.6695652173913045
802625,5,6304178166,"The episodes of this wonderful series are set in the 1920s and 30s, when most middle class women did not work; it's too bad, because that leaves main characters Elizabeth Mapp and ""Lucia"" Lucas with a primary focus of scheming to get the better of each other and outshine each other as the leader of local society ventures. They do this with hilarious and clever results.
I have always loved the EF Benson books about Mapp and Lucia. This dvd series and the sequel Mapp & Lucia: Series 2 really convey the charm and gentle humour of the books. Not unlike the cleverness of Oscar Wilde in The Importance of Being Earnest, the Mapp & Lucia series illuminate the foibles and fun that humankind is prey to. Be prepared for superb acting, excellent scripts and the magic of the original Benson characters.
Warning: Mapp & Lucia have a cult following. Don't be surprised to fall under their spell!",1301011200,,891,4.6455696202531644
802626,2,6304178166,"I've only watched the first two episodes of this series, but I have to say I am disappointed. The pace drags, and Geraldine McEwen and Nigel Hawthorne are so mannered as to be almost unwatchable. However, perhaps it will pick up as it goes along and the actors get into their roles, as another reviewer wrote. Geraldine McEwen certainly looks the part, very Erte, with a new outfit for almost every scene, and Rye is a lovely back-drop, but being shot on video gives it that very 'made for television' quality.

If you are tossing up whether to watch the series or read the books, then please read the books!",1282608000,4,608,4.527272727272727
802627,5,6304178166,"I think you may have to be a fan of the books first in order to fully appreciate this television version.  I am a HUGE fan of the E. F. Benson books so I absolutely love it. Geraldine McEwen as Lucia and Prunella Scales as Mapp are inspired choices as the leads.  They are two constantly dueling middle aged women who are in competition for being queen of the seaside English town of Tilling. Lucia has just moved there and Mapp was the dominant force until she showed up.  Lucia is accompanied by her friend Georgie, played masterfully by Nigel Hawthorne. The wardrobe given to the affluent Lucia is absolutely gorgeous, faithfully recreated for its 1930 Era.

This is a comedy of manners.  It is an up close look at people and their foibles in small town village life where the same people see one another day and day out.  It is similar to Austen's work and P.G. Wodehouse's Jeeves & Wooster. Although they are affluent enough to have cars, being out and about in the town daily on foot is the reality of daily life.  For one, they market every single day, carrying baskets for their purchases.  Obviously they are purchasing just for that day. Everyone also has servants and dines formally even though they are not rich aristocrats.  No one has a title.

Anyone who attempts remaking this series is going to be up against it. This was a dream cast which was assembled in the 1980s.  The screenplay and direction were also flawless.  I highly recommend this dvd series.

802629,5,6304178166,"About once every year, when the latest world fiasco, financial or otherwise, sets my teeth gnashing, I pop ""Mapp & Lucia"" into my DVD player and escape to the social whirl of Tilling-On-Sea of the 1930s. There can be no better restorative than the delicious rivalry between the oh-so-elegant Emmiline Lucas, aka Lucia (Geraldine McEwan), and the oh-so-proper Elizabeth Mapp (Prunella Scales). Aiding and abetting Lucia's schemes for village supremacy is the oh-so-fussy Georgie Pilson (Nigel Hawthorn), who engages in various activities with her--all of them innocuous--including painting, pretending to speak Italian, and playing duets on their musical evenings (nicknamed in their precious ""Italian"" manner, ""Po di Mues"").

As the saccharine smiles of the female protagonists send the fur flying, the laughs keep coming in this high comedy of manners. The cloche hats and embroidered silk dresses make for splendid viewing, as do the seamless performances of McEwan, Scales, and Hawthorne. The other Tilling eccentrics include a tippling Major Benjie (late of the Raj), the misnamed Diva (who has no pretensions to being queen of the village), the pipe-smoking artist Quaint Irene, the monocled Colonel Wise and his wife (Marion Mathie--otherwise Hilda Rumpole), and a priest from Manchester who, for reasons unknown, speaks with a Scottish accent.

Tilling-on-Sea is really the Sussex town of Rye--a cobble-stoned village rising out of the Romney Marsh. With its Mermaid Tavern (rebuilt in 1425), Rye is so charming that I once stayed a week, enjoying merely `being there'. ""Mapp and Lucia"" allows me to revisit Rye and the Romney Marsh, to forget the turbulent present, and to lose myself in several hours of sheer delight.",1240704000,6,1727,5.369003690036901

Recently I decided to purchase the DVD sets of the series.  I am so glad I did.  Watching them over and over has provided me with great enjoyment.

Costumes are period perfect, even a bit over the top, but are a delight to look at.  Georgie dresses splendidly.  Lucia never misses a beat with her outfits.  The interiors and gardens are picture perfect and such a pleasant thing to see.  The English villages are perfectly crafted to match our daydreams.

To truly enjoy this series, you should commit to the complete series (1 and 2), add them to your CD library, and watch them over and over again. Here is England post-WWI, perhaps at the dusk of refined living by individuals and couples who appeared to have no profession other than the good life with servants, plenty of time and money, and magnificent large saloons to drive about the pastoral English countryside. The snobbery, scarcasims, put-ons, and put-downs are all good fun to watch. Times were indeed good for those with means; life would profoundly change when the Depression struck.

At the outset, it's true, both Lucia and Georgie, with their baby talk, may seem too over the top, too precious to endure over five episodes. But such a worry is quickly put to rest, and by the time, early in Episode 1, when Lucia and her chum Georgie motor to the seaside village of Tilling in search of summer rentals, as characters they've become wonderfully infectious.

The town of Tilling itself features an equally remarkable collection of British eccentrics, most of whom tolerate each other's oddities engagingly, and who grow as well upon the affections of the viewer. Major Benjy, Mr. and Mrs. Wise, Quaint Irene and company are quite a memorable crew.

What we have in the representation of Tilling is essentially the vision of Jane Austen, but on vacation here from true comic seriousness, and reveling instead in the amusingly farcical. People's foibles are presented, for the most part, as endearing rather than diminishing of their characters. Malice goes no further than the stealing of a recipe. Disaster threatens only when the chief women characters are swept out to sea, ludicrously enough, aboard a kitchen table. This is a series that can be viewed again every so often with great pleasure.

Characterizations in this series are outstanding, from the ever affable Georgie, to the lesbian artist in love with Lucia and itching to frustrate Mapp, to the always drunk Captain who marries Mapp only to have her take out her every frustration on the poor sod.

802792,4,6304178166,I find this series of Mapp & Lucia very entertaining and relaxing viewing.  It is of course not to everybody's liking. But for those who like this tongue in cheek type of writing I recomend this whole heartedly.,1121731200,6,211,4.552631578947368
802793,5,6304178166,"A wonderful comedy of errors, Mapp and Lucia are the perfect, gentile and polite enemies. This is essentially the story of two bored and wealthy women, one a dyed in the wool, stickler for convention (Scales), the other a social climbing, bohemian, bright, slighty older, thing (McKewan).

 Sheltering in the tranqulity of an English Seaside village during the early 1930's, the two head for a war of words and culture when one rents a summer home form the other and imposes her bohemia upon the stuffy residents of the village.

 Hilarious, deliciously gentile and throat raspingly bitchy at once. The lead actors are fabulous and their rich, silly accents add to the humour! The village set and costumes are stunning, particularly McKewan's page boy hair do and fabulous, flowing, flapper outfits, which add to her bohemia and almost constant upper hand.",1121472000,6,856,5.049645390070922
802794,5,6304178166,"I have only recently made the acquaintance of Mrs. Emmeline ""Lucia"" Lucas and Miss Elizabeth Mapp, but must enthusiastically share that I have found their company nothing short of intoxicating!  The rapier wit and biting repartee exchanged between the two leading ladies is brilliant and extremely diverting.  I particularly adore the incomparably divine Geraldine McEwan as the benignly crafty Lucia, with her overblown use of Italian, insistence on ""La Musica"" [i.e., her piano recitals after each dinner party she hosts], and endless plots to subvert the Queen Motherhood of Tilling's [the seaside town in which the series is set] social scene from under the domineering Mapp's nose.  Prunella Scales is noteworthy as well, acting the frustrated Mapp to a tee.

Also delightful is the late, great Nigel Hawthorne playing the effete dilettante Georgie Pillson, Lucia's closest confidante and unfailing supporter.  The two dear friends (Lucia and her precious ""Georgino mio"") have their own share of scuttles, which are amusing as well.  The supporting cast -- the Major, Quaint Irenie, Godiva, the Padre, the servants -- are excellently played and only add to the fun as Lucia and Mapp cordially battle for pre-eminence.

Anyone who appreciates superb writing and classic wit will be sure to share my exuberance over this small-screen adaptation of Mapp & Lucia -- so for now, as they say in Tilling, AU RESERVOIR!",1119916800,7,1416,5.238938053097345
802795,5,6304178166,"Have you ever lost your own support or standing to a person who gets away with very naughty behavior? Who cheats or bullies her way to the top? Who gets away with it because you both work or live in an oh-so-polite system in which no one dares confront dishonest behavior?

Then you will love this DVD. Lucia, the newcomer who has already been stolen from by Miss Mapp when she arrives in town, settles in to manage the quirky town's social scene. On the surface, all is polite and gracious, but underneath, strong currents flow. Mapp is determined to see Lucia fail, and Lucia, subject to her own moral failings, manages to come out many times on top, and in such a gracious way that Mapp is not publicly humiliated; sometimes only Mapp and Lucia know they have locked horns, and both know who has won.

Costuming, especially Lucia's, is fabulous. The location is the village of Rye in southern England, a charming place in every way.

There are 5 episodes in this set. Having seen the series years ago, I put the first episode in and invited someone to join me in watching. He was a bit bored, because in truth it was a little slow.  It took me awhile to convince him to watch #2.  It picked up speed. #3 and #4 rolled right along. #4 ends with a cliff-hanger (really more of a table-hanger), and #5 is full of surprises for the whole town.  Get this DVD and be patient with it; then you'll want the second series!",1119139200,6,1416,4.385496183206107
802796,5,6304178166,"I can't recommend these DVDs more highly.  Comedy is rarely acted as well as this.  The relationship between Lucia (Geraldine McEwan) and Georgie (Nigel Hawthorne) is perfect and develops throughout the two series.  There is such understanding between the players and rewatching is necessary to pick up every nuance of expression.

The author, E F Benson, is responsible for the brilliantly drawn characters and the social situations which produce the best humour - who else could have made such delightful fun out of Lucia's fear of being exposed as a non-Italian speaker? - but the production is also highly commendable.

One thing that I would draw attention to, that I haven't seen mentioned in other reviews, is Jim Parker's wonderfully witty musical score which catches the spirit perfectly: look out for the opera snippets in the last episode which are a wonderful pastiche based on the program's theme tune.  Also Dennil Lill (Major Benjy) is a brilliant drunk.",1115164800,5,969,5.10126582278481
802797,5,6304178166,"Mapp and Lucia was the well-mannered but determined combatants of Tilling-on-the-Sea and at stake is nothing less than to crown of Queen Bee of TOTS!  Mapp has rules the tiny hamlet with an iron fist as lady of the village and has everyone dancing to her tune, until Lucia enters the pictures.  Lucia has come to summer in Tilling-in-the-Sea.  Mapp has rented out her less than humble abode to Lucia, but still wants to hold control of the house and the village.  Lucia, however, sees as this as her chance to bring class to the tiny village of eccentrics.  A battle to the death - literally - well, almost.

It's based on E.F. Benson's stories and is loving brought to life under the talented performance of Prunella Scales (Mrs. Fawlty in Fawtly Towers) as Lucia and Geraldine McEwan star as Mapp.

It's Brit Com at it's very best.",1103068800,5,833,4.587837837837838
802798,5,6304178166,"Set in 1930 in the English Cotswolds, this 1984 production (which is presented on two boxed sets with five 50-minute episodes per set) is a slightly quirky British drawing-room comedy revolving around two domineering women, both used to being ""top dog"" in their respective communities, who end up residing in the same small village of Tilling.  Miss Elizabeth Mapp is the current resident, whose position at the centre of her small society is threatened by the flash, air-assuming newcomer, Mrs. Emily Lucas (""Lucia"", as she prefers to be called).
Geraldine McEwan (Mulberry, Barchester Chronicles) is impeccably cast as the wealthy, elegant, widow Lucia, a woman with a strong personality and a flair for the dramatic.  Her vocabulary is peppered with the Italian, a language in which she is only too happy to let others think she is fluent.  She provides (at least initially) a little spice, excitement, and mystique for the villagers in humdrum Tilling.  But she is also a woman who knows well how to get what she wants, and her grace, smiles, and impeccable manners belie a shrewd and cunning mind.
Mapp (Fawlty Towers' Prunella Scales) is a somewhat dowdy, unwealthy spinster, not to mention an insufferable busybody.  So it is no wonder she is less than thrilled that Lucia, having decided to leave her home in Riseholme for pastures new, has set her sights on Mapp's terrain.  But Mapp, though lacking Lucia's elegance, wealth, and marital status, is not willing to relinquish her position without a fight.  Watching the episodes (which are serial in nature) is a bit like watching a game of chess between unequals.  In essence, each woman, with an abundance of outward grace and politeness, seeks to establish (or reassert) her position by bringing the other down a peg or two.  Lucia is clearly cleverer and at times seems to toy with Mapp as a cat does with a mouse.  But Mapp is nothing if not determined and we wonder is she will, after all, succeed in toppling the grand Lucia.
As for a few of the other characters:  Lucia is joined by her devoted friend Georgie (Yes (Prime) Minister's Nigel Hawthorne), a rather effeminate, toupee-sporting chap who enjoys painting and petit point.  She is also adored by Quaint Irene, a trouser-wearing, cigar-smoking, eccentric local artist who doesn't hesitate to speak her mind and thoroughly enjoys watching the sparring match between Mapp and Lucia.  There's also the gruff, masculine, and perennially intoxicated Major Benjy, whose habit of summoning servants with a bellowing ""quay-hi"" does not endear him to them.  Mapp's closest friend is a dowdy and rather timid woman named Diva, to whom Mapp is less than kind at times.
In conclusion, albeit a tad quirky at times (like the time the two rivals get swept out to sea on the kitchen table!), I would recommend this series to anyone looking for a delightful, relaxing, and gently humorous drawing-room comedy.  It is dialogue-based (as opposed to physical) comedy.  In other words, if you're looking for pratfalls, action, hard laughs, or a fast-paced, in-your-face comedy, then you'd best look elsewhere.  The pace here is leisurely, the dialogue is deliciously witty and intelligent, and the humour wonderfully subtle, with often as much conveyed through body language--be it the raising of an eyebrow, the sharp intake of breath, or the tensing of a muscle--as through words itself.",1078012800,13,3392,5.0285714285714285
802799,4,6304178166,"These two discs contain five episodes of a faithful 1984 British television adaptation of one of EF Benson's comic novels.  The book is set in a seaside village during the 1920s, where social butterfly Mapp is loathe to part with her hold over Tilling's residents when proto-diva Lucia comes to town.  The tortured machinations of the two women is very funny and, as usual, the sets and costumes are lovely.
The dvd set is ultra-minimal!  Not even cast and crew info.  Nothing.",1067040000,2,477,4.780487804878049

This series brings to the screen the wonderful personalities and eccentricities of the cast of characters who inhabit the village of Tilling On The Sea. Competing for the reigning title are Miss Mapp and Miss Lucia. I have read the novels and can say that the rendering for the screen is perfect. The flavor and fun of the books are fully preserved. This is a must have for fans of British social comedy.
I had both series one and two on VHS, and was thrilled to find that series one was released on DVD, as I am moving away from tape media. Now, my only question is, when will series two be released on DVD.",1065312000,7,710,4.227941176470588
802801,5,6304178166,"I'm a fan of the E.F. Benson books that form the basis for this series. The highlight of my trip to England a few years ago was visiting the charming town of Rye (called Tilling in the Lucia books), where Benson lived and this series was filmed. But I must say that I like the TV production, thanks to the inspired comic performances, even more than the books.

In particular, Geraldine McEwan (also in Barchester Chronicles) is exquisite. Her little comic mannerisms are absolutely hilarious, and she makes the character endearing in a way that I never thought possible. Again, ""inspired"" is the only appropriate word.

The same with the much-missed Nigel Hawthorne's Georgie. Absolutely perfect casting. And Prunella Scales (of Fawlty Towers fame) bites into her less-sympathetic role of Mapp and does not let go until she wrings every last laugh from it. As is particularly true for British series, the supporting cast is also excellent at bringing their own eccentric characters to life in just a few brushstrokes.

I was very much looking forward to the Mapp and Lucia DVD, because I had not seen this series since it was televised in the mid-1980s. I'm happy to say that the DVD quality is excellent, and my opinion of the series has only elevated through time. Many British comedies have come and gone in the years since Mapp and Lucia, but it remains the most delightful, in my book.

As other reviewers have mentioned, the series is highly addictive, so after enjoying this one you'll likely want to immediately buy the second series, also available on DVD.",1051920000,65,1566,4.832089552238806
