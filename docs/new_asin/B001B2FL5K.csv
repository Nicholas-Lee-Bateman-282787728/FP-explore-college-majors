3479922,5,B001B2FL5K,"Finally there is a DVD on the market that deals with heavy bag workouts for the street. Every other DVD I have seen out there deals with the heavy bag for sport fighting. In this DVD, Mr. Franco shows how to use the heavy bag to maximize speed and power for delivering fight ending compound attacks on the street. This comprehensive production covers everything from the proper height level for the bag to strengthening the hands for punching. The disorientation drill is awesome. To be able to replicate the lightheadedness of getting hit and being able to keep fighting is priceless. This is an absolute gem for anyone that is serious about punching with speed and power in a street fight.",1213747200,20,691,4.7190082644628095

3479926,5,B001B2FL5K,"I spent three years in high school doing kickboxing, and always dreaded using the heavy bag. Our instructor just assumed that we knew how to use it well. If this DVD had been around then, I wouldn't have dreaded using it, but would have looked forward to it. Sammy teaches you effective methods to incorporate the heavy bag into your routine. He also goes into choosing a good heavy bag and provides tips when setting it up. If you own a heavy bag, or are thinking about purchasing one, definitely get this DVD.",1415232000,,511,4.505376344086022
3479927,5,B001B2FL5K,"The most practical efficient heavy bag training resource available. Not only covers safety but ways of strengthening oneself to avoid common injuries. As other reviewers have already mentioned, this is NOT your typical Boxing style training approach. Simply put---No Fluff..No B.S. Thanks again Mr. Franco!!!

3479928,2,B001B2FL5K,The DVD did not give an explanation - just showed how to kick box and defend oneself. I thought it was a training programme for using a bag!!!!!,1399852800,,144,4.178571428571429
3479929,4,B001B2FL5K,The DVD is good quality and is informative. Description is accurate. My only complaint is I wish more was devoted to solo drills.  All in all I have liked all the DVDs I have purchased from CFA thus far.,1386979200,,203,4.205128205128205

3479933,5,B001B2FL5K,Excellent DVD that provides an assortment of boxing techniques that is suitable for someone just starting out to someone who has been hitting the heavy bag for quite awhile such as myself. I think anyone who is interested in hitting the heavy bag can benefit from this DVD. Good instructions that can be utilized immediately. Well worth the investment!,1366848000,,352,4.983050847457627

3479935,5,B001B2FL5K,"Ive been looking for an instuctional dvd to use my heavy bag in a practical real world way.  This is defitaly it.  I like the way it focuses on not the boxing ring but rather how to use on the street. very comprehensiveand easy to understand.  I have added this to my regular exersise routine a few days a week.  It has made me more confident that I not only have more  just gym strenghth, but now the skills use it if God forbide I ever need it.  I would recomend anyone looking to learn pratical uses of there heavy bag to purchase this dvd.",1365897600,2,543,4.123809523809523
3479936,5,B001B2FL5K,"Most of us buying a ""How To"" DVD have some basic skills and knowledge about the equipment and how to use it.
Here is an example of going farther than just the typical - jab, straight right, left hook and repeat type workout.
The training here can be taken into the real world and extend into real self defense.
Of course, the heavy bag is one of the best forms of training, but there can be more than just hammering away at the bag with no purpose.
This DVD bridges that gap.
Finally, another needed addition to the thin world of quality training DVD's for boxing/self defense.
Five Stars!",1365379200,,589,4.412844036697248
3479937,5,B001B2FL5K,"I've wanted to pick up training on heavy bag work but didn't want to focus on traditional boxing where a clinch doesn't matter or is even considered which is unrealistic.  So because of that, I've seen an alignment to MMA punching where it focuses less on 100s of punches to a smaller set.  What's more is that it focuses on developing equal punching power for both arms.

Elbows?  Headbutts?  Deadly tools that make sense to incorporate which makes this DVD a good one, because it's focused on ""Heavy Bag Training"", and not boxing.

I've lost some weight since starting this, which was another reason why I looked at this type of training.  It also gives lots of applicable drills for those who train individually or with a sparring partner.  I've seen it dozens of times to learn & apply each technique.  No ninjas roping down from the ceiling or anything.

Thumbs up!",1362355200,4,870,4.6644736842105265
3479938,5,B001B2FL5K,"I scavenged Amazon looking for a heavy bag training dvd. Surprisingly, they are hard to find. While expensive, I believe I paid $34.99 for it, it gives a basic over view of how to start off from the beginning training and is easy to understand. I wish I had actually purchased before purchasing some equipment as it would have helped me make more informed purchasing decisions.",1359936000,2,377,4.7272727272727275
3479939,1,B001B2FL5K,"Save your money, I cant believe I wasted $30.00 on this DVD. You can get better information off UTube. Video looks like it was filmed with a phone.

The only thing I should have punched was myself in the face for buying it.",1359504000,5,355,4.235294117647059
3479940,5,B001B2FL5K,"I've recently begun training in CFA and I got the DVD to assist me in my home training on the heavy bag.  The video was definitely helpful for me as a beginner in setting up my heavy bag properly (actually went through 2 sets of bolt cutters cutting the chains) and then developing the drills to perfect my technique.  I could see this being a great resource for someone training at home on their own, but it's also a great compliment to my actual CFA training.",1357257600,3,461,4.348837209302325
3479941,5,B001B2FL5K,"I have spent alot of time looking around on youtube for ideas on heavybag training.  Most of them are geared towards sports competition.  This dvd goes beyond just how to throw your basic punches on a heavy bag, it gives drills that will train attributes needed for a fight outside of the ring.  For example, specific drills on how to work on a continuous punching drill for an extended time to simulate giving it your all for as long as possible instead of trying to pace yourself for a 3 minute round as in boxing.  Other drills include (but not limited to) punching combinations, and moving while striking.

If you are looking for something different to your workout I would suggest this dvd and the ebook manual that you can also purchase with this dvd.

As with all of Mr. Franco's products, I have been very happy with the purchase!",1355270400,,838,4.553333333333334
3479942,4,B001B2FL5K,"By far one of the best, straight forward, and all round user friendly heavy bag training DVDs.

3479945,5,B001B2FL5K,"I knew something was missing from my sport boxing classes, those instructors were teaching me how to tiptoe around a fight and be overly passive.  That is NOT how I saw real world fighting.  Fortunately, I found Sammy Franco's heavy bag DVD and can finally properly prepare myself for street fighting.  It shows you how to property engage the bag and demonstrates how different students with different body types attack the bag. Seeing how hard those guys are attacking inspires me during my practices and helps me push through and dig deep.  A great help for me was Sammy's section on developing forearm strength!!  This had made all the difference in everything I do.  The strength and confidence that I continue to develop (thanks to this DVD) is priceless.  Thanks Sammy!",1355184000,,775,4.870229007633588
3479946,5,B001B2FL5K,"Most of the dvd's refer to boxing only when it comes to heavy bag training.  The reality base of this dvd is awesome, It is very usefull for street fighting.  I am glad I bought this dvd and my performance improve a lot.  I recommend it even if you have martial arts background..",1355184000,,279,4.226415094339623
3479947,2,B001B2FL5K,"The DVD arrived on time and is a good quality video recording. The information is mostly accurate but it contains nothing you can't already find on YouTube. The style displayed is kickboxing.

I had many issues with this DVD.

1. Few techniques. There were 4 punches, an elbow strike, and the head butt. No kicks are covered; and well-timed, low kicks are absolutely essential for success in ""street fighting"".
2. The disorientation drill is not disorienting to a nominally experienced Martial Artist.
3. Hand position can only be clearly seen once, during the ""ground fighting"" section - and if you punch like this you *will* break your hand. (The video shows a student punching with the three knuckles on the outside of his hand, instead of the stronger first two knuckles).
4. Self defense application is minimal. He begins with the assumption that you will only ever want to strike to the head.
5. The section on combinations doesn't suggest any combinations. Inventing combo's is left as an exercise for the viewer.
6. Two sections were particularly awful - the 3-man Proficiency Drill was a farce where three guys stood around the punching bag and they would all strike it in sync. Useless. Also the ""ground fighting"" section instructed students to lay the punching bag on the ground, take up (an extremely poorly-formed) mount position, and reverse punch to the face in a timed, metronome-like sequence. If you do this you *will* go to jail. There are actually some things you can do with a punching bag to improve your ground game, but he doesn't mention them at all.

I have trained with guys who fight like this (my teacher called it the ""swing your arms like an insane monkey"" strategy) and let me tell you... they can't cover to save their lives and they wear out quick. Getting hit feels nothing like spinning around in a circle, and a ""street fight"" against someone who knows even the basics of a traditional martial art like karate or jujitsu is over in seconds.

This DVD can be summed up as: Buy a punching bag. Train with the punching bag 3 times a week. Here is a pittance of upper-body strikes you can use. Now here's a bunch of random footage of my students making up their own drills using only the aforementioned handful of strikes.

If you want to lose weight or get out some random aggression, this is a great tool but... You're not going to become a pro fighter by haphazardly punching a heavy bag for a few weeks. If you want to develop strength, speed and some usable skills there are many better products out there.",1354752000,15,2544,4.669642857142857
3479948,5,B001B2FL5K,"Mr. Franco does it again. He has created a dvd for the average guy who simply wants ""nuts and bolts"" information on how to use the Heavy Bag to improve his chances in coming out on top in a dangerous ""kill or be killed"" street situation. This dvd contains simple, effective, and efficient training information that anyone can begin to implement into their training without having to have the athletic abilities of a professional or amateur boxer or MMA fighter.

I purchased another dvd from Mr. Franco a while ago entitled ""Ground Fighting in the Streets."" I have a background in BJJ with the Gracies, but when I decided to begin teaching my son ground fighting, I wanted to teach him just the practical skills necessary to survive and the ones that really work. For the past year and a half, we have been training only the basics as outlined in the ""Ground Fighting in the Streets"" dvd and my son (who is now 12) is extremely capable of handling himself.

Now that I want to add striking to my son's training, I went back to the one source I trust for practical, no bull information. I plan to spend the next year or so teaching my son striking techniques and drills explained on the ""Heavy Bag Training"" dvd and I'm sure the results will once again speak for themselves.

Most individuals who want to improve any aspect of their fighting skill set would be best advised to do two things first and foremost: master the basics until they become automatic and only practice those skills and techniques that can be used in the street: ""When hell comes to breakfast."" This is my philosophy and apparently Mr. Franco agrees.

If you are looking for training dvd's devoted to ""where the rubber hits the road"" philosophy of fighting and self-defence, Mr. Franco's are a hell of a place to start.",1321574400,2,1790,4.601880877742946
3479949,5,B001B2FL5K,"This is a ""must have"" DVD if you want to train on a heavy bag.  It covers all the bases...First: what type of bag, how heavy, height of bag, gloves etc.
Second: How to hit the bag. I didn't have this video before I got my bag.....I nearly broke my hands because of improper technique.  Sammy explains how to properly execute each type of strike.  This is extemely valuable. Third: how to train on a heavy bag. When I first got my  heavy bag mounted,  I quickly put on my gloves and proceded to pound the bag with reckless abandon...after about 45 seconds...huffing and puffing....with hurting hands, wrists, and elbows I gave up.  Sammy Franco describes different routines for different experience levels that allow you to progressively improve your technique and fitness level.  Lastly, I really like the emphasis on using the heavy bag to train for real life self defense situations...I don't want to train to dance...I want to train to defend myself.  This is the DVD for heavy bag training for self defense.",1321488000,19,1011,4.7371428571428575
3479950,5,B001B2FL5K,"Sammy Franco dose pretty good job on describing and showing proper hitting mechanics for the heavy bag. Even if have you have no interest in learning self defense, the dvd is still a must for anyone who has no or little experience with heavy bag.  Included are different types of strengthening exercises also the dvd is pretty good at describing what to look for when purchasing a heavy bag and the type drills you can do for training.

If you are new to training I would also reccomend his punching and footwork audio books. The audio books is a very good companion piece to this dvd, as it is more indepth about technique for punching and movement drills. I have used these products togeather for a while now and am getting excellent results.

8281477,3,B001B2FL5K,"The video is quite informative.  It gives tips on how to choose a heavy bag, the height at which it should be, the pros and cons for canvas vs. leather bags and comments on the BOB punching bag, followed by instruction on how to do punches and most everything else a beginning boxer would need to know.  I would even recommend watching and practicing a few times before going to a gym so you at least have the basics.

That said, the production value is zero.  If this guy is so talented and well-respected in his field, couldn't he have found a sponsor? Or did he not want to spend his money on something that looked presentable?  It looks as though it was filmed on a phone in his basement, really. There are titles that announce the next move which is excellent -- you know what's coming up -- but they last much too long on the screen.  The title is short enough that 1 second would have been enough.

I agree with some of the other reviewers that everything that's on this video you can find on YouTube, however, everything is included right here for you in one CD instead of having to go through search after search.  It's time that the price went down though.",1451088000,3,1166,4.341013824884793
