8319259,5,B001LOIA1U,"Benny Meng knows how to give in clear and concise manner a full explanation, without getting bogged down into details. He manage to keep the fine line between what you need to know about the concept as well application, so you can add this to your own training.",1448928000,,261,4.458333333333333
8319260,2,B001LOIA1U,"Meng goes to fast through the material. If it wasn't for having learned some of the basics via YouTube videos, posted by other teachers, I would have been completely lost.",1399593600,,171,4.733333333333333
8319261,1,B001LOIA1U,"This guy is a faker!! Calls himself ""GM"" of WIng Chun, when NOT even the VTAA doesn't even agree with this guy! anyone who buys this does not even know what they are buying.",1392854400,,173,4.117647058823529
8319262,5,B001LOIA1U,"goes over all the basics and explains things well, applications are done very well, I only wish there were more drills but the ones shown are good basic ones.",1356134400,,158,4.482758620689655
8319263,5,B001LOIA1U,"For a relatively nominal price compared to other Wing Chun DVD's of similar and lesser caliber, this is an excellent instructional video. I have Sifu David Petersen's DVD on the first form and, although the quality of instruction is equivalent, Petersen's DVD is plagued with background noise. I now intend to buy Benny Meng's entire DVD series. They will make excellent book ends to Petersen's DVD series covering the same material. With both sets, I think someone would be hard pressed to find more comprehensive teaching without the aid of a skilled Sifu being present. Price to quality evaluation: this is a keeper.",1305244800,13,619,5.019417475728155
8319264,5,B001LOIA1U,"I hold a black belt in Goju Ryu and have studied martial arts for a few decades now.  I own a great number of instructional DVDs about various martial arts.  This DVD on Sil Nim Tao by Benny Meng is one of the best I've come across (as are the next two in the series covering the next two forms in the Wing Chun system)!

It has the essentials, good clear filming of the form, well lit, and professionally done. Benny Meng obviously has the physical skills to do what he's doing.

But what makes this video stand out from many others is the quality of the verbal instruction that accompanies the demonstration of the form and the techniques that are shown.  Benny Meng spends a lot of time explaining exactly what the point of each movement of the form is and its relevance within the philosophy of the Wing Chun system.

Many other instructional DVDs on martial arts will just show you the form or some techniques, and leave you to figure out what it means or how it fits within the system, or at best they will give you a very superficial explanation.  But this DVD by Benny Meng is a step above many others because of the quality and thoroughness of the accompanying verbal instruction.

Excellent!",1262649600,24,1201,4.4520547945205475
