3444733,5,B0019Z3P5W,"If vitriolic politics, personal cunning, and social hostility were made any more entertaining, this film would be the 'feelgood comedy of the decade.' As is, it is a beautiful view of human nature at work in the democratic process in China. Most amazing is how 9-year-old school children in China seem to have written Carl Rove's, Barak Obama's, Sara Palin's, and George Bush's political playbooks. A great film that is as informative as it is enjoyable.",1249430400,3,454,4.9868421052631575
3444734,4,B0019Z3P5W,"Unusual in the sense that these true-to-life people seem to be living in some kind of Chinese paradise--complete with pristine streets, sensitive teachers, a modern tram, lots of good food, stylish clothes, American slang and some latent appreciation of democratic values.  From an entertainment perspective, these kids and their parents are truly a hoot!  Recommended.",1245628800,3,369,5.6909090909090905
3444735,5,B0019Z3P5W,"Director Weijun Chen did a great job in this documentary.  The film was about the democracy experiment in a third grade class of one primary school in WuHan, China.  I don't know the reasons for Chen to pick WuHan for this documentary.  I was told by Chinese friends, WuHan is a relatively conservative city comparing to Bejing or Shanghai.  This documentary has quite a few interesting aspects.  First, the film truly recorded this democracy experiment did not educate kids about the value of democracy, but was about the process to win the voting.  Second, the kids' voting soon became parent's battle.  I was amazed to see those tricks that parents taught to their kids.  For example, one kid's mother told her kid to boo his competitors after their speeches.  Third, debate became personal attacks.  I was shocked to see class teacher let these personal attacks go on as normal.  The scene seemed like a mini version of culture revolution happened to those kids.  At last, bribe.  One kids' father is supervisor of police department.  He treated the entire class for a city trip.  He also prepared gifts for the entire class just before the voting.  The film helped me understand today's China better.  And, the film was also very entertaining.",1241136000,25,1248,4.866666666666666
3444736,5,B0019Z3P5W,"I originally watched this film on NetFlix on a whim.  When I finished up, I came here to Amazon and had to order a copy for myself.  This could be one of the cutest, funniest and charming doc films I've seen since Mad Hot Ballroom.  You not only see the differences in our cultures, but the vast similarities as well.  Simply put, this is by far one of my favorite films.  You will not be disappointed.  The three children they picked couldn't be more different yet, they will absolutely entertain you in their own way.",1240099200,3,519,4.410526315789474
3444737,5,B0019Z3P5W,"I came across this film on netflix and watched it on my computer for the first time.  I lived in China teaching English for a year so the film caught my attention.  I was absolutely captivated.  It's an interesting insight into Chinese education.  But also, we see the result of the one child policy - a nation of ""little emperors.""  I had to have this film to share with my students here in America.  I only wish it were longer than an hour.",1237334400,14,442,4.265060240963855
3444738,5,B0019Z3P5W,"I showed this film to my third grade class, as part of a study in what democracy is and isn't. I have watched it about four times now, and each time with a more critical eye towards democracy and the Chinese government, who I think wouldn't have let the film be made without the results achieved. Funny and thoughtful.",1227398400,,318,4.406779661016949
3444739,5,B0019Z3P5W,"Politics isn't that different for Chinese as it is for Americans - at least in Grade 3

Talk about timing! 2008 is the Olympics in China and the Presidential election in the US. Combining both the fascination with Chinese culture, especially how it is moving into more democracy and western culture, with the concept of a ""last man wins"" election, Chinese Director Weijun Chen has created a real ""nail biter"". Which of the three candidates will win in their run for office? Who will bribe the most voters? And who will cheat? Oh, and let's not forget: Who will cry when they are called names.

Yes, this is the story of a real election, but it's not a Presidential one. This is the first free election in Wuhan province and it is for ....... the class monitor of the third grade class at Wuhan Elementary School. With two boys and one girl - chosen by their teacher as candidates - Chen captures the events in real time. We she the parents (or ""parent"" in the case of the single-parent child) guiding them. But it's interesting to see the tactics that the candidates develop for themselves.

The film is a short 58 minutes and there are no extras (except for the ""Trailer"" which is nothing more than a compilation  of scenes from the film). It's in Mandarin with easy to read English subtitles.

Personally, I'd like to know the ""backstory"" of this film and how Chen chose to make it but, on its own, this short film will definitely hold your attention and show you that, though we think we're different from other cultures, when it comes to politics we're not that much different, some candidates are just older!

3444740,5,B0019Z3P5W,"I found this film disturbing, because it illustrates starkly how foreign a concept democracy has become to the chinese. This film follows an election campaign for class monitors/prefects in a chinese primary school, and there is a scene where the teacher struggles to explain what a democracy is, and the children at first struggle to understand the concept of voting for their leaders. Once they get into their stride however, the insults and backstabbing really take off amongst the candidates! So, much like any british general election! This is a very inciteful documentary into the difficulties the chinese may face in moving towards a democratic future, but there are moments of sheer joy for the viewer.",1368576000,3,710,5.129310344827586
3444741,5,B0019Z3P5W,"Shows that a movie about PEOPLE first is and will always be better than a souped up Hollywood million dollar movie about NOTHINGNESS, bangs, bright lights, loud music, etc.

If you like seeing other cultures, real interaction of people, and REAL character develop this movie is for you.

The movie shows you democracies flaws through it competitive nature.  As many individuals' spirits are probably more broken down than lifted through it's competitive nature.  What's cool is it's in a society that is more socialist than democratic so you see how people react.  The Chinese kids reactions are VERY much how any human would act from any culture when being allowed the opportunity for some kind of power.  They do mean and horrible things to each other to take some form of control over each other.  The surprise is who wins the election.  Though none of the candidates should really win and are probably not good for the system, the one who can keep control rather than innovate and create something for streamlined wins.  And that rings true in democratic societies.  The leaders usually just keep the wheels turning and reap the benefits for themselves.

A GREAT movie!!!  Especially if you love kids, real movies that make you think, and things about things of the world such as democracy, China, and people interaction.",1366848000,,1325,4.918918918918919
3444742,4,B0019Z3P5W,I enjoyed the movie even though I had to read the English subtitles.  My wife is Chinese and could of course understand the Mandarin.  We both laughed out loud several times and enjoyed the movie even though it was more of a documentary than a movie. Just and enjoyable relaxing movie.,1364688000,,285,4.568627450980392
3444743,5,B0019Z3P5W,"I use this movie for my AP Comparative government class.  The kids love it.  It starts with a 3rd grade girl being asked what it is to vote.  She says ""Vote?"" the exchange is hilarious.  What a great movie, watch it you'll enjoy it.  I still wonder what has happened to those kids.",1360540800,,281,4.226415094339623
3444744,5,B0019Z3P5W,"The vocabulary, enthusiasm, politicking (including dirty tricks), and focus of all the students in this third-grade class, from the three nine/ten-year old Class Monitor candidates to all the non-candidates, was incredible. Each candidate participated in a talent show and a debate, as well as giving a prepared speech (mostly without notes). The action took place in 2007 Wuhan (about 420 miles West of Shanghai), the most populous city (about 10 million) in Central China. The film covers what was supposedly the first election of its type in a Chinese school. (Traditionally the Class Monitor was appointed by the teacher.)

If these children are anywhere near typical, American education is in worse shape than we think! The film also evidenced very strong parental involvement, as well as the large class size (about 40 pupils).",1327276800,3,833,5.2631578947368425
3444745,3,B0019Z3P5W,"""Please Vote For Me"" is an entertaining, engaging, and short documentary about a democratic election in a Chinese elementary school. All the strengths and weaknesses of democratic elections are on display. The documentary has the best qualities of reality show competitions: drama, raw emotion, suspense, and humor.

The documentary focuses on an election for class monitor in a small school in Wuhan, China. From a sociological perspective, it's quite jarring to see Chinese talking about elections and campaigns.

3444747,5,B0019Z3P5W,"i am a documentary watcher (i don't like fiction), and i would say this movie is on the top of my list. there is so much insight not just about chinese culture but also human nature, children, parents, people as a whole, mirrored into this little world. cheng cheng is a devilish manipulator, like a lot of politicians, but as a child you see he is still as pure as can be--he was sorry for hurting xiao fei and apologised, and frankly told luo lei that he will vote for him because he likes him. luo lei is the veteran, a sincere leader although not without faults; he told his parents he doesn't want to brainwash the students and let them think for themselves. he may be overly strict, but on the last speech you can readily see that he is the most 'competent' of all three--he gave a formal bow as a greeting, his speech he recited and not read, and even added some impromptu lines at the end. and xiao fei, the only girl and the underdog--i was amazed that she had the courage to run in the first place, being a bit shy, and although she has a loving mother, she doesn't have both parents' support and strategy as the other two. all of them nearly gave up, and had to fight for courage as does every human being. their mini-politics is complete with the veteran politician, the new but promising one, and the underdog. in the end, like every politics--the veteran wins.",1293840000,6,1374,4.37109375

3444749,5,B0019Z3P5W,"PLEASE VOTE FOR ME is a short but compelling documentary that looks at a ""first-of-its-kind"" democratic election at the Evergreen Primary School in Wuhan, China.  The class of eight-year old pupils is given the opportunity to vote for one of three teacher-chosen candidates.  Two boys and one girl are selected, including current class monitor Luo Lei (""the dictator""), the confident Cheng Cheng (""the manager"") and the shy Xu Xiafei (""the gentle one"").  There are debates, speeches, even a talent show to help the voters decide.  Along the way, there are smear campaigns and backroom dealings galore.  The children's parents get heavily involved and we see that Luo and Cheng have some built-in advantages.  Cheng's mom is a TV producer who seems well equipped to help her son with his stump speeches.  Luo's dad is the police chief who can finagle free class trips on the town's state-of-the-art monorail to benefit his candidate.  Meanwhile, Xu is frequently reduced to tears and has only her divorced mom to guide her. Despite mom's sound advice, Xu seems to be a longshot candidate (unless, of course, she can corner the female vote).  All of the parents become speechwriters and campaign advisers for their kids. And each of the candidates has two ""assistants"" he or she can use to take the pulse of the electorate.  At the center of it all, the class teacher is a beaming and beatific presence who seems delighted to be given the chance to bring this experiment in democracy into her classroom.  Come election day, two candidates, their assistants and their most fervent supporters will, of course, be disappointed.  But that's democracy.  If you have an hour to spare, you'll be investing it well with PLEASE VOTE FOR ME.  You'll be surprised to see how quickly three 8-year-old Communists can learn all the tricks and chicanery we are used to seeing play out within America's supposedly sophisticated political system.",1255305600,16,1927,5.0
