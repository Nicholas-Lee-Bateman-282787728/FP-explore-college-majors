3176501,5,B00180IPQW,"Like so many, I was initially introduced to this series via my local PBS station.  Was caught up in the manner in which the series portrayed the characters.  All the actors cast got it spot on.  The fact that it was shot on location in the UK only added to my enjoyment.  Loved the mysticism added to the standard storyline.  People in that period were often quite superstitious and believed in all kinds of supernatural beings. The Hooded Man would have been seen as a protector of the English forests and the people who dwelled there or nearby.

Have owned this set for sometime. Kept hunting for it until I finally found it for sale.  A very happy day for me!",1439337600,,662,4.421487603305785

3176516,5,B00180IPQW,"My wife and I got hooked on this series during a trip to England back in the eighties. Friends had taped the show and we watched an entire season in a week. The story is familiar as are the characters and settings. But the music by Clannad brought it to a new level. We loved it.

By today's standards the show is probably too tame for some. The violence is mostly implied and there is no nudity, but for shear story-telling it's still top notch television. The set is put together nicely and the video quality is probably as good as it gets from early eighties British TV. We're enjoying it again (At our age something 30 years old may as well be new) and recommend it highly.",1412035200,2,677,4.2890625

I love Robin of Sherwood and grew up watching it as a child. As an adult I appreciate the rich landscapes and haunting Clannad soundtrack that accompanies it. Highly recommended but not in this hard, cheap packaging.",1411776000,,517,4.5978260869565215

3176531,5,B00180IPQW,"I was born in the mid-eighties, which means that my memories of that decade are a little fuzzy - though I do recall big hair, synthesized music and a distinct lack of computer-generated special effects on television. But I did have one distinct memory of a show that featured a red-headed woman entering a dark and dingy castle and cleverly holding off the advances of a lecherous old man before the young hero arrived to rescue her. I didn't know it at the time, but I was watching ""Robin of Sherwood"", now considered one of the best versions of the Robin Hood legends.

Created by Richard Carpenter and running for three seasons between 1984 and 1986, the show's goal was to reinvigorate the legend for a modern audience, with lengthy action sequences, a (somewhat contradictory) emphasis on both historical accuracy and mysticism, and the outlaws depicted as living rough in the wilds of Sherwood (rather than amassing a large army of followers).

The finished product was a hugely popular retelling of the legend, which - despite its premature cancellation due to budgetary problems in the production company - remains to this day one of the most significant Robin Hood adaptations of all time. It's had a huge influence on the more recent film and television retellings of the famous archer, including a proactive Marion, a more realistic setting, an abusive relationship between the Sheriff and Guy of Gisborne, and the addition of a Saracen soldier who joins the outlaws.

Granted, some aspects of the show now seem rather dated, namely its leisurely pacing and rather theatrical (occasionally stilted) acting. But its strengths are still apparent, from its archetypal take on each of the famous characters, to the immense variety and originality of storylines, to the high production values. Filmed almost entirely on-location in castles and forests across England, the show has a scope that's impressive even by today's standards.

Whilst King Richard is busy fighting in the Crusades, Prince John rules over England in his absence, raising taxes and inflicting harsh punishments on those that break his tyrannical laws. Various lords and sheriffs rule in his name with an iron fist; one such man is Sheriff Robert de Rainult of Nottinghamshire, along with the brutal Sir Guy of Gisborne as his lackey.

It's in this unforgiving environment that the man called Robin Hood emerges as a prophesied hero, fighting on behalf of the suffering peasantry; robbing from the rich to give to the poor, and defeating evil in various forms: from the cruel Sheriff to various demons and sorcerers.

Of all the innovations that Carpenter introduced to the concept of Robin Hood, it would have to be his decision to infuse the legend with its own mythology that stands out most strongly. Here, Robin Hood is not a mere outlaw, but the chosen subject of prophecy, a long-awaited individual known as the Hooded Man. Armed with a magic sword called Albion and mentored by a mystical shaman controlled by the god Herne (each with obvious allusions to Excalibur and Merlin), Robin is guided by visions and dreams and charged with defending the weak and helpless.

This mystical backdrop resulted in storylines inspired by a wide variety of components from Judaic folklore, Celtic mythology and Paganism, not to mention Carpenter's own imagination. As well as the more prosaic evil of the sheriff and his minions, Robin is also pitted against demons, witches, sorcerers, golems - and a group of devil-worshipping nuns, believe it or not. Even the spirit of King Arthur pops in for a visit.

Yet despite these fantastical elements, the show remained committed to historical accuracy. Locations, costuming, weapons, culture - obviously it's not all 100% correct, but it's clear that a serious effort was made. One moment of particularly striking attention to detail is pointed out in a DVD commentary, which reveals that a left-handed actress was instructed to write with her right hand so as not to defy the stigma that surrounded left-handed people in the 12th century. As well as this, there were numerous appearances from famous historical figures, including Prince John, Isabella of Angouleme, Arthur of Brittany, Adam Bell, the Knights Templar - and of course, King Richard (portrayed by John Rhys Davies), who appears not as the benevolent king who arrives to grant everyone their just rewards, but far more accurately as a tempestuous and violent man who thinks nothing of draining the coffers of England in a bid to fund his love of warfare.

But an upset occurred on-set at the close of season two, in which Michael Praed (Robin) abruptly decided to pursue a career on Broadway, leaving the show without its lead character. Yet having already incorporated famous elements of the legend into the show, Carpenter rather cleverly seized the opportunity to explore the two differing backgrounds of the Robin Hood figure.

Having written Michael Praed's Robin as a yeoman who was caught poaching by the authorities (as per the earliest legends), Carpenter introduces his replacement Jason Connery as what is now the more familiar nobly-born aristocrat who willingly gives up his wealth and title to fight on behalf of the common folk. Though debate rages to this day as to who made the better Robin, it was an elegant way of replacing the lead actor and continuing the story.

Both versions of Robin (Michael Praed and Jason Connery) are the typical heroic figure, earnest and passionate and devoted to the cause. Little John (Clive Mantle) is a gentle giant, easily moved to either tears or fury, whilst Friar Tuck (Phil Rose) is a genial monk, both spirited and intellectual. Much (Peter Llewellyn Williams) is Robin's foster-brother and something of a simpleton, whilst Will Scarlet (Ray Winstone) is the closest thing this show has to a complex anti-hero. With a backstory in which his wife was raped and murdered by soldiers, Will changes his name from Scathlock to Scarlet to better reflect the red-hot rage that resides within him. Definitely something of a loose cannon who doesn't hesitate to challenge Robin's leadership, he's certainly one of the most memorable characters.

As is Maid Marion (Judi Trott), who manages to encompass innocence, strength, beauty, determination and street-smarts. In some of the earliest ballads featuring Marion, she manages to fight Robin to a stand-still in the forest, yet so often is characterized in various films as a damsel in distress and a ""prize"" for Robin to claim at the end of his adventures. Carpenter returns to her some of her original independence, allowing her to retain her femininity whilst still being an active and helpful member of what is otherwise an all-boys club. Mark Ryan fills out the ranks as Nasir, a Saracen assassin who decides to team up with Robin in his fight against evil; a character that proved so popular that a Saracen was included in both Kevin Costner's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robin-Hood-Prince-of-Thieves/dp/B0070DQZ86/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves</a>&nbsp;and the more recent BBC&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robin-Hood/dp/B003TY2SUO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robin Hood</a>&nbsp;series.

""Robin of Sherwood"" has certainly aged in many respects, though in others it's still captivating, and it has certainly left its mark on Robin Hood lore. It's fascinating to compare it to later versions of the tale, taking note of what has been kept and what has been dropped from Carpenter's vision. Whether you approach ""Robin of Sherwood"" nostalgically or with fresh eyes, it remains an essential milestone in the continuing tradition of stories about this most famous of outlaws.",1403049600,,7778,5.242765273311897

3176552,5,B00180IPQW,"Habe diese Serie am 01. Juni 2010 erworben und mir damit selber einen lange gehegten Wunsch erfllt (sie wieder vollstndig, in anstndiger Qualitt zu besitzen und vor allem, endlich komplett und ungeschnitten), - damals allerdings noch gnstiger. Verstehe dies inzwischen auch nicht mehr so ganz, warum einige Filme und Serien sich hier im Laufe der Zeit nur noch verteuern, statt wie frher, normalerweise spter im Preis zu fallen. Fllt also mitlerweile schon deutlich auf. Und irgendwo zu Recht beschweren sich einige darber in Form von frustrierten Kommentaren zu Rezensionen.

Aber nun zu der eigentlichen Reihe hier. Ich beginne mal mit den Darstellern, - zunchst die Gegenspieler, dann, die Hauptakteure.

""Robin Hood"" (im Original: ""Robin of Sherwood"") ist eine britische Abenteuer, - und Fantasy - Fernsehserie, - erdacht vom Drehbuchautor Richard Carpenter, - die von 1983 bis 1985 mehr fr das Fersehen gedreht wurde.

Was schon mal den ersten, postiven Aspekt ausmacht. Man versuchte garnicht erst, mit bombastischen Effekten oder auf zwanghafter Action getrimmter Handlung ein zahlendes Kinopublikum dafr zu begeistern. Sondern man konnte sich (da ja ohnehin fr's TV gedacht, das mit Gebhren finanziert wird) wunderbar auf die Erzhlung von zum Thema passenden Sagen und Geschichten konzentrieren.

Auch war es so natrlich, - durch die geplante Lnge als Serie, mglich, - fast alle Figuren bzw. Charaktere hier heraus zu arbeiten. Die noch dazu von sehr guten Schauspielern dargestellt wurden.

Einer von ihnen war z. B. Robert Addie (manchen auch bekannt durch seine Rolle als Mordred in John Boorman's ""Excalibur"", - der sich mit der altenglischen Arthus - Legende befasst). Er gibt hier den Guy of Gisbourne, und zwar, - ebenso wie in dem gerade genannten Film, gewohnt gut, mit Verschlagenheit sowie mit Bauernschlue.

Sein Arbeitgeber ist natrlich auch hier der Sheriff von Nottingham, gespielt von Nicolas Grace. Diese Figur kommt nun ebenso mies und durchtrieben rber, wie es beispielsweise Alan Rickman schon in der Filmversion mit Kevin Costner geschafft hat. Es gibt natrlich noch mehr Bsewichte, aber da die nicht in fast jeder Folge vorkommen, spare ich mir mal, sie nun auf zu zhlen.

Robin Hood selbst wird von damals gerade 24 - jhrigen Michael Pread dargestellt (mir sonst nur noch durch seine Rolle als Prinz von Moldavien in der Serie ""der Denver Clan"" in Erinnerung geblieben). Spter bernahm diese Rolle Jason Connery, - der Sohn von Sean Connery - ""James Bond"".

Hier kann man sich nun gerne darber streiten, ob dieser der bessere Schauspieler fr diese Figur war. Und so die Serie spter an Qualitt dazu gewonnen hat. Oder ob es doch Michael Pread berzeugender vermocht hatte. Und so die frheren Folgen es mehr in sich hatten.

Ich persnlich wrde hier allerdings immer fr Michael Pread votieren. Dieser ist eindeutig auch der bessere, - talentiertere Schauspieler. Und ein dunkelhaariger Typ, als Darsteller dieser historischen Figur sah fr mich auch irgendwie berzeugender aus.

Judi Trott spielte Marian, - auch sie war besser als andere Schauspielerinnen in den verschiedenen Verfilmungen. Eben nicht nur ein hbsches Gesicht ohne Talent wie anderswo, - sondern eine richtig, agierende Darstellerin.

Besonders gut konnte aber Ray Winstone (u.a. in ""Quadrophenia"", ""King Arthur"", ""unterwegs nach Cold Mountain"", ""die Legende von Beowulf"") als Will Scarlet hier berzeugen. Im Gegensatz zu den eher farblosen Verkrperungen in frheren Filmen, prsentierte er uns hier eine recht vielschichtige und variantenreiche Version dieser Figur.

Clive Mantle gab John Little - little John, - Peter Llewellyn Williams den Much. Beide waren aber leider nicht sehr berzeugend. Sehr gut war dafr hier wieder Phil Rose als Bruder Tuck - der Mnch. Jedenfalls besser als der Darsteller (Michael McShane) in der, ebenfalls 1991 von Kevin Costner gegebenen Variante.

Und, als letzten, - dann gab es noch den Sarazenen Nasir, - dargestellt von Mark Ryan. Mag sein, diese Figur ist frei erfunden und kommt so eigentlich nicht wirklich in der historischen berlieferung vor. Ich bin aber froh darber, denn, sein Darsteller sorgte hier immer fr ein gewisses Highlight mit seinen zwei auf dem Rcken gekreuzten Sbeln.

Der einzige, dem man sofort Erfahrungen im Schwertkampf abnahm, whrend die anderen zumindest am Anfang nicht viel mehr als prgelnde Bauerntlpel hier waren. Auerdem, stellte Mark Ryan diese Figur sehr gut dar, - jedenfalls um Lngen besser, als bei Costner's Version der Schaupieler (Morgan Freeman) es konnte.

Zur Serie selber, - bzw. Aufmachung, Requisiten, Kostme, Schaupltze usw. usf. mal etwas gesagt.

Wie schon weiter oben angegeben, war die Inszenierung deutlich besser als in weiteren Beispielen hier zum historischen Thema. Man verwob gekonnt fantastische Elemente (wie z. B. Hexen, Fabelwesen, Zauberer, magisches - okkultes) mit echten, geschichtlichen Fakten (die Rolle der Kirche im Mittelalter, Antisemitismus, - und Judenprogrome, Ausbeutung der Unterschichten, Leibeigenschaft - willkrlicher Terror als legitime Form der Herrschaft).

Noch dazu waren die Standorte gut gewhlt. Wie selten zuvor wurde ein schlichtes Waldgebiet hier so mystisch und bezaubernd gefilmt. Aber auch in echten, alten Kirchen und Gemuern wurde gedreht. Dazu verband man das ganze noch mit dem fantastischen Soundtrack der irischen Folklore - Band Clannad.

Ebenso waren die Kostme gut ausgesucht, - nichts sah hier wirklich lcherlich oder gar unrealistisch aus. Gemeint sind nun also nicht die protzigen Roben der Edelleute, sondern das, was der ""gemeine Mann"" hier trgt. Man hatte eher das Gefhl, so (zweckmig, schlicht, praktisch und leicht zu kombinieren - reparieren) knnten sich Menschen dieser Epoche gekleidet haben, als bei anderen Verfimungen, die in dieser Zeit spielen sollen.

Auch, wenn natrlich oft genug, manche der Darstellungen schon recht jugendlich, - und im typischen ""80er Jahre Stil"" rber gebracht wurden. Aber, gerade das macht ja auch heute noch die Faszination an dieser Serie aus.

Zu den DVD's, - bzw. der Bild, - und Tonqualitt (englische Tonspur).

Die Gestaltung ist schlicht, - passt dafr aber ebenso zur ganzen Serie berhaupt. Auf jeder DVD erwartet einen ein einfach gehaltenes Men. Das Bild ist dem Alter und vor allem, - einer Fernsehreihe entsprechend. Wer sich hier ber nicht auf Hochglanz polierte Auflsungen usw. aufregt, kann das gerne tun. Dennoch, fragt man sich ernsthaft, - was erwarten solche Nrgler eigentlich. ;-)

Ton ist auch dementsprechend (englische DVD's), - man versteht die gesprochenen Passagen ausreichend, - der, wie ebenfalls schon erwhnt, wunderbar ausgesuchte Soundtrack von Clannad hlt sich angenehm im Hintergrund, bertnt nichts oder drngt sich gar strend auf. Schon daher kann ich diese DVD - Edition nur jedem wrmstens empfehlen.",1353628800,,6803,5.477554918815664

3176555,5,B00180IPQW,"I first discovered Robin Of Sherwood via the Public Broadcast System here in America. The local university channel carried it under the name Robin Hood. It was the best version of Robin Hood I had ever seen. I've seen several since, and in my opinion it is still the best by far. This may seem odd because of all the very unhistorcal magic, but this series comes closer to the spirit of the orginal 15th-century ballads than any other. In this version Robin is a yoeman rather than a disposessed noble. A couple of the original ballads are included in the stories, such as the tale of Sir Richard-at-Lea and the money he owes the local abbot. The acting is uniformly good and the interiors and exteriors feel real.

One of the fun parts involves the games. Robin and his men train themselves with archery contests and mock fights, and several episodes feature these games in various forms, all in fun.

It was the first version to have a Saracen character. Since then the movies and shows have all included one, none of them ever as good as Mark Ryan playing Nasir.

In my opinion it is also the only series or movie that gets King Richard right. The stories either center around the ransom collected when Richard was captured on his way home from the crusades or around the hope that all will be well when Richard finally returns. The only problem is that Richard was only back in England for a few months before he took off again to make war on France, where he was killed. If Richard saves the day for Robin in the fight against evil Prince John then what happens to Robin a year later when Richard dies and John becomes king? Robin of Sherwood gets around that by having Richard be portrayed (by the wonderful John Rhys-Davies) as the hard-bitten tyrant he was. He pardons Robin and his band on the promise that they will join him in his new fight against the French. When they agree he forces his nobles, including the sheriff, to accept the outlaws as equals. When Robin later challenges the king to devote his resources to helping the poor rather than waste them on another war, Richard secretly orders Robin's assassination. The point is that Robin and his gang are going to be outlaws for as long as those in authority are self-serving, and are safe from no one.

Toward the end of the second series Michael Praed, who played Robin of Loxley, decided to leave the series. Rather than find a lookalike actor they hit on a novel idea. There is one late legend, almost certainly false, which identifies Robin Hood with Robert, the Earl of Huntingdon. Since they had already had their Robin be chosen as 'The Hooded Man' by the Celtic forest god Herne the Hunter, they decided to kill off Loxley and have him replaced by Robert of Huntingdon, played by Jason Connery. It was a good move and the series went for another 13 episodes in that form, and had some of their best shows.

The final selling point for me was the amazing music by Clannad. At the time I described it as being ""as green as the forest itself."" I became a fan for life and now own all their albums. A remarkable group created remarkable music for a remarkable show.

Overall Robin Of Sherwood still gets my vote as the most historical and most fun version of Robin Hood.

Herne protect us.",1340323200,19,3263,4.5016891891891895
3176556,4,B00180IPQW,"I avidly watched this series back in the day when it was on our local PBS station. The beautiful countryside and good sets that look as it did in the medievel age add to the stories. It was a good move to shoot in England. The color is sometime smeary and not clear but I can overlook that. The music is fantastic. I  love Clannad. I have to agree with the reviews that say the packaging is horrible. The discs are almost impossible to remove. I immediately put them in other sleeves which leaves me with a nice looking but not functional case that I can't use. That is a big waste. Reviewers who say the legend says this and the legend says that are missing the point that it IS a legend and in the retelling it got more fantastic and farther away from any truth that may have been in the original stories. No one knows who this man or men really were and how many followed him and what exactly went on. Since we'll never know who he was if he had a lady, who his men were (if any) we can't say the characters are wrong the stories not following the ""original"" legend or anything like that. I give the producers and writers big points for showing the Norman nobility as uncaring conquerors who barely tolerated living amongst the English types, who rolled over the serfs and peasants like they were nothing, and easily killed anyone they liked for any reason they liked. The abuses are clear and they don't whitewash the ""Great King"" Richard  but show him as a Norman conqueror who historically spent almost no time in England only spoke French and could not care less what happened to the people. Unlike other Robin Hood movies where he comes in on a white horse and saves them from the evil King John, in the end he stayed gone and died far away never thinking of his ""people"". The serfs live in squalor everyone gets dirty, betrayal and treachery are as they would be when people are so desperate and trying to survive. These people could not read, had little recreation, no education, lived in constant fear and turned to magical legends and pagan beliefs for hope when they felt totally helpless. These were dark ages and Robin Hood legends gave them secret hope and self respect. I was surprised at some of the writing of the episodes that didn't gloss over the hard way people lived in those days and how easily they could lose their lives due to someone's whim. It explains a lot about the British behavior toward people they conquered in later history. This series has a lot of drama taken from history which makes it even more interesting and makes me glad I did not live in days of old when knights were bold I promise ya!",1336867200,15,2634,4.406570841889117
3176557,1,B00180IPQW,"This is the worst retelling of a time-honored legend that I've ever seen. I purchase both books and DVDs frequently from Amazon, and this is the first Amazon purchase that I regret making. I give it one star only because I can't give it a 0. The only resemblance to the Robin Hood legend is in the names of a few characters and places. The one bright spot, as far as casting is concerned is Michael Praed as Robin, and he disappears after a few early episodes. His replacement, for the final 13 episodes, is Jason Connery as someone named Robert of Huntindon, who suddenly appears to take Robin's place, and is even referred to as Robin Hood more often than by his own name! Oh, yes. The original Robin Hood has shoulder length dark hair and sometimes -- mostly in the credits -- is shown wearing a hood. The replacement Robin Hood has shoulder-length blond hair, and sometimes -- mostly in the credits -- is shown wearing a hood.

The band of ""Merry Men"" is a small group of 5 men and a rather unconvincing ""Maid Marian,"" none of whom seem particularly merry. The band lives in the forest, the year around, apparently without any shelter whatsoever. The original 4 are Much, the miller's son, a rather naive young man who's role is to get into trouble so the others can come to his aid; Little John is a likeable but not particularly intelligent ""strong man""; a fat Friar Tuck who's character is left rather undeveloped; and a nasty, hot tempered, argumentative troublemaker, ""Will Scarlett,"" who is for some inexplicable reason tolerated by the others. A fifth member, a ""Saracen"" swordsman, joins them after a few episodes. Then, there is ""Maid Marian"" who lives in the forest with five men, who seems to be rather half-heartedly in love with both Robins, in turn, and proves to be a  skilled archer with a longbow.

The Sherrif of Nottinham is a loud mouth ""villain"" who treats his followers, including Guy Gisbourn his #2 man, with so much contempt and cruelty that it's unbelievable that his own men don't bury him alive. The story lines are developed specifically for this series and have little or no relationship to the familiar legend. The episodes are full of magic and supernatural events, there is a poorly explained ""mystery wise-man"" character, who seems to be regarded as a ""wolf"" although he wears a huge elk-like headdress. King Richard appears in a single early episode and turns out to be more of an enemy than ally to Robin.

The one unreservedly positive aspect of the DVDs is the musical score by the fine Irish band Clannad. The heavy reliance on the supernatural is, I think overdone. Many of the episodes introduce new characters, who do not reappear in subsequent episodes, and there is relatively little continuity except in a few two-part programs. I don't feel that this set is worth the price, and I'm sorry that I bought it. It won't, however, stop me from shopping at Amazon!!",1333929600,6,2909,4.67578125

It lives up to my memory for quality of story and entertainment value.  The quality of image is not perfect by 21st century standards, but that could be the result of both the quality of the original copies and the extreme green filtering that was used in the first season.

The story, particularly the 1st series has a great deal of coherency.  I still find it amazing the the writer was able to maintain such a consistent story over several years.  The magic in the first series is limited, subdued and more lurking than obvious.  The second series shows a certain amount of budget cutting as well as the different writers who were employed.  Magic becomes more commonplace in the episodes of the second series but does not detract from the overall story that is being told.

The Sheriff of Nottingham is particularly well played through the series as is Guy of Gisbourne.  Their changing and interweaving relationship over the series is almost as entertaining as the episodic stories and overall tale being told.",1308268800,,1165,4.699507389162561

I like the BBC America version of Robin Hood too, but this series had a grittiness to it that made it more believable.

I won't say it's perfect though, but it is more realistic, even with the ""magic and mystical"" element which helps to create a real period feel to the production.  Where the series excells is the attention given to casting and the characterisation.  These guys look and feel real and ""just right"" for the part.  Every other version I have seen, whether it be movie or series, never makes the mark in my view in this regard.  The sets and costumes are wonderful.  Given the budget, and the special effects facilities of the time, this production is nothing short of a miracle.  In fact, if the FX of today were available, it may have detracted from the series, because there is a tendency to overdo, losing realism and character development at the same time.

3176573,4,B00180IPQW,"It's been years since my old VCR recordings of this show pretty much wore out and bit the dust, so I was thrilled to find out it was available on DVD.
Robin of Sherwood was a favorite of my pre-teen years and has held up very well with it's combination of history,legend and fantasy.  Some of the special effects are dated, but that's to be expected.
The real strength of the series was in the characters.  It may have been the best cast version of the story.  Clive Mantle is the best Little John, Phil Rose is the best Friar Tuck, and so on through the entire cast.  There's even the addition of Nasir who, with his man of few words demeanor and two sword fighting style was just about the coolest thing a D and D loving 12 years old had ever seen.
I do think the quality fell off a little when Jason Connery joined the show, though not through any fault of his own.  The writing focused more on plot then characters in that season and the chemistry suffered a bit from it.  I would actually give the Michael Praed episodes a full five stars.
All in all I'm glad to have found it and any minor flaws in the series are far, far out weighed by its strengths.  If you where a fan of the show you should definitely get your hands on a copy.  Though given the price it's worth knowing it's available on Netflix.

3176576,4,B00180IPQW,"The series is excellent and faithful to the literary history surrounding the Robin Hood legends. Clannad's music adds a bit of authenticity, as does the use of magic and superstition, and the UK setting.

Acorn did a reasonably good job digitizing and adding subtitles to the original film. Colour was on the dark side, but nothing that can't be adjusted.

The poor packaging of the 'complete' set prevents me from giving it a perfect score. I like the look and the folding-book concept of it, but the casing is made of hard plastic, making it prone to chipping and difficult to remove the DVDs carefully without breaking or cracking them.

3176578,3,B00180IPQW,"There are certain aspects of this production that are very good, & other aspects that are not so good. Pros: the locations & scenery & color are terrific. If this is not Sherwood Forest, then it seems like it could be. The locations are realistic, castles seem period appropriate, & so do costumes, utensils, & customs. Unlike other productions, I do not hear the hollow sound of plywood while the actors are walking on stone floors or earth. This production has invented its own unique personalities for Robin's band of outlaws, as some previous productions had. Some of these work well (Marian, Sheriff, King Richard, King John), others don't work well at all (Will Scarlet, Friar Tuck), etc. The element of mysticism & paganism (especially Herne the Hunter), although not seen in a Robin Hood telling before, do seem appropriate for the time period. There is a degree of reality that is missing from most earlier versions (bad guys sometimes do get killed here, instead of just being wounded). Cons: the acting leaves much to be desired; some of the actors are quite competent but others need more work. There is entirely too much screaming; screaming does not equal emoting, & much of it rings hollow. The script-writing is sub-par; some words (particularly ""idiot"") are used countless times in each episode. Some of the dialog sounds out-of-time (for some reason, ""What's up?,"" heard in two different episodes, doesn't have the ring of medieval England). The plots in the first season are too simplistic & often redundant. There needs to be more of Robin's outlaw band (even as minor players or extras); it seems like there are only eight outlaws here, not enough to be ""realistic"" (that is, according to the legends, some of which stated that the Merry Men numbered over 100). There is much in the way of action scenes here, but it is not well-coordinated & the stunts need improvement (part of the problem is that the actors do much of their own stunt-work, & it's evident in terms of slowness, lack of agility, & lack of reality). A sword fight & stabbing in this production usually looks like it's at the level of young boys playing make-believe, & comes off as phony. Overall, a worthwhile production which is fairly good, but could have been much better. The episodes greatly improved starting with the last show of the first season, & the notable improvement continued throughout the second season. The Robin of the first season was replaced by Robert, Earl of Huntingdon, played by a different actor. Viewer's opinions are divided on which actor is better, but what has significantly improved is the writing (dialog & plot), the action choreography, & continuity. The second season's shows are not redundant, are more interesting, & even returning actors seem to be doing a better job by not being quite as over the top as previously. For me, watching the first season's pitfalls made me enjoy the second season all the more. 3* for the first season, 4* for the second season.",1226880000,11,2989,4.851272015655577

The story is familiar as are the characters and settings. But the music by Clannad brought it to a new level. We loved it.

By today's standards the show is probably too tame for some. The violence is mostly implied and there is no nudity, but for shear story-telling it's still top notch television. The set is put together nicely and the video quality is probably as good as it gets from early eighties British TV.

3411028,5,B00180IPQW,"I was born in the mid-eighties, which means that my memories of that decade are a little fuzzy - though I do recall big hair, synthesized music and a distinct lack of computer-generated special effects on television. But I did have one distinct memory of a show that featured a red-headed woman entering a dark and dingy castle and cleverly holding off the advances of a lecherous old man before the young hero arrived to rescue her. I didn't know it at the time, but I was watching ""Robin of Sherwood"", now considered one of the best versions of the Robin Hood legends.

Created by Richard Carpenter and running for three seasons between 1984 and 1986, the show's goal was to reinvigorate the legend for a modern audience, with lengthy action sequences, a (somewhat contradictory) emphasis on both historical accuracy and mysticism, and the outlaws depicted as living rough in the wilds of Sherwood (rather than amassing a large army of followers).

The finished product was a hugely popular retelling of the legend, which - despite its premature cancellation due to budgetary problems in the production company - remains to this day one of the most significant Robin Hood adaptations of all time. It's had a huge influence on the more recent film and television retellings of the famous archer, including a proactive Marion, a more realistic setting, an abusive relationship between the Sheriff and Guy of Gisborne, and the addition of a Saracen soldier who joins the outlaws.

Granted, some aspects of the show now seem rather dated, namely its leisurely pacing and rather theatrical (occasionally stilted) acting. But its strengths are still apparent, from its archetypal take on each of the famous characters, to the immense variety and originality of storylines, to the high production values. Filmed almost entirely on-location in castles and forests across England, the show has a scope that's impressive even by today's standards.

Whilst King Richard is busy fighting in the Crusades, Prince John rules over England in his absence, raising taxes and inflicting harsh punishments on those that break his tyrannical laws. Various lords and sheriffs rule in his name with an iron fist; one such man is Sheriff Robert de Rainult of Nottinghamshire, along with the brutal Sir Guy of Gisborne as his lackey.

It's in this unforgiving environment that the man called Robin Hood emerges as a prophesied hero, fighting on behalf of the suffering peasantry; robbing from the rich to give to the poor, and defeating evil in various forms: from the cruel Sheriff to various demons and sorcerers.

Of all the innovations that Carpenter introduced to the concept of Robin Hood, it would have to be his decision to infuse the legend with its own mythology that stands out most strongly. Here, Robin Hood is not a mere outlaw, but the chosen subject of prophecy, a long-awaited individual known as the Hooded Man. Armed with a magic sword called Albion and mentored by a mystical shaman controlled by the god Herne (each with obvious allusions to Excalibur and Merlin), Robin is guided by visions and dreams and charged with defending the weak and helpless.

This mystical backdrop resulted in storylines inspired by a wide variety of components from Judaic folklore, Celtic mythology and Paganism, not to mention Carpenter's own imagination. As well as the more prosaic evil of the sheriff and his minions, Robin is also pitted against demons, witches, sorcerers, golems - and a group of devil-worshipping nuns, believe it or not. Even the spirit of King Arthur pops in for a visit.

Yet despite these fantastical elements, the show remained committed to historical accuracy. Locations, costuming, weapons, culture - obviously it's not all 100% correct, but it's clear that a serious effort was made. One moment of particularly striking attention to detail is pointed out in a DVD commentary, which reveals that a left-handed actress was instructed to write with her right hand so as not to defy the stigma that surrounded left-handed people in the 12th century. As well as this, there were numerous appearances from famous historical figures, including Prince John, Isabella of Angouleme, Arthur of Brittany, Adam Bell, the Knights Templar - and of course, King Richard (portrayed by John Rhys Davies), who appears not as the benevolent king who arrives to grant everyone their just rewards, but far more accurately as a tempestuous and violent man who thinks nothing of draining the coffers of England in a bid to fund his love of warfare.

But an upset occurred on-set at the close of season two, in which Michael Praed (Robin) abruptly decided to pursue a career on Broadway, leaving the show without its lead character. Yet having already incorporated famous elements of the legend into the show, Carpenter rather cleverly seized the opportunity to explore the two differing backgrounds of the Robin Hood figure.

Having written Michael Praed's Robin as a yeoman who was caught poaching by the authorities (as per the earliest legends), Carpenter introduces his replacement Jason Connery as what is now the more familiar nobly-born aristocrat who willingly gives up his wealth and title to fight on behalf of the common folk. Though debate rages to this day as to who made the better Robin, it was an elegant way of replacing the lead actor and continuing the story.

Both versions of Robin (Michael Praed and Jason Connery) are the typical heroic figure, earnest and passionate and devoted to the cause. Little John (Clive Mantle) is a gentle giant, easily moved to either tears or fury, whilst Friar Tuck (Phil Rose) is a genial monk, both spirited and intellectual. Much (Peter Llewellyn Williams) is Robin's foster-brother and something of a simpleton, whilst Will Scarlet (Ray Winstone) is the closest thing this show has to a complex anti-hero. With a backstory in which his wife was raped and murdered by soldiers, Will changes his name from Scathlock to Scarlet to better reflect the red-hot rage that resides within him. Definitely something of a loose cannon who doesn't hesitate to challenge Robin's leadership, he's certainly one of the most memorable characters.

As is Maid Marion (Judi Trott), who manages to encompass innocence, strength, beauty, determination and street-smarts. In some of the earliest ballads featuring Marion, she manages to fight Robin to a stand-still in the forest, yet so often is characterized in various films as a damsel in distress and a ""prize"" for Robin to claim at the end of his adventures. Carpenter returns to her some of her original independence, allowing her to retain her femininity whilst still being an active and helpful member of what is otherwise an all-boys club. Mark Ryan fills out the ranks as Nasir, a Saracen assassin who decides to team up with Robin in his fight against evil; a character that proved so popular that a Saracen was included in both Kevin Costner's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robin-Hood-Prince-of-Thieves/dp/B0070DQZ86/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves</a>&nbsp;and the more recent BBC&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robin-Hood/dp/B003TY2SUO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robin Hood</a>&nbsp;series.

""Robin of Sherwood"" has certainly aged in many respects, though in others it's still captivating, and it has certainly left its mark on Robin Hood lore. It's fascinating to compare it to later versions of the tale, taking note of what has been kept and what has been dropped from Carpenter's vision. Whether you approach ""Robin of Sherwood"" nostalgically or with fresh eyes, it remains an essential milestone in the continuing tradition of stories about this most famous of outlaws.",1403049600,,7778,5.242765273311897

3411049,5,B00180IPQW,"Habe diese Serie am 01. Juni 2010 erworben und mir damit selber einen lange gehegten Wunsch erfllt (sie wieder vollstndig, in anstndiger Qualitt zu besitzen und vor allem, endlich komplett und ungeschnitten), - damals allerdings noch gnstiger. Verstehe dies inzwischen auch nicht mehr so ganz, warum einige Filme und Serien sich hier im Laufe der Zeit nur noch verteuern, statt wie frher, normalerweise spter im Preis zu fallen. Fllt also mitlerweile schon deutlich auf. Und irgendwo zu Recht beschweren sich einige darber in Form von frustrierten Kommentaren zu Rezensionen.

Aber nun zu der eigentlichen Reihe hier. Ich beginne mal mit den Darstellern, - zunchst die Gegenspieler, dann, die Hauptakteure.

""Robin Hood"" (im Original: ""Robin of Sherwood"") ist eine britische Abenteuer, - und Fantasy - Fernsehserie, - erdacht vom Drehbuchautor Richard Carpenter, - die von 1983 bis 1985 mehr fr das Fersehen gedreht wurde.

Was schon mal den ersten, postiven Aspekt ausmacht. Man versuchte garnicht erst, mit bombastischen Effekten oder auf zwanghafter Action getrimmter Handlung ein zahlendes Kinopublikum dafr zu begeistern. Sondern man konnte sich (da ja ohnehin fr's TV gedacht, das mit Gebhren finanziert wird) wunderbar auf die Erzhlung von zum Thema passenden Sagen und Geschichten konzentrieren.

Auch war es so natrlich, - durch die geplante Lnge als Serie, mglich, - fast alle Figuren bzw. Charaktere hier heraus zu arbeiten. Die noch dazu von sehr guten Schauspielern dargestellt wurden.

Einer von ihnen war z. B. Robert Addie (manchen auch bekannt durch seine Rolle als Mordred in John Boorman's ""Excalibur"", - der sich mit der altenglischen Arthus - Legende befasst). Er gibt hier den Guy of Gisbourne, und zwar, - ebenso wie in dem gerade genannten Film, gewohnt gut, mit Verschlagenheit sowie mit Bauernschlue.

Sein Arbeitgeber ist natrlich auch hier der Sheriff von Nottingham, gespielt von Nicolas Grace. Diese Figur kommt nun ebenso mies und durchtrieben rber, wie es beispielsweise Alan Rickman schon in der Filmversion mit Kevin Costner geschafft hat. Es gibt natrlich noch mehr Bsewichte, aber da die nicht in fast jeder Folge vorkommen, spare ich mir mal, sie nun auf zu zhlen.

Robin Hood selbst wird von damals gerade 24 - jhrigen Michael Pread dargestellt (mir sonst nur noch durch seine Rolle als Prinz von Moldavien in der Serie ""der Denver Clan"" in Erinnerung geblieben). Spter bernahm diese Rolle Jason Connery, - der Sohn von Sean Connery - ""James Bond"".

Hier kann man sich nun gerne darber streiten, ob dieser der bessere Schauspieler fr diese Figur war. Und so die Serie spter an Qualitt dazu gewonnen hat. Oder ob es doch Michael Pread berzeugender vermocht hatte. Und so die frheren Folgen es mehr in sich hatten.

Ich persnlich wrde hier allerdings immer fr Michael Pread votieren. Dieser ist eindeutig auch der bessere, - talentiertere Schauspieler. Und ein dunkelhaariger Typ, als Darsteller dieser historischen Figur sah fr mich auch irgendwie berzeugender aus.

Judi Trott spielte Marian, - auch sie war besser als andere Schauspielerinnen in den verschiedenen Verfilmungen. Eben nicht nur ein hbsches Gesicht ohne Talent wie anderswo, - sondern eine richtig, agierende Darstellerin.

Besonders gut konnte aber Ray Winstone (u.a. in ""Quadrophenia"", ""King Arthur"", ""unterwegs nach Cold Mountain"", ""die Legende von Beowulf"") als Will Scarlet hier berzeugen. Im Gegensatz zu den eher farblosen Verkrperungen in frheren Filmen, prsentierte er uns hier eine recht vielschichtige und variantenreiche Version dieser Figur.

Clive Mantle gab John Little - little John, - Peter Llewellyn Williams den Much. Beide waren aber leider nicht sehr berzeugend. Sehr gut war dafr hier wieder Phil Rose als Bruder Tuck - der Mnch. Jedenfalls besser als der Darsteller (Michael McShane) in der, ebenfalls 1991 von Kevin Costner gegebenen Variante.

Und, als letzten, - dann gab es noch den Sarazenen Nasir, - dargestellt von Mark Ryan. Mag sein, diese Figur ist frei erfunden und kommt so eigentlich nicht wirklich in der historischen berlieferung vor. Ich bin aber froh darber, denn, sein Darsteller sorgte hier immer fr ein gewisses Highlight mit seinen zwei auf dem Rcken gekreuzten Sbeln.

Der einzige, dem man sofort Erfahrungen im Schwertkampf abnahm, whrend die anderen zumindest am Anfang nicht viel mehr als prgelnde Bauerntlpel hier waren. Auerdem, stellte Mark Ryan diese Figur sehr gut dar, - jedenfalls um Lngen besser, als bei Costner's Version der Schaupieler (Morgan Freeman) es konnte.

Zur Serie selber, - bzw. Aufmachung, Requisiten, Kostme, Schaupltze usw. usf. mal etwas gesagt.

Wie schon weiter oben angegeben, war die Inszenierung deutlich besser als in weiteren Beispielen hier zum historischen Thema. Man verwob gekonnt fantastische Elemente (wie z. B. Hexen, Fabelwesen, Zauberer, magisches - okkultes) mit echten, geschichtlichen Fakten (die Rolle der Kirche im Mittelalter, Antisemitismus, - und Judenprogrome, Ausbeutung der Unterschichten, Leibeigenschaft - willkrlicher Terror als legitime Form der Herrschaft).

Noch dazu waren die Standorte gut gewhlt. Wie selten zuvor wurde ein schlichtes Waldgebiet hier so mystisch und bezaubernd gefilmt. Aber auch in echten, alten Kirchen und Gemuern wurde gedreht. Dazu verband man das ganze noch mit dem fantastischen Soundtrack der irischen Folklore - Band Clannad.

Ebenso waren die Kostme gut ausgesucht, - nichts sah hier wirklich lcherlich oder gar unrealistisch aus. Gemeint sind nun also nicht die protzigen Roben der Edelleute, sondern das, was der ""gemeine Mann"" hier trgt. Man hatte eher das Gefhl, so (zweckmig, schlicht, praktisch und leicht zu kombinieren - reparieren) knnten sich Menschen dieser Epoche gekleidet haben, als bei anderen Verfimungen, die in dieser Zeit spielen sollen.

Auch, wenn natrlich oft genug, manche der Darstellungen schon recht jugendlich, - und im typischen ""80er Jahre Stil"" rber gebracht wurden. Aber, gerade das macht ja auch heute noch die Faszination an dieser Serie aus.

Zu den DVD's, - bzw. der Bild, - und Tonqualitt (englische Tonspur).

Die Gestaltung ist schlicht, - passt dafr aber ebenso zur ganzen Serie berhaupt. Auf jeder DVD erwartet einen ein einfach gehaltenes Men. Das Bild ist dem Alter und vor allem, - einer Fernsehreihe entsprechend. Wer sich hier ber nicht auf Hochglanz polierte Auflsungen usw. aufregt, kann das gerne tun. Dennoch, fragt man sich ernsthaft, - was erwarten solche Nrgler eigentlich. ;-)

Ton ist auch dementsprechend (englische DVD's), - man versteht die gesprochenen Passagen ausreichend, - der, wie ebenfalls schon erwhnt, wunderbar ausgesuchte Soundtrack von Clannad hlt sich angenehm im Hintergrund, bertnt nichts oder drngt sich gar strend auf. Schon daher kann ich diese DVD - Edition nur jedem wrmstens empfehlen.",1353628800,,6803,5.477554918815664

3411052,5,B00180IPQW,"I first discovered Robin Of Sherwood via the Public Broadcast System here in America. The local university channel carried it under the name Robin Hood. It was the best version of Robin Hood I had ever seen. I've seen several since, and in my opinion it is still the best by far. This may seem odd because of all the very unhistorcal magic, but this series comes closer to the spirit of the orginal 15th-century ballads than any other. In this version Robin is a yoeman rather than a disposessed noble. A couple of the original ballads are included in the stories, such as the tale of Sir Richard-at-Lea and the money he owes the local abbot. The acting is uniformly good and the interiors and exteriors feel real.

One of the fun parts involves the games. Robin and his men train themselves with archery contests and mock fights, and several episodes feature these games in various forms, all in fun.

It was the first version to have a Saracen character. Since then the movies and shows have all included one, none of them ever as good as Mark Ryan playing Nasir.

In my opinion it is also the only series or movie that gets King Richard right. The stories either center around the ransom collected when Richard was captured on his way home from the crusades or around the hope that all will be well when Richard finally returns. The only problem is that Richard was only back in England for a few months before he took off again to make war on France, where he was killed. If Richard saves the day for Robin in the fight against evil Prince John then what happens to Robin a year later when Richard dies and John becomes king? Robin of Sherwood gets around that by having Richard be portrayed (by the wonderful John Rhys-Davies) as the hard-bitten tyrant he was. He pardons Robin and his band on the promise that they will join him in his new fight against the French. When they agree he forces his nobles, including the sheriff, to accept the outlaws as equals. When Robin later challenges the king to devote his resources to helping the poor rather than waste them on another war, Richard secretly orders Robin's assassination. The point is that Robin and his gang are going to be outlaws for as long as those in authority are self-serving, and are safe from no one.

Toward the end of the second series Michael Praed, who played Robin of Loxley, decided to leave the series. Rather than find a lookalike actor they hit on a novel idea. There is one late legend, almost certainly false, which identifies Robin Hood with Robert, the Earl of Huntingdon. Since they had already had their Robin be chosen as 'The Hooded Man' by the Celtic forest god Herne the Hunter, they decided to kill off Loxley and have him replaced by Robert of Huntingdon, played by Jason Connery. It was a good move and the series went for another 13 episodes in that form, and had some of their best shows.

The final selling point for me was the amazing music by Clannad. At the time I described it as being ""as green as the forest itself."" I became a fan for life and now own all their albums. A remarkable group created remarkable music for a remarkable show.

Overall Robin Of Sherwood still gets my vote as the most historical and most fun version of Robin Hood.

3411053,4,B00180IPQW,"I avidly watched this series back in the day when it was on our local PBS station. The beautiful countryside and good sets that look as it did in the medievel age add to the stories. It was a good move to shoot in England. The color is sometime smeary and not clear but I can overlook that. The music is fantastic. I  love Clannad. I have to agree with the reviews that say the packaging is horrible. The discs are almost impossible to remove. I immediately put them in other sleeves which leaves me with a nice looking but not functional case that I can't use. That is a big waste. Reviewers who say the legend says this and the legend says that are missing the point that it IS a legend and in the retelling it got more fantastic and farther away from any truth that may have been in the original stories. No one knows who this man or men really were and how many followed him and what exactly went on. Since we'll never know who he was if he had a lady, who his men were (if any) we can't say the characters are wrong the stories not following the ""original"" legend or anything like that. I give the producers and writers big points for showing the Norman nobility as uncaring conquerors who barely tolerated living amongst the English types, who rolled over the serfs and peasants like they were nothing, and easily killed anyone they liked for any reason they liked. The abuses are clear and they don't whitewash the ""Great King"" Richard  but show him as a Norman conqueror who historically spent almost no time in England only spoke French and could not care less what happened to the people. Unlike other Robin Hood movies where he comes in on a white horse and saves them from the evil King John, in the end he stayed gone and died far away never thinking of his ""people"". The serfs live in squalor everyone gets dirty, betrayal and treachery are as they would be when people are so desperate and trying to survive. These people could not read, had little recreation, no education, lived in constant fear and turned to magical legends and pagan beliefs for hope when they felt totally helpless. These were dark ages and Robin Hood legends gave them secret hope and self respect. I was surprised at some of the writing of the episodes that didn't gloss over the hard way people lived in those days and how easily they could lose their lives due to someone's whim. It explains a lot about the British behavior toward people they conquered in later history. This series has a lot of drama taken from history which makes it even more interesting and makes me glad I did not live in days of old when knights were bold I promise ya!",1336867200,15,2634,4.406570841889117
3411054,1,B00180IPQW,"This is the worst retelling of a time-honored legend that I've ever seen. I purchase both books and DVDs frequently from Amazon, and this is the first Amazon purchase that I regret making. I give it one star only because I can't give it a 0. The only resemblance to the Robin Hood legend is in the names of a few characters and places. The one bright spot, as far as casting is concerned is Michael Praed as Robin, and he disappears after a few early episodes. His replacement, for the final 13 episodes, is Jason Connery as someone named Robert of Huntindon, who suddenly appears to take Robin's place, and is even referred to as Robin Hood more often than by his own name! Oh, yes. The original Robin Hood has shoulder length dark hair and sometimes -- mostly in the credits -- is shown wearing a hood. The replacement Robin Hood has shoulder-length blond hair, and sometimes -- mostly in the credits -- is shown wearing a hood.

The band of ""Merry Men"" is a small group of 5 men and a rather unconvincing ""Maid Marian,"" none of whom seem particularly merry. The band lives in the forest, the year around, apparently without any shelter whatsoever. The original 4 are Much, the miller's son, a rather naive young man who's role is to get into trouble so the others can come to his aid; Little John is a likeable but not particularly intelligent ""strong man""; a fat Friar Tuck who's character is left rather undeveloped; and a nasty, hot tempered, argumentative troublemaker, ""Will Scarlett,"" who is for some inexplicable reason tolerated by the others. A fifth member, a ""Saracen"" swordsman, joins them after a few episodes. Then, there is ""Maid Marian"" who lives in the forest with five men, who seems to be rather half-heartedly in love with both Robins, in turn, and proves to be a  skilled archer with a longbow.

The Sherrif of Nottinham is a loud mouth ""villain"" who treats his followers, including Guy Gisbourn his #2 man, with so much contempt and cruelty that it's unbelievable that his own men don't bury him alive. The story lines are developed specifically for this series and have little or no relationship to the familiar legend. The episodes are full of magic and supernatural events, there is a poorly explained ""mystery wise-man"" character, who seems to be regarded as a ""wolf"" although he wears a huge elk-like headdress. King Richard appears in a single early episode and turns out to be more of an enemy than ally to Robin.

The one unreservedly positive aspect of the DVDs is the musical score by the fine Irish band Clannad. The heavy reliance on the supernatural is, I think overdone. Many of the episodes introduce new characters, who do not reappear in subsequent episodes, and there is relatively little continuity except in a few two-part programs. I don't feel that this set is worth the price, and I'm sorry that I bought it. It won't, however, stop me from shopping at Amazon!!",1333929600,6,2909,4.67578125

3411057,5,B00180IPQW,"I recall watching some of these episodes back in the 80s and when I rediscovered the series I bought it, hoping it would be as good as I remembered.  It lives up to my memory for quality of story and entertainment value.  The quality of image is not perfect by 21st century standards, but that could be the result of both the quality of the original copies and the extreme green filtering that was used in the first season.

The story, particularly the 1st series has a great deal of coherency.  I still find it amazing the the writer was able to maintain such a consistent story over several years.  The magic in the first series is limited, subdued and more lurking than obvious.  The second series shows a certain amount of budget cutting as well as the different writers who were employed.  Magic becomes more commonplace in the episodes of the second series but does not detract from the overall story that is being told.

The Sheriff of Nottingham is particularly well played through the series as is Guy of Gisbourne.  Their changing and interweaving relationship over the series is almost as entertaining as the episodic stories and overall tale being told.",1308268800,,1165,4.699507389162561

The series includes all episodes involving both Robins and some nice extras. My only real complain is that the case feels like a DVD deathtrap. You have to have surgical precision and extra extra care to remove each DVD as doing otherwise would guarantee one or more shattering.

I will be removing the DVD's from the plastic casing and store them in an soft DVD case. ""Robin of Sherwood"" was ahead of it's time. I like the BBC America version of Robin Hood too, but this series had a grittiness to it that made it more believable. The ""pagan"" aspect of the show scared me a little when I first saw it (as a kid), but now I understand the fantasy aspect (I'm talking about the character Gunnar). The acting was incredible.

I won't say it's perfect though, but it is more realistic, even with the ""magic and mystical"" element which helps to create a real period feel to the production.  Where the series excells is the attention given to casting and the characterisation.  These guys look and feel real and ""just right"" for the part.  Every other version I have seen, whether it be movie or series, never makes the mark in my view in this regard.  The sets and costumes are wonderful.  Given the budget, and the special effects facilities of the time, this production is nothing short of a miracle.  In fact, if the FX of today were available, it may have detracted from the series, because there is a tendency to overdo, losing realism and character development at the same time.

3411070,4,B00180IPQW,"It's been years since my old VCR recordings of this show pretty much wore out and bit the dust, so I was thrilled to find out it was available on DVD.
Robin of Sherwood was a favorite of my pre-teen years and has held up very well with it's combination of history,legend and fantasy.  Some of the special effects are dated, but that's to be expected.
The real strength of the series was in the characters.  It may have been the best cast version of the story.  Clive Mantle is the best Little John, Phil Rose is the best Friar Tuck, and so on through the entire cast.  There's even the addition of Nasir who, with his man of few words demeanor and two sword fighting style was just about the coolest thing a D and D loving 12 years old had ever seen.
I do think the quality fell off a little when Jason Connery joined the show, though not through any fault of his own.  The writing focused more on plot then characters in that season and the chemistry suffered a bit from it.  I would actually give the Michael Praed episodes a full five stars.
All in all I'm glad to have found it and any minor flaws in the series are far, far out weighed by its strengths.  If you where a fan of the show you should definitely get your hands on a copy.  Though given the price it's worth knowing it's available on Netflix.

3411073,4,B00180IPQW,"The series is excellent and faithful to the literary history surrounding the Robin Hood legends. Clannad's music adds a bit of authenticity, as does the use of magic and superstition, and the UK setting.

Acorn did a reasonably good job digitizing and adding subtitles to the original film. Colour was on the dark side, but nothing that can't be adjusted.

The poor packaging of the 'complete' set prevents me from giving it a perfect score. I like the look and the folding-book concept of it, but the casing is made of hard plastic, making it prone to chipping and difficult to remove the DVDs carefully without breaking or cracking them. I had a similar problem with the ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Spy-Four-Pack-Collection/dp/B00026L9AW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Spy - Four-Pack Collection</a>"" cases.

3411075,3,B00180IPQW,"There are certain aspects of this production that are very good, & other aspects that are not so good. Pros: the locations & scenery & color are terrific. If this is not Sherwood Forest, then it seems like it could be. The locations are realistic, castles seem period appropriate, & so do costumes, utensils, & customs. Unlike other productions, I do not hear the hollow sound of plywood while the actors are walking on stone floors or earth. This production has invented its own unique personalities for Robin's band of outlaws, as some previous productions had. Some of these work well (Marian, Sheriff, King Richard, King John), others don't work well at all (Will Scarlet, Friar Tuck), etc. The element of mysticism & paganism (especially Herne the Hunter), although not seen in a Robin Hood telling before, do seem appropriate for the time period. There is a degree of reality that is missing from most earlier versions (bad guys sometimes do get killed here, instead of just being wounded). Cons: the acting leaves much to be desired; some of the actors are quite competent but others need more work. There is entirely too much screaming; screaming does not equal emoting, & much of it rings hollow. The script-writing is sub-par; some words (particularly ""idiot"") are used countless times in each episode. Some of the dialog sounds out-of-time (for some reason, ""What's up?,"" heard in two different episodes, doesn't have the ring of medieval England). The plots in the first season are too simplistic & often redundant. There needs to be more of Robin's outlaw band (even as minor players or extras); it seems like there are only eight outlaws here, not enough to be ""realistic"" (that is, according to the legends, some of which stated that the Merry Men numbered over 100). There is much in the way of action scenes here, but it is not well-coordinated & the stunts need improvement (part of the problem is that the actors do much of their own stunt-work, & it's evident in terms of slowness, lack of agility, & lack of reality). A sword fight & stabbing in this production usually looks like it's at the level of young boys playing make-believe, & comes off as phony. Overall, a worthwhile production which is fairly good, but could have been much better. The episodes greatly improved starting with the last show of the first season, & the notable improvement continued throughout the second season. The Robin of the first season was replaced by Robert, Earl of Huntingdon, played by a different actor. Viewer's opinions are divided on which actor is better, but what has significantly improved is the writing (dialog & plot), the action choreography, & continuity. The second season's shows are not redundant, are more interesting, & even returning actors seem to be doing a better job by not being quite as over the top as previously. For me, watching the first season's pitfalls made me enjoy the second season all the more. 3* for the first season, 4* for the second season.",1226880000,11,2989,4.851272015655577

8268111,5,B00180IPQW,"Originally carried by the BBC in the 1980s, Robin of Sherwood was one of the best series of its era. After three decades, its influence on how Robin Hood is portrayed can still be seen, from its over the top take on the Sheriff of Nottingham to including a Saracen as one of the merry men.
Richard Carpenter led the efforts on this show, offering a lush if somewhat grim look at the Robin Hood mythology. The scenery is remarkable and adds to the show. So does, strangely enough, the haunting and memorable soundtrack by Irish New Age band Clannad. There are some interesting threads here as Saxons battle Normans, pagans try to keep their legacy alive, distant wars and local tyranny all come together to present a fascinating tapestry.

The show lasted three seasons and there are two lead actors playing very different Robin Hoods (the plural is intentional there). Michael Praed offers a strong and fascinating take as Robin of Loxley in the first two seasons. He is helped by a great cast including Judi Trott as a strong and feisty Maid Marion, Nickolas Grace as the Sheriff and the late Robert Addie as the sneering Guy of Gisburne. Much of the story is turned upside down with Richard the Lionheart--played by the always wonderful John Rhys-Davies in a memorable guest appearance--shown in a far less heroic light that he usually is in the Robin Hood stories.

The first two seasons are excellent and moving with Praed in the lead role. But the third season, far longer than the first two, loses momentum, especially as Jason Connery (Seans son) takes over in the lead role. He simply is not as strong a lead as Praed was and the series limped to a conclusion at the end of the third season.

There is much to ponder here and the action scenes guide the show along. So do the strong cast, wonderful music and lovely settings. This show is certainly flawed as the actors sometimes ham it up, some strange mystical asides, major plot holes and plenty of unresolved threads. But it also provides moving moments (especially the end of the second season) and exciting stories. Fantasy and medieval genre fans should enjoy this show even if the third season drags as the show came in for a landing. Highly recommended.",1497052800,,2220,4.672634271099744
