5062208,4,B0077PBPNM,Enjoyed it..  Very good reflective views of artists lives and works.  The whole Art 21 DVD series is worth the time and money.,1353974400,2,126,4.434782608695652
5062209,3,B0077PBPNM,"I am a college professor for 18 years that teaches a class called ""Contemporary Art.""  I have found the art:21 series a wealth of information to share with my students about what is going on in the world of art in the 21st century.  The artists chosen for series six is for the most part the typical diverse panoply of artists getting time in the market now, which was fine.

What I will gripe about is the producer and editor's choice in how they present each artist.  It seems they themselves were trying to be ""artistic"" rather than choosing to educate the public about contemporary art. We see Ai Weiwei pieces on the screen with no explanation as to what they are about or what he did, We are given no history of Mary Reid Kelly and her various projects and only follow one, and I understand the motivation to have Marina Abramovic gaze at us for over twenty minutes, but it isn't helpful when I'm trying to educate students about her projects and the significance of her work.

My fear is that the producers of art:21 season 6 have perpetrated the myth of ""Oh those artists, they're just so opaque and odd,"" rather than to use this series as a venue to educate and include a wider audience into what is going on in the art world.",1348358400,35,1235,4.399122807017544
5062210,4,B0077PBPNM,"I Love this series, but there are SOOO many artists out there doing so many unique things and ideas. It is a pity so few very original ones are celebrated. I fear Art is going the way of Pop music.

I am diverging from the title of my review.

A lot of the words the artist use are the same. The Ideas for each artist are different, but the way each artist describes: so many of them use the same cliche explanations. 'the materials take on a life of there own' 'I am just a guide' 'I don't think about the viewer.'

Do not get me wrong.. there is goodness in what a lot of them say, and some of them, like Ai WeiWei, are just amazing.

2 cents",1343001600,,644,3.9689922480620154
5062220,5,B0077PBPNM,"My only complaint about Art 21 is that I wish the individual segments were longer for the artists I really like! When Art 21 brings us into artists studio and lets us see them in the process of making their work, this is invaluable to me, as an artist myself. I think that the series is a treat for artists and makes art more understandable to non-artists because it lets people get an inkling as to how artists think about the work they make and how much care goes into it. Art is misunderstood by so many and in this era of the erroneous belief that ""everyone is an artist"" we get to see that not everyone can or will devote the continued thought and effort required to make art. PBS should be praised (and emulated) for undertaking this series. It is well worth watching!",1414368000,,774,4.344827586206897
5062221,3,B0077PBPNM,"Background: I own all the seasons and I think I have seen all of the artists except for a few (some things I just won't watch).  I use these videos to help High School students see Art that is being made now and get a feel of the current ""Art World"" Philosophy.

Overall, I thought it was weak as far as the series goes.  I have included a little information that may help explain my rating.

Change: Fairly strong and showcases Artist with deep Social cultural impact. Artists: Catherine Opie (personal), El Anatsui, Ai Weiwei

Boundaries: varied for me with mainly a thumbs down... Tabaimo (Good), Assume Vivid Astro Focus (interesting art, ok segment), David Altmejd (boring with 50/50 enjoyment of Art), Lynda Benglis (wanted to appreciate it, but couldn't)

History: completely hit an miss, mostly miss: Glenn Ligon (good art, extremely boring segment), Mary Reid Kelley (entertaining and great), Marina Abramovi (may be good Art, but Bad, Bad, Bad Art 21 segment, there is a reason it was place at the end of the episode.  If it was at the bringing you may turn it off)

Balance: Slow but thoughtful: Rackstraw Downes (great, one if not the only realistic painter shown in series) Robert Mangold (repetitive art but informative), Sarah Sze (nice public work, average)

Hopefully that explains why I think it was average for the series: Art was ok, the segments were just not interesting. I will still use it, but very little was enjoyable for me.",1412121600,2,1452,4.7991967871485945
5062222,4,B0077PBPNM,"This series is fantastic and this volume did not disappoint. I have been
following it for some time now. And have watched other seasons.
It introduced me to some new artists' works as well as giving me
new information on artists I already knew about. It really gives the
person interested in art and culture a spark. Very well done.",1394582400,,332,4.55
5062223,5,B0077PBPNM,This whole series is just awesome. I first caught it on PBS and was hooked. It's so cool listening to artists and their mindset as well as projects they done. I also had a few 'wow' moments when a few of them had done projects I had thought I might like to do. The price to own the seasons is perfect.,1385769600,,301,3.9508196721311477
5062224,5,B0077PBPNM,"The variety of content across the series has been impressive.  This release is a near-perfect combination of artists and superior production values.  I use these videos with my advanced art classes at the high school level, following up when I am able with museum visits and further explorations.  The Season Six video resonated especially well with them!",1366761600,2,355,5.192982456140351
5062225,5,B0077PBPNM,Art 21 is always great! I love seeing and hearing from the artists in the video series. I own them all.,1362096000,,103,3.9523809523809526
5062226,5,B0077PBPNM,Great DVD! Some people argue that the Art:21 films show arrogant and self centered artists. I haven't had that feeling yet with the ones I've watched. I think that to understand an artist ones brain kinda has to be wired like one and some take it as arrogance.,1358553600,,260,4.4375
5062227,5,B0077PBPNM,Each time another dvd from this series comes out I'm there. It's interesting to have the present day artist talk about their work process and to have incite into what makes them work and grow.,1355702400,2,192,4.514285714285714
5062228,5,B0077PBPNM,Bought this for my husband. He owns all the other Seasons so this completes his set for now. He is an artist and was very pleased with this.,1355702400,2,140,4.035714285714286
5062229,5,B0077PBPNM,I come to view this excellent artist documentary series as a reference resource as much as entertainment. Can't wait for season 7!,1354579200,2,130,4.954545454545454
8511882,5,B0077PBPNM,"A must-see for artists and arts/culture-lovers alike. Great content, well-produced, and thought-provoking.",1462406400,,106,7.916666666666667
8511883,5,B0077PBPNM,I absolutely love this program...so good to be exposed to these artists that I might not otherwise find.,1453593600,,104,4.833333333333333

8511886,5,B0077PBPNM,Art:21 is the best! Beautiful series... All about the artist. Great for teachers to use in the classroom.,1444176000,,105,4.888888888888889
8511887,3,B0077PBPNM,Some of the artists chosen for this season just really did not inspire my interest. The first couple of artists covered were quite interesting. Fascinating look at the process and ideas that drive the artists. I am confused about what was considered 'taboo' as described in the blurb about the season...,1444176000,2,303,4.96078431372549
8511888,5,B0077PBPNM,I love this series! It is a phenomenal way to begin accessing and understanding contemporary art.,1437436800,,97,5.125
8511889,5,B0077PBPNM,"Really enjoy this series and if you have any interest in Art or Contemporary Society you should watch it.  Each episode show the artists hands on at work.  Every artist is given the opportunity to tell their story and philosophy, so you can see the work without a critics interpretation.  You can also see how hard the artists work to bring their vision into reality.  This is a great series and I am glad there are so many episodes to watch.  You will learn a lot.",1437264000,,465,4.3604651162790695
8511890,5,B0077PBPNM,"use for art history lessons, high school students. they are involved, engaged, and remember the artists.",1419811200,,104,5.5625
8511891,5,B0077PBPNM,"Although I'm not a huge fan of what has become a 21st century obsession with Conceptual Art, I am thrilled to watch this intelligent and sophisticated look at art, creativity and culture. The documentary style and highly sophisticated filming technique make this show brilliant in every respect. It's fascinating to hear from the selected artists about what drives them to create. I especially found Kara Walker's words (and work) to be brilliant.",1414368000,,447,5.222222222222222
