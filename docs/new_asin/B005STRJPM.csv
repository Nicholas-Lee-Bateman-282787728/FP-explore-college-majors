8485481,5,B005STRJPM,"Love Donald O'Connor!!! Here, he plays a young salesman who is kidnapped to run a foot race for a small town, falls in love with a local girl, has to deal with men trying to keep him out of the race, wins the race - thus becoming the town hero, and then ends up becoming the mayor!! Lol! :-)",1426809600,2,291,3.9491525423728815

8485483,5,B005STRJPM,Really cute movie. Donald O'Connor has such a great sense of comic timing.,1407628800,2,74,4.769230769230769
8485484,4,B005STRJPM,"This is almost an unofficial Ma & Pa Kettle film (it stars Marjorie Main and Percy Kilbride, acting very much like Ma & Pa, just with different names).  The plot is bizarre to say the least.  It involves a couple of frontier towns and the annual foot-race they bet on.  Since one town has no sure-fire runner of their own, mayor Marjorie gets into the habit of kidnapping likely contenders and locking them in a barn until they comply with her demands (run or else).  Along comes a slick salesman, Donald O'Connor, who accidently demonstrates he can run.  Before you can say unlawful detainment.......the race is on.  Into the film's brief 78 minutes, they also manage to insert an instant romance and two musical numbers.  It's inconsequential but fun.  The transfer is terrible but serviceable.  I bought it because I'm a fan of Marjorie Main.",1396742400,4,845,4.772413793103448
8485485,5,B005STRJPM,"While both Donald O'Connor and Marjorie Main were staples in comedy of the 1940's to the 1950's, this shows them in one of their early efforts. There also is the element of civic pride taken to the extremes by a mayor (Marjorie Main), and the communities best hopes of keeping their civic pride lay in kidnapping Donald O'Connor for that purposes. The opposing community was not above its own chicanery, and this added to the comic element.
