4666571,4,B005ELEN08,"I liked this dvd  and it was way better than his first one with tna, I think tna needs better dvds though but this is one of the best ones they have",1322870400,,148,3.625
4666572,4,B005ELEN08,"He's one of the top wrestling superstars over the past decade based on all the championships he's won, various highlight moments made, and his heavy level of popularity alone.  However he has also been one of the most controversial superstars as well based off his personal demons that have resulted in various incidents that caused his career to stall & take many back steps including the most recent incident back in March of this year at the ""Victory Road"" PPV.  The man is defined by his nickname of the ""Charismatic Enigma"" & he is Jeff Hardy.  Throughout this documentary & match anthology, you'll hear from Jeff along with his brother Matt & personal friend of his named Johnny along with other TNA talent like Jeff Jarrett, Kurt Angle, Shannon Moore, Mr. Anderson, Sting, Beer Money, Jeremy Borash, Abyss, Rob Van Dam, and Matt Morgan.

The documentary stars talking about the Hardys growing up in Cameron, NC before going into being a fan of wrestling & what type of style really caught his eye before doing small independent shows before Moving onto WWE with one TNA superstar openly admitting that he got the idea of using one of Jeff's moves from seeing him as an enhancement talent while Jarrett & Angle recall their first meetings with Jeff & Matt as Sting remembers the first time he saw Jeff work in the ring.  Jeff goes into how despite how popular he got that he never forgot where he came from before talking heavily about the death of his mother & how that incident helped form a close bond with Shannon Moore along with memories of his mother & how he feels she's his guardian angel.  His first run of TNA was heavily discussed next from Matt pushing him to join the company, the concept for his theme song ""Modest"", thoughts behind his debut match against A.J. Styles, Jarrett telling a story of how his dad reacted to Jeff's debut, various talents giving thoughts of how positive it was for him to be there, how Kurt Angle thinks that opened the door for other top name talents to come to TNA, and Jeff comparing how TNA was then to how Impact Wrestling is now.  The creative side of Jeff Hardy is showcased next with him discussing his music, his art work, and his infamous Alumni-Mummies before talking about his house burning down & losing his pet dog.  His return to TNA came next with a funny story of the only thing Hardy demanded to have on his debut, Moore & Jarrett going into details about how the deal came together, others opinions on him coming back, and the one superstar who admitted he was intimidated by his arrival.  You'll continue to hear from Hardy along with others throughout the match anthology on various subjects like the storylines & other competitors in the following match, his respect for A.J. Styles & how he wants that same respect back from A.J., his history with Shannon Moore, how Jeff is one of the few people Kurt Angle respects as a competitor, and his respect for Sting & how he inspired Jeff as a kid.  The biggest discussion during this section was Jeff's heel turn from who gave Jeff the idea to become the ""Anti-Christ Of Professional Wrestling"" with different people giving their opinions on it with Sting's really standing out stating that ""if it isn't broke, don't fix it"" & relating that to his own career.  The DVD set ending on Hardy talking about how his demons got the best of him but how he's changed & finally ""grew up"" after becoming a father & husband before discussing what he wants to do in the future.

Matches (hosted by Jeff Hardy himself) Include:
vs. A.J. Styles w/Abyss as the special enforcer - Talk about deja vu as Hardy's first match in TNA was against the same man here in his return to TNA with the difference being that this happened during the period where A.J. was the TNA Champion but also aligned with Ric Flair leading to Hulk Hogan making Abyss (Styles opponent at the upcoming PPV) the special enforcer to ensure Flair doesn't get involved.  Both men traded off chops in the corner before Styles focused on Hardy's leg & worked over it using the tactics done by Flair himself in the past.  Hardy did his usual unique offense during the match which A.J. was able to adapt to over time like his counter to the Twist Of Fate with the pele kick.  Nice match between the two.
""Impact"" Mar. '10

vs. Mr. Anderson - Anderson came to the ring with his ribs taped from Jeff Hardy's swanton bomb through a table on the previous Impact & controlled the match in the early moments. Hardy recovered and connected with a sweet looking jumping leg lariat off a chair on the ramp into the ring that knocked Anderson back. It got real competitive between the two men resulting in a real good match but it was the actions of both Anderson & Hardy after the match that left an impression.
Sacrifice '10

w/Mr. Anderson vs. Beer Money - This was a good basic tag team match that played out the simple formula of Beer Money cutting the ring in half & constantly working over Jeff Hardy while Anderson kept trying to make the save only to be stopped & getting yelled at by the referee before being able to make the hot tag & have the team recover on the way to victory but pay close attention towards the end of the match as somehow Mr. Anderson was busted open.
Slammiversary '10

vs. Shannon Moore - This was the result of open challenge issued by Hardy.  With Moore knowing Hardy for so long, he was able to counter & take control throughout most of the match including leaping over Hardy coming in the corner for Jeff to crash & burn on the outside, a head scissors takeover on the outside causing Jeff to hit the cement, and counter the swanton bomb.  Moore only made one mistake in this match that allowed Jeff to regain control & take advantage but this was more of a showcase for Moore (probably his best televised singles match) than Hardy was Jeff was on the defense for most of this match.
""Impact - The Whole F'n Show Special"" Aug. '10

vs. Kurt Angle - This was advertised as the first PPV match against each other & was also the semi-finals of the tournament to see who goes to Bound For Glory to fight for the TNA Championship however this was also made more personal on the previous Impact when Angle blamed Hardy for causing him to get his first pinfall loss since his return in a tag match along with the fact that Angle promising that he would retire if he lost any singles matches on his road to the TNA Championship. Angle tried to ground Hardy early before Hardy was able to cover with his usual offense. Things got very ugly early on as Angle delivered this impactful powerbomb that saw Hardy have nasty whiplash & knocked the wind out of him for a few moments while Angle delivered a running superplex from the top rope that caused Hardy to fly half way across the ring. Hardy was able to recover & pull out a few surprises of his own such as countering the Olympic Slam into a Twist Of Fate & even kicking out of Angle's signature series of german suplexes. Both men crash & burned when it came to an arial assault as Hardy missed with swanton while Angle missed a moonsault before Hardy was able to get the advantage by having his leg nail Angle in the head while doing the Wisper In The Wind while later executing the Swanton Bomb onto Angle on the outside that saw Angle take Hardy's entire weight. Angle felt the effect of the swanton as his ribs were clearly hurt to the point where he couldn't fully expand doing his frog splash before Hardy again gained control & executed two more Swanton Bomb's back to back that saw Angle on the receiving end of Hardy's entire weight before being able to block the third attempt. From here, Hardy had the anklelock applied on him 3 different times before the time limit expired causing a 5 minute overtime. Angle punished Hardy's ankle with kneedrops & stomps before applying a different variation of the anklelock & giving Hardy an Olympic Slam from the top rope. The time limit expired again which signaled for another 5 min. overtime which Hardy got more aggressive including ramming Angle's head into the steps that saw him get heavily bleeding which Hardy took advantage & applied a Boston Crab while Angle heavily bled more & more from his face (ala Bret/Austin from WrestleMania 13). After two sets overtimes, Angle's excessive bleeding, both men almost beating each other into exhaustion, and the other semi-final still set for after this match that it was declared a draw but the fans summarized this match with the chant of ""THIS IS AWESOME!"" as this was Angle's best performance since his series with Desmond Wolfe last year while this was the best non-gimmick match Jeff Hardy has had in this TNA run & even before his departure in WWE.
No Surrender '10

vs. Kurt Angle - Due to the way the previous match finished, Dixie Carter made the call to have this rematch on ""Impact"" right after the PPV with the special stipulation of it having No Time Limit, Kurt's ""retirement"" clause also still in effect, and Mr. Anderson (who was set to face the winner at Bound For Glory) coming out to do commentary.  Both men came out very battered & bruised from the previous match as Angle applied various side headlocks to ground Hardy before Jeff was able to turn the focus onto Kurt's injured ribs by throwing him into the post underneath the bottom ropes ribs first followed by a baseball slide into the ribs.  Angle took the air with a slingshot crossbody block onto Hardy on the outside & later doing a springboard moonsault off the middle ropes onto Hardy while Jeff went aerial with a swanton bomb directly onto Kurt's ribs before Kurt punished Hardy with multiple german suplexes in the row.  Both men were able to counter each others signature holds like the Angle Slam into a Twist Of Fate & later another Twist Of Fate into the anklelock with Kurt once again bleeding from the head.  Despite the ending we got, this was an unbelieveable followup to their previous match which should get extra praise considering how they gave these performances two nights in a row.
""Impact"" Sept. '10

TNA Championship Match vs. Kurt Angle vs. Mr. Anderson - This was one of those triple threat matches that was non-stop action with each men having their moments to look strong with such moments like both Angle & Hardy going after Anderson early, Kurt Angle german suplexing both men at the same time while later applying an single anklelock to both men, Angle injuring his ribs via a samoan roll from Anderson off the top rope followed by a Hardy swanton bomb on both men, and Angle delivering a top rope Angle Slam. The big story here was the appearance of Eric Bischoff with a chair looking to hit someone with it before Hulk Hogan made his first appearance in weeks coming down the ramp & getting in the ring on crutches looking ready to fight Bischoff who took one of the crutches before Hardy intervened & took the crutch from Hogan...to nail Kurt Angle with it & hit Anderson with the other one causing Hardy to pin Anderson. From there, Jeff Jarrett & Abyss came down to the ring to celebrate with Hogan & Bischoff & Hardy when RVD made his way down only for Hardy to nail him with the championship. Abyss' words rang true as ""THEY"" arrived on 10-10-10.
Bound For Glory '10
[Immortal Forever]

TNA Championship Match vs. Matt Morgan - With Mr. Anderson out with a concussion, the former ""insurance policy"" for Fortune in Matt Morgan stepped up & got the title shot here. Morgan clearly had the power advantage by tossing Hardy around early to the point where Hardy was hobbling a little bit on the outside & kept trying to stall & break Morgan's momentum on the outside. Hardy went to work on Morgan's legs by ""chopping the tree down"" to keep him down on the mat while Morgan was still able to recover with his power. There was a point where Morgan had Hardy beat but the referee got hit with Hardy's foot so the referee assumed it was a kickout when it wasn't which came off real bad to the crowd & on the camera angles. Eventually Hardy was able to retain the title after hitting his Twist Of Hate on Morgan for the third time throughout the match leading to a post match celebration with Fortune & Immortal. It was an average encounter but at the very least made Morgan look strong as it took taking Hardy's finisher three different times to put him down while Hardy was a beaten man & would have lost the title if it wasn't for the referee's mistake.
Turning Point '10

TNA Championship/No Disqualification Match vs. Matt Morgan w/Special Referee Mr. Anderson - After the issue with the referee in at the Turning Point PPV, Morgan won the right to pick Mr. Anderson as the referee for this match. Morgan dominated Hardy early with his power & size with moves like the discus clothesline & side slam before he hurt his leg after a carbon footprint & further hurt it when blocking Hardy's swanton. Hardy tried walking out of the match (since No Disqualification doesn't mean that he still couldn't get counted out) & physically provoked Anderson to throw him back in into the ring & later taking his time when attempting to count Morgan. In the end, Anderson was taken out of the contest thanks to both Hardy & Bischoff before the same referee that Immortal has been having problems with for the previous month was forced to make the three count after a third Twist Of Hate but this time on the steel chair. This match was better than their match the previous month with Morgan again showing the he was so close to the TNA Title while the story of Mr. Anderson being the referee playing out well.
Final Resolution '11

w/Matt Hardy vs. Rob Van Dam & Mr. Anderson - This match had more personal & historic factors for Jeff than anything else as this was the first time him & his brother teamed up in almost two years, first time they've teamed up in TNA, and the first time they've both been heels since 1999.  Anderson & RVD went after both of them on the ramp & brawled all the way down the ramp into the ring with Anderson being busted open in the first minute.  The big story here was Jeff Hardy avoiding RVD throughout the match with Jeff just running away from him at times & only tagging in when RVD was down.  Average tag match but only special for the historical factor in regards to Jeff & Matt teaming together.
""Impact"" Jan. '11

w/Jeff Jarrett vs. Kurt Angle & A.J. Styles - This match was a result of Fortune turning on Immortal & costing Jeff Hardy his title shot in the process while it was also A.J.'s first match back from his minor injury that kept him out of action for around a month.  This was a good tag match that went back & forth with both teams trading momentum with the main story throughout the match being Jeff Jarrett avoiding Kurt Angle to the point where he would quickly tag out whenever Styles tagged in Kurt & run away from Kurt throughout the match.
""Impact"" Feb. '11

Ladder Match vs. TNA Champion Mr. Anderson - Despite various ladders setup around ringside, Hardy came out with his own custom painted ladder before the match. As expected in a ladder match involving Jeff Hardy, there were various bumps & spots involved here such as Hardy's flip powerbomb off the ladder, Anderson back dropped on the ladder while later hurting his wrist on the steel steps, Hardy doing a springboard legdrop off the steps on the outside, and Anderson delivering his rolling samoan drop on the ladder before hitting his own swanton bomb with his head hitting the ladder. The only thing I can really say bad here was that they had an ending planned that would have looked great if they pulled it off but because of an issue with the belt, both guys landed very hard & they had to just do an audible with the finish. For Anderson not having much experience in ladder matches, he looked strong here & held his own while we know Hardy is ""at home"" in these type of matches so while he wasn't a ""car crash spotfest"" ladder match, this was really good.
Against All Odds '11

TNA Championship Match vs. Sting - Sting came into this match with more motivation & aggression than we've seen from him in over a year as he was in control from the very start & even caught Jeff in the scorpion deathlock early causing Hardy to favor his leg. Jeff was overwhelmed & he tried to walk away only for Sting to catch him & suplex him on the ramp. Hardy caught a break when Sting missed a stinger splash on the outside railing but that didn't stop Sting as he delivered three separate Scorpion Deathdrops (including one with Hardy hanging from the top rope) to dominate his way to another TNA Championship reign.
""Impact"" Mar. '11
[Immortal Forever]

The documentary was done well in a positive light (not heavily going into details about things like his legal issues, previous no-show TNA incidents, and not mentioning the ""Victory Road"" incident by name but addressing the fact that Jeff had issues with his demons  as the only thing that I would say is disappointing is how TNA didn't really go into anything about Jeff's previous run in TNA past his debut match as his first TNA set was just matches with no comments from Jeff himself about anything.  Past that, this DVD was able to talk about things that we've heard about in Hardy's previous WWE DVD's but never really went into as heavy detail about until now while also covering some new subjects.  The match selection was typical of TNA in that it covered his time in TNA up to that point so I expect Jeff Hardy fans are going to get this anyways but I would still suggest it to those who aren't his biggest fans as well.",1319673600,3,17535,4.518927444794953

8468561,5,B005ELEN08,"When TNA went head to head with WWE on Monday Nights I was very excited. I didn't believe it would be a rebirth of The Wars but I had hope and felt it would be a fun time for wrestling. When I saw Hardy Debut for TNA it was one of the major surprises. Hardy was coming off a great run in WWE. I felt Hardy could have a huge impact on making TNA better and making wrestling good again. He was a Major Main Event Star before he left WWE. I thought TNA missed the boat early on by not having a RVD  vs Hardy feud as those two were the most popular wrestlers. I think in a face vs face match the fans would win. Their WWE Invasion match was a classic.

  But getting to some of the matches on here there are hardly any duds. Hardy put on great matches with Angle and it proved Hardy to be a real top player. It's not easy to hold your own with Angle in the ring as Angle is one of the best ever. Both matches he had with Angle were great. The Bound For Glory Heel Turn match was one of Hardy's greatest matches in TNA. It was awesome. All three men put on a great show. The dvd goes on to talk about Hardy turning heel. Sting and RVD disagreed. Sting thought they shouldn't try to change something that is working well. RVD pointed out Hardy's immense popularity and how that should have been used to help the company early on.

  I think it was a great move honestly. I think it was a good idea to try something new. If it didn't work he could return to face. Like most people I agree it was hard for him to be hated. He's a likable person and despite his mistakes in his life he is a good person. In this aspect in TNA you would never see WWE turn Cena heel. So I remember being excited and interested in the story. I thought he did okay with his heel character. It didn't really work out but I enjoyed it while it lasted. Hardy had a couple matches with Matt Morgan. Morgan in my opinion should have won the strap atleast once and dropped it back to Hardy. Morgan worked hard, he was a good athlete, he was a good guy but TNA wasted him. Hardy and Morgan put on two great matches. They had good chemistry. Morgan was a big and Hardy was a faster wrestler. I thought those were some good matches on the dvd.

  Another great match on the dvd is Hardy vs Anderson in a ladder match. I was never too crazy about Anderson I thought he deserved to be champion a couple times. Anderson had some good matches with Kurt Angle early on. Anderson was billed as a major player and I think the bar was set too high for him. His TNA one was successful but he eventually leveled off. Here is one of his best matches in TNA with Hardy. There is also a match on here with Hardy and Anderson teaming against Beer Money. That was an awesome match. It was very underrated.

  The last great match was Sting vs Hardy. This was a great but short match that had a little of the old school vs the new school. It was great to see Hardy wrestling a Icon like Sting. It was a dream match. Hardy lost the belt but he lost it to one of the Greatest Wrestlers Ever. Overall Hardy had a great run with the belt. I thought he did a good job with his character and put on awesome matches. It's too bad he continued to have personal problems.

  I recommend this dvd to Jeff Hardy first and foremost. I recommend it to TNA fans because this was an exciting and different time for TNA. I recommend this dvd to all wrestling fans because it is an interesting time for wrestling. The Monday Night Wars were recreated briefly and Hardy was one of several additions in the company that was supposed to help make TNA competitive with WWE. I enjoyed this period of TNA with Jeff as the top guy. I recommend you get it at a reasonable price as copies on amazon are up to 50. Check ebay you can get it cheapier. If you do see it at a store I'd pick it up it's worth it! Cheers!",1402099200,,3834,4.058278145695364
