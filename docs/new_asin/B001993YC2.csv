3426020,5,B001993YC2,"I can't hardly wait to get the Third Season. The first and second season brought back so many memories!!! We have so many shows from the 70's out in the stores, I can't imagine not having all the seasons of the Hardy Boys Mysteries!!!!",1213660800,34,235,4.363636363636363
3426071,5,B001993YC2,"I also have season one and season two. I am eagerly awaiting the release of season 3. If each review helps, let's keep writing!",1289433600,3,127,4.333333333333333
3426072,5,B001993YC2,"What is taking so long???  This was, and is, my favorite show!  I was young when they were broadcast back in 77'-79'.  But now I have 3 kids of my own and we love to sit and watch the first 2 seasons.  My kids love it!!  I really hope they release it soon!!",1288137600,2,257,3.7735849056603774
3426073,5,B001993YC2,"I'd read the books when I was younger and was so excited when I found out there was going to be a series, and I wasn't disappointed when ABC launched The Hardy Boys.  I was immediately astounded by the utter dreaminess that was Parker Stevenson and Shaun Cassidy, but beyond that, I was caught up in the story lines and how well the brother's relationship had transferred intact to the screen.  I was a fan then and am still proud that I have both seasons in my collection, but it won't be complete without the third.  I feel that the studio has an obligation to the series fans, after releasing seasons one and two, to complete the collection.  I hope you guys follow through - we're waiting!",1281657600,4,693,4.433070866141732
3426074,5,B001993YC2,"The first ""review"" was in 2008, so I'm guessing this listing was created at that time.  2 years and it's still not released??  PLEASE make this available!",1279929600,3,154,4.666666666666667
3426075,5,B001993YC2,"The Hardy Boys was a nice calm detective show without the bloody violence that today's shows have.
To put young people on the side of the law is a good thing. The hardy boys could lie, cheat, steal, pretend to be
crooks to other crooks to nail them all in the name of justice but without being gross.",1279843200,2,300,4.189655172413793
3426076,5,B001993YC2,"--- and perhaps that is the problem. Nancy Drew was only on the first two seasons. After that it was just the Hardy Boys, and that only lasted for 10 episodes. It would be very nice to have this set completed in any case!! Time will tell! RP",1270857600,,241,4.041666666666667
3426077,4,B001993YC2,"As everybody had said in other reviews,'What is taking so long for The Hardy Boys-Nancy Drew Mysteries season 3 to come out on dvd?? Hopefully soon. They should also make it special too considering that it was only 10 episodes for season 3 Here are those episodes in case some people forgot. I'd say they should add some behind the scenes with Shaun Cassidy, Parker Stevenson & Pamala Sue Martin {Pamala was only in seasons 1 & 2} Her last episode was Season 2-13: The Lady on Thursday at Ten Original Air Date--1 January 1978. Janet Johnson took over the role of Nancy then dropped it off completely}.....and how they got their start. This season also had a different theme song for the opening credits, it was a disco version. That was one thing I didn't like in the series plus I had wish they had stayed true to the books. However, I'm still looking forward when this does comes out.

Added notation....Looks like this one will be sitting on a very dusty shelf for quite some time, simply because the sign up date here at Amazon was two years ago. Why is it so hard to release a dvd on a show that a-lot of people are so impatiently waiting for?

3426078,5,B001993YC2,I have been waiting and waiting and maybe we are finally getting close.  Could the recent price drop on Season 1 and Season 2 signal a release of a package of all three seasons?  Here's hoping!,1264377600,2,193,4.333333333333333
3426079,4,B001993YC2,I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH CHRIS M. POPLAR. SEASON 3 OF THE HARDY BOYS/NANCY DREW MYSTERIES SHOULD BE RELEASED SOON. WE HAVE BEEN WAITING LONGER THAN 2 YEARS SINCE SEASON SEASON 2 WAS RELEASED. WHAT IS UP? ALL I CAN SAY IS I HOPE THIS IS RELEASED SOON. I DON'T REMEMBER THE EPISODES FROM THIS SEASON. BUT I DON'T CARE. I WANT MY COPY NOW.,1261699200,4,335,4.25
3426080,5,B001993YC2,I too hope this Season is made availible. The studios wouldn't have to worry about sales of these old shows if they would sell them all Seasons together. If they would do the bonus and features comentary gag reels and all would be easier all at one time because the stars and others like family of stars that may be able to give an overview of all seasons maybe they will read some of these that ask the same thing that they would do it. I have the first and second seasons and waiting for the third to be released I HOPE !,1258588800,2,523,4.087378640776699

3426092,5,B001993YC2,"This is by far one of the very best show's of the 70's.  I am over fifty now and still remember enjoying all three seasons. In todays world it may seem a bit outdated, but at least this was a program you could watch with the entire family. I hope it comes out soon....",1235952000,6,268,3.962962962962963

3426094,5,B001993YC2,I got the two other seasons and have waited for this season to appear! I can't wait for the same reason as the other people who reviewed the series! This series is a great memory for me being a preteen and in love with Shaun Cassidy in 1977! The show is where I found him! It is so nice to have the show again and get to enjoy it.,1233964800,5,330,3.7971014492753623
3426095,5,B001993YC2,"I have the first 2 Seasons of ""The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries"". I remember watching them as a child, but I never got to see the 3rd Season (thanks mom and dad for not replacing the TV when it broke). I've signed up to be notified, so I hope it comes soon. I'd love to see how the entire thing ends up. I've read some reviews on the 3rd Season, but like some of the other reviewers, would like to judge it for myself. Having enjoyed Seasons 1 & 2, I anticipate that I'll enjoy Season 3. So bring it out already!",1232236800,4,515,4.0588235294117645

It would be so nice to complete the series.  I have throughly enjoyed the first 2 Seasons.",1231200000,7,159,4.129032258064516
3426097,5,B001993YC2,"I really hope Season 3 of this series gets released on DVD soon! I watched The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries when I was younger on VHS tapes and I'm glad to see it coming to DVD. I've got the first 2 seasons now and love them both! From what little I've seen of Season 3, it looks awesome! I can't wait to see it in full! And yes, I'm well aware of some fans' opinion of this season, but since I haven't seen it in full yet, I'd like the opportunity to do so, so please don't comment and tell me it's not worth seeing. I think it looks very cool and whether it was a popular season or not, it is needed to complete the series, so let's get it out on DVD soon!
 I know it's not the same as owning it on DVD, but I thought I'd let other fans of The Hardy Boys know that Netflix now has Season 3 available to watch through its subscription service! :-)
[...]

But even so, I still want to be able to own the whole series and enjoy Season 3 on DVD! The Hardy Boys rules! :-)",1227139200,4,972,3.904040404040404

I do keep going to the universal studio website to see what they have coming soon for release.  They also have a small bit about suggesting a product below the coming soon releases so I keep suggesting they release the last season.
