It was great I wasn't dissapoitnted, but I believe the manga had a different ending.  Anyway, as some people mentioned before the last episode has some translation issues, plus they are using different names for the characters which makes me wander if they used the chinnese one to translate into english.  But overall, this was a good series.",1277078400,,439,4.531645569620253
8233665,5,B000YPA7HW,"The English subtitles on this product are very good up until the very last episode.  However, I understand some Japanese, so I was able to figure out what was going on with little pain.  If you can persevere through one episode of junk English subtitles, I would definitely recommend this product to you.

As far as the story goes, it's very cute and entertaining.  Fans of Ninomiya Kazunari and Sakurai Sho should definitely watch this!",1264982400,,437,4.786666666666667
8233666,5,B000YPA7HW,"I have loved this series from the very first episode.  It is very campy with fluffy story-lines, but is so sweet.  Any hard-core Arashi fan will LOVE this!

There are 2 discs, no special features. It's hard to determine episode length, but I definitely feel like I am getting my money's worth here.  It's certainly not like an average anime disc where each episode feels like it has lasted 10 minutes.  Arashi actors, Sho and Nino are awesome in this.  The female lead in this is adorable.  I didn't notice any problems with subtitles, however I have the very final episode to watch.  Only complaint is that there isn't much information on names of actors on the disc or on the web.  The physical appearance of Taro's father is pretty strange and I didn't know if he is a Japanese Idol.  He looks almost like Peter Pan.  I suppose it's the mystery of this series.",1247616000,,863,4.503225806451613
8233667,4,B000YPA7HW,"I had the same problems with the subtitles for the last episode. The subtitles weren't the worst I've seen, they were still understandable, but it still took a little effort. The discs were a little dirty when I got them, but came clean with some water and a soft cloth. Other than that I have no complaints. This is a great drama.",1245024000,,331,4.354838709677419
8233668,3,B000YPA7HW,"Subtitles are great for the first 9 episodes.  Easy to understand with only a handful of spelling mistakes.  The last episode has more problems then the rest of the series combined for some reason.  Converted to the Chinese names of characters for some reason, and many grammar errors and sentences that don't make sense.  Also can tell that they didn't fully translated the Japanese to English.  Was a great watch for the first 9 episodes, but hard to keep watching for the last.",1235865600,2,480,4.734939759036145
