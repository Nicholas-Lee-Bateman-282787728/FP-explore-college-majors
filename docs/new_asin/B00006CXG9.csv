CONTENTS:

In BAIL OUT, the Three Stooges of bail bondsmen try to keep a witness in a drug trial from being croaked. You may want to ""bail out"" after seeing a few minutes of this one. The revved vehicles here are helicopters.

C.B. HUSTLERS was made at the tail-end of the Citizen's Band radio craze that began with C.W. McCall's song, ""Convoy."" In this one, three pay-for-play ladies and their pimp target OTR truckers to sell their wares to. A newpaperman hears their activities over his C.B. radio and begins an investigation. Mediocre.

THE CHOPPERS are a gang of juvenile delinquints who supply junkyards with parts removed from stolen cars. This one runs an hour (a LONG hour!).

THE CONCRETE COWBOYS looks like a who's who of Nashville stars, circa 1980. It's a buddy-road flick with a country flavor. Story meanders like a Tennessee back road.

DOUBLE NICKELS is about two Highway Patrolmen who moonlight as repo men. Lots of car chases.

HIJACK! is the story of two truckers transporting top secret cargo who are being pursued by terrorists.

In KILLING CARS, the inventor of a battery-powered environmentally-friendly vehicle is targeted for assassination by elements of the status quo  (oil barons, etc.).

MOONFIRE is most notable for its supporting actors. Pedro Gonzales-Gonzales got his Hollywood start from an appearance on ""You Bet Your Life,"" with Groucho Marx. Pedro's innocent charm and unknowing ad-libs charmed America in 1956. Also here is ex-heavyweight champ (and bully) Sonny Liston. The story: truckers battle a Nazi hiding out in Mexico.

SHAKER RUN has 70's poster boy Leif Garrett in it. A scientist steals a lethal bio-agent to keep her government from getting it. She recruits two car daredevils to aid her escape.

STUNTS is self-explanatory. Made for and by stunters. The story: stuntmen on a movie set are mysteriously dying, and the brother of one of them is determined to find out why.

BRENTWOOD 10 Movie Packs offer a variety of cinematic genres at bargain prices. Video transfers of their ""B"" movies are pretty decent, as is sound. The manufacturer's hinged boxes house DVDs adequately, but be careful the hinged sections don't pull away from the main spine! They're not that easy to reassemble.

7967084,4,B00006CXG9,"This review is from a truck enthusiast perspective, and on that basis this DVD set is a real gem.
First up is 'Hijack' with David Jansen and Keenan Wynn. 89 minutes with two truckers driving a mysterious cargo from L.A. to Houston. Good truck action and a reasonable story. Quite enjoyable.
Then comes ""Concrete Cowboys"", starring Jerry Reid, Tom Sellack, Morgan Fairchild, Claude Atkins (Movin On) and runs for 100 minutes. Apart from a scene early on when Tom and Jerry steal a B model wrecker, the film is of little interest, other than the Seventies re-visited... a walk back in time to strange haircuts, sideburns, flared jeans, halter tops and big cars.
'Moonfire"" is my personal highlight as the two biggest stars in this movie with the biggest roles are a beautiful two tone R700 Mack and a red cabover F series. Starring Richard Egan, Joaquin Martinez and Sonny Liston (Yes ..the boxer). This movie has some of the longest truck footage you will find anywhere. Unlike other movies where the engine sounds are not always true to the vehicles, this movie went the extra mile and makes a refreshing change.'Moonfire' is a must-see movie for any Seventies Mack lover. An added bonus is the plot. As truck movies go, this one is realistic and makes some poignant comments which are every bit as relevent today.
'CB Hustlers' is very tame, though it has some great seventies truck stop truck line ups in the opening sequence. The script involves a 'lot lizard' group of ladies hiring their ""rest stop"" services to lonely truckers. Rated R for breast shots and implied sexual activity.
The other movies are not worthy of mention in this review which is aimed squarely at the truck enthusiast.
Worth twice the price just for 'Moonfire' alone....",1052352000,15,1746,4.823333333333333
