912373,4,6304602901,"Back in 1980 when POLICE ACADEMY came out Roger Ebert gave it a Zero-Star rating. He complained about a lot of things, but I sense that his biggest complaint was that the jokes were not only not funny, they didn't even have any punch lines in it. If I had had the chance to meet with Ebert I wouldve told him he was VERY wrong in his review. POLICE ACADEMY is one of the funniest motion pictures I ever saw. Some of the biggest laughs in my experience came from this movie.

The plot of POLICE ACADEMY isn't very thick, but it sure comes up with some characters that I end up liking. In an unknown city a newly elected mayor announces that anybody can sign up for training at the local police academy, no matter what their height, weight, or educational background. Carey Mahoney (Steve Guttenberg) is given a deal to go to the academy to avoid going to jail, having already been arrested twice before. He is told that he cannot quit, but he can get thrown out. He brings along Larvelle Jones (Michael Winslow): a sound-effects imitator. His first meeting with Jones creates a funny laugh when he pretends to be a machine gun. (This is not a post-production sound effect. Michael Winslow can actually do all of the sound effects he does throughout the movie.)

The other characters create laughs in their own ways as well. Thackler (Bruce Mahler) is an accident prone cadet who demonstrates clearly when he knocks his wife out. If that wasn't enough, his wife chases after him as if she were a gymnast. Theres Moses Hightower (Bubba Smith): a very large man with superhuman strength, Leslie Barbara (Donovan Scott): an overweight cadet with a crazy dog, Thompson (Kim Cattrall): a rich girl looking for some fun in her life, Laverne Hooks (Marion Ramsey): a squeaky voiced cadet, Jorge Martin (Andrew Rubin): a Latin ladies-man, and the funniest character of all: Eugene Tackleberry (David Graf): A gun nut who gets most of the biggest laughs out of me.

The cadets are trained by Lt. Harris (G.W. Bailey) and Sgt. Callahan (Leslie Easterbrook), who likes to wear glasses and give everyone a clear look at her cleavage. Harris is an instructor who clearly does not want this class of cadets to succeed. At one point he hires two cadets named Blanks (Brian Van Hoffman) and Copeland (Scott Thomson) to make Mahoney do late night physical workouts. Copeland is a racist character who gets his comeuppance from Hightower. The academy has a head master named Commadant Lassard (George Gaines), who takes pride in the goldfish in his office. These three are just as nutty as the cadets. One of the biggest laughs is the response that Mahoney says when Harris warns him, Nobody screws with me.

That laugh wasn't the only big laugh I got from this movie. As I indicated, the funniest character is Tackleberry, who gets three more really big laughs. Ill try not to give the jokes away. The first one is when the cadets are shooting at the target range. The second is when they go through the simulated situation with a shotgun. And the biggest one of all is when Tackleberry is asked to help an old lady in front of her house. This scene is not only hysterical, it is absolutely tastless.

Then again, a lot of the gags in POLICE ACADEMY are in real bad taste. One of them involves a hooker and Lassard. Another one involves two cadets who wind up in a gay bar. However, I found most of POLICE ACADEMY to be a lot of fun. I only have one requirement in any comedy. It has to make me laugh. Good taste and intelligence have nothing to do with it.",1480032000,,3538,4.556603773584905

912554,4,6304602901,"Released in 1984, ""Police Academy"" details the amusing misadventures that take police at a police academy when the mayoress removes the conventional requirements for joining the force. No longer is sex, weight, height, etc. a factor, which opens the door for a wide range of recruits  mostly misfits  including those played by Steve Guttenberg, Kim Cattrall, Michael Winslow, Bubba Smith, Donovan Scott, David Graf and Marion Ramsey.  G.W. Bailey and Leslie Easterbrook play trainers while George Gaynes is on hand as the commandant.

I judge comedies by how funny they are and Police Academy has a few laugh-out-loud scenes with the rest being consistently amusing. Steve Guttenberg is a strong protagonist and its cool seeing Kim Cattrall when she was so young.  I like the fact that you get to know many of the recruits; you start caring for them and whether or not theyll make it. Theres a little bit of nudity and raunch that I could do without, but thats to be expected with a movie like this. In any case, its not the bulk of the picture, which focuses on goofy and dumb humor. The ending leaves you with a good feeling.

The film runs 96 minutes and was shot in Toronto, Ontario and nearby Brampton.

912879,3,6304602901,"TITLE: POLICE ACADEMY was release in theaters in the United States on March 23 1984 and it takes you 96 minutes to watch this movie. Kim Cattrall, and Steve Guttenberg Police Academy is a 1984 comedy film directed by Hugh Wilson, and starring Steve Guttenberg, Kim Cattrall and Leslie Easterbrook. It grossed approximately $146 million worldwide and spawned six sequels.

SUMMARY: A new mayor has announced a policy requiring the police department to accept all willing recruits. Not everyone in the police force is happy about the new changes. The main character, Carey Mahoney, is a repeat offender who is forced to join the police academy as an alternative to jail, a proposal by the officer who has been lenient on Mahoney due to knowing his father. Mahoney reluctantly agrees to this and decides that he will get himself thrown out. However, the chief of police, outraged by the mayor's lowered requirements, decides that the new cadets should be forced to quit rather than being thrown out. Lieutenant Thaddeus Harris, who trains the cadets, agrees with the plan and employs tactics to make their lives as miserable as possible so that they do in fact quit. Mahoney tries many schemes to get thrown out as he cannot quit, as part of the deal made with the officer said if he quit, he was going to be sent to jail. However, toward the middle of the film he decides to stay for good having fallen in love with Karen Thompson, a fellow police cadet played by Kim Cattrall. While in the academy, Mahoney becomes friends with fellow cadets Larvell Jones, Eugene Tackleberry, and especially, Moses Hightower (played by former pro football great Bubba Smith), a quiet giant of a man, after helping him prepare for the critical driving test. After passing, Hightower is very thankful to Mahoney. Unfortunately, Hightower gets himself thrown out of the academy because of an incident when, after fellow cadet Laverne Hooks has been racially insulted, in which he lifts and turns over a police car with the hated cadet Copeland inside. Soon later, Mahoney gets involved in a lunchroom brawl caused by Copeland and Blankes, and takes the blame for throwing the first punch, which finally gives Lt. Harris the green light to expel his most despised cadet. Before Mahoney actually leaves the premises, however, a major riot breaks out downtown. The resulting police emergency forces the cadets into real action for the first time. During the riot, a tough outlaw manages to steal two cadet revolvers (one from Copeland and the other from Cadet Blankes). The outlaw grabs and disarms Lt. Harris by surprise, taking the officer to the roof of a nearby building as a hostage.

QUESTIONS: Why did Despite his troubles with Harris did Mahoney try to help him? Why was Mahoney taken Hostage? Who suddenly appear on the rooftop in street clothes? Did Mahoney and Hightower graduate from the Academy? Why did Mahoney and Hightower receive commendation? What was inside the podium hiding?

MY THOUGHTS: Now thoughts about this movie! It wasn't a bad comedy, but it did lack the things that can keep your attention. However there was one actress that caught my attention and that was Leslie Easterbrook. She was the only reason to keep watching this movie. She a very lovely actress and I hope to see her in the future movies. Based on the fact that Leslie was in this I give this 7 weasel stars.",1390089600,,3379,4.842560553633218

912995,4,6304602901,"Last night's bargain-rack movie was ""Police Academy."" I remember seeing it a long time ago and remembered it as a fun movie. Well, it was. The movie set up the situation with an announcement from the mayor's office, where she proclaimed that henceforth the Police Academy was almost totally relaxing admission standards. Almost anyone could now get in. Well, that set it up, all right. The next class was a rag-tag crew if there ever was one. The movie then proceeded to trace this class through their 14 week training period and you might well imagine some of the results. It was a fun and frivolous romp. Enjoyable viewing and lots of good laughs. The movie was a bit overacted, as is common in comedies where everyone is striving hard for laughs, but I was laughing at their antics.

In the latter part of the movie, a big city riot drew the attention and demands of the police force to the point that even the raw academy recruits were given tasks, albeit minor ones such as directing traffic out and away from the riot area. However, riots can be mobile so that as it progressed, even the academy recruits were right in the heart of it and under severe testing. It was fun and frivolous. Enjoyable viewing. There is no great meaning to this movie. Don't look for it. It's just a movie where you relax and watch the fun unfold.

913049,4,6304602901,"What do Police Academy (1984) and Amadeus (1984) have in common? Well, apparently they were released in the same year, 1984, and for me, as different as they are; they both belong to the favorites. That's right, 8 times Oscar winner ""Amadeus"", the work of Art, the movie that deservingly has made the countless top lists, and the comedy Police Academy which received zero stars from Roger Ebert who called it bad and idiotic. He suggests in his review, ""It's so bad, maybe you should pool your money and draw straws and send one of the guys off to rent it so that in the future, whenever you think you're sitting through a bad comedy, he could shake his head, and chuckle tolerantly, and explain that you don't know what bad is."" Well, I've sat (or at least I tried to sit) through my portion of bad comedies and I swear, the original Police Academy is not bad. I wonder if very respected by this viewer critic ever changed his mind because I personally sat through original PA dozens of times and I like it a lot. I laugh, I have a good time and what is the most amazing thing, I remember the characters' names - it does not happen to me often. I see them all vividly and think of them with the smile - such a colorful crew of misfits who tried to make it to the Police Force. The first and the most charming is of course Carey Mahoney (Steve Guttenberg will be remembered for this role. And for Diner, of course), a repeat offender who was forced to join the police academy as punishment and tried to get kicked out for the first half of the movie. Then there is gun obsessed Tackleberry, David Graf, RIP (Son, where did you get that gun? My mommy gave it to me). Next, the sweet, shy and soft spoken Hooks; the intimidating by his size but gentle ex- florist giant Moses Hightower (Bubba Smith), Jones (Michael Winslow),the guy who could imitate any sound possible and make amazingly realistic sound effects using only his mouth; the young and sexy long before she was not so young but still very sexy in the City, Kim Catrell (cadet Thompson), and those two idiots who look like grown up Beavis and Butthead and who were the frequent visitors in The Blue Oyster Bar where they did a lot of dancing, mostly dancing. There were also memorable staff members at Lassard Police Academy, starting with oblivious forgetful Commander Lassard who liked to give the public speeches...with some special help from under the podium. There is very diligent and strict Lt. Harris who took his job in forcing new cadets to quit very seriously. There is also Sgt. Debbie Callahan in the full Valkyrie mood. To make it short - Police Academy is fun, always has been and I believe will be. I've seen it so many times I know the lines by heart and I still watch at least the parts of this classic when they show it on TV. I'll tell you what - the second and the third movies are also funny. In the second, the new character, Zed, a leader of the local gang of punks, (Bobcat Goldthwait with Ozzy -like voice) enters the series, and in the third, the reformed Zed returns as the cadet and has the funniest scenes with Tim Kazurinsky (Sweetchuck). The rest of the series get repetitive and boring but the first three movies still hold tight. Now back to the question in the beginning of my review. What do Police Academy and Amadeus have in common? Both are the winners of the Golden Screen Award which ""is presented to the distributors of domestic and foreign feature films - including documentary and children films - with more than 3,000,000 admissions within 18 months since their release or re-release in Germany"". Looks like Police Academy made it internationally, and even more - the second and the third movie also won the same award. So, Mr. Ebert, I think it is the time to admit that Police Academy is very far from being the bad movie not worthy even a star from you. Silly, witless - yes. Bad? Absolutely not.",1263859200,,3904,4.4768583450210375
913050,2,6304602901,"This is a rarity among comedies in that it actually ages quite well and the jokes are still pretty amusing albeit not perhaps as side-splittingly funny as when you first heard them but then again that's the way with most jokes anyway.  I particularly liked Harris' horse scene the best although there are ""many, many"" (ahem!)good scenes throughout the film.  If you like your comedies ala ""Animal House"" or ""Caddyshack"" style, you'll still love this good comedy.

The only problem though is with this dvd version which comes in mono sound quality and picture quality that's not the best that I've ever seen plus no special features worth mentioning.  I would like to see a Director's Cut version with at least Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound options and a vastly improved restored picture quality version with decent Special Features with anamorphic widescreen features released on either the Blu-ray or standard dvd format soon.  I thought ""Airplane"" also aged pretty well but in my opinion, ""Police Academy"" has aged better as a comedy over the years.

913051,2,6304602901,"The Bottom Line:

A stupid comedy that is sophomoric at best and moronic at worst, Police Academy has probably only garnered its status as a ""classic"" because its sequels are so poorly-regarded that even this looks good by comparison; please don't watch this when there are literally thousands of better movies you could spend your time or money on.",1234051200,2,349,4.915254237288136
913052,4,6304602901,"There certainly isn't much light I can shed on Police Academy.  Anybody who was old enough to watch a movie in the 80s is familiar with this film as well as it's many sequels(and lets not forget animated and live action TV series.  Well, it's probably a good idea to forget the live action series).  The story of a bunch of goofballs(let into the academy due to a new rule put forth by the mayor which allows anybody to join) and their shenanigans are stuff of legend.  Characters like Hightower, Jones, Mahoney, Lassard, and Tackleberry are pretty much household names.
I've always liked this movie.  Sure, it's all pretty juvenile and not every joke is a winner, but what can you do?  Some of the stuff is still pretty damn funny, a lot of the best gags going to Michael Winslow.  Winslow isn't featured in this one as much as he would be in the sequels.  And lets not forget the podium scene and the infamous Blue Oyster Bar(which is personally my favorite part of the first four movies).  A young and very tasty looking Kim Cattrall is here, but she really doesn't have much to do but look cute, and she doesn't really seem to generate much chemistry with Guttenberg.  No big deal, this is slapstick not a romance.
Watching these films is always a nice trip down memory lane for me, so thanks for bearing with me.  The 20th Anniversary edition DVD has a nice 30+ minute documentary that has interviews with director Hugh Wilson, producer Paul Maslansky, and a good number of the cast.

Don't get me wrong, it contained the classic Police Academy humor, but it took more time getting the action going due to the introduction of the characters, whereas the sequels got the characters immediately into action.

 Those who are disgusted with the entire ""Police Academy"" series have to look no further than this first movie to find the root cause of their misery. Grossing 81 million dollars in 1984, ""Police Academy"" set the template for the future movies. The style of the series was set with this first one, though the next six movies never quite hit the level of quality (such as it is) that this first film did.

 The new Mayor has relaxed the standards for new recruits to enter the Police Academy. Now, anyone can sign up, and people who would have never considered joining the police force are now attempting to do just that. Included in this group is Carey Mahoney (Steve Guttenberg). Mahoney cannot seem to stay out of trouble with the law (petty stuff, really, nothing malicious), and he is given the choice to either join the Police Academy or go to jail. He is told that he cannot quit, but can be thrown out (little does he know that part of the deal is that the Academy cannot throw him out, either). Mahoney, the prankster that he is, does his best to get thrown out of the Academy.

 Along with Mahoney, the Police Academy has several other zany new recruits, among them is the gun loving Tackleberry (David Graf), the soft voiced Hooks (Marion Ramsey), a man with a talent for imitating nearly any sound effect in Jones (Michael Winslow), and also Karen Thompson (Kim Cattrall) who appears as Mahoney's love interest. Calling the cadets ""screwball recruits"" would be perfectly appropriate, and Lt Harris (G.W. Bailey), an instructor at the Academy, wants them all out and sets them up to fail.

 ""Police Academy"" has something of a slapstick comedy. It is very lighthearted, and the characters (the good guys, anyway) are very likeable. I don't think I would want these recruits in an Academy near me, but it was always fun watching this movie. And that is what ""Police Academy"" is all about: fun. It seems like everyone in the movie is having fun making it, and it works. Granted, the movie is not nearly as funny as I originally found it ten years ago when I was 15, but I can still manage smiles of nostalgia while watching ""Police Academy"". The characters which the movie focuses on are those, with a couple of exceptions, who will return for sequel after sequel and they are fun characters to get to spend an hour and a half with.

 ""Police Academy"" is the only one in the series to get an ""R"" rating, which is for female nudity and language. After this one, the series starts to get sanitized, which also seemed to tame the comedy as well. This first film sets up many of the running jokes that continue throughout the series, and perhaps for this reason it is the best of the bunch because it is the most original of the bunch. Still, it is an enjoyable movie.

913102,5,6304602901,"On March 4 of this year, the newly elected mayor announced that she was changing the hiring practices of the city's police force.  No longer would height, weight, sex, education, or physical strength be used to keep new recruits out of the Metropolitan Police Academy.  Hundreds of people who never dreamed of becoming police officers signed up immediately.  Naturally, the police completely freaked.  -opening prologue of Police Academy.

OK, so this is dated in terms of style and the chauvinism rampant in 80's comedies, but seeing it again for the first time in nearly twenty years brought back some nostalgic memories.  Granted, it's not an all-time classic, but hey, at least it's not as raunchy as American Pie.

Diehards of the old school like academy chief and Lieutenant Thaddeus Harris work on a plan to make things tough for the new recruits, not by throwing them out but to make their training so miserable, they'll quit on their own accord.  Harris handpicks a Mutt-and-Jeff pair (both with crewcuts, no less) named Copeland and Blankes to help him weed out the scumbuckets, dirtbags, or whatever unpleasant name he has for the other recruits.  Yes, they'll learn about firearms, local laws, police procedure, and many many other things.  Well, it's mainly the first and last that happen in this classic 80's comedy.

Then again, they were up against the likes of Carey Mahoney, the Monsignor Larvelle Jones, the suave lounge lizard George Martine, Leslie Barbara, Doug Fackler, and Tackleberry.  Mahoney is the main character and he's at the Academy as part of a deal with his friend Captain Reed, of a choice between the academy or the lockup for another minor offense.  And he can't quit as part of the deal-hence he tries to get himself kicked out by his antics.  For the most part, the main victim is Lieutenant Harris. The funniest moment involves Harris, a borrowed motorcycle, a parked car, and Harris flying into the air towards the rear end of a horse.  To which Mahoney says, ""Someone call a veterinarian!""  Basically, some of the plot involves Mahoney pulling a prank on Harris, and either being called to Harris's office or being forced to do punitive exercises supervised by Harris or his handpicked student squad leaders, Copeland and Blankes.  However, Mahoney plays a real nasty and funny trick on those two involving the innocuously named Blue Oyster Bar.  And as for Commandant Lassard, that involves a funny moment at a podium.

Larvelle Jones has to be my favourite character here.  He has an uncanny gift for sound effects, and when he and Mahoney first meet at the police station waiting room, he demonstrates his ability by imitating a machine gun.  Another one has him imitating the squishing sounds shoes make as the inspecting officer walks past the row of recruits on the academy lawn.

Mahoney's roommate, Tackleberry, is a gung-ho type who wouldn't be out of place in Vietnam.  Call him a more comic version of Animal Mother in Full Metal Jacket.  He has guns that blow the heads off the firing range targets and his funniest moment involves the firearms drill, where he goes nuts.  When he says, ""It's time this cop met the public,"" watch out!

But there are others.  Laverne Hooks, a short gentle black with a shy, timid voice, Doug Fackler, whose specialty is slapstick, mainly being clumsy at someone else's expense, Lesley Barbara, a chubby white guy and another timid soul, and Hightower, a quiet, towering black man who seems most likely to succeed, except for one thing that he needs help.  And this is one of Kim Cattrall's early films.  She plays Karen Thompson, Mahoney's love interest, at least when he's not asking her to bare her thighs.

Steve Guttenberg (Mahoney), Michael Winslow (Jones), and David Graf (Tackleberry) boost this comedy, as does G.W. Bailey (Harris).  But the others are good too.  This is the best of the seven movie series.  Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there.",1091145600,13,3951,4.90210843373494

Also joining are Eugene Tackleberry(the late David Graf) who's a gun-lover,Karen Thompson(Kim Cattrall) who becomes Carey's girlfriend,Moses Hightower(football great Bubba Smith) who's a florist,George Martin(Andrew Rubin) who pretends to be Latin to score with women,Doug Fackler(Bruce Mahler) who joins against his wife's wishes(she joins 2 sequels later against HIS wishes!),Kyle Blankes,a mean-spirited fella and his buddy Chad Copeland,also mean-spirited. Carey misbehaves as much as he can to get evicted,because he initially didn't want to join the PA. He later changes his mind. George Gaynes is Commandant Eric Lassard and George R. Robertson is Commissioner Henry Hurst. G.W. Bailey of TV's M*A*S*H,is lieutenant Thaddeus Harris,who with the help of Kyle and Chad,rids the academy of undesirables(""scumbuckets"" as Lt. Harris calls them). Memorable scenes include Carey teaching Schwarzenegger-ish Hightower how to drive in Chad's car! The car is damaged and Chad and Kyle put the blame on Carey who dare him to ""throw the first punch"",since Carey was initially scheming to be evicted. Also part of the cast is Marion Ramsey as Laverne Hooks,a short,soft-spoken African-American woman. Take note of how in another scene,she gets loud and nasty towards a criminal(""DON'T MOVE,DIRTBAG!""). That quote would be used in the sequels as well. Leslie Easterbrook of TV's Laverne & Shirley is Seargent Callahan who along with Lt. Harris,trains the cadets. Another memorable scene is where a concealed hooker performs oral sex on Commandant Lassard while he stands behind a podium. Carey was co-concealed inside the podium,the hooker emerged,Carey remained,and Lassard thought Carey performed the sexual act! Also,Martin,in drag,sneaks into the girls' dormitory and is finally caught by Callahan,who removes his wig,brassiere and dress. This popular film was directed by Hugh Wilson,who'd subsequently direct THE FIRST WIVES CLUB. Guttenberg stuck around for PA2,3 and 4.",1084924800,,2533,5.721485411140583

My favortites in this film are Larvell Jones (Michael Winslow) a person who can make the sound of everything he sees, Eugine Tackleberry (David Graf) a man who is totally obssesed with guns, and Dougles Fackler (Bruce Mahler) a man who causes accidents and riots and doesn't even know it.  I'm glad they're finally bringing out a 20th anniversary edtion, but the best part of it is, all the Police Academy films will be on dvd.  You can buy them seperat, or in a great box set that has all seven films in it.  The whole series will be realesed on dvd April 6.  This film will have a commentary, trailer and a docementary.  The commentary will be by actors Steve Guttenberg, Micheal Winslow, Leslie Easterbrook, G.W. Bailey, Director Hugh Wilson and producer Paul Maslansky.  So mark your calender for April 6, because Police Academy is coming to dvd.
P.S. Just so you know, I'm sad to say, the actor who played Tackleberry, David Graf, passed away last year.  So I doubt there will be a Police Academy 8.",1078790400,,1152,4.663366336633663

913147,5,6304602901,"Well well, where does a Guttenberg good guy like me start. Guess I should stat at the Turner family compond back in the winter of 87. That is the time and the place where I first saw this film and were my love of all things Police Acadamy and Stevie Guttenberg started. I do declare that I howled and howled with laughter as the comical plot unfolded in front of my water drenched eyes reaching the stunning riot finale. Since that day I have been forever touched by Police Acadamy and left with the view that Police Acadamy was and still is an overlooked American comedy classic. Lets start then by talking about Stevie Guttenberg's undoubted comic acting abilities.
 Indeed I first think we should be talking and thinking about Guttenberg with the likes of Ted Danson & Pee Wee Herman in mind. We need to place Guttenberg on a comic plinth, to establish his comic postion within the halls of the great Hollywood tradition of Slapstick comics. If you look at the rest of the Acadamy trilogy, the pictures Guttenberg did not star in are noticable worse and I mean noticable. Of course they still have the gags that you want and some of the characters you want but the films do need Guttenberg's comic quips and timing to bring the sequels in line with the first installment .Theres just something about Guttenbergs charm and confidence that as ive spoken about earlier I liken to  the great Ron Howard and like Howard's Richie Cuningham, Guttenberg makes the Mahoney role his own with a combination of style and slap stick nonsense. Oh yes I did say nonsense and theres plenty of that too.
So what about the film I hear you wannabee Guttenbergs cheer? Well As a kid I really connected with the childish, toilet humour that is the backbone of this great movie and the whole of the trilogy. The film contains so many references be it sexual or personal and so many in jokes that there really seems to be a laugh a minute. remeber all this is good, harmless humour. Classic gags and scenes such as Captin Harris going head first at great speed into a Horses rear is funny but not offensive. Its childish, stupid and mind numing comedy but it is comedy and bloody good it is too.
Of course all things had to come too an end and Hollywood in there great wisdom made alot of sub rate Police Acadamy's in the years following the critical and commercial success of the Original. Fear not though theres still the original & I plead with all of you comic lovers out there in the big wide world to got THIS BOUGHT. Nuff Said",1070236800,,2513,4.49671772428884
913148,5,6304602901,"I admit that I got plenty of laughs out of sequels 2 through 4. Installments 5 & 6 were okay, but nothing special. As another reviewer has already pointed out, once Steve Guttenberg left there was little reason to keep watching.
The first Police Academy movie is truly the cream of the crop, though, as is usually the case with any series of movies.
The premise is simple enough - the new female mayor has dropped the height/weight/physical regulations of the police force, and opened up the police academy to anyone who fancies themselves as a cop. Naturally, this leads to a crazy assortment of oddballs rocking up for training.
Among this crew is Hightower, a seven foot plus man built like a brick wall; Tackleberry, a gung-ho trigger happy gun buff who seems a sandwich or two short of a picnic; Hooks, a little woman with an even littler voice (until the right moment); Jones, whose vocal chords can replicate just about any sound from video games to machine guns; and last but definitely not least, Mahoney, who is at the Academy only as part of a deal to keep him out of jail for his latest idiot exploits.
The latter cannot quit the Academy under the rules of the deal, but can be thrown out without landing in jail as a result. Consequently, he pulls every stunt under the sun to try and get himself kicked out, to no avail.
It is no surprise that, somewhere along the line, misfit Mahoney discovers that he might actually like to be a cop, and decides to stick at it rather than put all his efforts into getting thrown out.
The climax of the movie, a riot in which the cadets accidentally find themselves smack in the middle of, proves that even the worst hopeless cases can do good for themselves.
The final scene, in which all the cadets graduate, is about as uplifting as a screwball comedy can get.
Steve Guttenberg and G W Bailey really make this movie with their constant interaction and clashes. Bailey was at his best in this film as the sergeant who was determined to 'encourage' all the 'loser cadets' to quit as soon as possible.
This is an excellent movie. It rolls along at a great pace, building up to an exciting climax with a more than satisfying ending. The movies that came after were really just eye candy after this one - pleasant to watch, but not very substantial. If you don't have this film, and you're a fan of this type of comedy, do yourself a big favour and buy a copy. You won't regret it.",1060646400,,2429,4.472972972972973
913149,5,6304602901,"I first got into Police Academy when I was 10. We rented this 80's stunner from the video shop as my Mum wanted to keep me amused for a few hours so she could do the ironing. Well all I can say is the rest is history and from that moment on I was hooked on the whole Police Academy trilogy and Guttenbergs style and brilliant comic timing.
So why is it such a good picture?Well from the comical brass music at the start of the picture to Guttenbergs stunning comical performance which I put up there with the greats like Chaplin in ""Modern Times"" the film just provides a gag a minute. Guttenberg of course went on to do a great body of work like ""Short Circuit"" and the oscar wining ""Coocoon"" not to mention ""Three men and a little baby. If ever you needed to select a symbol for 80's comedy it would surley have to be Guttenberg. So get some popcorn and grab a coke and sit back with your partner to the perfect comedy night in.

913288,4,6304602901,"Steve Guttenberg stars in this 1984 comedy directed by Hugh Wilson and featuring Kim Catrall (TV's Sex and the City, Crossroads).  Guttenberg plays a man, not caring about life and doing nothing.  After he almost destroys a car he gets a choice: Go to jail or go to the police academy.  If he quits, he goes to jail.  However, if someone throws him out he will go back to his normal life.  And as much pranks Guttenberg pulls, he still cant get himself out.  Then he realizes that maybe being a police officer isn't the worst job in the world.  This was the movie that started it and that would go on to have five sequels.  Perhaps the first one of the series is the best one though it's the only one rated R.  It's a very entertaining movie with a lot of laughs.  My favorite characters were definetely Mahoney (Guttenberg), Hightower(Bubba Smith), and Barbara (don't know his name) who sadly didn't appear in the sequel, Police Academy 2:  Their First Assignment.",1030579200,,965,4.5523255813953485
913289,5,6304602901,"This first in the series still remains my favorite. The characters were new, diverse and above all believable, while the gags were fresh, creating a colorful merry-go-round of laughs. In addition, the characters are mostly all likeable and evoke empathy. Sure, there's a lot of slapstick and the humor gets a bit crude at times, but I love it still as much as I loved it then.

This is the beginning of series of movies which creates classic characters such as Hightower, Hooks, Tackleberry and Captain Lasard.  Got to have a since over humor to enjoy this film and Mahoney represents the kind of person many people would like to hang out with.

913293,4,6304602901,"This is by far the best and most consistently funny of the 7 Police Academy films.  They pretty much got worse as they went on.  Some of the funniest gags take place in this one: Tackleberry going nuts during obstacle training, Harris driving the motorbike into the back of a horse, Hightower tearing the seats out of the car and also flipping one over with his hands, the infamous podium/hooker scene, and of course Mahoney and Jones(the sound effect guy) have several funny scenes.  Fans of the series will want to have this.  The DVD isn't bad for a cheap one.  It includes only the full screen version(bummer), the languages/subtitles(of course), cast and crew bios, interactive menus where you can read facts about the film, a reel recommendations section which suggests another Steve Guttenburg film and other films that are also funny (such as Austin Powers), and a scene selection which is common but welcome.  The best part of the DVD other than the film itself is the inclusion of all 7 theatrical trailers for each Police Academy film.  Genuinely funny and contrary to other reviews, this is no where near the worst film ever made.  See it for yourself many many many times on many many many different occasions (inside Police Academy joke).",978739200,8,1252,4.817757009345795

Personally, I simply never found any of it to be funny, and found it to be extremely poorly written and concieved.

If you're not looking for a lot of physical jokes hinged around the concept of a police department without any physical requirements of its officers (he's way too fat to be a cop!) then you're probably looking in the wrong place.",978134400,6,591,4.363636363636363
