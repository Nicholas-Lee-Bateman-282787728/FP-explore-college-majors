2290832,1,B0009HLCUQ,"I really like good Japanese movies-I have 114 of them-but this isn't one of them.

Somehow-criterion decided to put this disaster out--a movie that ranks as bad as ""In the Realm of the Senses"" or ""Visitor Q""--a trilogy of bad Japanese movies that make Godzilla seem like classics.

Quite a bit of s&m--if one likes fantasizing about beating women or being beaten--certainly not arousing for most people I would hope.

A young girl is raped and left in a field by American GI's--she then turns to prostitution and moves into a bombed out wreck of a building with several other working girls--to be joined later by a petty thief-hiding out after stabbing an American soldier-who somehow enamors all the women.  The rule at the ""house""-is no free sex--and the punishment is severe--a cow is butchered later for some odd reason--fairly graphic and totally unnecessary--and a Priest commits suicide.

There is no real plot--the movie just rambles along--pretty incoherently for the most part.

Hard to believe only one year later Suzuki would direct ""Story of a Prostitute""--a movie which is actually pretty good

The nudity in this movie is fairly mild by todays standards--though the abuse the women give and receive is pretty degrading.

I personally can't recommend this movie for anyone of any age.

If criterion thinks this is a great movie--maybe it's time for them to put out ""Plan 9 From Outer Space""-it's more interesting than this lame exercise in misogyny! Considering ""Raves"" about the ""brilliant"" use of color--about as brilliant as Vampira wearing black all through ""Plan 9""--to find anything ""brilliant""about this movie--one has to really embellish the very little that there is.  Despite my own references to ""Plan 9""--this movie is probably more comparable to another Ed Wood clunker--""The Violent Years""

For a better representation of post-war Japan--I recommend Kurosawa's ""Stray Dog""-it was filmed in 1949--not long after wars end--and is much better film than this-and in my opinion presents a better and more accurate ""picture"" of the Japanese people in the aftermath of World War 2.",1126483200,6,2102,5.152941176470589
2290833,5,B0009HLCUQ,"This 1964 film reminds me of the great work that the American movie industry turned out (sometimes in spite of itself) during the 1930's and 40's. Like many films under the ""Hollywood System"", Gate of Flesh is a product of artists under contract, who were simply given a project, a small budget, and a brief shooting schedule. All the studio that released Gate of Flesh really wanted was a quickie - a soft-porn moneymaker. What they got from director, Seijun Suzuki, was a masterpiece.

Briefly told, the film tells the story of a group of prostitutes making their Darwinian way in the charred rubble of postwar Japan. The girls have one, simple code: If you make love, you make money. To make love without charging is a disgrace, resulting in a naked beating and banishment from the group's mutual protection. The women strut the streets in a crowded, nightmare world of thugs and thieves, where love is rejected for the more primal needs of survival. A ""returnee"" from the war enters the prostitute's strangely insulated world and things become - unbalanced.

Seijun Suzuki's direction is astounding in this film. Working with the brilliant set designs of Takeo Kimura, Suzuki creates a world that is surreal yet somehow satisfies the eye's need for reality all at once - a kind of ""symbolization"" of reality. As with a lot of Suzuki's work, he displays a painter's sense of color, and the film is beautiful to look at. Despite the fact that the film was shot entirely on the back lot of Nikkatsu Studios, Suzuki is able to portray the feel of a large burned out city through pure, brilliant shot choice and placement of action.

It was impossible, of course, for Suzuki to simply deliver the skin flick the studio expected. Instead, he created a brilliant film in which women are hung naked and whipped for daring to make love for free  --  a complex film that is a study of the effects that defeat, humiliation and ruin visit on the soul, and the soul's indestructible quest for safety and love.

There are many strong performances here. Joe Shishido is superb as Ibuki, the swaggering, nihilistic ex-soldier, slowly but painfully submitting to his intrinsic sense of honor. Also great was Satoko Kasai as Sen, the leader of the whores. Dressed in red, she is a tall flame always at the center of the group, laying down the law and administering the beatings. Actress Kasai, who grins throughout only to display sharp teeth, offers one genuine smile in the film, and it is a moment of transcendent hope and heartbreak.

The Criterion Collection edition of this film is a nice package. I owned the film in VHS, and it is simply a different experience watching this digitally re-mastered edition. It is truly stunning. The special features are a bit slim, but they do offer one whopper: an interview with both Seijun Suzuki and Takeo Kimura, who was the production designer. Listening to these men speak was certainly fascinating from a ""film-school"" kind of perspective, but they also offered a different cultural perspective as well. Hearing Takeo Kimua say simply and calmly, ""My own house was burned down because of the bombing, so having such memories probably helped me creating the sets,"" really slams that home in spades. -Mykal Banta",1125100800,10,3245,4.825539568345324
2290834,5,B0009HLCUQ,"Yet another brilliant work from director Suzuki Seijun, who manages, in this film, to create a world in which lurid pulp paperback cover paintings have come to life!  This tale of black market thugs, prostitutes, and the  rampant desperation of mere existence in post-WWII Tokyo is incredibly  stunning on all counts.  Suzuki somehow manages to be bleakly realistic and  gloriously surrealistic all in one brush stroke.

8060958,5,B0009HLCUQ,"After WW II, a gang of prostitutes has their home base in the slums of Tokyo. They live in a world where the old generation of `big shots still talk big.'
For them, `democracy means (having sexual intercourse with) foreigners.' These foreigners are GIs, members of the occupying forces in Japan.
The main principle of the gang is `no sex for free'. If a member of the gang transgresses this rule, she will be harshly punished. The movie contains some very sadistic lashing scenes.

Vision on mankind
Seijun Suzuki unveils in an interview published on this DVD his view on mankind: `physiology is the strongest force and only acts through human will. We can depend on nothing but the physicality of the flesh.' The gate to the world is the gate of flesh, where you have to `rely on your own instincts'.
Morality and religion, here represented by a black catholic priest, are hopeless pipedreams.

Highly recommended, like other films by Seijun Suzuki's: his `manga' movie `Pistol Opera', his `ghost' movie `Princess Raccoon' (with Ziyi Zhang) and his gangster movie `Underworld Beauty'.",1370476800,2,1085,4.956043956043956
8060959,4,B0009HLCUQ,"Gate of Flesh (Seijun Suzuki, 1964)

Bad-boy director Seijun Suzuki, whose entire career seems to have involved pushing as many envelopes as possible, helped usher in the pinky era in Japanese cinema with Gate of Flesh, a period piece set just after World War II, when rationing was in effect and women who found themselves without families seem to have had no choice but to become prostitutes.

Maya (Yumiko Nogawa) is one of those girls. She starts out the film as an innocent, but is very quickly adopted into a group of freelance prostitutes who live by a strict code. The opening scenes of the movie depict Maya's transformation from innocent to professional, but she never really gives up most of her idealism. Enter Shintaro (Jo Shishido), a small-time swindler injured in the murder of a G.I., who comes back to the girls' house to recuperate from his injuries. As the two of them grow closer, Maya finds herself struggling not to break the girls' one main rule: never fall in love.

One does not really expect greatness from a pinky film, especially those of us who aren't old enough to have been around during Suzuki's golden age (he's still alive, and as of this decade, still directing-- Pistol Opera appeared in 2001-- but he stopped cranking out movie after movie back in the early eighties). But Gate of Flesh is something entirely different; it puts me in mind of Samuel Fuller or Nicholas Ray, but with added sex. The acting here is exquisite, and the direction is inspired (but those who are aware of Seijun Suzuki would expect nothing less). ""Gorgeous"" is not the correct work for Shigeyoshi Mine's soiled, smoky cinematography, but you get the idea; even with thirty-four years of film stock degradation and Criterion's well-meaning but often slightly off remastering, the sets and/or locations (I've no idea if this is a soundstage or the real thing, which in itself is mighty impressive) leap off the screen. Good stuff, this is, and definitely deserves a wider audience on this side of the Pacific than it's gotten. In a world of pinky, Gate of Flesh is a rich, vibrant blood red. ****",1219104000,,2108,4.785714285714286
8060960,5,B0009HLCUQ,"Brutal and unabashedly lusty, Suzuki's ""Gate of Flesh"" is unlike other B-movie cult classics with its self-consciously flashy editing and nightmarish artistic design. Disciplined by their sadistic leader, Komasa Sen (Satoko Kasai), this gang of hussies has been taught never to give away their bodies, so Ibuki's criminal pedigree and hunky air throws them all into heated conflict, as each wants to possess him. No mere exploitation flick, ""Flesh"" gets a lot of mileage out of its visual appeal, torrid (and twisted) love story, and stinging criticism of the Occupation.",1182902400,,571,5.355555555555555
8060961,5,B0009HLCUQ,"I admit some degree of defeat after watching Seijun Suzuki's film Branded to Kill. Here's a movie that messed with my mind something awful; that constantly required me to reset my thought process just to be able to make heads or tales of what I was seeing. But every time I would calibrate my brain to get in step with Branded to Kill, the damn movie would do something perplexing to throw me off. There were some parts of the movie that I could comprehend, like a grown man peeing his pants. Or people with guns running around. Those things made sense to me. But otherwise I was dumbfounded.

Recently, I decided to give Seijun Suzuki another shot and check out his prostitute exploitation movie, Gate of Flesh. Man, what a completely different experience this movie was. While Branded to Kill is a frustrating avant-garde attention span torture device of a movie, Gate of Flesh is about cute Japanese prostitutes who wear colorful dresses... and torture the sweet crap out of each other.

Set just after World War II in Japan, when American soldiers were ever-present and the stench of desolation and defeat burned the collective nostrils of a once proud nation, Gate of Flesh is joyfully grim heap of fun. Seijun Suzuki himself acknowledges that this movie was intended to be an exploitation picture, but that didn't stop him from loading Gate of Flesh with lovely colors, stylish sets, and quirky visual flourishes. Gate of Flesh combines two of my favorite things, visual flair and tittilation, into a handsome package.

The main characters of the film are a group of prostitutes that don't see much good in slaving for a pimp, so they take care of each other under one condition: don't provide sex for free. This, of course, rules out having any meaningful relationship with men. When one of their group does attempt a non-business relationship, the penalty is harsh. Even though Gate of Flesh was made over forty years ago, I would have to say that it would probably get a light R-rating if it was made today. There are a few brief glimpses of female skin here and there, but the punishment scenes coupled with the frequent profanity would probably still get many viewers' panties in a bunch. There are way more graphic and sadistic movies out there, but considering the time that Gate of Flesh was made and the skill behind it, I was pretty impressed.

In an interview, Suzuki mentions how it would have been easier to make the movie right after the war ended because then he would have had real burnt out buildings to use. Though this would have probably made Gates of Flesh more realistic, I think that the sets add distinctiveness to the film. The art decoration in Gate of Flesh is borderline beautiful at times, and a more realistic approach would have greatly altered the look of the film, I believe. In Suzuki's hands, though, it may have been just as appealing.

Along with Nights of Cabiria, which I truly adore, Gates of Flesh stands as one of my favorite films about prostitutes. When I think about it, I realize that neither of these films portrays prostitution in a realistic manner. Both are somewhat fanciful in their approach, and while Gate of Flesh is considerably more gritty than Nights of Cabiria, it's really just a torture movie with pretty colors and prostitutes that are more attractive than they should be. Yes, I am a shallow escapist, thank you very much.",1166832000,7,3391,4.730964467005077
8060962,5,B0009HLCUQ,"Back in 1964, as it is still to this day, Japan has always rated their movies for two specific audiences only.  In America, we rate movies, R, PG, PG-13, and even G (although, I don't think anything qualifies as G anymore).  In Japan, it's either Adult or General Audience.  This movie ""Gate of Flesh"" is definitely a Japanese Adult film.  We get nudity, sex, fowl language, and even violent beatings and torture.

I love the raw, filthy extent of decadence that Seijun Sazuki has created for this film.  Out of all the film's he's created, for some reason, he seems to be mildly ashamed of this one.  He and production designer Takeo Kimura has created a cult classic of fabulous artistic visual achievement.

As you are aware, this film is about the life of prostitutes living within the war ravished ruins of the streets of Tokyo, just after the end of World War II.  The main focus is on 5 Japanese girls.  Prostitutes that work for themselves (no pimps), and share a burned out abandoned building, and live by certain set rules.  They sell themselves on the streets and keep their money for themselves, however, if any of the girls give away sex for free, the other girls will tie her up and beat her senseless.  All the girls are beautiful and yet their sweaty, filthy appearance actually contributes to what makes this film look so good.

What makes this film so beautiful to watch is how each of the girls wear a specific color of dress, which adds to the way the girls differ from each other, and although it was never initially intended, the Japanese audience actually created a personality perception based on colors, of the girls identified by the specific colors of how they were dressed.  Here's the interpretations of how the girls are perceived:

Roko (Tamiko Ishaii) dressed in Yellow, is said to represent kindness and compromise.

Sen (Satoko Kasai) dressed in Red, is said to represent belonging or fear.

Maya (Yumiko Nogawa) dressed in Green, is said to represent peace and tranquility.

Mino, (Kayo Matsuo) dressed in Purple, is said to represent loneliness and anxiety.

Machiko (Misako Tominaga) dressed in White, isn't given a description of her persona, which is why they probably just had her dressed in white and used her as the fallen one who has broken their most enforced rule: giving it away for free.  Machiko was married to a man who died in the war, so she, more or less, is just trying to find a new love.  She sees a man on a regular basis and never takes any money. So eventually, she getsa caught by one of the other girls so they wait for her when she returns to them.  She then gets stripped, tied-up, then beatened by the other girls just within inches of her life.  To Japan, this must be acceptable behavior for prostitutes in Japan, and therefore, entertainment as well for the adult audience.

But, alas, a new obstacle enters the girl's domain.  A runaway fugitive named Shin Ibuki (Jo Shishido), enters into the girls homestead and then begins to order the girls around.  He's injured so he doesn't plan on leaving anytime soon and his aggressively mean demeanor is actually somewhat appealing to the girls.

The girls suddenly begin to have yearnings to be with Shin although they all know they must not break their most brutally enforced rule.  Shin will not stay much longer, so Maya takes a chance at giving herself to Shin and hopes that he will take her with him when he leaves.  She seduces him when he is drunk, and Sen catches her.  Now, it's Maya's turn to be punished.

In the making of this film, you will see that Americans have set up a base right outside the city and they are always hitting on the prostitutes of Tokyo.  You can tell, and Seijun Sazuki even admits, that he still had some bitterness and some hostility against Americans back then and so trying to work with some American actors, he had to fight with some of his own prejudices.

And here's something else that you don't see very often on film.  No special effects done here.  A cow is brought into the girls domain, struck on the head with an axe, killed, and gutted right there on the floor, in front of the girls, captured on film.  Some people might be sensitive to seeing something like that.

So, to end this review, I will say that this film looks really good.  The girls are beautiful and you can tell that this is a fabulous High-Definition transfer.  Satoko Kasai (Sen) dressed in Red really looks very sharp and appealing to the eye, as all the girls do in their colors.  If RED looks good on film, you know the rest of the film will look beautiful, too.

For as old as this film is, you would think they could always make films look better than they do.  This film looks better than many newer films that come out on DVD today.  Why is that? Do they save the better mastered copy so they can re-sell it again later?  I think that's what's happening.  I've bought many films on DVD, that I've re-purchased when they claim to have a ""new digitally re-mastered"" version.  That's American commercialism for you.  Give as little as you can, sell it, then beef it up, and resell it again.

This plan is molded with the help a gang of organized criminals but the things pitifully will turn another road, when the plan fails.

8060964,3,B0009HLCUQ,"Gate of Flesh is a film that Seijun Suzuki was told to make under his studio contract. In the hands of a normal filmmaker the film would be unforgettable at best, but under the direction of Suzuki, Gate of Flesh becomes a surreal journey in the lives of prostitutes, and post war Japanese citizens. As usual with any Suzuki film, the acting is stilted, the stories are weak, and the dialogue is predictable, but Suzuki always brings such visual flair to his films that they become something more than they really deserve to be. The sets are nice and the colors are bold, and the cinematography brings a rather interesting element to an unintersting script.

8060965,5,B0009HLCUQ,"For the second time since the vanishing of the samurai in the later half of the 1800s, the Japanese society lost its highly militaristic society, but this time to ultimate defeat and chaos.  The Japanese military was on the retreat when the Americans delivered the final punch through their dropping of Little Boy and Fat Man - the atomic bombs.  Tokyo was in a sense more fortunate than Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as they only had to deal with definitive destruction of firebombs dropped on the city.  Nonetheless, in a heap of ashes and debris Tokyo reemerged through a chaotic mess where food, shelter, and clothing were something of a luxury.  Within the bedlam of Tokyo, some people discovered that they had to find a way to survive despite the hardships.  There were also those who found opportunity to make financial gains within the social confusion, as their dubious intentions sought profit of those less fortunate.  Gate of Flesh by Seijun Suzuki provides a dark and dismal perspective of post-war Tokyo through a small number of characters portraying a large part of the Japanese society.

Suzuki opens with a shot of Maya (Yumiko Nogawa), a young homeless woman shocked by the sudden fall of the Japanese Empire, who aimlessly drifts with the constant flow of people.  Her lost presence together with the raspy lyrics of a record symbolically presents the societal confusion of everything that has been lost to the devastating fire.  The wandering eyes of Maya hunt for food, safety, and possibly belonging while dodging the dangers that lurk in the background.  The law has no compassion for humanity, as it seeks the desperate survivors that have no other choice than to pursue illegal alternatives to survive.  On the tiny mud-stomped streets cutting between endless rows of provisional huts, Maya witnesses the law enforcement forcefully apprehending some of the destitute women, but with little resolve, as arrest is to be preferred over starvation.  Life has fallen, and the Japanese lifestyle has struck the very bottom, which Suzuki illustrates with the countless hordes of drifting homeless and starving inhabitants of Tokyo.

Eventually Maya's hunger catches up with her, as her morality can no longer control her fingers reaching for a meager meal.  Inexperience in theft gets her caught, but a man extends his kindness by allowing her to eat her fill.  However, it is a cruelly exploitive world, as she soon learns the true intentions of the man who plans to sell her body to lustful American soldiers.  It is a rough and publicly humiliating initiation for Maya to the lower depths of the society where her redemption comes forward through the crimson red wearing Sen (Satoko Kasai).  The first appearance of Sen provides a false description of her, as she looks like a blossoming flower among weeds.  Her bright crimson dress is a strong contrast to the environment while her arrogance would fit a rich nobleman amidst filthy farmers.  In essence, Sen attempts to put on a strong front, as she is also the self-proclaimed leader for a small gang of prostitutes to which Maya is introduced.

All the women, in Sen's posse of prostitutes, offer an analogous presentation of different emotional reactions of the Japanese society to the aftermath of the war.  Sen, dressed in crimson, allows the mind to think of the fear and impulsiveness that many experienced.  On the other side of the spectrum, the outsider Machiko (Misako Tominaga) steps forward in customary kimono and wooden sandals.  Machiko's attire suggestively represents the disciplined and meditative past before the war, but she also permits the audience to think of the errors of the past.  In between Sen and Machiko, the purple dressed Mino (Kayo Matsuo) represents self-loathing, maybe in regards to defeat, or perhaps of the current state of the nation, while the understanding and compromising Roku (Tamiko Ishii) is clad in yellow.  The newcomer Maya easily adjusts to this devious group of la femme fatale, as she later symbolically emerges in the color green.  Green evokes the notion of a corrupt soul and envy while May's desire for carnal passion intensifies.

These self-made women live under a strict dogma, which offers them protection and a steady income that provides the basic needs and group belonging.  They have broken the chains of the patriarchal society and gotten rid of the middleman - the pimp.  Sen educates Maya in their business while enlightening her in the principal rule, which they all must obey.  It states, ""Never give it to a guy for free. This is a business, and our bodies are our merchandise."", and later the audience will learn about the severe punishment for breaking their governing rule.  Everything seems to run smoothly within the little carnal empire run by the women until the injured Ibuki (Jo Shishido) stumbles into their lives.  Ibuki possesses a similar power over the women that the devil possesses over witches, as he commands the feminine creatures in their homely ruins.  His presence stirs up the atmosphere with grave sexual tension, as most of the time Obuki seems to wander the screen clad in sweat and briefs while the desiring women observe his every move.

Historically, a tendency of territorial behavior has emerged through human existence, as it also provides an opportunity to secure the basic needs.  This craving to extend the borders of the territory often leads to war, as Japan tried to expand its control of Asia.  The expansionism often finds its foundation within greed, as gains trigger a desire for additional gains while also being able to control these gains.  Suzuki brings this notion into Gate of Flesh where the women and Ibuki struggle for control while trying to extend their own influence over one another with dogmatic rules and sexual manipulation.  Ibuki's presence creates a symbolic notion of the American presence in post-war Japan, as he exercises his domination over the women who metaphorically symbolize Japan.  Thus, in this micro society Suzuki delivers a cerebral perspective of the carnal sins that govern these women's existence, which extends far beyond the realm of what is tangible.

Through the existence of Ibuki and the women, the cyclical concept of destruction and rebirth surfaces, as they are reaching the lowest point in their lives where the only logical direction for advancement is up.  Applying this concept in a retrospective perspective to the release year of Gate of Flesh, the viewer will recognize that it coincides with the year of the Olympic Games in Tokyo in 1964.  It offered the world a new glance of a once beaten, but now remerging nation, which learned from its consequences of defeat and ultimate destruction.  Now some 50 years after the dropping of Little Boy and Fat Man, the Japanese society has risen out of its ashes to become an economical power nation.  Nonetheless, Suzuki touches humanity as it reaches its nadir where compassion vanishes into an oblivious vortex of greed and selfishness in a time of anarchy.  This artistically cerebral tale will undoubtedly generate contemplation, even though it takes the form of an exploitative B-film that seems to nourish from its heavy use of nudity.",1127865600,9,7219,5.0344827586206895
