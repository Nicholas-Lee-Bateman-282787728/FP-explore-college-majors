1283694,5,B00003CXS7,"Well, this is not the kind of ""smart funny"" that makes a billion dollars like ""Meet the Parents"",  this is more like a million and ""Major Payne"". It stars Seann William Scott and Ashton Kucher, two of the brightest stars out there. The film is ify, it is stupid comedy that you can appreciate. The funniest scene did not even involve the stars, but with the dummy in the police station. I laughed the hardest at that scene. While other people may give this a 3, I would give this a 5 because, even with its stupid and bad points, this gives a good effort that can make you appreciate it. The subplots are pretty funny, I loved the cult, they made the most likely best characters, Next to the Dummy of course.
If you like stupid comedy, and half an hour to ""expand"" your mind, I would suggest this.
Have a g(o)(o)d one!

1283695,2,B00003CXS7,"I went into this movie that it was going to be stupid. But I didn't even find it funny. Sure there are some scenes that make you laugh, but its cause they are so pathetic. The acting was terrible all around, and the story made no sense what so ever. This is just a bad movie with a cool title.",979084800,3,293,3.9
1283696,3,B00003CXS7,"Okay, overall, i liked the movie, but just by a smidgen of a point as u can tell, the characters were really funny and the former ""stifler"" and current ""kelso"" were good picks for these parts. Seann William Scott makes really good movies for the teenage folk such as yours truly, and Ashton Kutcher i believe will do just as good. They played their chars very well, but the plot was very strange, they threw in a bunch of different random ideas, and imo, the writer was wasted himself as he wrote it.  You never see it coming, but there is sci-fi added to the movie which really ruins it. If they stuck to the going around the neighborhood talking to people idea, it would have been better, but my eyes were rolling when the cult came in asking for the transsomething :P(stupid word, can't remember it).  So what i am going for is that if u don't look at the screwy plot in this movie, you'll still like the chars, as long as you're not easily insulted",977529600,2,952,4.342696629213483

It's wacky and pretty stupid humor but still there is no way to hold back my laughter. I LOVE Ashton Kutcher not only is he adorable but he is a great actor and stars is awesome movies.  I also love Seann William Scott they both bring their off the wall zany personalities to this movie.  Combine that along with lots of outlandish other characters and you have a hit in my book. This plot brings parting too hard to a whole new level.  Even now I find myself saying ""And THEN"" or ""dude"", ""sweet""  this movie has forever burned those sayings into my brain.

1284149,2,B00003CXS7,"If you're looking for a movie that is chocked full of stupidity from start to finish to kill off your brain cells, you can most definitely find that in, ""Dude, Where's My Car?""  After two low-lives (Jesse, played by Ashton Kutcher, and Chester, played by Sean William Scott) throw a massive house party at their girlfriends' (""The Twins"") house, they realize that they can't find their car.  However, to make matters worse, they were so drunk the night before, they have absolutely no idea where it would be.  From there, they basically spend the entire film looking for their car and along the way, learning more about what REALLY happened the night before.  As you can probably predict, most of the movie is just pure nonsense all the way through.  For instance, their only clues to finding their car is a matchbook from a strip club and a lifetime supply of pudding.  Sounds pretty stupid, right?  I have to admit though, some parts I did laugh at (like when the guys try to clean up ""The Twins'"" house and somehow manage to make a bigger mess than what was already there from their massive house party).  Therefore, if you're in the mood for a not-so-serious movie to sit down and chuckle at, or even, to put on as a background filler, ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" is the one for you.  However, if you're not a fan of film's lacking premise or idiotic and stereotypical teenage boys, I would suggest you stay far, far away from this movie.",1449360000,,1438,4.56420233463035

1284468,5,B00003CXS7,"It's really a set of separate comic pieces woven around the theme of two clueless guys trying to find their car. Some of the humour is mindless, but most of the comedy is fresh with some truly bizarrely creative scenes - for example the justly famous Chinese take-out scene, and the spoof on Jurassic Park with ostriches playing the part of raptors - there are many others. Although there are a lot of bad reviews, I think its great that a film like this made it to the cinema, it redeems Hollywood for inflicting ""Titanic"" on us. If you're really tired and worn out by the day's work , I recommend this film to rejuvenate you. The two main lead stars do an excellent job, the whole film could have been a disaster had the delivery of the lines not been right.

Many of the plot elements, though, are not interesting or clever at all. The whole thing about alien technology is silly, since it was probably only brought in so that they could make more jokes about Uranus. Oh well... Happily, the movie is only 82 minutes long and it kinda sorta feels a bit tight.

The bonus features are pretty skimpy: a 4:20 featurette that offers a bit of goofy backstage fun that wasn't in the movie, and there are seven ""extended scenes"" that don't offer anything that wasn't already in the film.

It's funny; no ifs, ands or buts.

The films plot if outrageous.  Two stoner slacker kids named Jesse and Chester (I've always liked that name for some reason) wake up totally oblivious to the events of the night before.  When they walk outside to find Jesse's car missing they set off on an adventure to find it, which leads them to aliens and ostriches (err, lamas) and gigantic chicks in bikinis.

I can't believe I'm giving this film a B-!

With one ridiculous scenario after another, `Dude, Where's My Car?' kind of solidifies itself as one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen, but it's no where near the worst because, in all of its preposterousness, it knows what it's trying to do and it does it well.  I'm not really a fan of Ashton Kutcher or Seann William Scott (Scott was hilarious in `Role Models', but I find his `American Pie' stint hugely overrated) but they sell the `dumb good looking' character very well here.  The endless run on some of the gags can get a tad annoying (that whole tattoo scene may be the most quotable, but it is also the most obnoxious) but then again, at times the repetition is what makes it so funny (the Chinese drive thru scene gets me every time).

If you want smart and funny, get far away from this film...but if you want just plain funny, pop this in an enjoy.

You need not think thoroughly as you watch, because the plot is simply laid out for you. The one-liners are redundant, and like everything else in this film, and hilarious when you account for the fact that Jesse and Chester are just happy stoners. This movie was in theaters when I was in high school. And it captures how small these self-absorbed stoners are in the perspective of the whole world, er, universe. Coooooool!!

Dude, there's no responsibility placed upon the viewer in order to figure out any complex plot. Just remember how some of your stoner peers acted in high school, and you'll understand this movie! Sweeeeeet!

The soundtrack wraps itself around silly nonsense such as Jesse and Chester's dialogue, Chester's facial contortions, and The Twins acting like they still have faith in the guys! Whoooooaaa!

Two stoners need to get their car back that contains gifts for their girlfriends embark on a journey to find it by retracing their steps from last night. Only problem is; they are stupid, they were wasted last night, and have constant people nagging their backs. They go through a lot to get their girlfriends back. The girlfriends are mad at them from trashing the place up and are convinced the two stoners don't even remember that today is their anniversery. While searching for their car, They find out that a transexual stripper gave them 200,000 dollars that was stolen for them to hold on to, and she wants it back and they have no clue where it is. They are chased down by super geeks who want to know where a device that controls the fate of the universe is and they once again...have no clue where it is and this time, how to even say it. It's a fun movie and often has you laughing. If you liked any of those Bill and Ted movies or just like stoner movies than this good for you. I'm sure you will like it. I sure did.",1153008000,,1264,4.360169491525424

1285141,4,B00003CXS7,"Dude, what was I thinking?  I totally went against my own personal policy to avoid Ashton Kutcher in all forms.  That's bad - but it gets worse.  I thought this movie was funny.  I actually enjoyed watched this ode to stupidity.  Make no mistake about it - Dude, Where's My Car? is as stupid a movie as you could ever dream of.  If it's stupid, and someone (probably a stoner) has thought of it, it's in this movie.

Here's the rundown.  Jesse (Ashton Kutcher) and Chester (Seann William Scott), two total losers, wake up one morning without any memories of what they did the night before.  Obviously, they were wasted - but what else is new?  As the day progresses, they discover more and more clues about their wild doings the night before: they partied at their girlfriends' (Marla Sokoloff and a pre-Alias Jennifer Garner) now-thoroughly-trashed house, Jesse got to at least second base with Christie Boner (Kristy Swanson), they spent some quality time down at the Kit Kat Club, and they lost their car.  Oh yeah, they also got their hands on some type of powerful alien device, walked off with a suitcase full of money belonging to a gender-challenged stripper, and threw that money around like it was the night before the apocalypse.  Now their girlfriends are mad at them, a group of cultist freaks and two sets of aliens are after the alien device, the mixed-up stripper wants her, uh his, money back, and the local tough guys are revving up for an old-fashioned stoner-bashing.  All the boys really want is to find their dadgummed car, get the anniversary gifts they assume they bought over to their girlfriends so they can enjoy a special treat, and possibly enjoy the pleasure a group of ugly hot chick aliens promise them in return for the alien device.

Some of the things you'll find in this movie are cultists dressed in bubble wrap spacesuits, two weird Swedish aliens, alien chicks who dress like Robert Palmer dancers, ostriches on the attack, a pot-smoking dog, and of course a fifty-foot tall alien.  It really is the most ridiculous script I've ever seen.  Dude, Where's My Car? makes the Bill and Ted movies look like installments of Masterpiece Theatre.  I really, really wish I could tell you how much I hated the whole movie-watching experience - but, alas, I cannot.  It does hurt me to say this, but Dude, Where's My Car? is a funny movie that I, as much as I hate to admit it, actually found quite entertaining.",1141776000,32,2440,4.674473067915691

Not only is it devoid of any funny material (who gives these people jobs?) but it also rips off superior films such as Bill and Ted, Wayne's World. Dumb and Dumber is stupid and goofy, but at least it is funny.

1285143,2,B00003CXS7,"I have no idea why I watched this film recently or wanted to. Maybe its because I was interested in seeing Seann William Scott play another Stifler-type character, or a curiosity factor about Ashton Kutcher, who I still can't believe snagged the babe of Hollywood babes, Demi Moore. Man, if a stoner goofball like him could snag someone of Demi Moore stature, there should be hope for all guys out there! But really, the biggest reason I wanted to see this film was the scene I heard a few people talk about...the scene I found the funniest in the entire film and the reason why I give it two stars instead of the (n)one it deserves: the ostrich farm scene. I got a kick out of Ashton calling the ostriches ""llamas"" all the time...as my sister loves ostriches, llamas, and emus. The scene is a riot. Too bad there wasn't more of that in there.

This film tries to be too many things, yet it was completely missold and very deceptive in its advertising. It tries to be ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure"" crossed with ""Dumb and Dumber"", but really, its just plain dumb. I found it hard to believe that those two stoners would ever get girlfriends along the likes of Alias-star Jennifer Garner. Yeah, right! As the two dumb pot-heads try to figure out what happened the previous night, they come across strippers, pre-op trannies, aliens, and cult members...and the movie moves along at a bizarre pace until it just becomes so outlandishly overthetop that you know the makers of this film are laughing all the way to the bank for all the saps who paid good money to watch this. I mean, come on...space aliens straight out of SNL's ""Sprockets"" skit; a 50-foot tall Playboy model running amok, and a stupid continuum transfunctioner? How dumb do they think audiences are?

It's basically a good stoner movie and if you liked 'Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure' or 'Road Trip', you should get several repeated enjoyable viewings out of this DVD. Starts out with two stoners Chester (Seann William Scott) and Jesse (That '70's Show's Ashton Kutcher) who awake from a long night of heavy partying that either one can seem to remember. Their girl friends throw them out and that's where the fun begins. The two pot heads have run-ins with several 'alien' visitors that want to get their hands on this 'continuum...' (something or another) gadget that will apparently destroy the entire universe UNLESS it's located by a certain time. I know, the plot isn't the best, but it's the numerous comedy moments in this flick that drew me in.

Kutcher and Seann William Scott are perfect for the roles of the stupid dudes, shibby me timbers!  Between them, they must have the iq of a slug, but that's what this movie needs.  And it's got lots more:  hot chicks from space; a macho challenge from cameo star Fabio; a collection of space nerds led by a fellow who tells everyone to make sure they're quiet when they leave cause his mother is taking a nap; a transexual stripper who speaks with a deep voice but looks pretty sexy; a herd of wild ostriches; Jennifer Garner absolutely horrible as one of the twin girlfriends (hard to believe this is the same talented actress from 13 GOING ON 30 and ALIAS).

There are scenes which are totally unforgettable - Chinese Foood scene, and the llama scene spring to mind immediately, but there could be a list of them! Though the plot is a thinly veiled excuse for hijinks, it actually makes it more funny just because they know the plot is almost non existant.

Most mainstream films don't do that these days, you see  the trailer and you know a certain person is going to be in it so you expect to laugh and most people follow along just to feel like they didn't waste their time.

1285346,1,B00003CXS7,"Riding high on the tide of American Pie's success came a truckload of stoner, gross-out comedies that never manages to be halfway as good as the sort of movies they were trying to imitate.  Dude, Where's My Car? is one such example.  Starring Ashton Kucher and Sean William Scott as two losers who set out to find their car after a heavy night of drinking the night before.  The big problem is though, not that they've lost their car, but their anniversary presents for their girlfriends were in the car too.
Of course, sitting down to watch a film like this you don't really expect anything other than entertainment.  Unfortunately, this is anything but.  Each dead gag is laid as quickly on top of the last one as possible to try and avoid the fact that there's really nothing here at all.  Sexy alien women, an absurb cult, an angry transexual and a pot-smoking dog are just some of the bizarre plot elements that are thrown at the stars, but you just couldn't care less.  It's a shame really, because this kind of movie can be a lot of fun, but unfortunately this just reeks of a half-baked effort.  It's even more shameful that the film-makers have managed to enlist two obviously talented comedy actors in Kucher and Scott.  Though Kucher may now be simply known as Demi Moore's new beau, and as soon as you see Scott you think of Stifler, their vacant expressions and key-on delivery would've worked perfectly for a better film.
Finally, you can't help comparing Dude, Where's My Car? to other's of its ilk.  It lacks the inherent charm of American Pie (and it's nowhere near as funny), the off-kilter comedy of Detroit Rock City and is certainly nowhere near as good as the Farrelly's There's Something About Mary.

And the overuse of the word ""dude"" got on my nerves! I suppose it was part of the film. Bill & Ted could get away with it in the 80s, but not now. It's like saying ""wassup"", no one says that anymore, but people were saying it for ages.
Seann William Scott seems to get typecast in this role now, no thanks to the American Pie trilogy. I didn't like him so much in this movie; he is quite often funny, but not here. And Ashton Kutcher - what exactly does Demi Moore see in him? He looks goofy, and even with a decent hair cut, I wouldn't look twice at him. As Brittany Murphy put it - to him, the age difference doesn't matter, and to her, size doesn't matter! Well put! Ashton Kutcher, or Eminem? Hard choice . . .
At the end the Super Hot Female Alien was totally weird, and used some very clever camera trickery! She reminded me of the one of the girls who used to be in Baywatch, but I forget her name.
Apart from the Chinese woman (and then . . . and then . . . and then . . .), the other bit I liked was the outtakes showing behind the credits at the end. More films should do this, as it makes it loads more entertaining to watch the end credits.
I would recommend to this film, but only to guys. The ""hot chicks"" get on my nerves, so the guys will definitely like this film.

1285405,4,B00003CXS7,"""Dude, Where's My Car?"" opens with ""stoners"" Jesse and Chester (played by Ashton Kutcher and Seann William Scott) waking up to find Jesse's car missing (hence the film's title).  But the boys have no memory of the night before, and thus must solve the mystery of the missing vehicle.  Their first clue involves. . . pudding.
""Dude,"" directed by Danny Leiner, is a whimsical blend of mystery, comedy, and science fiction.  It's full of absurd characters and ridiculous situations, and is shot with real visual flair.  The comedy is very much enhanced by the easygoing likeability of and solid ""buddy"" chemistry between Kutcher and Scott.  They are well backed by a good supporting cast; along the way are some quirky and very enjoyable cameo spots.
The DVD offers a feature length commentary by director Leiner and costars Kutcher and Scott.  Their three-way verbal interplay is hilarious and very informative; if you already enjoy this film I highly recommend watching it with this commentary.",1057104000,4,993,5.061349693251533

USA (1999): Comedy
75 min, Color
The comedy movie ""Dude, Where's my car"" is one of the most stupid films we have ever seen. But that does not mean that we would rate it turkey-like. It is furthermore a good movie because it is on purpose so terrible that it makes the movie absolutely funny.
At the beginning the main characters Jesse and Chester get up and do not know what happened the night before because they have been totally drunk and stoned. They want to go to their girlfriends where they had a party, but when they get out of the door they discover that Jesse's car is missing. So they try to get it back. While searching, they meet many strange people and get to know many things they did the night before. There are for example five big breasted women called ""The Hot Chicks"" who promise to give them an erotic pleasure if they get them the ""Continuum Transfunctioner"". The two boys go to several other places where the story is getting more and more strange. In the end there is a huge showdown where they find out what the ""Continuum Transfunctioner"" is. It is a great ending where you can see for the first time which function every character actually has.
The actors in the movie are also very convincing. The two main actors play their role very well although it is not quite easy to act with such a stupid behaviour like they do.
All in all, we come to the decision that we would rate the movie with four out of five stars because it is really extraordinary and funny. If you like comedy films, it is very useful to watch it. We also give the advice to watch it drunk. You will not be able to stop laughing about these stupid scenes.

I wish I could give it less than a 'zero' rating because I cannot find the words to describe my distaste for this movie.

1285462,3,B00003CXS7,"This movie was fairly roundly criticized when it was released, and as usual, the professional 'critics' found almost no redeeming qualities to the many times juvenile humor this movie was based around.
I, personally, am not a fan of these 'pros' as they tend to look for artsy films, and fawn all over things like ""Driving Miss Daisy"" (a slow movie if I ever saw one) or ""Gosford Park"" (almost as slow) while trashing or ignoring entertainment for the masses such as the latest Star Wars, or action adventure type stuff like Indiana Jones.
Having said that, the critics perhaps have a point about this movie, but I think it maybe because they didn't give the movie a little while to set in.
Some of the humor is just slapstick and juvenile, but as you watch it more than once, it starts to become funnier, and easier to laugh at.
I've seen this movie a few times now, since it's shown up on the pay movie channels, and find myself snickering at it more and more, and downright laughing at a few spots.
It is a movie that requires you to suspend disbelief in several places, but it's also humorous and entertaining.
I wouldn't say it's something I'd pay a lot of money to see, but it's not the worst film ever made either.
If you want escapist entertainment, or a guilty pleasure type movie, pick this one up, pop it in the DVD player and enjoy.",1041552000,2,1344,4.445344129554656
1285463,4,B00003CXS7,"Dude Where's My Car is a pretty good ""dumb funny"" movie. It's not as dumb funny as DUMB AND DUMBER or BASEKETBALL but for what it is, it's makes you laugh. It stars American Pie's Sean William Scott as Chester and That 70's Show's Ashton Kutcher as Jesse.
Jesse and Chester are your typical dumb teenage, pizza delivery boys that after a night of serious partying, THEY CAN'T REMEMBER a thing. The next day they come to realize that it's their anniversary with their girlfriends. When they try to go over and make good with their girlfriends, they realize that Jesse's car is missing and inside were the gifts they got their girlfriends. Throughout their mission to find Jesse's car, they come to find out that the night of their partying, the came into contact with 2 aliens that had a device that keeps the universe in harmony and it's lost! It's up to Jesse and Chester t ofind the Continuam Transfunctioner, give it to the gurdians of the Transfunctioner and save the universe (and of course along the way, piece together their aweome night of partying!)
First off, you can't go into this movie with a whole lot of expectations. The story is just really silly and you're not going to get an Oscar performance from this movie. You are however going to get a lot of laughs because that's really what you're getting for this one. And normally most comedies are straight forward but this one has little twists in the story here and there and that keeps some interest in it.
I'd recommend this one because it's funny. Truthfully, it is funny but if you're looking for drop down funny, there are better movies that you could go for. If you feel that you couldn't get into this movie, you can't go wrong with the AMERICAN PIE series, ME MYSELF & IRENE or even any of the Kevin Smith films like MALLRATS or CLERKS (you chose to go with Kevin Smith, watch CLERKS first).

1285464,5,B00003CXS7,"""Dude, Where's My Car?"" is a fascinating study of the human mind, and how we react when one, in fact, loses their car.  The actual scenario of losing your car, whether by theft or carelessness, et al, is a mortifying experience.

While the car is not a child, we sometimes treat it like one.  We clean it when it's dirty, we bring it inside when the elements might harm it.  When it's thirsty, we give it a drink, when it gets tired, we allow it to rest.

As we watch Ashton Kutcher and Seann William Scott deal with their loss, we see them use comedic capers to disguise their anguish.  Their car is missing, but are they really laughing, or are they masking the internal conflict?

The director of ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" has created a source of therapy (perhaps unintentionally) for all that are missing something in their lives.  Kutcher and Scott show us that while it is important to cope with your loss, it is okay to have fun doing it. Essentially, ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" is to Generation-X, what ""Ordinary People"" was to the Baby-Boomers.
With clever writing and wonderful cameos by Jennifer Garner (""Alias"") and Kristy Swanson (the original ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer""), this movie is a must-see for all of you experiencing a loss.",1037923200,4,1241,4.634703196347032

It was funny, but it seemed like alot of what I saw was either revisited and rehashed humor, so I left the theater mostly dissatisfied, confused, but all in all 'eh, i didn't expect much, and i laughed a couple of times' sortof mood.
However, there's something about the film that the more times I watch, the more I find myself laughing at it, the jokes so ridiculously stupid and forgettable, that I've exactly done that, forgotten them, and a peculiar sense of laughing at something entirely new, yet revisiting an old friend, deja-vu experience happens.
Its quite forgettable, yet therein lies its charm, for how many great films can you watch over and over again, yet w/ each viewing, learning the lines by heart you lose the initial impact after each succesive watching.
Shimmy becomes an old forgotten friend, that we vaguely remember, but its still nice to visit again.  Nostalgia and stupidity all wrapped together in one.
I think the actors also pull it off, the remarkably [slow] dialoge was written exactly that, [slow], but done so in a innocent and naive manner.
The characters/heros are anti-heros w/out the bitterness or moral uncertainty that most stories of our day and age present.  No, you get no cynicism or failing of our human nature, no brooding negativety, or triumphing over the darkness.
You have two naive innocents, who jovially bumble thier way through the movie, and its this light-hearted tone of the writing that also welcome repeated viewings.  Like old friends, whom you visit, knowing though the conversation will be insipid, will most likely inspire laughter, and someone being dunked into the pool.
stupidity? yes.  bad writing?  I don't think so.  If you give the film a chance, and watch it for exactly what it is, it may make you laugh and smile as much as it sets out to.  and you may find yourself, like me, revisiting it from time to time, and discovering its hidden charm, and unappreciated brillaince.",1023235200,9,2039,4.805714285714286
1285531,5,B00003CXS7,"With minimalist setup, deft wordplay, and characterization that is brilliant in its reserved subtlety, this film is hauntingly reminiscient of the greatest works of existential literature of the past hundred years. Jesse and Chester demonstrate their astounding mastery of the craft as they assume (nay, become), what can only be described as the Vladimir and Estragon of the stoner-flick genre, simultaneously lost in their own struggles with self while bravely overcoming the conflicts thrust upon them by an uncaring world. In an overt homage to Franz Kafka's seminal novel, ""The Metamorphosis,"" the two awake to find that they have been cheated of the ego, and, much like Gregor and Samson, are left without transportation in our modern dystopia where a car is so direly neccessary to the realization of the Freudian being. The quest that follows can be compared to ""Waiting for Godot"", only without the waiting, as the frantic and sometimes near incomprehesible pace of the film is set in play to satirize our own neomodern, hyperindustrial lives where one cannot pause, even for a moment, to enjoy the scenery, or, in this case, the ""Shibby."" It's understandable that the screenwriter had to invent the term for this masterpiece of cinema: his grasp of language makes him a modern-day Shakespeare, and he seems almost chained to the inadequacies of English prose as he struggles to connect with his audience (For anyone with an advanced degree in French Literature, you'll find the alternative language track to be quite illuminating). The acting in this film is deliberately downplayed, and it is clear that the director sought to mimic the tone (though not the qualms) of the German Minimalist theatre. Further, the extraterrestrials (or so we are to believe!) are overtly malicious in a striking parallel to Dostoyevsky's narrator in ""Notes,"" although the Lynchesque makeup design seems, unfortunately, a distractingly obtuse addition to the otherwise restrained and dignified scenes. Alas, like Ayn Rand's ""The Fountainhead"", this brief film serves only to awaken the viewer to the concepts to be expounded upon in the epic, four-hour sequel ""Seriously Dude, Where's My Car"", an opus that surely cannot be missed by anyone espousing to be of the literati.",1022544000,5,2265,5.225274725274725

There's nothing even remotely smug about ""Dude, Where's My Car?""--no one would be fooled.  However, it is clever in its own unique way.  Notice how everything ties together so cleanly in the end.

But once that half-hour was up, the plot took a real turn for the worst. They made up some stupid alien plot and tried to pass it off as humor. The first half-hour was A-list stupid humor, but the remainder was all bad B-movie humor.
The drive-thru Chinese restaurant scene was amusing and the transexual thug was frighteningly entertaining, even the tattoo scene and the Adidas suits were funny, but overall it got stale quick. I can remember sitting in a silent theater for about the last 30 to 40 minutes. Nobody wanted to laugh because it would have made them look bad. At least in ""Dumb and Dumber"", they had their own theories about stuff that was happening. In this movie, these guys play complete morons with two brain cells between them. They never have any worthwhile conversation, just plenty of gratituous scenes of half-naked hotties (which normally I would enjoy). It's sad because I enjoy these two guys in their other acting roles (American Pie and That 70's Show), but not in the least bit here. After 30 minutes, the jokes became so predictable and so contrived that it was painful. I actually heard people moan in discomfort as the flick progressed. Nobody got up and left because they figured it had to get better, which it didn't, and besides, after you pay [money] to see a movie, you're not walking out until the credits roll. The jokes aren't really overdone in this movie, just not funny after a while. Most of the second half needed to be put on life support and it just continued to drag painfully. You can only carry a movie based upon the characters' stupidity for so long, unless you're Jeff Bridges and Jim Carrey. The ending was so mindnumbingly (I know its now a word but that's how I feel) dumb, it was insulting. This movie reminded me of a plane crash, takeoff was smooth but the rest of the flight was turbulent and ended tragically.
If you like juvenile, unoriginal, shameless, and downright insulting humor, then this is your movie. If you like something with originality and some thought invested, you're going to be sadly disappointed. And if you don't like this one, you'll hate ""Not Another Teen Movie"", which I strongly suggest you avoid like the Bubonic Plague.",1015200000,,3053,4.532608695652174
1285589,4,B00003CXS7,"This is a fun movie running a very slick 80 mineuts which I encourage any 12-20 year old boy (maybe girl) to watch and enjoy. The plot is that two pot head buddies, Jesse and Chester, wake up after a night of parting. Since they have absolutly no memory what so ever, they asum that they had a very good time. But soon they play back a angry message on their answering machine from their girlfriend, the twins, Wanda & Wilma, which makes them asum that they had a VERY good time. Jesse and Chester realise that to set things right they must get the anniversery gifts for the twins out of Jesses car, but but the car is gone. Now the two fiends are on a quest to find the car and get the twins back. But the quest grows and grows, they find themselves having to save the twins and their friend with a pot smoking dog, find thousends of stolen money for a gender confussed stripper, and save the universe from destrouction from a universal device that in the right hands will keep the universe safe, and in the wrong hands will destroy it! Oh yeah there are also lots of little missadventures along the way too.
This movie is really funny and you should see it, yes you, right now!",1014681600,,1179,4.267857142857143
1285590,1,B00003CXS7,"Okay, I promised myself that I wouldn't expend too much energy in writing this review after having seen this film (for free, thankfully) on Showtime, but I probably will anyway, so here goes: DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR? is one of the least funny so-called 'comedies' that I have seen in the past few years.  It's not just that it's a stupid movie (after all, what else would one expect from a film titled DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR?), it's that it's just not funny. A famous reviewer once said that although there are bad horror films and bad dramas, there is no kind of film that is worse than a bad comedy.  I have to agree with this philosophy--and DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR? is a very painful example of it.
Since humor is basically a subjective concept in the first place, let me illustrate my reaction to this movie with a comparison: I laughed throughout every single scene of BLAZING SADDLES, MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL, AIRPLANE!, THE NAKED GUN: FROM THE FILES OF POLICE SQUAD!, and SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER & UNCUT. I laughed most of the time during AMERICAN PIE and SCARY MOVIE. I laughed occasionally while watching SLUMS OF BEVERLY HILLS and ACE VENTURA: PET DETECTIVE. I chuckled sporadically at THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY and DUMB AND DUMBER. I think I kind of snickered once or twice during one scene of DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR? You get the idea.
Anybody wanting to see this movie because of how funny Ashton Kutcher is as the terminally clueless stoner Michael Kelso in the very-funny TV hit ""That '70's Show"", please stop yourself right now.  Although Kutcher does play a fairly similar character in this movie, if you expect the dialogue to be as smart and funny as on his TV show, you're going to be very disappointed.  This is a flick that assumes that people will find words like ""shibby"", ""dude"" and ""sweet"" funny--especially when repeated over and over and *over* again.  Well I didn't, you sweet shibby dude. Oh, and I'm sorry but, no matter how many times the phrase ""continuum transfunctioner"" is spoken--at least 50 times in this movie, believe it or not--it just doesn't get funny, either. Oh well...DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR? is probably not the unfunniest comedy I've ever seen (that distinction would go out equally to the mega-bombs HEART CONDITION and THE CABLE GUY), but it's pretty well up there in the Top Ten!
P.S.: the word ""shibby"" never caught on as the new 'cool word' the way the director and screenwriter had obviously thought that it would. Thank God for small favors--eh, dude? :)",1014336000,8,2510,4.682539682539683
1285591,5,B00003CXS7,"At first glance ""Dude Where's My Car"" will probably hit you as one of those ""dumb but funny"" movies.  In truth, of course it is, but the story that develops is actually pretty decent and a lot better than you would think initially.
THE STORY:
Chester (Sean William Scott, ""American Pie"" series, ""Road Trip"") and Jessie (Ashton Keaton) are two stoner buds who wake up from a night of partying with NO MEMORY of what they did over night.  As the movie progresses it is slowly revealed that they had quite the night becoming mixed up with a transvestite striper, purchasing all types of stuff and even becoming caught up in the middle of an intergalactic battle between good and evil!!!  In the midst of it all, they must also battle to save their relationships with their twin girlfriends and, of course, find Jessie's missing car.
Best Scenes:
- the blind boy meeting the alien chick
- the Ostrich farm
- Chinese take-out
- ZOLTAN!!!!
THE DVD FEATURES:
The DVD is actually chalked full of some great extras, including:
- Feature Length Commentary with the director, Sean William Scott and Ashton Kutcher:  This commentary's about average/above average from most feature length commentary.  Very entertaining to listen to as all three are pretty funny.
- 5 Minute Featurette with Sean William Scott, Ashton Kutcher and Kristy Swanson (Christie Boner):  Not bad for 5 minutes.  They show some of the ""behind-the-scenes"" stuff and talk about the movie's plot.  It basically looks like some quick commercial they aired on E! or something.
- Movie Trailer and TV Commercial Spots:  The usual.  Nice extra.
- 7 Extended Scenes:  Going a little beyond the ""deleted scene"" extras they actually show the full scenes as it was originally filmed with the deleted footage still in.  Overall, some of the deleted footage was pretty cool and would have actually added some to the story, but ultimately did not make a huge difference being left out anyway.
In all, the DVD extras are a great and worthy bonus.
THE VERDICT:
If you're looking for a ""dumb but funny, yet slightly intelligent"" comedy, this is the ticket for you.  Chalk full of laughs, some mindless fun and a pretty decent storyline this movie should be a pleaser to just about anyone.  The DVD extras are a pleasant added bonus as well making this a great rental, OR, if you liked the movie enough and are so inclined, a decent addition to your DVD collection....",1014163200,6,2412,4.780722891566265
1285592,3,B00003CXS7,"'Dude, Where's My Car?' pulls off the difficult trick of at once indulging the (let's be kind) 'limited' worldview of its stoner protagonists and mercilessly ribbing it.  The film is the perfect expression of a particular stunted adolescent mindset, revolving entirely around parties, TV, soft drugs, caricatures of girls, cars, nerd-baiting and jock-evading, fast food and aliens, going round and round in circles.  The heroes, as vacuous as Bill and Ted, and as crass as Beavis and Butthead, have a naive charm, exuberance and sheer good-natured good-humour that carries the film long after the material has run out (about a third of the way through).  The leads have an infectious and believable bond, and I woulld travel anywhere to see the marvel that is Seann William Scott's big grin, part-lascivious, part-wide-eyed-wonder, how-the-hell-did-I-get-here-and-who-cares?
I won't say it's necessarily bad faith on the part of the film-makers, but there is certainly a relentless undermining of the characters' worldview.  The film is less about male camaraderie than male identity, and takes the form of a journey that promises a moral progress, in which boys become men.  All the way through, the film plays with various sexual situations 'testing' the boys, from homosexuality to castration anxiety to deferred heterosexuality.  Famous quest narratives are ironically invoked, from 'Jason and the Argonauts' to 'The Life Of Brian', with the car perhaps as an emblem of the mature masculinity or sexuality that is the boys' birthright but which has to be sought.  The lack of 'realism' (where do they go to school? etc.), the profusion of fairy tale, magical, hallucinatory and dream motifs, all suggest this.  The venerable plot starting point - amnesiacs moving in the present, trying to recover their past - is the clasic narrative of identity, one which has served the likes of 'Vertigo' and 'Mulholland Drive' well.  Feels a lot longer than 79 minutes, though!",1012780800,,1969,5.285256410256411

Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure is one that springs to mind. It wasn't Citizen Kane, but it put a smile on your face, and maybe even made you laugh. Dude, Where's My Car? on the other hand lacks any amount of charm or humour. Not once did I laugh or find any of the protagonist's antics amusing. Their stupidity wasn't charming, it was absolutely mind-numbing. Besides, in what kind of a movie do the two main characters claim to be ""stoners"", but neither of them actually smoke any? The answer is a bad one. In fact, it was absolute torture to sit through this movie. After about five minutes I wished it was over.

The director is mindless, I actually listened to the commentary with the director and actors on the DVD.  It's so stupid that I cannot dislike it.  If you're depressed like myself, or in poor health, or any other similar situation, the movie won't necessarily uplift you, but you wouldn't mind it in the least...because you don't have to take it seriously whatsoever.

The plot is childish and jokes are on the simple side (in the first scene, there is a guy urinating into a flower pot; it does not go downhill from there but fails to venture up either).
Why am I giving it four stars? Because it is still enjoyable and very viewable.

You'll either love it, or hate it.  There's no middle ground.
The bottom line is that if a movie called, ""Dude, Where's My Car?""
sounds moronic, sophomoric, and pathetic to you, then
that's what you'll think of the movie as well.  You don't need to
read reviews.  Follow your gut instinct.  Sophisticates
should check out Kenneth Branaugh's ""Hamlet""
instead. (It's the best Hamlet ever made.)

fools, while making them beloved (in the tradition of
""Romy & Michelle's High School Reunion,""

is precisely what makes it so funny. It was much funnier
than I expected.  All the characters are two dimensional,
and the plot is not a plot, so much as the confused
meanderings and bizarre adventures of two stoners....  It was just the mindless,
silly, hilarious fluff we needed to smile, laugh, and
get our endorphins back on track. If you like this,
""Evening at the Roxbury"" is also pretty funny.

I like humor that isn't incredibly obvious, the type of humor that's between the lines and you have to pick up by thinking for a second.  I found this movie to be a pathetic attempt at trying to look like a 'Bill And Ted Excellent Adventure' type of movie containing stupid humor like Scary Movie.  Except that the humor in this isn't really funny, it's immature like Nickelodeon 'All That / Kenan & Kel' style...
But what saves this movie from being an embarrassment was how the other characters reacted with each other: the nerds, the jocks, the hot chicks, the German accent aliens.  And the plot was OK starting off, but eventually got worse as the movie went on...  It's funny that in a journey to just find the guy's car they get involved with an alien conflict to destroy or save the universe...
This movie has more plot holes than swiss cheese being assaulted by a machine gun.  The 2 main characters act like Kenan & Kel and over half the time they're not funny in the slightest bit.  And I think this movie would be an embarrassment for any actor/actress to have on their resume...

1285850,1,B00003CXS7,"""Dude, Where's My Car?"" is quite literally, the third worst film ever made, ever to be released by a major studio. ""Showgirls"" and ""Battlefield:Earth"", both have those distinctions of being in the first two spots. Both films being released by MGM and Warner Bros. respectively, and Fox releasing this. ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" is just another studio's desperate bid to cash in on the grossout-teen comedy genre. Apparently these people have never heard of the word: overkill. Considering they're the ones behind such a lethal term. The film follows the adventures of two inept stoners named Chester and Jesse, Resident Dumbasses who end up losing their car, and must go in search of it. Along their journey, they encounter a nerdy alien cult, a group of sexy alien females, a braun but brainless jock, and Andy Dick among their many other adventures. Now , you expect a film like this to go along the tradition of ""Road Trip"" and ""American Pie"", a good natured teen raunch flick meant to make you laugh. But the antics of this film are seriously desperate, and seriously stupid. Stupid is a word to be debated with teen raunch flicks, but the unbelievable plot twists this film takes, just show you how much 20th Century Fox could give about a script. The film is just unbelievably bad, not even laughably bad. It goes into points of downright bad filmmaking. If you want to see a film like American Pie, just rent Road Trip, another Seann William Scott flick. Dude, Where's My Car? is just another travesty of bad filmmaking, that shows how Hollywood loves to produce in search of making the almighty buck. Such a travesty would have someone like John Belushi spinning in his grave.

So they run all over town looking for the car and finding out about all the weird and amazing things they did the night before.
My Opinion: I was going to give this movie one star, but it's got Marla Sokoloff in it and she's worth a star all by herself. This movie is supposed to be stupid they are all saying, but is it supposed to be so bad? I really didn't laugh. I didn't find the drug use funny. I don't think that age has anything to do with whether or not you find this funny. I think intelligence does. Maybe being high would help, but I wouldn't know. It's  a lot like an episode of a really bad WB network sitcom except it goes on for almost 90 minutes. Don't get me wrong, I really like funny/stupid movies and that's why I rented this one. DWMC just doesn't have any redeeming qualities. The drug use and sex content make it unsuitable for kids under 13, but the intelligence level is exactly suited for them.
DVD Quality:  Widescreen anamorphic 1.85:1 DD 5.1. Extras include trailers, music video, extended scenes, and making of featurette. Very good picture and sound quality.

1285987,3,B00003CXS7,"Hmm... okay... where to begin...
This is the kind of self-babble I'm left with in trying to think of things to write about in this, my review of ""Dude, Where's My Car?,"" a movie so ridiculously conceived and scripted, so reundant in it gags and one-liners, so absolutely mind-melting that to watch it is to realize a new level of stupidity. But that doesn't mean it's not fun.
There's the most basic of plots: Jesse and Chester, two stoners whose vocabulary consists of relentless utterings of ""dude"" and ""sweet,"" wake up one morning to realize that Jesse's car is missing, and they have no recollection of the previous night. As they set out to find the car, they begin to piece together the silly, unbelievably outrageous events of the previous night, from a tryst in a strip club with a transsexual stripper who gave them a suitcase full of cash, to encounters with different groups of nerdy, busty, and macho aliens, all demanding from them a device known as the continuum transfunctioner.
And that's it, the entire plot of the movie, mixed in with some truly hearty laughs and some good yet goofy acting from two guys who know what they're doing. The movie works for the simple reason that Ashton Kutcher (Jesse) and Seann William Scott (Chester) do such a good job of acting completely stupid that they sell us on the whole stoner appearance of the movie. A film like this can't work without the mentality to back it up, and the absence of that mentality is just what it needs.
There are laughs, and while some of them are forced, there are those that succeeded in getting more than just a chuckle out of me. The two guys' mentality is one gag, but the movie also makes us laugh by playing their girlfriends, known as ""The Twins,"" to be just as air-headed as they are. A chinese fast food drive-thru results in an hilarious explosion of anger, while the whole girls-with-big-hoo-hoos mentality runs throughout.
There's really not a whole lot more to say about this movie... it's stupid, it's ridiculous... it makes its characters out to be heroes in the most contrived situations imaginable, and there's no shortage of brainless dialogue and actions. But, for what it's worth, it's not a total waste of time, and I found myself laughing in all the right places.",993859200,10,2267,4.698492462311558

So if you want to see a movie that is very random with a lot of stupid but funny humor, then see this.  But don't bother if you are looking for a movie with a plot.",993513600,2,467,4.076923076923077
1286013,3,B00003CXS7,"Ok, if you like movies that star two dimwitted guys involving a very crazy story and plot, then ""Dude, Where's My Car"" is the kind of movie for you.  The film goes one step beyond and then some.  Aston Kutcher plays Jesse, a character who's a bit smarter than the character of ""Kelso"" that Aston portrays on ""That 70's Show"".  I'm a ""That 70's Show"" fan, which is one of the reasons why I bought this movie.  Anyway, Jesse & Chester (Seann William Scott) wake up, completely forgetting what they did the night before (""How wasted were we?"") and discovering some very strange things, such as a refrigerator full of Pudding Cups, and of course, the fact that Jesse's car is missing.  The most fun you'll have with this movie is your first time viewing, since you know as much as they do as far as what the heck is going on!  The film has its moments, including Jesse arguing with a Chinese drivethru intercom. (""NO AND THEN!!!!"") The Shibby smoking dog was a touch much for me, but the one scene I cringe at the most is when Jesse & Chester make out with one another just so they can impress....get this...FABIO!  Not the best moment of the movie.  But it is full of zany characters.  The most sexist name in the film has got to be ""Christie Boner"".  She's the one who tells Jesse she saw his car...""from the backseat"".  These guys do have girlfriends, Wendy and Wilma (The Twins), who honestly, they don't deserve.  (""You are such sucky boyfriends"".)  Why don't they deserve them?  Well the night before they trashed the twins house and after the girls cleaned it all up they ruined it again, although unintentioanlly.  I don't want to give too much away in case readers of this review have never seen the movie, as to not ruin it for them.  It is pretty crazy.  Guys will love what one woman does with Aston's popsicle.  The movie reminds me of ""Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure"", only not as funny.  That doesn't mean you won't have a good time though.  And I'm not saying I didn't enjoy it because I did.  Judge for yourself.  It truly is one wild ride.  SWEET!  DUDE!
The DVD Extras are OK.  Some extended scenes show you a little more and I think they were right to take them out.  Probably the best feature is the audio commentary with director Danny Leiner and Aston & Seann, but the featurette is nice too.  ""SHIBBY!""",993081600,8,2324,4.4454976303317535

It is not easy to play in a movie like this one. As you probably have noticed I have ""only"" given this movie 4 stars. My reason for this is, that though the film is UNBELIAVEBLE FUNNY, it is, and I think we all can agree on that, superficiel. If a film shall be given 5 stars, it has to be a film that can make you think and wonder. That is my opinion, but 4 stars for giving me a great experience.

Don't get me wrong--I enjoy a ""stupid"" comedy as much as the next person.  Hell, I enjoyed American Pie enough to pick it up on DVD. But it's really stretching the bounds of the word stupid and comedy to label this as a stupid comedy.  It's just plain bad. Most of the amusing stuff is in the trailer and even there it wasn't that amusing. And there are lots of jokes in this film that if I told you about them, they would sound humorous and like you might get a chuckle out of them.  You'd be completely wrong.  I didn't see Battlefield Earth, so I can't say unconditioanlly this is the worst film of the year 2000. I can say that it's one of the worst films I've seen in a long time.

1286144,5,B00003CXS7,"Granted, this movie is dumb. And at first glace, it makes no sense. But that's the whole beauty of it. No one said this movie was, um... thought provoking?
Jesse (Ashton Kutcher) and Chester (Seann William Scott), are two dudes with quite a vocabilary (sweet, shibby, and dude). Waking up one moring, they realize they don't remember what happened the night before, but it seems as though they got quite wasted! There's a lifetime supply of pudding in their kitchen, they have tatoos, a stripper (and don't ask if it's male or female- hard to tell!) gave them a suitcase full of money, and their girlfriends (""the twins""- Jennifer Garner and Marla Sokoloff) are pissed at them because they ruined their house and forgot their anniverary. No problem, right? After all, Jesse and Chester got them gifts. They'll just go to Jesse's car and get them. But whoops- where's the car, dude?
From then on, Jesse and Chester go on a wild chase after their car, a bunch of space dorks say they have to get the tran--- (""how can we find it if we can't pronoce it?!""), a bunch of ""hot chicks"", running away from lama's (or are they?), a chinese food take-out troubles.... wow, this movie is f-u-n-n-y! Isn't it?
The cast is great- Hal Sparks as Zoltan, Jennifer Garner and Marla Sokoloff as the twins, and Seann William Scott and Ashton Kutcher as Jesse and Chester. The movie also has some great tunes.
See this movie if you really want to laugh. See this movie at a party. See this movie with your friends. See this movie if you have a dumb sense of humor (like me). Just see it!",986860800,27,1567,4.540636042402827
1286145,4,B00003CXS7,"Ok, let's get this straight. Dude, Where's My Car? isn't shooting for the Academy's appreciation. Other than Battlefield Earth, Dude, Where's My Car? was the most scoffed film of 2000. Is it stupid? Yes. Is it intentional? Absolutely.
Seann William Scott brings his bright boy persona along with edgy Ashton Kutcher into the premiss of two very confused individuals who cannot recall where they misplaced their vehicle. After one finally realizes the plot, you too, can comprehend the oft-misunderstood title and how it relates to the plot.
All joking aside, the movie moves at a quick pace and has absolutely the funniest supporting cast. Kutcher and Scott are terrific, but the random encounters with other characters are unforgettable. Hal Sparks as a charismatic cult leader is especially funny, as well as his swooning members. There are truly too many to list.
I think the definitive moment of Dude, Where's My Car? is the Chinese drive-thru scene. For the unlearned, they drive up and order, only to be answered with ""And Then!"". Kutcher offers many suggestions, only to be given ""And Then!"" It's wonderfully repetitive,long,annoying which just gives the scene its hilarity. Also, you can immediately determine in a crowd of several of whom have seen the epic Dude, Where's My Car? by only blurting out loud ""AND THEN!"" Immediately those who are in your inner circle of friends will burst into laughter and the rest will be quite puzzled. Don't be left out.

It is a little ""Star Wars"", ""Who Am I"" and a lot of ""Half Baked"". It tells the story of two ""shibby""-loving dorks, Jesse(Ashton Kutcher) and Chester (The funny-as-hell Seann William Scott), trying to find out the location of their car, where they put the gifts they bought their girlfriends, and why the hell they have a lifetime supply of pudding in the fridge. Along the way, the meet an ostrich-loving frenchie (Brent Spiner), alien worshipers(led by ""Queer as Folk""s Hal Sparks), and a mercedes owning playboy (Fabio).

Instead, they used the ""dumb movie"" premise as an excuse to completely ignore questions about plausibility and create an engaging plot that makes sense by its own bizarre logic. A lot of thought and heart went into this movie - it's the best dumb movie it could have been, and maybe the smartest stupid movie I've ever seen.
