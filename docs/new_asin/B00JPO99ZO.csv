6388442,1,B00JPO99ZO,"This terrible movie is the sum result of having terrible direction, terrible writing, and terrible production, all being done by same person.  Every line of dialog is stilted and doesn't resemble natural conversation whatsoever in any period of American history.  Did I mention that this movie has no plot?  It has no plot.  It has no dramatic structure.  It has no plot outline.  It has no story arch.  It has no story to arch.  This is protestant evangelical christian propaganda attempted to be delivered in the form of entertainment by people who don't have the faintest clue about how to make movies.  It's a complete waste of time.  Even their own congregation would struggle to stay awake if forced to watch this drivel in church.",1453766400,5,737,4.824

OMG, this is the greatest/worst Civil War movie Ever...ever.

This this this...this cinematic masterpiece is awesomely, incoherently and anachronistically an amazing shniz show. the script is DIDUNCULOUS, the acting is a high level Junior High and the history...LoL..i mean there are these parts of the movie where 9-10 year old girls--with one as an anachronistic voice of reason--looking to solve a Civil War murder?! What? Throw in the Underground Railroad and the 14th Ohio? [ok 1 real bitch about history] and awfully--just wow woefully bad acting coupled to even more worse [did you see what i just did there] awkward like a great dane/chiuhuaha puppy.

6388445,5,B00JPO99ZO,"Our family thought ""The Light of Freedom"" was both inspirational and educational. This isn't your typical hollywood movie about slavery. This film covers the very serious topics of slavery and the civil war in a way that is friendly for all audiences. Both slavery and war are dealt with in a way that is safe for children without minimizing the seriousness of the time period in history. Our children really enjoyed the film and learned a lot. It also has a strong Christian message that is portrayed throughout. We highly recommend this for family viewing!",1436659200,2,558,4.88421052631579

6388447,1,B00JPO99ZO,"This is soooo sad.  Amateur actors doing the best they can of a community theater production with professional sets.  This was painful to watch.  They tried, bless their hearts.",1429056000,3,177,5.0344827586206895
6388448,2,B00JPO99ZO,"Praise for the effort, but production resources appear very slim for this movie.  Useful for history classroom or young family instruction perhaps.

This show is faith based but general enough to appeal to a broader audience.  If you have an interest in learning about the underground railroad and don't mind a very unpolished production, this still may be for you.  The acting and delivery is about the level of a local theater troop that operates on a modest budget or volunteer basis.  Sound engineering and background music was a little overbearing at times.  I have no doubt that many actors donated their valuable time freely to create this movie.  Part of my critique is based primarily on entertainment value though it is instructional.

THE PLOT:  The year is 1861 and President Lincoln has called for 75,000 volunteers to join the Union Army as the nation teeters on the brink of war.  Underneath the political turmoil, another battle is being waged behind the scenes for decades.  The struggle to conduct the Underground Railroad.

Station Master William Hanby helps runaway slaves reach for freedom, dangerously defying the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 and putting his own family at risk.  The situation becomes more dangerous when a bounty hunter shows up determined to make money by capturing escapees and returning them to their masters.  The show includes the true life plights of individuals who ran for freedom and the heroes who risked their lives to save them.

I am just being honest when I say I struggled with the acting.  However, the travails of the people in these stories is extraordinary and worth while.",1405468800,11,1630,4.959409594095941

6388452,4,B00JPO99ZO,"A cute little innocuous show about the underground railroad and the early part of the Civil War.  Good for kids, they will learn more in this one show than they will learn in years of school of our crappy school system.",1472342400,,219,4.341463414634147
