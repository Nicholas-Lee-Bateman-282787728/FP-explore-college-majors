8589940,1,B00D6I7IK8,"Maria Hunter's  (Nicole Signore) family was killed by vampires. She goes ""Buffy"" on them. At 35 minutes into the film we find out these vampires are similar to ""Twilight"" vampires with clans in different locations. Most vampires don't kill humans anymore, but the Stalker (Matt Kennedy) is a rogue vampire who does and BTW here is his address.

This is without a doubt the worst film I have ever seen with ""Bloodlust"" in the title. It is extreme low budget, on the order of ""Brain Damage"" films. The acting was unexpectedly bad. There were awkward shadows on the walls from camera lights. The sound editing was MST bad. Vampire growled like tigers, although the sound didn't match up. People would get cut and stab by a blade and you hear metal clanking. The whacking sounds of people hitting each other were absurd. The fighting choreography was the pits. The film is difficult to sit through.

I did like an early scene where Maria's brother (Josh Gray) who can't outrun a walking vampire pulls a crucifix off the wall to hold up to the vampire. The vampire takes the crucifix from the victim and gently hangs it back on the wall before ""lunch.""

Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Not much on special effects either.
