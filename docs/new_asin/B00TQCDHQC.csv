8702751,4,B00TQCDHQC,What a very bizarre but good movie. I think gay men are probably the only kind of people that would enjoy this movie.,1443571200,,117,4.130434782608695
8702752,2,B00TQCDHQC,"This is an extremely weird ""gay classic"" from 1996.  1/4th of the way in I attempted to turn it off but since I paid for it I finished it.  It's actually not ""bad"" nor really is it a ""classic"".  It's part porno (lots of sex scenes and nudity), part unresolved mystery and part romance.  The movie feels more like a weird collection of ideas and side plotlines that don't go anywhere.  The main theme of the movie is about what gay hustlers go thru in their business.  A strange man (played by Bruce LaBruce, who's voice is just annoying) coming to LA to learn about the gay hustler profession (why we are never told).  He runs into Monti (Tony Ward) and it's clear he is smitten with him.  Monti shows him the cruise sites and explains a little how the hustler life is.  Then there are those plotlines that get started and disappear.  There is scenes of (a possible) serial killer.  Scenes of a porno star so desperate for work he ends up at an ""escort"" place where he is forced into an orgy.  Scenes of graphic S&M involving a very creepy old man who claims to be a TV star and model.  I suppose this is all meant to be a satirical look at male prostitution but it just falls short.  This is film making 101: don't start plotlines and never complete them.  I would give it three stars, as a movie, it's not as terrible as it seems and it's weirdness factor makes it a least slightly enjoyable but I downgraded to 2 stars cause I cringed during the scene when Morti is in the bathtub with his naked child.",1437004800,,1505,4.287234042553192
8702753,5,B00TQCDHQC,A one-of-a-kind movie. I am so glad that I purchased. And the stumping scene alone is a true classic. Recommend highly to anyone that is looking for the out of the norm film,1433203200,,173,4.2727272727272725
8702754,5,B00TQCDHQC,This new HD transfer is awesome!! Hustler White is quintessential LaBruce. This is definitely not your queer uncle's 'gay hustler' film. It's a beautifully warped snapshot of the 90s hustling scene on Santa Monica Boulevard. I feel like it's a mash-up of Gregg Araki's THE LIVING END and a Jean Genet 'rough trade' fantasy.,1428364800,2,323,5.0
