8111495,2,B000EMSO8O,"This 2 disc DVD set from Mill Creek Entertainment has 6 movies(3 on each disc). The 1938 classic Mi Candidato starring Pedro Armendariz Sr. and Domingo Soler is on disc two while most of the movies are raunchy sex comedies that you can't watch with yo' momma! Although, this set does include Nosotros Los Pelados(1984), a solid comedy-drama. Todos Queremos Con Ella is on disc 2; it's in really bad shape! The filmmakers didn't even clean up the audio tracks in post-production and I had to turn my TV all the way up so I could hear the movie. This DVD set is recommended only for hard core fans of Mexican movies.",1237161600,2,614,4.491071428571429
