2521654,4,B000EIZS28,Cast delivers solid performances. Lots of action that supports a story with multidimensional characters. Amazon's disclaimer about this DVD gave me some pause but it does work fine in both my BluRay/DVD players.,1397001600,,211,5.424242424242424
2521655,5,B000EIZS28,"I enjoyed this movie very much. The plot was good and entertaining and thoroughly enjoyed Richard Widmark and Jane Greer, as well as Trevor Howard.  Will continue to enjoy watching this movie in the future.  I saw it once years ago and was delighted to see I could get a copy (best of all, without commercials!)",1390262400,,311,4.535714285714286
2521656,3,B000EIZS28,"I remember seeing this film as a kid, and always remembered certain scenes many years later. For years I searched for this film, finding bootleg copies for many, many dollars. Finally, this copy came out and it is just as enjoyable as I recall. I have always been a Widmark fan, ever since I can remember, and his pairing with Jane Greer is a treat.",1388102400,,349,4.384615384615385
2521657,5,B000EIZS28,I haven't seen this movie for years and years; it's still as great as I remembered!  I've always enjoyed Richard Widmark's acting ability.,1376524800,2,138,5.0
2521658,4,B000EIZS28,"Richard Widwark does a great job in this jungle adventure. A little different with the setting for this movie, but decent acting with good villians.",1371254400,2,148,4.96
2521659,5,B000EIZS28,"It took years to find this rare Richard Widmark adventure, and to find it to be in visually flawless condition, a great pleasure!  The story is perhaps a mild takeoff on the famous story, ""The Most Dangerous Game,"" but it is certainly ""its own story,"" and is well worth owning for Widmark fans.  Being able to find this one, and ""The Last Wagon,"" almost rounds out my favorite Widmark films.",1370390400,3,391,4.571428571428571
2521660,3,B000EIZS28,"I saw this film upon its initial release when I was a kid in the 50's. I liked it then and it hasn't lost too much in the intervening years. A remake of ""The Most Dangerous Game"" it was shot in Mexico and really has that ""on location in the wilds"" look. This film brought actress Jane Greer out of retirement and consequently nearly ended her life. She smashed her tailbone while doing stunt work in the rapids, breaking the skin. A day later after filming in fetid swamp water she developed a painful condition that not only hampered her for years, but after 5 years the then unknown virus ultimately marshaled its attack on her heart. No less than famed heart surgeon Michael DeBakey performed a delicate 4 hour operation to remove all remnants of this virus giving her a full recovery.  The film is worth a look, however I was disappointed that MGM released this video in a 2.0 aspect ratio instead of the 2.35 that it was originally filmed in. (The reason I give it 3 stars instead of 4.)  I've seen it on Turner Classic Movies in something approximating its original aspect ratio so I would assume with a little more diligence this could have been achieved. I suppose MGM just doesn't want to spend the time (or money) on something that's not likely to find a big enough audience. To bad, it is a decent enough film in the mold of ""they don't make 'em like that anymore"" and worth a better effort than given here.",1370131200,3,1418,4.42911877394636
2521661,3,B000EIZS28,"""Run for the Sun"" is a 1956 Technicolor adaptation of Richard Connell's 1924 story ""The Most Dangerous Game"" about a big game hunter who is stalked by a Cossack aristocrat in a Caribbean island. In 1932 the story was made into a film, and in 1956 it was altered further to include a romantic subplot, a change of venue, and Nazi war criminals replaced the Cossack.

Rugged and handsome Richard Widmark (1914-2008) plays a Hemingway-esque writer turned recluse.  Widmark was nominated for an Oscar and winner of a Golden Globe for his debut film (""Kiss of Death"", 1947) and also nominated for an Emmy for ""Vanished"" (1971). He appeared in more than 50 films, initially as a villain but increasing as a hero.

Jane Greer (1924-2001) plays a tabloid writer on a secret mission to get a story about Widmark. Greer was one of the queens of film noir, featured in the excellent book ""Dark City Dames"" by Eddie Muller. She had a successful career in films and later on TV, but never really made the A list. This was Greer's return to the screen after she retired in 1953 to spend time with her family. Unfortunately doing her own stunts she became infected with a rare virus and almost lost her life. The subsequent recovery kept her away from films until 1964.

Trevor Howard (1913-88) plays an Englishman who betrayed his country and is hiding in the Mexican jungle. Howard was a great actor, nominated for an Oscar (""Sons and Lovers"" in 1960) and 3 Emmy's (1963, 1966, and 1975) and he won the Emmy for ""Incredible Mr. Disraeli"" (1963). He also had 3 nominations for a Golden Globe, starting in 1961 (""Sons and Lovers"") and ending in 1987 (""Christmas Eve""). Howard appeared in nearly  100 films, including ""The Third Man"" (1949), ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" (1962), ""Von Ryan's Express"" (1965), ""Ryan's Daughter"" (1970), ""Superman"" (1978), and ""Shaka Zulu"" (1987).

Polish born Peter van Eyck (1911-69) made a good living playing Nazi officers (""5 Graves to Cairo"", ""The Bridge at Remagen""), as he does in this film.

In 1956 viewers were lured by the blockbusters - ""The Ten Commandments"", ""Around the World in 80 days"", ""War and Peace"", and ""The King and I"" were the box office favorites. The Oscars went to ""Giant"" (Director), ""Anastasia"" (Actress), and ""Lust for Life"" (Supporting Actor). Other notable films that year included ""The Searchers"", ""Baby Doll"", ""The Rainmaker"", and ""Bus Stop"".

This type of man hunting film has been popular at various times. Recent versions include ""Naked Fear"" (2007), ""Hard Target"" (1993) with Jean Claude van Damme, ""Surviving the Game"" (1994) with Rutger Hauer, and ""The Running Man"" (1987) with Arnold Schwarzenegger. Previous film versions include ""The Most Dangerous Game"" (1932) and ""A Game of Death"" (1945). My absolute favorite man-hunts-man films are Cornel Wilde's ""Naked Prey"" (1966) and Lee Marvin vs. Charles Bronson in ""Death Hunt"" (1981).

Nazi war criminals in South America appear in Hitchcock's ""Notorious"" (1946), John Forsyth's ""the Odessa File"" (1974), and Gregory Peck in ""The Boys from Brazil"" (1978). In 2013 it was revealed that a total of 9,000 actually made their way to Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay.

This film is OK when the final chase scenes come, but that's nearly an hour into the film. The first half is absorbed with the budding romance between Widmark and Greer, and their lack of on screen chemistry doesn't help. The final clash will seem a little ho hum by today's standards.",1370131200,5,3462,4.912671232876712
2521662,4,B000EIZS28,"A favorable variation on the madman-hunting-humans theme from British director Roy Boulting, 'Run for the Sun' (1956) succeeds for the most part as an efficient little Technicolor thriller/adventure. A well thought-out backstory, smart characters, and a dash of romantic tension make for a more plausible framework than other entries in the genre, and performances, particularly Trevor Howard and Peter van Eyck as exiled ex-Nazi in-laws bent on keeping nosy Richard Widmark and Jane Greer from exposing their past affiliations, elevate a pleasingly pulpy script (co-written by Dudley Nichols).  Nice photography (shot on location in Mexico and presented in Superscope!) adds the right touch of visual texture.  3 1/2 stars.",1367020800,6,724,5.63302752293578
2521663,5,B000EIZS28,Saw this movie many times when it was on tv.  Always like Richard Widmark in it. The plot is unique and not told in a million different other movies.,1365120000,2,149,4.137931034482759
2521664,4,B000EIZS28,"Richard Widmark interesting and good as always -- great personality, good acting.  Tight script. Good pacing. Trevord Howard great at playing smooth and sinister.",1353542400,2,162,5.75
2521665,5,B000EIZS28,"The transfer is excellent, wonderful color and definition.
The story, based on ""The Most Dangerous Game,"" still holds up. Widmark and Greer are
fun to watch.
Service from Amazon excellent as usual.",1346976000,5,197,5.1875
2521666,5,B000EIZS28,"For many, many years this was my all-time favorite movie!  As time went by, so many other great action movies came out that this one moved done my list a bit, but it's STILL near the top...and I own over 2000 movies, and see about three new ones per week....so that's saying quite a bit.  This is directed by Roy Boulting (who was Hayley Mills' first husband), but like many of Alfred Hitchcock's movies, this film tells the story of one man facing the odds alone!  It's the story of a famous award winning writer, who after the war (WWII) decides he wants to get away from the rat race and goes to central Mexico to get away from all the hub-bub of the business world.  A woman journalist is sent by her famous magazine employer to try and track him down and get his 'story' on why he disappeared like he did. She finds him and he is allusive as ever and won't cooperate with her wishes for his story.  They're attracted to each other, but she finally gives up on her story and he agrees to fly her to Mexico City in his old Piper Cub plane, so she can go back to New York City.  But her magnetic note pad in her purse fouls the plane's compass and then all hell breaks loose!  I won't go into details, but what follows is a FABULOUS story and the details are amazing.  She learns more about his war past and their adventure together is incredibly exciting!

By the way, I've looked for this movie for literally DECADES on VHS and I've NEVER been able to find a commercial copy anywhere!  My only copy was a homemade VHS I taped off of TBS Atlanta.  Crappy copy, with commercials still in it!  I FINALLY saw this Spanish/Mexican DVD on Amazon, which is totally all in English and great quality!  It plays on all my DVD players and is wide screen.  Make sure you're getting a copy that will play on U.S. machines!",1316044800,18,1813,4.278592375366569
2521667,1,B000EIZS28,"I didn't read carefully that this dvd was in European format when I ordered it.  I couldn't find this movie anywhere else but this seller.  I had a difficult time getting a partial refund from this seller.  So, beware when you purchase dvds.  Read all the fine print.",1303084800,2,267,4.5
2521668,4,B000EIZS28,"This is a great, old-fashioned adventure thriller with terrific locaton filming which adds a real air of authenticity to the whole proceedings. The DVD is bare-bones but great quality - anamorphic widescreen 2.35:1 taken from a very nice, sharp, colourful print free of defects.

If you love old British adventure movies like this and ""Northwest Frontier"", check this one out. It's dirty, sweaty and gritty, and always entertaining.",1210032000,11,432,5.352941176470588
8110553,4,B000EIZS28,"Oh, man, Michael Latimer (Richard Widmark) sure was having a fine time of it in San Marcos, that tiny Mexican town. Michael - or ""Miguel"" - used to be an important writer until he lost his way or lost his mojo or whatever, and dude stopped writing. Nowadays, he spends his days fishing and carousing.

Michael Latimer is very hard to track down. Leave it up to intrepid newswoman Kate Connors (Jane Greer) to unearth his ass. Maybe it's because she attended Kansas College. Maybe they teach 'em super-smart there. Kate writes the editorials for the New York-based Sight Magazine. Her latest assignment is tracking down and getting the scoop on Latimer.

But let's get to the nitty gritty of the plot. In San Marcos, Kate and Latimer argue and flirt and drink drinks and have a sort of falling out, and Kate decides to leave. Latimer, who is also a pilot, is enough of a gent to offer to fly her to Mexico City, back to civilization.

The one lesson to take from this movie is to never ever place a journalist's magnetic notepad - hear that, Kate? - next to an airplane compass. Because it screws with the compass' sense of direction. Latimer keeps on flying thaaaat way, thinking he's headed for Mexico City. Only, he isn't.

When the plane runs out of fuel, it crashes into the vastness of the Mexican jungle. Luckily, our couple survive the crash landing. Unluckily, they're stranded in the middle of nowhere. Luckily, look, there's a plantation. Unluckily, it's inhabited by Nazis.

RUN FOR THE SUN is another take of THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME. It benefits from having Richard Widmark as its lead. Me, I'm more used to seeing Widmark, who has such a live wire persona, play the villain role. As the protagonist he lends an interesting, very charged dynamic. I don't know if I would've bought anyone else bringing such a sense of outrage as he does in the scene in which he learns that his hosts at that plantation turn out to be Nazis-in-hiding. Latimer's outrage compels him to speak out against his hosts, which is the stupidest thing he could've done. Because, after that, all bets were off. Even Brown (Trevor Howard), the polite Englishman and Nazi sympathizer, must bow down to the need to eliminate the two plane survivors.

It's a terrific movie. And, for those who care about such things, it was originally presented in Superscope 235. Gratifyingly, for the now hunted Kate and Latimer and for you and me, as well, Latimer turns out to be immensely resourceful when cornered. I love the traps that he constructs. And there's an absolutely jawdropping scene in which Latimer makes use of his one lucky bullet. But, then, when he and Kate got out of being trapped from inside, why didn't he pick up that rifle that was lying there? Other than Latimer mouthing off at the worst time, not picking up that rifle was the movie's stupidest move.

If I had it right, this movie was Jane Greer's comeback after years of retirement from acting. Well, she hasn't skipped a beat. I enjoyed the chemistry between her and Widmark. I guess I just don't see Widmark as a romantic lead type, but I bought it for this movie, and, maybe, Jane Greer had something to do with that.

This movie was shot on location in Mexico, something that Ms. Greer probably regretted later on. She was game, you got to give her that. She broke her tailbone on some rock while performing her own stunt. And she was dragged thru nasty swamps. Four years after the movie, in 1960, she contracted a mysterious illness, symptoms of which were fatigue and chest pains that lasted for years. Finally, she was diagnosed with a heart virus that then required surgery. So, yeah, Mexico. Good times.",1524268800,,3663,4.659442724458204

I have over 4,000 dvd's & Blu-Rays in my library and the subjects range from everything and the year range of my library is 1936-2014. For the next couple of years I plan to add many movies from the 1950's. Another Widmark movie that I wish was available on DVD is ""A Prize Of Gold"". Its about a heist of gold in Britain involving a U.S. serviceman(Widmark) and British gangsters",1421798400,3,658,4.357723577235772
