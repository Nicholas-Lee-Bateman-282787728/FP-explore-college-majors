I have a large stomach/abdomen and I do not have strong arms. She moves a little fast some times, but if you take it at your own pace you won't get lost. And it does make you feel better, and not a lot of perspiring so I usually do the program before bed.",1120521600,8,372,3.973333333333333
2194860,5,B0006TPDXO,"I love this DVD! I purchased it after reading about it in USA Today and I am so glad that I did. Working through the exercises with Megan is well paced and clearly explained. I did the whole workout the first time I put in the DVD. As a plus sized woman, I used to be intimidated by exercising and joining classes at the gym. Using this DVD I feel better and I actually look forward to exercising. I hope that there are further DVDs released with Megan Garcia that follow this Body Beautiful format.",1119484800,12,499,4.2631578947368425

She is wonderful and this easy for the average person...any one can do it.  I feel wonderful after doing it and actually look forward to my time to spend in front of the TV with Megan each day.

I've tried Yoga classes before, but honestly it's hard to be the biggest person in the class, and I haven't ever really been able to stick with it.

2194874,5,B0006TPDXO,"I'd been searching for something to exercise to and came across Yoga: Just My Size. What an idea. Actually have something for large people, by a large person. I'd been so sick and tired of video's by females that didn't weight 100 pounds soaking wet. Exercising at a pace I couldn't possibly keep up with. I was looking for something that didn't rattle my bones. This was the answer. It's geared for large people, is easy to follow and will not jar you to pieces. Yoga is a gentle, slow paced stretching video that just works wonderfully for me. I can not do the Jane Fonda routines nor the Richard Simmons ""oldies"" routines, as much as I'd like to. I'm too large.  This video is perfect.",1287360000,8,688,4.4603174603174605
2194875,3,B0006TPDXO,"Being absolutely new to yoga, I can't tell you how this compares to other beginner videos. I can say that Garcia was pretty thorough in explaining the positions, the background music was soothing yet non-intrusive, and I even liked the transitional screen with its slow-moving clouds. However, the one thing which kept me from enjoying this dvd as much as I'd like is that a lot of the positions she chose to feature placed a lot of forward leaning weight on my wrists and held it there for some time. I simply couldn't do any of these exercises as the pain became intolerable. While some may not experience this problem, I think these positions should have been limited as it's hard enough for a smaller individual to support their entire upper body with their wrists, much less a plus sized person who is carrying more weight. At the very least, there should have been modifications given to address different body types. Some may think my expectations in this regard are too high, but if this video is specifically targeted towards plus sized women, the plus size body type should be addressed. Extra weight in areas such as the stomach or chest can seriously impede certain positions...but none of this was addressed in the video.",1286064000,7,1234,4.771028037383178
2194876,4,B0006TPDXO,"This was my first yoga DVD, and it was a friendly and encouraging introduction to yoga.  The poses provide challenges for newbies like myself (my friend and I were both flushed and had elevated heart rates by the end of our first practice), but are definitely achievable, especially with the various modifications Megan offers.

In addition to the skills on the DVD itself, Megan teaches by example that you have the option to alter a pose as needed.  Some yoga instructors want their students to perform identical, textbook poses, which is neither realistic nor healthy for all students.  This video demonstrates that you can and should make reasonable changes to accommodate your ability level and the simple fact of physics that two things cannot inhabit the same space at the same time (darn boobs--always getting in the way!).  For me, this realization was incredibly useful and encouraging.

My positive early experience with Megan gave me the confidence to broaden my repertoire with other DVDs and more difficult poses.",1279324800,5,1027,5.083333333333333
2194877,4,B0006TPDXO,"I've been looking forward to trying yoga for a while! I netflixed this dvd and tried it out last night.
Pros:
--very calm, breaks up the poses so i knew when to transition
--not too long (i think if you go straight through the poses it's 45-50 minutes?)
--Garcia talking through the poses helps since i've never done yoga before

Cons:
--the talking, while helpful, is a little distracting, i wish the was a feature to mute her voice, or a limited dialogue feature so i could focus on what i was doing
--the modifications were limited and not anything special - a pillow here, bend less there, use a chair. im larger than Garcia and was able to do many poses without support of a chair. pillows, yes, but pulling chairs up is more work in my little studio apartment. i'd just rather learn to do the poses without the modifications.

i wish there was a part 2! Overall, I like the instruction. i went through the DVD again this morning and while i enjoyed it, i can see myself getting bored with the routine quick. i'll take recommendations on other DVDs to netflix/purchase. i would consider buying this DVD for myself (which is important because i don't buy DVDs, ever!)",1273104000,2,1171,4.518867924528302
2194878,1,B0006TPDXO,I am a beginner at yoga and the tape was really easy to get through. I even enjoyed the modifications. I am size 20 and the tape feels like I am waisting my time. It is not a real work out at all. It was a waist of money. Great deep relaxation at the end though...I think the real problem for me is the fact that the instructor is plus size so it makes it really hard to beleive that this workout will allow me to lose weight and meet my goals. If she follows the yoga probgram shouldnt she look lean and great too. Maybe its just me...,1262476800,2,536,3.926605504587156

2194880,2,B0006TPDXO,"While I very much enjoyed seeing a plus-sized woman teaching yoga, this video was absolutely useless for me.  As another disappointed purchaser commented, the limited modifications are in a separate part of the video.  If you're unable to jump into the video from the get-go, it can be very frustrating trying to learn the modifications then work them into the video.  Further, as someone who has difficulty getting up and down from the floor, I would never have purchased this had I known that much of the workout expects just that.  Some of the chosen floor poses are further complicated if you have a large stomach/abdomen.  All in all, the video left me feeling frustrated and cringing at the word ""yoga.""  If you were hoping for something designed for a wider range of abilities, plus size or not, I would recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-for-the-Rest-of-Us-with-Peggy-Cappy/dp/B0001IXT90/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga for the Rest of Us with Peggy Cappy</a>.  It really is Yoga for the Rest of Us, and presents various positions and their modifications as you follow along the video.

2194881,4,B0006TPDXO,"Her method and way of teaching is great. I'm a big fan of her book, Mega Yoga, and I picked this up because of the great reviews.  After working with the book for as long as I have, this is pretty much the ""quickie"" workout version.  After doing it, watching her, following her lead (which is absent in books) with the music, I learned to pace myself better than I was, and I felt super relaxed afterwards.  It was a great augment to what I've already learned, and my normal routine.  My only complaint is that I want more!  I want the entire routine, all the moves! I want to be really worked over, and tired.

All in all, it's great, makes you feel good, tranquil, stretched, and like you've really accomplished something in that half hour.",1249689600,3,742,4.37956204379562
2194882,5,B0006TPDXO,"This DVD was my first experience with yoga, recommended for PT following a broken ankle.  I like it a lot for these reasons:
1) the poses are possible for everyone to do, regardless of body-type;
2) minimum chanting (since I'm not a ""believer"" in that aspect of yoga, just want to exercise);
3) Megan moves slowly and illustrates poses very well;
4) the narrator describes most poses in enough detail that I can follow by listening.

What I wish: the workout was longer (45 instead of 30 min) or she comes out with another more advanced DVD.

At the end of the DVD, I feel exercised (in the positive sense), relaxed and yet energized.  I do modify one pose for me to prevent pain, and that's a great thing about DVD workouts in your house- no one tells you you are doing a pose wrong when you have to modify it for your own body's needs.

I also bought the book by Garcia, reviewed separately.",1245715200,2,893,4.387878787878788

2194884,4,B0006TPDXO,"Yoga really is for everyone, not just the young, fit, skinny, and flexible, as Megan Garcia demonstrates in the video, Yoga Just My Size, produced in association with Just My Size (JMS), the plus size clothing company.

Garcia, a successful plus size model and certified yoga teacher, is an inspiration to women everywhere. She glows with healthy confidence and exudes a positive body image lacking in so many of us.

Megan explains the purpose of the video in an interview included on the DVD: to help full figured women discover the benefits of yoga with poses that have been modified to accommodate a large body. With regular practice, this gentle DVD is designed to help increase self-confidence and body awareness, improve posture ad flexibility, and create a sense of calm.

Yoga Just My Size is one of the few yoga for plus size programs performed by somebody who is actually plus sized.

The 28-minute Yoga Just My Size program is divided into 3 sections: Warm up (10 minutes), Workout (15 minutes), and Deep Relaxation (3 minutes).  Throughout the program, Megan provides clear voiced over instructions that are positive, nurturing, and uplifting.

The warm up begins with seated focused breathing to quiet the mind and focus attention. She chants OM, to further quiet the mind and then moves through several more gentle postures to awaken and warm up the body. Each posture is held for five deep breaths.

The workout portion of Yoga Just My Size includes several standing poses that are performed slowly and purposefully with Megan providing good alignment instructions for performing the poses safely. She also mentions the benefits of each pose, which I like.

The yoga workout then transitions back to the floor for four more poses that include table pose, child's pose, and downward facing dog pose. The deep relaxation section includes a guided relaxation as you recline on the floor and focus on your breathing.

The DVD also includes a Special Tips section where Megan demonstrates a few additional poses to help open up tight areas and explains how to modify various poses with the use of props such as a warrior pose with a chair, downward facing dog pose at the wall, and child's pose supported with pillows.

One nice feature of the DVD is that you can do the whole program or just one section, such as the warm up to begin your day or the deep relaxation just before crawling into bed.

Overall, this is an excellent DVD for the plus size yoga beginner. But may be too basic for more experienced yoga students.",1241481600,3,2533,4.840277777777778
2194885,3,B0006TPDXO,"As a woman ""of size"" and a beginning-intermediate yoga practitioner, I was very interested to see this video.  It seems that all too often my yoga teachers don't appreciate that my boobs and belly just don't fit into certain poses.  So what I've been doing is figuring out what exactly is the point of each asana- to lengthen the spine, to stretch the groin, to open the chest- and focusing on that, rather than worrying about doing it just like the teacher.  That has worked pretty well for me, really, but sometimes I'm just not sure how to get there, and sometimes my teachers really don't get it!  So what I really wanted from this vid was a discussion of modifications for those of us with fleshy bits that get in the way.  Unfortunately, the modifications she gives are really for people who are INFLEXIBLE, rather than FAT.  Only one mod was what I was looking for(the one for Child's Pose), and that one I already knew.  Plus, I wish she would offer the mods in the video or announce at the beginning of the workout to look at the ""Special Tips"" section first, and I also wish she would discuss yogic philosophy during the workout.

That being said, I do have a big crush on Megan Garcia now for being so beautiful and happy in her body and accepting of big girls.  This video is really great for beginners, especially those who don't know anything about yoga to start with or are extremely inflexible.  And I did learn a couple new poses, so that's all to the good.  At some point, I hope to take a class with her in New York, because I believe I could learn a lot from her... but it's just not in this video.

P.S.  This really is not terribly related to this video, but it's a pet peeve:  where is all the yoga instruction for fat men??",1240617600,7,1747,4.351851851851852
2194886,5,B0006TPDXO,"This is a good intro to yoga for a beginner like me. I'd never done any yoga before because I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to do many of the positions because of my size. Just My Size gives me some good beginner positions that helped me realize that I'm more flexible than I thought. The positions given are simple ones, yet they still have an effect, I can feel the burn the next day in my sore muscles. I would definitely recommend this for any beginner and I would definitely buy more of her dvds.",1239753600,4,506,4.173469387755102
2194887,3,B0006TPDXO,I really enjoyed this from a relaxation stand point but it was WAY too easy for me personally. I have not done a whole lot of yoga and I'm not in very good shape and this presented no challenge what so ever. This would be a very good starting point for someone who is very out of shape and has no experience at all with yoga (or for people who just need to relax),1238803200,,363,3.918918918918919
2194888,5,B0006TPDXO,I actually love this dvd... Not just cuz it is slow. It is a real good stretch out.,1238284800,2,83,3.6666666666666665
2194889,3,B0006TPDXO,"This was a really good introduction to yoga for bigger bodies. I had never really done yoga so it went slowly and explained things well (instead of trying to guess what subtle movements were happening on the screen). I had a few complaints.

1. There were some details of the DVD that made me feel a little awkward about cultural appropriation- I don't want to do namaste or say ""Om"" or any of that, because I'm don't feel like I know enough about it to use it respectfully.

2. The timing was a little strange because the DVD would instruct you to take 5 deep breaths. I would be on my third by the time they would move on. (So maybe they meant deep and fast, but that feels counterintuitive to yoga).

But again, it's a good starting point, it is relaxing, it's a short routine so it can be easier to incorporate into your schedule, and there are great tips for folks that can't do certain movements because of weak joints or other physical ailments.

I've taken yoga classes from  a plus-size teacher who was very good at showing the class how to modify poses for a larger body, and I was disappointed that this DVD contained absolutely none of that content. If I were a beginner, I would have found the unhurried pace reassuring, but Megan Garcia doesn't explain any of the movements at all so beginners I'm sure would be lost. For someone with a little yoga experience, though, the pace is a little too slow and basic. At the end she puts all of the moves together so they flow into each other, which would be too hard for a beginner and still not very challenging to non-beginners.",1227830400,5,712,4.51937984496124

I am TOTALLY a newbie to yoga.  I thought I would share my first impressions with you. This is not for those already familiar with yoga. It would probably bore you and leave you feeling unchallenged.  First, the music is complementary without being a distraction. Megan's voice was clear and audible. Second, Movements were purposeful and provided complete demonstration of the move while explaining its purpose and there are easy transitions for poses. Third, DVD provides special tips for those who may find it difficult to do demonstrated poses. Tips before using:  Watch before trying DVD.  I reccomend you review the introduction first and then the interview.  Watch the tips which show alternate positions for those who have challenges due to body structure or  mobility issues.( Remember,we all have different levels of fitness and mobility.  Even though some of us may feel it is a great start for newbies and plus size, others may still have difficulty.) Finally, get comfortable and workout. AVOID or MUTE JUST MY SIZE commercial before watching.  It is loud and unsettling after reviewing the tranquill yoga DVD.Improvements Needed: I would reccomend that Megan do a side by side video of regular poses with alternate poses.

The workout feels great without pushing you too hard, and Megan's instructions are easy to follow; for  most of the video I didn't have to really watch, I was guided by her simple yet clear instructions. This DVD is a wonderful value! I'm feeling fit and stronger already, and the workout can easily be done in a small living room.",1212969600,2,506,4.382978723404255
2194906,5,B0006TPDXO,This is my second yoga DVD and I am a beginning yogini (again).  I travel frequently and take it with me to use in the hotel room when I don't feel confident enough to head to the fitness room.  I really like this video--I feel successful with it--I can at least do the poses (although not necessarily hold them).  It about 30 minutes long so I can do it in the morning and not have to sacrifice sleep.  It is very much a beginning video but its a great place to start and I am already starting to see my endurance build.  I hope Megan will do other videos that are a little more challenging or and/or longer.  Being able to adjust the poses to so that I can do them without struggling for breath (like child's pose) was an idea that I had not see before.,1212796800,2,755,4.1020408163265305
2194907,4,B0006TPDXO,"I love this. It's not too difficult, but plenty challanging. The steps are well explained, and the timing is good.

I'm big, and the positions chosen are easy to get into, and comfortable to maintain. One of the best features of this dvd is a section that shows you alternate positions if you can't get into a certain pose.

My one complaint is that the speaker does not formally begin or end the session. This is especially noticable at the end where you transition into relaxation and then.... nothing. the credits just roll. For people who have used other yoga tapes, or been to classes, it's disconcerting.

However it's a great  yoga dvd for ""the rest of us""",1211760000,2,663,4.593220338983051

When I came across this I had to try it and thanks to this DVD it got me on the path to yoga again....and loving it!  Megan Garcia is a perfect model for folks like me who are larger size and yet want to develop flexibility.  Now I've memorized the movements and the entire routine takes about 30 minutes.  Lately I've added in a Peggy Cappy DVD for variation.  I'm pleased that within three weeks I've felt more flexible and healthier and want to increase my skill in yoga.  Thank you Megan!!  I do wish, however, that these beginning DVDs would include a section of all the movements without any of the talk for those who feel they've mastered the poses.",1210291200,2,783,4.321917808219178

The workout has just the right blend of calming/meditation, warm-up, workout and relaxation.  It starts out with a few minutes of breathing to help you become tuned to your body.  It then moves into a series of gentle stretches to warm you up but that still give you some serious muscle work in the arms and legs.  The actual workout actual has me breaking a light sweat on some poses which I've never had with a Yoga workout.  It ends with some stretches and a final relaxation pose.  The entire DVD has a nice flow from one pose to the next with great instruction on how to transition from one to the other.

I like this well enough that I actually get up 30 minutes earlier so I can do this workout and still do my normal cardio.  I find that it is a great follow-up to my cardio as it allows me to get a good stretch and center myself before starting the workday.  It is easy enough for a beginner yet it also offers enough challenge to keep it interesting.  I highly recommend this one.  If you are considering the Big Yoga Hatha 1 beginner DVD, totally skip that waste and buy this one.",1205884800,7,1303,4.247967479674797

What I didn't like was the speed of the inhale and exhale cues. I don't know, maybe I have large lungs, but I was not able to get a deep breath on many of the poses.

I got the dvd today.(fast shipping) My 19 year old daughter who has been doing yoga since she went off to college and I did it together. Eventhough I know it was easy for her she enjoyed the gentle flowing workout. I enjoyed that for a true beginner I was not intimidated by the poses and I felt a great sense of accomplishment for being able to do it. I felt relaxed when it was over. I think I will get a copy for my daughter and her room mate who is a larger person like me. Great dvd,1198713600,2,598,3.950413223140496
2194917,4,B0006TPDXO,"I purchased this DVD with Meera Patricia Kerr's ""Big Yoga,"" both of which are marketed for plus-size people.  This yoga DVD wins, hands down.

First, Megan presents a lovely workout that is both challenging and relaxing for even a beginner.  She is calming and graceful throughout.  What I noticed is that every posture presented is attainable by most plus-sized people.  She does not tell you to stand with your feet together in mountain pose, because most plus-sized individuals cannot do that comfortably.  Instead, she has you stand comfortably.  The entire workout is like this.  Every movement is doable for most overweight folks.

The DVD consists of a warm-up, workout, and deep relaxation.  The warmup does get your pretty warmed up with twists, cat and dog, kidney squeeze, and leg pumps.  The workout mostly works on leg strength and focus.  The poses covered are mountain pose, warrior I & II, star & goddess, downward dog, and child's pose.  The deep relaxation is corpse pose.

As I said, all the poses are achievable for almost every body type.  I have lost a lot of weight (60 pounds), but believe I could have probably done this DVD at my highest weight.  This leads me to the only shortcomings: the length (it could be longer) and the fact that it becomes too easy too quickly.  I still do it and still love it.  I am just not sure how to make the postures more difficult so to get a great workout.  At this point, it is a great relaxing video on my days off from more intense exercise (Turbo Jam, Jari Love, the gym).  I am really hoping that Megan does another DVD that is more intermediate.",1198281600,7,1611,4.625441696113074
2194918,4,B0006TPDXO,I like the fact that the yoga is for anyone.  She does a good job of modifying the yoga for people who can't get into some of the poses and does a good job of taking her time and doing the poses so that you can learn how to do them well.  She is fit and flexible but she is not a skinny rail and that makes it much more comfortable following her.  A good mix of strength and streching poses.  This is a good fit for me.,1197590400,2,419,3.727272727272727
2194919,4,B0006TPDXO,"If you have always wanted to try yoga but have felt too intimidated, this is a great DVD to start with. Megan is an excellent instructor, and anyone can do the workout.

2194931,4,B0006TPDXO,"What a wonderful idea!  Use a plus-size instructor for a plus-size workout video!  Megan Garcia is a great instructor.
The moves are fully explained and the movements are done slowly enough that you're not struggling to keep up.
HOWEVER, if you're already in good shape physically, this is probably not the best video for you.  The moves are a bit easy for people who are more advanced in their fitness levels.
It is relaxing, but not incredibly challenging.  I give 4 stars for the idea, not the actual exercise.",1188259200,,513,4.730337078651686
2194932,4,B0006TPDXO,"I really enjoy this DVD, however I do have two issues.  1.  I think it could be longer and 2.  It's a bit more geared to relaxing then a exercise routine.

I realize this is geared to full figured Yoga practitioners, so I understand why this is not a ""hard"" workout.  I did not feel as though I burned calories, but I felt very relaxed and stress free!  So not bad at all!

Oh and at the end it puts you into a deep relaxation and then the DVD just loops music, no audio cue to get up or anything...so because I was so relaxed I laid there for a lot longer then I think I should have (eyes closed so didn't notice the screen changed, just kept listening to the music waiting for her to cue me awake!!  LOL).  Overall a nice introduction to Yoga and great for ladies of larger sizes with mobility issues (back issues, etc).  Worth a try!

I can't participate in a large portion of what he does and I am not sure how to modify the moves and get the same benifits from it.

2194937,2,B0006TPDXO,"The idea of a plus-size yoga workout is great, but this doesn't fulfill that need.  Megan is likeable and a good instructor.  But, and this is a big but. . . You have to watch a separate dvd extra to get the modifications--they aren't incorporated into the routine itself, which pretty much defeats the purpose.  You have to memorize the modifications and then remember them during the routine, which makes it harder to focus on the poses.  A second person doing the modifications during the routine itself would've made it much better, as the modifications are actually helpful and make uncomfortable poses more comfortable.  The routine itself is really basic and short--just 6 poses and it felt a little rushed (she says to hold poses for 5 deep breathes, and I barely got 2-3 deep breathes before she moved on).

If you're a complete couch potato, this DVD would a good place to start. It's nice to see someone who's not anorexic enjoying movement.  I hope Megan does another DVD soon, one that's more challenging and incorporates the plus-size modifications into the routine itself.",1181520000,92,1087,4.875

The workout is definitely for beginners, and anyone with yoga experience will probably find it much too easy, but for those of us who have let our middles get a little too soft and haven't stepped foot in a gym in a few years, it's a great DVD.

I am enjoying the nice flow from warm up to relaxation mode.  The music and narration are soothing and the poses and transitions are easy to follow.

It also says that it gives alternate poses for those with bodies not quite up to yoga par, but you have to switch to a spceial mode in order to do this and remember it for when SHE does the plain old yoga w/out the modifications. I've only used it once and it did make my back feel better for the day, but I can't bring myself to use it again because it's so dumb.

I tried kickboxing and salsa videos, but I was tired before I was out of the warm-up sections.  Each day it was getting harder and harder to move.  I knew I needed something, so I bought Yoga, Just my Size by Megan Garcia.  Wow!  It has been amazing.  I could do the poses and stretches right away.  I modified them at first, but within a short time I could do the poses without pillows or a chair.  My flexibility has increased.  I feel like I am lengthening my muscles and building strength.

When I came across Megan Garcia's DVD I figured it was worth a try.  The workout is a series of progressive yoga positions that not only stretch the muscles and flex the joints, but also involve vital organs.  Megan offers a few suggestions on how you can adjust a position to make it more comfortable for beginners.

This is the first workout of any kind that I have been faithful to for more than a few days!  It was surprizing how much I could do on my first workout, but even more surprizing how much more mobility I have in my joints in just three weeks!  I was one of those gals that would have to pull myself up from the floor by grabbing onto the couch or chair, but now I can stand upright from a kneeling position without holding on to anything!  Believe me, that was quite an accomplishment.  I see progress with each workout, which is very encouraging.

(I had tried Gentle Yoga with Naomi before, but found it too easy, and not enough excercise for me...it's more of a relaxation thing).  Also, I find Megans voice and music to be very soothing, not annoying at all.  I also find the length (about 28 minutes) to be good.  A full hour can be a bit daunting.

Megan looks like she is around clothing size 18 or 20.  There is a Spanish language option in the video.  The background music is the soothing, new age type. The warm-up and sequence of the postures make sense. The reason I did not give this video a 5 star rating is because there were no modifications of the poses for people who are not as flexible as Megan.  I feel the video would have been more helpful if she had included people who were larger, or less flexible.

I've tried other exercise programs and like many people with rheumatic conditions, suffered from ""delayed payback"" whenever I exercised. Then I started thinking that yoga might be a good idea because it is tends to concentrate more on breathing and relaxation instead of the frenzied exercise in other program. However, I was not sure I could do any yoga, since I am so overweight.

I'm not an expert in the art, by any means (although I now plan to go further), and as a Christian, I don't swallow all of yoga philosophy, but I've enjoyed this tape. The workout isn't too long for a beginner, the music is really relaxing and the explanations are pretty good. The breathing instructions could be a bit better and since that is an important part yoga practice, I recommend going to [.....]for more info on how to breath for each posture.

This DVD with Megan Garcia is a gentle practice and it was absolutely doable. Now I understand why yoga is so popular. I felt amazing afterwards.

... mostly I could not hold the poses for ""five deep breaths"" and be done with my five deep breaths anywhere near as fast as the leader was.  I was usually on breath #2 when she was moving on to the next thing.  Plus sometimes I thought the instructions given by the narrator didn't make sense (ie I found it impossible to twist to the right while head, shoulders, AND hips all went to the right too.  Some of that stuff goes LEFT when the rest goes right.  Just a little bit frustrating, when you're learning).

Also, many of the poses require that you put a lot of weight on your upper arms, forearms, and wrists.  After doing the video twice this week, I feel very sore and tendonitis-y in my wrists.

The leader and narrator were not too too heavy on the touchy-feely yoga get-in-touch-with-yourself commentary.  That kind of thing is a big turn-off for me so I was glad they kept it to a minimum.

I think this DVD is ok, just not great and not quite good enough to encourage me to keep at it. I didn't feel like I'd had a great workout afterward and I didn't feel like my stomach or legs got enough of a workout.",1131667200,19,1178,4.195555555555556

It helps give you an idea of where you will end up and makes you less dependent on watching and seeing what they are doing while you are trying to also move your body.

Now I use it to relax more than to work out, but there are still some challanging poses in there. I feel in many ways I outgrew it quickly, but I was also more familiar with yoga and quite flexible.

2195040,5,B0006TPDXO,"Megan Garcia presents a beautiful workout designed for plus-sized women and anyone who needs modified postures due to body shape variations. This workout will also be enjoyed by anyone starting Yoga because of the gentle approach. The exercise routine is divided into three sections:

Warm Up
Workout
Deep Relaxation

Megan Garcia introduces a variety of relaxing and balancing poses. After Sun Breaths while sitting, you ease your body into twists and then unique hip stretches where you slide your hips to the side while in the cat/dog pose. The gentle lunge didn't hurt my knees and when you move from the floor to standing, Megan makes sure you are making a gentle transition. Child's pose has modifications so you don't feel like your stomach
is uncomfortable and warrior poses are elegant and centering. You will be learning downward-facing dog and a relaxation pose at the end.

The teaching style is relaxing and nurturing. I love Megan's vibrant soul and positive attitude. Her eyes sparkle with a love for life and her goal is to make Yoga very accessible to all women. The bonus interview gives additional information and explains why Yoga is so important for women.

As you move through the postures, you will feel a sense of calm descending. A wonderful way to relax in the evening and this is a good introduction to yoga. I followed this workout with an additional relaxing stretching routine while listening to Kevin Kendle's Music for Yoga. If you are used to doing Yoga for an hour or more, you might want to do this workout twice or follow it with more stretching.

Megan Garcia helps to create a beautiful accepting space for all yoga students and I'm very impressed with her new DVDs. Her peaceful spirit and beautiful teaching style makes me want to continue with my own practice.

8043085,5,B0006TPDXO,"I was always a Fat Girl. I had tried some routines and never stuck with anything more than a few months because they never made me lose weight.

This DVD was floating around... my mother had learned about it and gotten it for my sister who hadn't really liked it... I ended up with it. And I decided to try it one day. I didn't have a mat or anything. I just gave it a go cause... why not.

It made me feel so good. The combination of the exertion, the meditativeness, watching this woman who is lovely and strong and beautiful but not shamingly thin, and not condescending or woo-y. It made me feel really comfortable with my body for 45 minutes and a good while after. It was hard but not too hard. Just hard enough for someone who had never done yoga, who was naturally fairly flexible and who was overweight and full of the self-loathing and obsessive self-hate feelings that went with that.

I never would have picked it up on my own because I would have though it was condescending. But in actuality it isn't because Garcia is one of us. And she has a strong powerful body that deserves love, just like we all do.

I didn't start doing it to lose weight, because I had lost hope of that. I just started doing it on a whim and then couldn't stop because it made me feel so good, so at peace with myself and my body---just as it was. I didn't start doing yoga to change my body. I started doing yoga because it made me learn to love my body.

I've been doing yoga for over a decade now. And I don't even own a copy of this DVD anymore. But it still keeps me sane, and makes me healthier and stronger and taller (literally!) And I am forever grateful to Megan Garcia for making this DVD because it was my way into something that has become my go to for peace and self-love.

The confidence and self-love yoga gave me has led to a major weight loss and I am a fairly advanced practitioner now --very bendy-- but every time I get a new DVD I want for it to be as transformative as this one was. To be easy enough and hard enough.... with some things I can do and some things I can start to learn and someday master ---enough that I can do to make me confident and enough I can't do to give me goals and that satisfaction months and years down the line when I get there...

It was right for me. A Fat girl who hated my body and had given up on ever being remotely ""athletic."" It set things in motion. It changed me.

Although the instructor is about as vanilla as could be, she was almost robotic in her evenness. I found the moves very easy to learn. Her instructions are slow and easy to understand. There is a quick preview in between sections that show you what you are about to do and I liked that a lot.

Some reviews have mentioned the challenges of some of the poses, like downward facing dog and the cat pose. Each require the participant to hold  their body weight on wrists and knees. This isn't easy for some. The constant bending of knees can be difficult for someone who already has knee problems. Make sure you are able to support weight on your wrists and bend knees repeatedly before attempting this DVD. Or at least understand the challenges that face you.
