5124864,3,B0083SBMGW,"First off, no digital copy.  For the price you should get a digital copy so lugging around blu-rays wouldn't be an issue.  I know the little (trust me, it will be small) suitcase is neat and all, but did you look at the blu-ray packages?  Unless you plan on storing the suitcase in your media shelf, these little cardboard blu-ray disk holders will not looks good stacked next to all your other blu-ray movies on your shelf.  Bad bad bad.  C'mon now!!!",1342396800,4,452,4.463414634146342
5124865,4,B0083SBMGW,"Let's all be honest. This is a shiny, drive-fangirls(and boys)-into-fits-of-giggles collection. The movies are all here, the packaging is fun, and oh! the extras, but there's one glaring(albeit minor) error here: no digital copies. I understand that this is about making money (the Harry Potter set coming from Warner Bros. has a similar issue), but to include 3D and ignore digital copies seems like, well, a pretty stupid oversight, especially when the breakdown comes to over $35 for each film, and particularly when the demand for digital media continues to grow. Most fans will already own copies (digital and otherwise) of the films, so this won't be a big deal for them. Others have no problem going the illegal route for downloads. For those holding out on buying the movies until a collection (such as this) came along, it's a bigger consideration. Silly oversight for an otherwise incredible collection.",1342224000,24,913,5.134228187919463

5124867,2,B0083SBMGW,"Somebody tell Marvel to make a less expensive version with no 3D discs added--then I'll be all over this. I don't own any of the Marvel films yet.

5124868,5,B0083SBMGW,"Strap in, this is gonna go on for a minute.

The Avengers was so hyped and publicized, that by the time it came out i was honestly expecting another ""Waterworld"". The slow build-up beginning in IRON MAN and slowly through THE INCREDIBLE HULK, IRON MAN 2, THOR and finally CAPTAIN AMERICA was a source of stress i haven't felt since sitting through the S.A.T's, and i was having serious doubts that the world could handle any more disturbingly bad ensemble superhero movies (Fantastic Four....anyone?!). Then, i turn on my tv one day and see that filming of said film has begun. Two words caught my attention and from that moment on i began to have faith.....JOSS WHEDON.

Yeah Im one of THOSE people.

The movie begins with an explosive introduction that sees S.H.I.E.L.D attempting to harness the power of the Cube, seen in C.A., for purposes of unlimited energy/weapons/etc. As Nick Fury, Hawkeye, and Dr. Selviig observe the process Loki appears and takes possession of not only the Cube, but the free will of Hawkeye and Selviig as well turning them into his slaves. After this, the next hour or so becomes Fury bringing the remaining team members together and allowing them to learn to work with each other. And then after some heartbreaking action, the story culminates with an action sequence that puts all three Transformer movies to shame.

The reasons (if you need them) to enjoy the film are....

1. NICK FURY portrayed by Samuel Jackson. Sam's presence alone pretty much captures your attention. Plus, it isn't Hasselhoff
2. CAPTAIN AMERICA portrayed by Chris Evans. I was doubtful before seeing C.A. but the guy does a great job of showing real loss and confusion in a world that he can no longer really relate to, but will die defending without hesitation. Plus, he isn't playing Johnny Storm
3. IRON MAN portrayed by Robert Downey Jr. I said it for years. This guy was always meant to play Tony Stark. Hopefully in the 3rd film will not be replaced by Val Kilmer.....
4. THOR portrayed Chris Hemsworth. I really enjoyed a more humble yet confident Thor in this movie, though I do understand why the whiny/arrogant one had to exist in his own movie. The character development on this one was perfect and i'm anxious to see what they'll do with him next.
5. THE HULK portrayed by Mark Ruffalo. Never really enjoyed his previous slackeresque roles before, but no one is lying when they say that the man stole the ever living hell out of the movie! Finally a Bruce Banner that i DON'T want to shoot in the face
6. BLACK WIDOW portrayed by Scarlett Johannson. Intelligent dialogue and ridiculously cool fight sequences throughout for the character. Definitely takes the assassin many steps past the character from IM2.
7. HAWKEYE portrayed by Jeremy Renner. Ive seen this guy for years from Angel to The Hurt Locker and The Town. Absolutely remarkable actor but unfortunately he was highly underused in the movie. Not that his scenes weren't completely badass because they were. Hopefully the role can be fleshed out a little more.

I could keep going but hopefully I'm making my point.

The film is full of great dialogue, great action, great music, and plenty of eye candy (Black Widow and Maria Hill in tight bodysuits....yeah). There's really nothing to complain about it except for the wait for the next phase",1339718400,77,3324,4.790575916230367
5124869,5,B0083SBMGW,"I have a blu ray player and the hdtv for this collection. Went to the Marvel Marathon to see all of these movies and want to own them all. Problem is with blu rays it still gets a little pricy. considering that you get each movie in a Blu Ray/3D combo pack, it makes sense to buy this set then each indivdually. Each Blu/3D combo movie is easily over 35 bucks and when you times that by 6, well, no brainer. Plus having the Avengers complete this set is the icing on the cake.",1338854400,7,476,4.074468085106383
5124870,5,B0083SBMGW,"I can't add anything to the other 5 star reviews.  I loved this film.  I went to see it more than once and am probably outside the ""target"" audience being female and over the age of 35.  If I can, I'm going to go back and see it again.

It's a very positive film about teamwork and putting aside differences to focus on what is really important and has a lot of exciting action sequences.  I do agree with the reviewers who felt Thor was slightly undertilized except he did get a number of great fight scenes.  The film does do a good job of reminding you he is a Norse god after all and thus not an easy individual to stop(I don't think it's spoiling anything to say that at one point, Cap whacks him in the head with his shield and he's none the worse for wear lol).  Black Widow was nicely fleshed out and the friendship between her and Hawkeye was well handled.  They finally found a Hulk that works(though I am one of the few who likes the Ang Lee/Eric Bana Hulk from 2003).  Captain America was really well done and full of heart, as he should be, makes you think ""a little old fashioned"" might not be such a bad thing. :)  And Iron Man was...Iron Man. A little too much with the one liners sometimes but he had a good story arc too.  All the characters meshed very well together and the action not only was great in a visceral sense but important to plot and characterization.",1338508800,19,1383,4.220532319391635
5124871,3,B0083SBMGW,"I was expecting the movies to come in standard DVD cases with a bit of fanfare, but what I got was the movies packed in cardboard sleeves and a whole bunch of pointless papers.  I'm giving it three stars because the movies work and that is what I purchased, but the add-on junk is just clutter.",1338508800,,294,4.25
5124872,5,B0083SBMGW,"I just loved Marvel's Avengers. I thought it was smart and the impressive cast really delivered! This movie works on so many levels and makes you draw on just about all of your emotions. I don't remember when I enjoyed a movie this much! Such cool fantasy but what makes it extra special is following this film after all the other solo efforts from each character. I enjoyed the others films quite a bit but they all delivered something different. Seeing them blend together in Avengers and the sparks that resulted was the extra special treat. Example: They blended the grounded futurist (Tony Stark) with the Norse thunder god and his angry brother in a perfect way. Same could be said for every other character. It all works. In fact, it doesn't just fit, it's a symphony and that dyconomy and difference in characters are what makes it truly great. It's why this movie stands so tall above any other franchise at the moment. Things like Transformers, GI Joe and even Star Trek all operate with monotone restrictions. Avengers covers all angles and delivers depth with its fun.",1337299200,14,1080,4.75

I'm currently keeping both eyes (STRONGLY) on the Phase 2 box set and should be purchasing it soon.

I gave this box set only 4 stars cause I'm not really into the cardboard cases it comes with that holds all the movies but other than that this box set is the most impressive in my collection and was so worth the $98.00.

5124890,5,B0083SBMGW,"This collection is very nice for big fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe who enjoy collecting memorabilia or for those who have not purchased any of the movies beforehand.  Included are six Blu-Ray discs, three Blu-Ray 3D discs, and one bonus special feature disc.  All of the discs come in custom sleeves with art designed around events in the respective film, and are a welcome alternative to a regular movie case. If you already own some of the movies included it then it may not be worth it to you, but there are still many reasons to consider buying it regardless.  The briefcase look is good because it keeps all of the discs in one easy location and it also houses one of the most memorable items from the first phase of films, the cosmic cube.  While the cube may be just plastic, it is back lit and shines a bright blue when the case is open and looks really cool on display.  The included dossiers on all of the heroes are well done as well, and they bring a new level of intimacy to the characters. Included are original Iron Man blueprints, Steve Rogers birth certificate, and redacted documents detailing the history of Black Widow, and more, all of which are entertaining to read. Some are items that were shown in the movies themselves, while others are personal items belonging to characters that we haven't seen, and they provide some clue as to the future of the films. The included dossiers may be best kept outside of the set however, as gravity will cause them to bend due to the way they are held in place when the case is closed.  As for durability, the casing is lightweight but still decently sturdy, and the inside attachments are held in with screws but can be easily dismantled if you so wish.  The last unique thing about the set is the bonus disc, which I won't spoil but it is worth a look for the behind the scenes features and the sneak peek at upcoming films.  As I said at the beginning, if you own several of the 6 movies included it may not be worth it to get these movies again, but I think the extra features and stylized setting are worth the extra price and would be a fine addition to many collections.",1474588800,,2146,4.428934010152284

It looked like a dollar store special and I'm not even kidding. For the price we paid for this collection this should have been made way better than what it was.

5124953,4,B0083SBMGW,"It took me by surprise, that I received it during Christmas Eve. And I was so glad despite I waited for more than two weeks since 5 Dec. I understand the circumstance due to the long distance from US to my country origin.

Overall, there are no omissions in terms of the commemorative & blu ray discs. However, the saddening part is the box side has been crumpled during the good in transit. And some of the disc covers had been teared slightly. Nevertheless, the high quality discs have been well compensated to the drawbacks.

Other is that I only realized that Iron Man & Iron Man 2 do not contain the behind scenes of the filming process. And I gotten to know that the making is only available in the separate blu ray disc set. That is unfortunate as I thought 'Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One' is a limited edition and I expect it includes the behind scenes for Iron Man 1 & 2. But overall it is a good collector set to keep if you are a true Marvel fan!",1451347200,,964,4.291208791208791

The Bluerays are cool, they even made a special menu that isn't the same as the one from the single disks you can buy in shops.

Pros:
- Blu-rays cases are beautiful
- goodies are great
- cheap price for the package
Cons:
- Tesseract is very cheap
- real French only on Iron Man, all the others are Canadian French

I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend, and granted we have most of the movies included in this collection, there is no comparison to the awesome comic covers they use for this disc holder and disc itself. The ""suit case"" has snapping locks that you open up to show a gleaming Tesseract (that you can take in and out). There is a handle on the suitcase so you can carry it as well. The movies are stored on the sides on the suitcase next to the Tesseract in a diagnoal placement for ease of grabbing and seeing the movie titles. The top of the suitcase when opened holds all these ""files"", which honestly I haven't even gotten into reading yet, but they look as if they include movie details, etc. Overall this is amazing and I highly recommend it.

5124968,3,B0083SBMGW,feels cheaply made.  brittle plastic.  the Tesseract inside didn't even work because this is so old the batteries for it were bad.  other than that you get the movies in unique sleeves and its a descent way to present it in a fun way.,1449705600,,234,4.2727272727272725
5124969,4,B0083SBMGW,worried about the bluray conditions inside the sleeves instead of a case; however it is a nice talking piece and good reminder of the movies,1449619200,,140,4.64
5124970,3,B0083SBMGW,"This is simply going to be a brief review of the packaging and presentation and worthiness of this Collector set... it's assumed that you're already a fan of the films (or at least some of them). I'm fairly critical of superhero movies, but most films in this collection are at least pretty good if not great. But this is going to be about whether to buy this box set or not.

The artwork on the disc sleeves is great (it's also carried on in Phase 2). Perhaps the best part of this set. The sleeves have a spine, but there's no label on the spine (the only real difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2). Unfortunately, the sleeves are thin and a bit flimsy - therefore prone to damage and easily ruined. I'm very careful with my nerdy collector things, and this collection is one of the more delicate.

One thing to take note of is that the way the disc sleeves are stored in the briefcase... there are pegs inside to hold them at an angle in slots on both sides of the cube you see in the photos. These pegs quickly damage the edge of the sleeves (even if you put them in gently), and while in storage, there's no way to see which disc is which, so... for me, this is not an option for storage.

The dossiers included do contain some pretty fun little elements. IDs, business cards, trading cards, newspaper clippings, cocktail napkins with notes, hospital ID bracelet, stickers, blueprints, etc... It all feels pretty incomplete though for a dossier. Like, if this is all the info we have on these people, then we don't know much. Also, much of it doesn't make sense to be included logically (which is a nit-pick honestly). The folders themselves are flimsier than actual cheap file folders, so again, they are subject to damage in the storage case.

The storage case has a plastic flap in the lid to store the dossiers - again, no thought was put into keeping the paper elements of the set from becoming dented, kinked, dimpled, bent, scratched, and otherwise ruined. Apart from that, the case itself is a cheap piece of made in China plastic with LED lights in it. The lights work, and the cube can be removed and shaken to cause it to flash. Is this fun? I don't know... not really. The cube doesn't have much weight to it, and doesn't really fit securely in the spot where it goes, so it's harder to get it to sit straight than it is to get it placed wrong. The case itself doesn't have much weight to it either... just feels cheap. The button on the front activates the light on top. The ""buttons"" inside the case (the keypad) aren't buttons - just for looks. The latches that keep the case closed aren't even latches. You just have to pry them back to open the lid. Poor design clearly done to reduce cost.

On the upside, the case looks sort of cool I guess. In all honestly, I'll probably throw it in a closet since from the outside, it just looks like a small crappy plastic useless briefcase rather than something fit for the DVD/Blu-Ray box set display case. Maybe as a toy for a child to play with and break or destroy. The files I will probably store elsewhere to keep safe.

At just over 100 bucks, I suppose this is a decent deal considering how many movies you get. I would have been happier with slim cases with the same artwork in a nice pressed cardboard box.

Another disappointment worth noting is that this didn't come with digital copies. The only thing that nudged this from ""Didn't Like"" to ""It's Okay"" is the content of the dossiers was sort of neat. Not worth buying the set over though. If you wait long enough, they'll probably release some other super limited ultra set BS.",1449532800,,3605,4.428355957767723

5125007,1,B0083SBMGW,"I completely agree with what most are saying about the case itself being REALLY CHEAP.
I bought this because I was in the mood to watch Captain America and thought to myself ""what If I get in the mood to watch the avengers or thor? I might as well buy a box set."" Now while I thought the pictures shown look awesome, the actual thing not so much. The cube which is supposed to light up never did, and even if it could I'm afraid it just looks so cheap I kind of want to just toss that away. Also the brief case looks like something my 6 year old cousin would store his toys in. Its such a cheap plastic. It's all actually kind of embarrassing the only thing I really like about it are the files inside. They have files on most of the avengers which is very cool, but again I do wish it was made out of better materials. For example, the news paper clippings feel and look like I just printed it out on my copier and put it in there. Also the DVDs themselves come in these glossy cardboard sleeves which while the art outside is very cool does not save it from being kind of useless. When I opened the box and took one of the sleeves the blu ray and 3D discs came falling out. All of the discs were not in their actual sleeves because the sleeves really do nothing to hold on to the discs, also when you put the sleeves back you really can only put them facing down again. At this point I really have no idea what I'm going to do with this very EXPENSIVE but cheap looking children's toy that is failing at keeping my DVDs from getting scratched, damaged and falling out of their sleeves.
I was so excited to buy phase two but after opening this. No, no I don't think I will.

The case is plastic, not metal. The ""locking clips"" are cheaply made plastic ""locks"". The handle leaves no room for one's fingers to be placed under, making it so one must carry the case by the handle with a dainty pinch-like gesture.

Overall, for the price, you're saving money buying this collection verses buying all or most of these individually.",1436572800,,568,4.7272727272727275

He loved it as well, but unfortunately when we opened it it was missing the CAPTAIN AMERICA movie.  My order won't let me contact the seller to try and have the movie sent over, so I'm pretty disappointed.  Especially since it was over $200. I'm hoping someone reads this and contacts me.  I'll gladly take photos.  I wish I could have contacted them sooner, but like I said, it was a fathers day gift I had Amazon wrap for me.",1435017600,,529,4.087378640776699

Movies all good quality , sound formats are up to date based on release of movie , love the Art Deco covers for the movies in this release its not just the same 6 movies thrown in a box it's all fresh and fits the context of the box set, obviously built and designed by a genuine fan for the genuine fan!",1434153600,4,924,3.8125

5125028,3,B0083SBMGW,"I love the Marvel movies. I really do. And this collection of the Phase One movies is a really cool idea. The minimalistic, art covers for each movie is beautiful. The S.H.I.E.L.D. files are really cool. And the suitcase, while plastic, is rather sturdy. Overall, this seems like a good product.
However, there are two things that bother me. First of all, the case doesn't hold all the movies without a little ""persuasion."" I don't like having to force a disc into something, and unfortunately, this case seems to be built to hold all but one of the discs.
My other qualm is the incredibly cheap Tesseract. This is nothing more than a plastic box with a blue LED inside it. You have to hit the cube to make it light up, and even then, it only flickers blue for a minute before shutting off. I've seen better light-up Tesseracts on Etsy.",1432684800,,836,4.506578947368421

The newer titles like cap, thor, avengers get the 3D treatment but who owns a 3D TV and BluRay these days? Not many I'd say it's still expensive least for me that is. I really enjoyed the suitcase but it does fell a bit cheap in quality a plastic base. The tesseract definitely doesn't look like the photos. It's enjoyable though. You should def buy this if you're all into the Marvel Universe setup. You're saving 40-80 bucks versus buying individual Blu Ray Movies.",1430697600,7,591,4.584905660377358

  The teseract is awesome too! I was so stoked when it lit up. I read about people complaining it wasn't bright enough, it seemed fine for me. Unless you were wanting it as a mantle piece it works just fine. The case is pretty visually pleasing as well with the logo outside and storage and design inside.

The bluray covers are lovely and gorgeous and it lights up! That's so cool. My cube, I noticed, does not light up when I tap it against my hand. I am going to open it and see if one of the batteries is just loose or needs new ones or if it just doesn't work at all, but I'm not too put out by it.

5125151,5,B0083SBMGW,"This is a great collector piece with some of my favorite movies included. The special features were cool, dedicated to a whole separate disk. It does not feature the special features from past released titles, so there is a bit less than if you bought all the movies separate. But then you would get the cool case and all of the special items inside, from newspaper clippings to secret files, it is filled with cool things. The case is smaller than I expected but cool none the less and the cosmic cube is not very bright. Overall it is a great piece of MCU history.",1423699200,,566,4.4

The presentation of the whole thing looks and feels so good, the case is a plastic but that didn't bother me because the look of it was really life like. After opening the case you have one thing to do take out the tesseract and let it shine yes it lights up simple things fur people who care, after that exciting moment I took out the paper work which are case files on the avenger program very nice and secret stuff which I won't give away. The disks are in very nice cardboard shelves with different and unique artwork on then. All in all this was well worth the money and the wait, great buy for any age who loves comic, geeky stuff.",1423353600,,689,4.149253731343284

I bought this because you do save $20 over buying each separately. But the case is very cheap, and the contents would only be of interest to a child (young or older). If you skip the Hulk, it comes out to the same price buying the individual Blu-Ray movies.",1423180800,,392,4.3108108108108105

The case was a dissapointment, BUT for the price getting 6 BluRays and 3 DVD BlurRays as well as the S.H.I.E.L.D. (and S.S.R.) files is totally AWESOME.#ImLovinIt",1422748800,,430,4.5

5125224,4,B0083SBMGW,"I'm a huge fan of the Marvel movie universe. Bought this set partly for the fan aspect of the cool extras, and partly to get all the first run of movies on blu-ray.  The movies are just as awesome as they have always been. Loved the special disc covers, too.

Unfortunately, the silver case and tessaract are clearly very cheap when you see them up close. The tessaract is literally just a cheap plastic cube with a light under it in the case. Not nearly as bright as pictured!

I was hugely disappointed with the extra special features disc. There were no additional features about the making of the movies or behind the scenes stuff. Just the Agent Coulson theater intros, and a couple of pre-viz or animatic scenes for each movie. I guess maybe it was unrealistic to expect LoTR-caliber special features, but still....disappointing.

TL;DR: Buy this for the movies, but if you already own them on blu-ray, none of the extras here are worth it.",1422662400,,946,4.6467065868263475
5125225,4,B0083SBMGW,"Having not owned these movies prior to this purchase, I was overall really satisfied.  The only thing that does knock the rating by one star is that the extra material for the original special releases of Iron Man and Iron Man 2 on Blu ray, did not carry over to this release.  Being the type of person that typically devours the extras on movies I enjoy, this was really a let down.

The production quality on this release is excellent though.  The case is plastic, and can seem a bit flimsy, but considering what it contains, I have to say I was not let down.  The extra hard copy folders really make you feel like you have an actual file for each hero, and definitely pays fan service to those you admire the films.

I will most likely still repurchase Iron Man and Iron Man 2 again down the line, just because I love those extras.  In the end, I love this, and would say that I am glad I purchased this.",1422489600,,907,4.238372093023256
5125226,4,B0083SBMGW,I still can't believe the deal I got on this set. I am a HUGE marvel fan so all the extra trinkets meant a lot to me. Only issue is that the terreract didn't light up on its own... I think its supposed to so I need to fix it myself. Still worth the money. Such a fun gift idea. Can't wait to see what they put out for phase 2,1422403200,,325,3.591549295774648

5125242,4,B0083SBMGW,"This box set was something that I bought as a Christmas gift for my son...let's be honest, dad wanted it too. If you haven't bought the phase one movies this would be a cool way to go, as the extras that come with it are cool little filler items (Shield top secret files on the Avengers, the Teseract (spelling?) type display. But the meat of it, is that you get the entire phase one set on blu-ray. My son loved looing at the extras, I was happy we got the movies. It was a hit.  Why four starts and not five?  Honestly, this is minor nitpicking. The box case is plastic and feels a little cheap. If you are not careful, it can even disassemble on you with the interior housing. Of course it's plastic, so I was able to pop the interior casing right back in. My biggest complaint, again this is nitpicky, is that blu rays came in sleeves, and not in a hard plastic case. Which means, if you are concerned about preserving the discs (like me) you may want to eventual spring for some cases, and just store the discs that way. However, those minor details aside, this is a great item that I would recommend for anyone wanting to get all the Phase One films.",1421884800,,1156,4.25

5125246,1,B0083SBMGW,"Buy at a price for the 6 BluRay films and expect nothing else. At sub hundred it is a decent price for 6/9 blu-ray films ( 3 additionally in 3D).  However the craftsmanship of the case and the cube are a joke. Plastic and empty--really. The ""circuitry"" cover fell out and then it is just an empty box with manufacturing plastic nibs showing. The cube didn't work for me; but it was a plastic white cube--something a toddler might have in a building block set.  Really quite a joke.  The paperwork that comes with it, dossiers on the characters are nicely done. Not that I had much interest in reading through them. But I think they put real effort in making those interesting. The discs comes in cardboard sleeves.",1421539200,3,714,4.51937984496124

5125268,4,B0083SBMGW,"As a person who loves the Marvel movies as well as any other superhero movie, I feel this item is all around about an A-.

First off, the folders that show certain information on each character is exciting for me to look at. It was neat to pick out each item from the folders from the movies.

Second, the movies themselves are absolutely outstanding and through the whole bundle of the 10 movies, you get it for a good price.

Third, the case itself is very neat and gives you a sense of excitement when it lights up as you you open it. The S.H.I.E.L.D. logo on the front is neat to help showcase as well. The inside of the case is made of plastic but does show detail of the case that the Tesseract is held in from The Avengers.

Fourth, the only reason I gave this review 4 stars instead of 5 is because the Tesseract itself isn't up to the standards a Marvel lover would expect. It is a neat thing to have showcase as a centerpiece for the case but it could be made better.

All around, I would most certainly buy this product again and do not regret it whatsoever. This product has made me excited to see what phase two will look like when it is released.",1421366400,,1160,4.183856502242152

This 2 movies are the only ones which have a 2 disc version that is not included in this edition. The others that have a 2 disc edition are for 3D versions of the film.

Also, this same set of clips can lead to pinched fingers if trying to close the case delicately. This is such a small issue it seems almost nitpicky, but mentionable none-the-less.

5125417,2,B0083SBMGW,"Overview:  I got it at the $100 price point (& am still considering whether to return or not); I'd drop to a 1 for anything >$125. Though a great idea for a set, it falls short in execution of quality & lack of digital copies.  The latter may not be a big deal to some yet, but it's the way of the future (whether those over 25 want to believe it or not).  Convenience of cloud movies (itunes/UV/etc.) matters a lot to me for travel purposes &, at this price point & attempt at consolidation, they should have included them, PERIOD.

The movies:  Hulk (3.5/5), Iron Man (4.5/5), Thor (4/5), Iron Man 2 (4/5), Captain America (3.5/5), Avengers (4/5)  ---  Given that individually, the 3D versions are mostly around $35/each, the movies alone could be considered a great deal.  Personally, I find 3D mostly gimmicky (with a few exceptions; Gravity in theater being my favorite), & wouldn't have required 3D so it's pretty fair to say that I'd have found most of these for $15-$20 (of which most INCLUDED digital copies; this set DOES NOT).  If you found 3@$15 & 3@$20, that'd be $105 (but AGAIN, that's with digital copies for most).  I'm leaning toward returning & going this route since that aspect is so important to me.

The case, 2.5/5:  it's nice but for a collectible, leaves much to be desired in the way of quality.  It's fairly cheap plastic with a similarly cheap plastic cube as the tesseract.  There are blue LEDs under the tesseract that can be lit by pushing a button on the outside of the case & light up automatically when it's opened (3 AA batteries, included).  The tesseract lights up in couple modes depending on how many times you tap it (uses 3 watch-type batteries).  The discs sit at 45 degree angles into the plastic fascade on the inside.  The files are stored in the case lid pocket (a little like a normal briefcase might have).  All cool ideas, yet cheap execution.

The extras 2/5:  the disc cases are cardboard slipcovers with unique artwork on each.  The files on each character include various trinkets that might appeal to a younger audience.  Again, though, at this pricepoint, I would expect something along the lines of a collectible.  The artwork is a nice touch but it would be preferred if the cases were a little more protective (either held the discs in place or had soft interiors, etc.).  It would be nice if the files included something more substantial for collectors (something of more quality, fun/inventiveness, clues to easter eggs, etc.).

In summary, I have really enjoyed the strategy that Marvel has executed so well; of grouping varying characters into storylines that are eventually pulled together into an Avengers movie.  It fits perfect that they'd consolidate these 'phases' into a collectible set.  Where they fall short in my view is that this set should be higher quality (i.e. more collectible) & REALLY should include digital copies.  Hopefully they resolve in the future (by including in all new releases, by hopping on the disc to digital bandwagon so their loyal customers don't feel double dipped, & even possibly by offering free digital codes to purchasers of this set (good luck...i know)).",1417392000,2,3161,4.761029411764706

5125477,4,B0083SBMGW,"I want to give it 5 stars, but I have some issues with this. The size is smaller than what I had expected it to be, but the dimensions are probably stated somewhere in the description box. I love the folders on each character and how they contain some things belonging to the superheroes. For example, within the Thor folder there is a drivers license and drawings. For captain America, there is a collectible card (just a paper card). Also his drawing of the monkey and all the attempt files he did when applying to the army. Iron man has a blur print of the arc reactor. There's much more stuff in here, so when it comes to memorabilia, this is AMAZING!!

I did have an issue with my tesseract. The cube itself did not work, so I had to unscrew it, and move the springs that are attached to the circuit board inside the cube, after that it worked well. The only this is that the springs are what makes the cube light up. In the instructions it says to put the cube on the palm of your hand and tap it twice, don't tap it...HIT IT! Slap it with your hand so that there is enough vibration for the springs inside the cube, to move.

The extras are very choice...do they still use that word anymore?  There is an interactive web side of it to that I won't spoil for you.  The bonus features and one shots are geektacular.  A must own for the total Marvelaphile.  The cube and case light up which takes it up to the nth level of the pale white virgin factor.  Well worth the price to own, but if you are a collector I pity you.

5125512,3,B0083SBMGW,"I was very disappointed in this.  For starters, the whole thing just feels flimsy.  It's a basic plastic case, and the inside is pathetic in construction.  I'd expect this from a $10 toy case, but not something I paid triple digits for.  So, that's a star right there.

I mean, with all the movies in one place, this is a good set.  And don't get me wrong, the accompanying materials are neat.

But the presentation is just killed as soon as you touch it.

The worst part is that the included ""Tessaract"" is nothing but a plastic cube.  Take off another star for dousing my plans of ruling the world.",1411430400,,600,4.381818181818182

It could have been a bit nicer - lots of solid plastic as opposed to moving pieces and whatnot - but overall it's a nice way to add Phase One to your collection.

I've bought this item even if I already have the Blu ray disks of all movies because of the tenth disk with more features, and I think that if you are a Marvel Cinematic Universe Fan you cannot miss this Item, the luggage that lights up when opened, and the Tesseract that lights up when shaken, it is awesome, but the better thing are the Shield files inside regarding the various movies.
It is definitely a great collectible especially if you had the DVDs and want to buy now the Blu ray disks.

5125543,4,B0083SBMGW,"So I got this forever ago when it came out, but seeing it on sale, I thought I'd throw in a review. If you want a quick summary, I'll say this: If you want a neat collector's piece and to have all the movies in the best formats, this is wonderful, but don't expect TOO much from the packaging. Here are the main pros and cons:

PROS:
- All the Phase 1 movies in a complete set
- Nice, sturdy case to store/display them in
- Additional 3D Blu-Ray copies of all the movies that came in the format (for those interested)
- All the extras for each movie and some exclusive box extras, like fake SHIELD documents
- Nice artwork on the Blu-Ray cases

CONS:
- The case itself feels like fairly cheap plastic and doesn't look exactly like it did in The Avengers (for reasons that ended up delaying the case's production by half a year). The latches are plastic (and very lazily made), the insides are plastic... It looks nicer than it actually is (which could be considered a plus for display purposes, I guess).
- The Tesseract in the middle glows blue, but when not illuminated it is just a white plastic cube. If you took it out and showed it to someone they would have no idea what it was, because it looks nothing like the cube does in the movie and the bottom side of it is a panel to open to replace the batteries. It just looks crappy when not lit up, and isn't all that impressive when it is.
- The handle on the case is completely unusable, unless you are a child, perhaps. There is less than an inch of space under the handle, so no adult fingers could realistically go under the handle without getting squished or possibly stuck. It is pretty much entirely for show, and you'll end up carrying this under your arm like an idiot if you want to bring it somewhere.
- The cases for each DVD are pretty, but fairly basic. They won't protect them well, and it would've been nice if they had slots for each one instead of just having two holes to lean them in.

Verdict:
If you're a huge fan of these movies and the Marvel Cinematic Universe like me, you will want to have this. Having all the movies in an official collector's case is wonderful, especially since every one of them ranges from decent to amazing. If you just want a few of these movies or expect a higher-quality display case, perhaps getting the individuals would be a better deal. I for one can't wait until they release the next collector's edition for Phase 2 after Age of Ultron, and I hope they choose a more interesting case to display them in. They screwed themselves a little with the legal battle that led to changing the case, but presumably they won't make that mistake again.",1409097600,2,2652,4.342741935483871

5125546,4,B0083SBMGW,"I have had my eye on this set for some time now and I finally purchased it when it was a deal of the day.  I know we would all like it if Marvel would have made a real metal briefcase and in a tesseract made out of crystal that looked just like the ones in the movie.  While that it not the case, the set is still pretty cool.  The look of the interior control panel and the tesseract its self isa llittle disappointing upon close examination, but all the extras in the file folders are almost screen prop quality.  There is a lot of stuff included in them and I geeked out pretty hard asI flipped though all goodies.  I have to say that some of the best stuff was in the Iron Man folder.  I am actually concurring framing the transparencies of the Mark I armor that he made in the cave.

The case is really cool, and I'm not sure why people complain about the quality or durability of it. Yes, it is plastic, but it is better than I even thought it was going to be. It looks great, and it is certainly sturdy. Everything else that is awesome comes in the collectibles. There are files on each hero, each containing things from the movies. Plus, there is a badge and access code for you. Honestly, even though the code and everything are to go take a look at phase two (which is almost over now), it was fun to go through the process to get there. All in all, if the collectible aspects matter to you and you love this series, then I can't imagine you would be disappointed with this set.

5125609,4,B0083SBMGW,"I bought this from the actual phase1avengersassembled.com website because it has it for a reduced price. After everything it was about $30 cheaper than on Amazon. Even for that discounted price, it's a lot cheaper quality than I was expecting for something that's being marketed as a collectible and even states on the box, ""NOT INTENDED FOR USE AS A TOY. THIS ITEM IS A COLLECTIBLE AND IS FOR DISPLAY PURPOSES ONLY."" Everything is made of plastic and... well... it looks like a toy. The Tesseract is supposed to be motion activated, but it won't flash unless you give it a couple of good smacks on the heel of your hand.

The case lights up when you open it, which is pretty cool, but I can't see how to turn it off without taking the batteries out. I was hoping it was switch activated, so I could display it open on a shelf and turn it on or off when I show it to people, but that's not going to happen. But even so, it comes with ten BluRay discs which alone would be worth about $150-$200, and the art on them is really nice. The S.H.I.E.L.D. files are all pretty cool to flip through as well.

I already have most of the movies, so I don't think I'm going to bother watching the included discs, so I'm not sure how the special features on these compare to those on the individual movies.

All and all, I'm a huge Avengers fan, so I think it's awesome even with it's flaws. I'm even debating on buying a second one for my mother who's also a huge fan. I'd recommend this if you're a BIG FAN or a collector of Marvel/Avengers merchandise, or if you haven't already bought all of the BluRays and want a cool case and cover art.",1399680000,,1630,4.285714285714286

The ""special"" disc, ""Avengers Initiative"" is adequate for what it is.  I truly like the personnel files that have a spot in the lid of the case.

5125627,3,B0083SBMGW,"Mildly disappointed in this.  For some reason, I was expecting something more along the lines of what they did with the Lord of the Rings boxed set - expanded versions, tons of extras on separate discs, etc.  Instead, you get Blu-Ray versions of the first 6 moves, 3 3-D discs( of Thor, Captain America and The Avengers) which I won't even watch as 3-D gives me a headache and only one disc with 'introductions by Agent Coulson', a few deleted scenes, some animatics, pre-viz, etc.  The case is pretty cool (and the little teseract is fun to fool around with) but all-in-all, I'm not sure it's worth the price, unless you held off buying the movies and waited for the box set which is pretty much what I plan to do with Phase 2.

Well done & at a fair price. I would recommend it to any comic book fan.",1393027200,,511,4.278350515463917

All the movies are there (with three of them in 3D), plus some extra secret files from SHIELD, and of course the SHIELD files - which to me is one of the best parts. There's just something a bit special with sitting there watching a movie while sitting with SHIELD's file on the case, and a clearance level 7 to boot. Not to mention having the Tesseract casually lying there.

Now, the only thing of annoyance left now is that clearance Level 7 is still not enough to get to read about what went down in Budapest....",1392422400,,622,4.362068965517241

This is the most spectacular thing you could possibly get for anyone who has a huge interest in comic books or the Marvel movies.  For a cinemaphile like myself it was heaven.  So many behind the scenes things that weren't included in the other blu-rays when i bought them.  Absolutely wonderful!  Buy it.,1391731200,,365,4.73015873015873
5125634,5,B0083SBMGW,This set is way better than I expected. The only problem is if you leave the Tesseract on to long something tries to get through from the other side and SHIELD will send you a scalding e-mail about responsibility.,1391472000,,213,4.487179487179487

5125637,5,B0083SBMGW,Very good edition. Recommended. It has an added value that is perfect ........ and the extras and the briefcase. hahaha.,1389830400,,120,5.05
5125638,5,B0083SBMGW,"NOTE: This review is for the box set only. Not any disc contents.
I have been waiting for the right time to get this set. I, purposefully, didn't purchase any of the movies on blu-ray so as to avoid duplicates when I finally did get a hold of it.
It was worth the wait. This is not the most awesome box set I've ever seen, but it's right about #2.
The first thing I noticed was its size. It's bigger than I thought. The internet pictures don't do it justice. It's about the size of a laptop and about as thick as an old phonebook. The front face of the suitcase has the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo and a button behind the handle lights it up. It's the same lights that turn on automatically when you open the case. One thing about the case... The clasps that hold it closed do not move on their own. It's basically a snap-close lid. Lift the ""clasps"" past the catch to open. Push down and snap in place to close. A little cheap, but its not terribly noticeable if you look at the set as a whole.
The inside has a spot for all the folders that are part of the ""special features"" of the set. They rest behind another shield logo and all have little bits of exclusive Avengers paraphernalia. Some of the contents include: blueprints for the arc reactor, military paperwork on Rogers, the secret drawings of the Mark I suit on several sheets of paper, a business card from Agent Coulson, reports on the Tesseract, and lots more. The ""tesseract"" that comes with the set is an opaque cube that lights up when hit; flashing blue first slowly, then faster as it's hit again. The sleeves for the discs all have the same artistic style and depict an image representing each of the six movies. There is also a bonus disc that supposedly comes with some of the features contained in the individual blu-ray releases. I'm not sure, as I have not watched this disc yet. -That is one thing that most people complain about concerning this set: No Special Features discs for any of the individual movies.- Three sleeves fit in the slot on the left of the cube, four fit in the right slot. The set is packaged with the movies in order of release; I rearranged them so they are in chronological order. Captain America, Thor, and The Avengers all have both 3D and 2D versions.
The rest of the inside of the case is rigid plastic, mostly black with, what looks like circuitry coming from the hole in middle, and on the lower left side is a cool looking number pad with, of course, non functional buttons. But it looks nice. The lights are on when the case is open and if the room is a little dark, the whole inside of the set glows a creepy blue. Take out the tesseract, hit it and put it back. Step back and enjoy the full effect of this well done box set.
Now... What will Phase 2 look like??",1389571200,2,2762,4.313461538461539
5125639,4,B0083SBMGW,"Great package!
Love the illustrations on the BR box

Too bad the case is made of plastic but it seems solid anyway.",1389312000,,115,4.2272727272727275
5125640,5,B0083SBMGW,Ordered this kinda late but it did arrive on time for Christmas. My nephew was so excited when he opened it up. He says the game is working fine and he loves playing it.,1389225600,,169,4.0
5125641,5,B0083SBMGW,It is great!!! Nicely designed.  The box is light but it is not meant to be used as a suitcase. I can't wait till we put it in our office.,1389225600,,138,3.6
5125642,4,B0083SBMGW,Amazing except the Only thing missing is a digital download for all of them and deleted scenes the 3d blue rays are a bit of a waste since most people don't have those tv's. Should have left space to add the next movies,1389052800,,219,4.116279069767442
5125643,5,B0083SBMGW,My husband loved it! He was so excited to receive this as his Christmas gift! I'll be sure to buy the next one that comes out!,1389052800,,126,3.8846153846153846
5125644,3,B0083SBMGW,You can justify the price of it all by the prices of the Bluray editions of the movies plus all the bonuses and case. The files are pretty cool and the only thing that seems really well made. The case is very hollow plastic and the latches are always one opening away from total destruction. The bluray discs on held in a thick paper sleeve that cannot be good for the discs and will eventually scratch. The special features are truly nothing special everything was online before the thing was even released. But the Cube is probably the worse thing about the set. Very weak light and underwhelming but once you get past it all it is worth the price and now that I know what to expect I am still going to buy the phase two set.,1388966400,,727,4.27536231884058
5125645,5,B0083SBMGW,"Excellent for any fans of the Marvel universe. Chock full of extras. As far as I can tell, the case is of great quality. Very fun gift  worth saving up for",1388793600,,155,4.0

5125648,5,B0083SBMGW,this is probably the best collectors edition or anything hands down. cant wait for phase 2 to be released with something like this as well,1388448000,,138,4.56
5125649,5,B0083SBMGW,There are so many intricate details to this set which makes it such a fun and interesting DVD collection. I have never seen so much detail put in; from 'newspaper clippings' to 'drivers licenses' and much much more!,1388361600,,215,4.684210526315789
5125650,5,B0083SBMGW,"it's a great boxset with a lot of exclusive stuff, like prop replicas of newspaper articles and things like that. but I wish it had the special features discs from each movie.
before getting this boxset, I had only ironman in my collection, now I have all of the first phase.
but this only has the movies (some in 3d and 2d). I just wish it also came with the special feature for each movie. I would have loved to see deleted scenes (like the alternate ironman 2 opening) and what ever else is on some of those special features discs, but oh well, that's really my only problem with it.",1388188800,,586,4.288288288288288
5125651,5,B0083SBMGW,"As my sister opened the case on Christmas day, we were both blown away at all the different things in the dossier's for each member. From Starks cave drawings of the MK1, to a page out of his fathers journal that's so detail oriented you can see faint letters where the ink ""rubbed off"" from the page next to it. Even a few of Agent Coulson's vintage Captain America cards make it into the set.

The Tesseract is removable and has its own battery to light up making it easier to display. And though made of plastic, the case it self looks great.

Even if you already own all the movies individually; I would highly recommend this set for any fan looking for a great addition to any collection.",1388016000,,693,4.364341085271318

5125656,4,B0083SBMGW,"I didn't own any of these movies before.  I absolutely loved the Avengers movie and figured I'd go ahead and get this first set of movies.  I assume Marvel will release a 2nd collection and so forth.  The price seems high, but it's not bad when you look at it a per movie cost.  The suit case and glowing cube is a bit cheesy, but for any of fan boys I'm sure it's something cool to show off.",1387411200,,392,3.9871794871794872

5125659,5,B0083SBMGW,"I was torn on selecting 4 stars or 5 for this product. Ultimately, 5 won out because I was really at 4 and 3/4 stars.
The movies have been reviewed to death. If you don't already know the scoop on them, or whether you're not sure if you'd like them, just move on.
Packaging is another story. The concept was great and I nearly plotzed when I saw this coming out... before the recall and delay. To echo others, Amazon made it right by sending the Avengers Blu-ray free. Moving on.
When I did actually get this, I was a little disappointed at how cheap it felt, beginning w/ the plastic suitcase. The extras inside are nifty but nothing that really made me congratulate myself for not spending the money more responsibly. The movies are housed in a cardboard ""case"" which does nothing to lessen the overall effect of cheapness to the collection. The art on the covers is cool though; sort of a Mike Mignola feel to the style. Then there are the dossiers and the Tesseract itself. Whoo-hoo (he said sarcastically and w/o much enthusiasm).
Despite all of this, I have no remorse for the purchase. I wanted all of the movies on blu-ray and movie extras. I wanted it all in a cool looking set (which this is, make no mistake). I love the movies and know full well that once this most recent round is over w/, culminating in the next Avengers flick, there will be another money pit of a collection coming out. And I know I'll probably buy that one too. What you have to ask is, do you want this bad enough to part w/ the cash.",1386633600,,1519,4.352112676056338

5125661,5,B0083SBMGW,"I wish the case was of better quality but that would've demanded a much higher price point.

5125662,3,B0083SBMGW,"Love these movies, and if you don't already own several, this is a decently priced bundle. The little extras are neat, too. But the packaging is horrible. This is not a 'collector' edition that you can put on display. The briefcase is a cheap hunk of plastic that I wouldn't even use as a lunchbox. Apart from looking more like a preschool toy version of the briefcase than a collector's item, It falls apart if you look at it cross-eyed. The tesseract is just an ugly cube of opaque white plastic that flashes with cheap blue LEDs when you smack it. Absolutely NOTHING like what's pictured.",1386115200,,591,4.584905660377358

5125665,5,B0083SBMGW,"I shouldn't have to even explain why this got five stars. My only complaint about this entire kit was that the special features disc was kind of janky. I really thought that they would have had more insight or mini-featurettes on how this all came together and why they chose the arcs they did for the movies. Instead it was a bunch of pre-production footage and some intros with Clark Gregg.

This thing still gets a five-star because the films, packaging, and files are incredible. The confidential folders are some of the coolest prop packing I've seen for these types of sets. It really makes it special. Just wish the bonus features were better.",1385942400,,650,4.701754385964913

5125677,3,B0083SBMGW,"the rest were pretty bad ""movies"", worth one view for the Stanley Lieber cameos and a few decent action scenes.

Iron man- thumbs up solid story stuck to the comics, character development, Greedy Jeff bridges, great suit development scenes.
captain America- thumbs up. The story stuck to comic and had scope, was character driven with a non A hole Cap, and great red skull.
Avengers- thumbs up Stuck fairly close to the origin (except for them shilling for shield) pretty long but chatty and fairly funny, had weak story and weak generic aliens, and weak dialogue but heavy action and a few memorable one liners make it worthwhile.

IM2- thumbs down. What should have been a deeper look into Stark and his russian counterpart devolved into a bad story with undercutting characters, a choppy script, weak dialogue cold war posturing and pedestrian final robot battles.
Incredible Hulk- thumbs down on this lame retread of tv show origin, with weak casting weak looking hulk, bad dialogue and an ugly tedious final battle.
Thor- thumbs down. Why is thor wearing long sleeves? lame jane, sad one line back up characters, lame story, lame cgi destroyer etc..

Without a doubt these last 3 marvel movies could have been much better in the story department, however each seems to settle for mediocre rather than movie magic. While the cast was notable in these failures, they were betrayed by the crummy script and story.",1383436800,,1415,4.912133891213389

Just so much very well thought out memorabilia in this glowing case, not to mention the glowing Tessaract.

I found this item long before It was up for sale and decided to wait for this box set rather than buying a similar box set or purchasing the movies individually. This was a very smart idea and well worth the wait! The bluray movies are only the beginning! The set comes with files containing information on each of the characters. Every item in the files instantly takes your mind back to the movie it corresponds with building the antisipation to watch the movies all over again.

5125690,4,B0083SBMGW,"So, first off, all the Marvel Phase 1 movies in one place - awesome.
For those of you who are less familiar, that's Iron Man, Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America, and The Avengers (Assemble). Plus a SHIELD extra collection.
All Blu Ray, some with blu ray 3d (haven't been able to use this personally, but don't really care about 3d - makes me sick). - Brilliant
Extra fun stuff added for the obsessive geek in me - Fantastic.
Comes with an access code to the Phase 2 trailer, but as far as I can tell, that's it.

Down sides:
Case really isn't that great. Latches are really just tabs holding it closed by luck. - Boo
Handle is too close to the case, and thus the avengers button that lights up the front, which is impressive considering I have tiny hands. - Really disappointing
The tesseract doesn't come with any instructions and I found it lights up solely because my nephew dropped it. - I was thinking it was just a waste of plastic.
This is all really disappointing because the delayed release was all because of the case.

The disks are all in cardboard sleeves, which are 1. kinda pathetic, 2. not that great of protection, and 3. if you aren't careful, could easily scratch the disks.

If given the option to buy it again or buy them individually, I probably would buy the movies individually. The price is the same if you don't count the SHIELD disk, which didn't contain the amount of extra content, nor as exciting content as they promised in the ads.",1379548800,,1479,4.470370370370371
5125691,5,B0083SBMGW,"Very few complaints about this.  The Tesseract is unfortunately just a semi-clear white plastic cube with a light inside and underneath it while its in the suitcase.  And as they have officially started Phase 2 with Iron Man 3 and have subsequently made various announcements and previews of the other movies, the 'bonus look at Iron Man 3 and Phase 2' isn't really anything special.  Otherwise though I loved it.  All 6 films look amazing and you get Cap, Thor, and Avengers in 3D as well.  Being a huge fan of the comics and the films, all the files, paperwork, ect you get made me really happy.  Lots of really cool trinkets from all the different films, and needless to say, Stark's folder is the most packed.",1379289600,,713,4.574803149606299

It also comes with a bonus disc (with one hour of content). However, this Limited Edition collection is not jam-packed with extra supplements. The cost of the set is fairly high but at $100 it would be a good deal. These are 4 star films in a 3 star collection.

Special Features:
In addition to possessing level 7 security clearance, fans will also be granted special access to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s most confidential archives, including a top-secret Bonus Disc filled with never-before-seen deleted scenes, extended scenes, featurettes and more. Also featuring exclusive memorabilia (prop reproductions and artifacts) from the motion pictures. Also includes ""And Then Shawarma After"" featurette; New deleted scenes, animatics and more from each film; Collectible packaging with memorabilia from the Marvel's Cinematic Universe; and an Exclusive inside look at Marvel's 'Iron Man 3' and other films from Phase Two of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",1378512000,,1221,5.4603174603174605
5125698,3,B0083SBMGW,"4.5 Stars for the movies; 00 for the packaging and the PRI$E - unless you do not already own any of the movies = $25-$30 each (?...).
Generally speaking, I believe Marvel has been doing a good job for us; which only added to this significant letdown.
Photo is tremendously flattering. The concept seems an easy home run.
Potential major-coolness squandered on plastic cheesy.
""Case"" is easily surpassed by a lunch box; & is not much larger than.
Some Discs slid out of cardboard sleeves, sliding around inside hollow lunchbox interior underneath the embarrassing painted ""controls"" (there are none).
""Bonus"" disc is a stretch at best.
However, the ""files"" I think are excellent. These seem to have been well thought out, cool presentation, & higher quality materials used. If this part seems worth $100+ over-pricing, recommend going for it.
If not, it is with a heavy fan-heart that an emphatic PASS is sadly recommended for this premium-priced tag-sale item (no offense to tag sales intended).

5125721,4,B0083SBMGW,"I'm a huge Avengers Fan. I am split if this is worth the money.

The Bad:
Case is plastic, Teseract is just ok. My boy loves the teseract. The buttons in the case are like the movie, but you can't push them. They are formed into the plastic mold. You get the Blu-Rays, but I think they should have given the digital copies with them. Do not buy for the Bonus Disk. It was just DVD intro's for AMC with deleted scenes.

Now with what is cool
The files are what make this cool. Prop replicas of what you see in the movie. Like the entire Captain America File from the movie with this picture and 3 trading cards. The files are a little scaled down from 8-1/2""X11"" but they can be upscaled to real size if needed with a color copier. My set included a Duplicate Black Widow Spec Sheet. I'm enlarging and framing the prop replicas for my theater room. I've not been able to find these files online anywhere.

So if you buying for the movies, skip this set. If you are buying because you love the Avengers and like the replicas, then this is for you.",1375660800,,1045,4.215

The plastic housing/case is pretty flimsy, but for what it is (maybe a show-piece at most?) I think it serves its purpose well. Certainly I'm never going to be banging it around, so I expect it to last a good long while. The DVD cases are very nice, beautiful artwork, and the ""case files"" on the Avengers have some very neat memorabilia, such as the Mark I suit schematics, Steve Rogers' draft papers and Thor's sketches of Yggdrasil. I also got far too much enjoyment out of lighting the Tesseract up and pretending to have been mind-controlled into buying it.

I mean... I'm 100% in the target audience for this thing, there's no denying it. I certainly knew I wouldn't regret it, even for the price, and I am more than pleased with what I got. I'm somewhat biased in that regard. However, if you need the ""Phase I"" Blu-Rays anyway, this seems like the way to go to buy them. I would even consider it if you just have one or two already.

I would only reconsider it if you're buying this solely for the swag, simply because I'm too poor to drop that much money on movie memorabilia.",1373846400,,1231,4.37117903930131

Six movies (three of which include an extra disc for the 3D version), one bonus disc, and buckets of actual, physical archival content truly makes it one of the coolest things you're likely to own.

It comes with every single movie from the Phase One of the Marvel Cinematic Universe; Iron man, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2 in Blu-Ray versions and Thor, Captain America and Avengers in both Blu-Ray and Blu-Ray 3D versions.

5125749,4,B0083SBMGW,"Overall, it's good. I'm reasonably happy with it. The price was a bit high for me, but I figured since I didn't own any of the included movies yet, it wasn't as big of an issue. I still do wish it included many of the features that I've seen snippets of all over youtube and heard are on other releases of the movies. May have to figure out which of the better ones are on which releases and just get those separate. =_=

The case: the concept is nice, though the quality definitely could be better. The handle could've been a tad longer. I have fairly slender fingers, but even I have to pinch the edges to hold it, otherwise I wind up hitting the button that turns on the light in the front of the case. The circuitboard is just painted, molded plastic. It serves its purpose for holding everything in place and that's kind of it.

The disk cases, while made of cardstock and thus feel a bit cheap for the price tag of the set, are nicely illustrated. I'm not sure what the issue is with other peoples disks falling out. I haven't had that problem.

The Tesseract: I have seen amateur propmakers produce better looking Tesseracts than what comes with this set. It's ok for what it is, but I'll probably go and make my own just to have a better one. What I REALLY wished it did not do was flash. Yes, the light flashes very brightly and it's actually kind of irritating. Having an option to set it to just be on, would be nice and probably much appreciated by those who have seizures triggered by flashes.

Extra content: I think this is where a chunk of the design budget must've gone (wish a little more of it could've been spent on production for the case and Tesseract, but....it is what it is I guess). Bunch of different things included like character files including collections of notes and observations, all set up to look like SHIELD property.

I think if I had seen the whole thing in person prior to purchasing this, I might've been a little less likely to pay the price for it. $90-$100 range would've been acceptable. The listed $150 is pushing it a bit for the quality. So while it's acceptable and I now have my own set of the movies, it's not really something I'm thrilled to bits over that I'd encourage everyone and their dog to get a set.

Would I recommend getting this? Yes and no.

Yes if:
-If you're one of those collectors who must have everything related to one or all these films and/or comics and/or everything Marvel.
-If you haven't acquired any of the movies yet and just want a set.
-If you want a more interesting looking movie set for display beyond a couple of boxed DVDs.
-If you're one of those who just has to have the rest of the special features out there.

No if:
-You already have some of the movies and don't care about special features.
-You really only just want the movies and the packaging and bonus material are just that, a bonus.
-If you or your kids just want the case and Tesseract to play with. It doesn't seem durable enough to be a toy and even so, it makes for a kind of expensive toy at that. Neither are worth the price for that. If you want a Tesseract, go hunt around for the Loki and Lady Loki cosplayers or propmakers who've made one that you like and commission one. There's a really stinking good chance, it'll be nicer than the one in this set.

I'll see if I can do a video later to show off the pieces....",1371772800,,3373,4.315955766192733
5125750,3,B0083SBMGW,"The contents is good. But qualities of other decorations like the cube in the center of box are not good.

The case is great, the light features look great and the Teseract looks brilliant, especially in a very dark room.
The folders are well put together, and contain enough little nods to the movies to make you feel like you're actually holding Nick Fury's briefcase.

The discs are multi region (which is GREAT) I have played a couple in my ps3 and they play just fine and prove that America really does get the best releases.

The only small complaint I would have, and this is something that I am REALLY stretching, is that the case is smaller than I had hoped, its not 1:1 scale (but then again it doesn't claim to be) so its not the biggest of deals.

All in all this special edition is awesome and well worth the price asked.

When it finally arrived, the 3D bluray disc for the Avengers didn't work, so I exchanged it--these things happen, and Amazon's exchange process was really easy to use. However, when my second copy of this product arrived, I found that the Tesseract didn't work (the batteries were corroded, but even when replaced, the little macguffin stayed broken). This is a real pity as I'm kind of tired of waiting to enjoy this overpriced toy and movie-holder. I'm probably going to just return it and stick with the regular copies of the Avengers I *already* own since this set took so darn long to come out.",1370390400,,699,4.555555555555555

5125773,1,B0083SBMGW,"As a huge fan of the Marvel Universe, I leaped at the chance to buy this item. Being that PS3 is not a region locked device (and I've bought DVD and Blu Rays from the US before!) I was under the impression that buying it from Amazon would be no different. How wrong I was. I made the mistake of waiting to move into a flat, where we planned on having a ""Phase One Night"" and watch ALL the movies in order... I put the first disc in, and nothing happened. After about 20 seconds of struggling to play, the disc ejected by itself. I thought maybe it was just the one disc, however EVERY. SINGLE. DISC. had the same reaction. And now, due to the fact that I waited, I'm two days outside my return date, and would have to pay out of my own pocket to ship it back, then only get a partial refund, which would probably wind up only just covering the very cost to actually ship the damned thing back!

Extremely disappointed that this won't play in a non-region-locked device! The movies themselves are excellent, but this is beyond stupid. How are fans from countries other than U.S and Canada supposed to enjoy the Phase One Collection?",1370217600,,1131,4.334905660377358

Yes, it is only a plastic cube that lights up, just so you know.  But for crying out loud what are you expecting?  The real Teseract?  That junk won't be metal or ceramic, it's  a toy.  If you're looking for a more authentic looking Teseract you'll be dissapointed, but even with the reviews I knew that this was going to be a plastic toy and was still very satisfied.

The artwork for the disc covers is lovely too. The Tesseract is just a plastic cube, but you have to love that the briefcase *glows* when you open it.

The only gripe I have is that they stiffed us of the extras for the Iron Man movies. The Iron Man disc does not come with all the extras that the Ultimate 2-Disc Edition had (which included Robert Downey Jr's screen test and other making-of featurettes), and the Iron Man 2 disc left out the deleted scenes and behind-the-scenes featurettes which I really wanted to watch.

5125793,5,B0083SBMGW,"After several years of avoiding lone-dvd purchases of the individual films, and having missed the cinematic release of the Avengers, this set arrived at my house to much appreciation. Since then it has been given a loving home and lives a happy life among my other collected dvds.

Fairytale aside, Phase One of Marvel's Cinematic Universe is a wonderful collection of these thoughtful, fun, engrossing films. Whilst not historically a devoted comic book fan myself, these films can be wholly enjoyed and appreciated by even the most passing casual fan of fun-filled action movies; several of which can be underestimated on merit alone.

Films aside, this set is nicely presented in a sturdy box, which is given fairly enduring fan treatment. Whilst many are right in saying that its a shame that the clips on the briefcase aren't clips per se, that bonus discs from retail-versions of iron man 1&2 are missing and that the tesseract appears cheap and tacked-on; the rest of the set holds up, with an interesting bonus 'S.H.I.E.L.D. disc, and some rather interesting character folders which do, in fact provide some interesting backstory to each of the Avengers characters, well within the extened Marvel universe. Plus, these folders often included well put-together physical 'souveniers' from each of the films, for example, original blueprints for Iron Man MK1 - all of which are given an extraordinary attention to detail, which fans will be sure to appreciate. Moreover, each film is given a pretty nifty art-inspired slipcase which are very aesthetically pleasing.

The Marvel Cinematic Universe box set is the fan-serving collection most of us have been waiting for, and while disappointment may lay therein for some, there is much to be appreciated. Not to mention that this set DOES work on my EU/UK PlayStation 3, for anybody wondering. I say bring on Phase Two!",1369440000,,1872,5.091205211726384

5125797,4,B0083SBMGW,"This has to be one of the coolest and most unique box set ideas I have ever seen. However...I was a little disappointed in that the handle of the briefcase is not big enough for a child's hand, let alone an adult. And the movies were a little light on the extras, also. If you have the two disc versions of the movies that came that way, keep them even if you buy this. The Tessaract cube, while cool, could have been done a little better.

Overall, would I buy this, even knowing what I know about it? Probably, because I am a Marvel fanboy. Just know what you are getting into before you buy it. Especially if you can see it outside of the packaging.",1369267200,,652,4.174603174603175

5125800,4,B0083SBMGW,"But honestly, unless your looking to have the case and stuff as a showpiece, it isn't worth the full price. Even then, it is somewhat lacking as a showpiece, was most notably disappointed with the model Tesseract or specifically how it looked/worked. It's all cheap plastic anyway. It looks decent until you get up close and actually look at it, and there the illusion falls apart.

Some of the included content on the extra disc was interesting, but otherwise it's the same movies that you likely already own on blu-ray.",1369094400,,521,4.788888888888889

5125802,5,B0083SBMGW,"This is a fabulous collection of the assembled Avengers DVDs.  I thought it was cool just being in the light up Iron Man briefcase, but after opening it, I discovered the detailed files that were inside.  They include what appears to be newspaper articles, drawings, redacted government files, Thor's drivers license (how cool is that?) amongst lots of other things.

I rate this collectible right alongside my limited edition Firefly Serenity's ships papers in coolness.  Well, near it anyway, because I've been getting my Firefly ships papers signed by all of the crew of the Serenity.  If I can meet some of the cast from the Avengers, I can get them to sign the files from this kit, then it will be on par with Firefly.

5125804,5,B0083SBMGW,Absolutely love the Phase One DVD set. I love how they added in the files and the tesseracts that flows when the case is opened. Well done Marvel!,1369008000,,146,4.25
5125805,5,B0083SBMGW,"Before I get started on the collectible side of this item, I wanted to briefly say that all the movies in this collection rank at least an A.

Iron Man is now a classic, marrying Robert Downey Jr. with a role that almost seemed written for him. His personality brings to life a great classic superhero in a way I didn't expect. I was never a huge Iron Man comic fan as a child, but I knew the nuances of the actual character, and Downey nails it spot on. Iron Man 2 is a good continuation of the first, and tries to evolve the character amidst great special effects and visual eye candy. Some say it suffers for being a lead in to the Avengers, however I disagree. While it does serve as a bridge for the upcoming Avengers movie, I do not think it took away from the overall story. And seeing as 3 picks up right after the Avengers movie then the Avengers can almost be considered ""Iron Man 2 1/2"", as that movie favored his character more so than the other players in the stunning ensemble cast.

The Incredible Hulk was a much much much improved version than the Ang Lee movie. This version tends to rely more on the old t.v. show starring Bill Bixby (which everyone loved) over the over the top/overly experimental version Lee put out. Unfortunately actor/studio disputes kept him from being in any future installments but the Hulk in the avengers worked for that movie (so hopefully they'll at least keep it going in that direction rather than doing reboot after reboot)

Thor is more or less what you'd expect and Natalie Portman shines as the mere mortal who helps Thor She turns a character that usually ends up being a disposable character in these type of movies into something a lot more substantial and meaningful. And the casting of Thor himself was spot on as well.

Captain America was pretty straight forward, it told the origin story rather well and where it ended up is pretty much true to the comic and brings him into modern times just in time for the Avengers.

As for the Avengers well, we all know that was a great film, the action sequences were relentless but not done in that chop-chop manner in which you don't actually see the action. Of course its' over the top, but how can you have this many superheroes in one movie and have it not be over the top? It never goes into camp though. Very well written, acted and the story well executed. Even the Hulk turned out to be a surprisingly humorous and rewarding addition to the cast (I had my misgivings about putting him in the same movie as his more human counterparts, and I was wrong to worry)

Now on to the reason most are reading this review for, the actual collector's edition. I do not understand why, in the negative reviews, everyone keeps calling this cheap or a waste of money. What were you expecting for $150? This isn't an actual movie prop. It's meant to have that cool/wow factor but there are limitations with this type of collectible. If everyone who left negative reviews got what they wanted this case would cost close to $300. And well, that's just not marketable.

Yes the case is plastic, but it's still cool. I do wish the clasps were made more like a real suitcase, but the way it is made seems like it will last for quite awhile. Usually with things like this you ""play"" with it many times in the first few days, and if you haven't seen the movies yet, you'll open it to get the discs out, but after a period of time has passed you will only open it sporadically anyway and that's to show it to others or whatever. It has a button you can push on the top to shine the light on the front of the case (avengers logo). When you open it there are nice L.E.D.s which shine their blue light on the inside cover (and again on the emblem) and another light underneath the tesseract. While, the tesseract itself may seem underwhelming it's still cool. but I do not know how they could have made this light up better or more like the movie without it being more expensive.

The movies are great, and they are housed in small folders with more artistic type art for covers. When I speak of this case, and say that it is worth the price, I am NOT including the 3d blu rays that are included (for three of the movies) as I do not use 3d yet, and even though I love movies I find the 3d movies to be more distracting than awe inspiring. And as one reviewer noted if you were to go just by the cost of the blu rays (single discs) you pay no more than $25 a piece. So when people say this set is a waste of money, I can't agree. I am not sure why Iron Man didn't include the bonus features disc (it would have been nice since three of the movies are two discs each and the other three are single discs, instead of a 3d disc I would have preferred the extras discs. But the inclusion of a bonus disc (exclusive to this set) somewhat makes up for that.

I loved the folders and how it's made to look like classified files on the main players. The inclusions of Thor's Driver's License, or Natalie Portman's work badge are nice. The fake newspaper clippings about Iron Man are great if for nothing more than the fact that it's made/aged to look like a newspaper article and on the back are other fake articles rather than a blank page or filler-type which they usually use to make the articles look great on screen but upon closer inspection you realize it's just random words. Here it's actual made up articles  that seem as if they are part of a real paper. The trading cards included with Captain America is a nice touch as well. as is the AIM business card Tony Stark received in the 3rd movie. Everything seems well thought out and authentic. There are many more little nick knacks that are included, and well I won't ruin the fun for everyone, they are great to look at and show off. So is this set worth it? Yes.

I can't imagine any fanboy/fangirl being disappointed. there is enough to keep your interest and the movies are awesome. This is a great item to have in your collection, whether you are a comic collector, movie collector or someone who just likes delving into a fictional world and being surprised at the level of detail involved.  This is a great item to have. It's for the grown up kid in all of us.",1369008000,,6204,4.338793103448276
5125806,1,B0083SBMGW,"The plastic is cheap and damaged. The cube is worthless. The blu-rays those selves fell right out of there cardboard sleeves as soon as I picked them up. Some of them where already out and in the bottom of the case. They were so scratched that the Hulk didn't play and the other disk skipped. I can just picture them sliding all over the place during shipment. Just buy the movies individually unless you really want to pay an extra 50 dollars to buy this so you can have the extra paper material it comes with. Your also paying more but getting less because the digital DVD version is not included. Also if you buy them separately you will get the Iron Man 1, and Iron Man two special features. Iron Man and Iron Man 2 do not come with the special features in this boxed set that the individual copies come with.",1368748800,4,813,4.3202614379084965

One  would of thought they wouldn't of packed up the tesarac cube with the batteries in it. When I opened it the batteries had corroded(probably a result of being in storage for a year).thankfully it didn't leak into the actual cube, got new batteries and it works. Can not  say the same for my brother who purchased it and had the same corrosion. It did leak and the cube does not light up.",1368748800,,549,4.320388349514563
5125809,5,B0083SBMGW,"It's just awesome! Just getting this many blu rays for the price is worth it, but it's the little geeky bits that are in these S.H.I.E.D. folders that will make your comic book movie loving heart sing! @o@",1368662400,,205,4.421052631578948
5125810,5,B0083SBMGW,"Like most Marvel fans, I couldn't wait until this came out. Finally in April, it was ready and available (and a perfect birthday present for myself too). A little skeptical that according to this page, it stated that it was Region A. I'm from Australia, which makes me Region B, and guess what? It works also for this region.

Shipping came earlier than estimated which is more of a bonus. The briefcase is gorgeous and a collectors item. The slips that the discs come in have some fantastic artwork. The files of each character was fun to go through, especially knowing that each item in there was a part of the film. It felt like you were holding parts of the prop of the film in your own very hands.

Being from out of the States, I could not get into the website that the paperwork tells you to go (i'm guessing for more extra data) but it was pretty cool that they allow this for U.S fans.

Strongly urge all Marvel fans to purchase a piece of history right here.",1368489600,,968,4.337016574585635

5125815,2,B0083SBMGW,"I guess this is the most deceptive object I bought on Amazon.
As a huge comics fan, I did not hesitate a second when I saw that Marvel would release a replica of the Teseract briefcase and ordered it as soon as I could.
The first version announced was metallic, totally identical to the one we see in the movie.
But what I received, made from poor plastic, is a pale copy of what was originally promised.
Even the tesseract is a piece of plastic blinking with a light that can be seen only in a totaly dark room.
I really regret my buying and only keep it for the nice Blue Ray presentation and the rest of the documents provided, but the price asked for this is about twice what it should cost.",1368489600,,695,4.1940298507462686
5125816,1,B0083SBMGW,"Writing this review for the package. Felt that this package should cost $29.90, cheap plastic materials inside the case. The Tesseract cube is made of cheap white plastic, for $149.90, I expect more than that. The picture, though for reference, shows a prism cube. The cube, that's inside, don't even look like a Tesseract. I let the pictures do the talking. Can we sue for misleading product description? For $149.90, I really feel cheated.",1368489600,7,441,4.972972972972973
5125817,5,B0083SBMGW,"This is a fun item to have for anyone that loved all the movies leading up to the Avengers if you did not have the movies in Blu-ray(which I didn't).Great packaging, nice movie related items, newspaper clippings, photos, files. The only problem I had with it was that the packaging says preview of Iron Man 3 and Phase two of the Marvel Universe so you think its' on a disc but it's not. The package comes with a code which you have to put at a website that gives you the preview,so it's a bit misleading. I was lucky enough to get it for the original price because I had pre-ordered it on Amazon  so that was great,but if in three years they do a similar item for phase 2 of the Marvel Universe for what they're charging currently for Phase One I don't think I'll be picking it up cause now I'm picking up the movies in Blu-ray and if its the same movie I already have there won't be any point in picking it up.",1368403200,,912,4.1525423728813555
5125818,3,B0083SBMGW,"I'm pleased to have this, but can't help but be slightly disappointed by the quality of the packaging. As others have pointed out, it does have rather a cheap feel to it, especially taking into consideration the cost.

I can overlook this, because it's great to have these films housed together in what is still a smart looking collection.

What I can't overlook, however, is the substantial damage to the cardboard sleeves that the poor housing has caused during shipping. I'd send it back, but it'll just happen again. It really does take the gloss off the purchase.",1368403200,,568,4.785714285714286

5125823,5,B0083SBMGW,"I must admit, I was pretty pissed when this disc set got pushed from its original release last year to April of this year. I honestly feel like it was a cash grab on Marvel's part, as most people (myself included) probably bought The Avengers Blu-Ray but were holding out for this complete set.

Griping aside, the presentation is hard to match or beat, the order arrived extremely fast and in great condition. As a life long comic book and movie fan, this is truly one of the best Blu Ray sets ever released. Additional art, the S.H.I.E.L.D. briefcase and Tesseract, the replicated movie props, this thing knows its target audience well. A great starting off point if you don't own any of the films, but also a great collecter's set if you're into that sort of thing.",1368057600,,768,4.565217391304348

Also, the only thing holding the dossiers together was super cheap plastic.

5125835,4,B0083SBMGW,This is definitely a great set for the first round of Avengers films. My only real issue with it was that the set did not include Disc 2 for both Iron Man and Iron Man 2 (which had extra features on a second blu-ray disc). That is the only thing that doesn't make this a definitive set... I never bought any of them on blu-ray so this was a great purchase for me.

5125838,4,B0083SBMGW,"This set is great, but even with something this amazing, I can only give it four stars. Why? The key feature here is naturally the movies, which are great if you don't already have physical copies in Bluray, as you also get some 3D movies. Nothing wrong there, but the lack of DVD or digital copies was a shame. The Tesseract is really cool at night when it lights up, but is insanely cheap. It's basically just a plastic square with cheap LEDs in it. The key feature is the collectors gear, which is SO AWESOME. Recreations of movie props and info that is super cool for Marvel fans of all ages, this stuff is worth the price of admission alone. The only real complain I have is the delay and stuff we were given because of the delay. We should have been able to obtain this set back in September 2012, but instead has to wait until April. The bonus unlock able video included to ""make-up"" for this is nice, but unfortunately dated, as it is not physical, and will be dated after all of the Phase Two movies come out. Better than nothing though. Overall, great purchase, but I feel maybe it deserves four stars rather than five. Still a must have for Marvel fans.",1367798400,,1164,4.368663594470046

Plus you get all the movies including the Hulk!",1367798400,,364,4.367647058823529
5125842,3,B0083SBMGW,"I guess it would be better to release something else rather than the brief-case, it doesn't look of quality, what I really loved was the details on the archives of each avenger, the pictures, drawings, etc.",1367798400,,206,4.75
5125843,3,B0083SBMGW,"Was a bit depressed at the lack of quality of the plastic case itself, but is cool to have all the movies leading up the the Avengers all in one collectible case.",1367798400,,162,4.09375
5125844,5,B0083SBMGW,"Well, there is high, about this collection and in my opinion, VERY high.
And there is low that could be VERY low for some people.

About the movies I will not say a word, for you to buy this collection you have to at least have watched ONE of the movies.
I REALLY miss in this box Ang Lee's The Hulk, wich in my opinion is underestimated. But I agree that NOTHING so far can compete with Avengers and the firt Iron Man.

Talking about the collection: the suitcase is nice but as a suitcase, has a handle to little (is hard to carry the suitcase as one) and the locks are just ""printed"" on the plastic. Much different than Blade Runner's suitcase if you have seen it closely. The Marvel suitcase has a button that ignites its lights and the Tesseract is tap-activated. Inside, it resembles a toy, with the circuits also ""printed"". They don't light and are merely painted. Not much what I expected as well as the Tesseract replica: just a flashing white cube. And that is the low side.

On the high side, all the S.H.I.E.L.D. material that comes along is PERFECT. You got to have all the profiles, blue-prints, schematics, cards, drawings, photos, in fact, all the Confidential Files by Shield in the ""dossier"". Things that actually, you will see (have seen) on the screen. Gives a sense o reality to all that world that Marvel created. The Stark Industries ARK reactor blue-prints, for egg. Plus, you get a promo code to exclusive content on the internet. So nicely done that you feel like accessing some really exclusive and ""secret"" stuff.

About the discs: all of them come with new cover art, wonderfully made. And the disc extras are ok. Not as complete as one would expect but not plain discs as sometimes we get.

Overall I say it's a must have for all Marvel fans. Paraphrasing Stan Lee, Excelsior!",1367798400,,1805,4.541538461538462
5125845,5,B0083SBMGW,"I love it. As I looked in each file I giggled like a kid in a candy store. I've been an Avengers fan since the late seventies, so this ""gift set"" is like being in Marvel heaven.",1367798400,,177,3.810810810810811

The case itself is plastic which lets it down a bit, a metal attache case like the Inception collectors edition would have been great. It does light up beautifully though and the Tesseract is a white plastic cube. When you tap it against your palm it pulsates, tap it some more and you get a mini disco cube. You also get all the bluray extras for all the Marvel films so far, barring Ironman 3 obviously.

What with the problems they had with the case manufacturer from the film, we are lucky this even got made. It's a great edition for any Avengers fan if you can see past the plasticness of it all. And to be honest, it looks absolutely awesome regardless.",1367452800,,724,4.323529411764706

My 'cube' doesn't even work, I'll have to open it up and figure out if it's broken or what.  The dossier is kinda cool, lots of interesting stuff, someone did a good job on putting that together, but the overall design is weak.  The discs themselves are in cardboard sleeves open on one end and stored AT AN ANGLE into the base of the case.  Guess which part of the sleeve faces down?  If you said, THE OPEN PART, you would be correct.  Good luck if the disc slides out while you are removing them and you have to fish it out of the base of the case (in a box, with a fox).  The discs are the part you really bought this for -- right?  They certainly deserve a better thought out storage setup than this.  Finally, there's a button for the light under the tiny handle, so you can carry the case with the light on, or you can carry the case with the light on.

It looks cheap and feels cheap. The whole thing is made of crappy plastic, like a kids' toy. Honestly, even kids' toys nowadays are better looking. Every single aspect seems to have been designed to be manufactured at minimum cost. The discs come in cardboard sleeves (in other boxed sets, people have complained about such sleeves scratching the discs - mine weren't, but maybe I was lucky), and some of them came loose and fell out as I opened the package. The graphic design of the sleeves are nice, but couldn't they have invested just a bit more in a package that might actually open up and hold the discs firmly without scratching them?

I wish there was a boxed set that had just the discs, without all the cheap ""collectible"" junk. I'd be perfectly happy with that, and it would probably take up less space, too.",1366934400,5,913,4.493975903614458

The BluRays come in a cheap cardboard sleeve.  Nothing special with them, they are what you got when you bought the individual BluRay.  It would have been nice to get the digital codes for the movies.

5125949,4,B0083SBMGW,"I have been a Marvel comics fan in the UK since the 70's and am a movie prop collector so I ordered this as soon as it first became available as this seemed to be a great looking collectible. Even after the Rimowa fiasco I retained my order and received the set on Monday of this week.

Firstly, the movies are all great and if you are reading this I guess you already know that so I will mainly review the set. However for the avoidance of doubt and for non-US buyers I will also confirm that these discs are region free. I must also say that the content of the special Shield archives disc is quite frankly pathetic. I saw an Avengers special on Sky TV when the movie was released which had more content so this is truly disappointing and Disney/Marvel should have done better for this release.

One piece of information missing from every other review I have read are the dimensions of the case, which are 12"" by 10"" by 5"" (about the size of an SLR camera case) so this is in no way a full size replica of the case see in the movies. This is however presented very well and made of hard plastic, and from a distance it does look like an aluminium case. The case contains several ""Shield Archive"" folders and these contain a number of nice little prop replicas such as Thor's fake driving licence, the Arc reactor blueprint seen in Ironman 2, a Pingo Doce label so you can make a replica of the drinks bottles in the Incredible Hulk (if you wish) and the Tesseract files shown to Steve Rogers at the beginning of The Avengers. Unfortunately because of the size of the case these folders are also not regular size which diminishes their appeal as collectibles slightly, but these again are well presented. The case also illuminates nicely with blue leds when opened and the shield logo illuminates when the Avengers button on the outside of the case is pressed.

The case contains a Tesseract replica which has received mixed reviews. Firstly ignore the promotional pictures as these are CGI versions of the cube. The actual cube is white plastic which illuminates when you tap it quite hard on your palm with blue leds in a kind of strobe effect. This effect I believe is pretty good given the limitations of cost and current technology but this cube could have been enhanced one thousand percent with little or no additional cost by just having it made of opaque or frosted plastic rather than solid white. This is one of the reasons this only gets 4 stars instead of 5.

Another is the size of the case itself. This arrived in a box 3"" longer, 1 "" wider and "" deeper than the case itself. If the case had been made just this little bit larger it would have been a much more impressive collectible and held a higher premium than this scaled version. Finally, a small but incredibly annoying feature is the size of the handle on the case. As I said this case is about the size of an SLR camera case so why is the handle so shallow that it is impossible to put your fingers through it to hold it. Instead you have to pinch the handle on each side to lift it or not use the handle at all. Now I know this is a collectible box set and not a functional piece of luggage but if the handle hinges had just been raised "" each side (and there is space for this) it would have been possible to actually use the handle and this actually would have balanced the case better that it currently is for transport. I can only conclude that whoever designed this aspect of the case was a complete idiot.

All in all this is a good attempt at a collectible box set that could have been great but failed due to a lack of attention to detail. Given the delays in bringing this out and the fact this had to be redesigned anyway, these little issues should have been addressed. For the collector, this is probably worth the Amazon price of $149.49, but is not worth the premium some sellers (in the UK and on eBay) are asking.

5125952,1,B0083SBMGW,"The Blu-Ray collection is amazing (even if there's nothing really new on this discs that wasn't already available) as are all the supplementary materials (even if the ""Tesseract"" is a bit underwhelming), but this was shipped to me in the UK without ANY form of packaging. Amazon simply slapped an address label on the box the plastic briefcase comes in and sent it on its way. I was lucky the briefcase arrived in one piece. Its container was rather tatty though and couldn't be kept anyway as it was covered in address labels and customs forms. So much for keeping the set ""mint in box"". UPDATE: Just spotted a huge crack in the side of the plastic briefcase - not happy, Amazon, not happy.",1366588800,6,691,4.580645161290323
5125953,5,B0083SBMGW,"This is one of the best box sets I have purchased. The art work on the disc sleeves are fantastic and have an art deco/noir feel. The additional ""files"" are filled with bios of some characters from the Marvel Universe. The case itself lights up with a blue hue accenting the SHIELD logo on the front of the case. When opened it features a replica of the Tesseract. The Tesseract will light up on its own, but it requires a hard jolt or smack to get it to flash. The inside of the case looks like the one used in the movie. If you're looking for ""movie quality"" you may be disappointed, but this is easily on par with any other limited edition sets I have purchased. There are 7 total collections included:

Avengers - Bluray & 3D Bluray
Thor - Bluray & 3D Bluray
Captain America - Bluray & 3D Bluray
Iron Man - Bluray
Iron Man 2 - Bluray
Incredible Hulk - Bluray
S.H.I.E.L.D. Avengers Initiative bonus disc

Overall I think this is a great buy, especially if you don't already own any of the movies. You may read reviews where people are upset that the product is plastic or not durable. Keep in mind, this isn't designed to be thrown around or used as luggage, it is a collectible and is designed as such. Keep those things in mind and I promise you won't be disappointed.",1366502400,,1273,4.322175732217573

5125955,4,B0083SBMGW,"Upon reading all the negative reviews on Amazon, I was a bit reluctant in ordering the collector's box set.  But I went with it because I am a big fan of Marvel and all the Phase One Avengers movies are good.  It finally arrived on my doorstep in about five days.  I inspected the plastic briefcase for defects and I did not understand why so many people complained about it.  It looks very nice!!  There is cheap plastic and there is nice plastic.  This definitely falls in the latter category.  Everything lights up, even the Tesseract, which many complained.  Yes, you have to tap it quite hard but it does work.

The blu rays are protected by paper slipcase.  The art works are beautiful and nicely done.  Audio and visual wise, all the movies are stunningly presented in 1080 HD and DTS-HD.  Iron Man is the only disc which the audio is weaker than the rest of the pack.  (This is also the problem in the DVD version)  Much props to Marvel.  Nicely done, glad I waited for the box set to come out.  Can't wait for Phase Two!!

*4/22/13* Pulled a Phase One Marathon this weekend, just want to say a few words about all movies.  Iron Man was always my favorite.  Hulk was underrated but just hard to relate to a Green CGI guy but the effort was there.  Iron Man 2 was a bit weaker, I don't understand why they didn't re-sign Terrance Howard for Rhody.  I'm just not feeling Don Cheadle.  I watched Thor at the theater and I have to say I enjoyed it much more the second time around.  I always was wary of Captain America (because of the shield and costume) but the film was great.  I love the WWII period and the director was very good at presenting that golden era.  Nothing more to say about Avengers... that good, the new Hulk was way better than Edward Norton.  Disappointed at the S.H.I.E.L.D. disc, which is nothing more than a collection of theater intros.  I wished Marvel would put more featurettes on the Avengers.",1366416000,,1927,4.415954415954416
5125956,3,B0083SBMGW,"I received this as a gift for my birthday and I've had to return it because it was missing pieces... Twice.

The first time it was missing the disc for Iron Man 2. Hey, mistakes happen right? I was just unlucky enough to end up with a bad set. So we sent it back and Amazon sent us a new one. This time, the set was missing a black envelope marked ""confidential"" as seen here [...]

I am currently waiting for my third set to arrive so I can combine any missing pieces, cause at this point I'm not expecting everything to be there with such horrible quality control. Here is a link to what I could find to be the most complete kit I've seen. [...] Hopefully your set isn't missing anything.

Other notes, the ""tesseract"" is a solid white, cheap plastic cube that if you smack, should light up. It looks awful, feels awful, and to top it all off, the set includes a hi-rez picture of the prop from the movie, so you can see how cheap they went for this movie set.

The case itself is cheap plastic with a handle I can't get my fingers through, the ""keypad"" inside doesn't have buttons that actually press and the overall set is pretty disappointing, but I may be more upset than most since I've had to return it twice already.

Edit: I have received my latest replacement and everything is included now. I upgraded my 2-star review to a 3-star as I really may have been just a very unlucky person in this regard. The case is still a very cool way to encase to movies, the artwork is neat on the cardboard sleeves, and I am just a complete sucker for things that light up. I still feel they could have done better with this set, but you are still getting all six great films fr om this Marvel era, which is what I wanted all along.",1366329600,6,1729,4.211480362537764
5125957,4,B0083SBMGW,"I have no complaints about the set in general. I have been waiting for this set since the 2012 summer pre-order and it was worth the wait.

The case looks like brushed aluminum but it is plastic. Still, it is durable enough for a blu-ray collectors set. It's not like I plan on taking the luggage on vacation or anything. The movies, cube and files all fit in very neatly.

The customized collectors art on the blu-ray covers are very high quality and quite beautiful and artistic. I love them.

My only complaint is the Tesseract cube. I have no problem with the fact that it's plastic, my problem is the fact that it doesn't light up for me. Maybe I need to replace the battery or something else is wrong with it, but I don't know. I have smacked it firmly like the instructions say to do, but to no avail. The non-working cube is the only reason I have given this set 4 instead of 5 stars.

I love the set and hope that I can get the cube working soon.",1366329600,,955,4.202185792349726
5125958,5,B0083SBMGW,"Despite having to pay an extra 30 customs fee, this has definitely proven well worth the money. Up until now I didn't own all of the Marvel movies, but to have them all at my disposal is bliss. As is having all the extras (both on screen and on paper), this kind of thing is a must for a movie geek like myself. The packaging itself doesn't disappoint. The briefcase design is well made and looks like it'll stand up to a couple of knocks here and there, whilst on the inside (which lights up automatically when opened) it's detailed and well presented. Changing batteries won't be a half hour job either with the casing simply lifting out. The Tesseract cube is nifty, not the most beautiful thing ever but when activated one of either two ways definitely has an impact. The artwork for the disc sleeves is very attractive.

All in all, well worth it. My only complaint is the extra bits Marvel added in as compensation for the delay, which are the previews for Phase Two and Iron Man 3. Marvel fans across the world deserve to see this stuff, so don't shaft them like that.",1366243200,,1075,4.429292929292929

It's a novelty item, let's not kid ourselves into thinking this is some kind of heirloom that generations from now will be cherished for anything more than nostalgia. With that said, I love it to pieces. If you're an Avengers/Comic Book/Superhero fan this set is for you. I think the price/value is on par. Would I have paid more for a metal case with ""premium"" parts... maybe. But I'm not upset I paid $150 for this (especially since I didn't have most of the movies in the set).

Yes the tesseract is super cheesy, a cheap, white, plastic cube that doesn't stay lit and instead only blinks. I will be ordering a hand made tesseract from Etsy of way better quality to replace it. The content makes up for everything else though. As a die-hard fan-girl of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I was tickled to find all of the wonderful odds and ends within the various S.H.E.I.L.D. folders.

I think Disney/Marvel should have thought better about this.",1365638400,,319,4.0
5125989,2,B0083SBMGW,"I ordered this way back in September 2012 and was actually pretty excited about it. What followed however is a case study of how not to do it - and that goes for Marvel as much as Amazon.

Since everyone's taste is different I won't discuss the movies here. Especially considering that since you're looking at this box set, you already have more than a fleeting interest in Marvel's cinematic universe.

What I would like to point out however is the quality of the box set itself as well as the way Amazon shipped the item to me. For those with little time, let me make it short: BOTH RANK AS THE WORST EXPERIENCES FOR A PRODUCT OR SHIPPING RESPECTIVELY!

In more detail:
The briefcase feels cheaply made and the plastics appears rather flimsy. It has no hinges, so when you open it, it lies flat on your table. The latches are not even real latches but simply pieces of plastic that you pull up a few millimetres to open the briefcase.
Once open, the blue light comes on. Unfortunately the insides look even cheaper than the outside. There is a thin sheet of plastic made to look like a control board with horrible fake buttons on the right and a slot on each side for the discs.
In the middle is the 'Tesseract' or as I'd like to call it, the 'cube of shame'!
Like others have already mentioned, it would look cheap in a $1 thrift store. I don't know what Marvel where thinking, but either this is some very clever in-joke I am not getting or they just don't care one bit about the fans that have waited way over 6 months for this and paid over $140.
The cube just looks so shockingly cheap, even considering the rest of the package, that it is hard to imagine. I will actually bring it into the office tomorrow to make a point to my colleagues about how bad it actually is.
But yes, smack it hard enough - and I mean 'Hulk smash!' hard - and it does light up. But all it does is flash with a blue light. To quote John Rambo: ""It turns blue.""
The covers for the discs however are quite nice as are the dossiers and background files but that only makes the rest of the case look even worse. This would not even qualify as a cheap toy!

Now for the shipping part:
Amazon US decided not to put this item in a box but rather just stick the shipping labels right on the back of the actual cardboard box holding the briefcase and send it on its merry way. We are talking about a $140 collector's item, something that people buy to put on a shelf and display in their living room or home cinema - WHAT ON EARTH WERE THEY THINKING???
Are the margins so slim that they have to save money on packaging? Should we start a collection for Amazon, so that they can buy more boxes?

What I have now is a pretty dinged up box, inside is a dirt cheap briefcase and some of the films don't even have all the features from the previously released 2-disc editions (like Iron-Man 2 for example) and of course one massive case of buyer's remorse.

I won't go through the hassle of returning this item to Amazon US from Canada but I am kicking myself for not cancelling my US order (it was not available in Canada at the time). But on the other hand, it will save me money in the long run since I won't be buying anything from Amazon US anymore or any future Marvel box sets - well done both!

O stars for the briefcase and the shipping, 4-5 stars for the movies - 2 stars in total. Great films let down by a cash grab collector's item and the most unprofessional shipping I've ever encountered.",1365552000,10,3474,4.254545454545455
5125990,3,B0083SBMGW,"If you don't have the blurays included in this buy, if you already have some or most just pass on this. The only interesting thing about this package was the cover art on the sleeves. The blurays themselves just looks like they were pulled out of the normal cases and shoved in here. Even though this has been planned for a long time it really looks like it was put together in a hurry. Although several people have complained about the outside case, i have no problem with this, but the plastic on the inside is just awful. And the cube... i was rather upset at the lack of detail, i was expecting to have some basic designs on it but there were none. It is a plain white cube that doesnt even fit right in the space provided. I would really like to see disneys profit margin on this. Even at the lower price here they have to be profiting $100+ on this.",1365552000,,855,4.219512195121951

5125992,2,B0083SBMGW,"Sadly, I ordered before the reviews came in based on the product image. Unfortunately, the promo images never changed to reflect the current build quality (or rather lack thereof.) Most of the folks have said it already, the case is cheap plastic, the cube is a cheap opaque cube that you have to strike pretty hard to turn it on, and the discs are lacking protection because of the cardboard sleeves and the slots the sleeves sit in. If the disc is facing the wrong way (like mine were upon arrival) the discs slide out and get to have a play day with the internals of the case. I was actually afraid of breaking the little plastic clips that keep the case shut when opening it the first time.

Very disappointed with Marvel and with Amazon for misrepresenting their product. It's being sent back so I can get proper versions of the movies with proper cases for less wasted cash.",1365465600,5,880,4.5

5125994,5,B0083SBMGW,"I think I nearly fainted with excitement when my brother called to tell me this had arrived while I was in school, and I was really eager to get home to open it up. It definitely did not disappoint!

You get the blu-rays for the 6 movies, + the bonus disc for SHIELD Initiative. The design for the disc covers are so pretty! I can't wait to do a marathon as soon as my current uni semester is over. I really liked the extra files as well; had a great time reading through all of them. (My favourite was Thor's fake Donald Blake license; he looks so cute in it)

As for the box, it definitely isn't something you'd use to carry heavy things around (not that I intended to use it for that). It's extremely light (I was so surprised when I picked it up), and it'd look great on display as a collector's item. A must-buy for a fan of the movies!",1365465600,2,841,4.121951219512195
5125995,5,B0083SBMGW,"This is an awesome case. It's clear alot of thought went into this design. It looks awesome. Also within are file folders containing papers and clippings on the majors heroes on the Avengers (anyone for vintage Captain America trading cards?). Plenty of goodies to thrill your average comic book geek.

Some people have complained that the plastic is cheap and that box could have been made better and less cheap. They are not wrong. The Teseract is just a white cube with a blue light under it. But to me these are minor complaints. Yes the box could have been made stronger, but it looks awesome.

If you're a minor fan of these movies, probably better to stick to the individual blu-rays (cheaper and just as effective). But if you are a big fan of these movies or of the characters in general, then this is the set for you!",1365379200,3,827,4.506666666666667

5126050,4,B0083SBMGW,"Let me start off by saying I love this set!  All six movies with the 3D versions too...WOW!  I love the way the case lights up when you open it.  I was drooling when I open the cases files, learn more about the charters, and got to use the decoder to find a secret message.  I felt like a kid again.  I love the way Disney is doing this series.  I get to see some of my favorite supper hero's in action both as a team and as a solo act.  And with this set, you can see it all.  If you are a big super hero fan as I am, buy this set.

You may ask with the above glowing review, ""Why only 4 stars""?  It's simple really, while I like the case I think it should be made of metal not plastic.  It also took me a minute to figure out how to open it without braking it; however, once you see how it opens, it really simple to open.  I think they should offer one in metal and one in plastic.  Some of us would have paid extra for the metal case.  I also think they could have given us some more extras in this set.

Bottom line: Buy the set; it's a great one to have in your collection!",1365292800,,1079,3.7757847533632285

5126052,2,B0083SBMGW,"First off I was not expecting this to be a perfect piece of work but I also wasn't expecting such poor craftsmanship. Pieces like the clips to hold it closed and the hinges will all eventually break from wear and most likely even the two main pieces that ""hold"" everything. The disc sleeves though I love the artwork are complete crap I could make a better case by folding a piece of paper, the discs fall out constantly. Personally I'm not one who loves his bonus material discs but this set is definitely lacking that. And now for the biggest disappointment the Tesseract. I had really hoped this would be something more of an acrylic material(like those LED ice cubes) but it far off this is more like plastic fork material. Not only was the material a disappointment but the poor design which causes it not to work is laughable. The reason it called ""interactive"" is because vibrations are suppose to cause a set of springs to touch some contact plates but the poor craftsmanship of this doesn't even allow them to come close( maybe an earthquake might work).  And if they ever redo this set I hope we all get to do a free trade in.",1365292800,,1136,4.48792270531401
5126053,4,B0083SBMGW,"I've been waiting for this set to come out and finally it did. I gave this set 4 stars because noting is really a 5 star. I really don't know why people are complaining about this set. So what if its a hard plastic case and cube. For the price, its well worth it. If they would of came out with a metal case it would of cost alot more and people would be complaining about that too. Some people want stuff for nothing. If your a real collector, you'll enjoy this. The case, the cube, the extra files, and the blu rays of all the films, it's perfect. When my wife order it for me, I was worried that it was a waste of money because of the bad reviews. But once I got mine, I'm very happy with it. If your expecting some real metal case and cube, then don't waste your money. But if you want a real nice cool replica(thats what it is), then this is perfect for the person who collects stuff, for your teenager or husband.",1365292800,,919,4.054945054945055
5126054,3,B0083SBMGW,"Like most everyone else who purchased this product, I have been waiting for this since they first announced it and it was set to be released in September.  I already own the Blu Ray editions of Iron Man 2, Thor, and Captain America.  I also had Iron Man and Incredible Hulk but only on DVD.  I held out getting any version of The Avengers as I knew I was going to purchase this set.  For me, it was worth it to get this collection for the packaging and copies of Iron Man, Incredible Hulk, and The Avengers on Blu Ray.  And I guess, if you were only looking to get Blu Ray copies of each movie then this is probably the set for you price wise.  That said, I have some issues with this collection.

The first and biggest issue for me is that the discs for each film are just the original discs from the first release of each movie.  I would have at least liked to have seen them re-labeled to be able to discern these discs from the ones I already own.  If you need an example see the LOST collection which is substantially better.

The second issue is the case itself.  It has a very plastic toy look and feel to it.  It would have been nice if a little extra detail went into the materials.  Some things that may have helped would be glass instead of smoky plastic for the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo.  Actual buttons instead of hard plastic on the key pad would have been a nice touch as well.  And if they actually did something that would be pretty fantastic.  I have to say, that single adjustment alone would have garnered five stars from me.  The blue LED light for the case is also underwhelming.

The third issue which I have seen mentioned now in several reviews is ""The Tesseract"" cube.  I pulled the plastic tab off the bottom and shook it with no result.  After several earnest attempts to activate it I grabbed a screwdriver and opened up the bottom.  The spring that is suppose to activate the system by touching the contact for the battery is very stiff and does not extend as it should when it is shaken.  My brother and I currently have the whole thing disassembled and are attempting to rig it to function properly.  Obviously, that should not be necessary for a brand new product.  The designers might have been better off if they just put a button in there to turn it on and off.

The positives to this set are the materials in the dossiers.  They are pretty neat and I appreciate the detail that went into those.  I also really like the packaging art for the discs themselves.  I haven't noticed too many scratches on the discs either.

All in all these are great films and I wish the collection that accompanied them was on par with their quality.  Let's hope Marvel does not make the same mistake for Phase 2.",1365292800,2,2723,4.324110671936759

Now it is only for those really into the marvel universe and the reason it gets a 4 star and not a 5 was the tesseract. I wanted the whole set just for the tesseract it looks great in the photos for buying but once you get it its a plain white cube not translucent that when you smack it flashes blue was a big let down but still have to recommend any fans out there that are hardcore and want all the extras you can think of grab the set or those that want an idea how big this universe is getting if nothing else still remarkable deal on the blue rays",1365206400,,934,3.947089947089947

It is probably the stupidest thing I've ever seen in my life and how the makers of this set could ever think that was remotely close to the actually thing is beyond me.

5126094,5,B0083SBMGW,"I'm not sure where all of the naysaying is coming from.  The fact is....this is a highly imaginative presentation of these movies, and when I picked it up from the post office this morning, it was more than I'd hoped for.  Consider it this way: The current Amazon price ($150) divided equally between the six movies values each movie at $25, hardly unreasonable for Blu-Ray, and especially considering three of them feature 3-D versions as well.  (I paid the $140 pre-sale price back in August, valuing the movies at $23 each from my own pocket).  That essentially makes absolutely everything else included entirely free:

1) The suitcase.  I honestly cannot fathom what people are referring to when they are reviewing this as being cheaply made.  It is more realistic than I would have expected, and the artificial circuitry inside it achieves maximum ""cool factor.""  The repeated complaints that the discs are hard to remove is laughable.  I'd barely opened the case when my 3-year-old daughter pulled Thor smoothly and effortlessly out.  And as for the clips and hinges being weak and fragile?  Again, it's been opened and closed several times today with no threat to their survival.

2)  The Tesseract.  I know there have been complaints about some of these not working, but I suspect that has less to do with the fact that it wasn't lighting up the way people expected and more to do with the fact that it doesn't give them magical powers.  These are the same unrealistic people who were expecting the briefcase to be metal.  Come on, people.  The fact is, even without the rapid-pulsing glow, just the constant glow underneath that lights up the whole inner parts of the briefcase (including the Tesseract) as well as the icon on the outside of the briefcase offers an awesome effect.

3)  The Artifacts.  Seriously, the degree of detail and imagination that went into the artificial memorabilia far exceeded my expectations.  I would have been satisfied with a couple of tongue-in-cheek character profiles.  These items go far beyond that.  I don't want to go into detail so as to allow people the same joyful ear-to-ear grin it gave me, but allow me to say that there was far more here both in quantity and quality than I ever hoped for.  I can't wait to study each item closely.

4) Bonus Disc.  I haven't even inserted this yet, let alone viewed it.  I have seen plenty of reviewers claim it wasn't nearly as much as they expected.  But remember that the $25 valuing of the movies doesn't include this disc.  Anything included on it is extra, and therefore FREE.  Stop complaining.

5) Digipak cardboard slipcases with new cover art.  Some may scoff at my including this as a feature, but truth be told, these very cool new illustrated art covers for the movies are a huge selling point to me.  Very classy move on this inclusion.

Of course then there is the simple fact that the movies themselves are fantastic.  So if you already own all six movies on Blu-Ray, is this worth it?  Very possibly not.  But no one ever claimed that the briefcase and enclosed items were worth $150, and I think that's what a lot of reviewers are forgetting.  The assumption here is that the people buying it probably own between zero and three of these movies (at least on Blu-Ray).  I myself only own Thor and Captain America.  I didn't mind the $40-$50 hit I took by purchasing these twice.  Someone who owns all six movies already (or I'd say at least four) will want to think seriously about the level to which they care about the extra goodies.

But is Amazon overpricing this for what it is and includes?  Absolutely not.",1365206400,2,3620,4.697452229299363

They took the movie discs out of the 2 disc set and left out the special feature discs, one of the few reasons I have to buy any physical media disc anymore.  They made sure to include 3D versions of Captain America, Thor, and Avengers that I'll never be able to use, but the special features for Iron Man 1 and 2 apparently weren't important enough.  And of course, the Captain America, Thor, and Incredible Hulk discs managed to include all special features and the movie on one disc, so this is doubly unacceptable.  And the case looks stupid once you lift the lid because you can see the LED lights through the silver plastic casing.  Additionally, the ""handle"" is completely useless, there's not enough space between it and the case for anything larger than an infant's hand.  These may seem like minor quibbles, the little prop folios on each movie are cute and the rest of the case is ok, but after shelling out $150 and being patient all this time for this set, these things are glaring oversights.

I have been collecting, drawing, reading and loving comics for about 20 years and if anyone would be a critic it is me. The only  thing I can complain about is the top when it opens.  In the pictures I saw on the internet the top was shown upright as if it would stay that way.  But when you open it the top opens all the way until it is flat and causes a lot of stress on the hinges so be careful when you open it.  Other than that it is possibly the coolest collection ever.

5126099,3,B0083SBMGW,"When you pay so much money on a set... you expect certain things. Like easy to find bonus content that is actually on the discs.

There's a secret decoder thingy that points you to a web site ""battleofnewyork.net"". Once there you have to type in your special secret shield access code card number. Then... they force you to fill out all your contact information so big brother can put you on their mailing list before showing you a 5 minute Phase II preview that's mostly clips from the Phase I movies and Iron Man 3 trailer footage we've already seen.

A website is not content that is actually on the disc. If they're going to do it this way... then they better at least update the site regularly. I am very tempted to put my shield access code up on here for everyone to use... if they were to ban me for that I would then return this box set for a refund.

P.S. The set should've also included DVDs and Digital copies of all the movies. Yes the description says it doesn't... but the description isn't my problem... my problem is.... the set should've also included DVDs and Digital copies of all the movies. Do you get that?

P.P.S. I don't have a problem with all the cheap stupid crap that came with the set... that's part of the fun... it's why you get something like this. If you think it's junk then don't get it.

5126101,4,B0083SBMGW,"I preordered this set in July 2012. Due to a lawsuit with a briefcase, I waited much longer than I originally anticipated. However, it was very much worth the wait with the exception of a couple of flaws.

First off, the good.

The packaging is fantastic. Yes, the suitcase is made of hard plastic, but in my honest opinion, it doesn't take away from the product itself. There's an LED light system powering the entire briefcase the moment you open it up. When viewing this in the dark, it's actually very cool.

The bluray sleeves are gorgeous. I was very impressed with the art design for each movie. I also really enjoyed the slip covers. It added a nice unique touch to the movies we've grown to love.

The files. Now to some, this wouldn't be enough. To me? It was amazing seeing all the props from the movies come to life in the briefcase. From Captain America's trading cards, to Tony Stark's first sketches of the original Ironman suit, I couldn't have asked for anything more. It's truly a nerd's paradise.

Now onto the cons.

Bonus features. There are not enough features here to make this all the worthwhile. For a collection like this, I was sadly disappointed with the amount of bonus content.

Discs. Odd thing, but Marvel decided to put disc one of Ironman and Ironman 2. This wouldn't be a problem, however it's labeled disc one. If you are going to do this, why not include disc 2? Almost feels incomplete. Which is a shame.

Overall, I am very pleased. I would give this set 4.5 out of 5 stars if I could. Some minor setbacks prevent this from being the perfect box set, however it's still an amazing item to own. I would highly recommend it for anyone who truly loves these amazing movies.",1365206400,,1709,4.508090614886731

Anyway as for content, everything in the picture is all there, the Tesseract doesn't glow that bright or solid like that as far as I can tell but it's all there. Would be nice if it were like the outside or like when you opened it it was auto on or something but hey can't really complain to much. I love the Blu Ray covers and all the extra stuff.

The inside of the case is well designed and neat to look at. The Tesseract is not perfect, but it is nothing less than I expected. I don't know what those who are complaining were expecting. Maybe an exact replica of the movie prop? I don't know, but what is included in the set is fun and true fans will absolutely love it.

The included files have some great information and fun facts, and the blueprints and included extras within the files are wonderful. I absolutely love the Blu-Ray sleeves, the art on them is gorgeous.

Over-all, my biggest complaint is that I have a hard time getting my fingers under the handle, but I have large hands, and it doesn't really matter in the end. This set is well worth it's price. I grew up watching Marvel cartoons, and the Avengers movie brought that part of my childhood back to life, and this set does the same.

We all know the movies are awesome, but the packaging is the big attraction for this item.

Exclusive content UPDATE:

I figured out the secret to accessing the exclusive phase 2 preview within a minute or two, and though it's less than 10 minutes and doesn't show a lot, I really enjoyed it.  It had some test footage from Ant Man which was kind of funny, and some concept art from Guardians of the Galaxy which I thought was pretty cool.  The best part, though, was the footage from Thor: The Dark World, and the extended clips from Iron Man 3!!  This was one of the things that kept me from canceling my order through all the delays, and I'm glad I hung in there.

All the physical extras are pretty cool, though won't be much more than a one time ""wow"" factor, and maybe a conversation piece on rare occasion.  They consist of 5 ""files"", one for Thor, Cap, Hulk, Iron Man, and S.H.I.E.L.D., which includes Hawkeye and Black Widow.  My favorites of the items were the Captain America and Thor folders. Cap's folder includs a very authentic newspaper cutout of Peggy that Cap kept with him when he went into battle, a few Steve Rogers U.S. Army documents, a ""skinny Steve"" boot camp photo, and the Captain America trading cards that Agent Coulson wanted Cap to sign in the Avengers.  Some of the cooler things from Thor's folder are the Donald Blake drivers license (not laminated, just thick, glossy cardboard), Realistic looking copies of the drawings Thor made to illustrate the 5 realms to Jane Foster, the page from the children's book in the movie about the ""Rainbow Bridge"".  Other than that, the Iron Man folder has some cool stuff, my favorite of which was a bar napkin that Tony Stark wrote a message to the reporter on (yes, it's a real napkin that looks like Tony Stark wrote on it and signed it!!).  Hulk and S.H.I.E.L.D. files have basic info which is ok, but not as cool as the rest.

Movie case UPDATE:

All the complaints about the cardboard cases are mostly correct.  I haven't had the discs fall out yet though, They are in folded cardboard sleeve holders.  What may make them fall out if not removed carefully, is the fact that there is not center rings for the discs to attach to.  They only sit in half-sleeves inside the folded card-case.  Not too different from a well made greeting card (with disc slot inside).  I'm not too impressed with the minimalist art on the cases, but it's ok.  Since I already own the original blu ray versions of these movies, I'll probably never remove them from the cardboard.

  However, I would suggest to anyone who will be using them on a regular basis, to get extra blu ray clamshells ( or one big 10 disc blu ray clamshell) and print some cool artwork to house these movies in a more safe packaging.

Tesseract UPDATE:

OK, if you're still wondering why so many problems with the Tesseract, please watch the video version of this review...you'll know it's workings like they never will...LOL!
All in all, I've went from being extremely excited when this arrived>>>slightly disappointed when I saw the fragile case tabs and tesseract that doesn't look nearly as cool as the pics.  >>>>Completely frustrated to the point of returning the set when I kept slamming the cube into my hand as per the instructions.>>> after calming down and taking the cube apart, I noticed s fix to avoid having to hit it super hard, and now I've decided to keep the set.  From reading other reviews, I'll probably be disappointed with the ""exclusive extras"" on discs in this set, but I'll come back and update the review after I've seen them just to have a more rounded picture of everything you get.

Original review:

The Tesseract has awakened...and it needs batteries!!!  Just got this set to join my Pirates of the Caribbean treasure chest, Avengers lenticular light up collector's box, and Watchmen lenticular collectors box.  My first impression:  the Best Buy Avengers light up box for $69.95 was a better investment than this set.  It's cool, don't get me wrong, but I honestly think for the price, they could have put a little more quality into the design.  The plastic is understandable (though lightweight, sturdy metal or another stronger material for a few $$ more would have been better. NOTE: I would recommend being very careful with this case, don't handle it or store it in any way which could possibly result in a fall.  I'm thinking it wouldn't survive much more than a 6 inch fall to a wood/tile floor.

On the design:  First of all, the case opens and closes with two clips that are made to resemble actual briefcase clips, however they don't actually flip out and/or latch on like briefcase clips.  They are just regular plastic tab/latches that you have to pull out each time you open this case.  I can easily see these tabs breaking off after many opens/closes and the plastic weakens.

Secondly, the tesseract is just a white plastic cube in the middle (blue light behind it is kind of cool), though the tesseract is supposed to glow itself...and mine just stays a white, cheap plastic cube.  I hit it against my palm once, then a few times as per the directions, and nothing.  I then removed the batteries, placed them in other directions, and still nothing.  I guess I'll have to spend extra $$ to get some A13 batteries and see if it's the stock batteries that were dead, or if the Tesseract is just broken.

The rest of the content is yet to be explored, but it looks identical to the promo pics.  I'll update this review, and possibly the star rating after I've seen the bonus content and resolved the broken tesseract.",1365120000,,6071,4.9204322200392925
5126148,1,B0083SBMGW,"Finally got it in the mail today, cheap plain,  the track pops out on the inside too easily making it hard to hold the dvds in their cheap cardboard envelopes.  Everything is hard plastic, everything, and the tesseract was a joke, have to do a lot more than tap to get it going.  Files were lame, a picture in a couple of them but most was just some printed fake documents.  You couldn't use this as a showpiece anywhere, which is a shame because the only reason you would want something this big would be for a showpiece.",1365120000,7,522,4.295918367346939
5126149,5,B0083SBMGW,"I am a fanboy.

I thought I should preface my review with this, so you see that I care, maybe a bit too much. But that's my prerogative.

This is an amazing set, to be concise. The movies are all in their original sets, with 3-D Blu-rays, where applicable. You're getting the same discs you would if you bought them separately. You'll know if you like them or not(I hope).

The exclusives are what we're here for. The case is spectacular, with a faux interior resembling advanced technology, used to contain the ""Tesseract"". (Nifty, but you won't mess with it much) The bonus disc contains some animatics for each movie, and sometimes deleted scenes. As with the Tesseract, you'll play with it once and not much after that. The REALLY cool things are the files that come with the set. You get a separte file for each character, along with nifty collectibles, like Thor's fake license, the Arc Reactor blueprints, Captain America trading cards, and more! Then you have the SHIELD Confidential file, which, along with the decoder, will lead you to the preview of Marvel's Phase 2 set of movies coming up. The only qualm I have with the case is the insanely small handle. Don't expect to be carrying this around like a normal briefcase.

Overall, if you're a fanboy or you don't own any of the Marvel movies you love, pick this up. You won't be disappointed. Others can pass if they want, as I'm sure you can get the movies separately for quite a bit cheaper.

I had to wait until I got home from work to open my early Birthday present to myself. I was NOT dissapointed! Yes, the case is small. What were you expecting? An ACTUAL metal full size suit case? Do you have any idea how much that would have cost us as consumers? It's for display purposes, not for practical use. If you honestly thought you were going to walk around with this set as a case...time to grow up. it's a display piece, nothing more. Of course the inside is a plastic mold...what did you expect? real working keypads, wires and blinking functional power lights leading to the Tesseract? Get a grip. It looks awesome as it was intended, a display case for a box set of 6 of the best superhero movies ever made, PLUS a bonus disc, PLUS a ton, and I mean a ton, of extras included in the files...you will be amazed at the things you get, for a mere $149.49. Just the flicks are worth that!!
The Tesseract is fun, looks great in the dark, and looks even better right where it is...in the case, lit by LED's in the case..a nice glow. It doesn't take that much to get it going, so I am not understanding people who are smacking the crap out of these to get them lit.

5126195,5,B0083SBMGW,"I think it's great. I wish they had designed the case a little differently though, simply because the handle is ridiculously small, other than that I like it and I'm glad I waited",1365033600,,179,4.454545454545454
5126196,3,B0083SBMGW,"Let me begin by saying the movies in this set are by far some of my all time favorites! I actually already own all the movies in this set, but I thought the packaging looked really cool, and I really wanted the bonus disc which I thought would have a lot more features on it.
Now having purchased it, I really have buyer's remorse. I should have waited and read other people's reviews. The movie discs are all the exact same discs as in their individual releases (which I expected), but frankly the bonus disc just really didn't have all that much on it. Seriously, I saw about all I wanted to see in less than an hour. I expected the Phase 2 previews to be on the bonus disc, but they aren't. In fact there is no indication I've found as to where the Phase 2 stuff is. Only by reading the reviews did I find out that I have to go to a web site to see them!
The dossiers are pretty nice, and feature some items that made me grin, such as the Captain America trading cards. The case itself is really cheaply made, and I hate how the discs fit in it. I really believe for the price of this set, it could have been SO much nicer.",1365033600,3,1126,4.076576576576577
5126197,5,B0083SBMGW,"If you already own all the DVDs included, then its probably not worth the price unless you're really into owning replica memorabilia. The only DVD I owned out of this set was The Avengers though, so for me it was a great deal and all the extras in it made my geeky heart jump for joy!

The folders inside are wonderful and we've had fun watching the films and then going through the folder afterwards for the particular character and remembering where each piece came from. My favorite has to be the napkin with the note from Tony Stark.

Only thing that could have made this set better was if the briefcase had been actual metal instead of the cheap plastic that makes me worry about breakage every time I open it.

Overall though extremely happy with it!! Only thing that could be better is a similar set for all the X-men films!

UPDATE: Just realized the SHIELD card with code in the confidential envelope is actually for something (one of those ""well duh"" moments). (Hint: Line up the pictures.) Granted it wasn't anything amazing, but it's still fun when packages include little puzzles like that.",1365033600,52,1103,4.612244897959184
5126198,1,B0083SBMGW,"Like other people have said, this set feels very cheaply made, with cost-cutting everywhere. The case itself is made out of cheap plastic, including clips that hold it closed and the hinges on its back (be careful with it and try to not open/close it too often), same goes for interior design, like the ""circuit board"" around the Tesseract and the ""keypad"" inside - they all look and feel pretty flimsy (just try to press slightly on an area around the Tesseract)... The tiny carrying handle on the exterior of the case (made for a child's hand?) feels especially ""insulting""... The Tesseract is just a cheap plastic cube with a blinking light - looks like a toddler's toy and nothing even remotely close to how it looked like in the movie. Of course, I didn't expect a briefcase made by Zero Haliburton and a Tesseract made out of Swarowski crystal glass and lit up by a 3W blue Cree LED for this price, BUT such a cheap materials as this set currently has are extremely disappointing...
 The disks are packaged into thin cardboard sleeves and can easily ""slide out"" of them, so be careful when carrying them around in their sleeves! The bonus materials (aside from some nice paper ones and a few of plastic ID/driver's license cards inside the ""case files"") are also pretty disappointing - you'll get more video content when buying all these movies separately plus you'll get DVD disks with those separate sets (which are still extremely useful for many older disk players, for example in non-retina MacBooks or in most of the car's entertainment systems).
All in all, definitely not worth this amount of money even considering the ""limited edition"" factor... If you're planning to simply resell this to some fool a few years later - go for it, but if you're planning on keeping it for yourself or show it to your friends - you should really skip it and wait for a better re-release, perhaps the one which would combine all of the ""phases"" of these movies in some sort of ""ultimate edition"".",1365033600,25,1993,4.694285714285714

I took out the tab and banged it on my hand until it hurt, then any hard surface. No light): I'm happy with everything else, but I would really like a replacement for my box and tesseract. Is there a way I could get that guaranteed with an outer protective box so they don't put the sticker over all my heroes' faces? This wouldn't be such an issue if I hadn't waited since August or if I wasn't OCD about my purchases, but since I am, this is devastating.",1365033600,14,765,4.210884353741497

Cheap Plastic... It's a Kid's toy.

The ""Interactive Tesseract""... what a JOKE!!!

I am so extremely disappointed with Marvel releasing this Garbage.

I'll stick to the individual movies I own on Blu-ray because they at least have Bonus Discs, unlike this set.

The Exclusive Bonus Features Disc... What Bonus Features? Drawings and Storyboards... BORING.
Oh... Agent Coulson introducing the movies? Cool when it was AMC Theatres, but there should be a whole lot of extra stuff such as behind the scenes, Deleted Scenes (beside the 2 or 3 on the disc) and Gag Reels would be great!!!

The Discs arrived in Cardboard sleeves that they simply slide out of... even of their own accord during shipping, so they are scratched up.

Amazon... I am returning my order, TODAY. Thank You",1365033600,15,884,4.945945945945946
5126201,5,B0083SBMGW,"And I'm reviewing this set from that point of view. I never owned these movies on any format prior to this and am extremely happy with this set! Opening the case for the first time and seeing the glow inside was very cool. I've had no problems with my cube or the plastic tray popping out. It would have been cool if the circuitry around the cube also lit up but that's not a deal breaker for me. The case is also a good size in my opinion. Not too big, not too small and the simplistic new artwork on each sleeve fits the tone of each movie perfectly. I'm keeping the sleeves out of the case because if they're not seated perfectly, the edges can be easily bent by opening and closing the lid.

All of the file folders with extras are sweet especially comparing the content to what's used in the movies.

The S.H.I.E.L.D. disc is cool and since I'm a storyboard artist, I found the animatics and previz sequences really interesting. Those that think the extras on this disc is all there is should know that Captain America, Thor, The Incredible Hulk and the Avengers all have their retail extras. The Iron Man 1 and 2 bonus discs not being included isn't a big deal for me as Iron Man is actually my least favorite character of all the Avengers.

All in all, I definitely recommend this set to those that don't have these on Blu yet as they all look and sound outstanding and don't let the gripes about the case being a ""toy"" or feeling cheap dissuade you. Had it been up to the level many wanted, it would have probably cost double to triple what it does. While I will agree that the list price is on the high side, having spent $150 on this, I feel that's a great price point for everything you get.",1365033600,,1702,4.279503105590062
5126271,3,B0083SBMGW,"I ordered this when it was first announced and have been waiting for it ever since.  It finally arrived yesterday, and I am disappointed.  I was expecting additional behind the scenes footage, more extras and such, but there wasn't much of that included.  There is only 1 disc in this set that is above and beyond what you can get on the individual Blu-Ray discs.  And there is not much on that one disc.  It has the intros that were done for the marathon at the release of Avengers, and some additional pre-vis material, but that's it, the rest of the Discs are exactly what you could get in the Blu-Ray package and there aren't any additional extra features.
The ""briefcase"" and tesseract are cheap junk with some blue lights inside.  There are a few paper items and some online content included, but nothing really exciting.  The discs themselves are in cheap paper sleeves that seem like they are going to scratch up the discs.  Bottom line, if you already have the blu-ray's skip this set, it's not worth it.  If you don't have any of the blu-rays yet and are looking for an instant Marvel collection, this is not a bad deal.",1365033600,,1130,4.527093596059113
5126272,4,B0083SBMGW,"After almost a year of waiting, I received my Avengers Assembled 10-Disc Blu-ray set and, to my surprise, It was worth the wait. And while the DVDs are obviously the centerpiece of the set, the extras are why fans like me shelled out a few extra bucks. But are the extras worth it?

Between the HD-quality streaming and digital download options, any movie that I actually want to watch more than once I'm likely to stream or buy a digital version. Amazon, Netflix streaming, and a few other services amply feed my media consumption, so I rarely feel the need to purchase a physical DVD anymore.

The Avengers collector's set was obviously meant for fans who want some exclusive goodies, but without a cosplay price tag. Unboxing the set, you're eyes feast on a chromed SHIELD briefcase. The cheap plastic of the case, non-functional clasps, and a handle that is too short to fit any but a child's fingers all somewhat take away from the overall experience. But at the price point, it's still nice packaging. And a button under the handle lights up the center circle of the case which is a nice touch.

Opening the case reveals a light-up Tesseract cube set within a plastic tray. Again, it's the details that take away from the experience: The plastic Tesseract cube's batteries were dead and the flimsy tray popped out when I removed the DVDs. I replaced the tray easily enough, however, and I was able to replace the button batteries in the cube (though it proved to be rather temperamental to get to flash, requiring several violent smacks to activate).

The set is definitely not designed to be treated roughly like, say, by kids. Thankfully, mine have had lots of practice and know to stay away from other attractive toys like Daddy's Lego sets, Daddy's RC cars, and Daddy's Transformers.

Fortunately, the four dossiers on Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, and Thor make up for the shortcomings of the rest of the set. Included within each are memorabilia and trinkets fans will instantly recognize from each of the movies. The plentiful contents of each folder will provide plenty of enjoyable perusing.

The fifth folder is a SHIELD file with information about the Tesseract itself. It also includes personnel files on Black Widow and Hawkeye. A sealed envelope contains an access card and decoder lens that, once I found the report that matched it, revealed a message pointing me to a website. Thinking it was going to provide exclusive downloads or perhaps an augmented reality game (similar to what the show Lost did a few years back), I immediately logged on (using the access code on the card). The site currently only contains a video preview of Phase 2 of the Avengers franchise, which looks to be every bit as good (if not better) than Phase 1. I hope Marvel has plans to build out the site further, since it has the potential to rally fans before each of the new movies is released.",1365033600,4,2898,4.7287128712871285

5126275,5,B0083SBMGW,"I was extremely pleased with this set.

I can't say much about the blu-rays, although in response to the criticism, if you are concerned about wear on the edge of the disc you can simply turn them around in their holders. I have not watched any of them yet, but I assume they are no different than the other retail versions.

As for the rest of the package, there are some valid criticisms. The case is plastic, yes.  The keypad does not work.  The cube DOES work, if you remove the little tab on the bottom that prevents the batteries from touching the contact points.  All of these could have been changed, and we could have paid twice the amount.  While I appreciate that some people would be willing to pay more for ""X"", a business deision has to be made.  Most people simply wouldn't pay that much more for the super high-end content.

Having said that, the props that are included are outstanding.  All recognizable from the films.  Donald Blake's drivers license, arc reactor blueprints, Captain America trading cards (blood stains not included)... the list of cool items is long.  It's not cheap to produce the amount and varied types of props that were included. This is why I consider this set to be a tremendous value.

Agent Coulsen's business card alone makes this five stars for me.",1365033600,,1296,4.611353711790393
5126276,3,B0083SBMGW,"I caved and pre-ordered the Marvel Phase One collection at the last minute.

Cons:
1) The DVD releases of the movies are not included, which means you need a Blu-ray player.  Knowing Paramount, because I experienced it with the ST:TNG Season 2 Blu-ray release, your PC will need PowerDVD to play these Blu-rays due to the encryption and anti-pirvacy crap that Paramount puts on their discs.  If you have AnyDVD HD installed on our PC, you probably won't be able to play all of the Blu-ray discs on your PC--again due to Paramount's DRM encoding.

2) The bonus S.H.I.E.L.D. Blu-ray disc is crap.  There's nothing top secret about this disc.  This disc contains the openers during AMC Theatre's Marvel Phase One marathons, some deleted scenes, etc.  I would have expected exclusive interviews, behind-the-scenes, etc. or even a special debriefing by Samuel L. Jackson (as Nick Fury)...but there's nothing like that.

3)  You will hurt your hand activating the Tesseract (aka The Cosmic Cube).  The instructions say for to tap the cube on your hand to activate it.  I have to slap the cube against my hand to activate it.  I cannot tell the difference between Mode 1 and Mode 2 of the cube.  Additionally, the cube is significantly smaller than the movie version.  I feel like I'm holding Tesseract Jr. instead of a recreation of the movie prop.

4) The latches of the ""metallic"" case seem fragile.  I wouldn't let a kid or an impatient person unlock the case, or else these latches will probably break off.  These latches should barely be pulled to open up the case.

5) When you open the case, there's no way to turn off the LED lights.  I wish there was an off switch.

6)  I would paid more money if the keypad actually worked!  Instead, the keypad is just a cheap plastic mold.

7)  The opening sides of the Blu-ray jackets face down, which means the edges of the Blu-ray discs are exposed to the bottom of the case.  This, I think, could cause wear and tear to the Blu-ray discs themselves.  So these Blu-ray discs are less protected than the individual Blu-ray releases.

8)  What most people, I think, want to see is the Marvel Phase 2 stuff.  Without watching what has been released on various comic book sites and other geek sites, you need to use the special ""decoder"" and then match it up to the page in the S.H.I.E.L.D. file to get the URL for the Marvel Phase 2 website.  The website requires you to always log in with your special code and then use an e-mail as further validation for your login.  The website itself, I think, is poorly coded as the streaming video did not play the first time in IE9 or Chrome.  I had to kill these web browsers, because nothing was happening.  After my e-mail address was validated with the Marvel Phase 2 website, I could then watch the streaming video.  Aside from that, this website is a blatant way of geting junk e-mail from Disney, Marvel, ESPN, and whatever other media properties Disney owns.

Pro:
1) If you are a comic book fan or desire to have movie props, then this is the REAL reason why you buy this.  I think the character files are cool.  For the Iron Man file, part of the goodies contains a recreation of the drawings that combines into the Mark I armor.  The Captain American file contains some of the trading cards.  I felt like I was handling the papers, cards, etc. from the movies.

I haven't watched the Blu-ray discs themselves, but I would guess these discs are from the individual Blu-ray releases.

To summarize, if you want your own access to the Marvel Phase 2 website and want to have movie props from the Marvel Phase One movies, then get this case.  Otherwise, you feel very ripped off and very pissed off that you bought this case.",1365033600,3,3713,4.5636363636363635
5126277,2,B0083SBMGW,"Maybe I shouldn't have expected more.  For 6 movies and three 3D(which I don't care about) discs, I guess this isn't a horrible price($139).  This should have been an indicator that the rest of it wasn't worth much.  If I didn't have all the movies already I might have kept it.  Though my Tesseract wouldn't light up, no matter how hard I smacked it and would have needed to be replaced.  Didn't bother opening any of the other stuff it came with.  I was just too disappointed in the quality and have returned it for a refund.  Found videos online to build a better looking Tesseract for much less!",1365033600,2,599,4.440366972477064

The cube flat out sucks. The case feels like the top will break off if I open it all the way and let it hang. The files are pretty cool and some little add ins make it interesting, but overall I'm still pretty disappointed in this. Moreover, the movie discs for the films say ""Disc 1"" on them, yet don't include the follow-up discs of bonus features. What gives? Anyways... I don't recommend this as a collectable but if you just want the bare bones of the movie collection with a few 3d versions added in and a bonus disc that has some stuff... you might consider it.",1365033600,2,790,4.23841059602649

When I opened the box it was shipped in I was already pleased, it was smaller then I expected but that is fair from a deal breaker, in fact I found it to be just the right size. I was at first a bit dissapointed with the Tesseract, I was looking at it in a bright room so the flashing lights didn;t get to really shine. (No pun intended.) The case it's self could stand to be better made for the money and I would of liked for the buttons to well be buttons. But whole package was worth the money and I'm very glad I was able to pick this up. Everything from the files to the movies was worth my time and money.

Speaking of the files I love every bit of what they put in it, from the Cap. America cards to the Mark I sketch. None of it dissapointed me. I however wish they had a few more things like a file for Loki, Black Widow and Hawkeye (more then just a report for Hawkeye and Black Widow). Also more things from the Avengers like the Stark Tower plans and the bill from Shawarma.

All and all I'm happy with this, could it be better, oh yea but I'm not dissapointed. For a die hard fan with cash to burn I would recommened this. For someone that just likes the movies then it's nice but nothing to drop the cash for. All I have to say now is I'm a very happy nerd.",1364947200,,1494,3.924092409240924
5126330,5,B0083SBMGW,"First off, this review is not about the movies, just the collectors set and its contents. Marvel spent a lot of time putting together all of these goodies for us. Each Avenger comes with his or her own file that is full of (obviously mass produced, not used in filming) movie props. For example some of the things in Tony Starks file are tickets to the Stark Expo, Blue Prints for the Arc Reactor, hand scribbled notes on a napkin and some teasers for Iron Man 3 just to name a few.

Each Avenger has specific and unique props and things relating to their  movie. I'm not a huge comic book fan but I loved the movies and I found all of these things to be quite awesome. You also get random things like a S.H.I.E.L.D ID badge that has a secret  look into Phase Two that we have to find online but only if you find the secrets within the files they give you. There is also tons of random news paper clippings and pictures of all of the different stories that just tell back story and really make you feel like we live in this Marvel world and all this stuff really happened. Can't complain about that. The cover art for each movie is also really cool and unique and we get an extra dvd that has lots of extras for us.

My ONLY complaint about this set is how terrible the quality of the case is. We spent $150 on this set and yes it comes with tons of goodies and extra features but the case is way to cheap for me to be satisfied. It lights up when you push a button as well as when you open the case and the tesseract cube lights up when you  tap on it but the plastic is incredibly cheap. Marvel really cut corners in the manufacturing of the case. I understand that they couldn't give us a metal case at a reasonable price but considering it cost $150, AND we have already given them almost $4 BILLION in ticket sales to watch all of these movies I would expect a nicer quality case from them. Even considering the cheap quality of it, it still looks pretty cool.

Final verdict: If you love these movies and don't own all of them (like me) or even if you own all of them but just want all of the goodies and extra features it comes with I would defiantly recommend this set. Considering everything it comes with, in my opinion it is easy to overlook the cheap quality of the case. I highly recommend getting this set if you enjoyed Phase One at all.",1364947200,,2352,4.181015452538631

But the cube itself is a massive disappointment. It's a plain square of white plastic that blinks with a bit of a blue glow for about 10 seconds if you pick it up and shake it pretty hard. It looks NOTHING like the promo photo used to sell this. Very bummed about that.",1364947200,,440,4.25
5126335,3,B0083SBMGW,"I placed this order when it was first announced sometime in September in 2012 and after so many delays due to a luggage company and Marvel having legal battles about the specifications/copyrights of the set's case, I forgot that it was even pre-ordered. Now, Amazon did send me a Blu-Ray copy of ""The Avengers"" for FREE, which was something I have never seen any major retailer due for a preorder that was delayed as many times as it was, so kudos to Amazon/Marvel for doing that, as it makes my review somewhat more lenient.

Based on that, I can't say that I'm too thrilled with the set. Sure, it comes with:

- Iron Man
- Iron Man 2
- The Incredible Hulk
- Captain America: The First Avengers
- Thor
- The Avengers

..but as someone who has purchased ""Thor"" and ""The Avengers"" (yeah yeah, it was free..), I can't say the overall value of having these six movies was a bargain for me. You do get a sneak preview on what's to come with the next wave of Avenger-related movies and Guardians of the Galaxy, so that's a good addition. But here's what I like and don't like about the set:

[+]'s:
- All Avenger-related movies plus a sneak preview of what to expect with the next wave.
- Cool artwork that replaces the usual sleeve/case for the movies
- Awesome S.H.I.E.L.D. dossiers complete with ""S.H.I.E.L.D. Access Card and Decoder
- Tesseract and the case lights up!
- Everything stored within a pseudo-operative briefcase with the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo

[-]'s:
- Briefcase is made out of a cheap plastic material
- The handle on the briefcase isn't even large enough for the average person's fingers to fit comfortably through. You're better off using both hands to carry the case on its side when moving it around.
- the movies are stored in cardboard albeit stylish sleeves rather than traditional Blu-Ray cases (which I would have preferred).
- Somewhat difficult to practically store and display with the rest of the Blu-Rays you may own.

Overall, I feel that the value of the movies and little trinkets that are included (not to mention the entire gimmick of everything stored within a briefcase as if you were working for S.H.I.E.L.D.) are somewhat worth the price tag. I'm a HUGE Marvel Geek and an extreme Blu-Ray aficionado so I suppose you can say this set is a nice balance between the two. However, I feel that the cheapness of the case (they had several months to at make some improvements to the case with all of the delays) and the inability to store and display this set with the rest of your collection without it looking like an eyesore are pretty huge drawbacks to me. Was it worth the wait? Not to me. However, if you are an extremist when it comes to owning everything Marvel or just a fan of Blu-Ray movies, this set is for you. Otherwise, if you're a casual fan of both, I feel like your money is well spent (and saved) by buying these movies separately since most of them can be had for around $15 or less.",1364947200,,2929,4.527410207939509
5126336,5,B0083SBMGW,"For a detailed review of this collection and it's contents, check out the review by Joshua titled ""It finally arrives.""

My personal opinion:

Best movie collection ever. DC could learn a thing or two about building a franchise if they'd pay attention to what Marvel is doing.

5126339,2,B0083SBMGW,"When I first heard about this product, I was excited. From the promotional imagery it seemed like it was going to be a nice suitcase replica with case files and the movies. I preordered without hesitation and waited. It got delayed unfortunately and I forgot I even preordered it.

Then a week ago, I got a email saying that on April 2nd it would be shipped to me, I got excited again. By now I had almost all the movies but Captain America, but I figured I could sell them off at no problem. When I finally got it in the mail, I quickly went from excited to disappointed.

What I got instead was a 12x8 cheap plastic feeling case, with very thin plastic clips that I think will snap off at some point, poor quality control on one of the products inside, and not to mention almost everything of the ""movie prop replicas"" were made from cheap gloss paper. I feel cheated, I feel like I just paid for the movies and got a cheap tie in product for free. I expect this kind of cheapness in a mass produced kids product, but not in something that is suppose to have a limited run and be a limited edition collectible complete with certificate of authenticity. I don't recommend this product to anybody, save yourself the disappointment in this ""collectible"".

Then there are dossiers  on each character with special items in each one. The case is nicely made with the shield symbol lighting up with the press of a button. When you open the case it lights up the tesseract which also can be activated by yourself. All and all if you're a movie buff or a nerd like me get this set!,1364947200,,496,4.276595744680851

What comes in the box?

1. ""Confidential"" Envelope which contains an access card and ""post card"" which reveals a website.
2. Tactical Sys Folder which contains file on the Tesseract, Item 47, Romanoff, and Barton.
3. Folder containing ""Hospital Records,"" Captain America cards, pictures, paper with drawing, and Army records of Steven Grant Rogers.
4. ""Stark, Tony"" folder which contains a newspaper clip, sketches, engineering plans, tickets to Stark World Expo, and a few other things.
5. ""Puente Antigo"" folder which contains a patient bracelet, drawings, id cards, and 2 other things.
6. ""Dr. Banner, Bruce"" folder which contains newspaper clip, Cryosync laber, redacted SHIELD document, sticker, and 2 other items.

While there were some issues with the release date of this set that would set the date even further away, they have created a masterpiece to bring the films together. Well worth the wait, and well worth the cash. If you call yourself a Marvelite you should either have this right now or be ordering it in the near future. Having each of the movies on blu ray and a very cool case to keep them in is just the beginning.

So I start popping in discs.  Avenger's.  Nope.  Iron man 2.  Nope.  Iron Man 1.  Nope.  I give up.  If there is any exclusive material it won't be exclusive by the time I find it.  If you are considering this you could also buy a plastic box, all the marvel movies, 2 rolls of toilet paper, and a blue led light.

5126376,4,B0083SBMGW,"I preordered this back in August right before Marvel came out saying, ""Oops we screwed up."" After a patient wait of 7 months it finally arrived. Needless to say its a great set, but it's incomplete.

When I read up on this back before the lawsuit. The set was said to include all the movies in ""Phase One"" plus a bonus disc with more extras. However, they missed the two extra discs on the first two Iron Man movies. Some could consider this nit picking, but I'm a completionist, and it ticks me off when the actual discs say ""Disk One"" on them. I know this is a repack, but I feel if they were going to throw in the 3D blu of Thor, Cap, and Avengers they could've finished Iron Man. (Especially with the extra time they had to ""redo"" the set.)

In a nut shell, I got my money out of this. I only had a few of the movies on Blu ray when this was announced, so I now have them all. Plus all the groovy swag the set comes with is neat, from the props to the documents. Still I felt they could've easily fixed this issue, but over looked it as careless as the briefcase licensing issue.

Though I have to say props to Amazon for having the decency to send each person who ordered this set originally a free copy of Avengers to hold you over for the wait. Well done guys, very classy.

But the fact is, as long as you don't expect the world, it's a great looking set. Is it Harry Potter Wizards Collection-quality? No. But does it do the job and display the movies in an ultra-impressive way? Absolutely yes. Also, practically speaking, considering the fact that there are 6 blu-ray movies and three 3D movies in this set, and taking into account all the extra collectibles and display case, I'd say the price tag is pretty spot-on.

Bottom line: this is a very handsome set and a great addition to the shelf. As long as your expectations are reasonable, you'll be thrilled (:",1364860800,3,752,4.489051094890511
5126378,4,B0083SBMGW,"After a long delay, it finally arrived. This set is somewhat worth the price, but Marvel could've put more effort into the quality of the case, which is decent at best. The case is an okay size, but the handle is too small.. it's like a handle for little kids. The light feature on the case should have an option where it can stay on instead of only staying on when the button is pressed. The latch on the case to get it open is pretty basic, but as long as it doesn't break I would be happy. The inside of the case is nice, but the quality is still decent/okay. When the case is open, it is illuminated with a blue light and looks pretty nice actually.

The tesseract cube was okay, didn't really expect much from it. when you use your palm and hit the cube, it lights up for about 30 seconds. If you hit the cube more than once, it goes into stage 2 mode and lights up at a faster rate. When you take out the folders inside and leave the cube inside while the case is close, you can see the suitcase avengers logo light up. The battery on the cube and light system inside the case can be replaced as well.

The artwork on the sleeves for the disc is nicely drawn, but like most people's complaints, they should have included the bonus discs from iron man and at least a dvd/digital copy for each movie. There was so much time to improve this set and there seemed to be nothing new from when this set was first announced except the bonus 5 minute feature, bonus disc, and a redesigned case. The sleeves for the discs could've been better for sure, instead of a paper case, they could've included a hard plastic case within the case.

Overall, I am happy with this set. This set should be $100-150, but considering this is a limited edition set, the price is almost just right. This set is definitely for Marvel fans and collectors. Let's hope that the Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Two set will be better!",1364860800,2,1909,4.282548476454294

Yes, the case is plastic. Yes, the tesseract isn't as great as the picture.

But, the files make up for it. It set my geeky little heart alight. You get file folders of the characters Thor, Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, and a file for SHIELD agents.

It includes things such as Coulson's business card, two tickets and a brochure for a Stark Expo, Cap's drawing of a dancing monkey, and Thor's fake drivers license. Plus, much much more.

Also included is the blu-ray and (when made) 3-D blu-ray version of Iron Man, Iron Man II, Thor, the Incredible Hulk, Captain America, and Avengers. The cover art on the sleeves for the movies is just stunning. Plus, an extras blu-ray. The extras disc includes one or more deleted scenes per movie, plus Coulson's introduction of each film.

Don't currently own the movies? It's a great deal. Own the movies? You'll have to decide for yourself. Personally, I'm glad I held on to my pre-order from last year.",1364860800,2,1015,4.648044692737431

I know the Tesseract is motion acitvated, but I was afraid of hitting it too hard.
After reading the comments though I really gave it a good smack and now it flashes.

The Cons: The case is made out of plastic not flimsy plastic but it could have been better. The case stays lit when open you can not turn off the lights...",1364860800,,513,3.9805825242718447
5126402,4,B0083SBMGW,"Got the today.  Here's what you get:

The six Phase One movies.  The extras are exactly what's on the regular BluRays.  So there is nothing new there.

SHIELD Avengers Initiative Disc.  Basically some additional deleted scenes from each of the movies (only a few minutes worth).  The interesting bit are the pre-viz and animations.  If you like that kind of stuff they're a good view of early development process.  The intros by Coulson are funny but short.

The case was redesigned and it shows.  The handle is way too small.  It cannot be carried comfortably.  This is strictly a display item.  The interior looks good but is a bit flimsy.  Again best as a display item not a functional case.  The cube lights up when it is slapped.

The meat is in the file folders.  Short files on Black Widow, Hawkeye and the Tesseract.  Some 40s Captain America memorabilia like collectors cards, copies of Steve Rogers enlistment papers etc.  The other movies get similar treatment with newspaper clippings, blueprints and other fun little tidbits.

As collectibles go, this is pretty good.  If you already have the BluRays I don't think extras are worth the money.  Especially since there is little in the way of extra content.  But if you're like me and waited for a set like this, you will not be disappointed.  As a display case the briefcase works.  The extras are interesting.  The movies are, of course, awesome.",1364860800,,1409,4.7625

The real gem of the prop replicas is a replica of Stark's drawing of the first Iron Man suit from the first movie,  which was done incredibly well.  Even the case shows attention to detail,  with a clip designed into the interior to hold all of the ""Files"" firmly in place.

The clippings and artifacts are cool, though the newspaper clipping of The Hulk should've been by a reporter named McGee. (""Don't make me angry...)

If you do not already own these movies, then this set is perfect for you because it's all the movies in one box set.  But if you already own some or all of the movies, the big question is: should I also buy this briefcase set?  Well, here are my thoughts:

- The blu-ray discs included are identical to the ones found in the previous individual releases of the films.  Picture and Audio quality is very good.

- For those interested in 3D, the 3D versions of ""Thor"", ""Captain America"", and ""The Avengers"" are included.

- If you already owned the 2-disc Special Editions of ""Iron Man"" or ""Iron Man 2"", you might want to keep the special features/bonus discs from those sets.  Unfortunately, this briefcase set only includes the one movie disc for those films.

- There is a SHIELD Bonus Disc exclusive to this set... it contains about an hour of deleted scenes and pre-visualization sequences.  I expected there to be so much more bonus content - I would have liked to see more interviews, featurettes, VFX breakdowns, etc.

- No DVDs or Digital Copies included.  This is a bit surprising, because the individual Marvel releases always included those.

- The briefcase feels a bit cheaper than I would have liked.  It has a nice finish and is fine to look at, but once you pick it up it lacks weight and doesn't feel very durable.

- The Tesseract (cube) itself lights up when you tap it against your palm.  The briefcase also lights up via a button on the outside of the briefcase, or whenever it is opened.  The effect is very cool when you are in a dark room.

- There are a number of artifacts within the briefcase, that come in SHIELD files.  There are files for Tony Stark, Bruce Banner, Thor, and Steve Rogers.  The files include many cool items and prop replicas - newspaper clippings, Captain America cards, ticket to the Stark Expo, the Ark Reactor blueprints, Jane Foster's ID card, data sheets on the Tesseract, character photographs, etc.

- One of the files in the briefcase contains a hidden clue that directs you a website (where you can see a 5-minute first look at the Phase Two movies).  It was fairly easy to find, but its fun to look for it.

- There is a unique code included in your set, which is used to unlock the content above.  This was not advertised anywhere, but it turns out this code is also valid for 500 points on the Disney Movie Rewards website.",1364860800,9,2829,5.1400437636761485
5126424,2,B0083SBMGW,"The title applies to both the movies in the pack and the quality of the ""bonus"" items.

Knowing full well going into the purchase it would be plastic, but its staggering just how crappy they went for materials.  The so called ""Tesseract"" couldn't be more cheaply made if they tried.  A plain, solid white cube with no patterns or designs on it whatsoever, that lights up and blinks if you slam it hard enough.  The box exclaims...""Hold the awesome power of the Tesseract in your hand!"".... while its more like... ""Hold a plain, white, boring piece of plastic that looks nothing like the Tesseract so that even your kids go 'huh'?"".  Look up on YouTube for videos showing how to make your own homemade Tesseract that would be about 100 times better than this one and still be dirt cheap.

The included paper extras are interesting reading, though surely not worth the buying the case set for alone.

Back when I preordered, this was the cheapest way at the time to get all the movies, though I'm not sure if thats still true as I have no desire to go and add up the current Amazon prices again after this debacle.

Marvel had a chance to do something awesome here for the fans and collectors, and they blew it imho.  They blew it so very badly.",1364860800,7,1243,4.464601769911504

5126427,2,B0083SBMGW,"To preface this review, let me state that it is in no way a comment about the films themselves. They are all wonderful. The two stars are for the packaging and content of the Collector's Set, which arrived at my door about half an hour ago.

I've had this on pre-order since it first appeared back in July of 2012. I never canceled my pre-order, so I ended up getting it for $139.99 (plus tax, now that Amazon has to comply with tax code). Would I buy it again for this price? Well, probably, because purchasing each of the film versions included individually would cost almost $200, so you're getting a great price cut on the whole set. With a savings of nearly $60, why would I only ""probably"" buy it again? Each of the discs is packaged in a glossy cardboard sleeve, and on delivery, some of my discs were already scratched from sliding. All of the disc sleeves are inserted with the sleeve openings angled towards the back of the case, resulting in sliding during shipment and storage. You can save money with this set, compared to buying each film individually, but you may end up spending more money by having to replace scratched discs. If you look at the product image, the two gaps on either side of the cosmic cube are where the film inserts slide in for storage (again, at an angle).

That brings me to the cosmic cube itself. Again, if you look at the product image, you see a very bright, solid light coming from a semi-transparent cosmic cube. The cosmic cube itself is very cheap plastic, and is heavily frosted, to the point that it looks like a solid white cube. As for the light, it emits nothing close to what is pictured. While mounted in the case, the cube is lit from below by two blue LED lights when the case is open, or when the button near the case handle is pressed (which is only useful when the case is closed, to backlight the SHIELD frosted logo on the case front, and the button must remain pressed for the backlight to activate rather than acting as an on/off switch for sustained illumination). Being backlit when mounted provides a very dim, almost imperceptible blue hue to the cube itself. When removed, the cube can be activated by ""tapping the cube firmly once against your palm"" for the first stage, and ""tapping the cube firmly a few times against your palm"" for the second stage. The first stage is never activated by a single tap, and the second stage is never activated by a few taps. Quite a few hard slaps will result in the first stage activating, which is simply a blue strobe from within the cube. The second stage is also a blue strobe, but with a faster pattern. Activation of either stage will result in a sore palm and severe disappointment.

The case itself seems sturdy, but if you're expecting it to be metallic in any way, you will be disappointed (which is a common theme with this collector's set). The case is a strong plastic, but does not have the shine and heft of a metallic case. As I said earlier, you do have a frosted SHIELD logo window on the front of the case that can be illuminated by pressing a button located near the case handle (the ""Avengers"" button seen in the product image), but it is again only illuminated when pressure on the button is maintained. It can not be turned on and set on a shelf for display purposes. The clasps have no hinge, but are simply hard plastic that must be pulled on to release. This will inevitably result in snapped clasps, as hard plastic can only be manipulated for so long before weakening. Last for the case itself, the panel that mounts the cosmic cube and the discs is a very cheap plastic. The buttons on the keypad have absolutely no give to them, as they are hard cast. There is also not as much of a color difference between the buttons and the pad itself as can be seen in the product image.

Finally for the product as a whole comes the dossiers. The dossiers are stored in the top of the case, against the frosted SHIELD window, held in place by the black panel with the ""A"" logo. This set of documents includes a ""Confidential"" sealed envelope (not pictured) that contains a ""Field Agent Access Code"" on a hard card, the size of a gift card, and a 4x6-ish holo-card with some blanked out information. I have not yet solved this puzzle, but I assume it directs you to a website where your access code can be used for additional content. The first dossier folder contains pictures and a info sheet on the cosmic cube (or the Tesseract as they call it in all of the documentation), personnel files for Hawkeye and Black Widow, and Agent Phillip Coulson's SHIELD business card. The following dossiers contain information on Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, and the Hulk, in that order. The dossiers vary by character, with references and items from each film. For example: Steve Rogers' dossier includes his 4F stamped application, physical exam sheet, some Captain America trading cards, and his drawing of Captain America as a performing monkey; Tony Stark's dossier includes a newspaper clipping, his original schematics for the Iron Man suit, a large folded schematic for the original arc reactor designed by Anton Vanko and Howard Stark, a ticket stub and guide to the Stark World Expo, and a bar napkin announcement to Stark Industries regarding the end of weapons development; Thor's dossier includes his medical bracelet, the drawing he did of the realms, Jane Foster's work badge, Thor's fake driver's license (Dr. Donald Blake), and a torn page from a children's book about Bifrost; Bruce Banner's dossier includes newspaper clippings and various other items (it's the weakest of the bunch). A certificate of authenticity is also included. Honestly, the dossiers are the most well developed and presented part of the entire collector's set.

So, back to the top: would I buy this again? Now that I've really gone through it all, I might not. I could buy the Avengers Six Disc Blu-ray Collection for $109 and save myself $30+ dollars. 3D Blu-Rays are not something I particularly need, so I wouldn't even notice the Six Disc's lack of them. I'd appreciate the protected mounting of the discs more than the scratch-prone cardboard sleeves. I'd miss the dossiers, and perhaps some of the extra material included in the set (that I haven't yet delved into), but I wouldn't miss re-purchasing films that become unwatchable due to damage. I also wouldn't miss the absolute disappointment that this Collector's Set has given me with the case and, most of all, the cosmic cube.

I can't tell you if you should buy it or not, because different people have different priorities and opinions. I can only tell you what I would do, and at this point, I have a feeling I'd do things differently, given the opportunity.",1364860800,370,6732,4.624581939799331
5126428,5,B0083SBMGW,"And here I figured it'd be just another box 'o movies, akin to what Harry Potter or Star Wars. How wrong I was.

The movies are the movies, and there are more in-depth reviews elsewhere on Amazon.

The primary features of this collection, the dossiers of the Avengers members (with many neat little items from the Phase One films and a few teasers for Phase Two), the Cosmic Cube, and the briefcase itself really sets this apart.

2. The Tesseract, Lights up when you shake/ tap on it hard. The light blinks, i wish it would just stay on steady, or slowly glow on and off. Its kinda distracting to show case an annoying blinking light.

3. Files, Comes with files on the main characters which is really nice. Plus an exclusive link to a video online for Phase 2. Which Features short clips on upcoming mavel heroes Ant Man, Thor, Iron Man and Cpt. America.

The case is made out of VERY cheap plastic and the ""interactive tesseract"" is a joke! Its a white plastic cube with a blue LED light that flashes a few times once you tap it against your palm...big deal!  The ONLY cool thing about it, are the S.H.I.E.L.D. files that are included. That's it. I already owned all of the movies, so they meant nothing to me.  In fact, I'm sure that anyone who is really interested in buying this, already has most of the movies, if not all of them.  These files are cool, but they don't justify me keeping this thing.  Its going right back to amazon just as soon as I submit this review.",1364860800,26,768,4.34965034965035
5126461,5,B0083SBMGW,"If you're interested in this set, you've most likely seen the movies.  I've actually waited on buying the blurays in anticipation of buying this.

Because of that, I'll be reviewing the packaging and extra materials that come in the briefcase and the case itself.

The case is smaller than a briefcase, much smaller.  I'm happy about that since it can go on a shelf.  It is however made of plastic and you'll have to be careful while opening it so as to not break plastic latches that just bend/flex in order to open.

The disks are slotted on either side of the cosmic cube, which is featured in the center.  There are file folders inside the top cover to the brief case.  These are fun tidbits and newspaper clippings that deal with the various characters.  They're a lot of fun and one of the main draws to this collection.

I think the cosmic cube is supposed to flash when you hit it on your hand, like one of those lightup bouncy balls.  Sadly, mine is broken.  It either shipped with dead batteries (I removed the plastic battery protective tab), or the mechanism inside is broken.

So one star off for a set that I preordered back in June of 2012 arriving in a not perfect condition.  It's been delayed 6 or 7 months, they had ample time to get things right.

Update: Apparently I wasn't hitting it hard enough.  I slammed it on my desk and it started flashing!",1364860800,,1369,4.437751004016064

Is there more than one version of this box set?

Thanks!",1364860800,,375,4.23943661971831
5126463,5,B0083SBMGW,"Just got this today, opened it and haven't been disappointed. It has plenty of cool props from the film. The top secret stuff is pretty neat.",1364860800,,141,4.461538461538462
5126464,5,B0083SBMGW,"Yes, it took forever and yes, the box is unfortunately made out of plastic. But really, for me the things inside it are beyond worth it.

There's a nice sneak peek at Phase 2 if you can figure out the little riddle they put in the box. I thoroughly enjoyed the S.H.I.E.L.D Files they put in the box and all the little details that were included. For a very hardcore fan like me, I was really interested in the in character files. Sure, none if it is really anything most of us don't know if you're big into the Marvel Universe but I just really like being able to hold and flip through Steve Roger's files and look at Coulson's report on the Thor film..

If you're just a casual fan of the Avengers films and universe, this box probably won't be worth the money to you. But I pre-ordered it and paid about $130 or so for it and I can say with all honesty, I don't regret a single thing about it. I love it and it will be cared for with the rest of my collectibles.",1364860800,4,964,4.095238095238095

5126466,4,B0083SBMGW,"Having waited over eight months to finally receive my set, I was pleased when it arrived a day earlier than the scheduled release date. I immediately went through everything in detail.

First, the packaging. It's plastic. It's a solid plastic and while I've seen other people talk about how ""cheap"" it looks, I feel that for something that's going to sit on a Blu-Ray shelf, it does the job and looks rather impressive. On the outside there's a button that says ""Avengers"" that allows you to press it and light up the SHIELD logo in the center of the briefcase. When you open it up, everything immediately lights up and stays lit up while the case is open. I would have liked to have an option to turn this off, but really, who is keeping this open for extended periods of time? (Me.) Anyway, the case runs on a couple of AAA batteries, which are included. Inside, a layer of molded plastic covers the briefcase that holds the discs in place as well as resemble the way the case looked in the movie, including ""keypad"", and ""wires"". It's all part of one large molded plastic piece, so it's only for show but it's a decent enough construction.

The discs themselves are in little slip sleeves with some fantastic art that wrap around the entire sleeve along with a synopsis of each movie next to the disc. Captain America, Thor, and Avengers are two disc sleeves housed on the left side of the case that include the movie and its 3D counterpart. Iron Man, Iron Man 2, The Incredible Hulk and the SHIELD files are in one disc sleeves and are on the right side of the case. The movie discs are the same ones that have been available for months and years and contain the exact same special features, save for the special editions of both Iron Man movies, whose second discs are both missing here. If you're a special feature completist, you'll want to make sure you acquire those discs.

The memorabilia in this set is very well done. Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, and The Hulk all have their own file that includes things such as newspaper clippings, SHIELD files, drawings the characters did in the movie, and various other fun pieces. There's a ""Donald Blake"" drivers license in Thor, as well as his hospital bracelet. In Iron Man's file, there are the four see-through pieces of paper he put together to form the Mark I armor in the cave as well as stuff like a brochure for the Stark Expo '64 and his press release napkin saying he's done making weapons, among other things. Captain America's file has a few trading cards, a newspaper picture cut out of Peggy Carter, and the drawing he did of himself as a monkey Captain America, just to name a few of the best pieces. Hulk's file is kind of sparse as there's an article about the Culver University explosion and an article about Betty Ross as the most interesting things.

There's a fifth, black file that includes some stuff about SHIELD that includes dossiers on Hawkeye and Black Widow, information about Item 47, and some various other SHIELD related material. In this file, you will also find a page that is meant to be used with the decoder that's packaged in a small envelope. That message leads you to a website where you type in a code that's found on a tag within the envelope. Once you enter that code, you are shown a five minute video that advertises Phase Two. A couple interviews with the cast and crew with Iron Man 3 are included, followed by some short looks at some behind the scenes from Thor: The Dark World. No footage is shown from any other movies, but each subsequent director (Joe and Anthony Russo from Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Edgar Wright for Ant-Man, and Joss Whedon for Avengers 2) gives a short little update about what their movie is going to be about.

The biggest downside to this set is the 10th disc. The vast majority of these special features consist of Pre-Viz and Animatics stuff, which I honestly don't find all that interesting. There are a few deleted scenes and some very small featurettes, but I was hoping that there was going to be a bit more solid information that gave true insight into the making of Phase One as a whole. I'm sure that Kevin Feige and the directors of Phase One all would have had something to say about what it was like to steer this massive ship to the success that was Avengers, but apparently they thought that we wouldn't care. Well, we do. That's why this set lost a star for me because if there were some better special features on that disc, this easily would have been a five star collection.

So should you get this? That depends. If you are interested in the aesthetic value of the set, then yes, absolutely. I don't see something getting any more comprehensive packaging other than this briefcase. But if that stuff is just fluff for you, and you already own most of these movies, then probably not. There's not much included here that isn't on any other set, and you're actually losing special features from the Iron Man sets. Unless you're a HUGE fan of pre-viz. Then you'll be in heaven.

But if this is your first time buying these movies, then I'd say go for it. It's a fantastic, well constructed set that offers superfans the opportunity to feel like they are looking through top secret files of SHIELD. The special features on most discs are pretty solid (which you can determine by reading the reviews of the individual discs) and it's awesome to be able to own these in one large collection. I only hope that I can wait to see what they come up with for Phase Two.",1364860800,43,5522,4.527054108216433

5126468,5,B0083SBMGW,"It took a while, but I've got it now and this thing is AWESOME!  The actual case is a little bit flimsier than I thought it would be, but other than that is it fantastic.  The deleted scenes and various on-disc extras are great and the assorted physical doodads (character ""dossiers"" and replicas of some on-screen papers) are an amazing amount of fun to look through.",1364774400,3,368,4.5606060606060606
5126489,2,B0083SBMGW,"Received my box of geekdom a day early, thank the maker! Other reviews have listed exactly what is in this set, so I won't go into exhaustive detail about that, suffice to say that all the SHIELD archive material contained in the folders is pretty sweet and worth paying for IMO. The case itself, eh, a little flimsy, would've been nice to make is so when you open it, it would stay open at a 90 degree angle like in the preview shots of the set instead of it opening flat, but that's not a big deal.

What I do take issue with however, is the lack of significant bonus materials. The much touted ""Exclusive"" material is rather boring for the most part. I also think that this set is made for collectors, and as such it would probably be safe to assume that most of us who bought it or want to buy it, already own most of the movies in one form or another. I personally already owned all the films with the exception of the Avengers.  So with that in mind, I find it pretty insulting that all the movie discs are identical to the ones that have been available since day one. Come on, for this ultimate box set that's carrying a MSRP of over $200, a little extra effort on the main course is to be expected. I'm not talking a lot, I'm thinking some custom art on the disc itself and tweaking the disc menus to create a cohesive experience (tell me you're not sick of seeing the endless barrage of boring solid blue and gray movie discs). I really don't think that's too much to ask. The special features are most lacking on the Iron Man movies, as both discs are clearly labeled ""Disc 1"", so I'm obviously missing out on discs 2 for both of these movies. I'd much rather have the extra features than 3D versions of the last 3 movies in the set, because I have no burning desire to have a 3D entertainment system. So great job Marvel, in making your ultimate box set, you've instantly made me regret selling my other copies in order to buy this set.

I know this is a set for geeks, and I do really like it, but don't you think it's a little ridiculous that you just repackaged the exact same discs, left out a couple, slapped together a lame bonus disc and some promo materials in a $15 dollar case and expect everyone to pay top dollar for it? Especially considering the long wait time we've had for this set, which I know was beyond Marvel's control (and to which Amazon handled beautifully), it was promised that this set would be worth the wait. I am not so sure it was.",1364774400,12,2473,4.257446808510639
5126490,5,B0083SBMGW,"Let me start off by saying I'm a HUGE Marvel fan.  This set is INCREDIBLE.  The extra bonus ""files"" contain some really cool items.  One of the most surprising items was a black envelope labeled confidential.  I opened that first and there weren't any instructions. I then opened up the individual files, and sure enough, there is a ""secret"" message with instructions of what you need to do.  I'm not going to give away any secrets, but I will say you need to have an internet connection.  This was a very awesome surprise.

One of the things I loved about this set is that all the items in the files made the movies seem more ""real"".  I mean, there are reproductions from the movie that are very obvious, and some that only a die hard marvel fan will understand and appreciate.

If you have all the movies already, you're basically paying for all the extra material.  My wife would say it wasn't worth it, I on the other hand think it is.  There wasn't that much in the way of extra deleted scenes and extra movie footage to justify $150.  But there is extra stuff here, and it definitely completes Phase One.

If you do not own the movies yet, this set is a complete bargain!!  You get all the movies, in blu-ray format (as well as the Thor, Capt America, and Avengers in 3D).

The extras really make this set a true joy for a serious fan.  But if you just ""like"" the movies, and you already own them, then skip this and save your cash.  But if you're a serious fan like me, and you absolutely love these movies, do yourself a favor and get this set.  You will NOT be disappointed.

Another earlier review stated that this set contains the fake drivers license that Dr. Selvig gave Shield to get Thor out of detention.  Oh, that is in there, but that's not all!!  There is a TON of stuff!!  And each movie has it's own ""file"" with many reproductive trinkets.

Thank you Marvel for producing such a nice package for your true fans.  I really appreciate it!!",1364774400,2,1958,4.375
5126491,4,B0083SBMGW,"INSIDE THE CASE
I was quite surprised to get home and find my Avengers Collection waiting for me on my front porch...a day before it was released.  THANKS AMAZON!!!  Amazon did a great job at packaging this with one protective box packed inside another.  Once I finally got all the boxed open, I saw the shiny briefcase and the colorful Cover box.  As i was trying to get the briefcase out, I accidentally tapped a button, and the shield lit up on the front of the case.....very coooool!!  The case itself looks very nice, and is well-constructed.  Now I have the thing out of the cover box, and am ready to open it.  One minor problem here.  Instead of actual latches on the case, they just sort of snap shut. No biggie, but a minor disappointment.  I lift the lid, and the inside of the briefcase is flooded with a cool blue light, both on the lid and underneath.  The teseract is nesting right in the middle with a cool blue glow around it.  I take the cube out of the box, and notice it is plastic wrapped.  Once the plastic is off, I pull out the battery saver tab and sit waiting for something to happen.  There was no visible switch or anything, so I just guess that I must have to supply my own batteries.  I'll come back to that later.  The bottom part of the case has three-dimensional wires, and circuits, and key pads.  The movies are arranged with the 3-D movies on the left, and the 2-D movies on the right.  I thought that was a neat way to organize them.  The bonus disc is also on the right.

INSIDE THE LID
The lid has a very snazzy holder with the Avengers logo on it, and there are some folders enclosed here.  The first thing you see is a smaller black envelope with ""confidential"" on the front, and ""open immediately"" on the back.  Of course, I do as I'm told.  Inside is an odd looking lenticular sheet with a couple of black and white images in the corners, and some other open windows on it......hmmmm strange.  There is also a nifty little badge with a bar code on one side and ""Field Agent Access Code"" on the other.  There are no instructions as to what to do with this code.....hmmmm stranger. OK, if you want to know what this if for, keep reading.  However, if you would rather enjoy the fun of discovering what this is for, skip to after ""SPOILER ENDS""  OK.........

SPOILER BEGINS!!!!!!!!  OK, if you don't care anything about figuring this out on your own, here's the skinny.  In the black folder, you will find a sheet titled Item 47 Recovered.  Now take your little lenticular sheet thingy and line it up with the two images in the upper left and lower right corners.  Through the little windows you will now be able to read the message that tells you where to go to input this code.  When you get to the site put the code in, fill out the information, and a 5 minute preview begins of Phase 2 of the Avengers Universe.  Let's just say, we're in for a FANTASTIC next couple of years with some AWESOME looking movies.  I'm sure there will be more on this site later on, but that's about all there is at this point...................
OK, SPOILER ENDS.....................

Now, back to the folders.
There is a total of five separate folders.
  * Black folder - This has some info about the Tesseract, along with some dossiers on Clint Barton and Black Widow.  Your certificate of authenticity is also in this folder, although it simply states ""One of a Limited Edition"" no number.  I really prefer a numbered edition, but that's just my preference.  There is also an instruction sheet for replacing batteries in both the case lid and the Tesseract.

  *  Captain America - photo of Steven Rogers, various military documents, trading cards, and an interesting drawing apparently torn from a composition notebook.

  *  Tony Stark - Newspaper article ""Who is the Iron Man?"", blue prints, Lots of other neat little items. (don't want to give it all away)

  *  Bruce Banner - Newspaper article, lecture notes, and other cool items.

  *  Thor - a yellow ID bracelet, strange drawings, drivers license (cool), and some other items

Someone spent some time to make all of the memorabilia in these folders look authentic.  If you're a geek for bonus features like I am, then you should enjoy thumbing through these folders as much as I did.  Oh yeah!!  I also found the instructions for how to activate the Tesseract....when all else fails....read the instructions.

THE DISCS
Ok, now this is where I was a little let down.  I hate it when I sell all of my individual movies to fund purchase of a nice box set like this, only to find out that not all of the bonus features were ported over.  This is a problem only for Iron Man and Iron Man 2.  Both of these movies seem to be simply the first disc of the 2-disc set of blu-rays.  The 7 part doc from Iron Man was nowhere to be found, and NONE of the bonus features from Iron Man 2, Disc 2 are included.  Both 1 & 2 are labeled ""Disc One"", so it looks to me like they just took the current discs out of the 2-disc blu ray and tossed the 2nd disc.  As far as I can tell, all of the others have the features from the original release.  OK, so maybe these extras are what is on the elusive SHIELD disc???????  Sorry....but NO.  That disc simply contains from intros to each film, deleted scenes, animatics, and Pre viz stuff.  That's about it.  I thought, ""Maybe they've ported them over to BD-Live.....ummmmm NO.  The failure to include these two discs is a total mystery to me.  Why would you want a ""complete"" set of movies when two of the discs full of special features is not included?????  That's what keeps this from getting a full 5-star rating.  Some may think I'm nit picking, but it just really aggravates me when I see a set that has been sooooooo long coming to arrive with a less than perfect landing.  While this was not a problem for me, it could be for some.  There are also no digital copies of any of the movies in this set.

FINAL WORDS
So, that's it for my take on this set.  The case if very cool, the folders are so authentic looking, and HOLY CRAP....There's a freaking glowing blue cube in the middle.....what else do you need??  If you do get this, don't throw out disc 2 from both Iron Man movies, or you'll be as disappointed as I am.  Never fear, this set is so freaking cool, it almost makes me want to give it a full 5 star rating anyway.  Naaaaah...don't think so.",1364774400,28,6371,4.384417808219178
5126492,3,B0083SBMGW,"I was skeptical after watching the clumsy unboxing video from IGN.com, but I was excited regardless I was getting this product for a lower price. Also, I didn't have any of these movies yet. I'm also a Comic book geek and I love fanyboy stuff like the next movie swag horder. So I let that video slide and....
Awesome! my package came a day early (April Fools 2013). Time to open up!

Upon opening, my Cube so far does not work. I don't know if it's just bad/dead batteries or the thing could be broken. I've performed the instructions, strange as they sound, and still nothing. The case lights up, which is neat. I should order for a replacement, but...I personally don't care at the moment because it's more about the movies and special features. the Cube probably would have broken in the future anyway. Yes, most of the overall case is just hard plastic that does seem flimsy. Well, it's thematic to say the least. the handle for the case is tiny. I mean really tiny. It's like it was made for a child's hand to hold it comfortably. Or maybe it was made that small so you can have the case light up...but it's pretty uncomfortable. The swag stuff inside each folder are...awesome and funny. There is no way a fan of Marvel comics can't get any enjoyment out of this stuff. One could make their own S.H.I.E.L.D. related home videos. My wife and I had fun going through each folder and I can't wait to show them to my friends. It's geektastic.

Now for the geek gripe. As much as I appreciate the effort (and ingenuity) of creating the secret way of showing off the Iron Man 3 sneak peek, Blu-Rays are supposed to be able to store 25gigabytes of data. Why not just put all of the sneak peek videos on there? Even after watching the video on ""S.H.I.E.L.D. website, it made me wish there was more added besides very little new deleted and extended scenes. For example, anybody who didn't go to comic con, wondercon, whatever, did you know that they did a test video shot of the Ant-Man movie? Now, that would have been awesome if they put that on there! Speaking of that S.H.I.E.L.D. Avengers Initiative blu-ray disc...it's really bland content-wise. On the back of the slip case for the product states that the disc is ""filled with never-before-seen deleted scenes, extended scenes, featurettes, and more!"" What featurettes? Unless I'm blind, there really isn't anything ""behind the scenes"" or cool like comic book hero history featurettes and documentaries like what is on my Iron Man special editions. It's actually a real bummer. At least they did add the special AMC movie marathon introductions presented Agent Coulson (I probably got that wrong). Of course that also made me wish that they added those special introductions to each of my current Blu-ray copies to make viewing them extra special.

And of course, my final gripe to this whole entire package, is the fact that the 3D Blu-rays (to me) I wish they were DVDs instead. I don't own a 3D blu-ray player/TV and probably won't for quite some time. DVD copies of at least 3 of the movies would have been nice if my PS3 ever died on me. Or...I don't know, make amends for having people pay over $100 on Amazon, and give us digital copies....or credit for digital comics...or something....

But overall, it is a very nice movie marathon package if you are thinking about getting this as a gift for somebody, especially for the mega Marvel Comics nerd. If more had been put on that bonus disc, it would helped...well that and my cube actually working.

Literally 2 days before this was shipped to me, I thought I would do a little math to see what I'm getting vs buying each one brand new through amazon.com.
My cost for this order was $139.99. Please not that I am a Prime member if this affects that.
Current price for this is listed at $149.49 (prime members) and other listed price is $219.99
Buying each movie new (including movies that contained digital and DVDs) $145ish total on amazon.com
But as I mentioned, I'm actually happy because I finally have my copies of the Phase One of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I'll probably do the same thing for the next one... if they offer more oomph to the media part next time.

** my Cube is working! Sort of. I think when you read you tap it. it means to REALLY tap it so you can feel something vibrate to make it light up. Of course I took the battery case off and tapped it hard the first time and it lit up flashing. kinda neat, but not sure if I'm supposed to be hitting it that hard. But oh well, it works sort of now.**",1364774400,18,4536,4.518879415347137

Iv never seen a better for value for money edition with all these extras. 20 gbp per film people are complaining about but its not is it. Unless you say 20 per film with a free case tesseract and around 5 props from EACH movie. And 4 bonus disks. Including extra unknown stuff.

But, I bought a 4 disc Set of Avengers.  Why don't I get the DVD, a UV copy and the music CD?  It just doesn't seem to make sense.",1363564800,2,415,4.2025316455696204
5126497,5,B0083SBMGW,"Look, the people rating this thing 1 star or whatever are ridiculous. Who cares if Marvel changed suitcases? Why should ANYONE care about a lawsuit that doesn't involve them? Why should anyone but the parties involved even know any of the reasons things were changed? Are they going to a part of the settlement money or something? No. It's like investing in a stock and getting mad at a company for firing an employee. It's not my concern and as long as I get what I want, I'm happy.
Sadly, most nerds will tell you what they DON'T like before they tell you what they DO. Complaining about the price? Ok, don't buy one. Obviously this is for people with the extra income to get something cool. Why try to make others hate it because YOU do? I probably won't even watch all of them. I didn't really care about Hulk, but I'm still excited for the entire set. I don't want this review to be a personal attack against people who rated this, but I'm confused by the amount of people upset over something that isn't out. It's like getting mad about a movie when all you've seen is the teaser trailer.
There is a replica of the Tesseract and a cool suitcase to go with it! This has AMAZING art by Matthew Ferguson plus all the movies in HD 3-D, Blu-Ray! For crying out loud, what an awesome gift for yourself!
Will I cry if the box is cheap? No, cause I'm a true nerd who thinks all the extra stuff is totally cool. How can a metal case with a tesseract and SHIELD files laying around, not be an eye opening ice breaker for conversation.
These movies were fun and now you get them in the best definition available along with other cool stuff.
I'm rating this 5 stars just for the pure effort in the company for making something this cool when truly, they didn't have to. They could have bundled them in a box with a hologram sticker and said, ""Here. Neat, huh?""

As for the case I wish it had been made f aluminum instead of plastic but even then its pretty neat and all the extra stuff you get with the set is awesome to sit there and play with them while watching the movies so if you don't have the individual movies then get this set, we had most of the BluRay version so we gave them all to my wife's sister to watch and keep and we kept the movies in this set for our collection

5126520,5,B0083SBMGW,"A combination of the 6 Phase One movies for Marvel, it is also chock full of exclusive special features such as a sneak peek at Iron Man 3.",1360368000,5,139,4.0
5126521,4,B0083SBMGW,"As I went through and read the one star comments I am briefly going to say you should read more thoroughly .... just saying....your comments have answers to them(e.i. the very first comment that is 5 stars and I believe is the one that originally shows when you are on this page). Anyway I am pretty excited for this to finally come out. I think it is completely worth the money if you are a true fan plus they are Blu-ray and Blu-ray 3D. Only half are 3D because they others are before that time. But if you are just wanting all the movies then find them used. As a Marvel and a movie fanatic I cannot wait to watch all of them with and without commentary even though I would rather hear it from the actors. :) Also, to note and an update for those who don't know what your getting. In a recent preview Marvel/Disney are giving everyone a sneak peek of the entire phase 2 set. From Iron Man 3 to Ant-Man with many Easter Eggs to follow. Also, just noticed that apparently, all phase 2 will be on a separate disc.
So to recap on everything that your getting:

1. All 6 Marvel Films (Iron Man/Iron Man 2/ Incredible Hulk/ Thor/ Captain America/Avengers.
2. All Blu-ray (Thor/Captain America/ Avengers in 3D as well)
3. Many collectables to the movies and characters.
4. Sneak peeks into Phase 2 (Iron Man 3/Thor 2/ Captain America 2/ Guardians of the Galaxy/ Avengers 2/ Ant-Man)
5. Also Easter Eggs hinting towards what you will see in Phase 2.
6. A ton of features

So now that this has finally been released I must say a little bit of a disappointment.
Suitcase: its plastic with blue l.e.d's to light it up. (could have gone without it) honestly, after buying each one of these separately it would be close to $100 so therefore you are paying about 50 for the case and the extras.
Exclusive look: not on actual disc you have to go to a website and watch a minute preview. I was hoping for a bit more definitely since Iron Man 3 is so close to coming out.
Files: These were probably the best part out of the entire set minus the movies bc duh. In each file you get a piece of movie prop that was seen in the movies. (personally would have paid 50 for just that)
Movies: As advertised 3 blu-ray and 3 blu-ray and 3d blu-ray. I will say all features for the movies (minus iron man and iron man 2) are on feature movie disc. If you are wanting the extra stuff for Iron Man 1&2 you will have to buy separately.
Overall: buy it if you don't own any of them probably the best way to go definitely if your not too picky about the features. Worth the 150? I think so. Worth the 219? not at all. I will add that there are definitely better set that have came out  (31 disc set of HP) but still good.",1360108800,9,2692,4.223300970873787
5126522,4,B0083SBMGW,"Don't get me wrong- I plan to get this set. But I must point out something that irks me when they do these character's head/glowing egg/briefcase eye candy releases. First, they really don't ever become valuable collector pieces worth hundreds more than you'll pay when released. Just keep dreaming on that point. In person, this case and it's innards will look significantly less impressive, but it's got that 'celebrate our geekiness' draw regardless (My BladeRunner case is displayed proudly, thank you very much).

More than the above, tho, I'm bothered by the storage of the discs. See, I actually watch them. And after viewing one, it goes back into its plastic case (or steelbook) and onto my DVD/Bluray shelving... where this case will either gobble up real estate, or simply not fit at all. Regardless, I don't want to have to handle the case everytime I watch a disc. The briefcase will be in a display case, to look at. The actual DISCS should- SHOULD- be able to meld onto my shelves as a 'normal' release would. Little, flat cardboard sleeves would deteriorate quickly in handling and shuffling about...and are so thin, they'll be near-invisible on the shelf between other cases.

I'm taking too long to make my point, sorry. What we deserve here is a proper plastic case- even a slimcase- for each film in the set, with proper artwork inserts... and maybe an outer, open-faced paper/cardboard box (this could be included 'flat' for us to fold-open ourselves. Or make my head spin with a full-thickness steelbook for every individual film in the set. Charge a bit more to cover the expense- we'll pay it.

See, I built a shelf system onto my wall- and each shelf allows for the standard DVD case height plus 1 inch, and about a half-inch of extra depth. It's a library, and my DVD/Blurays are stored there in alphabetical order (this set would simply be filed as ""Avenegers""). Maybe others just haphazardly store their discs all over the house, so this briefcase will land under the futon because it won't physically integrate with the other normal releases folks own. I'm not that guy.

I'll buy it anyway, yes, but come on- this can go from a great set to a PERFECT set with just a bit of thought about real world storage and usage.",1358985600,6,2247,4.739130434782608

The retail price of this didn't change.  Those who pre-ordered early got discounted pricing.  Deep discounted pricing.  If you weren't able to pre-order early or read the retail listing to determine your purchase date, don't complain through a review.

Amazon and Marvel did not screw us with a delay.  Those who ordered before the lawsuit got the blu-ray of Avengers FOR FREE.  That was fantastic service on their part.  It shows that they weren't interested in ripping money from us.  We didn't have to buy Avengers twice while waiting.  Thank you!

You're not paying a lot per movie.  If you want the movies, go buy them separately.  I'm sure there's plenty good sales on them this month.  If you want a COLLECTOR'S SET, buy this.  Your money is paying for useless, fun, fanboy crap.  And for fanboys, it's awesome.

As for the new stuff they added; you already were going to pay for the other stuff.  Now, you're getting a bit extra.  Between that and the free blu-ray, we are not getting screwed and there's no way you can rate the quality of that material without seeing it.

If you love the movies and are a fanboy with some extra cash, I can't see the downside.  Whatever happened between the parties of the lawsuit doesn't matter at this point.

(I've been waiting for this since Iron Man came out in May of 2008, a few more months wouldn't kill me). But this ""new"" Marvel box set is disappointing. Fundamentally it's the same. It is a case with movies and a teseract, but it leaves a lot to be desired.

When the case was first delayed in Marvel's response (it was just a response to the delay itself. I am STILL waiting for a legitimate apology from Marvel and Disney) they said that the case would have even more content than the original, which I foolishly believed. The ""new exciting content"" is just a handful of 1 minute deleted scenes that would end up on the internet a week after the release, and a bunch of concept art and behind the scenes of future Marvel movies. So instead of getting something ""new"", we get some alternate scenes so uninteresting that they didn't even make it onto the special features of their respective releases, and what basically amounts to a bill from Marvel that we'll pay whenever we see the new movies.

This set is supposed to celebrate the achievement of the existing Marvel Cinematic Universe, while also thanking the fans who have been throwing money at the theaters for the past 5 years. It's not supposed to be giving us ""exciting new footage"" from a movie that will be released a month after this box ships.

Fans who ordered this as soon as the pre-order hit amazon will receive this 10 months after ordering. And they are rewarded for their patience and dedicated patronage by having Marvel try their best to suck out hundreds of more dollars from their dedicated fan base. This is a despicable, condescending joke, and I will most likely cancel my order, pop in my free copy of The Avengers that Amazon was nice enough to give me, and try to pick up the rest of the movies at a black friday sale.

5126574,5,B0083SBMGW,"Get ready for Marvel's Phase One, take two.

The comic book studio's 10-disc, 6-movie box set of films, spanning from 2008's Iron Man to last May's The Avengers, was put on hold in September due to a lawsuit over its suitcase packaging but now the collectors package (featuring a different case, but the same glowing Tesseract cube) is heading back into stores.
The Blu-ray set will go back on pre-sale later today, for release on April 2, 2013, and EW has learned the exclusive details about some of its new components.

Marvel used the downtime to add a showcase of the studio's upcoming Phase Two slate of movies to Marvel's Cinematic Universe: Phase One.

And the set will also include deleted scenes from each of the past films, such as this variation on the ending to Thor, with a rooftop Natalie Portman sending out the most long-distance ""I miss you"" message in history.
In the original ending to Thor, Chris Hemsworth's hammer-wielding hero stands at the edge of a cliff in his celestial realm of Asgard, peering off into the galactic distance as he wonders about his lost love, Jane Foster. We see a shot of her gathering up equipment, and the all-seeing sentry Heimdall tells him she is looking for him.

The end credits play out over a beam of light traveling from Earth through various star systems and nebulae, ending at the shimmering towers of Asgard. But in the scene above we learn that Jane was the source of that skyward blast.

""We went back to the editor's assembly of each film and discovered some rare moments that dropped out of the films early on and had not been released on prior discs,"" Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige tells EW.

He said part of the fun of putting together the set was highlighting all the little hidden references they put in the films, allowing fans ""to catch the connective tissue that paved the way toward the Avengers assembling.""

""We spent an embarrassing amount of time compiling the `Shield Files' included in the box set to be sure that each character's file was full of great, movie-accurate props and Easter eggs, which help tie all of the Phase one [Marvel Comics Universe] films together,"" Feige said.
Even more compelling for fans in the $219 set is a chance to look ahead to Marvel's Phase Two, which starts in May with Iron Man 3 and includes Thor: The Dark World, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy and, of course, The Avengers 2.

Obviously, some of those films are closer to completion than others, but Feige was mum about what will actually be included, saying only that the Phase Two preview would include ""footage, concept art, and a few new surprises. Also, look for a nod to Iron Man 3 in the Tony Stark S.H.I.E.L.D. file in the box set.""
As we know from last summer's Comic-Con, there is already test-footage of Ant-Man and concept art from Guardians of the Galaxy, and Marvel still has plenty of time to add more to the collection.

Of course, if this set takes much longer to reach fans, they might be able to include elements of Phase Three.

I am so excited for this!!! I've been waiting for these news forever! The only thing, though, I wish they would drop the price back to $140. What do you think of these news?",1353369600,11,3222,4.626970227670753
5126575,3,B0083SBMGW,"My original review:

Sorry, but the thrill is gone. Thanks Disney for not securing the rights from Rimowa to reproduce their case. I'm sure if you asked and paid a fee it would have happened. As it is with Iron Man and Captain America sequels filming the 6 movie edition will be outdated before they can get it together.

Next time, Roger, do the right thing and that way everyone will be happy.

Had to give one star because no option for none. BTW love all the movies, just hate being put through this.

Update:

 I bought it. Won't be tossing my other editions out, however. As has been stated in other reviews the bonus discs for Iron Man 1 + 2 are missing. Thor, Captain America and Avengers included the 3D disc. So a rundown of what else is missing from this set: The DVDs and Digital Copies. Well, if you don't like it, step up and get a Blu-Ray player. They are cheap and can play DVDs too, in case you didn't know. The only thing that could have been included is the Soundtrack from the Avenger set.

As for the case, yes it is kind of flimsy and not really up to anyone's expectations. I didn't bother unwrapping the  ttesseract, I've already seen it isn't worth it. The glowing when you open the case is pretty nice, however. As for the handle being ornamental and not functioning, who over the age of 10 is really going to want to carry this around like it was a briefcase? I do agree with the complaint about the clasps. I can almost see someone flipping the latches while it was standing on it's side and everything falling out as it fell open. The ones on the Blade Runner case were much better.

Now we could complain about the price, but, as has been stated in another review, the breakdown in cost comes out to $25 a movie. Not really so bad as 3 are 3D and can only be had by shelling out about $30 per set for them. So you get all the movies and a plastic box to store them, not really as bad as I had anticipated

Now, I know that I'm a hypocrite for buying this after crapping about the awful treatment Disney handed us about the redesigned case, which delayed the release for 7 months. So be it. I still like all the movies and only double dipped because I could afford it. I am leaving my original review intact so more aspergions can be heaped on me.

I have upped my stars and changed my title because I got three things I didn't have before, The Hulk, Thor 3D+2D and Captain America 3D.",1350432000,6,2414,4.237472766884531

Just measured the box an there's no way it will fit all 6 blurays inside unless you get some sort of Captain America Shield styled zipper case.  It's too narrow for two rows and too short to stack 6 blurays into...which really really sucks cuz that would've been a sweet alternative...anyway, i've edited my review to omit talking about putting the individual dvds inside.....

I just picked up the Best Buy Exclusive Gift Box of The Avengers today.  Best Buy has a limited number of these and some sold out when they opened at Midnight on the 25th.  However, I can say that the box is pretty nice.

You get a wooden large box with an embossed 3D ""The Avengers"" title on the bottom of the lid with a large colored 3D picture of the group. Above this and behind is backlit by clicking a button on the lower right of the lid.

Inside is the 4-disc version of the film (3D, Bluray, DVD, Special Features/downloadable music cd/digital copy), 200+ page detailed Marvel Comic Book Characters book with every character and their description from the Marvel Universe, a $30 giftcard to Sideshow Collectibles, and a lithograph 7x9"" card.

The Best Buy box won't last very long, one location I went to was sold out already, and if you don't want to wait until (maybe) just before Iron Man 3 comes out for who knows what kind of case, this case is really nice.

This series sets up the first half of Whedon's vision for the Marvel cinematic future, with the Thanos (the purple-skinned bad guy that was finally revealed at the end of the Avengers) being the series' primary antagonist in coming features.  (Whedon seems to be leading things up to Marvel's classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Infinity-Gauntlet/dp/0785156593/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Infinity Gauntlet</a>&nbsp;cross-over in the second half.)  I'm going to be reviewing the special edition packaging (Each of the individual movies already has a number of great reviews if you haven't seen any of the individual productions).

You'll probably note some sour reviews about this particular set being cancelled (which is finally not true).  The set was originally slated to release in in 2012 (with an original preorder of summer 2012).  Long story short (as far as I can tell) is that the company that designed the original case did so believing that it was intended to be a one-time promotional piece rather than a mass-produced limited edition item.  Rather than get caught up in legal troubles over this, Marvel decided to redesign the case and rerelease it.  The new case finally delivered in April 2013.

The redesigned case is pretty neat with a look that resembles brushed aluminum (its plastic), with a shield decal (that lights up when you hit a button on the top) and a recessed handle.  I've seen some complaints about how durable the case seems to be, but I don't have a problem with it.  It is light as you would expect, however I never planned to use it as a checked bag in an airport.  It feels like it will last perfectly fine as a shelf-piece in your collection if that is what you intend.

When you open the case you get a plastic replica tesseract set inside a plastic mount that looks sort of like the one in the movie.  The opened case lights up the shield logo and a glow behind the tesseract.  The tesseract also comes out and lights up on its own (if you didn't find the card you have to give it a firm smack with the palm of your hand before it lights up).

The movies are in simple cardboard sleeves with cool art-deco renditions of the characters involved.  There are a total of 7 packages including the following 10 discs:
Avengers - Blu-ray, 3D Blu-ray
Thor - Blu-ray, 3D Blu-ray
Captain America - Blu-ray, 3D Blu-ray
Iron Man - Blu-ray
Iron Man - 2 Blu-ray
Incredible Hulk - Blu-ray
S.H.I.E.L.D. Avengers Initiative bonus disc

I didn't have all of the movies (I held off when I saw this set was coming out), but if you have the single versions I did you're only going to be missing the digital copies and DVD copies (neither of which I have any need for).  If you really like special features, they are at least missing the second (bonus) disc from the Iron Man 2 disc Blu-ray set (one of the few that I did already have).

The case also comes with a series of folders filled with fictional bios, and some trinkets from the movies (some of which are fairly detailed replicas from the film--newspaper clippings, sketches, blu-prints, ID-cards, etc.).

My personal verdict:
You probably already know if you are the intended audience of the briefcase Phase I set.  I've got a couple of limited edition movie collectables and in terms of quality I would rank this as being on par with most of them.  If you don't have the movies and currently want them, it's honestly not a huge splurge from your entertainment budget.  Even if you aren't considering the case, included extras, 3D copies, and special features disc the cost at the time of this writing is $150/6 blu-ray movies = $25 per movie.

If you are thinking of purchasing the set for young children I would rethink the expense; I think the durability of the case is just fine, but it most likely wouldn't hold up long to the punishment of young children.

Note: (If you're confused by some of the comments to this review) When Marvel withdrew the first version of the set the Amazon page went blank.

Disney/Marvel had to pay to use the briefcase in the movie and the German company got a pretty decent amount but when they realized that they were mass producing these suitcases and they were gonna be leftout the saw the loss of $$$$$$$$.

5126622,5,B0083SBMGW,"My pre-order was placed on June 3rd and like many people here, I was literally doing a day countdown up to this point. I've heard the bad news a couple of hours ago (not by Amazon, found out for myself on a webpage). What can I say? It was a knock out hit, completely ruined my week and broke all my illusions.
Sure, the single DVD/Blu-ray pack is still coming out on September 25th, but that's not the point. I LOVED the movie, as much as I loved all the superheroes in their individual ones. As soon as I saw this Collector's Edition three months ago, I knew I had to own one of them, it was a no brainer. I believe that when you really enjoy a movie (or saga, in this case), you've got to go for the best there is in the market.
The Avengers briefcase was gorgeous for what could be seen in photos and videos, but unlike some users, I preferred to wait and keep from doing a review until I had the product in my hands. Now, that I know it's not gonna happen for at least another 6 months, I feel free to use this space to let my disappointment out:

-Marvel/Disney: I can't understand how they could let such a childish thing happen to the highest grossing superhero movie of all time! What were they thinking??!! How is it possible that they could forget something as important as a license authorization for the packaging?? The people in charge of the Company's Legal Department should be fired (at least). What bothers me the most is that there's still no official statement of the situation at Marvel's homepage. What a lack of information! I'm planning on writing to them to get some answers.
-Amazon: All I wanna know is why I haven't received an e-mail as soon as the delay/cancellation was confirmed. I wasn't supposed to find this out anywhere else, customers should have been notified by you! I'm not cancelling the pre-order just because I expect to get some kind of additional data in future days.
-Rimowa (the accuser): OK, I know that this company is in it's rights to file a suit if they consider that this briefcase resembles theirs, but, did they really need to take legal actions just a few weeks before the release date?? I mean, Come on! This product has been on display for little more than THREE MONTHS!

Well, there's nothing else to do now except going for the single Blu-ray release, which I'll enjoy anyway because I know what the movie is like, but I shall receive the package with a bitter-sweet felling.

I'm rating 5 stars because that's what I was hoping for.",1347148800,3,2493,4.43886462882096

It doesn't go into precisely why all this happened, but an earlier report from TheHDRoom noted a legal squabble between Marvel and Rimowa, the company that apparently created the metallic briefcase it was based on, and subsequently sued Marvel and Disney's home video arm, Buena Vista Home Entertainment for trademark infringement and the like.

Details and pictures of this item were out as early as June, and they should have taken action then. Perhaps then, instead of leaving fans in a lurch, it could have either been re-packaged in enough time for the September 25th release date, or a deal could have been worked out.  As a fan, I'm disappointed that to continue with my original plans for the release, I've had to buy each film separately on Blu-Ray, and will either have to dish out more money for the collectors edition released in the Spring, or miss out on Special Features and Collectible items.

Amazon in the meantime, has only posted a message on the webpage, and didn't bother to send an email with news of the delay and the reasons. I was not pleased to discover it second hand on facebook, and as a paying customer I should have been informed immediately that the release date is now indefinite.

Despite these issues, I won't allow them to detract from my rating. The Avengers is the crown jewel of the cinematic universe, with perfect casting and perfect filming. It's the only movie I have never had a complaint about when I left the theatre. If this set ever ships, I will enjoy the full universe for a long time to come.",1346976000,,1060,4.786885245901639

Instead, they tried to get around paying the creator of the case, Rimowa. It is not Rimowa's fault this is happening. It is Disney's and Marvel's. Now Disney/Marvel screws the fans and the multiple thousands of sets already made with the cool case, will be opened and shoved either in an Iron Man case or something similar then re sealed and offered for sale.

5126667,5,B0083SBMGW,"I have seen many a cool collector's movie set, even owned a couple, but I would have to say that this is probably the coolest collectable movie set I ever remember seeing...or, as it were, owning!  Of course, I am also a big fan of every movie in this set...I have not ever seen a series of Superhero based movies as cool as Ironman through The Avengers, shy of maybe the Dark Knight movies, but even those take a number 2 slot to several of these films, most especially The Avengers.  I do like many a comic book based movie, but the Avengers Assemble series of movies has thus far been my favorite.

I thought the Tessyract was a really cool thing, and the fact that this set comes in a replica of the S.H.I.E.L.D. briefcase that it was carried around in is pretty sweet...and to have a replica of the Tessyract actually on the inside of it too is wicked cool!  I like how the movie discs come in cases with collectible artwork on them, and the dossiers with all the bonus pictures and content & whatnot is pretty sweet too...all kinds of neat stuff in there.  Being the huge fan I am of these movies, and not to mention Joss Whedon, who directed The Avengers and came up with the primary design for this set, I was all over this!

The films, like I said, are all awesome!  The set comes with many great features and collectibles.  I already mentioned the artwork on the movie cases, as well as the briefcase and the Tessyract, and you can tell from the picture that it all lights up, which is super cool.  I shut off some lights the evening of the day I got it and gazed upon it...pretty cool.  It comes with a bunch of dossiers filled with neat stuff like a replica of a napkin that Tony Stark wrote a message on, information on certain things contained with in the movies and character bios, sketches, etc.  You even get your own S.H.I.E.L.D. pass card.  There are sneak peaks of Ironman 3 and of Phase 2, which admittedly I have not yet watched, but I will.  All in all, super cool!

The only one thing I can see about this set that might be a bummer for some people would be that this set apparently doesn't contain the digital copies of the films...only the regular Blu-Ray copies, as well as the 3D copies of those that were filmed in it (ie Thor, Captain America, and The Avengers).  I for one don't have a 3D TV or anything, but one day I or someone I know might, so I certainly don't mind having the 3D copies.  For those of you who never bought the original Blu-Rays of each movie with digital copies and were hoping for digital copies, you may want to decide whether or not you want to buy this if the digital copies are a big deal to you.  For me, they are not, because between my wife and I, other than my Ps3, we only have 1 laptop...and we both don't really care to fill it up with a bunch of movies anyway.  Even so, I would still have jumped at the chance to own this set!  But it's all up to you.

That aside though, all in all, I think this is a totally epic collector's set, and I am totally stoked to own it...perfect for any bigtime Marvel fan!  It's amazing!  My hat off to Marvel and Joss Whedon and whoever else had a hand in creating this set, and to all that worked on the creation of these movies...super great job!

5126670,4,B0083SBMGW,I am looking forward to this series in Blu-ray.  Especially the last three are in 3D.  One question though.  Why do so many mention digital copy?  If you have the disc you can make a digital copy in 20 to 30 minutes.,1344297600,5,216,4.071428571428571
5126671,5,B0083SBMGW,"To begin with, I already own all 5 movies leading up to The Avengers.  That being said, when I purchased the previous versions I only sprung for the regular DVD format, knowing that a box set such as this would be released on BluRay.  I know, I know... my logic seems flawed here as there will be more movies and a second Avenger's film.  Nevertheless, I am quite excited to get the complete collection on BluRay in a nifty-looking package.  I have preordered this set, as well as plan to purchase all subsequent films on DVD until the second box set is released featuring all movies in BluRay after The Avengers.

Then a second such box set will be released, and I again will be excited to purchase the next box set.

***SIDE NOTE*** Joss Whedon, please find a way to bring Firefly back.  Loved that show, and was sad to see it go.",1344211200,26,832,4.363636363636363
5126672,2,B0083SBMGW,"Apparently I have to spell it out, so here's a re-edit of my review to clarify...

I HAVE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHECK OUT THE PRODUCT PERSONALLY. THIS IS NOT SPECULATION OR A MADE UP OPINION. That fact should be implied by the mere existence of a review, but it seems angry people at their keyboards want to assume otherwise. I am not at liberty to say how or why or where I had an opportunity to see it. If that bothers you, I recommend some sort of aroma therapy or something.

I do not know if the product I got to see is a final version or not. It's possible that it is some kind of W.I.P. piece. My review and opinion (gasp) is based on what I was exposed to. If you can't handle that, move on and don't waste my time with more comment vitriol.

I LOVE the movies and I'm more than a little curious as to what the ""exclusive"" content is (did not have the option of playing the discs), but I never understood the need to package discs in goofy displays, like all of Planet of the Apes in Cornelius' head. ?!?! (Which I desperately wanted until I saw that in person too.)

I don't need a plastic briefcase, cardboard disc sleeves, or a glowing tesseract replica. Sure the cube would be nice to display with other items I've collected, but it not primary to my interest in getting an Avengers set.

I'm also not a fan of 3D; the fad that failed in both the 50s and 80s is not necessary now either. I also don't utilize the digital copies. So I can live without that too. That's not a crucifixion of the company for including or excluding them. I'm just saying they're not a factor in my decision to own or not.

Can we just have a set with the Blu-Ray discs and the extra content? Maybe complete soundtrack recordings too? Slide individual, real cases into a cardboard box I can discard and I'll jump all over it.

I'd like to have the option to remove the individual movies in hard cases of their own for my media storage instead of only having cardboard sleeves inside a bulkier plastic briefcase that I cannot fit with the other DVDs and Blu-Rays on my shelves. As it stands, that's what I'll likely have since I only need to get The Avengers upon its release to add to the other 5, single-cased movies in my library. However, if the full set was packaged as I'd like, I would happily get it to have a single set and donate my other copies to the Thrift Store down the street.

Sorry to be a curmudgeon, but the content is the primary reason to part with my money, not the packaging.

I rated it 2 stars, which means ""I don't like it."" And that's the truth, I don't like the complete package. That's what a review is - a statement of opinion to let others know. If you disagree, that's fine. My review does not say ""if you think you'll like it you're a bad person."" Nor does it say the company producing it supports killing puppies and banning Santa Claus. So relax people.

If you want discs kept in cardboard sleeves within a plastic briefcase facsimile with a glowing tesseract replica, great. Buy it. There's nothing wrong with that. You might like it.",1343347200,32,3061,4.298611111111111
5126673,3,B0083SBMGW,"Even though I am not a big fan of over-the-top packaging because it requires extra space and can't fit on a shelf, I have deliberately waited to buy these blu-rays separately because I knew a definitive set would come out.  Now that it will be, I must admit the collection looks very nice.

The movies themselves are nothing less than phenomenal.  Avengers... Nuff said, can't be beat!  The Captain America and Iron Man movies were outstanding (IM2 not as good as original though).  Thor was great, even the Incredible Hulk was 100 times better than original Hulk was.  Each of these movies alone are worthy of 5 stars.

That being said however, I am extremely disappointed about the lack of digital copies within the collection.  3D versions, but no digital?  Seriously?  I am sorry, but the average person doesn't have (or want) a 3DTV.  Personally, I dislike 3D-films and won't pay the additional prices to see them.  But regardless, I know some people do, so including them (without raising the price) is fine.

But include digital copies... by not including them all you are doing is promoting illegal piracy and downloads because people want them on their iPads, smartphones and laptops!  Don't give us Ultraviolet crap or DRM restricted-authorized-server versions.  Give us a version we can use on our devices to watch when we want to!

Don't charge us more for it, we already paid for it once, now let us have it for our own use and don't charge us again.  They wonder why piracy rates and illegal downloads have risen.  Your answer is right here, you're doing it to yourselves.

Should have expected this from Disney, but I had hoped for better from the people at Marvel.",1343174400,27,1680,4.750865051903114
5126674,3,B0083SBMGW,"Before placing your order, I think you should have a look first at the Youtube video showing the set at ComiCon last week. Just type ""Marvel Cinematic Universe Phase One Avengers Limited Edition Collectors Set Blu-ray"" in the search box. It ""looks"" not bad but of course everything is in plastic, and blu-ray boxes are in card board... I would say that the price is okay for the 10 Blu-Ray discs, but for the price the packaging as good as it looks may be disappointing. Just my feeling...",1342828800,14,489,4.568181818181818
5126675,5,B0083SBMGW,"Is the metal case included with all the products? Also is that Cosmic Cube also included, if so what is it made from & what size & weight is it? Sorry I didn't get to read all the info & comments, I have misplaced my reading glasses & my eyes are hurting very badly. Other than that, as long as there are also special features & that short story about the couple that found some alien weapons at the end of the avengers movie & become criminals, included w/Avengers movie that it was filed for & shown during SSCC I can't wait to get this new part of movie membl. to own for my personal pleasure.

5126676,4,B0083SBMGW,"I'll say this much.

Yes, It does kinda suck that it doesn't come with Digital copies. But so far having Thor being my favorite of all the individual Avengers films and already owning a digital copy of it I'm not necessarily hurting for digital copies. But in all honesty I'd rather have the that over Bluray 3D.

Surprisingly thats my only complaint on the matter.

For the pre-order price it's amazing. The package is unbelievably awesome. All the great extra features and goodies that come with it make it well worth the price.

And they did have the briefcase on display at the Iron Man 3 booth at San Diego Comic Con 2012 this past week. I took pictures of it. It's a well sized briefcase. About the size of an average sized laptop or an XBox 360. And the Tesseract is awesome. Glowing and memorizing.

All in all, if anyone is gonna grumble about the lack of digital copies then just but them through iTunes and not buy this keepsake. If you can honestly live without them then this is for you. I'm about to pre-order mine.",1342656000,79,1029,4.452127659574468

8524623,4,B0083SBMGW,"My wife preordered this awesome MCU Phase One movie collection set when it was announced. As a huge comics and movie fan, I absolutely loved this collectors item. I enjoyed the films that came in 3D on my 3D tv, but they also came in standard blu-ray which was convienient for my other tvs. The box is pretty sturdy, and the bonus content was pretty cool. The lighting effect inside the box looked great, and the art on the disc slips stood out to the nerd in me. My only gripe on this set is the tesseract itself lacked an imaginative design, as the light inside was a bit dull due to the fog exterior of the cube. Also, for the launch price, I was disappointed that no digital copies of the films came with it. Outside of that we love displaying this piece at home on our nerd bookcase. The films are all good and the Avergers movie is great!",1523664000,,844,4.248447204968944
