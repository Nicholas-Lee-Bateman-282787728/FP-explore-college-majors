8001632,5,B0000E1W2A,"Outrageous. Back in the day, this was the bees knees. Now, I think I'm a bit over stimulated to action scenes and the like, so the fights are a bit slow and less thrilling. I still love watching, however it's just plain outrageous.",1405900800,,231,4.395348837209302
8001633,5,B0000E1W2A,"It's an insane parody of the WWE and the Godzilla like films. If you like or dislike them, then you got to see this. Watch it with your kids they'll love it and it has about the same amount of profanity as Shrek, so if they do watch WWE then they'll hear less.",1325462400,,260,3.9245283018867925
8001634,1,B0000E1W2A,"I found the book ""Kaiju Big Battel"" to be modestly amusing with the bizarre cast of characters, strange rules, odd biographies, and unusual awards such as the coveted ""Golden Banana Award For Tag team Excellence."" With that in mind I paid $5.00 for a used copy of this DVD, and have rarely overpaid as badly in my life.

This is the least amusing, most amateurishly made, un-funny DVD in recent memory, which is a shame as the material from the book could have been funny. This is not even funny in an ""Ed Wood"" way; it is just plain bad. It does have extras, but you may find, as I did, they are up to the level of the remainder of the DVD.

On a positive note, some of the ""commercials"" are actually not painful to watch, although there is little they can do to save this film from festering in its own squalid wretchedness. Save your money and just read the book instead: it is much more entertaining, but then again so was ""The World of Dung.""",1103155200,,947,4.314606741573034
8001635,5,B0000E1W2A,"Think, power rangers meets pokemon meets WWF. Yes the in-fight commentary could be funnier but the ridiculously bad effects and crudely assembled costumes further reiterate how silly some of Kaiju's serious counterparts really are. The whole DVD is worth owning just for the Silver Potato montage at the end...",1101254400,3,310,5.346938775510204
8001636,5,B0000E1W2A,"I love this dvd,its freaken awsome! I thought it could have had more extras. City crushing monsters an'it no joke,this proves they can wrestle too!....I gotta say the best match is the golden banana awar ceramony for the greatest inter-galactic tag team in the universe. U gotta watch the spanish plantians beat the heck out of giant spacebugs! Whats not to love!?....",1076284800,,368,4.951612903225806
8001637,5,B0000E1W2A,"This DVD does it all.  If you haven't heard of a Kaiju Big Battel, you owe it to yourself to get this DVD and check these guys out.  Very witty, very funny.
Lots of action.  Imagine if Godzilla met Hulk Hogan met the 3 stooges...
See this DVD!  Even better, catch a live show when they come to your town!",1072483200,4,304,4.016666666666667
8001638,5,B0000E1W2A,"Sure it looks majorly cheesy but it is the funniest DVD I have bought all year. If you enjoy wrestling and all the fakeness that entails, then you will love Kaiju Big Battel. Just watch out for Doctor Cube",1068249600,,205,4.282051282051282
8001639,5,B0000E1W2A,"When I first saw the cover of this DVD, I thought it was a cheesy Ultraman-type action show, but it's actually a satire of sports shows (I think).  Structured like a sports highlights show, three commentators (including a dorky-looking dinosaur named Dino Kang Jr., who looks like Barney's mentally-challenged brother and who makes screechy Godzilla noises) discuss wrestling matches and show highlights involving wrestlers in giant foam costumes.  Matches include a soup can vs. a sandwich and a dust bunny vs. a fly.  After Dino Kang gets his arm ripped off in a match, there's a commercial for dinosaur luncheon meat, in which a monster goes into a convenience store, buys an armload of this stuff, then headbutts the clerk.  Near the end, a singer who looks like a Princess Leia/Sailor Moon hybrid sings a love song to a giant silver potato who breakdances and moves furniture and gets beaten up by street punks.
Among the other highlights are a video by the band Piebald, wrestler bios, and AIRPLANE-like end credits.  Truly bizarre in a way that only Japanese humor can be.  A must for your next dorm party, as it's sure to become a cult favorite.",1067644800,3,1153,4.8274111675126905
