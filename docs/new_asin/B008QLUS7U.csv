8597520,1,B008QLUS7U,"This review is for the Desert Island Classics dvd release from 2012.
It has got to be the worst dvd-transfer since, well, the dawn of man.

Stay away! You're better off watching a 3rd or 4th generation VHS copy of a tv-recording from the eighties.
(The ""rolling"" noise to be heard throughout the move actually gives the source material away as a video recording with tracking problems.)

The movie itself is a true classic, a pity this extremely bad transfer makes it nearly unwatchable.",1486598400,2,487,4.785714285714286
8597521,5,B008QLUS7U,"One Star for the DVD By Desert Island Films, but for the film itself: I've seen and liked several Italian Crime films some I have liked others I haven't. The Violent Professionals came to my attention because an Beautiful car I Love is in,for an couple of minutes but it's thrashed around. The Chevy Powered(Corvette Engined)ISO GRIFO.It's the Silver Car,besides that which for me is the Highlight of the Movie,The Beautiful Italian-American Hybird(not the hybrids of today yuck.)The movie has plenty of car chases and action,There is two parts that made me want to give the movie one star:The Scene with the little girl and then later the scene with the Pregnant Woman. It's disgusting. The movie is slow-paced at times but it's an good movie with an interesting plot and twists. I saw this instantly online I believe on youtube the whole thing. I am going to buy it,cause' it's on dvd I've seen and it's not $40-$100 which is ridiculous. Movie is worth watching,one of the better of the genre.",1352592000,,995,4.790697674418604
