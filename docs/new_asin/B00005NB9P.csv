7946676,1,B00005NB9P,"I watched Anima because of the reviews, all of which were 5 stars and one 4. I remembered, after watching, how one shouldn't trust the reviews of others when all reviews are made according to each viewers taste. My taste in movies has me wondering why anyone rated this celluloid tripe better than 3 stars. For me it's clearly a ONE star film. The acting is poor, the plot starts interesting then slides into an inane attempt at creating excitement where there isn't any, All other categories for rating a movie, music score, costume, setting, etc are N/A. And in the end? It made no sense what-so-ever. Hell, ""in the end"" I'm not even sure of the what, who, why? or the what, who or why?. I didn't make a mistake writing that twice, no,.I did so because of all the myriad loose ends.
As I said, reviews are made according to each viewers taste so watch Anima. If you understand this film, write a review. Perhaps one according to my taste or the majorities. One never knows.???",1386720000,,978,4.5

The story builds slowly to a strange and enigmatic punch while delivering social commentary and philosophical introspection along the way. Low budget, yet brave and carefully crafted, this gem tells the tale of a German puppeteer forced to serve the Third Reich by carving replacement wooden limbs during the latter days of the war. Our puppeteer is brought to freedom by a young boy (for whom he has carved a wooden leg) and his cello-playing, concentration camp escapee girlfriend who successfully orchestrates their escape to America. Once in America, they confront the same social sickness that infected their homeland.  By the time we meet them, they are near retirement and far from society.  Our puppeteer has swapped carving dead wood into animated puppets for a career in taxidermy; turning previously living things into something wooden and lifeless.  He and his wife spend their days in solitude and seclusion; he transforms his lifeless taxidermy into clockwork instruments of catharsis while she plays the cello and paints.  A TV producer, working on a(bad)documentary about mummification and preservation of the dead, tracks down our hero and bullys him into an interview in a failed attempt to escape banal, never-ending footage of grieving pet owners picking-up their freeze dried pets.  It's just at this moment when the all-pervasive weirdness, hidden and simmering under the film's surface during the first reel of celluloid, finally boils over, consuming the story, the characters, and eventually the audience.  Devoid of a happy ending, there is a strange sense of justice pervading this film which will leave you bemused, creeped out, and .....satisfied.....in a strange way, of course.  One star off for continuity and ADR issues - still worth watching.",1374969600,3,1879,5.285234899328859
7946678,5,B00005NB9P,"This movie is very different and moves along at a slow rate, like reading a good book and drinking in every word.  A documentary maker searches for a legendary taxidermist who has not been heard from for years. When he does find him there is a whole lot more going on,the taxidermist and his wife are people tormented by the past, and there was lots to be tormented by. To me this was suspense movie, and with each scene you learned more about the characters and were both horrified and fascinated and felt for them. The acting was first class, and the picture crisp and clear. Watch it if you like your suspense a little twisted.",1347926400,12,630,4.431034482758621
7946679,5,B00005NB9P,"This movie is wonderful, an elderly couple live in the American woods. Years earlier they fled Nazi Germany he a puppet and artificial limb maker working with the Nazi state, she an inmate of a concentration camp. They fled with a young jewish boy for whom he had made an artificial leg, the boy was killed by two young American boys, this is actually shown at the end of the movie.  In order to cope with their horrible experiences the couple devise a play, where he makes puppets and they act out scenes. In this story an American documentary maker comes into their lives because of the elderly man's legendary status in the taxidermy world. The documentary maker is a bully trying to blackmail or subtly threaten the couple into an interview, as he says in the movie always looking for an edge. The elderly man preserves his wife after she dies and because of the curiosity of the documentary maker burns down his house and takes his preserved wife and the jewish boy preserved. You only get a glimpse of the boy in the back of the car as he leaves.  This is a love story that is slow and haunting you get a feel for the characters. The comparrison between the gentle couple and the brash, loud, rude film people really highlights all the differences of the characters. To me this is a tale about being a decent person, what is your moral compass? Will you tolerate other people and their differences, or will you hate or take advantage of others.",1345161600,2,1450,4.509505703422053
7946680,5,B00005NB9P,"I bought this disk to have as a record of my participation in this film's creation. It was filmed entirely in Rhode Island and was a product of the Producer/Writer/Director's love of film.  As with most small film productions, it did not achieve a wide release, but it has so many beautiful elements it deserves a wider audience.",1321142400,,329,4.672413793103448
7946681,5,B00005NB9P,"this was one of the most beautiful, touching, sad, and infuriating movies ive ever seen. it basically makes you hate the american media so much more for ruining something so beautiful. its a story about an elderly couple living in a little microcosm in the middle of nowhere, totally self sufficiant and cut off from the rest of the world, but struggling to cope with their horrific past. their lifestyle is threatened by a nosey reporter who is trying to create a segment for his television show. i really don't want to give anything away just in case you decide to watch this movie, because its is just so good. it was one of the only movies that ihave ever seen that actually brought a tear to the corner of my eye. this movie is something else. i highly recommend it to anybody with an open mind and some depth of feeling.",1214265600,4,826,4.440789473684211
