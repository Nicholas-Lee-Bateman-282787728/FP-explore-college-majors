4609528,5,B0058YPO9A,"All I can say is ""WOW""!  The Big C has me laughing, crying, and literally glued to the TV!!!  The acting is superb, the stories are so believable, and this is truly one of my favorite shows on TV (I actually subscribed to Showtime just to see it after watching a couple of episodes at a friend's house).  I've watched the entire first season, and about half of the second season, and I can't wait to purchase the DVD of the 2nd season (I already own Season 1).

Watch this show and you'll be hooked too!  Why can't they make shows like this for regular television?",1316822400,14,564,4.283018867924528
4609529,5,B0058YPO9A,"When I was a kid, anyone who got cancer was usually dead a few months later.  Flash forward to 2011 and I know many people in stage four cancers who are lasting year after year.  I am five years past colon cancer 2A so I am familiar with the whole current routine.

This show picks up where cancer is today.  It is a much longer event and one must live a life while also carrying around this disease for who knows how long.  Laura Linney as the cancer patient continues her excellent job from season one.

One distinct improvement this season is that her oncologist was replaced by an actor who is doing a more believable job.  This is Alan Alda. Alda always brings interesting juxtapositions to his roles.  He is able to play a competent professional doing his job yet also turn the role on its head by being a smarmy fool married to a much younger woman.

Likewise, Kathy has a friend now also in her clinical trial and he is a valuable addition to the show.  He has had cancer a lot longer that Kathy.  This is not his first clinical trial. He covers a gamut of emotions far more advanced than Kathy's.  While she is still in strong survival mode, focused solely on beating cancer, he is not so sure he wants to continue the battle.  The knowledge has set in that he cannot beat it; he can only forestall it.  Additionally, they are both stage fours so they face constant chemo (or similar) or they will die. This strong piece of acting is done by Brit actor Hugh Dancy who is totally believable as an American cancer patient.

I've noticed that more and more shows bill themselves as comedies.  This one also does so, with the tag line, ""A suburban mom, diagnosed with cancer, tries to find the humor in the disease.""  I do not find this an accurate depiction of this show. Although there are comedic moments, there are far many more dramatic moments.

I will take issue with only one thing that I think is wrong about this show in depicting cancer.  When Kathy is getting chemo, she looks far too healthy.  People who are getting chemo have a certain grayness to them, a sickly pallor.  This is because poison is being pumped into their veins.  Kathy looks radiant, by contrast. Hugh Dancy, playing her cancer buddy in the clinical trial, actually looks like someone going through chemo.  I don't know why this wasn't done to both actors.

If I were not a cancer patient, I might give this series four stars instead of five.  However, it is the most germane piece of tv work I've seen relative to my own illness so for me personally it is worth the five stars.

I like the vibe from this show, can't say I can compare it to another show, I find it refreshing and original. I like shows/movies that have ""green"" environmental people too, like her brother.",1395014400,,275,4.411764705882353
4609712,2,B0058YPO9A,"My husband and I loved the first season of this show. Laura Linney is quite simply, wonderful. Her touching relationships with her neighbor, her doctor, her student, her nutty brother were so well done. But as we began watching season 2 we became less and less enchanted until we finally decided to stop watching. What happened? Well there was a huge increase in vulgarity, and instead of clever writing and touching situations, we were treated to regular doses of the f word, which is the antithesis of clever writing. And really, watching Paul masturbate once was disturbing enough, but when he did it a second time, just ewwww. When he had his heart attack, we were glad. Even in the first season it didn't make sense that an intelligent strong woman like Kathy would be married to such an immature jerk. When we discovered he'd been resurrected for another season, we were disappointed. And did Adam have to go off the rails the way he did, first with a prostitute and then with the girl he's ""not having sex"" with from the church group. He's 15...after a while we were uncertain if we were watching drama or pornography. In the end, I would not be able to recommend this show.",1393286400,,1181,4.628571428571429
4609713,5,B0058YPO9A,It got more serious than season one but its overall quality was still great. The acting is worth the price of admission.,1391990400,,120,4.5

4609715,5,B0058YPO9A,"Just as good as the first scene. Linney knocks it out of the park, and the show really embraces the comedy. The third season lacks, but the fourth brings it home. The series as a whole is definitely worth a watch. Grab tissues.",1386201600,,227,4.3023255813953485
4609716,4,B0058YPO9A,"I wasn't sure if I really liked this when I viewed the first episode. The plot grows on you with each episode. Its interesting to watch as Cathy, the main character, changes as she proceedes through various stages and encounters obstacles trying to deal with the reality of her illness.

4609753,5,B0058YPO9A,We loved it!  My caution is it may stretch your sexual comfort level.  One of my favorite scenes is when she tells the class of upcoming oncologists what she believes is a good doctor.,1376006400,3,184,4.382352941176471
4609754,5,B0058YPO9A,"We are half way thru season 3. This is the best show ever on TV. Pathos, laughter, drama tragedy all done superlatively. Laura Linney is the best but her supporting cast is splendid. Didn't think cancer could be funny (and its not) but it is a slice of life.",1376006400,2,258,4.285714285714286
4609755,5,B0058YPO9A,"Wry humor, cathartic laughs, authentic characters. The. WRITING is so good you're not aware of it in the moment of play but only afterward savour the words, PLOTS, and the wonderful ACTING.",1375920000,,189,4.9375
4609756,5,B0058YPO9A,In this season Laura Linney continues to try and come to terms with her diagnosis of Stage 4 cancer. I would highly recommend this show to anyone who is looking for something great to watch.,1375056000,,190,4.457142857142857

4609758,3,B0058YPO9A,"Season Two seems to have focused a lot more on sex and raunchiness that substance.  There was some substance, and it definitely left me hanging at the end so I will go back for season 3, but more depth and time spent on developing the characters and their relationships would have been nice.",1371254400,,291,4.490566037735849
4609759,5,B0058YPO9A,"I usually never buy used DVDs, but I did this time and I was very satisfied. The disks looked new, no scratches at all! They played perfectly and I have no complaints! I would definitely recommend to friends and family.",1370822400,,219,4.5
4609820,5,B0058YPO9A,"I love this show.  It's a fabulous portrayal of the vast array of emotions a terminal cancer patient goes through on their way through what's left of their life - without being at all depressing.  There's a lot of 'comedy', if you will - and poignant moments that will leave you re-evaluating your own day-to-day living skills long after the episode has ended.  This is an excellent 'ice-breaker' for families and friends of cancer patients to watch together, to kind of open up dialogue on many difficult to broach subjects.  Some of the best acting on television, hands down.",1370044800,,577,4.797979797979798

4609822,4,B0058YPO9A,"I'm a big fan of Laura Linney and she is at her best in this unique comedy/dramatic series. Outstanding writing and stellar ensemble acting make this show just as entertaining as Season 1. Poignant situations posed by Cathy's health create comic opportunities as her husband (played by the amazing Oliver Platt) strives to meet the financial burden of her care in the impossibly expensive medical care system.

While this story line may sound like a downer, it is far from it. It's TV at its best. Don't miss it.",1369699200,2,512,4.752808988764045
4609823,4,B0058YPO9A,"After watching so many procedurals, where you have to pay such close attention to details of a case, and characters you have to remember for when they show up later and you want it to make sense, this is just relaxation and fun. I like to see the characters just let go and do things that I probably wouldn't do in the situation. Or would I? Who knows what I would do if I found out I have cancer. It makes you think.

I love Laura Linney in this. She makes the character believable even when she's a little over the top. And where do you find a brother like that? Oh, yeah, off the deep end.

I've enjoyed this trip and can't wait to see what comes up in the next season.

This show is for Mature Audiences. Don't forget it's Showtime.",1368316800,,736,4.1328671328671325

4609910,5,B0058YPO9A,"I discovered two lumps on my shoulder last April and consulted with a fellow actor on the Hong Kong English stage who's also a doctor (and Lady GaGa's Hong Kong physician). Yes, it's Stage 4 prostate cancer the only oddity being that the original tumor seems to have disappeared.

I find this series very enjoyable not least because I loved Laura Linney's work in Tales of the City.",1342483200,,382,4.617647058823529
4609911,3,B0058YPO9A,"I'm slightly older than the main character in this series, Cathy; I'm married with a teenage son and work in a school...oh and I also have stage iv cancer. So of course the series interests me.

I've never been a fan of Laura Linney.  Maybe if someone else were cast as Cathy I might like the series more.  She seems to have perfected exactly how much of a smile to put on her face to get the dimples on her cheeks to pop up, and the camera likes to zoom in on them.  Cathy does border on the eccentric, but I guess it runs in the family since her brother is 'out there' as well.

I won't spoil any story lines, but we start to see that characters come and go in Cathy's life. One that I hope doesn't return next season is the very odd Poppy, a weird woman in her 30s who befriends Cathy's teenage son.  Okay, he's supposed to be 15 or 16, and his parents accept this relationship like it's normal!  Very, very strange. I don't even understand the reason for her storyline. Then, in another episode, the parents are making sure their son doesn't take nary a sip of wine during a family dinner. Their parents skills are extremely skewed.

As in the last season, Cynthia Nixon lights up the screen every time.  Love love love her. She looks fabulous and what a great actress!  I'm sure Laura isn't too happy to share the limelight with her...too much competition!

The show offers entertainment but is far from any kind of realistic portrayal of dealing with the big c.  Some subtly humorous moments during the season, tho, like learning Alan Alda's wife isn't necessarily a trophy wife.",1342224000,,1585,4.40893470790378

4609913,3,B0058YPO9A,"Sadly, it's not as fresh or creatively written as the first season and some of the situations seem too forced or contrived. Still can't believe they paired her with such a schlub and he gets on my nerves even more in these episodes. Laura, however, is as wonderful as ever and carries the whole show.",1339113600,,300,4.472727272727273

4609917,4,B0058YPO9A,"The first season of this show was superb.  The writing, the acting, and the story lines were so funny and moving.  This season, the show started to lose some of its direction, but the acting from Laura Linney alone makes it worth watching.  The characters still affect you and you'll still be invested in them.  Definitely recommended!",1335571200,,335,4.824561403508772
4609918,5,B0058YPO9A,"I was left completely floored after Season 1 of ""the big C"" and wondered how they would be able to build on to such a great season, of a great show.  The show is less about a woman with cancer than it is about the ""cancers"" that affect each of us in our daily lives and how we choose to deal with the obstacles both literally and figuratively.

Season two of this great show brings in some new dynamics and characters that add more depth to the story lines.  With a all star cast we get introduced to Alan Alda and Cynthia Nixon as two great characters.  But one of my favorite characters in Season 2 is ""Lee"" played by Hugh Dancy (a British Actor).  He is a perfect complement to Cathy Jamison (Laura Linney).  This season, much like the last is captivating but I find has even a bit more depth to it.

This show is great and it is just on the road to getting better and better.  Cathartic and funny all at once.

Great job!  5 stars!",1320537600,5,935,4.144444444444445

last night i viewed the last chapter of the 2nd season; i won't give away anything, just to say that it was the most moving 3 minutes i've ever seen in any tv episode. this ending got to me; right up there with the conclusion of SIX FEET UNDER.

long may this dynamite show run, and long may laura linney continue to be the finest actress on the planet!",1317686400,18,615,4.491071428571429
