8495962,5,B006BADDHK,"Great technique! I was most impressed with his preparation, the tools he used from keeping the brushes clean, applying more than one color to a brush, improvising, etc.  I also like the mixed media chapter.",1440115200,,206,4.885714285714286
8495963,4,B006BADDHK,This method of painting is a philosophy and as would be expected the introduction to the materials and brushes is extensive. When the painting finally arrives the mind is relaxed and spontaneous mark making can occur. There are some interesting techniques which can be utilized in personal expression.,1426982400,,301,5.291666666666667
8495964,5,B006BADDHK,"Working Big, color filled and bold is what I love best. Bill Buchman's DVD's are filled with new ideas and new products for producing delicious abstract art. The large Sumi brushes and assorted Zen pens add volumes of colorful paint swashes and energy lines to my artwork. I've studied with Bill Buchman in 2 previous wkshps and now an ongoing class. The Zen breakthrough video is excellent to familiarize beginners through advanced artists in the proper way to care for and use his unique tools. My discipline is calligraphy. The package has excellent introduction and suggestions, including using the pens for calligraphy. I've cut many bamboo and Reed pens, so immediately honed the bamboo pen nibs to have a smooth and crisp nib end. I prefer them edged to make my marks of jazzed writing. Bill demos many marks with the different pens & brushes. I especially like the one to one feel of Bill's presentation and seeing him go through each step in brush and pen care, demoing the uses and variety of marks of each brush & pen and the thought process in choosing which tool, color or repeat that is happening in his spontaneous paintings. These products are excellent and easy to use.",1351382400,,1186,4.762135922330097
8495965,5,B006BADDHK,"What a great instructional video! I have been a student in Bill Buchman's figure drawing and abstract drawing classes several times because I enjoy his approachable teaching style as well as his expertise. When I turned on the video, I was in class, not sitting in front of a computer screen. I was especially interested in learning more about how to use the Sumi brushes and the bamboo pens. The producers of the video did a great job of letting Bill teach. I highly recommend this video.",1328572800,4,489,4.632183908045977
8495966,5,B006BADDHK,"I really enjoyed the Zen Breakthrough DVD. I felt like I was in a private class. Bill's manner is so relaxed as he is teaching us on the DVD, even though he goes over so many different brush & pen techniques plus abstract painting ideas. I found the DVD very informative and filled with lots of exercises to try. This DVD is over 2 hours long and packed full of creativity! I loved being able to listen to Bill's philosophy about painting, especially how abstract painting is similar to improvisation in music (or dance). You need to be prepared, practice your skills but also be able to think on your feet and flow with what happens as you are painting. I loved seeing him work with the sumi brush and I will go back, review and then try some of these exercises myself. Watching him do an abstract painting, seeing his process is so helpful to me. I look forward to watching this again, pausing the DVD and trying his suggestions. Very inspiring!!",1328227200,8,948,4.485549132947977
8495967,5,B006BADDHK,"In this new DVD Bill approached it as I did in my recent Ox-Herding painting with him(please search on Youtube if you want to watch that)...as a pure improvisation(around a general plan). Once I started watch this DVD and I could not help finishing watching the whole series in one single evening. Bill has done it as good as I could wish in this more than 2 hours DVD. I really enjoyed his spontaneous painting process while he was talking about what was in his mind responding to unexpected situations. Being a Jazz musician Bill's improvisational teaching style is very inspiring to me in my own Chinese brush painting class. I really enjoyed his great spirit of having fun, exploration and zen improvisation in this DVD and will recommend it to all my CBP students.",1323561600,5,769,4.703703703703703
