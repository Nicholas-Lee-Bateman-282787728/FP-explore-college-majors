8165856,4,B000M2DO54,"The directors and animators had a clear vision and followed it through with plenty of wit, charm, and above else, originality. The characters are solid and believable (as far as you can go with actual fruit) because they all seem fleshed out and are given distinctive roles. The plot, definitely on the whimsical side, allows you suspend your disbelief and chuckle your way through sci-fi tropes and occasional social commentary.  Not to be missed if you appreciate independent film, or are really craving an out-of-the-box animation with ZERO celebrity voicing. :) An absolute delight, though NOT recommended for young viewers as there are a couple of suggestive scenes.",1398038400,,671,5.212962962962963
8165857,5,B000M2DO54,"It was quirky as hell and quite entertaining.  Gives a whole new meaning to the phrase ""food fight.""  What's amazing is how graphic the violence is, especially in the first ""Bananastan"" episode.  As the 1 star reviewer noted, it's three episodes in one, very loosely connected by the quixotic and annoying personality of the ""hero,"" shriveled Dr. Sunkist. There isn't much of a plot, but the characters and effects are truly amusing.  As an example, the lettuce head university president is hilarious, especially with his mouth movements.  Very creative.  The bizarre, unrequited romance between Sunkist and his female student is also wryly funny, especially when the professor follows her to the strip joint where she works nights to earn her tuition money. Go for it Sunkist!

Definitely worth 77 minutes of your life and the modest cost of an Amazon rental.",1332201600,2,860,5.056737588652482
8165858,4,B000M2DO54,"The movie opens with Middle Eastern terrorist bananas murdering Jewish oranges, and some American oranges saving the hostages by using a wooden trojan horse and a brain-washing machine. The old Sunkist orange featured in the film is the scientist who helped the US military & now he wants to retire. It cuts away to an evil eggplant ecaping his execution during a prison riot, which included some graphic fruit on fruit violence.

Apparently, apples are African-American & speak in Ebonics. There was a priest pear but I'm not sure what ethnicity he was representing. What started as a slightly amusing story descended into boring dialogue and sad attempts at jokes, centering on the sunkist who accepts a job as a college professor.

I found myself wondering what the eggplant had to do with any of it...the college scenes went on forever. The storyline finally switched to a stripper fruit club, with perverted kiwis and a cucumber bouncer, and brought the eggplant back into the movie...eventually the plot made sense but itdidn't live up to its potential....just because it was low-budget doesn't mean the script couldn't have been more polished.

I watched the movie all the way through, but once was enough for me...although the last few chapters were awesome: zombies, killer plants, a robot & anthrax...so I recommend fast-forwarding to the science fair about 52 minutes into it & watching it from there -- you don't need any of the previous scenes to figure out what is going on...you're more likely to enjoy the movie that way.",1322611200,,1537,4.972762645914397
8165859,5,B000M2DO54,"Hilarious!!! How can I have missed that for so many years!!!
Certainly deserves a better distribution and publicity.
I will buy other productions from the authors.

I am French and saw the movie on TV in Pnom Penh, immediately bought it on the internet,totally unknown in Europe.",1309478400,2,279,4.9361702127659575
8165860,1,B000M2DO54,"Here's the thing...I like Mike...I like Jay...I like Red Letter Media...but this movie is unwatchable...I hosted a movie night and all six people voted to stop the movie after an hour and five minutes (about 15 minutes before the end)...which should tell you just what people thought.

It's almost a ""where do I start"" review problem.

First of all, it's three movies lumped together...it's Navy Seals (the crappy Charlie Sheen movie) plus every Zombie movie ever made plus every cheesy villain movie ever made...except that it does none of the genres well.

Second, every joke goes through a ""ha ha, chuckle, groan, double groan"" progression...after an hour, the entire group (who are exactly the target audience for this kind of movie) had outright laughed about three times.

Third, there isn't a single likable character...the main character is deeply annoying...the villain is mediocre..

Honestly...just skip it...I can't imagine how bored I'd have to be to ever stick this in the DVD player to see how it ends...It needed a complete script overhaul and to be about 30 minutes instead of 78...there just isn't nearly enough in here to warrant a short movie...",1301011200,,1165,5.0785340314136125
8165861,5,B000M2DO54,"I saw the movie trailer on the redlettermedia website and bought the DVD on Amazon.

It's a good movie. Very creative, dark, wierd, funny. It wasn't made by amateurs. These people must have had film-making experience, and spent a lot of time and energy making this. I doubt they profited, or expected to profit. They did it for the art. Well done!

The DVD also includes a commentary track, some deleted scenes, and a behind-the-scenes featurette.",1298937600,3,447,4.868421052631579
8165862,5,B000M2DO54,"Lately, I've grown bored of mainstream movies. Although i was skeptical at first, I gave Oranges a chance because it sounded interesting from its description.  I WAS FLOORED!!! I ended up watching Oranges five times the first week I owned it.  Now I pass it around to my coworkers and friends.  They all love this movie and they should.

Although this was an independently made movie, it looks like all of the miniatures and other props were painstakingly created by the moviemakers. Apparently, a lot of work went into making this movie, and it was also pretty darn well-written, too. I give extra marks for originality.  In fact, this movie reminds me a lot of South Park and team America world police created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone.

I demand a sequel.",1205625600,5,762,4.69172932330827
8165863,5,B000M2DO54,"Oranges: Revenge of the Eggplant is an innovative, hilarious, non-stop thrillride.  This film is unlike anything I've ever seen before.  We laughed until we cried!  Who knew a movie about fruits and vegetables--performed by real produce items--could be so captivating?  It is an absolute delight--truly too fabulous to be missed.  I anticipate that it will gain a large underground following because it is so unique.",1181865600,4,416,5.338461538461538
