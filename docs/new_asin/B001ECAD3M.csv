I found myself sympathizing with the husband, the would-be kidnapper.  She didn't want the boy's good father to see their son except for one weekend a month.  No matter what the husband tried was not acceptable.  She was nasty and you found yourself disliking her for being so rotten toward him.  He provided for the family and even sent her to law school but she decided afterward that they were too different and wanted a divorce.  She was a shrew.  Fast forward to faking their deaths, and the plot gets a little bizarre.

She flies to the Caribbean without a passport or even a certified copy of a birth certificate and she didn't even take the time to get an expedited passport.  That would never happen in real life.  Yet, she manages to get to the island on a temporary visa and is allowed to stay.  The scenery was stunning and that part was nice.  To see the son grown, well-adjusted and having a great life with his father made it seem all right.  It was legally wrong what the father did years prior, but it was easy to see even more of his side and, when the boy turned out so well, you hoped their life together could go on...but, with the addition of knowing his mother.  No way could that happen.

What was more than a little gross was the strange chemistry the mother and son had from the get go.  She didn't reveal who she was and they just spent some time together.  For one, they seemed to `want' one another.  The age difference was too close...in reality, she is only 15 years older and it looked like more of a `may/december' romance than a mother/son.  And then when she shows up on the beach in a string bikini lying on her side talking to her son, that was creepy and a bit perverted.  Would any mother ever show up, gawk and stare at her hunky hunk of a son stretched out in a string bikini?  I really felt, at times, he wanted her and was going to make a pass at her.  The chemistry was really bizarre.

I won't tell the ending.  It could have been a really good movie if it was more realistic (passport, age difference, creepy chemistry, etc.).  In the end, I still liked the father/husband more and sided with him even though what he did legally was wrong--but, early on, she wasn't fair in what she did to her husband or her son and she paid a huge price for that.  In the end, everybody paid for her inability to be reasonable and compromising.",1378339200,,2503,4.326881720430108
8297569,5,B001ECAD3M,"Long Lost Son w/Gabrielle Anwar is a phenomenal movie! It keeps you on the edge of your seat!  I keep waiting for it to come out in USA format, but no luck so far, so I have to settle for an occasional viewing on TV.  The emotional turmoil the mother goes through in the movie is well played by Gabrielle.  It has a satisfying ending.",1323561600,5,334,4.107692307692307
