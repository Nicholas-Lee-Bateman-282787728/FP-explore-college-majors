8179291,5,B000NNDHX6,"Amazing content.

Really easy to learn. Simple to use.

Yes it's pretty brutal, but I liked it because I'm not a trained martial artist nor do I have a lot of fighting skills.

This video package was worth every penny. I feel like I could handle myself if I had to. Gave me a ton of confidence.",1370822400,,294,4.12280701754386
8179292,5,B000NNDHX6,"I have been in the martial arts industry as a student and as a teacher since 1993.  I opened my first school in 1998 and have taught that style since then to my students.  My style of choice was Wing Chun Kung Fu and I have never seen anything like it until I had the opportunity to train under SGT Maj. Nir Maman.  In this past year he has begun to certify instructors in Special Forces Krav Maga and I can tell you his program is simple and effective.  This is No-Nonsense Krav Maga and I have just purchased these videos to refresh my memory from the 4 day training.

One thing that impresses me the most about Nir is his passion to prepare military & LE agencies as well as civilians to become better prepared to fight terrorism on every level.  I highly encourage you to buy these videos and attend any training that he offers.  If you're interested in more look him up on facebook.

8179293,2,B000NNDHX6,"My initial exposure to Nir Maman was through youtube. He appeared to be very talented and his video represented what I thought were excerpts from his DVD series. They were not. The DVD series is a very poor representation of Maman's abilities and I think his teaching skills. The information was sub standard at best. He is a very knowledgeable instructor and had the opportunity to truly represent these skills. In this DVD series he did neither. I am uncertain if this is the classic ""marketing scheme"" of showing ""sort of"" Krav Maga or IDF techniques, all the while knowingly giving very convoluted information and not staying true to really putting the information out there. ""Krav Maga"" is the new buzz word and it appears that this is a money maker and not a true representation of the system. Krav Maga is a very effective and well thought out program. These DVD's do not show how good the system or how effective the IDF and Israeli methods are. Very disappointed.",1266105600,3,972,4.723529411764706
8179294,5,B000NNDHX6,"I make a hobby of sampling Self Defense videos, and this is one of the best I've ever studied.  What Maman teaches isn't exhaustive; you'll already need to know basic combative techniques like punches, elbows, knees, and kicks (Try either Paul Vunak's Street Safe 1 or the second (combatives) volume of the five DVD Krav Maga set); but he has given thought to what works even if your attacker is bigger, stronger and even more skilled than you are.  The techniques are, as someone else has noted, easy to remember.  They are largely based on natural human reactions to attacks.  Easy to learn? Well, I wouldn't say that, but they're not at all difficult for someone with even a modicum of fighting technique.  They do, of course, require practice, but once mastered, they should be easy to maintain.
I find Maman's persona to be attractive.  He's not concerned (as too many Martial Arts instructors are) with establishing how tough and mean he is.  He let's his moves and techniques speak for him.  On the down side, at least on the several copies of this set that I've watched, the sound track is slightly too resonant and the video image seems occasionally shaky.  This is not typical of TRS productions, so I don't know why these problems exist here.  In any case, after a short time watching these videos, I forgot about these technical imperfections because the material is so good.",1253750400,5,1387,4.741666666666666
8179295,5,B000NNDHX6,"Simple to learn, easy to remember, effective in it's application. This is the real deal,but be careful. Some of this stuff can get YOU put in jail!",1232496000,5,147,4.481481481481482
8179296,5,B000NNDHX6,THIS IS REALLY MILITARY SELF DEFENSE THAT IT IS USED BY THE ISRAELI SOLDIERS. NIR MAMAN IS MAGNIFICENT IN TEACHING EVERYTHING TO DEFEND YOURSELF. HE IS SERVING IN ISRAEL AS A COUNTER TERRORIST INSTRUCTOR.,1226793600,5,204,5.029411764705882
