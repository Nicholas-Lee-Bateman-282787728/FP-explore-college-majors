1908618,5,B0000AQS18,"Lots of high points and low points in this season.  Probably where many people really think the show started to lose its touch.  While I thought Glory was a great departure for the traditional villain, I guess Buffy had just broken the mold too many times for even a character like Glory to really strike people.  Some solid episodes in it though.  The one about the Buffy Bot, and when Spike confronts Buffy about his past are in season five.  They are all must see episodes for any fan.
All and all, I give the season a B+.  I never thought Dawn found her way into the group, and I never felt any true emotion between Buffy and her.  But, who knows, this was also the season where Buffy seemed to lose her girly tendencies and become just a stone cold warrior like the rest of the slayers before her (its kinda sad, considering that she consciously tried to never become them).
A safe buy for any fan.  You'll enjoy.",1058832000,2,918,4.358823529411764

1908621,1,B0000AQS18,"This season is unwatchable. I loved the first four seasons. The first three seasons have the drama of the Angel/Buffy romance, and the fourth season takes a new turn that was interesting. For reasons that we can only guess at, Joss Whedon and his crew decided to introduce an incredibly boring character who happens to be a pubescent girl, supposedly 14 but looking more like 12. Did Whedon think Buffy was getting old?? The character makes no sense. The pace of the show slows to a crawl. It doesn't help that starting in Season 4 Spike became a character who kind of hangs around doing nothing. This is also incredibly boring and goes on forever. Do not pay money to watch this season.",1484870400,,687,4.59349593495935
1908622,3,B0000AQS18,"I watched Buffy the Vampire Slayer from the beginning, back in 1997. I knew Joss Whedon wasn't happy with what Hollywood did with his movie and that this was his shot at doing it the way he wanted. My favorite season is the first, simply because it's the funniest. The second absolutely has to be the best-fans know why. I have (and had) no problem with the show getting darker and darker each year. I DID have a problem with the whole Buffy-Spike romance. It seemed wrong back then, and, (now that I'm buying Seasons 5-7, to complete my collection), I'll see if I feel as strongly about it as I did back then. Also, hats off to Sarah Michelle Gellar for being so happily married; she seems grounded.
And yeah, Enya was a hoot.",1484352000,,727,4.392592592592592

I don't care what people say about SMG, Josh gets performances out of her that 14 years later are still amazing to behold.  The whole cast seemed to really step up their game as well, and I wonder if certain writers either came back or they manage to recruit some stellar storywriters.  There were times when I was in tears, and I already knew how the story went.  Just some really powerful and well done acting.  I had forgotten how the season ended (no spoiler here) but as soon as I watched, I still felt the dismay as intensely as the first time I saw it.

Season 5 is rough and momentous (sprinkled as all the seasons with its fun and offbeat stand-alone shows), leading to one of the great season closing episodes in television history. Buffy could have ended entirely after Season 5; that it didn't is a tribute to the storytelling skills of its creators.",1442361600,2,616,4.9326923076923075

Just going to show that you should always check before dismissing.  My one advantage in coming to the party a bit late is that since this series went off the air, TONS has been written about it, and I've happily engrossed myself in several books, websites, blogs, etc which are perhaps why my second viewing is so rich.  This ia a wonderfully presented storytelling moment in tv history, and if you've missed it (especially due to pre-conceived notions like mine), don't delay any longer.  This series is the real deal.

I am a young baby boomer and while special effects have matured, as well as story lines, I still love the innocence of this show. I am still trying to get my husband to start watching Angel concurrently for another fun marathon, but that may have to wait until the holiday season. Oh yeah, let's not forget how adorable Enya is, the development of Spike as a vampire with ""humanity"" and Willow as she continues to grow as a powerful witch.

1908728,3,B0000AQS18,"Well it's not bad but it's not really that good either. The Riley/ Buffy relationship was SO very over, and it was getting almost painful to watch their interactions and I was so happy when they finally split.
Then the whole Dawn thing. I watched the special features and the impression I got was Joss Wheadon put her in there because she was a super fan. The whole thing was really weird and I found myself fast forwarding through most of the scenes that had mostly her in them. Sure she was a whiny little brat that happened to scream A LOT (I would have NEVER gotten away with that!) and she was a ""key"" but REALLY? I could have done without her.
The only few saving graces were Tara, Willow and Spike. Tara seemed more involved this season which i like and less of a doormat but still she is super shy. Willow seems to be using magic quite a lot (I thought she was Jewish! Am I correct?) She seems to be coming out of her shell and she is getting more and more confident.
Spike, wonderful Spike!!! I love him this season! He gets so out of sorts when he realizes that he loves Buffy. I love the dreams he has about half way through the season about him and Buffy and wakes up freaked out. When Drucilla comes back and that whole scene down in his crypt is great! He is a wonderful actor who totally pulls off the black trench coat, black nails and bleached hair.... :D",1431302400,,1372,4.240458015267175

1908742,4,B0000AQS18,"I loved this series no matter how ridiculous it got even with Dawn in the picture.

However I can even admit that this season was definitely not one of their best seasons.

Dawn was indeed annoying and irritating and didn't really add much to this season besides being a constant pain in the butt to Buffy and her friends.

She was constantly putting herself in mortal danger in this season as well which made her character that much more annoying and unlikeable.

However despite the flaw that is Dawn this season was also really well written with the character of Glory and that infamous ending with Buffy that took a lot of people by complete surprise.

Suffice it to say when I saw the season finale of this season I cried it was a very emotional end and like a lot of fans at that time I was angry that it had happened.

Thankfully the next season made up for it.

I recommend this to anyone who loves a smartly written clever funny and very interesting show.

Buffy is and always will be one of my favorites its just such a wonderful series that has not been able to be replicated since it went off the air.",1426550400,,1113,4.342995169082125

1908785,5,B0000AQS18,"I own the complete 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer' collection. Season five is my absolute FAVORITE. SPOILER ALERT!
This series remains untouched by its weaker wanna-bes: Vampire Diarys, Twilight series, True Blood and the like. Joss Whedon has set a precedence that Hollywood cannot touch nor comprehend.
 This season we see a sister, the completely annoying, Dawn, the key, is created by monks from Slayer blood.
The surprise in the series is the excellent performance of Clare Kramer, as Glorificus. This is why season five is my absolute favorite. Glorificus is so wonderfully un-balance that I wanted to see her stick Dawn into a universal lock, turn Dawn, and open up the portals to alternate dimensions.
Ben, portrayed by Charlie Weber, makes a wonderful counterpart to his imprisoning sister Glorificus.
Joss Whedon does not draw boring good human brother and bad god-demon Glorificus defining lines here. He leaves the judgment of the siblings to his very sophisticated audience.
Finally, the dedicated viewers get to see the true nature the Ripper, Rupert Giles, portrayed by heart-throb Anthony Stewart Head. The audience was only given hints concerning Giles in previous seasons. And yes, I still want coffee every time I see Anthony Stewart Head.
Finally, viewers are treated to more of the tantalizing Spike, the Sid Vicious/Billy Idol delicious morsel portrayed by the NOT British actor musician James Wesley Marsters. His body is SLAMMING!!",1408924800,,1450,5.2770562770562774

1908795,4,B0000AQS18,"First off I have to praise this season on having a TON more of Spike, that's the best part of this season, EVERYTHING about Spike has been more developed and made better than his character already was. Now, this season has it's ups and downs like season four, for sure, however, this season IS better than season four, I think at times this season got a little to real, like the episode The Body, I will not spoil anything but let's just say someone gets a real medical problem and someone dies. Not anyone we haven't spent a pretty substantial amount of time with either, no, this person has been with us since season one, and trust me when I say, we feel the pain, loss and sadness of these characters because it's not just them that lost someone, we did too. Also, the biggest star and overall life saver of this season, is the very last episode, which was very surprising and in all honesty would have been a perfect ending to the show all together. I loved that they brought back Spike's former girlfriend for one episode too, that sure was a treat! The main antagonist of this season is surely in my opinion one of the weakest, likewise, I feel that the character Dawn isn't much value, she was not NEEDED, honestly, she just isn't given much to do other than annoy us, cry, and scream and cause other various problems, and this just isn't fun or interesting. Despite many episodes that are forgettable, as well as various other problems and imperfections that are reasonable and some that are just nitpicking, it's a very good season with many good episodes and very strong ones too. I do recommend it for sure.

My favorite episodes of season 5 are:

The Gift
The Body
The Crush
Fool for Love
Into the Woods
Intervention

Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Season 5 ***1/2 out of *****

1908803,4,B0000AQS18,"To my mind, and I'm sure I'll have a lot of argument, this was the best season of Buffy.  What came before was largely 'Buffy gets out of high school, into college, and more-or-less over Angel'.  Now she's all grown up, with a 'normal' boyfriend, and her friends are getting lives and dimensions  of their own instead of being mere hangers-on.  This season also introduces by far the scariest and most powerful of her adversaries, plus a pesky little sister conjured literally out of thin air, and her greatest emotional challenge in the form of her mother's illness and sudden death.  It's really a pity that the series didn't end with its shattering seasonal finale, as it would have made an appropriate sign-off to the character, instead of dragging her into an execrable sixth season (made intolerable by a trio of villain wanna-be's, more than anyone needed to know about Buffy's increasing obsession with her libido and herself, and virtual shelving of my two favorite characters, Tara and Giles).  Oh, well, I don't suppose this is the first series that peaked well before it ended, and I daresay it won't be he last.",1403654400,,1124,4.7979274611398965

1908805,3,B0000AQS18,"This is the worst season of the show.

We're introduced to Dawn who might be the most annoying, whiny, survival-instinct deprived major character in the history of tv. (She got better in season 7.)  Even worse, pretty much the entire season's plot  requires nearly everyone's complete stupidity to keep moving.

Examples:
A hellgod broke into my house threatened to kill my family? I'll hide them for a day, then we'll move back home and send Dawn to school the next day. Glory won't remember. Which is apparently true, so there is that.

We found out where the big bad lives. No reason to actually use that information until the finale. Since the finale wouldn't have happened.

The knights who say chase scene apparently knew who the key was early on. Yet they did nothing with this information until launching a logistically ludicrous attack to pad out a late season episode.

It's sad that the season had such a badly handled main plot, because there were some great performances in this season.  The episode where Joyce dies might be the strongest dramatically in the series. The Spike/Buffy arc was well done for the most part, although I could have done with a little less of it.",1402876800,,1186,4.751219512195122

The way you can tell the difference is that the original release says on the box: Season 1 (etc) On DVD. The 2006 re-release only says: Season 1 (etc). The 2008 clear dvd case re-re-release says: The Complete First (etc) Season 6 - DISC SET. I found this out the hard way after many returns from ebay and Amazon who use stock photos. The only place I found selling the 2006 versions was Best Buy. They have both Angel and Buffy but they charge thirty bucks for Buffy 2006 slims. Hopes this helps some peeps.

The character development continues to be fantastic, which is a rare thing for a show set in high school that continues to follow the cast to college.

She has a vulnerable side that shows she is human and not a robot-like vampire slayer.

1908855,5,B0000AQS18,That is what is fun about Buffy.  I have watched the whole series several times now and love it more each time. Subtle things catch my eye that I had missed in previous viewings. This series is really worth watching.,1379548800,,216,4.4
1908856,5,B0000AQS18,"I watched Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Fifth Season (Slim Set) (DVD) in the course of a little less than a week. In my opinion, this is overall the strongest season and has marked a turning point in the series. No longer is this show about school students but young adults understanding the dark world around them. During this review, I will explain what made this the most entertaining and addicting season even taking place after other high quality seasons.

I have a strong belief that the second half of Season 2 is the most classic and memorable portion of the show despite the mostly weak first half. Season 3 was amazingly consistent but lacked passion and emotion. Into the transition to Season 5 we have Season 4, which had shining moments but was more inconsistent and had an embarrassing Big Bad, so what was to be expected for the next season? What we have here in this DVD set is a collection of all of Buffy's best elements. It is emotional, consistent, and contains an acceptable Big Bad. Throughout the episodes, the characters go through fascinating development and the theme of family is strong, both things I really enjoyed.

Season 5 begins with a huge, what could be called a jump the shark, moment. A new character is added to the show, Dawn. She is Buffy's younger sibling who happens to be the Key, something that is wanted by Glory, the Goddess and Big Bad, to travel back to Hell. Some other important plots of the season consist of Spike's lusting over Buffy, Joyce's brain tumor, and Anya & Xander falling deeper in love. I found all of the plots and the way it changed and moved the characters to be extremely compelling, especially Spike's growth and the Summer's family drama. My only complaint is that Glory was definitely not the most memorable Big Bad, she is rather weakly acted and only seems like a threat in the last few episodes - but what she did brought in a lot of memorable character and plot changes. As for plot consistency, you could not ask for more. Triangle is the weakest episode, and even that is enertaining and a rather sweet story about Tara, Willow's lesbian girlfriend, who gets more of a personality in this and the following season.

How are the characters in this season? Xander is sweet and awkward as always and Anya became one of my favorite characters, putting humor in an emotionally drenched season. Willow, at least from my perspective, was more put in the background. We do know she is becoming much stronger and powerful than ever before. Her girlfriend, Tara, develops more of a personality and background, even if it is a little weak. Giles begins the season considering to leave to London, feeling like he is keeping Buffy from becoming all that she can possibly be. He decides to stay for one more year after she tells him how needed he is at this time in her life. Their father-daughter relationship is absolutely beautiful. As for Buffy, with her new addition to the family, she learns to mature even more than before and continues to develop into a strong young women. Dawn tends to get much criticism from fans but I like her. She suffers from being the Key and attempting to understand her importance in this world, not originally supposed to be there. Talk about a lot to put on a young teenager's shoulders! Sure, she is not one of the show's classic characters, but she does not deserve all the hate she has drawn. The strongest character development and change is with Spike who falls in love with Buffy and has drastic changes as a character. He is no longer that pesky villan but a deep down sensitive and sweet vampire with a heart. Spike is easily the best character in the entire Buffy world.

With only one real complaint, Glory not being one of the greatest villains, Buffy the Vampire Slayer is the best overall season. It more than makes up for the lacking Season 4 and puts the audience in a heart wrenching and emotional ride! Highly recommend!",1379376000,,3947,4.626248216833096

1908862,5,B0000AQS18,"Before watching this season I was already rating this series with 5 stars, but now I wish I was able to give this season 6 stars. The reason is that we have been shown how much more could be delivered with these characters and environment. When the season starts we are thrown into a confusing reality, with Buffy's sister showing up. ""Her sister?"" you say; which is the exact same thought I had. Everyone is acting normally as if she has always been there, but little by little we get to understand what's going on. This will be a central element in this season's plot.

And what a season it is! Powerful enemies, emotional roller-coasters, love and infatuation galore. It is as if we get the quality episodes we have been used to getting but you add on top of that one of the most fascinating story arcs ever. Once I started watching this season it was hard to slow down. As if this was not enough, the end of the season is as big as this series deserves, and will leave you surprised and eager to jump to the next one.

I only hop that next season can measure up, since the bar is now placed at an all-time high.",1378080000,,1115,4.279620853080568

Buffy was the most successful show the network had, and still the dimwits with MBAs were unhappy (much as the idiots at the Sci Fi Channel were upset with the reboot of Battlestar Galactica). This is the season in which Dawn appears [sic] and in which Buffy's mom dies. The episode dealing with Joyce's death is widely viewed as one of the greatest episodes ever done for television.

This is a great show - all seasons through 5 are excellent. IMHO things get a bit too dark with season 6 and though my wife and I are only partway through season 7 at the moment (we missed it originally as we were ""distracted"" with having kids!) - but it seems that the quality of the writing drops off markedly in season 7.

I get that she's energy masquerading as a person, I get that because of that fact she needed to be the Slayer's little sis so Buffy could protect her, but what I never got is why Joss Wheadon (sp?) felt the need to include a sibling as part of the story line.  I mean, the energy could have been turned into anything, didn't have to be a person, could have been a dog ~ what a better way to hide a key than that.  Who knows, maybe his decision to add Dawn was political.  Maybe Mr. Wheadon owed someone a debt.  Whatever the reason, the series went downhill after that.

Best episodes: No Place Like Home; Fool for Love; Triangle; I Was Made to Love You; The Body (another all-time best episode); Intervention; and The Gift.",1331424000,,500,4.365591397849462

And it also has my favorite Buffy episode ""The Body"" which just breaks my heart and makes me cry everytime I watch it.
 This season is a lot personal than the previous ones. It deepens the subject to life, death, loss, love, missed chances and family. My favorite episodes are The Body, Fool for Love, The Gift and Intervention. My vote is 9.7/10.",1326585600,,648,4.734513274336283
1908905,4,B0000AQS18,"Different aspects of Buffy appeal to different people. Some like the fantasy/scifi aspect, while others are interested in the character development and interpersonal relationships. Personally, I enjoyed the ominous (pun intended) threat that was Glory. This villain wasn't just a big baddie, but a god. Whedon and the writers did a good job of keeping that fact in mind. Watch as Buffy encounters her, the way she never stops coming, never slowed or stopped until Buffy presents weapons that are meant to battle gods. Buffy attacks, and Glory shrugs it off. It's unnerving for the Scoobies to realize how unmatched they are.

That being said, this wasn't a perfect season. There were good episodes and bad ones. I've always been annoyed by the casting choices and the characters portrayed. Willow/Allison is a poor actress, though luckily for her, the character she plays is in her minature wheelhouse (still though, she's hard to watch). Xander/Nick is pointless. His acting is awkward, and his comedic timing is poor. He's not all that attractive...there just seemed to be no reason for his presence in this season or the series. Buffy is the saving grace here. In 'The Body' Sarah/Buffy displays some fantastic acting.

Spike is explored and expanded as a character in this season. This was a great move. The character and the acter are fantastic. Attractive and with a rich history, Spike steals a few episodes and puts his stank on the series as a whole. Personally, I loved Spike in the episode when he walks Buffy through his Slayer triumphs. (It all worked; the acting, the writing, the directing etc.)

My favorite season.

1908908,2,B0000AQS18,"Not sure what the critical reviewer was smoking calling this Buffy's best season and Glory her second best villain after Angel.  This was the second worst season ever (the raspberry going to season six) and Glory was the most ill-defined, poorly acted villain ever.  I think her super power was PMS.

Buffy was about the teens being a step ahead of the adults, but by adding Dawn who was nothing more than an annoying whiner with no purpose once this season ended, they simultaneously made teens look bad and turned our hip lead characters into the ""souless"" adults they once looked down one.  Bad move.

Buffy vs. Dracula the season opener is showed us what this season should have explored:  A vampire who wanted to turn Buffy and Buffy delving into slayer lore to find out her origins and gain new powers.  Aside from the ep where she asks Spike to tell her about the slayers he killed, we don't get to see Buffy really exploring her slayer half.  It's not until season 7 that they somewhat explain how slayers came to be and even that is sketchy.

I don't think Buffy treated Riley badly, her mom was sick what was she supposed to do, stop to boink him and stroke his ego every other day?  Cry on his shoulder like he could cure a brain tumor?  He was very needy and he WAS the rebound guy, the anti-Angel (the real Angle gave her what she needed w/o being asked at Joyce's funeral).  Riley was the wrong guy, he wasn't what she needed, she wasn't what he needed and I hated the guilt trip Xander put on her for letting Riley the dull walk.  Buh-bye Riley.  Don't come back.

Joyce's death was unnecessary and should at least have come at the hands of a baddy instead of dragging out her boring mundane medical condition for half the season.

Dawn should have died at the end of season 5, freeing us all from her.  In fact, instead of making her a fake sister, why not have her be a kid lonely Joyce fostered?  Why make 4 seasons a lie by adding Dawn?

At the end, we have Buffy essentially committing suicide to escape her craphole of a life.  Yeah, she did it to save the world, but she also did it to escape the pain of her mom's death, the tedium of raising Dawn, her friends' endless insistence that she constantly save them from danger but maintain a heart and the hopelessness of her own existence.  Where did the vivacious, strong young woman from high school go?

Man, I love Anya.

If one were to make a list of top ten - or even top five - episodes culled from BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, three extraordinary episodes would always surface: ""Hush,"" ""Once More, with Feeling,"" and ""The Body."" This last one, ""The Body,"" has been touted not only as one of this series' absolutely best episodes but one of the best episodes of any show ever broadcast on television, period. ""The Body"" starkly deals with the death of a loved one in a way that is heart-wrenching and pulls no punches. I'd be lying if I said that watching it didn't affect me. The cast's acting, especially Sarah Michelle Gellar's, is phenomenal.

BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, with its deep digging into themes of angst and alienation and dark impulses, just may have been the best teen drama of its era. In Season Five Joss Whedon continues the down spiraling to ever-darkening territory. But first, we're greeted with the sudden arrival of Dawn, the 14-year-old sister Buffy (and everyone else) never knew she had, and this W.T.F? moment won't be explained until several episodes into the thing. This season is when Spike officially became my favorite vampire, when his admittedly twisted but ultimately sincere pining for Buffy gave formal license for viewers to really pull for him. But, of course, that no-harm-to-human chip was still implanted in his brain. The featured Big Bad is inspired, I thought. Glorificus first comes in, and what we see is this pretty blonde girl who, physically, looks like someone Buffy would just roll over in a skirmish. Except that Glory proceeds to wipe the floor with the Slayer. At this stage of the series, Glory - who we eventually learn is a psychotic banished god - would be the most formidable Big Bad that Buffy had so far faced.

Off the top of my head, my favorite bits: Giles taking over the Magic Box store and hiring Anya, and how this brings out Anya's capitalistic side; Spike's obsession with the daytime soap Passions; April the girlfriendbot and, later, the Buffybot and how the Buffybot plays a crucial part in Buffy and Spike's relationship; Willow's leveling up in power, and this would set up her magic addiction arc in Season Six; Buffy's verbal smackdown of the Watchers Council; and my two favorite lines in the season: ""Did anybody order an Apocalypse?"" and ""We band of buggered...""

My least favorite bits: Buffy's vision quest, the Byzantium Knights, the mind-numbing Riley Finn. Joss Whedon, in one of the special features, stated that this season's central love story would be about Buffy and her sister. Looking back, the super-soldier and his feelings of inadequacy never really stood a chance.

Can I just interject here how awesome Emma Caulfield is? As Anya, she's right up there with Spike as my favorite character, with her candor and her pretty and her howlingly funny inappropriateness.

Layered storytelling, incredible cast chemistry, a mythology that only becomes richer. Each episode builds on the overarching storyline; and there isn't one dodgy episode. But three unmissable shows are ""Fool for Love"" (recounting Spike's origin), the remarkable ""The Body,"" and the season finale ""The Gift."" I also really like ""Triangle,"" the humorous troll episode.

BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER - THE COMPLETE FIFTH SEASON comes in six DVDs and with oodles of bonus material: Audio Commentary on ""Real Me,"" ""Fool for Love,"" ""I Was Made to Love You,"" and ""The Body"" (this last one by Joss Whedon); Original Scripts for ""The Replacement"", ""Fool for Love"", ""Into the Woods,"" and ""Checkpoint""; ""Buffy Abroad"" explores the popularity of the show internationally (00:04:14 minutes long); ""Casting BUFFY"" - casting the actors, including the tidbit that Sarah Michelle Gellar was originally brought in to play ""Cordelia"" (00:06:51); ""Demonology: A Slayer's Guide"" - Danny Strong talks us thru the many demons and other supernatural beasties inhabiting Buffy's world (00:11:26); ""Action Heroes: The Stunts of BUFFY"" (00:11:28); Outtakes (from previous seasons, 00:02:12); ""The Story of Season 5"" is an overview of this season (00:27:49); ""Natural Causes"" is an in-depth breakdown of the episode ""The Body"" (00:09:19); ""Spotlight on Dawn"" (00:07:25); the trailer for the BUFFY video game ""Chaos Bleeds""; a DVD-ROM Buffy demon guide; and a Photo stills gallery.",1283817600,,4538,5.057486631016043

1908915,4,B0000AQS18,"Okay I will be the first to say that Dawn was not my favorite character and continues this streak until the end. But i must admit this did provide the character of Buffy a challenge and away to grow into a more aware person. While she had always watched out for the world in general. when it came to home life. She had her mother and really Joyce was a grown woman so she could take care of herself. She really didn't have a reason to be super caring at home. She was free to be well in a ""college mode"" forever until the sudden presence of Dawn. This put her in a whole new flock of dangerous situations and in a way made her more relateable.

 I don't know about you but i find it a lot easier to relate to someone who has a nagging sibling than to an only child. We got to see Buffy take on not only the world but family life full on as well.  She really had to step up to the table when her mother died forcing her to have to now be the new head of the house, as well as still saving the world on the regular.  She can't go unscathed throughout this process. She breaks down a bit when she finds her mother has a tumor. She also has a situation arise where the golden boy, Riley leaves for good.( He didn't seem to fit in so this was kind of expected.)  She also has to drop out from school.

So between all of this. Life becomes more real and we see more of how life (not monsters)  can be a struggle in itself. Those,all in all, makes her more relatable. Before all of this she was just another cute blonde who battles monsters. So while i didn't initially like this change. I see how it actually helped to open up a whole new level to the story.

Xander finally starts to grow into his own after having such a hard time the season previous. Willow starts to dig deeper into her own magic abilities and sometimes with scary results.

I love the character of Glory. She is really the first villain to come along and not look like your typical Beast. She even has times where she seems like someone you would meet at random and start to like her. Then you quickly see how things that seem harmless can be quite the opposite in no time flat. (The first fight between her and Buffy is truly something worth watching. The last fight is also quite a spectacle to see as well.)

This season also starts the obsession of Spike with Buffy which was a twist upon all twists. I like Spike so anyway to keep him in the story line I am all for it!

So I must admit this wasn't a perfect season (there are times when  dawn becomes too  real and annoying),in my opinion, but it is one of the best ones. Especially with the finale which could have seriously been the end to the series. It was dramatic enough and seemed to taper off everyone's story just right.  This isn't to say the next two seasons didn't offer some good stories and direction. But i think I would have been happy with it all just ending here. She saves the world and gives the ultimate sacrifice... herself. This season really marks the first time where on all levels she has to give more of herself on every level.

If you enjoyed Buffy up to this point i would say get this season!!!! It is a must have.",1271116800,,3166,4.141924959216966
1908916,4,B0000AQS18,"Buffy starts the fifth season off with a decent series starter but not the best by far, as you go through the season you find out Buffy has a ""sister"" Dawn, and you meet Glory the Big Bad of season 5, my only real beef with this season is some of the stand alones weren't that great, and Spike got on my nerves at times.  Other than that good season, great story, and decent acting.",1264896000,,382,4.093333333333334
1908917,5,B0000AQS18,"This season could have easily gone south. Any time you introduce a new character like Dawn you must be very careful that the entire Buffy matrix doesn't end up on the wrong side of the universe. For Buffy fans we must accept what Buffy accepts because she thinks it has always been that way, she has a sister named Dawn. Suprisingly however, the season actually begins with all things, Buffy meeting Dracula! Overall this is a powerful season, and one that Joss Whedon has called probably close to his best. Why? How? easy. He was under the belief that Buffy would not be renewed for season 6, and he wanted to put it all out there and give Buffy a royal send off--and that he did. With the intro of a terrific baddy like Glory which mercifully makes us forget about a rather luke warm villain like Adam from season 4. This is also the season, which really started as far back as one, and picked up steam in season 4, of Willow becoming more powerful and dangerous, albiet more subtley before it explodes in season 6. It is also the season where Buffy is starting to creep closer to playing with forces that down the line will unleash the first. Study the episodes about the first slayer that she encounters very carefully for clues, also anything involving Willow playing with the mojo. Episodes you cannot and will not want to miss ""The Body"" I dare you to find a more chilling portrait on television of a daugther losing a parent. It will leave you breathless and make you think deeply about our mortality. And of course, the ""The Gift"" A perfect ending for a terrific season. A more beautiful way to end the possible end of a series, I think not. Other things to watch, Spike's growing obession with Buffy, and Tara. Her character development this season is crucial to the axis of season 6, the season that almost never was. It is, and was a special season. Thank you Joss.

1908918,2,B0000AQS18,"Season 5 of Buffy.  The first truly awful season.  And I mean awful.  After I watch season 4, I asked a friend of mine, who had already seen the whole series, if I should even bother watching the last three seasons.  She assured me that season 4 was just a small misstep, and that they pull it back together in this season.  So I rented season 5 and started watching it with a renewed sense of optimism.  When I finished the season, I had one thing to say. I'm surprised they were able to make two more seasons after this one.  The plot, the characters, the villians, Dawn, everything in this season was just awful.

 Okay, let me start at the beginning.  The first episode, ""Buffy vs Dracula, was not horrible.  Dracula seemed sort of stupid when I first saw the episode.  But once I realized who the main villian of this season was, I was begging for her to be removed, and for Dracula to come back.  Compared to the rest of the season, this episode was okay.  But at the end of this episode, we get introduced to Dawn.  Uuugggghhhhhh.  I could not stand her.  At first, I actually thought they were just going to pretend she had been there the whole time.  I'm serious.  I thought they were were overwriting the previous seasons and saying that Buffy had always had a younger sister.  But when they explained how Dawn had gotten there, I was overjoyed.  I thought she would be gone sometime soon, since her character was so annoying.  Instead, they decided to keep her on for the rest of the series.  Despite the fans abject hatred towards this character, the writers kept her on for the last three seasons of the show.  WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU GUYS??????  Dawn has got to be one of the most pointless, brattiest, annoying characters in fiction.  Now I know Dawn is sort of supposed to be annoying.  But they didn't do it right.  She should have been annoying to the rest of the characters, but not to the audience.  Look at Spike in season 4, when he first got the chip put in his head.  The rest of the cast couldn't stand him.  But we loved him.  We loved every moment of screen time he had.  Neither the audience, nor the rest of the characters could stand her.  She served no purpose other than to make our lives miserable.

 I didn't care for most of the other characters in this season.  Now I don't know about you guys but, as far as I'm concerned, the characters get less and less likeable after season 3.  I mean it.  Willow turning gay, Xander basically becoming a deadbeat, Buffy turning 20 and still acting like she's 16, they all went downhill.  The only exception was Giles.  I actually started to like him more in the later seasons.  It's too bad he stopped being a regular character after this season.  The rest of the characters are also pretty bad in this season.  Anya is annoying as always, Tara is as bland as always (although we do get a little background on what kind of family she came from), and Riley is even kind of whiney in this season.  He did a few things in this season that didn't really make sense.  I still don't hate him as much as most fans, though.  I was a little sad to see him go.  (They remove him when fans hated him, why didn't they do the same to Dawn?)

 The plot of this seas was terrible.  Basically, this Goddess named Glory, also called the Beast, wants to get out of our dimension and back into her heaven dimension.  She needs ""the key"" to open the doorway to her dimension.  But as she opens the door, more doors to other dimensions will be opened.  All kinds of creatures from all kinds of dimensions will be let into our dimension.  The world as we know it will be destroyed.  This is a decent conflict, but there's just one problem.  It's not enough to take up a whole season.  It would have been a good plot for an episode, or maybe even a two-part episode.  They milked a whole season out of this plot.  And they did the same with Glory.  She has got to be one of the worst villians ever.  She comes in on the season's fifth episode, ""No Place Like Home,"" and she's there for therest of the season.  Again, she is not an interesting enough villian to carry a season.  I mean, imagine if Drusilla had been the main villian of season 2, and the whole season had consisted of her trying to open Acathla.  That would have gotten real old real fast.  Which is exactly what happened here.  This is the first season of Buffy that didn't really have an episodic feel to it.  As we got further into the season, the episodes kept ending on cliffhangers.  It was like watching a season of ""24"".  Now don't get me wrong, 24 is a great show, in fact it's my favorite show.  But that kind of thing just didn't feel right for this series.  I can't really explain it.  In the earlier seasons of Buffy, they were able to, every once in a while, break off from the over-arching plot and put in an episode that dealt with something else.  And that was nice.  I really missed that about these later seasons of Buffy.  Especially when the plot was as lame as this.

 Now I loved the final episode.  It was amazing.  It was my second-favorite season finale in this series.  For a while, Joss Whedon was considering ending the series right here.  If he had, it would have been one of the best series finales of all time.  Because the actual series finale was a pile of crap.  Buffy and her friends prepare for the apocalypse which seems to come about every May.  I love how they joke about that.  Anyway, a huge battle ensues.  Buffy finally defeats Glory, and then runs off to save Dawn.  Giles then kills Glory by smothering Ben.  Oh yeah, Glory has a brothernamed Ben, who his sometimes him and sometimes her.  For some reason.  Despite this retarded plot device, it was cool to see another glimpse of Giles' dark side.  Unfortunately, this is the last time we ever see it.  Buffy realizes that ""death is her gift"", and she sacrifices herself to save Dawn and the rest of the world.  The season ends with a shot of a gravestone which reads: Buffy Summers.  Beloved Sister.  Devoted Friend.  She Saved the World.  A Lot.

 To recap, this was the worst episode of Buffy so far.  The plot, the characters, and just about everything else was terrible.  But this is actually not my least favorite season of Buffy.  The saving grace is the season finale, one of the best episodes of television, in my opinion.  Oh yeah, and Buffy's mom finally dies.

And that is what I think about that.",1256169600,6,6422,4.354237288135593

1908926,5,B0000AQS18,"Spoilers ahead.

Buffy maintains its brilliance in this fifth season.

The cast is as strong as ever, and Sarah Michelle Gellar in particular shows us just what a brilliant actress she is. The ingenious addition of Buffy's little sister, Dawn, would have to be the most creative way to introduce a family member in all of television. Only, by season's end Dawn's starting to get annoying. This is a pity really, as the wonderful Michelle Trachtenberg is a true talent - it's her character who's the problem.

But it is hard to find better television than this. Buffy retains it humour and its heart at the same time as delivering the big storylines. It can tackle over the top supernatural craziness as brilliantly as it does human tragedy - such as the tear jerking episode where Buffy comes home to find her mother lying dead on the couch, and then the later episode where the sisters discover the consequences of raising the dead - and letting them go.

This is television at its best.",1244073600,,988,4.660919540229885

Buffy vs. Dracula was one of the more stupid episodes of the series.  It was too contrived and Dracula wasn't convincing.  And yet, ""The Body"" is probably one of the very best episodes of the series and, perhaps one of the top 20 episodes on ANY television series.  However, with the loss of Joyce and Giles, the series lost it's appeal to me as an more mature viewer.

The series also lost a lot of its punch when Spike is utterly emasculated and becomes a quivering, lovelorn wimp.  Spike is at his very best when he's ""The Big Bad.""

1908939,5,B0000AQS18,"RELAX...the quote in my review title is straight from Season Five. No actual Bob Barker was harmed during the filming of this review.

As Season Five opens, this show had safely made the full transition from Sunnydale High to the college years, and instead of getting entrenched in ""Buffy Hills 90210"" petty collegiate fluff, it headed straight into death, loss, and gut-wrenching emotions.

As a season-long central villain, Glory mixes the every-hair-in-place diva obsession of Cordelia with the twisted and consistently disturbing psyche of Drusilla (who returns to find her ex-lover Spike ""tired of playing"" her kind of games). Glory's ""minions"" provide fawning comic relief in an otherwise heavy season (one of them is the source of the quote mentioned above). Think ""Smithers"" from ""The Simpsons"" in little ogre bodies.

The new ""central hub"" for meetings is Giles' new business venture, the magic shop. After witnessing the death of the store's umpteenth owner, he sees profit in his future, buys the store, and hires Anya as his cashier (more comic relief). Naturally, it also becomes a favorite visiting place of demons with heavy blunt objects, who inflict thousands of dollars worth of damage on the store and its merchandise as the season progresses.

There's some closure with the characters of Riley and Buffy's mom (hence much of the season's dire weight), as well as the show's writers filling in the blanks on the mystery / backstory of Buffy's little sister Dawn (and her link to Glory).

It would have been extremely easy for the show's creators to play it safe in Season Five by establishing a formula and cranking out tiresome episode after episode. They chose to do the opposite...to take some big risks, to pull out some major surprises, to defy expectations.

There's a significant emphasis on Spike in Season Five, culminating in a ""spoiler moment"" that comes at the end of Episode 18, ""Intervention."" As actor James Marsters has mentioned on a number of occasion, Whedon's original plan for the character was to kill him off after his initial appearance. Luckily for the series, they took a sharp left turn and decided to develop Spike into one of the show's most memorable characters.

In the Season Four box set, there's some discussion of the episode ""Hush."" Apparently someone told creator Joss Whedon that THE reason for the show's success...the SINGLE REASON...was the dialogue between Buffy and the other characters, the verbal interplay. It was shortly after receiving that feedback that Whedon decided to craft an episode that was completely silent after the first few minutes.

I've got to believe that a similar desire to defy expectations and ""think outside of the box"" went into the production of this season.",1217980800,2,2748,5.07760532150776

From series one to six, you get involved in the loves, hates, desires, infatuation and battles of a group of friends who battle evil to save the world.

This series is filled with adorable one line jokes, and violent battles against a constant evil. This is the perfect escape series. I adore the way the vampire turns into dust and you can see the skeleton prior to desolving.

What I thought would destory the show turned out to be my favourite of the show!  I'm not too fond on the charachter of ""Dawn"", The whole Key/Glory story is superb!  This is easily my favourite season of BtVS.

In almost every episode she comes crushing into Spike's crypt breaking the door down and punching him in the face, it got very old and annoying. She puts Spike down all the time but when she is in trouble he is the one she is running to for help. And after he helps her one would expect gratitude but she goes around looking down at him and insulting him along with everyone in her crew. What used to be a hero became an antihero. Buffy's character in this season is extremely unlikable, her voice, her clothes, her everything. Every time she goes on patrol to kill vampires or stop the end of the world she is dressed like she is going on a date. And why oh WHY in God's name did the producers/writers make Spike fall in love with her? Why does everyone on this show have to fall in love with her? She doesn't have the character and the personality of a hero, she is annoying as hell and expects everyone to run around and do what she wants.

I really enjoyed this season because they took it in a more serious direction. I also enjoy the longer story lines as well. I was so glad to see Riely go. I liked the character, but him and Buffy together was not good. I could have done without the intro of Dawn (even more so in the last two seasons). In the later seasons she becomes to whinny and too much of a distraction. The episode ""The Body"" is one of the most powerful episodes I've ever seen on tv. It truely captures the feeling of death when you first have to deal with it. I also liked the fact that they included a vampire in the end of the episode to show that life still continues even in the most horrible situations.

1908967,5,B0000AQS18,"Show: ""You think you know what's to come...you haven't even begun."" That line from the episode ""Restless"" sums up Season Five. Season Five is one of the darkest in the history of ""Buffy"" in terms of subject matter; it is also one of the most pivital. the season gets off to a rollicking start in ""Buffy vs. Dracula"" where Buffy meets, you guessed it, Dracula. It is also in this episode where we meet Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg) in a very Partick Ewing-in the shower way. Wait, Buffy's WHAT???!!! The next few episodes carry on as if Buffy always had a sister. It isn't until later that we learn Dawn is a mystical key that when activated will create hell on earth. The ""Big Bad"" of Season Five is Glory, a former god who has been banished to earth who is in a desperate search to find the key. This season also introduces Spike's infatuation with Buffy as well as the notorious ""Buffybot."" It all comes to a stunning climax in ""The Gift,"" one of the finest finales in the history of the show. You'll be permanentley glued to the edge of your seat during this episode. Every second is brilliant. However, the highlight of the season is definately ""The Body,"" which is the finest hour of television I have ever seen. Nothing can compare to the sheer power of this episode. The entire episode focuses on Joyce's, Buffy's mother's, death. Joyce was not killed by any supernatural entity, which makes it all the more real. It is sudden, and unexplainable. Sarah Michelle Gellar gives the perfomance of her career in this episode. From shock, to horror, to sadness, Gellar should have won an Emmy for this episode. Her performance is perfect. The other actors are fantastic in this episode as well. From Willow's (Alyson Hannigan's) fear of not looking appropriate, to Xander's (Nicholas Brendon's) quiet desperation, to Dawn's sadness, to Tara's (Amber Benson's) previous experience, everything is spot on perfect. Special mention must go to Emma Caulfield for her wonderful outburst about the fact that no one will explain to her what death is. This is the best ""Buffy"" episode in the history of the show.

Once Buffy realizes she has no real chance of beating Glory she accpets the fact that she must give her life in order to save her friends and the world ... again.  Sarah Michelle Gellar really shined in season five and showed some real acting chops.  It's a shame the Emmys never had the courage to honor that great work.

1908977,5,B0000AQS18,"I found this season perfect, from beginning to end, with a fine and subtle use of imagery, a fascinating and clever story arc, with even the so-called ""filler"" episodes being of outstanding quality. It was even on par with the excellent season two, which is quite an accomplishment.

The beginning of the season finds the cast in a good place emotionally- Xander & Anya are together, as are Tara & Willow. Also, it seems that Buffy has finally found a loving ""normal"" relationship with Riley. Thus the first three episodes are somewhat light-hearted romps reminiscent of the lighter side of season four, in spite of the fact that Buffy has a new little sister, and nobody but the audience seems to notice the fact that she did not exist until this season.

Episode four is where the season begins to make a turn- Riley risks death rather than revert to a man of normal strength, Buffy's mother turns mysteriously ill, and Spike has a revelation about his feelings for Buffy that horrify him during a dream sequence that is one of the highlights of the series. From this point on, life becomes darker for the slayer. She discovers the truth about her new sister and realizes that she must protect her from an unknown evil source that turns out to be a god from another dimension - the vain and evil Glory. Also, Buffy's mother is diagnosed with a brain tumor, and Riley leaves Buffy for a government assignment in Central America when he believes she no longer cares for him. In ""Into the Woods"", Xander makes Buffy realize what she is about to lose by letting Riley go, and she races to stop him from leaving, but is too late. In spite of the negative feelings many fans had for Riley's character, the last few scenes of this episode were particularly moving.

Buffy's mother, seemingly cured by surgery, dies suddenly in one of the series best episodes ""The Body"". In it, the scoobies first confront death that is caused by invisible disease, rather than some supernatural power that they have always been able to outsmart or overpower. This leaves Buffy the guardian of her little sister, whose emotional state has become complicated by the fact that she now knows she is not just an ordinary teenage girl, and that all memories of her, including her own, have been planted. Buffy's new duties as head of the house force her to drop out of college, ripping yet another earthly possession from Buffy. In the final episode, with Glory having ripped the fabric that holds alternate realities apart so she can return to her own, the slayer decides to take her sister's place and jump into the breach to stop the destruction of the world. At that moment, it is hard to believe that this is a difficult decision for Buffy considering all she has lost during the past year, and in particular given her last words to her sister -""The hardest thing to do in this world is to live in it.""",1147219200,5,2880,4.62109375

It doesn't really have the humor of the earlier seasons, and some people don't enjoy the character of Dawn as she seems to lack depth and texture, and is annoying and irritating. However, season 5 brings huge character developments, and it's just so epic in its heroicism. The Scoobys friendships gel back together after the fourth season, when they're free, and seem to go about on their own, and it's great to see their interaction. But, the powerful thing is what Buffy goes through, and how she matures. ""The Body"" is amazing, and it's gut-wrenching and powerful. My personal favorite episode of the series and season 5 is ""The Gift."" It's just an incredible tribute to Buffy and really all of the characters. Tremendous.",1146873600,,880,4.720779220779221
1908979,5,B0000AQS18,"Although spoiler warnings are not normally required by Internet etiquette for shows that ended several years ago, let me offer one anyway.  In other words, Spoilers ahoy!

Although Season Five of BUFFY isn't considered by most to be the shows best year (Season Two probably would get the nod by more), I personally consider it to be the most impressive of the seven seasons of the show.  This was a season with few or no weak episodes, the most unified central story line, a host of superb lesser plot lines, several brilliantly written episodes, and an absolutely stunning season finale.  When I saw Season Two I was convinced that it would long stand as the single finest season of any show I knew, but Season Five changed my mind.

By Season Five BUFFY was a mature show.  It never achieved a large audience, and much of the early hype had started to fade, though critics and fans continued to celebrate it as one of the most brilliantly written shows in the history of TV.  Had it ended at the end of its fourth season, its status as one of the most crucial shows in the history of the medium would have been assured.  But no one familiar with the show was surprised when they pulled out all the stops and somehow, improbably managed to top all that had gone before.

Season Five begins with a doubt planted in Buffy by none other than the most famous vampire of them all, Dracula, who had traveled to Sunnydale to meet the Slayer.  Although in many ways the weakest episode of the season, the Count's encounters with Buffy caused her to question who she was and what she was all about.  Season Four had ended with the great episode ""Restless,"" in which Buffy in a dream sequence had encountered the First Slayer, who told her that the kill was all, implying that her rich social circle and group of friends interfered with her being the Slayer.  Dracula tells her that she is a hunter and that she thrives on the thrill of the hunt.  In a way, the question raised in Buffy's mind is whether she is good, whether being the Slayer is compatible with being a decent human being.  For the whole season Buffy will ponder questions of friends, family, death, and love.  And for her everything will be clarified in a single moment of great self-sacrifice.

At the end of the first episode, after having dispensed with Dracula and asking Giles to once again be her watcher (she even agrees to read books in order to become more proficient, though she typically asks if any of them are on tape read by George Clooney), Buffy tells her mother that she is going to meet Riley.  Buffy walks into her bedroom, where a girl we have never seen before is standing.  Joyce then calls out to Buffy that if she was going to meet Riley, she should take her sister, to which both Buffy and this strange girl turn and irritatingly yell, ""Mom!""  It was an astonishing plot development, the literary equivalent of a skater announcing that they were about to perform a quadruple axle with back flip.  They created a plot twist that seemed almost impossible to resolve in any satisfying kind of way.  Any fan of BUFFY knows at least one thing:  Buffy is an only child.  She has no sister, no brother, no half-brother or half sister, no adopted sibling.  There is ONLY Buffy and her mother.  To make things even more bizarre, for the first four episodes of the season things proceed as if Dawn, her sister, had always been a part of the show.  She was known and loved by the other permanent characters of the show, shared their memories, and apparently had always been there.  Only gradually do we come to learn the truth.  Dawn is a newly created human being.  She is, in fact, a mystical key to a hell dimension who had been magically transformed into the sister of the Slayer by a group of monks in order to try and hide her from a hell god who was intent on using her to open the door between this world and hell.  The monks had created Dawn as the Slayer's sister because they believed that she could best help protect her.  They made her a real girl, unaware of her metaphysical reality, and had ""built"" the memories of all those connected with the Slayer in order to hide the Key as well as possible.  It was an outrageous thing to attempt.  The miracle is that they were amazingly successful.  Many don't care for Dawn because they see her as whiney, but few dislike her because they find her hard to accept as The Key.  Gradually, of course, first Buffy, then Giles, then Joyce, and finally the Scoobies and Dawn herself come to understand who she is.

Meanwhile, the hell god is searching for The Key.  Being a subversive show, BUFFY was always intent to take some new slant on the traditional villain, and so here.  Glory, or Glorificus to give her full name, may be a hell god, but visually she looks like a very beautiful, vain, pampered (you know she gets regular pedicures and waxings), somewhat ditzy fashion plate.  Physically Buffy is no match for her and is only saved in their first encounter when Glory causes a building to collapse on her when she has a temper tantrum after breaking a heel.  That sums up about all one needs to know about Glory.  From the 5th episode until the finale, the narrative for the season was structured around the attempt to protect Dawn/The Key from Glory.

The existence of Dawn raises a host of questions, none more important to Buffy that who Dawn really is.  She has memories of Dawn as her sister, remembers growing up with her, but she knows that Dawn isn't ""really"" her sister.  So who is she?  The first episode following Buffy's discovery of the truth about Dawn is ""Family,"" in which Tara's family comes to Sunnydale to take her home.  The Maclay family has come to get her because, they claim, the Maclay women assume their demon form when they turn a certain age.  When Tara shows some reluctance to go with them, her father declares that she should be with her family.  Although none of the Scoobies have ever been particularly close or even accepting of Tara, upon learning that Tara doesn't want to go with her father Buffy declares that they can take her, but that they have to go through her to do so.  Mr. Maclay then points out, ""We're her blood kin.  Who are you?""  To which Buffy responds, ""We're family.""  This is crucial for understanding not just Buffy's subsequent decision to accept Dawn fully as her sister, but for understanding the workings of the Scoobies as a whole.  Not just Buffy and Joyce, but Dawn, Willow, Tara, Xander, Giles, and Anya form a family.  Even Spike eventually assumes the position of the family's black sheep.  So gradually, in answer to the doubts raised by Dracula as to who Buffy truly is, she is first and foremost a part of a community.  And to the First Slayer, who insisted there was only the kill, Buffy could assert that there was the family.  And to the idea that a Slayer was essentially a killer, she eventually learns that above all else she is a lover.

The rest of the season more or less is a gloss on this idea of family and unity in the face of outside danger.  There are a host of subplots, including the building relationship between Xander and Anya, Anya's growth from former vengeance demon to avid capitalist, Giles purchase of the Magic Box, and Riley's departure from the show.  The most entertaining subplot was unquestionably Spike's horrified realization that he was in love with the Slayer, which resulted in a Slayer fixation.  Eventually, his desire to be respected by Buffy leads to something of a moral transformation, so that even before he acquired a soul at the end of Season Six he had more or less acquired one by his actions.

This season depended less on outstanding individual episodes than previous (or subsequent) ones, mainly because the season as a whole holds together so well.  But there were nonetheless some great individual ones.  I loved ""No Place Like Home"" in which we meet Glory for the first time, Anya becomes an avid money maker, and Buffy discovers the truth about Dawn.  ""Family"" I've mentioned.  ""Fool for Love"" is a Spike-centered episode in which he explains to Buffy not only how he killed two previous Slayers but what it was that made it possible.  ""Blood Ties"" is a very intense episode in which Dawn discovers who she is and has more than a little trouble coming to terms with it.  ""I Was Made to Love You"" is a wonderful episode about relationships and blaming oneself for the failures of another to be in a relationship, structured about a beautiful young woman who comes to Sunnydale looking for who she takes as her boyfriend, but who is in reality her maker.  She is a robot.  The builder, Warren, becomes an important character in Season Six.  The last several episodes are so good that it is difficult to consider them apart from one another, but I will merely say that the final episode, ""The Gift,"" rivals Season Two's ""Becoming"" and Season Seven's ""Chosen"" as the best BUFFY finale.

One episode, however, stands out even among these.  ""The Body"" is arguably the best episode in the history of the show and one of the most brilliant individual episodes in the history of television.  Buffy comes home to discover her mother Joyce dead on a couch.  What follows is the most realistic, palpable, and believable representation of what it feels to lose a loved one not merely in the history of TV, but in the history of visual media.  Certainly no movie feels as convincing as this episode.  That ""The Body"" did not win the Emmy for best writing that year is an indictment of the silliness of the Emmys.  It is an almost impossibly well done episode.

The season ends with Buffy with the help of her friends defeating Glory, but not before Dawn's blood has been used to open the door between dimensions.  The door can only be closed by the blood that runs through Dawn, but since she was created from Buffy's blood, to be the sister of the Slayer, Buffy realizes that her blood also can close the path through the two dimensions.  In a vision, the First Slayer has told Buffy that ""Death is your gift.""  In one of the great visual images in the run of the show, Buffy dashes down the platform on which they are standing and dives into the dimension gate.  The season ends with a shot of a gravestone engraved with the name ""Buffy Anne Summers"" and below that the words, ""She saved the world.  A lot.""

There are those who wish that the show had ended there.  BUFFY is widely regarded as one of the very best shows ever made (TV critics almost routinely in trying to gauge how good a current show is by comparing it to BUFFY-for instance, in the past month I have read a discussion of the best Season Two's in TV history, with BUFFY and THE SOPRANOS identified as perhaps the two best, while I read a review of the final episode of SIX FEET UNDER, with the reviewer comparing it to other great series finales but mentioning only BUFFY's by name), but, they argue, the final two seasons represented a decline in quality.  While I somewhat agree about the decline in quality, I think the decline can be exaggerated.  It also changes what became the final story.  In the series as we have it, Buffy was given her life back with the activation of all the Potentials.  While self-sacrifice is always great on a screen, ending the series with her death would have left it pure tragedy.  Also, there were a host of great seasons in the final two seasons.  Would any BUFFY fan really want to have missed ""Once More With Feeling"" or ""Tabula Rasa"" or ""Conversations with Dead People"" or ""Lies My Parents Told Me""?  Still, I will agree that BUFFY, though still good and frequently brilliant, would never be this perfect again.  Season Five of BUFFY truly is television has it can possible get.",1146441600,71,11734,4.543333333333333
1908980,5,B0000AQS18,This is a quality box set and pivitol to the overall story of the buffyverse. The package was delievered in excellent time and arrived in great condition.,1142467200,2,154,4.7407407407407405
1908981,5,B0000AQS18,"This season began as a roller coaster ride of shocking elements that came from nowhere.  Dawn, Buffy's sister, was hinted at early in a dream sequence.  Therefore, you weren't quite sure what to make of it.  Next hill is finding out who Dawn really is with a rapid descent into Buffy's confrontation of a Hell Goddess, Glorificus(Glory).

Then Joyce is in danger from a very real and horrifying threat, a brain tumor.  The thing that sets this season apart from the others is the confusion Buffy faces in confronting dangers that she is not equipped to deal with.  Finding out her life-long sister is a construct of some monks, the death of her mother, and another failed relationship are the true dangers to her because Buffy has faced opponents she couldn't defeat initially before.  The real life problems Buffy faces are keeping her off-balance.

The final thing about this season that makes it my favorite is the episode, The Body.  Every season has one episode that really stands out, but this is the one that stands out from the entire series.  The direction and performances in this one episode are among the most powerful of the series.  Emma Caulfield's performance was very powerful and moving, second only to Sarah's.  It also marked the end of one era and the beginning of another:  Buffy breaks down slowly, eventually becoming catatonic, but emerges as the Slayer capable of defeating Glory and the First.  In this season, all the characters find their niche in life outside of the ""Scooby Gang"".",1141948800,,1511,4.828793774319066
1908982,5,B0000AQS18,"I have to admit, when this season was taking place, I tuned it out fairly quickly.  I first saw that Buffy suddenly had a sister and then saw that Dracula was being introduced as an adversary and I went off the path to check out the Angel spinoff.

It was only after half the season was gone that I kept hearing from too many others how great this season was and ended up tuning in just as the season came to a close.

I may have beaten my head against a wall harder than usual (I can't remember) but when the reruns came about and finally the DVD set came out, I finally got to see what I missed and can honestly say that this was one of the best seasons Buffy ever had.

The rollercoaster of emotions and the newly created ""Dawn"" storyline was brilliant.  I have since heard a quote from Writer/Director Joss Whedon which sums up my opinion of this series and season.  ""I never create stories people will like, only those that they will love.""

I now have gotten the whole series and although it took some time, I recommend all those who like stories which surpass their genre to rent or buy this series.

It is definitely worth it.",1141257600,2,1134,4.266355140186916
1908983,5,B0000AQS18,"I am an accidental ""Buffy"" Fan.  For years, I rolled my eyes when someone told me that the show was wonderful.  I was sure that it was really just a campy, teen soap and I stayed away.

  Then, about 6 months ago, I inadvertantly saw an episode on the FX network.  It was ""Crush."" (episode 5.14)  I sat there in amazement as this show that I had once scoffed at drew me into its world.  It made me care about the characters right from the start.  By the time the end credits ran, I knew that I had been very, VERY wrong to dismiss ""Buffy"" as lightweight or silly.  The acting, the writing, the directing (especially in the scene where Spike and Dru slink into the Bronze looking so wonderfully, beautifully evil)... It was all just perfect.

  Now, having seen every ""Buffy"" episode, I am completely blown away by the depth and artistry of the entire show.  Every season has positive points, but season 5 is my personal favorite.  Everything seems to come together to create ""Buffy's"" most dramatic, beautiful, heartbreaking story.  Nothing and no one are what they seem.  Villians turn out to heros, and good people aren't always so good in the end.  The season all comes down to the ""The Gift"", which has got to be one of the best hours of television ever.  (On a small side note, ""The Gift"" was Buffy's 100th episode.  The montage of clips from the other 99 shows, which originally aired at the beginning of the episode, is not on the season 5 dvd set.  However, it is an easter egg on the season 7 dvds. If you buy season 7, it is worth watching the montage on the ""slow"" speed so you don't miss anything.)

One of my favorite episodes of season 5 is ""Intervention"" which combines humor, drama, character development, a Buffy-robot and some REALLY funny comments about poor Angel that always make me laugh.  ""Buffy"" can mix action, comedy and heartache together so skillfully that I can be smiling and blinking back tears at the same time.

  The true genius of ""Buffy"" is in it willingness to take chances and still stay true to the characters.  It's the most creative show I've ever seen.  What other show would take the cool, chain-smoking, leather clad, bad guy and give him a secret past as a nerdy, 19th-century poet?  What other show could have knights on horse-back chasing down an RV in the desert and make it all seem reasonable?  What other show would take Riley, a character who just wasn't clicking, and turn his feeling of alienation into a storyline?  Only ""Buffy"" and that's why I love it so much.

  The more episodes you see, the more you come to appriciate the whole Buffy-verse and I highly suggest you buy all 7 seasons (and the 5 seasons of Angel.)  I am an 26 year old grad student.  I NEVER thought I'd love any TV show this much, but ""Buffy"" is truly a work of art.  It speaks of love and redeption, good and evil.  It always suprises me, everytime I see it.  I just cannot say enough about the brillance of this show.  I wish I could give it more than 5 stars.",1140998400,4,2990,4.424632352941177

1908986,3,B0000AQS18,"On first glance Season 5 seems like an awesome season, and while it IS good, there are some problems.  Buffy The Vampire Slayer has always tried to maintain a good continuity but that falls apart here.

  In the season premiere we are introduced to Dawn Summers, the newly-arrived younger sister of Buffy, the show's heroine.  The fact is, however, that Dawn is not real.  Dawn, we learn, is actually ""The Key"".....a mystical ball of green glowing energy that will open the doorway between dimensions and ultimately bring Hell on Earth.  While that sounds like a great plotpoint that could make for an impressive story arc, it falls apart when we learn that this ""energy"" was made into human form from Buffy's blood so she will be given a viable reason to protect it from this season's ""big bad"" Glory (or Glorificus, as her minions refer to her).  The problem with that is, where did the monks who made Dawn acquire Buffy's blood?  This is not explained.

  Another problem with Season 5 is the amount of ""goofiness"".  The third episode ""The Replacement"" was just plain dumb.  It didn't leave me on the edge of my seat as previous episodes have.  What was with the episode where Willow and Anya accidentally create Olaf the Troll God and the film strip-like flashbacks?  Were they really running out of money and had to use that cheap film tactic to do a flashback scene?  While Sarah Michelle Gellar is a wonderful actress who can range from drama to comedy in the blink of an eye, I also didn't like her portrayal of the Buffybot.  While having Warren come in with his Aprilbot made for a good episode, and showed how a person can be hurt and their reaction when they realize that someone they love doesn't love them back, extending that storyline with Warren creating the Buffybot for Spike was pathetic.

  While not the worst season of Buffy, Season 5 was certainly not one of the best.  If I had to put the seasons into three categories (Great, Good, and Awful), this season would certainly be in the Good but not Great category.",1140134400,3,2036,4.628491620111732

I didn't see it mentioned, though, so I thought I would...

In The Body, there's no music. None. Only the opening and closing themes. If you notice, this episode deals with the stark reality of death, of going through the greiving process, how losing a parent reminds us all of the child within us, and how lost we are in those first few days of a beloved parent's death. The lack of background music is, I think, one of the most heartbreaking things I've ever seen in television... a reminder that sometimes life is real and ugly and painful, and there is no pretty music to carry us from one moment to the next.

The Gift, one of my all time favorite tear-jerkers, is another statement on familial love, and exactly how far one person will go, for love of their family. As someone else said, the final scene is heart-wrenching, especially if you love this series as much as I do!

1908993,5,B0000AQS18,"The brainchild of writer Joss Whedon, Buffy The Vampire Slayer originally entered American pop culture as a full-length feature film, starring Kristy Swanson, in 1992. But creator Whedon felt that the project never quite did justice to the full scope of his vision, so he managed turn the film into a television series in 1997. The result of Whedon's increased artistic freedom is a series that has enjoyed both critical acclaim and audience notoriety. Nominated for 14 Emmy's during its seven year run, the show managed to win only two (both in 1998 for Outstanding Makeup and Outstanding Music Composition in a television series). Yet, the true success for Buffy The Vampire Slayer is indicated by the massive success of the show's long run, strong DVD sales, and the overwhelming success of the series spin-off Angel...

Sarah Michelle Gellar plays the title role of Buffy Anne Summers, a teenage girl who stands alone among her generation as the ""chosen one"" able to ""stand against vampires, demons, and the forces of darkness. She is the Slayer..."" But Buffy is not alone in fulfilling her destiny as a slayer of vampires. She also receives help from the high school librarian, Rupert Giles (Anthony Stewart Head), who is a Watcher - the one chosen to train and guide slayers on their developmental path. In addition, new friends Willow Rosenberg (Alyson Hannigan - of American Pie fame) and Xander Harris (Nicholas Brendon) quickly uncover the truth of Buffy's destiny, and they often aid her in defending the world against evil forces...

The Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Season 5) DVD offers a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""Buffy vs. Dracula"" in which Giles decides to leave Sunnydale believing that Buffy no longer needs him. But when Buffy runs into a vampire who claims to be Dracula (and he exhibits powers far beyond the scope of most vampires), she and Xander are forced to work together to slay him. In so doing, Dracula reveals that Buffy's powers derive from a source of evil, thus stoking the curiosity of Buffy who enlists Giles' help in studying the nature of the Slayer (as a result, he stays in Sunnydale)... Other notable episodes from Season 5 include ""The Replacement"" in which a demon's spell splits Xander into two versions of himself (one with all his positive attributes, one with all of his negative), and ""Triangle"" in which Willow and Anya accidentally conjure a troll which runs around Sunnydale leaving a path of destruction in its wake...

As someone who never watched Buffy on T.V. but enjoyed watching the entire series on DVD i count season 5 as one of my favorites.

In Season 5 Buffy and the rest of the ""Scooby Gang"" face off against Glory, a banished Hell god from another dimension.

Glory is an excellent villain and unlike some of the other villians of the series is incorporated into nearly every episode of the fifth season, making this season alot more fast paced then seasons 4 and 6.

Many people hate the addition of Dawn but I love her in this season. Her addition was so creative and cool, it got me confused at first but when I found out how she had just popped there I got hooked!
This season is full of comic episodes and dramatic ones as well. My favorites are: Buffy vs Dracula, Family, Fool For Love, Blood Ties, Crush, The Body and The Gift.
I just thought Willow could have been more explored in this season. She could be like in the game ""Buffy Chaos Bleeds"", in which she is a vampire killer witch who throws fire balls.. so cool!!! By the way, the events of that game happen in the fifth season, so if you like this season and action games I recommend you buying both of them!",1111017600,,817,4.243589743589744
1908996,3,B0000AQS18,"Seasons 2, 3 and 4 were all nearly perfect, so the streak was bound to run out at some point.  Though this season is very uneven, there is still much enjoyment to be had.  Removing the college setting that was so prominent in Season 4 seems to have been a mistake.

With fewer external conflicts to explore, the plotlines focus on inner conflicts of the Scoobies, and we see the introduction of some standard soap opera devices: the long lost sister, the evil twin, and several episodes based around a character's illness.

The overall story arc also feels a bit drawn out, and doesn't feature as many twists and turns as previous seasons did.  But the second half does pick up, so it's worth hanging in there.

Best episodes:
* Fool for Love - The Origin of Spike.
* Spiral - Features the best action scene of the series so far.

1908997,4,B0000AQS18,"This episode is one of the best-written pieces of television ever created.

So often, the media shows a character death and the family grieves for a few minutes, has a funeral and life moves on. Not so with this one.

""The Body"" is hard to watch. You will probably have a lump in your throat, if not be in tears before it is over. Joss stripped this episode down to the barest elements - there is no music to distract you. It is harsh. It is disjointed. Even at moments, it is disorienting as you try to establish what is real and what is in the character's minds.

So it is when you experience death in real life. Death is not pretty or easy. It often comes at the most unwelcome and unexpected times. You say and do odd things. You act and feel disconnected. You make up ""what if"" scenarios. You try to escape. You resent the outside world for continuing on as if everything were normal.

""The Body"" stands out as ""The Episode"" of the season. This isn't to say that the rest of the season doesn't stand on its own merits, but when I think of this season, I think of this episode as the pivotal moment.",1108598400,2,1103,4.238095238095238
1908998,5,B0000AQS18,"Buffy's Fifth Season is narrowly clipped by the Second Season as the best of the series. But only narrowly.

The Fifth Season is tremendous. There is not one bad episode in it, and several stand-outs (Buffy vs. Dracula, Into the Woods, Fool For Love, The Gift) and one that deserves mention as being a work of art that television almost doesn't deserve, The Body.

I do not wish to give too much away, but allow me to say that The Body concerns a character's death. You would think, given that Buffy revolves around Vampires (and other undead/demon nasties), given that there are deaths in every episode, that it would be difficult to create an episode that, all of a sudden, treats death as a mature, deep and profound topic. You would think that it would be hard for the show to make a death compelling, even difficult to watch. You would think that right until you actually saw the episode in question, after which you would be writing a review next to mind to convince other people to take a chance on this series. I have heard people describe The Body as the most realistic portrayal of death they'd ever seen. I have heard people say it is the best episode of television, ever. I can only say that it is one of the pinnacles of a show that is, itself, a pinnacle of its chosen medium.

The fifth season also contains the best work from beloved regular Xander, a fun and daunting villainess and the wonderful addition of Michelle Trachtenberg. You will be tempted, when her character is introduced, to be angry at the show. Don't. Have some faith in the show (its earned it by now) and it will make itself good, I promise. The fifth season also has one of the greatest climaxes of all time (only upped by Becoming and possibly The Return of the King) in The Gift. The Gift, itself, is a rollercoaster ride of an episode which amazingly makes conscious use of something from almost every episode preceding it in the season. Buffy is a testament to consistency, continuity and fan-appreciation.

The Fifth Season is either the best or the second-best season in a show that does not have equal.",1106438400,7,2096,4.551724137931035
1908999,5,B0000AQS18,"Alot of people think season three is the better season,but I disagree. While all seven seasons of BTVS are electrifying (yeah,seven had it's moments) season five is utterly magnificent!
Family is the overall theme in season 5,with the addition of Dawn Summers (some BTVS fans see her as shark jumping but everyone's entitled to his or her opinion).This season Mr. Whedon and company wisely jettison Riley Finn's character (his season is season 4) and bring in Glory. To me ,Glory is hilarious. She's one of the more memorable villans on the BTVS series. If vain could have a picture in the dictionary,it would be a picture of Glory.

  Xander is split into two Xanders,Willow perfects her witchcraft and furthers her relationship with Tara,Buffy deals with her ""new"" 14 year old little sister Dawn,Joyce (Buffy's mom) deals with a brain tumor. Thanks to Glory,Tara is turned mental challenged and Spike realizes he's got Buffy on the brain resulting in him getting a ""Buffybot"" made. Giles spends the entire season deciding on whether his usefulness is over these days or not and Anya is 100% comic relief.
This is the way TV SHOULD be made!

If you get this set for one reason,let that reason be the last episode ""The Gift"".Words cannot explain the last 10 minutes.

1909000,2,B0000AQS18,"Worst season yet.

I don't mind dawn.  I'm not a Dawn hater.  I hated Glory.

A villian so card-boarded that Adam looked like a real winner.

1909001,5,B0000AQS18,"How can some people say that Buffy ""jumped the shark"" in season five, just because of the introduction of her sister Dawn? I just can't believe it.

Season Five is the best Buffy season. Ok, Season Three runs a close second, but it's in season five that things get extremely dangerous, extremely dangerous, extremelycreative. How many times have you seen a new character (Dawn) introduced this way, and to play such an important role?

Also, this is the most ""Sarah-oriented"" season of them all up till that point. She completely rules the screen time on almost every episode, with amazing and emotional peformances,leaving not too much room to Xander and Willow and the others, but this serves the history and every actor is in total top notch form here. James Marsters is supreme in the new twist of his character, who falls in love with Buffy.

The Season is a rollercoaster to a dramatic, breathtaking ending in ""The Gift"". The history arc was very well planned, and the first episodes barely mention the existence of Glory.

Also, there's one great improvement: stunt action. Whereas in the first seasons the producers did not care too much about ""hiding"" the face of the stunt people (mainly of the Buff's stunt woman), in Season five it's clear that someone at top level said: ""We must make it better."" Buffy's stunt is more similar with Sarah than the previous stunt, and there's pratically not a single shot where you can see the stunt's face turned towards the camera (in the previous seasons, this happened everytime, what was a little bit annoying).

Riley had nowhere to go, and the producers found a decent way to make him leave the show.",1102377600,9,1652,4.782456140350877

1909003,4,B0000AQS18,"After season 4 came out on DVD, I found myself still a devoted Buffy fan but unsure about the fifth season.  I wound up buying it on the advice of a friend I'd ensnared in the Buffyverse, and can't say it was too much of a letdown; I enjoyed it, but I felt something was ultimately lacking in the series.

Fans of Clare Kramer's Glory (or, as it were, Glorificus) tend to cast her as one of the best villains of the series.  I heartily disagree; she may be on a par with the Master, but she's not the Mayor and she is certainly no Angelus.  Season 5 was extremely heavy on the arc elements, and Glory was too powerful as an individual and lacked good henchmen to act as ""little bads"" to contrast with herself as the ""big bad.""  That meant that Glory's threat was overplayed and overdone by the culmination of the season; a mistake of involving her in the arc too, too early.  The arc was not aided by the involvement of the Knights of Byzantium, who were frankly like the Buffyverse's equivalent of ""they need something to fight - I know!  Ninjas!"".  But, season 4 had taught us that Buffy could persevere despite less than perfect villains, and honestly after the Initiative one could almost be forgiven for thinking Glory outranks Angelus.

The big controversy is over whether, at the end of the overrated ""Buffy vs. Dracula,"" the appearance of Dawn meant the sound of Buffy jumping the shark.  I found Michelle Trachtenberg to be a breath of fresh air on first view, and thought her performance was actually strong in season 5.  (Season 6 is a different question.)  It was a change that worked for the plot, letting the show do a ""damsel in distress"" routine to a certain extent.

The rest of the actors pretty much stayed the course.  Sarah Michelle Gellar worked except for the late-season catatonia that Buffy was thrust into; she was particularly wonderful in ""The Body"" and ""The Gift.""  The spotlight isn't really on Nicholas Brendon or Alyson Hannigan as Xander and Willow (respectively), but both troop through like old pros; so does Anthony Stewart Head as Giles.  Amber Benson stays sweet and wonderful as Tara, though the main Tara-centric episode, ""Family,"" is pretty rank on the whole.  Marc Blucas (Riley) still can't make it believeable with Sarah Michelle Gellar, and his departure from the series is a welcome event.  It's James Marsters as Spike who goes through some real growth here; he is wonderfully fleshed out, and we see some deep (and some dark, and some pretty disgusting) layers added to his already intriguing portrayal of a vampire.

As with most Buffy seasons after season 2, it's the standalone episodes of season 5 that have the most impact.  ""The Body"" is artistically brilliant, wonderfully filmed, and entirely emotionally devastating.  It is so brutally physical, so real, that it's hard to take.  Joss Whedon's directing has never been finer or tighter; he uses his camera to provoke realistic images that remind me of the brutal realism of Sven Nyqvist's camera work in Ingmar Bergman's film trilogy.  Yet my favorite episode (because ""The Body"" is something one admires, not likes) is unquestionably ""Fool for Love.""  Playing on the character arc of Buffy, it singly crafts much of the Spike / Buffy relationship, and at the same time masterfully reveals Buffy's fixation with death and darkness.  As a counterpart to Angel's wonderful ""Darla,"" ""Fool for Love"" is one of my personal favorite Buffy episodes.

But, as usual, not all the standalones are brilliant.  ""I Was Made to Love You"" is somewhat weak in introducing the season 6 villain Warren; and a lot of the episodes just don't work that well.  The best comedy of them is probably the offbeat ""The Replacement,"" bringing Xander into focus for what feels like it was really the last time in the show, if we don't count the execrable ""Hell's Bells"" in season 6.  But the real weak point in season 5 is ""Into the Woods,"" which ranks among the worst episodes in Buffy history.  It takes Riley out of the show, which is welcome in and of itself, but the speech that Marti Noxon has Xander deliver to Buffy about Riley's good qualities at the end is practically Noxon beating the fans up for not liking her cardboard creation.  Just as Riley had been taken to a dark and interesting place, Noxon tries to sanctify him when he goes; it is a cruel move, and the episode deserves the vilification it receives.

The up-and-down quality of the standalones is contrasted well with the main arc, which itself is a bumpy ride.  It ends fairly well, and there's some good drama and action, but the Knights of Byzantium really are just Random Ninjas thrown in to spice things up, and Glory really doesn't hold it together all that well.  It's still good television, and it's still worth watching, but it's almost unfair to compare this to the caliber of material we were used to with seasons 2 and 3.  It all finally works, and works well, in the cataclysmic and ultimately pyrrhic ""The Gift.""

Season 5 of Buffy still works for the Buffy fan, and should be seen if only for ""Fool for Love"" and ""The Body,"" both of which are truly great episodes.  And the Glory arc isn't bad, it just isn't the Mayor arc or the Angelus arc.  ""Into the Woods"" aside, even the low points of this season are at least somewhat enjoyable.  It deserves watching, but it's not really a priority for the viewer who wants just the essentials.",1101859200,9,5402,4.6701902748414374
1909004,4,B0000AQS18,"Definitely, Season Five is better than Season Four. This season has it all: action, comedy, human drama, plot twists. Some people complain about Dawn, but I think it's a godd character played with competence.",1101859200,,208,5.147058823529412
1909005,5,B0000AQS18,On this season Buffy finally comes up against something that cannot be defeated by force alone.

A glimpse of Willow's power and even Xander pushes the limits.  A death brings the group in close and a birth cements everyone.

 Well,everyone's entitled to their opinion. Mine is that this is a great season if not the peak of BTVS's run as far as overall consistency. I like Glory...take that back,I LOVE Clare Kramer's over the top ass GLORY.Along with Faith,she's easily amongst the most memorable charactes in the Buffyverse.

I was one of those people who said a show with a title like that has gotta be dumb...but wait , it's not just about slaying vampires ...it's about sacrifice, love, death, and trying to be sane in a world full of chaos. This show doesn't give you what you want. Instead it will give you what you need. Most shows always end with these happy endings that rarely happen in reality . No not this show...You will feel the pain and emotion of each character and feel as if you're going through the same situations. Basically this season was one of the best.

1909008,5,B0000AQS18,"If season 4 of Buffy seemed a little unfocused and meandering, season 5 flew like a well-aimed arrow.  Is it the greatest season?  Well, next to Seasons 4 and 6, this season blazes, but most fans will still cite Seasons 1-3 as the golden age.  Don't be so quick to toss this season aside, however, because there are some amazing stories that get told.  Granted the inclusion of Dawn into the character line-up wasn't exactly a quantum leap forward in terms of loveable characters, but she'll grow on you later in the season (although that can't be promised in seasons 6-7).  Tara's character is given a stronger voice throughout the season as well.  Spike's character, however, becomes a casualty-that is, he goes from Big Bad to wisecracking sidekick, a hat he wears decently only half of the time.  The Big Bad this season, was a woman named Glory.  I personally had no problem with her, although many fans really hated the character.  The struggle she has in the episode, ""The Gift"", with her human host for control of the body she inhabits is a true tour de force.  There are many standout episodes here, more consistent than season 4.  The opener, of course, ""Buffy Vs. Dracula"" is memorable, especially for Xander's turn as a minion.  ""No Place Like Home"" sees Buffy enter a trance-like state to try to discern the nature of her mother's illness.  The trance she enters is truly unnerving, especially as she wanders about the house watching two different realities phasing in and out.  ""Fool For Love"" has Spike stringing Buffy along for the whole episode with his tales of how he killed two slayers.  James Marsters rules here.  ""The Body"" is an important episode because it sets the tone for the next two seasons that followed.  It is not an easy episode to watch, and certainly not one of my favorites, but after this episode, the rest of the six episodes kick the season into high gear and take you to a truly breathless climax.  For many Buffy purists, this was the proper end of the series, as seasons 6 and 7 were found by many fans to have been lacking the storytelling quality of past seasons.  The jury will probably be out forever on the later seasons, but most fans will agree that Season 5 was one of the strongest.  DVD features get better and better as the seasons progress (although the navigation menu for season 2 is still the coolest).  I liked the featurette with Danny Strong and his demonologist bit.  The season overviews you of course probably shouldn't watch if you don't already know the story, because they contain spoiler after spoiler.",1101081600,,2570,4.67706013363029

1909011,5,B0000AQS18,"The season 5 DVD box needs another review like Giles needs another book, but there's no way I can resist putting a few thoughts down.

This season made me feel like I need to stand on the top of a tall building and yell to the world that every single person on this planet needs to see this show.

Seriously, has there ever been another hour-long drama that has maintained this sort of quality over five consecutive seasons? Yes, shows like ""NYPD Blue"" and ""ER"" have remained remarkably consistent, but they're pinnacles of a genre. They elevate a stereotype into art.

There has never been anything like ""Buffy"". Those who scoff have not seen ""Hush"", or ""Graduation Day"" or this year's ""The Body"".

Besides, what sort of TV show can be referenced, without sounding too-too fanboy-ish, by their episode titles?

When people refer to the show as dark, it meant (in previous years) usually in terms of cinematography, in tone, in it's ""supernatural"" emphasis...

...but this fifth year was dark. Dark as in death. Agony. Pain. Probably the least numbers of laughs per episode, but an excruciating amount of anguish. Real tears will be shed watching this season.

Oh sure, there were all sorts of little giggle-fests sprinkled throughout the 22 shows. Glory's infectious maniacal glee, the duplicate Xanders, the progressively-more-reliable Emma Caulfield as Anya, Spike's asides...

...but the list of unforgettable heart-wrenching moments is almost too painful to recount.

First and foremost is I believe the single most exquisitely painful depiction of a loved one's death I've ever seen on television. It is unflinching. Horrifying. Oh so real. What sort of genius can fill 90 episodes of death and destruction on an epic basis, yet make one single intimate death inflict such emotional damage? On the viewers, not just the characters, mind you.

Before I go any further, bravo Miss Gellar. Three words I'll never forget:

""Mom? Mom? Mommy?""

As a trauma surgeon, I'm prepared for pretty much anything that rolls through my doors.

I was not prepared for this. I was bewildered. I was shocked. I was involved in a TV show the way no grown, married man should...yet there I was, hand over mouth, mewing out the word ""No"" to my television set.

You know everytime you see somebody die on TV it's fake. I'll tell you this didn't feel ""fake"" at all.

Then there's the Buffy-Riley break-up. Yes, we all knew it was inevitable, but then why were we all yelling at our TV sets when the helicopter took off?

How about Tara's dementia? And how Willow cares for her? Or earlier in the season, when the Scoobies demonstrate the true meaning of family towards Tara? How can that possibly be effective, and not in the least bit hackneyed? Or Spike's unrequited yearning? The ending of the ""Buffy-bot"" episode was a master class of screenplay and acting.

I can and should but will not go on and on and on.

I simply felt the need to add my voice to the appreciation of this unexpectedly overwhelming show.",1100736000,13,2995,4.8277886497064575
1909012,5,B0000AQS18,"Buffy Season 5 took a little while to come together creatively, dragging a little to deal with the fall out of the Buffy - Riley romance from Season 4.  However, it became clear half-way through the season that there had been a lot of setup for the season's arc that was subtly woven in and then delivered an enormous payoff later.  Starting with the epsode the Body and moving through to the season finale the Gift, Buffy had what was probably its most consistently powerful run ever, framed by two of the 10 best Buffy episodes ever.  Week after week I remember being constantly impressed by the quality of the writing, acting and direction.  With the DVD I was sucked in all over again.

So in brief a very powerful season featuring an excellent (and completely deranged) new villain in Glory and tremendous performances from the whole ensemble.  Sara Michelle Gellar, in particular, stands out as Buffy is faced with both terrible personal adversity and an opponent so powerful that her own abilities are virtually irrelevant.  In the end it was Buffy's strength of character and sheer integrity that leads her to victory, not her super powers.",1099267200,2,1148,4.7969543147208125

Season 5 is by far the best I've seen thus far (I'm just starting on season 6).  Joss' masterful writing is in top form.  He delivers some of the best new characters and twists of the series.  The addition of Dawn was a bit surprising since you don't know where she came from until a few episodes into it.  Glory and the whole Key plotline was incredible.  That's probably the best villain on the entire show.  Then it gets even better when you learn the connection between Glory and Ben!  The thing about Joyce was definitely gripping, and elicited some of the best acting on the part of Sarah Michelle Gellar (see the episode called ""The Body"")!  And the ending was breathtaking.  I'm glad I had the DVD's because I couldn't have waited a whole hiatus to see how season 6 started.  If you're a Buffy fan, I'd say this is the season to own!",1098489600,4,940,4.406976744186046

Not Xander and Anya's love, not Giles' new found anger, not Willow's growing magical power, DAWN AND ALL DAWN! I think Spike was the best character besides Buffy in the whole season because you see him going through forbidden and very frowned upon love with Buffy. I also think that Grace was very good even though she was gone soon. I think back to the other seasons and just want it the way it was.

Like always Sarah Michelle Gellar holds the show together with her wonderful performance but she's never been better than in 'The Body'. It's one of the best episodes of the series, right up there with 'Becoming' and 'Once More with Feeling'. Spike's feelings toward Buffy change which will become quite destructive in the following season. This is television at its' best. Glory was a great villian.

1909017,5,B0000AQS18,"I had been told by so many people that this series goes downhill after Season 3, and I believe them somewhat after Season 4.  I thought the introduction of The Initiative was stretching it a little, and I wasn't a huge fan of its choppiness.  But it had to go through that phase to get to this incredible season, and by far the best of the show...

Let's start with the best episodes:

Buffs Vs. Dracula, The Replacement (super funny), No Place Like Home, Into the Woods (thank god), Checkpoint, Blood Ties, The Body, Forever, Tough Love, Spiral, Weight of the World, THE GIFT (the best Buffy episode ever).

Cast of Characters:

Buffy Summers:  Sarah Michelle Gellar
Xander Harris:  Nicholas Brendan
Willow Rosenberg:  Alyson Hannigan
Tara:  Amber Benson
Spike:  James Marsters
Riley:  Marc Blucas
Dawn Summers:  Michelle Trachtenberg
Anya:  Emma Caulfield
Glory:  Clare Kramer
Joyce:  Kristine Sutherland
Mr. Giles:  Anthony Stewart Head.

Here's the basics.  After a tiring battle with Adam, and weird dreams about the First Slayer, Buffy begins to truly understand her role, and asks Giles to be her watcher again.  No sooner does this happen that a new big bad is in town and she means business.  Her name is Glory, or Glorificus, depending on who's calling her.  She's is seemingly indestructable, and is looking for a key to open up her home hell dimension.  That key is new sister, Dawn, who for some reason everyone thinks has been around since the beginning.  With Joyce falling ill, and more pressure falling on Buffy, things get interesting with:  Tara's family, Spike's love, Riley's fix with vampires, Joyce's death, Drusilla's return, Buffybot, Tara's mindwarp, Dawn's kidnapping, and Buffy's catatonia.  And the end shows exactly what teamwork and sacrifice is all about, and how strong the scoobies are in friendship and strength when they are all together, all leading into the most impressive, exciting, and tear-jerking season finale yet.

Now why is this superior?  The scoobies are truly tested at an emotional level, and start to show some growth, and an increasing amount of loyalty to each other, even Spike.  Honestly, the episodes starting with Checkpoint til the end of the season are honestly the pinnacle of the series.  There are so many twists and turns, cruelty, love, redemption, sadness, and loss.  Buffy further learns the true meaning of her gift, and her heart, and the immense love she has for her friends and family.

This show isn't just about monsters and defeating the big bad.  It's about growing up, friendship, love, loyalty and change.  It's about strength in numbers, and strength of soul.  Everyone's desires to help out, and how now everybody has become an integral part of the team.  This season was truly and honor to watch, and worth every penny.  I wholeheartedly suggest that you ignore the critics who say that Buffy went downhill after season 3, because it most certainly did not.",1094601600,2,2937,4.969135802469136
1909018,5,B0000AQS18,"Great villians. Great character addition. Great stand alone eps. This season has it all. Spike's transformation from kooky villian into reluctant hero is the biggest highlight IMHO. But there is plenty for everyone to enjoy. Buffy's mom has an arc in this season that is at once poignant, heartbreaking, and beautiful all at once. Much like the season itself.

Glory is your villian for the season. She is a handful being a God and everything. Very well played by Clare Kramer she mixes manic tendancies with biting humor to keep the show light. Her miniature minions are always good for a laugh and never good for an original compliment for their dear leader.

Dawn is introduced here and instead of sinking the show with a useless character Dawn is used well and Michelle does a respectable job. She after all has the daunting task of joining a great cast on a one of the best shows ever.

I don't know if Season 5 is the best but it easily has the best ending of any Buffy season. The last 3 episodes are genius all well crafted and executed. I loved Season 6 but you could have easily ended the show here and not hurt the Buffy legacy.",1093651200,,1139,4.492753623188406
1909019,5,B0000AQS18,"Definately the best season of Buffy.  Season 3 is a close runner up, but Season 5 takes the gold.

Plot/Spoilers: The season starts out on the high note left over from Season 4.  The gang are all friends, Buffy has a wonderful mother and obscenely perfect boyfriend in Riley (Marc Blucas.)  The first episode is pure gold, where Buffy finally gets to battle Dracula himself.  Of course, hilarity ensues and she wins.  Enter the complication: Dracula seemed to know more about being a Slayer than she did.  At the end of the episode, two important things happen: Buffy makes a reprochement with Giles and asks him to once again be her Watcher.  Then...when she gets home...she has a sister!  The sister, Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg) is the first of many complications in the season.  As the season goes on, Buffy's life gets more and more complicated.  Turns out Dawn is actually mystical in origin, and this season's ""Big Bad,"" Glory is out for her blood--literally.  Buffy later loses Riley through her own pig-headedness and right when she's getting over that--her mother dies.  As Buffy's life crashes around her, Glory and her minions inch closer to taking Dawn away too.  Buffy has to face what she is--the Slayer--and make a decision that ultimately leads to her death.

Character development is the #1 reason I call this the best season of Buffy.  The non-Slayer part of Buffy essentially grows up way too fast in this season, going from care-free college student to a numb, depressed single guardian of her little sister.  Xander matures greatly, from bumbling side-kick and butt of jokes (""the funny syphillis"") into a respectable man with a good job and talent.  Willow goes from the meek and mousey girl we knew in seasons 1-4 to a confident, strong woman.  Riley went from all-American good boy to taking a walk on the wildside and then going away...Giles changes from blundering mid-life-crisis-man into a darker patriarchical figure, and Spike goes from the whacky neighbor to the most tragic character of the piece.  Not to mention that Dawn's character was very rapidly developed from whiney brat to extremely disturbed adolescent in just a few episodes.

It wasn't all darkness & responsiblity though.  Lots of comedy rounded out the near-perfection of season 5.  Particularly, the BuffyBot showcased both the humor of the writers and the talent of the actors.  Harmony also made some quite hilarious guest appearances and the Willow/Anya rivalry was portrayed in way that you could laugh at their immaturity.

I really loved watching all the episodes of this season over and over again, as a matter of fact, I believe I've watched all the episodes more than ten times now and I would still like to watch them some more.

First of all, I love the way the BtVS writers made the viewers remember the real concept of the whole series, which is actually vampire slaying, through starting the season with Buffy's encounter with the infamous Count Dracula. This idea of an episode is just great, thinking that the ""Dark Master"", as Xander mentioned, is in all actuality, the epitomy of all vampire stories and legends and even vampire slaying in itself. Not to mention that in this certain episode, Dawn was introduced, which was a completely 'alien' character to all of us BtVS watchers.

Now speaking of Dawn, I was exceptionally amused with the way her character was presented. She was introduced writing in her diary, like any normal teenage girl her age would. She also bared her emotions to the viewers and I found this fairly cute, but well-thought of.

One of my most favorite episodes in the whole series, I believe, would be ""Family"" which most people find as the Tara-centered episode. I loved how the viewers were given more access into the quiet life of Tara Maclay, and how we were able to witness first-hand the real 'thing' between her and Willow. But, it's just not all them... this episode serves to actually relay to the viewers the true meaning of family - that it's not just blood, but it's actually the love that people share for each other that makes them family. And for this, I salute the BtVS writers...

I was also amazed with the way Whedon portrayed the death of Joyce, very solemn and touching. I can say honestly that ""The Body"" is one of the most intricate and heartwarming episodes ever created in the whole series. This episode really made me shed my tears and I believe that most viewers were made to evaluate the way they spend time with their loved ones. Other than this main concept, I also liked the other happenings in the episode like the way Buffy finally knew that Joyce was dead, and also the reaction of Dawn when Buffy told her. I also loved the way Whedon finally made Willow and Tara's on-cam kiss not that very big deal, and yet such occurrence actually made a 'say' in the ep. But the best part in the whole episode, I believe, would be Anya's dramatic moment and this part really made my eyes swell...

The Big Bad in the season, Glory, was as a matter of fact very amusing, considering she had the tendency to be very humorous and yet intimidating at the same time. I like Clare Kramer's depiction of Glory...all her crazy (and I meant it literally) antics, her side-tracked seduction, and even her intimidation.

The slight introduction to future Buffy-Spike romance can also be rooted from this season, and although, I admit that this pairing didn't really start out so well, we can see the changes and the growth of their relationship from the fifth season too..

The viewers were particulalrly introduced to an even darker side of Willow and her grasp to magic, may it be light or dark. Also, we were given the information that because of her love for Tara, she had wanted to harm Glory for hurting her girlfriend and she used dark magic. Such happening became the big give-away on the future plans of the Buffyverse for the witch.

Lastly, I would like to give a big applause to the splendid season finale. I was touched with the peaceful death of the Slayer and the way we were all brought back to the value of family and loved ones... I give two thumbs up on the season!!",1091923200,4,3744,4.544510385756676
1909022,5,B0000AQS18,"Buffy S5 is just yet another excellent season of this great show, I'd rank this season my 4th fave behind 3, 2 & 4. This season is very consistent, there are only a couple of average episodes and the rest are either very good or excellent. This season's story arc about the latest big bad Glory plays a bigger part than season 4's did. Glory is a fantastic big bad, arguably the best big bad ever. There are also some brilliant comedy episodes here like Triangle & Intervention. All in all this season is very well balanced and that is why its so highly rated by Buffy fans. Although Buffy's sister Dawn can be irritating, her character does open up some interesting story lines. Spike has some amazing scenes in this season, and is now the definite comedy relief character taking over from Xander. If you haven't seen S5, buy it, its got everything.",1091577600,,850,4.525974025974026
1909023,5,B0000AQS18,"The fifth season of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER feels casual, exuding, particularly in its first few episodes, an almost thrown-together quality.  Coming off of season four, which contains some of the show's best episodes but probably has its weakest ""arc"" up to that point, Season Five seems to be following a similar line.  It is funny, well-staged, and full of fascinating new characters and developments, but it is difficult, at first, to get a bead on where the season is going.
  A friend of mine says most dramatic shows have five or six good years in them, before decline sets in or they are cancelled, and I think she's right. NYPD BLUE worked for six years before it collapsed under the weight of too many teen-idol replacements for Smits and Caruso; THE WEST WING's fifth season was a travesty without Aaron Sorkin and Thomas Schlamme around to guide things; and even a sitcom like FRIENDS, whose character arcs resemble those of dramatic programs, had a hard time keeping things interesting after year five. There's no set formula, of course, but it's fair to say that a program's cast and crew might get a little bored after awhile, might have trouble finding new shadings for their characters or new spins on their environments, and might begin to take it easy and coast.  Seen in this light, the initial slacker quality of BUFFY year five becomes both more comprehensible and also a little ominous-- when a program's first episode is given the distinctly Marvel Comics-esque title ""Buffy v. Dracula,"" its not hard to imagine the blood in the water and the sharks circling.
  Such fears were, for many fans, confirmed by the appearance of Dawn, Buffy's heretofore unseen, uncommented-upon little sister.  Some fans and critics immediately dubbed her ""Oliver,"" a reference to the mysterious ""cousin"" that appeared in later seasons of THE BRADY BUNCH, and whose name has become shorthand for a show's desperate attempts to add characters and keep things alive near the end.  Who was this strange, annoying little girl?  Why had we never seen her?  And why was every character on the show already acting as if we had?
  As if the ""new relative"" gambit wasn't enough, BUFFY' s writers also tossed in the Mysterious Illness ploy for Buffy's mom, and the Hot New Relationship plot for Buffy and Spike, in what initially seems like a wan attempt to recreate the old magic of Buffy and Angel.  By the time, in episode six, Tara's family arrives to inform the Scooby Gang (and viewers) that this quiet girl has a Dark Secret, fans can be forgiven for thinking that the WB had secretly switched our usual BUFFY blend with episodes of GUIDING LIGHT.
  Silly us-- with ep seven, ""Fool For Love,"" everything clicks into place, plot points are clarified, and suddenly it all begins to make sense, and to take on a tremendous emotional power.  The remaining fifteen episodes are some of the show's best, and looking at the season as a whole four years after its initial airing, it's remarkable how cohesive it really is.  One of the major themes of the year is deception, and by offering their audience a seemingly loose and occasionally incomprehensible start to the year, creator/auteur Joss Whedon and his staff were able to place viewers in roughly the same emotional position as their characters.
  By the time Season Five rolled around, Mutant Enemy knew it had a hit on its hands, and an intensely loyal fan base.  They could now take their show (and its viewers) to different places, and really get under the skins of their characters.  They had been doing this all along, of course, but Seasons Five and Six of BUFFY are full of a desire and yearning that is dark, fascinating, and sometimes unsettling.  Far from coasting to syndication, the show would take more chances than ever.
  It's notable that both Seasons Two and Five come, on DVD, in red/reddish boxes-- a color of passion, heartache, blood, and love.  Season Five finds the show's characters undergoing a level of trauma not seen since the second half of Season Two, and the final resolution of that trauma is, like the end of season two, both gut-wrenching and utterly logical.  I won't give more detail than that, except to note, again, how well-paced this year is, interspersing more dramatic eps with funny ones, allowing moments for the whole ensemble to shine, and keeping the flow so loose and unpredictable that, when twists and suprises come, they really are twists and surprises.
  This was also a year of behind-the-scenes goodbyes:  it was the last season shot by Buffy's great secret weapon, cinematographer Michael Gershman, whose beautiful balance of dark and light (in all senses) had held the show together since its first episode; it was the last year to prominently feature the lush scores of composer Christophe Beck, whose strings had always sonically captured the beautiful adolescent passions of the characters; it was the last full season for Anthony Stewart Head (Giles), whose character would continue to appear, but only in recurring ""guest star"" status; and it was the last year the show would appear on the WB, since contract negotiatons and public spatting led to the show's vamoosing to the UPN network the following year (this also meant it was the last time-- for awhile-- that there would be character crossovers between BUFFY and ANGEL, since the latter continued to air on the WB, which imposed a ""ban"" on such occurences after BUFFY left home).
  In so many ways, then, Season Five marks a turning point for BUFFY, a year in which, even for a show which had always taken chances, questions of change and growth seemed central, both within the narrative and on a stylistic level.  I wouldn't start watching BUFFY with Season Five, but it's a crucial year for a crucial show, and well worth one's time.",1089849600,7,5805,4.843117408906883
1909024,5,B0000AQS18,"Having seen every season of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" in its entirety, I can say without a doubt Season Five is my absolute favorite.  It doesn't have the series' best episode (Season Six's ""Once More, With Feeling"") or the show's best villain (the unholy Angelis/Spike/Drusilla alliance in Season Two), but as a whole nothing can top the plot and pathos of Season Five.
This is the season that introduced us to Buffy's younger sister Dawn, and while in later seasons she had a tendancy to come off as whiny, here she provides the basis for one of the most beautiful relationships ever portrayed on the show.  The dynamic between Buffy and Dawn runs the gamut from loathing to love and everything in between, but above all it is about the utter love and devotion these sisters have for one another.  In one of the special features, Joss Whedon is quoted as saying ""Buffy's love interest for Season Five is her sister,"" and this couldn't be more true.  Their sisterly bond is deeply touching and totally convincing.
But the Buffy-Dawn relationship is only the tip of the emotional iceberg in a tightly plotted season that also sees the death of a major figure in Buffy's life.  ""The Body"" is one of the series' strongest episodes, and its frank look at the consequences of a person's death will surely strike a chord with viewers.  Grounding this episode (and indeed, the entire series) is Sarah Michelle Gellar's consistantly strong performance as Buffy Summers.  She is at once empowered, humorous, charming, and yet still a vulnerable girl struggling with the relaties of life.
And of course, there's the season finale, the heart-breaking ""The Gift.""  One of the most emotionally powerful episodes of the series, it brings all the narrative threads of the season together in a way words can't begin to describe.  I won't spoil the ending, but anyone who saw the episode when it aired can tell you it's some powerful stuff.  If your prone to crying during movies, you better have a box of Kleenex handy.
Season Five of ""Buffy"" works so well as a whole it's hard to believe the writers hadn't carefully plotted every little twist before penning the first script.  The tight narrative consistantly builds on itself in ways that surprise and yet make perfect sense.  The emotional core of the show, always its strongest suit, is as powerful as ever, and nearly every major relationship on the show is taken to new levels during the course of the season.  So what are you waiting for?!?  Go out and buy this set now!",1089763200,10,2514,4.7626728110599075
1909025,5,B0000AQS18,"The fifth season of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" introduced the character of Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg).  Dawn is the sister of Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar).  Now, if you have been watching for the first four seasons, you know that Buffy doesn't have a sister.  She is an only child.  But, if you have been watching the show for several seasons now, you may also have noticed some odd things.  It began near the end of Season Three, where we see Buffy and Faith (Eliza Dushku) talking.  There is a flash of something on the bed, so quick that we can only get a hint that it is a person, but it is never explained.  In Season Four, there is more clues that something or someone is coming and Buffy has dreams of preparing a bed for someone and in that dream Tara (Amber Benson) mentions the word ""Dawn"", though we don't know at the time that what she is referring to is Buffy's sister.
Things are explained in due course, but the set up for this is that at the start of the season everyone is acting as if they have known Dawn for years and she has a family history.  There is a reason for this, of course, but telling what the reason is would be spoiling the fun of discovering this fresh.
Season Five brings the characters back home again after the fourth season focusing on college (and the first three working around high school).  There are several key elements introduced.  The first is obviously Dawn, and Buffy's relationship with her.  This also changes the family dynamic with Joyce (Kristine Sutherland), of course.  Another key element is the Big Bad for the Season, Glory (Clare Kramer).  Telling too much about Glory would ruin nearly all of the surprises for the season.  As in all of the seasons, ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" is ultimately rooted in the lives of the characters and while they are out killing vampires and fighting demons, the characters are also dealing the mundane details and facts of ordinary life, in all facets of life.  This has been one of the strengths of the show (and this season, in heartbreaking detail).
I hesitate to say that any one season is ""superior"" to another since this is my favorite program.  This season is slightly different than Season Four in that this time there is more of a direct storyline progression that Season Five is following.  The Fourth Season was more a collection of episodes that tracked the emotional growth of the characters, but not really against a Big Bad.  Season Five ended in such an incredible way that, some have suggested, it would have been the perfect place to have ended the series.  While I agree that it would be a perfect conclusion, I am glad that I have two more seasons to watch.  There are so many strong episodes in Season Five that it is tough to highlight just a couple, but some episodes of note are ""The Body"", ""The Gift"", and ""Family.""  Despite the fact that this is a show about a ""Vampire Slayer"", this show is about so much more and is much deeper (and better) than the title might suggest.

1909026,5,B0000AQS18,"Within every great television series, the characters have had to mature and deal with adult situations as they grew up. ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer- Season Five"" is a great example of how the ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" series started out as a show about a group of friends in High School and College, and by the end of the fifth season they were now grown into their own people. This is a great season in the show due to its great assembly of characters, real life problems, and awesome story. For sure, the fifth season of ""Buffy"" will be one you will love if you are a true Buffy fan.
To start, I have never really seen a show with a better assembled cast of characters. Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is still dealing with the problem of being a vampire slayer and also trying to fit into the world. Her friends are all finding places in their lives during this season, and for once growing up and supporting themselves. Xander (Nicholas Brendan) continues his construction job and even begins to get promoted and starts thinking about marriage to his ex-vengeance demon girlfriend Anya (Emma Caufield). Willow (Alyson Hannigan) is still in a growing relationship with Tara (Amber Benson), going to UC Sunnydale, and becoming a very gifted wicca. Giles (Anthony Stewart Head) has found a job as the owner of a store called 'The Majic Box' which Anya also works at. Riley (Mark Blucas) is still Buffy's boyfriend but their dieing relationship ends up causing more problems for both of them than expected. The only people not completely satisfied with life are Buffy and the vampire punk Spike (James Marsters) who is realizing that he has feelings for the slayer, his once great enemy. Besides Spike's obsession with her, Buffy must deal with two other problems- her mother's (Kristine Sutherland) growing illness and her sister Dawn (Michelle Tratchenberg), whom she soon discovers is not her real sister but a ball of energy called The Key sent to the slayer by Monks to protect it from a hell goddess known as Glory (Claire Kramer) who is not only evil but also hilarious and ditzy at the same time.
Next, although Buffy is a show that is not real, and really never could be, Joss Wheadon and his crew do a great job placing real life problems and situations into the story- such as Buffy's mom's tumor, an annoying little sister who is more than she appears, Willow and Tara's unusual relationship, Xander's debating about marriage, and even Buffy having to drop out of college to take care of her family. Yes, it is true that even though Buffy is make believe, you can still connect with it just as well as any other show.
Finally, the all out season was just great. Sarah Michelle Gellar, Alyson Hannigan, Nicholas Brendan, and Anthony Stewart Head do usual spectacualr jobs playing characters that go through all the normal emotions, such as loss, joy, confusion- and even the end of the world. Emma Caufield and Claire Kramer make their characters come to life with some funny moments and having their characters, who are from other dimensions, have to deal and adjust to the human world. Kristine Sutherland and Amber Benson are great for their overlooked roles, and Michelle Tratchenberg joins the cast with a bang as an annoying and mysterious teenage girl who we all know is more than she seems. James Marsters nearly steals many episodes again with his classic character Spike, who now becomes a great and exciting character in the show that you love and hate at the same time. The only character I have a problem with is Riley, played by Mark Blucas, who seems rather unfit to be in Buffy's world. His character is too 'nice' and just has no chemistry with Buffy. But that problem is not large at all considering the amount of greatness put into the show. Mercedes McNabb, Juliet Landau, Charlie Webber, and others guest star and are all just simply awesome.
To conclude, this is a great season to a great show. It's a step up from the somewhat dull fourth season, and can hold its own. It has several stand out episodes, and just has an amazing four part ending, and many other episodes in it that are all around good. The villain, Glory, is both threatening and has a connection to Buffy, not to mention her family, and a good villain creates a fun season. The relationships once again are all tested, and Joss Wheadon has proven that even after five years, he's not done with this classic show. For any Buffy fan.",1087084800,,4429,4.67948717948718
1909027,5,B0000AQS18,"The cast continues to grow in this season.  They introduced some interesting ideas as well as a strange new character Dawn.  Suddenly Buffy has a younger sister, but no one seems to know why.  Tragedy is also brought into the series with the illness of Buffy's mother, Joyce Summers. We also explore a lot of the characters more than in previous seasons.  We finally get to see reasons why Tara is so shy and introverted, we get more respect for xander, and we get to see Joyce turn into a more three dimensional character, rather than the slightly cliche caring mother of the past few seasons.  As well as staying with Buffy tradition of having an interesting villian, this time the vain and mysterious Glory.
The only problem with this season was the opener, Buffy vs Dracula.  Season openers were always a hit or miss, but this one is a bit corny and ends too quickly.  It would have been interesting to pursue the character dracula further, perhaps making him a a big bad.
I really liked this season.  The standout episodes weren't typical for Buffy.  The Body is one of the seasons highlights, which is rare for a sci fi show to be able to successfully pull off such an emotionally charged episode.  The big bad was more menacing despite her petty attitude and vanity.  She was seemingly invulnerable and had a group of demon worshippers and crazy slaves.  This season has more of a desperate feel to it.  The gang is outclassed for most of the season and they feel it, if not outright say it. They intended this originally to be the final season, and it shows.  The final is one of the best in the series.
Season Highlights:
Replacement:  Xander is hit with a deomons weapon and returns to find that someone who looks like him is already living his life.  It becomes stranger when he finds out that it is the real him, the weapon split him into a higher and a lower self.  This gives you insight into xanders potential and improved my respect for him.
No Place Like Home:  Joyce is getting ill and Buffy believes the cause to be a supernatural attack against her family.  She goes into a trance and finds something distubing, Joyce isn't being affected by anything magic, and Dawn isn't really her sister.  You also get to see the superpowered Glory, who sucks the sanity out of individuals and seems invulnerable.  She is looking for a key, and seems to be closing in on it.
Family:  We find out why Tara is so shy and withdrawn.  Her domineering family comes over and wants her to return.  They talk about a secret and Tara's time coming up.  She casts a spell that goes awry and the scoobies wonder what she is trying to hide.
Fool For Love:  We learn a lot more about Spike, he isn't just the rebellious British Vampire, he is a person.  We understand why even without a soul he fell in love with both Drusilla and Buffy.  It also has a very touching end, where it shows how strong he really feels.
Listening to Fear:  Buffy and Dawn are nervous about the brain surgery that their mother is about to go through.  Meanwhile some strange extra-terrestrial creature that kills the mentally ills becomes fixated on their mother who has started to act strangely due to her tumor.
Into the Woods:  Buffy and Riley's relationship is put into shambles when Spike shows Buffy something disturbing.  Riley has been going to vampires to let them drink a little of his blood each time he visits.
Triangle:  Willow and Anya accidently release a troll that has previous history with Anya when she was a vengence demon.  He isn't happy about what has been done to him and wants revenge.
Checkpoint:  The gang goes to the Watcher Council for information about Glory.  They are put through a battery of tests to determine if she is worthy of their help.
Blood Ties:  They find out that Dawn is the key.  This of course isn't good news to Dawn who finds out she isn't a real person.
Crush:  Buffy is shocked to find out that Spike has a crush on her. This is compounded with Drusilla's return and the effect it has on Spike.
The Body:  The gang is faced with real tragedy when one of their fold dies from natural causes.  A very emotionally charged and sad episode.
Forever:  The gang is dealing with the death of their friend, Angel returns to help comfort Buffy.
Intervention:  Spike had Warren, introduced earlier this season, to make him a Buffy bot designed for him to be a full functional love bot.  Many of the Scoobies think it is the real thing. Spike is captured by Glories minions thinking he either is the key or knows about it.
Spiral:  Glory discovers that Dawn is the Key and pursues her relentlessly.  Meanwhile an order of Byzantium Knights who are opposed to Glory believe the only way to stop her plans is to kill the key to foil her plans.
Weight of the World:  Dawn has been kidnapped by Glory and Buffy is in a catotonic dream state where she sees many images and possible futures.
The Gift:  They have their 100th episode with a bang.  Glory has the key and plans on opening a gate for a return to her hell dimension.  But there is a problem, the opening of the gate will cause untold damage to this world until the key is killed.  They scoobies also don't know how to face Glory who seems invulnerable.  One of the best season Finale's ever.",1086912000,2,5257,4.48577449947313
1909028,5,B0000AQS18,"This was the season where Buffy gained a sister, lost her mother, dumped Riley, began to feel a once-unthinkable attraction to Spike, and explored the dark side of being a Slayer.  Five seasons in, and the writers still found new ways to question and work with the show's premise.  Exceptional.  Willow's powers, and her relationship with Tara, intensified.  Anya embraced capitalism, Giles toyed with leaving, and Dracula even stopped by for a spell.  Except for one early episode featuring his real-life twin brother, Nicholas Brendon's Xander was in sort of a holding pattern this year.  Clare Kramer was great gorgeous fun as the villain of the year--Glorificus--accessorized with tight dresses, high heels, ""a bad home perm"" (said Spike; though I did not find her ass at all lop-sided), and an entourage of fawning, scabby ""Hobbits with leprosy.""
As the season aired originally, I feared that BTVS had finally jumped the shark with Dawn.  (When she screams, I still feel that way:  get out get out GET OUT!)  But Michelle Trachtenberg, I now realize, was swell.  Her instant bonding with the Scoobies really helped solidify the friends & family dynamic that is my favorite part of this show.  I've always liked the theme that her friendships have kept Buffy inspired to continue fighting beyond the point when past, lonelier Slayers had given up.  Also, regarding the underappreciated Marc Blucas:  the time did seem right to let Riley go, but his growing disillusionment with the military and his place in Buffy's heart was a very good subplot and Blucas played it very well.  He's also, why do I even bother being jealous, one of the best-looking guys I've ever seen on TV.  I wish him luck with whatever comes next for him.  No, I'm not his agent...
Anyone reading this review (thanks, by the way) will have to rely on someone else's opinion about ""The Body"" and the episode following it.  These are the episodes dealing with Joyce's death, from natural causes, about two-thirds of the way through the season.  Since they first aired, I lost my mother, and I doubt I will ever feel up to watching those two episodes on DVD.  I recall that they were well-done but having suffered this unbearable loss in real life prevents my appreciation of the writers' creative take on this subject.  Ditto for the bonus feature on the last disc, ""Natural Causes,"" which discusses the storyline.  I got through 20 seconds of it.  Even seeing Joyce's picture on a table in a scene starts me crying.
Hitting less close to home is the rest of the increased mortality rate in Joss' vision over the last few seasons.  Knowing what's to come in Seasons 6 & 7 makes some of the scenes with Tara and Anya sadder than they were when first aired.
In fact, the losses have REALLY racked up in light of what happened this year on ""Angel.""  Losing Cordelia, Fred, AND Wesley this year, so soon after Tara, Anya, and (what can I say, he ""grew"" on me--pun in there somewhere) Jonathan is a bit too much.  If 14 years of Dawn can be inserted into everyone's memories so easily, surely a few more Jars of Osiris can be found on ebay to revive some of these people for the movies we're all hoping for.  Even for this kind of show, us fans have had to absorb way too many deaths.
""Buffy"" and ""Angel"" have been the best shows on TV for the past few years.  They provided entertainment (and some misery) at a time when I needed it (the entertainment), and still need it, desperately.  Anyone remotely interested in this show will not be disappointed.  Oh yeah, the packaging, the picture quality, the sound (I have DVD stereo now; the Winnebago vs. the Knights of Hack-n-Slash was boomin') are all first-rate.  Like every other season, this is highly recommended.",1086566400,4,3735,4.719135802469136
1909029,4,B0000AQS18,"Season Five was Buffy's last on the WB. While this was a great season, stand alone episodes such as ""I Was Made to Love You"" and ""Listening to Fear"" hurt the show.

1909030,5,B0000AQS18,"In the fifth season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, we are introduced to two new characters. The first is Buffy's sister Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg). She is actually a mystical force of energy sent to Buffy by monks to be protected. The monks supply false memories to Buffy, her mother, and the rest of the gang which causes everyone to think that Dawn has been around and grown up with Buffy. The monks refer to Dawn as ""the key"" which can unlock all the different hell dimensions. The second character we are introduced to is a hell god named Glory (Clare Kramer)who has been banished to earth. She is virtually unstoppable, and not even Buffy can slow her down. Glory needs the key to get back home, which will open up all the other hell dimensions in the process destroying mankind as we know it. But, Glory has no idea what the key looks like. The main focus of season 5 is the countdown to when Glory will find out that Buffy's sister is the key she is looking for. The interesting side story in season 5 deals with Spike's growing feelins for Buffy, and him fighting against the fact that he is falling in love with the Slayer who has become his arch nemisis throughout the show.
While I enjoyed every season, I must say that season 5 managed to be the second best season of the entire show after season 3. The entire season flowed extremely well because each episode built off the one before it. Season 5 definately poured on tons of suspense because endless search for the key. Newcomer Claire Kramer does an excellent job as Glory and becomes the best villan on the show since Angelus. Newcomer Michelle Trachtenberg also does a wonderful job as Dawn. Now a lot of people think that Buffy the Vampire Slayer ""jumped the shark"" when Dawn was introduced. However, I feel that show creator Josh Whedon did an excellent job at how he introduced Dawn into the show and with his explanation of why she was there. Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy), Nicholas Brendon ( Xander), Alyson Hannigan ( Willow), Anthony Stewart Head ( Giles), James Marsters (Spike), and Emma Caulfield( Anya) are all back and do a fantastic job. This season also manages to show Willow's increasing power as a witch as well, and her relationship with Tara grow stronger. Season 5 also marked the tragic death of the character Joyce Summers(played extremely well by Kristine Sutherland) which added even more emotion into season 5.
Whether it was Glory pouring on suspense and Willow gaining more power as a witch, or the hilarious moments watching Spike fall in love with Buffy, season 5 had something in it for all fans of the show. With the acception of season 3, season 5 has become my favorite season overall. Episodes worth mentioning are ""Buffy vs Dracula"", ""No Place like Home"" which introduces Glory, ""Foor for Love"" in which Spike tells Buffy about the two slayers he killed, ""Checkpoint"" which brings back the watchers council, ""Bloodties"" in which Dawn deals with being the key, ""Crush"" which has Drusilla return to the show, ""The Body"" which focuses on Joyce's death, and ""The Gift"" which is the best season finale of the whole show. The DVD package itself is great. You get everything from great comentary and featurettes, to outtakes from the show.
A solid 5 stars...",1085875200,3,3254,4.690559440559441
1909031,5,B0000AQS18,"Season five is fabulous.  Glory was a great villain, and Spikes undying love for Buffy was a hoot.  I also loved the Buffybot and the stunning season finale.  If the series had ended here it would have been a great way to go out, but we would have missed out on the equally good season six.  ""Buffy vs Dracula"", ""Fool For Love"", ""Crush"", ""Intervention"" and ""The Gift"" are the highlights.",1085616000,,387,4.485714285714286
1909032,5,B0000AQS18,"Season five is my favorite of the seven seasons. It's darker and more mature than the previous seasons. The story arc is simply outstanding in season five. Glory,she is my favorite Big Bad. She's funny and very menacing for a small woman. Well,she's a god after all. The introduction of Buffy's sister,Dawn is a good thing. It is of course part of the reason why season five is so great. The average episode quality is remarkable. The drama is the best since season two and the only bad point I could see with this season is that some people may find it too dark. Personally,the darkness of the season really appeals to me. The best episodes are The Body and The Gift. The Body is a very realistic portrayal of death while The Gift is the second best season finale the show's ever had. I love what they do with the characters in season five. Xander and Anya are a really wonderful couple. Same for Willow and Tara.
Thankfully,those great couples don't get broken until season six.
Riley leaves in the middle of the season. To be frank,I don't care too much. Except for poor Buffy who has to suffer a lot,again...These dvds are simply outstanding. The best yet in every way.",1085270400,3,1173,4.537735849056604
1909033,5,B0000AQS18,"The main gripe I have heard concerning the fifth season is the character of Dawn. While I also find the character annoying and very grating; I have also had the pleasure of having a younger brother.  They are this annoying and everything they do seems sophmoric and immature no matter what their age.  I believe that Joss and Co. did a very good job at exposing the annoying side of having a younger sister thrown into the Scooby mix.
First we must remember that most of the writers were writing for a character much younger (12) when they began the development of the character.  Second we must remember that they were trying to juxtapose the younger/older sister relationship at the beginning.  It is expected that Dawn would make bad decisions.  The life she has now is the only thing she knows.  So growing up in Buffy ""I'm the Slayer"" shadow is all she understands. I think the writers did an excellent job of making a character that was resentful and adoring of Buffy relatable to the public.  They had to create and relate this character all within a one season spill.
But there is so much more happening in the arc then just the Buffy/Dawn relationship.  There are the realtionships between Tara/Willow and Zander/Anya to build.  I personally believe the loss of Anya later on was a complete waste.  This is the first time we have the experience of someone from the ""outer realm"" of humanity to give us clue of what is like to suddenly be burrdened by human emotion (greatly exhibited in the episode ""The Body"").  I appreicate the attempt to build the relationship of Willow/Tara through dialogue as oppposed to physical relationship (though I feel that was mainly due to the WB being afraid to delve into a homosexual realtionship).  But we come to love these couples and care about them.  Anya/Zander give us the humor of love and Willow and Tara give us the raw emotion of love.
I also support the use of Spike as a character becoming obsessed and eventually loving the Slayer.  Spike was allowed a much longer time to develop as a character.  It becomes apparent that Spike likes his women tough, strong and a little out of his league.  It is only natural that with the rejection of Druscilla that he would turn to the only other woman really worthy of adoration. Buffy.  But it goes much deeper.  I think Joss was wanting people to understand that while Spike was a vamipre, that something crossed over with him.  The capacity to love.  It is apparent from such episodes as ""Fool For Love"" that Spike is a character driven (by his human nature) to do things for love.  He loved Ceciley, therefore he wrote very bad poetry.  He loved Druscilla and she feared the Slayer so therefore he sought to destroy Buffy.  Buffy respected truth and respect so he sought to give her that.  I believe the fifth season is the first we get to see of the real Spike (beneath the leather coat and fancy lingo).
The ""Big Bad"" Glory ties all of these themes together.  Buffy is doubting her powers.  After not being able to save her mother (note the powerful episode of ""The Body"") to wanting to protect the only thing left of her family, younger sister Dawn. To Willow's vengeance of Tara having her mind ""raped"" by Glory and even to Spike's involvement and help of the Scoobies because he wants to.  It is the best and the worst of these characters.  It shows you all of the redeeming characters (while season 6 focuses on the dark).  Giving Buffy a villian that is nearly unstoppable and makes her doubt her own skills so that she has to rely on everyone else in the group.  It takes the emphasis away from the Slayer just enough to make you worry about her future (which comes as a surprise at the end).
It also ties in all of the things that Buffy has learned until now.  ""Death is your gift"".  What greater sacrifice is yourself for the ones you love that winning.  Buffy proved this in her own death.  Dawn is annoying, grating, and ultimately a person that I personally wouln't kill myself over but if it were my younger sister that I loved and wanted to protect.  I might make that kind of sacrifice ( but I am also ultimately human, with no super human power).  It makes sense that Buffy gave her life.  She understood the short lineage of the Slayer but she could not see life without Dawn.  An innocent.  Something created.  Dawn's only life relvolves around the memories created and now she has lost a mother.  It makes total sense that Buffy would want her to go on with a normal life, the life of an innocent because that is how Buffy feels toward Dawn.  An innocent, no ""key"" busienss.
Episodes to pay attention to ""Fool For Love"" , ""The Body"".  I feel these are the two episodes that let you into Buffy (Spike always seems to say the truth, maybe not in the most couth way, but the truth).  ""The Body"" absolute breathless episode.  I cried almost the whole way throughout and I'm not one for tears.  But it was so right to have a death that Buffy could not prevent (something totally scientific. since she has battled both fronts).  Plus a death that totally unwound the whole Buffy universe.  This episode is worth a second, third, and fourth watch if only to see it from the eyes of the different characters (pay attention to the Willow/Tara/Zander/Anya spill).
The fifth season has proven to be my most favorite because of character exposition.  Everyone comes truly into their own here.  The one season that has caused laugher/tears/embarassement/anger/understanding/ and I watch and only find new things to learn about the characters.
I was not a watcher during the actual series (fortunatley I had someone open my eyes much later on).  So maybe I can't compare to those watching week to week but watching this way has allowed me to see character developement and story arc so closely entertwined.  I spend many sleepless nights watching each episode unwilling to let any time elapse between episodes.  I hope you can see the same and see that fifth season was the perfect union between reality and Sci-Fi that was ever accomplished in the series.",1083369600,5,6062,4.60111835973905
1909034,5,B0000AQS18,"By far one of the greatest Buffy seasons around! Buffy the Vampire Slayer; Season FIVE. I love this season, because it stars one of my favorite actress' and villian in the entire series, her being ""Glory"" (Clare Kramer) A Hell God, trapped in our dimension, with the only means to find this ""Key"", and is willing to kill anyone who stands in her way. We also meet the Buffy's little sister, ""Dawn"" (Michelle Trachtenberg), whom mysteriously just appears in the series without any heads up; But does later explain itself during the season. I rate this season, 5 stars. Joss Whedon did it again.",1083369600,,593,4.711538461538462

It was just so depressing during a lot of the times. I do enjoy this season but not like others though. I thought they went to far when Joyce died so suddenly. I still haven't been able to watch it since I saw it on television.
 Even so this season probably has some of the best writing that was ever presented in Buffy the Vampire Slayer before.
On the whole this is a really good season. Just be prepared for a lot of tear jerker episodes.",1083196800,2,647,4.015503875968992
1909036,5,B0000AQS18,"Oh my god, Joss Whedon is a master genius. Season 5 has it all, including a lot of emotional writing, which is my favorite part of the show. The Death of Joyce had me in tears for weeks, Buffy's death had me in tears for mouths and the acting had me in guts of shock because it was, and still is as beautiful as ever.
The introduction of Dawn is a shocker and was throughout the series. It was nice to see Dracula as it has been a long wait.
Glory is my favorite baddie and had me in fits of laughter throughout the season. Even though I don't like Riley, I was sorry to see him go as I felt really sorry for him through the beginning of this season. Spike is great as ever. Willow and Tara's relationship is really beautiful and secure and committed and just was really nice to see a gay couple who were genine on television. They weren't a gay couple to get ratings up, they were a couple that were important to the storyline.

#5 suddenly introduces Dawn, Buffy's 14 y/o sister.
The question of why is answered by the appearance of Glory, an unstoppable evil deity. She is searching for ""The Key"" and the series unfolds.
Dawn is somewhat of a pest, jealous of her big sister. But ""confused"" people who see Dawn tells her wierd things, that she's not real.
Giles becomes a businessman, no longer an unemployed librarian/watcher. Buffy asks that he become her watcher again and he accepts gladly.
Anya becomes a bigger part of the gang as Xander's devotion for her grows.
Joyce becomes ill, Spike is in love with Buffy now, even though she is his mortal foe.
Willow and Tara heat up the screen with their affections towards each other.

And what a transition season it would be. Buffy season five is the best season of the show, save the equally excellent final season. The show is truly great. Viewers see Buffy evolve into a truly formidable slayer, Willow become a powerful witch, Spike become a hero, and other characters become the best they could.

Overall I loved the season. Just wished they had a little more recovery time between the emotionally draining shows.",1081382400,,357,4.424242424242424
1909040,5,B0000AQS18,"This is probably one of my favorite Buffy seasons, if not the best one out there.  As the final season on the WB the finale is probably the most emotionally charged as a special goodbye courtesy of creator Joss Whedon.  New characters and relationships are introduced and solidified in many cases.  Buffy gains a family member yet loses another one, ends a relationship and plays with starting a new confusing one.  Xander and Anya, and Tara and Willow grow much closer this season, as does the viewers attraction to the relationships formed on the show.  The supervillan this season is none other then a slightly insane fallen God by the name of Glory who is looking for a magical 'key' that will let her return home - at the expense of the Earth.
The big theme of this season is acceptance - of what the characters can't control, of new people in their lives, and of what they must do to benefit others, particularly shown in the 100th episode, ""The Gift"".
The thing aobut Season 5 is that there isn't as many singular episodes that stand-out but an amazing rippling effect that makes you appreciate all the details of the finale that much more.  However some particularly well-done episodes include ""The Body"" which features no score whatsoever, a rare case for most dramatic tv series, particularly for this episode.  ""Blood Ties"" Is a great metaphorical episode for youths watching and a powerful 'key' to the season.  ""I Was Made To Love You"" The first episode featuring one of the famed robot girls (like the Buffybot) is interesting only as precursor to the impact of the Buffy-bot created by Spike.  Finally ""The Weight of the World"" and ""The Gift"" are both incredibly well done and lead to a powerful ending and goodbye as Buffy leaves the WB and heads to UPN for the final two seasons.  A must have season as the acting is phenomenal and sets up the most relationship-filled seasons to come.",1081036800,3,1902,4.684684684684685

  My vote is definitely YES. This was not only the low water mark for the series, but for me it was the end of the series. A series which, pre-Dawn, I had enjoyed very much.
  After tolerantly watching the first three episodes of season five, patiently waiting for any kind of explanation of where this stupid annoying brat of a little sister came from, I gave up.
  As far as I'm concerned, Buffy had four great seasons before she was slain by lazy writing.",1079827200,12,570,4.330188679245283
1909043,5,B0000AQS18,"Every year of Buffy is intense, moving, funny, and relative, but the fifth season magnifies each of these qualities. With the fun stuff that is Buffy vs. Dracula, the season then introduces Michelle Trachtenberg as Dawn, and thus begins the goodness that is the fifth season. Aside from season two and the Buffy / Angel / Angelus story arc, the Dawn / Buffy / Glory story arc is the next to have as much emotion and structure. Some saw Dawn as annoying, as did I, but in the end, the storyline changed that idea for me.
 I know it's said everywhere, but this season also produced one of Joss' best episodes, The Body. It is an episode that shows almost true brilliance from Joss, as the director, and superb performances from the cast. And I've never spared so many tears for a tv show as I did during the season finale, The Gift. Not even did the series finale hit such an emotional spot.
 As for the DVD set itself, it's a step up from the fourth season, as each season steps up.  Plenty of commentaries from Joss and writers/directors/producers. These commentaries are the most interesting to sit and listen to if you're a devote fan, but great listens with a little filler if you aren't. The featurettes are there as always, even more this time around (the ""Natural Causes"" covering The Body is one of the more interesting, and seeing Clare Kramer speak on Glory in the ""Story of Season 5"" is great). Also included are Outtakes, finally, but just some from the first 3 seasons. They're still great.
 Buffy's fifth season is my favorite out of all of the seasons, whether it be because of the story arc, superb cast (Sarah MG's and Alyson Hannigan's best moments are here), great directing, or just because the relation to the characters ... it's unknown. As for all other Buffy fans, it varies. As for those who aren't fans, then I recommend going back and purchasing season one and then subsequently purchasing the other seasons. It's worth it.

1909044,4,B0000AQS18,"I couldn't believe it. Over a months time I sat and watched every episode, in order, until I reached the season finale. It was then I realized I had been cheated out of one of the best moments in Buffy history. When the episode aired on television, there was an introduction where moments from the first five seasons were shown in rapid succession while a type of thriller-horror film soundtrack was played. The images and music were played at an accelerating pace until it reached such a fevered pitch that the screen practically exploded into the next shot where the camera follows a chase down a dark ally. Somehow, to my crushing disbelief, this intro didn't find its way onto the DVD. What the hell? Hay Fox, this isn't the complete fifth season.
The shows themselves gets five stars. Getting screwed out of a fantastic Buffy moment on the DVD gets four stars.",1079049600,4,865,4.660130718954249
1909045,5,B0000AQS18,"After the mixed results of Season 4 on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, I held off for a long time on seeing Season 5.  But when I finally did, my faith in the series was neatly restored.
The producers kept the strange narrative experiments to a manageable level in this season and went for muscular plot and character developments instead, and they reapt the handsome rewards.  Whedon and his writers talk in the featurettes about ""bringing the show back to family"", and we see that this well is never dry.  I'm not a big fan of ""The Body"", an expressionistic meditation on grief that's bold in execution, but also unengaging in its distantness.  It's as close to Brechtian Verfremdung (""alienation"") as I've seen in a TV show.  Daring, but also unmoving -- it took ensuing episode ""Forever"" to get back to the heart of the matter.  The beginning of the season also lags, with the season premier introducing uber-vampire Dracula, who proceeds to yak about evil and darkness and psychosexual melodrama for 40 minutes.
Other than these two duds, though, the show rips into some harrowing emotional territory -- and some of the sharpest comedic writing since Season 2.  By now we expect no less than magic from Alyson Hannigan and Nicholas Brendon, and they never disappoint.  Newcomer Michelle Trachtenberg is radiant as Dawn, equal parts bratty adolescent, volcanic emotional wreck, and smart-aleck pottymouth.  Emma Caulfield and James Marsters, as ex-demon Anya and perennial vampire favourite Spike, finally get the character layers they've always deserved, and Caulfield's straight-faced weirdness provides the season with some of its best jokes.  Clare Kramer is also great as Glory, a hellfire entity with the strength of mountains and a mess of loose screws in her head.  I was shocked to see how different she is in interviews.  The one character who doesn't work is Riley -- his chemistry with Buffy has never been strong, but in this season, without a grounding central plot that's integral to him, he simply carries no emotional weight, and actor Marc Blucas' comic timing just pales alongside the unpredictable energy of Trachtenberg and old pros like Hannigan and Marsters.  No Eliza Dushku guest appearance either, sadly (you have to go to the Angel show for that).
The storylines are engaging, with the Dawn story being the deserved centerpiece, culminating in a slamming finale that's the best Buffy finale I've ever seen, and possibly the best directing work I've seen from creator Joss Whedon.  Spike's warped attraction to Buffy is a stretch, but resolves beautifully near the end; Willow and Tara (the lovable Amber Benson)'s relationship nearly brought me to tears; and Xander's growing relationship to Anya is hugely satisfying, especially to old fans of the show who have known Xander from the beginning.
This season is like a shot of adrenalin to the series, rejuvenating a series that was getting a bit long in the tooth.  Highly recommended.",1078444800,,2960,5.036885245901639

  Highlights of this always great series in its 4th season is ""BuFFy VS. Dracula"" the name exsplains it all a showdown that Buffy had to face at some point during the show..The actor who played Dracula also played Dracula in a movie ""Dracula : Dark Prince"" from the same year 2000..Xander in this episode lampoons the ""Renfield"" character from the classic immortal vampire story..""Real Me"" Introduces the character of ""Dawn"" Buffy's suddon apperance teenage sister..""The Replacement"" is a HILARIOUS Double Xander episode (remember the double WiLLow episodes from season 4)..Watch for Xander's ""Snoopy Dance"" is plain silly but will make you laugh so hard..In ""No place like home"" reveals the secret behind who Dawn really is and where she came from..""Family"" is about Tara's Family featuring Amy Adams & what Tara may or may not be..""Fool For Love"" is a long overdue episode about the past centuries of Spike..Even how he became a vampire..Watch for on the Subway is Spike's full out Billy Idol immitation..""Listening to Fear"" the booklet says its a spider like monster..It is actully more of a slug caterpiller like Monster..Words of Giles & Xander can say it best ""A Killer Snot Monster From Outer Space"" how bout that for a B Movie sci fi title of the 50s..LoL..""Triangle"" is a battle with a Troll who used to date Anya in her demon days..He bares a remarkable resemblance to Jessie Ventura..""Blood Ties"" Dawn finds out the truth of who she really is..Links up with Spike..The result is Michelle ""Dawn"" powerful performance..""Crush"" is a fun love triangle BuFFy Harmony And the return of Druscilla all with the fun as alwayS Spike..""I was made to love you"" a HOT robot girl comes to Sunnydale looking for the guy who created her to love him..""The Body"" never has an episode ever hit me as this one did..So much so i have no idea if i can take it again..
Emotional..I don't want to ruin it but when Dawn gets the bad news the way they filmed it with barely audible silence is very original and very effective..They use silence a few times here and it really hits the viewer..Very little but some comedy relief..I challage you to take it without ripping your heart out..""Forever"" another team up of Dawn and Spike to bring the person that dies in ""The Body"" back from the dead..""Intervention"" A BuFFy robot a Buffybot to love and please Spike..And all of last disc is more then remarkable as the story of Dawn's destiny as the key comes to a head in true BuFFy climax fashion..Needless to say as always hard to choose highlights from ANY BuFFy Seasons..
  This season is the debut of BuFFy's Teen Sister ""Dawn""..
She is remarkably played by Michelle Trachtenburg..Picture a bratty version of Willow..She even looks lot like Willow from the first few seasons..Should've been Willow's sister they look so much alike..Only difference Dawn has dark hair..She is so cute beautiful girl in the tradition of this show having the sexiest girls..I am told she is older then she plays..She is a wonderful addition to the club..In Xander's words he calls Dawn ""DAWNPATROL""..
  This set again has great insightful & fun extras..Featurettes a plenty..This set has something that was more then a pleasant suprise that sadly the other sets didn't have..Outakes/Bloopers..I was excited when i saw that..A show that is this much fun you can tell the cast is having fun..Its a wonder never shared the Outakes Bloopers til now..Thanks for sharing them with us finally..And a fantastic featurette all about Dawn..Among other treats from BuFFyLand..Some on disc 3 some on disc 4..Enjoy..
  I end this review by saying collect all the Buffy seasons on dvd..They keep getting better with every season..And this season # 5 is proof of that fact..This tv series never lets you down but always delivers better then any modern day series can..Truly one of a kind series..Now we await anxiously Season 6 in May..*does Xander's Snoopy dance and signs off til May* ScOOby SnackS For ALL :)LOL:)",1078444800,,4630,4.800501882057716

1909050,5,B0000AQS18,"The 5th season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer started out innocently enough with ""Buffy vs. Dracula"" but ended with an earth shattering revelation--Buffy has a sister!
Ok so that isn't really ""earth shattering""  but it is a major development in the series.  The introduction of Dawn was a brilliant move by Joss.  It created season five of Buffy.  Dawn=The Key.  The Key is saught by Glory (A hell god none the less).  Glory was probably the best villian in the history of the show/any TV show.  She was crazy, she was creepy, she was unstoppable.  The makings of a fantastic season.
All 22 episodes of season five are amazing in their own right.  They all deal with furthering the arc of the season and the arc of the series.  The love that Spike had for Buffy, Buffy's love interest being her sister, Xander and Anya falling deeper in love, Tara and Willow having a great relationship.  All of that would come into play in the sixth season.  But the major plot development happened in ""The Gift"" at the very end.
Buffy's death was forseeable but still unforseeable as well.  All indications would be that Dawn would have to die and Buffy would quit being a vampire slayer, which would have been interesting too.  But killing off the main and title character was unbelievable.
This season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer is not to be missed.  It is the most complete season the show has had to that point and utterly fantastic.  One of my most favorite seasons.",1076284800,9,1455,4.603112840466926
1909051,5,B0000AQS18,"I wasn't all that thrilled with the initial broadcast of Season Five. After the program left the WB, I was left out in the cold without UPN in my cable lineup; I wound up watching it in 6-hour marathons after my sister sent me a tape (coincidentally, six weeks or so apart). That's no way to enjoy the show; I realize after watching this DVD set it should be 4-hour marathons, every day for a week (six days for the episodes, one for the bonus materials).
There are some very nice touches in Season Five. Certainly, ""The Body"" was dramatic and the entire ""Decline of Ms. Joyce Summers"" was well handled, but there were smaller things that I think make the season successful. First of all, there's the ""Maturation of Xander Harris"" arc. From the ""nobody's butt-monkey"" line in the season opener, clear through to his proposal in the season finale, Xander did a lot of growing up in Season Five. Likewise, Anya came to terms with not only her mortality, but also her humanity: her speech in ""The Body,"" not only recognizing that people die, but that there are expectations as to how the survivors behave, was one of the more poignant moments in the episode. Spike also became more human in this season - okay, not literally, but he established an emotional link with Buffy that begins his redemption arc that stretches to the series finale. I'm pretty much Dawn-neutral (it wasn't until Season Six where the same ""shelter Dawn"" note is played over and over and over again that I became annoyed with her character, and maybe that'll change after I get the next DVD set); her character had to go through the same growing pains that the rest of the cast did four seasons earlier so I wasn't in a hurry to judge her this time around.
The DVD has some good extras. If you normally watch the show dubbed in a foreign language, then the ""Buffy Abroad"" featurette will be less interesting to you than might otherwise have been the case. The featurettes on Dawn and ""The Body"" are informative looks at what the producers and writers were shooting for. The keyhole animation that transitions you from the menu into the episode gets old fast. ""Previously"" and ""Next Week"" synopses would have been nice additions, but weren't included. The DVD-ROM demon guide is well-constructed if not overly deep; Danny Strong's demon featurette is poor in comparison.
If you're a Buffy fan you'll be buying this set regardless of the reviews ... fortunately you'll likely be pleased with your purchase. If you're not yet a Buffy fan, start with Season One, watch four episodes a day and you'll be here by the end of the month. Happy viewing!",1076025600,3,2614,4.66017316017316
1909052,5,B0000AQS18,"The only word that I have to describe this Buffy season, is. . . .Awesome. This is definitely one of my favorite seasons. The comedy and drama are both much better then the first four seasons, and the first four were very funny and dramatic. One contribution to the funny would have to be the full time character of Anya. The DVD screens and menus are all very nice. I would recomend this dvd collection to anyone who likes buffy as much as I do.",1075507200,2,446,4.258823529411765
1909053,5,B0000AQS18,"Until I saw this season I thought it would get no better then Season 3 (my second favorite season).  Ulike any of the early seasons, this one has no filler episodes.  Every episode as a purpose, with outstanding writing.  Season 5 is also the most serious and emotion season of them all.  My only major gripe is the introduction of Dawn.  I hate how she was brought into the show.  Her character is fine, and brings out more of Buffy's personality, but the *poof* Dawn appears out of magic and EVERYONE remembers her as if she was with them since birth was lame.  Thankfully to redeem itself for this misdeed Rylie is eventually taken out of the show (couldn't stand him).
Episodes like ""Buffy vs. Dracula"", ""The Replacement"", ""Out of My Mind"", ""Fool For Love"", ""The Body"" (very, very, very sad episode, also one of the best), ""Forever"", ""Spriral"" (one of my alltime favorites), and ""The Gift"" make this the best season ever.",1075334400,,925,4.638036809815951
1909054,5,B0000AQS18,"Buffy's season 5 has a very complicated story line.  For those of us that loved the show as it was, being season 2 the greatest of all, and with Angel as the best baddie of all, we suddenly get Dawn, Buffy's new love interest and her sister!.
Dawn comes to upset the confort zone in which we all were with Buffy season 1 to 4.  In season 5 we get Glory, which is a very good but quite complicated baddie.  And we also get little sister Dawn, a tipical teenager that you start by hating, and end up loving her.  Moreover, we lose Buffy's mother to a horrible natural disease.  I would say that Buffy season 5 is more than ever about emotions, and the writers play our emotions masterfully around the one topic of Dawn.  The baddie Glory is not as important as all the emotions that we go through with Dawn.  We begin hating her as an impostor and an intruder, then we grieve with her, Joice's loss, so that at the end we cannot but love her and protect her just as Buffy feels that she has to do.
Other stories really develop well in this season.  Willow relationship with Tara is strength beyond any misgivings when we suffer what Willow suffers for Tara.  Xander relationship with Anya gets stronger.  Giles actually kills Glory, letting us get a glimpse of Ripper's personality.  And last but not least, we can share Spike's love for Buffy and not just idolatration as was in the case of Riley.
So, Buffy Season 5 is Complicated and Difficult.  A rollercoaster of emotions masterfully played.",1075161600,4,1494,4.452205882352941
1909055,5,B0000AQS18,"Buffy the Vampire Slayer audience. Got a very different taste for season five,
of our favorite heroine and her friends.
The season starts off with it's if not typical comedy mixed with magic,
chaos, and romps around the cemetery.
But all of this changes when the God Glory comes to town.
And starts to wreck Buffy's family and friends.
No one knew if Buffy would be able to stop her.
But that isn't even the begging of her problems this season.
When Joyce becomes ill Buffy finds herself having to play the slayer role
and being more of a mom to her `sister' Dawn.
The Scoobies are of course all ways there to help her.
But nothing can prepare them for the episode `The Body
 and what happens after.",1074816000,,699,4.4186046511627906
1909056,5,B0000AQS18,"The fifth season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer was a transitional season of the series to say the least.  Beginning with Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) battling Dracula (yes, you read that right) and introducing Buffy's sister Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg) who appears out of nowhere and everyone knows her, but she's new to us.  How is this possible you ask?  Dawn is actually ""the key""; a form of pure energy that can unlock the gates between dimensions that was made into a human form and sent to the Slayer for protection, while false memories of Dawn were implanted into the minds of Buffy, her mother (Kristine Sutherland), the Scoobies, and everyone else.  Why?  There's a very, very, VERY, evil force named Glory (Clare Kramer) who is after said key, but as the above Amazon review says, Glory's not a demon, she's something much, much worse: a god.  This is where many of the show's fans began to lose interest in the show and felt that the introduction and story of Dawn was just too much.  However, the fifth season of Buffy is pure brilliance from beginning to end, and Joss Whedon and his creative team deserve all the credit they can get for taking this gamble.  Many pivotal events take place as well: including duplicate Xander's (Nicholas Brendon), Spike (James Marsters) declaring his love for Buffy, Riley (Marc Blucas) leaves after Buffy makes herself emotionally distant towards him, and the sudden death of Buffy's mother which is followed by one of the best episodes in the series called ""The Body"" in which we see Buffy and Dawn deal with the aftermath of they're mother's passing.  Buffy's ultimate sacrifice in the season finale set the stage for quite a cliffhanger before the series left the WB and moved to UPN for two more seasons.  All in all, the fifth season of Buffy contained some of the best moments of the series, and some of the best acting (Gellar, Trachtenberg, and Marsters are superb) to come along since the second season.  However, the best Buffy was still on the horizon.",1074816000,6,2012,4.769452449567724
1909057,2,B0000AQS18,"Now I am a huge Buffy fan but this season was VERY DISSAPOINTING. First of all Dawn's character should have been killed off. It was not enjoyable watching the show with her in it, but I didn't want to miss anything that would be in any later episodes or seasons, so I forced myself to watch it. I know Miss Trachtenberg really wanted to be on the show but I hope she knows she really ruined it. Even though Sarah is a good actress she couldn't pull off that she loved Dawn so much she would sacrifice herself instead of letting Dawn jump to her death at the end. Dawn has nothing to contribute to the world, she is worthless and useless and has a piss poor attitude. Nothing but grief with that child. The writers and Joss Whedon were so off with the story line. The Glory storyline and Willows incresing power was good. I liked that Joyce died of natural causes that made it even more powerful and sad. Everyone elses character was all good but there was too big a mistake with the whole Dawn thing to make this season a winner. Dawn's character should have just own up to the fact that she needed to be killed and should've done it herself, it would've been the only honorable thing she would have accomplished but she couldn't even bring herself to do that much because she was too selfish. And Buffy's character was so stupid to not accept that Dawn had to go, it irritated me that she told Giles and everyone else that no one's to hurt Dawn and once the ritual begins then everyone dies, I mean way to go with making sure your friends lives and Giles(who's her father figure)are going to be safe even though they stuck by her and helped her for years, which is a much longer period of time that Buffy really was in contact with Dawn. Choosing Dawn over everyone else, maybe Buffy does deserve to die. I never really had anything bad to say about Buffy the series until this season. SO IN ALL SEASON 5 WAS POOR.",1074384000,12,1915,4.322222222222222
1909058,5,B0000AQS18,"Season 5 takes a unique approach:  Buffy and her friends have a lot of adjusting to do.  Buffy's world is continually turned upside down, her friends are not always going to be there for her, there's an odd love/hate relationship with ANOTHER vampire, and there's some little storyline that hinges on an invented kid sister.  A really creative story arc will keep you saying, ""just one more episode.""  It really is addictive.  Plus, the fact that there are no commercials helps a lot with the cliffhangers!
  I refuse to bore you with my rating of each individual episode.
I don't think anyone should have that much time on their hands.  If you're looking at this, chances are you've seen enough of the show to know that it is a well written, well acted program that has a lot to offer.  What you want to know is, ""Is it worth my 40 bucks?""
  As for extras, this dvd series does more for the fans than any other I've come across.  Featurettes, galleries, interviews, commentaries, scripts, a gag reel...you name it...they've put it in here for us.  Top-notch show.  Top-notch dvd set.  Definitely worth the 40 bucks.",1074124800,9,1116,4.651282051282052
1909059,4,B0000AQS18,"Season 5 introduced us to Dawn, Buffy's sister.  I guess people are split in this development but I always liked Dawn and had hoped that perhaps she might star in a spin-off, to no avail.
Anyway we find out that Dawn isn't really a person, she's a mystical Key keeping powerful, other world Gods from entering our realm.  One of those Gods, the beautiful and shape-changing Glory wants the key in the worst way.
The Glory story-line pretty much runs through most of the season, culminating with Buffy's sacrifice in the final episode.  Along the way there are several self-contained episodes such as Buffy Vs. Dracula.  This is a funny episode although one would hope that Dracula was somewhat more powerful although I think that's what they were going for.
Spike becomes more of a main character this season as well as we start to see the first signs of his love for Buffy and his protectiveness of Dawn.
And of course we have the haunting and sad passing of Buffy's mom and the aftermath on the Scooby Gang.
Theses sets get better and better with more great special features.  There are commentary tracks on a handful of episodes and several great featurettes.  These people really know how to do DVDs!
All in all a great set and well worth the money.",1073952000,,1253,4.621621621621622
1909060,5,B0000AQS18,"Like all the seasons before and after, you got to love it.  They took some diffrent angles and points of view and twisted them even more.

1909061,4,B0000AQS18,"I think if this season ended Buffy it would have went out with a bang, the upcoming final two seasons of Buffy will be seriously lacking, and will show the WB years were the best for the show overall.
The introduction of Dawn will end the mystery that started way back at the end of season 3, the dream sequence with Buffy & Faith sets up what will be the coming of Dawn 2 years later, ""little miss muffet counting down to 730"", and the end of season 4 in ""Restless"" where dream Tara informs Buffy ""Be back before Dawn"". I also liked where the crazy man called Dawn curds and whey in front of the magic box (little miss muffet) to finally solve the mystery for those who didn't figure it out yet.
My biggest problem was how the writers dealt with Spike in season 5, and the huge plot oversight in why after repeated attempts even chipped of doing evil he remained unstaked, in season 4 they gave the really dumb excuse of him being helpless with the chip as the reason, in season 5 Spike almost caues the death of Riley in ""Out of My Mind"" and seems to come close to having his chip removed by stealing the Dr who was there to help Riley, kidnaps Buffy and threatens to have Drew kill her if she doesn't admit she loves him in ""Crush"", and various breaking and entering,stalking and clothes stealing, not to mention the Buffybot, yet other than threats of staking, the danger he truly still represents is looked over and never addressed.
Xander finally finds something he is good at, and leads to a very good income with construction, and has some really good scenes with Buffy as the heart of the group ""I was made to love you"" and some good scenes in ""The Replacement"" the character who seemed to be directionless with various bad jobs in season 4, is set up to be the only one with a future career in season5.
Willow is starting to become very powerful and uses dark magic to fight Glory after she attacks Tara in ""Tough Love"", a preview of how the lure of Dark magic can corrupt even good natured Willow.
Giles is back as Buffy's watcher and re-instated with the council.
Riley leaves thinking that Buffy can't be with a normal guy, and him being just human can't compete with her old love of Angel, ""Into the Woods""
Buffy I think has finally come to terms that she will never have a normal life, with the death of her mother ""The Body"", a sister to now take care of who is being sought by a hell god, dropping out of college, Riley leaving and the hopes of having a normal relationship with him, and her final sacrifice in ""The Gift"" which would have been a good ending for the character of Buffy Summers.
I think season 5 would have been a great ending for a great show, the scooby gang defeated their most powerful foe, Glory a god, and with Buffy's death it would have had a conclusion to Buffy's saga..It is worth a purchase.",1073779200,2,2834,4.338983050847458
1909062,5,B0000AQS18,"Season five is a truly stunning feat of filmmaking. The artistic highpoint was the episode titled ""The Body"" which was one of the most brilliant dramatic works I've ever seen, that faithfully captured the pain and loss and shock... and boredom... of death. Whedon, who based the episode on his own experiences losing his mom, created something that provides no relief to the viewer, from the spare and desolate camerawork to the absence of a musical soundtrack. This, I thought to myself, is art.
Lots of great episodes, but the best is the conclusion of the series, ""The Weight of the World"" and ""The Gift"". I guarantee that you will wear out your DVD player's remote, replaying the moment when Buffy realizes her destiny, her final narration to Dawn, and jumps from the top of the tower to seal the portal that threatens the world...  I thought this is as beautiful and as mythic and as dramatic as the final moments of Hidden Dragon, Crouching Tiger, when Zhang Ziyi jumps to her death from the Taoist monastery. Every moment of the teleplay was lovingly, artistically, and perfectly rendered.
This season was one of the best reasons to own a television... ever.",1073692800,,1165,4.796019900497512

Included in the Season 5 set are numerous commentaries (more than previous seasons) and a couple of fun featurettes, as well as a CDRom.  This season is a must-have.",1073692800,,352,4.46875
1909064,5,B0000AQS18,"Many fans of the show believe that the two best seasons were the third and fifth, and I definitely see where they are coming from.  While I believe that the third was a little better than this one, I must say that this one was a close second.  This season starts off with an amusing confrontation between Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and Count Dracula (Rudolph Martin).  At the end of the season premiere, we are thrown a real curveball; a new character named Dawn (Michelle Tractenberg), who it seems is Buffy's sister.  For those of you who have just started watching Buffy, and have not yet seen or know anything about this season, you may be a little confused.  Afterall, in the four previous seasons, there has never been any mention of Buffy's sister, although there have been hints.  Anyway, we are soon introduced to Ben (Charlie Weber), an intern at the hospital who develops a crush on Buffy.  At first, Buffy has eyes only for Riley (Marc Blucas), until he leaves to go fight in Belize, and then Buffy develops feelings for Ben.  But Ben has a dark secret; he is somehow connected to a creature named Glory (Clare Kramer), a creature who turns out to be a God from a Hell Demension.  Glory is like no one Buffy has ever met; stronger, faster, and has more stamina than any villain Buffy has ever met.  Fortunately, she isn't the smartest one.  Anyway, Glory needs something called ""The Key"" in order to fulfill her master plan, and Buffy will do anything to protect it.
In this season, the gang is put the toughest trials that they have ever been through, especially near the end of the season when Willow's (Alyson Hannigan) lover loses her mind, Spike (James Marsters) begins falling in love with Buffy, and Buffy learns Dawn's true nature.
As great as this season was, there were naturally some flaws, problems, and gray areas.  Beware, this paragraph contains spoilers.  Okay, I always thought that the Slayer had about the same strength as vampires did, but when Spike tried to pick up Olaf the Troll's hammer, he couldn't even lift it an inch off the ground.  However, Buffy could wield it better than Olaf himself.  Second, I don't understand why Ben never killed himself.  I know that he didn't want to die, but he had to have realized that it would have been for the good of the cause.  On that same note, why was Dawn so angry at him; I know that she didn't want to die either, but her death would have saved millions.  Finally, the way Ben/Glory died was a little anti-climactic.  Here is this God, who twice before had beaten Buffy's butt, but at the end, Buffy wailed on her.  The fight they had was great, but then, when she turned back into Ben, Buffy left him to live.  She knew that the only way to kill Glory was to kill Ben.  Then Giles (Anthony Stewart Head) came and strangled him.  I just never pictured Giles as a killer.
The end of this season is very powerful and sad; it could have made a good series finale, but I'm glad that Joss Whedon decided to keep the show going.  All of the actors did incredible jobs, the stories were amazing this season, and the emotions were better than ever.  Some episodes to check out are Buffy vs. Dracula, The Replacement, No Place Like Home, Checkpoint, Blood Ties, Intervention, Spiral, Weight of the World, and The Gift.",1073520000,,3295,4.54406779661017

Season Five demonstrates yet again that Joss is never prepared to just tread water with his show, taking new twists and featuring possibly the best ""big bad"" of all the series.",1073174400,2,492,4.51685393258427

However, she finds herself facing one of her greatest challenges when a fashion-plate hell-goddess makes her appearance in Sunnydale.  Complicating matters are the serious illness of Buffy's mother, the sudden appearance of a previously unknown little sister, and the unwanted affections of former foe Spike.  For many fans, this fifth season of the popular cult TV hit, marked a high point in the series. From its opening homage to the classic Dracula films to its tragic cliffhanger, this season was awash with classic moments.  Some of the best single episodes occurred during this season including the fun ""A Fool for Love,"" which reveals Spike's true origin, as well as ""The Body,"" a truly classic examination of how death affects the family and friends left behind.
As always, Sarah Michelle Gellar is a treat to watch in the title role, while Anthony Stewart Head provides both support and humor as her mentor, Giles.  Alyson Hannigan is sweet and humorous as Buffy's best friend, Willow.  James Marsters continues to delight with his wry portrayal of the vampire Spike, while Claire Kramer is appropriately goofy and dangerous as the hell-goddess Glory.  Special mention must go to Kristine Sutherland, who turns a touching performance as Buffy's mom in her last full season on the show.
The DVD once again features the usual mix of art galleries, featurettes and director/writer commentaries.  This time, we actually get an outtake reel from the show as well, mainly from the show's 3rd season.

Now she is GREAT. She should have her own spin-off. So should Willow & Tara. Nearly everyone was GREAT this season, EXCEPT Dawn. Ugh. What a disaster putting her in the show was. Buffy should not have had to waste so many tears on that little wench.

1909073,5,B0000AQS18,"The dominating theme is loss during the fifth season. Buffy's mom dies during season 5 most unexpectantly and that allows the series to examine things from a very different perspective. It was near the end of the show's run and, as a result, Whedon began to dive into a number of interesting themes and plots he hadn't tackled before.
I didn't take immediately to Buffy; while I think Joss Whedon is a talented writer (he's a third generation writer; his father and grandfather were both writers for film and television as well), I tuned out the show at first because of all the praise. It made me suspicious. I'm happy to say that I've changed my tune.
Season 5 had some of the best episodes of the series (I did catch up on it in syndication and DVD for comparison sake). The best episode, for me, was ""The Gift"" where Buffy sacrafices herself for someone very important to her. This fine episode (which deserved an Emmy)brought the themes explored earlier in the season full circle.
The picture quality is very good for most of the discs. I did notice that there were some minor digital compression problems particularly on some of the darker looking episodes. Still, that's not a surprise given the amount of material packed into this terrific boxed set.
The extras are pretty generous as well although it lacks one important person--Sarah Michelle Gellar. While I don't expect anything profound from her or anybody else in the cast for that matter, as an actor her take on her evolving character would have made this trip to Sunnyvale far more interesting.
Regardless, this is a fine boxed set and Whedon manages to plug in his skewed view of life on the key episodes he authored. In light of the end of Buffy and the cancelled Firefly (a series that was never given the opportunity to take flight by Fox. They axed the show in another demonstration of their bad choices during that particular season)all that's left is Angel.

1909075,3,B0000AQS18,"By this point, you either get that Buffy the Vampire Slayer is the best thing that ever happened on TV or you don't.  You who get it have likely have cemented your perspective on where Season 5 falls relative to the rest of the brilliance that is Buffy. I'm not referring to any of that, this is just about the DVD set.
While Buffy episodes alone always justify the price of admission, the DVD special features have never been as in depth or as interesting as one would expect from the creators of such a carefully and passionately crafted show. We're given scripts for a few episodes from every season-but what, the bulk were maybe improvised? Many episodes scream for nonexistent audio commentary tracks-surely somebody on the cast or crew had something to say, and could spare a day out of their life to add it to the historical record of this historic program. And if we're to be given a marketing pitch, I'd rather hear about the obscure bands that create the mood of the show and find out where to purchase their CD's than see commercials for the show or ads for the video game.
That said, Season 5 represents what I sincerely hope is the nadir of special features.  ""The Body"", arguably television's finest hour, is treated appropriately with commentary by Joss Whedon and a terrific featurette. There were, however, 21 other episodes. Among them is scattered . . . not much really. Jane Espenson gives an insightful and moving commentary over ""I Was Made to Love You"" and there are a couple of fun featurettes (one a pseudo Discovery Channel style documentary hilariously hosted by Danny Strong). Aside from that, there are a few other fairly lame commentaries by various folk who seem to barely remember making the episode in question, random scripts, a worse then usual still gallery, and even less! Here's hoping this is a mid-series slump and not an indication of greater disappointments to be discovered in the DVD collections of the final two seasoans.",1072396800,,1966,4.745614035087719
1909076,5,B0000AQS18,"Season 5 in my opinion was one of the best seasons of Buffy, Joss and co. took what could have been huge mistakes (dawn, joyce's death, spikes love for buffy) and made them wonderful decisions and now looking back I can't imagine it being any other way.  Although looking back many people consider season 6 to be the darkest of seasons season 5 definatly had it's much darker moments as well ""The Body"" and ""Forever"" being the obvious choices but also ""Weight of the World"" and ""The Gift"".  I was sad to see Buffy go after seven years (it didn't seem long enough) but I trust Joss and believe that in the end it was the right choice.  Now for my one complaint about this dvd set (and every other buffy dvd set) NOT ENOUGH EXTRAS!!!!!  I couldn't believe that there wasn't a commentary for ""The Gift"" I had to check three times just to believe it, while the extras that were there were good more would have been better.  I would have loved to see a few more commentaries, the previously on buffy thing before the gift, more outakes, commentaries by the cast, and more featurettes and maybe some behind-the-scenes stuff...I don't know if Joss&co. read what people say about the dvd's but I'm hoping so cause maybe than the dvds for seasons 6 and 7 will have the extras that a wonderful show like Buffy truly deserves. :)",1072396800,3,1318,4.475
1909077,4,B0000AQS18,"Many fine reviews already present here, and it would be redundant to recap. In a nutshell, great season, terrific seeing it again.
One small complaint: the box sets for most TV shows come with a nice little booklet, listing the episodes AND telling what extras are going to be given for each. As in, Episode 2, ""Real Me"", Commentary. This set doesn't do that -- just ep info and summary. Complaining about the booklet is pretty picky, I know, but it's a simple thing I wish they'd have spent an extra few minutes and a $ or two on.",1072396800,,531,4.373737373737374
1909078,4,B0000AQS18,"Season 5 had a lot of potential. The series received a fresh start of a sort in season 4 with the move to college. The potential issues raised in the season would've made an interesting season.
But somehow, the potential wasn't fulfilled. Don't get me wrong - a not that great Buffy is a lot greater than most of the other stuff out there. But the production team's heart didn't seem to be in the show any longer.
Take the source of the Slayers' powers for instance. We got some very nice teasers for it in Season 4's 'Restless'. The thing is that I felt that teasers were the only thing I got throughout the season - and no solid buildup to the conclusion of it (which was that Buffy's powers come from her love & loyalty to her friends and family).
The same goes to the Riley / Buffy relationship. We get of a few rounds of ""Riley feeling bad about his role is Buffy's life / Buffy comforts Riley / Riley isn't comforted for long and is willingly bitten by vampires), and then Boom! Riley throws an ultimatum and about 30 minutes later - he's gone.
As for character development - it was patchy. Buffy had a lot of room for development with Dawn's arrival and Joyce's death, and Sarah Michelle Gellar has used that space well. Dawn's part seems to be a little too childish, but considering the fact that the part was originally meant to be a 12 years old (not 14), Michele Trachtenberg did a great job. We got to know Tara a little better, too. On the other hand, Xander, Willow and Anya didn't seem to grow much during the season. Xander finaly found a steady job & a new apartment at the beginning of the season, and there he stopped developing. We got a few hints that Willow is better & more involved in magic (a clue to future theme), and that's it. Anya seemed to be a combination punch bag for Willow and season 4's joke with a few added sensitivities.
And an important note to Joss Whedon & the other writers: if Buffy keeps dying then brought back to life to often, 'death' ceases to be such a major, all important thing.
I think part of the problem is that even though 'Buffy' and 'Angel' are 2 seperate shows, they share a lot of myth & characters. While rumor says that the frequent visits of 'Buffy' characters to 'Angel' helped the latter (esp. in its first season), the shared characters and expositions are certainly hurting Buffy. As someone who hasn't watched 'Angel', I certainly found large gaps in Buffy seasons 4 & 5 (things are so bad that it was extremely obvious that it's impossible to fully understand 'Buffy' without watching 'Angel').
Besides this small touch of what seems like vanity on the production teams' side, the extra features were w-a-y below the standards of previous seasons. I think that this is the first time there is no commentary on the season finale. And even if we consider the fact that it's hard to find something original to do in the fifth DVD set.
On the other hand, there is also a lot of good in this seasons. Joyce's ilness & death were very well executed, and well as Dawn's addition to the show.",1072224000,2,3054,4.426287744227354
1909079,4,B0000AQS18,"After the Scooby Gang nearly imploded in Season 4, a concerted effort to focus on family in Season 5. To that end, there's a major emphasis on Buffy's Mom and Dawn, Buffy's sister (who is in fact The Key, a mystical ball of energy, in human form). However, even with this emphasis on the cast, character development would suffer in places. In particular is Tara, who despite Amber Benson's excellent performances, isn't given much to do except be Willow's girlfriend (a matter specifically broached in ""Family"", and then left largely ignored until ""Tough Love"", an episode that results in Tara being rendered insane until the last episode of the season). As such, the people who were unhappy with the Willow/Tara relationship (and even a few, like myself, who fully accepted the pairing) were presented with a 'ship that at times seemed to be there to cash in on the underlying social implications of two women together on television.
Also annoying to some were Spike (who quickly began to take over the show in the eyes of some as soon as his Buffy obsession became known) and Dawn (who's a spazzy 14 year old, so no surprise there). However, the biggest problem seems to lie with Glory. While certainly a formidable villain, Glory is simply not as compelling as some of the previous Big Bads (but a definite step up from ADAM and the Initiative).
Despite these qualms, Season 5 was blessed with some truly excellent episodes and moments. Besides ""The Body"" and ""The Gift"" (both major triumphs for the cast and Joss Whedon) are ""Buffy vs. Dracula"", ""The Replacement"", ""Fool For Love"", ""Triangle"", and ""I Was Made to Love You"". Unfortunately present is ""Listening to Fear"", which easily the worst Buffy episode since Season 2's ""Go Fish"" (an episode that was blessed with some classic moments, unlike the latter episode).
The DVD set is very similar to previous sets, with a smattering of commentaries (although one is sorely missing for ""The Gift"") and scripts. The documentaries are also standard here, except for ""Demonology: A Slayer's Guide"", which is hosted by Danny Strong and is definitely tongue-in-cheek. There are, however, two things sorely missing in the set. First is a featurette on the brewing issues between Mutant Enemy and The WB which would lead to the network switch (and was a major driving factor in how Season 5 ended). Second is the ""Previously on..."" segement for ""The Gift"", which set up that episode perfectly, and featured images from each of the preceding 99 episodes of the series. Given that TV shows ranging from Dawson's Creek to The Transformers have been released on DVD with recaps and even syndicated commercial bumpers intact, this extremely important omission is quite disturbing. Otherwise, this set is well worth the money.",1072051200,5,2765,4.948387096774193
1909080,4,B0000AQS18,"I would say, in my opinion, this season ranks up there with seasons 2 and 3. The Arrival of Dawn, The Magic Box, The Death of Joyce, The Breakup of Riley and Buffy, and Tara's Family mark some of the key moments that made this season momentous on all levels. NOT to mention the ""key"" most important and heartbreaking moment in all Buffy history. Her death. From the ""Previously on Buffy..."" to ""She saved the world alot,"" ""The Gift"" was a spectacular episode.
On the DVD, which I would say was pretty good, The Gift was not shown in it's full entirety. I wonder. WHERE WAS THE DAMN AWESOME PREVIOUSLY ON BUFFY!?!?!?!
I don't know why but they decided to leave that out cause that was an awesome way to begin what many of us thought was the final ep.
Anyway, I give this DVD ****. Not 5 because of that key not putting in the Previously on Buffy. Watch everything on this DVD including Commentaries, featurettes, outtakes(which are actually on there! :> ), and my fave ep, The Replacement with Nicholas Brendan's twin!!! Other awesome eps: The Body ( I cried), I Was Made For You (With slimey Warren), and Buffy vs. Dracula ( hilarious!!!!)",1071878400,,1139,4.533980582524272
1909081,5,B0000AQS18,"Season 5 of Buffy will probably always stand out when compared to the other seasons.  Sure by season 4 Joss and co. had the ""season-story-arc"" thing down pat, but never has it been more tightly structured (and never will it be again) than the saga of ""Glory and the Key."" You just need to compare its storyline with that of season 1, which can pretty much be summed up in three episodes ""Welcome to the Hellmouth/The Harvest"", ""Never Kill a Boy-First Date"", and ""Prophecy Girl"" to see the stark contrast.  Even seasons 2 and 3 (which seemed to be hailed as the best season -take your pick- more than the others) really didn't gear into their ""season arc"" until halfway through the season (Angel turning evil; the Mayor preparing for the Ascension, respectively). Season 4 is really the first time they had a true ""season arc"" that encompassed the ENTIRE season.  While I'll be the first to admit that Joss and co. could have done a lot better than ""The Initiative"" storyline, it was well structured, despite the terrible underuse of their ""big bad"", Adam, whom, after his big introduction was allowed to flounder until it was time for his death scene at the end.  Even Angelus and The Mayor had a few pre-game eps to cause mischief before their finales and they too only had the second half of their seasons to do it.  Season 5 is not only more well structured, but the ""Glory/Key"" storyline was more often better intergrated (it helps that the Key was Buffy sister) with those episodes that weren't focused on moving the ""season-arc"" along, when compared to those ""Adam cameos"" of the previous season. Sort of like how ""Goldfinger"" set the standard for all the Bond films (to this day), and ""Thunderball"" (the very next film) was more polished and a better movie (IMHO).  Seasons 6 and 7 I'll leave alone for now since their DVD sets haven't come out yet.
But what I think seperates this season more than the others is the fact that this season actually has the fewest ""bad"" episodes than any of the others.  Even the much lauded about seasons 2 and 3 had their ""Go Fish, Bad Eggs"" and ""The Zeppo,"" ""Choices"", ""Dead Man's Party (though the zombies are the only bad thing about this otherwise excellent ep)"".  Sure season five had a couple of eps that weren't really nothing to burn on your DVD recorder; ""Intervention"" comes to mind, if only for the really lame fight scene at the end. But what surprised me were the episodes I thought would be bad (based on their previews) which actually turned out to be really good; ""The Replacement"", ""Listening to Fear"", ""Triangle"", and ""I was Made to Love You"", while others I thought would be good, didn't turn out as well ""Out of My Mind,"" ""Shadow"" and ""Spiral"", but even these episodes weren't as bad as ""Where the Wild Things Are"", ""Doublemeat Palace"", nor ""Him"".  And I'm still convinced that the last four episodes (which roughly takes place in the span of 24 hours) would have benefited better by compressing ""Tough Love,"" ""Spiral,"" and ""The Weight of the World"" into two episodes (the whole catatonic Buffy thing just screamed ""filler""), leaving ""The Gift"" exactly as it is.
So I won't say that Season 5 is the best season (though the arguement is certainly there), I can find plenty of good and great things in all the seasons (yes, even season 4 to all you naysayers out there!), it is definitely worth twice the asking price for this DVD set.",1071792000,,3394,4.633943427620633
1909082,5,B0000AQS18,"Actually, I have two complaints with the new boxed set.
First, they don't have commentaries on some of the key episodes.  For instance, no one comments on ""The Gift,"" which is a spectacular episode.
Second, I am really upset that they dropped all of the ""Previously on Buffy . . . "" intros.  Normally this isn't that big of a deal, but one ""The Gift"" it is horrible, because that was the spectacular intro that had a brief shot of every single episode to mark its being both the last episode of the season and the 100th episode overall (as well as the last episode on the WB).
Apart from that, the set is just tremendous.  I'm one of those who thinks that this is the best season of Buffy overall.  Season Two had great highpoints but some weak episodes, and Season Three was consistently good but lacked the highs of Two and Five.",1071705600,4,831,4.376623376623376
1909083,4,B0000AQS18,"I can't really say anything bad about the season. I enjoyed all of the episodes except two. I did, however, think this set should have had more and better extras. First of all, i have all the seasons and none have the main 4 characters in commentary or interviews. I'm referring to Buffy, Giles, Willow, and Xander. This is probably on purpose. I think they're waiting for the final season. I think that's a gimmick, though, and those primary people should be doing interviews or commentary on each set.
Dawn (Michelle Trachtenburg?) gets some time on this set as far as interviewing. She's very personable and seems into her character. I enjoyed her and James Marsters in the extras. The bloopers are really short. Is this because the cast is mostly on target? Perhaps they don't make many mistakes. I suspect they left quite a few out though. Still, it's better than nothing.
What they basically need is more coverage of the relationship between the major stars. Otherwise, true Buffy fans like me feel we're missing something.",1071705600,3,1029,4.8192090395480225
1909084,5,B0000AQS18,"I got hooked on Buffy late, after the series ended.  Its very nice, however, to have most of the series on DVD.  This was a real 'learn & grow' season for the show (I've not seen the last 2 seasons completely).  The writing continues to be fantastic!  I've read reviews from other fans who did not like the opener, Buffy vs. Dracula, but I enjoyed the episode (never having seen Gellar and the actor playing Dracula in AMC probably helped).  The last half of this season is done powerfully.  I am grateful to Joss Wheadon for exploring this very difficult topic of the death of a family member.  He did this with such grace and so close to the bone that it takes your breath away (if you've been through times like these, anyway).  It really brings the series and the characters to a new level of development, the idea of strengths and weaknesses sometimes being one & the same, and the ties of *family*.  Can't wait for the next season's release!",1071446400,,947,4.459302325581396
1909085,5,B0000AQS18,"After an uncertain 4th season about the uncertainty of freshmen year in college, Buffy returned to form with a story arc rooted in what makes and breaks a ""family"".  The battle against Glory was spectacular and well done, but it's the issues Buffy has to face that makes the season so poignant -- a new sister, the passing of a close family member, and how the entire gang relates good and bad with her.  And underneath it all the final struggle Buffy has to face to MEAN what it is to be THE SLAYER.  It is as powerful as any of the 7 seasons could be! And all of this delivered at a fast and dizzying pace trademark to the show!  Season 5 feels like the climax to the entire show, and you could almost stop here and feel completely satisfied with the way they tied the entire series up.
The DVDs are fullscreen format and chock full of extras.  Featurettes include a season overview with the creators talking about their vision of season 5, a look at stunts, an in-depth look at Dawn including an interview with Michelle, and an assortment of outtakes/bloopers (which are from all 5 seasons!).  The commentaries are about 1 per disc on various episodes with the most striking being Joss's take on THE BODY.  The only truly important omission would be the ""previously on ..."" segment from the season finale which is also the 100th episode titled THE GIFT.
Highlights are many this year including one of the best villans in the series - the banished god Glory!  She has almost a Cordelia vibe to her, but rarely has there been a more beautiful and wicked villan on BUFFY.  She's vain, glorious, and utterly mad!  I felt like she worked very well pitted up against Buffy and Willow.  The glee in her evil is infectious, and she adds a lot to the success of the season.",1071446400,,1767,4.456521739130435
1909086,5,B0000AQS18,"""The hardest thing in this world is to live in it.""
 - Buffy to Dawn, ""The Gift""
This season had a lot to live up to. Riding the wave of a good first season, a great second season, and two spectacular following seasons, the fifth chapter in the tale of Buffy the Vampire Slayer had a lot of people watching and holding their breath. But once ""Buffy vs. Dracula"" appeared on TV screens, we breathed a sigh of relief. The good things never change.
The fifth (and final on the WB) season of BtVS showcased the full range of the talent that had worked on the show for four years, from cast to crew to the writers and directors. Beginning with what some labeled as a shark jump as Buffy's heretofore unknown little sister Dawn was introduced, the fifth outing proved all TV show cliches wrong when this seemingly desperate plot device was turned into one of the most compelling aspects of the show's entire run.
Who is Dawn? Where has she been these last four years? And why does everyone know who she is? Well, it turns out that she is The Key, a way of opening the portals between all dimensions, and she's in very real danger. A certain nasty hell god named Glory wants her, and she's prepared to do anything to get her. Glory doesn't try to replace any of the show's previous big bad's, as they all have specific feels to them that are tailor-made for the season. With Glory, it's evil, pure and simple. She's mean, she's nuts, and she can knock down a building with a fingernail.
The cast really takes it up a notch on this season, which, considering their past performances, is really something. Giles is torn between his desire to protect the world as a whole, and the pain that losing Dawn would cause to Buffy. Willow watches as Glory drains Terra of her sanity, and then nurses her lover with a touching tenderness that really pulls on the heart strings. Spike realizes that he is in love with Buffy (what? without a soul? HOW?), but still manages to be the same Spike that we all know and love. Xander and Anya play the happy couple, though Anya's specific mannerisms are both cause for laugh and thought, as she really mirror's the ridiculousness of the world that we take for granted. And Buffy. . . she saves the world. A lot.
Sarah Michelle-Gellar really came into her own more than anyone on the show. The role of both a slayer and a protective big sister, recently dealing with the loss of her mother, would have been an incredible strain on any actress, but Gellar pulls it off with flair, heart, and believability. From her fight with Dracula to her heart-wrenching sacrifice, she is every bit the slayer who can. Her performance as Buffy as well as the superb writing and directing throughout the season put Buffy on the map, and assured its place among the greats of television icons.
The extras: they're all that and a bag of chips. Lots of galleries, features, commentaries, and much more make this set a loaded bonus collection as well as one of the best seasons in television history. Those who love Buffy want it, and those who don't love Buffy need it, if nothing else than to change their minds. After all, everyone should love Buffy. She's a hero, you see.",1071360000,,3180,4.501730103806229
1909087,5,B0000AQS18,"I have been a Buffy fan since the beginning. I was in high school when the show first started out so I could relate. So many people have a dislike of season 5 and I don't know why? some people say that it is because of Dawn. This season happens to be the best out of all seven seasons. We have a 'big bad' that Buffy has a hard time defeating. Then finding out her sister isn't really a sister,but some kind of key. The death of her mother of something natural and not mystical and she had no way of fighting it. Leading up to the altimate sacrifice of herself to save her sister and the world. Sort of remenicent when she had to sacrifice Angel. I think this is the season of seasons that everyone should stand up and cheer. This season had alot of outstanding episodes: 'The Body','The Gift', 'Checkpoint'. Just to name a few. This is a must have for all Buffy fans.",1071273600,,868,4.203592814371257
1909088,4,B0000AQS18,"Much as I like the vampire genre, and much as I've liked the few episodes of Buffy that I've seen over the years, Season Five is the first complete season of Buffy The Vampire Slayer I have ever watched. I guess diehard (so to speak) fans of the show either love or hate this season, but me... I liked it.

The season begins with the Buffy vs. Dracula episode, which is pretty tepid for Vlad Tepes (although German actor Rudolph Martin, who later played the same character in TV movie, was pretty convincing as the titular bloodsucker).

Next up is the episode which introduces Michelle Trachtenberg as Buffys heretofore unknown sister, Dawn. Then there is an episode called Fool for Love, which gives us a look at Spike's origin and back-story.  Listening to Fear is about aliens. Into the Woods is an interesting and emotional episode, and I Was Made to Love You, featuring evil robot girlfriend, is just the opposite (but still fun). The Body, and Forever are like mini-movies, they are so good. And the season finale, The Gift, is one of the best on the disc.

1909089,5,B0000AQS18,"I just received my Season 5 DVD set yesterday afternoon, and I couldn't be happier.  I had been waiting patiently for this ever since Amazon announced its release date.
Any TRUE fan of Buffy loves Season 5 and for those that have never seen Buffy at all, I suggest they start from Season 1 and work their way up, however, if they haven't the chance and can only see one season, then Season 5 is it.
For those of you that posted your dislike for Season 5, I can hardly see how you can consider yourself a true Buffy fan.  I see so much hatred for this season from people that claim they are part-time viewers or have just picked up on the show after its seventh season finale, and still claim they are Buffy fans.
No true Buffy fan dislikes season 5, no matter what they claim they are.  I have been watching Buffy since day one, and can't imagine anyone could find one ounce of dislike for this Season.  Even the cheesy first episode with Dracula is a necessary evil.  It is the comic releif I think I needed coming into the season, as well as Dracula himself dropping hints to Buffy about whats to come.  Making her truly focus on the need to expand her mind and find out what being a Slayer is truly about.  Tapping into her mental powers and realizing, due to Dracula, the need to still have Giles in her life.
Also, to those disliking anything AFTER Season 5, I say again, how can you consider yourself a true buffy fan.  A true fan of anything, such as a sports team, loves their team no matter what.  The show is like a person.  It has good times and bad, but I think that is what makes it so well rounded and liked by so many.  It touches on everybodys emotions, and every episode of every season has lovers and haters.
Just keep that in mind, and run out and buy your copy of Season 5 today.  You won't be disappointed.",1071187200,2,1827,4.23342939481268
1909090,5,B0000AQS18,"I am an avid Buffy fan, and Season Five is by far, my favorite season.  No other season has so many episodes that are so memorable.  The 'insertion' of Dawn was done so amazingly well.  Everyone just assumed she was ment to be there, and only the audiance was questioning.  They change your entire outlook on what the definition of 'evil' is and what it is capable of in ""Fool for Love"", the episode which birthed the redemtionista movement.  And they do it again in ""Intervention"", turning and very funny episode into something dramatic and life changing, turning everything on it's head and showing you that yes, 'evil' can be selfless.  If you don't shed a tear during ""The Body"", esp. at Anya's breakdown, then you are a stronger person than most.  This season is also when the redemtion of Spike kicks into high gear, and nearly everything he does foreshadows things to come.  It's a cullmination of huge amounts of foreshadowing, starting all the way back to season three (""Little Miss Muffet counting down to from 730.""  Faith-Graduation Day pt II), continuing in season four (""Oh....That clock is totally wrong.""  Tara-Restless) and ending finally in the Gift, 730 days later.  There is no episode in this season that I didn't like, unlike seasons before and after.  A truely must have.",1071100800,,1294,4.8054298642533935
1909091,5,B0000AQS18,"Season Five was the most arc-heavy and structured season of Buffy.  Having first hinted at Season Five's arc way back in Season Three, the excellent pacing was the polished example of a machine that, by this time, was well-oiled.  The episodes fit so neatly together and created such a complete story that many regard this as the best season of the show.  With this new balance came fewer great stand-alone episodes and more of an appreciation for the overall story.  This wasn't necessarily because the ""great"" episodes were lacking but because the ""weaker"" episodes became stronger.  Part of the reason many fans remember an episode like Superstar from Season Four so well, beside the fact that it was a great episode, was because of its peculiar placement as a stand-alone that didn't fit at the end of the season, where the arc should have been picking up speed instead of dropping off.  Season Five doesn't have that unevenness.  I find that I remember the least about this season's specific episodes and more about particular events within the episodes.  I tend to remember Joyce dying more than remembering that Joyce died in Episode 16 which orginally aired yada yada yada.  As always, the cast gives great performances all around.  Sarah Michelle Gellar in particular, Season Five after all being the season where Buffy seeks to learn more about the Slayer's history, is absolutely spectacular.  Gellar just completely embodies the role of Buffy, and her work in this season stands as one of the great TV performances.  By this time, viewers are gleefully aware that an episode can be centered around any member of the cast, and that member will respond with skill and passion for the material.  Alyson Hannigan is as utterly heartbreaking in ""Tough Love"" as Marc Blucas is desperate in ""Into The Woods.""  And who doesn't remember Nicholas Brendon's work vividly in that same episode?  Emma Caulfield is fantastic in ""Triangle"" and James Marsters electrifying in ""Fool for Love.""  Michelle Tratchenberg makes Dawn as sweet, annoying, and confused as I imagine a 14 year old would be even if she wasn't actually a big green ball of energy.  She does a great job holding her own.  And Amber Benson is so fragile and beautiful as Tara, a character that, like the Scooby Gang was early on in the season, none of us really knew that much about.  Anthony Stewart Head also gives a measured and nuanced performance throughout the season.  It's something you might not notice right away, but the acting in his eyes alone makes this season worth watching.  He is really not given much to work with, but makes us understand why no other actor could have brought so much depth and complexity to such a difficult and potentially shallow role.  The DVD itself is the most well packaged and put together of any of the releases so far.  Onto Season Six.",1071100800,6,2847,4.824742268041237
1909092,4,B0000AQS18,"I have been watching Buffy and reading the books since it 1st started airing and This season would have been really good if they wouldn't have brought Dawn onto the show she totally ruint Buffy and I hated when they killed her mom that was the saddest episode ever. I think if they HAD to leave Dawn in the show then they should have at least given everyone back their real memories. The way Dawn whined ALL the time I just wanted to smack her and tell her to shut up. She completely RUINED Buffy's life for 1 thing if it weren't for her then Riley never would have left and if it weren't for her then Buffy wouldn't have quit college, she wouldn't have had to DIE. Plus when they brought Dawn into the show almost every episode was about her. I recommend this dvd set to everyone because even though it is not the best season of Buffy it's still good. a great thing about the Buffy dvd set is that they are in full screen format instead of widescreen format ( what's the sense of just using the middle of your tv screen?!) Also please do not write reviews saying if I were a ""true"" fan of Buffy I would love this season anyway, as much money as I have spent on Buffy things, and as sick as the ppl are in my life of hearing me talk about Buffy I AM a true buffy fan.",1071100800,,1267,4.092369477911647
1909093,4,B0000AQS18,"I am one of the freaks out there who never watched ""Buffy"" on TV and have only seen it on DVD.  I just finished Season 5 a few hours ago and I have incredibly mixed feelings.  The first third of the Season is hard to swallow, with many limp episodes in my opinion.  Not until Riley leaves does the Season really get going.  Some of my absolute favorites are ""Checkpoint"", ""Crush"" and ""Intervention"" was dazzlingly clever as well.  Dawn wasn't the gloom and doom to this series that everyone said, either.  In fact, I thought Michelle Trachtenberg was awesome, particularly when she finds out the truth about herself.  I had heard rumors online about the episode, ""The Body"" and how incredible it was, but nothing could have prepared me for how profoundly it affected me.  It is absolutely chilling and if anyone said this ensemble cast couldn't act they seriously need to watch this episode.  Emma Caulfield's breakdown in this episode is pure genius. In my opinion, the silence in this episode is more profound than the silence in Season 4's stunner, ""Hush"".  My only big complaint about the latter part of this season (and I admit I am prejudiced here because I am in LOVE with Angel) was his very, very brief appearance in ""Forever"".  I mean, we know these two can't really get physical, but couldn't Mr. Tall, Dark and Broody at least CUDDLE with her for a couple of days?  Her MOM just died for pete's sake!!  I'm also disappointed that the legendary ""Previously on..."" is missing from ""The Gift"".  And what a way to end the season.  SHEESH!  I was so emotionally drained by the end of all of this, I had to take a nap.  And, from what I hear, Season SIX is ""The Dark Season""!!??  I loved seeing Willow come out of her shell and take charge toward the end of this season, too.  More of that coming soon, I hear.  Too bad, according to Amazon, it's going to be more than SEVEN MONTHS before Season 6 is available.  Kill me now.",1071014400,2,1931,4.491379310344827
1909094,5,B0000AQS18,"Season Five is, in my opinion, one of the best seasons of Buffy.  From meeting Dracula (to which Buffy's reaction was great) to Dawn's appearance, Spike's infatuation with Buffy (hello, was going to stake Drusella for her), and the battle with Glory, Season Five had some of the best episodes and overall arch ever.  Glory is the perfect villion.  Self-serving, unapologetic, and determined to find ""her key.""
The character of Dawn was a little trying on the nerves this season.  She tended towards utter selfishness and bratty behavior, that made for some wincing while I was watching the series.  After a while, you just want to smack the kid and tell her to shut up.
My favorite part of this season was Spike.  When he discovers his love for Buffy, it changed him in a good, making the show even better way.  His reaction to Buffy's ""gift"" was a prime example of how deep his feelings for Buffy were.
""The Body"" is the best episode of the season.  Buffy's reaction to Joyce's natural death was astounding.  I cannot believe Sarah Michelle did not get an emmy for her protrayal.  Are you telling me that daytime drama was the only place that saw the talent this woman has.  Amazing acting, writing, and direction.  (Note:  There is absolutely no background noise throughout the whole episode.)
Overall, Season Five of Buffy rates up there with Season Two.  Seeing this series on DVD makes you realize how much television misses this show.",1071014400,,1440,4.754032258064516

1909096,5,B0000AQS18,"The scene in which Buffy walks into her bedroom to find a strange young girl (Dawn) inside and what transpired within the next few seconds as that episode ended, brilliantly began a season of one of the most entertaining television/DVD's I've ever seen. The main storyline, complete with all of it's twists and turns, shocking scenes and developements and utterly unexpected fate of many of the shows main charcters, is unforgettable. There are more priceless moments in that one season alone than one could find in the entire running of most highly rated shows. Clare Kramer as Glory was an absolute riot. She owned that role. The casting for Buffy The Vampire Slayer has always been exmplorary. Even so, it had to be difficult to find an actress to successfully combine and simultaneously display all of the characteristics of Glory. An extremely powerful, vicious, evil, megalomaniacal, narccissistic, utterly insane, wickedly intelligent/dumb blonde. Not only did Kramer pull it off, she did it so brilliantly that every single scene with Glory was a treat. Glory became one of the most popular villains in the show. But as usual with a role like that some people were unable to grasp the complexity of the role, among them, one Mark Englhart, a critic for Amazon.com""s DVD's (please, find someone else). Clare Kramer's performance apparently went right over his head as did the season itself. How he made such a bad call is anyones guess...maybe he tried to get a date with Ms. Kramer and she turned him down. Maybe he had the flu when he saw the DVD and just wasn't feeling well, who knows. The only sure thing is that the fans have spoken. They loved her and we're the people who the show was created for in the first place.",1070928000,2,1731,4.792642140468227

1909098,4,B0000AQS18,"Buffy season 5 was a nice return to the bad supernatural element (for those of us left feeling really empty after the lameness that was season 4) but also left a lot of feelings in the Buffy-verse just floating around.
This was Buffy's last season on the WB, which is part of the reason why this season is one of the more melodramatic of the 7.  Nearly every episode had some tumultuously important emotional thing happen to Buffy (be it her new ""sister"" Dawn, the death of her mother, or at the end, Buffy's own ""death"" (yes, she dies again)) but really all that seems to happen with this season is the introduction of Dawn, and the removal of Joyce Summers from the equation that is Buffy's life.
Glory makes a kick-ass villain, Spike once again saves the entire show (anyone else notice how boring Angel would be this year without Spike?), and Buffy sort of mopes throughout her life in a non-sensical manner trying to do what's right in her own eyes.  It's a very transitional season in which the characters  mature more than probably any other season and seem as though they are ready for anything, including the end of the series.  Which is why I was sort of disappointed with the outcome of Season 5.  The show was prepared for its own demise, and when that didn't happen because UPN picked it up, it seemed like they weren't really sure what to do with it.
All in all, Season 5 has some great fights, some great maturing, and some great moments.  I'd say behind season's 2, 3, and 7, this was Buffy's best season (making it 4th place out of the 7).  If you're a Buffy fan this review was pointless to you because you're going to buy the DVD anyway based on what you feel about the show.  If you're a  new Buffy fan, start from the beginning or else season 5 is just going to be a big confusing mess.  Whatever you do, add this DVD to your collection, because the changes brought by Season 5 are needed by all serious Buffy fans.",1070928000,2,1936,4.38268156424581
1909099,5,B0000AQS18,"I always think of the second season as being the best year of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" mainly because the grand two-part finale of ""Becoming"" was the operatic high point of the series.  How could Joss Whedon ever top the moment when Buffy kissed Angel, told him that she loved him, and then killed him?  The short answer is that it could not be done, but no one can accuse Joss of not trying.  Besides, one thing we have consistently seen each season since the second is that if the top is not as high, the bottom and average scores are on the rise.

Having dealt with the Master, Angelus and Acaltha, Faith Mayor Wilkins, and Adams and the Intiative, the ante gets upped beyond vampires and demons to the level of a god for the season's final battle.  After the abbreviated first season Whedon always comes up with a first half story arc that combines with the second half story arc for the big finish, but this year Glory shows up in episode five.  However, Joss remains true to the formula because the Fifth Season comes down to Dawn and Glory, and even with the appearance of a deranged deity from another dimension, it is the sudden appearance of Buffy's kid sister that defines the season.

Dawn pops up at the end of the season premier episode, ""Dracula,"" the first really comic opening for a Buffy season, and we do not find out about the ""Key"" until the fifth episode, ""No Place Like Home.""  But then we do not find out that Glory is a god until Quentin Travers drops that little bombshell at the end of ""Checkpoint.""  If anything, I would have liked Joss to have played out the mystery a bit longer, but it was fun to have Buffy and everyone just accept Dawn and the idea that she had always been there.  Plus, throwing a bratty kid sister into the Buffy mix is a nice way of shaking things up.  Then again, Joss had a way of topping that with regards to Joyce Summers.

There are a few choice examples of significant character evolutions in the history of television programming, and with ""BtVS"" we can add Spike's name to the honor role that includes Margaret Houlihan and Charles Emerson Winchester from ""M*A*S*H,"" and Lou Grant going from a supporting character on a classic sitcom to the lead of a dramatic program.  The chip the Initiative put in Spike's head in Season Four was only the start of the fun, because now Spike has been having dreams about the Slayer.  William the Bloody with a crush in his head.  The end result is that in ""The Gift"" so many of the memorable moments involve Spike: Willow tells him to go and he goes, the look on his face when he realizes he has failed Dawn, and the fact that he is the one who totally breaks down sobbing at the end.  Throw into the mix Spike's refusal to tell Glory about the Key and his reward from Buffy.

The Fifth Season is not without its flaws.  Glory is given a convenient Achilles heel regarding Ben and manages to avoid a sustained all-out assault until the final trio of episodes.  In terms of character transformations we also have Xander renouncing his role as the show's ""butt monkey"" and Anya becoming the show's comic relief.  I appreciate the desire to do the former but the latter gets played out way too often over the rest of the series.  Compare the Anya that was turned human in Season Three with what we have at this point; did she really learn nothing during 4,000 years as a vengeance demon?  After all, she was human once, and in a bad marriage: did she forget all that?  I reached my Anya saturation point during this season, where I started wincing a lot at her comments (but Whedon does use this for a great moment in ""The Body"").

Of course, if we are talking changes in characters then we have to applaud the Willow that takes over at the low point of the season when Buffy retreats into her self in ""The Weight of the World.""  In retrospect it is rather astounding to look at how many changes the gang goes through in the Fifth Season.  From where they started, seldom have characters come this far; and there are still two seasons to go.

In terms of DVD extras all you need to know is that Joss Whedon does audio commentary for ""The Body.""  You already know he should have had an Emmy nomination for writing that one, but he should have been nominated for director too: pay attention to the way he uses the camera to capture Buffy's disorientation and provide one of the best portrayals of grief in television history.",1070928000,7,4421,4.438118811881188
1909100,5,B0000AQS18,"Admitedly I've only seen scattered episodes of it and not entirely in sequence but in my oppinion this was the best Buffy season of the four on WB(unable to judge 6 and 7 since I've seen only two or three episodes out of both of them).
  The only part I disliked was the first episode.  I have long been a fan of the vampire Dracula and was really looking forward to his appearance.  With the way they played it up I expected a very interesting episode playing off his nature and her own.  Instead I got a good moment or two completely sorrounded by hokey garbage(although I'll grant you the last scene with the multiple stakings made me laugh).

  The part that made this series really shine though is Glory.  Of all Buffy's foes she is perhaps the most disturbing.  Why?  Because unlike any of the others Glory's truly insane and just doesn't care.  Angelus was extremely evil and depraved but his methods were well thought out.  He behaves with specific goals.  Glory is plain deranged.  She is eiher unaware her plan will utterly destroy the dimensional barriers are far more likely she simply doesn't care.  Yet despite this she has a humorous almost flippant side.  Its dark comedy in a sense only one other season big bad has really had(The Mayor).",1070841600,4,1255,4.581081081081081
1909101,4,B0000AQS18,"Ive watched the show from the beginning and I can honestly say that this was the last full season that was decent. Sure we had the musical in Season 6 and a few other memorable character moments along the way to the end but this was the most consistant writing before it started to fall apart while Joss was away doing Firefly.
Season 5 had a villian on a grander scale and some very serious turns. This show has grown quite  a bit over it's five seasons and so have the characters.
Many argue that they should have concluded this  show at the end of the season and I tend to think so myself.

1909102,4,B0000AQS18,"As it is one of my favorite shows, I was disappointed with the increasing depression in the episodes as the fifth season came about. Though frustrating, there are some episodes that are very emotion provoking. Particularly the scooby gang's various reactions to Joyce's death. As someone who lost their mom as a teenager, those episodes are very comforting in that viewers see how irrational, numb or open it is okay to be during hard times. As a side note, I will be sure to buy every single season of Buffy and if you are a true Buffy fan, then it will be worth the money.",1070496000,,574,4.476190476190476
1909103,4,B0000AQS18,"Although it doesn't quite match the greatness of Season 2 (and 3) in terms of arcs and storytelling, in my opinion, Season 5 of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" was the ""last stand"" of greatness before the downward spiral of Seasons 6 and 7. There were some glorious moments, such as the awesome and humbling magic of the episode ""The Gift"" in which Buffy sacrifices her life to save the world and her beloved sister. The season includes one the best-ever treatments of coping with the death of a loved one, in ""The Body"" and the challenges Buffy faces while picking up the pieces after her mother's death, caring for a child and trying to keep at bay the supernatural forces that stand against her. The season saw the continued development of Spike from foe to ally while exploring his obsessional infatuation with the Slayer.
I ended up liking the addition of ""Dawn"" although I wasn't sure I would in the beginning of the season, and Glory may not have been the most interesting/evil/fun Big Bad in BtVS history, but she was entertaining. It included a cross-over by my favorite vampire with a soul, Angel (David Boreanaz) in ""Forever"" and reaffirmed the depth of feeling between Buffy and Angel despite the tragedy of their situation.  Overall the season had some truly wonderful performances by the cast. This is definitely worth owning if you're a BUFFY fan. I can't wait to receive my DVD's!!",1070496000,,1392,4.75206611570248
1909104,3,B0000AQS18,"I have been watching this show since it came out. Unlike many of my counterparts I was glad to see Angel move on and out of the series. So maybe that is why I don't have any real loyalty to any of the seasons (even more so because I didn't watch them in order). I like the introduction of Dawn (personally up till this point I thought the show was going down hill) and I appreciate that they didn't kill her off. In truth, if that had been the end of the series I would've been much happier than with the one I got. The greeks believed that you truly cannot be a hero unless you sacrifice yourself for another person. So in a way, I feel that Buffy, if it ended that way, would've been a real hero.
My review of this seasons is: Spotty, season five had some of the best episodes of the series. But on the other hand it had some of the worst. I am going to buy it because the good episode are that good.",1070409600,,902,3.9889502762430937
1909105,4,B0000AQS18,"The Fifth season of Buffy was the beginning of the end of the show.  It was not all bad but it lack the greatness that the previous seasons had.  The creators went each season of having to outdue the previous season's evil character.  So in this season, the evilness had to be a god i.e. Glory.  The show lost some of its magic along the way as well.  With the departure of two main characters from two seasons ago, the show was never able to replace them fully.  Though Spike turned out to be a great character, his stay on Buffy was rather wormy during this season.  He became a stalker type, a puppy dog figure that he never truely gets over until his turn on Angel.  The show's weakness is really shown by the introduction of Buffy's sister, Dawn.  Taking a note from comic book, the creative team decided to distrub the history that they created from the first 4 Seasons and totally crush it.  Dawn's character is too young for some of the themes that ran through Buffy prior to this season.  If she was alittle older and less whinny, then I think it would have been a better idea.  Another problem was the relationship with Riley.  No one liked Riley and by mid season the creative team finally listened to its fans by having him leave.  The relationship of Anya-Zander and Willow-Tara were all done well without dominating the show like prior relationships of past.  I leave that up for the viewer to decide.  Meanwhile, Giles was being wasted as an actor and a character with his taking over the Magic Box.  It seemed at first that he was going to be more of a Watcher at the beginning but the creators cut that role by the middle of the season.  Though the death of Buffy's mother did create one of the best shows produced by Buffy, this lead to a trend of eliminating all adult influnces in Buffy's life with Giles leaving the following year.  At this point the show takes an unrealistic trend of forcing Buffy into an adult role but total eliminating some of the adult themes like paying a mortgage (also the total neglect of trying to explain why Buffy's father did not take Dawn is beyond realistic).  The show ends with a great final but again the creators book a key from comic book lore and killed off not just a main character but the title character.  Also, again the creative team does not show any adult growth in Buffy but not having her kill a human, meanwhile leaving that job for Giles.  In the end, the show had some great moments and some very low moments but the show overall was above average but the themes that were created in this season leds to the problems in the last few seasons.",1070409600,,2614,4.402083333333334

I think there are great moments from the first four seasons,but I feel season 5 takes the cake. Season five started to show Buffy for who she really was. It began to show the true nature of Buffy being the slayer. I think in the first four seasons to Buffy being the slayer was just a job. In season five the writers made it so she realized it was much more than that. This season had more range of emotion than any other season before it. She has to deal with a new sister,Riley leaving her,her mother dying,Spike falling in love with her,the evil doings of Glory,and putting her life on the line for Dawn(the most heart-breaking moment of the season).To me this season is what Buffy was all about.

1909107,5,B0000AQS18,"After watching the whole series again on FX, I have decided that season five is far and away my favorite season of television, of any show, ever.  It contains some of the show's best episodes (Fool For Love, The Body, The Gift) and it also pulls together as a thematic whole, in ways only cult TV can, further exploring the moral ambiguities that made Buffy so innovative.

The disks are also great.  Unlike the Angel disks, they actually put some thought into who should be on the cover, and Joss' commentary on the Body is worth a listen.

There is a major mistake in this release, though.  One of the most poignant moments of this season on TV was the beginning of The Gift.  Giles' voice says, ""Previously, on Buffy the Vampire Slayer..."" as usual, and then the viewer is treated to a splashy montage of the main plot points of entire series.  It was a beautiful way of telling the viewer, This Episode Changes Everything, and the choice of shots summarized so well the feel of the entire show.

Now that I've made you want to see this montage ... too bad, you can't!  Its not at the beginning of the episode.  Fox cut the previews from all the episodes, which is usually fine, but for this one, they really should have made an exception.

I felt that the depth of Buffy improved with each year, so I disagree that the first 3 years were better than the later ones.  I suppose that Angel's departure could have something to do with that opinion (that the early years were better) hehe.  I found the earlier years to be lacking in truly engaging or witty dialogue.  Now as for year 5, I loved the writing and the maturation process that Buffy went through, except for the surprise introduction of the sister.  Not to mention Buffy's attempt to solve the question of how to save the planet.  I was a little embarrassed to admit that I wondered if and when Buffy would return since the network dumped Buffy the Vampire Slayer, how stupid was that? lol  This season rocks and is a build up to season 6 which brings Spike more into the spotlight, hehe, he's my fave.",1070064000,2,1029,4.378947368421053

And weather you listen to what James Brunner wrote earlier or not you should be able to see why may reviews are so positive.  From the lame `Buffy vs. Dracula' to the spiritual `The Gift' this inventive and amazing TV program deserves 5 stars.
Now I am not one of those folks who've watched Buffy since Season 1.  In point of fact I used to date a Buffy-fan who could not get me to take the show seriously (to her dismay).  But one day, about a year and a half ago, I was looking for something to background my poster making (the poster's not important, but thanks for asking) and I was sick of all my music.  So `on' went the t.v. and I fell upon one of the many times a day that FX plays episodes of Buffy.  It seemed as likely candidate for background noise, and I was already somewhat familiar with the characters.  But by the end of that hour my poster lay very undone I felt just about as sad and moved by a fictitious program as I can ever remember.  The episode was `The Body' and to this day I cannot believe it took me until Season 6 to start watching Buffy.  But on the plus side I had only to watch FX to catch up on what I had missed.  All seasons no waiting ;)
I'm not here to say that this, or any other, season of is perfect.  I can't say that johngift's review and insight was any truer then nat9761's or the anonymous writer of ""The sharks are in the water...""  But I do know that I have found precious little Mutant Enemy productions that were not simply great TV.  And I'm a TV-Head from way back.  But WOW! Buffy is somethin' else, and to think I used to think that Moonlighting was the best thing to have happened to TV.
Heck I can't say I love all the seasons equally (the 7th had some disappointingly lame moments) but that, I think, is one of the reasons that Buffy is such a good show.  It's very natural in it's evolution.  It moves and changes not just from season to season, or episode to episode, but within a single scene.  And watching the cheese of Dracula can be as much fun as the hardcore emotional wrenching that ""The Body"" gives you.  It's simply one of the Best TV shows ever made.  Don't take my word on it; watch it for yourself.  Laugh, cry, and walk away knowing that there are heroes out there and they are just like the rest of us: Doing our best not to be sucked into the Hellmouth.
And just wait, if u thought the 5th was interesting the 6th might just make u reevaluate the whole shebang.  My favorite of the seasons is different, dark, and beautifully uncomfortable.  With episodes that can only come from likes of Mutant Enemy.",1069804800,13,2675,4.224409448818897

I have been one of those avid Buffy fanatics since season 1, episode 7, and in my opinion, season 5 is the crescendo of the series. Sure, season 2 may match it in terms of scope of the story arch, but season 5 finally has the strong production values the stories deserve.
Season 5 is departure childhood for Buffy. There is no parent, boyfriend, or educational institution to guide her; she is left to set her own moral compass. And even though she is surrounded by friends who love her, her burden is still one that she cannot share. This is the year when Buffy proves why she was ever chosen to be The Chosen One in the first place. In a later episode, Buffy tells Dawn that ""it's about power...who's got it, and who knows how to use it."" In season 5, Glory, and even Willow, may have more power than Buffy, but she has more heart.
I can't even begin to get into individual episodes of season 5, because there is a 1000 word limit to these reviews and I would need at least three times that to do them justice. But let me just say that the writers hit and maintained their stride all season long- the arc is solid, the comedy relieves, and the characters have never been more fully realized.
Without going into too much detail, here are the highlights of season 5, and the reasons why its getting no Emmy awards, although always a crime, was a capital offense this year:
1. The undemonization of Spike and the beginning of his transformation into becoming a good man.
2. Riley's descent into uselessness and fetishism... sometimes, the humans are darker than the monsters.
3. The death, by natural causes, of Buffy's mother, showing Buffy that there are some things even she can't fight.
4. Buffy stands up to those grumpy men of the Watcher's Council, and wins.
5. Glory. Say what you will about the actress portraying her, Glory is the most threatening villain and, in fact, bested Buffy in terms of strength.
6. The way Buffy learns, at the last possible moment, that her true power isn't in her fist, it's in her heart, and makes a sacrifice that trumps everyone.
Whether you are one of those people for whom Tuesday nights were a set appointment for seven years, or one of those people who came into the show late and are only still discovering it, season 5 is the one that proved the show's street cred... and it's the one that we all earned the right to have. So just go cut one of those fringe kids or cousins off your Christmas list this year, and spend the $40 to get this for yourself. Please!!!",1069459200,33,2688,4.44331983805668
1909112,4,B0000AQS18,"This is overall a brilliant season. Not the best. Ultimately in terms of scope and stakes Joss Whedon never quite surpassed Season 2. But this comes close. ...
I know many fans feel that Season 4 begins a downward spiral for the series but in fact it is the kick-off of the series' most mature and often painful storytelling. We don't like being confronted with the pains we must live with, which Season 5 does in Spades. Growing up [is hard] and is painful. Season 5 reflects that brilliantly.
Yes, Dracula, lame .... The only episode in the entire series that I still think [is bad]. After that it all falls together.
The Body, simply one of the single most beautifully written episodes of any television series ever. Period. Criminally ignored by the Emmys.
I know many fans hated Reilly. Again, they fail to see Reilly's place and meaning in Buffy's existence. Reilly isn't supposed to work. He cannot fit into Buffy's life despite the fact that he is a good man and represents what Buffy wishes she were. A normal girl. His leaving is poignant and moving, especially as it is montaged with Xander's ultimate admission of love to Anya.
For me there are three detractions to this season and why it only gets 4 stars has more to do with casting than writing . 1)The actress playing Glory is certainly the worst performer to ever appear in the series. A previous reviewer described it perfectly. There are scenes that are brilliantly written that she simply cannot pull off. You get the sense that the actress really has no idea what she is saying even when her line is simply ""Hello"".
2) Though I like the character of Tara in and of itself, I've never liked Amber Benson's stiff and self conscious portrayal. her line readings unconvincing. Would that her acting were half as good as her singing, which is extraordinary.
3) Dracula. This peice of casting was an in joke as the actor had protrayed Sarah Michelle Gellar's love interest in her days on All My Children. Unfortunately, unlike Gellar, this performer's acting never rises above the worst of daytime, walk through, child pretending in the playground, acting. His work is largely why this episode is, for me, the only actual bad episode in the entire series.
These points aside,  the Scooby Gang's journey into adulthood really begins in this season. Don't miss it and don't shortchange it.",1069372800,8,2352,4.736585365853658
1909113,5,B0000AQS18,"Oh my god! I thought I saw everything during season four but Buffy has really matured in this fifth season. She deals with the arrival of her baby sis Dawn, played with conviction by Michelle Trachtenberg of Harriet the Spy and Inspector Gadget fame, as well as the loss of one of the most beloved characters in the entire series. By that I mean the death of Buffy's mom Joyce Summers, played by Kristine Sutherland. We see the return of Drusilla(Juliet Landau), Harmony(Mercedes McNab), as well as Buffy's eternal lover Angel(David Boreanaz). Then she faces off with Glory, disarms Quentin Travers and the Watcher's Council, and in the end of it all dies from a swan dive into the Hellmouth portal. One of the characters I was glad to see leave the show was Riley Finn played by Marc Blucas. He was an unnecessary addition to Buffy's failed love life and would just take a back seat anyway to Principal Robin Wood, and Spike in seasons 6 and 7. Bottom line season five is the ultimate season in my eyes and was the peak of Buffy's maturity. I can not wait until we see the DVD release so that it can be forever immortalized.",1069286400,2,1125,4.519607843137255
1909114,5,B0000AQS18,"Season 5 is by far my favorite season.  There were so many moments that were utterly amazing in this season, all leading up to what could quite possibly be the most shocking and heart wrenching moment of the whole series- Buffy's death.  Looking back on the show from this perspective, at the end of it all, I completely understand why Joss' original vision was to have the entire show end with Buffy sacrificing herself to save the world.  It would have been heartbreaking, poignant and one of the most daring moves ever made in television.  Season 5 is, in my opinion, THE epitomy of Buffy.  From her search to discover her Slayer power and what it meant (""Death is your gift""), to fighting for the lives of everyone she cared about (her mother, Joyce, and her fight with a brain tumour; protecting Dawn, her brand new, ball-of-energy sister), to dealing with her own life and trials (dropping out of university, Riley leaving her, giving up her life)- this season has it all.
Season 5 can most certainly be summed up best in the puzzling lines from Tara in season 4's finale ""Restless""- 'You think you know. What's to come. What you are. You haven't even begun.'",1068940800,3,1165,4.635922330097087

After season four, with the grossness that was Riley Finn, I was seriously considering abandoning the show.  But season five, despite the existence of Dawn, was a showcase for so many great characters, character developments, and plots.  Anya is very likely my favorite character, and I loved the fleshing out she got this season.  Out of everyone's reactions to Joycie's death, hers was by far and away the most heartbreaking.  The greatest buffy moment ever was, and will always be for me, Spike telling Glory off under torture: ""God of what? Bad home perms?""",1068940800,,640,4.781818181818182

15.  The lameness of Dracula, but he illustrates Buffy bad addiction to vampire thrall.
14. Buffy's time loop in the Weight of the World.
13. The family vacation vibe of Spiral. (Anya's cartoon inspired ways to kill Glory)
12.  Spike choosing Buffy over Drusilla. And how he is rejected by 3 different women in Crush.
11. Anya's made up life story she gives to the Watchers in Checkpoint (also how that lady wrote her thesis about Spike and Giles getting retroactive Watchers pay)
10. Spike's dream in Out of my Mind (also the game of 20 questions)
9. Tara's messed up family in Family
8. Dark Willow goes after Glory in Tough Love.
7. Xander grows up in The Replacement
6. The Buffybot and how Spike shows is loyalty to the Summers Women in Intervention  (also the sex with Spike and the robot and how it isn't ""better than the real thing."")
5. Harmony trying to be ""the big bad"" in the Real Me. (also killing a vampire with a wooden unicorn horn is priceless)
4. When Riley leaves Sunnydale in Into the Woods: Vampire + Prostitution = bad
3. Fool for Love is all about Spike.  I love the paradox of him going to kill Buffy with a shotgun and then he decides to comfort her instead of shooting her.
2. The death of Joyce Summers in the Body and how the gang deals with her death in Forever.
1. Buffy's sacrifice in the Gift",1068768000,3,1571,4.341296928327645
1909118,3,B0000AQS18,"I know that many long time fans of Buffy found that season four started a down-hill run for the show, to which I agree. I also acknowledge that many fans did not enjoy Riley as Buffy's love; however, to that I completely disagree. Riley was the one Buffy should have never let go. I hated some of the turns that Josh did with his character in season five, and was sad to see him go. The worst villan, ever, was Glory. I find it hard to believe that she was voted so popular by fans. The actress was terrible, her lines delivered blandly, without real emotions. She was more of a super model, then a super villan. I wanted to see more developement of Willow and Tara's relationship, instead of the dull witted hum-drum that was Xander and Anya. However, there were some great moments, such the acclaimed episode, The Body. Although I'm not a big fan of Anya, her frustration and sadness in the episode reflected ours as fans. Buffy seemed truly alone in season five, even though she was surrounded by people who loved her. I believe Josh wanted her to be seperate, apart from everyone around her. Her volunerability was best expressed as she waited by Joyce's grave until sunset, and Angel appears and encloses her hand with his. It was truly a touching moment. I enjoyed the end episodes, but I thought that Buffy going to shock-land, and Willow having to retrieve her was a bit much. Even Buffy can only have so much angst.",1068422400,29,1424,4.501930501930502

1909120,1,B0000AQS18,"Having watched the series since the low-budget 1992 movie of the same name, I was horrified by this apparent fusion of 90210/Buffy. My claim is ironic seeing as how Luke Perry stared in the campy big screen version, this season once again all of the camp but none of the humor of that incarnation which at least wanted the viewer to have fun, be entertained, and generally like the product they had watched.

Unfortunately, the TV network was trying to torture us in an experiment. The name is attached--but there is none of the fun, witty writting, and character interaction which had distinguished the series. Did I mention the bratty mysterious sister who is annoying??

There is just so much wrong (morally, structurally etc) in the Buffy cannon that I cannot believe it received the public praise that it did. I will just comment on the highlights of what I found was most objectionable.

Riley's gone, but that is no consolation because we are stuck with Dawn. Realizing many viewers prefered the early season romance with Angel, the writers (now unfortunately headed by Marti Noxin) attempted to pair Buffy with Spike, only to come up with equally insipid oneliners that sound as if my mother's junior high students wrote them in a scriptwriting contest and actually had connections to make their creation hit TV airwaves. Spike has emotional problems with relationships.

James Marsters, not even being British, is obviously a better actor than David Boreanaz, but the recycled storylines and Buffy's incompetently explained transformation from assertive go-getter to passive victim (as well as the process itself) was embarassing and insulting. He's mooning after the slayer and trying to make sure that Dawn does not get hurt. What happened!! This is a character who does much better has a villan. He's not supposed to be the caring substitute father figure.

Dawn herself came on the show merely because Michelle Trachtenbeg had industry connections and really wanted to get on the show to further her hollywood career. She did not care what she damaged--or what fan base she ailenated in this process. The show was going to be 'hers' to destroy.  The plot line of a power-mad goddess named Glory (Claire Kramer channeling Supergirl-era Faye Dunnaway dramatics) is a 'strange paralell. I doubt that she noticed.

Noxon et all...did not understand or did not want to understand that it wasn't the fact Buffy had a souled vampire boyfriend in general it was supposedly how he acted aroud Buffy (multidimensional as opposed to a teenybopper cartoon) which was what really counted. Also the fact that this one had been chipped as opposed to gypsy cursed meant the audience was subjected to an endless stream of sex plots, again inserting an innappropriate amount of soap into the show. Spike did not have to remain chaste and would not feel guilt if he did it with the slayer.

On top of everything, Joyce Summers (Kristine Sutherland) died and we never got an equally realistic resolution to that storyline. Because Buffy never has to deal with home foreclosure, calls from Gallery employees or potential clients wondering what happended to Joyce, the transition WAS handled very shoddily and did not reflect the BTVS I had fallen in love with. Buffy and company also coincidentially never have to deal with anything like the utility company turning off the power despite their apparent lack of funds with mom's sudden death. Fast Food (Doublemeat Palace) does not generally pay living wages for adults to live on.

Likewise, her father Hank Summers never steps in again----although we certainly saw more of him in the earlier seasons when everthing was not a prolonged soap opera. He's unconcerned with the fate of his daughters. They suffered a terrible shock, even if they are adults.

After all of the distress which substandard writing previously caused Joss, I am amazed he was again so trusting with scripts. Okay, he cannot be everywhere at once. But when he's not guarding the really important stuff, people who DON'T share his vision DO take over and trash the series. They did it once, and then did it again.

That a long-time and hardcore Buffy fan such as myself would not touch this series even if somebody gave it to me for free should be a very big warning sign. It was the season when evil forces were about. Please do not waste your money on this purchase, and stick to Buffy how Joss meant it to be portrayed by getting seasons 1-3.",1068249600,16,4459,4.900530503978779
1909121,4,B0000AQS18,"Originally thought to be the final year of the series, season five works well as a transitional piece.  You'll notice throughout, and espicially with the final episode, that Joss wasn't certain whether or not the series would continue for future seasons.
  Above all other years of Buffy, season five marks a turning point in the series; the introduction of new characters, and the fleshing out of those who already exist, is enthralling to watch.  Whether you feel that the series was better left to five seasons, or was more suited being drawn out through season seven, the fifth DVD is a must see for buffy fans, and crucial point to the development of the buffy world.

I hated the character Adam from the prior season and was so happy to get a strong villain in Glory, wrapped up in a mythological tale this season.  People can go on and on complaining about Dawn but I'm sure they are just seeing the annoying things within themselves that they certainly experienced during their early teen years.  I was fascinated when they introduced her to the show and I liked her character this season ( Unfortunately they didn't strengthen her much the following seasons ).  She became an integral part of the mythology this season and definetly wrapped a great deal of emotion in the season ender ""The Gift"", one of the most heartfelt moments in television history.  This episode was pure emotion in which our hero selflessly gives her life to save mankind.  At the time I didn't realize the show was going to UPN and I thought that I had just seen the last episode and was I must shamefully say in a funk for a week until I found out about the network switch.

It turns out she's really something called ""the key"" and she was put in human form by monks for Buffy to protect from an evil god called Glory. Glory wants to use the key to open up a dimension that would bring about the end of the world. Buffy and her friends  all have memories of her sister Dawn as if she was always there. Dawn even thinks she's a real girl and Buffy has to hide it from her that she's not.
  If having to protect Dawn from Glory isn't enough for Buffy, her mom suddenly dies. She has to deal with having to take care of the house and raise Dawn as well. The whole funeral episode for Buffy's mom is moody and depressing and actually makes you feel like you lose someone as well. It's well done and feels real even if it's not something you would expect from Buffy. For a season that starts off funny it winds up being pretty sad.
  Buffy loses a lot this season, her b/f leaves, her mom dies and even she dies. Oh on top of it she finds out Spike has a crush on her so she doesn't exactly like that either. Despite being an overly dramatic season it's also pretty damn strong. A lot happens all in one season and it has it's best villian with Glory.

1909132,5,B0000AQS18,"In all good Sci-Fi/Fantasy television, (or comic book for that matter) there comes a point where the hero meets his or her match; when the hero comes up against their greatest challenge; when fans wonder, if even for a second, if the hero is going to make it out of this one. It is a struggle that forever defines the hero.
For the 6 Million-Dollar Man it was the Sasquatch. For the Captain Picard it was the Borg. For Buffy the Vampire Slayer, this struggle was played out over the course of the 5th season against a seemingly undefeatable adversary know as ""Glory.""
I am not a ""Buffer"" or an avid fan of the show, though I do like it. But if I were to own one season on DVD, it would be the 5th. The writing is cleaver and sharp, popping off the screen. The characters, by 5th season, are well define and ripe for the sort of ultimate challenge that ""Glory"" represents. And the character of ""Dawn"" is the most refreshingly creative creation in Sci-Fi/Fantasy since Londo Mollari. At my age, I didn't think the genre had any more surprises for me and was resigned to turing off the TV and watching my old Prisoner tapes, until I met ""Dawn"".  In comparison to this season, 6th seems dull and self-loathing. And I didn't even watch 7th.
Come to think of it, I haven't watch much TV recently. People keeping telling me Smallville is good, but I don't know. Board with the Star Trek Franchise, lamenting the end of Babylon 5, I am adrift without a show, in a sea of reality date programs. I'm even thinking about canceling my cable.

1909133,5,B0000AQS18,"In my opinion, I feel that this season was probably one of the best seasons out of all seven.  It touches on all the subjects that really matter.
First of all, it deals with a death in the family.  It shows that everyone reacts differently to it, and that no way is wrong.  It answers questions that some people are afraid to ask, or even touch on.
Second of all, it touches on the question that everyone asks at least once in their life.  I know I have.  And that question is, ""Why am I really here?""  It shows that you're not alone in the world, when feeling like that.
Now, about Dawn.  I've been readin that a lot of people don't like her.  Honestly, I feel she brought somethin to the show.  Like one previously said, she brought the sister relationship to the show.  And it wasn't fake.  Believe me, I have an older sister, and we act the exact same way as Buffy and Dawn.  I could personally relate to them.  My sister and I are always bickering, but when it really counts, we'll always be there for one another, no matter what.  That is what real sibling relationships are like, and that is what Joss portrayed.  I gotta give him props for that one.
I loved the fact that Spike started falling in love with Buffy in this season.  I always felt they had that chemistry, and was hoping that they would touch on that in the show, and they finally did.
All in all, I say this and season seven are the best ones.",1065916800,15,1415,4.223880597014926
1909134,1,B0000AQS18,"I'm utterly bewildered by the praises heaped on Season 5 here.  Personally, I find 5 extraordinarily painful to watch, largely because of ""Dawn"".  Words fail to express my vehement HATRED for that character---IMHO, she ruined Buffy.  I don't know if it's possible for a character to be more annoying than that adenoidal adolescent with the shrill screams.  Simply can't imagine anyone as hip as Buffy tolerating such a whiny-ass character, let alone sacrificing her life for her.  Dawn's appearance marks the beginning of the end for Buffy as a quality show, and that hurt.
How could anyone who has seen Seasons 1 through 4 rate Season 5 as ""The Best""?  Blows my mind, it is beyond comprehension.
Yes, 5 had its moments.  ""The Body"" is extraordinary (but I still have to fast-forward through every single scene in which Dawn appears).  The deeper exploration of Buffy and Riley's relationship is well-wrought.  The plot twist of Spike developing feelings for the Slayer is definitely fun--- Spike has always been one of the best things about the show.  But as a whole, Season 5 is stilted and artificial in a way that defies description.  I found the whole ""Glory"" and ""Key"" thing even harder to digest than ""the Initiative"".  And those ridiculous Knights of Byzantium?  One gets the distinct impression that Joss took off and was spending more time on Angel and less on Buffy.  It just got plain BAD.  It's clear that they were running out of ideas, especially when they had to go to the extreme of killing Buffy.
Six and Seven got even worse (with the stunning exception of ""Once More, With Feeling""), but Five was definitely the beginning of the end.  There are still flashes of the witty dialog and good writing that characterized the earlier seasons, but not enough to explain the hosannahs being sung in reviews here.  By the time Sunnydale collapsed into the Hellmouth at the end of Season 7, it was a mercy killing.
Having said all that:  There's no accounting for taste, and if you don't mind Dawn and love anything Buffy, go for Season 5.  The truly discerning Buffy fan will stick with the preceding seasons as the ultimate representations of one of the cleverest and most underappreciated television shows ever produced.",1065657600,22,2232,4.841688654353562
1909135,5,B0000AQS18,"This is definently the best season of Buffy EVER.
There are brand new characters. Dawn enters the show, and Glory is one of the best villains ever, if not the best. This season is full of heart-wrenching emotion. Characters leave and die. The Body, which is a more reallistic episode that centers around the death of a central character, is absolutely amazing. I think the season finale, The Gift, is the best episode of Buffy ever. It represents everything Buffy is. From the funny to the sad. And just because this season is very serious, doesn't mean it's all drama. Checkpoint is one of the funniest episodes ever.
This is a great buy for any Buffy fan and anyone looking for some good quality television.",1065484800,3,709,4.68

To say I would of been happy this was the last season would be true. I felt this was nicely wrapped up and alot of things were well put to rest for a better term.  There is alot of great moments, and the features on this is great.  I've seen the Region 2 version and totally was happy w/the outtakes and well everything else. Though wished they could of done something for the 100th eps.  I mean come one who would of thought that five years ago a show like this would last for SEVEN!!  But it won me over and critics.  This is a great season w/just a ton of action, and well done storylines I felt.  W/an ending to the story that just was wonderful... so pick it up.  Enjoy yet another creative season of the Joss and Co world!",1065484800,,905,4.096590909090909
1909137,5,B0000AQS18,"(In my opinion) Buffy-VS-Dracula was a poor excuse for a beginning episode. Though if played in the middle of the season, I might have liked it a little better. There was no real breaking moments, and come on, lets face it, it need some more James Marsters (Spike.)
I was beginning to think season 5 would be like season 4 (a little too light and cheery, no plot) and I was really confused when they introduced Dawn. I was like, who the heck is she? But when things started coming together, early on in the season I started liking it more. Dawn was a great addition to the show. Where does Joss Whedon and co. think up this stuff? Really great idea having Dawn be 'The Key,' the thing that can open the Hellmouth.
I have to admit, I NEVER saw it coming when Spike fell in love with Buffy. Can't say I was disappointed, though. Spike was (and is) my favorite character, so having him fall for the good guy is ok with me.
Fool for Love was so...full of Spike, which automatically makes it okay with me :). I always wanted to see what Spike's past was like, and it's halarious that he was a poet! A bad poet, no less. Can't really say it surprised me, though, I always took Spike to be a romantic (in his own twisted way...) Also loved the way Spike comforted Buffy on the porch, made me think Spike might just be turning into a good guy.
The Body was superb. It was so real, it just blew me away how
amazing it was. I cried not only beacause it was so sad, but because it was so beautiful. It took me about an hour after the show had ended to realize that some time or other I had to get up from the couch. The only that could have made it better is if Spike had been in it. Yeah.
Episode, The Gift...my gosh, where do I begin? I loved the way every character seemed to have a big part in it, and all contributed. This show made me hate Glory with a passion. And Buffy's speech made me CRY SO HARD! It was torture that they ended it the way they did, and it was (no joke) killing me until they started up Season 6.
Season 5 was beautiful, funny, dramatic, and really made up for the of season 4 (or, you know, lack of.) Oh, just have to say this, wasn't a big fan of Tara in season 4, but in season 5 I fell in love with her, and accepted her as a Scooby. James Marsters rocks.",1065398400,7,2275,4.0690423162583516
1909138,3,B0000AQS18,"Gentle Readers:
Buffy is the best show in the world, and if you don't already know that, you have been missing out on life for the past seven years. Season five is probably my favorite because a lot of discoveries are made: Dawn is the Key, Glory is a God, and Ben is..well..he's a confusing guy. Look forward to lots of laughs, apocalypses, and death. This is, after all, Buffy. As a dedicated, loyal ""buffaholic,"" I would recommend this DVD to anyone who enjoys action, sly humor, drama, and romance all spun together. Buffy will go down in history forever as the show that broke all the rules, and what better way to re-live the memories? Go ahead. Don't be afraid.

All heartwrenching episodes that proves that ensemble is one of the best. All the acting is superb, especially Sarah Michelle Gellar. Her performance in The Body should have won her an Emmy, or at least got her nominated. My friend who hates Sarah saw this episode and it changed her entire opinion on her, she was in tears. I'm not going to get into the details of the season, you'll have to see for yourself, but believe me when I say, you'll be stunned.

1909142,4,B0000AQS18,"I think that Season Five of ""Buffy"" betrayed the first signs that the series was getting old.  Not in a bad way -- there was never a bona fide jump the shark moment -- but the sum of its parts was slightly less than the whole.  Many great episodes, both comic and tragic, but the glue holding it all together was a little weak.
The early changes in ""Buffy""'s format were terrific.  The young Michelle Trachtenberg, Buffy's sister Dawn, did a great job creating the kind of character that's usually the bane of an aging show: the newly-introduced family member.  At age 15, Trachtenberg introduced a very natural acting style far more palatable than even Sarah Michelle Gellar's work at a similar age.  The explanation behind Dawn's sudden appearance -- that reality was molded around Buffy's life to account for the insert of a teenage sister -- is carried off with great humor.  ""Real Me"", an episode that could have alienated the entire audience, turned out to be one of the show's enduring classics, and did a great job of reinventing the show yet again.
Joyce Summers (Kristine Sutherland) departed the series late in the season, after surviving a battle with brain cancer.  Not much more can be said about how superb ""The Body"" is.  One of Joss Whedon's finest scripts (and directing jobs) handled the sudden death of a major character with a combination of grace and raw shock.  Not only was there no incidental music, but the camera was off-centered and Buffy's POV shots were kept out of focus.  The episode ended with a morgue fight sequence, as Buffy battled the ugliest vampire we've seen yet: a scarred, bruised, pale creature, not wearing any clothes.
Spike's first full season as a regular established him as the dark comic/light tragic sidekick that buoyed him right on over to ""Angel"" once ""Buffy"" finally went off the air.  ""Fool For Love"" took us from a surprise twist on the origin of the name ""William the Bloody""), through Spike's elationship with Drusilla, and his killing of two slayers (the latter death would become even more significant in Season 7).  Around this time we learned that Spike developed a crush on Buffy, a scenario played at first for laughs, until it reached a climax in the dark, dark Valentine's Day comedy (""Crush"").
The weak spot of the season, if there was one, came from the year's Big Bad, Glory (Clare Kramer), an evil god from another dimension, locked into our own world.  Glory engaged in season-length pursuit of ""The Key"", a mystical force bound into human form and hidden in this dimension by Eastern European monks.  Clare Kramer's acting style is energetic, manic and gleeful, but Glory failed to ever have a meaningful connection with Buffy, unlike previous season villains (Spike, Angel, Faith, the Mayor, the Initiative).  Glory and Buffy just fight several times, until Buffy bonks Glory over the head with a troll hammer.
Joel Gray was introduced as a recurring character late in the season -- in the midst of a string of chase/capture/pursuit episodes that lacked much individual flavor or movement -- but was never really given much to do.  He left the show just in time to miss Season 6's musical episode.  There's also no real ""twist"" in the season, no betrayal by Angel or Faith, no sudden revelation of a new, more dangerous villain than we'd previously suspected.
""The Gift"" remains one of ""Buffy""'s better season finales.  When Glory is finally dispatched, the deed is done using elements from several previous episodes (including the hilarious ""Triangle"", an episode featuring the return of Anya's ex-husband, an ale-guzzling troll), and the mystical connection between Dawn and Buffy is finally exploited.
And then it all ended in a slow-motion dive from the top of the tower, and the season's final shot, a tombstone, informed us that ""She saved the world.  A lot."", and, for the second time, a ""Buffy"" season ended with Buffy's life in total disarray, but this time, we'd have to wait through four months -- and a change in networks -- to find out if we were ever getting her back.",1065052800,10,4056,4.8268398268398265

1909144,4,B0000AQS18,"This is a review of the special features for the Buffy Season Five DVD. If you have queries how I've seen it, I have it on Region 4 and its definitely worth buying on Region 1 if you're a big Buffy fan.
**SPECIAL FEATURES**
DISC 1 --
Commentary by David Fury & David Grossman for ""Real Me"" - I didn't find this all that interesting because I didn't exactly love the episode, but David Fury has some interesting things to say about introducing Dawn.
DISC 2 --
Commentary by Douglas Petrie and script for ""Fool For Love"" - Douglas Petrie's commentary is not as great as I expected, he should've gone into more detail about the behind-the-scenes stuff in ""FFL"" instead of focusing on all the plot points. However we get some information on the building of the sets and his motivation to do the episode.
DISC 3 --
Trailers - We get trailers for Buffy Season 2, Buffy Season 3, Buffy Season 4, Buffy the Movie, Angel Season 1 and Angel Season 2.
Script for ""Into the Woods"" - What can I say? Good script.
Featurettes - Buffy Abroad, Demonology: A Slayers Guide, Casting Buffy, Action Heroes - The Stunts of Buffy
**I haven't watched Buffy Abroad yet, but if it is anything as good as the hilarious Danny Strong hosted Demonology, or as insightful as Casting Buffy, or as stunt-packed as Action Heroes, it should be a good watch.
DISC 4 --
Script for ""Checkpoint"" - Nice script. I wish they were easier to read though.
Commentary by Jane Espenson for ""I Was Made to Love You"" - One of the more honest commentaries I've heard. Jane goes into detail about the things she liked and didn't like about the episode, and also why she wrote it.
DISC 5 --
Commentary by Joss Whedon for ""The Body"" - This is one excellent commentary. Joss talks about making the episode, why he chose to shoot the way he did, the pacing of the episode, the actors, and how hard it was to make it in such a depressing mood. Anybody who loved the episode (its my second favourite) will LOVE the commentary.
DISC 6 --
Featurettes - The Story of Season 5, Natural Causes, Spotlight on Dawn
**The Story of Season 5 is fun to watch because you get interviews with the cast, crew and writers and why they did the episodes they did (especially liked the talk about ""Buffy vs. Dracula""). I really wish Sarah would allow herself to be interviewed, she never really talks about Buffy on the DVDs. Also, they never talked much about ""The Gift"" as an episode, but talked a lot about the minor episodes like ""The Replacement."" I'd love to hear what she has to say. Natural Causes is an excellent look at the making of ""The Body"" and why the writers chose to have Joyce die a natural death. Spotlight on Dawn talks about the importance of family and Dawn symbolising that. Excellent featurettes, better than the Disc 3 ones.
Still Gallery - Nice promo pics for the season. I wish there were more of ""The Gift"" and less of ""Buffy vs. Dracula"" just like I did with the Story of Season 5 featurette.
_________________________________________________________
TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY? I say buy. There is a good load of special features here, all enjoyable to watch or listen to. The only complaint I have is that there is no commentary for ""The Gift"" and the writers don't really talk that much about it when they are interviewed. Did something bad happen on the making of that episode? Oh well, apart from that small flaw, this DVD is probably the best Buffy DVD package to date, but I haven't bought Season 6 yet, but I'll be getting it soon, and will review when a page comes up for it.",1065052800,3,3534,4.4636785162287484
1909145,5,B0000AQS18,"I never watched Buffy in Syndication.  As a matter of fact I don't watch T.V. very often.  I happened to catch a episode of Buffy over at a friends house and have been hooked ever since.  I don't have a favorite season.  I have favorite episodes but the show has been consistantly well written since the first season.  I just wish that such a well written show wasn't gone.  The whole show was a impressive display of our culture, relationships and the heartaches we all suffer.
Bravo to the Joss Whedon and his team of writers.
P.S.  I heard that Sarah Michelle Geller had signed a contract to appear in a couple of episodes of Angel during the upcomming season.  If only we could get the whole cast to come back for a few more seasons.  I miss them already. (B00 HOO)",1064966400,5,769,4.359154929577465
1909146,5,B0000AQS18,Season Five is in my opinion up there with Season Three in terms of story development. I really liked how the characters grew and the biliiant introduction of Dawn into the story line. Since so much has been written about the season's stories I will use my review to ask the producers of the DVD for a few small chances. Season Five brings about the first outtake clip of the series YEAH!. However one thing that is missing and would have been a real treat is if there was a way to access the brilliantly done Previously montage to The Gift. The Gift is the 100th episode in the series and in the course of two minutes the creators manage to capture five years of story line. It was very well done and would have been nice to see as part of this DVD collection.,1064707200,33,761,4.255172413793104
1909147,3,B0000AQS18,"Season six is a lot better because it becomes
darker in exploring rapid maturity and lust.
Season five however is vital in developing this.
Spike finds love that will eventually leave him
heartbroken and buffy draws closer to pain.
LEAVE Xander ALONE, people get fat, so stop making
fun of him, OK? The finale is important in letting
you know the loyalty between spike and buffy no
matter how much friction there is. If you are an
avid buffy fan, purchase season 5 ,  if not....
wait till season 6 and buy that.....season 7 is a
poor storyline and very boring but all the other
seasons are worth purchasing. Please
buy season six , THE MUSICAL IS FANTASTIC.",1064620800,4,657,4.567796610169491
1909148,5,B0000AQS18,"This was, in my opinion, the best season. So many things happened, and they were good and bad. It started with the episode &amp;quot;Buffy vs. Dracula&amp;quot; and ended with &amp;quot;The Gift&amp;quot;. To sum up this season, Buffy's new sister, Dawn, (Michelle Tratchenberg) who we later found out was not her sister, but a key, arrived. Riley left Buffy, Spike finally admitted his love for Buffy, in the excellent episode &amp;quot;Crush&amp;quot;, and Buffy sacrificed herself to save the world from this seasons nemesis, a hell-god named Glory. (Played by Clare Kramer) It was my favorite season, along with season six, and proved just how PERFECT and BRILLIANT the actors, writers, and creator Joss Whedon are. Always having a great storyline, great cast, and awesome episodes, Buffy will never let us down.",1064448000,,816,5.2846153846153845
1909149,4,B0000AQS18,"Season 5 of Buffy was a breath of fresh air after the lackluster Initiative storyline of Season 4. Many of the characters go through changes...Buffy deals with a new annoying sister named Dawn, Riley is jealous and pimps himself out to vamps, Willow is more comfortable in her sexuality, Giles becomes redundant, Xander starts to get fat, Anya displays her comedic brilliance and Spike explores obsession. The highlights of this season include Joyce's death, a suped-up Harmony, the return of Druscilla and the Buffy-bot! The main villian, Glory also proved to be a delight, though the actress that portrayed her did seem to lay it on a bit thick at times. The final arch involving Buffy's death is also a treat, though I do believe they should have just ended it here and not given us the lame season 6 or the pitiful final season. After this season it is all downhill for the Scoobies as Giles leaves, Spike is the Fonz and Xander becomes so obese he looks like he'd be leaving Sunnydale for the Macy's Parade.",1064448000,3,1012,4.691011235955056
1909150,5,B0000AQS18,"In this season, we of course learn a lot about the mysterious new character named Dawn, and how she is really this mystical key that these monks have put into the form of something that Buffy will forever protect; a sister. And then there's this fallen god who is after this key named Glory, and there's this thing that she does where she can transform herself from...well, from a female and to a male and back again in some rather spectacularly wonderful special effects.
We also learn though that even through some of these spectacular battles, the Summers family all have lives and a past that reach far beyond Sunnydale, some of them very fragile and shattered lives.
As we learn of Spike's past from before he became a vampire in leagues with Angel and Darla, we learn that he wasn't always as crass and spiteful as he once became. We learn of Tara's past, and how she was conditioned into what she had become as she was growing up, as well as how far back the memories of Dawn reach back.
But while learning of the rich histories of many of our characters, we also learn of the impending death of Joyce Summers with her brain tumor, which culminated in the episode ""The Body"", which had no background music, and no real special mission for Buffy to go on.
Of course, none of this underscores the climatic battle between Buffy and Glory, where Buffy makes the ultimate sacrifice, impending in her own death.",1064361600,5,1412,4.562992125984252
1909151,5,B0000AQS18,"The Fifth season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer is one of the best.  Not only does it introduce Buffy's little sister, Dawn, it also gives the Slayer, finally, a strong female villain to spar against.  Not only is she bad, she's a God.  Glorificus.  Glory.  The season starts off with a fun episode pitting Buffy against the king of vampires, Dracula.  It also introduces a recurring theme in the fifth season.  Darkness.  While, Buffy is good, darkness still resides within her.  At the end of the episode, we are introduced to Dawn.  In the next few episodes, Dawn is revealed to be the Key, a device Glory can use to get back to her Hell dimension and destroy the world unless Buffy can stop her.  This season sees the departure of Buffy's boyfriend Riley, the furthering of Willow's relationship with Tara, and the start of Spike's infatuation and future love affair with the Slayer.  The two best episodes of the season, are ""The Body"" and ""The Gift"".  ...  It is an amazingly written ep filmed with no soundtrack.  The final ep is ""The Gift"".  If you haven't seen it I won't ruin the surprise, but it is in the top five best ep's ever.  The fifth season cements ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" as one of TV's finest dramas with an exceptional cast.  It is a worthy addition to anyones DVD collection.",1064361600,21,1298,4.545454545454546

SO YEAH! This Season ROCKED!!! It had the best stuff happen, it made me laugh SO hard, and cry at points, and it was packed FULL of drama. OH!

1909153,5,B0000AQS18,"In the 7 years that it was on television Buffy the Vampire Slayer did manage to be all over the place in writing quality and plots but 5th season is one of the best of the 7.
I thought Buffy vs. Dracula was pretty stupid, but did like the way Dawn was sprung on us. Glory was prehaps the best villain of the entire series, managing to be evil, tough and serious with several comical bits thrown in. Examples of this would be when Willow and Tara transported her miles away and to high altitude (Glory goes ""Oh Shi-!,as she falls to Earth) and the truck encounter with Buffy. In this one after she's caught up with Dawn and Buffy she's told by Buffy ""I've got just one word to say to you Glory- Truck""as Glory is knocked down the street by a passing 18 wheeler.
Some of the battles are also very good if a bit inconsistent. Over the years Buffy has taken several beatings being injured to various degrees and sometimes had an awful time just beating a single Vampire. During 5th season Buffy really gets knocked around by Glory, takes some amazing falls and blows, but doesn't seem to suffer like she had in the past. I especially liked two of the battles, in the 1st Buffy has just split up with Riley and runs into the pack of Vampires whose home she'd torched, for a girl whose been known to have difficulty with 1 Vampire she takes out I think 8 of them. The other battle is the climactic season ender in which Buffy beats Glory to a pulp and shows mercy to her (in her brother Ben human form)before going off to rescue Dawn. It was a nice touch when Giles, the nice calm good guy finishes him off becuase as he tells Ben Glory will resurface and be a danger, buffy spared her anyway because she's a hero.
The list of extras that come with this set sure sound like they'll be really good.",1063929600,,1791,4.270588235294118
1909154,5,B0000AQS18,"The Fifth Season of Buffy is one of the best. It's a three-way tie for best season between this one, season three, and season seven. This season features the shows best villian, Glory, and two of the best episodes of the entire series, The Body and The Gift. It is also the season in which Buffy's sister Dawn is introduced. Plus, it's the season where Anya becomes a main character, and Drusilla returns (although it is just one episode). There are, however, some negative bits in this season. First of all, Riley is still here to annoy us for the first half of the season. Luckily he left half-way through. But after he left, Spike started falling in love with Buffy. I think spike is a great character, but he was MUCH better when he was with Dru. Buffy and Spike's ""relationship"" in the sixth season made me sick, and is the main reason that season six is my least favorite. But that's off the subject. My point is that season five is one of the best, and anyone who doesn't buy this shouldn't be allowed to have a DVD player. This show is awesome.",1063756800,2,1052,4.4

He started out with such potential in Season 4, but then he was made ""normal"" and seemed to lose not only his military strength, but his personality and feelings as well.  He is so concerned about Buffy not being there for him, when it's her mother that is in and out of the hospital.  It was great to see him fly off into the horizon and not look back.  However as good as it was to see Riley leave he was replaced with someone that was even less likable.  Dawn the whinest of all characters.  She hates her big sister, she hates that everyone treats her as a child, she hates that big sis Buffy is the slayer, she hates...everything.  This season showed great leaps for the character building of Xander, Anya, Spike, Willow and Tara.  It also shows Giles and Buffy working together perfectly against the Council to get their way.

1909158,4,B0000AQS18,"Season Five was the last strong one for Buffy, with a well thought-out story arc.  Aside from a truly bizarre throwaway comic-relief season opener, ""Buffy Vs. Dracula""  -  which is entertaining enough if you're in the mood for it  -  and a couple other less satisfying humorous hors d'ouevres, the season overall was one of the more powerful.  In fact, the series in general would have been better off if it had ended with Season Five.
Buffy finds herself with an all but indestructible nemesis  -  a literal goddess from another dimension, referred to as ""Glory"" (Clare Kramer)  -  and with a kid sister named Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg).  The link connecting the two newcomers is quite clever, and provides for twenty-two episodes' worth of intense melodrama.  Glory is the most cheerfully psychopathic foe Buffy ever faced, supremely confident (she is a goddess, after all), vain in the extreme, and blithely unconcerned that her quest to open a dimensional gateway back to her original home will utterly destroy the planet Earth.  What's one more dead planet, when she has annihilated so many?
In order to prevent this unparalleled carnage, a mystic society of monks have concealed the energy key Glory requires to re-enter her own realm, and entrusted it to the care of the Slayer  -  Sunnydale's own Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar).  Once entrusted with her most important mission, Buffy is caught in the worst bind she has ever faced  -  she cannot tell any of her friends the secret truth, without severely endangering their very minds, not to mention their lives.  Glory will stop at nothing to achieve her ends, and is capable of absorbing the minds of selected prey and leaving them functional vegetables.  Buffy's attempt to save the world will even find her trying the one strategy she has never had to employ before:  running like crazy.
Season Five is not without flaws, though they are fairly negligible.  Its biggest problem is simply the number of growing character contradictions catching up to it from previous seasons, but these are quickly forgotten or easily glanced-over for the sake of the drama at hand.  Spike (James Marsters) begins his mad descent into obsessive lust over Buffy, and Buffy and her Iowa corn-fed hunky boyfriend, Riley (Marc Blucas), reach a permanent romantic impasse; Harmony Kendall (Mercedes McNab), Spike's ill-begotten vampire stepchild/lover, attempts to become an arch-nemesis of Buffy, who is all the more comical in contrast with the very real terror of Glory.
Two of the most dramatic episodes of the entire series are present in this season, ""The Body,"" in which Buffy loses her mother (Kristine Sutherland)  -  not to any monsters or vampires but simply to illness  -  and the finale in which Buffy literally lays down her life for her loved ones and the world.
Buffy has been better than in this action-packed and emotionally wrenching season, but not by much.  And you really can't beat that incredible finale.",1063238400,43,2977,4.995934959349594
1909159,5,B0000AQS18,"Season 5 on Buffy the Vampire Slayer had two of the best storylines with the introduction of Dawn and the arrival of her greatest foe to date, Glorificus. It is full of memorable episodes and life-changing moments. Some of the highlights include: Riley's departure from Sunnydale, Spike joining the Scooby Gang as a somewhat good guy, Dawn's real purpose being exposed, the death of Buffy's mother, and the death of Buffy.  Two of my favorite episodes come from this season. The emotional episode, THE BODY, in which Joyce dies and the season finale, THE WISH, where Buffy sacrifices her life to save Dawn and the world. I highly recommend this season as one of the greatest.",1063238400,6,675,4.818965517241379
1909160,5,B0000AQS18,"This season is my favorite of the Buffy series.  Buffy comes full circle in this season, where at the top of her game, she faces her most powerful foe.  What is so great about this season is that the main plot arc, and all the sub-plot arcs, are introduced AND resolved.  Something that latter seasons of BtVS lacked.  You have Buffy becoming aware of her full potential as a slayer, Willow and Tara's relationship (one of the best and most endearing I've ever seen on t.v.) Xander fully understanding what Anya means to him, Dawn's introduction and Joyce's death, and how could anyone forget Spike's revealation of his love for the Slayer and insights into the man behind the vampire (Fool for Love is my favorite episode of the season).  Season 5 of BtVS reminded us just how good television was capable of being, and how a great story could touch our lives.",1063065600,15,860,4.594771241830065

And for the record this season does NOT have the musical episode.  But it does have the Buffy-bot, and Spike realizing his feelings for Buffy.  It's the season where Riley realizes he's not the most important thing in Buffy's life, and of course, one of the best episodes of the show ever: 'The Body'.  Well worth the money, and well worth the time it'll take to watch the whole season over again.",1063065600,,537,4.552083333333333
1909162,5,B0000AQS18,"5 Years of Buffy gone by, this being the season that elevates it into heights unheard of.  If season 2 was good, and season 3 was better, the fifth was in many ways the pinnacle of the show in overall greatness.  With a strong opening show showcasing the world's most famous vampire (Dracula) against the Slayer, it picks up from there by also introducing Buffy's little sister Dawn.  What? Buffy doesn't have a little sister you say? Leave it to this show to mess with your head and yet make perfect sense after explaining it.  Foreshadowed by Faith in season 3, and hinted at  by Tara in season 4, Buffy gains a little sister who apparently was always there.  Not going to spoil the details, but rest assured this story arc will begin to make sense and when it does, you can't help but grin at how good it gets.
The season's big bad has a lot to do with the Dawn arc, and is one of the best villains since the Mayor and Faith.  Glory, or Glorificus, a hell goddess bent on obtaining something called the key in our world.  One of the best things about the great villains in Buffy is that you love them.  You hate them because they're evil, but at the same time, the actors that portray them make them characters you can't help but love.  It happened with Spike and Dru, it happened with Faith and the Mayor, and it happens here, with Glory.  Kudos to actress Clare Kramer who gives us the best evil performance since Angelus, Faith, and the Mayor
This season also marks big changes in the fact that we lose one of the major supporting characters in the Buffy universe, not a major cast member but one that has been with us since the beginning.  THE BODY, is without a doubt one of the finer moments in television, full of emotion and...silence.  Not silence as in last year's HUSH, but silence in that this episode features no music, no soundtrack...just ambient noise and the dialogue of our scoobies dealing with their loss.  Again, Buffy shows that it remains one of TV's most convincing dramas with this very powerful episode.  I've never seen a show that showed grieving over the loss of a loved one so strong and convincing. Too bad many people cannot see past the name of the show and the monsters to believe that.  If they could, they'd learn a lot about what drama can be.  All the monsters and demons in Buffy are metaphors for our problems, and as such it allows it to tackle things in ways ordinary shows can't begin to fathom.
All in all, a great season, and it rightfully earns it's stars and a place amongst your DVD collection.",1062979200,,2545,4.427038626609442
1909163,5,B0000AQS18,"Just like to point out some clarification on Season 5.
This is NOT the season with the musical episode as idgietowanda states.  Season 6, Episode 7 is 'Once More, With Feeling'.  Season 5 is the season with the whole arc of Dawn, Glory, and Spike as a kinda good guy.
This is one of my favorite (departure of Riley) and least favorite (Dawn/sister/mystical key) seasons, but to get to my favorite season (Season 6), we need to understand why Buffy feels like she does which leads to the final scene of 'Once More, With Feeling' and the subsequent episodes.  This is a good season with some fun stuff, but a 'necessary evil' in my opinion, to get to the better episodes.",1062979200,2,669,4.512396694214876

1909165,5,B0000AQS18,"Some other reviewer claimed that this was the season with the episode ""Once More, With Feeling"" in it, but that was season six, not five.  Season five is even better.  Aside from season two, which was completely amazing, this was the best.  It had everything us 'gentle viewers' could hope for; an awesome new character, Dawn, Buffy and Riley broke up (thank God), and Spike revealed his love for Buffy.
  Joss Wheadon (I apologize if I spelled it wrong) is, simply put, a genius.  He, with the help of many other brilliant writers, directors and actors, make an amazing season.  Every episode leaves you asking 'what next' with Buffy's constant battle with her place in the world.  And it all leads up to one of the best episodes of the shows history: ""The Gift"" when she makes the ultimate sacrifice.  All the characters, who's lives start to lead them on separate paths, are brought together in this heart-warming/breaking end.  I advise anyone and everyone who is a fan of the show to buy this DVD set. If you don't watch it, start from season one, you won't regret it.",1062892800,,1073,4.62962962962963

After all who can stay 16 forever huh?
As many have said, a ""bad"" Buffy ep is 10 times better than anything else on the tube. Word. ""The Body"" is haunting. ""Fool For Love"" is intense, and ""The Gift"" left me speechless. The best season finale I can think of besides maybe Deep Space 9's Season 5 ending.

Just an fyi, this is not the seaon with ""Once More With Feeling.""  That would be the 6th season.",1062720000,4,360,4.25
1909170,5,B0000AQS18,"Some have said that the series dropped the ball after the less than stellar fourth season. Me included. Although, to be fair, I have come to think of it as being better than it was at first viewing a few years ago. Season five returns the show to glory in a truly brilliant, and glorious way. If anyone had doubts over season four, this season put them completely back into place. As season 4 pushed Buffy and our other young heroes into a new world when they entered college life, this season makes them grow up even more. As every season has been a natural progression in the lives of these people, this one continues the tradition. The season opens up with a lightweight, though amusing episode, ""Buffy Vs. Dracula"". It isn't until the final scene that the season kicks off the twists and turns and sets things into motion. We learn that Buffy has a little sister named Dawn(Michelle Trachtenberg). How could this be?. We don't get an answer the fifth episode, ""No Place Like Home"", where we learn exactly how Dawn came to be. I won't ruin it for you if you haven't already seen it yet. Dawn and her appearance is pretty much the main story for the season, and she is the main goal for this years's big bad, Glory(Clare Kramer). Glory is a God, who needs the key(Dawn), in order to reenter her hell dimension. And in doing so, will open other portals and cause severe destruction to earth. Glory is an interesting villain, but she is hard to take seriously when she looks like a cheerleader and talks like a valley girl. Relationships abound once again in this season. Most importantly, Buffy and Riley. The relationship comes to a head in ""Into The Woods"", when Buffy, thanks to Spike, finds out a dark secret Riley has been hiding. Riley leaves and Buffy is again handed more loss. But it doesn't compare to the loss of her mother, Joyce, in ""The Body"". This was the most devastating episode of any show, genre or not, that I have ever seen. Joss Whedon proved once again why he is a genius. This episode was real. It didn't push the envelope to make you cry. It just happens naturally. There is no music at all in the episode, and the story playing out on screen is so vivid and real, that you feel you stomach in knots as you watch it. Never has an episode effected me. Just brilliant. Again, the Emmy's just didn't get it. We learned that Joyce had a brain tumor, and this was taken further in ""Shadow"", and ""Listening To Fear"". These were sub-par episodes, but the Joyce angle was heartbreaking. Angel makes a visit in ""Forever"", where Buffy tries to handle Joyce's funeral, and Dawn tries a spell to bring her mom back from the grave. The final scene is another powerhouse scene. Because of this loss, Buffy is faced with another mission other than being the slayer. Being there for Dawn. Buffy has been wise beyond her years already, but now she has no parent, and she has a little kid sister. It forces Buffy to grow up in new ways. That's the story here. Growing up. Xander and Anya get more serious and stable in their relationship, as does Willow and Tara. Giles gets back on his feet again and opens up his own place, The Magic Box. The most startling revelation in this season was Spike's love for Buffy. It all comes out in ""Crush"", when Drusilla, Spike's ex, comes back to town. It was a brilliant move and it played off well. Other episodes here include ""Checkpoint"", a wonderful episode that deals with the return of the Watcher's Council, who want to test Buffy some more. ""Blood Ties"" deals with Dawn finding out who, or what, she reall is. Dawn might of been annoying, but she was a real 14 year old. Trachtenberg did a wonderful job in doing this. Anya got her moment to shine in ""Triangle"", when a troll is summoned to town over her and Willow's bickering. The final three episodes are some of the strongest of the season. ""Spiral"" deals with Buffy coming to realize that Glory is far too powerful. In a very un-Buffy fashion, she decides to run, instead of staying and standing up to the evil. The episode includes a teriffic chase scene between a winnebago and knights on horses that also included a fantastic fight with Buffy on top of the winnebago. ""The Weight Of The World"", the first part of the finale, isn't nearly as strong as the conclusion, but it holds it's own. Buffy is in a catatonic state over Dawn, and Willow tries to get into her mind to get her back out. ""The Gift"", along with ""The Body"", is also one of the top episodes. It is also one of Buffy's finest hours in all of it's run. It is the season finale, and also the show's 100th episode, and it is a beaut. Everything is perfect. The final fight with Glory is a blast, and the end minute is one of the most emotional scenes in the series. Teriffic. ""Fool For Love"", the seventh episode, is a Buffy gem. One of the best Buffy episodes ever. Buffy is injured while on patrol, and she goes to the only person she knows who has killed slayers. Spike. Spike tells her, via flashbacks that includes the return of Angelus, Darla, and Drusilla, how the deaths occurred. Every frame is perfection. ""Family"", gives Tara her moment in the sun. We learn more about her and her family life when her relatives come to town harboring a secret about Tara and the women in their family. A solid episode with great work from Amber Benson. Season five of Buffy is a glorious return to form. It makes up for the lulls and lags of season 4 in a big way, and then some. The writting is as sharp and witty as ever. The arcs and mythology are the best that has been on television. This is one of the most emotional seasons of the series, and it is marvelous because of the work of the brilliant cast. Year after year, season after season, they show what a unbelievable cast they are. They deserve so much credit, but they never seem to get it. Get season five. It is Buffy getting back to form, and it is as good as it gets.",1062720000,5,5901,4.409715857011916

Right now, 20th Century Fox has delayed production of this season on DVD as well as the Firefly collection.  You can vote for it on amazon.com by submitting your email address at the top of this page.  And you should.  Buffy's fifth season is, in my opinion, the best season in the show's seven season run.  It was the most consistently well plotted, written, directed and acted twenty-two episodes.  Season five of  Buffy was epic.  It was mythic.  Beginning with an encounter with Dracula, the tone of the season is set up with Buffy wanting Giles to become her watcher again and searching for knowledge about the history of the Slayer line.  As other reviewers have pointed out, fans had really mixed feelings about the sudden addition of Dawn, Buffy's little sister to the cast.  I, for one, think it was yet another stroke of  Joss Whedon's genius.  I will also have to add that the season's big bad, Glory, has been the most formidable villain the Slayer has ever faced.  The season's theme is about loss.  Buffy loses everything she cares about until in the huge, huge season finale, the Gift, she doesn't ""know how to live in this world if these are the choices...if everything just gets stripped away.""  And we all know how that turned out for her.  All the other subplots are great to watch unfold as well-Giles' Magic Box, Anya and Xander's growing romance, Joyce's illness, Tara and Willow's trust and relationship, Willow's growing magic, Xander's finding success, Buffy and Riley's ""implosion"", and of course, Spike's revelation of his love for the Slayer.  I could go on and on about the greatness of the fifth season of Buffy, but in conclusion-vote for it.  buy it when it comes out.  love it.  watch it over and over.  and over.  I've watched since season two first aired through the end on May 20, 2003, and have always said that this is the best show on television.",1062374400,27,1983,4.651296829971182
1909175,5,B0000AQS18,"One of the most extraordinary things about BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER is that in Season Two they managed to produce one of the greatest seasons in the history of television, and then managed to pretty much equal it for the entire run of the show.  Amazingly, each year they did this by taking the show in completely different directions.  In the season opener Buffy meets and defeats the most famous of all vampires, Dracula, but the show demonstrated its willingness to take extraordinary risks by ending the episode with the startlingly revelation that Buffy has a sister.  Buffy, of course, is an only child, but the brilliant thing was the way the show continued for several episodes as if Dawn, Buffy's new sister, had always been a part of the family.  Moreover, Dawn isn't just a part of her immediate family:  all Buffy's friends have their own relationship with Dawn, and she is clearly completely integrated with everyone in the community.
There are Buffy fans who like and dislike nearly every aspect of BUFFY.  Some did not care for the addition of Dawn to the cast, but I loved it, partly for the virtuosic manner in which they integrated her in the cast, and partly for the astonishing story line that developed out of who she truly was.  Dawn, an entity of pure energy that is a key to a demon portal, was created by monks as a real human being, a real sister to The Slayer, in order to guarantee that Buffy would protect her with her life.  I love the way that all the Scooby Gang completely accepts her, and the profound questions it raises in Dawn herself, as she desperately attempts to come to terms with the knowledge that she isn't who she remembers herself to be.
Old subplots are resolved and new ones emerge.  Buffy's romance with Riley, nearly universally loathed by Buffy fans, thankfully ends.  Giles takes over the ownership of The Magic Box and Anya becomes his enthusiastic assistant.  Spike, still harmless due to his implant, is horrified to realize that he is in love with Buffy.  Joyce is stricken with a brain tumor and eventually dies of a brain aneurysm, which leads to what is in many ways the most remarkable episode in the entire history of the show, ""The Body.""  Most of Buffy is shot employing a quick, fast moving pace.  But this episode intentionally slows down time, intensifying and emphasizing every nuance of Buffy's overwhelming grief and panic at discovering her mother's body.  In my opinion, it is the single best representation in either film or TV of human reaction to the death of a loved one.
Season Five's primary story arc is, however, that of the hell goddess Glory and her attempt to recover The Key (Dawn) that will allow her to reenter her hell dimension.  Glory is, with the possible exception of Angelus, the best villain in the history of BUFFY and ANGEL.  She is a goddess portrayed as super consumer (her nice shoes and pedicures causes Dawn to remark, ""She has really nice feet""), going on spending sprees to placate her sorrows at being trapped in a dimension not her own.  Her whacky wit and (for a goddess) naive stupidity combined with her considerable power creates excitement nearly every second she is onscreen.  In a season of many highlights, I especially love the episode where Glory's minions wrongly assume that Spike is The Key, and bring him to Glory, who tortures him to find out who The Key truly is.  Despite beating him badly, he refuses to tell.  Buffy's intense and heartfelt gratitude signals a change in attitude on the part of the Scoobies, and hints that behavior and compassion are as much a mark of someone becoming good (despite being a vampire) as having a soul (in the case of Angel).  The final episode, ""The Gift,"" is one of the truly epic moments in the entire series, and yet another of the classic moments that BUFFY left us.  The final shot of the season is simply heartbreaking.",1062201600,149,3881,4.675

Although the season is based on Dawn and where she came from i think the writters could have gone a different way.  I personally think that Dawn is an annoying addition to the Buffy series.

The introduction of Dawn was iffy to me, but she grew on me by season 7. Also, Tara's character gets some more play, but isn't truly defined as she is in season 6, where Amber Benson just struck gold. Besides that, buy this DVD.

1909178,5,B0000AQS18,"Season Five is often in competition with the third season for the title of the best season of the show. The choice is a hard one to make. Buffy's third season exploited the emotional turmoil of the second season so well that people are often left in awe. In fact I often use season two's finale, and season three together to introduce new people to the show. Yet as much as that emotion grabs us and takes for a ride never to be forgotten season five edges out. Season five hits you with one twist, and then another in a beautifully constructed season story that was impossible to live up to. Season Five begins with the oldest cliche in the history of horror, Dracula. The episode is funny, and filled with laughs. A typical stand alone Buffy episode, but its ending throws us a curve we didn't expect. The arrival of Dawn. Dawn is not explained. The scoobies believe she has been there the entire time, and like season two when we learn Angel has returned to being Angelsus we can watch the scoobies unknowingly walk into harms way. The suspense and twists of the discoverying of Dawn's origin, Glory, and the meaning of family build as the scoobies become caught in the middle of war. At the same time we get to see Spike addmitt he loves Buffy, and Tara and Willow continue to grow. This season offers us the first answers about the meaning of being a slayer, and a hero. The end of season five is the only other season ending ever to catch the emotion of Becoming part two. Buffy fights against the odds till she is strained, and about to break but refuses to give up. When D.C. comics killed Superman they had a line that said how the people watching Superman's final fight would remember it to the day they died. For those who have seen Season Five's conclusion you know it will stay with you.",1061942400,6,1800,4.424698795180723
1909179,5,B0000AQS18,"OK Here goes... Ive been watching Buffy since i was in 2nd grade when it premiered nad fell in love with the characters and storyline. Seasons 3,5,6,& 7 were by far the best seasons of the show.. In 5 Buffy gets her little sister Dawn played by Michelle Trachtenberg and she was a great addition into the show. Willow finally becomes a very powerfull witch and kicks some [butt] for a couple of mins. The Body was an amazing episode and showed the excelent acting abbilities of all the actors. I think everyone should buy this because its amazing and shows great demons and vamps. If only Faith had appeared in this season it would have been even better. The Tara and Willow storyline evolved and we all quickly accepted her into the show. The Gift was by far the best episode of the season where Buffy tells Dawn that they share the same blood and she was created out of her and sacrafices herself to save her sister and the world.

Hence, when the weekend comes and I no longer have the company of my coworkers, I escape my sad life with tv.  Ever since ""The Gift"" episodes have started airing, I've been glued to my tv every Saturday.  I aspire to have the solid bonds that Buffy and her friends have.  They risk their lives to save the world and each other.  In the last episode that I saw, Glory just took Dawn away from the shack in the desert.  Please release this season soon.  If anything, I can learn what a true friendship should encompass from these episodes.

1909182,5,B0000AQS18,"Well here, it finally is... Buffy season 5 on DVD.  Season Fived aired during the 2000-2001 Television Season, and in my oppion is the best season (where the gang wasn't in High School).  Season Five is also were the centrol plot of the show changed so much... It went from ""Buffy and her Friends battling Monsters will trying to become adults"" to ""Buffy and her Friends Battling Monsters and the responsibilites of Adulthood.""
This was a magical Season, that will always have a special place in my heart above all the other seasons (except Two, which was pure brillance).  I remember watching this season three years ago, and I remember how great it was... the comedy, the monsters, and the heartahce (and let me tell you there is ALOT of heartache in this season).  During the season Two key characters are introduced (Dawson - Sister of Buffy, and Warren - Future Evil Badguy), Two minor Characters become major characters to the story (Spike & Tara), and Two MAJOR characters Bite the Dust (for the maybe .5% of the people who are reading this and havn't seen the season I won't reurun it).
Included on this season is the incredible episodes (I was Made to Love you, The Body, Fool For Love, Family, Forever, and The Gift).  In ""I was made to Love you"" the writers show of there writting power so well by changing the mood from happy-go-lucky to throw-the-remot-and-stomp-on-it shocked and surprised.  In ""The Body"" the actors show how wonderful they are, and Joss Whedon uses a tastefully metaphor for death.  ""Fool For Love"" shows the history of the central fang gang (Darla, Angel, Dru, and Spike).  Family is the heartwarming episode where Tara becomes a full-blooded Scooby.  ""Forever"" is an episode that searches and demonstrates how people deal with greif in many different ways. And then there's ""The Gift"" the is no way to proberly descibe this episode... the only thing i can say is I almost broke my TV when i first saw it.  And those are only a handful of the 22 episodes of greatness for this season.
The Special Features for the Region 1 release havn't been released yet, but they are always very similar if not the same to the region 2 features which are as follows: Disc 1 - Script for ""The Replacement,"" Commentary for ""Real Me"" by DAvid Fury and David Grossman; Disc 2 - Script and Commentary for ""Fool for Love"" by Doug Petrie; Disc 3 - Script for ""into the woods,"" Featurettes (""Buffy Abroad,"" ""Demonology - A Slayers Guide,"" ""Casting Buffy,"" ""The Stunts of Buffy""), and 6 Trailers; Disc 4 - Script or ""Checkpoint,"" ""Commentary for ""I was made to Love you"" by Jane Espenson; Disc  5 - Commentary for ""the Body"" by Joss Whedon; Disc 6 - Featurettes (""the Story of Season 5,"" ""Natural Causes,"" ""Spotlight on Dawn""), Still Gallerys.  That the Special Features, but im keeping my fingers crossed for an additional commentary (like region 1 got for the 4th season dvd) on possibly ""Forever"" or ""THE GIFT"".

"" Fool for Love"", where we learn that everyone has a difficult past.
"" Checkpoint"", where Buffy in a wonderful display of loyalty and courage tells off the watcher's council.
"" The Body"", an episode so powerful and moving I can't even find words to describe it. This episode includes one of the saddest heart-wrenching moments ever to be seen anywhere else. This episode is so disturbingly realistic, with such raw emotion, that I can only view it about once a year. I suggest several boxes of kleenex.
"" The Gift"", possibly the greatest Buffy episode. Pure love and heroism throughout. It's an amazing ride. Once again I recommend several kleenex boxes.
You will not be dissapointed with this DVD, nor with any other Buffy DVD.",1059955200,2,1006,4.787356321839081
1909185,5,B0000AQS18,"My television passion used to be the X-Files. I watched BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER regularly but never made a huge fuss if I missed an episode or two. Season 5 of BUFFY changed all that.
I hate to say it, but the unforgivable television ploy of introducing a younger character to keep a show fresh actually works for BUFFY. At least, it works in Season 5. Season 6 is a different story. Anyway, in Season 5, we meet Dawn, Buffy's new younger sister (don't worry - they will explain how Buffy suddenly has a young teenage sister in due time). A crazy fashion victim with wicked ber-strength named Glory shows up in town searching for a key she claims was stolen from her. Riley and Buffy's relationship starts to go downhill. Buffy's mom, Joyce, gets sick, and suddenly Buffy finds herself in the role of caretaker. In one of my favorite developments on the show, Spike has a few revelations about himself and gets some intense character development as a result (""Fool for Love"", the episode where we learn the history of Spike, is one of the season's gems).

Season 5 is a little slow at first, but once Joss&Co. get the steam roller that is the season's over-arching plot going, it's arguably the best season of Buffy ever. As Buffy villains go, Glory is one of the more amusing. (I favor her second only to the Mayor from Season 3.) Dawn is annoying in that little sister way, but by the end of Season 5, I accepted her. (Of course, she starts to lose that acceptance with her behaviour in Season 6, but I digress.) Buffy and the Scoobies all take one more giant step away from childhood, and you can really begin to understand how this rather motley group has managed to save the world as many times as they have.
And of course, there's ""The Body"". It is one of the most amazing hours of television ever to air. Joss Whedon trades the musical score for a haunting soundtrack of ambient noise and follows our gang around as they react to the news that one of their loved ones has died a natural death. It only covers a few hours of time in the Buffyverse, and there is no huge evil to overcome (well, one vampire, but hey, it's Sunnydale - that's just a normal day's work). The melodrama takes the week off,  and yet, if you have a sympathetic bone anywhere in your body, you won't be able to help crying at least once while watching it. (I always break during Anya's speech in Willow's room.)
Other than a few key episodes, this is unlikely to be one of those seasons from which you get all your favorites, but at the end, the sum total will leave you feeling satisfied and glad you  hung in there for the long haul.",1059868800,5,2617,4.402892561983471
1909186,5,B0000AQS18,"Let me start off by saying that the sixth season is my overall favorite--which seems to put me in a minority of Buffy fans, so take that into consideration with this short review.  This fifth season is excellent as well.  In addition, this season contains ""The Body"", the best 50 minutes (or so) ever produced for television.  The cinematography; sometimes unique use of camerawork, sound, etc.; acting; and a sober yet occasionally funny script (with just the right balance of sober and funny) all add up to a breathtaking look at how we all handle the death of a loved one, especially an unexpected death.  Intelligent, insightful, moving, and powerful.  'Nuff said.",1059696000,2,668,4.928571428571429
1909187,5,B0000AQS18,"I won't bore you with a ton of repeated info. Others here have done a great job of telling you how much this Season has to offer. Buffy & Glory are great, but Willow has it going on this Season:) You go girl! If you are a Willow (Alyson Hannigan) fan, then this DVD set is for you. She's what kept me watching the seasons to follow:) Buffy/SMG who? Bored now...",1059609600,8,361,4.098591549295775
1909188,5,B0000AQS18,"Season 5 of Buffy is one of those amazing examples when all the story-telling elements come together to create a unified and explosive plotline arc. This season has everything: a deposed God, mideval knights, the watchers council, monks, lots of dark witchcraft, Dracula, two Xanders, the newly arrived little sister that turns out to be timeless destructive energy, Spike fighting for the good guys, the First Slayer, crazy robots, brain-sucking, aliens from outerspace, a really cute doctor, and the deaths of two main characters!!
Glory is by far (in my opinion) the best big bad ever! She's fantastically powerful, but at the same time really ditzy. She fits perfectly into the Buffy-verse: scary & funny, but believable all at the same time. This season also cements in Tara and Spike as scoobies. And it introduces Warren for the first time (who will figure largely into the plot of Season 6).
The highlights of the Season: Fool for Love (Spike's past), The Body (realistic look at death), Tough Love (first glimpse at Dark Willow), and The Gift (my favorite season finale & the death of another main character).
And as with all good things, there are some low points. Listening to Fear (alien is summoned to kill crazy people), and Family (Tara's creepy family arrive) aren't the best, but they're still better than most of what's on TV. Bad Buffy is a lot like bad pizza: even when it's bad, it's still pretty good! OK--corny, I know, but it makes a point! Also, I'm a huge Riley (Marc Blucas) fan, and was sad to see him go this season (he goes on to make a guest appearance in Season 6).
In conclusion, buy Buffy Season 5 on DVD!!! Buy several--buy them as holiday presents!! People will be glad you did!",1059436800,14,1714,4.735785953177258
1909189,5,B0000AQS18,"Wow! The one word I would use to describe this amazing season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. This season contains every bit of Joss Whedon's amazing writing, directing, and producing ability. Also, not just Joss, but every other person that helped in the making of it.
  This season saw the revival of Buffy's relationship with her mother just as she is thrown into the worst days of her life. We are introduced to Dawn,Buffy's sister; an often annoying but ultimately important character. Spike becomes more involved with the Scooby gang, not to mention Buffy. Xander and Anya's relationship develops further until Xander makes a life altering choice in ""The Gift"". And then there is Willow and Tara. What an amazing relationship. I was skeptical at first but their romance is only surpassed by that of Buffy's and Angel's.
  The season is filled with several great episodes but probably the 2 that stand out the most are ""The Body"", an amazing episode about loss and love, and ""The Gift"", which is probably one of the best finales in Buffy history, rivaled by the ""Becoming"" episodes. I would definitely reccomend this stellar season to anyone who wants to see TV at its very best.",1059350400,5,1181,4.8316831683168315
1909190,5,B0000AQS18,"in this season. It's top notch, and one of the more dark seasons. Like season 7. Some top notch episodes, well directed and one episode everyone seems to love except me. I just thought it as ordinary, not quite Buffy but it was alright. Here's a little breakdown:
 Buffy vs. Dracula: 10/10 Funny as hell.
 The Real Me: 9/10 Harmony comes back with minions, that's hilarious. With Tom Lenk(Andrew) as one of the minions.
 The Replacement: 9.5/10 Xander has 2 qualities, dumb and smart(believe it or not).
 Out of My Mind: 10/10 Spike tries to get his chip removed, again.
 No Place like Home: 9.5/10 Glory gets introduced, beats up Buffy.
 Family: 10/10 Tara is half demon, well that's what her family says anyway.
 Fool for Love: 10/10 Spike goes back to his I killed the slayers days.
 Shadow: 9.5/10 Glory gets a snake to seek out the slayer.
 Listening to Fear: 7.5/10 Worst episode in the season, extra-terrestrial demon comes and kills mental patients(re Joyce)
 Into the Woods: 10/10 Bye by Riley, Spike shows Buffy that Riley is getting bitten by vampires.
 Triangle: 10/10 Olaf the troll is in this dimension, and Anya is in horror. While Willow and Anya bicker, and Willow makes a bunch of sarcastic remarks, I never seen her funnier then in this one.
 Checkpoint: 9.5/10 Watcher's council is back! Which means another stupid test for Buffy.
 Blood Ties: 9/10 Dawn finds out Joyce doesn't want her, and heads out with the help of Spike, finds out she's just a key.
 Crush: 10/10 Drusila's back, with promises. Spike kills again.
 I was made To Love You: 9.5/10 Warren is introduced, he made a robot to love him.
 The Body: 8/10 This is the one I was talking about, it's too slow for me. And no music, which doesn't help. But it's well done and well directed so it still gets a good mark. And I'm not a big Joyce fan, she got irritating after a while. Mostly in seasons 1 & 2.
 Forever: 9/10 Angel takes a small visit, Dawn tries to bring back Joyce, with some help from Spike and the Doc(like really he's gonna help her?)
 Intervention: 9.5/10 Spike gets Warren to make a Buffybot for him. It gets really funny!
 Tough Love: 12/10 Glory uses her trick to suck the brain and make Tara go all crazy. Willow is mad, and gets to the dark magics.
 Spiral: 10/10 They flee from Glory and the soldiers who both want Dawn dead, well Glory wants to wait a while, soldiers want her dead now so Glory can't perform the ritual. Glory escapes with Dawn and kills the soldiers during the process.
 The Weight of the World: 9/10 Buffy is in shock that she let Dawn go and her mother's dead. Willow is forced to get her out of it.
 The Gift: 20/10 2nd best season finale of Buffy, Grave is number 1. Glory will open the portal using Dawn's blood, the only way to stop it, is to kill Dawn.
 It's a great season, definitely worth buying when it comes out, American/Canadian release will be December 9th.",1059264000,5,2894,4.491395793499044
1909191,5,B0000AQS18,"With Season Four of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Joss Whedon and his team of writers proved that the show could survive after graduating high school and moving into the big scary world of university. So with Season Five, the task was more to prove character development and ensure that all the cast members grew up and began living their lives like true adults. The effort and dedication is shown throughout ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Complete Fifth Season,"" which just gets better with each viewing.

Season Four's superb finale ""Restless"" left a lot of confusion about the show's future. Our heroes dreams had opened up many doors to future events, just when it seemed that everything that could be covered had been. In Season Five, Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and Willow (Alyson Hannigan) are still at UC Sunnydale, while Xander (Nicholas Brendon) still lives in his parent's basement, but soon gets his own pad. Giles (Anthony Stewart-Head) still lives in his apartment, while the addition of Tara (Amber Benson) and Riley (Marc Blucas) who first made their presence in Season Four are still present in Willow and Buffy's lives respectively. Spike (James Marsters) is still hanging around, lurking in the shadows, whilst Anya (Emma Caulfield) is still - rather surprisingly - the girlfriend of Xander. Everything seems normal and content - yet the addition of Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg) turns the lives of everyone on its head.

First appearing at the end of the episode ""Buffy Vs. Dracula"" and explored deeper in ""Real Me,"" Dawn is Buffy sister. Die-hard fans are left scratching their heads in confusion, but all is revealed three episodes later in ""No Place Like Home."" A group of monks in Sunnydale posess the power of transform living energy into any shape or form they see fit. They want to hide this magical energy (known only as ""The Key"") from a Hell beast known as Glory (Clare Kramer). They realise the Slayer will protect The Key, so they press it into the form of Dawn, and manipulate the Scooby Gang's minds into thinking that Dawn has always been Buffy's little sister. The first half of the season revolves around Buffy knowing the true nature of Dawn/The Key, and trying to keep it secret from everyone. As time goes on the Scoobies discover its nature and, finally, in ""Blood Ties,"" so does Dawn herself.

The remainder of the season shows Glory desperate to find The Key, with the clock ticking away. She finds what she's been looking for at the end of the episode ""Tough Love,"" when one of the Scoobies accidentally reveals the true nature of The Key. From there on, with three episodes of the season remaining, the Scoobies go on the run from Glory. ""Spiral"" sees Buffy and her friends trying to escape Glory's evil clutches. In ""The Weight Of The World,"" Dawn is taken by Glory and Buffy slips into a kind of coma, but she's back in the epic season finale, ""The Gift,"" in which the slayer confronts Glory and sacrifices Dawn's life and the world for her own. The ultimate cliff-hanger for the show's future.

Season Five is very much about family issues and emotional ties. Episodes such as ""Out Of Mind, Out Of Sight"" and ""Crush"" deal with Spike's new-found love of the slayer. He's obsessed with her, and she is repulsed - little does she know of how things will change in Season Six. The seemingly eternal love of Willow and Tara takes drastic turns in episodes such as ""Family"" and ""Tough Love."" Buffy also has to deal with her own troubles. Looking after her sick mother forces Riley away in ""Into The Woods."" They split, and he leaves Sunnydale for good - or so it seems. Buffy sick mother Joyce (Kristine Sutherland) has to deal with her brain tumour in episodes such as ""Shadow"" and ""Listening To Fear,"" before she finally - and suddenly - dies in the masterpiece episode ""The Body."" How this episode did not win a truckload of awards is beyond me. Truly emotional stuff, and the best look at a grieving family in television history. This is superbly followed up with the episode ""Forever,"" in which Buffy has to cope with Dawn's feelings of neglect when she tries to bring her dead mother back to life.

All this depression and heartache may make some believe that Season Five is a dark and serious season - it's not. For that you have to look at Season Six. Season Five does indeed have some wonderful and humorous episodes, such as ""The Replacement,"" ""Triangle,"" ""I Was Made To Love You"" and ""Intervention."" All wonderful episodes, superbly crafted by the common use of other-worldy beings as metaphors for human emotions.

Seasons Two, Three and Four all ended with marvellous and highly-praised classic finales in the form of ""Becoming - Part 2,"" ""Graduation Day - Part 2,"" and ""Restless."" The bar is set even higher for a better Season Five finale, and the expectations are easily met with ""The Gift."" The episode not only makes it special because it is the 100th episode, but because it deals with the biggest shock of the entire series - the death of the slayer.

With Season Five, the show has proved yet again that it is not just about vampire slaying, but people's emotions and attitudes towards growing up and living their lives.",1059177600,7,5180,4.755283648498332

1909193,5,B0000AQS18,"This release is making me the happiest man Alive!!!  I love the Fifth Season and it is coming out a month ahead of the original schedulings because the series is over.  I just hope that because the series is over, they will not stop giving us the wonderful extras, such as audio commentary on at least 6 episodes and the behind the scenes featurettes.
This season introduces Dawn, the Slayer's younger sister whom we have never met or heard reference to.  All of a sudden she shows up, and everybody has memories of her, even Angel.  This season's theme is that a slayer can never be fully prepared for what is happening and that even Buffy, the most extraordinary slayer, cannot fight everything.  All of the foreshadowing of past seasons are completed by the end of the season.  Season Three:  Faith: ""Little Miss Muffet counting down to 7-3-0""
where the 7-3-0 is 730 days, or exactly two years from then, and foreshadows that something major that Buffy is counting down to, or all slayers are counting down to, will happen in the season 5 Finale.  Season Four: Tara: ""Come back before dawn"" in Buffy's dream in the finale.
The first arc is mainly about Buffy and Riley, he can try all he wants, but he cannot be the strong man that Buffy needs.  He comes to the rescue and saves her once or twice, but he cannot compete with the evils in her life.  She draws him to the darker side of the world and he gets jealous when Dracula shows up and she goes into a type of trance when he sucks her blood.  Riley wanted to know that feeling so he goes to a demon house and gets his blood sucked by a vapiress.  Once again Joss Whedon show the metaphor of vampires sucking blood as... something not meant for little kids.  When he can't deal with it anymore and realizes that Buffy doesn't love him, he goes back to work with the Initiative in South America.  This ends the first arc.
The second arc starts with a powerful energy chasing after monks to get something back that they ""stole"".  Thus, Glory is introduced.  We find out more about Dawn and why we never heard mention of her before, and Willow's and tara's relationship is tried to the maximum.  I will not Spoil this any further.  If you are any kind of fan of Buffy, buy this DVD set, I will, and you will enjoy it.  My favorite season by far has got to be season Seven.",1059004800,,2326,4.37995337995338

I think I might have to watch the season again
I can't wait until Season 6 and 7 come out on DVD because they've ALWAYS been my favorite
The Gift is a great episode but episodes like No PLace Like Home  , Shadow , Triangle , Checkpoint and they just don't cut it
Other ones ( great ) that are < like Buffy V.S. Dracula , Real Me , The Replacement , Out of my Mind , and Fool For Love are great.
The Last couple episodes of season five are great too like Tough Love , IntevenTion , Spiral ... great , really good

1909195,5,B0000AQS18,"Buffy's fifth season has been called one of the best seasons of the show: it includes one of those rare and almost hypnotic episodes I love so much in TV (like in The X-Files episodes Milagro and all things, and in Buffy's fourth season: Restless), it is The Body. It also introduces Buffy's sister, Dawn, who appears in the end of the first episode of the season. I couldn't help but to feel stranged with her: Buffy has a sister? And this is the feeling the season moves around. How everything changes once Buffy discovers that Dawn is not really her sister, but an ancient ball of energy which is searched by a powerfull being called Glory: she needs this ball of energy called The Key to unlock the limits between dimensions, which will allow her to return to her dimension. During the season, everything moves around the realization of what wants Dawn, what does it want it for, and how can they stop that without killing Dawn.
The season begins with a somewhat regular episode... it is a shame because it was written by Marti Noxon. Buffy vs. Dracula says everything in its title, and the only really good thing about this one is that it has Buffy begining to wonder about her powers. It really came from the closure of season four, Restless. Where does the power of the slayer come from? The subsequent episodes elaborate around the other characters (in Real me, we get to know Dawn and we meet Harmony once again; in The Replacement the shows achieves to show Xander's growth without really destroying the character we've seen for four years; in Out of my mind Riley experiences the consequences of what the Initiative and Maggie Walsh did with his body). In episode 5: No place like home, takes place Buffy's discovery. She also faces Glory for the first time and learns that this villain is much more than a simple demon.
The following episodes keep taking the supporting characters further: in Family we get to see how much Tara has become a member of the scooby gang; in Fool for love (one of the best if not the best episode of the season) Spike's background is shown (and, very important, by the end of it Spike's careness for Buffy is beautifully achieved in a very moving scene where he is not able to kill Buffy when he has his chance, instead he comforts her).
Shadow and Listening to fear deal with Glory again, and with Joyce's illness. Into the woods turns the focus onto Riley once again, but in order to say goodbye to him. Triangle deals with the relationship Xander-Anya-Willow. How he is torn between the two of them.
Ckeckpoint and Bloodties return to the arc of the key. The council reappears to show to Buffy why is it that Glory is so powerfull, and then comes Dawn's discovery that she is the key.
Then comes Crush, another really great episode, where Spike's love for Buffy comes out. Also, one of the best characters of the series returns: Drusila. Harmony reappears as well, so Spike's three women are together for him to choose between, but in the end he realizes he only wants Buffy.
In I was made to love you the series introduces Warren (very important character in the sixth season), a nerd who makes a robot to please him. The best thing of this episode is the schocking closing scene. Then comes The Body: Joyce is dead... and the whole episode is that fact in the mind of the characters. Intervention is another great episode: Spike forces Warren to make him a Buffy robot that can please him.
As the end approaches Glory and the cruzades surround Buffy. Finally Glory gets Dawn and has a bunch mad men making a tower, where the final battle in The Gift takes place.
Here is my top 10 for Buffy's fifth season:
10. Tough love (Buffy learns that Dawn can be taken away from her... and Tara is taken away from Willow).
9. Real Me
8. The replacement (Xander is hit by a demon's ray and suddenly, there are two Xanders: is the one around his friends a demon?)
7. Checkpoint (the council informs Buffy about the key and Glory).
6. The Gift (it is the final battle and Buffy has to sacrifice something to save the world. will it be her sister?
5. Intervention (While Buffy learns in the desert that death is her gift, Spike entertains himself with the Buffy-bot... but they are seen by Xander and Anya).
4. Into the woods (Buffy's discovers Riley's darkest secret: he likes to get bitten by female vampires).
3. Crush
2. Fool for love (we get to see how Spike killed two slayers!)
1. The Body.",1059004800,10,4429,4.5305867665418225

Dawn; Spike's love of Buffy; The Best truly unstoppable villian
Glory, and an answer about Tara held over from Season 4. This
season also introduces Warren, and Willow using too much magic, which both will play heavily in Season 6. Best of all, an episode called ""The Body"" that BTVS, and Sarah should have got
Emmys for. ""The Body"" being the most real, and dramatic episode of BTVS ever made, and it was fueled by Sarah Michelle Gellar that reached a new depth in Buffy we'd hadn't seen and never saw again.",1059004800,,571,4.5
1909197,5,B0000AQS18,"Buffy the Vampire Slayer is an amazing show and this season is, in my opinon, its finest season. The introduction of Dawn is brilliant and keeps the audience guessing until her presence is explained. It's so well written that I overlooked how annoying her character was and remained until the series' conclusion.
It's fun to watch the characters continue on their journeys. The relationships develope more. Riley gets stupid and then goes to do some stupid military thing... I don't really know what he went to do, but he was gone and that was good enough for me. Tara and Willow get ""all snuggly"" as Willow would probably describe it, and Xander and Anya go on with their foolishness.
The two best things about this season, however are Spike and the season's villain, Glory. Glory came off as being so much more threatening than Adam, last season's villain ever could, and when she was around, there was always the feeling that she really could defeat Buffy and defeat her easily.
And Spike! Oh, we were all so desperate for him to stop wanting to kill the Scooby gang and join them out of the evilness of his heart. Fortunately, he fell in love with Buffy, just as 75% of the male characters in the show tend to do. What made Spike's love for Buffy so great was that he didn't stand a chance with her. Still, we all routed for him because, well... because he's Spike.
The death of Joyce Summers was a shock and it gave Joss Whedon a chance to make an incredible and truly authentic episode in which Buffy and the rest of them dealt with the news of her death. Anyone who has ever lost a loved one could relate to it. It was one of the few examples in Buffy where a life altering event was presented not as a metaphor but as the event itself.
Good stuff. Buy this you fools!

1909198,4,B0000AQS18,"When Buffy's younger sister, Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg), showed up early in this season, it sent fans crying out that its creator, Joss Whedon, was breaking the artistic consistency of the show.
Being Joss Whedon, however, he of course had an explanation for this sudden appearance of the character.
It was only semi-plausible.
Season 5 had a slightly over-the-top feel to it in general, starting out with the excellently written ""Buffy VS Dracula"" and quickly introducing a younger sister to the show's lead, a character viewers had never heard of before (except for a bit of foreshadowing in a couple of notable dream sequences in previous seasons).
The writers kept introducing new elements to the plotline, and  ended up with a bunch of complex and occasionally clunky plot devices all merging together into a fairly cohesive whole.
Some despised the lead villain, ""Glory"", or ""Glorificus"" (Clare Kramer), a god from a demon dimension hell-bent on getting back to her home and destroying everything in her path.  But others enjoyed her quirky, Cordelia-like ditziness and glamourous-to-gaudy fashion sense.  In the end, she was an interesting character, a very torn personality, but Kramer's portrayal was, on occasion, lacking.
Though it had flaws, this season contains two of the most memorable episodes in the history of Buffy the Vampire Slayer: ""The Body"" and ""The Gift"".
The former is perhaps the most honest look at grief over the loss of a loved one ever portrayed on television, and the total lack of a musical score only serves to punctuate the overwhelming reality of the themes of the episode.  It is also one of the best and most honestly acted episodes ever produced for the show, and many fans rate it very highly on their list of favorites.
The latter was written with the intent of serving as a series finale, if the show was cancelled and not picked up by another network (UPN eventually grabbed two more seasons of it).  Its climax brought tears to the eyes of the several million viewers watching across the nation.  It remains consistently considered one of best episodes of the series.
Despite its over-the-top nature and somewhat muddled plotline, as well as other niggling concerns, Season 5 remains one of the best of Buffy, and thus one of the best of television.  It's easily worth any fan's money.  Just don't go in expecting a Season 2-3 level of quality.",1058918400,3,2390,4.9575
1909199,5,B0000AQS18,"Season 5 was an excellent season in the Buffy-verse. Though many give it [a bad time]because Glory was not one of the scarier Big Bads, the overall story is incredible. Joss Whedon showed us his powerful skill as an artist with two stand out episodes, The Body and The Gift. I'm extremely happy that this amazing season that asks the question ""What is a slayer?"" is finally making its way to dvd. I look forward to watching it over and over again.",1058918400,,447,4.463414634146342
1909200,5,B0000AQS18,"Buffy tVS season 5 is the most gripping, thoughtful, and exciting season of the show's seven season run.  While many shows would have burned out by the fifth year of storytelling, ""Buffy"" picks up the peices of a controversial and alternative season 4 (which stands on its own merits as well) and heads into mythic territory with season five.
Many storylines which had been building for numerous seasons come to a climax in ""Buffy""'s fifth year -- we are finally introduced to Dawn, the sister whom had been hinted at since late season 3; Riley's ""Captain America"" image is marred in a move that I thought was beneficial for the character and the actor, Marc Blucas; Spike's heroic redemption finds its roots in this season as well.
However, Buffy has always been about metaphor, and it is this aspect of season 5 which puts it at the top of its game.  The theme of season 5 seemed to be ""family,"" and serious issues of adoption, parenting, mental illness, and familial ties are explored.  Glory (played by the catty, ferocious, and superb Clare Kramer) and her search for the Key juxtaposed against Buffy's (and eventually Joyce's as well) internal quest to accept Dawn into their family speaks of birth paternity issues, adoption consequences, and what truly makes up a family.  Likewise, Joyce's battle with mental illness due to shocking health problems was new, disturbingly realistic territory for a show where monsters and magicks hurt people, not disease.
""The Body,"" episode 16, is quite possibly the most beautiful and heartbreaking episode of television aired to date.  Nothing else can be said without giving away major plot points, but nevertheless this will always stand out for me as one of the best writing and directorial achievements on the small screen.
Other stand-out episodes in season 5 are ""No Place Like Home,"" in which Buffy questions who her own sister is; ""Fool for Love,"" where Buffy goes to Spike and begins what will become a quest for knowledge of the Slayers' past which had far-reaching consequences into season 7; ""Checkpoint,"" in which the Watcher's Council offers devastating information on Glory; ""Blood Ties,"" where Dawn struggles to come to terms with who (and what) she is; ""Forever,"" the emotional follow-up to ""The Body;"" and the incredible four-part conclusion consisting of ""Tough Love"", ""Spiral"", ""The Weight of the World,"" and ""The Gift.""
Season 5 tied up loose ends to the series which had been dangling for a number of years and concluded with a finale which would effect the entire course of the rest of the show's run.  Not until the end of season 6 does Buffy and Co. finally pick up the peices of all the monumental events of season 5.  Season 5 is ""Buffy"" at its best -- funny, thought-provoking, harsh, sad.  If there was ever a block of 22 episodes of the series to own, it would be these.",1058918400,9,2845,4.839506172839506
1909201,5,B0000AQS18,"This is it! This is the ABSOLUTE BEST SEASON of Buffy, the Vampire Slayer there is.  Season 5 was like a climax to the show, the height of the entire series, the concepts and emotions conveyed were so excellent on so many levels.
Season 5 introduced a brand new character, Dawn Summers played by the talented Michelle Trachtenberg, who would play Buffy's kid sister but was so much more than that. In the early season Buffy discovers Dawn is a Key who never really existed and they've all been implanted with memories with her existing which to this day are still intact. Later on she discovers The Key will open a portal to all the different hell dimensions and the god Glory (Played by Clare Kramer) wants it to get back to her own hell dimension so she can become an actual god again.
This season also deals with family on a tremendous level. Early on their mother Joyce (Played by the amazing Kristine Sutherland) gets sick and discovers she has a brain tumor. Some pretty talented acting comes through from Sarah Michelle Gellar and Michelle Trachtenberg especially in the episode ""The Body."" Through it Dawn and Buffy try to stick together and at the end of the season Buffy ultimately gives herself up to save her sister and the world, again in the amazing season finale, ""The Gift.""
This season also has some very lighthearted episodes ... as ""The Replacement,"" ""Intervention,"" and ""I Was Made to Love You."" Overall though I come back to this one fact, this season had the best episodes, the best concepts, and the best ideas that will blow anyone away.  If you don't get any other season of Buffy get this one. I don't know what the special features are yet but the episodes alone are definitely worth the buy. I'll keep you posted as soon as I see a list though. Get this set when it's released in December. Of course I'm not waiting until Christmas day to get it as a present, I'm buying it the day it's released, this season rocks that much!",1058918400,8,1953,4.545454545454546
1909202,5,B0000AQS18,"I'm a huge fan of this show and have watched it since the very first episode aired and in my opinion season five of Buffy is the best season of the series. As a whole, the show has had a lot of fine moments and many of them have been in season five. This is the season where Dawn is introduced as Buffy's sister, Riley leaves, Glory is the Big Bad (one of my fav's) and Spike falls in love with Buffy. The scoobie gang experiences a lot of loss in this emotional and heartbreaking season,(episodes The Body and The Gift, trust me have a box of kleenex by your side for these episodes). The episodes in this very powerful season are:
1. Buffy .vs. Dracula: 9.5/10
2. Real Me: 9.5/10 (Harmony is back)
3. The Replacement: 9/10
4. Out of My Mind: 8/10

7997820,5,B0000AQS18,"BTVS grows up in Season 5.  Though Dawn and Riley do compete for most annoying catalyst character, this season is worth the price of admission because Buffy begins to emerge as a woman from her hot chick chrysalis.  This season is also the first where we truly begin to explore Spike, easily one of the most interesting and complex characters of the series. There's plenty sexiness, bitchin knock-down-drag-outs, heart tugs aplenty, and a box of tissues at the climax.  Season 5 is a satisfying and entertaining foreword to the upcoming shenanigans of Season 6 and the denouement of Season 7.  Worth it.",1515024000,,603,4.882352941176471
