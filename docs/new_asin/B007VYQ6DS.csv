5111879,4,B007VYQ6DS,"This review is based on the Instant View version of the film. . I don't know if it differs from the DVD sets which are available for purchase.

Please note that  I DO give away some of the plot details, although this info is also included in nearly every advertisement or trailer for the film. If you haven't seen those, you may not want to read the rest of this review but I think those with young children might want to have enough information to decide if their children are ready for the film.

Before getting into the basics of this movie, I do want to note that it is probably best suited for older children since it does have some sections that could be frightening to younger ones, including the death of a baby chimp's mother (although this is not shown but rather narrated by Tim Allen).

 There are also other events which involve violence, including attacks by rival groups of chimpanzees, but - as with the death of the mother chimp - most of the details are left to the imagination. Still, I certainly wouldn't take a young child to this movie. Just my take.

Shown in documentary form, this is the tale of a very young - and adorable - baby chimp named Oscar. The earlier parts of the movie revolve around Oscar's close bond with Isha, his mother. Both kids and adults who watched this with me found the early scenes to the slower part of the film. As one kid put it "" There is too much talking"" and I have to agree that the narration could have been edited for better impact.

 Still, there was plenty of interesting info about how chimps use tools to open fruit and poke sticks in old branches on the ground to find termites and other bugs. Scenes of baby chimps playing - or pretend fighting - with each other brought smiles to our faces.

It takes awhile before the crucial event in this movie occurs....and Oscar's mother dies. This info has been broadly advertised in the promos for this movie but I'll leave out more explicit descriptions here. Young children probably couldn't handle even the narration of these events. I have to admit that I found it difficult to watch Oscar's mournful search for his mother and the challenges he faced without her.

In true Disney form, there is a nice abd comforting resolution - and one that is likely to surprise and amaze viewers. I certainly wouldn't have predicted it.

There is also a bonus bit at the end of the film which reveals how the film was made and some of the humorous as well as frustrating experiences faced by the documentary's creators. I do wish there had been some different and more engaging music throughout the film, similar to that used during the ending scenes.

If you are the sort who detests movies or books where chimpanzees or other creatures are given human names and their feelings are described, you will probably want to avoid the film. After all, who really knows the exact details of another's mind, including human minds? But naming the baby chimp Oscar as well as imagining his possible feelings may make the film more accessible to children and perhaps help spur a lasting enthusiasm for nature. I can certainly see the advantage of this, even though I am ambivalent about it. However, the movie does have the blessing of noted chimpanzee expert Jane Goodall and part of the proceeds from the opening week went to the Jane Goodall Institute, designated to help protect chimpanzees and their habitats.

After watching the film, perhaps viewers will also consider how they might help ensure the future of chimpanzees.",1345507200,33,3516,4.6064
5111880,3,B007VYQ6DS,"We took our kids to go see this movie at the dollar theater on a rainy day during family camping. Thought the trailers looked good so we gave it a shot instead of a cartoon movie.  The kids really enjoyed watching the story of the chimpanzees. Even the 3 year old was able to talk about the movie afterward. Do be aware though, that this is a documentary movie with only narration, no scripted dialogue and no people in the movie.",1345507200,3,430,4.308641975308642
5111881,1,B007VYQ6DS,"Shame,Shame,Shame no I,am not speaking of the song from the seventies but a harsh slap on the face for Disney Pictures. Disney known for the grander and love of its family movies Like Snow White,Cinderella,Jungle Book and others should be ashame that Walt Disney is rolling in his grave. This film aimed at children is a digrace in that it shows canabilism when the Chimpanzee eat other smaller monkeys. When we saw this film in theaters and this scene occured I removed myself and my neice and nephew from the theater, and promised myself I would not ever return to see another Disney nature film in theaters or on home video. My advise to you as a parent that might want to show the good side of nature and not the bad would be to avoid buying this disney feature Chimps and maybe by not buying this and others that show such damaging material for children Disney will get the hint and not forget the roots that they came from which they apparently have forgotten.
AVOID THIS DVD OR BLU RAY AND BUY ANOTHER NICE DISNEY FILM..........................................................",1345334400,5,1083,4.7967914438502675
5111882,5,B007VYQ6DS,"While I did not see this movie in the theater, I knew that I would see it as my youngest daughter is obsessed with monkeys. I have seen other Disney Nature films and have continually been impressed with the quality of the film but also the quality of the story as the director and all others involved always do such a great job at telling the overall story itself that you are drawn in and do not want to leave until the movie is over. They have done it again in this film as you see the amazing tale of Oscar. This was a heart-warming tale that you will not want to miss, and not only is it entertaining, but it is educational as well. Tim Allen does a great job at narrating the story, and you will be amazed that the Disney Nature crew were able to capture the amazing journey of this chimpanzee, I know that I was!",1344643200,2,818,4.11875
5111883,4,B007VYQ6DS,"One of the best movies I've seen the last 5 years. Beautifully done. It has raised the bar on movies about the animal kingdom.  I think this is the movie to measure all others. Its that good.

I deducted a star because of Disney forcing me into getting into Blu-ray. No, thank you very much, I can make my own mind about it. We are living in a recession, I am not buying all my favorite movies all over again to help you meet your financial goals this quarter. Why did I have to pay an extra $10 to get a blu-ray I wll not play and don't want to play? Unfair, as the DVD is a must.",1343347200,5,581,3.9152542372881354
5111884,4,B007VYQ6DS,"This is another in a series of Disney Nature films, this one focusing on chimpanzees. Specifically, a youngster named Oscar who sees his extended family fend off competitors, while he tries to learn the ways of the jungle. This is the usual kid-friendly fare that adults will also find entertaining that Disney has released each of the last few years at this time. They are able to find a storyline while filming these wild creatures, and also capture some amazing footage while doing it. The narration provides a few light moments, and it is amazing how these wild animals are so similar to humans in their efforts to raise their young and to protect territory. Educational and entertaining, this is a good movie to see with the kids.",1340841600,3,735,4.75
5111885,4,B007VYQ6DS,"Of course I had to see this right away. Besides the splendor of seeing chimps in the wild on the big screen, it tells a stunning real-life story of courage and kindness in our primate cousins. Occasional use of time-lapse photography works well to emphasize the aliveness of the jungle. The narration by Tim Allen is hit and miss. It tells the story and is funny in places, but it doesn't let us sit back and realize anything for ourselves. It also often weirdly and distractingly refers to chimps as ""men,"" ""girls,"" and ""boys"" and makes a jarringly gratuitous reference to Home Improvement.",1340668800,,591,4.747572815533981
5111886,5,B007VYQ6DS,"Just got back from seeing ""Chimpanzee"" with my girlfriend and our two young boys. They loved it, and so did I. The first viewing in a long while that received a standing O. I cannot wait till the Blu-Ray transfer.

This is the story(narrated by Tim Allen, ""Toy Story"", ""Home Improvement"")of a newly born chimp named Oscar. We watch him grow up with his Mother and the other Chimps among the clan. Freddy, the Grandfather-leader is my favorite.
You cannot watch this without thinking of how unbelievably human they are. Look at their eyes, their communication and feelings; its all on caught on film and wonderfully done. I loved the footage of their tool and decision making, so, so human. Though the story of Oscar is its focus, other stories such as Scar and his clan who are at a territorial war over food sources and the communication and the execution of hunting their prey is genius.
Wonderfully told by Tim Allen as he takes us through the story of the chimps with his comedic style.
My kids loved it and so did I. Its nice to watch something real and educational for a change, making this a perfect family film.
Short film but very sweet and well worth it.",1334966400,54,1164,4.542857142857143

5111888,3,B007VYQ6DS,"A highly questionable documentary considering they anthropomorphized the characters giving them names and supposed personalities.  Oscar was actually portrayed by several different chimpanzees during the course of this film.  His life was fabricated by the filmmakers to suit their storyline.
It is beautifully filmed, that is undeniable.  Although many of the scenes become repetitive (how many times during the course of this movie did they need to show how the chimpanzees cracked nuts).  The narration is also cloyingly sweet, filled with colloquiums and jokes.  At one point the chimpanzees hunt, kill, and eat a monkey..........to which Tim Allen says, don't forget the side salad.  Yum-yum.
To fill in when nothing is happening, they resorted to several scenes involving time-lapse photography, the most interesting of which involved a spider spinning a web.
Not as involved as one would hope.  No attempt to explain anything (this was definitely not a teaching moment).  They did everything but put them in funny outfits and force them to perform tricks.

A disheartening look at Chimpanzees, Disney style.",1479081600,,1114,5.430232558139535

They got to see cute chimpanzees while reinforcing what they had learned about chimp behavior. It shows them using tools, caring for each other, and going to war. It was well edited, providing excitement and tension without too much detail. The story is also extremely heart-warming. I previewed it to make sure it would be alright for my students (even though it is rated G, I wanted to be sure it wasn't too intense). I had my teenage sons watch it with me. They tried to come up with an excuse, at first, but became completely engrossed within minutes. I watched it 3 times in 2 days!",1465084800,2,764,4.583941605839416

5111923,1,B007VYQ6DS,"For reference, I'm a GenXer who grew up reading National Geographic and watching nature documentaries on Discovery Channel, usually with some awesome British guy narrating (most likely Sir David Attenborough).  Excellent stuff.  That said...

This is my first and final DisneyNature film, purchased for my children aged 9 and under.

From the cliched over-personification of the animals (""Isha couldn't be happier with her new baby boy,"" as she's zoned out munching on leaves), to the missed opportunities for complete information (""Oscar will rely on his mother's milk for quite some time,"" really, HOW LONG do these primates nurse?  And why did the scriptwriters feel the need to downplay the perfect food for mammalian offspring, i.e., ""He'll just have to settle for mother's milk....""?), and the cheesy drama (""Scar and his thugs have returned...""), I just cannot recommend this video to anyone.

It is a documentary.  Or, rather, it was supposed to be.  I was expecting loads of information.  What I received was a protagonist vs villain story with a happy ending.  Like Bambi.  Except in Chimpanzee, the villains are other chimps, ""cleverly"" given non-human names like ""Scar"" (channeling Lion King?  Well, I guess we're in Africa for this movie too, so why not?), while the ""nice"" chimps are given human names like Oscar, Freddy, Rufus, and Grandpa.  The only jewel of info is that female chimps apparently do not adopt orphaned youngsters within their own family group.

My next purchases will be BBC's Planet Earth, Blue Planet, HumanPlanet, etc.  Disney is great for other things (loooooove the animated flicks and the new live-action Cinderella, not to mention the pure awesomeness that is Disneyland), but I'll stick with BBC for educational materials.",1443052800,,1763,5.224199288256227

5111988,1,B007VYQ6DS,"The trailer for this film was exceptional, but the actual movie fell short. Tim Allen was the narrator, and he over-dramatized the script. James Earl Jones, who has done many documentaries, would have been a wiser choice. The soundtrack is annoying also. Boring and not worth the time. Glad I only borrowed a copy from the library and didn't waste my money.",1419033600,,357,4.774193548387097

5112002,5,B007VYQ6DS,What an entertaining movie! The scenery is beautiful! Music is also great! My only caution is there is a scene where the chimpanzees trap and kill a smaller monkey of a different kind. Not graphic but does show a brief clip of them eating a part of it.,1412812800,,252,4.270833333333333

5112017,5,B007VYQ6DS,I purchased this movie/documentary of Chimpanzees to help keep my grandson occupied while on a flight across the country.  He doesn't care to watch tv but a film of animals captures his attention.  This one is his fall back show.  His all time favorite.  I also get to feel good about what he is spending his time watching.  Well put together and the narration is humorous.,1405296000,,373,4.590909090909091

5112019,5,B007VYQ6DS,"I cried twice while watching this film. Once for something incredibly heartbreaking (yes, it is that sad), and once for something so beautiful I still tear up thinking of it. (There is also something else a little unsettling but I was prepared for it as I know quite a bit about chimps.) I think really young or sensitve kids should avoid this one. As someone who loves learning everything about nonhuman great apes, I think they did a fabulous job with this film. It sure does make you want to save the species. I hope Disneynature does films of the other nonhuman great apes too.",1403827200,,581,4.542857142857143

It is an excellent movie to watch.  I sincerely think that it should be added to you video library.",1402963200,,299,3.8360655737704916

5112029,5,B007VYQ6DS,"Excellent documentation.  Cheers to the photographers who took the time and lived in the environment of these amazing creatures while filming.  It sure couldn't have been easy but most definitley worth it.  This film isn't just for animal lovers, it's for all kind and all ages.  To give you an idea....... it follows the life of a group of chimpanzees with a little baby named Oscar being the main character.  It charts their every day life and the good times and bad times they must deal with.  You will fall in love with Oscar and be amazed by their similarities to humans concerning family ties.  Enjoy.

5112033,5,B007VYQ6DS,"All I can say is ""awwwwwwwwwwwwwwww."" We could learn a lesson from animals. This story is one of acceptance of a young, orphaned chimp. It's extraordinary because the acceptance is from one who, if he were human, could throw his hands up and say ""Sorry kid. You're not my responsibility."" Just watch and see. Then see what lessons from this story you can apply on your own life to change the course of another.",1400457600,,410,4.554054054054054

If you own a HDTV renting this in HD is a must!  We were rather amazed at the quality of video/audio considering we streamed the title on WiFi and used an adapter ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007B6YPAM/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 ) to view on our TV.

5112038,5,B007VYQ6DS,"I was 77, when I saw this movie.  I went to the movie, and there were so many kids, there, I thought it would be too noisy to hear anything.  During the whole movie, you could hear a pin drop, for a theater full of little kids, it was so quiet.  A marvelous movie, I enjoyed it a lot.  It is such a moving, and learning movie",1399161600,,325,3.8059701492537314

5112042,5,B007VYQ6DS,"This is such a good movie. Although I know that there's a circle of life in the jungle, actually seeing a baby Chimp lose his mother was heartbreaking.

5112063,4,B007VYQ6DS,The shipping was fast.  I have not had a chance to watch it yet.  Packaging  was great.  Would buy it again.  Someday I'll get a chance to watch the movie.,1380499200,,155,4.033333333333333
5112064,4,B007VYQ6DS,"Some of my thoughts, after seeing this film multiple times, and reading many of the critical reviews here on Amazon:

It took four years to make this film.  It isn't easy to follow wild chimps through dense and remote rain forest, nor is it an easy matter to acquire good, clear footage without getting too close.  I readily admit I wish some things had been done differently in the making of 'Chimpanzee'.  (Things like the narration script and some of the editing.)  That said, it contains some of the best play, grooming, and tool usage footage to be found anywhere.  The footage of well coordinated hunting is amazing, impressive, and not something often seen at length in most great ape documentaries.

The single most important accomplishment of this film, in my opinion, is that it is impossible for any thinking individual to come away from seeing without realizing that chimps are extremely intelligent with complex social structure.  Their DNA is 98.6% identical to our own - no wonder they seem so very 'human' at times....And that includes the good, the bad, and the ugly...You know, things like rejecting a young beggar because you have your own kids to feed, making war over turf and resources, strong family bonds, the joy of play, and the politics of power. If, like reviewer 'Scott', you are offended by your young relatives seeing reality, if hunting for meat offends you, then you would be well served to go rent ""Lion Kink' instead.

Those critical of the story line should perhaps keep in mind that while adoption of orphans (or the infants of inept or negligent mothers) is not unheard of among chimpanzees. It is also true infant mortality among chimpanzees is significant, especially when a mother is killed, injured, or ill.  One thing not mentioned, which I believe should have been, is that 'Freddie' and 'Oscar' are more than likely close blood relatives.  Even at that, a male chimp adopting/fostering is definitely NOT the norm, let alone a reigning alpha doing so. That alone makes this a rather remarkable film. Something that is brought out in the 'making of' featurette is that Oscar being orphaned was unexpected, and until the alpha male adopted him, the future of the film was in question.",1380240000,3,2226,4.862433862433862
5112065,5,B007VYQ6DS,"Last year I took my Nephew to see this and I was blown away by the lose of our precious jungles.  Little Oscar was so funny but yet the movie struck a cord with my heart.  Oscar was left alone and what follows next was so surprising.  Jane Goodall is and always will be an inspiration for wildlife.  Her work with the Chimpanzee's is incredible and Disney came through once again with a movie that will leave you on the edge of your seat, making you laugh, smile, cry.  Once again, please either buy or rent it.  You will not be disappointed.",1379721600,,542,4.264705882352941

5112069,3,B007VYQ6DS,"Thankfully we screened this before showing my 4-year old.  This is a typical Disney movie, with villains and dead mothers.  Yes it's a documentary, but even in nature, Disney found a way to craft a story line with good guys fighting bad guys, death and orphaned children. One group of chimps is a ""gang of thugs"" and the other is full of good guys. Hard to tell it was a documentary and not a cartoon the way it was narrated.

**SPOILER**

It's put together like a kids movie, but soon, the chimp mother dies and the baby is left all alone, starving, searching for a new mother.  All's well that ends well as is always the case, but I can only imagine the dreams my kid would have after a movie in which the mother dies, there's no father and the baby is left to starve... This isn't really a documentary, it's a Disney movie made by editing footage of chimps.",1378252800,3,860,4.316770186335404

Tim did an ok job, but sometimes I couldn't forget it was Tim and get lost in the narration.  Kind of like when an actor is bigger than the part or the movie.  You see the actor and not the character.  Plus, having either Jane or Eugene would have been a great opportunity to learn more about the species.

Luckily, Oscar finds with way, with a little help from a friend. I am so happy that the movie ended on a postive note and not a downer. I've never went through so many emotions within one movie.

When placed in Disney's hands, however, it became a caricature of a nature film. The poor music choices, awful writing and Tim Allen's hammy voice work really wrecked it for me and my family. I'm tempted to replace the film's audio track with some classical music to see if that solves it.

5112143,5,B007VYQ6DS,I had been wanting to see this for some time. I found it to be interesting and wonderfully done. Oscar is just adorable and it is so amazing they were able to get all this footage. Tim Allen was a great narrator too.,1358121600,,216,4.046511627906977
5112144,5,B007VYQ6DS,What a great film. The younger viewers (kids) will really enjoy the antics and parents can use some of the lessons on caring and group dynamics. Be warned that there are some scenes that portray the darker aspects of life....but they are not presented in graphic detail like most modern documentaries. Just a great family movie.,1358035200,,328,4.875

5112147,3,B007VYQ6DS,"A young chimpanzee named Oscar is raised by his loving mother, Isha, in a large, extended family.  Living at the edge of their territory is an aggressive chimp tribe that wants to take over their fruit trees.

The photography is very enjoyable but Tim Allen was a poor choice for narrator with his tool references and grunting. His voice is too casual and low-brow and Morgan Freeman would have been a much better choice. The soap opera storyline was overdone.  In most cases, it seemed the animals were photographed randomly and the scenes were later made to fit a contrived plot.  For example, there is much drama about a big battle between the two chimp bands, but all we see is animals running quickly through the forest; there is no actual contact.

Definitely not up to Disney standards.",1357603200,,793,4.717391304347826

5112160,5,B007VYQ6DS,I really enjoyed this movie and adored Oscar the heart stealing chimp. It was not an action packed movie nor was it full of plot. It was just a movie about chimps and their ordeal to live. I actually even learned a thing or two about chimps while watching it. Families would like this movie.,1356566400,,291,4.3090909090909095
5112161,5,B007VYQ6DS,I have wanted to see this from the moment I saw the first preview. It was as amazing as I expected. The story will touch your heart and you will see so many similarities between the behavior of the chimps and our own human behavior. Great to watch with kids as the violence of their lives is censored for the most part.,1356480000,,319,4.161290322580645
5112162,3,B007VYQ6DS,"I've loved the Disneynature movies from the beginning. Earth, Oceans, and African Cats were outstanding. Chimpanzee falls short of their legacy.

The previous three movies had a soundtrack and a narrator that brought out the wonder in the incredible wildlife footage portrayed. This one had Tim Allen and a couple of goofy songs. It was distracting and annoying. I like Tim Allen, I really do, but I couldn't listen to him without hearing Tim the Tool Man Taylor in every single line. Who wants to play ""one of these things is not like the other"" for an hour and twenty minutes? Having no narrator at all would have been stronger than this.

The pacing also felt rushed. African Cats also spanned a long period of time, giving us the opportunity to watch Mara and the cheetah cubs grow up under their mothers' care (or partially without her, in Mara's case). They did it well, managing time and manipulating scenery to help clue the viewer into significant time changes, making transitions feel seamless. Chimpanzee relied on such tactics as ""3 years later,"" which showed the seams.

That said, the chimps were given a well-rounded portrayal, the footage really was incredible, and the story was heartwarming. I couldn't give it less than three stars. I only wish it had steered less toward the cheap comedy and more toward the natural wonder of these creatures. They have great personalities; they don't need crutches like power-tool humor. Ultimately, I'm glad I have it to complete my Disneynature collection, but it's just not as good as the others.",1356480000,2,1553,4.897338403041825

5112167,5,B007VYQ6DS,"The whole family really enjoyed this heartwarming movie. This movie is like a rollercoaster it makes you happy, sad, and worried all for a little chimp you have never seen tell now, but you will completely fall in love with him from the start. He goes through alot so early in his life.

It is amazing to be able to watch these chimps in the wild, and how much they care for each other. It is really something to see how smart they are.

My one gripe about this movie would have to be Tim Allen's narration. He just didn't do that great of a job, some of his jokes, if you want to call then that, just fell flat, and kind of interrupted the story.

Overall though you have to see this movie! You are guaranteed to fall in love with it and watch it more than once.",1356048000,,763,4.10738255033557

5112169,5,B007VYQ6DS,I was also reading a book on technology and human evolution at the time.  The movie really helped me imagine our own history and the origins of our own culture that are readily evident when you observe nature.  Technology may have changed us as we diverged from the common ancestor with chimps but you can still recognize our common heritage.,1355961600,,342,4.683333333333334

5112171,5,B007VYQ6DS,"I was expecting a cute story about Chimpanzees in their habitat.

What I wasn't prepared for was the grand scale of the truly flawless visual presentation, not only of this vast and inaccessible habitat, but the close ups of the main characters themselves.

There are several amazing and technically flawless segments involving time lapsed sequences of plants emerging and growing to demonstrate the passing of time.  Those segments alone are worth the film finding it's place in a nature lover's collection.

I did read some of the reviews from those who were stunned by the graphic aspects of ape behavior depicted in this film.  These segments were flawlessly sequenced to demonstrate social order and tactics that demonstrate extraordinary ape survival tactics.  They did not overly glorify the killings, but rather presented it as a part of their collective survival or failure to do so.  The director did not avoid, nor celebrate the perceived violence of natural survival.

As a photographer, nature and animal lover... I was absolutely thrilled with the quality of this natural adventure as presented in full blown panoramic clearer than clear blu-ray feature.

The story line lifts you up, drops you to the very bottom and picks you up again for a grand finish... a collective master work in my nature loving opinion.

THRILLED to own it and happily recommend it to those who want a dramatic visit to a part of the world most of us will never see.  The world's populations struggle over resources, as to these chimpanzees.",1355788800,,1531,5.011857707509882

You'll be able to validate that humans lean to war with one another as much as we love and care for one another.  More disturbing, we use our intelligence to kill and eat meat.  Extra research indicates that the breed of monkeys preyed upon by chimps are in danger of extinction.  Genocide!  This innocent Disney romp through nature becomes a horror film.  A must see!",1354924800,,470,4.458823529411765
5112180,2,B007VYQ6DS,"National Geographic films were a staple in my house as a child.  I belonged to that monthly program where a new one was shipped to my house regularly and I indulged in whatever wildlife adventure was laid before me for that month.  I ate them up and loved every second of it.  When `Chimpanzee' was released I was excited.  My wife was excited.  My kids were excited.

I was disappointed.

My problem with `Chimpanzee' is that, at the end of the day, it all feels so pointless.  The story concocted by the producers to make this more `compelling' is just not that captivating and at times becomes a burden on the film itself.  Creating a story with cartoonish names (Scar) and making them a pivotal role in the film took away from what could have been something truly beautiful.  Instead, it all felt so forced and unnecessary.  Yes, the story involving little Oscar is sweet (tragic in parts and heartwarming in others) but by the time the film was finished I found myself wishing it had been more straightforward and less intent on trying so hard to make this a `story'.  It really defeats the whole purpose of watching these animals in their natural environment.  Instead, you have a rather contrived `plot' laid out by Tim Allen in a way that is stiff, unnatural and awkward in parts.

They just tried WAY TOO HARD.

The cinematography is nice, but the overall effect is uninspired, clichd and sadly forgettable.",1354752000,10,1416,4.653225806451613

For all the hard work and the horrors of the bugs and sticky stuff on equipment, the heat and the hard-going, they were rewarded with a documentary which actually has a storyline worthy of a novel.  As we nature film watchers all know, most documentaries are ""slice of life"" where nothing coherent happens and the filmmakers try to splice together a coherent story of group or family survival or a threat from poachers or SOMETHING to hang the footage on.

This one is not contrived at all but a straight out gripping story of one little chimp struggling for acceptance.

5112210,5,B007VYQ6DS,"I enjoyed every moment of this movie, and that is literally a first for a Disney production.  Usually I admire their artistry but am in misery through at least part of the movie, either because it depicts loss or because I get bored at points.  Although this film has the usual heartbreak of a parent that dies, which Disney has inexplicably featured in virtually every child's film from Bambi to Dumbo to the Lion King as though the death of a parent is a requisite for children's film fare, this time it was handled much better.  The heartache that you feel for little Oscar is tender, and you feel sorry for him but are not racked with sobs for a change.  Although it looks for awhile as if he will not survive, a surprising development helps him overcome his loss and restores his safety.

If you think about how this movie had to be made, you begin to realize how incredible it is that the footage was even captured.  Unlike a movie set, where there are actors who recite their well crafted lines on cue, this film was built from raw nature footage.  If you think that's easy, go out in your backyard and try to put together a film with a riveting storyline based on the nature you see there.  This was not just nature footage; it was a developed plot that in reality was not under the control of the director.  This story was discovered, not created in a writer's imagination to come out just the way he intended.  The only manmade part of it was the narration, and paradoxically, that was what made it all seem so natural.  It takes a lot of talent to take the raw footage and build a story from it, even when the footage might suggest a story.  In this, the filmmakers did an excellent job.  The story is compelling and cohesive.

What really makes this movie rock, though, is the narration by Tim Allen.  He totally nailed it.  If you just saw the footage without the narration, you would find that the movie was not nearly as good.  Allen resonates in this movie.  As magnificent as the lush photography and the real nature story are, it is Allen that makes it all come together and gives it impact.  I'm sure there was a script for his work, but he made it come to life.  He's got the narration gene, not to mention the voice.

This film merits awards, and I hope it gets them.  Although I love nature, most nature films are several rungs less interesting and well done as this one.  This is far beyond being a nature video with a running commentary.  It is an unforgettable story set in a jungle exploding with fascinating wildlife and told by a narrator with the perfect pitch and timing to make it real.  Kudos to everyone who worked on this film, and by the way--thanks!",1351728000,,2685,4.397565922920893
5112211,5,B007VYQ6DS,"This blu-ray looks great! I've been hoping for more docs in hi-def, and this one delivers the reality. The doc isn't especially fabulous, but there are a few truly fine things, especially when Oscar finds his mentor (don't want to spoil it saying more). That's a rare happenstance and getting it on camera in this quality is a once in a lifetime deal.

My gal loves monkeys (hence being with me), so I got this for her with high hopes, and we both loved it. Anybody would have a hard time denying some ancestral background with simians while watching this, but boy I wish I could hang around on that level. Their societal setup sure ain't very different from ours, either, is it.

The best moment for me is Oscar's eyes when his new Dad gives him some food and you see the very deep gratitude and love. Everybody involved in the corporate destruction of our rainforests so we can eat more fast food burgers should be shown that Clockwork Orange-style for a week to wake them up.

The final stat, that there were a million chimps in the wild in 1960 and now only 20% of them are left, says it all, sadly. Who are the real apes here? At least these ones know how to live in harmony with their environment. Makes you wonder what intelligence really is.

For positing those questions to our young ones--and we the not so wise elders--in such tremendous visual depth, this is well worth seeing. Add a few bits of slo-mo genius, such as rain hitting the puffy fungi, and the incredibly close footage which took five years of co-habitation to achieve (as explained in one of the many very useful extras), and Chimpanzee becomes a vital reminder of what our seemingly cozy little suburban lives are costing the rest of this planet.

5112213,5,B007VYQ6DS,"This was an excellent film... a poignant and touching look at animal behavior... it so clearly illustrates that some things don't change in the evolutionary process from the apes to humans. It also demonstrates that the similarities in behavior between apes and humans, in essence, hasn't really changed that much... both are still based on ""food chain economics... if you can't defend or protect what is ""yours"", someone or something somewhere along the food chain will try to take it away from you or compete for a part of it. It also demonstrates that exceptional things can happen in interpersonal relationships that supersede basic instincts of self preservation and competition for resources... where caring and giving to others becomes as, or, more important than focusing primarily on one's own needs. A great movie for all ages. Tim Allen's narration and the screenwriting was superb. A very touching and eye-opening film! I recommend it highly...",1350950400,,956,5.214285714285714

5112261,4,B007VYQ6DS,"First, in reference to the chimps attacking monkeys for food and each other for territory not being appropriate for children those critics must have spent their entire lives in concrete, asphalt and glass while only experiencing nature in parks and zoos. Any child raised on a farm, ranch, or in the developing/undeveloped rest of Earth has seen much ""worse"" (aka reality). Even the parts shown were heavily edited so that compared to other documentaries showing the same encounters, it was very tame.
Second, the film crew must have ""tough skin"" both literally and figuratively to survive the insects, rain, mud, animals and every other imaginable extreme discomfort to slog daily through those jungles for a year+ and for at times 20 seconds worth of useable film for that day's effort. I bow to you film crew. Didn't they think of bringing insect repellent netting for clothing either during or between times when they trekking in heavy forest?
Third, the decades of preparation and the years of filming/editing etc. was an amazing accomplishment.
Fourth, the storytelling part was a double edged sword in that it was engaging for the human interpretation and presentation of chimp life, but also seemed too anthropomorphizing under guidelines for a strict academic style doc. If you can look past that last part and just relate to the storytelling as a human to chimp interpretation then I find no fault in this exceptional filming.
Fifth, if after viewing this film the shared commonalities between chimps and humans is not apparent then some ""soul"" searching is in order.",1347580800,,1577,5.069230769230769

5112264,4,B007VYQ6DS,"When watching CHIMPANZEE, it is impossible not to wonder, ""How did they do that?"" How on earth could the photographers gotten so close to these chimpanzees to get such an incredibly intimate portrait of their lives. It is beyong amazing and is stunning in every sense of the word. We see the rainforest habitat of the chimps and there are so many gorgeous views of the landscape and the animals and plants that inhabit the forest. Remarkable time lapse photography shows plants growing and blossoming. Incredible. Our story follows infant Oscar being raised by his loving mother Isha. Their scenes together are moving and heartwarming. Human parents could do well to learn about bonding and family love. Isha nurtures and protects Oscar and teaches him the ways of survival.
It's not any easy life out in the world, but Oscar and Isha's group is led by wise old Freddie. Unfortunately, resources are limited in the forest and a bigger and stronger band of chimps led by Scar is a constant threat. There is no peace and harmony in the rain forest for all the chimpanzees.
DisneyNature makes a fantastic attempt to get up and close to the chimps and to understand their day to day lives. The photography is rich in color and simply breathtaking. This is a perfect movie for the entire family. Maybe it could be upsetting for very little children but the movie is done so well. Nature's occasional violence is kept off screen but there is no doubt of what has just happened. There is an amazing tragedy throughout the film. All hope seems to be lost when a most amazing and surprising thing happened. You have to watch the film to find out. It is truly inspiring.
A couple of things have kept me from giving CHIMPANZEE the full 5 stars. Tim Allen narrates the film and I don't think he was the right choice. There are often jokes about Oscar's cute antics. Sure, it makes the film fun but what is the film--a documentary or a scripted story put together with whatever footage was filmed?
I had a feeling the filmmakers created a story once they saw what film they had. Maybe the idea was just to appeal to the whole family and to make the movie less serious, but I just don't think comedic actor Tim Allen was right for the role of narrator. Another problem for me was the music. There were a couple of songs that reminded me of 1930's music. I would have expected African traditional music yet the filmmakers went a different route.
It has to be pointed out that this film is stunning in its beauty. I can't believe the photographers could have gotten such intimate access to the chimpanzees without disturbing them. Animals lovers can't miss this one.",1347494400,2,2650,4.628450106157112

5112269,5,B007VYQ6DS,"When the filmmakers who brought the Disneynature feature film Chimpanzee to the movie screen, they may have expected some hazards (wait until you see the eye-popping bonus feature in which they're constantly tormented by bees), but they never expected a rare and amazing story to tell itself right before their cameras.

A young chimp, named Oscar for the film, suffers a difficult loss and a astonishing gain. Sorry if that's too much of a spoiler, but that is only one of the experiences you will share in this, perhaps the most remarkable of the Disneynature film series. Tim Allen narrates with a fine blend of warmth, concern and humor as this chimpanzee troup lives through various challenges, searches for food and has fun -- like most families.

The film is so engrossing, the 78 minutes seem to fly by. Generous bonus sequences that chronicle the creation of the film, though not as plentiful for DVD users, are almost as fascinating as the film itself. If you see this on Blu-ray, prepare for a breathtaking ride. Some of the scenes are so lush and painterly, they look as if they came from a classic Disney animated feature -- particularly a stunning long upward pan resembling a fantastic mulit-plane Disney sequence.

Young children may be unnerved by some of the material, and there is a disclaimer about the bee sequence -- it's that intense.

it's nice to be able to watch this from a comfy chair in a climate-controlled room and be grateful to the filmmakers for going to such extreme lengths to capture all of this for all of us to experience.",1346976000,9,1561,4.749077490774908
5112270,5,B007VYQ6DS,"Beautiful -- nature at its best.  The Disney Studios, through its Disney Nature series, are producing splendid documentaries about our living planet. With the successful release of ""Oceans,"" ""Earth,"" and ""African Cats,"" we now have the amazing ""Chimpanzee,"" an extremely absorbing and visually astonishing look at one of our closest relatives in the Animal Kingdom: the Chimpanzees.

Even though the story of ""Chimpanzee"" looks like the monkeys were acting, they were not. The movie is the result of long and tedious hours of waiting with patience, and the effects of many other inconveniences while filming in a tropical rain forest. And, what we watch on the screen, is just fantastic, as the filmmakers were able to follow a group or troop of chimpanzees, and track their every move. In that way, we meet Oscar, a baby chimpanzee, who happens to be the star of the movie. We see him struggling during his early days, playing with his mother, learning to use ""tools,"" learning to eat, and more. In addition, we see the elders of his group, under the leadership of Freddy, a selfish, yet powerful male that really knows how to protect his clan. Of course, not every moment is happy, as we witness how these chimpanzees have to hunt and kill Colobus monkeys for their share of animal protein. And then there are the other groups of chimpanzees with whom they fight with -- at times until death -- for food, especially nuts, loosing their territory in the process. In this case, the enemy troop was led by ""Scar"" and his band of ""thugs."" During the whole film, Oscar is the main character, as we see him trying to survive the daily struggles of life in the jungle.

The amazing thing about ""Chimpanzee,"" is that while directors Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield were documenting the daily lives of the monkeys, as to see if they could film good material for their story, they also documented the most important parts of the chimpanzees' lives for us to know. We learn about their diets, their hierarchical structure, their good and not-so-good behaviors, aspects of their formidable intelligence, and their enormous capacity to love.  This is one film for the whole family to watch and learn together. The Blu-ray + DVD edition includes a making-of documentary, music videos, conservation documentaries, and more. (Tanzania / USA, 2012, color, 78 min plus additional materials).

5112271,1,B007VYQ6DS,"I waited so long to receive this documentary, expecting something on par with the great animal documentaries shown on PBS.  Not!  I can't tell you how disappointed I was by this Disneynature Chimpanzee film.  The narration by Tim Allen was dull and slow. His comments were stiff and overly-orchestrated.  Not in sync with what we were seeing.  The comments lacked substance and did not complement the scenes.  As to the scenes: the majority of the shots taken of the Chimps were veiled by the trees and shadows of the forest.  There were no sustained closeups of the Chimps' activities and daily lives. The camera seemed to jump around a lot. I would not recommend this film for purchase.",1346630400,9,688,4.779661016949152

5112273,5,B007VYQ6DS,"If you love animals, you'll LOVE this story about an orphaned chimpanzee. It's enough that the little guy is absolutely cuter than anything, but then the story will completely warm your heart. And if that isn't enough, you have Tim Allen giving his classic wit and cheeky narration. He makes you laugh with his inimitable style and you are sure to be entertained. And the cinematography is right on par with IMAX's Planet Earth. This is a must-watch!",1345766400,4,450,4.782051282051282
5112274,3,B007VYQ6DS,"I saw this movie on opening night when it was released in theaters. There were definitely some good points, but there were also an equal number of bad points -

Good Points -

(1) Nature footage extraordinary! Seeing the natural world in all its glory and splendor was awe inspiring.
(2) The story itself, and witnessing the remarkably rare event between Oscar and Freddy was simply awesome (- not giving away any spoilers). Jane Goodall commented after the fact that this event is exceptionally rare in nature, and to capture it on film, I felt truly privileged to watch it happen.
(3) Generally a good nature documentary which captures and educates the viewers on the natural chimpanzee behaviors.

Bad Points -

(1) I said ""generally"" good nature documentary because there were some inaccuracies. The chimpanzees greatest threat by far is people. In the movie, it was reported as something else.
(2) The over the top narration by Tim Allen was horrible. I was expecting narration like African Cats with Samuel Jackson, and even a similar script....not quite the case here.
(3) Labeling one group of chimpanzees as good and the other as bad just is not accurate. Ok I get it, Disney is trying to tell a story aimed at little kids, but cmon! There is nothing evil or inherently bad about about nature.

In summary, I am still going to buy this blueray, however, I am disappointed to say that it is not as good as other nature documentaries, but still worth the money.",1345766400,3,1468,4.741176470588235
