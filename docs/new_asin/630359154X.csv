7851241,3,630359154X,"This is set at the beach with the instructor, Ed Monaghan having many years of martial arts experience & saying this has Muy Tai & another form in it.
This is set on a Mexico beach & starts with basic very slow instruction to show you basic core form.
The rest of the workout has Ed mostly watching Rachel's form, and only doing the work when showing a new punch, hook, elbow strike, kick, etc.
He is great about teaching form & going a certain speed to keep you from getting sloppy and work on your form for balance & safety like a real martial arts student.

I took off 2 stars because I don't want to watch Rachel's form, I want to watch the real expert. If he had another where HE was doing the work, I'd buy that.

7851242,1,630359154X,"I am very disappointed in this video. It's more of an instruction to Rachel Hunter (from the man teaching her) than I expected.  I expected it to be just her, showing what she knows or was taught to the audience.  No offense against the guy, in fact I'd rather have a video from him alone than from her.  It is very slow paced and didn't even get my heart beat going.",1055548800,,367,4.140845070422535
7851243,4,630359154X,"Rachel is extremely focused and puts out maximum effort thru the entire video. She is not the least bit concerned about her hair or makeup and as far as I can tell it is a real session. Not some contrived peice shot over  many days, to obtain some perfect unreachable reality. This video is highly  adaptable, to many fitness levels and much more fun than aerobics.  Dont  delay, buy this video and get going.",914457600,5,409,4.486486486486487
