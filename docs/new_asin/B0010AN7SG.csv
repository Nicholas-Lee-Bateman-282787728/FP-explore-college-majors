8237522,5,B0010AN7SG,this is a great video and love looking at all of the best fights of 2007 would love to look at more of the same.,1362355200,,112,3.52
8237523,5,B0010AN7SG,"I actually prefer the format the UFC 'best of' are in now a days where they show high lights of all the spectacular knock outs, submissions and finishes the year had to offer. Then, usually on the second disc they will show about 10 of the BEST of the BEST or most talked about fights of that year.  You always get more then your money's worth when it comes to these DVD's, great drinking DVD, great past time DVD and great just all around cap off to the year DVD for any UFC fan who may have missed something.  So, with that said, the UFC 2007 version shows the ENTIRE FIGHTS which means we see less then what the year had to offer, however, it is still well worth the money because you see some pretty good fights in this and it's a pleasure to have it!  Great for any UFC fan for sure!",1360627200,,788,4.103896103896104

8237527,5,B0010AN7SG,"This is a great set of fights. It includes some fights that were on fight nights and TUF finales. The only things wrong with the dvd is that Anderson Silva is on the front of the cover, but none of his fights are shown and Couture's fights are not on here. Also on my dvd the entire Spencer Fisher vs. Sam Stout fight was present so I don't know whats wrong with the other reviewer's copy.",1207008000,,389,4.131578947368421
8237528,4,B0010AN7SG,"This 2-disk DVD set is an incredible collection of exciting UFC fights from 2007. Even if you already own most of the full fight cards from their individual event DVDs, there's just something about being able to pop a single disk into your player and watching excellent bout after excellent bout that makes this set worth buying. _Best of 2007_ is a great introduction to the UFC for new fans, as most (but not all) of the big-name fighters are on it. My favorite use of this set, however, has been to have all of the matches play on the big-screen TV during a party - guests tend to float around it during their mingling, as it provides an interesting conversation piece. :)

The problem with this set is that it not only lacks the most talked-about fight of 2007, but many of the runner-ups are also missing. The most talked about fight, of course, was Randy Couture's battle against Tim Sylvia at UFC 68 - a bout that turned Couture into a world-famous superstar rather than just an MMA hero. Since that bout went the distance (25 minutes), I can see why it wasn't included - but that doesn't explain why Couture's equally-famous match against Gonzaga at UFC 74 was ignored (an extremely bloody match that resulted in broken bones and a TKO). Couture's departure from the UFC in late 2007 is probably to blame for his fights not being in this collection, but he's not the only fighter who's disappearance will confuse fans. Middleweight champion Anderson Silva DOMINATED name opponents (including former champion Rich Franklin) throughout 2007, but his full fights are not on these DVDs. B.J. Penn put on a legendary display of Octagon skill against Jens Pulver at The Ultimate Fighter 5 finale, but that match isn't included, either. The list goes on and on...

Best of 2007 has two interesting bonus features. The first is a featurette entitled ""2007 Behind the Scenes"" that contains interviews and locker room footage describing the main UFC fights of 2007 (though still lacking any details of Couture's huge accomplishments). The second is a multi-angle enabled fight between Marcus Davis and Paul Taylor that allows viewers to see the events from any of the four Octagon cameras. These features probably won't interest casual UFC fans, but hardcore UFC followers should find them worth playing.

Conclusion: This is a five star collection of fights that is well worth the retail price. It is not, however, a complete representation of the best fights of 2007, which is why I can only give it four stars. I still highly recommend it, even with its flaws.
