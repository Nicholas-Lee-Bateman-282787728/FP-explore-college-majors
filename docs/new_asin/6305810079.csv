1083853,5,6305810079,"The film itself consists of many single-shot pieces telling a story about art, who sets the standards of art, and what it means to create a work for people instead of ""collectors.""  There are excellent scenes  depicting (on radio and in person) appearances before Dies  ""un-American activities"" committee.  The creative process is  depicted as a sort of hallucinatory reality both of the playwright and the  play itself.  Bill Murray's character portrays the notion of theatre as the  artist speaking through and for others, a main theme of the film  symbolically underscored by the portrayal of artist Diego Garcia and the  beautiful but ""too controversial"" mural commissioned for the  Rockefeller plaza, which is physically destroyed just as the play  ""Cradle Will Rock"" is performed with its verboten ideology of  people joining together to effect change through unionism and solidarity.  The cynicism of the wealthy elite chatting about determining the future  direction of modern art through selective patronism should be seen not as a  charicature but as a prediction of the future as demonstrated by the final  shot of the film (and illuminated brilliantly by the German artist Hans  Haacke).",959644800,,1199,5.287234042553192
1083854,1,6305810079,"Tim Robbins started well, and accurately in his Hollywood career.  As a shallow, not too perceptive, but upcoming pitcher, he learned finesse in the art of empty sports cliche from Kevin Costner in Bull Durham. It worked  within and without that film for Robbins' character.  Apparently someone  else helped him out with the art of empty, juvenile Marxist cliche for his  directorial career and he's ridden it ever since to a fair deal of critical  plaudits which are as well merited as the pitcher's interview fodder.  Somehow, I couldn't miss the comparison with Miller's far more competent  work in The Crucible which, makes the leftist argument in a far more  sensible, literate and effective manner.  More pointedly, Miller takes the  rational side of the controversy he describes, unlike Robbins who seems to  embrace the political superstitions of the Thirties long after the adult  world has abandoned them.  When all is said and done, I couldn't help but  see this product as little more than a melodrama for benighted Marxists,  replete with hissing the villain and cheering the protagonist.  Save your  time and money.",959472000,8,1129,5.076502732240437
1083855,2,6305810079,"""Cradle Will Rock"", written and directed by Tim Robbins, is the story of a government-funded Left-wing musical in the 1930's, and how it was shut down on its opening night.  For some reason, it's also about the  destruction of Diego Rivera's Commie mural for Rockefeller Center . . .  Robbins is clearly trying to draw parallels.  In fact, he's trying to tell  the entire story of the Depression, Fascism  (at home and abroad), the  nature of Genius, Art Itself, etc.  He would've been better advised to  focus on the darn play.  I'm not sure we needed his particular opinions on  Hearst & Davies, for instance:  the depiction herein is, frankly,  unforgivably slanderous and irresponsible.  For that matter, so is the  depiction of Welles & Houseman:  the drunk and ninny presented here  (respectively)  seem unable to act like grown-ups at any time, much less  run the Mercury Theatre.  Farce is one thing, but making farces out of Real  People with Real Living Descendants is an egregious thing to do . . . but  the four mentioned ARE dead, so who really cares, right?
At any rate . .  . as I said, the movie tries to do too much, tell too much.  One would  think that the story of the making of the musical  ""The Cradle Will  Rock""  and its unfortunate stage history would be of sufficient  interest, but Robbins must show off:  the appearances of Nelson  Rockefeller, Frida Kahlo and her hubby, among others, are merely cultural  cache, not good storytelling.  But that's only one aspect of Robbins'  self-indulgence:  you can bet that the characters on the Right side of the  political spectrum are presented as drunks or otherwise sad or neurotic  people.  As much as I sympathize with Robbins' politics, I still can't get  past the didactic bullying.  Despite that, Bill Murray rises splendidly to  the occasion in his part of a Right-wing ventriloquist, bringing real flesh  and blood and pain to the proceedings.  (Murray is fast becoming one of the  best character actors around -- what a wonderful surprise it is!)  John  Turturro, on the other side of the firing line, is also fine as the  passionately Left-wing Italian actor.  During the clandestine performance  of the musical at the end of the film, Turturro is thrilling.  His  character really believes in what he is doing.  Unfortunately, not many of  the other characters seem to:  this is a bandwagon movie, with a lot of  name stars apparently doing Tim a favor.  Not many serious performances,  here.
Overdirected and overwritten, *Cradle Will Rock*  could've been so  much better.",959040000,8,2555,4.83411214953271
1083856,4,6305810079,"I realize that watching a movie about a play and not actually experiencing that play from the beginning does not qualify me as actually grading the play.....however.....the play ""Cradle Will Rock"" sounded hokey  and average. The songs didn't move me, and when the entire audience erupts  at the end in joyous exaltation, I sat unmoved by what I had seen. I mean,  does anyone know why this musical has never been revived? It can't be some  sort of anti-union conspiracy. The musical just isn't that good. At least  not to me.
That being said, the actual event that led to the performance  of the play was very powerful. The epic scale of the film dealing with not  only the federal theater, but also with the emergence of painters and the  multi-millionaires who funded their works until they became too political  was very interesting and balanced.
The performances in this ensemble were  also very well done, especially the combination of Joan Cusack and Bill  Murray as anti-communist activists. Murray has a wonderful moment during  his last performance as a ventriloquist that is heartbreaking. At the other  end of the spectrum was Vanessa Redgrave, in a rare bad performance,  playing a countess who gets swept up in artistic causes. I know she is  supposed to be a little ditzy, but I wanted to slap her face a couple of  times during the film.
Being a Tim Robbins' film, it is very passionate.  From a technical standpoint, it is the best-made film he has made, but it  is nowhere near as powerful as ""Dead Man Walking,"" which took a  very controversial subject and viewed it from both sides fairly and  accurately. ""Cradle Will Rock"" basically says:  Artists=good  Government=evil. Okay, maybe not that extreme, but still it is quite  cartoonish when portraying its good guys and bad guys without creating any  depth behind them. Here, Wiiliam Randolph Hearst is just a wealthy man who  can get away with anything, and his heart is black and cold....""RKO  281,"" about Hearsts' fight with Orson Welles' making of ""Citizen  Kane"" paints a much more tragic portrait, and ultimately a more  convincing film.
Still, the film works showing us the joy of creating  art. Although it is not as good as ""Shakespeare In Love"" or  ""Topsy-Turvy"" which dealt with the same subject matter, it still  succeeds in showing that performing can sometimes be magical.
I have  probably been more negative than I should have been. I probably held this  up to a higher standard, but Robbins' work deserves that. This is an  entertaining and sometimes powerful film, but it is not a masterpiece. One  day Robbins will create that masterpiece. Great last shot, however.",958608000,2,2653,4.87219730941704

1083957,4,6305810079,"This is as close to a performance of ""The Cradle Will Rock"" that one is likely to find.  The contextualization of the famous ""performance event"" and the fate of the WPA Theatre Unit is significant to both American theatre history and American political history.

I was led to find this through extended mentions of the play in Chris Hedges' ""The Death of the Liberal Class"".  It is sad to see how far America has slipped away from its populist and socialist past to become the corporatist, right wing land of walking amnesiacs that we are now.  Yes, Virginia, there once was a vital and creative political left in America...

Tim Robbins handles the subject matter and weaves the varied story lines quite successfully.  The ensemble is superb especially Cherry Jones as Hallie Flanagan.  Many nuances and contradictions are deftly presented and one takes away a real sense of the energy that once flowed in the American art scene during the period before World War II and the political mendacity that surrounded that scene.

Students of the arts and those interested in American cultural history will enjoy this.  Those unfamiliar with the period will probably be confused but hopefully they will be spurred on to learn more.  Political conservatives will find it revolting and the film will underscore their already firmly held convictions about elitist Hollywood leftist proaganda.  Political progressives should be humbled to see how far they have fallen from their activist past to their present status as willing co-conspirators of the conservative political class.",1389052800,,1570,5.117647058823529

1083966,1,6305810079,"Cradle Will Rock, released in 1999, is a film about finding a balance between art and politics, as well as artists fighting in what they believe is right.  Artists are influenced by issues in everyday life, which in this movie is dealing with unions, the government, and the Great Depression.  The film tried to show that even though we are all tempted by different types of prostitution or exploitation, we all can remain pure by standing in what we believe in and stand against the evil vices we encounter.  During a time of struggle, the artists in the movie (actors, painters, ventriloquists, etc.) stood up for what they believed in.  They spoke the truth of the corruption in politics and society.  This message is deep, yet I don't think the movie as a whole did a good job of tying it all together at the end to really portray this strong message.

Basically there were too many plots and sub plots interwoven in this film.  There isn't a main protagonist and you don't get to connect on a personal level with any of the characters because there are so many of them.  Also, this film is very confusing and hard to follow.

1084014,4,6305810079,"Cradle Will Rock is a piece of theater history. It was made during the Great Depression in the 1930s when times were hard and entertainment was escapist. However, Cradle Will Rock was a generic story that made a dramatic statement about the times and how hard life was. It was so strong, it was banned, but the actors believed in the message so much they performed anyway at the risk of their jobs, something scarce and vital in those days.

The writing in this film is incredibly well done and the cast is amazing. It is overflowing with notable actors (John Cusack, Hank Azaria, Susan Sarandon, Cary Elwes, Bill Murray, etc) and famous characters (Diego Rivera, William Randolph Hearst, Orson Welles, etc). Most films about this era are disappointing because they don't seem to capture it without being preachy or overly sentimental. This one is not perfect, but it is much closer. Aside from the historical stories, the film is actually interesting to watch and the characters are relatable.

The music is done well too. The characters do not just burst into song; they have a reason for singing when they do, which is not too terribly often.

The only complaint I have is the historical accuracy of some of the real characters. As a fan of silent films, I was disappointed to see that the few scenes with Marion Davies managed to portray her as a drunk and a dimwit. Even Hearst was portrayed to be rather overbearing and pompous. Still, they were a minor part of the action and did not ruin the film.",1140393600,8,1505,4.650375939849624

  This great film serves as final justice for a great and wonderful play written for the Federal Theater Project that was never shown, yet deserved the highest accolades as one of the greatest plays ever written, produced or played.  The wonder and glory of this great film is not only the initial play's great value, but the conditions of complete oppression and repression under which it was, nevertheless, written, produced, viewed and reviewed.

1084016,4,6305810079,"The time was 1936-the painful apex of the Great Depression. This was the world inhabited by the plethora of characters in this film. Most of them were real people-augmented by fictional counterparts. Composer Marc Blitzstein was real-as was his Brechtian musical. Its opening night is still considered the most extraordinary night in the history of American theatre. Rockefeller, Hearst, Diego Rivera, Orson Welles, and John Houseman were all real-and they did have a struggle with Actor's Equity and Federal Theatre Project (1935-39).

Tim Robbins, director, kept the film moving at a frenetic pace-flowing smoothly-overlapping several sub-plots and vignettes-and pulling it all together for the opening night of the landmark Marxist musical play. He cast his lovely lady-Susan Sarandon, in the small part of Mussolini's mistress Margherita. She shined as usual. Hank Azaria was very intense and effective as the composer Blitzstein-who heard ""music"" while immersed in the strife of the times. Ruben Blades played the artist Diego Rivera quite effectively-but that part will always belong to Alfred Molina after his turn in FRIDA (2002). John Cusack played NY mayor Nelson Rockefeller. Angus MacFadyen hammed it up a bit much as the young tiger-Orson Welles. Carey Elwes played John Houseman with a bit of a limp wrist. Cherry Jones was very good as Hallie Flanagan-head of the FTP. Vanessa Redgrave had a ball playing Countess LaGrange. Philip Baker Hall was the fictitious steel magnate-Gray Mathers. Bill Murray did a grand job playing ventriloquist-Tommy Crickshaw. Joan Cusack was prissy-good as muckraker Hazel Huffman. Emily Watson lifted our spirits playing down-on-her-luck Olive Stanton. John Turturro stood out as the young actor and family man-Aldo Silvano. The supporting cast was huge. It included Bernard Hughes, John Carpenter, Gretchen Mol, Jack Black, Paul Giamatti, Bob Balaban, and Harris Yulin.

Robbins has created an epic film with multiple narrative threads-endeavoring to encapsulate an entire world in turmoil-and set it to music. He adopted the point of view of the artist-the prince of players at the head of his troupe of swirling acrobats, jugglers, singers and actors. But when these many plot lines and battalions of characters are thoroughly mixed-and the denouement emerges-he pulled everything together into a precarious balance-performing a kind of performance magic. Based on the film's BO records (modest revenues)-a lot of people out there did not have the patience, education, stamina, or motivation to hold on for the full ride. It is not a film for the faint of focus. It takes a throbbing love of theatre and film to ride it full-tilt to the final buzzer and roll of credits.",1121904000,22,2719,5.350467289719626

And of course it's politically skewed way to the Left.  There is no middle class represented amongst the characters-none of the 85% who stayed working at their jobs after 1929.  Characters are either 1) out of work, starving or struggling, or 2) government employees working under the New Deal as they wait for the reactionary Republican funding axe to fall, or 3) the mega-rich eating expensive meals at Twenty-One, laughing about life at the lower depths as they make business deals with Mussolini.

A dazzling ensemble of characters who are seemingly separate from one another but all their loose ends are woven back together at the end, just like in Altman's movies.
The subject I'd say is a bit cliche (Business = bad, Unions = good) but under proper direction could have been made interesting. Yet, Robbins chooses to apply such a hamfisted hand that it's difficult to get caught up in the story, despite the blistering pace at which he tells it.
Plus, the protagonists seem shallowly defined. Either they're good, salt of the earth sort of people, or they're insecure, lonely and desperate whistle-blowers (like the character played by Bill Murray).
At roughly 2.5 hours length, some judicious editing was in order, but despite the epic scale of the production and the calibre of the actors, this film ultimately winds up being little more than a overdrawn diatribe on the state of big businesses in the US.
Recommended rental perhaps for some neat camerawork, or perhaps the last 20 minutes that were without a doubt the most clever and entertaining bit of the entire film.",1088035200,9,1209,4.87378640776699
1084080,4,6305810079,"Where is class warfare now that we need it? In the 1930s, when most decent people feared a Communist in every closet, no one thought twice about the fascists and their capitalist allies despoiling the commons. Into this time stepped the
Federal Theater Project (an offshoot of the New Deal's Works Progress Administration), which provided outlet and employment for Depression-era artists. Too bad they were Socialists, too. If you don't know the history of the period, you'll miss a lot of this fascinating story. Cradle Will Rock reflects the title of an FTP production, a real musical written by the real-life playwright Marc Blitzstein (played by Hank Azaria).The anti-communist Dies Commission tried to close down the FTP because it criticized capitalism and harbored Communists. But The Cradle Will Rock opens defiantly in another venue, on June 16, 1937, when the original theatre is padlocked.
Getting to opening night is a fascinating, serpentine historical journey. Imagine this mix of personalities: Orson Welles (Angus Macfadyen) crossing creative swords with John Houseman (Cary Elwes), Nelson Rockefeller (John Cusack) trying to temper the revolutionist artist Diego Rivera (Ruben Blades) - a confrontation played somewhat better in Frida. And then there were other, lesser-known and fictional, characters, such as real-life actress Olive Stanton (Emily Watson), pining for a role; real-life Margherita Sarfatti (Susan Sarandon), passing the hat among capitalists like fictional steel magnate Gray Mathers (Philip Baker Hall) to support the fascist Mussolini; fictional actor Aldo Silvano (John Turturro), balancing his socialist theatre aspirations against his pro-fascist family; and the FTP director and advocate, Hallie Flanagan (Cherry Jones), who fights the good fight for survival against the Dies Committee and do-gooder Hazel Huffman (Joan Cusack). (Huffman is lusted after by jaded ventriloquist Tommy Crickshaw, played by Bill Murray).
It is gratifying to know we can still get a pro-union film produced in this country, even though a lot of films escape to Canada to avoid union rules and negotiated pay rates. Just to give you an example of why rights for workers are necessary, here is an excerpt from a 23 December 2002 news story:
""Last week a jury confirmed what labor activists have argued for years - Wal-Mart is a corporate criminal making its profits by illegally breaking wage and labor laws: `In the lawsuit, 400 current and former employees from 18 stores in Oregon accused the company of violating federal and state wage laws by systematically pressuring them to work unpaid overtime.' And this case is just one example, as Wal-Mart has been quietly settling other lawsuits by employees across the country. Globally, Wal-Mart's drive for low wages extends to contracting with sweatshops in developing nations that systematically violate human rights and workers rights.""
Writer-director Tim Robbins has venerable liberal credentials, dating to the wicked satire Bob Roberts (1992), and he juggles all of these story lines with consummate skill. He and his excellent cast capture the excitement of putting on a show that might actually change minds, rather than just bring in spare change. There was a time in American history when some people were paying attention to what's good for American people rather than just American corporations. Cradle Will Rock is meant to rock you, not to sleep, as most entertainment does, but wide awake.",1042675200,12,3474,5.387867647058823
1084081,5,6305810079,"The only thing one can say after watching this film is WOW.  Tim Robbins takes on such a wide range of issues and does it well.  The cast is amazing.  The subject matter -- Art/Censorship/Wartime Politics/Patriotism - is so relevant today.  I wish the studios would re-release this and soon, before we wind up with an Ashcroft/Rumsfeld witch hunt related to Iraq and 9/11.  Even without thinking of these larger issues, the movie is simply great entertainment.  There's romance, drama, comedy, rags to riches sub-plots and history.  Characters include Nelson Rockerfeller, WR Hearst, Diego Rivera, and Orson Wells.  I mean this is ambitious stuff.  If I taught high school or college American History, I would show this film as a teaching tool.  Enjoy this film and hope that hollywood makes more like it.",1037664000,11,805,4.984962406015038
1084082,5,6305810079,"This is a brisk, fun film in many ways, because director Tim Robbins understands that it is very difficult to be didactic and entertain.  But, as Oliver Stone uses fast cuts and snappy dialogue so as to ""keep it moving,"" Robbins does just that too; and -- also like Stone -- he employs an exemplary cast to great result.
Ramon Blades portrays Diego Rivera as a wryly perceptive charmer; John Cusack is a superficially sophisticated Nelson Rockefeller; Emily Watson is a poignant portrait in sadness as the actress actually ""off the streets,"" Olive Stanton; Bill Murray is equally impressive as the melancholic, resentful vaudeville ventriloquist, Tommy Crickshaw; John Turturro is powerful and inspiring as the principled Italian immigrant who plays the union organizer in the radical Federal Theatre project musical that gives its title to this film.  (And I must add an accolade for Corina Katt, who is Frida Kahlo: she takes a small part with only a few lines -- in Spanish, already! -- and you literally can not take your eyes off her when she is on screen.)
As I say, there is a great deal of ""fun"" in this film, yet its essential story is serious and sad.  It chronicles the erosion of politically potent (meaning ""radical"") popular theatre into the (generally) escapist entertainment that pervades most American arts today.  From ""Lenin"" (who does not ""stay"" -- as Rivera's Rockefeller Center mural attacking imperial capitalism is destroyed by a self-righteously indignant Nelson) we have declined to ""Lennon"" -- i. e., a song like John Lennon's ""Imagine"" is as ""radical"" as pop culture is likely to allow.
And note especially the masquerade ball sequence in which Nelson Rockefeller, William Randolph Hearst, and ""Gray Mathers"" (a fictional but representative steel magnate) discuss their scheme to exalt ""individualistic"" (i. e., ego-centered) abstract, scenic and erotic art at the expense of art with social purpose and a social conscience.  If you wonder why there are so few good films that seriously critique our society and system (and so much silly, adolescent-oriented soft pornography), here is an explanation worth pondering -- as well as a movie worth seeing.",1023926400,10,2180,5.112359550561798
1084083,3,6305810079,"Tim Robbins, who directed Cradle Will Rock, is known to most people as an actor and as the husband of Susan Sarandon. He is gifted as a director, but he is not attracted to mainstream subject matter. His most famous work is Dead Man Walking, but even that, with its story about a nun's attempts to counsel a man condemned to death, was not seen that widely. Cradle Will Rock, is his most accessible film to date, still does not deal with topics of interest to the average viewer. However, for those tired of or bored with seeing essential the same stories over and over again, this might prove to be a nice alternative.
It's the late 1930s. America is still in the throes of the Great Depression. President Franklin Roosevelt's WPA, which has given work to a number of people through its vast program of public works, has recently started funding the arts. Actors, never steadily employed in the best of times, are lined up in droves at government offices in New York to try to land a part. The legendary Orson Welles [Angus MacFadyen] has obtained a grant to produce a musical called Cradle Will Rock. A lucky few will get jobs with the show. But the production is in chaos. The flamboyant sets don't work right. Welles is fighting constantly with his producing partener John Houseman [Cary Elwes]. Worse yet, outside forces are threatening the Federal program. Actors, along with many in other professions, blame the rich and those in power for causing and then prolonging the Depression. They hold demonstrations because they want to unionize. Many of the powerful people, in turn, blame Communism for causing the workers to demand better hours, wages and lives. Congress, always suspect of anything deemed art, is holding hearings to decide whether or not to continuing funding the program. It is, to say the least, a great big mess.
As you can tell, the time Cradle Will Rock is set in gives Robbins many themes to deal with. A few he is a bit heavy-handed with, but most he handles with a deft touch and a wry sense of humor.",1016496000,5,2031,4.644444444444445
1084084,5,6305810079,"In time of crisis, nothing is better than the `Panis et Circenses' politics. And the US government kwnew it for sure. So, in the late 20's, early 30's was created the Federal Theatre Project. Many treatre groups nation wide were sponsored by the government, as long as they staged plays that cheer the audience, which, by the way, was formed mostly by  unemployed people. Later on, the Congress investigated the FT due to some accusasion of comunism. After a 20% cut in the sponsor, many plays had to close and many artists increased the number of unemployment. One of the plays most affected by it was ""Cradle Will Rock"", a pro-union musical directed by Orson Wells that is prohibited of being released.
Tim Robbins's movie uses the Wells's production as an `excuse' to show us how art and politics can affect each other in many levels. The film is a wonderful American quilt with many tiny stories that little by little get togheter and creat a huge power over the audience. Besides ""Cradle..."" story, there is also the fight between Nelson Rockefeller and Diego Rivera over a mural painted by the artist in the lobby of The Rockfeller Center, in NY. The magnate went mad when he saw displayed in the painting Lenin's face. Another important pole of the movie is an ex-Mussolini's lover, who is in the US selling works by Italian geniuses, like Leonardo and Michelangelo, in order to get money to help Facism in Italy.
All there plots look a bit distant from each other in the beginning, but as the movies grows, one can notice how all of them are showing the power of the art and the artists over a society that is changing. Robbin's direction is very effective and touching. He shows how much he loves the artistic class and arts in genneral. But it is nothing new coming from one of the most political actors in Hollywood. The script mixes comedy, with musical and drama in perfect doses. Although the film takes some Artistic licences, they do not ccpromise the accuracy of the facts. By the way, as it is said in the beginning, it is `based on a mostly true story'.
The cast is a huge who-is-who, and every actor seem to be perfectly fit in his/her part. Joan Cusack has never been so deliciously hateful. Susan Sarando has a wonderful Italian accent and we can notice how sad her charater is because she has to sell works from masters to get money. Vanessa Redgrave is wonderful as a theatre enthusiast. She shines every scene she is in. The most importat female role belongs to Emily Watson, who perfectly plays an unemplyed-turn-to-actress singer who has to deal with lack of money in order to survive. The male cast is also exceptional. Hank Azaria is wonderful as the composer Mark Blitzstein, and it is amazing to watch his creation process of the show. John Cusack is as hateful as his sister, playing Nelson Rockefeller. Bill Muray is perfectly melancholic as a ventriloquist.
If Karl Marx had written musicals instead of essays, he probably would have written something very close to "" Cradle Will Rock"", the play. It has an extremely polical tune. Once I read in an interview Tim Robbins saying that Emily Watson's character was the hero of the movie. But I'm not sure of it. I think she may be the most important, but it seems to me that the hero -- if it happens to be one-- is the ART, which is portrayed as having a power to transform society. It is a wonderful smart and touching movie, that needs be discovered. Another thing, how do you understand the ending? I could not come up with a conclusion. It is very open.",1014595200,10,3539,4.599683544303797
1084085,4,6305810079,"When Tim Robbins brought his company up town to film portions of The Cradle Will Rock at 157th Street, I watched a bit of the filming and, after learning the premise of the story, researched some the history surrounding the premiere of Blitstein's opera. There are many threads and many characters in this story, some central, some peripheral; however, all of the characters and threads lead to one central event: the WPA-sponsored premiere of Blitzstein's opera.

To give detailed screen time to each thread of the story or to each character's part in it, a director would need to produce either a twenty-part mini-series, or a film of epic length.  The second best solution, which Robbins seems to have adopted, is to allot just enough screen time to each character and plot element to make clear how it relates to the central event and then move on, reserving focus and screen time for that central event, the premiere performance itself.
In doing this, a director must, of necessity, rely on the skills of actors who are capable of creating a character using minimal gestures, vocal inflections, and facial expressions.  Robbins has assembled such a cast and watching them work is part of the allure of this fascinating film.  Admiring the concise characterizations of Vanessa Redgrave and Susan Sarandon are but two reasons to watch this film again and again.  There are many fine performances here including John Cusack's Nelson Rockefeller, Emily Watson's Olive Stanton, and Bill Murray's disturbing portrayal of Tommy Crickshaw.  There are also a variety of views of Manhattan in the `30's, from the seedy backstage of a vaudeville house to a middle-class apartment, to an upper-class party.
Ultimately, however, this film exists for its central scene, the premiere.  The tension in the theatre as Blitztstein prepares to give a solo-performance of his opera is stomach-churning.  What happens next is written in opera history books.  When it does happen, the purpose of this film becomes clear; all of the characters and events, all of the threads of the story, come together in one moment of triumph.
This is not a film one can watch passively; it takes thought and imagination to connect the characters, images, and scenes into a unified whole.  It is, however, well worth the effort.",1006992000,3,2295,5.015789473684211

This is a movie, not a documentary. The themes of the movie are far more imprtant than any history lesson about the stage play in question. I don't claim to know what Mr. Robbins was thinking when he made this movie but I know this is part of it: during the last hundred years art, in all it's forms, has been bought, altered, censored, and exploited by big business and big governement. This has allowed more people to live and work as artists but it has also robbed them of their artistic vision and control, especially in Hollywood. Tim Robbins is making a statement.

1084160,2,6305810079,"I really had great hopes for this movie given its cast and the story of the Federal Theatre Project but the results are terribly thin both narratively and technically. Tim Robbins is obviously trying for Robert Altman's brand of ensemble magic here but he doesn't lend any kind of director's sensibility to the material and it sits there on the screen completely inert. (Robbins makes the mistake critics have always wrongly accused Altman of: relying exclusively on the actors for his effects). I kept watching the famous faces rushing around playing famous people and couldn't believe that the movie refused to develop much beyond one of those name-dropping Vanity Fair exposes of bygone Hollywood or Broadway; entertaining and diverting when you read them, completely forgotten when you're done. You admire the majority of the cast for who they are and for what they've done in the past, not for the slight performances the material forces on them here. What good is having dozens of famous actors play dozens of famous people if you present their histories without any depth or purpose? This is a view of 1930s New York in the same way that the musical ""Annie"" is a view of 1930s New York. The movie is lit by Jean-Yves Escoffier in a way that is totally wrong for the material and for the period; New York looks like it does in Vincente Minnelli musicals instead of a city suffering the effects of the Depression. This movie even manages to make Vanessa Redgrave tiresome; Robbins cuts to her beaming, approving, cheering face again and again when she's in the audience during the anticlimatic performance scenes and the message seems to be: if Vanessa Redgrave can stay awake for this, so can you. If there is a great story to be told about this particular artistic and political milieu, a failure like this will make it just that much harder for future filmmakers to have a go at it, a rather embarassing legacy for Robbins.",984614400,6,1931,4.7844311377245505

When I saw this in the theatre nearly half the audience walked out.  I say, forget 'em.  My friends and I loved it.  Simply because everyone doesn't get Brecht jokes certainly doesn't mean they shouldn't be made.  Overall a beautiful movie showing a piece of American History which people seem very willing to forget.
And as to those reviewers who shun the movie for slandering Hearst and Co., check your history.  A great deal of the American magnates, particularily Hearst and Ford, were either fascists or heavy supporters.  Deal with it.
And yes, The Cradle Will Rock isn't ""revived"" very much.  That's because it's not Cats.  It's Brectian dialectical theatre (Like Threepenny Opera).  And while Mack the Knife became a hit after being changed a bit by Louis Armstrong, the point with Brecht's kind of theatre was never to produce top 40 songs.

1084208,4,6305810079,"Although ultraconservatives will undoubtedly dismiss `The Cradle Will Rock' as blatant leftwing propaganda, the rest of us will see it as a fascinating rumination on the intricate relationship that has always  existed between politics and art. Writer/director Tim Robbins, whose  left-leaning sympathies are common knowledge in the film industry, has  managed to create a screenplay of amazing complexity and depth, functioning  on an enormous number of levels - political, historical, aesthetic,  personal - without ever losing clarity and focus. He has set up a dizzying  array of characters, yet each one is fleshed out with enough depth and  particularity to make him or her a vital part of the overall  tapestry.
Set in the turbulent 1930's, Robbins' tale focuses on the  National Theatre Company, an organization set up by Roosevelt during the  Depression to provide out-of-work artists a vehicle through which to ply  their trade and culture-starved audiences a chance to revel in the glories  of live theatrical performances. Unfortunately, it was also a time of great  civil and political upheaval, with Communism and Fascism battling for  supremacy abroad and many Americans divided along similar lines in their  loyalties. With passions running deep, it was only a matter of time before  many in the United States Congress began suspecting the NTC of Communist  sympathizing - and it was a short road from there to the eventual  dismemberment of the organization. The film centers on the production of a  controversial musical play called `The Cradle Will Rock' that portrays the  glorious coming of unionism to a steel factory, a scenario that parallels  the events in the lives of several of the characters in the film.
Given  this fascinating historical background, Robbins has filled his film with a  rich assortment of characters, from Orson Welles, as a fledgling young  actor who sees unions as the ruination of artistic purity, to Nelson  Rockefeller, as a well-meaning art patron who balks at the mural Diego  Rivera has painted for him only after Rivera refuses to remove the image of  Lenin from Rockefeller's monument-to-capitalism lobby. In fact, the cast of  characters is so enormous, with each one taking a crucial part in the  narrative proceedings, that it is quite impossible to mention them all  here. Suffice it to say that Robbins covers the social spectrum from  industrialists and capitalists to union workers and the unemployed, from  sympathetic patrons and patronesses to the little people eager to root out  the seeds of Communism even at the expense of their own ostracism. And not  a one is uninteresting.
Robbins has assembled an all-star cast that reads  like a who's who of contemporary movie acting (albeit of a non-blockbuster  variety). Although at the beginning of the film, the casting of such  familiar faces seems a bit disconcerting - leading to what critic Judith  Crist refers to as the `hey there' syndrome, i.e. destroying the  verisimilitude of a work by parading too many recognizable people before  the camera - this technique actually helps the audience to differentiate  the many characters who might otherwise pass by in a confusing and  disorienting blur. Hank Azaria, Ruben Blades, John Cusack, Joan Cusack,  Cary Elwes, Bill Murray, Vanessa Redgrave, Susan Sarandon, John Turturro  and Emily Watson comprise this truly fine cast.
Liberal as his leanings  might be, Robbins is able to focus on the bitter ironies that abound on  both sides of the political spectrum. For instance, while Susan Sarandon  portrays a Jewish ally of Mussolini, abandoning her pro-worker principles  to act as his capitalist representative in the States, Ruben Blades plays a  Diego Rivera who has subordinated - if only temporarily - his own  revolutionary ethos to the power of the almighty buck. Also, there is a  certain paradox to the fact that, when the government has decreed the  theater closed and thereby forbidden the premiere performance of the play,  it is the actors' UNION that threatens the performers with firing if they  carry out their plan to stage it furtively. Robbins is even somewhat  evenhanded in his treatment of the `enemy' - the rich capitalists and the  anti-communist members of the theatre organization - portraying them with  good-natured humor and pathos. Joan Cusack, as a clerk at the employment  office and Bill Murray, as a vaudeville ventriloquist, seem like decent  people, only hopelessly misguided and lonely. (Unfortunately, Murray's  sudden change of heart at the end seems inexplicable and unmotivated). As  for the elite in the story, Robbins does a lovely job of spoofery at the  end of the film; as the play is finally being performed at a nearby theatre  - representing the triumph both on stage and in the world at large of the  common man over the oppressive tyrants of industry - the tycoons, dressed  in masquerade ball costumes of the 18th Century aristocracy and Catholic  hierarchy, mull over their plans to retain control of the art world by  bankrolling only those paintings depicting the scenes of utmost blandness  and banality. Thus, these men of corporate power are portrayed more as  amusingly quaint pests than malevolent or malicious despots.
There is  certainly no denying that `The Cradle Will Rock' is, at heart, a bit of a  leftwing diatribe. However, it is not a cruel or unreasonable one. And Tim  Robbins' extraordinary skills as both a storyteller and filmmaker make this  clearly one of the most interesting and impressive films of 1999.",964310400,38,5553,5.144618834080718

Tim Robbins has an interesting story to tell, about the Federal Theater and ideological struggle in 1930's America, but he seems unable to decide on a  tone for the first half of the movie.  Right from the beginning, you see  weaknesses:  for example, a paragraph explaining the history of the period  is followed by a newsreel which repeats the same material again, completely  redundantly, and many serious conversations are conducted at a tempo which  is more appropriate for slapstick farce.  The primary plot is a playwright  (Hank Azaria)'s attempt to get his work performed.  However, other plots  are interspersed.  Susan Sarandon plays Mussolini's trade rep in the  U.S.(After seeing her host Joseph Campbell videos, this was a shock.) The  most interesting one for me was Diego Rivera (Ruben Blades) being  commissioned by Rockefeller(John Cusack) for a mural.  This would have been  a great film in itself; the two actors are great.  But the story eventually  zeroes in on the play, and the film builds up to a sappy last scene where  the play is performed against the odds in a purely spontaneous outburst of  joy.

1084210,5,6305810079,"It looks like a great deal of money was spent making this movie and in a perfect and fair world, it would have wound up, if not a grand commercial success, at least taking home a number of Oscars.  But the world doesn't  work that way, so most people will have to luck into the experience of  Cradle Will Rock, and I hope the reviews on this page will help.
The  complex plot has already been dealt with by other reviewers here, so I'll  just say that, although I am not expert on the movie's subject (though I  had read, in an Orson Welles bio, a little bit about the original play), it  wasn't too difficult to keep up with the various plot and character  strands.  A little bit of extra information, perhaps in an opening or  closing crawl, would have been nice, but the movie can definitely be  enjoyed by intelligent moviegoers without the apparatus of an historical  essay.  The film is beautifully shot and edited, and the acting is  absolutely superb throughout, especially Hank Azaria, Joan Cusack, and Bill  Murray.  My favorites were Cherry Jones, as a somewhat naive but honest and  hard-working arts administrator, and Vanessa Redgrave, as the wife of a  steel magnate who gives her sympathy and energy to the theater folk.  Her  part could easily have been played as just another bored rich person  dabbling in politics, but she gives her character such verve and enthusiasm  (especially during the climactic performance of the play) that she becomes  a fully rounded and engaging character. Robbins stated that he was going  for a screwball comedy pacing, despite the serious tone of most of the  material, and the pacing works well, keeping the plotlines going with no  boredom and a minimum of confusion--although we did have to stop the DVD a  couple of times to make sure we were getting all the developments straight.  The movie ends on a high note, and the very last, very surprising, shot,  puts a perfect cap on this, a wonderful movie indeed.",963360000,6,1966,4.683284457478006

During the Depression, there was a government funded theater program, created to give  work to professional actors, and to make live theater affordable for the  average person.  The story revolves around a pro-union musical, ""The Cradle  Will Rock,"" written by Marc Blitzstein (Hank Azaria), to be produced with  government funds, and directed by Orson Welles (Angus MacFadyen).  At the  same time, there is concern about possible Communist infiltration of the  program, and a Senate sub-committee begins hearings in an effort to root  out the ""Reds.""  This witch-hunt precursor to the infamous McCarthy  hearings brought about the closing of the show before it ever opened.  The  theater in which it was to be staged was closed down, and the actors  forbidden (under union sanction) to take the stage anywhere else in order  to perform this show; and it all came down on the eve of opening day.  Welles and company managed to secure a venue anyway, with the idea that  Blitzstein (who was not a union member) would play piano and perform the  entire show himself.  And for this one performance, the entire cast was  seated in the audience to watch, and give Blitzstein some moral support.  Near the beginning, when he falters, one of the actresses, Olive Stanton  (Emily Watson), rises from her seat and begins singing her part; and, one  by one, the rest of the cast follows suit, until the entire show is  performed by the actors from their places in the audience.  This  project was obviously a labor of love for Robbins, as a statement against  censorship, as well as to illustrate the tyrannical embolisms that can be  caused by fear.  Unfortunately, he takes this opportunity to make other  statements as well, involving the politics of big business, and of wealth,  and how it all tied in, and still does, with business as usual in  Washington today.  And, though his stand is well-taken, to anyone not quite  up to speed with their history, at least concerning this particular facet  of the Depression, the story just seems to cover too much ground in too  short a time.  True, the events enacted here are significant, and they do  tie in with the funding of the theater program, but the story of the show,  of Welles, of all the other members of the cast, and everything that went  into it, was enough story for the movie on its own; but, perhaps, that  movie wouldn't have made the impact Robbins had set out to make.  As it is,  ""Cradle Will Rock"" is fairly entertaining, but to actually learn anything  from it, one would have to make a number of cross-references first, before  making any conclusions (There is a disclaimer at the beginning of the film,  which states that the following is ""partly true"").  There are some  notable performances here, particularly Azaria, John Turturro (Aldo), and  Cherry Jones (Hallie Flanagan).  Hopelessly miscast are MacFadyen, who is  made to bear a strong physical resemblance to Welles, but who lacks that  distinctive voice, and Cary Elwes as John Houseman; in both instances,  their performances are no more than impersonations, and the actors never  really get to the soul of the men they are portraying, who ultimately  become nothing more than boldly drawn caricatures.

1084213,5,6305810079,"DANG Was this a good movie! Just finished watching it. It had a great ensemble including John Cusack playing Rockefeller quite well, Joan Cusack as a femine business woman working for the Gov but speaking out against it  (odd to see her being normal), Vanessa Redgrave (""Max"" from MI)  as a charming bourgeousie who dotes on getting involved in rambunctious  lower class political activity, Bill Murray as a has-been ventrilaquist,  Hank Azaria playing quite well the composer of the play, and Emily Watson  (Angela's Ashes) as a young homeless woman who wants to sing for a living.  It was written and directed by Tim Robbins, giving it just the eclectic  flair it needed.
Susan Sarandon isn't any good at being Italian but her  presence definitely adds to the cast. Makes you wonder what happened to the  beautiful art of good ensemble casting.
The movie is an equisite  combination of both subtle and down right blunt social and political  commentary. The entire movie has huge overtones of McCarthyanism and anti  facism, while at the same time also looking at the things earlier  mentioned--censorship or art, prostitution of everything, the depression  and union politics. It really expounds on a lot of history that's not  spoken of in typical general education and explores facets of our own not  so innocent cultural and politcal history. It's done so well that it could  be shown in any number of history classes, yet is not documentary-esque and  could hold its own in any serious ""hollywood film"" fight. Slow  moving at times but appropriately so.
Rated R for language and female  upper nudity. Most of the time, it was not in poor taste--used only to  emphasize the desperate ""carpe diem because it may be your last""  attitude of desperation experienced by those hit by the  depression.
Highly recommended--be warned, its long but definitely worth  the time.",961372800,4,1871,4.980582524271845
1084214,3,6305810079,"Poor Tim Robbins.  An anachronism born 50 years too late, he endures as a passionate liberal crusader in an age of capitalistic dominance.  `The Cradle Will Rock',  written and directed by Robbins, is a pining for the  glory days of the socialist and labor movements in the United States.  It  is a nostalgic piece with leftist sensitivities, written by one who wishes  he had been there.
This is a well assembled but bloated ensemble piece,  based on fact, that centers on the federal theater program of the mid  1930's.  This program was an outgrowth of the WPA from the depression years  that gave federal funding to the arts to give employment to out of work  actors, with the thinking that good theater would be good to boost the  moral of the masses.  Unfortunately, Robbins was overly ambitious in this  collage, attempting to weave together no less than four virtually unrelated  stories.  The result is a whirlwind of disjointed jump cuts that distracts  the viewer from the only engaging storyline, namely the production of Marc  Blitzstein's play.  The disparate barrage of stories, assembled carefully  to wax nostalgic about the leftist movement, had little appeal to anyone  but those with a predilection to such waxing.  For everyone else, it just  diluted the effectiveness of the main storyline, which is a pity because it  was a good human interest story.
That story shows a young Orson Welles  directing a new play sympathetic to the labor movement.  The play and the  federal theater program come under scrutiny of the U.S. Government.  The  play is closed down on opening night and federal troops sent to barricade  the doors of the theater, because the play is believed to have a communist  message.
In a defiant act, Welles finds another theater and herds the  audience from the front door of the garrisoned theater to the new one where  the play is to be performed as a one man show by the author, the only man  not in the union.  All the other actors are under orders not to perform  lest they lose their jobs, a daunting thought in depression times.  The  play goes on with a dramatic and uplifting twist at the end.
The whole  ensemble did a terrific job.  All the actors gave wonderful performances,  though they needed to find someone with a voice better than Emily Watson's  for the singing role.  Though I have been critical of John Turturro in the  past (`Illuminata' for instance) his was a standout performance in a very  talented ensemble.  Ruben Blades was also terrific as the eccentric Diego  Rivera.
Overall, it was a decent effort at tackling a subject that simply  no longer has an audience.  Robbins did a good job on the period props and  sets, and the scenes brought forth frankly many of the real issues of the  day (with a decidedly leftward slant).  But the film dissipates itself on  irrelevant scenes designed to serve as a catharsis for every perceived  injustice and admiration Robbins held for the times.  That jihad annuls  some good performances by rendering the film a mediocre hodgepodge.
I  rated the film a 6/10.  It had greater potential but flubbed it.  If you  are a staunch conservative capitalist type, don't waste your time with this  film.  It will just aggravate you.  If you long for the days of passionate  liberal activism, you will love it, but if you are just looking for  entertainment, you will probably be disappointed.",960768000,2,3393,4.787826086956522

7896536,4,6305810079,"I had to watch this film for a college theatre course dealing with censorship, and really enjoyed it. There are not many films of this scope that I like as much. The reason, I think, is that these movies that have so many subplots that feed into the main plot are usually so busy that they are hard to follow, or they treat each subplot so sparsely that they all seem half-baked and poorly treated. Tim Robbins seems to have the right combination, and treats each character and subplot with enough detail to keep the audience wanting more, switching scenes at strategic points that kept me glued to the film without pausing it during its entire run.

The movie makes it clear that a federal theatre probably would never work in a republic like America, because art demands complete freedom of expression. And no matter how well-intended a federally-funded theatre may claim to be, there will always be those controlling the purse-strings that will want to dictate what can and cannot be done with the money. Socialism as an idea was something that people at that time were looking into as an idea and so naturally themes of socialism were creeping into some of the work that was being created.

While some boundaries can be good for artistic creativity, it will backfire if seen by the artistic community as oppressive or governed by commerce or other less-than-pure motives. That is why these artists eventually came together and worked around the restrictions placed on them that were intended to halt the performance, and created an impromptu performance of this musical from the house.

It was a very inspiring movie, and there were a few artistic touches I enjoyed. One was the dispute between Diego Rivera painting the mural filled with communist imagery in one of John Rockefellers buildings. Another was the childrens beaver play being suspected of communist propaganda (which it may arguably have been, although not intentionally). And I liked the touch of having the ghost of Bertolt Brecht accompanying Marc Blitzsteins wifes ghost as inspirations for the direction he takes in writing and composing the play.

I had not heard of this incident in the history of the WPA, or this movie about it, and it seems to have gotten a ho-hum reaction at the box office and by the critics. But I thoroughly enjoyed it, and would watch it again. It's worth a look if you like movies set in the post-WWII era or are a theatre buff.",1483747200,,2429,4.776190476190476
