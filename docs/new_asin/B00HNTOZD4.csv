6191719,1,B00HNTOZD4,"Sorry, but this story was poorly written, in my opinion. It does have a strong and interesting storyline, which is what appeals to people, but I just feel that the story wasn't developed properly. Throughout the whole movie I kept wondering what the title, Down by the River, had to do with the story because there isn't any reference or connection made in regards to the title, other than the book that the main character ends up writing at the end of the movie, which is titled Down by the River. The ending also could've used some additional scenes explaining some events because I was left wondering how certain things happened. For instance, towards the end the main character is shown in bed very depressed about the girl's death, then starts arguing with his girlfriend who is trying to cheer him up and would like for him to help other families who are in a similar situation, but he ends up asking her to leave, and then continues with his depressed mood. But then the story jumps to a scene of the opening of a new clinic, which was named after the deceased girl, then the main character offers a speech regarding the girl. I would've liked to see how he got over his depression so quickly, enabling him to attend the opening of the new clinic because those two scenes back to back just didn't do it for me, a viewer can't assume that -  ""Oh, he got over his depression, how nice"" - that's something that needs to be shown. This happened throughout the movie, just not giving enough information. Also, at the end of the film, he is shown his newly published book by someone who is not introduced and we are left to assume that the person is a publisher of sorts, I guess, then he tells the person he has one thing to do, and walks out of the office...then he is shown walking through the woods...until he comes to a river...he sits on a tree trunk, with his freshly published book in hand and just looks at the river...at this point it's very difficult if not impossible to know what he's thinking about because nothing is shown to give us a clue. Is he thinking about the girl? Does the river have a special meaning for him? Don't know. I would like to see this movie again just to make sure that I got all the facts correctly, and that I'm not giving a 'good' movie and 'bad' review, after all the movie did get such great reviews from so many viewers, which is what convinced me to watch it in the first place. If I'm wrong, then I'll change my review, but for now I'll keep the review as it is.",1462060800,5,2508,4.358974358974359

6191721,4,B00HNTOZD4,Simple but compelling movie about family.  The acting is better than expected but it is the story line that really grabs you at the onset.  The ending could have been different but it left me wanting more.,1461801600,,205,4.513513513513513

6191775,5,B00HNTOZD4,"Very touching film  The story was sad but also funny at times as another reviewer commented.  You can tell that the film had a small budget, there were some things that could have been improved upon, but overall I agree that the small budget family type production added to what made it great.  The only complaint that I had is that the actual disease, Sickle Cell Disease, that Hanna suffered from was not mentioned until close to the end of the film.  That may have been done on purpose to take away from the medical side of it and focus on the heart and emotion of what the family was going through, but I would have liked to see more attention brought to the disease early on to bring more awareness.",1454630400,,704,4.351145038167939
