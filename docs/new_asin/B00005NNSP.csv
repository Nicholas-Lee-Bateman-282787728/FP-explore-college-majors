1636869,5,B00005NNSP,"Irish Tour the film. What can one say. This film depicts what we have been listening to these past 28 years on the vinyl record double album then titled Irish Tour '74. To be honest if you come from Cork City,like I do it makes the film that little bit more sentimental. Viewing old footage of Cork City and remembering these shops when I was younger just like Rory,it brings back lots of fond memories indeed. The film is fantastic in so far as we get to go backstage with the band in the dressing rooms,tuning the guitar for Rory,the old bottles of Guinness being drunk,and the band hanging out with their old buddies in Cork. We see Rory and Donal walking the streets of Belfast in the height of the troubles. Probably what stands out for me really is the great relationship two brothers shared. It must have been some buzz for both Rory as the performer and Donal as manager to successfully steer his career from these early,almost primitive days in 1974 to what he finally achieved before his sad and untimely death in 1995. It's obvious they had a special relationship. The concert footage is also a great insight into the Ireland of that particular time. It's hard to explain to people outside of Ireland,but what the Gallagher brothers(the original Gallagher Brothers) were doing back in those days was the start of something huge. Rory has influnced U2 along the way,among others. This film is a must have for any self respecting music fan,let alone Rory fan. Do yourself a favour,go out and buy it before it's all sold out.",1021939200,7,1533,4.619047619047619

1636871,4,B00005NNSP,"This is a must for any Rory fan. To see him walk into a music store, pull an acoustic guitar off a hook, create magical music and then leave is spectacular. Seeing him with his distictly un-rock-star entourage is refreshing. No guitar techs here - you get to see the band change their own strings. The onstage moments highlight his virtuoso playing, and that of the band. The film however is not without faults. To see Rory wailing onstage with closeups of his face misses the point. There should have been more shots of his great guitar technique in action. Some crowd reaction scenes are recycled which lessens the feeling that you are watching a live event. Some shots from behind the band are not synched with the music playing (although you do have to look closesly to tell). But that said, this is the record of Rory Gallagher that we have. If you love blues/rock playing you have to own this DVD.",1010793600,,903,4.54601226993865

1636873,5,B00005NNSP,"This is a classic performance of Rory Gallagher Irish Tour 74.  A film ( documentary) by Tony Palmer released for `cinema' in 1974,capturing the high energy of these concerts. Rory At his best!! This DVD is a great gift for all fans.  The `documentary' shows the band`s members before the concert,jokes,jams sessions and Rory in a musical instrument store trying acoustic guitars and others curiosities.  The song `A Million Miles Away 'is absolutely great !!Rory isn`t forgot.  The image isn`t a digital perfection (remember, this concert was in 1974,recorded for a `movie' documentary),but the quality and the sound are good for me,worth see and buy this rare Rory`s performance.( Remastered in 5.1 surround sound ).  This DVD have discography informations and  a `bonus' session recorded Live in Japan 1974. A blured image,but rare.  83 minutes of the best`s Rory Gallagher concerts !!!  27 Years to see this,until now !!At last.",996796800,11,932,5.166666666666667
1636884,5,B00005NNSP,"I read a few reviews from this section before acquiring the DVD, an album/CD that has always been a favourite since I saw Rory here in New Zealand way back in 1974. That was a concert in an unheralded tour that is still the best I have enjoyed. The unpretentiousness, energy and musicalness was remarkable.  The reviews of the DVD here seemed slightly cautionary despite their great respect for one of the all time great rock guitarists and musicians. The caution seemed aimed at the production. However, I am thrilled I bought it. The music of course is great and some of the tracks seem more ""live"" than the CD, while some are in fact interesting different versions from the CD. The video of course enables us to see the craftmanship and the sheer involvement that Rory has with his music and playing. But the production adds an extra dimension and Tony Palmer should be congratulated and not doubted. The continuity between songs is clever (and related, subtley introducing the next track) and insightful to being on the road or displying Rory's knowledge, skill and respectful and neighbourly character. There is some wonderful behind-the-scene and pub jamming. This is not a simply a video of one of the all time great music CDs. It is crafted with very thoughtful continuity to capture a great musician in his natural (geographical and medium) habitat. It is 1974 after all and about the concerts and music to match being there and not with our supposedly sophisticated hi-fidelty, lounge comfort and ""air-brush"" perspective on everyhting.

1636885,5,B00005NNSP,"I plugged this DVD into the player to let it run in the background while I was busy at other stuff. The intro music caught my attention and I left what I was doing to take a look. I was glued to the TV until the DVD finished and I just sat mesmerized. It is testimony to the quality of this product that the only criticism levelled at it relates to the second rate camerawork or the poor editing. The music scene in Ireland in 1974 was light years from what it is today, and playing the City Hall was as good as it got in Cork. One look at the backstage conditions and the state of the band's gear and one can imagine that they were probably lucky to have two decent cameras at any gig, so there probably isn't a ton of footage to edit from.

That aside, the tracks on this DVD, and the quality of the music show Rory Gallagher at his best. Tattoo'd Lady, A Million Miles Away, Who's that Coming all brought back great memories of my youth in Cork. I was 11 years old in 1974 and the footage of downtown Cork and Cobh is the way that I remember that place. The music is an even more powerful memory. Rory was a huge hero for us at a time when Cork was in a downward economic slide and our few treasured LP's at the time were so much more valuable to us that the hundreds of throwaway CD's we have today.

And the man himself? An unpretentious, enormously talented genius. His talent and love of the music oozes from this video. He walks the streets of Cork - just another bloke barely recognized by passers by, except for a great scene where he signs some kid's wrist, who in turn gives him a respect-filled pat on the back.

We used to be so proud that one of our own was the ""second best guitarist in the world"" - after God know who, maybe Clapton. After watching this DVD I know he wasn't second best. I cannot think of anybody, living or dead, who is better. If you're a Rory Gallagher fan, this is a must. If you're new to this legend, it's a great place to start.",1140912000,11,1969,4.109090909090909
1636886,5,B00005NNSP,"Back in 1976 when I was a teenager, I lived in Germany and

happened to watch Rockpalast Live on the TV. I was impressed by

Rory Gallagher and tried to buy CD's and Video. It was very

difficult to buy them when I moved back to Korea.

Rory Gallagher is a straight forward Blues guitarist with Irish

feel. My impression of Rory Gallagher is ""Rory talks and

communicates his thought and feeling with his guitar in the for

of Blues.""

Most important numbers of Rory Gallagher in his early days are

in the DVD. Sound is also nicely mastered and transfers

atmosphere of the live hall in a full scale even in a living

room.

Not only live music videos are nice, but also backstage talks

and introduction of his day-to-day life was also interesting.

Matter of fact, Rory Gallagher appeas to me ""Shy"" when he is

not on stage.

The contents, Music and ordinary life of Rory Gallagher, in

this DVD is well balanced.

I was happy to find this DVD after tens of years looking for it.",1122940800,12,983,4.396648044692737

1636888,4,B00005NNSP,"Great stuff.  Worth it if only for the shots of and Rory's comments on playing Belfast which was a bombed out shell no one would play in the 70's. But there's much more for your dollar here.  Appears as if the the pal shooting the footage had limits on how much good footage he ended up with.  Too many cutaways and shots from behind which obviously are not from the song he is playing at the moment, even to the extent that he's wearing a different shirt and playing a different guitar.  The movie kicks in about a quarter of the way through his landmark performance of WALK ON HOT COALS and I miss the well structured and rousing opening of the song which gives way to an extended jam and improv.  Too bad STOMPING GROUND wasn't filmed, very few recordings of this and it would have been great to have had it documented on film.  Other than all that, it's Rory being who he was...  inspired, fun and deeply rooted in his music.  His integrity shines so brightly.  Even as one of his band mates puts a bucket of foot powder in his sneakers before the gig.  Rory's comments on his music and the direction of music at the moment are priceless but the music speaks for itself.  He was one of a kind, played like a master and we miss him.  Buy this thing and enjoy yourself.",1120089600,7,1271,4.2719665271966525
1636889,5,B00005NNSP,"No one reading this needs to be persuaded that Rory Gallagher is one of the greatest rock musicians of the 70's, so I won't go there.  You are reading because you want to know if this DVD is worth the $. The footage of Gallagher playing live is a beautiful gift from Tony Palmer.  How much Gallagher footage have you seen?  I have read complaints that the camera doesn't focus enough on the musicians' hands, but this is not an instructional video.  Working with limited camera budget, Palmer chooses instead to create a sense of what it was like to be at the shows.  He also splices in footage of Ireland in ways that beautifully fit the themes of the lyrics and melodies. It almost lost one star in my rating because there are two or three scenes where the music and footage are from disparate sources.  While this seemed to work in the `80s, we contemporary viewers can tell when a drummer is playing on the beat.  Don't let this dissuade you, though. This is an incredible and much needed document, which I expect to watch repeatedly.  (I've already seen it twice-and I bought it today).",1115510400,,1091,4.50253807106599
1636890,2,B00005NNSP,"Rory Gallagher is a great musician. It's just only to bad that  this dvd mostly focused it's attention on the band members faces while performing instead on showing the large picture,

them actually playing their instruments.

If you like Rory Gallagher's music as I do, do your self a favor and get his cd's or you can buy this dvd and listen to the music while you relax with your eyes closed.",1110672000,5,395,4.458333333333333
1636891,5,B00005NNSP,"Let me first say I've been a BIG Rory fan since 1973. Luckily, I saw him play about a dozen times. The absolute best live music I ever heard in my life were those 4 shows at the Bottom Line in NYC; where I had a seat right next to the stage about 3 feet from Rory. I wish to God someone had filmed that !! Anyway, ANY film of Rory playing will show a supreme musician and be more interesting than 99% of the garbage out now. Irish Tour 74 looks like it was shot on a limited budget and has quirky editing... perhaps it is intended to be that way. I also wish that there were more cameras employed to show different views ( from the audience, overhead, etc. ). My biggest ""complaint"" is using parts of songs from different shows edited together. It breaks up the continuity of the music for me and is a distraction. I have to agree I'm disappointed with not showing Rory's fingers flying up and down the fretboard, especially on the GREAT, GREAT end solo to ""Tatooed Lady"". I keep thinking to myself I could have made a movie Rory's fans would have liked much better. Having said that... it's still a very good portrait of Rory, his bandmates, slices of Ireland and of a time that is gone forever.",1104105600,4,1196,4.25
1636892,5,B00005NNSP,"I'm from the US and it is quite obvious from the UK-centered reviews that this dvd is held under greater scrutiny, probably because folks in britain were fortunate enough to be able to see this INCREDIBLE guitarist in his prime while, for whatever reason, Rory Gallagher remains in this country anyway, an afterthought when it comes to classic rock(?), and an unheared-of genius (much like Roy Buchanan). Do yourself a favor and BUY THIS DVD! If you have come this far in your couriosity about Rory Gallagher, then you have reached the point at which you CAN make up your mind! Rory Gallagher is AWSOME and you will not be able to deny this after watching this dvd. Yes the footage is dated, but the HEART (IRISH HEART) is there!",1074816000,7,729,4.615384615384615
1636915,2,B00005NNSP,"I love Rory Gallagher. The picture quality is great, the sound is great, but the way in which the programme has been edited is frustrating.
Every time the camera should include the guitar in shot all we see is Rorys face!
As a musician this winds me up immensely. I want to see him play and see his brilliant technique. This is an awesome gig, only problem is you cant see it!
1st class in all other respects, but for me the DVD gets only 2 stars.
Surely I'm not the only person with this major gripe?",1074211200,10,501,4.175257731958763
1636916,4,B00005NNSP,"Unfortunately, it's impossible to capture Rory's talent and genuine character completely in an 80 minute film, but this comes very close.
The concert footage is spectacular...Rory at his finest. No frills, no gimmicks, just the man playing his heart out, getting the crowd moving, and enjoying every minute of it.
But the highlight of the film wasn't just the concert. Rory as a person comes across as humble, down to earth and extremely reserved (that is unless you were a fan who wanted to chat or get an autograph). The lack of groupies, drugs (if you don't factor in the cases of Guinness), and VIP big-shot rock stars was refreshing and I can't put into words how I felt watching him play in Belfast, considering that the city was a war zone at the time. How can you not love the guy?
I can't overstate my praise for ""Irish Tour '74"" but, I must criticize the sound. Concert footage was fine, but you could barely hear the interviews without changing the volume on your TV drastically. Anyway, I digress...
You want a kickin' rock show, a guitar virtuoso and a working class hero? Get this DVD.",1073520000,3,1099,4.612244897959184
1636917,5,B00005NNSP,"We Roryfans know precious little about the thoughtful and private man whose music we love so well. For now this long-delayed (on this side of the ocean) and oft-bootlegged Tony Palmer feature will do nicely to educate and entertain and for others it will serve as a terrific introduction. The personality and philosophy of Rory as well as his incendiary talent are on full display here, the concert performances, the backstage moments, walking the streets in Cork, Dublin and Belfast. A marvellous monument which in its own way rivals his blistering Rockpalast 1976 show. HIGHLY recommended whether you're a novice or long time Roryfan.",1073260800,2,636,5.125
1636918,2,B00005NNSP,"What a dilemma! This DVD contains footage from some immensely brilliant playing by Rory, however the editing is an absolute TRAVESTY. The person who edited the concert footage is quite clearly oblivious to the reason why people liked Rory. The guitar is NEVER in shot during ANY of the exquisite, intense, immaculate, blinding soloing! Seriously, NOT ONCE!
This is the most ridiculous and irritating waste of time as far as I'm concerned. Surely I'm not the only one whos noticed this?
Why wasn't it re-edited from the original footage??
Some of the footage is priceless though. Rory demonstrates different styles of playing in an interview for example...and YES the guitar IS in shot for once. The doc demonstrates what a down to earth man Rory was, but as a visual demonstration of his unique style this dissapoints severly. Why is there no option to watch the whole gig for example.
C'mon this should have been a LOT better.
The Video at the Cork Opera House is therefore far superior, (even though I don't tend to like anything recorded in the 80s) and is recommended instead of this.
An absolute waste of what should have been the ultimate footage of an incredible talent. 5 stars if it had been reedited and the whole gig was here as it is ...2 stars.",1069718400,6,1257,4.718181818181818
1636919,5,B00005NNSP,"Rory Gallagher is quite possibly the most criminally underrated guitarist from the seventies.  He has been described as the Irish version of Eric Clapton or Johnny Winter.  Like these two guitarists he is comfortable playing blues or rock but he can also play in a more folk oriented style or even a jazzier style if the situation warrants it. This documentary of his 1974 Irish Tour should go a long way to rectify the situation.  While Gallagher's reputation may have suffered due to his fear of flying and his humble nature, his playing more than speaks for itself.  This fact is evident during the interviews and non-concert footage from the DVD.  Gallagher's primary motivation appears to be the music and his fans, not the money and acclaim.  Rory appears almost embarrassed at times about his fame and while taking the time to sign autographs for his fans he appears almost shy.  His stage apparel of jeans and a checkered shirt and battered Stratocaster are legendary and further prove that he is not on some sort of star trip.
The music itself is both incendiary and emotion filled.  Aided by long time bassist Gerry McAvoy along with former Killing Floor members Rod de'Ath on drums and Lou Martin on keyboards Gallagher succeeds in translating the live concert experience to disk.  The concert itself contains three numbers ""Hands Up"", ""Going To My Home Town"" and the raucous encore ""Bullfrog Blues"" lamentably not issued on the compact disk version of the ""Irish Tour 1974"".  Gallagher is adept at both acoustic and electric guitars as evidenced by his acoustic cover of Tony Joe White's ""As The Crow Flies"".  Rory was also an excellent slide guitarist and ""Who's That Coming"" provides a testiment to his slide guitar playing.  His emotional reading of the slow blues ""A Million Miles Away"" is another highlight.  The smile on Rory's face during the concert shows the viewer that he is both having a great time, which translates to the audience and is emotionally involved in the music.  The concert footage is alternated with footage of Ireland and areas where Rory performed and grew up.  This allows the viewer to identify with Gallagher's struggle to get his music heard outside of his native Ireland.  Commentary is provided by both bassist Gerry McAvoy and Rory's brother and manager Donal.  Some of the most interesting non-concert footage is of Gallagher jamming with the band before the concert and explaining the various styles and techniques he uses on both the acoustic and electric guitars.  He also seems amused while shopping at a music store to find sheet music for some of his songs with his first band Taste.
I highly recommend this to fans of great blues and rock guitar playing.  Rory Gallagher fans will find this essential due to the dearth of available live Gallagher footage and the three unissued versions of songs from the Irish Tour 1974. The film also provides valuable insights into Rory's background and personality. It also enhances the legacy of one of Ireland's greatest musicians.",1059264000,49,3026,4.921259842519685

It begins with scenes of the sea thrusting into the Irish coast and then makes its way into a spellbound onstage version of 'Walk On Hot Coals'. Rory Gallagher was definitely the most under-rated blues-rock guitarist of all time; this DVD is proof of it. His style and tone are both blustery and unrefined, but natural and brown-toned as well. His band of himself on vocal and guitar (mainly a strat player), Gerry McAvoy (bass), Lou Martin (piano), and Rod de'Ath (drums), is loud and raw blues-rock heaven. The backstage interviews are interesting, too, as they show how electrified and personable he was. It's blatantly obvious how much he loved playing live by the huge smile on his face and the way he interacts with the crowd. The scenes of Belfast and the rough old Irish nightclubs and venues just add to the raw beauty of the music. This one will be all worn out by the time I'm done watching it and listening to it.

it's nice to here rory talk to the fans, and to the movie interviewer. about how he plays certain guitars, uses his slide, etc...you just can't help, but like this guy! you can just see how nice and humble he really was!
the mixing on this dvd is great for something almost 30 years old.you can really crank it up! ""cradle rock"", and ""tatoo lady"" sound very nice!

This was filmed in 1974, folks!  Nobody knew it would make its way to a high-definition format that didn't even exist at that time!  Personally, I think the sound matches the somewhat rough video and adds to the ""age"" of the experience.

The concert itself is very good.  It shows Rory in his earlier years, before he really became big.  (Sadly, he never became as big/ popular as he deserved to become.)  It is a great look back in time, and I'm sure you will watch it many times if you choose to buy it.

7947742,5,B00005NNSP,"First off, this is NOT a concert DVD. It's kind of a documentary mixed together with fantastic, and complete live songs. And it's NOT a full video of the Irish Tour '74 album. With that being said, it's a great, great film. It shows amazing live magic of these classic songs:

Walk On Hot Coals
Tatoo'd Lady
Who's That Comming
A Million Miles Away
Going To My Home Town
Cradle Rock
As The Crow Flies
Hands Up
Bullfrog Blues

All the songs are full versions except ""Walk on Hot Coals,"" which comes first, and starts halfway through the song with the beginning titles. The concert is done in a small town hall and I think that's just brilliant. Seeing Rory,Rod,Gerry and Lou up on that small stage, with Rory's Vox amplifier just sitting on a chair at the back with his jacket on top of it, it's just so natural and raw. They all look so real in their jeans and t-shirts, they all play with tons of energy, like Rod, who goes nuts on those drums and looks like he's gonna cry; lots of passion in his playing. All of them are amazing musicians;they have to be amazing to play with Rory Gallagher. I'm watching it as I type this review, and I'll tell you, I don't have many music DVDs that I could watch all day, every day for a month. I'm serious.

One thing this DVD gives you that other Rory DVDs don't, is exclusive real footage of Rory walking down the street, going into a pub to get a drink, and walking into a music store to try out some guitars. It's also got backstage footage of him and the band, and a few minutes of footage of the guys jamming before the show. There's also a few times where Rory explains some of the techniques he uses when playing certain songs, and he talks about the different guitars he uses. You really get a taste of what he was like as a person; an amazing talent, but also a guy that wasn't afraid to have a drink with you or talk to some fans. You don't find too many guys like him in todays bunch of arogant artists.

""Walk On Hot Coals"" is one of my favourites.""Who's That Comi'n"" and ""Bullforg Blues"" are also great (especially ""Bullfrog Blues"" with solos from every band member). I love how during each of the guy's solo, they show a little clip of them back stage having fun. They show Rory laughing with a glass of whisky in his hand, Rod putting powder on his feet so he won't sweat. It really shows you that Rory was just a humble good old guy on the inside.

This DVD is great and if you're a Rory Gallagher fan, You need this. If anyone says Rory wasn't the best guitarist ever, they're wrong. God bless Rory.",1216684800,,2555,4.25979381443299

7947744,5,B00005NNSP,"This is probably the best music DVD that I have ever watched. This shows Rory Gallagher from the very beginning to almost the very end of his life. It shows with the changes in equipment times of prosperity, and periods of time with low amounts of money. It doesn't matter what year of the DVD that you are watching, you will get a rip-roaring good concert, and I guarantee you that. Rory Gallagher, to me, was one of the very best guitarists of all time.

The day that Rory died was one of the very saddest days of my life, along with the death of Jimi Hendrix, in 1970. The world lost one of the very nicest performers that ever graced the stages around the world. He was always very shy, but he could play any of the mryiad types and styles of guitar based rock and roll.

The way that Rory was able to make that beat-up Stratocaster sing, was just amazing. Rory was never one to play, using flashy or new guitars. Throughout his too short career, he stuck with that Stratocaster which now resides with Rory's brother in Ireland. There are many guitarists playing now who were very much influenced by Rory's playing style. One that is now one of the most well known guitarists, The Edge, shaped a lot of his playing style, from listening and watching Rory.

Too me, this DVD was worth at least 3 times the price that they are charging for it. I just wish that during his life, that he would have known just what he meant to this world. His straight Blues playing, and his impeccable slide playing was just masterful. I watch this DVD at least once every week without fail. If you buy this DVD, I truly believe that you will get as much enjoyment out of it as I do.",1199059200,,1667,4.319488817891374

Anyone with no particular knowledge of Rory Gallagher the man, but with a love for the music he played on this tour will probably be better off with the CD ( and a great CD it is too ! ) .. prabably his least ""bluesy"" recording

But anyone who was touched by Rory Gallagher, and appreciated, loved and respected everything he was, stood and worked for, will not be watching this video with a critical eye, but probably a misty one.

This ""film"" (if you consider it a documentary rather than a concert video, you will feel more comfortable with the quality issues ) shows our modest hero performing a fantastic concert('s actually), in times and conditions that you could not possibly contemplate having listened to the CD. How can such a great concert come from town halls with no facilities, bouncers telling kids to sit down, a 13amp extension board for all the power .... it is an amazing tribute to the band that they produced such an incendiary set from such basic ammenities. I bought this DVD at the same time as aerosmith, Ha ! .... talk about POLAR opposites in terms of resources. ( no criticism of Steve and the boys, BTW)

The sound in this film is actually really good .. Rod D'arths drumming is actually brilliant despite the fact that he looks like he is going to burst into tears at any moment. Lou Martin is no mean keyboard player either and all round, these were some HUGELY talented guys.

I don't care if the thing is not up to todays standards technically ... it is like comparing the original KING KING movie to ther latest version. The original may look a bit dated, but it had originality, flare, imagination, enthusiasm and energy and all the modern recording capabilities will NEVER make up for the lack in any of those departments.

I will never listen to ""Irish tour 1974"" again without seeing this film, and for that, it is worth every penny.",1165190400,2,2017,4.542699724517906
