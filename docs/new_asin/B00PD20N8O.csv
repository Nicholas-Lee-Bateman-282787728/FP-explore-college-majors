6798026,2,B00PD20N8O,"This DVD was to me a bit misleading, I purchased it mostly because I am a fan of Marianne and Deepak.  The appearances of Marianne Williamson and Deepak Chopra as well as the others noted were cameo only.  It is not a DVD which shows a panel of spiritual leaders having a thought provoking conversation, I guess that's what I was hoping for, so I should have done more research before purchasing.  What you really get for $22.00 are random snapshots of citizens simply sharing their belief of what God is.  It's not all together bad just IMHO not worth $22.00",1419897600,8,559,4.5049504950495045

6798029,2,B00PD20N8O,"Pretty dull. This is an overview of the different ways the world thinks about God. I wonder who will buy this? Neale Donald Walsch fans? (like me) and other non-mainstream believers? Is it a stretch to think that those believing in mainstream religion will? I do hope Mr. Walsch and team continue to create films, but I hope the next isn't so bland.",1418169600,4,349,4.555555555555555

6798031,5,B00PD20N8O,"I found this movie extremely engaging and thought provoking. An intelligent exploration of the primal human drive to connect with a Divine Force, to belong - the Age Old quest for higher understanding, purpose, meaning and reason - Humanity's inherent nature to seek to know thyself, producing various conceptualizations of God throughout its history. Not a political movie. Not a religious movie. This film does not coerce into dismantling the notion of God in any way, nor does it insult or offend any belief system. Just facts and sincere inquiries. A must-see for non-believers and believers of any fate.

Why a must-see for all? Humanity rarely questions or examines, if at all, that all societal structures on this planet today, regardless geographic regions, history, culture, traditions, belief systems - are built and operate on the infrastructure of a millennia old principles and understandings of the world theologies combined. That is, the way our ancestors conceptualized the entity called GOD and what they thought God is, wants or demands - is reflected in our laws, political structures, value systems and behavior, even when we engage in warfare. Correction: Especially when we go to war.

In other words: Our planet is in the shape it is in today, as a direct result of how we conceptualize and define God, whether we believe in one, or not. The movie does not make that statement, nor statements about war. I did, having arrived to that personal conclusion after seeing it. You may arrive at another.

The documentary places a mirror before us, by illuminating who we are as a species through the exploration of where we have been spiritually, how hard we tried, where we are now, and where we say we want to go.

But most importantly, it made me beg the question: Why haven't we arrived there yet?

The whole film kept me thinking about one simple question: What is it about God (or the idea thereof, that we insist on) that we didn't, can't, or wouldn't quite get, the understanding of which will fix everything we strive so hard for, but keep braking into pieces since the dawn of man?

I feel the film came out at a time when our planet is undergoing an extremely critical cycle of radical change. A time of subtle undercurrent of increasing social unrest, political changes across the globe and the ever present human frustration that Happiness, Security, Peace and the Holy Experience prove to be more elusive for our species than ever. We now simply know too much about the physical world through the power of science to reconcile in our minds and hearts the discrepancies in our millennia old theologies, and yet we cling to them for dear life, regardless our war ridden history, for perhaps part of the Human Experience demands knowing God or die trying.

Or does it?

Again: What is it about God we love, must have, but don't understand - which if grasped, will produce the world we say we want to create?

The exploration in this film brought into focus for me, through my own individual prism as a viewer, why all the systems we have in place to improve life on earth continue to fail us on a massive level by producing the exact opposite effect.

I will let you reach your own conclusions. For me - this movie made one thing clear: As long as we continue to misplace the notion of God, an authentic God-experience will remain elusive, we will continue to maintain a certain level of confusion about the answers to questions asked in the film, we'll continue to drift further away from everything that is dear to us, including the quest to know thyself, for we will continue to look for God where God can not be found - outside ourselves, while killing ""thy neighbor"" in the process. And as long as we refuse to explore and refuse to update our ancient understanding of God to match this otherwise spectacular age of technology, science and human endeavor - we will continue to go against our own Maker, until we meet him collectively (that is, annihilate ourselves).

The good news: Real solutions are interwoven in the gently asked questions in the film, should we find the courage to acknowledge our blind spots about who or what God is, what (if anything) God wants, and who or what we are in relation to that, which God is.

One last thing - this movie greatly complimented Mr Walsch's latest book I recently purchased: ""God's Message to the World: You've Got Me All Wrong"". If you get both of these together - you have a tremendous, highly recommended duo, which, if implemented by Humanity, can truly change the world. And that is: Overnight.

Enjoy.

Or continue killing each other trying.

The choice is ours.

Thank you.",1417651200,18,4662,4.744128553770087
6798032,5,B00PD20N8O,"I LOVE this documentary. Most documentaries I watch have very polarized views and usually it's the proponent digging up evidence against the other side and can lead to a 2 hour bashing ceremony. NOT HERE! Finally, I have seen what a documentary truly is. A gathering of all facts and information from contrasting view points and a gentle inquiry of questions that lead us to our own personal truth. I am so happy I bought this documentary and I love it!!!

I am only 40 minutes in, and about to go to sleep. I'll finish the rest tomorrow and if anything changes or it becomes polarized; I'll be sure to hop back on and change my review... The reason why I am so excited and happy about this documentary is because it asks questions that need to be looked at in order for humanity to function in Harmony. Knowing the history of religion and how the perception of God came to be is so important to explaining why the world is the way it is today (good or bad). This is a documentary that can impact our century in big ways if people watch it with an open mind and truly inquire about the questions asked.",1417651200,9,1102,4.349514563106796
6798033,3,B00PD20N8O,"Love Neale and CWG but this was off topic. It is about how we all have different beliefs, I already knew that. Hate to say bad things, just my honest opinion. I would pass on this one.",1458345600,,184,4.0

6798035,3,B00PD20N8O,"It's an okay movie, but somewhat disappointing...nothing outstanding or very deep. It is, perhaps, best suited for people who have traditional religious beliefs and have not really challenged their beliefs or contemplated that there might be other ways of perceiving or interpreting God. If you've explored your own religious/spiritual beliefs to any degree, this movie might be too basic and somewhat dull for you.

The main folks who appear in this movie (Marianne Williamson, Deepak Chopra, Neale Donald Walsch, Alan Cohen, Barbara Marx Hubbard, and Michael Lerner), talked only briefly and with the exception of Marianne Williamson, didn't have anything particularly interesting or new to say. The movie, by the way, was written by and co-produced by Neale Donald Walsch, and I expected something more thought-provoking than what was presented.",1455494400,,848,5.523076923076923
6798036,2,B00PD20N8O,"I was very excited to watch this film, but pretty quickly that enthusiasm faded away. I have watched lots of documentaries that attempt to do a comparative religion focus, or try to speak about what spirituality is really all about.  As a pretty educated person, I can handle these topics pretty well.  The problem with this film is it began a big huge jumble.  Too much information was crammed in too quickly with very little time to assimilate and digest the points.  In the end it was a huge spiritual smorgasbord without any really understanding or synthesis.  Instead of this film I would recommend the Global Spirit series (also found in part here on Amazon), and the film I AM.  You might even want to check out Oprah's latest BELIEF series, which aired on OWN (the Oprah Winfrey Network) just before I wrote this review in 10/2015.  They were of much more superior quality to this film.  I would let this one go.",1446249600,4,920,4.601226993865031
6798037,5,B00PD20N8O,"Very fun and well put together film about the importance of the concept of God in society. A concept that affects all of us, regardless if we are people of faith or not. It is reflected, often unconsciously, in our morals and even our laws. How does the idea of a revengeful, punishing God makes us different people in society, than if we hold the idea of a forgiving God that lives mostly in our actions and thoughts? What I truly appreciate is the well balanced blend of voices heard from religious leaders, New Age thinkers and people from the street. This is what really makes the movie. An extra plus for bringing in an atheist as well (from my home country Sweden no less :)). For those that are into Big New Age Names there are many treats here: Marianne Williamson, Deepak Chopra, Niel Donald Walch ... Interviews and discussions with them taking on a relaxed form with lots of content. I think this should be an introductory film to studies about belief and religion in school classes and study groups of all ages. Not because it in any ways have the answers, but because it asks them and then let you make up your own mind.",1444780800,,1133,4.451923076923077

6798048,5,B00PD20N8O,"It's time we started talking about God (Source Energy, Divine Intelligence, Unconditional Love, the name doesn't matter).....time to stop looking outside ourselves for answers. The answers are all within. We are each a divine aspect of the One; this means we inherently receive and 'are'  abundance, love, health and joy. We just need to clear out our false beliefs & negative energies, to discover the diamonds within. Not easy, but definitely do-able with focused intent. It is an inside job.

8687632,4,B00PD20N8O,"Virginia writer director Jonathan Friedman is perhaps best known for his CONVERSTIONS WITH GOD books, but his talents extend far beyond that. He earned a degree in Mass Communications for James Madison University and has extended his knowledge into the fields of writer, musician, graphic designer and filmmaker (witness his popular film MOVING). He also is the successful creator of award winning commercials.

For this film Jonathan probes the question of the beginning of all things  the creator, God. Using the popular and accessible iPhone, iTab, etc he brings the discussion of the essence of God into the contemporary terms. iGOD explores various belief systems about God that have evolved into what exists in the present day, and then delves into the many questions about God that so many people have asked throughout history  that essential human drive to connect with a Divine Force, to belong - the Age Old quest for higher understanding, purpose, meaning and reason - Humanity's inherent nature to seek to know thyself, producing various conceptualizations of God throughout its history.

Unbiased and applicable to everyone no matter their faith system or lack of one, iGOD is particularly meaningful during this Easter season. Watch and listen and think and reach your own conclusions. Grady Harp, March 16",1458864000,,1320,5.241706161137441
