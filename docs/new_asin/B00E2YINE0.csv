8600444,5,B00E2YINE0,"Jean Shepherd was America's greatest story teller, and one of its greatest ever humorists. For many Americans, Shepherd will be remembered only for having written and narrated The Christmas Story.  For others, the lucky others, he will be remembered for two remarkable decades of story telling on WOR radio in New York, beginning in the 1950s and running through the 1970s.  To have experienced the magic of his voice in a dark room coming in through an old tube radio was to experience a visitation from God's slightly disreputable brother who came and whispered with a chuckle the TRUTH in your ear minus the holy gilt wrapping and sanctimonious jive.

Shepherd's constant theme throughout all his work, both spoken and written, was always the most profound of all literary themes whether you're reading the Bible, Shakespeare, or Hemingway...what really matters in this world?  What is of REAL value?  We listeners all became little Ralphie Parker and Shepherd prompted us each to use our secret decoder rings to try to break the code of life. To listen to him was to believe it was possible to find one damn Cosmic truth we could believe in.  Shakespeare's Hamlet says, ""How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable seem to me all the uses of this world! Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden that grows to seed.""  Springsteen sings, ""All that's sure on the boulevard/ Is that life is just a house of cards...""  And Shepherd has Ralphie discover, "" It's just a crumby commercial.""

In The Star-Crossed Romance of Josephine Cosnowski (a tip to Shakespeare's star-crossed lovers Romeo and Juliet) Shepherd mixes the story of Ralphie chasing a dangerous dream...sex... with that of his father chasing an equally dangerous one...the love of a new used car. Springsteen sings, ""Wish every wish, there comes a curse.""  Both Parkers, father and son, fail to realize that the greatest thing they own is not material, but the love within their family.  Mrs. Parker, mom, is the wisest of them all and the core of safety and stability that neither of her men appreciate sufficiently. Mom goes without the sewing machine she REALLY needs so that ""the old man"" can have the Buick he doesn't need. Shepherd's wonderful qualities as a writer soar with his similes again and again in this story when he describes Ralph's attraction to Josephine, ""I was drawn like a moth to a flame.""  Or describing the Parker's fictional town- ""Homand, clinging like a barnacle to the soft underbelly of Chicago.""  The Parkers, junior and senior, are comic Greek heroes both with fatal flaws, and as their mini-tragedies are played out pop-culture music plays in the background like the finest, and funniest, Greek chorus.  Shepherd himself narrates and reprises his role as the choragos once again.

My god this is great stuff.  It is under appreciated high literary art that at the same times tears into your funny bone, and your guts.  Great humor reminds man of his own foibles.  It isn't ""Lord what fools these mortals be,"" it's rather, ""Oh, what a fool I am.""

Those of us who went on that Cosmic search for one damn truth with Shep back in his WOR days, and lived through to see him have his moment of universal acclaim with The Christmas Story, miss him so very, very much.  He set us off on a quest for truth that has taken us further, and longer, into space than the Apollo Moon shots.  Out in the Cosmos we can faintly hear the beep-beeps of a distant code coming from deep space, ""Excelsior, you fathead!"" it intones. And we smile.  A wry, and perhaps slightly sad smile- for we know it's the truth.",1438992000,4,3583,4.763754045307444

8600446,5,B00E2YINE0,"Jean Shepherd at his best.  If you are of Polish descent, like from Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland or Buffalo, this movie will make sense to you.  Jean hit it right on the head with this one.  It is so funny, and it reminds me of my youth growing up on Buffalo's East Side!",1414540800,4,270,4.153846153846154

8600448,5,B00E2YINE0,"This is the barely known and rarely seen sob sister of its more famous sibling A Christmas Story.  Ralph is now a high school senior (still hanging out with the same gruesome twosome he did in elementary school  - Schwartz and Flick) and he finds himself in love with (and almost unwittingly engaged to) his lovely Polish next door neighbor, the title character.  This tale surrounds Thanksgiving and one can only hope and pray that some network will get smart and start showing it non-stop that day like its more popular sibling gets retold each Christmas..",1389916800,8,558,4.791666666666667
