7734263,4,B01EAY8L4S,"I really enjoyed the visuals.  The story is just OK.  Hard to follow in parts.  Not sure small children would like this, there is no dialogue.  A little boy runs away in search of his father and winds up in the big city among other places.  At one point it looks like he is abducted by aliens which made no sense to me.  Not for everyone.",1469750400,,338,4.045454545454546
7734264,5,B01EAY8L4S,"Haven't seen a movie this ""deep"" since Pink Floyd's The Wall",1469491200,,60,4.545454545454546
7734265,5,B01EAY8L4S,"Wonderfully playful animation from Brazil in which a small boy experiences the dueling wonders and terrors of big city life for the first time. The artwork, clearly on showcase opposite a rather modest storyline, varies from light and expressive to rich and densely textured. It can be a real wonder to behold, especially during moments when the child's imagination takes over and the mechanical guts of an industrial zone become huge, towering, ignorant beasts. Virtually language-free (characters speak a made-up dialect once or twice), it's more universal for that decision and really doesn't need the crutch. Though it gets heavy-handed with environmental messaging late in the journey, the film rebounds nicely with an unexpected twist and brings a little mist to the eye for the final scene. An ambitious, often stunning peek at modern life, as seen through the disbelieving eyes we all shared at one time or another, and well worthy of the Oscar attention it received.",1469232000,2,975,5.177215189873418
7734266,5,B01EAY8L4S,Beautiful movie. Great work of art. Wonderful theme and a good movie to be watched by any age group. Depicts the reality through an artists lens.,1469059200,,145,4.615384615384615
7734267,1,B01EAY8L4S,"I'm sorry, I don't get it. I watched this with my in-laws, my wife and two kids aged 7 and 9. At the end, my father-in-law summed it up: It sure had some pretty colors!

That, it does!  At first, even the colors are sparse. The story line is incredibly dull and difficult to fully grasp.  There are virtually no spoken parts. It is - at best - grunted from time to time. There are dream sequences, that even the adults weren't always sure of which were reality and which parts were dream sequences.  Most difficult to understand (for us) was who he was with and where he was living half the time.

We honestly didn't know what we had watched when we were done.

THAT SAID, we were pretty sure that we were supposed to feel guilty after watching it. There seemed to be a lot about haves and have nots and evil rich people and good poor people who coughed and lost their crummy-to-begin-with jobs.

It was drawn beautifully in parts, and much like cutouts from magazines in other parts. In one scene where forests were being ravaged - or deforested - it actually became real, grainy, film.

It felt like something that really rich people would watch, proclaim to be incredible, then go out and donate some money to a carbon footprint exchange to feel better about themselves, and then go on with their lives.

It was really one of the least interesting, least impactful, and least enjoyable movies I have seen in my life.

My revi3w appears to be censored for some reason.",1469059200,7,1470,4.47191011235955
7734268,5,B01EAY8L4S,"I can't say enough good things about this incredible film. The fact that it lost to Inside Out for the Oscar this year was perhaps the biggest upset of the night for me. The animation artistry is unlike anything I've ever seen, a blend of collage, crayon and paint that create a world that is both fantastical and highly familiar. The music (and the use of instruments for most sound effects) was the glue that holds the film together and still gives me chills when I hear it.

For those that think animation is solely for children are required to watch this. It delves into themes of capitalism, commodity, worker's rights and industrialism in a way that made me weep (and I am no easy weeper). The journey of this simple character reveals the journey of so many people around the world. There is no dialogue, and in doing so, adds to the universality of the characters and themes. I am moved thinking about it as I write this, and I know others will be too. Please support more pieces of work like this and get yourself a copy!",1468454400,3,1029,4.444444444444445
7734269,5,B01EAY8L4S,Beautiful. Thoughtful. And Relaxing at the same time.,1467936000,,53,5.75
7734270,5,B01EAY8L4S,"We're living in a new golden age of animation, and thanks to GKIDS, films like Ale Abreu's Boy and the World are within reach.  There's such a rare and gentle beauty to this film - it reminded me of the work of Frederic Back (The Man Who Planted Trees, Illusion?).  It touches on deep and multifaceted global themes, but is as disarming and charming as a child's drawing.  My daughter sees many animated films, and she likes a lot of them -- but she REALLY liked this film, and it opened up opportunities for us to chat about things that are sometimes hard to talk about with eight year-olds.  Check it out, and enjoy the magic.",1467849600,7,628,4.387931034482759
7734271,5,B01EAY8L4S,"Boy & the World, an exquisite animated adventure from Brazilian director Al Abreu (Garoto Csmico), opens on a pure-white background - a sheet of paper - and a solitary dot.

In a playful repetition of Genesis 1, the film's colorful, handcrafted world opens up before us as a series of paisley patterns that are swallowed up into larger shapes that move, swirl, and swell to an acoustic beat.

Nominated for a best animated-film Oscar, Abreu's visionary movie is a restless and dynamic creature that is forever reconstituting itself into complex visual and musical landscapes.

Slowly, there appear flowers and fields, a river and a sky, flora and fauna. This is the world as seen through the eyes of Cuca, an imaginative stick-figure boy living an ideal life in the countryside with his mom and dad.

Soon, the boy's fun and games are interrupted when dad, suitcase in hand, boards a long, segmented worm of a train. He needs to find work, we realize. Despondent, Cuca follows him.

Emotionally engaging and unhampered by dialogue, Boy & the World will appeal to children with its deceptively simple story and its visual splendor.

Adults will be drawn in by its strong - if not always subtle - historical and social message on the toll industrialization and urbanization take on a culture and its people. There's a Marxian dialectic here about how unchecked capitalism leads to the destruction of the environment, the mechanization of life, and the reduction of humans into faceless cogs in a heartless mechanism.

But the film also celebrates the irrepressible creative energy of ordinary people. Cuca meets men and women who work hard to improve their lives in an often hostile world. Wherever he goes, he sees people resist oppression with art, music, dance.

Cuca's journey leads him to farms and fields - gorgeous scenes depict hundreds of farmhands picking cotton. The boy visits mills where the cotton is spun into fabric, and the factories where it is stitched into clothes. Eventually, he ends up in a big, loud, strange city with its resplendent steel-and-glass skyscrapers and its ugly, overcrowded slums.

Abreu has fashioned an unforgettable piece of popular art that continues to enchant with repeated viewing.",1464912000,18,2225,5.040871934604905
7734272,5,B01EAY8L4S,"Yes!  We showed this at our festival a few years ago, and the imagery has stuck with me...every day when the bus crosses over and through the ports of Seattle and I'm momentarily surrounded by shipping crates and monstrous machinery, I think of the rhythms of this film and the way it made me feel.  A beautiful film, wordless and wonderful, and haunting.  I kept looking for a DVD release, and was just reminded to check again - glad to see I can finally bring this one home.

While this is appropriate for children, it may be a little sad if they are very perceptive, anxious, or have fears of loss and abandonment.  I'm debating whether I want to share it with my niece or not - perhaps just parts of it for now.  The other possibility is that the nuances and implications could be missed and she won't notice the sadness with all of the beauty and music of the film.",1492214400,,870,4.339506172839506

7734275,2,B01EAY8L4S,"This movie was shown to 16 youth at a church movie night (ages 5-16)
8 of the kids left half way through the movie- the remaining kids helped me come up with a review.
The movie is about: a boy who misses his dad, a boy who lost his dad and found a dog, a family I think, a boy trying to find happiness, the changing world, travel
What group of people do you think would like this movie: probably no one, or someone who was emotional disturbed
Did you like this movie- no it was twisted, creepy, boring, strange.  kind of liked it but not sure I understood it
Out of 5 stars, rate this movie: half star - 3 stars
Did you learn anything from this movie: don't grow up too fast, I don't know, it's hard to understand things when people don't talk, move on, I'm not sure I understood it",1486684800,,783,4.084415584415584
7734276,4,B01EAY8L4S,"I am a big fan of animation and am constantly looking for new films, especially in foreign market. I am a pretty harsh critic; judging story, animation, writing and voice acting. Boy and the World is interesting but hard to recommend.  It IS interesting though.  At first I did not understand why it kept jumping around. The first 20-30 minutes was me wondering if this was some crazy scifi abstract thing that I wasn't going to understand the purpose of.  But then I came to realize that the story was being told through a man's boyhood memories. So you get this unreliable but emotionally driven,  slightly broken and fantastic storytelling that really was amazing to experience. The animation was CRAZY. They used all these different mediums: color pencils, watercolor, acrylic, newspaper cutouts, real world footage. And yet at the same time it was simplistic. Beaitiful  yet odd.
  There was a minimal amount of writing. And what what writing there was was a foreign language backwards as far as I can tell. It didn't matter anyway. The words themselves were not important but the feeling the voice actors were trying to covey, which they did wonderfully.
This movie is done similar to Triplettes of Belville, though more vague and childlike.",1486339200,6,1247,4.937799043062201

7734281,5,B01EAY8L4S,"Wonderful movie. Love the painting/drawing/computer animation art style as well as the music and the backwards Portuguese as the language used. This movie has a deeper meaning than seen on the surface. It is masked as a simple kids movie that has no meaning, but in all reality is has a huge meaning to it with lots of symbolism throughout.

7734289,1,B01EAY8L4S,It must be an artsy thing. Personally I was bored to tears.  I understand the theme. There is nothing subtle about this movie. They beat you over the head with it.

7734293,3,B01EAY8L4S,"I only gave it three stars because my 7 and 3-year-old sons seemed to like it, although I thought it sucked hard.  Vacuous, non-existent plot.  The underlying message of the movie is that industrialization and civilization are evil, but of course, it's devoid of any actual solutions.  No intellectual discussion occurs at all; purely emotionally driven.  A movie produced unsurprisingly in a dying South American economy.",1473638400,,422,5.348484848484849

8758250,5,B01EAY8L4S,"This is one of my favorite movies! It tells a rich story without saying a word. The first time I watched it I didn't care for the childish animation in the beginning but now I love it. The animation grows as he does, and everything keeps being tied back into the story so that it comes full circle. I'm hosting a movie night just so I can share it with my friends!

8758252,5,B01EAY8L4S,"This was an unexpected & rewarding surprise of a film! Its animation is a mixture of styles, at first simple on the surface, then growing richer: color pencils, paints, even paper collage. It's part fable, rather dreamlike, a reverie of one boy's life as he travels from a small folk village to the city, which becomes more & more fantastic & futuristic as seen through his young eyes -- a tale of folk tradition, beauty, art, all overwhelmed by rapacious consumerism & commodification, in which the spirit struggles to survive. Cranes are dinosaurs, bulldozers are monsters, the cities of the wealthy float in bubbles above everyone & everything else, and their minions maintain ruthless order as they use & discard the poor.

While certainly a picture of contemporary Brazil, it's just as applicable to the entire world. The characters don't speak any recognizable language -- it's a mixture of Portuguese words spoken backwards, so that you get the feel of a real language, without it being any specific language. And in any case, the pictures tell the story completely. It's a compelling & all too accurate story, all around the world. Is it heavy-handed? Some might say so, especially in a couple of scenes; but then, there's nothing subtle about the ravaging of both the outer landscape & the inner landscape by greed & power, is there?

But simply on the level of visuals, it's filled with countless little grace notes: the golden dots, like thistledown, that float up from the musical instruments; the envisioning of the celebratory processions that become a multi-colored bird of mythic proportions, embodying the spirit of the people, even in the most soulless of conditions; the close-up of a single firefly as it shakes its glowing bottom & adjusts its wings. Both beauty & memory persist, despite the those who happily devour the world for the sake of profit.

If you're looking for more traditional animated stories, look elsewhere. This is something different ... and necessary viewing, too. Most highly recommended!",1505952000,,2031,5.038690476190476

(All told from an innocent and endearing viewpoint.) This might look like a pleasant evening's diversion, but be warned - you will be left with burning childhood nostalgia and with concern for the future of humanity (with a glimmer of hopefulness).
