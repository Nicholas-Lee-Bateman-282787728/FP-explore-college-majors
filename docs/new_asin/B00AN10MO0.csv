5457879,5,B00AN10MO0,Awesome hockey movie.  Brought back a lot of memories from when I was younger watching the game.  Nilan was a terror out there.  Pretty cool behind the scenes look at the life of a hockey player.  Brings to light the dedication some people have to the game and the hardships that come with making it to the show.,1379203200,4,312,4.327586206896552
5457880,4,B00AN10MO0,"A great story of Chris Nilans life on and off the ice. I ended up,watching it two days in a row",1377388800,3,95,3.5714285714285716
5457881,3,B00AN10MO0,"I bought the movie on the strength of the trailer alone and because of Alex Gibney's reputation.  I'm a Rangers fan and watched it with a Bruins fan and a Canadiens fan, since Chris Nilan played for each of our teams.  I think we expected a bit more because it's a Gibney doc but the end felt a bit tacked on and left us all thinking ""is that it?""  That being said, it's a good movie for people who have zero idea about the role of an enforcer in hockey and the surprising toll it has taken on a lot of the men who end up in that position.  (And I'd be lying if I said I wasn't going to watch it again to see if it gets better.)  If your hockey DVD collection includes Youngblood or Les Boys then you're probably going to want to add this to it as well, but your hockey knowledge may already exceed The Last Gladiators.

However, if you're a Nilan fan, you're going to LOVE it!",1373328000,2,877,4.040462427745664
5457882,4,B00AN10MO0,"Knuckles Nilan.  Do I need to say anymore?  If you don't know who the enforcers are, or why we don't see as many fights in the NHL anymore then you're not an old school hockey fan (or you're too young to remember when enforcers were necessary in hockey).

Great documentary.  Brings up a lot of good topics, and addresses the one topic that rarely gets any publicity; what happens to hockey players after they retire.  Or better yet what is happening to the enforcers now that the NHL is slowly conforming to concussion ""pressure"" and weeding the enforcers from the NHL.

How can you take something like fighting out of hockey?  It's primal instinct and it's a tradition.  Who is going to check an instigator when they start something with your star player?  You take these guys from hockey and you're taking tradition from our sport.  Leave the sport alone and let these men do their jobs.  Protect your star players and stick up for what's right.

Watch this movie if you want to see the enforcers point of view.",1369526400,3,1014,4.572222222222222
5457883,5,B00AN10MO0,"the movie showed unfortunately, the down side of life for these former enforcers. The documentary reminded of the movie the wrestler. The ending was sad.",1368748800,,153,5.16
5457884,4,B00AN10MO0,"No, it's not a ""TV"" show but it is ""real"". A genuine slice of life, and how minor twists and turns can have a profound impact on the way your life turns out. I wish more stories like this would appear on any of the major network television menus once they've made their box office runs. This is a story of a real ""Survivor"".",1368316800,,324,4.078125
5457885,5,B00AN10MO0,I ordered this book as a gift for my husband because he requested it.  He is very happy with it and is reading it currently.,1367107200,,124,3.96
5457886,5,B00AN10MO0,"The movie follows Chris ""Knuckles"" Nilan, who as a younger (late 20s) hockey fan I wasn't familiar with, but they also provide some insight into the other fighters as well (such as Tony Twist, et. al).

If you're a hockey fan, you owe it to yourself to see this film. A GREAT look at the unspoken ""code"" of hockey, explained by the very people that enforced those unspoken rules. So well done.",1366156800,,393,4.458333333333333
5457887,5,B00AN10MO0,"Being a fan of the game back in the 80's, I  had seen a lot of the highlights in this documentary as they actually happened. This DVD chronicles one player in particular Chris Nilan, his ups and downs before, during and after the game of hockey. I remember vividly the Montreal- Boston brawl that spilled out into the hallway, because I remember watching this happen on TV. This and other events during the careers of the now-defunct everyday NHL fighter are told in this delightful DVD. It helps a lot if you were actually able to see these events occur like I did. And I also was able to watch the players interviewed play in their hey-day. That will enhance your enjoyment of this DVD. This DVD is a look into the days of when hockey wasn't controlled by Television and the ol'e mighty dollar. When just about everything was let go as far as the rough stuff. It also dwells into the hardships of the fighters as they play their role's on their teams. So if you were able to see the old-style in your face hockey that carried the league for decades this is a nice stroll down memory lane here. If you're a new fan or younger fan of the game and you missed this era, it's a great look into the way the game used to be played. When the players were responsible for themselves on the ice. The game back then and now today is almost night and day. It's a good look into how things used to be. This is a wonderful DVD.",1364256000,14,1415,4.260223048327138
5457888,5,B00AN10MO0,Great look into the real life of the professional hockey athlete. Very well done documentary. A great movie to add to your hockey library.,1363564800,2,138,4.791666666666667
5457889,3,B00AN10MO0,"Brutal no holds barred account of the tough guys of hockey focusing Chris ""knuckles"" Nilan.  An absorbing and at times compelling account of Chris Nilan's rise and fall during his NHL career.  I just wish the movie spent some more time with some of the other tough guys of the NHL. Nice addition to those who love the game of ice hockey film library.",1489708800,,350,4.453125
5457890,5,B00AN10MO0,"Wow. As a relative new fan of hockey, I was immediately caught up in this film and loved every moment of it. My boyfriend is a die-hard Canadiens fan and this movie caught us right in the feels. We loved every minute of it.",1484784000,,223,4.090909090909091

5457893,4,B00AN10MO0,"As an old time hockey fan this program was thought provoking to say the least. Which came first 'the chicken or the egg' scenario? Did hockey bring  out a latent violent streak in these enforcers, or were they created by the system. Nilan made some bad decisions before descending into drugs, the others featured in the program seemed to be leading normal lives after retiring from the game. You decide.",1483315200,,403,4.757142857142857

5457900,3,B00AN10MO0,"People who don't understand fighting in hockey might benefit from this.  While there is some fight footage, the real story is the ups and downs and fears and bravado of the men who were expected to mix it up on cue.  Hockey fans will likely enjoy this look into the rapidly-disappearing role of the enforcer and some of the recent best.  And Chris Nilan, who looks even scarier and wild-eyed here that usual, gets a respectful treatment and is allowed to tell his own story pretty well.",1478736000,3,486,4.563218390804598

It's considered a documentary, but it's almost a movie in the way it plays out and watches. It really paints a clear, enjoyable, and very realistic picture of how the NHL was in the late 80's and early 90's for fighters and enforcers, and also how difficult it can be fr these types of players to adjust back in to normal society after retirement. This is a great watch and is recommended.",1429833600,4,549,4.339805825242719

5457941,5,B00AN10MO0,"From the vintage hockey footage, to the interviews with hockey greats past and present, this film does a great job examining the role of the enforcer, and the toll this role takes on the players who are called to it",1401753600,,215,4.4
5457942,4,B00AN10MO0,"A fascinating look at the role of enforcers and tough guys in the NHL with an emphasis on the 80's and 90's, as seen through the eyes of one of the game's prolific enforcers.  Rich in first hand accounts and commentary, and including some great game and fight footage, I was nevertheless disappointed that the documentary didn't live up to its name- and instead became ""The Chris Nilan Story"" (not that his story is undeserving).

There was rudimentary coverage of ""The Code"", which I find both fascinating and unique to the game of hockey.  As a social aberration, fighting in hockey was once encouraged and is now frowned upon because, well, people have a tendency to get hurt and we can't have that...

And while the time and attention to Nilan's story was riveting and worthy of its own biopic, the title of this documentary was deceptive in that we're led to believe it's a historical study of goons in hockey when in fact it's a biographical piece with historical vignettes added for emphasis.  However this is a minor complaint in an otherwise superb look into the world of hockey's enforcers, and the ""goons"" who wanted so dearly to be considered complete players.

NOTE: Perhaps my views are jaundiced by the fact that only a few minutes were afforded to one of my heroes, the late, great Bob Probert.",1398643200,,1310,4.698689956331878
5457943,4,B00AN10MO0,"Director Alex Gibney has an eye for the rise and fall of the mighty.  Some of his subjects are those who paid the price for taking on powerful foes, such as Julian Assange (WE STEAL SECRETS) and Eliot Spitzer (CLIENT NINE).  Others are the powerful, such as Ken Lay (ENRON: THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM) and Jack Abramoff (CASINO JACK AND THE UNITED STATES OF MONEY), who paid for pushing their luck.

I had not heard of Gibney's fine 2011 documentary THE LAST GLADIATORS until stumbling across it on a movie streaming service yesterday.  Maybe I was not aware of the film because its setting is in the least popular of America's big four team sports, hockey, and focuses on one of the more notorious goons to play in the National Hockey League in the 1980s and 90s as opposed to the glamorous players of that era, household names such as Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux.  But too bad for those who miss this gem.  Covering the life and penalty minutes-laden hockey career of Montreal Canadien Chris ""Knuckles"" Nilan, a guy who never backed down from a fight on or off the ice and started more than his share of them to boot, THE LAST GLADIATORS does what Alex Gibney does so well, making us understand how people who do what most of us wouldn't are just part of what makes the world go 'round, whether it's to humanity's benefit or detriment.

""Knuckles"" Nilan!  Talk about a nickname that requires no explanation.  Other than, ""I don't want to make him mad,"" I'll say this about the Chris Nilan we meet in THE LAST GLADIATORS:  The man is not afraid to pay the price for his principles, even when the cost makes the penalty box look like a vacation.

If you're a hockey fan who hates the Canadiens, please note that in addition to its story of Chris Nilan THE LAST GLADIATORS presents some of the other enforcers with whom he may have fought in the days when the National Hockey League was as renowned for what players did with their gloves off as they did with them on, including Marty McSorley and the late Tony Twist.

See THE LAST GLADIATORS.  Director Gibney spares us the obvious questions about the N.H.L.'s exploitation of violence and the fans' thirst for it, except to note that in recent years the league finally did curb the high sticks and flying fists.  But despite the rules, what motivates fighters such as Chris Nilan is a question that demands answers.",1397865600,5,2373,4.552941176470588
5457944,5,B00AN10MO0,"This is a great film for people who don't understand why fighting has been part of hockey for 85 + years.

He's a good man and it's incredibly brave and selfless of him to share his experience. I feel like this documentary will help more people than he thinks. There is nothing ""sugar coated"" about it to make it more Hollywood. This is a real, honest film and it will continue to help bring awareness and also destigmatize addiction in hockey, finding your place in the world and asking for help.
