3841523,3,B0021SGO3Q,"This DVD, ""The Bloody Aleutians"" is a good addition to my library of the history of World War 2.  Great mixture of Color and B/W footage.  It will greatly assist decendents of soldiers and sailors, who were stationed in the Aleutians, with understanding the surroundings under which our fathers served our country during the War.",1331510400,3,329,4.963636363636364
3841524,5,B0021SGO3Q,"I have only great things to say about this documentary! This is the only good in depth doc on the Aleutians, everyone should and needs to own this!

What this does unlike others is detail the Aleutian campaign so precise that you get the entire story from start to finish.. It goes through all major battles and operations from when the Japs planned on taking it and exactly why  they did take it, till the end when we Buried the japs their...This gem does all of this with breathtaking original footage and shots which paints a finally complete picture of this mostly forgotten aspect of WW2...

How most americans have no clue that this happened is beyond me but this documentary is a 5 star A+++ that should be shown along with any classroom subject on WW2",1328313600,,759,4.525547445255475
3841525,5,B0021SGO3Q,"The movie is very true to what happened in those days during War World II!
An Elderly Gentlemen I care for served in the Aleutian Islands in Alaska and enjoys watching movies from when he did service there in World World II. During his brief stay in the Aleutian Islands due to a gun shot wound, he earned a Purple Heart & Bronze Star.",1308441600,,335,4.25
3841526,5,B0021SGO3Q,"This is such a well done video, the History Channel is to be commended.  Several of the named personnel were known by an old friend of mine and from his view what is said on this video are very accurate.",1296172800,,203,4.075
3841527,5,B0021SGO3Q,"As one who has written extensively about Alaska's military history and interviewed veterans of that battle, I highly recommend this extremely well-done documentary to anyone interested in the events of May-August 1943. Nothing conveys the realities of the combat experience in the Aleutian/Bering Sea theater better than these visual images and interviews. As others have noted it joins several other such documentary efforts to capture the events of this remote battlefield most Americans at the time knew little about because of strict military censorship, clamped-down on the Territory even before Dutch Harbor. Those who view the powerful HBO series,'The Pacific' will find little to compare with Attu, except for the sacrifice, and heroism displayed in equal measure on both sides of this desperate struggle at the top of the world, fought in conditions experienced nowhere else in the Pacific War.

3841528,5,B0021SGO3Q,"'The Bloody Aleutians' - Documentary. This is one of the four critical video documentaries that covers down on the Aleutian Campaign of World War II in Alaska - sometimes referred to as the forgotten war. It is in the good company and traditions of such documentaries as 'Red White Black & Blue', 'Report From The Aleutians', and 'Alaska At War'. For any student of the second world war, this is an important treatment of this extraordinary (and generally under-reported) campaign. It also closely compliments the written works of Stan Cohen's series on the Aleutian Campaign. I strongly recommend it! - Prof Mike Haller",1283731200,9,620,5.029126213592233
3841529,5,B0021SGO3Q,"This is an outstanding video history of what has become known as the ""forgotten war"", the Aleutian Island campaign of WWII.  ""The Thousand Mile War"" by Brian Garfield is a great companion book to this video.  My father fought with Company B, 4th Infantry Regiment, U.S. Army on Attu Island.  Imagine my suprise when I saw about a 15-30 second image of my Dad on this video.",1261958400,8,373,4.537313432835821

8349514,5,B0021SGO3Q,My dad fought in the Aleutians....brought back memories of what he told me and haw hard it was.  They were up there for 2 1/2 years with NO BREAK!  I think the Army forgot about them.,1420588800,,183,4.055555555555555
8349515,5,B0021SGO3Q,"I was curious to see this, as my grandfather died in the Battle of Attu and I am wanting to learn more about the battle, the terrain, the sequence of events, the people involved. This documentary presents the story as it unfolded at a great level of detail, well researched, with lots of excellent archive footage and photos. If you only watch one documentary about the Battle of Attu, I recommend this one.",1415404800,,407,4.589041095890411

8349518,3,B0021SGO3Q,"Having been researching the Aleutians campaign for a book I'm writing, it was neat to see the likes of Buckner, Butler, Eareckson, Kinkaid etc. on film. Yet, however much I was ready, and wanting, to love this film, it fell grossly short for a supposed 'documentary.' It was like reading a 500 page book on the campaign that skips 100 pages at a time, wrapping the whole ordeal up in 45 minutes flat. While interesting, it's just too bowdlerized, which means it skips massive amounts of key details and footage, more readily found in propaganda films like the far more compelling ""Report from the Aleutians"". Ultimately, while I commend the History Channel for trying to shed light on the War in the North, the brevity of the attempt falls flat, leaving out far too much critical facts and footage to pass as a documentary. Regrettably, this outrageously hurried storytelling to fit the war into 45 minutes does precisely what it set out NOT to do: it brushes the Aleutians campaign off as little more than an unfortunate vignette, a tedious offshoot, not deserving of deeper attention, of a greater Pacific battle. But in reality, the Aleutians campaign was a far more complicated, exciting, difficult and historically significant front than 'The Bloody Aleutians' would lead one to believe. Slightly disappointing.",1382918400,4,1316,5.013698630136986
8349519,4,B0021SGO3Q,Very good documentary. Added some new information I was unaware of. It is an interesting account of a conflict on U.S. soil during WWII.,1355961600,,136,4.708333333333333
8349520,4,B0021SGO3Q,"I can't understand why the History Channel would not report what really happened at Kiska. After the fall of Attu, the Japanese had decided to abandon the Aleutian campaign and began preparations to evacuate Kiska. On July 28, protected by fog and low-lying clouds, they successfully evacuated all troops and left behind booby traps - despite an American blockade of the island.
Admiral Kinkaid, the officer in charge - and one prone to rash decisions - ignored the advice of his generals, Smith and Buckner, to send in the Alaskan scouts for reconnaissance as they had done several times previously. Since there was no reported sign of life on the island, this advice seemed reasonable.
Instead Kinkaid ordered a full-scale invasion involving over 34,000 men - Americans and Canadians - to begin in the fog and clouds. Something like Russian roulette. Except that Kinkaid wasn't at the front, leading his troops. The Kiska invasion came on August 15.
Result: 17 Americans and 4 Canadians dead from friendly fire or booby traps. 50 wounded. 130 soldiers got trenchfoot. Admiral Kinkaid successfully captured an unoccupied island. One of the biggest travesties of WWII. Shame on the History Channel for ignoring it.
The Thousand-Mile War by Brian Garfield documents this.",1348617600,,1270,5.140096618357488
