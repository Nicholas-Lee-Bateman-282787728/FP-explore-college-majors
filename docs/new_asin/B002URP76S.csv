SUPER BLURRY PICTURE makes it hard to tell what is going on in some instances! Some highlights are of a somewhat decent looking picture, but most of the highlights have horrible picture quality! If you love Michael Vicks talent as an INCREDIBLE RUNNING & PASSING QUARTERBACK & can put up with alot of horrible quality picture then buy it! If not, don't waste your money!",1377043200,,491,4.3478260869565215
8381473,3,B002URP76S,"Can't go higher than 3 stars here folks, I was incorrectly under the assumption that this DVD contained video of dog tortures.  I feel that it is reasonable to expect video recordings of pot smoking, dog killing, and prison yard rape.  Shouldn't we know the entire person?  I feel cheated.",1260144000,,289,4.74
