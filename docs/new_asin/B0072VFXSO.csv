8509046,5,B0072VFXSO,"First, the movie itself...
Lots of people really hate on this film, but for me, it's a fun (bad) trip down memory lane. Everything on screen just screams ""1970s!"", from the vehicles & clothes to the haircuts. It's an peculiar mishmash of a film. Partly a throwback to the innocent 1950's, with its charmingly obvious stop-motion creature, but then it features bits of gratuitous violence, (gunshot robbery victims, monster-related bloodshed, and a shock corpse scene ripped straight out of JAWS), that firmly root this oddity in the mid-1970s. Some see it as so-bad-it's-good, (me among them), while others rate it as being dumb beyond endurance. Either way, you're in luck here! You can view the film as it was originally shown OR you can select the option to watch it with the hilarious RiffTrax audio commentary.

Now the RiffTrax stuff...
There's plenty to make fun of in this film and the RiffTrax guys make the most of it.  Their nearly non-stop running commentary of this low-budget, drive-in throwback adds immensely to the viewing experience.  I loved watching Mystery Science Theater 3000 back in my college years and getting these new offerings from three of the original crew from that show is about as close as you'll get.  If you've never watched a RiffTrax film before, this one is a good starter.  For seasoned fans, this one ranks near the top with me.  I'm an admirer of the original film, which has been a guilty pleasure of mine for years, and I am a huge lover of all things MST3k, so this DVD of ""RiffTrax: The Crater Lake Monster"" easily scores a full 5 STARS from me!",1389398400,,1591,4.746376811594203
8509047,4,B0072VFXSO,This movie was terrible but the riffs that were said made it a funny and entertaining watch. Bill corbitt and the gang had me gasping for air from all the laughter,1359849600,,163,4.290322580645161
8509048,3,B0072VFXSO,"Living in Oregon, I have to say whoever wrote this stink machine did little if no research.  (i.e.  We don't have a 'Southern Alabama' accent, etc.)  But, what can I say.  Riffing was good, movie was bad.  That's what Rifftrax is!",1356480000,,230,4.512195121951219
8509049,5,B0072VFXSO,"Wow, between this and ""Galaxy Invader"" it seems like Mike and Co. are really knocking these Rifftrax DVDs out of the park lately, making some excellent fun for those who miss MST3k.

What is there to say about ""The Crater Lake Monster"" as a movie?  To start with, I'm truly stunned at the picture quality for this film.  From a technical standpoint, this movie looks amazing, and is definitely the highest film quality I've ever seen on a Rifftrax release.  The colors are bright, vibrant, everything is super crisp, its truly surprising this 1977 turd looks this good!  How is the actual movie itself?  Not as good!

The plot is pretty simple:  A meteor crashes into the Crater Lake, and the heat of the rock activates a formerly frozen egg that grows into a Loch Ness monster type creature.  It starts killing numerous random men with terrible fashion sense and moustaches, attacks but doesn't kill others, and is scraped to death by the town sheriff operating some very weird type of bulldozer.  If you're thinking this isn't enough story to fill 80 minutes, you're right!

We also get multiple pointless subplots to pad the film out, the majority of which involve two idiot rednecks who operate a boat chartering business around the lake.  They fight, get drunk, spell signs wrong, and generally provide terrible unending attempts at ""comedy relief"" where we can't possibly miss the intent as they play goofy clown music through all of it.  On its own this stuff would be nothing short of agonizing.

My favorite pad-the-film subplot, though, is when a random gross moustached guy gets up, leaves his house, goes to the liquor store, gets a small bottle of whiskey, SHOOTS THE CASHIER AND THE OTHER CUSTOMER, leaves the liquor store WITHOUT TAKING ANY MONEY FROM THE CASH REGISTER (!!!) goes to a diner where the town sheriff gets out of his car, looks at the robbers car, the robber leaves, gets in his car, drives past the sheriff and SHOOTS AT HIM FOR NO REASON, misses, then drives away towards the lake in what has to be the slowest car chase ever filmed, then gets eaten by the monster.

If you're wondering why I typed that in such detail, the movie goes about the scene even more deliberately to fill running time.  Its ridiculous!  The whole point of the scene is to get the sheriff near the lake so he can finally see the monster, which is totally needless, since one of the scenes JUST BEFORE the robbery is the two hilbillies and the sheriff FINDING A SEVERED HEAD IN THE LAKE!  The filmmakers apparently didn't think this was enough of a reason, so the very weird, poitless subplot stretches the film further.

I've ranted enough but one more thing to point out is the fact that every outdoor scene takes place in broad daylight on the sunniest of days, even when several scenes make it very apparent that they are supposed to be taking place at night (one scene has a character remark on the number of stars in the sky, though by all acounts it looks to be about 2pm).  I can only assume some day-for-night shooting was intended, but the ""night"" part clearly never got done.

So the movie is pretty ridiculous, the characters are equally ridiculous due either to their fashion choices, their acting, or both.  All of this gives plenty of riffing ammo and Mike, Kevin and Bill are totally up to the task.  I watched it with my wife and we laughed so hard at all of it.  A great Rifftrax DVD, one of their best yet.",1345420800,6,3431,4.596059113300493
8509050,5,B0072VFXSO,"I just watched Rifftrax: Crater Lake Monster, and I haven't laughed that much in a while. This was probably only the third Rifftrax DVD I've watched, but it is by far the best and it makes me want to see more Rifftrax episodes. There are a ton of gay jokes and redneck jokes. The movie that is riffed is about a crappy looking dinosaur killing off yokels in a small town. And Crater Lake Monster actually ain't half bad. It's quite charming, actually. If the SyFy channel would've been around in the 70's, this probably would have been a Saturday Night original movie on there. I highly suggest picking up Rifftrax: Crater Lake Monster if you are a fan of Rifftrax, Mystery Science Theater, or cheesy monster movies.",1345161600,,716,4.6015625
8509051,4,B0072VFXSO,"a fun, so-bad-it's-good movie, made more fun by the Rifftrax crew.  video is full screen but looks good.  HOWEVER.  I have purchased 2 copies of this DVD and both of them freeze up in the same place, near the beginning of the second chapter.  if not for that problem I would be giving this 5 stars.",1344211200,3,298,4.267857142857143
8509052,5,B0072VFXSO,"In Crater Lake, Oregon a few scientists (one who has no time to explain anything) discover some etchings that indicate dinosaurs may have survived into the age of man. So naturally what happens next, an earthquake hits that causes a cave-in and unearths a monster (a bad stop motion dinosaur) that starts to munch on the local townsfolk. The sheriff of course doesn't listen to the doctor (who sports many sweaters and comforts hurt people by stroking their head as they die) when he tells him they need to find this monster before it is killed. There's also two hicks who rent boats, fight and have goofy music accompany them in every scene, some drunk shoots up a liquor store, gets chased by the sheriff then eaten by the monster in a later scene.

The film itself is a pretty big mess, the acting is bad, the characters don't really seem to blend together at all in fact most of the scenes seem to be written separately from each other and don't really blend together until near the end, but by that time you don't care about anyone or anything (actually long before that). The Rifftrax crew does a great job with this one, as its probably one of the worst movies they've done, funny throughout and a breeze with their commentary, without it would be pretty painful.",1339459200,11,1270,4.5701754385964914
