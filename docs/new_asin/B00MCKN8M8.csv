6568073,5,B00MCKN8M8,"Peaky Blinders is one of those series you get drawn into instantly.  Not only do you get drawn in, but you end up rooting for the criminals.  In this case the criminals are a family of working class folks named Shelby from post WWI lead by the second oldest, Tommy.

Peaky Blinders was the name adopted by this criminal enterprise owing to the fact razor blades were sewn into the bills of their hats, Peakys, and when used as a weapon they were always aimed at the eyes, blinders.

Season Two picks up letting us know which person had been shot at the end of Season One when Grace and Inspector/Major Campbell met at the station.  We heard the single shot but were not privy to the outcome.  Season Two has Insp. Campbell walking with a limp and aid of a cane letting us know Grace had won the proverbial showdown.

The Peakys, in Season Two, aspired to more than just Birmingham.  They wanted into the big time of London.  Unfortunately, Sabini and Solomons ran London.  It would be up to Tommy to come up with a way to enter the city and keep hold from afar.

The six one hour episodes go far too fast.  Just as you get comfortable the season is halfway over.  Blink again and all six episodes have passed you by leaving you wanting for more.",1417132800,8,1245,4.337662337662338

It started out as a bang and ended with a bang, So much to observe in that era.  The French war,  the people of Gypsies. I learned a lot of history from this movie.  it's just as the series Damnation as far as plot, but it wasn't dragged out the episodes flowed, Strait to the point. I love it this show.",1522800000,,403,4.128205128205129

8671629,5,B00MCKN8M8,"I had to wait for the U.S copy of season one to come out but got a universal DVD player when I bought  Season 2. I waited to get season one which they just released in zone one (U.S. and Canada), so I could watch both at the same time and it was great. Now that I have a universal player I also don't' have to wait when season three which is about to start makes it to Amazon. Lord knows when they'll release season 2 in the Zone one.",1446595200,,434,3.8222222222222224

8671633,5,B00MCKN8M8,"This is a must see series.  The entire cast from director to lighting to the acting is absurdly magnificent.  Cillian Murphy kills it with his lowered voice and superb acting skills.  The storyline, with its contrasts through the series is very interesting to pick up on.  I can't say enough about this show.",1424131200,,308,4.754716981132075
