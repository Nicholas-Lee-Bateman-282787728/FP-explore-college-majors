8180019,4,B000NOIWVM,"I had heard about Litaliana in algeri for so long that I was looking for one version among all selections.
 I found the cast very good even though I wasn't familiar with it. The actors could combine the singing with movements around the stage very well, apparently without any effort.
The story is very typical for a buffo comedy, the old married guy (the Turk) looking for a younger lady to be his wife (the Italian) who is in another relationship, after some tricks played on him, he comes back to his senses and everybody is happy.
The music was beautiful, like everything written by Rossini.
The scenery was ridiculous, but adequate according to the story.
The quality of the DVD was not good. It looks like an old movie, scenes are very dark, it is difficult to distinguish the orchestra or people attending to the performance, the colors of the stage were not clear and the picture was not sharp.
I thought for a moment that there was something wrong with my TV/DVD player, but when I saw another DVD I knew that my equipment were fine, not this DVD.
I enjoyed the music and the cast, but the quality of the DVD is not good.",1503792000,,1130,4.458937198067633

8180021,5,B000NOIWVM,"This is a nicely done version of L'Italiana in Algeri.  Despite the farcical nature of the plot, the director has kept the various characters and chaotic encounters clear and easy to follow.  The sets are nicely done.  The singing excellent.  The camera work was not distracting.  The images were clear with good color.  Watching this was lots of fun.",1420243200,,351,4.864406779661017
8180022,4,B000NOIWVM,"L'Italiana in Algeri is one of the best comic operas by Rossini (Gioachino by the way, not Gioacchino). It makes a lot of fun pf an Algerian Bey, who falls in love with a wily Italian woman, and the complications of their relationship. Jennifer Larmore is the mezzo-soprano who sings l'Italiana, and she is quite charming about it. She sings well, but she also sings with gusto, which you must do if you wish to make justice to the role. There is also a good Mustafa and good singers overall. I have enjoyed this production, which is also well conducted (by Campanella) and well directed. Although it is making good fun of some Muslims, it can be considered a lesson is democracy for those people who clamored recently against the production at the Met of  an anti-Israel opera, Death of Klinghofer ( in my opinion, not anti-semitic, but anti-Israel0. No, it is not the best I have seen ( have seen better productions at the Met (with Samuel Ramey) and in Philadelphia (with Juan Diego Florez and Stephanie Blythe), but this is the best I could find available on a DVD and I recommend it.",1416700800,,1088,4.579487179487179
8180023,5,B000NOIWVM,"This is an excellent production from the Paris  Opera that combines wonderful singing with imaginative comic staging. Larmore sings the difficult passages in the title role with ease.  All of the other principal singers  are in good voice, with Alaimo  giving an outstanding comic performance as Mustafa.  Some viewers may find the staging over the top, but, for me, it worked beautifully and added to my overall enjoyment.  The great ensemble number at the end of Act One may the best combination of humor and exuberance I have ever seen on an opera DVD.  Overall, this is a worthy rival to the more conventionally staged 1986 Met production featuring Marilyn Horne.  While I would not want to be without either one, for me the version from Paris takes pride of place.  Highly recommended.",1411171200,,790,4.879699248120301
8180024,5,B000NOIWVM,Finest production of a Rossini Opera I've seen.  Andrei Serban has staged a laugh-out-loud production that Rossini himself would have loved.  If you love Opera this is a must see.  If you hate Opera you owe it to yourself to see this one.  It will change your take on Opera forever.  There is magic in this cast.,1395446400,,312,4.4035087719298245
8180025,5,B000NOIWVM,"This 1998 production of Rossini's lively comic opera from the Paris Opera House was a bit overwhelming at first, although I grew to love it.  Sight gags abound--the flamingoes, the gorilla, the floating size 420 Double-Z breast-balloons, the dancing pizza, the Italian cheerleading squad, and Taddeo flapping his flippers and blowing his stupid whistle.

Taddeo was a sight gag all by himself.  I blame his over-the-top schlock on the French love affair with Jerry Lewis.  Before their infatuation with the American comedian, the French were famous for having produced one of the most elegant civilizations in history.  And after...?

Well, take the visuals during the overture on this DVD.  They begin elegantly with a tour of the beautiful, Second-Empire Palais Garnier, which used to house the Paris Opera, and end up panning a cardboard pin-up of Jennifer Larmore sliding down a pole while dressed in a scanty sailor costume.

Actually, I loved some of the schlock: the pirates with their enormous tattooed latex biceps, white singlets, and cami pants; the eunuchs with their fleshy body molds--all tummies, breasts, and bums; the gangster pappatacis complete with snap-brim fedoras and shiny revolvers.  The all-male chorus had more costume changes than Jennifer Larmore.

And speaking of American mezzo, Jennifer Larmore, she was a clever, beautiful, impetuous Isabella.  Her resounding ""Pensa alla patria"" with the chorus of Italian slaves (dressed in skimpy red, white, and green track suits) was a true showstopper.  Her lustrous voice, with a sexy duskiness in the lower register is perfect for this Rossinian jeu d'esprit.

Bruce Ford was a cheerful Lindoro with a roving eye.  Tenors are often kept busy scrubbing floors or plucking chickens during their opening cavatina, ""Languir per una bella.""  Ford 'carves' a nude, gold-plated statue of his beloved Isabella while he sings of his longing for her.

Italian bass-baritone Simone Alaimo actually sings the coloratura role of Mustaf, rather than trying to buffo his way through it.  I have a sneaking fondness for a Bey who really eats the spaghetti during the pappatacci scene, as Alaimo did.  He usually affected the dress of the late, unlamented leader of Libya, although he wore a Roman emperor's garb for his meeting with Isabella (one of the more uninhibited emperors).  He has also sung this role at Chicago's Lyric Opera and at the Royal Opera in London, and it is easy to see why he is in demand.

This cartoonish, over-the-top Italian Girl sports some excruciatingly slow tempi, most notably in ""Languir per una bella"" and Isabella's beautiful ""Per lui che adoro,"" but otherwise it is very easy on the ear.  I recommend it to fellow Rossini fans who are looking for something completely different.",1331596800,6,2771,5.154362416107382
8180026,5,B000NOIWVM,"This 1998 production of the Paris national Opera is a delight for the most part. L""Italiana is Rossini's first comic masterpiece. It has fun and nonstop humor along with glorious music. Bruno Campanella leads a sparkling orchestral performance-very importanat in Rossini. There is a warm,vivacious Italian snap to the whole production. Isabella is the star of the  show and Jennifer Larmore has this role down pat. The mezzo must have good lower tones and Larmore produces them better than any mezzo i have heard except Tetesa Berganza. Larmore is attractive, charming and funny. The second longest role is that of the Bey of Algiers, Mustafa. He must be a pompous ass who is still lovable! Simone Alaimo is wonderful in the role. His rich bass blends beautifully in the many ensembles he sings as a partner. A real bonus in this performance is the Taddeo of Alessandro Corbelli. Taddeo is the butt of much of the humor and Corbelli really makes the most of the part. The tenor,Bruce ford sings Lindoro pretty well. Ford has a sense of the bel canto style. Lindoro does not have a lot of solo scenes compared to the tenor in say, La Cenerentola, but his first act Cavatina must get your attention and develop sympathy for Lindoro. I could imagine a great Rossinian tenor such as Juan Diego Flores as better for this role or how about Lawrence Brownlee. I see that Brownlee will soon appear on a new compact disc version of L'Italiana. In the meantime Ford will do nicely as he fits into the madcap nature of this production. There are some grotesque costumes and stage props in this production but they are not carried to utter excess. This opera is really a fun experience  and this production sparkles. Although I would not surrender Marilyn Horne's wonderful Isabella from the Met on DVD, this is the production to have if you can only have one!",1274400000,3,1848,4.718266253869969
8180027,5,B000NOIWVM,"For a load of fun this opera takes the cake. It is high camp, and very well acted as well as sung, by the end of the opera i was left bemused .
The 3 main characters cast a shadow of doubt on my mind , did Isabella (sung by Jennifer Larmore) have a fetish for leather or plastic (her costume gave me that impression) or was she just a merry hooker.
 Lindoro,(sung by Bruce Ford) was he the boy friend or the pimp as well as being the favourite slave of Mustafa
And was Mustafa (sung by Simone Alaimo) the client (or was this just my wishful thinking??) as well as the egotistical Bey of Algiers.
Everything in this production was acted and played to the limit the singing was excellent, the costumes outragious.
It is a fun filled production and well worth the purchase.
I highly recommend it to anyone with a wicked sense of humour",1212019200,5,832,4.265822784810126
8180028,4,B000NOIWVM,"This was my second Italiana, the first being the performance from Germany with Doris Soffel.  The production (originating in Zurich) is stylish, conventional and effective.  Vocally the only flaw is the Mustafa, a singer more at home with Alberich.  In the performance under consideration that is hardly the case with the wonderful Simone Alaimo.  Jennifer Larimore is a glamorous Isabella, vocally agile, witty and quite delightful.  Bruce Ford is an experienced Rossinian, looks good and act well, but he really is not at home with the coluratura and his top tends to tighten up and overall the voice is uneven.

The production is a mix of whimsy, the silly, the extraneous and occasionally awful.  Serban, the director had some good ideas but apparently when they hire someone with his reputation isn't there anyone who can question the antics that he requires of the singers?  It isn't truly awful (Dario Fo can take that credit on the new Italian from Pesaro; at least is can boast the superb Lindoro of Maxim Mironov who leaves all the rest in the dust) but one does wonder how a production can veer from being witty and delightful to highly questionable.  It isn't a deal breaker for someone considering this DVD, and I would hate to hand the prize for direction to Michael Hampe (the Soffel DVD) inasmuch as he is working on a stage probably no larger than the Teatro Verdi, but he certainly trumps Fo who surely doesn't much more space in Pesaro.

It's obvious I have three performances and enjoy all three, but alas to attain the ""ideal"" I have to indulge in cast shifting, a fantasy that opera lovers have to do all the time.",1186185600,16,1636,4.72887323943662
