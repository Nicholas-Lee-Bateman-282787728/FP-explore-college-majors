-1 Star for being in DVD-R format. The description doesn't mention this. Check your DVD player before purchasing to make sure it plays DVDs in the DVD-R format. My el-cheapo DVD player doesn't! I had to watch this on my parents' DVD player. Combine that with....
-1 star for having to buy 9 DVDs to get the whole series! There are 18 (1/2 hour?) episodes, with 2 episodes per DVD. At $10 per DVD, that's $90 for the series!!! Most tv series on DVD are less than $50 and are less than 5 DVDs.
The show itself was good. I was just miffed I spent $90 on the DVDs, only to have them not play in my machine! Luckily I didn't return them, because I know a DVD-player-upgrade is in the future.",1252886400,,726,4.23021582733813
