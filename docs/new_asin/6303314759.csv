620081,5,6303314759,"This film was the third of work that join Reggio,G. and Glass,P.. All this films are very strong in mixture sounds and images about our reality. WHen we saw any of this films we will need many time to think about the reality  that they show. Our reflexation is very important to understand our world.  I'm waiting when the others two will come in DVD, too, with the four of  this serie",942883200,5,385,4.319444444444445
620082,4,6303314759,"Incredible footage of nature set to music that generally complements what is being watched.  The only reason I would not give this five stars is the director's fascination with close up shots of the eyes of animals.  Some  may enjoy this, but I found myself dismayed at the use of caged animals  when wild animals in nature are so much more compelling and interesting.  This is worth seeing, however, if you enjoy either nature videos,  documentaries, or somewhat experimental video.",941587200,9,483,4.975
620083,5,6303314759,"Another fine work by Reggio. My three-year-old loved it. Especially the part where he saw ""stingrays eating spaceships."" A great demo disc as well.",934934400,5,147,5.166666666666667
620184,4,6303314759,"Yes, it's directed by Godfrey Reggio, no, it's not like the hopelessly overrated Koyaanisqatsi but with animals, but it is a beautifully filmed, meditative close up of animals in the wild. As others have noted, the running time is quite short.",1170115200,,243,4.951219512195122
620185,3,6303314759,"This film is good, its not the best though because at thirty minutes it really cuts its self short. Sure its a short film, but the subject matter it is trying to deal with just can't be properly covered in thirty minutes. Even so its worth a watching,
but too bad the DVD is poor in the visual quality. Glass is great with the music, as usual. The film Microcosmos and the film Baraka are actually better films in dealing with nature.
Check them out too.",1055289600,14,454,4.290697674418604
620186,5,6303314759,"1991: Anima Mundi is Latin for ""Soul of the World"". In this dazzling documentary, the life of animals from land and sea are captured with exquisite precision and beauty. The careful attention to detail makes this documentary simply the best about life on planet earth. The shots of wildlife in Africa, the foliage, the various life forms under the sea are all in perfect union, making this film a reminder to us that planet earth is a living being, complete with its own intelligence, biological function and even its own spirit.
I recall seeing this in both film format and in the extra large IMAX screen. The cinematography to the documentary is breathtaking. Although it is only 30 minutes long, there is much to learn about the life on this planet by watching this documentary, which is very short but meaningful. The music is composed by none other than the brilliant 20th century composer Phillip Glass- whose technique of minimalism is haunting and effective, particularily in the shots of the sea creatures. Phillip Glass' work for this short film ranks as one of his finest, although it is very short and precise. Phillip Glass and Anima Mundi go together almost like two blending chemicals. Finally, on DVD, the greatest documenatary, albeit the shortest, is available for viewing.",1048723200,11,1291,4.953917050691245
620187,5,6303314759,"If looking into animals' eyes feels a bit on the disturbing side, perhaps the point of this incredible compilation of film footage is to invite the audience to view the complex balance of this planet from the animals' eyes.
This (albeit short) video entices you in with the grace of leaping gazelles, pulls you along with the overwhelming strength of the ocean and transports you to a new perspective of life, from the bellowing breath of an industrialized city down to the excited dance of the most basic cells under a microscope, and magically returns you back into the gaze of the animal's eye.
The beautifully powerful music combined with equally compelling images are guaranteed to stay with you for years!
Excellent investment!",1039651200,6,733,4.967479674796748
620188,1,6303314759,"Not worth owning, and probably not even worth viewing if you are used to current DVD quality. Be warned: this is a faux 16:9 video (the black bands are part of the signal) and has some digital artifacts. The net effect is to destroy the experience of what (in the theater) was stunning. Unless you are stuck using an old TV and a low-end DVD player, you should avoid this. On an HDTV-capable system this will disappoint.",1039305600,20,420,4.467532467532467
620189,2,6303314759,"Koyaanisqatsi is simply one of the most creative project i've ever seen. I really liked it and would recommend it to anyone. But believe me, i bought Anima Mundi in mint condition : considering it is out of print and was directed by Godfrey Reggio it cost a lot of money and does not worth it at all. Koyaanisqatsi has now been release, Anima Mundi should follow, and evidence as well. Anima is not amazing; it's interesting but not for this price.",1034640000,3,448,4.475609756097561
620190,2,6303314759,"Good thing this is out of print.  I hope they reissue a better quality DVD.  This is one of the worst-authored discs I have ever seen.  I first saw the film on VHS and wish I'd bought it that way--this thing really looks like an mpeg file.  To give you an idea of just how bad this is, the black of the end credits has brown-grey squares (perfect squares all the same size) flashing throughout it the entire time--and no, they are not supposed to be there.
Reggio and Glass created a brilliant short subject that should have won an Oscar.  Perhaps a reissue could be coupled with Reggio's unreleased shorts _Evidence_, and music video ""Patricia's Park"" could be included, if the rights were available, but more important would be a DVD without such heavy ""artifacting,"" ""pixillation,"" ""blockiness,"" whatever you want to call it.  Those of us with the Apex that can play anything and anywhere are particularly screwed since it's not as good at hiding such defects.
This is the sort of film that only film conoisseurs are going to appreciate it, so why not give it a high quality release?",1009324800,38,1086,4.630208333333333
620191,2,6303314759,"I have read the other customer reviews that praise this DVD.  In fact, that is the only reason I bought it.  And now I am left wondering what I am  missing.  I have seen it twice and still can't find the genius in this  production.  I am sure the raw footage was breathtaking.  However, the  clips are too short and the editing doesn't seem to flow.  The music is  overbearing and unnecessarily focal, as if the director is depending on the  soundtrack to lend coherency to the film.  Give me National Geographic's  stock footage library and a Mozart CD and I'll make a better production  than this.",966470400,7,599,4.4766355140186915
620192,4,6303314759,"An interesting feature of the DVD which I think communicates something of the essence of this movie is that the text used to communicate the idea ""play"" is ""play continuously"".  The film is composed of  around a hundred separately filmed 15-30 second nature scenes, which is  pretty short for a DVD and pretty disconnected for a traditional film.  You  will find though that people can't walk by without stopping to  stare...
The sound quality is listed as a 5 in the ratings provided by  widescreen review, but if you look at the technical details you'll see it  listed as ""hi-fi sound"".  That means NOT 5.1 surround, which is  quickly becoming the standard for a modern release and which is immediately  noticed if you have, like me, become accustomed to the high quality sound  that DVD has to offer.  Anyway, Phil Glass' music is one of the best parts  of the film, bringing continuity to what otherwise is a somewhat haphazard  collection of wildlife shots.  Granted, there are some thematics in the way  that the shots are composed, but without the music, you'd be wondering what  (and why) you were watching (try it).
The movie also comes with three  annoying copyright notices at the beginning that you can't fast forward  through.  Finally, it was filmed in Italy (hence Anima Mundi - i.e.,  ""Soul of the World"").
Overall, an enjoyable 30 minute diversion  - a light snack if you will.  Hope you enjoy it.",964828800,6,1414,4.74793388429752

7842962,4,6303314759,"In the style of Koyaanisqatsi, Godfrey Reggio and Philip Glass teamed up to create this short film for the World Wildlife Fund. It features visually fascinating scenes of animals large and small. Not as great as some of the footage in the Planet Earth series (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-Earth-The-Complete-BBC-Series-Blu-ray/dp/B000MRAAJM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet Earth: The Complete BBC Series [Blu-ray</a>], but Anima Mundi (originally released in 1992) predates that series by more than a decade.

7842963,4,6303314759,"Went looking for this after listening to the original music elsewhere.

7842964,5,6303314759,"Ever since I saw and taped this from tv many years ago I wanted a commercial copy. Even though it's only 30 minutes long its still mesmerizing and beautiful. I bought a new, still in the original factory shrink-wrapped vhs tape because the reviews on the dvd were so horrible. The vhs version is in wide screen with no artifacts, so I was very pleased with it. Maybe someday a good dvd of ""Anima Mundi"" will be released.",1303344000,,420,4.397435897435898
7842965,4,6303314759,"This video is truly a work of art both visually and musically.  The photography is top-notch and the visual images are well-coordinated with constant stream of beautiful images.  I don't know if the video was updated since some other reviewers wrote their reviews, but I play my version on an HDTV with an upper end DVD and I don't find it a ""negative experience"" at all.  While the video quality is not HDTV, it still very aesthetically pleasing.  I imagine it would be spectacular in a theatre, but it is still very impressive in my living room.

There is no talking in this video and it is very much felt experience to watch it.  There are many interesting animals, magnified protists, algae, etc.  There are also kelp forests, many sea creatures, a live volcano and many ocean pictures.

As is pointed out in the editorial reviews, Anima Mundi means world soul.  This video tries to capture a sense of this and it succeeds marvelously.  If you are looking for a documentary, this is not it, but it never was positioned this way in the market.

You can get more information on the Anima Mundi as a concept on the Internet.  There is at least one terrapsychology website that can go into more detail on what this term means and what this video is trying to convey.  I think it's great for anyone, but it would make a particularly good classroom video and it's just the right length for this purpose.",1176508800,,1401,4.556
7842966,2,6303314759,"With director Godfrey Reggio at the helm - and with a 30 minute running time - I was expecting to be overwhelmed by the might and majesty of the animal kingdom packed into a half-hour package.

Unfortunately, I find a less-than lackluster video transfer by the Richard Diercks Company, Inc. -likely from the source material for the videocassette- with resolution equal to s-vhs. The image is slightly 'jerky' due to it being shot in 24fps and increased to 30fps. Add to the list of flaws: muted colors, poor contrast and a purplish line on the far left side of the screen.

Still, I could have been 'wowed' by stellar cinematography but alas, much of what is shown onscreen is stock footage. Some of the slow motion scenes are nicely done but others (again, stock footage?) were shot at standard speed and frames were duplicated to replicate slow motion. Personally, I find the technique distracting.

However, being the animal lover that I am I was moved by many of the shots in the film. The soundtrack is a typical, yet pleasing Philip Glass score and complements the images onscreen.

With all the problems I have with this product, I do hope it will be remastered from the original source material for an HD-DVD release.

Cheers.",1174262400,2,1234,4.747663551401869
