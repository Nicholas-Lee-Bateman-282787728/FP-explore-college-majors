8316618,5,B001KZH88Q,"This is truly a marvelous movie about how a family deals with the loss of a son/brother.  The original title of the book is: The Aftermath.  The author is American.  Mr. Scott Campbell.  The highs and lows here are what makes this film most interesting and enjoyable.  Wonderful scenery of the German countryside in winter with snow capped mountains, lakes and streams.  The version that I have has English sub-titles which were spot on with translation.

Thanks for reading,

Tony",1391126400,,481,4.925
