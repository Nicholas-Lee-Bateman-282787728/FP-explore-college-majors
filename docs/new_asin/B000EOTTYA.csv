8112045,4,B000EOTTYA,A must for any Lucio Fulci fan. One of his giallo-like films. Full of suspense that will keep you watching.,1369353600,,107,4.4
8112046,5,B000EOTTYA,"Lucio Fulci's Murder Rock is a brilliant Giallo. For those familiar with his work they'll be happy to know that this one is pretty fun, straightforward and fast paced. Fulci cut on the Gore this time to bring us something different, a very good Mystery/Thriller with good twists. Probably one of the best of his late career and a perfect addition to the 80's italian Giallo masterpieces.

Unlike Fulci's other movies, Murder Rock is not as dark and obscure, it has a very bright tone to it. Laughter, Music, Dance and Choreography are very present throughout the whole movie, making it a very entertaining ride all the way through the end. Dont get me wrong, this is not a comedy, far from it, its a Giallo at 100%, sometimes brutal and merciless but its fresh and its fun too. I think Fulci and the crew had a lot of fun making it. Never had that feeling before while watching a Fulci film. Catchy rock tunes from the 80's and dancy music is also something we don't hear very often in Fulci's movies. Although slightly different in terms of style,the movie is still on par with Argento's horror masterpiece ""Opera"", just a little more groovy musically.

Aside from working very hard to make sure they'll be chosen to perform in the next competition, the dancers from a prestigious ballet/workout School in NY are in deep trouble when they finnd out that a killer on the loose is trying to kill them one by one......... The cinematography/Photography here is exceptional,way above many films of that era,the colors are vivid, the picture is crisp, clear and of very high quality. I've rarely seen a movie of that era with such a nice picture quality. The darker scenes are also very well done,that little dark blue tint is simply amazing, it adds on increasing the gravity of the scenes which are already very atmospheric. The film itself easily deserves 4 stars but the photography/Cinematography is so good that it also deserved one.

This movie will be welcome in any horror fan collection, especially italian giallo fans. It is seriously overlooked and underrated. Better than many late fulci films in my opinion.

ENJOY!!!!",1354060800,,2128,4.774456521739131
8112047,5,B000EOTTYA,"Ok, so a lot of ""fans"" of the genre (giallo) or of the director (Fulci) don't like this one.  I think the biggest reason for that is because Fulci is the ""Godfather of Gore"" and this movie has next to none.  It was obviously a chance to cash in on the Flashdance craze, but it's cashing in in a seedy, dirty, Italian mystery kinda way.  I really like this one, and think overall it is one of Fulci's best films, but completely underrated.  If you like gialli, and can stand to chuckle at some 80's legwarmers dancing fools, check this one out.",1328400000,4,543,4.294117647058823
8112048,4,B000EOTTYA,"Ok, it's nowhere near as good as Zombi 2, The Beyond, City Of The Living Dead, Lizard In A Woman's Skin, Don't Torture A Duckling, etc... But it's still a pretty good movie! It has a few plot holes, it doesn't have any gore (surprisingly) and the music is really cheesy, but it's pretty entertaining, it has a great suspensful atmosphere (during the killings) and a great twist ending (the killer is the character that I expected the least to be the killer)!

See it, but don't expect too much.

3.5 stars.",1228780800,5,506,4.489130434782608
8112049,1,B000EOTTYA,"I'm so depressed that this movie is a Lucio Fulci film. It completely lacked ANY gore or scares and it bored me the ENTIRE time! Fulci is well known for his in-your-face gore as seen in previous films such as Zombie, The Beyond or even House By The Cemetary. All of those films are almost INSANELY disgusting at times and it was always a big perk of viewing Fulci's films to anticipate the oncoming carnage. However, with Murder Rock, there is literally NONE. You see a needle peirce a chest in EVERY murder scene. There is literally a drop of blood! That's it!!! I was completely let down by this film. The HORRENDOUS dance routines were totally 1980's jazzersize-and not in a good way. The music is God Awful. What was up with that opening cheese-fest ballad???? I was literally staring at my tv thinking, ""Is this really happening? Am I really hearing these lyrics?? Did a couple of people pulled off the street just sing a song about believing in yourself and taking chances? Tonight is your night??? Are you kidding me?!!"" By far the WORST opening scene to a film I have ever seen in all 27 years of my life.

Don't even bother to waste your time on this film. It's dull, gore-free and pointless. Not even a good killer. Bad, boring and Blah!",1217462400,,1247,4.493392070484582
8112050,3,B000EOTTYA,"...I had never heard of this movie before I saw myself staring at it at the store.  As soon as I saw the name ""Fulci"" I was almost sold.  I knew being a different kind of film from the usual Fulci gorefests, that this one would not be like those, but I gave it a chance anyway.  I was surprised, it was not as bad as I thought it would be.  In this movie you can see a different type of Fulci, as there is not gore---yes there is killing but it is only stabbing.  I liked the 80's music, it gave the film authenticity for its time.  If you appreciate the work of Lucio Fulci give this one a try, it is different from his other films, but not bad  by any means.  I liked it way better than Anthropaphagus (I know they have nothing in common, but I feel I wasted by money on that stinker).  Worth viewing at least once, if you can afford it I would add it to your library of Fulci works.",1156982400,5,885,3.9269662921348316
