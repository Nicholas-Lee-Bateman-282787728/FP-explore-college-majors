2062684,5,B00024WGP6,"An Altered Journey with Tim Holtz is a perfect how-to product. Every technique is presented clearly and completely and was filmed from angles that allow you to see, up close, exactly what the artist is doing with his hands every step of the way...I felt like I was sitting next to him. The projects are beautiful and the techniques are diverse, versatile and clearly explained.  The most surprising aspect for me was how applicable these techniques could be to my own work as a polymer clay artist.  I thought this DVD was going to be geared exclusively to rubber stampers but that was not the case.  There is something here for everyone regardless of your medium or interest; jewelry, collage, scrapbooks, altered books, painting, fiber arts, rubberstamping and more.  I took away something that I could use from each and every technique...though in truth, it would have been worth watching for Tim's studio tips alone.
Another aspect that I particularly enjoyed was the unprecedented number of gallery pieces shown.  At the end of each segment there is a mini-gallery; you get to see, not just the finished project featured in that segment but also many other projects made with that same technique.  In addition, there is a comprehensive gallery feature on the menu which lets you skip straight to the eye candy and includes not only more detailed, up close views of all of the artwork featured at the end of each segment but also many additional pieces of artwork that are found nowhere else on the DVD. I was amazed at the sheer number and scope of pieces in the gallery...it's incredible and inspiring and would, all by itself, have been worth the price of admission.
Finally, I am thrilled with the DVD format.  It is incredibly easy to navigate, it enabled me to instantly and easily revisit any segment I was interested in and offered wonderful features.  In the extras section for instance, there is a complete collection of all of the fabulous tips that were scattered throughout , a comprehensive listing of all of the stamps that Tim uses and even a bloopers segment. Marvelous.  I highly recommend An Altered Journey and will be watching for other PageSage productions with interest; it was simply the best how-to product I have ever seen.",1086739200,38,2253,4.8311688311688314
2062685,5,B00024WGP6,"Tim Holtz goes on a wonderous journey through altered art and takes us along for the ride.  The innovative use of luggage as a prop to display the materials used for each project (which are also listed on the interior of case, brilliant!) grabbed my attention at the beginning of the movie and never let go.  I use the word movie, because that's what it felt like.  Great camera angles, you can see exactly what you need to for each step.  Wonderful sound quality, no one is speaking from inside a barrel on this one.  The show captures the playful nature of Tim Holtz, and his innovative and beautiful art!  Finally, we have a product that is truely interactive.  See something in the gallery you like, click on it and your are intantly transported to that section of the show.  No more searching for the segment you need.  This is instant gratification at its finest.  My favorite project is Faux Batik.  The steps are clear, and the end result is stunning!  My hat's off to the producer of this DVD, someone has listened to artists...""We want quality!""  With Altered Journey, we got it!",1083801600,8,1089,4.580310880829016
2062686,5,B00024WGP6,"It does not matter if you are a seasoned stamper or just starting out, there is something for everyone in this DVD. No jerky camera, strange angles and voices bouncing around an empty room. This is one class act. Not only is the DVD top notch but you can actually jump from one place to another or just let it run. There is a gallery included with dozens of pieces of artwork. If you want to know how a piece was made you can click on it and the segment showing that technique comes up. This is truly interactive. Even after watching this DVD several times you will pick up tips you missed before. This is another addition to the fine line of stamping and crafting DVD's coming out of the folks at PageSage. They are setting the bar very high for not only quality but length of time as well. An Altered Journey with Tim Holtz is over an hour and a half in length!
His Brushless Watercolor segment is beautiful. Just as valuable as the more than half a dozen techniques are the tips Tim shares.
Grab your stamps and enjoy the show.
While you are here check out Stamp Art Inspirations with MaryJo McGraw also available on Amazon.com. Several titles are in the works and the PageSage web site will have up to date information.",1083542400,5,1223,4.368421052631579
2062687,5,B00024WGP6,"Usually, when I watch a video or show about stamping, I do something else and just listen for new tips and ideas.  I had to stop everything and start over from scratch on this one!  Tim is not only easy on the eyes (what a cutie!), but he's organized, clearly spoken, moves quickly and cleanly through his instruction and has a great tip or idea with just about every breath he takes!  I simply can't say enough about this one.  If you are into scrapping, he's got ideas for you.  If you are a stamper, hold onto your hat! you'll be blown away.  New products, new ways to approach old techniques, it's all here.
The DVD is a breeze to navigate.  Pause it, run it backward, just like a VCR tape.  But, omigosh, you can jump around! See artwork you want to review instructions for? Click and you're there!  No talking heads, either.  You get to see Tim (yum!) but when he's showing you stuff, you see the work! not his face.  None of this 'far across the room stuff' either.  You're in his lap (sigh) or on his shoulder, watching his every move!
Want to learn the new hot stuff?  Get some class in  your artwork (be it scrapping, stamping, altered books, memory boxes or whatever!)?  Get this DVD!  More bang for the buck than I've had in any class in a loooooong time!",1083456000,,1267,4.327659574468085
2062688,5,B00024WGP6,What an inspiration this DVD is. Many new techniques along wtih some twists to some not so new. Tim is fun to watch and hear.  His step by step instructions are great.  A must have for any stamper/scrapper.,1083369600,2,206,4.394736842105263
2062689,5,B00024WGP6,"I actually bought this video at a scrapbook store after attending a Tim Holtz session in2002 (I have an autographed DVD case), before he became really famous in the craft world.  I played it so much that the inside spokes of the DVD broke!  I was thrilled to find it available through Amazon.  He's easy to follow and the techniques are fun to try.

I'd also recommend buying the second video - The Journey Continues.",1388707200,,417,4.52
2062690,5,B00024WGP6,This video is chock full of techniques and ideas to create a variety of art using fiber based as well as other materials.  The demonstrations are very easy to understand .

2062696,5,B00024WGP6,"*****
I bought this DVD because I thought it would be much better than a class in that I could play it again and again to learn various techniques. I was right! It's a great DVD---fun, interesting, and covers everything step by step. It also repeats steps several times in different ways so that you can actually grasp the methods (although it is not boring or repetitive).

There is enough explanation for a beginner like myself, but I don't think that this would be boring for an advanced stamper/crafter---much of it is creative ideas that everyone can benefit from. Some of the techniques involve expense (alcohol-based dyes, pasta machine, silk fabric, etc.) so if you have no supplies like me, it could be costly to pursue. Many of the techniques do just involve basic stamping supplies, however, and any of the projects can stand alone. If you can't afford many supplies you can improvise many ideas that you learn in various ways into your own projects.

It explains craft tools as well, types of ink, etc. Most steps are shown in real time. At the end of each project there are additional examples for each technique (called mini-galleries) with variations and more ideas.

There are ten projects: brushless watercolor, distressing with ink, one page books and cards, embellishments, alcohol ink agates, brayered embossing, faux batik, fragments from clay, faux soldering, ""domino diary"" (small book with altered domino as cover), and altered scrapbooking. Other topics explored include cards, tags, using scarps, dying fabric, clear embossing, jewelry, clay stamping, cards with wearable pins and some rudimentary bookbinding.

At first I was dismayed because the DVD has a heavy focus on stamping. I'd never done stamping and thought it was pretty straight forward and limited. Did I buy the wrong DVD? Absolutely not. To my surprise I fell in love. I even purchased the next DVD in this series called ""The Journey Continues with Tim Holtz"". I was amazed at the range of what can be done with stamps!

Special features include a gallery at the end, which is a review of all projects, with pictures of examples that are variations. Tim Holtz narrates the gallery with a monologue about altered scrapbooking, creativity, inspiration, classes, being an artist, teaching, and supplies. When you see a tip or a sample that apppeals to you, you can jump quickly and directly to the technique. This is very handy.

Extras include: tips from projects all compiled in one place, metric conversions, bloopers, stamps and supplies used in projects, and info about other PageSage DVDs. SO much better than a class!

Very well done, and highly recommended.",1221609600,3,2654,5.0181818181818185
2062697,4,B00024WGP6,"This is good stuff, particularly for the avid urban scrap booker who is bored with the ""cutsy"" stuff that one finds in most scrapbooks, or in the online stores. A step by step read that brings a lot of new elements and sentiments to the scrap table. I particularly enjoyed the new and different ways to use around the house or old scrap book stuff. An overall good series for those looking for ideas outside the usual comfort zone",1217462400,,430,4.455696202531645
2062698,5,B00024WGP6,I really enjoyed this dvd.  It is well produced with clear instructions and excellent camera angles.  It has really spurred my creativity.  I would highly recommend ths to anyone interested in creating their own art.,1195603200,,216,5.114285714285714
2062699,5,B00024WGP6,"An Altered Journey by Tim Holtz is just what you want if you would like a private class in all of his fantastic scapbooking techniques.  I've watched it over and over again and have gained so much more creativity in my scrapbooking work.  I'm going to order the ""continued"" DVD too.

2062700,5,B00024WGP6,"I love Tim's style of projects.  He overloads his pieces and I do the same with my own.  This DVD is great for the beginner learning different ink techniques.  To be honest, most of it I already had learned in my local scrapbook classes but I did get a few ideas.  I must say though,,,what is with the suitcase already??!! OH my gosh,,sooo queeer!  It was like an episode of Mr. Rogers giving an art class.  The 2nd video to me is better and thank goodness....no suitcase! ROFLOL  Sorry Tim,,,I just had to say what everyone else was thinking!  It's worth buying,  especially if you don't have access to local classes.",1192665600,,618,4.495495495495495

2062702,5,B00024WGP6,"I have watched this DVD and while I haven't made any of the projects, I intend to.  The format of this DVD is just like taking a class.  You get the supply list up front and then you start with easy step by step instructions.  Tim also offers extra samples at the end of each session to show you more possibilities.  I can't wait to order his second Journey to add to my collection and learn some more.  You can actually make the projects shown in this DVD.",1174348800,2,457,4.1477272727272725
2062703,5,B00024WGP6,"I was so impressed with the quality of this DVD by Tim Holtz and PageSage as Producer that I have already reseached every DVD PageSage has done and will do.  They explain every technique in detail, give  it to you  by chapter, then give you  a chapter on what they used SPECIFICALLY so you can go buy it, WHICH I DID! They give you a chapter on other projects done with the techniques also.  They even have a bloopers chapter-much fun.  I was so impressed with how Tim explained the difference between Ranger distressed inks and normal inks - I had bought some and never had gotten the difference in how to use them.  I love his laid back style in teaching and made it less intimating to learn.  I am going to by the second CD and can't wait for more to come.",1171929600,4,759,4.222222222222222
2062704,4,B00024WGP6,"I love this DVD!  The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because I'm having trouble with the volume.  The sound is very weak, but the video is 1st rate.  The production values are high and the content is great.  The beautiful projects are fully described as Tim demonstrates each step and provides a complete list of supplies needed for each. The menu is easy to navigate and very user friendly.  If you enjoy Tim Holtz, you will love this video.  It is well worth the price.",1169078400,,484,4.382022471910112
2062705,5,B00024WGP6,"I had Tim's Distress Inks as part of my rubberstamping supplies, but really didn't know what to do with them.  This DVD goes through various techniques of using Tim's products.  His DVD is now in our local library collection for the rubber stampers in our community to enjoy.  I've already signed it out twice!",1168473600,,310,4.703703703703703
2062706,5,B00024WGP6,"I've been scrapbooking for ten years. Stamping is newer to me.

I'd become interested in ink-related artistic techniques. I recently purchased Distress Ink pads, alcohol inks and several books on the subject including ""INK ESSENTIALS"" ""WALNUT INK"" by Design Originals. Although the books were pretty, they really didn't SHOW you how to make the projects, what type of stamp ink to use with the project, whether to stamp first or dye paper first etc.

This video is a dream come true. Not only is it visually inspiring and artistically gorgeous, but Tim gives such clear and helpful heartfelt instructions that after watching you know exactly what to do. What a fabulous DVD!!!  I was a bit worried about spending $30 for it, but with the products on the table and not knowing what to do with them, I splurged. I'm not sorry I did. I will recommend this DVD to every stamper & scrapbooker I know.

Every stamp company and craft company should make a DVD like this. It would really improve business.  I'd love to see a Penny Black DVD with her brush strokes stamping techniques.  The catalogs are all beautiful, but sometimes you just need to SEE for yourself. That's why Carol Duvall's show is such a huge hit.",1161388800,6,1209,4.706161137440758
2062707,5,B00024WGP6,"Excellent DVD. The presentations are clear, easy to follow and inspiring, too. Easy to navigate. Tim is a wonderful teacher and great artist. There is even a section with bloopers (but I haven't viewed that yet. . .) I recommend this DVD not only for doing altered books, but any kind of paper art, including greeting cards which is what I do a lot of. Great techniques, fabulous results. two thumbs way up!!",1142726400,9,408,4.602739726027397
2062708,5,B00024WGP6,"I watched the entire video from start to end and then watched again the next night!  I was so inspired by the projects that I found it difficult to sleep.

I've seen Tim Holtz on several occasions and love his ideas and creations.",1140566400,12,230,4.325581395348837
2062709,5,B00024WGP6,"I had entered a craft store ready to pick up some supplies for an altered book that I had seen on a TV show, but, whoa! all the choices! So I got just a few things for this one project. I didn't seem to remember how it was done, and the online description was lacking. So I bought an altered book how-to from amazon.com that had similar ideas, but wasn't quite able to get into it.

Next, I ordered this DVD from amazon.com, and now I'm creating some great stuff. With a not so modest investment, I have  the tools and knowledge to really get into mixed media like I had wanted. This DVD shows what you need and how to use it for several techniques. Plus, owning it, I can review easily. Now that I have a mess of supplies, I've gotten a group together so we can share and make stuff.",1140566400,12,784,4.117647058823529
2062710,5,B00024WGP6,This video is well done for its content and its production.  It offers many helpful hints about using craft supplies as well as demonstrating several projects to make.

2062713,5,B00024WGP6,This product was reccomended to me at a stamping class.  I was not disappointed when I received it.  Tim has great ideas and takes stamping to a different level.  I like to be able to watch it again and stop before trying a new application.  I also love the ranger ink products.  A fan from Texas!,1122422400,6,297,4.232142857142857
2062714,5,B00024WGP6,"I have this DVD and it is well worth the price.  Let's face it, a class would cost you much more and you'd only sit in it once.  You can watch just parts of it at a time, stop it, and repeat it. Or skip over any part you don't like (can't imagine that)or previously viewed.  Compared to some others (artists on video) I've watched, this flows well, seems well-thought-out and the projects and techniques are truly do-able. I just wish I'd gotten it sooner.",1121644800,5,456,4.341176470588235
2062715,5,B00024WGP6,"And that is an understatement.  Tim obviously takes great pride in the finished product, whether it is a piece of art, or his DVD instruction.  Watching Tim on this DVD truly is like being right there.  You can see exactly what he's doing.  The camera angles don't distort or hide anything he does with ink, paper, or embellishments.  He explains everything thoroughly and moves right along. While Tim moves right along, you don't feel as though he's rushing through things. His tips are practical, and make sense...the first time. And, no, you don't have to be a stamper to make use of the techniques in this book.

This is a DVD you can watch over and over to improve your techniques or to learn more. (And I have wathed it multiple times!)It doesn't matter if you are a beginner, or a pro.  Tim walks you through every step, yet leaves you free to explore your own creativity.

When I said this DVD is like sitting right next to him in class, I wasn't kidding.  After seeing this DVD, I had an opportunity to take six (yes 6)classes from him in two days.  AND I did get to sit right next to him!  The teaching style you see on camera is the same one you see in person, except there are no bloopers at the end.  Many of the techniques we learned were the same as on the DVD, though the projects differed.  Tim has a wonderful, patient way of teaching, including his humor.

Tim does have a new book that just came out recently.  There is more to come, but Tim wasn't spilling the beans yet, so keep watching for more from Tim Holtz!",1120003200,6,1534,4.352112676056338

Even if you are a relatively new stamper, as I am, there is nothing intimidating about this DVD and the projects therein.  Tim makes it all look so easy, and it really is.

Tim Holtz does a brilliant job of simplifying the various techniques and the instructions, camera angles, and sound are exceptional.
