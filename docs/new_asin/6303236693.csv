7841465,4,6303236693,"Back when I was a kid I saw this on VHS-recorded-from-cable (and I'll bet it was a straight-to-cable release), probably wasn't something I was supposed to be watching without supervision at that age, which made it all the more enticing when I caught the first 10 or 15 minutes.  That blonde babe is HOT.  And it's weird but cool to see Linda Blair in this movie also.  I did finally see some of the silly action sequences later in the movie, bad in a funny way, but to me that's not what I like.  It's that first sexy scene, and the setting (nice backyard party/reception at a lush property, with a quiet tryst in the barn).  Plus the shower scene (more reminiscing about the barn tryst) and the health club, the cool hot tub rooms and just the overall cozy 80s feel of those places, compared to the slightly cold and impersonal marble warehouses that health clubs usually are today.  It's great to look back, so to me this movie is very nostalgic.",1374624000,2,948,4.4508670520231215

Only buy if you get into GRADE B 80's movies.",1057708800,3,194,4.0
