7973300,5,B00006SFJH,"This movie doesn't live up to its description on the DVD cover.  The characters are there but in the actual movie Jazmine is never really Wes's girlfriend.  He just claims her on principle.  She is actually the wife of someone Wes set up.  The movie was full of action and if you could follow the plot it was pretty good.  Not one of the best movies that I've seen but it not as bad as some that I've seen recently.  I enjoyed Don ""DC"" Curry's performance as Wes.  Couldn't picture him as a hardened criminal but it was still a good performance.",1255824000,3,545,4.284313725490196
