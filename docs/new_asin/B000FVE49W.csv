8127153,4,B000FVE49W,"What a movie! Must watch. However, DVD quality is not very good. Most probably it was converted from a very old VHS. It's a very difficult movie to find.",1471910400,,153,4.310344827586207
8127154,5,B000FVE49W,"Matched product description, worked as advertised and was well packaged. Was a excellent shopping experience.",1446076800,,109,6.333333333333333
8127155,5,B000FVE49W,Brings back some memories of the harrowing experience I had as a child during the partition of India and the vindictiveness of the majority against the minority!,1385251200,,161,5.0
8127156,4,B000FVE49W,"An excellent film which shows the struggle of Uttar Pradesh Muslims in the immediate aftermath of the Partition with Pakistan, including problems with split families, discrimination in employment and finance, but bridges of friendship as well from unexpected places. Did not give 5 stars because the product is not well made. Subtitles cannot be turned off/on and the video quality is poor. I wanted to screen this for an undergraduate course of non-Hindi speakers but could not due to the poor subtitles which are sometimes illegible.",1380931200,,535,5.232558139534884
8127157,5,B000FVE49W,"Lovely Film!!!
Balraj Sahani is truly one of the best actors Indian cinema has produced.
M.S.Sathyu is a master storyteller.
Dvd copy is disappointing. It is mastered from a married print with embedded subtitles.
Indian cinema should wake up to restoring such classics otherwise we loose out on 100 years of our valuable cinema.
Wake Up call from a true film lover.",1369267200,,365,4.903225806451613
8127158,5,B000FVE49W,A sensitive film .. a classic for all times (for those interested in India's independence and the Partition of the country).,1361145600,,124,4.9523809523809526
8127159,5,B000FVE49W,"Great acting and sets.  Brings out the challenges of a family during the partition period.  Puts into perspective the disruption created by the partition using this family as an example.  Acting by everyone is superb.  Every Indian and Pakistani should see, and then ponder about ways to coexist.  Full of great life lessons that transcend the movie's time frame and genre.",1256256000,,373,5.049180327868853
