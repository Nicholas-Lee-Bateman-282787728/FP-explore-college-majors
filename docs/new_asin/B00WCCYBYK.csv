7130255,5,B00WCCYBYK,"SHOW BOAT: A GREAT OPERA - A GREAT PERFORMANCE.
I have already received (from 'englishpostbox' of amazon.uk) this great dvd which is offered in its complete perfection. I am also glad that the name of the orchestrator - Robert Russell Bennett - is well shown in the libretto and through the credits. This is the way historical american musicals are to be presented (not as Broadway do nowadays badly re-constructing the original beautiful sound). So SHOW BOAT nobly share in a repertoire together with Verdi's or Wagner's works. Nessun complesso d'inferiorit, as we say here. I hope more american musicals will be staged in american opera houses - may I suggest Losser's THE MOST HAPPY FELLA? I might suggest a production with Giorgio Tozzi, impeccable Tony, which ought to be released in the commercial market. Anyway the San Francisco Opera House deserves all the best one can say about this marvellous performance (I have to forget eventual negative comments (perhaps Andy's player?)) ... And in conclusion let me thank Jerome Kern - his music fills my heart and soul and the orchestra here is sublime - take my word for it. Well, thanks to everybody.

Show Boat is THE seminal work in the history of the American ""musical"": extraordinary in its modernity for 1927, original in resolutely tying musical numbers to dramatic action, and superabundant in wonderful melodies and clever lyrics.  This production reflects the highest degree of commitment from everyone involved: principals, chorus, dancers, director, conductor and everyone else.  Tough choices were made to compress all the competing ""versions"" of Show Boat into a not outdated, comprehensible show, and to my way of thinking these choices are overwhelmingly successful.  One might have quibbles here and there, but overall the production is a triumph.  And I would recommend it highly to opera lovers as well.",1468368000,2,805,5.459677419354839

7130268,4,B00WCCYBYK,"Show Boat, which originally opened in 1927, is the single most important production in the history of American musical theater.  It towered in substance over its contemporaries, and preceded Oklahoma!, the show many mistakenly believe to be the genesis of the modern musical, by some sixteen years.

While several film versions of Show Boat exist, none offers the breadth of musical selections from the original as does this production.  It is very nicely videotaped and edited, has a generally strong cast, and offers the sets and ensemble that one would expect from the San Francisco Opera.  Accordingly, it really should be a must-have for anyone with an interest in our musical theater.

That's the short review.  For those familiar with the show and its iterations, and for anyone else with a clinical interest, I want to elaborate and add some caveats.

Missing from this production is the elegiac overture of the 1927 production, replaced by a ""greatest hits"" variation as used in subsequent productions.  The original drew heavily upon the brooding ""Mis'ry's Comin' Around"" number that Flo Ziegfeld insisted be cut from the show itself to the chagrin of Kern and Hammerstein.  Richard Rodgers has written of Ziegfeld's tin ear, and this decision provides ample evidence.  Fortunately, like most modern productions, this version restores the Mis'ry number itself to Act I of the show.

We are also fortunate to have the inclusion of ""Till Good Luck Comes My Way"" and, even more importantly, the sensational ""Hey Feller"" production number.  Alas, the director, Francesca Zambello, chose to omit the delightful comic selection ""I Might Fall Back On You,"" which is a nice showcase for the Frank and Ellie characters.  She also needlessly interpolates ""Dance Away The Night,"" written for a much later production and which is somewhat awkwardly presented here.

While I respect Ms. Zambello and admire her other accomplishments, I do think she makes a number of mistakes in this production.  There are a couple of questionable casting choices.  While John Bolton is a very capable actor, he is simply not as light on his feet as the Frank Schultz character should be.  In a way, Ms. Zambello addresses the issue by reducing his terpsichorean demands, a resolution that is certainly less than ideal for musical theater afficianados

More problematical is the choice of Bill Irwin as Cap'n Andy.  Irwin is talented, but a shameless mugger and egregious over-actor.  It is like casting Jim Carrey in the role.  When I caught the performance live in San Francisco, his constant rubber-legged gyrations drew one's attention constantly.  Fortunately, the camera pans and close-ups of others provide some respite here, but it really is an unfortunate distraction.

And that leads to a broader issue.  Ms. Zambello seems to love over-the-top performances.  Yes, I realize that the San Francisco Opera House is not an intimate venue, but I would still prefer a bit more subtlety across the board.  Of course, others may disagree.

Then there is the libretto itself.  In the bonus material provided on a second DVD, we are told that much of the original dialogue foreshadowed future events in the show and appropriate modifications were made.  What?  WHAT????  This is absolute gibberish.  In fact, much of the original script was flat-out better than the revised libretto created by Ms. Zambello and her colleagues.

In the process of utilizing that red pencil, we are also given a different ending from the original.  Instead of Gay and Nola reuniting during the ascendancy of their daughter, the reunion here occurs while Nola is still a headliner and her daughter in some arrested development stage.  Apparently, this redo is required by Ms. Zambello's feminist sensibilities -- after all, how could a strong woman ever accept back a deserting spouse?  Unfortunately, not only does this change not quite work with the time line presented, but it is simply not as affecting.

Of all the relatively modern productions of Show Boat, the best fully-staged version was that mounted by the Houston Opera in the early 1980's.  The most complete version, however, was presented several years back in a concert format in Dallas.  Sadly, there is no professionally-filmed copy of either available, so we will have to make do with this DVD.

For those truly interested in experiencing Show Boat to its fullest, try to find a copy of John McGlinn's brilliant recording issued in 1988 on the EMI label.  It was an eye-opening experience for me, and is probably the greatest musical theater recording ever made.",1445817600,7,4593,5.086898395721925

Is the acting good, or is it stiff, or it overdone?  Who cares; this is not a four star drama to start with!  Do they put the show across, I believe they do!  As for the singing, they do more than an ample job.  Do you prefer Paul Robeson as Joe, good for you.  The Joe in this production knocked me over, including the littlr action he was involved in.

7130277,3,B00WCCYBYK,"I've always been a little leery when opera singers try their hand at Broadway, Kiri Te Kanawa for example.  Perhaps they're too trained in technique, but the end result never seems as spontaneous or exuberant as Broadway stars.  The San Fransicso Opera production of Showboat succumbs to this pitfall.  Yes, it is a nice textbook example of the show, but seems to fall flat.  It is unfortunate that The Paper Mill production of Showboat was never released commercially, as in comparison to this production, that would be the production to use as the standard to judge all others by.  Not sure what characterization Bill Irwin was going for in his portrayal of Cap'n Andy and Patricia Racette seems miscast as Julie.  I could see her as Magenta in Rocky Horror Picture Show, but not as Julie.  Shelly Burch in The Paper Mill production was really something to see.  As for the leads, Heidi Stober and Michael Todd Simpson, they were adequate.  In an effort to try to include as many of the original songs in the score as possible, the production added various two minute scenes here and there which didn't really add to the overall production.  ""Dance Away the Night"" was not a big production number and added nothing to the story.  ""Hey Feller"" sung by Queenie is indicated in the notes to be a Charleston number, but no one in the AftroAmerican dance troupe danced the Charleston (they did do a big Charleston number in The Paper Mill production).  I had bought two copies of this DVD, one to keep and one to give as a gift.  I'm returning the one I bought as a gift.",1441584000,3,1568,4.597122302158273

But I still prefer the 1936 movie. Even though Irene Dunne was 42 (or thereabouts) when she was singing 18-year-old Magnolia, she was almost perfect. Heidi Stober is too operatic. Allen Jones is sexier and grittier than Michael Todd Simpson as Gaylord. As much as I love Bill Irwin, he's not quite as good as Charlie Winninger. And Patricia Racette is way too statuesque as Julie; she's just not Helen Morgan. Nowhere near the pathos. But the SF Opera does bring back a delightful ""Life Upon the Wicked Stage,"" which the 1936 movie uses only as background music.",1441238400,,709,4.819672131147541

7130286,5,B00WCCYBYK,"As others has noted, this dvd has some technical problems.  My blue ray copy would play on only one of my two blue ray machines; I found
I had to get a non blue ray copy for the other to be able to play it.
That said, once it can be seen, this is a simply wonderful production, as good a musical theatre dvd as I've ever seen.
The performances are excellent, especially the 2 leads & Morris Robinson as Joe.  The singing is superb, acting is excellent, & the
performers look & act the part.  The sets & costumes are excellent & a full (& outstanding) orchestra makes a big difference.  How
wonderful it is to have performers with great voices & who are great singers to sing these classic songs & really do them justice.

The quality of the film is excellent - perfect technical production.  Like sittting in the 2nd row (& we saw this production live in the 2nd row).
The show is all on one dvd, then very interesting interviews with cast members, the conductor, & the director on a 2nd dvd.
If there were a rating higher than 5 stars, I would give it.

Sure, there are things one could argue with.  The principal one is they changed the ending simply because those connected with the production think Magnolia shouldn't take back Gaylord; the performance seemed ambiguous on that, but the interviews, especially the director, make it clear she won't, so there's no final embrace between them.  Some songs are omitted I'd have liked to have seen included, especially ""I still suits me"", but that wasn't added till the l935 film, so understandable, esp given the length as is, that it isn't in.  & a few otheer choices one could disagree with.

But no production is likely to suit every preference.  We should be grateful for what we have - a simply wonderful production, beautifully filmed.

While the filming is top notch; excellent video and sound, the staging and performance is somewhat restrained in comparison.  One reviewer did point out, and a valid point I agree, there is a difference in Opera actors and Theatre actors - partially, that could be part of the problem.  I'm perhaps also at a disadvantage having seen the last Broadway revival which was spectacular in nearly every aspect, no doubt coloring my expectations here.  This production here seemed a little reserved, sedated and understated. Sets functional, but not overly pleasing or interesting; direction rather bland, acting on the stiff side  The singing, as both an opera lover and theatre lover, missed the mark for me - I didn't connect with any character or song and that is hard to do in this epic musical.  I can't quite put my finger on it, but something was 'missing'.  I can also agree with the comments on Blu-Ray - horrible chapter/index markings, each mark/next took you NOT to the beginning of the song but to the applause which followed!?

7130295,4,B00WCCYBYK,"UPDATE to my review posted yesterday: As you will see 11 of the 12 reviews posted here are of the Bluray version (including mine). I jusr learned from someone who has the cheaper DVD version that the resume-play feature works on that format.

Now on to the review I posted yesterday.

After watching this amazing performance captured on Bluray with great sound and image, but before posting this review, I see that my fellow reviewers had the same problem and concerns that I had with the manufacture of this Bluray released by the Euroarts label. And these concerns are valid and I hope will be addressed by the folks at the San Francisco Opera Company, who mounted this landmark 21st century version of the classic 1927 musical by Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein. This is a production that anyone who loves Broadway will want to see. Yes, it's being mounted by an ""opera"" company, but many in the cast are Broadway veterans and the dance numbers are Tony Award worthy. Had this production made it's way to New York, it surely would have won multiple Tonys.

As you will learn in the bonus interviews with all the leading cast members as well as the production team (totaling about 33 minutes), there were songs from the original production that were added back (""Misery"") and new ones added. And the direction and camera work is great too! I'll let you read some other reviews of the production and comment (as others have) on the technical aspects of the BD.

Simply stated the Bluray has no memory or ""resume play"" feature. When you stop the disc you will find that it will start up the next time with the copyright notice and the main menu.  The production is 2 hours and 24 minutes ling (The first act is about 1 hour and 22 minutes), and it is divided into chapters. But you would need to know how far you watched before hitting stop button to find your place.
I found another ""memory"" issue too. There are many songs in the score sung by a chorus. They are great, but I challenge anyone to decipher the lyrics. Luckily the BD has subtitles option for English as well as other languages. And I highly recommend that anyone watching this use that option. BUT, you need to choose that option BEFORE pressing ""Play"". And, if you stop the BD and return to it, not only do you need to scan to where you left off BUT you need to choose the English subtitles AGAIN from the main menu! The BD does not remember that you wanted it.

I can only hope that someone with the power to make it happen can go back to Euroarts and request that they re-do the BD with the resume function (which can't be hard and nearly every BD that I review, has that feature.) . It would surely help them sell the BD and this IS an important production that needs to be seen!

I don't think that anyone else has mentioned that (like most Euroarts releases) there is a 28-page color booklet enclosed in the package. It provides production credits and list of the 22 chapter stops (and the songs you'll find in each- though some chapters are 8-11 minutes in length so it's still frustrating. There is a 4 page synopsis of each chapter (repeated in various languages), plus short essays by the director and musical director.

The production goes well beyond 5 stars but the frustration trying to watch it ( I did in two sessions) makes me have to deduct one star.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7130296,4,B00WCCYBYK,"""Show Boat"" was last staged on Broadway about 20 years ago, and the current thinking is that this show is just too big and expensive to dock there again. We should be grateful that San Francisco Opera decided to put it on in grand style, and what's more, in a version that restores music left out of some previous productions. And let's give extra thanks for the fact that it's been released on Blu-ray so we can enjoy it at home again and again.

Whether or not ""Show Boat"" truly launched American musical theater is often debated. What remains beyond debate, though, is that it's a seminal work and one of the greatest musicals ever written. Because of its progressive slant (for 1927) on racial issues in the U.S. -- Oscar Hammerstein's legacy -- it also resonates more with us than musicals of a more recent vintage.

It's not a perfect musical, by any means. It has structural issues and the second half is choppy. The tone is also inconsistent, with vaudeville characters like Cap'n Andy and his wife mixing somewhat uncomfortably with the more naturalistic Magnolia, Gaylord, Julie, Joe and Queenie. The director of this production makes no attempt to smooth this over, giving Gumby-limbed Bill Irwin free rein as a clownish Cap'n Andy and having the actors in the show within the show use wildly exaggerated gestures.

That said, ""Show Boat"" remains thoroughly enjoyable and has many terrific moments, lifted heavenward by Jerome Kern's gorgeous music. The performers in this production could hardly be bettered vocally -- from the thrillingly deep low notes of Morris Robinson's Joe to the exciting high notes of Heidi Stober's Magnolia. A special mention has to also be made of Angela Renee Simpson, who really puts across Queenie's lively restored number, ""Hey Feller.""

I received a review copy of this disc. The Blu-ray's picture quality is very good, although the sharpness varies a bit from scene to scene. The sound is equally good, but the volume level is on the low side in the DTS 5.1 surround-sound setting. It's louder in the PCM Stereo default, but I prefer the transparency of textures provided by the 5.1 option, so I recommend you boost your receiver's volume to compensate.

The bonus features consist of enjoyable interviews with the performers and other creative personnel. I would have preferred a documentary on ""Show Boat"" itself, but I realize that's probably too much to ask for. Lacking that, you may want to read&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Show-Boat-The-Story-of-a-Classic-American-Musical-A-Da-Capo-paperback/dp/0306804018/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Show Boat: The Story of a Classic American Musical (A Da Capo paperback)</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Show-Boat-Performing-Race-in-an-American-Musical-Broadway-Legacies/dp/0190250534/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Show Boat: Performing Race in an American Musical (Broadway Legacies)</a>.

There is a drawback to having opera companies incorporate musicals like ""Show Boat"" into their repertoire. A certain staidness becomes inevitable when you replace Broadway performers -- who have a certain type of energy on stage -- with trained opera singers. But that's OK. Each approach has its merits. By the way, in case anyone from an opera company is reading this, I think Frank Loesser's ""The Most Happy Fella"" should be next.",1437868800,,3411,5.613592233009709

I know the 1951 version from MGM is beautiful in technicolor and has good performances by Kathryn Grayson, Howard Keel and Ava Gardner, but I believe the 1936 version strikes a deeper chord in its depiction of racial injustice.",1437350400,2,521,4.886363636363637
7130301,4,B00WCCYBYK,I think Kern & Hammerstein's Show Boat should be a part of every musical collection. I feel fortunate that San Francisco Opera produced the dvd,1437350400,,143,4.76
7130302,5,B00WCCYBYK,"I was eagerly looking forward to the release of Show Boat in a Blu-Ray disk, and it was worth waiting for.  When I was a young boy in Chile, my parents took me to a live performance of Show Boat by some American company.  I was starting to learn English and they thought it will be beneficial to me. I didn't understand a word of the lyrics and am not sure I comprehended the story, but the music, and in particular Ol Man River, has stuck with me ever since.  I don't know for sure if I had any goosebumps when I heard it for the first time, but over the years it has always succeeded in having a great impression on me, and when I watched this Blu-Ray version, it happened again.
Now, living in the USA, I can enjoy all the facets of this musical, although the music is still what I value most. Lots has been written about the moral message, the portrayal of race, the love story, the addiction to gambling, and so many other messages embedded in the story of this musical.  Even with these sometimes controversial themes, the whole show can be watched again and again.  The San Francisco Opera put together a great production; everything fits together so well that not much needs to be added.  It's a great pleasure to watch and listen to.
The set is traditional and follows the original libretto, and the singers, actors and musicians are not only great, but seem to enjoy the musical themselves.  This is not only a keeper, but one you should proudly show to your friends.",1436832000,4,1477,4.388278388278389
7130303,5,B00WCCYBYK,"I am pleased to be the fourth reviewer for this great production nicely transferred to blu ray DVD.  I saw this production live at the Washington National Opera.  When the DVD was announced I immediately ordered it and received a ""day of release"" copy.  I love Showboat.  I own all of the available video material and most of the audio material.  The two sound movies, 1936 and 1951, have significant flaws in that they have modified or eliminated important sections of the original musical.  The Paper Mill Playhouse production was broadcast in 1989, but was never issued on commercial video media.  The Harold Prince Broadway production of 1994 was never broadcast nor issued on video.  Now comes this amazing production direction by Francesca Zambello and beautifully captured on blu ray.  I have not yet watched the entire DVD, but what I have watched faithfully reproduces the production that I saw live in Washington D.C.  The images are clear with great color rendition on my 53 inch Sony LCD Screen. The camera work is excellent.  The PCM sound is full and clear.  There is also a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track, but with my particular sound system opera and symphonic material tends to sound fuller via PCM.  There are subtitles in six languages.  There are extras but I have not watched them yet.  The only flaw is that the blu ray disk is not authored for ""resume play"" which means that every time there is a stop the blu ray will start over from the beginning.  This is not a problem if one can watch this 144 minute production without a break in one sitting but for those who have to watch over several days writing down where one stopped is annoying.  In any event this production will become the standard video version of Showboat.  Though both the 1951 and 1936 versions have their charms, this new production is the most definitive.",1435622400,35,1848,4.70404984423676
7130304,5,B00WCCYBYK,"This review follows receipt of a commercially available Blu-ray disc available elsewhere:

This recording of Jerome Kerns Showboat was made in 2014 and features an essentially traditional production offering attractive stage scenery coupled with plenty of on-stage energy, dancing and excellent singing by all members of the cast, both solo and choral.

The musical originally dates from the late 1920s but is more regularly known through the later 1946 revival. This production has made extensive use of research into the 1927 performance material and orchestrations and has blended the results of that research with elements of the 1946 version. To that mix has been added the orchestrations of Robert Russell Bennett. A surprise instrumental decision for some listeners will be the use of guitar and banjo as part of the vintage sound throughout.

The plot was highly controversial at the time of the first performances dealing, as it does, with issues of race and the resultant conflicts. This may make for some discomfort even today as there are clearly unresolved issues remaining. Jerome Kerns creation was therefore an act of some considerable artistic bravery and it is a tribute to his musical and dramatic credentials that it has overcome obstacles of conscience to become such a respected part of American musical culture today.

It would be invidious to single out particular members of the cast for special praise bearing in mind the uniform excellence of the captured performance. Needless to say, in those circumstances, that all the members of the cast who have specific roles, and they amount to 17 in total, are excellent both in terms of their singing and acting delivery as well as their dancing where appropriate.

The chorus is equally excellent and the score, which is technically demanding in range, and rhythmical complexity at times, is delivered with skill, accuracy and energetic enjoyment. The full range of emotion from joy and good humour to despair and loss are delivered unstintingly and the whole amounts to an impressive dramatic statement.

The actual recording is an outstanding example of the quality that can be achieved with HD definition and offers sharp and realistic visuals supported by impressive sound offered in DTS master Audio 5.1 as well as PCM stereo. There is an extensive bonus of some 33 minutes featuring interviews with the artists.

This is an excellent option for those considering purchase of a Showboat and is likely to be reference recording for some time to come.

7130305,5,B00WCCYBYK,"This is  a nearly perfect recording of one of Broadway's most loved and most revolutionary (for the times) productions. My parents (RIP) saw it on stage back in the late 1920's when it premiered, and I can remember them discussing it many years later. It is a show that openly deals with racial issues at a time when public awareness of them was, sadly, lacking. It is also, when done right, a simply splendid theatrical experience.

And, gentle reader, the SFO does it proud!

Showboat posses a marvelously melodic score, some of it romantic and some energetic, making use of emerging jazz rhythms, much as Porgy and Bess does. Dance numbers abound, well done without exception. In fact, Bill Irwin, as Captain Andy dances with a suppleness that makes it appear that he has no leg bones.

Vocal excellence abounds. Betsy Stober is a perfect Magnolia, and her lover, Gaylord Ravenal, played by Michael Simpson are just wonderful in their respective roles. Patricia Racette as Julie LaVerne is great, a lesson in ""torch song"" singing for  generation without experience in this musical form.

Staging is excellent, with a largely traditional approach. Certain offensive epithets found in original book have been appropriately modified, otherwise it is what folks would have experienced back in the late 1920's.

Disc quality is exceptional, even in our Blu ray world. Ditto the sound. It runs about 144 minutes, with an added 30 minutes or so of extra features.

I got mine from the San Francisco Opera Gift Store, because the price was about $10 cheaper than anyone else, here or abroad, and it released earlier.

This one is a hands down winner, folks! Get it for many evenings of performing excellence.",1434758400,25,1703,4.926573426573427

8712866,5,B00WCCYBYK,"The San Francisco Opera Company's production of Show Boat is fantastic. The score is lovely, written by two of the greats Kern and Hammerstein. The songs Old Man River and Life Upon the Wicked Stage continually play in my head. The cast is incredible. A strong mix of famous musical theatre actors and world-class opera singers make this show as wonderful as it is.  Bill Irwin is hilarious, as is Harriet Harris! Morris Robinson's voice in lush and velvety, Angela Renee Simpson makes a lovely Queenie and her rendition of Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man is vibrant with a voice to match. Heidi Stober is excellent as Magnolia Hawks, she plays bright eyed and bushy tailed at the beginning of the play quite well, and her nuances as her character ages are nicely done and her voice is dreamy. Kirsten Wyatt is probably one of the biggest stand outs for me. Her rendition of Life Upon the Wicked Stage is catchy and funny. She milks every moment just as any Ellie Mae Chipley should. Wyatt's and John Bolton's chemistry really shows and their characters shine because of it. The scenic design is wonderful. From the simple but adequate show boat set during the first act to the fast changing unit sets during the second act really add to the show but do not detract from the story, score and performances. A previous reviewer mentions that the acting is ""Shticky"", and I'd have to disagree. That is that reviewers opinion and I respect that but I would like to try and debunk why that claim may have been made. This production was filmed live! The actors weren't playing for the cameras but the 3,146 seats plus 200 standing patrons that were present during the show. They need to reach the back of the house. So, their character portrayals may need to be over exaggerated to reach all of the audience members. Overall this production is simply wonderful. I may even go so far as to say it's as close to a perfect production of the classic Show Boat as we're ever going to get (at least in my lifetime). The San Francisco Opera has always produced fantastic shows (specifically The Gershwin's Porgy and Bess and Heggie's Moby Dick also available on DVD from Amazon.com) and Show Boat can certainly be added to that list!",1484179200,2,2214,4.633587786259542
