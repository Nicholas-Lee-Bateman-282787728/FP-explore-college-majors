The woods in the US are very large that humans cant reach, anyten can live out there an we are discoveryn new speces of animals every year in the ocean & land then is very posible that bigfoot is real.",1282521600,,337,4.121212121212121
4181322,2,B003R9K0OM,"Remember back when VHS tapes were everywhere and the packaging looked cool, but the movie was not what you were expecting? This is what we have here. From the product description, one expects much, much more.

Disc one has 3 different features.

The first is ""Bigfooting in Oklahoma"" about a woman who has had numerous encounters (curiously though, she seems to have them wherever she moves, even in different states.) This is the best of the 3.

The second feature is ""Tale of the Honey Island Swamp Monster"" which most likely debunks (at least one claim) the monster. I was curious as to why this one was included in a DVD set of ""bigfoot proof"". I bought this as a stand alone DVD off eBay. I see now why they have disappeared as they were licensed for this set.

The 3rd is called ""Swamp Apes"" and is a good example of why skeptics feel these types of off-beat researchers are a bit looney in their theories. It's interesting in a ""throw most logic out the window"" sort of way. Jay Michael (called J Michael is feature one) was associated with all 3.

Disc two is ""The Wildman of Kentucky : The Mystery of Panther Rock"". It is a decent feature (although reaches way beyond in trying to explain anything from mystery lights, bigfoot, giant cats & werewolf like creatures.) This is a program that Reality Films sells as a stand alone disc (and quite available on this & other sites.) NO MENTION OF IT BEING INCLUDED IN THE DESCRIPTION. I can imagine one being irritated if they bought both DVDs from the site and received 2 copies of the same movie. I do own it as a stand alone (adding to my irritation.)

My biggest issue is that none of these programs are listed in any descriptions either on the cover art or on Reality Films website. I have found some of their other products (secret societies & UFOs) much better than this collection that has a sense of being slapped together. If Amazon allowed 1/2 ratings I would have rated this 2.5 stars for those who don't have any of these programs. Also in regards to the title, no mention of the ab. snowman anywhere in any of the programs.",1279152000,17,2090,4.47244094488189
4181333,2,B003R9K0OM,"I wasn't pleased with this product.  In my honest opinion, it should be included with another purchase at a deep discount or a freebie.",1357689600,,135,4.625
4181334,1,B003R9K0OM,"This two disc package is really misleading. First of all, there is nothing about the abominable snowmen or yetis, other than brief mentionings. The production was very cheaply done. Armed with hand held videocams and interviews of no more than 3 to 4 people, this documentary really does not own up to its hype. There is alot of computerized animation and the stereotypical native American lores tied in, but no Indians. No scientist, cryptozoologists or experts, just backwoods interviews that in one case, debunks and concentrates on a hoax rather than facts. No significant footage, photos or evidence convincing the viewer that these events are real. In one clip of a group of bigfoot seekers, the investigation goes from looking for a bigfoot to getting haunted by ghost and orbs in the woods. What happened to bigfoot here? At that, the group is filmed in awe and spooked response to lights and movement, but the camera focuses on the mens faces rather than chasing down what they are seeing. This is a complete waste of money and time to watch when you could easily just sit around a campfire and tell ghost stories instead. Buyer beware, this is a cheaply done, hokey redneck interviewed sitting in the woods using sophisticated words that show no real concrete video, photos or evidence, just talking and self terrored dullness. Everything could have been confined into one hour and been a solid bigfoot documentary, instead, you get four hours of, ""be quiet, listen, whats that over there and when I was 6 years old"" crap!",1338854400,,1532,4.873563218390805
4181335,4,B003R9K0OM,"Since I was a child I have always been curious about the existence of Bigfoot. After watching this DVD, I feel like my questions have been answered. I believe he really exists and want to learn more.  You will not be disappointed in this film.",1307059200,,243,4.4
4181336,3,B003R9K0OM,"These videos were interesting to watch, as they featured real people with real experiences.  There are multiple videos.

However, I was not impressed by their advertisements for other videos, some of which teeter on occult things, that I don't think people should be getting into.  It really irritated me.  I am seeking the truth/wisdom of God's creation.

I also was not impressed by their repeated use of the same video graphics over and over again, sometimes with annoying music.  This video appears to be of the ""homemade"" variety, rather than the quality production used by shows on The History Channel, such as ""Monster Quest"".

I did get a good price on it, which motivated me to purchase this set of discs.  I got for less than $10.",1296864000,,740,4.771653543307087
4181337,3,B003R9K0OM,"Not the best video for those who want to watch or learn about the creature. At least it wasn't made by those who clutter YouTube dot com with some useless bigfoot jokes. Made me understand why the science community would not persue looking for this creature. The creature being nocturnal sounds kind of scary. My guess is that scientists are just plain scared of the dark, and their own shadows. Imagine them seeing their own shadows in the moonlight. Takes a few brave researchers to do the job of looking for the creatures.",1295481600,,525,4.655913978494624
4181338,3,B003R9K0OM,Firsthand accounts from a diverse array of people about their experience stalking and sighting the beast that goes by so many names and insights such controversy. Lots to see and listen to here for Sasquatch enthusiasts!,1288483200,,220,5.138888888888889
4181339,3,B003R9K0OM,"I have often considered Bigfoot to be nothing more than a headline used to sell those black and white printed tabloids at the supermarket checkout stand. That is pretty much how I approached this documentary. I expected nothing more than fictional entertainment. The accounts and interviews added to the entertainment value of the film, although they weren't very convincing. Unfortunately, in today's world of modern technology when just about anything can be caught on film, I would expect Bigfoot to have surfaced on someone's family vacation photos. This film is great for conspiracy theorists or anyone remotely curious about Bigfoot. There is a lot to learn about the mythical figure that you might not otherwise have heard - like the atrocious odor of the beast. Overall you will have to be your own judge of who or what you want to believe.",1286409600,,848,4.97887323943662
4181340,3,B003R9K0OM,"There have always been myths of monsters, the half-glimpsed creatures. Many consider these to be little more than childrens' tales, meant to frighten (and, of course, entertain).

And it is with this philosophy that viewers must approach ""Bigfoot Is Real"", a collection of small documentaries that offer fascinating--but ultimately familiar--explanations of the world's most famed monster.

With a staggering 250 minutes of material, ""Bigfoot Is Real"" explores the possibilities of such a creature existing within today's society. Through interviews, exploration of supposed evidence and even the quick dismissal of pranksters and their attempts to ruin all investigations, the film offers four stories to consider: ""Bigfooting in Oklahoma"", ""Tale of the Honey Island Swamp Monster"", ""Swamp Apes"" and ""The Wildman of Kentucky: The Mystery of Panther Rock"". Each of these provides interesting personal accounts and reenactments.

Ultimately, though, they offer nothing that can be considered validation. These are theories, however clever, and should therefore simply be enjoyed. The film is meant to engage audiences (rather than force them to redefine their beliefs) and will be an excellent companion to an afternoon.",1285718400,,1219,5.761111111111111
4181341,4,B003R9K0OM,"I've been intrigued by Big Foot and his ""kin"" ever since I was a kid and watched In Search Of with Leonard Nimoy.  This 2 disc set covers anything and everything the Big Foot lover could want.  My review started getting too long, so I focused on three of the episodes:

Bigfooting in Oklahoma

A woman named Esther is interviewed and she relays her stories of being ""visited"" by Big Foot from the age of 3 and up.  At first she was scared to death, but over the years she became intrigued and even determined to prove that this creature is real.  She takes out on the road to capture videos of others who have witnessed this creature and hopes to get a glimpse of the apelike animal on film. Bigfooting in Oklahoma is chock full of eyewitnesses and their stories.

Tales of the Honey Island swamp monster

Jay Michael relays the story of the Honey Island monster, a swamp-living beast and how he and Marlon Davis created the documentary.  As they set out to film it they discovered that it was all a hoax Harlan Ford created.  Claw-type feet were made and attached to a pair of shoes.  The person then walked around the swamp to create these footprints.  Were they disappointed?  Perhaps, though they were also intrigued how someone could get away with this hoax for so many years. They feel they learned a lesson to not believe everything you hear.  However, Jay still feels that there may be a Honey Island Swamp Monster, it's just that the ""proof"" was a hoax.

Swamp Apes

Did Bigfoot follow man across the Bering Strait?  The film talks about the Phoenicians and the fact that they sailed and explored...and could have brought primates to America.  Some of the primates may have started eating meat, walking upright, and becoming smarter within just a few generations.  The documentary covers every question you could possibly ask about these big apes.  Why don't we see them?  Where could they have come from?  And more.

The second disc, The Wildman of Kentucky is good too.",1284940800,6,1980,4.610315186246418
4181342,3,B003R9K0OM,"The title is clear what this is about, but you're going to be surprised at the contents.  The first section chronicles an Oklahoma woman's encounters with Bigfoot as a child and teen.  She's since researched other encounters, and the video eyewitness accounts she's recorded are simply amazing.

But it's the next section that blew me away.  It's about the ""Honey Island Swamp Monster,"" who lives in a swamp north of New Orleans, according to the legend.  This a remarkable story with some remarkable footage and not at all what you'd expect from this DVD.  This section alone is worth the price of admission.

The third section is a thorough speculation on the possibility of primates (besides Man) in North America.  It does a good job arguing for the possibility, but isn't all that convincing as to the fact.  As much as I'd love to believe this stuff, the evidence is still pretty thin.

The second DVD I'd seen before--you can check out my review under Wildman of Kentucky.  I gave it three stars, too, and said it was ""fun to watch, maybe not so scientific.""",1284249600,4,1065,4.702702702702703

8403415,5,B003R9K0OM,I think it's pretty obvious that something or someone is 'out there'. There is just too much overwhelming evidence to think differently.
