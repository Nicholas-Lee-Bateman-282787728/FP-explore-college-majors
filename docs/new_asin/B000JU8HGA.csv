2679504,2,B000JU8HGA,"Myrna Loy plays Becky Sharp in this first talkie version of `Vanity Fair' made in 1932. I don't know anything about its company Allied Pictures, one of the numerous obscure studios seen in the early days of in Hollywood, but obviously the adaptation was not made as social satire as William Makepeace Thackeray's source material. The film is a modernized version of this classic Victorian novel, of which long story about social climber Becky Sharp is heavily condensed to make a 74-minute melodrama.

Myrna Loy, who is later to be known as Nora Charles in ""The Thin Man"" two years after this film, is acceptable as Becky Sharp, unabashed adventuress who uses her beauty to allure the eligible bachelors around her who have money. Loy's Becky is, however, less cunning and shameless than the original book's, and the changed ending (in which primitive special makes-up is used) tries to show the inner, corrupt side of her nature, which is a bit too somber and downbeat.

Surely the filmmakers knew Myrna Loy was the greatest merit of the low-budget film, and it seems they were using her as much as they could. Look how Becky is often seen in her room wearing nightdress. Interestingly Myrna Loy's Becky is so tall that the contrast with Barbara Kent' Amelia is often conspicuous. Even some of the male leads are barely taller than her, but I am not sure this is intentional or not.

Unlike the recent adaptation starring Reese Witherspoon, you don't hear the sound of war, and consequently in this modern-day adaptation one of the characters (who gets killed in the original book) dies in a different way, which is abrupt and jaw-dropping. No episode about her throwing away Samuel Johnson dictionary, and that's OK, but the film could have been more entertaining with the defter handling of some more episodes like Sir Pitt Crawley and his marriage proposal.

Anyway you know this is no Victorian novel; this is a quickly made talkie in the early Hollywood. There are a few nice camera works, but the film is all in all a mediocre melodrama.

(My DVD is from Alpha Video, and the sound and visual quality is not clear and crisp probably due to the damages of the master tape. Sometimes you will notice several frames of film missing.)",1169596800,15,2237,4.7700258397932815

8153282,5,B000JU8HGA,I love Vanity Fair and purchased all movies related to it. This version was hard to watch as it was very scratchy with bad sound due to the old silent movie that has not been edited. It was interesting however to see Myrna Low in such an early film. She sure improved with Hollywood help after this film. The seller was very good and sent this quickly just as added. Thank you!,1404086400,,377,4.25
8153283,1,B000JU8HGA,The copy of the film is a very bad version.  It is a bad cut.  And even with Myrna it is boring.,1355356800,,96,3.3181818181818183
8153284,3,B000JU8HGA,"Nyrna Loy is quite beautiful here as Becky Sharp, the seductress who comes to a bad end.  She is really the only good reason to sit through this very dark print with muffled sound.  (I could hardly tell one man from another.)

I haven't read the novel and I'm wondering if the film missed something essential that would have made more sense to the story.  We see Becky's demise and then, it's ""Finis.""

Fans of early films and those of Myrna Loy may enjoy this.",1283904000,3,461,4.376470588235295
8153285,4,B000JU8HGA,"This movie is true to the book, minus their children. Myrna Loy is convincing as the conniving Becky Sharp; I also enjoyed the other actors' performances. The ending is memorable, and certainly teaches the audience a lesson!",1276473600,,224,5.081081081081081
8153286,1,B000JU8HGA,The image and sound quality for this movie was very poor.  It made it hard to view.,1230595200,,83,3.8823529411764706
8153287,3,B000JU8HGA,"You get what you pay for with public domain films that have not been re-mastered for quality. I recommend this DVD if you are wanting to see the early Myrna Loy or love the story of Vanity Fair, but do not expect great quality. The sound is muffled and whiny and the video is somewhat degraded. This is not a thrilling movie, but I am glad I've seen it and do not regret my purchase.",1193875200,9,383,4.12
8153288,1,B000JU8HGA,"I was so excited upon purchasing this DVD...It was my first Myrna Loy movie and I was thrilled...until I put the DVD in.

I couldn't bare to watch it for a full five minutes because of the poor quality of film and muffed up sound.  I can only hope that polishing this movie up is in the future...it is a classic.

Until then, sadly, it sits in my DVD collection...unseen.",1179273600,11,371,4.271428571428571
