2424076,5,B000BMSUK4,"I am normally not a fan of comedy partly because the humor I see doesn't have a lot of substance, but is funny to other people, or I just don't get it.  With Behrendt, I was feeling his slapstick performance all throughout from the beginning on this.  The only thing different that could've occurred is that he could've lessened his length on repeating a portion of his mockery of drawing through pantomime.  Pantomime is pretty much just meant for comedy and not movies most of the time, and this is definitely no exception!  He makes fun of all angles of media I can think of, the fans, how media advertises some things, and then pays tribute to the average american worker that usually doesn't get as much credit as they deserve.  He plays on take on game night that only any true gamer can understand whether it's D&D or social or other nerdy games like Pictionary or Scrabble.  He's about as popular as he wants to be right now.  He doesn't have the mainstream yet, which is fine with him.  This gives him more time to put out future material, so we can count on it being just as superb!  I think this factor will allow him to continue pouring out great material that will be underappreciated.  This DVD is a great introduction for me to a piece of monumental Behrendt comedy.

2424077,5,B000BMSUK4,"How funny is this DVD? I want to share how my boyfriend and I became aquainted with Greg. Late one night, i flipped on the TV, and there he was. Uncool, as we watched, I had to close my eye's, because the pain in my stomach and tears running my mascara, caused me to loose all self control. The two things  causing this contraction, one being  Greg but i look over at my boyfriend, who has not only lost control, but began the ""no sound laugh"". I was laughing not only at greg but at my boyfriends reponse. then it came to me...i looked at dave my boyfriend then at greg as he paced the stage, the hair, the belt, the Chain Wallet and ""The Creepy old guy"" bit and , and oh my god it hit me, like a big red brick to the melon, everything this man eminated, my thoughts confirmed, Greg and my boy friend were lost twins. Dear god i thought, wasn't one enough? Apparently now, there's two of them..

Armed with honesty, we related to every bit, and it also confirmed what i already knew, ""Your never to old to rock"" ( I'm the 41 yr old creepy old girl, who still shops in the juniors section) I have to say my favorite bit was, and as he discribes his faults , ""anal and forgetful"".

After watching this man, Greg, I spent my ""free Sunday"" in search of this video..it was even funnier the second time around...Greg puts life in terms that truly defi the 40 something generation.."" Rock hard Forever""!!!!!! Add it to your collection, you won't regret it.",1143417600,,1450,4.261818181818182
2424078,5,B000BMSUK4,"This is a great stand-up special.  The act doesn't begin as well as some of his past specials, but it picks up quickly and becomes just as good, if not better.

The ""creepy old guy"" bit brings the special to life and right back to the usual hilarity I expect from Greg Behrendt.  The air guitar and bass are great and the material about getting older and still rocking really ring true for a lot of people.  He then moves into the Halloween bit.  Now, I've seen him do this one a few times before, yet he infuses new delivery into it, which made it fresh - and I laughed just as hard as the first time I saw it.  He even closes the show out by rocking to a ""children's tune"".  Hilarious.

There are a few extras on the DVD, including discussion about what is ""cool"" and a short documentary/mockumentary about Greg's nonexistent past in rocking (or NOT rocking).  This adds a little something to the DVD for added value and the extras are just as funny as the special itself.

Highly recommended.",1139443200,11,995,4.358695652173913
2424079,4,B000BMSUK4,"On the (now unavailable) original 'Uncool' CD, Greg's like (a better) Dane Cook for reluctant grown ups.  He's found a sweet spot at the cross-roads of rock fandom and middle age, and he nails it with vigor, observational smarts and a delivery that's as relentless as rock itself.

I was looking forward to watching this, but knock off a star because it feels a little too rehearsed.  It's inching closer to one-man-show masquerading as stand-up - a Vagina Monologues for the middle-aged air guitarist (which would probably elevate it above stand up if it didn't feel so slick).  The side of Greg that's relationship counsellor to Cosmo readers & Oprah fans is obvious on occasion, and not just when he acnowledges the letters he gets from the readers of his books.

Most of his great bits are in place - like the sudden shift that takes place when you become the guy giving out the Halloween candy.  But by the time he's doing stuff about couples playing Pictionary, it starts to feel like 1990's ""relationship comedy"" repackaged for his air-guitaring audience. ""Hey guys, have you ever noticed when your girlfriend/wife...""

Behrendt has a distinct enough worldview and premise to make some of the ""relationship"" stuff work, but he's on funnier ground when he's mining the ""weird old guy at rock shows"" aspects of Uncool.  Pity he's withdrawn the original CD version, where hew sounded that little bit edgier.  But not being as edgy as you used to be is, of course, all part of becoming Uncool.  The fans, needless to say,  want the old s***, the hits, and to be home in time for Lost.  Despite my complaints, I'm a fan.",1134172800,4,1622,4.733096085409253
2424080,5,B000BMSUK4,"Greg is the next up and coming comedian, he makes Dane Cook and Mitch Hedberg look like Carrot Top.  If you don't already know about Greg, consider yourself out of the loop.",1131321600,,173,4.40625
2424081,5,B000BMSUK4,"i've seen greg behrendt about 3 times now (i was at the taping for this dvd), and he's my new favorite comic....seriously, you won't disappointed.  don't get his stand-up mixed up with the oprah stuff...it's on a whole different level.  not only is he funny and smart, he knows his music (really) and its hard not to like the guy when you watch him on stage.

if you are at all a fan of comedy, buy this dvd. do it.",1131321600,,415,4.1625
2424082,5,B000BMSUK4,"I was at this live taping and this guy is hilarious.  It was a lucky coincidence he was performing that day =)

I'm going to buy this DVD for sure~",1130112000,,147,3.8666666666666667
8089023,5,B000BMSUK4,One of my favorite comedians! I can hear this over and over and still break out into laughter.,1442275200,,94,4.277777777777778

8089025,5,B000BMSUK4,great for anyone else who loves greg behrendt. very entertaining.  i would love to see him back on tv again.,1364688000,,108,4.4
8089026,3,B000BMSUK4,"I'll admit I am a ""hard sell"" when it comes to comedy; I'm just not easily amused. I bought this because I loved Greg's books and I had never seen his stand-up act. The language didn't bother me, I'm an adult and have heard it all before. Parts of this were funny, but in a chuckle sort of way, not a laugh-out-loud way. I would give this a B-.",1333324800,,344,4.0
8089027,5,B000BMSUK4,"Greg Behrendt has always been a favorite of mine.  He's a guy who can be funny without the gimmicky attempts at ""being a funny guy"".  He makes me laugh because he's that guy that sees his flaws and simply accepts them.  He's veering toward middle age, while his interests are better suited for a young man, and he's just going with it.  He's going to age gracefully, but not pliantly.  I can relate!

The DVD is classic Behrendt, and I know a few reviewers have found it to be over-rehearsed, but you overlook that when he gets rolling.  I'm a fan.",1306022400,,548,4.366336633663367
8089028,5,B000BMSUK4,"This is hilarious throughout.
The challenges of a ""cool Dude"" hitting his 40s are insightful and just downright funny.",1275436800,,118,5.2631578947368425
8089029,4,B000BMSUK4,"This stand up made me laugh alot, and I could really relate to him.  You are never to old to rock.",1232323200,,98,3.6666666666666665

We would recommend this to anyone that wants to laugh.",1224979200,,122,4.3478260869565215
8089031,1,B000BMSUK4,"I was a fan of Greg Behrendt TV show and was disappointed when it was removed from the air.  I bought this DVD based on my experience from the show, but was disappointed with his comedy.  It is sorta vulgar comedy with Greg saying the F... word many times in his dialog.  I just don't appreciate this type of comedy and don't find it very funny.  Sorry, Greg.  I hope he gets a show back on television.",1194307200,,402,4.1688311688311686
8089032,4,B000BMSUK4,"I had tears streaming down my face while watching this.  The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is due to the language.  I don't mind swearing, but he's a little over-the-top.  Don't let your small children watch, but my teenagers watched with me and loved it.  His ""adult rock show"" idea is brilliant and extremely amusing.",1178928000,,338,4.583333333333333
