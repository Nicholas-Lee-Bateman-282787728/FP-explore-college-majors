8459799,4,B0056NUN94,"I knew this could not be Disney, based on the price.  However, I wanted to get the stories for my niece. I gave it to her for her birthday; she was pleased with it, and then I spoke with her after she had watched some of them; she liked them.  I also spoke with her mother, to see what she thought, and she said they were entertaining, and kept the little one occupied while watching.  In my book, that's good!",1321660800,,410,4.1
8459800,1,B0056NUN94,"Worst DVD set ever!  Yes... its all of the classic stories that you loved as a child but... not what you think.  Cinderella has black hair for example!  I should have looked into this set more thoroughly.  Worst animation ever and not the Disney classics that it was leading you to Believe.  I thought that It might still entertain my 3 year old so I decided to keep them, but they are so bad she won't even watch them.  (I don't blame her.  Worst 45 min video ever!)  Also, they come in 4 DVD cases and the actual DVD is stored in a paper sleeve placed loose inside the case instead of the traditional DVD snap in case.  I feel like the seller gave a false representation of what the actual product was.  I never take the time to write reviews, but I was so disappointed in this purchase I just had to warn everyone else.",1315180800,10,822,4.211538461538462
