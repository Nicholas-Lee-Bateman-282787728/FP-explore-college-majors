8663476,5,B00L2YXU5U,"Solid romantic comedy movie from South Africa regarding that finding one's soulmate may not be in the most obvious of places and can initiate from the most whimsical of thins like a dare/wager. The dialogue has Afrikaans (Boer), I think, Zulu, again I think, and the lingua franca of English in it, but it's subtitled; this is actually quite a good plot device to help show cultural contrast. The lead actor and actress play they parts genuinely and have you believe they are a true match. A lot of the comedy (and near tragedy) stems from the cultural hangups by in-laws on both sides as these are overcome to allow the couple's destiny to come to fruition. The movie has some great non-visual atmospherics, one example is a Zulu matron's reaction at seeing Dinky's proposed dowry being driven through the township, another time is the reaction of the Boer's at the older brother's wedding to the Zulu date. Highly recommended romantic comedy with some serious lessons buried within it if one is open minded. On a last note, the ""panel art"" cars are really nifty.",1476662400,,1064,4.756756756756757

8663480,5,B00L2YXU5U,"Saw Fanie at the Sedona Film Festival a few years ago and have been trying since then to buy the film.  I was excited to see you had it for sale.  It is one of the happiest films I have ever seen all the while exploring a very serious problem, race relations in South Africa.  Thank you.",1413158400,,287,4.0
