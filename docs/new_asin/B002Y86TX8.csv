I had planned to only watch one episode a night, but ended up finishing it in 4 days. It is a little clich and predictable by today's standards, but that in no way affected my enjoyment of the series. I actually found myself caring about what happened with a few of the characters. My gf and I did have a completely different view on the character Shin Dong-Hyuk, but I think that is more due to cultural differences between us. It did make fore interesting conversation though. There were a few very minor typos with the subtitles, but you can understand what they mean, right word, wrong version. Also it does need to be noted that the Special Features does not have English Subtitles. Please do not let such a minor thing dissuade you from enjoying this great show. My only complaint is that the show did not run for more episodes.",1397174400,,993,4.344086021505376
