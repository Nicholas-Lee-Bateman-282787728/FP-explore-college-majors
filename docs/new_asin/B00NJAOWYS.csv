6666033,5,B00NJAOWYS,"I love Pierre Lacotte's revivals of the 19th century French ballets! If we trust Lacotte's scholarship in researching the history of these ballets(I do) and his immense choreographic talent, we get an amazing glimpse into the past of ballet(perhaps the type of ballets Marius Petipa and his father used to dance in themselves!). But Lacotte is the first to admit that today's staging involves many modern improvements, such as lighting, scenery, costumes, casting, and the uniform excellence of the dancers(both in technique and physical condition) and musicians(again, both in technique and the condition of their equipment). So, we see these revivals with modern eyes, and that makes it all the better.
Lacotte revived this ballet in the 1980's and it was performed with Nureyev and Lacotte's wife, Ghislaine Thesmar. It was also put on DVD and is available through Amazon.com.(I wish her La Sylphide would come out on DVD!) This new DVD has a great special feature showing some of Nureyev's performance of Marco Spada and also reahearsals with Hallberg and Obraztsova. Lacotte also explains all about the ballet.
The dancing is absolutely magnificent here! It is virtually non-stop bravura solos, pas de deux, and divertissement, as well as mime and a very clear presentation of the story through the action. The staging, costumes, and music are equally great. This is a stunning ballet!
The music was composed by Auber, who was one of the great French composers of operas and some of his operas had dance scenes. The music for those scenes as well as music Auber, himself, adapted for ballet is what we hear used in some ballets with music attributed to him. Marco Spada's music was adopted by Auber himself, but other famous ballets, like the ""Grand Pas Classique"" uses Auber's music adopted by others( Victor Gsovsky in the case of Grand Pas Classique). Auber's music is exciting and lyrical, perfect for ballets.
This is a must-have DVD!",1417305600,10,1944,5.059190031152648
6666034,5,B00NJAOWYS,"Sumptuous production with impeccable dancing. Beside amazing Hallberg, the greatest joy of this DVD is that it finally provides a professionally-filmed record of the magnificent ballerina Evgenia Obraztsova in a leading full-length role. She had to move to the Bolshoi to have this honor, after languishing for 10 years under idiotic directors at the Mariinsky of St. Petersburg who did not appreciate her angelic pure classicism and never gave her opportunities for filmed and telecast performances. Justice for Obraztsova in Moscow! May this be the start of several Obraztsova DVDs, please.",1417046400,5,592,5.516483516483516
6666035,5,B00NJAOWYS,So excited to purchase this. Saw the live stream in theaters and it is one of my favorite ballets!!,1416441600,,99,4.2631578947368425
6666036,5,B00NJAOWYS,"As previous reviewer I have watched the live broadcasting and soooooo happy to find this blue-ray release at Amazon!  It's a beautiful production. Hallberg is so charming and brilliant as the cunning bandit Marco Spada.  He shines all through with perfect dancing techniques and acting skills- YES he acts so well that I am completely drawn to him. Renowned ballerina Obraztsova dances well as his daughter Angela.  (Well, the only thing I would complain is that Hallberg is too young and handsome to convince me as a grown-up's father.)  Rising star Smirnova is so elegant and beautiful as Governor's daughter.  And I love the stage setting and corps de ballet. It's a lovely ballet but too bad it has a rather sad ending.  Anyhow I enjoy it very much!",1415232000,12,753,4.7984496124031
6666037,5,B00NJAOWYS,"Saw the live stream in movie  theatre.  So glad Bolshoi is also releasing the Blu-ray.  I've just placed the order!!!!
Great dancing. David Hallberg is amazing in this production!!!!!!!",1413417600,5,185,5.310344827586207
6666038,5,B00NJAOWYS,"This ballet provides an opportunity for a superb dancer, which David Hallberg is, to express a character who alternates between a good and an evil persona. In many ways this is similar to the usual practice of having a single ballerina dancing the roles of both Odette (the white swan) and Odille (the black swan) in the ballet Swan Lake. In both ballets the dancer has to portray their two personas differently, so that the audience can tell from the style of their movements whether at any instant they are Dr. Jekyll or Mr. Hyde (so to speak). Without words, using only their body, it's quite a challenge for a dancer to pull this off convincingly. I felt that David Hallberg, the first American to be a principal dancer with the Bolshoi Ballet (and also simultaneously with American Ballet Theatre) did so in this Bolshoi production.",1430006400,3,837,4.739726027397261
6666039,5,B00NJAOWYS,"""Marco Spada"" is akin to a Tolstoy novel; you need a score card to keep all the characters straight. After a third run through of this blu-ray disc I gave up and simply watched whomever was dancing  and each was totally enjoyable, to heck with the plot. This is a great disc.
This is a ballet of 1857 and is being revived for one reason only and that is David Hallberg. He is the tall, handsome extremely talented 32 y/o dancer from Rapid City S.D. He is distinguished by being the only American ever invited to be a principal at the Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow.(and he remains on the roster of American Ballet Theater) He is joined here by some other great stars of the Bolshoi company.
David Hallberg - Marco Spada
Eugenia Obaztsova - Angela, his daughter (an then not his daughter)
Olga Smirnova - Marchesa Sampietri, daughter of the Governor of Rome
Semyon Chudin - Prince Federici, betrothed to Marchesa, in love with Angela
Igor Tsvirko - Count Pepinelli - Captain of the Dragoons, in love with the Marchese production.
All of these are top rate dancers and good actors that make this a wonderful experience.
The ballet itself was cobbled together by composer Daniel-Francois-Esprit Aubert and librettist Eugene Scribe, The two had collaborated on dozens of Opera Comique operas in the mid 1800's now mostly forgotten. A ballet was needed at that theater so they assembled a clutter of music and plots and put together Marco Spada in 1852 under direction of Joseph Mazilier. It was a hit but soon forgotten. Much later it was revived by great choreographer  Pierre Lacotte in 1986 for Rudolph Nureyev . He danced this piece with Lacotte's wife Ghislain Thesmar. (there is a vidio clip of Nureyev included on this disc).
On this disc Pierre Lacotte is the choreographer, set designer and costume designer. He deserves due credit for the success and the beauty of this production.  (an example is the veil-cloud sequence as illustrated on the back of the disc)
 Hallbergs Marco Spada is incredible. It is impossibly difficult. He's doing double pirouettes all over the stage, a couple of temps leve's, many arabesques and jetes and grand jetes and beautifully executed  temps developpe'. In the current vernacular - It's awesome!
Ms. Obraztsova as his daughter (and then not) is petite, demure, beautiful and an extremely good dancer. This goes for the rest of the cast as well.
This is truly a dance extravaganza and a highly recommended disc.
I will not try to explain the plot. It is too improbable but this is a comic ballet that ends in the death of the nobleman Marco Spada who is a part time bandit for something to do.. After being shot he remains alive long enough to tell all that his daughter Angela is not his daughter so that she can marry Prince Federici, then Count Pepineli can marry the Marchesa Sampietri and......

When combined with the beautiful dances and the wonderful performances, the overall effect is enthralling and very enjoyable.  We have watched this performance many, many times, and we seem never to tire of it, or fail to be pleased.  Each of the five major dancers is excellent and brings unique strengths and beauty to his or her performance.  The filming and sound quality are fine and the sets and costunes are beautiful and pleasing.  Overall, the Bolshoi and Pierre Lacotte have put on a great performance, with a wonderful group of stars, and it is great to have such easy access to it all.  From personal perspectives, we were most pleased with the performances of Semydon Chudin (Prince Federici) and Olga Smirnova (the Marchesa).  They are a delight to watch.

6666047,4,B00NJAOWYS,"What can one say about a mediocre ballet with great dancers performing?
David Hallberg is splendid as the Bandit, reaching new heights thanks
to his experience of the Bolshoi. Olga Smirnova seems as brilliant as she's reputed
to be (we have to wait until June to see her in America).  The other principals
are very fine.  The story is ridiculous, and the choreography completely lacking
in genuine feeling.  How can a great ballet company produce such nonsense?",1417651200,3,461,4.961038961038961

8678666,5,B00NJAOWYS,"Pierre Lacotte is well known as a reconstructor of  19s century ballets. He staged Marco Spada first time in Italy with Nuriev who at the time was alive and well. I will focus only on the main points related to the production of this ballet at the Bolshoi. I am not a big fan of Lacottes choreography in general, and do consider the latest trend at the Bolshoi of very flashy productions of questionable taste. Despite of that, unlike many other ballet recordings I have, I am sure I will watch this disc again, and gain. The ballet is interesting, very engaging, and totally succeeds despite of a rather mediocre score. David Hallberg demonstrates very fine technique as Marco Spada, the bandit, and ability to stay in a character. Next to him you can see two sensations of the Bolshoi   magnetic superstar Evgenia Obraztsova (formerly of Mariinsky Ballet), and amazing Igor Tsvirko. Russian ballet school traditionally rather neglects the acting aspect of a production. Considering this, I was pleasantly surprised that Hollberg, Obraztsova, and Tsvirko proved themselves as a very gifted actors, and not just a ballet virtuosos. This is definitely one of the finest productions at the Bolshoi. The videography is very good, but I reduced a contrast of my TV for the picture to look more natural.",1451433600,,1298,4.917808219178082
8678667,5,B00NJAOWYS,"For many opera and ballet lovers, Daniel Francois Esprit Auber is not the first name to come to mind, yet he was a prolific and successful composer of more than 40 operas and was the Paris Conservatory Director, from 1851 until his death in 1871. Even for today standards he lived a long life, 89 years. Born in 1782, he was contemporary of an overwhelming amount of the finest composers that ever lived, many of whom, have him in high esteem. Together with Boildieu, Adam and Herold, he was part of the generation of great composer of opera  comique and contributed with Rossini and Meyerbeer to the creation of French grand opera. Despite those facts, much of his work have felt into oblivion, with just a few of his work performed nowadays.
This ballet was written in 1857 based on an opera comique with the same  name, that Auber composed in 1852, on a text by Eugene Scribe, who collaborated with him in at least twenty operas. Some find the story plain silly, a pickpocketer with a double life among nobility. The lack of interest of this text, may rush us to forget, that Scribe is the original writer  of Le philtre, the play that Felice Romani adapted to write Donizetti opera buffa par excelence, L elisir damore.
We, hard core opera and ballet lovers know that both genres are the kingdom were the impossible is the reality and would rather die or kill before admitting, but just sometimes among us, within the fraternity, never to the uninitiated,  that opera and ballet are based on childish or far-fetched stories. After all who cares, we love them both for the sheer of glorious singing and mesmerizing dancing.
Pierre Lacotte did the revival of this ballet in 1981, for Nureyed in the title role.  But Lacotte is an ace of the trade, he designed these gorgeous costumes and also the elegant scenography, voila!!
 I would rate this ballet 6 starts because despite the text, is full of beautiful music and a lot of bravura dancing. It the first time I see the fascinating Eugenia Obraztsova, she dances the role of Angela, Marco Spadas daughter. She never lost a beat and her razor sharp dancing full of stamina, together with her sweet smile, is a dream.
 Olga Smirnova as Marchesa Sampietri  pass de deux are spectacular.
Semyon Chudin and Igor Tsvirko are fantastic in their roll of Prince Federici and Count Pepinelli.
Finally David Hallberg iswell David Hallberg, he had a lot of fun and Russians love him.
