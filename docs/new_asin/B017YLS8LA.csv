Although I enjoyed the orchestra, it was disappointing that Mutter only appeared a few times in the entire program. Equally disappointing is that for the first time ever, I didn't particularly enjoy her performance.",1526342400,,315,5.448979591836735

This disc celebrating New Years Eve 2015 at the Philharmonie with the Berlin Philharmonic under Simon Rattle has every right to be considered as one of the great successes of the series. This is the result of a fortuitous combination of important key factors such as interesting concert program likely to have wide appeal, outstanding musical contributions by all participants and a superb technical achievement by the recording staff.

The recording quality is a fine example of the technical achievement that is now becoming very familiar to purchasers of current Blu-rays being crisply defined but not over-sharp, providing believable colour rendition coupled to sound which is wide-ranging with excellent depth and linked to involving camera work of detailed awareness and sensitivity. To sound at its best it responds well to a slight increase of playback level (about 2 dB).

The program blends the familiar with the less familiar but all within the remit of suitable fare for such a celebratory end of year occasion. Thus we hear an unusual overture by Chabrier instead of the more familiar Espana but exhibiting the same engaging compositional characteristics. The concert ends with the very familiar 1st Hungarian Dance by Brahms as the inevitable encore but played with real fizz.

Poulencs catchy suite from Les Biches and Massenets skilled pieces from Le Cid are both examples of popular fare from earlier times but now far less familiar to modern audiences. These will be welcomed by those remembering past times as well as those for whom this is new territory and all played with evident relish.

Ravels La Valse fulfilled the program need for a balancing example of more demanding aesthetic orchestral repertoire. Rattles emphasis upon the darker elements of the piece illustrating the collapse of the related social fabric rather than playing the piece purely as a virtuoso showpiece for orchestra was surely correct. In so doing, of course, he did exactly that as the orchestra responded impressively and corporately to the virtuoso challenge.

Anne-Sophie Mutter was the soloist for the evening and delivered readings of the Saint Saens Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso and Ravels Tzigane which are as impressive as they are intriguing and present very individual and compelling conceptions.  Both were played with an extreme and wide-ranging emotional awareness. This means that there is enormous variation in tempi from slow to fast, with enormous variation in dynamic from sotto voce whispers to full-blooded fortissimos.

The Saint Saens therefore becomes less of a virtuoso showpiece for soloist with the emphasis upon Capriccioso and more of a serious virtuoso tour de force of considerable musical complexity. That is finally revealed to be almost nothing compared to a performance of Ravels unusual Tzigane, the like of which can only be described as a major artistic statement. This wildly (yes!) free-ranging concept also made the most extreme demands upon the conducting skills of Simon Rattle and the orchestra, both corporately and individually. The need for unswerving close attention was clearly apparent and was delivered with a result that was utterly compelling as evidenced by the numerous curtain calls that followed. This could be a defining mature career moment for which the soloist will be long-remembered and which really has to be seen to be believed  truly beyond adequate description!

In conclusion therefore, this disc offers something for everyone and is a tremendously successful concert.",1456617600,10,3680,5.3293103448275865
