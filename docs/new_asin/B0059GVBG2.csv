8462974,4,B0059GVBG2,"This DVD has two of the classic William S. Hart feature films, and both have print issues.  Considering they are over 90 years old, however, that is expected and excusable.  What I don't understand, though, is the blackouts, each lasting eight or ten seconds.  It is not a problem with the DVD, as the music continues without a pause, but I found it distracting.  The music on 'The Narrow Trail' is period, and authentically thrilling, and at least some effort has been made to fit it to the action of the film, although not really all that close.  In 'Wagon Tracks,' not even that, classical orchestra music.  Now, don't get me wrong, I love Dvorak's New World Symphony, but while it is thrilling, it doesn't match the action much of the time.  This is why I did not give this issue a full five-star rating, even though I enjoyed Hart and his authentic rendition of the Old West.  Having said that, this product is a good value for its price.",1362528000,3,943,4.5058823529411764
8462975,3,B0059GVBG2,"Hart's THE NARROW TRAIL is ok, marred by mediocre print quality. WAGON TRACKS is better with above-par print and some of the same actors from Hart's excellent final film, TUMBLEWEEDS.",1359072000,4,183,5.133333333333334
