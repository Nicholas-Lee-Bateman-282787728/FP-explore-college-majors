6603817,5,B00MWV4QI2,"I can't recommend this highly enough. I watched the original pilot (this DVD)  and then the subsequent 5 part series 1. It tells the uplifting story of Molly Dawes' progress as she completes her basic training and in series 1 (DVD to follow) she is a recently qualified combat medic in the British Army who is posted to Afghanistan. With realistically gritty action scenes and compelling character development both DVDs are not to be missed. The script and production values are superb and the use of music/songs throughout is fantastic. The acting by the all the  main characters is wonderful and the chemistry between Molly and her Captain  in series 1 is hot!!

Like me you will re-watch the DVDs multiple time. Enjoy!",1417132800,,721,4.837398373983739
6603818,5,B00MWV4QI2,"Fantastic pilot and Series 1 shown on the BBC. This drama has you gripped from the start, watching Molly Dawes change from an unconfident but mouthy 18 year old to a young woman who challenges the thoughts and feelings of even the most hardened of military personnel, ie the gorgeous Captain James. Superb acting and chemistry between the 3 main characters and one you will want to watch over and over again, as I have and am still doing! Hopefully series 2 will follow shortly.",1414627200,2,478,4.635294117647059
6603819,5,B00MWV4QI2,"Amazing drama from start to finish,this really took me there l was able to see what our service personnel go through on a daily basis to protect,nurture a more civilised life for the Afghan people. Working closely with the Afghan special forces.
Then you see the comradery,friendships build between a new medic on her first tour with her section. She proves she is an absolute diamond of a medic she saves lives and risks her own .She builds a relationship with a local girl which puts her and her section in danger. Watching it gives you a rollercoaster sense of emotions. It really is a must buy.
The Series 1 DVD is out on 03/11/14 go get it you will not be disappointed.",1414627200,,674,4.487804878048781
6603820,5,B00MWV4QI2,"You will be rooting for Molly Dawes all the way thru this drama from the BBC.
Lacey Turner portrays Molly with guts and honesty thru out this one off drama. Her personal struggles to find something to belong to will endear you to her in minutes.
You will want her to be successful and become a great soldier.

This drama was so popular in the UK that, the BCC commissioned a five part series which ends tonight and thousands if not millions have been tweeting, FB etc all week as we are hooked.

Buy this and join us you won't be disappointed!",1413676800,4,543,4.313725490196078
6603821,5,B00MWV4QI2,"Our girl is an inspiring movie about a girl from the roughest part of London with no prospects in life. By sheer chance she ends up outside an Army recruitment office after a drunken night out on her 18th birthday and decides to apply. The film follows her through selection and training. Its inspiring because as the movie progresses we see her gradually build her self esteem. Suddenly she realises she can actually be good at something and make a real contribution. At the same time the Army becomes the close family she never had. It ends with a posting as army paramedic to Afganistan.

This was so popular in the UK that it has now been made into a series. The first series of 5 episodes (set against the final withdrawal from Afganistan)  is being shown at  the moment (Oct '14) and, again, has proved hugely popular. It is both realistic and tense, showing us all back in our cosy homes what serving in Afganistan really means; 95% boredom and 5% fear of attack. It is also a story of a love affair strictly against military regulations. Think Pride and Prejudice meets MASH!!

The use of contemporary music is very well done.

Do try and get access to a multi region DVD player and watch this. You won't regret it.  Yes, its gritty and doesn't pull any punches but ultimately its a very uplifting drama.

Get a taster by looking at some clips on youtube.

UPDATE 12/12/14. Series 1 now finished in UK to amazing reviews. Very tense and emotional last episode. Check out AMAZON.CO.UK, ""Our Girl"" is currently NUMBER 1 best seller for TV Drama. Lots of viewer pressure for Series 2 asap?",1413590400,3,1594,4.568421052631579

8675173,3,B00MWV4QI2,"The program itself is excellent - great to see a story about someone taking their future into their own hands and turning it around. I found the performances excellent, especially Lacey Turner and Ben Aldridge. Great to have a female protagonist at the heart of a war story too.

Unfortunately, the DVD version of the program is vastly different to the version broadcast on TV. At least 10 minutes have been edited out of every episode; entire scenes deleted leaving some scenes very jumpy and strange. Also, the excellent sound track has been replaced with generic instrumental music. Extremely disappointing and doesn't do anything to discourage people from illegally downloading in order to have a copy of the original program. I feel like I have bought a Prada handbag only to find out it's a knock-off. Beware!

Some other criticisms: some of the editing of the storyline seemed inconsistent where lots of time is given at the start of each episode but towards the end they are sped through, for example, there is one scene with Molly wearing the military cross but nothing about her receiving it and I think we would have all like to have seen Molly and Charles' lips connect before cutting to a shot of the outside of Molly's house!? Bazaar! Also, Charles gets shot in the right leg then has a cast on his left (annoying oversight wardrobe department!).

Still love the show!",1433030400,,1382,4.798319327731092
8675174,5,B00MWV4QI2,"This is a great story about a young girl who finds her place in the world after joining the army.  She learns to channel her energies in a positive way, leading to some great acts of bravery and her finding a new understanding of her own and her new army family.  Great acting from some charismatic leads, real insight into the role of combat medic and an awesome soundtrack.  Buy this and you won't regret it!",1428192000,2,410,4.368421052631579
8675175,5,B00MWV4QI2,"This is the best drama series the BBC as done for many many years ,hopefully a second series will be commissioned I have never been so enthralled by a TV series as much as this one and through social media have made friends for life with many who feel the same",1428192000,2,260,4.117647058823529

8675178,5,B00MWV4QI2,"This is one of the best TV Dramas ever produced by the BBC. Why it has not been shown on Network TV in the US is beyond me.

It is set in Afghanistan in the last days of the Allied withdrawal from Camp Bastion. Medic Molly Dawes comes straight from her specialist training and has been assigned at the last minute. She faces all the issues of integrating at the last minutewith a Section of soldiers (all male of course) who have trained for months together. The tension of life for a soldier in Afghan is beautifully described; the 5% terror (from suicide bombers and IEDs) and the 95% boredom. As the episodes unfurl Molly makes her mark it is clear she is very competent at  her job. Overlying this is love story which is totally against Army regulations. Production values are high and the two lead actors have amazing chemistry.

Move Heaven and Earth to see this. Get a mult-region player. Do whatever you have to. You will not regret it!",1428192000,2,944,4.476744186046512
