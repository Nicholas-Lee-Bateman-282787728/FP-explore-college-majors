8692564,4,B00QSCZEGE,"We LOVE all the Brother Francis DVDs; our family is a big fan! The only thing I didn't love about this one is that it is for the older side of their audience, probably 2nd grade would be the average target.  It addresses things like being unkind in the classroom, and there is a long story about being unkind in the lunch room (girls not allowing another girl to sit with them). It is presented well, but far too old for my four year old.  I have felt like the other videos are more accessible across the age range.  Still, we love to support this terrific company!",1477008000,4,565,4.261682242990654

8692567,5,B00QSCZEGE,"Most children know the right answers when called on in Religious Education, but few children turn those words into actions. With Volume 9 of Brother Francis, Following in His Footsteps, your children will learn what it really means to be followers/disciples of Jesus by turning their words into actions. The first example they are given is ""The Parable of the Sheep and Goats."" In this Scripture passage, we see Jesus talking to a flock of sheep and goats and separating them. The sheep receive the eternal reward, because they helped their fellow man who was hungry or thirsty. The goats receive eternal punishment, because they did not help their fellow man. This really is one of the most haunting passages in the Gospels, because I always question whether I am doing enough to help others. The other story talks about the man who built his house on the sand and the one who built his on the rock, and teaches your children about living with faith in God as opposed to living without him. If you build your house on the rock (faith in God), then you will be able to withstand any storm, but if you do not and opt for sand (faith in yourself or possessions), then with the slightest storm, you'll get overwhelmed. This was a great episode and a perfect follow-up to Born into the Kingdom.",1453852800,,1290,4.613043478260869
