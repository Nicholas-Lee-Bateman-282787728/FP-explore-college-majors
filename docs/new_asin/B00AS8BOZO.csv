5497425,3,B00AS8BOZO,"Never been a big fan of ""Live"" or ""Best Of"" cds, especially from groups I like, such as Chevelle. This is simply to pay for the cost of the new cd that they are currently working on, though they call it a celebration of 10 years of Chevelle. Yeah, they sound good live and all, but most already have all their cds, so unless you're either a completist or a casual, this is really a waste.",1303862400,,388,4.118421052631579
5497426,5,B00AS8BOZO,"I've been a Chevelle fan since they first came on the scene. They're Illinois natives like myself which probably makes me biased in my opinion! I've been to nearly 100 Chevelle shows (yes really!) and they never disappoint. They're also the nicest guys I've ever met. From their first album ""Point #1"" you saw these young guys from Grayslake, Il - with younger brother Joe being around the age 14- emerge on the scene making their mark, from playing back yard cookouts, parties and local Chicago clubs to the recording studio. Their sophomore effort ""Wonder What""s next"" made you really wonder what's next as it catapulted them into the mainstream spot light,with songs like ""Send the Pain Below"" and fan favorite ""The Red"", along with the title track. With Pete Loeffler's lyrics, guitar and soft then loud vocals, Sam Loeffler on drums and Joe Loeffler on bass, these brothers pushed forward and delivered ""This Type of Thinking..."" with hits like ""The Clincher"" and ""Vitamin R"". Unfortunately,due to personal differences younger brother Joe left Chevelle. He was replaced by brother-in-law Dean Bernadini for their next two albums ""Vena Sera"" and ""Sci Fi Crimes"".
""Any Last Words"" is the 10 year anniversary CD/DVD collection of some of their best songs. I was there for those shows, it was awesome. With songs like ""The Red"", ""Get Some"", ""I Get It"" and the never before released ""Sleep Walking Elite"" you know why these guys are one of the greatest bands in rock.  There are some critics out here that say Chevelle is repetitious and you get the same thing every time. None of their songs sound the same. The only thing they do the same is the format of their albums; they start out by drawing you in with a heavy sound and they take it from there. Songs like ""Family System"", ""The Clincher"", ""Anitsaint"" and ""Sleep Apnea"" draw you in. They give slower tempo songs like ""Vitamin R"", ""Closure"", ""Saferwaters"" and ""Shameful Metaphors"".As for their live performances;if you see a Chevelle show two nights in row you will not get the same set list. They deliver! A decade has only made these guys better! ""Any Last Words"" is also a tribute to the fans as well, with a special thank you, by name to their fans. These guys are not only great musicians but great people period. They are humble and grateful to the fans that have supported them over the decade and grateful as well for any new supporters.
""Any Last Words"" is a must have to any true Chevelle fan!",1303344000,27,2459,4.731934731934732
5497447,5,B00AS8BOZO,"More songs in total (especially more old songs) would've been great, but still an excellent collection. I highly recommend this item.",1388880000,,133,5.380952380952381
5497448,5,B00AS8BOZO,I love this CD/DVD. I got it for a awesome price! And waited a long time for it to become cheap,1372204800,,95,3.5714285714285716
5497449,5,B00AS8BOZO,"The for being a DVD, the picture is in great quality. The audio is clean, and the music live has so much emotion. I blast it on my Bose speakers and enjoy!",1370044800,,155,3.875
5497450,5,B00AS8BOZO,"Chevelle fans, please ignore most of the lower ratings/reviews for this product. For whatever bizzare reason the reviews for Chevelle's Any Last Words and a film entitled Any Last Words are currently lumped together. So the poor reviews for the film are negatively impacting the average review score for the Chevelle set, while the good reviews for the Chevelle set are raising the average score of the mostly poorly reviewed movie. I'm hoping this will be eventually fixed but until it is I thought it should be noted somewhere.
That being said, this is a nice gift for fans of Chevelle. I was happy to be able to get some live stuff, there is another older live dvd available but I preferred the song selection on this one. I think the price is fair considering you get both a CD & DVD of the show and certain stores (in my area at least) would add another $10-$20 to the price because this is a 2 disc set.
If you love Chevelle this is definitely worth buying.",1357689600,8,963,4.4772727272727275
5497451,5,B00AS8BOZO,"I absolutely love Any Last Words. The music sounds awesome. The concert is well-shot. The band sounds amazing. The entire package is excellent, very high quality!",1344470400,2,162,5.269230769230769
5497452,2,B00AS8BOZO,"The sound on the CD is terrible! I'm as big a Chevelle fan as any, but can't recommend this combo. The DVD is great for those not fortunate enough to see them live, but the audio could have been much, much better.",1337299200,,213,4.095238095238095
5497453,5,B00AS8BOZO,"Chevelle's live performance from Chicago in October 2010 marks a ten year anniversary for the Chicago trio.  In a day and age when it seems hard rock is somewhat stale, Chevelle continues to be consistent and impressive, with meaningful lyrics as well as addicting guitar riffs and melodies.  Some may say that they haven't changed much and are repetitive, but I would disagree with this. Chevelle, being one of the more underrated bands out there, gives a memorable, high energy performance here. I've never had the chance to see them live, so it was nice to find this DVD of the band.

This DVD/ CD combo has a wide range of songs from their albums and really displays Chevelle's consistency over the years, as this concert has songs from their earlier discs (Point #1, This Type of Thinking Could Do Us In) all the way to Sci Fi Crimes. They do a great job with all the songs, but I thought some of the highlights of the concert were ""Antisaint"", ""An Evening with El Diablo"" and ""Sleep Apnea."" It's good to see them mix in the ""non"" radio songs in along with their obvious hits (""Send the Pain Below"", ""The Red"", ""The Clincher"", ""Letter from a Thief""). This also features ""Sleep Walking Elite"", bonus track on Vera Sera.

This is a definitely buy for Chevelle fans out there looking for a good live show. Turn it on, turn it up and prepare to rock out!",1333411200,3,1355,4.518367346938776
5497454,5,B00AS8BOZO,"I buy this as gift to my husband, If you love rock this is for you, the lyrics are unique, is hard rock and a little different than other commercial products.  I will just love it.",1328832000,2,180,4.0
5497455,3,B00AS8BOZO,"I got this concert cause I like Chevelle for a long time now (yes, Chevelle also have fans in Chile!!!)... I've expected to hear and see a better concert than Live From The Norva.... Image quality is better, much better... and the audio mix also is an improve from their last live DVD... But now that I have listening twice and more times, the only thing that kept in my mind that Chevelle maybe never will sound in a concert or DVD like their sound in their studio albums. Don't get me wrong but this is an opinion from someone who likes Chevelle a lot, and from someone that listen to many music and go to every concert around the place... When you get a DVD concert you either want to remember some place where you have been, or you want to check if the band sounds like the CD... I don't question the powerfull that the band probably bring to the stage, I can say for the footage... If I have the opportunity to see this guys playing live, sure I will be first in line, to see and hear if I'm right or wrong, but for the time now, is a good concert but be aware if you are looking for something like the album... and if you have doubts between this DVD and Live from the Norva, for it's quality I prefer this one... Although the tracks include are much different between them.",1324684800,8,1280,4.2073170731707314
