8656343,4,B005CV7ZWI,"There is only one thing wrong with this dvd for teaching kids to recognize emotional affect.  It is extremely well designed, but its from the UK, and this North American version has been dubbed so the lip movements do not match the speech.  Also, there is only one narrator who does voices for all the characters, and the accent for one of the African-American characters is just a little overdone.  If you can overlook that and you work with or have an autistic child, get this by all means, it is expensive but worth it.",1339891200,2,522,4.473684210526316
