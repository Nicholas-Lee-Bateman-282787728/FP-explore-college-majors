8625792,5,B00GOYHPAO,I just recently had the pleasure of watching this movie for the first time and I have to say I really enjoyed it. I watched it with my kids last weekend and it was delightful for all of us. The story is really genuine and the whole thing is a lot of fun. I thought all of the actors did a great job and I was impressed by how well everything pieced together. It was entertaining for me as an adult yet my kids were also highly interested in watching it. When it comes to movies that revolve around an animal as a main character I think this film should be up there with the best of them. Great film and I highly recommend it!,1424131200,2,625,4.008
8625793,1,B00GOYHPAO,"I really wanted to like this film; I'm a science fiction buff and enjoy movies that show events from a kid's perspective.  But wow.  I have never seen writing in any film that was as poor as in this one.  I wish I were exaggerating.  It was as though it was written over a weekend by a junior high student that wasn't permitted to rewrite anything.  From the weird, poorly thought out and inconsistent behavior of its less than one-dimensional characters to the absurd and baseless assumptions made by the protagonists that nevertheless always turned out to be true - I felt embarrassed for the poor actors who had to actually say all that silly stuff.

With such a whimsical title, I'd hoped for some whimsy and fun in the story.  Alas, the tone of the movie is dead serious.  The writer managed to take a concept like a space-time wormhole in someone's backyard and make it tedious and uninteresting.

I like to balance my reviews of movies with both their good and bad qualities, but I'm having a rough time with the upside of this one.",1420502400,2,1039,4.5133689839572195
8625794,4,B00GOYHPAO,"I guess I'm biased in favor of this movie because I helped out on set, but the end result, while definitely reliant upon the audience's ability to suspend disbelief, is a charming and well-photographed movie.  The plot and dialogue are a tad cheesy at times, but a lot of people like cheese. At one point it seemed like maybe a scene was left out, but everything else seems well thought-out.  Also, Chris Lemmon looks eerily like his father at times, so that's cool to see.  Cute kid actors and a very well-trained dog star.",1409097600,3,524,4.553191489361702
