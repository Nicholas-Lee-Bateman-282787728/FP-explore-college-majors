8252049,3,B000MCH112,"I bought this DVD (but was sent one with a different picture) because of the song Zaara, Zaara and saw that Saif Ali Khan was in it too.  They do not mention his name on the cover as one of the actors!  ""RHTDM"" is a film about  two rivals in school and later in their personal lives.  Madhav Shastri, (R. Madhavan) is  an annoyingly, aggressive, self-important upstart who thinks himself more important than anyone else.  He likes his friends and everyone else to do his bidding!  He doesn't care much for women and dislikes his rival, Sam (Saif Ali Khan), a well-mannered guy, very popular with both sexes especially the women whom he defends against Madhav.  Confrontations and fights occur between Madhav and Sam.  Sam courageously stands his ground.  After graduation Madhav vows never to meet Sam again.  Sam immigrates to America and three years later Madhav is teaching mechanical engineering.  Over the years, Sam and Madhav have forgotten each other until a beautiful girl, Reena (Divya Mirza) enters their lives.  Will Reena fall for the lying scoundrel Madhav who won't change his arrogant and aggressive ways?  Does Reena deserve Sam, the ever considerate gentleman any girl would want?  Is Sam better off without her?  Fate, as always, plays a hand in determining one's destiny!",1363737600,,1291,4.934883720930233
