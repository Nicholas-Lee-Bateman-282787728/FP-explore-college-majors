7953079,2,B00005RZR7,"Sexual harassment in the workplace leaves a young woman no option but to risk everything and take her case to the court-room.

Working in a branch office of the IRS, Kerry Ellison (Rena Sofer) must suffer the unwanted advances of co-worker Jack Gilcrest (Victor Garber). Even when Jack is transferred to another branch his stalking does not diminish. In a last-ditch effort to see that justice is done, Kerry files a sexual harassment suit against her employers, based on a true story.

It's a story that's been told many times before, and though interesting in itself, does not bring much that is new to the discussion. This movie puts down such ""flirting"" as scary, driving the woman in question, into nightmares, out of her job, and, ultimately, to a lawsuit.

Justice is shoehorned into a typically melodramatic format in this mediocre TV-movie that at times has all the subtlety of a stalker thriller. Rena Sofer at times looking overly imperilled as she makes her impassioned plea for justice, and director Allan Kroeker has Victor Garber gnawing on the scenery as her nemesis.",1428364800,2,1083,4.93956043956044
7953080,4,B00005RZR7,"A great movie that delves into the issue of sexual harrassment and how difficult it is to prove. Victor Garber gives an outstanding performance as the obsessed co-worker intent on getting the attentions of his peer at any cost.  As in many instances, there are no winners, and the victims usually do not come out of the experience unscathed.  My only issue was the packaging on this DVD - so over-gluded and sticky the case had to be discarded.",1374624000,5,444,4.6075949367088604
7953081,5,B00005RZR7,I really liked this movie. Rena Sofer played the part so well. For those who have been in a situation like this or who have empathy for others who have will find this movie engaging and very well done. It's based on a true story and helps present the feelings and raw emotions that a sexual harasser causes his victim.  Worth a watch! It was a memorable movie for me and I want to watch it again!,1373155200,2,396,4.142857142857143
7953082,2,B00005RZR7,Can't relate to the main character or the creep. Good to fill in time if you're really bored but I don't recommend it.,1211760000,,118,4.173913043478261
