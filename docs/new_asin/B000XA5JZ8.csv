3000332,5,B000XA5JZ8,"Each year of this series is quite entertaining. The characters are interesting and the casting is remarkable. Tension, drama, and conflict between characters is thought-provoking and great fun.  Many quietly humorous moments add depth and variety.  Nice theme and incidental music.  The writers, directors, and producers truly know how to tell a story and command your attention. This entire DVD set of all episodes has a well-deserved and cherished place in my DVD collection.",1221523200,,477,5.418918918918919

3000334,1,B000XA5JZ8,"Hustle had such promise at the end of its third season.  Then Adrian Lester left for other projects.  Those who remained soldiered on in his absence and produced a fourth season.  Having watched it, though, perhaps they should have known when to walk away.  The characters foundered without a leader. The series itself was left without even adequate plots.  An episode about horse racing--wait, wasn't that done in the first season?  Two episodes filmed in the U.S. in the same season?  Isn't this a British series?  The only con that occurred in season four was the one perpetrated on the viewers, who were fooled into watching this utter disappointment.

The fourth season undoubtedly put an end to what was a great series.  As far as this fan is concerned, though, Hustle ended after three terrific seasons.",1206316800,3,810,4.889705882352941
3000335,5,B000XA5JZ8,"The gang's all here. Well...sort of. Mickey Bricks is gone. Bummer. hopefully he will be back next season but i think that Adrian Lester (Mickey Bricks) just wanted to move on. This is definitely still my favorite tv show, but if i remember correctly, Danny Blue gets a phone call from Mickey asking if he needed help, so *hint *hint at the end of this season. not a spoiler don't worry. My opinion is hope for the best, but with or without Mickey, this is still THE BEST tv show out there. 5 stars. This is what Wikipedia has to say about it. that last quote....not looking too good :(

On 14 May 2007, it was confirmed that the BBC had commissioned a fifth series, but is unsure on how many episodes. Some sources say that there will be six, whereas as other say there will be 8 or even 10, if Adrian Lester decides to reprise his role as Michael Stone. It also has been claimed that more episodes will be filmed in the US, with a number of Hollywood names interested in a part in the show.[citation needed]

An interview with Robert Glenister in The Stage magazine, published that same month indicated the BBC hadn't commissioned any new episodes at that point.[3]

On the October 30th 2007, TvSquad interviewed Robert Vaughn. According to Vaughn: ""We've shot 24 episodes so far and we have another six to shoot... the schedule now is to not only do the fifth season but also 20th Century Fox has optioned it for a motion picture which would be a prequel to the television show in the sense that you will find out how we all met. And that's the plan, of course with motion pictures when the head of a studio changes the next person who takes the job erases the entire slate, so that might not happen, but we're pretty certain we're going to be doing the fifth season in the early spring or late winter.""[4]

On January 14th 2008 the Mirror newspaper reported that the BBC had axed Hustle after four series due to a lot of the cast doing other projects. Marc Warren is quoted as saying ""I'd certainly be surprised if I were involved with more episodes of Hustle.""[5]",1201737600,18,2068,4.434210526315789

8227665,4,B000XA5JZ8,"Surfing thru BBC series...I came across this series in a box collection..1-4.
The first 3 was great and a pleasure to watch.  But with Mickey Bricks (Adrian Lester) gone for whatever reason...with Danny Blue (  Marc Warren) taking the lead in set 4 it lacks the panache of the first 3.  I have seen while surfing the BBC list of series that there is a set 5 with Adrian Lester back. Hopefully it will soon be available for USA purchase and as good as the first 3.",1310515200,,463,4.2988505747126435

8227667,5,B000XA5JZ8,"We love Hustle, though, this version (without Adrian Lester) isn't quite as good as the earlier seasons.  Can't wait for the newest season (where Adrian is back) to become available.",1274054400,,182,5.066666666666666
8227668,2,B000XA5JZ8,"Unfortunately, it only took two episodes of Danny Blue in charge for me to stop watching the entire 4th season. Every show needs a baffoon, but you don't put the baffoon in charge, it's not even logical to think they would do that, and it's very hard to watch.
I hear Adrian Lester will be back for season 5. I may pick the series up again then. Excellent Series until this point, though. 1, 2 and 3 are well worth it.",1233446400,4,418,4.172839506172839
8227669,4,B000XA5JZ8,"This show definitely took a hit when Mickey Bricks, the leader of this gang of long-con hustlers for three seasons, disappeared from the stage, but the cast and creators did their best to stay on top of the game.  Danny Blue (Marc Warren) must prove himself capable of leadership to the rest of the gang, and they take in a new grifter (Ashley Walters) who has a checkered past and plenty of rough edges, but also lots of natural talent.  This season is entertaining, but there are no really great episodes as there were in earlier seasons.  It also features one of the worst episodes of the entire series, in which a young Japanese man arrives at Eddie's Bar, apparently to revenge himself on the criminals who cheated his father.  It saves itself to some extent with a good twist at the end, but there is not enough movement and the depiction of Japanese culture is too cartoonish.

Wikipedia claims that a fifth series is on the way, but that Marc Warren and Jaime Murray will not be among the cast.  That's a shame.  It would have been nice to see Adrian Lester return so that Mickey and Danny could contend for leadership.",1223683200,3,1127,4.522167487684729
8227670,2,B000XA5JZ8,"In my humble opinion the whole series should have been over after 2 seasons. The third one is just nice try of the script writer to extend the life of characters by putting some new make-up. Yet, you can feel there the spirit of a true hustle genius in some episodes. However, the season four is something unbearably boring and, how to say, expectable. First of all, the failure of season four is not the foult of key character being changed - oh no! It's the authors, the writers, who should be blamed exclusively. Watching the episodess, one by one, you can see, almost feel like the actors are really trying to boast their characters above the plastic frames they've been put in. It's like undusting the old briliant schemes, the flame that's been put out and never to be set again.
Dear writers - if it ever crosses your mind (you say it did actually) to write 5th season, please bring on board someone fresh or just go for a long holidays and re-think. Do not make the same mistake twice. Please !!
My recommendation: if you are a true fan of the series - buy it and watch it to see for yourself, but surely it's not worth the price it is actually sold for.",1221955200,2,1162,4.359447004608295
