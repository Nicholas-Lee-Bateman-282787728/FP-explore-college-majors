You know - where he puts no periods at the ends of sentences, but talks every phrase as a question!!!???  I actually feel like I wasted twenty bucks, cuz I just can't get thru this DVD, and worse, I can never refer to it. Gotta look elsewhere for crisp, clean, lucid GarageBand instruction.

By the way, reviewer ""MLaseen's"" comments are right on the money!",1358899200,,482,4.658823529411765
8380159,2,B002TJ68CE,"This training DVD has many promising chapters introducing Garageband 09, with a good instructor and a motivated student,
however the fatal flaw is that you cannot see the computer screen clearly on the video! Despite the fancy Mac monitor, it is very hard to see the details - how can you learn software with lots of features if you can't clearly see what's on the screen?

Another comment is that, despite the enthusiasm of the musician learning the program, it may have been more efficient to have the experienced instructor doing the clicking to save time.

Hopefully if they produce another training video for Garageband they will make sure that the computer screen is magnified adequately.

The saving grace are the DVD-ROM clips which are in Quicktime and have slightly better image clarity.",1276041600,4,797,4.977443609022556
