6475219,4,B00L8QOZ1A,"Universal surprisingly released two new monster collections to blu ray well before October this year, With Dracula and The Mummy collections done and the Frankenstein and Wolfman sets released last year, the remaining classic monsters Creature from the Black Lagoon and Invisible Man sets are sure to follow.....or will there be a 30 movie collection on the horizon?

The Mummy set is the best set with only one film duplication, but the Dracula set Im reviewing here is also very good. The original Dracula starring Bela Lugosi is by far the best film on this set and the first disc features that film along with all of the bonus material (except trailers for the individual films on the other discs). Belas portrayal of the vampire remains the best Dracula ever. Included on this disc is the Spanish version of the film which I like as it has several shots that are very impressive.  The running time which is almost twice as long as the U.S. version drags too much and of course no one can match or surpass Lugosi;s performance.

Disc two features Draculas Daughter and Son Of Dracula. Both films look great in high def showing impressive detail, the sound is also improved. The films themselves are not as iconic as the main features, but are atmospheric and of good quality. Im glad Universal gave these sequels the restoration they deserved. (I am still a little salty over the lackluster treatment of Werewolf of London and She-Wolf of London!).

Disc three holds the third duplicates of The House of Frankenstein and House of Dracula, the only plus here is that we get a new disc that only has two films instead of three omitting Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman.

Disc four holds Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein which again is the third duplicate if you've been buying all of these new monster collections. Great movie and I guess I can rest assured that I will always have a copy on blu ray that works with three discs of the same film in my collection. Overall I am happy with this upgrade and at $24 it is certainly worth it.

The case is familiar looking, but it is a nice package, no sleeves, we get hubs and no stacking either. The films all look and sound great so there really isn't much to complain about other than it would have been nice to get commentaries for the new films to blu ray as I'm sure fans would have enjoyed hearing stories regarding the making of these minor classics. The duplications are a minor irritant and I suppose if you're someone a who only wants to collect certain monster characters the inclusion of the sequels on multiple sets is probably welcome.",1508112000,5,2598,4.649237472766885

6475222,5,B00L8QOZ1A,What's not to like? Six superbly entertaining Dracula movies! I could watch these movies over and over without losing interest. Highest rating with excellent picture quality for such old movies.,1505779200,,194,5.5
6475223,5,B00L8QOZ1A,"Universal's ""Dracula"" is, my opinion, the first true American classic of the sound era. Bela's role is iconic, the set design virtually invented (with the help of ""The Cat Creeps"" silent version) the concept of what a spooky old house should look like, the brilliant and often overlooked performance of Dwight Fry carries the middle the the picture; it is one of the greatest movies ever made and always will be. The transfer is good, probably the best we will have for a long time, altho maybe 4K will improve the image quality. From there, things pretty much have to go downhill, don't they?  ""Daughter"" has a great transfer, but I just do not think it is a good movie. The love story is trite, silly, slows the movie down to a crawl, and should have been edited out. But it looks great. ""Son"" is a better movie, Lon Chaney gives a good, strong, brooding and menacing performance, far better than his cry-baby ""Wolfman"" wretchedness. Not enough Evelyn Ankers tho, but I like it. The 2 ""House"" movies are both war era ""B"" efforts, but ""B"" movies made by the pros at Universal are always a treat. Again, great set design and lighting, old skool Hollywood acting, I love both of them. Boris and John Carradine are their usual fabulous selves, solid 4 Stars all the way. Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein is an absolute hoot, just a pure, crazy, fun movie of the highest order. I think kids will love it too. To sum up, you get 6 Blu ray movies, tons of extras on the Dracula disc, 1 Immortal classic, 3 good, fun movies, 1 OK movie, and a real treat of a movie at the end. I will enjoy all these for the rest of my life and they look great on my Vizio 4K too.",1504656000,,1661,4.375404530744337
6475224,5,B00L8QOZ1A,"I have all the DVD legacy collections and waited for the BDs.  I already have the Frankenstein and Wolf Man collections in BD. This collection has great picture and sound, my only complaint is the same one I had with the DVD collection.  The Spanish language version of Dracula was not fully restored, which is a shame as it is a good picture.  It has some scenes that are better than the Tod Browning English language version (the middle of which is basically a filmed stage play).  The third reel of the Spanish language version was sourced from a 16mm print that was not in good condition.  You can see the picture quality go from good to poor at about 19 minutes into the film, luckily it is only one reel and the rest is decent.
Of course if, like me, you buy all the Legacy Collections in BD you wind up with multiple copies of ""House of Frankenstein"", ""House of Dracula"" and ""Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein"".  But for the price of the collections that is not really a problem.  I only hope when they do the ""Creature from the Black Lagoon""  collection in BD they include the 3-D versions of the first two.",1503273600,,1119,4.424390243902439

Like the others, Daughter and Son were treated with the same care of remastering in both picture and sound.

6475247,5,B00L8QOZ1A,"This is a worthy upgrade! BluRay is well done and audio is cleaner than I heard before. You really can't beat these old classics they are still the yard stick which most horror films are compared to.
This was Bela's legacy to horror and even the great Christopher Lee's version is usually put in second place to it.
The Complete Legacy sets do get redundant with repeat presentations of the House of and Abbott and Costello Meet movies in three main sets but I chose Dracula to be my BluRay because it was the least expensive. Since then I see the others have a lowered price also.
I really like Son of Dracula and feel it is a maligned minor classic because Lon Chaney jr. is the lead. I personally like him as Dracula and it is a tight well done b horror classic.
I own the original Legacy sets and I even have the 75th anniversary editions to most of them and these upgrades are really worth it to the collector of horror films. Universal is great classic set for the whole family and My kids and grandkids still watch them with me till this day.
All of the extras from the previous sets. Enjoy!",1503014400,2,1098,4.334951456310679

Both look and sound absolutely stunning. Worth the double dip. (Personally, I view the redundant discs as backups. I'll probably watch every one of these movies at least another dozen times in my life, and accidents do happen.) Both ""Daughter"" and ""Son"" are beautifully made productions with lots of sumptuous visuals and smartly composed shots; their restorations here do them full justice in glorious HD.

If you haven't picked up the Wolf Man and Frankenstein sets yet and this one interests you, you're in for a treat. If you already have most of these films on Blu-ray and don't want to double dip, you can always wait for them to release a double feature of just ""Son"" and ""Daughter.""",1495411200,6,921,5.0130718954248366

Disc 3: ""House Of Frankenstein"" & ""House Of Dracula""

6475365,5,B00L8QOZ1A,"Back in 2014 Universal issued the ""Classic Monsters Complete 30 Film Legacy Collection"" DVD mega-box.
ALL the Dracula, Frankenstein, Mummy, Invisible Man and Wolf Man movies produced by Universal in the 1930s and '40s, plus some stragglers from the 1950s.
Individual multi-disc boxes were also issued for each monster.
Now Universal is gradually re-releasing these ""Legacy Collection"" boxes on Blu-Ray with improved black & white pictures.
Its amazing how many shades of gray those old negatives had.
Quite beautiful pictures.
No new extras on Blu-Ray, but all the extras from DVD have been carried over:
Commentary tracks, bonus features, and English SDH subtitles.

The ""Dracula Legacy Collection"" contains seven films on four Blu-Rays.
Difficult to believe, but Universal lost confidence in Bela Lugosi after the first Dracula film, and kept looking for another actor to play the role.
They reluctantly cast Lugosi in the final film, ""Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein"", which turned out to be the second-best Dracula film ever after the 1931 original.

-- ""Dracula"" (1931) starring Bela Lugosi as Dracula + two audio commentaries
-- ""Dracula"" (Spanish version, 1931) starring Carlos Villar&iacute;as as Dr&aacute;cula
-- ""Dracula's Daughter"" (1936) starring Gloria Holden as Dracula's daughter
-- ""Son of Dracula"" (1943) starring Lon Chaney as Count Alucard *
-- ""House of Frankenstein"" (1944) with John Carradine as Dracula
-- ""House of Dracula"" (1945) with John Carradine as Dracula
-- ""Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein"" (1948) with Bela Lugosi as Dracula + audio commentary

* Dracula spelled backward

-- ""Dracula's Daughter"" opens where ""Dracula"" left off (clever idea).
The local Police, investigating a disturbance at Carfax Abbey, discover Professor Van Helsing standing over Dracula's corpse, a stake through his heart.
Van Helsing is handcuffed and taken to jail, where he is charged with the Count's murder.
-- ""Son of Dracula"" - am I the only one who noticed the resemblance of the mustachioed Lon Chaney Jr./Count Alucard to Clark Gable/Rhett Butler?

Only one of the four discs in the Dracula set is new to Blu-Ray.

Disc 1 (""Dracula"" + bonus features) is the 2012 Hi-Def Blu-Ray transfer used in the Universal Classic Monsters Blu-Ray Collection (8 discs).
Disc 4 (""Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein"") was released on Blu-Ray in 2014.
-- Universal Blu-Rays released before 2015 do not have the ""Resume Movie"" option.
When your viewing is interrupted in the middle of a film, you cannot resume watching at the point where you left off, but have to go back to the beginning of the disc.
I wish Universal had re-engineered Discs 1 & 4 to include that convenient feature, but I guess they wanted to save money.
Not a deal-breaker, but it would be nice.
(the actual picture quality is not affected).

Disc 3 (""House of Frankenstein"" + ""House of Dracula"") is the same Blu-Ray used in last year's Legacy Collections devoted to Frankenstein and the Wolf Man.
Disc 2 (""Dracula's Daughter"" + ""Son of Dracula"") is released for the first time on Blu-Ray in this new Dracula collection.
These two discs have the ""Resume Movie"" feature.

Though Universal was reluctant to cast him again as Dracula,
MGM and Columbia each hired Lugosi to play a very Dracula-like Vampire on film.
But for legal reasons they couldn't call him ""Count Dracula"".
Recommended for those who can't get enough of Bela Lugosi as a blood-sucking vampire:

-- ""Mark of the Vampire"" (1935), MGM cast Lugosi as ""Count Mora"".
Directed by Tod Browning, who directed the original ""Dracula"".
Entertaining despite a disappointing ending:

-- ""The Return of the Vampire"" (1943), Columbia cast Lugosi as ""Armand Tesla"".
Interesting World War II angle:
A German bombing raid accidentally targets a British cemetery where the vampire Tesla's body rests after having been staked twenty years before.
The disturbance loosens the stake and sets him free.
Released the same year and in competition with Universal's ""Son of Dracula"" with a miscast Lon Chaney Jr.

Universal has been extra-thorough in assembling these boxes, which means there is considerable overlap.

Also, Frankenstein, Dracula and the Wolf Man teamed up for three films: ""House of Frankenstein"", ""House of Dracula"" and ""Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein"".
All three films appear in each of three collections

Legends of vampires go back thousands of years to Classical Greece, and India and China. The signs of a vampire victim were pallor, fatigue or listlessness, a loss of weight, and death. These are the same symptoms of a person with tuberculosis, an often fatal disease until the developments of antibiotics in the mid-twentieth century. Before the discovery of the germ theory sickness was attributed to divine wrath (punishment for sins) or to curses and spells by witches or people in league with the devil. This followed the Renaissance science of the 16th century. Witches caused diseases, that is why they were hunted down and killed. Dracula is a murder mystery about the search for an unknown serial killer. The historic Vlad Dracula is a national hero in Romania who lived in the late 15th century (a contemporary of Richard III). Vlad Dracula was praised by the Pope of his day for never being defeated by the Turkish Sultan. Bram Stokers 1897 novel was never translated into many languages but never the Romanian language.

Disc 1
Dracula (1931) was adapted from a stage play that dramatized the novel. The censors of the British Empire banned horror films around 1937. The Philip Glass score adds light music to the story and fills in the silent scenes. Movie theaters were in transition to talking movies and people were used to quiet passages. There are books on the subject of Dracula. The legend of Dracula may be a parable on the spread of bad blood that dooms a victim. Screenwriter Kurt Siodmak was credited with inventing some of the legends about vampires and werewolves.

Disc 2
Draculas Daughter (1936) is another of the sequels that are common in Hollywood. A very successful movie keeps on repeating as long as it attracts an audience. See Jaws or Psycho.
Son of Dracula (1943) is the best of the sequels. A mysterious foreigner, Count Alucard, visits a small town in America. Can the people extinguish his predations?
House of Frankenstein (1944) tells what happened to Draculas skeleton. When freed, Dracula goes on to attack people until he suffers from a fatal case of sunburn. Later they find the Wolfman and the Monster in an ice cavern. Can the people put an end to the Monsters?

Disc 3
House of Dracula (1945) is the last of the sequels during this era. It is an average story that seems to put an end to the monsters. At least until the economy and market research decides there is an audience for this type of movie. Then a new generation of movies are produced and marketed.
Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948) shows the boys at work moving crates from Europe to the House of Horror. These are the remains of Frankenstein and Dracula. Larry Talbot calls to warn them! There is comic action and confusion along with the threats from monsters.

Disc 4

Dracula (1931) Spanish Language version was produced at night, the morning was used for the English language version. Different actors were used with the same sets, it script was not censored for the British market. Whenever possible the same scenes were used in both movies, which may explain the silent scenes. This version retained its full 105-minutes, the English version was later cut back to 75 minutes and shown as a B movie.",1485648000,,3272,4.792553191489362

6475546,5,B00L8QOZ1A,"This collection also contains the Spanish version of Dracula which was film on the same set as the English version at night after the day crew was gone. In my opinion, in acting ability, it's much better than the English Version, especially Carlos Villiar's acting as Dracula. This is probably because the film crew had the opportunity to see the English-speaking crews' dailies and their techniques as well as mistakes and either copy of delete them.

As with most of Universal's franchises, the first three in the series are the best, Dracula's Daughter with its psychological themes is better than the original in fact, which is nothing more than a filming of a stage play and is rather stiff and stilted because it has very few outside shots.  After Son of Dracula with an ill-cast Lon Chaney Junior as Count Alucard (yes, that's where the name originated) they degenerate into a mere monster-mash, throwing all the monsters into the mix in an attempt to draw audiences.

Modern audiences may find these film lacking a bit because of our advances in CGI but the changing of Dracula into a bat in the latter films and the bouncy bat on a string was probably considered innovative in its day.

It's interest from a cinematically historical viewpoint to see these movies which started the Dracula craze and led to so many copies, remakes, and sequels, some which are definitely much better than the original, some which are homages or pastiches, and some which are blatantly ridiculous.

They good fun to watch, good from a historical standpoint, and just plain good.",1443571200,12,1568,4.857677902621723

The 1st time was on VHS back in the day, 2nd time was when it was released on DVD, 3rd time was when it was released in the Legacy Collection, 4th time was when it was released on Blu-ray, and now the 5th time being released on the Complete Legacy Collection, mainly because the previous Legacy Collection had 2-sided discs that were scratched and didn't work, and this (like all of the Complete Legacy Collection) has all movies where the character in question made an appearance, including the Abbott and Costello movies, which I didn't have. So if Universal ever decides to release the Complete Legacy Collection on Blu-ray, it will be the 6th time I'll buy this film, and I'll officially be bled dry like I'm Dracula's b*tch.

This collection contains 4 discs, all one-sided:

-Disc 1-

-The Road To Dracula (documentary)
-Lugosi-The Dark Prince (documentary)
-Dracula Archives
-Theatrical Trailer

The transfer of this Dracula release is quite good. The picture quality is extremely clear and sharp. They even fixed a few things, as they did in the Blu-ray release, such as removing the crackling and popping in the audio, and fixing the broken Title Credits sequence.

The Menu screens aren't anything special though, wish they could've been a bit flashier like the previous Legacy Collection.

I like the fact that not only are the discs one-sided discs, but that the 2nd disc has 3 movies on it, and the 3rd disc has 2 movies on it. Saves a lot of getting up and down when you want to have that spectacular monster movie marathon. And they do try to follow the monster's timeline (as opposed to the previous Legacy Collection that jumped around between different sets as the monsters' stories inter-mingled). With this, if you end up purchasing the entire line of Complete Legacy Collections, you will end up with multiple copies of the same movie. But again, it's all for the purpose of preserving each monster's timeline within the same collection.

So all in all, I'd say it's a good buy. Yes, they should be releasing these on Blu-ray. Not sure what the holdup is. And yes we've bought these before, but my previous collection (and other customers copies so I hear) didn't work so well. With this collection, every disc plays great. And since I was planning on buying Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein anyway, this is definitely the smarter buy.

And here's a news flash...not everyone ran out and bought the last release of the Legacy Collection. So if you've checked the prices of those releases, the previous Dracula Legacy Collection is currently going for $40-$60 on amazon.",1409875200,62,3118,5.072265625

Not much needs to be said about this set other than the later movies aren't nearly so effective.  But if you're wondering about why my title line says 7 movies versus the advertised 6?  Its because there is an extra 7th movie included as a bonus featurethe Spanish version of Dracula which is the same movie script as the English version but with Spanish actors.  While basically the same movie there are still several differences, especially in style, between the movies and the Spanish version should be considered as a separate movie IMO.  Completely fascinating, as so many of the special features and history for these movies are.  If you have the Frankenstein set then only 4 of these movies will be new to you as there is a great amount of crossover between the sets.  And if Daughter and Son of Dracula fall well below your hopes just wait until you get to crossover classic House of Frankenstein and the almost bonkers zaniness of House of Dracula.
