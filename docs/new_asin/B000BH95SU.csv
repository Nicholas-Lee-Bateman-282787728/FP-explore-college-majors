8086825,5,B000BH95SU,"I bought this workout about 6 years ago. It is primarily the only yoga I do. I've tried other work outs but they are either not hard enough or not peaceful enough. This is fairly good workout yet you find an inner peace in doing it. At 50 years old I can still do wheel position with one leg in the air. My 18 year old son is now hooked on this video as well and he is not able to do wheel with one leg raised just yet. It took me two years of doing this work out consistently before I could but that's why I love this tape, because it is challenging yet she is very encouraging. Keep doing the tape and not only will you find a mental and physical calm that stays with you day in and day out, you'll also tone and shape your muscles. I love, love, love it!!!",1392422400,,759,3.903225806451613
8086826,4,B000BH95SU,"I really enjoy this DVD, which I access through my membership at yogalearningcenter.com (it seems not to be commercially available yet). It's a great short yoga workout that really warms up your muscles and loosens you up. Plus, I have noticed that my arms are much stronger since I started doing it. I give it five stars for the workout choreography.

Several reviews I've seen question Beth Shaw's form in this workout - and I am not a yoga expert, but I too wonder about the way she's demonstrating some of the poses.

So, I'd say this is a great video for people who know what they're doing, but beginners should start with something else first.",1129161600,16,649,4.586206896551724
