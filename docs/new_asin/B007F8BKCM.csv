We felt so relaxed and uplifted after seeing this video and listening to the narriator along with it. Fluid, smooth, poetry in synchronized motion. We highly recommended!",1346630400,27,331,5.64
5080457,1,B007F8BKCM,"Earth Songs (2012) - (Narrated By Michael York - Actor), (Directed by Brian Luke Seaward - Expert in stress management, mind-body-spirit healing) is the most succinct argument against doing what may have been intended to be an inspirational voice-over in an otherwise visually breathtaking production I've seen recently.  I'm writing this as I'm almost done watching the program on 'mute'.  I frankly couldn't take the insipid palaver.  For about two minutes at the beginning, I was hoping the pap-y-talk would change to something informative or smarm-free.  It didn't.

Here's proof that a fairly accomplished actor with a British inflection can't actually keep up with stunning cinematography when trying too hard to say grammatically correct but meaningless, flowery verbiage.  The attempt to sound poetic is pathetic.  This production is the 'nature' equivalent of the Roman Polansky film Tess (1979) - Gorgeously shot, lifeless, bland, and numbingly tedious.  You find yourself wishing that something would happen.  It doesn't, but Michael York drones on relentlessly anyway.

If you're considering watching this production, let alone buying it, I'd recommend you find something interesting to watch instead.  That way you won't miss the good parts due to having your head snap back, swallowing your tongue, and dying a horrible death from the verbal anesthesia in this production.",1345248000,4,1386,5.490566037735849

5080463,5,B007F8BKCM,"I am 62 years old, an admirer of Kant and being of an innately spiritual ethos and meditative animation, have travelled to most of these very scenes of natural beauty, et al (like the Swiss and Austrian alps, and Lake Louise with its surrounding mountains and glacier being three favorites). A spectacular panoply of the majesty of mountains and water. I thought that I'd seen it all, but accompanied with the engrossing and transcendental, soothing, thought provoking, contemplative narration and poetry, this viewing experience is almost better than the real thing... Many, many times, around the world, I have sat at and hiked these awe inspiring vistas and searched for a similar narration of my own (only occasionally this successfully)... Having these words, now, to go with the natural awe that one feels in the presence of these uniquely divine creations of nature is a little like gaining the perspective and wisdom of old age and looking back on the parade of thrilling spectacles of one's youth... Viewed in the stillness of pre-dawn, 4AM equanimity, watching & listening to this DVD is an awesome unparalleled experience. I look forward to repeating and reliving this calming meditation many times in the future as I seek a respite from the stress and banality of modern life and a refreshing renewal from the archives of my youthful travels.

5080482,5,B007F8BKCM,"""With an open heart, mind and an open road as wide as our Beautiful Earth, Brian Luke Seaward invites us all to join him in the calling of ""Earth Songs."" A stunning visual, lush, and colorful landscape awaits us as we enter the magical realm of Mother Nature at her finest in ""Earth Songs"". Brian Luke Seaward has captured the essence of nature with his documentary, and in doing so, captivates each soul; bringing an awareness of their own unique reflection and place in the glories of our natural world.

Here we witness animals in their natural habitat, vibrant landscapes, powerful seascapes, lands far away from the ever present ""fast-track"" modern society. The ""ego""
is left far behind, and we are given an opportunity to relax, find peace and presence within the music, the narration, and the lush beauty in front of our eyes. Acclaimed British actor, Michael York brings his very thoughtful and reflective manner and voice in his narration; which is also accompanied by Academy award winning composer Brian Keane. Other artists lending their talents to this project include Michael Hoppe, Secret Garden, Keola Beamer, Zach Bergen, Min Tze Wu and Nigel Holton.

Luke has spent a number of years traveling the world, finding spectacular places for the heart and mind to film for this beautiful documentary. I am very happy to say that I purchased a number of copies in 2009, for myself, my family and friends. I am thrilled to see it on PBS stations; it is very well researched, photographed, and edited in such a manner that brings a great measure of relaxation, peace, and awareness of our precios earth.

Included in the dvd are extra features that have not been previously mentioned in the reviews. There is a meditation video, a journals dialogue from Luke that includes
information about the making of Earth Songs, and there is also an Earth Songs movie trailer.

I find nothing boring or bland about it, and there is NOT ONE MEASURE of truth to the fact it is filmed in black and white.

I give it my highest rating and recommend it viewing for everyone, and purchasing and sharing...

My response to this visual and audio masterpiece (in my opinion) was a total surprise to me!!!  I was instantly drawn in for the total 90 minutes!! Unheard of for me!!! I became so very relaxed and let go of everything about me, tangible and intangible. I went to bed soon after watching this movie and don't recall even a little bit of getting into bed.  I guess I fell asleep immediately. Another first for me!!
I saw this on PBS and have now purchased several copies to give out to friends and family.  When we let go of everything and allow ourselves to be drawn in to such a lovely piece of art, we truly can feel and experience what this work is about.
Thank you so much to all the people responsible for making this beautiful, beautiful masterpiece.  Thank you for your patience in the making of it.

5080485,1,B007F8BKCM,"Beautiful pictures and then downhill from there. Bland, boring, insipid, droning and meaningless narration. And if the accompanying music was played at a funeral I think the deceased would even get stressed out. I could take Earth Songs for only ten minutes before turing it to mute.

What really aggravates me is that my local PBS station played this as a Fund Raiser. But at least I didn't buy it.

I think the title should be changed to ""Earth Song - How to introduce stress""",1354320000,3,478,4.6117647058823525
5080486,2,B007F8BKCM,"To start off, I didn't actually purchase the film from Amazon; I happened to have watched about half of it when PBS was broadcasting it (today, actually), and I'm writing the review from that perspective. But in regards to the whole movie, I'm going to extrapolate from the 30 minutes that I was able to watch. Correct me if the first half of the movie does not happen to be the same as the part that I watched.

But getting back on topic, there's two distinct qualities of this film: visuals and narration. As another reviewer has already said, this film is filled with absolutely GORGEOUS visuals, but also repetitive, cliche, empty phrases. Nature, indeed, is amazingly beautiful; it can work wonders on the mind. But constantly saying that ""nature will heal you"" in just about 20 different ways will NOT emphasize the fact that nature is amazingly beautiful. Instead, it does the opposite; instead of reflecting on the wonders of nature in solitude (and with a calm mind), the audience is forced to hear the narrator repeat general, almost meaningless phrases. So in regards to the narration, it's just...wow. I can't really describe it. It tries to be spiritual, but instead of offering a relatable perspective of individual people, it just constantly goes on talking about how ""nature is a healing force, and it will mend your body and soul"".

To make it worse, it quotes various figures (of whose authority I do not dispute) but not HENRY DAVID THOREAU, the American philosopher whose writing matches EXACTLY with the subject at hand. If you didn't know, he went out to live at a place called Walden Pond for several years, attempting to find a deeper connection to God and himself through nature; he ended up writing a book of the same title about it (Walden), and ended up as one of the most prominent thinkers of his time. This movie, however, does not quote Thoreau AT ALL (from the half hour that I was watching it). Disregard this comment if Thoreau was indeed included, but why in the world would you not include Thoreau? If you want to make the narration sound spiritual, at least give it some authority. Thoreau's writing reached essentially the same conclusion as the one stated in the movie, BUT HE HAD YEARS OF THINKING AND LOGIC BEHIND HIS CONCLUSIONS. This movie, however, does NOT have ANY of the thinking and logic; it just continually states how ""nature will heal you"".

So in the end, if you ever get this movie, please do yourself and click the mute button. I mean, it's not bad to the point where you'll faint hearing it; it's bearable, in my opinion (and the narrator has quite a quality voice/accent). But to be honest, it would be much better if the viewers listened to an occasional line from the narrator and some music for the rest of the film. LESS IS MORE, and in this case, the narration could do A LOT MORE by saying A LOT LESS.",1354320000,2,2865,4.6358267716535435

8515556,4,B007F8BKCM,"After reading the mixed reviews of this program, I wanted to test it out for myself. Since I have Prime, I decided it was worth $1.99 to have access to it for a week to see if I want to buy it. My decision is not to buy it. Although it definitely has some of the most spectacular scenery I've ever seen, I felt it would have been so much better with just a few simple changes. I agree with some of the reviews that the narration gets annoying. I felt there was too much talking and not enough nature sounds. At least there are a few sections of silence. Some nature videos have options where you can choose to have no narration and even just nature sounds instead of music. This feature would have made a huge difference. I felt the music was well done, but I just would have enjoyed hearing the sound of the water and a few more birds. Another thing they could have improved is not repeating the scenery. It is truly incredible, but it just seemed unnecessary to show so many scenes more than once when they were filming in such incredible places. Even just a different angle of the same scene would have been better than the exact same scene. There were also a few scenes with people, and I like to just be able to concentrate on nature. One more minor complaint- they included some underwater scenery which I felt was totally underwhelming. If they had filmed some sea turtles and manta rays, that would have been awesome. All that being said, it you're looking for incredible scenery of mountains, oceans, waterfalls, and a cool falling star, along with some nice wildlife shots, this definitely delivers. You can always hit the mute button and play your own music!",1462406400,,1669,4.457516339869281
