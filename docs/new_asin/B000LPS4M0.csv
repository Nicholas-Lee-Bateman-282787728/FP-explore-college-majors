8163370,4,B000LPS4M0,It was very enlightening we do not understand their struggles. Looks like we tried to help but failed to get them the support that was need.,1463270400,,140,4.423076923076923

8163372,5,B000LPS4M0,Unique look from a medical family's perspective on how to help the people of Afghanistan. This husband and wife doctor team is seen in various locations working with their patients with little to no professional support as their daughter films them. Well directed with unforgettable stories of the will to survive. Inspiring and intense.,1456617600,,337,5.2592592592592595
8163373,4,B000LPS4M0,I ordered the film while serving as a nurse in Afghanistan. The film depicts some of the huge problems the Afghanis face with women's health in particular. The film is very interesting...could have been a little better done but it does show what is going on in the country in turmoil.,1384819200,,284,4.588235294117647
8163374,5,B000LPS4M0,"I use this film in my classes to show how women have had to deal with medical issues in Afghanistan through the time of the Taliban and war.  It's a very humbling view of what women have to endure, especially when pregnant, and you learn about the high death rates of women in birth and babies for the very reasons the Taliban has created...no women doctors and women not being able to go to male doctors.",1359676800,,405,4.328947368421052
8163375,5,B000LPS4M0,"One in Seven Afghan women die in childbirth.  An Afghan doctor struggles to make a difference.

Dr. Mojadidi, a specialist in women's health, decides to return to his war-ravaged homeland to help rebuild and modernize the hospitals and clinics which serve the women of Afghanistan.  Motherland Afghanistan is an inspiring portrait of dedication and fortitude in some of the most harsh and unforgiving physical, political and cultural terrains on Earth.

CAC's Comments:  In Afghanistan, if you wanted to have surgery you must pre-purchase your own suture material and gauze at a pharmacy before going to the hospital.  Not much is provided for you and the same goes for medicines.  After International donations and non-profit funding, certain Afghan hospitals have had the opportunity to modernize their standards and health codes.",1246924800,3,832,5.403100775193798
8163376,5,B000LPS4M0,"I'm very interested in Afghanistan and I would love to help them medically someday. I was so excited to see this movie, and I was NOT let down. It showed the issues in Afghanistan so well and it showed how much this doctor truly is helping the country. This is a great movie",1243641600,3,274,4.188679245283019
8163377,5,B000LPS4M0,"Sedika Mojadidi presents a great documentary on her father's work as a ob/gyn in Afghanistan in 2003. Graphic, empathetic, beautifully filmed, as true today as then. Afghanistan has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world. This documentary helps us understand why.",1239062400,3,281,5.409090909090909
8163378,5,B000LPS4M0,"this is a very well-made and quite moving documentary about an afghani doctor and his family who return after many years in the u.s.a. to help out in the post-taliban era...........the only thing i can complain about is that instead of afghani musicians doing the soundtrack they have used westerners, but they're not offensive.... there is, however, a brief song by a hazara rubab player....the doctor reminds me of the iraqi journalist in ""control room"", doing his best in a very difficult situation....",1211414400,5,505,5.096385542168675
8163379,5,B000LPS4M0,"I watched this movie tonight and I'm sure I'll never forget it.  This is the real world, real people, real problems.  Dr. Mojadidi is an interesting character himself, and we see him leave his lovely comfortable home in the U.S. to travel to a poor, dusty land to help a few Afghani patients and to teach the determined Afghani doctors.  You'll watch a lot of it and say Wow.  Very human, with a mixture of strength and love and misery and hope.  Thank you, Ms. Mojadidi, for introducing the world to your father.  He is an inspiration.",1177718400,9,536,4.474226804123711
