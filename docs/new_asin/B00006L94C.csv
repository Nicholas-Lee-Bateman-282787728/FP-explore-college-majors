1783863,1,B00006L94C,"To sum up the plot - a bunch of passengers on an airplane get attacked by giant size scorpions which were the results of genetic experimentation. How they got on board? Well, duh...they were regular size at first and then just suddenly grew when their containers are knocked over during the trip! There was nothing scary about the film. The creatures looked so obviously fake...like out of a 50s movie. There weren't any surprises. Even the writing is just predictable and boring. And, I didn't feel compassion towards any of the characters...everything about the film is just a waste. I'm glad I only rented it. Whoever decided Madonna's ""Swept Away"" was the worst movie has obviously not checked out some of the releases on the Blockbuster shelves.",1048377600,,750,4.913385826771654
7971110,1,B00006L94C,"I probably ordered this vhs back in 2004 for the first time and never gotten it, don't know what happened cuz i never contacted the seller or did anything about it cuz i was real young and was rearly knew on amazon. Years later i ordered it again only on dvd cuz i was getting alot of the movies i had on tape to disc. In all tho i really enjoyed this movie and had fun watching it since i didn't have the chance before. I like scorpion's and think they should make more horror films of them. Great buy that is going on nine years now.",1509235200,,535,4.009345794392523

7971112,5,B00006L94C,We love the horror of the movie and the drama. We love to watch it and we would show it to our friends,1375315200,,102,3.4782608695652173
7971113,5,B00006L94C,Get it and be prepared to laugh until you cry. This movie is so bad its almost hard to watch!,1209081600,,93,3.7
7971114,3,B00006L94C,"I'm pretty sure the creators of ""Tail Sting"" were well aware they were making a turkey.  I mean, who could have written this script with a straight face?  And those obviously fake scorpion puppets?  Just the icing on the cake!

Aside from the God awful credit sequence that had me feeling carsick, ""Tail Sting"" is a lot of fun.  Just as long as you go into it with the right attitude.  Don't expect a tense high tech thriller, in other words.",1099008000,,442,4.395061728395062
7971115,5,B00006L94C,"When a crate of genetically-created scorpions are transported from an Australian research center to an American pharmaceutical company, the insects are accidentally exposed to unrefined air and their thyroids respond by creating fast-working growth chromosomes.

Soon, the scorpions have grown into dangerous mutant arachnids. Crippling the aircraft, they attack the crew and passengers and knock out the communications system while the Queen scorpion forces the flight crew from the cockpit. As the airplane cruises blindly in autopilot over the icy Atlantic, the control tower loses contact with them altogether...

As time runs out, land is still far away. Don't be so quick to fasten your seatbelt!

A fascinating, intriguing story.",1097971200,,736,5.672727272727273
7971116,1,B00006L94C,"TAIL STING is without a doubt the worst movie I've ever viewed.  Even though it had me laughing several times, it is still an abominable excuse for film-making.  The actors (?) are all bad---Christian Scott as the James Brolin clone and Laura Putney as the heroes are hilariously awful.  Putney pops her eyes a lot, and tilts her head in a supposedly sexy manner; her outfit when she becomes the Sigourney Weaver of awful movies, has got to be seen to be believed.  The plane must be huge to allow such a large queen scorpion ramble around.  The fight scenes look kindergartenish (although a good fight by a couple of 3 year olds could outclass these!).  The special effects are laughably horrid; the computer geeks are unbelievably bad...the director loves zeroing in on their flying fingers, although you can tell they're not really typing anything; the camera never even pans to show you what they're finding.  The plane lands in LAX, and there's not another plane or soul around...anyone who's been to LAX knows this could never happen.
I'm a creature feature fan, but this one isn't even worth viewing for a laugh.  Awful, awful waste of celluloid and time.  No redeeming qualities at all!!!!
And what's worse is it looks like many of the actors voices were dubbed!!!!!
AVOID AT ALL COSTS.",1071878400,,1294,4.766816143497758
7971117,3,B00006L94C,"In one of the special features, we here the director talk about what is needed to make a successful creature feature.  You need a really good script, you need to screen test the creatures, you need really good characters, etc.  Apparently he learned all of this AFTER making this film.
Genetically mutated scorpions are released on an overseas airliner.  They almost immediately turn into giants.  They then proceed to crawl about all of the secret passageways (huh?) including the ones in the ceiling.  I don't know how a 15-foot scorpion made it into the cockpit without anyone noticing, but that was only one of the bits of silliness.
The plane changes models in the film and has a cargo bay the size of a small warehouse (and anyone can get into it).  There are only about twenty passengers, most of them laughable cliches.  The scientists refer to the scorpions as insects (yeah, right) and the scorps even have a queen.
Really bad acting, bad sets (one of a cabin with enough open floor space to hold a dance party), and worse monsters make you think the film should have arisen from the days of black and white B-movies.  But its modern!
This movie is bad, but the over-the-top characters actually make it kind of fun.  A good film for when you want a little turkey.",1062460800,,1273,4.622222222222222
7971118,2,B00006L94C,"I read about this on a bad movies website, and it seems there has been a resurgence of killer-creature flix. The story was an interesting idea, geneticall-modified scorpions causing havoc on an airliner, but when the creatures became GIANT RUBBER ONES, I was in hysterics. The SFX here could have been done better by a two-year old. Continuity gaffes galore - Melbourne in New South Wales, Australia(???), the plane was a 737 on takeoff but became a Tristar in mid-flight(with the interiors of a 747 and a larger cargo hold which the passengers had easy access to. There was even a subplot of two asylum seekers who became the heroes of the day saving the airliner and a chance to make utterly racist jokes at their expense; the girl who messed up the team's chance to be world champions making good, a mad scientist out for profit from the GM scorpions and basically I did not care a jot who lived or died. The script is right out of a bad Nu Image killer-animal production or a grade Z 1950s SF flick; and this ranks as one of the worst airplane movies since HORROR AT 37000 FEET(1972). However, if awful movies are your thing for a right good laugh, this may be for you. I can safely say it is at least funny, perhaps funnier than many so called comedies released in the same year;",1056844800,,1284,4.468085106382978
7971119,1,B00006L94C,"Have you ever heard of the saying never judge a book by its cover? Well I sure judged TAIL STING by its cover, the movie looks good on the cover, but bad when watching it! A bunch of people go on some flight (hmmmm just like stephen king's the langoilers!) Where some scorpions get into, people spill some .... all over the floor and the scorpions get bigger, all of this movie was computerized, the scorpions don't look like scorpions, so I give you all these reasons to not rent, no, to even stare at the cover of ""Tail Sting""",1056499200,,528,4.29
