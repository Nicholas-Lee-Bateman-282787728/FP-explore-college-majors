8088730,1,B000BM7Z1O,"Not worth the purchase. Very little useful info and some of the talent can barely articulate a coherent sentence. Not to take away from their talents on the guitar, just the inability to verbally explain. For some one considering this item there are much better tutorials available.",1431388800,,282,5.0212765957446805
