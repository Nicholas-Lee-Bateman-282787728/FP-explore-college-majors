7998813,2,B0000CBXZ2,"I was very disappointed in this movie. The charecter was not someone I could relate to. He had wierd hair and piercings. You don't really see people walking around like that in the Heights. The only good thing I could say is that the acting as pretty good but this movie was not my taste. I do give props to any Dominican out there doing there thing, I'm not trying to hate on you. But I have  to say I didn't like the movie at all.",1100822400,3,432,4.023255813953488

To sum it up, the main character, Eddie has dreams of illustrating comic books, and gets a shot at is, but he also has obligations to his father, and that is keeping him from focusing on his dreams.  Being from a traditional family, you see how Eddie is forced to weigh both family and career obligations.  I can't forget the scene of  Eddie grudgingly changing the diaper of his injured father.  He hates doing it, but he is loyal to his family, so he deals with it.
The acting could have been better.  I don't hold that against ""Washington Heights"" as it is an idie film from a young producer on a limited budget.  The scenes of the Washington Heights neighborhood in New York are very vivid and accurate.",1078790400,5,735,4.407407407407407
