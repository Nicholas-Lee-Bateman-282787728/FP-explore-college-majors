7912379,5,B00000JGEV,"I really enjoyed watching this story of a Beautiful, full of life, ball of energy. No wonder she was called the ""IT"" Girl, she had it all, from humble beginnings to all hell that small minded people could through at her, looks money ..etc. Anyone who likes movies or the Hollywood legends will adore this story !!",1042502400,3,313,4.508771929824562
7912380,4,B00000JGEV,"Clara Bow was a vivacious, beautifu example of flaming youth in the twenties--the ""It Girl"" was a sensation, a truly great sex symbol who still has a contemporary quality even when viewing her films from long ago.  Yet, as this documentary so poignantly illustrates, Bow's life, in spite of her great popularity, was no bed of roses.  Misfortune was her earliest companion, and the shadows of poverty and abuse were always close at hand.  As narrated with real feeling and restraint by Courtney Love, we learn how Bow rose above these stumbling blocks to become one of Hollywood's biggest stars in the Twenties, only to have her private life once again sabotage her efforts at finding happiness.  This is a very touching film that is a fitting tribute to one of Hollywood's silent icons.",970185600,7,787,4.850746268656716
7912381,3,B00000JGEV,"Though by no means ground breaking, this is an overdue re-examination of what is described as Hollywood's first sex symbol.  With a personal history more complex and tragic than better known icons ranging from Marilyn Monroe  to Jean Harlow, it is amazing that Bow is not better remembered. The  narration by Courtney Love, who no doubt shares more than a few things in  common with the subjet, is worth noting.  She brings real emotion to the  voice over without going over the top.",946598400,20,483,4.759036144578313
