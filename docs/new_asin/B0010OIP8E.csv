8238102,3,B0010OIP8E,"I haven't yet watched the main disc, Sunshine Boys, which is a remake of an old Matthau/Burns film.  Most viewers seem to feel there's just no way Woody Allen and Peter Falk are the right fit for the parts.  However I just watched London Suite, the ""bonus disc"" in this 2-disc set, and for the extra $3.00 (compared to getting Sunshine Boys by itself) I think it's gotta be a great deal.
This is a movie based on a Neal Simon play about various couples who check into a London hotel adjacent to Hyde Park.  First couple you see has Michael Richards (best known as Kramer in the Seinfeld TV series) and his wife arriving to watch tennis at Wimbledon.  Richards is more or less being Kramer, with a different name and a little bit more sophistication.  He loses his Wimbledon tickets and throws out his back and ends up on the floor of the hotel suite staring at the ceiling.  Next up: Julia Louis-Dreyfus, aka Elaine in the Seinfeld series.  She's newlywed and she & husband got inebriated on the flight over, got in a big fight and went in different directions, so she doesn't know if she's spending her honeymoon alone or not.  Julia is more or less acting her usual as well, so it's starting to look like a Seinfeld reunion here.  Julia's character & her interactions I thought had many of the funniest scenes in this show.  Third: Madeline Kahn, a widow, and her daughter who tries to fix her up with a wealthy but quirky Scottsman they've met on the plane.  Madeline is more subdued in this film and now that she's gone--gee it's nice to see her one last time.  She's still funny, and so is the quirky Scottsman too.  Last comes Kelsey Grammar (of the Frasier TV series) and his ex-wife in a bittersweet reunion.  He's bisexual and she's still in love with him and..I don't want to give it all away.  Neal Simon seems to have a relentlessly optimistic view of the world.  The comedy is basically harmless, the actors and actresses are good, as long as you don't look for anything very deep there are laughs to be had and I had a really pleasant 90 minutes for only $3.00!  Can't go far wrong with this...",1237766400,,2108,4.433766233766233
