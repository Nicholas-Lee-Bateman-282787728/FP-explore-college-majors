8015348,5,B0001N5QKK,"""The Art of Health with Gary Null"" is a pleasure to watch and provides practical, easy-to-follow guidance on healthy living.  Gary shows the viewer just how simple it is to eat better, live better, and feel better.  The DVDs are extremely easy to navigate and the entire package is first-rate.
