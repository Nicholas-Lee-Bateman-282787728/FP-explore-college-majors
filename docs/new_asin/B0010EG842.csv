Note: I did not buy this from Amazon so I am not a verified purchaser. The prices gouge for the book & dvd here on Amazon and I am not sure why. That's unfortunate because this system will be overlooked if one just seeks Amazon for a cheaper price. I highly suggest buying directly from the source website.

This is absolutely wonderful. Your life will definitely change with Dr Larry Nims. He is relaxing, soothing. I have dealt with a few crippling anxiety issues by his methods in a short period of time.

By no means is this a fast process, but some of the techniques will immediately and profoundly change the way you act, behave and react to the world -- on a subconscious level.

Two tips  from me related to BSFF -- I am an adult college student:

  1. I have made 3 x 5 cards, which are randomly put into any deck of flash cards while I am studying to ease test anxiety and help commit things to memory without negative thinking.
  2. I have made 'notes' in my phone that I can pull up at anytime, anywhere, when a situation arises that can be neutralized by BSFF.

Again, highly recommend that you buy the book / DVD from the source:http://www.besetfreefast.com/dvd.html
You will save a ton of money!! And the website itself, BeSetFreeFast.com, has a lot of interesting free resources and videos to get you started.",1409097600,,1401,4.4980237154150196
8237752,4,B0010EG842,"I bought my dvd in 2006 and it is still one of the best-produced therapeutic training dvds I have seen. It is not for the casual self-helper, as it goes into depth about Dr. Nims's journey. You get a great idea about how Dr. Nims works with the method with clients, because there are 8 full sessions in it. There is a love of video to watch to get through it all, but it is amazing to see how rapidly the method works to resolve emotional issues. If you are a fan of EFT, this an even faster method that goes right to the subconscious source of the problem without beating --or tapping-- around the bush. In fact, there is no tapping at all!",1403049600,,641,4.17741935483871
