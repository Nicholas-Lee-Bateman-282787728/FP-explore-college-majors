8327804,3,B001NRRVBK,"Another excellent lesson by Steve Trovato. This lesson consists of a 12-bar blues in the key of E. It's not a tune that Scotty Moore actually played, but rather an instrumental composed by Trovato in the style of Scotty Moore that highlights a lot of his classic licks. It kind of resembles ""Mystery Train"" which seems to be the quintessential Scotty Moore-tune. In this lesson Trovato caters to the absolute beginner, going even so far as to explain the fingering of the first position B7-chord which seems kind of odd since the whole tune is certainly not something that a guitar novice would normally learn in the first three months of his career. Anyway, Trovato breaks down the piece in a lot a digestable chunks which makes learning real easy.

My only concern with this DVD is that it comes without a tab booklet, neither in printed form nor on the DVD. At first I went to their webite, assuming that a tab could at least be downloaded from there, but to no avail. On the other hand, the piece written by Trovato is a pretty straightforward blues in E, played up and down the neck. The split-screen allows to monitor closely what Trovato is doing, so maybe tabs aren't all that necessary in this case. It's annoying nonetheless.

All in all: While I recommend this DVD because Trovato does a great job, I can't give it five stars due to the lack of tabs.",1465776000,,1361,4.551020408163265
8327805,3,B001NRRVBK,"The good first: The instructor breaks down the material into parts and plays several times slow, and in real speed. He seems to be a fine player. Watching him you will learn Scotty Moore type rockabilly. He shows finger picking and pick style real well. The bad: I wish he would have supplied tabs or some kind of documentation. The backing tracks do not exist, and the website mentioned is a pay website, you do not get it with the DVD.",1303776000,6,437,4.407407407407407
