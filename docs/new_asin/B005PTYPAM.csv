4857614,5,B005PTYPAM,Love this series. All the qualities u could want in a man and he alway gets the bad guy and keeps the peace in Dodge. James Harness is amazingly fast with a gun. Wish you could actually be sure about what's going on between Matt and Kitty behind closed doors....it will always be a mystery.,1485734400,,290,4.290909090909091
4857615,5,B005PTYPAM,Great collection! Bought this for my dad who watches the show everyday on tv. This set is the first series to come out so they don't air them on tv as often. He has viewed many episodes off these videos that he's never seen before.,1485129600,,231,4.155555555555556
4857616,2,B005PTYPAM,"The discs stop far too frequently and resume at intermittent times. I bought every episode you sell with the intent of watching the entire series tat you have ( which for some reason stop at Season 12.

The joy has been ruined by a very poor quality control. It really makes the whole series unwatchable. I want a complete replacement st of all the series one through 12 that is not so shoddy. Even if you have to have a human watch the whole set to be sure it really works.

I am extremely dissapointed you would send out a product with no quality control. Whoever provided you with this needs to be dropped fro your supply list.

Look at my account and see how much I have bought. If this is not rectified immediately and not with money I will pass the word that you are not to be trusted.",1484956800,6,791,4.225165562913907

Amazing what we missed when we could only see Gunsmoke over low quality broadcast television with all those fuzzy horizontal lines. But Gunsmoke was still good back then.  These are good quality DVDs that reveal more detail than what we missed on the TV Boob Tube: where you can renew your laughs at good ole' Chester; see what was then INCREDIBLY revealing Miss Kitty (Meow!), and; hope and pray you'll never have to ""come see"" Doc Adams!

Our nation's cops and law abiding citizens should take a survival lesson from Marshall Dillon: ""Forget getting Pepper Sprayed, Forget getting Tazered: Draw on me and I'll bury you on Boot Hill!""

Thank God we still can share these more ethical and conservative series with our children and grandchildren (especially ""Gunsmoke"") because the crappy and immoral series they have on now are helping to lead this nation to a Sodom and Gomorrah-type Wrath from God.

Stay Safe,

8482703,5,B005PTYPAM,Great television!  I never saw these episodes because I was too young when they were released in the 50's. Just as good as the later color episodes.,1524441600,,148,4.481481481481482

8482705,5,B005PTYPAM,The first five years of a western series that lasted on TV for twenty years from 1955 to 1975. Season 1 to 5 were from 1955 to 1960. An interesting adult western with engaging characters. Gunsmoke was a radio show in the late 40's and early 50's. I notice that some of the TV episodes came from the radio scripts.,1519776000,,313,4.233333333333333

8482708,5,B005PTYPAM,"I will note there are no subtitles or any at least that I can figure about how to turn on... Caught some flack for that I guess but the picture quality is spot on. If CC is a deal breaker for you don't buy but other than that it is a great product. Reading that 2 star review someone left is funny if you want to take a look. I don't know anything about this show but all I had to do was google how many seasons there where to know this set was not selling every episode ever before i bought it... LOL get rekt, 2 star reviewer",1514160000,,527,3.8440366972477062
