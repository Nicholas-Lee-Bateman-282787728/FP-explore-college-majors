8732665,5,B015508EXY,"In these ""perilous"" days, the Duke reminds us why we HAVE armed forces.  The drawback/feature of the packaging is that all three discs are stacked on a single spindle.  Now, if only they could have found a way to connect ""McClintock"" to these three features, I wouldn't need another John Wayne collection (Just kidding). Luckily you don't need to wade through all those ""coming soon to DVD"" prequels with this collection.",1504569600,,421,4.915492957746479
