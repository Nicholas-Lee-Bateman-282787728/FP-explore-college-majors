8315620,3,B001KP2YC6,"My 18 month old loves Noddy. I can barely stand it, mostly because of the gaudy computer animation. But the kid loves it, and the stories are fairly harmless. At least this collection gives me some new episodes to watch. There are old stop-motion Noddy episodes on YouTube that are much better, but you can't get those on DVD here in the U.S.

Thankfully the kid seems to be moving on to Toy Story and Thomas the Tank Engine.",1296518400,2,425,4.379746835443038
