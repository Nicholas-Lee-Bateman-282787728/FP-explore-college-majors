722148,4,630386001X,"Well, the script needed a little help. In many places it was rather corny, but oh well. I don't think that most people view these types of films for the literary experience. The action at the end of the movie is worth the  price of the video. A good final shoot-out. I always feel better after  watching this scene. It's good for venting. Arnie takes them all out in a  fierce gun battle. Rather excilerating.",945907200,18,409,4.426666666666667

Somebody loaded Arnies cigar with a cigarette load, and ruined about  2  hours film time. Movie( 1- 10 ) = 4.  Arnies temper with the blow up =  15.

722255,5,630386001X,"I guess there's quite a bit in this movie that a serious movie critic might dump on, but I like this movie a lot nonetheless. Arnold was not a great actor at this point in his career or at any other point, though he did get better. But he was a great movie star, a great action star specifically. He's fun to watch and makes every scene that he's in entertaining. But he's not carrying this movie alone by any means. He gets a lot of good help here. This movie is packed with good character actors that were at the top of their game when this movie was made. Anyone with more than a bit part did good work.

I would bet that this was a fun movie to make. It's definitely a fun one to watch. I especially liked the relationship between Arnold and the oh so lovely Kathryn Harrold, including their nod to Casablanca at the end.",1501804800,,825,4.15625

722536,3,630386001X,"Arnold Schwarzenegger goes undercover to infiltrate the mob in Chicago.  This would have been a vastly different movie if it had starred Roy Scheider, Christopher Walken (director John Irvin's lead in The Dogs of War) or even actual Italian Sylvester Stallone--Arnold can't seem to help reducing whatever is happening to camp whenever he opens his mouth--I feel genuinely bad for director John Irvin watching this since he's handicapped by such a grossly miscast star and because The Dogs of War is a personal favorite.

Still, Raw Deal is a fairly solid and efficient crime flick even with Arnold Schwarzenegger in the lead--the story is pretty good, the direction tight with (mostly) believable human-scaled action scenes, the use of actual Chicago locations provides a nice contrast to New York and Los Angeles settings.  Everyone other than Arnold is pretty well cast--this is definitely above average but it had the elements to be a gritty 1970's style crime film with a less ridiculous lead.  Instead Raw Deal is mostly pretty silly but director John Irvin never lets it slip completely into cartoon like Commando or The Running Man--which is either noble or a serious miscalculation depending on your opinion of Commando and The Running Man.",1435968000,,1248,5.1330049261083746

722620,2,630386001X,"U.K. Distributor Optimum home entertainment has released RAW DEAL on blu-ray
for some reason RAW DEAL has not been given a U.S. blu-ray release yet
Universal studios own the DVD rights of the film so hopefully one day Universal will release a blu-ray version
with new making of featurette's
apart from a new HD transfer of the film of this new U.K. blu-ray, there's also some new special features added aswell
the old DVD release was barebones, had just the Theatrical trailer
so i bought this new blu-ray out of curiosity reasons
and i tell you what it was waste of money
first of all this U.K. blu-ray says region B on back cover, i played the Disc anyway on my region A player
and to my surprise the Disc does play region A so the Disc is ALL REGIONS
so obviously the region B print is wrong, incorrect
secondly the special features are pointless and boring
the first featurette ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER-THE MAN WHO RAISED HOLLYWOOD only goes for 15mins
all it is are new interviews with some of the film Directors & film Producers that have worked with Arnold that's all, nothing special
the Directors that have been interviewed just give comments on Arnold as a person, as an Actor and other aspects of
Arnold's personality
i thought this featurette would be about the making of Raw Deal, i was wrong for sure
the featurette is pointless, ridiculous idea by Optimum home ent'

the 2nd featurette RAW DEAL- A GENERIC GANGSTER film
is just a 6min interview with Arnold's biographer who gives his opinions on the film Raw Deal. boring & pointless

i was very Disapointed and Disgusted, no new interview with Director John irvin or Producer Martha schumacher
or any of the other Actors from the film
the only thing Good about this blu-ray release is the new HD transfer of the picture quality in 2:35:1 widescreen
very sharp & clear picture quality for sure not much Grain at all, ofcourse better than the old release
and the sound quality has been boosted with a new 5.1 Master audio mix again better than the old DVD release

the only thing worthwhile about this new blu-ray is the new HD transfer and new sound mix, that's it
the extras are totally pointless & waste of viewing
the movie is excellent deserves 5 stars
this blu-ray is only worth 2 stars",1422835200,8,2253,4.613466334164588

722684,4,630386001X,"This review is NOT of the A. Schwarzenegger 'vehicle"" Raw Deal, in particular.  It is just a personal 'opinion' regarding my 'complaint' regarding how certain VHS tape manufacturers have decided to 'duplicate' a given movie in the 'EP' mode.  A lot of professional people spent a lot of their money, time and professional efforts to create and assemble a quality product.  Regardless of whether a given viewer has 'moral' objections to the fictional events of this movie, and they have every right to do so, when you watch this movie, of your own 'free' will, you can't complain that there is too much sex, obscene language or violence to be seen or heard.  People who pay their hard-earned' money to see a movie, regardless of the film's rating, its title, the actors, the director, or ANY other aspect, deserve to get high-quality audio and video, in the product they are watching.  I previously purchased this title, from another Amazon seller, who did not mention in their web site that their VHS tape was 'duplicated' at the EP mode'.  These words were specifically printed on the reverse side of the tape's box, in small but very visible print.  Had I known this before I decided to buy it.... I would most certainly have decided NOT to buy it that very same reason.  I'm a collector of movies, both VHS and more recently DVD, for the ease of use and storage and other reasons relating to audio and video quality.  I gave this product 4 of 5 stars.  Generally speaking, I don't give five stars to ANY movie, with the exception of those movies in my 'top ten'.  ""Raw Deal"" fits nicely, somewhere, in my top 100.  I have urged Amazon, on numerous occasions, to give serious consideration to my suggestion that anyone who sells VHS tapes make certain that they include, among the other notes the recording speed of their movie, documentary, etc., so the prospective buyer can make a more-informed decision as to whether or not to go ahead and buy it.  Don't let t hem find out later, and be very disappointed and frustrated.  When Amazon allows sellers to avoid relating this important piece of information, they are, in effect' creating a problem that should not exist and can easily be avoided.  They must share the 'black-eye' responsibility with the seller.  It took me a whole 2 seconds to realize the 'problem' I was in for, just as soon as I took the tape out of the hard-paper box in which the tape was housed.
As for the movie, itself.... This movie is, in my opinion, a vehicle.  That means, it was 'tailored' for its stars acting abilities.  Movies like Total Recall, Predator and Terminator both 1 and II,  are tailored around his well-known, well-worn persona.
If you like AS's previous performances in the aforementioned movies, if you like plenty of action and adventure, explosions galore and a significant 'body count'.... you won't be disappointed, here.

722728,5,630386001X,"There are a lot of great things about watching b and writing reviews. When you've been in the game for as long as the old boy Sid added perks pop up from time to time. One of the best is when you're enjoying the first 20-30 minutes of a flick so much that you  just can't believe it hasn't been reviewed before. If you believe that rascal, google, the first time you're a fool my friend. But this was a rare gem. This was Arnold in his prime in 1986. You've got my attention for 90 minutes all day if for nothing else than the chance to hear a couple soundboard lines. I swear if Arnold did books on tape I'd never listen to music again. There has never been anything more pleasing to the human ear than that perfect voice.

In No Deal, Arnold plays a disgraced FBI agent who was demoted to small town sheriff because he beat the heck out of some sickie. In the first 10 minutes Arne brings it with ""and LYING to the sheriff"" after busting a street tough. Later that night he goes home and his wife is being a supafreak. She looks like she's wearing a prom dress baking a cake which spawns ""you shouldn't drink and bake."" Arnold wanted a dream girl, went to sleep and had a nightmare. She tried to give Arnold cake for dinner and frankly was lucky to make it out of that alive. Meanwhile, a mafia informant is being guarded by a bunch of FBI guys in a tiny shack. The mob boss who was being informed on sent guys to break up their party and kill the informant. One of the FBI agents was the son of Harry Shannon, a big shot with the FBI. He was played by none other than Darren McGavin. Don't be surprised to see Sid go on a McGavin run. He was awesome in a serious role. B awesome. McGavin needs to avenge his son's death so he calls Arnold. ""What's going on Harry? It's been a long time."" Naturally Arnold fakes his own death and goes after the mob boss's organization.

This was a very typical b  80s action movie that happened to star one of the 10 best actors to ever live. It's usually going to be enough for 5 cans if Arnold is in it, and standard bad b plots and dialogue never hurt. His completely unrealistic relationship with the female lead carried the last half of the movie. She was super dtf and Arnold was like I'm married. I think once you fake your own death all bets are off. The end of this one was like the grand finale of a magnificent fireworks show. McGavin gets shot in the final shootout with the mob and can't walk. Arnold shows up at the hospital and McGavin was yelling at the nurse and Arnold saying ""I can't walk!"" But all I heard was ""not a finga!"" Finally he walks and him and Arnold had a sexy time right there right there. Words really can't do it justice.",1405900800,,2691,4.1692307692307695

Whenever I see it i want to go out and buy like an old plymouth convertible and pop in the tape and then like, not go drive by shooting but maybe do something like go to burger king or maybe even sonic. on bike night. i probably won't go to a quarry and start wasting -- some of the most cliche'd bad guys you will ever see -- bad guys.",1398470400,,610,4.091666666666667

They start blabbering about his life, what he did before becoming an actor, his nationality, etc. It is true he plays on it and relishes keeping some kind of Germanic accent. But that is more a decision of the director and producer than of the actor. Why do they keep that hard Germanic accent? You better ask them because there is no reason to do so in the film. Is that actor unable to make his English more fluent? But that is a side detail.

The value of the film is quite somewhere else. It is in the plot of the film, the story the film is telling and altogether it is telling us the system in which we are living, and that means the world because there is nothing beyond  that geographical zone called the USA, Miami, Chicago, New York, the system and the world are sick but the evil forces are inside: inside the country with the gangs that are refusing any law; inside the local police with finks, traitors, rotten cops, and the film start with the spectacular arrest of one deputy sheriff by the sheriff of the small place where it all starts; inside the FBI where you have the same situation with rotten agents, when it is not fake agents sent by the gangs.

The film is trying to tell us that the only way to keep these gangs in line is to do the same thing and infiltrate the gangs to destroy them from inside by turning them one against the other and killing all of the gangsters when they start having a gang war: when they are too busy killing one another, just come behind and kill them all. The most difficult part of course is to keep the infiltration secret and the infiltrator unknown, till the last minute and leave behind no witness who could speak.

It is this conviction that danger is human, is inside human society itself, has to be fought inside that society with the same means criminals use, and that this fight pays and this danger can be controlled. That makes this film an interesting film because it does not alienate the audience into some puppets dancing at the end of threads of violence. There is the hope that there always will be one good one to fight back.

The Rear speakers was used most in the action scenes. The other times they was used was mainly for music. You could hear them active in a scene where many people was playing some games.

His acting was still a work in progress (as was his ease with the English-speaking starring roles), but this is one of those movies that delivers a ""Saturday afternoon / Saturday night"" payoff every time. It's a ""go-to"" movie. There's mob violence and lots of things blowin' up real good (hat-tip to Joe Flaherty and the late, great John Candy).

The film also contains one of the greatest action film scenes of all, in which Arnold shoots out / kicks out the windshield of his big ol' Detroit gas-guzzler, pops in a cassette of The Rolling Stones' ""Satisfaction,"" and heads right into the thick of things, blowing bad guy after bad guy away. He drives straight into the gunfire, straight into the belly of the beast, and in the best action movie manner, walks away with hardly a scratch.

The mob guys are absolute cartoon mob guys, but that's half the fun. Anyone coming to this film looking for the work of a Francis Ford Coppola or Martin Scorsese is in for a real crash-landing of expectations. Actors Paul Shenar (as goon #1, ""Paulo Rocca"") and the great Robert Davi (as goon #2, ""Max Keller"") add the appropriate levels of henchmen smarm, and Sam Wanamaker's mob boss ""Luigi Patrovita"" is obviously cut from Gotti cloth.

Veteran actor Darren McGavin delivers a serviceable performance as ""Chief Harry Shannon,"" but I've got to wonder whether his heart was really in this performance. I'd love to read an interview in which he discusses whether he enjoyed playing the role or not. I have my doubts. He never really ""owns"" the character.

You've seen movies labeled as ""mindless fun,"" and this is certainly one of them, but in a 5-star toss some popcorn in the microwave kind of way.

Mr. S plays an ex-FBI agent who had to retire for various Dirty Harry-esque actions/brutality.  His old boss' son, who has become a mob informant, is whacked while in hiding, so the FBI chief brings Arnie out of retirement 'unofficially' to whoop some serious 80s hiney.  It's sort of like Death Wish 3, with the cops (or FBI) hiring a professional to clean up the town.  This time it's Chicago, which had more than its fair share of 80s shoot em ups and would of course re-welcome Arnold in Red Heat two years later.

What follows is the big guy infilitrating the Chicago Outfit, which features some reliable character actors like Robert Davi and even Sosa from Scarface, who looks like bizarro Sam Neil and this time plays an Italian, not a Cuban.  What difference does it make?  Eventually, Arnold blows his cover, some other stuff happens, and a lot of people get blown away, some publicly.

The climax is kind of like the Tech Noir scene from The Terminator, except this time Arnie is the good guy, and whole lot more liquor and glass get wasted as inept mobsters are shot to pieces.  At one point, there's a shootout from about three feet away.  Guess who wins?

Completely dependable shoot-em-up for a slow night, full of 80s staples like the 'getting geared up for battle scene' (featuring guns being assembled, loaded, cocked, and holstered in a scene begging for theoretical analysis of male adequacy), as well 'humorous' scenes with Arnold in what was already an attempt to explore his 'range' as an actor.

Some more quality one liners, a memorable use of the Stones' 'Satisfaction', some guys getting shot and falling from great heights, a guy getting shot at a cemetary, the requisite public car chase, and other niceties.

No, RAW DEAL isn't one of the Governator's best flicks, not by a long shot. But it's not his worst either (ever cringe thru JINGLE ALL THE WAY, JUNIOR, or COLLATERAL DAMAGE?). Having been released on the heels of the high octane, vastly entertaining COMMANDO, RAW DEAL suffers from the inevitable comparison. This film does have quite a bit to offer Schwarzenegger fans, but, let's be real, it's not as good as COMMANDO. But is RAW DEAL worth watching? Definitely. Is it worth purchasing? I believe so. I bought it. But, then again, I'm an old fan of our muscled Austrian. Shucks, I even voted for him.

As early as 1986 - when RAW DEAL came out - at the beginnings of his Hollywood career as he was still developing what would become his trademark cinematic identity, Schwarzenegger was even then charismatic enough to turn many an action fan's head. That he had a certain flair for droll one-liners was an unlooked-for bonus. In fact, I believe that his wry sense of humor and the implied intelligence that went with that was the decider in making him the overwhelming box office action king over the likes of Stallone, Seagal, and Norris. And Arnold was savvy enought to capitalize on his advantage. He had a firm grasp of his talents and rarely stepped outside his purview. In his role of Sheriff Mark Kaminsky, Arnold is well within his limited acting range. RAW DEAL makes no pretense about what it is: a slam-bang action movie that directly traverses from Point A to Point B and is jam-packed with auto carnage, blazing bullets and thudding fists, all the while showcasing Mr. ""I'll Be Back"" (a catchphrase which I don't think he says in this film).

The plot: Mark Kaminsky (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is an ex-FBI agent now exiled into sheriffing in a small, nowhere town and saddled with an embittered wife. A promise of possible reinstatement from an old FBI colleague with a personal agenda convinces Kaminsky to infiltrate the Chicago crime syndicate and try to tear it apart from within; if possible, he's given the added task of unearthing the mole who's been selling out the FBI. Kaminsky stages his own death, slicks back his hair, and dons his double-breasted threads. In his attempt to get noticed by the mob, he makes a splashy showing at a mob gambling joint and, from there, rapidly works his way up the criminal hierarchy, occasionally tearing off chunks of mafia flesh.

Is there much violence in RAW DEAL? You bet your arse, there is. Nowadays, when our film action stars all seem to practice fancy martial arts, popping in an Arnold flick in a dvd player is a bit like time travelling to the primitive, old school ways of villain smiting. Arnold never was that limber nor did he ever somersault in the air and execute a graceful roundhouse kick to the head. His style is akin to a relentless runaway train as he uses his monumental strength and power to subdue his opponents via wrestling holds and throws and that gool ol' American standby: the punch to the face. And if he can't hit you or kick you, for sure he doesn't have any compunctions about shooting you up full of lead. And then, of course, he'll submit the coup de gras: a witty punchline at your expense. In RAW DEAL, he uses his ""techniques"" to traumatize villains in mall clothing stores, gambling casinos, gravel pits, and mafia headquarters, the last venue being where he really launches into Terminator mode. You see, in his own fashion, Arnold does have a certain implacable panache.

The acting? It's decent. Schwarzenegger is Schwarzenegger which means that Schwarzenegger isn't Anthony Hopkins. In terms of acting, Schwarzenegger isn't even Thelma Hopkins. But, here, he's ably upheld by his supporting cast, the most recognizable of whom are Darren McGavin, MURPHY BROWN's Joe Regalbuto, and the ever untrustworthy Robert Davi. Kathryn Harrold is so-so as the love interest (and, mind you, she's not the wife), actually shining for a moment in a restaurant scene with Arnold as she takes him to task for his lack of amorousness. And, yes, this movie drops one of my favorite Arnold wisecracks: As his unhappy, intoxicated wife heaves a cake at him, his character retorts: ""You should not drink and bake."" Classic. Another line overheard in passing which cracked me up: as Kaminsky and Davi's character were pursuing a man thru a crowded bar, an offended, bumped-into bystander comments with a ""Hey, you cretin!"" C'mon, who says that, really?",1173571200,2,4457,4.820915032679738

Raw Deal is the latter. Taken in a slightly different direction (and with an entirely different cast) the script might produce something dark, gripping, and ultimately rewarding. But watching John Irving's vision of Raw Deal is rewarding in its own way - lots and lots of unintentional laughs, not to mention a seemingly never-ending clatter of empty shell casings. If you like Ah-nuld pre- ""Eraser,"" when his characters were given more leeway to act like, well, a muscle-bound Austrian playing the John Wayne role without a hint of shame, Raw Deal is an outstanding film.

As I said before, the plot could have been believable, but there's no real concern with reality here, and that works in the film's favor. The current Governor of California is a small-town sheriff in an unhappy marriage, having been removed from ""The Agency"" (gamely represented here by a super frumpy Darrin McGavin as some kind of rogue FBI boss named Shannon). Well, wouldn't you know it, Arnie's former boss loses a son to gangsters. To quote Mayor Quimby , ""Those wacky gangsters. What're ya gonna do?"" Well, Shannon decides to enlist the Terminator off the books to terminate those wacky gangsters.

But the termination comes not in the ""Commando"" mold of seek-and-destroy, but in possibly the least logical way possible - Mr. Schwartzenegger goes undercover in the Chicago mob. I'm no organized crime expert, but I somehow get the sense that the mob, whether Italian, Chinese, or Russian, tends to recruit from within. Walk-ons must be extremely suspect, especially if they look like escapees from WWE Raw (or the WWF, during the time this film was shot). But the mob honchos accept him with open arms, and the rest of the film is Arnold knocking the mob down piece by piece from the inside.

The film really shines in its cartoony portrayal of gun violence, where more rounds are fired per scene than in a comparable day in Iraq. Sometimes the bullets hit, and then get ready for mobsters falling off of cranes, mobsters falling down stairs, and mobsters blowing up inside their cars. My absolute favorite moment of the film comes towards the end. Arnold has just wasted an entire room of baddies, and is setting off in pursuit of the main bad guy. The main bad guy leaves one poor schmoe, let's call him `Gangster #37' at the staircase. Gangster #37 fumbles with his weapon and says something like ""Bring it on! I'm going to go crazy and kill you!"" Arnold just walks around the corner and wastes him. Well, at least Gangster #37's heart was in the right place.

So, if you like Arnold, and you like the idea of the mob getting its comeuppance in a hail of gunfire, check out Raw Deal. You won't be disappointed.",1117324800,17,2945,4.870259481037924

The script, directing, action, and so forth are pretty routine for an 80's action movie, but good 'ol Arnold's magnetic charm keeps Raw Deal rolling even when it seems it's about to fall apart.  The cast also includes longtime Law & Order vet Steven Hill, and most of the rest of the cast is pretty forgettable.

723085,4,630386001X,"John Irvin directed this standard mob-action film that had a decent plot and good action sequences.  Not one of Arnold's best movies but certainly above average compared to the many flops he contributed to over the years as an action star.

The film is a standard mob-action plot where Schwarzenegger plays Joseph Brenner, a former FBI agent who lost his job and whose son was killed by mobsters.  Brenner now works as a sheriff in some rural town and is approached by an old FBI pal named Max Keller (Robert Davi) who comes to him with an offer to reinstate him into the FBI if he helps bring down two big mafia leaders named Patrovita (Sam Wannamaker) and Rocca (Paul Shenar): the same leaders who were responsible for killing his son.  Going undercover, Joseph Brenner gets the mobsters to fight each other until the final showdown.

I don't understand why other reviewers have such a low opinion of this film: it's actually quite good.  In my mind, there are many other Arnold films that would fall into the below-average category of 2 or less stars long before this one; films such as 'Commando', 'Conan the Destroyer', and 'Red Sonja', to name a few.  If anyone thinks that 'Raw Deal' is on par or lower in quality than the latter films, then they should really study some film basics before writing any more reviews.

In conclusion, I think this is one of Arnold's better movies and is worthy of either purchase or rental.  It has a decent screenplay with a good script as well as good action sequences.  Check it out!",1093305600,6,1525,4.614814814814815
723086,2,630386001X,"A simple plot about an ex-FBI officer forced by an old friend to infiltrate a Mob who murdered his son. Definitley not Arnie's best but it does have the odd good scene where his driving a convertable and shooting people at the same time while listening to the Rolling Stones ""Satisfaction"" but it was really corny how his car was riddled with bullets and didn't even get a flesh wound and of course he shot everyone. There wasn't many beautiful women in it and I think I prefer the shootout scene at the end of ""Commando"" to this. But I think he played his character reasonably well.",1092873600,,583,4.457943925233645
723087,4,630386001X,"In a time when the man with the biggest machine gun ruled the box office, Arnold Schwarzenegger was an unquestionable heavyweight amongst action stars. Following his success with the Conan films and ""The Terminator"", Ah-nuld signed on to do this crime thriller with director John Irvin. This one isn't one of his more well-known titles but is still ""too cool for school"". Not exactly one of the smartest action films ever released, what ""Deal"" lacks in brains, it makes up for in bullets.
Schwarzenegger is Mark Kaminsky, a former FBI big shot who is exiled to the role of local sheriff in a quiet Southern town. When an old friend's son is murdered by Mafia goons, Mark is called in to take down the bad guys in typical Schwarzenegger fashion. Faking his own death and re-emerging in Chicago under the assumed identity of an ex-con, Kaminsky infiltrates the mob organization and takes them down with an arsenal of awesome firepower. From taking down a mob foe in a car chase to driving a confiscated cement truck through an underground casino, Arnold gets to have plenty of fun while kicking his usual butt.
""Raw Deal"" is a little bit longer than it should be and is overly talky at times but there are some solid moments to be had here. Any movie that has Arnold blasting his way through a gravel pit to the sounds of The Rolling Stones' ""Satisfaction"" can't be all bad. The musical score was one of my favorites at the time that I saw it and the supporting cast including Darren McGavin, Paul Shenar, Robert Davi, and Ed Lauter are all exceptionally talented and equally underrated. While far from a box office hit or even one of his most noteworthy flicks, ""Raw Deal"" is a bad-ass little movie that is actually very underrated in my opinion. It's never gonna get the kind of love as Arnie blockbusters like ""The Terminator"" and ""Predator"" but it's still worth the price of admission for any true action fan looking for some bullet-riddled fun on a Saturday night. Anyone looking to buy on VHS, may want to avoid the full-screen Video Treasures release as some copies contain the TV edit.",1087689600,6,2091,4.669376693766938

In general, a film isn't necessarily good because it has AS in it. Its usually great because it is directed by James Cameron (T1, T2, True Lies) , Ivan Reitman (Twins, Kindergarten Cop), or John Tiernan (Predator, Last Action Hero). The rest of Arnold's movies are generally video fare of varying quality, and this film specifically should be destroyed.",1052265600,4,617,4.5675675675675675

723091,2,630386001X,"The plot is a typical for a Schwarzenegger flick,though not original at all, yet Schwarzenegger was not the actor this movie needed. Arnold's character is attempting to infiltrate a mafia syndicate.  A friend's son was killed by these people and he wants revenge so he asks Arnold's character to help him seek revenge(he's to old to do it otherwise he would do it himself).  Arnold's acting in this one is terrible. None of the other actors stood out so well either although I did recognize the guy from the show Profiler. Arnold has a couple one liners that gave me a laugh but seriously much of his acting just doesn't cut it at all. Him attempting to be a suave mafia dude is hard to watch.
The movie goes along way to slow and is very predictable. The action scenes are TERRIBLE. Commando looks realistic compared to Raw Deal's action scenes.  At one point Arnold's character is driving around a construction yard in a car shooting people twenty to thirty feet above him while his car is going going up and down constantly--he's also steering with his other hand.  He never misses, they never hit,a nd he's hold the guy like a toy.  There isn't even some any good looking girls in the movie. I'm a big Schwarzenegger fan, unlike some of the other reviewers here, and have see all his movies. This one doesn't cut it at all. I would recommend you check out Red Heat or Commando for some non-Terminator Schwarzenegger action.  Or maybe my favorite, Predator.",993945600,,1460,4.617760617760617

""This elderly Arnold flick never really picks up until the end.  I don't want to spoil it for you, but most of the film is boring until the action packed end!  That's where the three stars come in!  So fast forward those VCR/DVD players to the last fifteen minutes, and you'll be guaranteed an action packed, explosive ending sequence!""- MJV & the Movies.",993600000,,579,4.702970297029703

With strange echoes of the later 'Eraser', Arnie is an  FBI agent, and once you have stopped laughing and accepted this you can pay  attention to the rest of the film, which is essentially a mid-80's 'war  against drugs' telefilm but with more gunplay. And Arnold Schwarzenegger.  It's not much fun to watch (a bit like 'Eraser' again, actually), and you'd  be better off with 'Commando'.",966816000,,623,4.876190476190477

The film was made in 1986 when Arnold was 32 years younger, In the story, he was dismissed from the FBI about five years before the events of this film. He spent his time as a sheriff in a small town and his wife was board stiff.
The head of a Chicago gang killed an informer and the people guarding him, one of whom was a friend of Arnold, and a power in the FBI. He wanted revenge. He knew that there was someone in the FBI who worked with the criminals. So he requested Arnold to take revenge on the Chicago mob for him without telling anyone. He was to infiltrate the mob and destroy them. The problem was that only he and Arnold would know that he was not a real mob member.
