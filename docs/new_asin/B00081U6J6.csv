2256937,5,B00081U6J6,"First, before anybody gets offended, remember when watching this show you have to suspend disbelief.  It's so full of it and over the top it's hillarious.  At times it can be a little brief, a few episodes are just a couple of skits and some boring filler, but for the most part there was at least one or two really good laughs per episode and at this price, that's pretty darn good.

You can read other reviews for what the show is about, but the short version is it's a guy's fantasy land where the hosts get to do pranks and tell jokes while chugging drinks.  It's just a genuinely fun program.  Too bad Joe ""Fear Factor"" Rogan and some other dim commedian were the ones to take up the reigns a couple seasons later.  Seasons 1-4 were just lighthearted fun, but after those two got a hold of it it became just plain gross and disgusting.  I'd highly recommend this set.  Even my wife liked the show and she barely likes anything I watch.",1145145600,3,940,4.331428571428572
2256938,5,B00081U6J6,"The Man Show is, by far, the greatest show ever to grace the face of television.  Its perfect balance of fart humor and bouncing, well-endowed girls is the perfect match for any dinner party.  If you thought Mary Tyler Moore was a great show, just wait until you see The Man Show.",1130112000,5,280,4.365384615384615
