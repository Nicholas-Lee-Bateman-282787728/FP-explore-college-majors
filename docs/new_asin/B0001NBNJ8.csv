2019962,4,B0001NBNJ8,"This is a wonderful collection for those who care only about seeing their favorite Frasier episodes or the ones they missed. Hands down, Frasier is the wittiest, most imaginative sitcom since the Dick Van Dyke show. Only the brilliant, much-missed MST3K made me laugh out loud as consistently. I own Frasier Seasons One through Three, and even though I love watching my favorite episodes a second or third time, the extras are disappointing. The Bulldog featurette and the Maris extras on this Season Three set are snooze-worthy. Why rehash the same material that's on the disc? We fans want behind-the-scenes footage, rehearsal footage, bloopers, deleted scenes, etc. We want to see John Mahoney flub his lines and crack everyone up! And we all know that Moose is hardly a one-take dawg. I'm sure the producers have plenty of outtake reels hanging around. More commentary, outtakes, bloopers, deleted scenes, please, for Season Four!!! Please listen to your fans, Kelsey!",1088640000,39,972,5.158227848101266
2019963,4,B0001NBNJ8,"Huge fans of Cheers and Frasier were really into the latter sitcom as the 1995-96 season began,which was its third. Keep up the great character,Frasier!",1087516800,4,152,5.12
2019964,5,B0001NBNJ8,"First of all, let's get a few things straight. ""The Simpsons"", ""Seinfeld"", M*A*S*H"", ""Cheers"", ""All in the Family"", etc. are all great landmark tv shows worthy of being called brilliant and some of the all-time greats. But there is no doubt that ""Frasier"" (1993-2004) is the most consistenly funny and brilliant sitcom in American TV history. The writing, acting, direction are all top-notch and reached their first creative peak with seasons 2&3. This set is ESSENTIAL for ""Frasier"" fans or anyone who wants to watch some of the best comedy writing of this century (not an exaggeration). Five consecutive Emmys speaks volumes of all this, but I cannot praise this show enough. I mean I love all the above named shows a lot, but once you've seen them 2 or 3 times they lose their value and laugh-out-loud quality (except for ""Seinfeld""). ""Frasier"" on the other hand is timeless, and the episodes from this season can be watched over and over and over again 200 years from now and people will still be laughing because of the quality of writing and direction of this series. As far as international TV is concerned, I consider ""Frasier"" to be to the USA what ""Black Adder"", ""Fawlty Towers"" or ""Only Fools and Horses"" is to the UK, i.e. the best show the country has ever produced. I recommend getting seasons 1-2 first and then immediately purchasing this one. Trust me you will not be dissapointed. Long live the Cranes!!!",1086912000,12,1422,4.784552845528455
2019965,5,B0001NBNJ8,"Never mind people telling you something different about this show...Frasier is one of the best comedy series of all times. It is really hilarous, witty and a great family-and-friends portrait of modern life with its ups and downs. But most of all, the cast is superb. You really get to care about this people and their mutual relationships, like Daphne and Niles for instance. So then,I suggest we heed Dr Crane when he says ""lets live for the little joys and surprises that life can afford us"" and drink in this marvelous work of enjoyment. Don't you agree?",1085961600,6,558,4.704081632653061
2019966,5,B0001NBNJ8,"Frasier's season finale marks the start of a new era in the life of Dr. Crane.  Remember, he didn't re-marry or settle on a new career...there's much more to come.  It's possible Frasier's headed for Roz's small Wisconsin hometown to settle down, then retire in Hawai'i (Act 4).  Can you imagine the comedic episodes, Frasier's upper-class style adapting to rural farm-town life?...maybe never, but years of great material.
I bought season three.  No regrets.  Side-splitting humor redux.

2019967,5,B0001NBNJ8,"Frasier marked the end of the shows that thrived on quick wit and the constant juggle versus the occasional belly laugh.  This collection is some of the best of the series and another reminder of an era that is started out with the likes of the Cosby Show, Night Court, Cheers and now is sadly coming to an end.",1085529600,13,311,4.271186440677966
2019968,3,B0001NBNJ8,"The premises for the episodes aren't as good. We don't really need to see relationships overlapping between Roz and Niles and Frasier and Daphne. That's just the typical thing to do. That's why I hate Friends. But, there are some good episodes in there. Ray Liotta, one of the most underrated actors ever, is a guest voice. So, it's all good. I'd get season one if I wasn't completely broke.",1085443200,3,391,4.6
2019969,4,B0001NBNJ8,"Season three of ""Frasier"" didn't hit as many comic highs the series achieved in season two - the brothers don't let their egos destroy restaurants, for example. Instead, in these 24 episodes, we get the kind of acerbically funny, occasionally hilarious character comedy that we came to expect from the show. Niles, who in this season leaves Maris, finds his attraction to caretaker Daphne (Jane Leeves) intensifying, especially in the episode ""Moon Dance,"" in which two two dance at a society bash. Meanwhile, Frasier (Kelsey Grammer) has a prolonged fling with his boss (Mercedes Ruehl). In one memorable episode - ""The Adventures of Bad Boy and Dirty Girl,"" the two accidentally broadcast their tryst. Frasier also has a close encounter with Diane Chambers (Shelley Long), who left him at the altar in ""Cheers."" (The episode, ""The Show Where Diane Comes Back,"" features a classic ""Cheers"" spoof.) The shows frequently shun cheap laughs to build to a riotous conclusion. The extras are going downhill from the earlier collections.",1085356800,27,1031,5.179640718562874
2019970,5,B0001NBNJ8,"Frasier is so well written, it is witty and clever! I have ordered all three from the UK because they take forever to be released in the UK.",1084147200,2,140,4.035714285714286

2019992,5,B0001NBNJ8,"It's just laugh out loud fun.  I love the season 2  The Candidate episode. Same for 2 Episode 17, Daphne's Room .  I dare anyone not to laugh at those-too funny!!!
Other good ones:
Roz in the doghouse Episode 12  .
Season 9-6 Room full of heroes. Season 10 Episode 6 on the Bar Mitzvah is fun
All Season 11 is fun.  Just when you would think it would get old , it just gets better. . Such good writing as well as timing!
In one episode it's Martin's birthday and when he blows out the candle all lights go out in the town (blackout)-Frazier cracks they do not have to worry about his dad's lung capacity.
Has to be one of the best spin-offs ever as all the Cheers cast return episodes are fun as well.
I don't watch with the little kiddies but it's fun when I'm ready to go to sleep-- humor to send me off to sleep laughing and smiling  :-) Thanks Frasier Team",1491004800,,860,4.089285714285714

2020061,5,B0001NBNJ8,I have always loved this show. I never realized how gifted Kelsey Grammer was until I binge watched season after season. The characters of Niles and Frasier were a perfect match in any situation. The writers gave them brilliant scripts but the quirks and mannerisms of each character were defined by the actors. Every episode brings a laugh.,1483315200,,341,4.896551724137931

Frasier could screw up a million dollar date with Miss America, but the supporting cast is always able to bail him out.

2020864,5,B0001NBNJ8,"As a former reviewer put it ""Frasier is still (and ALWAYS will) be in the building"" for me.  If you can't laugh at this comedy, there is not a funny bone in your body.  I didn't get into the Frasier sitcom until season #5 Beware of Greeks.  When he did that little dance ditty and his aunt started chasing him around that restaurant, I was hooked!  The cast of characters play so well off one another.  Each hold their own when one or the other is absent from a particular episode.  Season #3 has most of the episodes I like from his entire series although all are enjoyable to watch.  This sitcom actually had me going back to watch Cheer's episodes, which are incorporated into this sitcom's structure.  It is enchanting and sophisticated: adult enough to where you are entertained and can pick up on the naughtiness, clean enough for family viewing with a younger audience.  Highly recommended viewing and Season #5 is pretty tempting for me to purchase just for the Beware of Greeks episode.  Enjoy!",1428710400,2,1003,4.6158192090395485

2021108,5,B0001NBNJ8,"Frasier is my favorite tv show. It is almost the only one I watch. I don't like the ""sexual"" humor of the actual. It is much harder to make humor without falling in vulgarity.",1402617600,,175,4.176470588235294
2021109,5,B0001NBNJ8,"Frasier is the most sophisticated humor on TV - yesterday, now and forever. Sometimes I watch these episodes several times and each time I pick up a little nuance I had missed the last time. This kind of humor is not spoon-fed - it makes you think and pay attention. And it requires a healthy frame of reference to appreciate it.

In Season 3 I especially appreciated ""She's the Boss,"" ""A Word to the Wise Guy"" and ""Look Before you Leap.""

Great entertainment. Love each one of the cast.",1402358400,,487,4.46067415730337

2021118,5,B0001NBNJ8,"The writing for this series is superlative. The cameos are played by pure professionals. But the character of Frazier is slowly sinking into the setting sun as it becomes ever more evident that the character needs psychiatric help. He is incapable of forming a lasting relationship with anyone. He interfers with the lives of others, at the most intimate levels, and when the walls of Jericho come crashing down on his head he is.... sorry! Well, Frazier's sorry is not intended for the victims of his folly but are meant to sooth his own troubled soul. Who are my two favorite characters? Niles and Roz! Niles is that meek, weak kneed little child slowly growing into manhood and without a doubt, Roz is a man in a woman's body!",1398384000,,729,4.658914728682171

2021123,5,B0001NBNJ8,"I think the reason that Frasier has always been my favorite show is that the humor is intelligent and subtle. You have to understand the inner-workings of the character's personalities in order to really appreciate the show. This season is no exception. They are all great. Buy one and then buy them all. They are all really  that good. But especially the early seasons (1-4), they are my favorite.",1395014400,,398,4.768115942028985

2021131,5,B0001NBNJ8,"I love the show, so funny.  The characters are great together and I love Eddie.  From what I have read, there are several Jack Russells who play that role over time, but they are all very cute.",1390953600,,193,4.1891891891891895
2021132,5,B0001NBNJ8,More of the first two seasons' antics with Martin holding down the fort amidst his smart but harebrained sons. Supporting cast is pretty good even when the characters are a bit one-dimensional.,1390867200,,193,5.0625

2021134,5,B0001NBNJ8,I love this show! The chemistry that the actors have with each other is amazing to see. The quips throughout the series never get old. I have seen every episode at least a dozen times each and I am unable to get burned out from the show. The timing of the quips are beyond perfect. I love the idea that the character Frasirr is a genius however every scheme he does backfired is some way leading in the comedic plots. The character Mr. Crane could not have been played by any other actor John Mahoney as he brings a blue collar effect to the show. David Hyde Pierce potrays Nile's Crane with absolute precision allowing the two characters Frasier and Niles to bounce each other's quips smoothly and naturally.,1390348800,,709,4.503875968992248

2021143,4,B0001NBNJ8,This was the season that they found their grove and became a real timeless tv classic. Very funny and smart humor. This was when the characters really came alive and we got to see the how the interaction between the brothers could become some of the best dialog on television.,1389139200,,276,4.54
2021144,5,B0001NBNJ8,A great way to spend an evening. Laughter is good for the soul.  We will watch the entire series thanks Amazon,1388275200,,110,4.238095238095238

2021147,4,B0001NBNJ8,Watching Frasier in the past week to week made me laugh then and I still find the series humorous. When I need to laugh out loud I will watch 1-2-or 3 episodes at a time. It is not everyone's sense of humor but is for me sometimes. If you like to laugh give it a chance.,1387584000,,270,3.8392857142857144

2021149,5,B0001NBNJ8,"Frasier is consistently well  written and well performed. Everyone knows their parts and they live their parts. Meaning they own it. In the whole series there are less than five episodes that I find a bit below their standards but the rest are top notch and hard to match. Anyone who loved his character on cheers will love watching the evolution of the character on this series. 11 seasons hardly seem enough. This is my second time buying this set, as the new sets have a single dvd case (hard case) and it fits on my shelf better and is well protected. It's definitely a series worth keeping and sharing.",1387152000,,607,4.5181818181818185

2021151,5,B0001NBNJ8,I happen to love Frasier! But i admit i like the earlier seasons better. Before they gave daphne a eating disorder and frasier stars dating the blonde witch. Not that most of the women he dates couldn't be described that way. But overall its a great show and this was a great season!,1385683200,,283,4.3584905660377355

If you enjoyed Frasier on Cheers, he's surrounded by a strong  (and 'lily-white' as the show jokes) supporting cast and clever writing on this show.

My rating is for the series overall - not just season 3. I dropped it one star because of a recurring problem of weak guest characters and occasionally too precious plot lines. Regarding the guest characters, the show should have taken a page from the Seinfeld book and let the guest characters be at least as funny as the main ones rather than serve them up as cardboard foils.",1377129600,,692,4.663934426229508

2021179,2,B0001NBNJ8,"The sputtering joke machine that was ""Frasier"" dies an inelegant death in Season Three as the caricatures that stand in for human beings find their joke writers flailing. Stories aren't so much developed as begun and then left to die as the vaudeville-era jokes run short. If there is any sitcom cliche that annoys you, rest assured it's here is Season Three. Not once, but REPEATEDLY. Laughs are few and far between as the cardboard characters go through motions pioneered 70 years earlier (and with much more charm) on radio. The set design is nice, saving this garbage from a one-star rating.

2021199,3,B0001NBNJ8,"Pretty annoying that when there's a multi-parter, they invariably remove some of the episodes.  Last season, at least they gave you the last episode so you could figure out what was going on because of the 'what happened last time' beginning.  This season,  ep. 6 is a 2 parter, and ep. 7 is no where to be seen, so you have no idea what will happen.  This makes watching the series frustrating.

On top of that, much of the humor comes across like a sledgehammer, but there are pieces that are suitably sublime.  Most comedy turns me off because it comes across like either they're an idiot, or they think I'm an idiot.  This at least tries, somewhat, and I'll try to continue watching for the breadcrumbs.  Sorry I'm only rating it a 3, but half the skits I wind up fast forwarding through because it's just awful.

2021203,5,B0001NBNJ8,"Having lived overseas for 18 years, I missed the entire run of ""Frasier"". Not generally a fan of spin-offs, I didn't pause long enough to watch an episode the few times I did stumble across one on TV.  I had no idea what I was missing. Since buying season 1, I have been laughing my head off.

The writing is good enough to make Shakespeare proud, but it takes excellent acting to bring comedy to life. From Kelsey himself all the way down to Eddie the dog, each performer is a master of his or her art.

Each story's focus is fairly distributed among the characters. The arc covering Niles' separation from his unseen wife, Maris, opens the door for him to get closer to Daphne, who herself has a relationship with building contractor Joe. Fortunately, we don't see much of Joe, with no explanation for his missing presence save at the beginning of one episode. Even Frasier is allowed an interlude with a new boss seen for the first half of the season. Let there be no claims of age discrimination, either. Martin has his day with a much younger woman, originally the object of Frasier's affections.

Since I am buying these DVD sets for my wife, and she only gets them on her birthday or at Christmas, it will be the end of the year before I get to watch season 4. I know it will be worth the wait.",1317600000,,1301,4.363636363636363

2021220,5,B0001NBNJ8,"The best way to enjoy Frasier is to watch every episode in order.  Season three hits the ground running, hits the series stride, and never disappoints.  The ensemble cast is excellent and you can't help but think you really are glimpsing two brothers in Seattle that happen to be psychiatrists.

A key storyline development this season comes with the slow dissolving of Niles and Maris's marriage.  This is couple with the slow evolving of the Niles and Daphne relationship.  The episode ""Moondance"" is excellent and puts a spotlight on Niles feelings for Daphne.

The episodes here are laugh out loud funny.  This season served as somewhat of a milestone for the show as it won its third straight Emmy, for its first three seasons.  This established what many of us already knew... This is one of the best series in the history of sitcoms, and possibly the best written.

2021224,5,B0001NBNJ8,"I recently discovered how hilarious and witty Frasier is and since then have been buying the seasons!  Frasier Crane is a divorced psychiatrist that hosts a radio talk show using his psychiatric abilities.  Frasier is a person who has everything in it's place and everything planned to perfection until his father (an ex-cop),Martin Crane or Marty,  moves in after being shot in the hip on the job.  They then hire a physical therapist for Marty named Daphne Moon, who is a psychic that moves into the apartment too.  Frasiers' life is turned upside down and inside out with barrels of laughs! There's also Frasier's brother, Niles Crane, whom is also a psychiatrist and Frasier's only equal.  There are loads of guest stars whether it be on the radio show as people with weird problems or in person as humorous characters come to dishevel Frasier's life even more!  You won't be able to get enough of these characters and their wacky lives as they collide together!  I highly recommend this show to anyone who needs a good gut busting laugh!",1154217600,2,1042,4.782122905027933

It is peppered with witty and urbane humour, buttered with enthralling narratives, and doused with strong characters and class.  I would reccommend sitting down to view the many episodes with a sharp little mature cheddar from New Zealand and a glass or two of a good Cabernet!

2021227,5,B0001NBNJ8,"Along with Friends and Seinfeld, Kelsey Grammer's Cheers spin-off, Frasier, dominated the prime time television landscape during the 1990's. Grammer plays the role of Dr. Frasier Crane who, fresh off of his divorce from Lilith, moves back to his hometown of Seattle where he lands a gig as a radio psychiatrist. Frasier's father, Marty Crane (John Mahoney), a Seattle cop recently shot in an attempted convenience store robbery is in need of physical therapy. Frasier and his brother Niles (David Hyde Pierce) make an effort to mend their relationship with Marty whose plaid shirts and penchant for sports and beer strikes a dramatic contrast with their wine club, opera house culture. After a little prodding, Marty and his dog Eddie (Moose) move into Frasier's upscale apartment, and Frasier hires Daphne Moon (Jane Leeves), a housekeeper and physical therapist to look after the two cranes.

The entirety of the show takes place in mostly three places - Frasier's radio station where he works with show producer Roz Doyle (Peri Gilpin), Frasier's apartment, and the favorite hangout of Niles and Frasier, Caf Nervosa. A witty comedic exploration of the nation's clash of cultures (also illustrated by Frasier's run-ins with sports guy Bob ""Bulldog"" Briscoe), Frasier stands alone as one of the best-written shows in television history. Not a single episode can be considered a dud.

The Frasier (Season 3) DVD offers a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere which heralds the arrival of a new station manager, Kate Costas (Mercedes Ruehl), with whom Frasier begins a passionate love affair. Given that Frasier is the voice of his peers in contract negotiations, the two compromise on employee salaries and agree to keep their romance a secret. One of the funniest episodes of the season (The Focus Group) centers around a superb focus group response for Frasier's show in which a lone participant, Manu (Tony Shalhoub of Monk fame), cites that he cannot stand Frasier. Consequently, Frasier badgers the man until he ruins his life...

Below is a list of episodes included on the Frasier (Season 3) DVD:

2021228,5,B0001NBNJ8,"Admittedly, while I think that Season 3 is just a cut below Season 2 (perhaps the best ever, IMHO), there's still more than enough laughs, great acting and stories to make this third season of Frasier a must for your collection.

The first ten episodes chronicle the blistering relationship between Frasier and his boss, Kate Costas (a mannered, but still very good Mercedes Ruel).  Their argueing and contempt for each other naturally leads to sparks which are detailed in the wonderful episode ""Sleeping with the Enemy"".  Their relationship ends rather whimsfully in ""It's Hard To Say Goodbye If You Won't Leave"".

Plenty of guest appearences also helped to elevate this season, especially Griffen Dunne as a wheelchair-bound, yet very annoying person who wants to be Frasier's friend (in ""The Friend""). Shelly Long reprises her ""Cheers"" character Diane Chambers in ""The Show Where Diane Comes Back"".  This episode also features a re-creation of the famous ""Cheers"" bar (done in a stage play) and Frasier and Diane finally get some closure to their relationship. ""Wings"" and future ""Monk"" star Tony Shaloub gets in one of his typical brilliant characters in ""The Focus Group"".

And let's not forget the underatted actor Harry Yulen as the guy who can ""fix things"" in ""Word to the Wiseguy"". Yulen manages to be both a little creepy, yet somehow put upon by his unseen girlfriend. A great performance and a very good episode.

Frasier's agent-from-hell Bebe makes a great appearence in ""Where There's Smoke, Their's Fired"".  Her line to Daphne (""I'll make you a star!"") is delivered with all the enthusiasm and malevolence we expect from Bebe. And Frasier's relationship with Roz is put to the test in ""Frasier Loves Roz"". My favorite little scene from that episode happens at the end when both characters are standing on opposite sides of Roz's door.  The final reaction by Frasier is both unexpected and very funny.

The highlight is the Emmy winning ""Moon Dance"". Directed by Kelsey Grammer and utilizing all the writing staff, this episode is perfectly done, hilarious, and ultimately touching as Niles confesses his love for Daphne, yet in a logical twist she misinterprets his words.  A genuine classic and perhaps the single best episode featuring these two characters.

Extras:
""The Crane Brothers Remember Season 3"" is an on-set interview (done perhaps in the last season of Frasier) of both Kelsey Grammer and David Hyde Pierce.  Most of their reflections are centered on ""Moon Dance"". A nice, if not inspired documentary.

The rest of the extras dissapoint as they are nothing but edited scenes from the third season with a lame theme (""Bulldog Crazy"" and ""The Mystery of Maris"") as well as the unnecessary ""Celebrity Callers"".

Why no bloopers is beyond me. Also missing is any ""commentary"", which would've been great on ""Moon Dance"".

Having said all that, Season 3 is still one of the best and funniest seasons of Frasier.  So if you're a fan, what are you waiting for? Go out and get it!

Trivia bits:
-  No Lilith this time out, a shame since Bebe Neuworth adds so much to the show.

- Kelsey Grammer got a major haircut before Season 3 began. A ""short style"" which he kept until the end of the series.  For some reason (probably a practical one) the episode ""You Can Go Home Again"" which features a long flashback to Frasier's first radio broadcast in Seattle has Kelsey with short hair, which is inaccurate to his character at the time.

- The episode ""Chess Pains"" implies that Frasier thinks Martin is only vaguely aware of how to play chess.  Yet in the first season, we see Martin playing chess (""Can't Buy Me Love"") in front of Frasier.

- My understanding is, though it's not mentioned in the DVDs, that Jane Leeves ad-libbed the dance bit where she put her leg on David Hyde Pierce's shoulder (which is the single most memorable visual of the episode).

- This season features guest appearences by Griffen Dunne & Linda Hamilton, both of whom were the first two celebrity callers on the pilot episode ""The Good Son"".",1108944000,13,4041,4.864233576642336
2021229,5,B0001NBNJ8,"This series just keeps getting better and better!  After some of the highs from Season 2 (The Matchmaker, The Innkeepers, etc.), I didn't think it would be possible that the next season could meet the expectations of the fans of Frasier.  However, they did with flying colors.  The thing I love most about this show is its ability to go from side-splittingly funny farce to poignancy from episode to episode.  One of my personal favorites from this season is ""High Crane Drifter,"" in which Frasier is tormented by his neighbor's loud music and everyone's basic rudeness.  I also love ""Chess Pains"", ""She's The Boss"" and ""Moon Dance"", the latter of which takes the Niles/Daphne relationship to another level (at least for Niles).  The extra features are....OK....but they aren't the reason you're buying this set in the first place!  What more do I have to say?  BUY IT!!!!",1102636800,6,872,4.884353741496598
2021230,4,B0001NBNJ8,"In a series which never had a misfire and always seemed to be at the peak of its game, ""Frasier: The Complete Third Season"" is the companion DVD box set to Seasons One and Two. It stars Kelsey Grammer as the imminent psychiatrist and radio personality, Dr. Frasier Crane, David Hyde Pierce as his even more neurotic and insecure younger brother, Niles, John Mahoney as their curmudgeon father, Martin, Jane Leeves as scatterbrain physical therapist Daphne Moon and Peri Gilpin as Frasier's calculating hard knock radio programmer, Roz.

All of the scuttlebutt and horseplay in the prior seasons culminates in what is perhaps the series greatest year of them all: Frasier's old love from ""Cheers"" - Dianne Chambers (Shelley Long) returns for a hilarious encounter, Frasier meets his new station manager, the maniacal and very demanding, Kate (Mercedes Ruehl), Maris finally kicks Niles out of the house and Martin's sensitive side is exposed when the boys discover that their father was once a songwriter who almost wrote a hit tune for Frank Sinatra. Meanwhile, both Roz and Daphne encounter their own special brand of toxic secret admirers.

Paramount's new DVD, ""Frasier: The Complete Third Season"" aptly delivers all 24 episodes of this trend setting comedy in a deluxe four disc box set. By far the picture quality on this box set is the best the series has looked on DVD so far. Colors are accurately presented with a rich palette and good contrast levels, and blacks are deep and solid, there continues to be a significant amount of edge enhancement and shimmering of fine details throughout many of the episodes but these are kept to a minimal. Though the overall quality of season three is infinitely better derived on DVD than season two, it remains a less than stellar mastering effort. The audio is stereo and very nicely balanced. Extras include a brief but succinct conversations with art director, Roy Christopher, a benign ""Bulldog Crazy"" sort of game that one has to access by toggling on the remote, short snippets that illustrate all the guest star cameo voice overs used as call-in guests and audio commentaries on selected episodes. If you're a fan of this television series you will want to snag this box set. Recommended more for the content than the presentation.",1092873600,10,2286,4.966057441253263
