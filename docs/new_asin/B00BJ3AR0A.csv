5627397,1,B00BJ3AR0A,"poor plot content, poorer animation. A taint to such a wonderful classic by Rudyard Kipling. Do yourself a favor and stay away",1384300800,,126,4.7727272727272725
5627398,1,B00BJ3AR0A,Cheap animation. Accidentally bought this one. $11 down the drain. Can't even return the video now. I wanted to buy the original Disney jungle book,1379462400,5,147,4.92
5627399,1,B00BJ3AR0A,"Cheap animation, poorly developed story. My 6 yr old watches ANYTHING and did not finish this movie. Definitely not recommended.",1378598400,9,128,5.45
5627400,2,B00BJ3AR0A,"I wasn't sure what to expect on this one, was it meant to just be a re-make, a sequel, etc.? In effect, it was a little of both, all of the characters you remember are still there but this was poorly put together. Don't waste your time or money on this one.",1371254400,6,257,3.9615384615384617

5627452,1,B00BJ3AR0A,I finally gave this to my kids after ordering it back in May. We opened the wrapping and found the disk was cracked. It's past the return window so we're stuck with garbage. I guess I need to open gifts before I give them to make sure they aren't broken??,1435536000,,255,4.12
5627453,4,B00BJ3AR0A,"The case had the sticky stuff and some paper from the previous price sticker stuck on the plastic part covering the toys. This wouldn't normally be a big deal, but I was giving it for a gift and couldn't get the sticky off either, so it looked tacky.",1427414400,,250,4.229166666666667

8569311,5,B00BJ3AR0A,"The Jungle Book is an adorable little Indian animated film based on the book by Rudyard Kipling.

The movie features the human child Mowgli, his strict but loving mentor Baloo, and his friend Bagheera. Throughout the film, Mowgli and his friends must face different dangers and situations. The main villains of the film are Shere Khan the tiger, and his devious but cowardly jackal minion Tabaqui. Other characters in the film include Kaa, Hathi, and Rikki-Tikki-Tavi. The film also has a really cute little song and dance number at the end of the movie where most of the characters are dancing.

I'm so glad this film got a western DVD release. This is a really cute and fun little movie, and I highly recommend it.",1463616000,,716,4.72
