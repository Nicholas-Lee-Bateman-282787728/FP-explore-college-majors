8327489,4,B001NOCT3S,"This was a pleasant surprise and a delightful addition to my swashbuckler library.  It brought to mind the Hammer Studios adventures, such as the excellent ""A Challenge for Robin Hood"".

This is an unusual swashbuckler, with pirate, highwayman, and masked avenger elements (albeit without the mask).  John Fraser makes a winning heroic lead, and Peter Cushing is a fine and complex villain? / antihero?  There's rousing swordplay, chases on horseback and carriage, romance, humor, and intrigue, with Cushing's squire strangely beholden to the ship-wrecker Black John (Bernard Lee), his former lackey!

The Eastmancolor Panascope (widescreen) picture is okay.  This isn't Technicolor, so the colors are muted and faded a bit, but the print quality is acceptable and the soundtrack is clear.

4.5 stars -- recommended for collectors of swashbucklers and fans of period adventure films in general.",1404432000,,894,5.481751824817518
8327490,5,B001NOCT3S,"It's a shame this isn't released in America on region one! this is as good as the Hammer movie Night Creatures which are very similar.
Cushing is great as usual and it's a fun and action packed movie. No horror mixed in like Night Creatures but that's not a horror movie
even with the skeletons riding on horses. I can't say the quality of this dvd but the movie is excellent and must have. I have had a vhs
copy and dvd copy from another collector for years so I have viewed many many times. Highly recommended.",1365292800,,512,4.288659793814433
