2826501,3,B000PMFO40,"Hi,
I agree with the other reviewer, the price is just too high for something this old.  Yes, it is a good series, but why so expensive?  What idiot sets these prices? Some greedy executive somewhere I guess.",1335571200,6,208,4.447368421052632
2826502,5,B000PMFO40,"Being a middle school teacher, I have always enjoyed historical fiction. All those who loved Downton Abbey would also enjoy Foyles War. Masterpiece Theater has produced the best actors and actresses. I have often felt that the British schools have been exemplary in their elocution lessons. Colin Firth as a king who stuttered is an example of this. American schools are negligent in that they do not teach our students correct speech. As in the play, Pygmalian, we see the philosophy of speech patterns stymying progress. Proficiency in speech enables progress in every field, especially politics.",1330560000,,598,5.239583333333333
2826503,5,B000PMFO40,"""FOYLE'S WAR: Sets 1-5"" presents British Home Front war-life through poignant topics, compelling suspense, and many mirthful moments. Masterpiece Theatre created a 6-year running (2002-2008) British mystery masterpiece. They outdid themselves. This ""War Years"" series of 19 feature-length episodes is now available as a set and thus a better price. Wow, 32 hours, of sure-to-please mystery/period drama.

It is a 1940-45 Southern England countryside experience not to be missed. It serves as a home-front view documentary of the English WWII involvement and resulting life-style of the population away from the active war front. This series begins in May, 1940 when all England expects an eminent invasion from Germany. You'll learn lots about the British WW2 home-war preparedness.

On the other hand, FOYLE'S WAR is a series of some of the best 21st century written murder mystery stories ever presented on television--or theater. An interview bonus feature with creator/writer Anthony Horowitz proves that the dual focus--mystery/period drama--was intentional from day one. The combined perfection is ""jolly good show."" It's hard to believe--but, 19 episodes comprising 32 hours is simply not enough of ""Foyle's War."" You'll want to move from #1 through to #19 without stopping to sleep. It's that good.

Christopher Foyle (Michael Kitchen) is a cop who'd rather be on the war front than investigating crime in Hastings, England. His cases, almost always murder, are quite involved, and never fail to end with a surprise--or two. I'll stick my neck out--Foyle's as good as Poirot. Foyle recruits help from an ex-soldier who lost a leg. Milner (Anthony Howell) manages to do much of Foyle's ""leg-work"" on an artificial limb.

Foyle is assigned a female driver, ""Sam"" for Samantha Stewart. She's a gorgeous red-head with a winning, million-dollar smile. Sam is as much fun watching in the series as her real name indicates--Honeysuckle Weeks (The Rag Nymph; Catherine Cookson book/movie classic, recommended!) She wins ""Miss Congeniality"" of the 1940s decade.

Perfect attention is given to the period details; sets, costumes, vehicles, architecture, even down to NO yellow road lines.
Both Foyle and Sam speak volumes of dialogue with nothing but facial expressions. Their performances are nothing short of superb. Perfection.

Additional guest cast members of each episode are well-known stars in their own right--following the tradition of some of the top Masterpiece Theatre productions. It is understood that Foyle will continue in a NEW post-war mystery suspense scheduled for perhaps a 2010 airing.
Closed Captioning provides for the hearing impaired and those of us who struggle with some British accents and slang. The set has cast filmographies on all the top regular and guest stars.

""FOYLE'S WAR"" is to British mystery what ""THE PALLISERS"" is to British political drama, OR what ""MONARCH OF THE GLEN"" is to Scottish Highland drama. After you've experienced Foyle's War, I recommend either of the other 2 series.

2826504,5,B000PMFO40,This is an excellent example of BBC doing a great job of telling stories with a complicated plot built around a mystery using actors that are much more interesting than I usually see in my native US produced films.,1326412800,,214,4.512820512820513
2826505,3,B000PMFO40,"I am a Prime member, and as such was able to watch the first 3 seasons for free.  I greatly enjoyed the episodes immensely, the plots are good, the acting is wonderful.  I strongly recommend this series.

However, when I went season four, I found out that the series is no long ""Prime Eligible"".  If I want wanted to watch a , it would cost me $8, for a single episode! While the series is excellent, $8 an episode is ridiculous, especially for a show that is over 5 years old.

So I would rate the series as 5 stars, and rate the pricing as 1 star, thus I gave it 3 stars.

Someone needs to get this pricing in order.

-- Update --  All episodes are available through Prime membership for free --  Thank you Amazon!  As I said before the series deserves a 5 star rating.  I hope there is another season, but do not hold out too much hope.

-- Update 2 -- Some has happened, now only the 1st episode in the 1st season is free (with Ads!).  Ever other episode is now $8, again ridiculous!  This probably not Amazon's doing, more than likely the British.  Too bad, this is a great series.  I noticed it is gone from Netflix as well.  Somebody got greedy.",1324598400,44,1152,4.187214611872146

2826532,3,B000PMFO40,"Season 4's cynicism distinguishes it from the first three seasons.  In Episode One of Season 4, the Americans are portrayed as nitwits and crooks.  In Episode Two of Season 4, British chemical warfare developers are depicted as reckless and incompetent.  By the end of Season 4, it is hard to believe the Nazis were any greater threat to England than the English government itself and its closest allies.  Foyle remains Foyle--patient, observant, reticent--but Kitchen is working listlessly with plots and scripts that portray the English police as, at best, noble victims of modern savagery.  A beautiful recurrent image in Episode Two captures the bathos of Season 4:  the reflection of tree limbs passes along the exterior of Foyle's windshield whenever the car wends its way through the English countryside; the trees are a tracery of darkness against the reflection of a white sky.  Foyle and his colleague Sam Stewart inside the car are not affected by the image, can't even see it, are not stalemated by the war, not caught between darkness and light, not caught between disastrous antipathies.  Foyle's and Stewart's patriotism is founded on their humanity, not on their will to triumph.  The image suggests that though the English Empire will be undone by the modern era, the caring, decent, hard-working people of England will not.",1471651200,2,1341,5.114678899082569

It is a series of multiple meanings: historical, ethical, personal. I ended up learning more about WWII than I had in several  college history courses.

2826705,5,B000PMFO40,"A continuation of the series of British mysteries set in the World War II years, this one around 1941-1942.  A variety of sub-plots that early on seem to have little connection are masterfully woven together to propel each story line to a surprising conclusion. I have long been an avid reader, but this series has impacted me as books and history classes never did. That is because each story in F.W. includes 'the human element' that somehow left me feeling I knew a bit more about what it might have been like to live in Britain during the war. The Brits, after all, were involved in that war long before America was.
My main criticism of this series is that throughout each episode, there are places where the endings of a character's dialog drop in volume. So it's almost always necessary to keep the volume turned louder than one might otherwise use--because if you don't, you will surely miss things (and what you miss could turn out to be really important).",1408060800,,965,4.643274853801169

These mysteries demonstrate that everyday life still happened.  I have enjoyed them all, although I was confused as to why the last two shows were moved to Season 5.

Foyle is the ""Deputy Chief Superintendent"" of a small village in southern England, trying to leave that position to ""do his part"" for the country.  He has a son who is a Spitfire pilot that he worries about, a driver named Samantha that is constantly asking questions to his annoyance, and tons of crime all around him.  His approach is much like Columbo - quiet and disarming - and has the same results.  He always gets his man.

The countryside is gorgeous as are the 40's costumes, scenery, and background drama of the hardships suffered by the British.

The series is set in Great Britain during World War II and each successive season sees the progress through the war from the point of view of the Detective as he oversees the small constabulary of his town that covers the town and its surrounds.  He is a quiet and very effective detective who is constantly observant of his surroundings and great at deduction.  He refuses to be bullied or pushed around.

Invasion is about American GI's moving into Hastings to build a landing strip while a local bartender makes illegal highly potent alcohol. Bad Blood is about incompetent Brits who conduct a chemical warfare experiment that goes terribly wrong, bringing down Sam along with others.  Bleak Midwinter is my least favorite episode, the antagonist is terribly evil and the mood is very bleak indeed.  Casualties of War includes Foyle's depressed niece with a traumatized son.

We have become hooked on Foyle's war. That is in large part thanks to  Prime Instant videos which allowed us to start from the beginning  once we watched an episode on PBS and realized what we were missing.  My husband loves history, especially military history, and I am fond of a good mystery. This show hits on all cylinders.",1391990400,,501,4.308510638297872
2826914,4,B000PMFO40,"I chose the rating of four stars because this series is an accurate,detailed description of the years during World War 11. The element of  the mystery blends in well with a lot of the occurrences during that period, the pilfering of supplies, hatred of the Germans and the loosening of the fabric of society. The actors, actresses are first rate, believable and well chosen, especially Detective Foyle. He is authoritative, quiet and carefully pursues his goal.

Michael Kitchen as Foyle creates a great successor to a long line of British detectives in literature and film. His laid-back attitude and quick intelligence in sizing up a crime scene recall the days when detectives had little but their own wits to solve a crime, making the shows more interesting than today's dramas that rely on DNA and all kinds of forensic hokus-pokus to catch the bad guys. Foyle is laconic, methodical and fair, and not too tolerant of pomposity. The show is livened up by Sam (Samantha Stewart, played by Honeysuckle Weeks), Foyle's perky driver. All in all, another great British TV success.",1383091200,,769,4.9689922480620154

Also, they have tweaked the cameras and other production equipment which results in a huge pay-off in the look'n'feel of the film.

2827214,5,B000PMFO40,"This six (6) part series is on of the finest moral & romantic stories on TV !  The first series appeared about 2002 and the last in 2010.  The best one before this was the Hornblower series (1998-2003).  The generally speaking, world of entertainment is lacking content with ""romantic justice"" as a plot and theme.  Like a spell of continuous dry weather, a drought in the arts has left a thirst for rational entertainment.  Then all of a sudden appears the oasis of Foyle's War.  The force feeding of Realism and Altruism has pounded the public's senses until most citizens give up the hope of ever seeing shows of any value.  Like Hornblower, Foyle sweeps across the screen larger than life and just as ""real"", but with the reasonable ethics so desired by a thirsty audience.
The Foyle's War series shows an honest man with reason as his standard and a code of rational ethics to guide him.  If I didn't know better, I would swear the actor, writer(s) & director(s) schooled under Aristotle & Ayn Rand.
It was like a bright light was turned on for six seasons then turned off!  Any viewer with a thirst for the rational and romantic is encouraged to view this series!",1371168000,,1169,4.581730769230769

The clothes, the settings, the people were authentic, the situations were good mysteries.  Michael Kitchen is Mr. Foyle, serious, intelligent, and hiding a sense of humor.  I paced out the series because just like a box of candy, I wanted to savor each bite, and save some for tomorrow.  The series was the best I've seen, and I hated to see it end.",1370649600,,457,4.604938271604938

2827300,5,B000PMFO40,"I have always been an Anglophile (especially when I thought we were from England and learned later we came from Germany.)  I think the Brits ""get it"" with their calm, collected approach to life, crisis, politics.  This show, Foyle's War, reflects the British way of approaching crime drama.  Foyle is a laid-back, intelligent, cunning man, veteran of the Great War earlier, and who finds himself at the beginning of WWII as a much-needed police commandant in the south of England in 1940, where the series starts.  Each episode moves you a bit farther along in time and shows how Foyle solves crime after crime with the help of his assistant Milner and his adorable driver Sam (Samantha).
It is typical Brit dialog, a bit of mumble, a bit of dry humor, subtlety.  Listen carefully!  You may miss a word or two here and there but the dialog is delightful, typically British.
It is five star all the way.  You won't want to sleep or eat, once you get hooked on this show.  For myself, we watched four episodes of the first set on a single day.  It's like watching a full length movie each episode.  It's that good.",1356134400,2,1112,4.570707070707071

two many Wars.  We tend not to think about all the suffering on both sides.  One has deeper appreciation for the Brits during this period.  Too many have suffered, and died hoping to end all Wars, only to have their own children die in Another!",1353715200,,501,4.584269662921348

Talk about a hook. I would have not had a problem paying a fair price, say $2-3 / episode, but they were actually charging $9 per episode and you can't really find it anywhere else!

This series should get five stars, but, because of the price, I had to knock two stars off.  $8 with no option to rent?  Not going to happen.  Especially since I can watch all six seasons on netflix for less than that per month.  Maybe they are supposed to be $1.99 and someone mis-keyed it?  If you really want to see this series, take your $8 and buy a month of Netflix and you can watch all the seasons for less than the price of one episode.

I'm a prime member and I didn't want to pay $7.99 per episode starting with season 4.  Well guess what?  It's now available to watch instantly on Netflix.  Unlimited streaming is $7.99 a month.  I'm not a huge Netflix fan (even though I'm a member), but it would be a very cost effective way to watch this series, even if you only kept the membership for a month.",1341619200,7,471,4.131868131868132
2827308,5,B000PMFO40,"being an american, it certainly added something to the show for me to see the average brit's reactions to american servicemen coming into the UK as allies to fight WWII. it was not the joyous reception for us that perhaps we imagined.  we saw ourselves as the saviors but they saw as more as the interlopers that wanted to bring america with us into their country.  there are merits, of course, to both sides of these perceptions.

i think the most harrowing episode for me personally was the one showing us trying to impose our racial segregation upon the Brits.  we asked them to make some bars and restaurants for whites only while making others for blacks only.  only foyle opposes this because britain has never been a segregated society. they never required people of different colors to use different facilities.

the opening episode shows something that probably happened quite a bit also.  a barmaid sees her exit out of britain and her entrance into a better life via an american GI.  she gets pregnant by him quickly and immediately demands to be taken back to the USA. within a very short time, she ends up dead.

michael kitchen is excellent as always.  this is a wonderful series.  all of it is on netflix instant viewing where i watched it.

2827311,5,B000PMFO40,"I stumbled on this series and loved it. They have done a wonderful time piece and if your a fan of history you will like this show. The actors are very good and the stories are interesting. I was able to watch the first three seasons for free ( as a prime member) but seasons 4 5 &  6 you have to buy. The price is a little to high at $7:99 per show. I do wish amazon would offer the complete collection to prime memebers not just half. ( there are running stories like Mr. Foyle's son who is in the RAF  leaves you with the question does he make it though the war?) It kind of feels like AMAZON gave a taste and wants us to pay up. In the future if a series is offered to Prime members I hope its the complete series not just half.
So love the show actors are great
