3008155,5,B000XUF6AG,"I like everything in it. It is a really high quality series. It is sober, it is daring, it is lovely, it is about a woman who is never out of control and, at the same time, is allways free. She is not a saint but she is not a sinner either. The actress is wonderful and the direction and art direction are perfect. Oscar Wilde is... Oscar Wilde! No one could do it any better! I liked it back in 1978 and I like it now.",1217289600,4,419,3.8275862068965516
3008156,4,B000XUF6AG,"The acting is every bit up to early Masterpiece standards.  Dialogue is elegant and refined, costumes are positively scrumptious.  It is a fine portrait of the unequalled Lillie Langtry, and a delightful peek at some (in)famous celebrities of her time.",1214092800,3,252,5.275

3008159,5,B000XUF6AG,"""Lillie,"" a half-forgotten classic from the golden age of the British television miniseries, that starred Francesca Annis as Lillie Langtry, a turn of the 20th century society beauty - professional beauty, as they called them, although they weren't supposed to be professional at all,finally reaches these shores.  The DVD has been remastered from its TV incarnation, however, as the series is rather old, having first appeared on American TV in 1979, there are a few odd moments that resisted clarification.  But the production, by Granada for London Weekend Television, is at least as sumptuous as any treatment of the material by the British Broadcasting Corporation might have been.  The costumes and carriages are accurate; filming was done on location; and the thirteen episode entertainment utilizes a cast of over 1,000, including live musicians at the numerous balls.

The drama traces the rise of the beauteous Jersey clergyman's daughter, through London society - where she caught a number of royal eyes--to become one of the first famous, independent - and infamous - women of the twentieth century.  The gorgeous Annis, who was a British TV star from her teenage years, carries the production in a BAFTA(the British Oscar)winning performance, appearing in most scenes, from youth to old age.  She may be best remembered here from the 1997 British TV series ""Reckless,"" but she's actually played Langtry twice, as well as playing Madame Bovary, and Jackie Kennedy Onassis, for British TV.  She is ably assisted here by Peter Egan as Oscar Wilde; Anton Rodgers as her first husband, Edward Langtry; and Denis Lill, playing the Prince of Wales, to briefly sit the English throne as Edward VII.  Each of these men show up on several episodes, must age along with the star, and have dramatic character arcs.  Jennie Linden also does well as Langtry's close friend, Mrs. Patsy Cornwallis-West.

Lillie was first taken up by London society for her extraordinary beauty, and was painted by James Whistler and John Everett Millais, among others.  She was lionized by Wilde, Walt Whitman, George Bernard Shaw, and Judge Roy Bean of Texas, who, as viewers who remember an old Paul Newman movie will know, named his town ""Langtry,"" after her.

She scandalized London society by a string of affairs with royals: Prince Edward, who was called Bertie - while she always remained on good terms with his wife Alexandra -- and Prince Louis of Battenberg, among others; and turned down Leopold of Belgium and Price Rudolf of Austria (who was, famously, later to kill himself and his mistress at Mayerling).  She was also collecting spectacular jewels all the way.  But she still needed more money.  So she was the first `professional beauty' to pose for paid celebrity endorsements.  And she went into business for herself, buying numerous properties; meanwhile she had to pay the alcoholic Langtry, who refused to give her a divorce, to keep his distance.  She went on the stage, becoming an immensely popular actress, if not one of the most prestigious,and toured America many times.  She had her own racing stable.

Lillie bore one daughter, illegitimately, to Prince Louis of Battenberg.  He unfortunately was a cousin of the Royal Family, and a career naval officer.  The Prince of Wales did not think it advisable to let him marry Lillie; so she was forced to have her daughter in secret, and misrepresent the girl to herself, and the disapproving world.  Whether because of resentment at this treatment, or simply as a result of the pendulum of character's swinging from one generation to the next, the daughter, Jeanne Marie, appears to have grown up an extremely conventional woman.  She refused to see her mother for nigh on twenty years; nor would she let the woman know her grandchildren.  There can be no doubt that Jeanne Marie caused her mother great pain: as Shakespeare says in ""King Lear,"" ""How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless child.""

Meanwhile, Price Louis, the girl's father, was to rise very high indeed in the British Navy, to Admiralty rank.  But anti-German prejudice in World War I forced him to resign.  However, his youngest son by the German princess whom he married would also have a highly-successful naval career.  Lord Louis Mountbatten would be given many titles and honors; he was a friend of the royal family's, as well as a relation.  He was also an uncle to Prince Philip, the current-day consort of Queen Elizabeth II, and was instrumental in making that marriage.  He was an outstanding figure; so much so, unhappily, that he was assassinated by the Irish Republican Army at the age of 79.

The series is quite engrossing, a seductive telling of the life of a famed seductress.  A series of thirteen episodes requires more of a commitment than perhaps we are accustomed to make today (some of us may wonder how we ever did it back then); but its length allows the viewer to immerse him- or herself in an immensely pleasurable experience.",1209772800,8,4996,4.960384153661464
3008160,5,B000XUF6AG,"Lillie is another  fine British mini-series from the 1970s, which seems to have been the heyday of the genre.  It depicts the story of Lillie Langtry, the Jersey Lily, most famous beauty of the age.  Francesca Annis was born to play the part, with her flawless complexion and beautiful hair evoking Langtry at her magnificent peak.  The series traces Lillie's life from girlhood on the island of Jersey, when she was already a beauty, through her unfortunate marriage to Edward Langtry, a weak man whose dissipations destroyed him, to her days as a Professional Beauty in London Society and mistress to the Prince of Wales.  If the series stopped there it would be enjoyable enough, but the story gains additional depth by going on to depict Lillie as an actress in Britain and America, showing her to have been a sharp businesswoman.  The final episodes show her in decline and end with her literal last few breaths.  Throughout the series we see not only Lillie's career but those of many other important artists, politicians, and royals, ranging from King Edward VII through Oscar Wilde all the way to William Gladstone.  Lillie is a lot of fun, with room for quite a bit of real history and drama, too.",1202860800,45,1206,4.764423076923077
3008161,5,B000XUF6AG,"""Masterpiece Theatre"" was originally designed to show dramatized versions of great classics or of historical periods from England's past. ""The First Churchills"" led the way and many a great adaptation of a novel or a biography has followed. (Alas, a lot of junk was soon considered ""masterpieces"" and the glory of the series faded.) Among the best of them was the 13-part miniseries titled ""Lillie,"" and it is now available in a boxed set of Acorn Media DVDs. Grab it!

 Part of the plot of the 1940 film ""The Westerner"" is concerned with Judge Roy Bean's infatuation with an English actress named Lillie Langtry. That character shows up in ""Lillie"" just once but memorably, but the scene does raise the question of how just another pretty face could so become the rage of England and America without its owner having any other particular talents (they say her acting was amateurish at best)--except an iron will to get what she wants and a high degree of intelligence.

As played by Francesca Annis, whose own good looks make the story believable, Lillie suffers an early disillusionment when she marries Mr. Langtry (brilliantly played by  Anton Rodgers) because he is a ""gentleman"" (= an utterly useless person) with a yacht. Then she quickly realizes he has far less fortune than she thought and even less understanding of how a wife should be treated (after their wedding night, he spends the rest of the day in town). In the years that follow, although she becomes the mistress of the Prince of Wales (Denis Lill) and of several other men, Langtry doggedly refuses a divorce--and his end is possibly just what he deserves or rather a bit more than he deserves. The very fact that I wonder about this shows how deeply I felt for these characters as I again watched this 672-minute miniseries, which was first shown on American public television in 1979.

 Actually, my fondest memories of ""Lillie"" are of the unforgettable Oscar Wilde of Peter Egan. Having seen Robert Morley, Peter Finch and others play the role, I have to call Egan's Wilde the very best. If one views only those scenes in which he appears, the price of the set would still be worth it.

 The cast list on the Internet Movie Database runs for seven pages, and I refer my readers to that website. I ran off a copy and kept it near my chair to identify familiar faces along the way, one of which was that of Jennie Linden who portrays Lillie's closest friend, Patsy Cornwallis-West.

 I will be replaying this one over the years to come. Ten stars out of ten.",1201219200,60,2531,4.693002257336343
3008162,5,B000XUF6AG,"Quite simply, one of the best BBC Classic TV Miniseries ever produced. Filmed in 1978 and to be released in a four-disc DVD set, the miniseries stars the brilliant Francesca Annis (Tommy and Tuppence, etc.) as Lillie Langtry, one of the most famous and infamous courtesans/ladies of the Victorian age.

In an era when women were to be seen and not heard, the unforgettable Lillie broke every taboo without a backward glance. The series chronicles her long life, and in so doing presents one of the best portraits of Victorian England ever filmed.

We watch Lillie as a young tomboy, grow to an awkward adolescent, a stunning woman, and a beautiful old woman. Each stage of her life is portrayed perfectly by Annis, the makeup transforming her body while her awesome talent transforms her character development as Lillie.

Lillie is one-of-a-kind, a calculating woman of immense presence, grace and substance. Unfortunately, she becomes trapped in a loveless marriage, but she devises her own way to cope.

Taking full advantage of her beauty, Lillie deliberately attracts as many as a dozen lovers and admirers including the married Prince of Wales and notorious Oscar Wilde.

As her husband slowly drinks himself to death, she relies on her looks, wiles and self-assurance in the London Society of the 1870s to embark upon a sensational career as a marginally talented actress.

With guile, Lillie creates a truly unique life of the courtesan, eventually gaining prestige by going on the stage and touring America many times over.

Throughout her life she endures financial ruin and scandal, yet maintains her celebrated lifestyle. Because Lillie lives to be a very old woman, viewers are given an honest glimpse of the Victoria Era through the span of her life.

As with every BBC miniseries dealing with period stories, the acting, staging, filming and music is all well above top notch.",1197676800,178,1890,5.035256410256411
3008163,4,B000XUF6AG,"This thirteen part Masterpiece Theatre series, which first aired in 1979, is certainly worth watching as it is quite entertaining and well done. Detailing the life and loves of the notorious Lillie Langtry, the Victorian era superstar, it gives the viewer a taste of an era gone by. Beautifully acted by a stellar cast, the production suffers only from the unfortunate lighting used in the nineteen seventies, giving the sets and actors a somewhat washed out and flat appearance. That being said, it is still a series well worth watching.

Born on the British isle of Jersey to a womanizing clergyman and his wife, Lillie is a tomboy who matures into a beautiful girl. At an early age, she marries Edward Langtry, a purportedly wealthy yachtsman from a shipping family, who takes her to live in Southampton. There, she finds life not to her liking. She soon discovers that her husband has sold her a bill of goods, as his wealth has been spent. After a bout with a serious illness, she contrives a move to London, where she is exposed to a taste of high society. After a false start, she gets noticed by the local swells and becomes a renowned beauty, sought after by all. Now, a fashionable society woman, she finds herself with her name on everyone's lips. Lillie eventually comes to the attention of the married Prince of Wales and becomes his mistress.

Trapped in her loveless marriage with the hapless and alcoholic Edward Langtry, Lillie goes on to have numerous love affairs with some of the most socially prominent and wealthy men of her day and eventually has a love child. Courted by all, her beauty and need for money brings her to the stage, where she becomes an actress with her own company. Her fame by now has spanned the ocean and made her a celebrity in America, as well as in Europe.

Lillie certainly knew the value of marketing, as she endorsed numerous products with her name. A woman ahead of her time, who marched to the beat of her own drum, she still went to great pains to avoid scandal, though it was never far from her doorstep. Alas, in the end, her fame and beauty decimated by age, her lovers dead or gone, Lillie, no longer the toast of two continents, ends up nothing more than a lonely old lady.

The cast for this production is stellar and the costumes are first rate. Francesca Annis is beautiful and certainly gives a competent performance as the notorious Lillie. Though her performance is acclaimed, however, the viewer cannot help but wonder why such a fuss was ever made over Lillie, as she comes across as supremely shallow and vapid. I attribute this to the fact that Ms. Annis' portrayal of Lillie comes across as being rather flat, failing to make her a truly likable character. Peter Egan, on the other hand, is superb as Oscar Wilde and, as far as I am concerned, steals the show. Filled with much social intrigue and witty repartee, the series will keep the viewer riveted to the screen.",1160179200,,2936,4.629558541266794

3008214,5,B000XUF6AG,"Whilst Ms Annis portrays Lillie Langtry with aplomb, let us not forget Peter Egan's exquisite Oscar Wilde! Mr Egan captures the essence of Wilde as the self-conscious aesthete, worshiper of Beauty, and man of words brilliantly. He encounters Ms Langtry as a relative newcomer to London and helps blaze the trail for her in society and in the American entertainment world. Their tempestuous relationship reflects their parallel evolutions and unfolding as theatre practitioners and human beings --- the one serving as a foil to the other. Mr Egan's portrayal shows us Oscar Wilde at his most vain-glorious and most heart-wrenchingly humbled. Not to be missed.",1435017600,6,658,5.276190476190476

3008219,4,B000XUF6AG,"Francesca Annis is a marvelous actress and this mini series put her on the map for American viewers. She is a beautiful woman too which is essential for the role. She also really nails this role of Lillie, who was billed as an actress but was even more active as a courtesan. Lillie is trapped in a loveless marriage in the Victorian Era so takes her pleasures elsewhere and amongst the extremely well known and even royal. She is also a great hit when she tours America.

Although this is all very well done by the end you realize you have watched a very long miniseries about a woman who was incredibly ambitious and prostituted herself any way she could to achieve a life of success and elegance. She may have been a bit short on talent but she more than made up for it with drive, beauty and seduction. Some viewers may prefer their biographical subjects to be a bit more admirable.

3008232,3,B000XUF6AG,"I usually enjoy British historical dramas, and Lillie shares many of the positives of similar series -- excellent acting, beautiful and historically accurate costumes and sets, and generally top production values.

But I have to say that, while I struggled through to the end, I found Lillie to be less than engaging.  The problem, I think, is with the character of Lillie.  While she is clearly the protagonist of the piece, she is not a very likeable person.  And neither she nor her story is inherently interesting enough to make her a credible antihero.

Lille  marries for money and a ticket off the island where she was born.  Hoping for an exciting life of society in London with a weatlhy husband, she quickly finds herself bored with her life in Southampton and her rather dull husband -- abd basically blackmails him into taking her to London. After a few months of boredom in London, Lillie is suddenly 'discovered' by a couple of artists, and soon finds herself (or her picture) the talk of the town.  For the next few years, Lillie's husband becomes nothing more than a meal ticket, as Lillie is painted and worshipped by everyone in society, nearly raped by a few -- and then willingly bedded by several of the top ranks (princes, millionaires...)  who also shower her with gifts ranging from houses to diamonds. When she finds she needs more money to support her lavish lifestyle and turns to acting, she again quickly begins to neglect her work in favor of spending time with her latest conquest.

 To be honest, I found myself feeling sorry for Ned (her husband) who had done nothing wrong, (his worst sins seemed to be talking a bit too much about his former wife)  but turns to alcohol to numb his pain as he is ignored by his wife and her new friends and lovers.",1419292800,4,1782,4.640127388535032

Oscar Wilde , a very prominent writer..and many more so called intellegent and powerful men ...falling into web of a seductress..ladies keeping association with ""such desirable by men"" woman just so they can bait the high profile men..well portrayed England in 19th and early 20th century..well acted as well...Particularly antonio rodgers ( as Edward Langtry)

3008268,3,B000XUF6AG,"You don't need another plot synopsis.  The question is whether you should watch (or buy/rent).

If you're looking to be entertained, you're better off with Breaking Bad, or even Lost.  What you DO get from Lillie, though, is an opportunity to watch actors working, and to watch a production company dealing with the challenges that come with trying to cram the lifetime of Lillie Langtree - a truly enigmatic, if uber-popular figure - into 13 segments of 51 minutes.

First (and foremost?), the script and ""show-running"" are clumsy, at best.  It feels like the creator(s) had a list of a couple hundred known historical bullet points of Langtree's life, and then they shot them one-after-another: ""Here's where the theater burnt down.  Here's where her horses died in a train wreck.  Here's where all her jewelry got stolen, etc.""  The production values don't help this episodic feel.  At least once per episode there's a jarring cut from one scene to the next.  Even the underscore is chopped off.  There's a second of black screen then a new scene starts.

HOWEVER, I have to say some of the acting here, particularly by the supporting characters, is worthy of study.  Peter Egan's portrayal of Oscar Wilde is probably worth the price of the DVD set by itself.  You can see in his eyes and in his manner the depth of complicated and conflicting passions beneath Wilde's devil-may-care and lightning quick-witted public persona.  You'll also enjoy other priceless little characterizations along the way.

But, this dynamic tapestry to play in front of only emphasizes the single-note playing in the titular role by Francesca Annis.  If the point of the production is to depict Lillie as superficial beauty and nothing else, well, it succeeds.  Annis won the BAFTA award in 1979, in part, for this role, and she's obviously done great work elsewhere, but this is disappointing.  She simply strikes the same chord again, and again, and again!

This is an important television series in that its popularity (with a couple of additional series) virtually saved London Weekend Television (LWT) in the late 70s, or at least postponed its demise.  Overall, the series is worth viewing as a study, but on more than one occasion I found myself checking to see how much time was left of a particular episode.  If you're expecting another Upstairs, Downstairs or I, Claudius, you're going to be disappointed.",1380844800,3,2398,4.957393483709273

I was very young when I watched the original showing, and I am afraid I fell in love with Peter Egan who played Oscar Wild!  He was so gifted in that part.  It made me reflect upon the lives and period of that time and I began studying the era.

I don't believe Lilie considered herself a ""prostitute"" as a previous review has stated.  She was a woman of that era who needed to survive and do what she could to survive.  And, definitely she did not feel unhappy or deprived!  She loved her life, with a love that most of us never know.  Indeed, she died after a life that none of us will ever achieve or know!

3008294,5,B000XUF6AG,"""Lillie"" tells the engaging story of the fortunes and travails of Lillie Langtry. Most well-known for having been the mistress of the Prince of Wales, Lillie as portrayed by Francesca Annis appears to be a strong, courageous woman who is not afraid to follow her own path in order to find some measure of happiness and success in her life. Unconventional in her thinking, she challenges the traditional notion of a woman's role in society as imposed upon the women of her time, and breaks free of those conventions to make a lasting mark. As the blurb on the DVD goes ""Lillie Langtry played by a new set of rules. Her own."" Francesca Annis brings tremendous depth to her role as Lillie, lending an air of vulnerability tempered with a strong will. Her other performance that I was impressed by was in another period drama&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Madame-Bovary-The-Complete-Miniseries/dp/B0000A5A1N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Madame Bovary - The Complete Miniseries</a>.",1348358400,,1020,5.673202614379085
3008295,5,B000XUF6AG,"I remember seeing this on PBS and was so excited when it was finally put in DVD format AND for a reasonable price.  This is the story - told in about 12 episodes - of the life of Lillie Langtry who began her notorious adult life as the mistress of the Prince of Wales (later he became King Edward VII).  During that time she also was the muse to artists John Everett Millais, Edward Poynter, Edward Burne-Jones and Frank Miles. When that affair ended, she became a very well-known actress.  Unfortunately, she wasn't all that good but people came to see her perform because of her notoriety.  The word we'd use for Lillie nowadays is a tramp - she used men and slept with them and in return she received access to more rich and powerful men and also plenty of money and jewelry.  She lived a relatively long life, had a daughter and died alone in Monte Carlo.

If you enjoy period English drama, love seeing the beautiful costumes, and want to get enveloped into the delicious, fabulous, tawdry, decadent, funny, sad life of a woman who reinvented herself more than once and survived the times, this is the DVD for you.

Francesa Annis is so beautiful and is truly a wonderful actress -- it was a pleasure to look at her.  All the supporting cast are so well placed in their characters that you actually think you are seeing the real people they are portraying.

Of course, there must have been great liberties taken in presenting the story since no one really knows what transpired in conversations between the real people, but this is as convincing as it gets.

I just loved this when I first saw it on PBS and I still love it now.",1338854400,4,1633,4.449664429530201

The cast is excellent, Francesca Annis is beautiful. The script is fine, and shows with sensitivity how this unhappy woman, avid of the pleasures of hi-society slowly turns into a prostitute. So, it is an excellent series, except for me. I have no interest in the biography of a prostitute: it is is saddening, and it is very boring to me. I wish somebody would make an intelligent and sensitive series about Marie Curie, for a change.",1327449600,11,696,5.97

The dialogue is crisp and sophisticated, and even the seconday players are excellent -- e.g., how simultaneously grating and sympathetic is the character of Lilly's husband Ned?? In defense of Francesca Annis's performance -- she brilliantly exudes the icy coldness of, well, an icy cold beauty. It is to her credit that she resisted the tempation toward histrionics. But the actor that for me left the most indelible memory is Peter Egan as Oscar Wilde -- a towering performance.

It was well done, directed, and acted.  Period costumes were wonderful.  London society captivated my attention.  After I watched the series, I took the time to read some of her biographical information about Lillie Langtry's real life. However, as one reviewer put it mildly, the woman pretty much prostituted herself to make her way to the top of society. I found her character to be shallow, calculating, and oddly irritating. As a result, I felt compelled to fast forward through some of the final episodes just to be done with it. I was tired of Langtry's attitude, her voice, and her actions. I had lost my respect for the woman. I'm sure London society, in all of its glamor, glitz, and royalty had its share of adultery and mistresses.  Everyone pretty much knows that Bertie was quite the risque fellow, who frequented the famous brothels of Paris on his trips besides having mistresses of his own.  Nevertheless, as great of a period piece that it was, I found myself feeling quite saddened by a life who may have been popular with the men of London, but underneath all the frills of her dresses, there appeared to be a cold and calculating heart. You would think that a woman of beauty, both inside and outside, would be one to admire instead.",1322092800,12,1410,4.661290322580645

3008302,5,B000XUF6AG,"just finished watching Lillie for the second time. I found the series to be very entertaining.  Francesca Annis plays a great Lillie and does what she must do in the only ways available to her in this late victorian story to improve her life and live in the way she wishes.  She is not without her faults and has her share of disappointments and tradgedy, but manages to come through it all in fairly good shape. A very strong and brilliant woman.

Oscar Wilde was her very good friend and I loved his character.  Most of the laughs were because of his extremely witty dialogue. He is played as a kind person with amazing talent.  I have always thought he was badly mistreated and punished by a society that refused to accept anyone who was different.

Lillie's husband was typical of ""gentlemen"" of that era.  Born to wealth and when he lost it unable to cope, using his wife's talents to sustain a lifestyle he was used to.  A very sad ending for a decent, but shallow man who simply couldn't support himself.

The sets, costumes and outside shots were great.  The entire cast was outstanding.  I would recommend this great series to anyone who likes period pieces.  One of the best in my opinion.",1306886400,3,1199,4.525581395348837

Though its been thirty years since I've seen it, I find that the episodes are startlingly familiar.  This miniseries is that good.

Lillie Langtree was a beautiful artist's model and an internationally famous beauty, but what made her special was her intelligence, wit and determination to keep up with the brilliant artists, writers and politicians around her.  Lillie had an instinct for drama and how to play situations so that she would remain popular for years.  Her staged argument (she put ice down the back of his shirt at a party) with the Prince of Wales showed an amazing understanding of how to make sure she was always envied and never pitied.  Lillie was an orignial and as played by Francesca Annis, her charisma is unforgetable.",1271289600,3,892,4.867549668874172

I remember waiting for it weekly to come on Masterpeice Theatre and that it was hard to get the television to myself to view this series. Francesca Annis left an impression on me that I have never forgotten. This item has been on my wish list for YEARS and I am overjoyed to see it available again! I just viewed it again for the first time, as I was able to purchase a previous version through an Amazon Marketplace seller. It holds up, despite the years since its' release, due in large part by the magnificent cast, lavish sets, and strength of Ms. Annis' stunning performance. I cannot recommend this highly enough! I rated it a four only because of the strange age makeup they used on Ms. Annis, which does not hold up to the rigors of HDTV and seems to change from frighteningly plastic, to ghost white, to almost normal. The serious lack of any real extra bonus features is also a minus. I could not stop watching this until I had viewed the entire series again. Anything that will hold your attention this long and this well is a wise investment. The life of Lillie Langtry was an amazing epic journey that any woman would have traded places with her for, and it is brilliantly executed in this series! You can even stay in the home that the king had built for her to this day and visit the original saloon named after her, in the town re named for her in Texas! Facinating Character Subject? A crass understatement. Buy it and live the life of a poverty to princedom real life story!",1258070400,32,1556,4.387543252595155
3008310,5,B000XUF6AG,"This miniseries is the story of a self absorbed, self centered PB  (professional beauty) or super model as she would be known today.  Lillie Langtry later became an actress but from what little else I know about her, she couldn't hold a candle to Sarah Bernhardt or Lillian Russell.

The people who deserved her kindness and consideration didn't get it and the ones who weren't deserving of it did.  She sold her soul for jewelry, beautiful clothes, property, race horses, houses and the most intoxicating of all, social standing.  In order to continue to receive expensive jewelry from one of her many lovers, she would willingly take a beating so violent that she had to be hospitalized.  Her husband, Edward Langtry, played stunningly well by Anton Rogers, although a buffoon who lost his fortune shortly after their marriage, died alone in an asylum due to alcoholism.  Rather than consider his feelings of being overshadowed by her popularity and adultery w/the Prince of Wales (Bertie), she chose to buy him off by sending him a small amount of money each month until his death.  Oscar Wilde, the poet and playwright, played to perfection by Peter Egan, hardly worthy of the attention that she fawned on him, was taken care of by Lillie after his bankruptcy 'til the day he died.  Even her own father, a minister who was disgraced and forced to leave his church due to misconduct w/women, didn't receive any help from Lillie.  She'd say that ""it's about time that I do something for him"" but she never did.  Lillie grew up w/6 brothers and I feel that contributed to her attitude towards men, that they're to be used and cast aside when finished w/them.  I think she felt that her father deserved what he got as did her husband and that she'd make herself look good in the eyes of others but would do as little as possible to help them.  As a result of her reckless and thoughtless behavior throughout her life, her illegitimate daughter born to the Prince of Austria, was passed off as her niece who later learned her true parentage and did not speak to her mother again until just before Lillie's own passing.  Lillie never got to enjoy her daughter or grandchildren due to her own disregard for the feelings and lives of others.  She died alone and forgotten, a sad but just ending to a woman who cared for no one but herself.

Francesca Annis played the part of Lillie and although others have given her rave reviews, I feel that each part Annis plays is the same flat portrayal w/only a name change.  Compare her acting in Madame Bovary and you'll see what I mean.  She was a stunning beauty in her day so she may have been cast w/that reason uppermost.  Others outshined her in this production but I gave it 5 stars anyhow because I truly enjoyed it.",1255737600,,2762,4.6114519427402865

Forced by circumstances to work for a living, she took to the stage and had a stellar theatrical career touring all over the world. What a ride she had, and what a great story to tell!

Francesca Annis is incandescent as Lillie Langtry, and it's hard to imagine the real Lillie being any different from Ms. Annis' portrayal.  She's so good that at no point does all the praise and attention she garners as Lillie become incredible. The supporting characters are equally wonderful and I'll warn anyone who purchases this set--don't start watching it unless you have time to finish it--you won't want to stop until the end.

As always in one of these series from the Golden Age of the BBC, every detail of set and costume is perfect, as is the writing.

Consider the slightly poor production quality as a rift in time as you become an onlooker right by the side of the characters. Hopefully at some point, a film archivist will doctor the original production. Don't know why it hasn't already been done.

Having watched ""Lillie"" on ""Masterpiece Theatre"" as a teenager, I was immediately captivated by Peter Egan's Oscar Wilde, especially, and sought to learn more about Wilde, Langtry, and all their artistic peers and royalty in this amazing era in history. Calling Francesca Annis' performance ""flat"" ( per the reviewer in the product description section) is disgraceful. She is BRILLIANT and at her best in this drama. In fact, everyone is impeccably cast.

Also, the story line is terrific (you couldn't make this stuff up) and the costumes worn by Ms. Annis are superb.

3242656,5,B000XUF6AG,"""Lillie,"" a half-forgotten classic from the golden age of the British television miniseries, that starred Francesca Annis as Lillie Langtry, a turn of the 20th century society beauty - professional beauty, as they called them, although they weren't supposed to be professional at all,finally reaches these shores.  The DVD has been remastered from its TV incarnation, however, as the series is rather old, having first appeared on American TV in 1979, there are a few odd moments that resisted clarification.  But the production, by Granada for London Weekend Television, is at least as sumptuous as any treatment of the material by the British Broadcasting Corporation might have been.  The costumes and carriages are accurate; filming was done on location; and the thirteen episode entertainment utilizes a cast of over 1,000, including live musicians at the numerous balls.

The drama traces the rise of the beauteous Jersey clergyman's daughter, through London society - where she caught a number of royal eyes--to become one of the first famous, independent - and infamous - women of the twentieth century.  The gorgeous Annis, who was a British TV star from her teenage years, carries the production in a BAFTA(the British Oscar)winning performance, appearing in most scenes, from youth to old age.  She may be best remembered here from the 1997 British TV series ""Reckless,"" but she's actually played Langtry twice, as well as playing Madame Bovary, and Jackie Kennedy Onassis, for British TV.  She is ably assisted here by Peter Egan as Oscar Wilde; Anton Rodgers as her first husband, Edward Langtry; and Denis Lill, playing the Prince of Wales, to briefly sit the English throne as Edward VII.  Each of these men show up on several episodes, must age along with the star, and have dramatic character arcs.  Jennie Linden also does well as Langtry's close friend, Mrs. Patsy Cornwallis-West.

Lillie was first taken up by London society for her extraordinary beauty, and was painted by James Whistler and John Everett Millais, among others.  She was lionized by Wilde, Walt Whitman, George Bernard Shaw, and Judge Roy Bean of Texas, who, as viewers who remember an old Paul Newman movie will know, named his town ""Langtry,"" after her.

She scandalized London society by a string of affairs with royals: Prince Edward, who was called Bertie - while she always remained on good terms with his wife Alexandra -- and Prince Louis of Battenberg, among others; and turned down Leopold of Belgium and Price Rudolf of Austria (who was, famously, later to kill himself and his mistress at Mayerling).  She was also collecting spectacular jewels all the way.  But she still needed more money.  So she was the first `professional beauty' to pose for paid celebrity endorsements.  And she went into business for herself, buying numerous properties; meanwhile she had to pay the alcoholic Langtry, who refused to give her a divorce, to keep his distance.  She went on the stage, becoming an immensely popular actress, if not one of the most prestigious,and toured America many times.  She had her own racing stable.

Lillie bore one daughter, illegitimately, to Prince Louis of Battenberg.  He unfortunately was a cousin of the Royal Family, and a career naval officer.  The Prince of Wales did not think it advisable to let him marry Lillie; so she was forced to have her daughter in secret, and misrepresent the girl to herself, and the disapproving world.  Whether because of resentment at this treatment, or simply as a result of the pendulum of character's swinging from one generation to the next, the daughter, Jeanne Marie, appears to have grown up an extremely conventional woman.  She refused to see her mother for nigh on twenty years; nor would she let the woman know her grandchildren.  There can be no doubt that Jeanne Marie caused her mother great pain: as Shakespeare says in ""King Lear,"" ""How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless child.""

Meanwhile, Price Louis, the girl's father, was to rise very high indeed in the British Navy, to Admiralty rank.  But anti-German prejudice in World War I forced him to resign.  However, his youngest son by the German princess whom he married would also have a highly-successful naval career.  Lord Louis Mountbatten would be given many titles and honors; he was a friend of the royal family's, as well as a relation.  He was also an uncle to Prince Philip, the current-day consort of Queen Elizabeth II, and was instrumental in making that marriage.  He was an outstanding figure; so much so, unhappily, that he was assassinated by the Irish Republican Army at the age of 79.

The series is quite engrossing, a seductive telling of the life of a famed seductress.  A series of thirteen episodes requires more of a commitment than perhaps we are accustomed to make today (some of us may wonder how we ever did it back then); but its length allows the viewer to immerse him- or herself in an immensely pleasurable experience.",1209772800,8,4996,4.960384153661464
3242657,5,B000XUF6AG,"Lillie is another  fine British mini-series from the 1970s, which seems to have been the heyday of the genre.  It depicts the story of Lillie Langtry, the Jersey Lily, most famous beauty of the age.  Francesca Annis was born to play the part, with her flawless complexion and beautiful hair evoking Langtry at her magnificent peak.  The series traces Lillie's life from girlhood on the island of Jersey, when she was already a beauty, through her unfortunate marriage to Edward Langtry, a weak man whose dissipations destroyed him, to her days as a Professional Beauty in London Society and mistress to the Prince of Wales.  If the series stopped there it would be enjoyable enough, but the story gains additional depth by going on to depict Lillie as an actress in Britain and America, showing her to have been a sharp businesswoman.  The final episodes show her in decline and end with her literal last few breaths.  Throughout the series we see not only Lillie's career but those of many other important artists, politicians, and royals, ranging from King Edward VII through Oscar Wilde all the way to William Gladstone.  Lillie is a lot of fun, with room for quite a bit of real history and drama, too.",1202860800,45,1206,4.764423076923077
3242658,5,B000XUF6AG,"""Masterpiece Theatre"" was originally designed to show dramatized versions of great classics or of historical periods from England's past. ""The First Churchills"" led the way and many a great adaptation of a novel or a biography has followed. (Alas, a lot of junk was soon considered ""masterpieces"" and the glory of the series faded.) Among the best of them was the 13-part miniseries titled ""Lillie,"" and it is now available in a boxed set of Acorn Media DVDs. Grab it!

 Part of the plot of the 1940 film ""The Westerner"" is concerned with Judge Roy Bean's infatuation with an English actress named Lillie Langtry. That character shows up in ""Lillie"" just once but memorably, but the scene does raise the question of how just another pretty face could so become the rage of England and America without its owner having any other particular talents (they say her acting was amateurish at best)--except an iron will to get what she wants and a high degree of intelligence.

As played by Francesca Annis, whose own good looks make the story believable, Lillie suffers an early disillusionment when she marries Mr. Langtry (brilliantly played by  Anton Rodgers) because he is a ""gentleman"" (= an utterly useless person) with a yacht. Then she quickly realizes he has far less fortune than she thought and even less understanding of how a wife should be treated (after their wedding night, he spends the rest of the day in town). In the years that follow, although she becomes the mistress of the Prince of Wales (Denis Lill) and of several other men, Langtry doggedly refuses a divorce--and his end is possibly just what he deserves or rather a bit more than he deserves. The very fact that I wonder about this shows how deeply I felt for these characters as I again watched this 672-minute miniseries, which was first shown on American public television in 1979.

 Actually, my fondest memories of ""Lillie"" are of the unforgettable Oscar Wilde of Peter Egan. Having seen Robert Morley, Peter Finch and others play the role, I have to call Egan's Wilde the very best. If one views only those scenes in which he appears, the price of the set would still be worth it.

 The cast list on the Internet Movie Database runs for seven pages, and I refer my readers to that website. I ran off a copy and kept it near my chair to identify familiar faces along the way, one of which was that of Jennie Linden who portrays Lillie's closest friend, Patsy Cornwallis-West.

 I will be replaying this one over the years to come. Ten stars out of ten.",1201219200,60,2531,4.693002257336343
3242659,5,B000XUF6AG,"Quite simply, one of the best BBC Classic TV Miniseries ever produced. Filmed in 1978 and to be released in a four-disc DVD set, the miniseries stars the brilliant Francesca Annis (Tommy and Tuppence, etc.) as Lillie Langtry, one of the most famous and infamous courtesans/ladies of the Victorian age.

In an era when women were to be seen and not heard, the unforgettable Lillie broke every taboo without a backward glance. The series chronicles her long life, and in so doing presents one of the best portraits of Victorian England ever filmed.

We watch Lillie as a young tomboy, grow to an awkward adolescent, a stunning woman, and a beautiful old woman. Each stage of her life is portrayed perfectly by Annis, the makeup transforming her body while her awesome talent transforms her character development as Lillie.

Lillie is one-of-a-kind, a calculating woman of immense presence, grace and substance. Unfortunately, she becomes trapped in a loveless marriage, but she devises her own way to cope.

Taking full advantage of her beauty, Lillie deliberately attracts as many as a dozen lovers and admirers including the married Prince of Wales and notorious Oscar Wilde.

As her husband slowly drinks himself to death, she relies on her looks, wiles and self-assurance in the London Society of the 1870s to embark upon a sensational career as a marginally talented actress.

With guile, Lillie creates a truly unique life of the courtesan, eventually gaining prestige by going on the stage and touring America many times over.

Throughout her life she endures financial ruin and scandal, yet maintains her celebrated lifestyle. Because Lillie lives to be a very old woman, viewers are given an honest glimpse of the Victoria Era through the span of her life.

As with every BBC miniseries dealing with period stories, the acting, staging, filming and music is all well above top notch.",1197676800,178,1890,5.035256410256411
3242660,4,B000XUF6AG,"This thirteen part Masterpiece Theatre series, which first aired in 1979, is certainly worth watching as it is quite entertaining and well done. Detailing the life and loves of the notorious Lillie Langtry, the Victorian era superstar, it gives the viewer a taste of an era gone by. Beautifully acted by a stellar cast, the production suffers only from the unfortunate lighting used in the nineteen seventies, giving the sets and actors a somewhat washed out and flat appearance. That being said, it is still a series well worth watching.

Born on the British isle of Jersey to a womanizing clergyman and his wife, Lillie is a tomboy who matures into a beautiful girl. At an early age, she marries Edward Langtry, a purportedly wealthy yachtsman from a shipping family, who takes her to live in Southampton. There, she finds life not to her liking. She soon discovers that her husband has sold her a bill of goods, as his wealth has been spent. After a bout with a serious illness, she contrives a move to London, where she is exposed to a taste of high society. After a false start, she gets noticed by the local swells and becomes a renowned beauty, sought after by all. Now, a fashionable society woman, she finds herself with her name on everyone's lips. Lillie eventually comes to the attention of the married Prince of Wales and becomes his mistress.

Trapped in her loveless marriage with the hapless and alcoholic Edward Langtry, Lillie goes on to have numerous love affairs with some of the most socially prominent and wealthy men of her day and eventually has a love child. Courted by all, her beauty and need for money brings her to the stage, where she becomes an actress with her own company. Her fame by now has spanned the ocean and made her a celebrity in America, as well as in Europe.

Lillie certainly knew the value of marketing, as she endorsed numerous products with her name. A woman ahead of her time, who marched to the beat of her own drum, she still went to great pains to avoid scandal, though it was never far from her doorstep. Alas, in the end, her fame and beauty decimated by age, her lovers dead or gone, Lillie, no longer the toast of two continents, ends up nothing more than a lonely old lady.

The cast for this production is stellar and the costumes are first rate. Francesca Annis is beautiful and certainly gives a competent performance as the notorious Lillie. Though her performance is acclaimed, however, the viewer cannot help but wonder why such a fuss was ever made over Lillie, as she comes across as supremely shallow and vapid. I attribute this to the fact that Ms. Annis' portrayal of Lillie comes across as being rather flat, failing to make her a truly likable character. Peter Egan, on the other hand, is superb as Oscar Wilde and, as far as I am concerned, steals the show. Filled with much social intrigue and witty repartee, the series will keep the viewer riveted to the screen.",1160179200,,2936,4.629558541266794

She also really nails this role of Lillie, who was billed as an actress but was even more active as a courtesan. Lillie is trapped in a loveless marriage in the Victorian Era so takes her pleasures elsewhere and amongst the extremely well known and even royal. She is also a great hit when she tours America.

Although this is all very well done by the end you realize you have watched a very long miniseries about a woman who was incredibly ambitious and prostituted herself any way she could to achieve a life of success and elegance. She may have been a bit short on talent but she more than made up for it with drive, beauty and seduction. Some viewers may prefer their biographical subjects to be a bit more admirable.

3242729,3,B000XUF6AG,"I usually enjoy British historical dramas, and Lillie shares many of the positives of similar series -- excellent acting, beautiful and historically accurate costumes and sets, and generally top production values.

But I have to say that, while I struggled through to the end, I found Lillie to be less than engaging.  The problem, I think, is with the character of Lillie.  While she is clearly the protagonist of the piece, she is not a very likeable person.  And neither she nor her story is inherently interesting enough to make her a credible antihero.

Lille  marries for money and a ticket off the island where she was born.  Hoping for an exciting life of society in London with a weatlhy husband, she quickly finds herself bored with her life in Southampton and her rather dull husband -- abd basically blackmails him into taking her to London. After a few months of boredom in London, Lillie is suddenly 'discovered' by a couple of artists, and soon finds herself (or her picture) the talk of the town.  For the next few years, Lillie's husband becomes nothing more than a meal ticket, as Lillie is painted and worshipped by everyone in society, nearly raped by a few -- and then willingly bedded by several of the top ranks (princes, millionaires...)  who also shower her with gifts ranging from houses to diamonds. When she finds she needs more money to support her lavish lifestyle and turns to acting, she again quickly begins to neglect her work in favor of spending time with her latest conquest.

 To be honest, I found myself feeling sorry for Ned (her husband) who had done nothing wrong, (his worst sins seemed to be talking a bit too much about his former wife)  but turns to alcohol to numb his pain as he is ignored by his wife and her new friends and lovers.",1419292800,4,1782,4.640127388535032

Oscar Wilde , a very prominent writer..and many more so called intellegent and powerful men ...falling into web of a seductress..ladies keeping association with ""such desirable by men"" woman just so they can bait the high profile men..well portrayed England in 19th and early 20th century..well acted as well...Particularly antonio rodgers ( as Edward Langtry)

3242765,3,B000XUF6AG,"You don't need another plot synopsis.  The question is whether you should watch (or buy/rent).

If you're looking to be entertained, you're better off with Breaking Bad, or even Lost.  What you DO get from Lillie, though, is an opportunity to watch actors working, and to watch a production company dealing with the challenges that come with trying to cram the lifetime of Lillie Langtree - a truly enigmatic, if uber-popular figure - into 13 segments of 51 minutes.

First (and foremost?), the script and ""show-running"" are clumsy, at best.  It feels like the creator(s) had a list of a couple hundred known historical bullet points of Langtree's life, and then they shot them one-after-another: ""Here's where the theater burnt down.  Here's where her horses died in a train wreck.  Here's where all her jewelry got stolen, etc.""  The production values don't help this episodic feel.  At least once per episode there's a jarring cut from one scene to the next.  Even the underscore is chopped off.  There's a second of black screen then a new scene starts.

HOWEVER, I have to say some of the acting here, particularly by the supporting characters, is worthy of study.  Peter Egan's portrayal of Oscar Wilde is probably worth the price of the DVD set by itself.  You can see in his eyes and in his manner the depth of complicated and conflicting passions beneath Wilde's devil-may-care and lightning quick-witted public persona.  You'll also enjoy other priceless little characterizations along the way.

But, this dynamic tapestry to play in front of only emphasizes the single-note playing in the titular role by Francesca Annis.  If the point of the production is to depict Lillie as superficial beauty and nothing else, well, it succeeds.  Annis won the BAFTA award in 1979, in part, for this role, and she's obviously done great work elsewhere, but this is disappointing.  She simply strikes the same chord again, and again, and again!

This is an important television series in that its popularity (with a couple of additional series) virtually saved London Weekend Television (LWT) in the late 70s, or at least postponed its demise.  Overall, the series is worth viewing as a study, but on more than one occasion I found myself checking to see how much time was left of a particular episode.  If you're expecting another Upstairs, Downstairs or I, Claudius, you're going to be disappointed.",1380844800,3,2398,4.957393483709273

I was very young when I watched the original showing, and I am afraid I fell in love with Peter Egan who played Oscar Wild!  He was so gifted in that part.  It made me reflect upon the lives and period of that time and I began studying the era.

I don't believe Lilie considered herself a ""prostitute"" as a previous review has stated.  She was a woman of that era who needed to survive and do what she could to survive.  And, definitely she did not feel unhappy or deprived!  She loved her life, with a love that most of us never know.  Indeed, she died after a life that none of us will ever achieve or know!

Francesca Annis masterfully portrays Lillie, winning her the BAFTA Best Actress award. One of the truly great Victorian historical drama- costume period stories from Masterpiece Theatre. Top Brit drama with mega stars that defy time. As good today as it was when first aired.

She then finds London society on the green. Maid Dominique (Catherine Feller) joins her in all but the first and last episodes.
---3 The Jersey Lily: Lillie becomes the hot invitee in London society--always the same dress. She's a PB (Professional Beauty of the times) attracting even the artist Whistler (Don Fellows) and poet Oscar Wilde (Peter Egan). Another friend PB is Patsy (Jennie Linden) who you'll learn to love.
---4 The New Helen: Wed 3 yrs, Lillie rebuffs a king but attracts other royalty. Is Wilde a tryst? Amidst a marriage failed.

---11 Mr. Jersey: A rich jockey affair shocks society. Lillie is beaten and gifted for her troubles, prostitution fashion. Oscar is imprisoned, Lillie divorced, and Edward asylum committed. Some of the aging make-up seems dated compared to 21st century capability, but the make-up did win a BAFTA Best Make-up for this 1978 series.

---13 Fifty Cents a Dance: King Bertie dies. Jeanne & Lillie yet estranged. World War begins and ends with no desired reconciliation. Will it ever happen in time? Two BAFTA wins and 7 nominations additional, a good show.

It's a period series, so it never goes out of style, and this one is a classic. It's good to have it made available for new audiences once again.",1351468800,3,3555,5.003378378378378
3242791,5,B000XUF6AG,"""Lillie"" tells the engaging story of the fortunes and travails of Lillie Langtry. Most well-known for having been the mistress of the Prince of Wales, Lillie as portrayed by Francesca Annis appears to be a strong, courageous woman who is not afraid to follow her own path in order to find some measure of happiness and success in her life. Unconventional in her thinking, she challenges the traditional notion of a woman's role in society as imposed upon the women of her time, and breaks free of those conventions to make a lasting mark. As the blurb on the DVD goes ""Lillie Langtry played by a new set of rules. Her own."" Francesca Annis brings tremendous depth to her role as Lillie, lending an air of vulnerability tempered with a strong will. Her other performance that I was impressed by was in another period drama&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Madame-Bovary-The-Complete-Miniseries/dp/B0000A5A1N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Madame Bovary - The Complete Miniseries</a>.",1348358400,,1020,5.673202614379085
3242792,5,B000XUF6AG,"I remember seeing this on PBS and was so excited when it was finally put in DVD format AND for a reasonable price.  This is the story - told in about 12 episodes - of the life of Lillie Langtry who began her notorious adult life as the mistress of the Prince of Wales (later he became King Edward VII).  During that time she also was the muse to artists John Everett Millais, Edward Poynter, Edward Burne-Jones and Frank Miles. When that affair ended, she became a very well-known actress.  Unfortunately, she wasn't all that good but people came to see her perform because of her notoriety.  The word we'd use for Lillie nowadays is a tramp - she used men and slept with them and in return she received access to more rich and powerful men and also plenty of money and jewelry.  She lived a relatively long life, had a daughter and died alone in Monte Carlo.

If you enjoy period English drama, love seeing the beautiful costumes, and want to get enveloped into the delicious, fabulous, tawdry, decadent, funny, sad life of a woman who reinvented herself more than once and survived the times, this is the DVD for you.

Francesa Annis is so beautiful and is truly a wonderful actress -- it was a pleasure to look at her.  All the supporting cast are so well placed in their characters that you actually think you are seeing the real people they are portraying.

Of course, there must have been great liberties taken in presenting the story since no one really knows what transpired in conversations between the real people, but this is as convincing as it gets.

In defense of Francesca Annis's performance -- she brilliantly exudes the icy coldness of, well, an icy cold beauty. It is to her credit that she resisted the tempation toward histrionics.

It was well done, directed, and acted.  Period costumes were wonderful.  London society captivated my attention.  After I watched the series, I took the time to read some of her biographical information about Lillie Langtry's real life. However, as one reviewer put it mildly, the woman pretty much prostituted herself to make her way to the top of society. I found her character to be shallow, calculating, and oddly irritating. As a result, I felt compelled to fast forward through some of the final episodes just to be done with it. I was tired of Langtry's attitude, her voice, and her actions. I had lost my respect for the woman. I'm sure London society, in all of its glamor, glitz, and royalty had its share of adultery and mistresses.  Everyone pretty much knows that Bertie was quite the risque fellow, who frequented the famous brothels of Paris on his trips besides having mistresses of his own.  Nevertheless, as great of a period piece that it was, I found myself feeling quite saddened by a life who may have been popular with the men of London, but underneath all the frills of her dresses, there appeared to be a cold and calculating heart.

Francesca Annis plays a great Lillie and does what she must do in the only ways available to her in this late victorian story to improve her life and live in the way she wishes.  She is not without her faults and has her share of disappointments and tradgedy, but manages to come through it all in fairly good shape. A very strong and brilliant woman.

Oscar Wilde was her very good friend and I loved his character.  Most of the laughs were because of his extremely witty dialogue. He is played as a kind person with amazing talent.  I have always thought he was badly mistreated and punished by a society that refused to accept anyone who was different.

Lillie's husband was typical of ""gentlemen"" of that era.  Born to wealth and when he lost it unable to cope, using his wife's talents to sustain a lifestyle he was used to.  A very sad ending for a decent, but shallow man who simply couldn't support himself.

like these period dramas set in the 19th Century .Lillie is a facinating woman and her life and times. Good costumes, settings and acting are superb and first rate. Highly recommend buying this series on DVD. Was very pleased with product and watch it often.",1294444800,,511,4.818181818181818

3242803,3,B000XUF6AG,"There are many parts in this series I enjoyed, e.g. acting, costumes and some historical facts. However, I could not help but feel extraordinary sadness about the life the ""real Lillie"" lived. The honest truth of the story is about a selfish woman who  was willing to prostitute herself on so many different levels in order to achieve fame, fortune and wealth. At the end of the day she really lived a rather hollow life.",1292976000,23,421,4.613333333333333

3242805,5,B000XUF6AG,"This series is so much fun you find yourself daydreaming about it between episodes.  Like a lot of people I watched Lillie on Masterpiece Theatre.  Though its been thirty years since I've seen it, I find that the episodes are startlingly familiar.  This miniseries is that good.

Lillie Langtree was a beautiful artist's model and an internationally famous beauty, but what made her special was her intelligence, wit and determination to keep up with the brilliant artists, writers and politicians around her.  Lillie had an instinct for drama and how to play situations so that she would remain popular for years.  Her staged argument (she put ice down the back of his shirt at a party) with the Prince of Wales showed an amazing understanding of how to make sure she was always envied and never pitied.  Lillie was an orignial and as played by Francesca Annis, her charisma is unforgetable.",1271289600,3,892,4.867549668874172
3242806,4,B000XUF6AG,"I watched this on television when I was but a very small child. I remember waiting for it weekly to come on Masterpeice Theatre and that it was hard to get the television to myself to view this series. Francesca Annis left an impression on me that I have never forgotten. This item has been on my wish list for YEARS and I am overjoyed to see it available again! I just viewed it again for the first time, as I was able to purchase a previous version through an Amazon Marketplace seller. It holds up, despite the years since its' release, due in large part by the magnificent cast, lavish sets, and strength of Ms. Annis' stunning performance. I cannot recommend this highly enough! I rated it a four only because of the strange age makeup they used on Ms. Annis, which does not hold up to the rigors of HDTV and seems to change from frighteningly plastic, to ghost white, to almost normal. The serious lack of any real extra bonus features is also a minus. I could not stop watching this until I had viewed the entire series again. Anything that will hold your attention this long and this well is a wise investment. The life of Lillie Langtry was an amazing epic journey that any woman would have traded places with her for, and it is brilliantly executed in this series! You can even stay in the home that the king had built for her to this day and visit the original saloon named after her, in the town re named for her in Texas! Facinating Character Subject? A crass understatement. Buy it and live the life of a poverty to princedom real life story!",1258070400,32,1556,4.387543252595155
3242807,5,B000XUF6AG,"This miniseries is the story of a self absorbed, self centered PB  (professional beauty) or super model as she would be known today.  Lillie Langtry later became an actress but from what little else I know about her, she couldn't hold a candle to Sarah Bernhardt or Lillian Russell.

The people who deserved her kindness and consideration didn't get it and the ones who weren't deserving of it did.  She sold her soul for jewelry, beautiful clothes, property, race horses, houses and the most intoxicating of all, social standing.  In order to continue to receive expensive jewelry from one of her many lovers, she would willingly take a beating so violent that she had to be hospitalized.  Her husband, Edward Langtry, played stunningly well by Anton Rogers, although a buffoon who lost his fortune shortly after their marriage, died alone in an asylum due to alcoholism.  Rather than consider his feelings of being overshadowed by her popularity and adultery w/the Prince of Wales (Bertie), she chose to buy him off by sending him a small amount of money each month until his death.  Oscar Wilde, the poet and playwright, played to perfection by Peter Egan, hardly worthy of the attention that she fawned on him, was taken care of by Lillie after his bankruptcy 'til the day he died.  Even her own father, a minister who was disgraced and forced to leave his church due to misconduct w/women, didn't receive any help from Lillie.  She'd say that ""it's about time that I do something for him"" but she never did.  Lillie grew up w/6 brothers and I feel that contributed to her attitude towards men, that they're to be used and cast aside when finished w/them.  I think she felt that her father deserved what he got as did her husband and that she'd make herself look good in the eyes of others but would do as little as possible to help them.  As a result of her reckless and thoughtless behavior throughout her life, her illegitimate daughter born to the Prince of Austria, was passed off as her niece who later learned her true parentage and did not speak to her mother again until just before Lillie's own passing.  Lillie never got to enjoy her daughter or grandchildren due to her own disregard for the feelings and lives of others.  She died alone and forgotten, a sad but just ending to a woman who cared for no one but herself.

Francesca Annis played the part of Lillie and although others have given her rave reviews, I feel that each part Annis plays is the same flat portrayal w/only a name change.  Compare her acting in Madame Bovary and you'll see what I mean.  She was a stunning beauty in her day so she may have been cast w/that reason uppermost.  Others outshined her in this production but I gave it 5 stars anyhow because I truly enjoyed it.",1255737600,,2762,4.6114519427402865
3242808,5,B000XUF6AG,"There are 13 episodes in this series (about 45 mins each), and I couldn't stop watching... I finished the entire series in four nights!  I love English period pieces, and this is one of my favorites.  The acting is supurb and the entire story is historically accurate...Very juicy.  If you enjoy history and salacious British drama, I promise you will love this series and want to see everything Francesca Annis has been in!  ENJOY!",1251072000,2,432,4.797297297297297
3242809,5,B000XUF6AG,"Intelligent, practical and generous, Lillie Langtry's wit, beauty, charm and ambition took her from small town life on the Isle of Jersey to London and beyond where she was the center of attention from the likes of Oscar Wilde and King Edward VII.  Forced by circumstances to work for a living, she took to the stage and had a stellar theatrical career touring all over the world. What a ride she had, and what a great story to tell!

Francesca Annis is incandescent as Lillie Langtry, and it's hard to imagine the real Lillie being any different from Ms. Annis' portrayal.  She's so good that at no point does all the praise and attention she garners as Lillie become incredible. The supporting characters are equally wonderful and I'll warn anyone who purchases this set--don't start watching it unless you have time to finish it--you won't want to stop until the end.

As always in one of these series from the Golden Age of the BBC, every detail of set and costume is perfect, as is the writing. This is a great accompaniment to the series Edward the King (in which Francesca Annis appears as Lillie Langtry), and the marvelous Jennie, with Lee Remick though the second is not available on DVD.",1246665600,2,1198,4.6635071090047395

3242812,5,B000XUF6AG,"It's true, that great care was not taken at the time of shooting, but you will get past all that as you become caught up in the performances and story. Consider the slightly poor production quality as a rift in time as you become an onlooker right by the side of the characters. Hopefully at some point, a film archivist will doctor the original production. Don't know why it hasn't already been done.

Having watched ""Lillie"" on ""Masterpiece Theatre"" as a teenager, I was immediately captivated by Peter Egan's Oscar Wilde, especially, and sought to learn more about Wilde, Langtry, and all their artistic peers and royalty in this amazing era in history. Calling Francesca Annis' performance ""flat"" ( per the reviewer in the product description section) is disgraceful. She is BRILLIANT and at her best in this drama. In fact, everyone is impeccably cast.

If you're an Anglophile, lover of history (especially the Victorian era), or love a great drama that will sweep you away into another place and time, you will relish the experience of ""Lillie.""",1230249600,3,1052,4.904494382022472
3242813,5,B000XUF6AG,"This was the first of the BBC mini-series I watched as a young adult (having missed Upstairs and the original Forsythe Saga while in college).  What a fantastic production.  The professional review may have found her flat; we find Annis' performance perfect.  Having seen her on stage (ironically in a Wilde production), I can vouch for her talent, which is more than obvious here. Peter Egan is incredible - I so wish he had done much much more on film at the time. This is one of the series we rewatch on a regular basis and enjoy every time.  This, along with Edward the King and Duchess of Duke Street, are the apex of the British mini-series era.  What an age!",1221091200,8,665,4.462809917355372
3242814,5,B000XUF6AG,"I adored this production when it first aired on Masterpiece Theater in the '70's.  I was a little aprehensive about buying it because I'd read previous reviews from when it was released on VHS.  Reviews at that time said the image quality wasn't very good due to production standards at that time.  Consequentially, I was extremely please when I sat down to watch Lillie on DVD and found the quality to be quite good.  Some will, no doubt, complain that it's not as sophisticated as today's Masterpiece Theater productions.  I would argue that the quality of acting offsets those criticisms.  Also, the story line is terrific (you couldn't make this stuff up) and the costumes worn by Ms. Annis are superb. Some critics have hailed Stephen Fry's performance in the movie ""Wilde"" as the ultimate Oscar...I, however, will take Peter Egan's Oscar any day!",1217980800,6,852,4.881944444444445

It is fairly true to historical fact, has great characterizations with well developed characters, GREAT acting, amazing costumes, and good directing. It evolves very nicely. I like historical fact and fiction. I love English history because it is so robust. The Victorian times were fasinating as women were beginning to realize they did have sexual needs and were coming to their own. They used men just as much as men used them in that regard. Some women out there might say that the representation was sexist, but in historical context that was the way it was. Do you think times have really changed in this dance between men and women? Like Lillie, you just have to be the leader while the male things he is.",1518825600,,781,4.625899280575539
