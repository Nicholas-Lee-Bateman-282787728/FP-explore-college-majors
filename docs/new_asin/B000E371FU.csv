8105009,5,B000E371FU,True account of Buddy Holly's life and music...done very well with Biography's staff.  A must for Buddy Holly fans!,1435104000,,115,5.052631578947368
8105010,5,B000E371FU,"Highly recommended for those younger people who are ""new"" to the great Buddy Holly, as well as for those Baby-Boomers who remember him vaguely, or otherwise have let 50 years of a busy life push his brilliantly creative music and talent to the faded background of their memories. Harry Smith does a good job with his even-handed yet captivating narration, and the editors make the most of the very limited amount of surviving film and photographs of Buddy Holly and the Crickets, 1956-59. For the real Buddy Holly ""experts"" and long-time afficionados, then the Paul McCartney video tribute, although older, will likely be more satisfying. But this A&E Biography version has nothing to apologize for, and does a fine job in presenting Buddy's story, and the tragedy of his premature death in the Feb 3, 1959 plane crash near Clear Lake, Iowa.",1216684800,2,841,4.929577464788732
8105011,5,B000E371FU,another great dvd on a fantastic singer. it is so nice to see the history ti a great musician. where could the music have gone if not for early death. highley recomended,1158105600,,169,4.3125
8105012,4,B000E371FU,"It was great but overall Paul McCartney's version {the Real Buddy Holly Story} was a more enjoyable experience. A lot of the film clips and iterviews are duplicated save one- the interview with Buddy's widow, Maria Elaina. Paul did not interview Maria Elaina, but chose to interview the widow of Norman Petty who was Buddy's manager. The Rave on version clearly puts the blame for Buddy's death on Norman Petty. The McCartney version was more concerned with the music and how they came up with the arrangements. Still, Rave on is a good historical record with a little added material and original flim clips. The dedicated fan will enjoy this.",1157068800,14,643,4.8545454545454545
