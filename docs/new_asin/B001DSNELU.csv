3537971,4,B001DSNELU,"Brings back fond memories of a simpler time in my childhood.  Those were the days when every red-blooded boy of African descent knew in their heart of hearts that when we grew up, we were gonna become rich just so we could take Thelma out of the ghetto...then Keith showed up & ruined our plans.

Seriously, it was always a great show, and i do understand some of the things that upset John Amos and Esther Rolle enough to leave the show (it appeared that those of our persuasion were almost always the subject of buffonery, even when tackling the serious subjects Good Times touched on over the years), but what i never did understand was the backlash that occured in later years, where people associated with the show developed shame because of it.  This show was nothing to be ashamed of, not even the bug-eyed clowning of J.J.

Regarding this release, it's all here!  J.J. drug-addicted fiancee, pregnant girlfriend (by somebody else), and V.D. scare (look for a youthful Jay Leno & his chin in a guest-spot in this episode).  Thelma's romance with Ibe, her romance with the guy on work release, her romance with...aww, hell, ALL her romances.  Michael's militant stance and the famous phrase, ""'Boy' is a white racist word!""  And of course, the murder of a father figure (i call it murder because that's what it was...corporate murder of the black male figurehead.  Some can't understand & some just won't understand.  For instance, my 12 year old still teases my wife & i for getting teary-eyed over the line, ""damn, Damn, DAAAAAAAMN!"")

My one complaint is a small one, but i must say the packaging design leaves a little to be desired.  The DVDs are stacked so that you can't remove one without having to remove all the previous ones.  If this were made different, along with descriptions of the episodes to make finding them eaiser, it would be the perfect package. Still, for the prive, it's unbeatable.",1244419200,53,1913,4.725903614457831
3537972,5,B001DSNELU,"i remember very well when this series began. i was a teen-ager and there was nothing else on television like it. eventhough i could identify somewhat with the ups and downs that the ""evans family"" situations portrayed, i just couldn't deal with the stereotyping of the show. i grew up in the neighborhood in which this show was ""set"" and the projects earlier on did not look that way. they only became that way later on. and the sort of questions that people who had never lived in a neighborhood like that would ask were ridiculous.
what the show literally was about was a family struggling to survive. the chosen setting/s was a housing project in chicago, which i understand are now mostly gone. the infamous cabrini-green housing projects.
""james evans"" the patriarch of the family was a strong father figure who took every kind of mediocre job under the sun to support his family, while his wife, ""florida evans"" was a stay home wife, {she went to work after james was killed in a car accident, at the beginning of season four}who was always trying to keep her husband encouraged through his ups and downs. then there were ""jj"" the wise cracking oldest son. followed by ""thelma"" the only daughter, who was always mercilously teasing ""jj"" about how ugly he was. then there was ""michael"" the militant brain of the children, who was always ready to challenge and debate someone about something.
my all around favarite episodes were in season three when a love interest for thelma was introduced, ""larry,"" played by ""carl franklin."" he was only in two and i wish there had been a more developing of his character. in the first episode he appears in he and thelma are very much in love and they want to get married, against james's wishes, that is. then he gives in and allow them to get engaged, eventhough ""thelma"" gives ""larry"" his ring back.
then in the second and last episode that he appears in, ""thelma"" feels that she and ""larry"" are growing apart and she is not sure what to do about it. then the decision is made when ""larry"" gets a call from his uncle, in california, giving him an opportunity to go there and work with him in his garage, which would earn him a partnership in the business. ""larry"" wants ""thelma"" to go with him, as his wife of course, but she don't want to go. the way she gets out of the relationship with ""larry"" was rather poignant and sad, though it was probably meant to be funny.
here is a thought, in season six, instead of just having ""thelma"" to meet and marry keith, why not create some sort of love triangle, by bringing back ""larry."" she could have maybe been out shopping for her wedding and runs into him. he could be back because his uncle died and left him the business, netting him millions of dollars. now with his fortune he is in just as good of a position to offer her a secured future.
she is now readily confused because she has accepted ""keith's"" proposal, who is an up and coming football star. or she can go with ""larry"" whom she never really quite got over. maybe ""larry"" could have shown up at the church and interrupted the wedding before the ""i do."" or something else interesting could have been added. i just did not like the way season six ended. it just seemed unfinished in my opinion, as if the entire staff was just ready to give it up. i think when a show has a ""planned ending"" it can sometimes end better than it does.
oh come on! a baby for ""thelma"" and she and ""keith"", along with ""willona"" and ""penny"" with mom in tow, all wind up in the same neighborhood, by accident! oh gees. and how come ""florida"" was absent for season five because she is off on her honeymoon, but reappears in season six without so much as a mention of her husband? did the writers think that the viewers had forgotten about her ""recent remarriage?"" ""jj"" moves up and out and ""michael"" goes off to college. come on! i agree the series had to end some how but how come everything had to happen ""literally"" on the same day. i just wish that some of the ""endings"" had been a bit spreaded out, and perhaps made ""jj"" a bit more exciting too. like why not have him to have become engaged to one of his girlfriends! i vote for the plumber. wasn't her name ""tc""?{the second one, not the first one}
i'm just not happy with the way this series ended. however, that was thirty years ago. ""florida evans"" played by ""esther rolle"" past away eleven years ago. so even if their roles could be reprised, ""florida"" would have to be recast. but so what! other television shows have been redone or updated. why not good times. just give them some kids and problems and they will be right in step with everyone else.
oops! i forgot to talk alittle bit about season four. this is the season in which ""john amos"" who played ""james evans"" character was killed off the show. i did not like the way this was done. why not have him to have died at the end of season three. then open season four with his funeral. to me, that would have made more sense. and it would have been a good cliffhanger. eventhough i bought the entire series last year at the end of march, i still have not really viewed all of them.
eventhough everyone at the time liked ""jj"" played by ""jimmie walker,"" i liked ""james."" i think he was doing a great service for the black community by playing a strong father figure who was always there and available to and for his family, in spite of their lack of money and his lack of education. as i said elsewhere in this review, this show i felt sometimes stereotyped us, as a race of people. but it still had the one thing it needed the most: a strong patriarch at the head of the family.",1243468800,,5622,4.411934552454283

3537974,5,B001DSNELU,Great DVD set - took me right back to the 70's when this show was popular.  Great laughs - great viewing and happy to see environmentally friendly packaging!,1238544000,,157,4.607142857142857
3537975,5,B001DSNELU,"It is wonderful that Sony Pictures has released ""Good Times-The Complete Series"". Not only do we get the entire library of shows that were produced, which were 133, but we as consumers get an excellent deal. Buying or bidding on the individual sets can be costly and frustrating, but this set comes to us at a great price.
 ""Good Times"" was one of Norman Lear's favorite shows that he produced. Many critics called it ""one of the best sitcoms ever made"". Airing from February 8, 1974-August 1, 1979, ""Good Times"" originally aired on CBS when African-American comedies starting debuting on network TV. Shows like ""The Jeffersons"" and ""Sanford and Son"" were extremely popular, but ""Good Times"" was special because it was mainly about a family trying to make it in the world. It didn't matter that they had no money or didn't live in an elaborate apartment, the Evans had each other and that's all that mattered.
 The series was a spin-off of another Lear show called ""Maude"", which was a spin-off of ""All in The Family"". The cast was filled with amazing talent like Esther Rolle, John Amos (who is one of my favorite actors period), Janet DuBois, Jimmy Walker, and others, and the writing was top-notch. Even to this day the series is relevant, as in the  2000's there are many that can't afford to pay bills, and have a hard time making ends meet.
 The series became a top 10 hit in its second year on the air, and it eventually lost viewers because CBS kept changing the nights it aired the show. John Amos quit the series at the end of the 1975-1976 season because he wasn't happy with the scripts, and in the following year Esther Rolle left due to a salary dispute. Luckily she returned for the show's final year. Janet Jackson starred in ""Good Times"" last 2 seasons playing a child being battered by her mother. And fortunately, the series had a proper ending in August, 1979. I won't say how the series ended, but it ended on a high note.
 The episodes are restored in pristine condition. They come in a box where they are piled on top of one another, so be extremely careful with the dics when taking them out. I will not complain about the packaging, because lets face it, this is a wonderful deal on a wonderful TV show. Televison was so good back in the '70's. TV today is filled with so much reality crap that it's nice to have DVD's and watch classic and entertaining shows. Thank you Sony!!!",1238025600,3,2403,4.540415704387991

I made the mistake with the Cosby Show of buying all 8 seasons one by one as they came out. Very expensive to say the least, just like they still sell good times by season at an astronomical price.

I would give the series 5 stars because it's funny, entertaining and takes me back to a time when I wasn't even born! I give this particular set 4 stars mostly because of the packaging (the box the dvd's are stored in). All of the dvd's are stacked on top of one another with nothing to divide them which means you have to treat them very well in order to keep them safe and clean. The disc are stacked on top of one another and if you watch disc one, finish it and want to watch disc 5 then you have to remove disc 1 through 4 to get to five.

It is compact with all the discs housed in one box.  The quality of the discs are excellent and I only noted a slightly hollow, echoing sound on a couple of the episodes.  The color is excellent and I'm not seeing any of the graininess I've seen on a couple of the TV series I've purchased in the past.  The only drawback is that all the discs are stacked upon one another in a plastic case.  A little tender loving care will prevent scratches.

3537997,1,B001DSNELU,"Well, these are put out by a different company than the stand-alone seasons - and the quality his disappeared!  First, this company has done something that you do not expect - they cheapened the quality and highly compressed the episodes!

The stand-alones may take up more space and even cost more, but at least with those, you get the best quality, although I would imagine that even they could do better, but THIS one does worse!  I had season 1 which were spread across two discs, but this one has season 1 one ONE DVD - how cheap can you get?  Of course this means that they highly compressed the shows to fit on the disc, which they did not even bother to maximize the size (~7.5 GB).

In the one put out by Sony, you see and hear a clear difference in quality.  The Sony looks like most TV show DVD's look - better than the original broadcast!  This version has darker colors, darker picture, less details, the episodes are not in original air date order AND the start of the shows do not start with: ""Live from Century City, CA..."" or something to that effect - then the show begins!  This one cuts those out (presumably to save time on and space for the compression) so they are not even giving you the full deal.

Yes, I too wanted to have the complete season in one set, condense to free up space - but who would have thought that the quality would have to suffer?  How did this show get put in the hands of this DVD producer?  Who in their right mind would cut down the quality?  I won't even talk about the cheap cardboard sleeves - which is another sign of how much the studio cheapened out on presentation!  I returned mine, and I would advise all to stay away from this and hunt down the original from Sony/Paramount!  Those are the ones with the quality.

In this day and age of Blu-Ray and 4K, I don't want compressed DVD's, I prefer max quality.  If they could improve the picture, I would buy it on Blu-Ray, but I know shows recorded on video (as opposed to film) are kind of maxed out as it is, but if they could improve the quality with better techniqies and only used two or so BD discs - even better!

Oh yeah - like others have noted, the first disc won't allow you to choose to play or pick episodes - nothing happens!  I had to do something out of order like pressing the home button, then it started playing, but I still could not choose what I wanted.  Get the Sony version on the YELLOW BOX instead - trust us!",1513555200,3,2440,4.253796095444685

I watched this show along with All In The Family, The Jeffersons, and good ole Sanford And Son. Love these shows that first depicted white/black attitudes in the '70s before we ever were really around each other very often. I'm a white male and I thought the shows did a good job of introducing race to America. Certainly only a television show, it couldn't begin to change people in a society where racism is institutionalized, but it did begin some dialog that made a few people begin to see the terrible effects racism has on society. Now, we've regressed once more. I can only hope this last horrible election, giving us a pseudo-fascist forces us to take another look at this mess in America. People are people and it's time we care about each other. Period. This show is still delightful to watch. The only bad thing is that cheap packaging. Too flimsy for such a grand show. So I'm buying two blu ray cases, each holding 6 units and putting together my own greatly improved product. Blu Ray because the bottom of this package pokes out at the bottom about half an inch where the product just literally FALLS OUT!  The outer box which is still thin itself will house blu ray boxes just right. And I hope, snugly. That will jack up the cost about double.

Also I do not like how you remove the DVD from the paperback sleeve it seems as I am scratching the DVD that aggravates me!  The exterior of the case should have made with the regular hard case and each individual dvd clicked on as I have my rest of the other dvds I own, like I said the show picture, sounds and lighting is great just the case I'm not happy with",1484265600,,606,3.9917355371900825

3538045,5,B001DSNELU,"Santa brought the complete Good Times collection to my 10-year-old son for Christmas this year.  When I originally mentioned the present to my wife, she was pretty sure that our son wouldnt like the series much at all.  Its old and from a time thats long gone.  But, I remembered how much I used to love watching the re-runs of Good Times that were on the air when I was growing up in the late 70s and early 80s.  We live in a fairly wealthy, primarily white, neighborhood and my son has never really experienced what its like to be poor.  Not that watching Good Times is going to give him that sort of experience, but I thought the lessons and themes portrayed in the series would be good for our son to learn about.  The very same problems that existed back then are still around today, and have probably gotten a bit worse, and people certainly haven't changed much at all.  Good wholesome television like this is pretty hard to come by, especially nowadays.  When my son opened the present on Christmas morning, he was completely not thrilled about it at all.  He'd never heard of Good Times before and the people pictured on the packaging didn't interest him much.  After Christmas, my son wanted to go to Toys-R-Us to blow a gift card that seemed to be burning a hole in his pocket on another video game for his new gaming system.  He had already got a bunch of video games for Christmas, but after a few days, the newness of them was starting to wear off.  I said to him, You know what you need?  A Good Times marathon.  He seemed to think it was some sort of punishment for the first-world problem he was complaining about.  I popped in the first disk, and he was not happy, but he sat through the first episode without pouting and retreating to his room.  By the second episode, he was completely hooked and now he loves the show.  He wakes up early before school, with me, just to watch more Good Times.  He did ask me why James Senior is always looking for a job.  I replied Thats what happens when you don't have an education or skills that separate you from everyone else.  First lesson learned.  My son really likes J-J the most.  Id imagine he won't be able to talk about this series much with his friends at school, but maybe thats not such a bad thing after all.",1483488000,13,2279,4.350710900473934

But after owning it for a few years I felt like not having the complete set (especially the ""Damn"", ""Damn"", ""Damn"" episode when the family found out James had been killed in a car accident) was 'cheating' myself so I set out to find the final 3 seasons but without any luck.  It was at that point that I decided to 'bite the bullet' so to speak and just buy the entire box set (at a VERY good price) even though I had the first 3 seasons.  So now I feel 'complete' when I go to view an episode.  The show wasn't 'bad' after the ""James"" character was killed off but it felt a little different to me and not quite as good but after viewing many of the ""After James Years"" I realized I liked many of those episodes more than I realized so owning them all was just the way to go!",1461024000,2,901,4.044943820224719

3538141,4,B001DSNELU,"It was the late 70s when I first watched good times on black and white tv. Even though I was quite young and my english wasn't so good, I drive a great thrill from watching the episodes. Then I got the opportunity to watch good times again from tv Africa in the late nineties. Since then, I was hooked. I kept asking about good times from every online video store in my country until I gave up. Then I remembered amazon and was thrilled to see a collection of complete episodes of good times.
Its not just about comedy, its about family, about black man's hopes, aspirations, limitations, frustrations and his future. I remembered how Jon Amos got visibly excited at the prospect of making money for his family through advertising a ""health tonic"" and when the product turned out to be alcoholic,  how that very sweet looking woman and a strong mother figure Esther Rolle, stood firmly to say no.
I remembered how the family stood firmly to say no when Thelma brought a 42 year old man home as her prospective husband.  If it was here in Africa where I live, the reverse would be the case; I mean in some African cultures, the parents would be the ones persuading Thelma to marry the man. He could be 52 or even 62, all the parents would care about is the benefits they will drive from such a venture and how much money Thelma will inherit if her older husband kicks the bucket!

3538153,5,B001DSNELU,"Since this is solely my review, I'm not sure what I can say here that has not already been said! I ordered this series because I remember watching it as a kid growing up. There items I love to see in the show that I wish still existed today (like people helping each other, families actually sitting down together and paying attention to each other instead of their cell phones, pantyhose).

I also like the values of the show. It amazes me how religion was mixed in and no one seemed to carry. It was ok to express one's faith with no recourse. Punishing your child was ok, because it was YOUR child. Lessons to be learned by children and adults alike. I found myself laughing at some of the silly things and tearing up over things I could relate to. And of course, who could forget Florida's famous ""Damn, damn, damn!"" scene? Gets me every time!

One of my childhood favorites, makes me realize how much I wish families now could sit down and see how families functioned when they were poor, only had each other to rely on, made do with what they had, and had to pay REAL attention to each other before cell phones took over. If you want a good comedy that will teach you some life lessons, I would recommend this series. I personally love it. And if you do not like my review and it is not helpful, I invite you to leave a comment as to why because everyone else has already covered the basics, this is just my review of  a series I happen to really like to watch.",1455753600,,1467,4.26978417266187

As some point out, the discs are basically compacted into as small a box as they could get and it seems disorganized upon opening it. There are a total of 11 discs, numbered 1-11. I suggest you get a small cake spindle to stack them in, I found it most convenient for storage and no need to load up on cases. One point, the picture is in full frame but it does not up-convert to near high definition quality like most DVDs. If you watch this series on TV they have only partial screen picture but with these discs it is full screen. The picture quality is somewhat grainy yet tolerable. With so many episodes, I went to the IMDB and made up a list for each season and each episode by name to check off so I can watch them from the opening season in 1974 to the final season in 1979.

Second, when I start watching I see it has no closed captions. It makes absolutely no sense why the individual releases of 1-4 have the captions but this set doesn't.

I do see that some of the episodes are out of order. For example on season one, the first episode of the series is actually ""Getting Up The Rent"" not ""Too Old Blues""... So I would suggest to find an episode guide online just to make sure you are watching it in order, but other than that I have no complaints... Great Price for a Great Show!",1449878400,4,448,4.090909090909091
3538174,5,B001DSNELU,I used to watch a lot of this show on TV One on the weekends and I thought it was a feel good hilarious television sitcom.  Now I'm glad to say I have this and I enjoy watching the episodes from beginning (I actually just started LOL).  This is a good seventies sitcom that is a spin off of Maude it features the life of Florida Adams and her family.  I love watching this show and if you are a fan you'll enjoy this too.,1449705600,,421,3.929411764705882
3538175,5,B001DSNELU,"I have the first two seasons but have wanted to have the entire collection. I found them here and went for it. I love the show when it first came out and still do. I like how the show is about getting along with what you have, dealing with day to day life and of course back then the economy was in the crapper. I enjoy the scraps with the brothers and sister and how they always end up close again. I love how the father always is a hard worker and doing the best he can for his family. I would say this is a great show for all people to watch and can teach some good values at the same time.",1449532800,,593,3.8292682926829267
3538176,1,B001DSNELU,"ABYSMAL ""New & Improved"" stiff cardboard sleeve packaging in a flimsy outer box as of December 2015. Half the discs are badly scratched. Not even worth seeking a replacement because half of the discs in that one will be scratched. Everybody and their brother knows that putting discs in cardboard sleeves is the absolute worst packaging possible. Your discs arrive scratched and will be scratched further every time you remove or replace the discs in them.

How is Mill Creek not aware of this? Guess they enjoy getting loads of product returned for refund, like mine will be. I don't pay new prices for scratched-up, used-looking junk. People complain about getting multi-disc sets on a spindle, but that's a DREAM compared to this. Those crummy paper sleeves with the cellophane window are better than this. Giving them a good slap shot across the carpet is better than this. Terrible job here, I will never buy any set from Mill Creek packaged like this because it is completely pointless, unless you're the type who uses DVDs for coasters anyway and won't mind the damage.",1448928000,8,1076,4.879781420765028

I would have given this item an five star rating what decreased my rating is how the cd's are stored. They should include in the description the cd's do not have individual cd cases by season (that I'm just spoiled to having), all season's are in a plastic tray like compartment with all the season's 1-6 combined stacked on top each other.  As I was watching an epoxide on the couch stretching out my lil' foot knocked the case onto the floor ...and you guess it splat! Went almost all the cd's either under the couch or table (do you NOW see the importance of individual cases, Sony?). So what can I do? Luv the show don't luv the it's storage solution.

3538307,4,B001DSNELU,"I'm an ardent TV show DVD collector so I've received numerous sets where the DVDs were shaking around in the package because the plastic piece that goes through the middle of the disc was broken.  This is the first time I've received a DVD set on a spindle and I honestly have to say that I don't see what some people are complaining about.  I personally find the packaging more secure as there is nothing to break and the discs can't shift around in the package and become scratched.  As long as you're careful removing and putting back the discs and continue to use the cardboard piece that goes on top of the spindle, your discs should stay scratch free.

Because of the bad reviews regarding this type of packaging, I've been hesitant to purchase slim packaged sets in the past, however, if they are all like this set I would purchase in a heartbeat in the future.  The more space I can save, the more sets I can collect.  My brother said I need a 12 step program, but I can quit purchasing any time I want (I just don't want to at the moment, but I've cut down :-).

The picture quality and sound were good, however, I was a bit disappointed that so far (I'm currently watching the 3rd or 4th season) only the first season contained subtitles.  If you grew up watching this show as I did, you'll love this set.",1333065600,8,1315,4.338775510204082

Its fun to sit and watch the facial expressions of the cast as they try to keep a straight face at some hilarious situations that they find themselves in. The chemistry that this cast had together infront of the camera was remarkable and well chosen. I also loved the way they always ended the show on a ""positive and/or happy"" note(even with the touching subject matter). The packaging of this ""complete series"" is great. One box holding all 17 discs conserves space on the self. I highly recommend this item. You are sure to have ""Good Times"" with ""Good Times"".",1316217600,,750,4.522058823529412

The Evans family are warm wonderful people and it's that charm that makes this series a true winner.
I loved this entire box and found the episodes carried some right on topics and it was a nice surprise seeing baby Janet Jackson as Penny.
Jimmie Walker aside as J.J. I felt it was the entire cast that made this show from John Amos stern but strong father figure to spiritually strong Mom, Ester Rolle.
There are some interesting cameos of future stars too from Carl Weathers (Rocky), Louis Gossett Jr (Enemy Mine) to past stars Matthew ""Stymie"" Beard (Our Gang aka The Little Rascals).
Good Times is good entertainment that is funny but also hammers home strong messages about life too, so right on, buy it.",1307923200,3,890,4.466257668711656

It's a great T.V series for the whole family to watch just for the simple fact that it helps you figure alot of things out that involves depression, poverty, racism, and many other trials and tribulations that we all face in the world.

The only minor little thing I didn't like is that the discs come all stacked on eachother, I read about that in the reviews before hand and decided to buy a little cd case to keep them in, and that is what I have been doing, and it keeps them safer rather then them being stacked upon eachother.",1300924800,,608,3.872

3538348,5,B001DSNELU,"I own this DVD set and have watched the series several times from beginning to end. I enjoyed all the seasons,even the more serious episodes and intend to review each season individually someday. This review is to comment not on each season as a whole but on Good Times as a whole. We start of mid decade with a complete family,including three children either in or beginning adolescence. There's a mother and a father looking always trying (and often unsuccessfully) to get his family out of the projects. By the final season the oldest children of the family were in school,engaged and/or gainfully employed....yet were all still living in the exact same project. In terms of familiarity this helped people to keep themselves involved in the series. In terms of Norman Lears ""tell it like it is"" attitude it's a bit flawed. All it took was a conversation with one of my friends well aware of that sort of living environment to realize that one family would be doubtful to live in the same project for six years with little change as the children began to prosper and move up in the world. I do realize they lost their breadwinning (sort of) father mid series but still to be entirely accurate it might've been better if the Evans family had moved out from that apartment they occupied...say after the fathers passing onto one slightly better place after another until they really were ""out of the ghetto"". The show could've still dealt with tough issues,even economic ones if this had been the case. Even so for what this show provided almost all the other issues and family situations dealt with in the show were pretty accurate and a lot of the times very entertaining. This baught the trials and tribulations of lower class life in the persona of an African American family into American homes without resorting to a lot of well know stereotypes of that side of life. And unlike actress Esther Rolle I wasn't bothered by JJ's comic antics. They served as a sense of release from the occasionally serious tone of the show and,several times provide the lone ""comedy"" element to the proceedings. He was not from episode to episode the only comic element. Often enough the comedy came from observational wit about the real life dialema's fast by the characters. It's an excellent TV show and more than worth anyones time to check out,especially if they're wondering where all the complaints by their elders about the ""junk on TV today"" actually comes from.",1270771200,,2457,4.769953051643192
3538349,5,B001DSNELU,The item arrived in excellent time and in great condition. It was a great tool to not only show my  children a piece of my childhood entertainment but it was also a great source for family time together! My family and I absolutely love it. It's Dynomite!,1269302400,,254,4.404255319148936
3538350,4,B001DSNELU,I was very pleased with this box set.  And the price was a steal for 133 episodes.  Unfortunately I realized I liked GOOD TIMES more as a child than I do as an adult.  I also realized that the producers made a grave mistake when they did away with the James Evans character.  John Amos was fantastic as the patriarch of the household.,1264809600,,334,4.253968253968254
3538351,5,B001DSNELU,"This show brought back a lot of great memories for me, from a simpler (yet somehow much deeper) time in television history. As a young white kid growing up in the suburbs, this show was phenomenal to me in offering a glimpse into the struggles (and joys) of a poor black family on the south side of Chicago. We really had such a wonderful mixture of environments on TV in the '70s and 80s (suburbia, urban, rich, poor, even middle class). Today we have more channels, but less variety and creativity. James and Florida Evans come off as real people, thanks in part to the excellent performances of Esther Rolle and John Amos. James Evans was probably one of my favorite TV characters of all time. His range could make you want to laugh and cry all within the same scene. I was pleased to see Good Times released as a ""Complete Series"", despite the somewhat less that ideal packaging. The lower price might introduce a new generation to a series that tackled issues of crime, teen pregnancy, drug abuse, death, life, and everything in between- all while being hilariously funny. Having owned 2 of the seasons on dvd before this release, I decided to go ahead and sell those to get the complete series, and was glad that I did. I'm considering getting some protective sleeves to keep the discs in, but for the price this series really can't be beat. Also pick up ""Sanford & Son"" which is offered the same way- no frills, but a complete series. The humor, the gritty subject matter, even the ""theatrical style"" of the period (taped before a live studio audience) that gives it almost the feel of a broadway play rather than a 30 minute sit-com make it miles away from today's reality shows or police dramas. It can truly be said of Good Times that it shined bright in TV's last great Golden Age.",1262131200,7,1792,4.533950617283951
3538352,5,B001DSNELU,"I felt compelled to do a review because of some of the complaints about the packaging. The whole idea is to be able to own the entire series at a reasonable price, and that means compact, no frills packaging. I am very pleased with my set. The discs are nicely stacked (on a spindle) and secured in the box. If you are careful with your DVDs, you won't have a problem. It's also a good idea to keep the cardboard cover on the discs for added security if you aren't going to buy sleeves.

The inside has the title of each episode listed for every disc. There is no synopsis, but if you are a fan of the show the titles give the hint you need in most cases. You can get a complete description of every show just by going on the internet, and then print the episode guide from the site you like best. Doesn't seem like much effort to me.

I wish Sony would do everyone a favor and do all their series like this, especially the ones that apparently aren't going to be finished (The Jeffersons, Maude, Different Strokes, etc, etc). Their costs would be lower and fans would get their shows in their ENTIRETY. Not just a few seasons and vanish when sales aren't what Sony would like.

On a final note the picture quality and sound are just fine, especially if played on a blu ray player with good upconversion. And how sweet it is not to have to watch a bunch of clueless commercials that networks edit the shows in favor of (although I did pay $45 just 2 weeks ago when it is now $30, thanks Amazon!).",1261958400,45,1496,4.242105263157895
3538353,5,B001DSNELU,"I loved watching Good Times when it came out in the 70's. It was a joy to see a family of color that had both parents raising up their children. It was a refreshing change back during that time as their were not many (if hardly any) shows that depicted families of color and especially a family that is what we call black (as a race, that is). I was especially pleased to be able to get the whole series in the packaging it comes in. The titles are covered on the inside packaging which makes it very easy to find your favorite show for each season. The price was  reasonable as well.",1261958400,,584,4.168141592920354

The only reason for the lower review is the show itself. My memories of the show were as a young child and looking back now it's not as funny as I remembered it. There is still a long way to go before I get to watch all the episodes - if I make it that far, so hopefully the later series mature a bit. It must have been cutting edge stuff for its day raising issues that previously may have been considered taboo. Interesting but not hilarious.",1252454400,9,589,4.267857142857143
3538356,4,B001DSNELU,"I remember this show from my pre-teen years..i loved it then, and love it now.
The audio and picture quality of this DVD collection are fairly good, so only a fussy audiophile might find something to complain about. Otherwise, you'll love re-living those great episodes from the 70's :)",1250726400,,286,4.857142857142857

8294753,4,B001DSNELU,Loved the series when it first came on TV. Hope they all play. The packaging the discs were stored in was sure beat up. Looks like I have had this since the 70's with the cover box dented everywhere and corners peeled back. :(,1520121600,,226,4.159090909090909
