8273572,2,B0019D38UG,"After attacking Jehovah (yes, *that* Jehovah) in his ""The Root of All Evil"", atheist top dog takes on a far more difficult (and moving?) target in ""Enemies of Reason"". Yes, it's Dick vs. the New Age, old school version, in a two-episode showdown with the Absolute. Weekly horoscopes, homeopathic medicine and your friendly neighborhood dowser next door gets slammed by the Intellectual Muscle Movement. The indefatigable Darwin, er, Dawkins also interviews people (or selfish gene machines) who claim that chakras are mini-black holes, that the rockness of a rock is a spiritual quality, that quantum physics prove faith healing works, and that Dawkins doesn't have an angel gently hovering above him. He never wrestles with the serpent power, but then, Mr Dawkins have never met U.G. Krishnamurti! And yes, I love the man's colorful language, as when he calls Satish Kumar a representative of the ""sandal-wearing end of the Green movement"".

:D

OK, jokes aside, but this was weaker than I expected. But sure, my worldview is very different from that of Dawkins, a rather strict reductionist and materialist. For starters, I thought Deepak Chopra's statements actually made some kind of sense. So did the statements by Satish Kumar about ""rockness"" and ""treeness"". Often, Dawkins attacks the lower end of various alternative claims: weekly sun sign horoscopes rather than, say, Gauquelin or Jung, amateur dowsers trying to find a hidden bottle during a double-blind test, rather than people doing research on ""ley lines"", etc. While I understand Dawkins' anger at obviously frivolous claims (a bunch of colored lamps can supposedly re-energize your chakras), he never really tries to understand the spiritual worldviews he is attacking, most of the time simply assuming that they just *can't* be correct, since he doesn't immediately grasp their method or terminology. It's all ""metaphor"" or ""poetry"", and that's that. In his reductionist worldview, everything above B F Skinner and double-blind tests of vaccines is just subjective mumbo jumbo. He never ask why ""placebo"" would work at all, if our minds aren't somehow capable of influencing our bodies. As for ""anecdotal evidence"", why are experiences of spirits ""anecdotal"", while the observation of animal behavior in the wild isn't? (Well, very often it *is* seen as anecdotal, making the behavior of lab rats more scientifically significant than what's going on in the real world.)

Dawkins points out that the ancient world knew less about medical science than we do, but does that mean they didn't get anything right? The Ten Commandments come from ""the Bronze Age document"" known as the Bible (which also implies that the world is flat and standing still in the center of the universe), the idea of universal human rights is based on Stoicism and Christianity and was codified in 16th century Spain at a time when Copernicus was still seen as controversial, and abolitionism grew politically strong when evolutionary biologists like Haeckel claimed that certain races were inferior. Besides, the ancient world might have known more about that accursed ""placebo effect"" than we do, precisely because they didn't have access to modern medicine. I think Dawkins would admit that progress is uneven, but how can a materialist *really* believe that morality is progressing, if it lacks an objective basis?

Lurking in the background is Dawkins' philosophical supposition that the universe is meaningless, which would make Dawkins' own rationality meaningless too, except as a base survival strategy (but then, if placebo or belief in rockness helps your selfish genes survive, why not embrace them instead?). And where does the feeling of meaning even come from, if the universe is meaningless? Dawkins often uses the ""poetry of reality"" as an argument against (!) religion and spirituality, claiming that the real world is more wondrous than the metaphors of witch-doctors, but how is this even relevant if meaning, awe and poetry are purely subjective? Then we might as well team up with Deepak Chopra and get our kicks from metaphors about quantum leaps! The moral revulsion of Dawkins against quacks is also obvious, but where does this morality come from? It seems to go beyond the (admittedly important) issue of which remedies might save our precious genes and memes from polio or small pox!

Of course, not everything is wrong with ""Enemies of Reason"". As Patrick Moore once quipped: ""It's impossible to always be wrong, unless you are a psychiatrist"". The anti-vaxxers really are a bizarre example of what can happen when people turn away from scientific reason (or even anecdotal common sense). And yes, many of the people Dawkins interviews are hilarious (as usual). Yet, I've come to the conclusion that it's immensely reasonable to believe in something above and beyond matter, some of which might affect us, and some of it which cannot be grasped with Skinner's ""robust"" terminology, but only with ""metaphors"" and ""poetry""...",1423353600,,4994,5.221945137157107
8273573,3,B0019D38UG,"This review is for Enemies of Reason, starring Richard Dawkins.

The video is somewhat entertaining and useful, but somewhat uneven and poorly produced. For example, Dawkins is interviewing someone in a park, and for some weird reason the camera switches to a squirrel dashing around. Another example: The camera repeatedly shows a verdant landscape with a lone sheep on a hilltop. What does the sheep signify? Apparently nothing. That kind of sums up this documentary, which kind of jumps around, somewhat at random.

The basic premise of this documentary is praiseworthy. A lot of people believe in silly, irrational beliefs. Dawkins states that 1 / 2 of people believe in ESP, and 1 / 4 of people believe in astrology. Moreover, he argues that science formerly was more respected, and that superstition is gaining ground. He does not cite statistics to support this trend claim. But obviously there is a lot of superstition in our society. But what else is new?

Dawkins bigger point is that irrational beliefs undermine civilization. This is reinforced by the scary title ""Enemies of Reason"" repeatedly shown, at more or less random times. He does not present much evidence in favor of this, but it makes sense. Still, plausibility is not proof. What is certain is that all the nonsense bothers Dawkins a lot. Dawkins says it is a contest between evidence-based reason and private / subjective feelings.

Dawkins is earnest, sincere, and skeptical-looking as he encounters apparent nutcase after nutcase. I especially like his conversation with the lady that explains to Dawkins that humans previously mostly had 12-stranded DNA, instead of double stranded DNA. Dawkins seems a bit at a loss for words at that point - it's difficult to have a conversation with someone so misinformed. To me, the encounters seem a bit scattershot, there is such a huge gulf between Dawkins' beliefs and those of most of the interviewees.

Dawkins manages to interview Deepak Chopra. It's incredible listening to the blather emanating from Chopra, a lot of words but hard to pin down any meaning. But it is again kind of hard for Dawkins to respond. Maybe he did not want to offend Chopra, or was overwhelmed by the smooth jargon stream. It's a well known phenomenon that in a debate between a ""believer"" and a scientist, for example a public evolution debate, the believer often or usually wins.

There is a great sequence of pigeons and people on a street. At least this one is related to a topic (BF Skinner and his study of superstition in pigeons) and I found the sequence spellbinding.

Dawkins does his own experiment on accuracy of astrology. He assigns the ""Capricorn"" reading to a random group of people and asks if they think it applies. Many more or less say ""yes"". The Capricorn in the group says ""no"".

Dawkins shows little sense of humor. The closest he comes is when speaking about astrology he says ""Am I taking this too seriously?"". The answer might be ""yes"". I think Dawkins maybe misses the point that a lot of people like to do silly things, like to believe nonsense. On the other hand, in Dawkins' defense, it was certainly troubling when Ronald Reagan made some decisions based on astrology.

Here are some other highlights.

- Scientific trial of dowsing, and the reactions of the dowsers when they fail.
- Dawkins grilling an astrology columnist.
- Satish Kumar and ""Resurgence""
- King Xerses sentenced the Hellespont to 38 lashes for storming up
- The ""spiritualist church"" and cold reading

Overall, this video is OK, but could have been a lot better in my opinion.",1391126400,4,3578,4.887788778877888
8273574,5,B0019D38UG,"This is a great show and somewhat amusing as you see all the people who believe in made up stuff fail, and make up all sorts of excuses. He treats this topic in a mature and deep way, and explains why some made up medical things seem to work ie the placebo effect ie for a short while you may have a pain reduction however this does not make you better, whatever is wrong with you is still there, it in no way helps to cure you to any extent. You may also have pain reduction by just visiting your doctor and having a  chat, especially if the Dr reassures you and you trust the doctor, and hold the Doctor in high esteem.",1289088000,5,621,4.048780487804878
