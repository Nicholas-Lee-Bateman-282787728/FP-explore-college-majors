Imax movies often depend on wide scenic shots to convey meaning.  Those shots are there in this movie, but not much else.  For a movie about humans diving into ""deep"" water, the scope of this movie is quite shallow. There is a mere gleaning of history given here, missing an opportunity to speak more on marine mammal / human underwater encounters, pearl divers, spearfishers, and fascinating divers like the ama and less on contest divers, where divers close their eyes during their dives and blind themselves to the whole reason anyone would watch a movie like this - to SEE the ocean.  In at least one way anyone who watches this movie experiences the ocean in a way that the no limit contest divers themselves do not.  Constant weight free diving is a more pure expression of the activity.  But doing it in a contest is still stilly.  Rather than surround himself with the magic of the ocean, its color, light, and animals, the director seemed to choose to surround himself with the atmosphere of freediving contests - sponsors, boats, training, computer read-outs of depth charts.  The voice overs from Pepin and Umberto seemed distant, impersonal, and perfect in that canned / rehearsed way - which of course they were, which is fine, but again misses an opportunity to connect with the heart of a subject. Why not let them actually speak on camera? Let us see the personality of their affect?  Let them speak in their native languages and give the American audience subtitles if necessary.

The tragedy of Audrey Mestre's death happens after this movie and its hard not to see its subjects and this movie's treatment through its lens.  But even for the casual viewer, looking for an interesting movie about the ocean and divers, I cannot recommend this movie that is so shallow in its exploration of the ocean.",1438732800,2,1830,4.777777777777778

A fascinating, totally unique documentary that looks at two extreme athletes who challenge each other not only in how long they can hold their breaths but in the authenticity of the chosen methods to do so, with the director's amazing underwater photography beautifully scored by composer Cliff Eidelman.

Gorgeous transfer on Blu-ray.",1401062400,,357,5.472727272727273
