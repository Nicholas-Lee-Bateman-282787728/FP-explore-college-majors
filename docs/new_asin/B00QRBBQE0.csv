Anyone who's looking to watch a fun, smart, heartwarming show full of talented bright actors has come to the right place. Enlisted will make you smile, laugh,cry and want to write a very long, angry letter to FOX for letting go of such a brilliant show so soon. Definitely worth getting on dvd.",1418169600,6,400,4.418918918918919

6877669,5,B00QRBBQE0,"This show is amazing. It's hilarious and heart-felt, and was an amazing support tool for me while my husband was away for work with the Army. All of the jokes are spot-on, and the acting is so good! The characters are so lovable, and the story-lines give you the feels. I am excited to finally find this on DVD to share with both of our families - we know they will love it!!

My only heart-breaking complaint is that there is only one season. Killed too soon, Enlisted. RIP, my friend.",1436918400,,486,4.34065934065934

6877671,5,B00QRBBQE0,"Every so often, I stumble across a little watched gem, and I just fall in love.  That was the case this last spring for me with Enlisted.  I started watching because of a couple of members in the cast, but I kept watching because I loved it.  Fox aired it on Friday nights, and the resulting ratings were poor, as expected.  But the laughs were rich.

The show focuses on the Rear D (thats Rear Detachment) at Fort McGee, Florida.  These are the army soldiers who might not make it in the field (at least thats the case in this show), but they are given jobs to help keep the base running smoothly.  Unfortunately, they are extremely undisciplined.

The show starts when Sergeant Pete Hill (Geoff Stults) is put in charge of one of these regiments.  Hes just returned from a stint in Afghanistan after almost being killed.  Honestly, he doesnt think he deserves this post.  Hes just too good.  Adding to his problems is that he is now over both of his brothers.  Middle brother Derrick (Chris Lowell) is just lazy and doesnt take anything seriously.  Meanwhile, youngest brother Randy (Parker Young) tries hard, but hes just not that good at stuff.  And these are the best people in Petes new regiment.  Even worse, their rival regiment, led by the beautiful Jill Perez (Angelique Cabral) always beats them at any competition.  Overseeing both groups is Donald Coby (Keith David), a family friend who has taken all of the Hill brothers under his wings.

So what happens over the course of these thirteen episodes?  Pete has to break up with the girlfriend he had before he left for Afghanistan.  A break war between Pete and Jills platoons gets out of hand.  Meanwhile, Pete tries to whip his soldiers into shape when an Inspection is coming.  Derrick finds himself falling for the bartender at the gangs favorite watering hole, which leads to several episode sub-plots.

I haven't gotten into the single comedy craze.  Most of the times, I feel the shows try too hard for laughs.  However, I found myself laughing at this one just after the pilot had started, and I kept right on laughing as the series unfolded.  Yes, one or two episodes weren't as good, but the writing and characters were so sharp you couldn't help but laugh.

But the show wasn't just laughs.  They still managed to provide tender moments along the way that added depth to the characters.  Honestly, that just made the jokes stronger.  At times, the comedy could be pretty broad and silly, but these tender moments kept the laughs grounded.  And no, the more serious moments were never forced.  The writers managed to balance those tones perfectly.

While this is a single camera comedy, this isn't one that has the characters talking to the camera.  The fourth wall is never once broken.  Frankly, Im glad because this is something else that bugs me in most shows that try it since it rarely works well.

The acting is uniformly great.  The plots call for some pretty crazy things at times, but everyone pulls it off and makes the absurd seem plausible and believable.  Even more importantly, the acting makes the tender moments work.  The best writing in the world can fall apart with bad acting, but thats not the case here at all.

One thing I heard leveled at the show from the pilot is how many mistakes they made with military life.  Personally, I don't know anything about military life, so I never found them.  Still, I know some people were turned off by this.

What did bug me is something I think has more to do with Fox than anything else.  In the multiple episode sub-plot I mentioned earlier with Derrick and his girlfriend, the story seemed to jump around in their relationship.  I have a feeling the episodes were aired out of order.  Its a shame because that is pretty much the only thing that required an order to the episodes at all.  If it weren't for that sub-plot, I never would have known.  Even so, it really did bug me.

Fox has released this as a MOD (Manufacture on Demand) set.  As a result, we get all 13 episodes of the comedy, but no extras at all.  Honestly, for a show that was canceled after so few episodes, Ill take anything they want to give us.

Enlisted was wacky and fun.  It never took itself too seriously, which allowed us to sit back and laugh along with it.  Yet when it wanted to slow down and be tender, it worked just as well.  If you missed this gem of a comedy, watch it today.",1434844800,2,4400,4.543367346938775

6877673,5,B00QRBBQE0,Great show!! Wish the network would have given it more time and actually aired all episodes in order instead of just at random,1430092800,,126,4.521739130434782
6877674,1,B00QRBBQE0,"Geez, I read the reviews and had some expectations of this show being watchable. Actually its nothing short of retarded. Not a show for grown ups and not a show for someone with more than one active neuron. I cant say enough about how childish this show is. There were 4 adults in the room and we only just made it through the first episode then we took it outside and shot it. That was only mildly funnier.",1429401600,,407,4.230769230769231

6877678,5,B00QRBBQE0,Was very happy this came out on DVD. Was very sad the series was cancelled. Much funnier than most comedies!,1427932800,2,108,4.45
6877679,5,B00QRBBQE0,Hats off to the creators of this show. They hit the nail on the head when it comes to much of Army culture. This show is everything everyone in the Army has ever thought about Rear-D. I've yet to meet a solider that doesn't love this show once they see it.,1426896000,4,256,4.03921568627451
6877680,5,B00QRBBQE0,"This is an engaging, often very sweet, story about three brothers told against the humorous background of a barely functional military base.  I have no idea why FOXTV would not renew it because it couldn't've been expensive to produce (unlike the excellent Almost Human which FOXTV canceled the same year), was original and entertaining, and would have had many more stories to tell.  Alas, there will be no future seasons but this one wraps up in a satisfactory way.",1426723200,3,467,4.89873417721519

6877682,5,B00QRBBQE0,"I freakin' love this show. I saw it in December 2013 at a sneak preview in Austin, Texas and instantly fell in love. It's smart, funny, and has TONS of heart. Had Fox actually invested some time and money into marketing the show, it could have been a huge hit.  My other beef with Fox is that they insisted on airing the episodes out of order. From what I gather, the DVD is in broadcast order, which is unfortunate. If you'd like to watch them in narrative order:

Pilot
Parade Duty
Pete's Airstream
Randy Get Your Gun
Rear D Day
Brothers and Sisters
Prank War
Vets
The General Inspection
Homecoming
Paint Kart 5000 vs. the Mondo Spider
Army Men
Alive Day

Thanks to the folks behind the Enlisted Writers twitter account for providing that list to me.

Invest in this show - it's a great way to spend a day!",1422576000,15,808,4.366666666666666
6877683,5,B00QRBBQE0,This was a brilliant show and it is too bad that Fox treated it like garbage. They have no idea what a gem they had. I hope it continues to grow an audience on DVD because the online community is strong!,1421884800,2,203,3.975609756097561
6877684,4,B00QRBBQE0,"The episodes seem to be out of order? Early on Derrick is dating the barmaid (and helps reunite her son with his father) but then in the episodes that follow, he is trying to talk the barmaid into dating him...? Still a great show though.",1421539200,4,238,4.311111111111111

He is put in charge of his brothers' squad - a group of very ""unique"" soldiers. They all find them selves in riotous situations. It also has it's touching parts, dealing with the issues of coming home from and surviving war. An all around excellent series that was canceled before it could really reach greatness.",1420416000,4,474,4.710843373493976
6877688,5,B00QRBBQE0,"The cancellation of this show, for me, ranks right up there with the cancellation of Firefly - a very poor and short-sighted move.  Particularly considering that, despite pretty shoddy handling by the network, Enlisted got nearly universally positive reviews.

Honestly, I didn't plan to watch Enlisted.  As someone who grew up bouncing around military bases in Europe and the Middle East, I was not thrilled about the prospect of the sit-com set in the Army.  The whole thing seemed fraught with the potential to trivialize and marginalize the experiences of the men and women who defend our country (and the men, women, and children who love them).  But Enlisted does the exact opposite of that.  It was clearly created, written, and acted with a great deal of respect for the subject matter.  The writing is sharp and the acting is excellent.  On top of being exceptionally funny, this show is thoughful and touching (even for someone with a cold, dead heart - like me).

Buy the DVDs, watch Enlisted.  I have excellent taste - you'll love it.",1420156800,26,1046,4.858757062146893

6877690,5,B00QRBBQE0,"Let me preface this by saying that I rarely find comedy shows funny. They always try too hard to be funny and end up missing it or the characters are stupid and one dimensional. Or even worse they use a clichd ending and I'm groaning at the irritation. I never felt that way with this show. Kieth David has made me grin at his delivery since They Live and The Thing. As the Major he was a riot. The Hills are all well developed throughout the series. Randy's sweetness is thankfully never lost. Derrick the smart ass, is frequently the voice of reason. Pete's the quintessential GI Joe on the surface but isn't dealing well with his new posting or the PSTD. The heavier things in this are all handled deftly. I never watched this show that I wasn't LMAO. It is truly a perfect antidote for a bad day and bad TV. It makes me want to set parades on fire that they didn't renew the show.",1418515200,4,884,4.267857142857143
6877691,5,B00QRBBQE0,"I am in all ways biased when I say this was one of those gems of a show who never got a great shot.  I have never seen a more dedicated cast and crew engage their fans on social media.  Every episode had me laughing and crying.  It was a show you could watch with your whole family.  It was smart and witty comedy.  If you didn't get to see it on TV, order it because it is 100% worth it.",1418342400,7,388,3.740740740740741

8692495,1,B00QRBBQE0,"I give it minus ten stars.  This has to be the worst ""comedy"" I have ever seen.  I can't believe other reviewers gave it such high ratings which was the reason why I purchased this.  I had never seen this before so I was taking a chance.  It's very juvenile and not for mature audiences.  The cover art should have given me a clue.

This program gives a false and disrespectful image of the military and those who serve or have served.  It's disgraceful.  There have been other military TV series and movies of a comic nature that aren't like this.  I like military films and TV shows that are dramatic and comedic, but this one is just too stupid.  It gives a very poor example of military life and maybe what the writer perceived to be realistic.  The acting is just as bad as the writing.

Now I see why it was cancelled.  The pilot was terrible and not at all funny which clued me in that the rest of the season was just as bad.  Pass on this one unless you like juvenile comedy and high schoolish pranks.",1513641600,,1009,4.242105263157895

8692498,4,B00QRBBQE0,"Funny, warm, thoughtful series that starts great, gets a over the top and ends with a good episode (no cliffhangers).  Likable actors, story lines and doesn't completely shy away from the aftermath of coming home from battle as one would expect from a sitcom.
