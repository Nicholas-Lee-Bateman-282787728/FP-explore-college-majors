8356221,2,B0028G1JG8,"Not really very usable as a cycling video for use with a trainer.  Views are good but sections are not long enough and the pace is that of a car not a cyclist. Also each session ends before any climbs, only descents!",1427500800,,216,4.142857142857143
8356222,5,B0028G1JG8,"I don't know how these videographers got such beautiful results but this dvd sure makes me want to travel to New Mexico and see for myself.  The blue skies, like the cover description says are really pretty and the colorful landscapes were surprisingly varied.  There are forests, high deserts, hills, valleys, rivers and even a quick ride through Santa Fe, which was very picturesque in its classic southwestern way.  Also, I really liked the music which was a mix of instrumental classic-rock and blues and even some native American-inspired pieces for local color.  Stopping for the panoramas of Bandalero National Monument also added a level of detail that I thought really enhances the cycling video.  You won't be disappointed and I highly recommend it.",1347148800,,759,5.088709677419355
