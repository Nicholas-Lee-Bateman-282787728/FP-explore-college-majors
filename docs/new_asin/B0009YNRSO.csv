2342193,5,B0009YNRSO,"Excellent, Allen Funt is the master catching the people in the act to be them self, a genious.... If your doctor prescribe you a medicine to make you laugh, buy the Candid Camera collection, you will not regret.",1126742400,4,211,4.578947368421052
2342194,4,B0009YNRSO,"Unlike alot of TV DVDs , this show has material that hasn't been seen in eons and boy was it nice to see it again. Ashton Kutcher and Jamie Kennedy aren't fit to take Allen Funt's drive-thru order! Talking Mailbox, Woody Allen dictating a love letter, The Car That Splits in Half, The Guy Sneezing Through the phone. It just doesn't get any funnier. Allen Funt knew that you didn't have to be out and out mean to people to get funny reactions from them, just a little mischievious. The two best examples of this are the guy who steals tips off of a diner counter and the guy who ""hitches a ride"" under people's umbrellas. The people in these films are just subtly messed with and the results are hysterical.

Of course the classic black and white shows are still the best but the later periods are good too and it's interesting to see how the show lasted through all the ups and downs of life (and TV).

And hey, you do a show that lasts fifty years and tell me how many discs you think you deserve!",1123977600,28,999,4.28042328042328
2342195,4,B0009YNRSO,"Some reviewers are complaining about getting complete episodes instead of just the good bits, but I'm glad they released them this way. Releasing just the best parts certainly wouldn't fit 10 discs.

The anniversary specials do duplicate parts of other episodes, but they are an extra feature, not the main selling point.

A better ballance between classic episodes and modern ones (i.e., more classics) would have been appreciated though. But overall it's a good set and worth the buy.",1123632000,30,486,5.139240506329114
2342196,5,B0009YNRSO,Something for everyone.  Lots of laughs and a remarkable look at human nature over nearly 60 years.  Buy it.,1123027200,4,108,4.631578947368421
2342197,5,B0009YNRSO,"This is the first DVD collection of this classic show. It contains clips from the 60's, 70's, 80's, 90's, and today. I've been waiting a long time for this to be available. I know that I'll definetly get it as soon as it comes out.",1120003200,4,231,4.155555555555556
2342218,5,B0009YNRSO,Bought this as a gift and she has really enjoyed it.  Got it because I knew it was one of her favorite shows.,1294099200,,109,3.739130434782609
2342219,2,B0009YNRSO,"I remember watching several funny clips while the show was a regular broadcast in TV.

Hoping to see them again, I spent around $ 100 to buy this DVD set. Unfortunately most of the shows I enjoyed were missing in this package.

I was very disappointed.  Sold the DVD set back to someone else through Amazon.com's used DVD sale.",1277424000,8,327,4.508474576271187
2342220,1,B0009YNRSO,"It's no secret Allen Funt liked the sound of his own voice and loved seeing himself on TV -- and that's mostly what you get with this stingy Candid Camera box set:  Funt's endless explanations of what you are about to see and why it's funny.  His son Peter is easier to take but if you've got good footage, why do you need a host at all?  You'll find yourself fast-forwarding past all the tiresome chatter (Pam Dawber expounding on why she likes Candid Camera, for instance) for only a handful of clips. This box set is a waste of time and money.  I recommend the newer generation Candid Camera called Just Kidding (no hosts, no long set-ups, more gags per minute).",1267574400,3,665,4.426229508196721
2342221,1,B0009YNRSO,"Don't be fooled by the number of discs provided in this collection.  It seems on the surface you are in for hours and hours of entertainment.  However, once you discover the ""dirty little secret"" you realize you've been had.  That ""secret"" is that throughout the DVDs in this set you will view the exact same footage of the same stunts/gags over and over again.  Some stunts are repeated four, even five times over the course of viewing.  Many of your favorite segments from the best era of Candid Camera, the 1960's, are included however there are many more that are not in this set.  Trust me; you will be very disappointed with the overall content in this collection.  It is not worth the cost.",1216684800,48,697,4.57258064516129
2342222,3,B0009YNRSO,this is not worth the price half of it is a repeat of the other half so if you buy it you're not off rocker you did just it on another disc.,1183766400,,140,3.40625
2342223,3,B0009YNRSO,"If you're a social science instructor of a certain age, you might remember that Phil Zimbardo of the important Stanford Prison experiments and other significant social psychology research was an early consultant to this show.  Since VHS gave way to DVD I've been hoping to replace my long-since worn out tape of the early shows, I used to use in classes to demonstrate the power of consensus.  I would present Asch's research, that demonstrated how most people would agree with others (on the length of a line) even if they majority was obviously wrong, just to be like everyone else.  In the early seasons of Candid Camera, they took advantage of this and related social patterns quite a bit.  They would have a bunch of actors in an office elevator all turn sideways at the same time, and the unsuspecting average person would do the same thing.  They would have a sign in a busy downtown area saying ""begin walking backwards now"" and have a bunch of variously dressed actors begin walking backwards, and many average people would do the same ridiculous thing to be like everyone else.  Perfect footage to humorously illustrate some fundamental observations of socialization, social interaction, and so forth.  Well, pretty much none of those episodes are in this collection. I don't get what the criteria were for selecting these ""best of"" episodes, but what's left are for the most part not useful for a social science classroom, with the possible exception of the interesting censored visit to the USSR.  The original episode didn't air because it was a threat to national security since it showed that the people of Communist Moscow were, well, people like us in many ways.  If you're teaching a history or poli-sci class on the Cold War era this one episode might be of use.  For the most part, this best of collection is a disappointment in terms of academic use.",1169856000,5,1871,4.81875

2342225,5,B0009YNRSO,"This collection is outstanding!  Definately a must have for true Candid Camera fans.

For years I have been searching video stores and online for any Candid Camera videos and have found very few releases.  Finally the VERY complete collection is available.

I love the way they have full episodes broken down in decades 60's 70's etc. Also they take the very best of all the decades and put into a Best of DVD.  I use the best of DVD when I want to share my favorites with company for a quick laugh.  I love watching the full episodes so I see the skits not included on the best of DVD.

Again a must have for true Candid Camera fans worth every penney!  Enjoy!",1165708800,6,661,4.317073170731708

The Candid camera gurus are the sneaky camera geniuses!!  Watch your back...ohhhhhh boyyyyyy.  I remember my younger brother poked a peekhole in the wall from his room into to my closet.  To his dismay I had full control to spy on his room by opening the closet door while he learned my closet door was closed all the time..tee heee heee.  Anyhoo, I became a Junior Candid Camera soldier!!!  I was able to see the GI Joe mini wars and the fake Matchbox car cruises daily.  Thank you Candid Camera!!!!

total came to $71.40, as shown below).  So why not be gouged directly
by the producers (and support them by patronizing the PRODUCERS),
rather than submit to being gouged by hinky eBay/Amazon resellers?

You can still buy ALL the Social Psychology materials separately at the URLs below,
including the original Instructor Guide, written by Dr. Philip Zimbardo of Stanford University
(along with Allen Funt).  These DVDs are for University Professors and DVD completists
(or The Wealthy :-).

I especially like the sound of the ""Green Kid"" DVD gimmick:
""Peter Funt questioned youngsters - using hidden camera and microphone -
about a new student who was to join their class: a boy with green skin.""
Cool idea.

8070544,2,B0009YNRSO,"There are some great shows in this set - but for the money I was very disappointed.  First of all, there wasn't really good organization to it, and there was way too much ""Talk"", several shows appeared several times, and some of the shows that I was really hoping to see which I bought the set for weren't even on the DVD - so I felt that I wasted my money.  There were, however several really good episodes on here.  I think for the money they could have done a much better job and given people a lot more material.  To be honest, there are only a few shows which are really good on here, and the rest aren't really that good.  The ones that are good are very good - and I'm glad that I got to see them, but overall, I felt disappointed, because I spent a lot of money for this and I didn't feel that I got what I paid for.  Several of these had the same gags repeated in different situations several times, so there is a lot of repetition.  Some of the same shows appear 2-3-4 times.  The thing is, that they could have put a lot more shows on the same number of cds - rather than repeating themselves several times.  They could have done a much better job of presenting and organizing this material.",1380153600,5,1202,4.146551724137931
8070545,5,B0009YNRSO,"I recall watching these on TV Sunday nights while growing up.  Laughing until tears came, and was curious if they would have the same effect now....almost 40 years later.  I am glad to say that even though I recalled some of the most memorable, there were many I had forgotten and found myself laughing with tears again.  They are worth purchasing...and so good for good clean fun and laughter for the soul.",1360800000,,407,4.625
8070546,1,B0009YNRSO,There are a lot of repeating segments in this set. Don't be fooled by the good reviews. This series is put together in a poor manner. I never bought something where the same material is shown several times.,1294444800,3,206,4.447368421052632
