8069884,4,B0009XT8U6,"Whistlin Dan, 1932 film

A telegraph sends a message: $5,000 for the capture of Serge Karloff dead or alive. Three men ride into town to collect their pay, then repay a loan at the bank. A man overhears a conversation, misinterprets it, and plans a crime. The bandit gang kidnaps Bob, they want $5,000 or his life. Bob writes a letter to Dan asking for the money. Dan asks the banker for a loan but is turned down. Get a posse is the advice. Will Dan do something foolish? He rides hard to rescue Bob. Captain Karloff also loves a young woman. Dan arrives too late! Dan returns the money to the banker, who insists on their arrest. They go peacefully.

Will a jury convict them? Another prisoner tells about his escape plan; he is a member of the Karloff gang. There is shooting in town, a gang is chased out of town. Karloffs men free the prisoners, who will ride with them now. They arrive at a tavern where a young woman dances to entertain the men. Shes nobodys girl. Karloff puts his brand on Dan, then his pal. Dan talks to the Seorita about Bob. Then he visits the Sheriff in secret at night. Karloff sends Dan to rob a stagecoach. But Dan captures the three members of the gang, Ely ties them up. Dan reports those three were killed by a posse.

There is a dance by that young woman. Dan rides with Carmelita. Karloff lost more men since Dan arrived. Dan and Ely ride away; they are warned against a watcher. Dan has a plan to catch the Karloff gang. A prisoner is released, he tells Karloff what happened, and Karloff draws on Dan! Carmelita calls Karloff to her room, then Karloff orders Dans release! Then they are ordered to chase Dan, who heads for the border. The Sheriffs men capture the gang, except for one who gets away. Dan pursues him to that tavern. There is a fight. Ely arrives in time. My hero!

This has a pretty good story about revenge for killing a friend. Dan should get the reward, a small fortune in those days. Later there would be other movies that featured a trio that acted for justice in the Southwest. The lesson here is to not talk about sensitive subjects in public as you never know who is listening.",1509408000,,2140,4.369346733668341
8069885,2,B0009XT8U6,"This is an early B-western starring Ken Maynard and does not have a music soundtrack so the action stumbles in some segments. Moreover, the acting ranges from mediocre to good with the real star ironically being bad guy Captain Serge Karlov, an outlaw gang leader based in Mexico across the border from the Arizona territory.

Karlov and company earn a living by robbing in the Arizona territory and in this film also murder Dan Savage's (Ken Maynard) best friend.

The script is decent and there are a few twists, so the suspense holds until the end.

This DVD release from Alpha is from a fair 16mm print which has approximately twelve missing frames, some dark scenes, surface noise and in some places loud audio hiss. But, all things considered it is better than many other Alpha releases and worth a dollar plus shipping. It is not worth $7.95 or even $5.00.

I doubt you will want to watch this more than once and it certainly is not worth watching on a high-def screen.",1188172800,,976,4.624277456647399
