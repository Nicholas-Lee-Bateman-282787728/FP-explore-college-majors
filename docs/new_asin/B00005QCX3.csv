1648045,5,B00005QCX3,"One word: WOW!  After I got my ""Ultimate 3D Collection"" assortment (which also included ""Alien Adventure"" and ""Encounter in the Third Dimension"" IMAX DVDs), the first movie I had to see was ""Haunted Castle"", since I love to go ghost investigating when I can get the free time and people to join me.  Sure, the movie doesn't even comes close to anything realistic in the field of paranormal investigation, but as a 3D CGI fun ride, it's awesome.  I can see that it would be quite boring in 2D, but I watched it with the accompanying Razor 3D shutter glasses (put out by edimensional) and was totally blown away.  Got my mother to sit in and enjoy the film as well.  We were both loving the dimensional effects, and more importantly, the fantastic music.  If it wasn't for ""Haunted Castle,"" I would never have known about ""Lunascape"".  Can't wait to get their ""Reminiscence"" album, which has the ""Lane Navachi"" song from this movie on it.  ""Arid"" is also excellent in the movie, though ""Little Things of Venom"" is really the only good song from their album ""At The Close Of Every Day"".  As for the CGI in the movie, it kind of reminds me of the first two ""Myst"" games for computers.  Really, the only thing that dates it is the globular effect used for when the three knights melt at the beginning of the film.  Everything else is still excellent.  My only complaint would be that the roller coaster segment doesn't go fast enough and wasn't more like the CGI ""Devil's Mine Ride"" short film (which can be found on the ""Computer Animation Festival 2.0"" video, if you can find a copy).  If you love IMAX and 3D movies, get ""Haunted Castle"".  You won't be disappointed, unless you don't have a pair of shutter glasses.",1133827200,27,1713,4.555555555555555

I own several 3d movies and this is my favorite. For the best experiance in projecting shutter Glasses movies use a epson projector because they use 3 lcd technology a good one is the Epson PowerLite Home 20 or in focus depth q projector.",1125705600,6,406,4.355263157894737
1648047,4,B00005QCX3,"Indeed the 3D effects in this film make you feel as if you are in a motion simulator at times and it's a very cool experience for the 3d fanatic like myself. I wasn't as enamored of the music as some of the other reviewers here but it wasn't bad. It did need a bit more humor for Harry Shearer ( The Simpsons,Spinal Tap) to work with but it is cool and goth looking and fun for kids except for maybe very young ones. You do need a standard tube set to make it work with the included system but rumor has it that version for LCD and projectors systems are not far off. Untill then this is the best we got.

1648048,5,B00005QCX3,"The only caveat: you need a raster to display the 3D properly as the 3D glasses toggle based on the raster timing (won't work on front or rear-screen projection systems).

HOWEVER, if you are on a tube set and are hooked up to a decent sound system, this is an AWESOME DVD.  Kids will love it (though some scenes of torture could be too much for some - use discretion).  5.1 surround implemented brilliantly.

But the sparkling gem in this movie is the music, most of which is provided by Arid. Their music can only be described as beautifully melodic and enchanting - pure magic!
I guarantee you'll want to check out their album once you've heard their music in Haunted Castle.

1648056,5,B00005QCX3,"For those of you saying this movie won't play in 3d, I'm here to tell you that you are wrong.  You have to have the right setup.

My setup is this:  I have a BenQ HT1075 Projector, a 100 inch screen, a Yahama 3d HD receiver, and I use my dell E6510 I7 laptop with a NVIDIA video card in it and I use Stereoscopic Player (not the free version, but the $50 version).  I connect an HDMI adapter to the display port on my laptop, play the DVD in my laptop, which sends the images through the HDMI cable to my Yamaha, which continues it on to my BenQ.  I configure it all as instructed on the 3dtv.av site and the Stereoscopic site, and it works like magic.

By the way, I am just a regular guy with no excess experience in configuring this sort of stuff.  I just read the instructions on the sites.  I get full and vivid 3d images watching this movie!  I love watching it close to the screen with my Yamaha blasting the sound effects, or my Sennheiser RS 170 headsets on, and my room totally dark.  It's like you're right there in the movie.

1648069,5,B00005QCX3,"These 3-D videos are based on an older technology and are not compatible with modern 3D televisions/players (they will still play, just not in 3D). Keep in mind these were made back in 2001, back when TVs were still square shaped tubes. The video consists of an animated 3D CGI movie connected together with thin story of a son that returns home and is tempted by what appears to be the devil. Most of the movie consist virtual rides through several surreal landscapes as Johnny searches for his mother and decides if he is going to take the devil's deal.

These virtual rides movies are all a product of a film company that makes (or did, not sure they are still around these days) these sort of rides for parks. Given that these videos were all made sometime before 2000, the animations lack a bit of the detail and sophistication that is possible with today's computers and software. Still, I think they are fun to watch in a historic way (the early days of CGI animation).",1394582400,3,976,4.545454545454546

I've had this DVD for about 6 years now and inside it, still, is the insert advertising where you buy the equipment.
I looked it up just then, before I typed this, that company no longer exists.
I'm sure they were very cutting edge back in 2001.

So I laughed loudly reading everyones shocked complaints, if you read the product description noting it was released 10 years ago then you wouldn't have anything to whinge about.

The film itself looks great at an Imax Theatre. At home, its just fun to watch in 2D and enjoy the music.

I agree w/ one reviewer about the title being a bit misleading as there were minimal ghosts (his mother), several demons and tortured souls (graphic violence not suitable for young children IMHO).

I just took a chance on it yesterday at the IMAX theater in San Antonio hoping it would be a nice ghostly treat that would help to get me into the spirit of Halloween.  Wrong!  It was horrible beyond mention, most especially the bad script. As the viewer is 'driving' along in the same car as the narrator, he sees through the narrator's eyes. The narrator being a boy-band-looking rock star who states how, after his band has gotten rave album reviews, he's called to his late mother's estate, a creepy-looking castle on the wind-swept coast of England.  He's bitter with his Mom, as she abandoned him when he was only 3 to pursue her own career as a rock star.  Entering the castle, he calls out, ""Hello! Is anyone home?"" He asks this, even though he clearly sees candles lit throughout the place. Duh!  All of a sudden, about 6 suits of armour begin to threaten him menacingly with their spears. ""What's going on here?"" the boy asks. (Powerful line, that.)  Suddenly, out of nowhere, an un-scary-looking  mechanical looking demon appears  and addresses the budding rock star, Johnny.  But before he does, he turns the suits of armor into tapioca, or something. Then he tells 'Johnny' that ""Mr. D."" wants to see him. They get into a mine car and go down, down, down into a tunnel, looking at other musicians in cages along the way who, over the years  have sold their soul to the Devil as their price of fame.  He arrives at the bottom, a watery-looking tomb where Mr. D. addresses him and offers him fame for a price. Satan reminds the boy that his rock-star mom had made a pact that included her not seeing her own son as the price of her fame. Suddenly, a hologram of a woman appears and begins to sing. I mean the hologram image is poised over a hologram projector, for gosh sakes. (Remember, this is a CGI-Animated film.) ""Mom, is that you,"" the boy asks. The Mom never answers, but instead breaks into a lame  and unscary pop song.  Satan then offers Johnny his shot at fame again, but Johnny declines. The demon then says, ""They all do that at first, but we get them all in the end. Would you like to see where we store them? Mr. D. has it all worked out cleverly.""  They then go into yet another tunnel, emerging  at last in a Las Vegas-looking Hell, where all the rock stars have rooms.

I walked out at that point. I couldn't take it any more. Who the hell wrote this and for what age group?! Certainly not for adults, or children. But for teens who love their CGI-laced computer games, it must really be the ticket.

The straw that really broke the camel's back for me, in fact,  is that this very expensively made IMAX 3D movie looked to be nothing more than an advertisement for a new video game, or amusement park ride. And the beauty of it all is they actually have people paying to see it!

I was so disappointed. I 'd gone in expecting ghosts, goblins, witches and skeltons and ended up with Rock and Rollers in Hell. What a misleading title that was, HAUNTED CASTLE. It would've been more on the mark to have called it SATANIC CASTLE, or CASTLE OF THE DAMNED.

In all fairness, the IMAX supervisor apologized and offered me another movie in its place, but I didn't have the time, so had to decline. My advice? Stay far, far, away from this bomb if you value your common sense.",1287964800,3,3470,4.417582417582418

1648109,4,B00005QCX3,"I had purchased Haunted Castle in field sequential 3-D a while ago for use with the old wired ""shutter"" glasses which worked only on my old 32"" CRT tv ( & although clear, it ""flickered"" due to the slow refresh rate). When I switched  to LCD flatscreen tvs I thought these F.S. dvds were history( LCD tv's won't work with F.S. video ). That was until I purchased a Viewsonic 3D ready DLP projector here at Amazon.
If you have purchased a 3D ready dlp projector as I have, you are probably looking for 3D content to watch, & I was pleasently suprised to find that the old F.S. ""shutter dvds work great on these new projectors! Crystal clear with no flicker, thses dvds look amazing! The 3D experience is every bit as good as the Real-D 3d films at the theater! Amazon also carries the Viewsonic wireless active 3D glasses (required for 3D viewing) for about $89.00 each, which is far less expensive than most. This dvd is like a 3D theme park ride, fun for the entire family. I don't know if this would be as exciting on a smaller 3d tv, but when viewed on a 9ft wide projection screen in your living room, it really equals the Imax 3D viewing experience!",1284336000,3,1153,4.362790697674418

Although not as good with the Imax imagery, I still enjoy the movie.  The music is great, and most enjoyed with a quality surround sound system.  I have seen some advertisements that suggest that this is a 2 plus hour movie.  It is not.  It is 37 minutes.  I paid about 10 bucks for the movie, delivered.  It is worth it.",1275782400,,476,3.978723404255319
1648111,5,B00005QCX3,"This movie is awesome in 3D but I am not sure why the negative reviews for the 3D- this has some of the best 3D you will ever see.  If you are not using the shutter glasses and system- then you will not see 3D- the cardboard glasses do not work with this movie. You need the Shutter glasses.  I have the razor 3D system and it works excellent! Just a word of advice on other 3D movies that use the cardboard glasses- invest in a plastic pair- they are MUCH better.

There are lots of images that come off the television in this movie- and the color images are fantastic and crisp clear.  I love the Haunted Castle- one of my favorite 3D movies!",1259539200,2,644,4.128

1648117,3,B00005QCX3,"Lugosi, Price and Chaney are all part of the CLASSIC HORROR COLLECTION 8 MOVIE PACK. (This set is somewhat pricey because each title is on its own disc-- totally unnecessary for the ones that run barely over an hour.)

Bela Lugosi's 1939 serial, ""The Phantom Creeps"" was re-edited a decade later into a feature film. Lugosi is a scientist who invents all sorts of unusual weapons-- he even discovers a way to render whole armies helpless. ""Human Monster,"" also with Bela, is a story of a doctor committing insurance fraud and the serial killer that he controls. Lugosi himself plays the murderer in ""Invisible Ghost,"" when a town's leading citizen is hypnotized by his wife's ghost into committing homicides.

In ""Last Man..."" Vincent Price is the only survivor of a nuclear holocaust, unluckily pursued by zombies out for human blood. In Price's other film here, he hosts a dinner party and offers five guests the opportunity to win $10,000 each if they can spend the night in a haunted house.

""Unnatural"" is about artificial insemination and selective human breeding, a topic decades ahead of its time.

Lon Chaney plays a modern-day Frankenstein's monster in ""Indestructible Man."" He's an executed criminal brought back to life as a violent and seemingly unstoppable mute.

""Nightmare Castle"" has a pair of murdered lovers returning to life. They seek revenge on their killer, the woman's husband.

1648118,1,B00005QCX3,"I took the kids -- 8 and 10 -- to see this a couple of Halloweens ago. It may be the worst movie I've seen. The kids hated it. It appears to be an excuse to make a 3-D film, so there are lots of irrelevant roller-coaster effects, etc. The plot is inane, bordering on offensive (frequent torture scenes). A complete waste of your time and money.",1168128000,2,344,4.149253731343284
1648119,1,B00005QCX3,"Went to see this movie at the IMAX in San Antonio this weekend.  I have to say I actually laughed most of the way through.  The effects were decent, but most of the time I had trouble making anything out due to the fuzzy 3D effects.  That was when I wasn't having to ""look around"" the bird statues and gargoyles that popped up in the foreground of the shot in blazing white about six inches from my face making it completely impossible to focus on the actual movie.

Some of the torture scenes and the Faustian plotline, along with the hideous firey face that is Mr. D make this movie too dark and scary for anyone under the age of 10, but the terrible plot along with the worst voice-acting I have had the displeasure to hear in my life make the film unbearable for anyone over the age of 10.

Basically, I guess you could say I was slightly displeased with the movie.  I do have to admit that I got a hearty laugh when the main character, Johnny (played by Jasper Steverlinck, an up-and-coming rocker and lead singer of the band Arid, a decent rock group that was featured at the end of the movie in the only bright spot I could find in the movie) throws his guitar into the fire and begins singing opera to defeat the evil Mr. D and destroy the haunted castle.  Unfortunately, the scene was designed to be serious.",1157414400,4,1317,4.3076923076923075
