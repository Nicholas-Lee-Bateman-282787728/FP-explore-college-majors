7966318,5,B00006ADET,"I originally saw this film at the Nantucket Film Festival. Now, for me, Nantucket isn't exactly a drive around the corner, but I can tell you seeing this film was worth the trip! I'm a Joaquim de Almeida fan, whifh is why I went to see the film.  His perfomance is brief, but oh-so wonderfully done. His fans all know that he can do the ""evil, bad guy"" parts quite well, but there is an underlying comedic tone to Ignacio. As a viewer, I couldn't quite decide if he was playing the part straight (evil) or as a characture of a gangster/pimp. I think that was the point... Good acting!
Considering it was such a long trip to get to Nantucket, I am glad I liked the film besides the fact that Joaquim was in it. In fact, I liked it a lot! The film centers around two characters, Albert and Louie. Albert is a shy, retiring sort, and Louie... well Louie is not. The story revolves around Louie's request to Albert to let him come over to Albert's place for just a little while. Louie has just gotten out of prison (we later find out that he's actually escaped).
Albert and Louie have known each other since childhood, and of course whenver they do something together there is trouble and it's Albert who always takes the fall.
The action of the film is based on the adventures that ensue from Louie's visit. On The Run is a chronicle of mad-cap, zany, situations. However, Bruno de Almeida and scriptwriter, Joseph Minion (After Hours), don't always take you where you expect to go. There are twists and turns that add depth to this film. Of course there is plenty of outright comedy, but there is much subtle humor here as well.
There are some downright good performances here as well. Albert is played delightfully by Michael Imperioli. He has been in such films as Goodfellas, Clockers, Malcom X, and the HBO series, the Sopranos. Louie is played by John Ventimiglia, who imbues his character with a lovable, child-like quality. (no matter what he does, you just gotta love Louie!).
Both these actors are excellent in their individual characters. With Imperioli, you'll want to hug him and bring him home to Mom. Ventimiglia, well, you won't know whether you should slap him or bring him home (and NOT to Mom!).
There are other stand-out performances as well. The character of Rita is played by Drena DeNiro (yes, Robert's daughter). The audience adored her. Talking with the others who saw the film it was fun to discuss whether it was Albert or Louie who was their favorite of those two. But, everyone loved Rita!
Is this film perfect? No, I can't say that it is. There were many times I wished the director had had a bigger budget to work with. There were some scenes that cried out for more budgetary freedom. (Give this guy a decent budget to work with and I believe you are going to see a film that will make you stand up and notice.)
The ending sequence was a bit of a victim of budget. Yet, budget or no budget, the ending screen shot, in my opinion, brought together the talent of actor and director into a memorable, emotionally effective scene.",1054166400,,3055,4.524412296564195
