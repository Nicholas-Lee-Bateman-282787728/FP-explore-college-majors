1383421,5,B00004Z4V5,"I have to begin with a warning... this is a series you really have to watch from start to finish.  Not only because its addictive but because like ""The  Prisoner"" everything all falls into place by the  finale.  With each episode, things get more gross and the relationships between the characters  get more twisted, especially once you're into the  final  season (not out on video.)  All in all,  you'll meet about 60 of the residents of Royston  Vassey mostly played by only three actors.  (The show itself began on BBC radio... a lot of the  characters carried over, though you won't find  the Local Shop, and Royston is known as Spent, and there's a hillarious scene in which Mickey wets the carpet during a visualization exersize with  Pauline... get the tapes over at Amazon.com's UK site.)
Overall, this show is unique.  It has been described  as Monty Python meets Twin Peaks... I would also have  to throw in a bit of the Young Ones, Pedro Almodovar and John Waters.  If you can dig that stuff, then  you'll definitely enjoy this DVD along with a nice warm glass of aqua vita.  You'll have the time of your life...just be sure not to touch the prescious things and  refrain from passing solids into the WC ! ! !",972950400,9,1220,4.555555555555555
1383422,5,B00004Z4V5,"If you're wondering if you should buy this, the answer is YES. If you are a TLoG fans, this DVD is a must have!  A cross between sketch comedy & soap opera sitcom, the entire series 1 is presented here unedited, giving us an even closer look at the fictional northern english town of Royston Vasey. This community is inhabited by over 60 characters, portrayed by only 3, extremely talented, actors.
But wait! That's not all! In addition, the DVD includes a separate soundtrack of the Gents discussing each scene & character as they watch along, continually commenting on their creative process, character development, & early stage performances. Finally, we are treated to a healthy handful of outtake scenes that were never included in series 1 (although some jokes were reworked in series 2).
Thank the powers that be (including BBC, Time Warner, etc) for releasing such entertainment & please start the process of making available to us series 2 on DVD.",972604800,9,956,4.901234567901234

I was disappointed see that I wasn't getting clean, pure and local episodes!!!  After praying, along with other fans, on the BBC chat board about rumors of a video release...I was pleased to find it on Amazon!

1383426,5,B00004Z4V5,"As an expat Englishman living in the US (Washington DC) I was overjoyed to find Comedy Central airing a very dark and disturbing British comedy, ""The League of Gentlemen"". The show starts in good form with a strange and eery soundtrack. The humour is top class and clearly in the best tradition of the British comedy tradition. It combines the best elements of the Pythonesque with more traditional pantomime and the Northern comic style of Morecombe & Wise or Reeves and Mortimer. I haven't enjoyed a TV comedy this much since Fawlty Towers.  You HAVE to get this DVD.
The League of Gentlemen is delighfully in poor taste, totally irreverent, and yet the characters are endearing, despite their homicidal and psychopathic peccadilos. The show will rank with Monty Python and Fawlty Towers as a masterpiece of British TV comedy.",970617600,,828,4.956834532374101

1383428,5,B00004Z4V5,"This is a superb BBC comedy series, that is well acted and simply too funny. What makes it so great is the orginality of the whole series - be warned it is very bizzare, but therein lies it's charm. As the name suggests there are no women actors in this series, any women charachters are played by the 4 male leads.
This DVD includes the entire first series, which is the best of the two. The second series of The League of Gentlemen was a bit *too* bizzarre, and not really that funny.
The show is in the style of a comedy sketch show, but there is an ongoing storyline of Benjamin's attempts to escape the bizzarre town of Royston Vasey.
This DVD is well worth a purchase if you are looking for something a bit different, or if you are just looking for something hilarious. This series hasn't been broadcast in America, as far as I know, but in the UK it has won several awards. BUY IT NOW.",969667200,,892,4.252941176470588
1383429,5,B00004Z4V5,"Unless you have been lucky enough to catch the League Of Gentlemen series on Comedy Central, or, indeed, are a Brit like me who caught it on BBC 2  last year and this, you probably won't be bothered risking your hard-earned  on this vid.  If you stopped reading my review here I wouldn't blame you  either.  But please read on.
Ok, it's comedy, but what *kind* of comedy  is it?
It's a very, VERY black comedy, presented in mini serial format.  Based around a somewhat inward-looking village in Northern England called  Royston Vasey, the series follows Royston Vasey's rather odd inhabitants,  very similar to that of a soap opera. Nothing groundbreaking so far, I  know.  But what makes this series stand out from the crowd of other BBC  also-rans (""Keeping Up Appearances"" and ""One Foot In The  Grave"" spring instantly to mind) is the quality of the show.  Each  episode plays out with all the cinematographic flair of a classic movie.  A  major contributing factor in this would be the use of 35mm camerawork  throughout. The original musical score runs almost the whole length of each  28 minute episode and changes to reflect the situation onscreen, often  quite upbeat, but every so often rather sinister. The comedic acting is  absoultely brilliant.  The League's three actors (the 4th member is the  producer) have obviously spent countless hours watching classic horror  films, as each of them delivers line after line of hilarious dialogue,  overshadowed by sinister expression, and over-play.
The three actors play  all the characters - A voodoo-like circus ringmaster, a German homosexual  tour guide with murderous tendancies; a bizarre, almost creature-like,  shopkeeper and his even stranger wife; the butcher who's most popular  product, his ""Special Stuff"", is an addictive and secret  'something' only shared amongst a few of the villagefolk; a Job Centre  Restart Officer who wallows in her ability to downput her 'Jobseekers'; the  Cab driver - a big hairy bear of a man who wears a hot pink mini-dress and  stilettos... etc etc...
This Vid/DVD I would only recommend if you have  in the past laughed at something you knew deep down you really shouldn't  have.  It's that way.
If you are the above kind of person, though, You  won't find anything, comedy-wise at least, as cutting edge or refreshingly  new and entertaining as this.
If you do buy this, you'll want to tell  your friends to come over and see it for themselves before the end of the  first episode.  I guarantee it.",969408000,19,2501,4.915865384615385
1383430,3,B00004Z4V5,"I honestly love this very dark comedy, but the laugh track (and it's obviously painful it's a laugh track) really hurts. There are so many unique characters that make for an extremely interesting watch. Please, BBC, if it's in your power, get rid of the laugh track and re-distribute. Still, even if you have to put up with it, worth the watch, just a shame it's there. I own all the seasons, (only 3, and I believe it's  only 19 episodes)and if I'm not mistaken (and God hope I'm not), in the second season, they dropped the damned canned laughter. I'll update once I get there.  To all of those shows that have canned laughter, give us the option to turn it off.

1383431,4,B00004Z4V5,"When Ben goes to visit his aunt Val and uncle Henry for a one-night stay in Royston Vasey, it looks like any other bleak small town. Val and Henry are perfectly inhospitable in a way it seems that only relatives can be. Phone calls are not allowed until after six PM, towels are color-coded by body part, and there are no solids allowed in the downstairs lavatory. They even clean their cleaning utensils with other cleaning utensils. Besides this, Ben has to put up with lectures on self-abuse from Uncle Henry, who seems obsessed by the subject.

One night stretches into several as Ben's attempts to leave the town prove futile. At least at Henry and Val's house he's safe from the other townspeople, including:

An incompetent veterinarian who is the Angel of Death to any animal he gets near-

A pre-op transsexual cab driver whose hormones aren't working very well, considering the chest hair and very deep voice-

An extremely iffy local butcher and his mysterious, addictive product-

Geoff, a ticking time-bomb who frequently holds his two ""best friends"" at gunpoint because they surpass him professionally and personally-

The proprietors of the Local Shop, which is for locals only. And they're not kidding. Strangers have a way of...disappearing.

The most remarkable thing about this show is that all of the important characters are played by the same three guys. There are minor bit parts played by actual women, but all the major female characters are played by men (hence the title).

This is not a show for viewers who only enjoy mainstream comedies. This is a dark comedy with twisted humor, sexual themes, death, violence, sick and disgusting humor, trans-gender humor, and foul language. There is also some genuine pathos, however, which is missing in many comedies.

If you were to add the bawdy humor of Black Adder to the satirical humor of Red Dwarf and the gender-crossing sketch humor of the Kids in the Hall, plus a dash of mystery/horror, you might come up with something like this. Or not. Viewer discretion advised.",1294876800,,2045,4.904347826086957
1383432,4,B00004Z4V5,This comedy is a cross between twilight Zone and monty Python .Very funny but very dark in spots.,1251417600,,97,4.444444444444445
1383433,4,B00004Z4V5,"A bizarre and highly entertaining universe of crazy characters that plays like a sketch comedy show with continuity, re-visiting the same characters in various outlandish situations.

My ex-brother-in-law passed this a long to me this weekend and expanded my appreciation of British humor. Basically, it's the adventures of a group of strange, but lovable re-occuring characters all living in a small English town and learning about their various eccentricities.

There's a friendly, pre-op transsexual cab driver, a pig nosed couple that tortures out-of-towners, and aunt and uncle who have ridiculous rules for those who visit their home and my personal favorite, a overbearing job seeking course teacher who rules supreme over her classroom and keeps careful stock of her pens. Several more are introduced with each successive episode. It should be noted that all of these distinct characters are played by a troupe of only four male actors.

The zaniness of it it all could easily be played out as 5 minute sketches on Saturday Night Live or Mad TV and be forgotten the next day, but the wit and humanity of the characters makes them very endearing. Although there is some gross-out humor to be had (not a family show) overall it is the characterizations that bring the laughs.

It's like Mr. Show meets Twin Peaks.  Take from that what you will.",1248134400,,1350,5.0358744394618835
1383434,5,B00004Z4V5,"I picked up LoG after watching a preview on another DVD & thought that it'd be worth a look. I'd done a little research & discovered that it was a dark comedy, which also intrigued me. I just wasn't prepared for how dark this series truly gets. When I first started watching the series I was a little thrown by how devious & subtle the humor can be, but after one episode I was hooked. By the end of the series I was a die-hard fan jonesing for more.

Like similar series such as Little Britain, LoG surrounds the same cast of characters in a set environment. However, unlike LB the storyline is a bit more defined, with storylines carrying on even through multiple series. While none of the characters are really that likeable, all of them are strangely endearing in some unexplainable way. Even the somewhat horrific happenstances of the town are strangely enjoyable.

Would I recommend this to a friend? Yes and no. While I'm sure that once given the chance, most would enjoy this series, I do know a few people who would be truly offended by this series. I suggest renting the first volume if you are curious, but I'm 89% positive that most will end up wanting to purchase this series.",1212710400,2,1189,4.5
1383435,4,B00004Z4V5,"League of Gentlemen is a production that is very hard to describe without making many people to decline to watch on principle.
Big mistake.
I enjoyed season one very much indeed. It is ""an audacious blend of bizarre humor and horror"" but that does not serve to adequately describe its delight. The characters are memorable and well-performed throughout, and the tone of the show is spot on.
If you have the sort of mind that is bendable and willing to seek out the strange perimeters of humor by all means give it a go. I guarantee that you haven't seen anything quite like it.",1204588800,2,577,4.5576923076923075
1383436,5,B00004Z4V5,"I will make this very easy for you....buy all three seasons, only watch them in the proper order, at least for the first time through, and you will be rewarded with the most unbelievable viewing experience.  This is without a doubt the funniest, best acted, best written British TV show ever.  The League of Gentlemen are the 3 best actors I have ever seen.  Each play around 30 characters in the 3 seasons, most of which are reoccurring characters that come alive and evolve over the course of the show.  Every so often, new characters come in and go, but the core characters endear and grow.
That is why it is very important to watch this in the proper order as the characters grow, you grow with them.  This troupe of 3 male actors is best when portraying women, which seems to be an English thing, but all of the characters are amazing.
Listen....I cannot do this series justice here.  I can only tell you that if you watch this show from beginning to end, it will become clear.  The end of the show is just perfect.  The characters all fall into place.  They all make sense and you will understand the genius of the 4 who wrote the series, and the 3 of them who bring the characters to life.
Please, I beg you, try it...you will not believe how well crafted it is.",1203552000,,1269,4.365957446808511

TLOG is one of the best things to come from Great Britain's TV scene since Monty Python, and I can certainly recommend it for all BBC fans.  Just don't try to watch and eat dinner at the same time...  (You were warned...)",1174262400,2,497,4.51685393258427

1383439,5,B00004Z4V5,"The 6 episodes of the first series of League of Gentlemen are simply a taster for the two further series and later the Christmas Special. The League of Gentlemen are three English guys who dress up as a range of odd characters in the village of Royston Vassey set somewhere in the North of England.

These include Barbara the taxi-driver, a pre-operative sex-change man who you only ever hear and see in the barest of details - usually the bare and hairy arms. Then there are teh classic characters Edward and Tubbs who have the 'local shop' up on the lonely moors - they only serve locals and count to such things as ""eleventy twelve"". The Make up on these two characters is the best, they have their noses taped up and look completely inbred - and there are strong hints that they indeed are. Tubbs (the nominally female character of the two) wants to protect the ""precious things of the shop"" and both want to protect the shop from the threat of the road, which it seems is being engineered by their lost son David.

This is extremely off-beat humour. There are no real punch lines and the twisted stories carry on over the next two extremely odd series - but many story lines do tie up. Pauline of the Unemployment office whose dream is to open a Pen shop, Hilary Briss and his 'special stuff' and so many more.

If you enjoy this definitely get the next two series, they only get better and better.",1135814400,4,1403,4.45136186770428

series 2: which is the same as 1 however it has a bit of a darker story

the christmas special: which is a longer slightly different yet as fantastic version of the show

the live show: filmed when they were on tour with all the fave characters and some more, brilliant

series 3: this is the most controversial, you'll ever love it or hate it. It is a brilliant idea however the story focuses on one character per eppisode with a few scetches thrown in. This is my favorite, however it is some others least favorite.

Finally the film is being made, but has not been completed yet. This is a great show and i recomend you buy the first series even if you haven't got a multi region dvd and cant get the rest.

P.s. To the review that says that the only critisism is the added laughter, the show was recorded in front of a live audience and the rest was shown to them, all the laughter is genuine. Except series three where there is no laughter...",1098576000,2,1053,4.188118811881188

Unfortunately it may not happen.  I guess the 1st series didn't sell well but I can expect that since it's impossible to find in stores.  Amazon is the only place I have actually found it and, like a lot of people, I tend to buy from brick and mortar stores before scanning online.

And while there are region-free DVD players there's a whole host of problems with that option.

In North America you can't just buy a region-free DVD player and expect to watch region 2 DVD's.  While the DVD's are compatible the tv's aren't.  Europe uses Pal while North America (and Japan) uses NTSC.  NTSC is translated fairly well into Pal but not vice versa.  So while those in the UK with a region-free DVD player can watch Region 1 DVD's those in North America with a region-free DVD Player aren't able to watch Region 2 DVD's unless the DVD player can specifically convert Pal signals into NTSC and even then there will be more artifacts and video problems.

From what I understand, they sometimes show them on BBC America so I don't buy that line about them being ""too offensive"" for this country. Although I think it's a funny show I only know one other person who's seen it in this country so maybe the first season just didn't sell well.

1383445,5,B00004Z4V5,"It's good to see from these customer reviews that the ""League of Gentlemen"" has a following in the USA, and it's easy to see why. Perhaps one of the most inventive and unusual sketch shows of all time, TLOG is as likely to make you shiver with disgust as weep with laughter. It easily manages to juggle extremes of humour and horror, and it's grotesque cast of inbreds and maniacs are guaranteed to provoke a strong reaction. No comedy DVD collection is complete without Series 1.

 However, the poor old BBC has come under a lot of fire on this page for its refusal to release the second and third series and the Christmas Special in the US. It has to be said that this may not be entirely the BBC's fault. Series 2 really steps up the horror, pushing it to levels of offensiveness far beyond what went before. It would not surprise me to learn that the BBC is in fact not allowed to broadcast much of Series 2 on US TV, due to America's draconian broadcast restrictions (write to your Senator, people, it's a disgrace!). Certainly many British shows that are broadcast in the US (such as Graham Norton's UK chat show) have their most ""offensive"" moments removed - and it may well be the case that TLOG 2 would not be worth broadcasting in such a heavily edited state. Certainly this has been the case with other UK comedians, including the brilliant Chris Morris, probably the most inventive comedian in recent British history, whose hugely controvertial and appalingly bad-taste series Brass Eye and Jam will almost certainly never see the light of day in the US. If the BBC can't broadcast a show, then don't blame them for not releasing it on DVD, as that would be unprecedented.

 And also BBC America is a commercial enterprise - if no-one watched Series 1 on US TV, then why should they release Series 2 if it looks set to lose money? That's where word of mouth comes in, people ...

 In short, as has previously been suggested, the best thing to do is buy a regionless DVD player, go to Amazon UK and buy TLOG series 2. then buy Brass Eye and Jam ...",1093478400,4,2059,4.462765957446808

Evidence of its genius: I have seen all six episodes at least 20 times and still find it just as funny as the first viewing.  Really really good.

1383455,5,B00004Z4V5,"My sister introduced me to ""The League of Gentlemen"" a few months back, and I have to say I haven't laughed as hard in a long time.
I would personally describe the show as a hybrid between ""Kids in the Hall"" and ""Northern Exposure.""  It's a mixture of sketch comedy performed by men (often playing women), but set in a quirky town in northern England in which almost anything can and does happen.
However, although it has elements of ""sketch comedy,"" it's not just a series of unrelated skits like, say, Saturday Night Live.  It's a coherent whole of scenes in which recurring characters (all played by the same small group of actors) appear and play their part in a bizarre and outlandish world.
I have a feeling that if a person just doesn't ""get"" or just doesn't like English comedy, they may well not enjoy ""The League of Gentlemen.""  However, I think for a person whose tastes run toward things like ""Monty Python,"" ""Kids in the Hall,"" ""Northern Exposure"" and ""Twin Peaks,"" this will be right up their alley.
The humor is dark and unforgiving.  The social commentary is at times biting.  It's the sort of show that you know if they ever tried to replicate it in the USA, it would be ruined by the censors and network executives who would never allow the various extremes that appear in ""The League of Gentlemen.""  And, at least in my opinion, it is the bizarre extremes to which the show goes that make it worth watching in the first place.

At the local job center, restart officer Pauline is furious when Mickey, one of her slower students, lands a job interview without her 'help'.
""The Road to Royston Vasey"" - The new road is a real boon for everyone except Edward and Tubbs Tattsyrup, the peculiar owners of the Local Shop.  In this episode we also meet 'video hounds' Henry and Ally, as well as the truly-terrifying Reverend Bernice.
""Nightmare in Royston Vasey"" - Tubbs sees a map and realises that Edward has hidden the outside world from her.  Pauline cracks during a lesson about interview techniques and a strange creature is unearthed by the construction crew.
""The Beast of Royston Vasey"" - Mr Chinnery is called upon to investigate the strange beast found by the road-crew.  The Legz Akimbo Theatre Company makes it's annual visit to the town.  Ben babysits the Denton's weird twin daughters Chloe and Radclyffe.
""Love Comes to Royston Vasey"" - Mike gets married with the disgruntled Geoff acting as the best man.  The Dentons mourn the passing of their prized toads Sonny and Cher.

1383468,5,B00004Z4V5,"Please welcome ""The League of Gentlemen"", the comedy troupe who have brought one of the only decent comedies TV, British and American, has seen for a long, long time. After turning from a stage sensation to an award-winning radio show in their native England, the League brought TV audiences to their own little Northern England village, Royston Vasey. And nothing would prepare the viewers for the weird and wonderful delights they would bring. And like the best comedy shows, it is unbelievably compulsive, like a really good soap opera.
The first series introduces us to some wonderful, original comic monstrosities: Tubbs and Edward Tattsyrup, owners of the isolated 'Local Shop' on the moors overlooking the town; Pauline the restart officer, who abuses and berates her 'jobseekers'; Dr. Chinnery, the town vet who subscribes all of his patients accidental death. The list is endless, and yet all of them are given their moments to shine, not only as caricatures tailored to make you laugh but also as genuine characters whom you feel sorry for. The last episode of the series eschews some of the laughs and injects some actual pathos into the show, and finishes on a high that is both funny and ultimately very touching ... there won't be a dry eye in the house.
The reason the show works though is because of the talented troupe behind it, the core reason why the show exists in the first place. With co-writer Jeremy Dyson watching over them, cast members Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith each earn kudos for bringing all of these characters so vividly to life, and for rendering them as whole characters rather than some cheap laughs. And they take full advantage of the visual medium, as well as the budget of the TV show, to bring us some wonderful costumes and makeup on the characters, as well some clever-clever referencing to some past works of horror (""The Wicker Man"" and ""The Shining"" to name a couple).
As for the DVD, everything remains intact from the Region 2 version, which I bought last year, including a wonderful commentary from the League and series director Steve Bendelack and a few deleted sketches. Watch out for the second series double-disc edition (which I have, ha!) which has the 'local gossip' and the 'missing' scenes, as well as a behind-the-scenes documentary and music videos(!). And yes, the second season itself, as well as the Christmas 2000 special and the recent live show in England, continue the characters through to some weird and wonderful places!

Mixing often-dark humor with drama and some downright disturbing visuals (especially from the proprietor of the Local Shop and his wife!), this show really grabbed hold of me. Although sometimes the scenes can drag and start to make the viewer uncomfortable for a small joke at the end, this really is one of the best sketch comedies to come across the pond. Even with the occasional long scene, the rest of the scenes more than make up for it. This DVD also has its share of extras with running commentary from the actors, deleted scenes and some good background info and interviews. I couldn't recommend it more. The only problem is, Amazon UK is already selling Season 2 (which is the episodes I first saw) but in their infinite, greedy wisdom the studio execs have made it a Region 2 DVD. So get with it!

Okay .. onto the review:-
Once I got past my horror at discovering a laughter soundtrack (very annoying but faded away into the background of my perception with repeated listening) and no dvd option to play the thing without this track, I began simply to enjoy.
It's not pure comedy. It has pathos, drama and visceral horror. This is not comedy as U.S. network tv knows it. It's almost not comedy as British broadcast tv knows it.  I rarely guffawed and slapped my thighs with the hilarity of it all.  A little bit more than my comedic neurons were engaged.  The acting ability of the players is at a Sopranos level or better, and it's ""just"" a comedy, and they each play, god, maybe five different fully developed characters each. I'm frankly a wee bit intimidated by the talent of these blokes.
Even if you hate it, you won't soon forget it. No matter how extensive your DVD collection you will have *nothing* like The League of Gentlemen in it.
Buy, beg, borrow or steal this disc. (Especially if you thought, like me, that you had comedic talent yourself. After watching this you'll probably go, ""oh s**t"", and go back to your day job.)

The blood, sick and urine infested lives of characters such as Tubbs & Edward the local shop owners, the Dentons and their toad collection and Pauline the violent restart officer are totally sick and incredibly funny.

There is also a transgender taxi driver who seems a bit dated by today's standards (presented as yet another weird character in the village who regales her clients with all the gory details of her sex change process while driving them around).

And yet. . . there is also so much that is subversively funny. I don't regret watching this again but perhaps we shouldn't have let our 14 year old watch the first few episodes with us. Oops.",1451779200,2,822,4.578231292517007

7928304,4,B00004Z4V5,"This dark comedy from Britain holds up pretty well a decade or so after it was originally aired over there. I really like the intertwined stories / skits ... the Local Shop is the most hilarious bit of the whole program, and while most of the skits are very funny, some I found to be a little bit tedious hence the 4 stars rather than 5.",1379980800,,337,4.121212121212121

7928306,5,B00004Z4V5,"These guys look at life through a Gary Larson/Monty Python perspective. They bring the Far Side to life as it were and put it into a well-done comedic and often shocking drama. It took us a while to get our heads around some of the humor, but then when we saw a documentary about the writers/actors we felt a renewed admiration for their genius. Now we walk around quoting lines from several of the scenes. They get into your skin.",1359590400,,431,4.4
