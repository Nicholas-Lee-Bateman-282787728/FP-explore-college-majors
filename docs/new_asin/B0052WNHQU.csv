Africa, but watching this movie I thought I was there. GREAT",1317340800,44,133,3.7857142857142856
4531803,5,B0052WNHQU,"Recently saw a preview of this movie when a friend who works for one of the companies associated with the film did a demo for some folks.  I have to say it looks AWESOME!  All the footage was SHOT IN 3D in Africa.  I am told this makes all the difference -- movies actually shot in 3D vs. converted to 3D.  The quality of this piece is truly top shelf!  You can't go wrong buying this for yourself or as a gift for someone.  Some breathtaking footage of animals & scenery in 3D!  Hunter Ellis also does a great job as host:  taking the audience on a comprehensive Safari from the comfort of their living room. :)  If you want to see a sample be sure to ask them to put the movie on one of the big screens at your local Best Buy or other similar store. I think you'll agree it's a really fun, well made 3D experience for the whole family.  Enjoy!",1314748800,76,845,4.066666666666666

4531806,2,B0052WNHQU,"I have quite a few 3D films for comparison purposes and I just found this film to be unimpressive as far as the 3D effects go.  The narration was boring and slow...i found myself fast forwarding parts and I love nature films such as Planet Earth but this is no where near that quality. Just not worth buying.

Cons
- narration was boring and slow
- no real 3D effects( i didn't notice any OOS effects and 3D depth wasn't that great)
- seemed to be a few different cameras being used to film the movie and some looked better than others",1457395200,,535,4.235294117647059

4531921,5,B0052WNHQU,"I am changing my review from 1 star to 5 stars (see old review below).  There may be something wrong with the disk, or my player(Samsung 5900), or the projector because i put the same disk in again and it worked in fantastic 3D -- what a difference.  Many 3D bluerays will play in two modes 2D and 3D.  So i thought i would try again and see if i was missing a setting.  I cannot find a 2D setting on this disk menue, however it did play at least once in 2D mode???  At $5 this is the best value of any 3D BR i have (so far only 10).

I have a Viewsonic 7820 projector with DLP-link 3d glasses viewed at 120"" diagonal from about 9' distance from screen.  I cannot tell that this 3d blue ray content is 3d.  It says 3d on the box, on the disk, and on the menu, however there is no 3d effect (other than the title menus shifting perspective - cheesy fake 3d effect visible with or without glasses).  My 3d glasses function perfectly as does the projector on other 3d movies at the same sitting.  I (and my wife) can not see any 3d indications (such as double edges) when i remove the DLP-link 3d glasses; yet other credible reviewers say good 3D, and filmed in 3D on this title; so this leads me to believe the blue ray is 2d, and was mislabeled??  I looked at the first 30 sec or so of every scene, and no 3d at all.  For the $5 price i will not take the time to send it back, but i may watch it for the apparently all 2d content at a later date, but i was looking forward to 3d, so i put in the other 3d movie (IMAX Legends of flight / 787 aircraft --- WOW some fantastic 3d on that disk!).",1405728000,,1590,3.934375
4531922,4,B0052WNHQU,"For the 3D alone it's worth the purchase, especially at this price. A little slow paced but my wife and I enjoyed it. HEAD's UP for those of you who are sensitive or have kids, BEWARE of the moment about 35 minutes into the movie!!! Some natives shoot a calf in the throat with an arrow at close range and the host drinks it's blood. NO EDITING. They show the whole thing.

I would like to have known if they all survived but this is not mentioned in the film.  While animals are shown eating kills, the actual killing of the prey is avoided.  There were a number of birds and animals shown but not identified in the film.  The 3D is very good except for two very short sections involving wildebeest that just looks odd for a few seconds.  Since I have been on safari to many of the safari parks in Africa, I was pleased to find a 3D version of a safari as it looks so much more realistic than a 2D version.  Overall, it is a good 3D film about an African safari which I shall watch again.",1399766400,,722,4.114285714285714

4531930,3,B0052WNHQU,"This safari shows the big name wildlife in its interesting native habitat.  You get to see things like a mother cheetah caring for her cubs and crocodiles attacking animals as they ford a river.  Of course there are shots of carnivores chasing prey, but the camera never shows the kill, so the violence is muted and might not disturb more sensitive viewers.  Hunter Ellis is very enthusiastic but his constant smile and overflowing frequent comments like ""this is a once in a lifetime experience"" get on my nerves.  A little more BBC style dispassionate informative narration would have been welcome.

It is not clear from the information whether the video was made using genuine 3D cameras.  Visual Revolution Studios does make 3D movies with 3D cameras and many shots look like they were made in true 3D.  That being said, there are some shots that have post-shooting 3D added.  In particular there are some shots of running herds where the animals in the back are seen as being in front because they are moving faster, and there is a show where the legs in the back pop in front of the closer legs.  There were some other shots of flying birds where the area around the bird had distinct artifact bubbles and lines possibly caused by artificial 3D conversion.  Some scenes look like they are just plain 2D, but these are usually showing things at great distance so the depth would have been flattened.  Some of the closeups of Hunter flatten his face while the background has good depth.  There are also some scenes where the right eye view is distinctly darker than the left.

There are a number of spectacular shots of scenery and some especially nice time lapse photography showing the moving clouds and changing light patterns.  Towards the end of the video there are some repeat scenes rather than new material.  Overall it was enjoyable despite the blandness of the narration, and the occasional short 3D defects.  I am a very picky acute observer of 3D so I pick up on the defects, but most people would not notice them.  While not the best production, it does show things that most would never be able to see close up in depth.",1397260800,,2138,4.67379679144385

Not very good 3-D photography as well. And for a lover of National Geographic's Africa, this is a pretty amateur shoot. It doesn't show any actual lions or other predators bringing down any game. Just shows the animal being eaten after a quick shot of the predator. No underwater shots of Hippos or crocs. Very ordinary stull. Don't waste your time or money",1395532800,,544,4.677083333333333

My daughter had spent over three years serving as a missionary in Africa and I had seen many of her videos which were shot in 2d.  I thought it would be great to see similar footage in 3d.  This was very good.  The host talks to you throughout the video as though you are actually there with him.  The scenes of various animals, landscapes, and situations are very interesting.  The only reason I did not rate it at 5 stars is that occasionally the 3d has bad spots that ""pull"" your eyes back and forth.  After about a half hour it gave me a headache.

What I saw was Hunter interacting in staged, blatantly ridiculous interactions with the native folk (many who realize its ridiculous and roll their eyes) while sharing a Coke amongst poverty-stricken individuals who couldn't even afford one.  Ok, so where's the Safari??? 20 minutes wasted.

When we finally do see animals, it's all about Hunter Ellis, not the numerous species. His 'Wows' as some of them almost nail him. Boring... What's missing is the exciting 3D pop as we almost feel as though we've interacted with the animals...like a Safari!

If you want good content you should go with the Planet Earth series. I bought this movie along with the IMAX: Under the Sea 3D (Single-Disc Blu-ray 3D/Blu-ray Combo) (2009). I watched the IMAX movie first and loved the 3D effects. Fish swam up to you and you really felt as if they were swimming around you, exactly how I'd envisioned 3D to be . I watched this movie right after and was sooooo disappointed. The ""3D"" was in layers. I felt as if I was watching old technology. Just imagine you are watching your child's school play of the Lion King. There is a painting of the sky in the background, a cardboard tree in front of that, the kids are in the middle of the stage and a couple of cardboard bushes towards the front of the stage.

Sound usually excellent - I found it almost impossible to understand the speech of the African guides. Little gore making it suitable for most children. Might not suggest watching while eating.

There's two things I look for in any african safari type film: minimal harassment of the animals by the film crews and minimal blood from wild animal hunting. This film did well in the blood/gore parts, the worst being the feeding by a lion of a wildebeest then the struggle of a Zebra to successfully escape the grip of a crocodile, but missing a flap of skin on it's hind-end. The crew gets a little invasive trying to film the Cheetah family feeding and of the rescued elephants. This type of harassment is what caused the death of nature photographer Steve Irwin.  As a hobbyist 3D film maker myself I realize that closeness is required to make a 3D film but one needs to draw a line where capturing usable 3D shots and being intrusive is crossed.

It's a decent movie well worth owning and viewing again and again.",1330214400,2,1141,4.723618090452261
4532012,5,B0052WNHQU,"Having lived/worked in East Africa (where this dvd was filmed!) I have to say that the 3d qualities of the dvd were very life-like.  As with any safari you might take, you never know what you will see or what the animals will be doing.  On this virtual safari, you can feel like you're right there seeing the animals first hand.  On the plus side ... you get a good overview of some of the wildlife that live in East Africa.  Most of the animals are the standard ones everyone has seen before ... elephant, giraffe, zebra, lions.  The 3d quality was good from my perspective.  (I must admit that viewing things in 3d in my living room is still relatively new to me!)  I can say that it impressed my parents.  They both visited me in East Africa and have gone on numerous safaris themselves.  Each new friend my father brings over has had to endure a partial viewing of the 3d effects of this African safari ... accompanied by my father's own recollections of his adventures!  If you've got the right equipment to really enjoy the 3d features ... this dvd is well worthwhile!  You'll feel like you're on the plains as the animals wander into your line of sight!  Enjoy it!",1328054400,3,1171,4.420560747663552

4532014,3,B0052WNHQU,"It is definitely overpriced for a 50-some minute documentary. As far as the 3D gimmick, it is just okay and nothing extra-ordinary. Probably have to wait another few years till the 3D technology for home gets better and its accessories become reasonably priced.",1326499200,,261,5.093023255813954

For those starting off with 3D and kinda tentative about some of the more expensive ones,this is a real nice mid ranged 3D movie to buy,also read the 3D reviews on furthur purchases for tips,not just what the movie is about,HOW WAS THE 3D ???",1322784000,,450,4.934210526315789

4532030,4,B0052WNHQU,"A 90 min treat of spectacular close-ups of African animals & birds. Narration by Hunter Ellis was good & not overbearing that explained some features of the animals to make the movie more enjoyable and entertaining instead of only shots of animals. A rare 3D experience that puts the viewer right up close to animals like you were there. Fortunately, viewers are spared actual disturbing killing scenes after chases by lions, leopards and cheetahs and the feasting on killed animals is discreatly and only briefly shown(unlike Planet Earth and some other documentaries).
Movie is in 1080i like many documentaries currently shown on TV. However, some scenes were of somewhat lesser quality, particularily distance landscapes & an occassional nearer one. Not up to BBC or IMAX standards in all scenes in picture quality for documentaries. Downgraded rating by one star for picture quality but has great 3D close-ups. A bargain in entertainment for around $20 Blu-ray.",1321660800,9,965,5.232258064516129
4532031,3,B0052WNHQU,"i have a dlp mitsubishi and use the ""ultra clear"" brand of 3d glasses. at this point i have over a dozen blu-ray dvds. in all the qaulity is usually as good as it was in the theatres. personally i think were all kind of getting ripped off here, but i was growing up in a time when 3d meant leaping off the screen at you, not picture depth. it is true, they are getting better and better, you really do feel like you could step right into the screen. i still wish they'd incorporate a few more cheesy thrills of wanting to duck than are currently being incorporated in most films....
that however is neither case here. this 3d is very poor, looking more like distortion than depth. if this is your purchase point, you will get complaints from your audience (as i had to listen to).
now as far as film qaulity. i think he did a great job. the film moves well, keeps the whole family entertained. even the little ones behave and want more at it's end, surprising in itself as this is no 45 minute imax, but a full length movie.
in regards to little ones: although there are intense moments, there is nothing too scary. i find many of these nature movies my kids want to see, i can't take them due to the graphicness and reality of nature. he has tastefully spared us this and gives the build up and suspense followed by the occasional result without the graphic visual, cheers on this move, i wish others would follow.
overall, great movie, well made, parent friendly, and yes i look forward to his next release. just not on 3-d, pricey and distracting.",1321574400,8,1550,4.366782006920415
4532032,4,B0052WNHQU,"I am a huge fan of wild animal documentaries and it's exciting to see these critters in 3D.  I just wish they would leave out the preview ad in the beginning, and the scenes with Hunter Ellis walking around. I don't want to see a guy walking through a village, just show me the animals.  This is the top (and only) safari 3D blue-ray movie to choose from at this time so it's still a great experience!",1321056000,4,401,4.194805194805195

The movie was in perfect condition when I received it, the packaging was fine and I had no problems with the seller. The movie has way to many previews!! Half the content on the blue ray was previews. It was frustrating fast forwarding through half the content with my grandson sitting waiting for the safari adventure to begin. Once you finally get to the main attraction it's good. Just be aware that the previews go on forever.",1320796800,5,520,4.371134020618556
4532034,4,B0052WNHQU,"My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D, not the video content.

There are about 19 out of screen effects that extend 5%-10% of the way, from the screen to the viewer. Most of these are vegetation and hand gestures. Additionally, 2 times a branch poked out to 25%.

The quality of the in screen 3D is very good, especially when considering the difficulty of filming nature.

*** Not a lot of OOS effects ***
*** but nicely done ***

MY 3D RATING = VERY GOOD (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)

Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different. What I see at 25% you may see at 15% or 35%. To fully realize how far something is out of the screen for you, pause on an effect and direct a partner with an extended finger to the tip of what you are seeing. You may be surprised.
