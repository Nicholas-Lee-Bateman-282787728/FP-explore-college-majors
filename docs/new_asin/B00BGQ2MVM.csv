5620875,5,B00BGQ2MVM,"Enjoyed watching this movie, excellent acting and a good story. A lot of humour but also some sad moments, well worth to watch it.",1397520000,,130,4.458333333333333
5620876,2,B00BGQ2MVM,I didn't like this movie. It was just too depressing and not that interesting. It's just not worth the time to watch it.,1395792000,,120,4.260869565217392
5620877,1,B00BGQ2MVM,We couldn't finish the movie.  It was just awful.  I would give 1/2 of a star but it won't let me.,1392940800,,98,3.619047619047619
5620878,4,B00BGQ2MVM,"Mighty Fine  is a good movie but not the best.  It is good movie for family and funny movie, too.",1391472000,,97,3.8
5620879,2,B00BGQ2MVM,This movie was such a disappointment......I don't care to watch movies with abusive and egotistic men in it.  Not worth the rental.,1376092800,,131,4.954545454545454
5620880,5,B00BGQ2MVM,Story and acting is superb. Chas Palminteri plays against type and Andie Macdowell is great. Mental illness is a subject that most people shy away from. It's a different kind of family movie.,1376006400,3,191,4.818181818181818
5620881,4,B00BGQ2MVM,"It was a very good movie and not boring. It should have been shown in movie theaters first instead of going straight to DVD. The characters are believeable and show that not every home is perfect. Andy McDowel's accent could have used  more practice, but that's the only thing I didn't like about the movie.",1374710400,,307,4.581818181818182
5620882,5,B00BGQ2MVM,"For fans of Chazz Palminteri this movie is a must. He plays an abusive father with good intentions but his temper always gets the best of him. His character is a mix of his normal gangsteresque persona and the lunatic Phil from Hurlyburly. The story is decent but is left unresolved by the end, what shines are the characters relationships with one another and several fantastic scenes from Palminteri. This movie was a hidden gem for me, Palminteri's character was simply great.",1372118400,,479,4.853658536585366
5620883,3,B00BGQ2MVM,"This movie starts with an interesting sociological premise regarding a clash of cultures in the mid 1970's. Specifically, a tough-talking Brooklyn, NY factory owner and his family relocate to a more laid back, racially sensitive Southern state. There are business issues and family conflicts that also generate dramatic interest. Unfortunately, the film ends prematurely on a rather abrupt note. This means that a major plot element is left unresolved to the detriment of the viewer.",1369180800,,483,5.453333333333333
8568273,4,B00BGQ2MVM,Good,1458518400,,4,4.0
8568274,5,B00BGQ2MVM,Interesting plot and family dynamic. I like how the parents love each other and the father is completely dedicated to his children. It's a good watch.,1458000000,,150,4.8076923076923075
8568275,4,B00BGQ2MVM,"two people, husband and wife, who love each other but find marital harmony  difficult to achieve.  the only unifying factor in their marriage seems to be their child, who they both adore and love. WE come to learn that the wife, a former actress, is on medication for a mental disorder.  she exhibits many of the ups and downs that bipolar people are famous for. She is insanely jealous of her photographer husband who is constantly surrounded by beautiful models. Hes not immune to being attracted to them, but  hes not completely  committed to cheating on his wife.  to qoute jimmy carter, he has clearly committed adultery in his mind and while under the influence of boos and drugs, tends to go a little further.  Her mental condition, her feeling of inadequately satisfying him  and her sense of jealousy cause her to act out in ways that are embarrassing to her husband. there is an event that occurs to the husband at one of his out of town sessions that changes him significantly and further increases the tension that already exists. despite all the torment and misery of their situation, we see that they do truly still love one another, but we are left with the impression at the end that nothing will change. its a sad commentary on the effects of mental illness.",1457049600,,1275,4.660714285714286
8568276,3,B00BGQ2MVM,"Chazz Palminteri is a revelation in this and the rest of the cast is terrific as well. The film is best described as a pot simmering on the stove, waiting to blow over.",1456531200,,168,4.121212121212121
8568277,1,B00BGQ2MVM,Didn't care for it.,1456531200,,19,4.0
8568278,4,B00BGQ2MVM,This movie kept me guess. Nice story line and good actors.,1456531200,,58,4.363636363636363
8568279,5,B00BGQ2MVM,Entertaining.,1454716800,,13,13.0
8568280,4,B00BGQ2MVM,It was a good story about something most families talk about. Well done.,1453248000,,72,4.615384615384615
8568281,3,B00BGQ2MVM,"Chazz Palminteri was FANTASTIC in this. Amazing. The movie itself is good...the daughter actors were really good as well. Andie McDowell however...was awful. Her accent was terrible, not even exactly sure what she was aiming for. I mean, annoyingly bad. Good little story, definitely worth a watch.",1426896000,2,298,5.361702127659575
8568282,2,B00BGQ2MVM,The movie was good enough.  But watching the credits and seeing the name of the female narrator came close to offsetting any positive sense of it.  Jannene Garofalo is not a person that should be a narrator.  And she brings too much baggage with her not to affect any positive sense anyone might have from this movie.,1407628800,,317,4.526315789473684
