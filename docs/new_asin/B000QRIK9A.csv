2839731,5,B000QRIK9A,Very good story line lots of jungle scenery,1411171200,,43,4.5
2839732,4,B000QRIK9A,"I saw Peggy Castle in ""I, the Jury,""  and thought she gave a great performance. I looked at this film primarily to see her. She gives another good performance, and you can see that she's trying to break out of the traditional stereotyped doll roles that women played in the 1950's.
The movie itself is much better than I expected. It involves a love triangle while looking for a lost pyramid in South America. It is mainly a pleasing traveling for the first hour, but it starts to developing some suspense and tension towards the end. It does have a good, albeit predictable ending. This is a nice 1950's romantic adventure film with some likeable and interesting characters. Nothing thrilling, but a solid ""B"" picture.",1406678400,3,719,4.752
2839733,2,B000QRIK9A,"awful sound awful picture it jumps, colour faded, and it stops so you have to run it on. they should not release dvds if they don't remaster them first, this one went in the dustbin 3/10 such a shame",1398816000,,199,4.128205128205129
2839734,2,B000QRIK9A,"Soon after two of the movie's stars are introduced at an ancient Mayan pyramid, we are taken into rural Mexico for a fiesta highlighted by the ""voladores,"" four dancers who ascend a 30-meter pole, then tied at the waist, dive into the air and play pre-Hispanic musical instruments. Their leader dances at the top of the pole without a rope! Lots of local color in this film.

A photographer (blonde Peggie Castle at her most alluring) persuades a reluctant archaeologist (William Lundigan) to take a woman on an expedition searching for the lost Toltec civilization, and seduces a plantation owner (Armando Silvestre), fearful of ""the woman with golden hair"" as in legend, to guide them through the jungle.

This is a B-movie which had potential and I had been waiting for a proper DVD release. Image quality is clear enough, but it is an edited version and color hue is on the yellow side.",1190505600,5,890,4.7727272727272725

8197043,4,B000QRIK9A,Not a bad flick. Typical jungle style story with the love triangle. Played back good on Prime.,1478563200,,94,4.588235294117647

8197046,1,B000QRIK9A,"Many movies from the fifties are clever and the superb acting makes up for the poor film quality and the nascent effects, but alas, this was not the case with White Orchid.",1454198400,,172,4.40625
8197047,5,B000QRIK9A,A nostalgic treat,1453593600,,17,5.0
8197048,3,B000QRIK9A,"This movie was okay it really reminded me of Mexico back in 1950's & 60's.
Color was okay for that period of the time and acting was fine it could have been better.
Would I'd see it again mostly not movie was not boring it keep me interested.
Movie shows two loves one wins and other does not but it does have an happy ending.
Would I'd ask others to see this movie no I would not folks will have to see it on their own.
And decide for themselves it does have beautiful flowers and other plant life and maybe some history of Mexico.
Compared today with drug lords and radical Islam and terrorist invading the country.
But thank you for sharing.",1446854400,,644,4.2439024390243905

8197050,3,B000QRIK9A,started out good but dancing killed it for me.,1438473600,,46,4.222222222222222
8197051,2,B000QRIK9A,"The acting and story line were  generally poor and despite early depictions of local customs the film was ruined for me by the depiction of the jungle natives. For a culture that lives exclusively off of the land in a dense jungle; all of the men wore a uniform of a red loin cloth and red headdress. Each one was exactly alike as if it came from the wardrobe dept. from a Hollywood studio. No thought at all was given to realism. Then the dance routine appeared as if it was choreographed for a Vegas show, again with the dancers in identical fine outfits. Was there a fabric store in the jungle and sewing machines in the huts? I know it was a 1950s era cheap attempt at cultural realism but it fell flat. And the natives all looked a little chubby. Tribes that are hunter gatherers are about 5% body fat. These extras were hitting Burger King every day.",1435968000,,856,4.35
8197052,1,B000QRIK9A,"SPOILERS (that is, spoiling any suspense, but saving your evening):

The story: a gringo and a gringa, the gringo an alleged archeologist (alleged because he doesnt actually do any archeology and acts like a petulant junior high school student most of the time), the gringa a photographer, set out to explore an ancient civilization in southern Mexico, for which purpose they lure a local plantation owner to his death and virtually destroy the target ancient civilization by burning it down. Offensive to Mexicans, native tribes, gringos and gringas. Saving graces? None. Absolutely none. Well, OK; there is a brief picture of two macaws. Had they been the stars of the movie, it would have been vastly better, but instead they hired  whomever, not really worth naming. Terrible.",1419552000,2,780,5.133858267716535
