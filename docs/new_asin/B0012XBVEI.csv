8248108,5,B0012XBVEI,"This is in a format for older TV's. If you play it on a high def television you are going to be watching the movie in a odd shaped box. It was the format of the day.

The performances makes up for the production quality.  Outstanding performance by Joanne Kelly. I really felt sorry for her character, and that is what makes a movie great. If you can get the audience to care about the characters. Some supporting actors were better than others but overall good. I really was interested in the story and felt like it was very real for the environment it took place in. And Joanne Kelly was captivating even this early in her career.

Look past the low production quality of the movie and I think most people will the story interesting.

Note: This movie now also available in wide screen format, from Amazon:

8248109,4,B0012XBVEI,"I never heard of ""The Bay of Love and Sorrows,"" an independent Canadian film from 2002, but I found the cover of the DVD and the title very intriguing. So I picked it up, and am glad I did, as this is a quality drama.

The story involves a group of mostly young adults on the desolate shores of New Brunswick in 1973. All of them are working-class except for the nave-but-charismatic Michael. Michael just got back from India where he learned of communal living concepts. His ideas are embraced by the nigh-impoverished group, with the exception of Tom, a solemn young farmer, whose nave fianc takes a liking to Michael. The group foolishly shares these ideals with ex-con Everette, who naturally takes advantage of the situation, not just because he's an ex-con, but because he's older and recognizes the naivet of the youths. Caught in the wheels of manipulation, paranoia and misunderstanding, the situation spins out of control.

Although the cast are no-names (which makes no difference to me), the acting is excellent throughout. One reviewer complained about how the characters are constantly smoking, but the film takes place in 1973 and this is a group of mostly destitute youths. With the exception of the hardened con-man Everette, they're not necessarily bad people, just lost and spiritually bereft.

The movie leaves you with questions: Why does the winsome and well-to-do Michael hang with this destitute group from the other side of the tracks? Perhaps because his high pedigree makes him an instant celebrity, which attracts Carrie and provokes envious hostility in Tom.

The film was shot in Cocagne, Canada, on the lonely shores of New Brunswick, straight across from Prince Edward Island, although the story evidently takes place in Newcastle, near Miramichi Bay, about an hour's drive north. The landscapes are sometimes scenic, but mostly desolate and somehow haunting. Speaking of which, the low-key but haunting score is fitting.

If you appreciate realistic rural dramas like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Undertow/dp/B0007R4T3K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Undertow</a>"" (2004), ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Snow-Angels/dp/B001DN0V02/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Snow Angels</a>"" (2007), ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frozen-River/dp/B001KEHAG2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frozen River</a>"" (2008) and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Days-of-Heaven/dp/B001KT3JQ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Days of Heaven</a>"" (1978), films that depict the mundane reality of underprivileged youths in rural America and potential tragedy, be sure to put ""The Bay of Love and Sorrow"" on your viewing list. (""Frozen River"" doesn't necessarily involve all youths, but it generally fits that description).

The film runs 94 minutes.

8248110,4,B0012XBVEI,"this film tells the story of a group of young twenty-something friends who live in a costal town on the New Brunswick province in Canada (north of Maine).

there are no action scenes, or CGI, or explosions.  Just a story of how a handful of friends interact, and how some decisions they make led to negative consequences; such as drug abuse, legal problems, and violence.  These type of films are my favorite: a ""slice of life"" movie that takes you on a journey with the characters.

I guess I'm a bit prejudiced in favor of the film due to being a big fan of Joanne Kelly. The characters of Peter Outerbridge and Elaine Cassidy were also interesting and well-acted.

Being filmed in Canada was also a plus, as there is plenty of fine cinematography of the Canadian landscape to enjoy.

A independently made, small town drama film.  Well-done.",1306454400,3,843,4.655405405405405
