1872401,4,B00008YQ3T,"I noticed S. Roman was complaining about ""Season 3"" being the same as ""Season 4"" However, people need to be aware of something...

The U.S. run of Season 3 is the combined of the original Seasons 3 & 4 (since this show is originally Canadian) with several episodes cut out...Therefore, only get this if you have the *Canadian* season 3 otherwise, it will be a bunch of repeats. Sorry U.S. Season 3 holders, unless you plan to buy the Canadian ones, you'll just have to make do with not seeing the cut out episodes...or finding someone who has them.

Season 4 is, I think, a strong and consistent season for Due South although the ending to it leaves it rather open, hence The Call of the Wild follow-up...I highly recommend it, regardless.",1154649600,66,739,4.590909090909091
1872402,3,B00008YQ3T,"The quality of the DVD is excellent, but BUYER BEWARE:  if you purchased Season 3 containing something like 24-26 episodes, than you HAVE Season 4!!!!

I purchased season 3, watched it and then purchased season 4 thinking I was going to see something new.  WRONG! They are the exact same episodes that are contained in the Season 3 DVD set, in addition to the actual eps that belong in Season 3.  I can't tell you how disappoineted I was to discover this.

1872431,1,B00008YQ3T,This was not the 4th season: it was the third season with comments added. I already had seasons 1-3 and felt mislead by the term 4th Season.,1393372800,,140,4.222222222222222
1872432,5,B00008YQ3T,I loved the integrity of the Mountee and his relationship with his dog.  His fathers way of assisting him was unique.,1391385600,,117,4.571428571428571

1872444,5,B00008YQ3T,My wife has been a huge fan since this first aired. The fourth season was as entertaining as the first three. When series end they usually leave you with a void. This had a very definite end yet left an opening. Good fun.,1387929600,,221,4.162790697674419
1872445,3,B00008YQ3T,this is a great product if you have the other three seasons on canadian dvd.  If you have the US seasons 1 through 3 you already have these episodes on season three if you have 24-26 episodes. The canadian seasons 3 & 4 each only had 13 episodes not the 26 like in the U S.,1387929600,2,273,3.875
1872446,5,B00008YQ3T,Love Due South. This is a great series when you get the whole series. Very family oriented and fun show.  Love it.,1386633600,,114,4.181818181818182
1872447,4,B00008YQ3T,I like the manners so sorely missing in most of todays dvds and the 'good guy always wins' part in these series.,1381536000,,112,4.136363636363637
1872448,5,B00008YQ3T,Love Paul Gross.  A very good family show that should not have been cancelled so soon.  Not enough family entertainment on TV with out swearing and cheating.  Where are our morals.,1372809600,5,180,4.741935483870968
1872449,5,B00008YQ3T,"I was young when this show aired on TV, but i wish it had been longer, it was so good, and you laughed at least one time during the show, was and is still great.",1366329600,,161,3.6285714285714286
1872450,1,B00008YQ3T,"this is really a duplicate  of season 3. I feel like I wasted money. the big problem with amazon is the monumental lack of description.  it has caused me now, not to order. another example is the Hot Pot, I ordered a Rival but got a Sunbeam, even thought it works, its not fair. How would you feel",1360281600,,297,4.103448275862069
1872451,5,B00008YQ3T,"The dialogue, humor and interplay between the characters has not lost anything over time.  This will provide hours of enertainment.",1358726400,,131,5.55
1872452,5,B00008YQ3T,I love this series.  Too bad it had such a short run.  We have a family night of watching these programs.  It is so funny and relaxing to watch.,1355356800,,144,3.896551724137931
1872473,5,B00008YQ3T,"More like a two for the presentation. Seriously who designed the menu on this thing. I could have done a better job years with the free software that came on my laptop. I hear the Canadian version is better? But this is the one I could get. I love the show even after all these years and only wish that it had lasted longer. The tv movie comes with it so don't buy that seperate. I paid about twenty, if could do it over I would have waited till it droped down to ten because the menu is terrible. I gave five stars because I can't bring myself to rate it lower just because who ever was in charge of transferring it over to DVD didn't know what they were doing.",1354320000,,662,4.061068702290076
1872474,5,B00008YQ3T,"I just love this series...hated for the series to end
great characters including the dog
great stories, wish they still made tv shows like this",1334016000,,143,4.76
1872475,1,B00008YQ3T,"This is the Canadian version.  This is included in the three complete seasons of the American version.  I wish I had known this because I wasted $30 buying this since the company I purchased it from through Amazon does not give refunds. I would recommend the 3 complete seasons, but don't waste your money buying ""The Final Season""!",1265846400,7,332,4.706896551724138
1872476,4,B00008YQ3T,I found this to be a good bargin. Delivery was a little slow but still very much pleased.,1253836800,,89,4.0

1872478,5,B00008YQ3T,"This is the Canadian version of the DVDs, great quality, love the series.  I bought the whole series at the same time, they have the missing episodes that weren't aired in the US.",1245888000,9,179,4.424242424242424
1872479,5,B00008YQ3T,"this is another example of a great tv show that was canceled.
i love this show,it lasted only 3 seasons.
since it was canceled i bought all three seasons-wow-what a find.
ya know there's so much junk on tv that seems to last for ever
and shows like due south,john doe and brisco county jr. are canceled
sometimes after the first season.what a shame.these are all three shows
that(if you have not heard of)you should really check them out.",1242000000,5,438,4.556962025316456
1872480,5,B00008YQ3T,"I can not be objective.  I love this show, although there are a few clunkers but even the clunker are still entertaining.",1237075200,5,121,4.5
1872481,4,B00008YQ3T,"This is the CANADIAN season four of Due South. If you bought the AMERICAN season three, the one with Ray V on the cover, you have every episode on these disks. I rented the American DVDs before I purchased the Canadian DVDS, and it is true that the Canadian set has better quality video, but if you buy the American version YOU HAVE NOT MISSED ANY EPISODES. Even episodes that weren't aired in the US are included. The reviewer above, orchid1831, is incorrect.

 However, there's a commentary extra by Paul Gross on the series finale that isn't included in the American set. Also, the packaging isn't as bad as some reviewers of the season 3 set have made it out to be. The overlapping DVDs are a little annoying because if you want to get to the one on the bottom, you have to pop both of them out, but the disks aren't ""difficult to remove without damage"" or anything. Perhaps if you tried to grasp the disk by the edges and pull it out of the case with brute force you would damage it, but there is a little button in the center that says ""push"" and magically, when you push on it, the disk is released.

I don't regret my purchase, but if you aren't worried about the picture quality there's no reason not to save money and buy the American season 3 instead of the Canadian seasons 3 and 4. Personally, this was my favorite season, so I am happy to spend extra for the quality and the commentary. If you decide to get the Canadian season 3 and season 4 instead of the combined US version, look for season 3 on the Canadian amazon.com, listed at the bottom of this page under ""international sites"". It's much cheaper than the imported season 3 offered on this site.",1193443200,63,1668,4.374193548387097

7988206,2,B00008YQ3T,"so disappointed in this ""Last Season"" This is about the dvd, not the seller. The series had finsihed off strangely w/ everyone going and doing weird things.. ok.. but then the first disk on the LAST SEASON, everyone is different.. they play different parts.. Paul G. is still Benton F. but in reality he must have not felt well.. his voice sounds like he's sick... too bad... anyways, Ray's sister, the great actress Ramona Milano, is a deputy somewhere in a little town where the episode takes place.. she only had one small/short sceen. The Candian 'leader' lady, Camilla S. sings the national anthem, IN AMERICAN, not to the Queen, at a baseball game. That is the whole thing, playing baseball. The character, Turnbull, plays one of those baseball players, chewing something and wearing dark glasses and a cowboy hat. It goes on and.. just too bad. When Paul Gross directs and writes an episode in the past, it is grand. You can tell he had nothing to do w/ this thing.. or so it seems.  The 'second Ray', Renne, does a fine job o his character suddenly supposed to play baseball.. that's fun.. oh Camilla is a reporter and ends up in the locker room when 2 Ray is undressing..! (clearing my throat)  All the rest of the first and second disks ARE ALL RERUNS. Some are good.. I just didn't watch lately I guess.. esp the one where 2 Ray worries so much about putting a woman in jail for years and he thinks she didn't kill her husband like she had been acused of doing. Renne does a FANTASTIC job of acting for this part... tears stream .. at the end.. he does.  She was.. oh maybe I shouldn't say anything.. but.. as I said it is a rerun... ha.. extremely well done. I haven't checked out the rest of the disks yet.",1481760000,,1719,4.4335443037974684
