7985810,2,B00008NRKQ,"Literally only tells you how to assemble the clarinet, which is pretty obvious, and how to make noise, not even a note, just noise.  Very disappointed.  I wish I had kept looking.",1388275200,2,179,4.5625
7985811,1,B00008NRKQ,"I paid fifteen bucks for Play Clarinet Today and this is what I got:

A 28 minute video (actual instructional content 21 minutes)
She assembles the clarinet, and brushes by embouchure at lightning speed
You learn a whopping 5 (out of the 40 or more notes you can play) on the clarinet
You learn 3 fragments of nursery rhyme songs
She disassembles the clarinet and puts it away, wishes you well on your career as a clarinetist

I mean really.",1338422400,8,441,4.5
7985812,5,B00008NRKQ,This is a good beginners instructional DVD.  Andrea Bryk does a very good job of teaching the beginners the many different points of the clarinet.  I also recommend the book Clarinet for Dummies.  It has a lot of information and is easy to read and understand.  It also comes with a CD.,1313280000,4,286,4.4423076923076925
