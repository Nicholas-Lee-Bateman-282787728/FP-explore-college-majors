188197,3,1571208526,This CD is somewhat better in teaching the basics of needleturn applique.  She still does not go into what is really necesary to become an intermediate to advanced applique stitcher or how to do the advanced applique blocks.,1322697600,,224,4.894736842105263
188198,2,1571208526,"If you know anything at all about needleturn applique, don't waste your money on this CD. Elly shows nothing but the most basic of stitches, and very little of that.  I was very disappointed.",1322697600,,191,4.617647058823529
188199,5,1571208526,I love applique so this DVD helps to remind me of Elly's tips and tricks. You don't need to do Baltimore album style to use this DVD.,1322438400,3,133,3.962962962962963

I have been wanting to learn how to do applique in general- I do machine sewing and quilting and wanted to learn this as I hear it can be a very relaxing past time and the results are just beautiful.
I've all about given up on attending specific classes and then coming away not really gaining much. My last class, for which I paid dearly for, we barely got started when the class ended not accomplishing 1/2 of what was planned for. It was an heirloom quilting class, and sadly the instructor who is very knowledgable, is not as organized in teaching- so dissappointing.

So for now I've decided to look into purchasing dvds and learning at my own pace, things that interest me, Baltimore Applique being one of them, and actually being able to accomplish what I've set out to learn.
I researched quite a bit prior to this purchase, and Elly is an well known expert in this area of quilting. She's written over 20 books on this area. And it certainly shows on this dvd, 1st how much she loves to applique and can get down to the very basics so someone like me can actually apply what she is teaching. I like that she starts with simple things and tips, as in her techinque for threading the needle and why, all the tools that you will need to create your own work of art. Incredible.

The dvd is broken down into- Introduction, where Elly tells about herself and Baltimore Applique, Cutaway & Needleturn Applique: Inside Curves, Cutaway & Needleturn Applique: Inside Corners, Straight Lines & Points, Dogtooth Borders, Papercut patterns, Embellishments, Tips, Summary and includes a bit of information about Elly, and best of all, has downloadable patterns that you can actually work along with the dvd and create your very 1st blocks.
Love it!

This is highly recommended for anyone like me who is new to applique and would love to learn from an expert, without leaving home, and best of all, at your own pace.
And perhaps for those that do have experience, I can see where this may appeal to you as well, as there are always more than one way to do things and by watching her apply her technique, it may be of value to you.
She has a saying- ""Wise Women can differ on this""  -so very true!

Very in depth information, Elly covers all the details, even things that are probably taken for granted by an experienced person, but for us newbies, is important to understand and therefore learn! 5 big stars to this dvd.",1268006400,31,2495,4.511061946902655

7797325,5,1571208526,I learned more in the first few chapters of this DVD than I have in the last 5 years of doing applique... and Elly has such a pleasant way of instructing.

7797329,5,1571208526,"I had high expectations, and I was rewarded tenfold! I've loved Elly's work for so long; this dvd gave me the opportunity to ""take a class"" with her. Her quilts look so intricate, her techniques turn out to be so simple to accomplish.

7797330,2,1571208526,"Thought there was very little taught on this Cd for the money. really only one technique bridging peices for easier placement.
