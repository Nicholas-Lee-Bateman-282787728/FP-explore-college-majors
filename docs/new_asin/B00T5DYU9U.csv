7000787,3,B00T5DYU9U,"I pretty much live for bad, low-budget disaster movies, and with a name like Icetastrophe (or Christmas Icetastrophe, as it was called when it originally aired on SyFy), you know this one definitely qualifies.  I was initially disappointed to learn that the film was not a product of The Asylum, but I neednt have worried  Icetastrophe hits on just about every bad movie cylinder.  Its built on particularly ludicrous scientific foundation, features unknown actors portraying characters you hardly know and do not care very much about, delivers tons of CGI icy destruction that really doesnt look all that bad for the most part  and, of course, you have the obligatory romantic subplot about the towns very own version of Romeo and Juliet.  On top of that, just for laughs, the story takes place at Christmas and features characters with the names Crooge, Marley, and Ratchet.

So heres the deal.  A small meteor splits in two just before colliding with Earth.  The bigger chunk plows into Main Street of whatever town this is, then somehow begins to grow and initiate increasingly destructive flash freezing storms all over the place, turning those who get in its way into human ice-kebabs and plunging the whole area into sub-Arctic temperatures.  Its up to local Charlie Ratchet (Victor Webster) and plucky astrophysics grad student Alex Novak (Jennifer Spense)  who comes to see the strange meteor she had been tracking for weeks  to save the whole world from an icy holocaust while everybody else tries to find shelter despite their own stupidity.

I think my favorite aspect of the movie is Ratchets amazing ability to find anything he might need in his pockets or on the ground beside him  heck, he even has the ability to keep using a lighter he gave his son early on in the movie.  That tells you just about everything you need to know about Icetastrophe.  Its just your average, run-of-the-mill SyFy disaster movie: a slightly amusing little romp for fans of bad movies but an insufferable viewing experience for those who expect their movies to actually make sense and tell a decent story.",1432339200,8,2100,4.909348441926346
7000788,3,B00T5DYU9U,"I enjoyed the movie, but, I turned my brain off when I started the movie up.
It------r-e-a-l-l-y------became unbelievable when two people froze stone-cold
solid, thawed, and went on with the rest of their lives... and the end of the
movie.
Excellent production values; odd storyline. Worth a rental; I'll put MINE next
to another disaster disaster flick.",1432252800,6,354,5.228070175438597
7000789,1,B00T5DYU9U,"I'm only 20 minutes into this movie, and my irritation meter is going haywire. This movie takes place during Christmas in Montana, yet all the trees have green leaves. Even during on scene at a Christmas celebration, someone was tossing fake snow. I've lived in Texas and North Carolina and there were never any trees with green leaves during Christmas. Also, in one scene, there is a young man sitting in house that looks like it's under construction (from all the unfinished walls) sitting around in a t-shirt telling his father there is no power--in the middle of winter! Also, two men with no medical experience patch up some guy in an ambulance. I'm gonna give it another 20 minutes because I love torturing myself.

Also, on my Roku, Amazon had this movie rated 3 1/2 stars. WTH Amazon? Netflix seems to do this a lot--over rate movies.",1432080000,,842,4.6891891891891895
7000790,1,B00T5DYU9U,"A meteor breaks up when it enters the atmosphere which part of it landing in Lennox, located 80 miles NE of Olympia. Rather than burn up the town, it freezes it. People freeze and break. Ice stalagmites come out of the ground at random and knock down helicopters. Then they shoot ice bullets. An expert tells us this is ""not your garden variety meteor"" shortly after she corrects our hero for calling it a meteor and not a meteorite.

In one scene our hero asks the authorities, if the have ""experience with this type of thing"" as if he did.

The characters weren't great. The disaster wasn't realistic. I would recommend ""Snowmageddon"" instead for humor and cheese.

7000791,3,B00T5DYU9U,Not a bad movie. Not a 5 star but definitely not a 1 star either. I am glad I purchased this dvd for a disaster movie.,1431734400,3,118,3.576923076923077

7000794,3,B00T5DYU9U,"It could have been better, but it's watchable.
Icetastrophe is about a meteor that lands in a small town and forces the whole town to try and relocate before it destroys them by turning them into human popsicles. I liked the main character (because he was hot), but other than that, its your average disaster movie, not that great, not that bad. Don't expect much and you won't be disappointed.",1452556800,,394,4.642857142857143
7000795,4,B00T5DYU9U,"Because nothing says Merry Christmas like a freak cold snap caused by a freak meteor that runs hot and cold until it hits our atmosphere and splits into two convenient parts.  The cold part hits main street nowhere and causes flash freezing on a level heretofore never seen.  One of the first victims is a kid given to playing with dynamite.  Santa becomes the next victim.  Ho-ho-ho!  The level of supreme dopiness depicted in this sci-fi flick is truly unbelievable.  And everyone is so serious!  Youd think theyd never had a meteorite land in the middle of their town before.  Sheesh!  Surprisingly, they also manage to toss in a subpar romance of forbidden love between the town nobody and the whiny daughter of a rich idiot used to running roughshod over everyone.  The number of people he accidentally gets killed is astronomical!  Thank goodness a passing science student (Jennifer Spence) just happens by in time to help the handyman hero (Victor Webster) save almost everyone who wasn't iced by HUGE ice crystals.  I don't know what the world would have done without them.

Fortunately, I have a wacky sense of humor and thought this movie was hysterical.  Most will not, its an acquired taste.  You cant dress up crap with fancy FX and expect it to shine.  A plausible plot would have helped.  I first saw this on the Syfy Channel so I knew exactly what I was buying.  This was no pig in poke!",1448236800,4,1403,4.6571428571428575
7000796,3,B00T5DYU9U,"It was as I expected.  Story line was pretty simple and predictable.  I found this one family and the scientist really obnoxious.  I could tell you about them but I may ruin it for some. Overall, the movie was okay.  Don't expect too much.",1445990400,,239,4.363636363636363

7000801,1,B00T5DYU9U,"Leave it to SyFy to offer some of the most laughable science fiction or horror films that have made it to the screen in decades. Not since the drive-in fair offered by AIP in their heyday has a group made so many movies this bad. Perhaps bad is not quite the right word since these movies do offer some entertainment value. But much like the hubcap flying saucers of old SyFys CGI heavy effects filled movies leave you laughing at all the wrong times.

This time around we have a meteor that crashes here on Earth splitting into two pieces in a small mountain town. Among the citizens there are the town handyman and the mega-business owner who isn't fond of said handyman, especially since his son is interested in his daughter. As the town begins their annual Christmas celebration on main street, one part of the split meteor begins showering the city with shards of frozen meteor causing the freeze to rapidly spread through the streets. Touch it and you're instantly frozen.

As the terrain begins to flash freeze the citizens do their best to escape to safer locations. The second half of the meteor is more tropical and the only way to solve this problem is to join the two pieces, not a likely prospect since they're miles apart. Someone please save the day!

The funniest moments in this movie are the least intended. An example is someone crushed by a flying piece of frozen meteor that sends out a splash of CGI blood or a person frozen who then crumbles due to the extreme cold. There are side stories and people sacrifice themselves for the greater good while others who act like idiots are frozen, bringing on cheers from anyone watching.

So in the end is this a movie worth watching? Heck yeah! Its a no brainer! I don't mean that as in the choice is a no brainer, I mean that as in the movie itself is a no brainer. There is nothing exceptional about this movie and that is why I say its like many of the old drive-in second features that played across the country so many years ago. Its fun and hokey and just something thats worth watching for a laugh. Maybe its not worth adding to your collection but you could have some fun with it.",1438732800,2,2154,4.459390862944162
7000802,5,B00T5DYU9U,It was a good movie.. Unreal but entertaining,1436572800,,45,4.75
7000803,1,B00T5DYU9U,Very stupid,1436486400,,11,5.0
7000804,2,B00T5DYU9U,"Not sure if it was intentional, but I counted at least four Continuum cast members headlining this movie. And, to be honest, they're pretty much the only reason I kept watching.

I guess the name on this one says it all. I mean, ""Icetastrophe"" pretty much screams ""ridiculous disaster flick not to be taken seriously."" The highlight was probably the acting, especially if you're a fan of Continuum. And other than the over-use of CGI glitter to simulate ice crystals, the special effects were decent for a TV movie. I've certainly seen a lot worse.

Where it fell apart was continuity within the script and laughably bad science. The lack of continuity bugged me more than anything. One minute Charlie's locked in his frozen car, and the next he's standing outside an ambulance knocking to get in (how'd he get out of his car?). The ambulance is frozen solid and covered in crystals, but as it drives away it's magically clean and unfrozen. Two minutes after the big chase scene in the boat, Charlie and Alex are looking down on the frozen lake, which is MILES away (how'd they get so far, so fast?). Tim's split lip magically disappears halfway through the movie (hours after being punched). I could go on and on. It's like no-one proof-read the script to make sure the details were consistent. I know that's a little thing, this movie was just SO sloppy that it drove me nuts.

Then there's the ""science."" Now don't get me wrong. I happen to love cheesy disaster flicks and own everything from Asylum movies to Hollywood blockbusters. Believe me when I say my tolerance for stupidity is *really* high. But if you're going to make a good disaster movie, then you at least have to make *some* effort at believability. Because, hey, at least try to sound intelligent and I'll happily turn my brain off and just go with it. But the plot of this movie was beyond stupid. The entire 'meteorite-that-grows-skyscraper-ice-crystals thing' and 'sub-Arctic-freezing-air-that-chases-people-thing' was just too much of a stretch for me. My breaking point came when the frozen-solid people magically woke up after they thawed out. And hey, not even a hint of frostbite on them! Right.

Definitely stream this before you waste money buying the dvd. It's maybe worth a rental if you have really low standards, but it's not worth buying. I'm not sure I'd even fish this one out of the $5 Walmart bin, and that's saying a lot. No matter how much I like the actors, there's only so much stupidity I can take.",1436313600,3,2491,4.7592592592592595

Just as a small Washington town is getting ready to celebrate Christmas it's turned into a frozen wasteland thanks to a meteorite striking the center of town. Several cliches run around the town and the surrounding mountainside as they are attacked by horrible CGI ice stalagmites, and flash freezing temps while looking for a way to subvert the next potential ice age.

If you like goofy fun, and don't mind SyFy level acting and F/X, then this isn't a bad little film. Worst case scenario, it's perfect to put on while doing housework, or for a lazy day dozing on the couch.",1432512000,17,786,4.528169014084507
