8024313,4,B00029A8DS,"This is a very low budget DVD of the classic 1950s adventure series.  It is packed in a cardboard envelope rather than the traditional DVD case.  But don't let that fool you.  The visual quality on this DVD is, arguably, the best that I've seen on any of the Robin Hood TV series DVDs that have been released to date.  The episodes included on this disc have fallen into the public domain, so 16 millimeter syndication prints were used as the source rather than the original film elements (negatives and/or master prints).

Aside from the low cost, what's really great about this DVD is the fact that the very first three episodes of the series are included.  You'll see how Robin Hood became an outlaw, as well as his first meeting with Little John.  There is approximately a minute and 45 seconds missing from the first episode but, other than that, the episodes are complete.

This DVD is highly recommended for fans of classic television of the 1950s and/or those who enjoy costume adventures.",1093824000,2,997,4.689655172413793
