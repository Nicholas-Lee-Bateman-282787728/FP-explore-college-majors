7814443,3,6301734661,"This vintage example of schlock cinema is from the same clowns who gave us ""Frankenstein's Daughter.""  Take note, the flick has one redeeming quality: Irish McCalla.  Baby boomers will remember this statuesque blond as Saturday TV's ""Sheena, Queen of the Jungle.""  (Take a moment, guys, and recall pre-adolescent fantasies).  She plays a spoiled rich girl, shipwrecked with three men on a remote island.  No, it isn't that kind of story.  They discover Nazis who use scantily clad ""island"" girls as human guinea pigs.  If one blends Nazis dressed in black Gestapo uniforms, island babes, and bondage and torture scenes, the whole thing begins to resemble a '50s men's magazine.  The head Nazi and resident mad scientist, known as The Butcher, subjects the island girls to genetic transfers that temporarily transform them into monster women.  These ""she demons"" commit murder and mayhem.  Things get explosive when The Butcher lusts after Irish.  Just then, the volcano starts to rock-'n'roll and you know the rest.  Victor Sen Yung (Charlie Chan's No. 2 son) is around for comic relief.  Comic relief is really a moot point.  The ""so dumb, it's funny"" fan club will already be rolling on the floor.  The chief Nazi guard is familiar B movie character actor Gene Roth.  If that name doesn't ring any bells, he played the sheriff in ""Earth Vs. the Spider"" and ""Attack of the Giant Leeches.""  Roth also appeared as the heavy in some of the later Three Stooges comedies.  The Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, version of this little flick adds the scream queen's cogent commentary and plunging analysis in a rounded and thrusting manner.  ;-)",1010707200,2,1635,4.966789667896679
7814444,5,6301734661,"...So proclaims statuesque Irish McCalla (she was TV's ""Sheena, Queen of the Jungle"" in the 1950s, as well as a famous pin-up model) in this campy horror film. McCalla plays Jerri Turner, a spoiled rich girl who is marooned on an island with bland hero Tod Griffin, Victor Sen Yung as wisecracking ""Sammy Ching"", and faithful servant ""Chris"", portrayed by an actor whose name escapes me. On this uncharted island, they encounter Nazis who have been hiding out since the end of World War II, and the ""She Demons""-native girls who are being used as guinea pigs in mad scientist Rudolph Anders' twisted experiments to try and restore his disfigured wife's features. ""She Demons"" is so broad in its characterizations and situations, that it very closely resembles a comic book on film. The ridiculous dialogue, cheesy sets and laughable horror makeups only add to the fun in this enjoyable little flick. There is also a ""specialty dance"" performed by the Diana Nellis dancers, which will appeal to the horn-dog in many men. I may add that ""She Demons"" is the first film I remember seeing. I believe it was on TV's ""Chiller Theater"" in the early 1960s. I fell in love with the gorgeous Irish McCalla, who appealed to me with her spunky toughness, as well as her dazzling looks. She was my first screen heroine! ""She Demons"" defies any kind of detrimental criticism because it is so tongue-in-cheek (you KNOW they weren't taking this too seriously!),and just plain FUN. It is also charmingly sweet in its naivete-it is not mean-spirited at all. The guy gets the girl, the evil Nazis get theirs, and the audience gets a good laugh!",978998400,7,1624,4.803571428571429
