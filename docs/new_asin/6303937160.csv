732256,5,6303937160,"Love this movie!  I love Jon Bon Jovi, I'd watch anything he was in but this is a really good movie.  Oh, I forgot to mention there are four awesome actresses in it too!!",1395792000,,170,3.9705882352941178
732257,4,6303937160,I just got the movie today and watched half of the movie so far. Will watch the rest tommorrow. There is only one part of the movie I feel dragged a bit to long. The death of the woman's husband who got hit by a car while jogging. There was a bright of sunshine (Bon Jovi) and I liked Whoppi also!,1366329600,,297,3.8852459016393444
732258,4,6303937160,"this is a gift, am assured the person is happy with the movie...thank you for your promptness in delivery. item arrived in condition as promised. would use again.",1366329600,,162,4.821428571428571
732259,1,6303937160,Only bright spot was seeing Jon Bon Jovi. Plot was so dark and slow. Thought would be better with so many great actresses. Don't waste your time,1364256000,,144,4.37037037037037
732260,4,6303937160,"Whoopi Goldberg has such a lot of talent that anything she puts her mind to will be a great, Wonderful supporting cast and marvellous  story line makes a hit, a bit of this and that added as well has done wonders, bit of comedy added makes a difference, not actioned pact but has its own little catches worth seeing and buying for something different and for staying home for a special night. With munchies what else do you need. Thats all for now as to much is a dead give a way.",1334534400,,480,4.217391304347826
732261,4,6303937160,"I can understand by this movie can seem boring and horrible for some people. This is a movie that you have to be in the right mood to watch it, otherwise you will hate it.
Perkins' husband dies and she holds until (almost) the end of the movie to reveal what is really breaking her heart (is not just that the hubby died). Goldberg, Turner, and Paltrow, all with her different points of views, all with their own issues, try to help Perkins deal with her loss. Bon Jovi is just icing on the cake (mmmmm....).
If you are the kind of woman who meets with her female friends and discuss problems and really lean on each other, watch this movie. If you are a guy (straight or gay, does not matter) or a woman who thinks life is too beautiful and too short to be crying over the inevitable, do not dare to watch it.",1274918400,,810,4.198717948717949
732262,1,6303937160,"I'll watch the rest, but this is a pretty boring movie. You can't argue with the people who love this
film, but I look forward to erasing it as soon as I struggle through the last 45 minutes. (Luckily, recorded
from TV.)",1266796800,,220,4.261904761904762
732263,1,6303937160,"Her Husband was hit by a car while out jogging, she didn't know. She want the house repainted she and her friends like the painters backside!",1208476800,,141,4.461538461538462
732264,4,6303937160,"In the first like half hour of this movie, you will be doing more crying then you have in the past week! In order for the movie to make sense it has to be that way, but i was shocked at how 'depressing' that first half hour WAS....don't worry it gets ALOT better after that though.

Jovi is in the movie long enough for you to know he's in it, but not long enough that they really make a big deal about him being in it.

Really worth seeing a few times, but it probably won't be a movie that you watch all the time. just a heads up. good addition though.",1181260800,,554,3.9375
732335,3,6303937160,"Need I say more???  Seriously, while expecting quite a bit more from the story line(s) combined with the talent involved, for some reason this movie stuck with me over the years.  Honestly, I figured JBJ would be the flat, tiresome, gratuitous ""piece"" in this movie & was only in it to get some exposure (so to speak) & actually physically rolled my eyes when I saw he was in it.  And this is coming from a long time Bon Jovi fan -- love him! -- so that attitude was completely looking at it from a ""bet he can't act"" standpoint.  And was subsequently shot down.  Eye candy aside, JBJ was probably what kept this movie alive & I still just like it.  Never an Oscar contender, but it was -- lack of several resolutions aside -- a nice little flick.  Elizabeth Perkins, however, has not turned in a dynamic or raw performance to date, but perhaps she is cast specifically for her internalization method, if that's what it truly is.  Sometimes I would rather watch that reserved demeanor than the hysterical, energy-draining  overacting so many ""actresses"" (and ""actors"", to be sure) muster up.  I think, in fact, my energy -- physically & emotionally -- would be drained were I in her shoes & perhaps that was the director's take on the character & who better to play it?.  Who knows for sure... but hey -- Jon Bon Jovi -- way to go! :)",1142467200,,1334,4.448559670781893
732336,3,6303937160,"That is all I can say about this movie. The movie was O.K.

 but with a cast like this I expected more. Elizabeth Perkins

 and all the others do what they can with the material they're

 given. All in all very average. I hope to see Elizabeth Perkins

 in a better role soon. If you want to watch a good movie

 about mourning than watch three colours blue with Juliette

 Binoche.",1136505600,,382,4.225352112676056
732337,4,6303937160,I liked this one. I identified with each of the women in some way and thought Elizabeth Perkins did a splendid job. I thought it was funny as well.,1127692800,,147,4.103448275862069
732338,3,6303937160,"Throwing together famous names does not a good movie make!  This I had to learn the hard way after giving up nearly two hours to sit through this snooze-fest.  Elizabeth Perkins is so unbelievable as a grieving widow that you'll be hard pressed to find sympathy for her.  Ms. Paltrow was lucky to have boned up on her acting skills AFTER making this film since her role as the self-absorbed younger sister did nothing for her career.  Whoopie Goldberg and Kathleen Turner spend their time as if they've arrived on the wrong movie set and are looking for where to go.  I have no idea whether I was supposed to laugh out loud or turn the DVD player off completely by the time the foursome painted their faces and did a circle of prayer in the cemetery.  This was so ridiculous that the only thing that topped it was the ""rain"" that poured down on them upon their awakening!  The reason I gave this movie three stars was because Jon Bon Jovi does a nice job in his movie debut playing the house painter whose rear end gets more respect than this entire film should have gotten!",1125273600,,1074,4.4213197969543145
732339,5,6303937160,"Just a feel-good, girl movie. Bon Jovi is fab. It has several radical characters and you find yourself relating to each one in one tiny, little way...",1118880000,,150,4.592592592592593
732340,5,6303937160,"I believe this is one of the best movies about love and loss and endless friendship.  Losing the love of your life is devastating, whether that person has died or the relationship has died.  These friends find a way to lift eachother up in their time of need and find a way to heal.  I recommend this to anyone who needs a good tear jerker with an uplifting end.",1117324800,,362,4.217391304347826
732341,2,6303937160,"Picking up this movie blindly, I had small expectations.  All of them were based on what I considered to be a fantastic cast.  A meeting of female stars like this should have brought more emotions or depth to the characters in this story, but fell terribly short with flat writing.  Becky (Elizabeth Perkins) is predictable & tough to feel anything for, as an audience member.  She is going through a large trauma in her life, but acts & reacts with no extra sorrow than anyone would have.  Lucy (Gwyneth Paltrow) as Becky's immature, ""still-finding-herself-in-college"" sister cannot be strong for Becky during this painful time.  ALberta (Kathleen Turner) is their controlling step-mother, who leads a sub-plot which went nowhere.  She is attached to these females on a regular basis, yet there seems to be no reason for her to be everywhere with them.  And Whoopi GOldberg as Becky's troubled best friend is there as a support, but also as someone carrying around a sub-plot of her own that lands short.  The up side to this film is the painter, played by Jon Bon Jovi.  He plays a small role, but in his on-screen debut, steals the show.  This film had potential to be following 4 women through a tough year in their lives, but decided to avoid being that productive & adventurous in the script.",1103673600,,1298,4.75
732342,1,6303937160,"I just saw this on TV and it was the worst!!!! That stupid tear drop the main character paints on her face at the end should have been there for the whole movie since all she f****ing did was cry. By the end of it it looked like even Whoopi Goldberg wanted to get away from her. This movie would have been a lot better if it had been called ""Get Over It"" instead and somebody dropped an anvil on the ugly main character's head halfway through. Then Gwyneth Paltrow and Kathleen Turner make a marionette out of her body and make her curl up into a ball and talk about how ugly and pathetic she is. Oh wait, then it would pretty much be the same movie again. Avoid this movie! I want my two hours back!!!!",1083369600,,703,4.101449275362318
732343,1,6303937160,"I can't believe these glowing reviews.  If I were a woman (I'm a gay guy however, for what it's worth - ha), I'd be offended to be represented by the lame, one-dimensional, self-absorbed, annoying characters that inhabit this snore-fest.  With a cast like this (well, with the exception of Elizabeth Perkins who is a totally whiny, neurotic sad-sack in this movie... she's even irritating to look at) I thought it would be a decent film but I was WAY off.  If you're in the mood for a great introspective film on love and loss, watch ""Trois Couleurs: Bleu.""  If you want to see a cleverly composed movie about female camaraderie, there's always ""Thelma and Louise.""  Those are two films that merit multiple viewings.  But this??  Perhaps if you enjoy horrendously written, trite stabs at drama and even worse attempts at humor (the only time I laughed was when the dialogue got so bad I HAD to), you'd like this movie.  Otherwise, don't waste your time, I beseech you.  This is not a movie to watch while you are drinking a good wine.  It's a movie to down a bottle of Mad Dog over to drown the realization that crap like this passes as art with some people.",1081900800,,1158,4.550724637681159
732394,4,6303937160,Women mark time and changes in their lives in unique ways. These women represent all 'stages' of womanhood.  Well done.  I loved the way the women all made movement forward in the telling of this story.  Tells several stories in an engaging way.,1010620800,,245,4.651162790697675
732395,5,6303937160,"This movie is a perfect flick for a group of good girfriends to watch!  All of the actresses are amazing in this movie and Jon Bon Jovi adds the ""kick"" to the cast! This movie has a lot of comedy, honesty, drama, and tear-jerking scenes!
A Must Watch!! :)",1003190400,,255,4.204081632653061
732396,4,6303937160,This is a very real look at grief and its aftermath.  The actors are pros and their timing is great. The story is intense and moves well.  Bon Jovi is not yet an actor.  He could be interesting in  River Phoenix type roles.,989971200,,223,4.116279069767442
732397,5,6303937160,"I purchased this movie (some time ago) because it was great.  Many of my friends have seen this because of me and have all agreed with me.  Not to mention an AWESOME singer, Alechia James has a song in this movie too.  During the scene where Perkins is on her bed shutting the world out crying and such - that's Alechia.  I think this is a female movie especially seeing the review one male reviewer gave.",988502400,,405,4.2894736842105265
732398,5,6303937160,"Any of these girls (Gwyneth Paltrow, Kathleen Turner, Whoopi Goldberg) could well steal the movie from Elizabeth Perkins - but she got it back in the last few minutes. What I meant was they all gave unbelievably great performance. That, and other stuff (camera, music...) made this a must-see for viewers who hate wasting their time on overrated shallow ""dramedies"".",984355200,,366,5.116666666666666
732399,5,6303937160,"This is a film you do not want to miss.  It is packed with comedy and emotion.  Not to mention the all-star cast lead by Elizabeth Perkins.  She does a wonderful job portraying her character Rebecca who has to deal with the sudden death of her  husband.  With the help of friends and family, (Goldberg, Turner, and Paltrow) she will find the strength she needs to go on. Be sure and have some tissues handy because Perkins will make you laugh and cry right along with her.",969753600,,472,4.379310344827586
732400,5,6303937160,"Even though it was a bit predictable, this movie brought out many emotions. Being from a large family myself, I thought the differences in the sisters personalities and reactions was true to life. The incredibly  cute painter and his dog did add a nice touch. He was a great help in a  hard time. Everyone could use a person like this in their life. I highly  recommend this movie to women everywhere. (Men you might want to be there  for the after the movie cuddles from the females.)",956275200,,485,4.4772727272727275
732401,1,6303937160,"I saw this movie, I sat through it and was bored out of my mind.  The only bright spot is Jon Bon Jovi.  For the short time he is in it, it shines, or is than just Jon?",941932800,,168,3.3947368421052633
732402,2,6303937160,"Yes, in case you missed him, Jon Bon Jovi is in this movie... he has a very small part.  When he is on the screen, he's good... the movie isn't...  I saw this becuase of Jon, but I would never buy it, the plot is boring,  the movie is slow and you don't feel any kind of empathy toward the  charactors...",925862400,,304,3.9344262295081966
732403,5,6303937160,"I loved this movie...everything about it!  Would highly recommend, especially for women with good friends...who are close or far away. Well done.  :-)",918000000,,150,5.478260869565218

7855758,5,6303937160,This is a very good movie; slow probably to today's standards; but good recount of early 80's; and all actors; including Jon Bon Jovi are excellent!,1513555200,,148,4.730769230769231
