7209219,2,B00Y8BNPU4,"It feels like the guys in the movie are ""righteous brothers"".  Maybe it could have happened in the 80s, but not nowadays.

A drug lord, to exchange for the life of his daughter, let a policeman (Lau, Ching Wan) choose one of his two childhood friends (also policeman) to be released, and Lau chose Louis Koo.  Nick Cheung, who got shot and dropped into the crocodile pond, got saved by the drug lord's daughter and they got married and lived together for five years.

It may suggest that Nick, who felt betrayed by the policeman Lau, and saved by the daughter, might actually live on the side of the drug lord, but no, he was very righteous and he just wanted to give up his life, his wife, and kill the drug lord anyway.  This is very hard to believe and it felt like all three of them are ""righteous brothers,"" which might be the case in the 80s, but not in the 2010s.",1397260800,,870,4.280487804878049

8717728,3,B00Y8BNPU4,"this is a tough movie to review: all the parts and actors but timing is not to my liking. and hey killed off almost everyone I was interested in by the first hours. So my overall ranking would be ""I just couldn't get into the overall plot. The characters were great, sorry to see so many get killed off. On the really positive side, another reflection of home life for the cop., I fast forwarded thru that.",1455667200,2,406,4.285714285714286
