8056135,3,B0008FXT3C,"I bought this because Walter was in it. For me, had it been any other actor, the movie would not fly.

Speaking for myself, as a person past retirement age, the movie was too close for comfort and so I cannot give it a better rating. Others may not agree.",1356825600,,255,4.1
8056136,5,B0008FXT3C,"Hallmark! 3 excellent realistic performing stars. An emotional, heartwarming, story that is a viewing adventure. All that equals 5-stars at our house. It proves that LOVE is not lost and forgotten when age becomes apparent upon a person. Ellen Burstyn (Barbara Bush in ""W""), is astonishingly convincing as a grandmother passing through stages of Alzheimer disease. Her devotion to her custodial grandson consumes all of her sanity and desire. Jared, (Ryan Todd--""First Knight"" ""Backdraft"") acts like as seasoned an actor as Burstyn and Matthau. Walter Matthau (""Grumpy Old Men""""The Odd Couple"") plays Clifford, who comes to the rescue with his own idea for Grandma Lil and Jared, especially after they run off together in search of a safer world where they can be together, and Jared provided a future.

It is especially a warm tale for those of us that have advanced in age and know of the reality of growing old, fears of the future, desires of love--past and future, the needs of family, and of course, LOVE between man and woman. It happens folks, even after 60.

Too much information will spoil the adventure and journey of the movie. Just know that you will be glad you made the purchase. A DVD to watch repeatedly, for all the family, young and old. Watch it with someone, so you too have someone to hug at the conclusion.",1268265600,3,1329,4.824561403508772
8056137,4,B0008FXT3C,"'Mrs. Lambert Remembers Love' is an unexpected joy. It touchingly portrays the muddle, fear and yes - humour, that faces many of us as we grow older. That giant of the screen, Walter Matthau, lifts this movie from middling to great.",1265328000,,232,4.682926829268292
8056138,3,B0008FXT3C,Ellen Burstyn is a talented actress and does not disappoint in this film...but Walter Matthau is less than ideal. Overall a sweet love story...,1246060800,,143,5.0
8056139,4,B0008FXT3C,I enjoyed this movie very much.  The love between the grandmother and grandson is very deeply beautiful.,1194480000,3,104,5.117647058823529
