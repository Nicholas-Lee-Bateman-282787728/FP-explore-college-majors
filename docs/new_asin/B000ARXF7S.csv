2390663,5,B000ARXF7S,"I too am a US History teacher, and I would mirror all said by my fellow educator.  If I could share but one film on Vietnam with my students, Dear America: Letters from Vietnam would be the one!

Frank Yusko",1130457600,14,207,4.15
2390664,5,B000ARXF7S,"""Dear America: Letters Home From Vietnam"" is an extraordinary video.  While it is technically a documentary, it is a very emotional, educational, and interesting account of the whole Vietnam conflict.  While I am not some big sap, the end is heartwrenching and never fails to bring tears to my eyes.  To me, this video does not set out to make a political statement pro or against the Vietnam War.  It just tells the story by the soldiers who fought and for some, died there.

I have been VERY disappointed over the past several years that this wasn't released on DVD.  The soundtrack has some of the best music of the era.  Finally ""Letters Home From Vietnam"" will be seen and heard in the highest quality possible!

I am a 33-year old American History teacher. Were I not, I would still highly recommend this for those who lived through this era and those of us who were born after the conflict and only have secondhand knowledge of the time.",1130371200,11,944,4.5773809523809526
2390695,5,B000ARXF7S,"Such an amazing film! I'm very partial, as my father is dancing in a clip as 'Walk Like a Man' plays. Though he was one of the lucky ones to have made it home, he suffers from medical conditions from Agent Orange, as well as PTSD. The stories he has told me are heartbreaking, heartwarming, terrifying.... This film is such a timeless piece that captures true reminiscence.",1491609600,,373,4.582089552238806

2390702,5,B000ARXF7S,GREAT addition to a Viet Nam literature unit - replaces actual interviews if you don't have a person to speak to your class.  Archival film makes it awesome.,1466726400,,157,4.607142857142857
2390703,5,B000ARXF7S,"Combining popular music and archival footage along with 80s actors reading letters from American soldiers to their loved ones...the producers put you right in the scene.  Violent, touching, hopeless, heroic, doubtful and patriotic all at the same time. You will learn (or remember) what the war was like in all its horror and confusion. Many famous incidents and important events of the war are covered chronologically.  First-rate documentary without bias, just the words of the (very) young men themselves. This one gets to you and stays with you.",1464912000,2,549,5.2272727272727275

Actually, Vietnam in HD from the history channel is up there but this one is awesome. Hearing from the soldiers in their own words is just breath taking. The music is great too.

2390719,5,B000ARXF7S,"My wife Debbie and I met Bill and Linda Couturie when we lived in San Francisco from the mid 80's till the early 90's, and became friends with them thru, of all things, our dogs, They were so nice, and easily two of the most interesting people we've ever known. We lost touch with them when we moved to Marin County, but not before we watched Bill accept an Academy Award for his AIDS Quilt movie. This documentary was made when HBO was still a 'TV' station, and won a couple Emmys for it. It was, and still is the most moving movie, documentary, whatever you would call it, about the Vietnam war, IMHO, I have ever seen. I have probably watched it at least 2 dozen times, and it never fails to bring me to tears. They told us they watched over two million feet of film in the making of this...all either 'home movies', news reels, or stills from soldiers. Not one word of dialogue in this amazing film, that, in my opinion, can only be described as a labor of love...I know I'm going on and on, but it's so wonderful that it's now required watching in many high school history classes around the country...and this horrible war seems to finally be getting the proper attention it should have gotten back then. Please, please, if you don't own this, buy it, and if you can, buy it for anyone you know that may not be able to. If by some chance you read this, Bill and Linda, we miss you and we've moved to central PA, (the Harrisburg area) for Deb's job and would love to catch up!",1450051200,2,1481,4.274021352313167

2390723,4,B000ARXF7S,"This documentary, albeit not a thorough one, is an excellent presentation of the Vietnam War. It's CGI-free. There are no half-baked re-enactments. Real letters written by soldiers are read by a host of actors while live war footage and photographs are set to the music of the time. Be blown away by a series of stunning and chilling images and maddened by presidents Johnson and Nixon as they try to convince America that they're doing the right thing. See Vietnam through the noble, fearful, hopeless, fierce, and lackluster eyes of the men who were there experiencing the devastation of war. Whether you're just beginning to learn about Vietnam, or think you've seen all there is to see about a war fought 40 years ago, this film should be a welcome addition.",1438905600,,762,4.824427480916031

2390746,5,B000ARXF7S,"This DVD, though it dates from the late 1980s, has not lost much of its intellectual and emotional appeal.  This is a very well done production that is short on sermonizing and lets the soldiers (for the most part) speak for themselves.  I have used this DVD in a college level history course and it has been well received by the students. This is a very good primary document for teachers, students and those interested in learning more about the Vietnam War; highly recommended.  The period music that suffuses the piece is well done as well and really adds to the experience of the images and words of the soldiers.",1436227200,,618,4.6

2390750,5,B000ARXF7S,This documentary illustrated the true trials and tribulations of the Vietnam Combat Vet.  Extremely sad and heart wrenching.  This country did a great injustice to the Veterans of that war.  Many still suffer not only from the combat in Vietnam but the combat they endured upon their return from Vietnam.  Anyone who is truly interested in the true horror of that war should visit the Website - www. Virtual Wall.org. and realize what these soldiers did for one year of their life.  So young and what a WASTE!!,1434326400,,510,4.75

2390764,5,B000ARXF7S,"I received my DVD copy of ""Dear America: Letters Home from Viet Nam"" over the weekend--and it is awesome. I've watched it twice, and will probably watch it many more times.  I had it on VHS, when a vet friend gave it to me back in '89, but hadn't watched it since.  Having the 25 years of added wisdom and maturity has made me see it in a brand new light and appreciate it so much more.  It's a series of film clips (actual footage), and photos overlaid with the awesome music of that era and a virtual who's-who of Hollywood reading, in voice-over fashion, the actual ""letters home"" that inspired its predecessor book.  I cannot recommend this enough.  Maybe Amazon should add it to Prime.  Hint, hint.",1429142400,3,703,4.453125

2390766,5,B000ARXF7S,"This was the war that changed so much about America.  Young kids sent thousands of miles from home to fight a war that was so unpopular at home.  I saw this when it was on HBO, and it was a wonderful commentary of what these troops went through, to fight for one another and be vilified back home.  God bless 'em.  I'll never forget getting a letter from a Marine Corps buddy a week after I had learned he was KIA.  Just a heart breaking story of young kids at war.",1426550400,,465,4.065934065934066

2390772,5,B000ARXF7S,I especially liked this CD because I am in it.  Even if I had not been it brought back so many memories.  Must see for Vietnam Vets especially with tour duties in 1965 - 1967.,1419984000,,175,3.9714285714285715

As I grow older I wanted to leave something about my experience behind for my kids,grand children and great grand children to help them understand the experience. This tape, to me, speaks volumes. It is well done and the letters home are real with actors reading the contents. I felt that it was produced respectfully and with great feeling for the impact on the families and the sacrifice of the fallen.",1412726400,,530,4.474226804123711
2390789,5,B000ARXF7S,"Excellent, interesting and relevant documentary.  Unfortunately, due to a brief flash of full-frontal male nudity, not suitable for the classroom (and a real surprise, since it's rated PG-13).  A real shame, HBO Productions.",1411344000,,224,5.757575757575758

2390791,5,B000ARXF7S,"You MUST SEE this!  Every American, every history class, every heritage group has a duty to see it.

One of the best ever! I can't find the words to describe this film. It goes beyond documentary, exceeds art. The hearts of so many young men and women, exposed through their letters home, will stir your feelings of patriotism. Even more important, you will find these stories of boys becoming heroes, will touch your soul, your humanity and your pride in a generation forgotten and mistreated.

The importance of the many hollywood elites who read these letters  fades in comparison to the story told. I appreciate their humility in this contribution and the way the director kept the deadly venom of politics out of this project. He allowed history to be told by those who paid the price.

There's no award worthy of this work, except for the homage of tears, pride and determination that shouts ... ""Never again!""",1410307200,,916,4.772151898734177
2390792,5,B000ARXF7S,This is one of the classic documentaries about the Vietnam War. It was made back in 1987 or so but still holds up brilliantly today and is an excellent look at the impact of the war on the Americans who fought it as well as those back home.,1410307200,,240,4.020833333333333
2390793,5,B000ARXF7S,"Great video if you are a history buff.  Also, narrated by Robin Williams, so this is a collectors video now.  One of his better performances, and a great tribute to the men and women of the armed forces who served in Vietnam.",1409184000,,225,4.333333333333333

2390805,5,B000ARXF7S,"I use this documentary when I teach ""The Things They Carried.""  It is  a phenomenal look at Vietnam through a soldier's eyes.  For me, it was very moving having grown up in the time period when young men and women were going to Vietnam.  I didn't understand Vietnam but this movie really touched me and I got very emotional mostly because I was checked out and really didn't care.  This is so well done and helps students understand the severity of war and what it can do to a soldier emotionally.  Definitely buy even if you are not a teacher.  A beautifully done documentary with letters read so well by actors especially the last one with Ellen Burstyn.  Wow, I get choked up just thinking about it.  Very well done.",1403827200,,719,4.469230769230769
2390806,5,B000ARXF7S,"DVD was delivered on time.  Would highly recommend using this seller.  The guys at work told me it was a must see if you wanted to show students what it was really like in Vietnam.  None of us will ever know what it was like, but it does give you an appreciation for the sacrifices our brave men and women made in Southeast Asia.  Next to Vietnam in HD, this is right at the top for a sense of what Vietnam was like for our soldiers.",1401494400,,433,4.0
2390807,5,B000ARXF7S,"Accompanies the coffee table book by the same name, has a good ""oldies"" soundtrack and a ton of stars reading the letters.

2390814,5,B000ARXF7S,"Initially, I found this at the library and took a chance as I wasn't a big ""war"" fan but I wanted to try something new. This was my first one and I feel spoiled now and a bit disappointed that I may never see a better Vietnam war documentary. It was made in 1987 but you could never tell as the story is so well written and timeless. This film takes you through all of the human emotions a film should. You laugh, cry, reflect and it makes you wonder how all of the people who survived are doing today. The stars who read the letters put their most into their parts to bring out the very essence of the men and women caught in a very daunting situation.",1366934400,,653,4.069767441860465
2390815,3,B000ARXF7S,"Again, here's another DVD that looks like the letters were all run through an editor, like the militay chiefs or the politicians. I only saw one statement that was really straight to the point, and accurate. In the very beginning one of the troops said, ""we were not allowed to bomb sensible targets"" because of orders from above. Yeah, some of these guys do say it was a tough war to fight, but they never get into the real nitty gritty of why! Believe me, when you fight in a country, that's divided, but all the people look and talk the same, how do you know your enemies from your friends??? Answer: You don't! And then when your own leaders try to stop you from hurting the natives, by not allowing you to fight the way you need to fight to win, you are screwed. That's Vietnam in the 1960's.",1364428800,,797,4.32
2390816,5,B000ARXF7S,I had watched this documentary before and decided to buy it as a gift for my father who is a history buff.

I use it every time I teach a unit on the Vietnam War in my high school classes, and the students are always engaged.  The music is fantastic,and the visuals are very powerful.  Even though it is not a ""movie"" in the same category as Platoon and others, it still gives the viewer a hint of what happened in the war.  The the shots are all live and real...not planned or directed. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in the Vietnam War.

2390832,5,B000ARXF7S,"Dear America, Letters home from Vietnam will not teach you anything about the politics behind the U.S. involvement in Vietnam. You won't come away any wiser about S.E. Asia, the people in the North and the South or the culture and society in general but, you will come away wiser about the conflict through the eyes of the young American men and women who served there.

A list, as long as your arm, of famous actors, actresses, comedians, singers and notables got together and read many of the letters G.I.s sent home to their parents and, letters parents sent to their kids in combat. It's stirring stuff.

Throughout the movie, the songs of the time are playing to a visual of mayhem, destruction, injury, corpses and other vivid images the 60's and Vietnam conjure up.

There is a lot of, for me, unseen footage of the troops just goofing off, sitting around, eating, patrolling and just being young kids. Also there is a lot of Gen. Westmoreland interacting with the troops.

Also, the DVD shows us news reports from here in the states showing that weeks battle numbers; KIA, WIA and troop levels. As the DVD and the war progresses we watch those numbers climb, plateau then start to decline as America detaches from the conflict and finally detaches from South Vietnam.

This is an awesome DVD and, not just for the Vietnamophile but for anyone who is into American history. The perspective isn't pro or anti war but more a neutral observer reading us the letters between parents and kids.

About an hour and 25 minutes in length. The sound is very good and has been touched up here and there to enhance the audio experience. These enhancements are mainly the bombing footage we see and some of the battle scenes.

""Dear America"" intersperses the voices of actors reading letters from actual soldiers with archival footage, while playing period music and giving quick facts on the screen. The tone of the letters becomes more and more bleak as the chronology progresses- from many of them being hopeful to securing a better future for the people in Vietnam to many of them being disillusioned. Some are angry at what they see as lack of support from home.

There is some good footage of bombings and nothing really gross, injury-wise, to view, most likely because this was made-for-TV.

2390861,5,B000ARXF7S,"Our great battle in Vietnam was Long Tan, 1968 when 100 hundred Australians and 18, 105mm Australian Kiwi artillery, killed possible 2,500 NVA and VC in a rubber plantation. The battle of Long Tan took place during a tropical downpour deliberately used by the enemy to hamper ANZAC defenses. The battle was so fierce - Australian and Kiwi Artillery rained shells at one per second on a rubber plantation the size of two football fields as advancing NVA AND VC crawled over their own dead three deep. The diggers, a combination of regulars and ""Nashos"" were awarded the Presidential Unit Citation.
(Just thought I owed our ""Diggers"" their due before I begin!)

Dear America does a good job in giving you the ""feel"" of the war to the average soldier by seperating the ""Americans:"" the 19 year old boys who'd largely never been outside the USA from ""Foreign policy America"" and its ""falling dominos"" intervention in a 2,000 year of independence (against China, France, the U.S. and then China(1980-83 again), that Sen. Wayne Morse's warned would ""lead to the deaths of untold American boys - and for nothing.""

The letters home, trace well the shifting mood of these white poor and minorities boys: the kids with no money for the extended college enrolement needed to avoid the draft. We see these kids arc from cheerful youths ""mugging"" on 8mm home movies to ""grunts"" haggard beyond their years on TV news footage patrolling in(& to) Dylan's, ""Hard Rain.""
Others were bitter and confused, ""they say we're fighting for something""....""the whole thing stinks, really.""
Yet, as another soldier wrote, ""even though most men thought the war was being fought incorrectly and we would not win....they went out and risked their lives as if they were defending the continental USA.""

Aside from the  perspective of the individual soldier and the music takes (me at least) back to the 60s era, ""Dear America"" has the pace and structure of a Hollywood production.  In fact ""Dear America"" is so engrosing that at times you had to remind yourself that this was indeed real! For example the ""Grunt's Primer"" montage to the Stone's ""Gimme Shelter"" is in the same league as the ""Ride Of The Valkyries,"" Helicopter attack in ""Apocalypse Now.""

And, watch the title sequence for John Fogerty's ""Fortunate Son,"" the ""grunts'"" ironic anthem of the war. Personally, I think the sentiments of ""Fortunate Son"" are so telling that they should have gone up on screen as Creedence Clearwater played.
(I guess that, despite its 1978 release, Cold Chisel's ""Khe Sanh"" would have the same impact on our diggers.)

Fortunate Son and the rest of the music the boys listened to and their letters home combine to make Dear America as powerful a statement about war as the 1930 version of ""All Quiet on the Western Front.""

""Dear America,"" like ""All Quiet,"" is a well constructed narrative, that brings presence and even urgency to a war now fading into history.",1169424000,23,2925,4.894949494949495

Watching Dear America: Letters Home from VN for the first & only time on Veteran's day in the early 90's on PBS, I have found the utmost respect for all the young US men, women & their families who sacrified so much for that politically unwinnable war.

I totally agree with all the reviewers here in that I believe this is the best film to be made on the war in Viet Nam and the experience of the men (boys?) and women who were there.

My title is based on that while the movie is very powerful and emotional, the segment that always moves me to the point ot tears is the Christmas segment, starting with the Bob Hope sequence. After all that the viewer has seen, the emotion of the singing of the entertainers and the troops (especially the singing entertainer who unsuccessfully tries to control her emotions while singing ""Silent Night"") is just so powerful. When the the music switches  to a beautful choral version of ""Silent Night"" and a solder describes in his letter the night scene: a barage of flares and other pyrotechnics followed by the sound of soldiers singing ""Silent Night"" hauntingly in the distance (described, not heard in the film)--well, incredible images and music with the words of this soldier make this the most moving Christmas sequence I know in any film.

That, and the letter of the mother to her dead son at the end of the film which sums up the film, shows the human impact of war more honestly and powerfully--and terribly--as any film I know of, except perhaps for ""The Deer Hunter"", another great film with a similar theme--but that is fictional and this is real.

I also want to add that while the vintage songs are great, the original music is very beautiful and effective as well--and movingly underscores the deep tragedy of it all.",1140652800,7,1553,4.61231884057971
2390871,5,B000ARXF7S,"There has come a lot of vietnam movies over the years. Quite frankly, because the Vietnam War upset a lot of people. All the other movies does however have a plot.

This movie does what it is supposed to do. Instead of putting plot before fact, here we get a documentary. No plot. This documentary runs along smoothly, with beautiful and sad music, while letter, after letter is read so we can hear the REAL tradegy that the war REALLY was: The letters made it home, but not the boys who wrote them. So it is somewhat different hearing the letters being red, while seing the destruction, and human tragedy first hand. But it does become more real that way. I highly recommend this movie to anybody who want to broaden their minds to what the Vietnam War really was for many people, and sadly is for many people still living today.

On a side note:

Great for its educational value also:

Me and two others had a presentation in 1998 about the Vietnam War, and how terrible it truly was. We only had this movie as our source of information.

2390872,4,B000ARXF7S,"While visiting friends in Washington DC during the spring of 1989, I saw for the first and only time what I believe to have been the full-length version (132 minutes) of 'Dear America'. Having a close friend who fought in Vietnam and contributed to Edelman's book, I was naturally very interested. It was deeply moving. Since then, only the 86-minute version seems to have been screened and made available on video. I had hoped that the DVD, which was a long time coming, would offer the programme complete and am bitterly disappointed that the central section - harrowing but absolutely vital to its integrity - is still missing. This appears to make the gradual transition from the escalation of the war and its darkening mood to withdrawal and aftermath much too abrupt. In short, for me the impact of the film has been seriously undermined. What a shame! Is there even a small chance that HBO will think again and give us the uncut version soon?",1139961600,4,949,4.72289156626506
2390873,5,B000ARXF7S,"This is an outstanding piece on Vietnam. I recall seeing it when it first aired on HBO and have wanted to get it ever since. I agree completely with the other two reviews and suggest this for anyone looking for an unbiased account of the period. I took a class at the University of Michigan called the History of the Vietnam War and we did not view the movie as part of the class; however, the professor and teaching assistants all agreed that it is one of the best pieces on the war. It will touch you and probably bring a tear to your eye, but it is well worth it.

I've been waiting for a long time for it to come out in an affordable format. I recall trying to purchase it in VHS format close to 10 years ago, but it was $50-$75. By the time the price actually came down DVD's were coming out and I wanted to wait for the cleaner, better format.

If you enjoy pieces about Vietnam, war, history, or documentaries you can't go wrong with this DVD.",1131494400,11,950,4.157608695652174

We first analyze the songs that are used in the video (which are all chosen for a reason to he used in the film) then we watch the video, analyzing the soldiers letters home.  The students laugh, cry, feel shocked, sad, and ultimately humbled and filled with respect for the men and women who served in Vietnam.  It's an incredible documentary.
