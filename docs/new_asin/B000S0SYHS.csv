8203677,2,B000S0SYHS,"The movie starts out with promise with a ""Saw-like"" scene with a female in a fuzzy g-string tied up and being tortured. It mentions the music sound track by Dennis Dreith in the opening credits and on the DVD cover. I was expecting a great sound track. The good music starts when they run the closing credits. There is an added music video that was better than the movie itself. The surreal scene tossed in the middle of the movie was different. The movie had moments of imagination and twists, but the overall writing and editing failed. Warning: the movie does have nudity and a scene of forced incest. The movie could have been better if they simply made one of the burglars a female. Watching four bad male actors torture each other gets old.",1274572800,,746,4.533333333333333
8203678,3,B000S0SYHS,"Not the best, but not the worst low-budget flick.
There's relatively no story,
so they try to trump it up with extreme violence, that basically comes across as tepid,
due to the lack of gore, and feelings for any of the mis-guided characters.
After a while it just felt like the director wanted to make his audience squirm,
and was doing everything within his budget to make that happen.
But it felt forced.
(forced incest, mop-stick rape, swallowed glass,
& a force-fed rat make up a bulk of the depravities)
Nothing terribly original here.
It opens with 2 burglars robbing a house,
when they come across a battered man tied to a bed.
Instead of leaving, (like any rational person would) they continue to pilfer,
until they too are captured, and tortured, by the most hatable villian in recent memory.
(IF YOU HATE MINDLESS TORTURE, STEER CLEAR!!!)

MORAL OF THE STORY:
When pointless violence is rammed down your throat, you gag.",1205366400,5,931,4.782608695652174
8203679,1,B000S0SYHS,"First, let me say, the only GOOD thing about this movie is I didn't buy it.  The second good thing is it came as a ""free"" rental.  Now for the bad part...

My title best describes this because the movie is so poorly made, so poorly acted, so poorly edited, and so poorly directed, it numbs better than an shot of novocaine you'd get at a dentist's office.  The premise is two burglars break into a mansion in the Hollywood Hills(?) in search of ""treasure""--why, you'll never know.  They come up empty at the main house and decide to tool on down to the guest house where...BINGO...they find a safe--and a beaten body of a man bound and gagged on a set of box springs (sans mattress).  Deceased Chicago Tribune reviewer Gene Siskel used to say ""ask yourself if you would act this way"" to gauge the believability of the movie.  If you do here, the movie is over in 10 minutes.  Not only do the burglars go about their business as if NOTHING is on that bed, they don't even try to free the man.  One of the burglars keep saying, ""let's get out of here;"" the only can only reply, ""not till I get that f***iing money.""  You never know why they need the money (of course I may have slept through that part) and, you know what, I really didn't care.  And if that's not bad enough, they get TWO MORE OPPORTUNITIES to get the hell out of Dodge, but stay right there.

All I ask from any movie is to entertain me, although I'll be the first to admit I'm not that easily entertained.  But when a director decides to hell with any kind of logic and, in turn, winds up insulting any person with one remaining brail cell's intelligence, THAT'S when I get really ticked off.

Other reviews have said how twisted and sick and gruesome and blah, blah, blah, this movie is.  I guess it is--if you like grade D trash complete with brown blood and the absolute WORST makeup you'll ever see.

This enormous bowel movement is 81 minutes long and I swear it's unwatchable.  As badly as I despised HOSTEL, I would rather watch that again than have to come within a country mile of this.  Oh, lest I forget, it was gaggingly directed (and I use that term VERY loosely) by Scott W. McKinlay.",1196208000,9,2165,4.330024813895782
8203680,1,B000S0SYHS,"The movie actually sounded very good, when I read about it. But when I actually recieved it, and watched it, I was very dissapointed. Its like a b rated movie. It will go into my movie collection, but I'm very sure that it will just end up collecting dust through the coming years",1196035200,3,280,4.30188679245283
8203681,1,B000S0SYHS,I just bought this movie a couple days ago because I read the reviews of it on amazon. I am a BIG horror movie fan I perfer the 80's american & italian horror movies. I just figured hey I'll try it. GRANTED I have lots of good movies from just listening to peoples reviews & going based on the amount of stars. BUT THIS MOVIE REEEEEALLY SUCKS!The people who put good reviews about this movie must not have ANY taiste in horror movies AT ALL.If you are reading this take it from a REAL horror movie fan DON'T GET IT!!!!!!!!!YOU'LL WAIST YOUR MONEY.The cover is deceiving it may look good but it really isnt. It looks like something from SAW (the cover)that's how they get you.,1195516800,6,675,4.365079365079365
8203682,5,B000S0SYHS,For a straight to video release the quality is excellent. And the story was definitely interesting. This film creeps up on you and  starts off slow but Boy OH Boy does it get gruesome ! You will really hate the end of this film that is all I have to say. And you will hate the lead character for sure for all of his reasoning. For the 1st time I actually was rooting for the thieves LOL ! Noone is good in this film so you have to pick sides or just watch for the pleasure of mayhem !,1194912000,5,484,3.888888888888889
8203683,4,B000S0SYHS,"At first the movie seems slow paced and boring but when the gruesome parts begin, you'll know it and it's not easy to watch.  Incest and child abuse are the two things that turn my stomach and in this movie, the incest made my stomach do flips.  I stopped watching the movie with another 30 minutes to go because I just COULDN'T watch it.  I do recommend the movie if you want your butt to cringe but I don't recommend it to the faint heart.",1193011200,8,441,4.1647058823529415
