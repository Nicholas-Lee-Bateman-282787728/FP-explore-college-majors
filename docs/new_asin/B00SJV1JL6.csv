8698682,5,B00SJV1JL6,If you want to run for office in  Washington D.C this is the film to watch.  The film explains how both parties violated the people trust and are tax money it shows how they bent the law to fit their own needs and ideas also issues it shows how they dance around the truth.  I also believe it shows they are aware of are money issue and know we need to cut things out and reduce wasteful  use of money but are scared of being voted out.  If everyone in the country watched this things could get better.,1440892800,4,502,4.081632653061225
8698683,3,B00SJV1JL6,"Its nice to own this film which presents an overview of several recent political US federal administrations, led by the president of each time, featured.
My only cirticism is that it is a gloss over of these years; however, it is overall very well presented over a long period of time condensed. And the data and testimony is compiled with care and is well organized. It suggests either further personal investigation, or a basic understanding of what the film reveals.",1437264000,5,469,4.875
