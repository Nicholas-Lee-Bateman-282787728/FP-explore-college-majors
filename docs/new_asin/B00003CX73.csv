1263156,5,B00003CX73,"A great comedy/action flick on the surface, with profound subtext running underneath.  Even if you don't catch all the symbolism, it still makes for a great war movie and eye-opening revelation to our policies in the Gulf  War, how the rest of the world see's America, and often-ignored glimpse at  the Iraqi perspective.  Beyond that, the film is replete with symbolism  about America's own special brand of ingenuity and risk-taking that's led  to our economic and cultural dominance, coupled with American's brashness,  greed and hypocracy.",949363200,,543,5.317647058823529
1263157,5,B00003CX73,"When I saw 3 Kings in the theater, I wasn't expecting a whole lot, just a low budget war movie.  Let me tell you, this was by far the best movie I saw in '99 and I was shocked to hell about it.  The movie centers on 4 GI's  in the Gulf War who find out that Sadaam has millions of $$ in gold hidden  in one of his bunkers.  The set out to find the gold and take it home to  retire and lead the good life for awhile.  Once they do find it, they  realize that the US troops have left the paupers to perish.  When Sadaam's  troops mercilessly kill a defenseless woman, the Clooney clan alter their  mission to save the commoners and to redeem themselves.  Clooney was  excellent as the 'man in charge' who finally has to put his selfish motives  aside and do what's right. Wahlberg is a revelation in his role as a man  who just wants to see his family.  Normally I don't recommend too many  movies this highly, but this is a can't miss!  Forget private ryan and all  his brothers and give Clooney, Wahlberg and the Cube 2 hours of your time-",949104000,,1039,4.079601990049751

As with Blackhawk down, it disturbs me to see a scene in this film where a young U.S. soldier hesitates to shoot and kill the enemy.  ""Are we shooting people?"" Mark Wahlberg's character asks his buddies as an enemy approaches.  Luckily, he blew the enemy's head off.

This film is like a military version of Ocean's Eleven.  It's all about the bullion - no, not the soup!

1263438,3,B00003CX73,"The movie 3 Kings is not really bad film it is just overly predictable.  The idea of literally finding a ton of gold sounds like a great idea but how would you realistically transport it out of the Middle East and back to the US without drawing attention to yourself.  I find it unbelievable that the 3 main thieves would suddenly find their conscience after they pilferage the majority of the gold.

And why is it in every war movie the guy from the south is always portrayed like he is a Neanderthal who cannot read or write.  The film takes place in the 1990's not the 1860's.  That is insulting as well as stupid.  Before Sept 11th, the army would be hand selecting the best capable soldiers not drafting a bunch of rejects.

It would made more sense if the soldiers would have swiped 10 bars apiece or something they could realistically get back home and profit from.  As for the villagers infighting, when it comes to religion and politics those people will be fighting now and hundreds of years from now over the same issues.  Similar to the Israel and Palestinians conflict.  It's not like helping a few of them was going to make a difference or radically change their lives.

If you had over a million dollars worth of unsecured wealth in the middle of the dessert are you really going to give a damn about the local villagers livelihood.  Odds are your not going to give a **** about the people and their problems.

Most likely you would have on your mind which superiors needed to be paid off to get the merchandise back home.  The next step would be finding out a way to ship the gold in a Humvee or Tank/troop carrier through the merchant marines shipping.  Gold bouillon is not exactly like hard cash, you can't just exchange it at an ATM machine.  You would need to find a bank that would transfer you the money and accept the product without asking questions.

I like George Clooney, Ice Cube and Mark Wahlberg.  All 3 actors have been in several good movies.  But for some reason I never cared too much for this film.  It starts out good the first 45 minutes then becomes unbelievable.  A much better heist military film would be the Clint Eastwood movie Kelly's Heroes set in WW2.  That film may be farfetched as well but it had better music and was a more enjoyable film overall.  I would give rate 3 Kings a 3 star movie the first half is good then it just goes downhill.",1440720000,,2391,4.421052631578948

1263442,4,B00003CX73,"I first saw this film in the theater in 1999. The film is set at the end of the first Gulf War in 1991. It begins as a caper film with large helpings of ironic humor, but turns serious at the end as the protagonists abandon their quest for Saddam's stolen Kuwaiti gold and focus instead on saving some villagers who are in danger of being murdered by Saddam's troops. Although I don't share George Clooney's politics in real life, I enjoy his screen performances and regard his appearance in a film as improving the likelihood I will enjoy it. Certainly in the case of Three Kings, Clooney didn't disappoint. He plays a likeable rogue, just weeks away from his discharge. He does not plan to return to civilian life without a nest egg. But events overtake him and his small group of like minded soldiers who spend considerable time arguing over whether Lexus makes a convertible coupe. This is not a standard war movie, though there are scenes where guns are fired in anger and people die. That said, it's not a heavy film and you will be very satisfied with the ending. I bought it because it's the kind of film one can see more than once and still enjoy. Also, the price is right.",1438732800,2,1182,4.451612903225806

I had seen this film several times prior to purchasing it. I was pretty young during Desert Storm, and it was too new to be taught in school, so a lot of aspects were new to me with this. I can not attest to any of these plot facts being true, but I am sure that some aspects of it are based on real scenarios and settings that soldiers would have faced. The precedence of stealing the Kuwaiti bullion and it being a fact, is also unknown to me. What I do know for sure, is this is a great, great film. The roles that each of these gentlemen play, is done remarkably well. I am a big time George Clooney fan, and this was an ultimate must purchase for me. Seeing him in such a commanding role and taking charge is certainly nice. The plot of the movie leaves you on the edge of you seat, heart-warmed, saddened, questioning, and blown away, all at once.

-The whole premise that a group of soldiers could just run off without being missed almost immediately is ridiculous.  A unit deployed in the field is constantly doing accountability checks for personnel and for valuable equipment.

-One of the characters gets brutally tortured in the film by the Iraqi officer in question.  He gets electro-shock and forced to drink motor oil.  Yet he's no worse for wear by the end of the movie.

-Clooney's character (a field grade officer) strolls around the camp at the beginning of the film with a three day growth of beard on his face.  Speaking as someone who ""fondly"" remembers having to shave with camouflage paint on his face while out in the field, I found that laughable.

-The idea that Clooney's character could do what he did in the movie (which directly resulted in the unnecessary death of one of the junior soldiers he (mis)led into their ""adventure"" and not get punished for it.

But what made the movie offensive to me is that it simultaneously slammed the US for going into Iraq (depicting a US bomb killing an Iraqi officer's baby) and it also slammed the US for not doing enough (blaming the massacres of Iraqi Shi'a and Kurds on the US).  I suppose that the filmmakers' implied argument was that the US shouldn't have done anything at all in face of Saddam's flagrant act of aggression against Kuwait but I suppose if we had done nothing, they would have made a film about the suffering of the Kuwaiti people and how the US was cowardly doing nothing about that.  Or if we had decided to just maintain a blockade on the country, the US would have gotten slammed for the impact on the Iraqi population (conveniently avoiding blaming Saddam and company for that).

Bottom line:  if you like watching movies that make laughable errors in terms of realism and are made by people who are consistent only in their opposition to the United States, ""Three Kings"" is a great film.  If not, skip it and just watch ""Kelly's Heroes"" which this film rips off and is far better (and which doesn't sermonize an intellectually dishonest message to you).

This is a film about four soldiers who choose to save the lives of refugees over money and military orders.  It shows the desert storm conflict from all sides: the military, the enemy, and the innocents caught in the crossfire.

1264008,5,B00003CX73,"After the end of the Gulf War, four American soldiers (George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube and Spike Jonze) stumble across a map (in the rear of an Iraqi prisoner, no less) that gives the location of a cache of Kuwaiti gold bullion that had been stolen by Saddam Hussain. Wanting to better their positions in life and wanting to see some of the ""action"" that they missed out on, the soldiers set out to retrieve the bullion for themselves, but in the process come to see the true horrors of war.

""Three Kings"" is David O. Russell's third feature, and in my opinion, far and away his best film to date. Don't get me wrong, I really like Russell's film, in particular his first film, ""Spanking the Monkey"", which I think is brilliant, but after making two dysfunctional family films (the other one being ""Flirting with Disaster""), to then switch to the completely different genre of war movies, AND in the process, to make one of the best war movies of all time, is nothing short of incredible. ""Three Kings"" is a war comedy with something to say. At times it becomes a bit preachy. In particular, in the scene where Wahlberg is captured and is talking about the war with his interrogator, I felt as though Russell was giving me a lecture on why war is bad. Nevertheless, the fact that Russell can manage to take his message and place it in the middle of a thoroughly quotable, darkly comic action movie that is extremely entertaining, never ceases to impress me. Like most people, when I see a movie, my aim is to be entertained, but if the film also makes me think, then that's a bonus and this film really makes you think.

I recently heard somewhere that, while this movie was being filmed, George Clooney got into a fight with David O. Russell and ended up punching him. If that's true, then I'm even more impressed with Clooney than I previously was, because he is professional enough to turn in a great acting performance in spite of these feelings. All of the leads in this film are great, from Clooney as the self-serving special forces officer, to Nora Dunn as the aging journalist who spends the film chasing the story of her career.

Overall, I highly recommend this film, and if you've already seen it and love it, then I recommend that you try ""Jarhead"" and ""Buffalo Soldiers"". Together these three movies go together in my mind as the three greatest military/war comedies of all time, and if you like one, you will probably like all three.",1227744000,,2457,4.566893424036281

It was just as I remembered it - engaging and engrossing from the beginning to the end.  Clooney, Wahlberg and the others all turn in solid performances. (After Boogie Nights and the performance here, it was pretty evident Mark Wahlberg was going to be very good.)

The plot, twists and turns keeps you going.  Though it may be broadly similar as ""Kelly's Heroes"" (another great movie, just thinking of Don Rickles or Don Sutherland in that can make me laugh) it is not the same movie, nor does it try to be.  If you have not seen this yet, do not watch it with any other movie or comparison in mind.

Though at times comedic, there is more to this movie than comedy and it would be difficult to try to compare it to another movie.

1264011,2,B00003CX73,"My struggle with THREE KINGS is that I viewed it the first time in the mistaken belief that it was an updated version of KELLY'S HEROES.  Additionally as a veteran of the first Gulf War I found very little in this movie to remind me of those first confusing weeks immediately after the cease fire.

In THREE KINGS we find a group of Desert Storm GIs, led by George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, and Ice Cube, setting off on an unauthorized search for a cache of Iraqi gold.  So far, so good.  During their quest they encounter both passive Iraqi troops, easily pushed aside, and pockets of fanatical Republican Guard soldiers complete with armor.  After hustling off the gold the plot gets unnecessarily confusing with this band of raiders finding themselves in the middle of a civil war between Iraqi civilians and the ruthless guard.

From this point onward the plot tumbles downhill with a member of the group captured and tortured, later rescued, only to become immediately wounded during a firefight.  Clooney and his men push their way east with an ever growing entourage of Iraqi refugees only to find themselves arrested by a contingent of US forces blocking their convoy from Iran.  Fortunately the presence of the press compels the Army to allow the Iraqis to pass into Iran and the renegade soldiers are treated as heroes.

Some have rated this film as the greatest war film of all time.  I disagree.  It is certainly not a modern KELLY'S HEROES and, though sometimes bizarre, does not have the class to be in league with CATCH 22.  More annoying are the hand-held camera shots and bleached out color negative that gave the film a high contrast and blue-tinted magazine look.

I was amazed at the portrayed realism of the 1991 Iraqi countryside, people, and typical US military people and venues. This flick shows graphically what it probably felt like - emotionally, physically, and politically - to men and wonmen on all three sides (pro Saddasm, anti-Saddam, and Allied) of the Allied invasion to free Kuwait from Saddam's forces. The lure of finding golden treasure promoted ongoing primal suspense. The characters and their humanistic relationships were very realistic and individual. The blend and balance of character development, action, drama, and violence was very satisfying thruout the flick. The ending provided an engaging twist, and satisfied my need to know what happened to the key characters.

I found the gory, gritty desert realism of this no-holds flick almost too hard to watch, as I did with ""Blackhawk Down.""

And while it's balls-out style is the best thing about the movie, it's also it's main problem. A little too overdone. As an example, the set-up for the scene of Ice Cube tossing his C4 Nerf football was done so overtly, David O. Russel might as well have told us the scene number.

But in the end, the film's message, never desert your friends, no matter what nationality, however heavy-handedly it may be have been delivered, is still a potent one.

1264083,4,B00003CX73,"It is very difficult to explain what this film is.  Yes, it has some funny moments, but the humor ranges from pretty light to very dark with bitter commentary on most aspects of Desert Storm.  It is a sardonic and sarcastic film.  However, there are also moments of deep emotion (the mother's death with her daughter running to her seeing the mother's blood pouring into the sand) and others of horror and revulsion.

In part it is a heist film, it is also an action film, it is also a war film and an anti-war film (you will be able to project your own views of the war onto this film and say that is what it is about).  It is a film commenting on the media, how technology has changed the way wars are fought. (One of the fabulous scenes is when Troy Barlow is taken captive and is put in a holding room that is full of stolen Kuwaiti cell phones - many with some battery charge and still active contracts - so, in a moment of clear thinking he calls his wife at home to have her call his National Guard base with his location.  This while a battle rages outside and his captors break into the room to take him to heaven knows what.)

It is also a film about refugees and Sadaam's brutal regime (which is quite interesting given the state of our politics now that we have fought a war in Iraq and removed the brutal dictator as the film seems to advocate we should have done ... ) and how the first Bush's call to remove Sadaam put so many people into miserable situations because we did not back them as the President's words implied we would.

Beware, there is profanity nearly every third word, and some pretty rough violence, and one brief scene involving sexual activity.  It is R rated for a reason.

Our four heroes start out on a rather selfish mission to steal gold bars from Saddam Hussein, but end up being an escort service to the prisoners of war.  Tightly directed by David O. Russell, THREE KINGS bristles with some frentic action scenes and some poignant character sketches as well.  Spike Jonez is wonderful as the rather mentally challenged member of the team; George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg are heroic and effective; and even Ice Cube manages to evoke some emotional empathy.

Though it's set in 1991, at the end of the first war with Iraq, ""Three Kings"" says a lot about current American foreign policy, military obligation, the media's coverage of combat, gung-ho-istry and the mid-East's perception of the United States.  Though they don't appear on-screen, Saddam and George (H.W.) Bush haunt this movie, permeating the landscape just as much as the blue, Ecktochrome haze that the camera peers through for most of the movie.

Politics aside, though, ""Three Kings"" functions best as a good old wartime heist flick (ala ""Kelly's Heroes"").  As Operation Desert Storm packs up its tents, a band of military misfits (George Clooney, Ice Cube, Mark Wahlberg and director Spike Jonze) get wind of a stash of stolen gold and go after it.  Chaos ensues but Russell makes a conscious effort not to let the action devolve into guts 'n glory.  There's a dramatic weight to practically every bullet fired in this yarn.

The movie loses a little momentum during the final act but that's intentional (note the sudden change of film stock), a conscious effort to play against dramatics.

This is also a movie filled with crackling scenes: Cube storming a bunker and getting distracted by footage of the then-brand-new Rodney King beating; a gruelling interrogation (complete with haunting dream sequence cut-aways); and a great sequence in which Wahlberg's captured soldier finds a cell phone and calls his wife in Detroit for help.

In addition to the film, there's also an engrossing extra feature on the DVD that shows David O. Russell's bizarre road to a green light for the movie, and a Spike Jonze-directed short on Ice Cube's method acting which never fails to crack me up.",1096761600,6,1916,5.057142857142857

It is March 1991. The Gulf War has ended. And Archie Gates (George Clooney), Troy Barlow( Mark Wahlberg), Chief Elgin(Ice Cube), and Conrad Vig(Spike Jonze) are four soldiers who have served and are now ready to go home. So when President Bush makes all the armies and troops who served stay in Iraq to help innocent Iraqi citizens who have been executed by Saddam Hussein and are worthless by Hussein's power, Gates, Barlow, Elgin, and Vig decide to steal a secret stash of Kuwaiti gold. And once Gates, Barlow, Elgin, and Vig find themselves having to stick to Bush's plan, you'll be on the edge of your seat until the movie ends.

""Three Kings"" was directed by David O. Russell( ""Flirting With Disaster"") and Russell has proved himself to be a good director. Clooney, Wahlberg, and Ice Cube were very good, and Jonze was a bit annoying at times, but he was very good also.

 George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube, and Spike Jonze, are weekend warriors who aren't happy about being in the desert risking their life for no money. Hearing about some Kuwaiti bullion (No, not the little cubes you make soup out of)located at a remote Iraqi outpost, they decide it's time to desert their posts to hit the jack pot. Once they have the gold, they must make a choice between their greed and humanity: or can they join these seemingly irreconcilable motives?

 Fast-paced with shifting images and camera angles, the movie gives one the sense of the values of the high-tech 90s and war in general. Exploring materialism and greed from top to bottom, David O.

1264218,4,B00003CX73,"Three Kings, writer-director David O. Russell's darkly humorous and offbeat heist movie, does to Operation Desert Storm what Kelly's Heroes did to World War II.
Starring George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube, and Spike Jonze, this 1999 film tells the story of four GIs who, at the end of the first Gulf War in 1991, cross the Kuwaiti border into Iraq in search of a stash of gold stolen from Kuwait City by the retreating Iraqi Army.  On their way to Karbala, where the gold is stored in a hidden bunker, the motley group of Americans stumbles upon the Shi'ite revolt against Saddam...and what began as a treasure hunt becomes a rather sobering experience as the GIs watch Saddam's forces crush the short lived revolt.
Russell's film mixes dark humor, witty dialog, and social commentary with some extreme photographic tricks, making Three Kings one of the weirdest -- yet effective -- films to come out of Hollywood in recent years.  The performances from the leads and such supporting actors as Nora Dunn (who plays a veteran cable news reporter), Jamie Kennedy and Mykelti Williamson are top-notch, and Russell keeps things going at a rapid pace.

Stars include George Clooney, Ice Cube, Mark Whalberg, Spike Jonze, Mykelti Williamson, Nora Dunn, Jamie Kennedy, and most notably is Cliff Curtis.  Cliff Curtis is one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood today.  The man is a chameleon.  With looks that enable him to play roles for Latinos, Caucasian, or in this case Middle Eastern.  The man is magnificent.  The single most remarkable thing about this movie is that it was made at he peak on Clinton's administration with no way to imagine how history would repeat itself once Dubya took power.
If one were to watch this movie and only take away from it the political ideas it communicates they will see the immense value in this film.  There are many items in this movie that were suppressed from the American public and the media at the time of the first Gulf War that this movie sheds light on making our actions over their reprehensible.
Perhaps what makes this movie so enjoyable is the combination of several different aspects of genres.

1264222,4,B00003CX73,"At the first instance, what are striking about this movie, is its cinematography, its camera-work, and the computer graphics used, to create certain scenes. Considering these elements, the movie almost certainly `appears' superficially like a Chemical Brothers video. From the beginning to the end, the movie is chaotic. Now, the movie is most certainly a two-hour Chemical Brothers video. As a matter of fact the movie is full of contemporary music-artists: Ice Cube, Marky Mark, and a prominent music-video director, Spike Jonze. Moreover, Spike has infact directed a couple of Chemical Brothers videos. So, there is a definite connection between Chemical Brothers and Three Kings.
Actually, the slick and sleek look of the movie makes it very interesting to watch and to be studied. But, there is a lot more to this flick, than merely its skin-deep look. There is much beyond to this flick than its masterfully created outward faade. Three kings is a brilliant satire. Mainly during its first half, the movie shows American soldiers act like Hollywood heroes, frivolously doing things as they please, at the expense of the hapless people, who they actually are supposed to protect. In point of fact, this very first half is funny as well as grossly heartless. One can either laugh one's heart out during the first half, or at the same time one can feel really sick in the gut, for some of the really gruesome scenes, treated humorously and with aberrant detachment. But, herein lies the sarcasm of the flick.
The second half of the movie is more hearted and thought-provoking than its first half. If `satire' is the word for the first half, then `irony' is the word for the second half. In the second half, the four protagonists set out to selfishly search for gold, actually end up doing just the opposite of what they intended to do, leading to the very warm-hearted end.
This movie is definitely not the quintessential war movie. It stresses on frivolity of the human nature, with war just as a backdrop.

Some reviewers have stated that this movie ""shows why liberals ... .""

Three Kings is a rip-roaring tale that follows the misadventures of four American soldiers at the end of Desert Storm, as played by George Clooney, Ice Cube, Mark Wahlberg and Spike Jonze. All are good, but the first two were revelations to me. I had never before seen Clooney in a movie, and doubted he could fill the screen. He put my doubts to rest. The guy's a movie star in the best, old-fashioned, big studio sense. He can act, and he exudes star power. Similarly, I had seen Ice Cube do capable work playing one sort of character in contemporary blaxploitation/""urban"" pix (Boyz' in the Hood, New Jack City, etc.), but didn't know if he had any range. He does. His endearing, Bible-spouting character was a great challenge he made the most of. The man may now quit his day job.
In exploiting the desert milieu, Three Kings' director David O. Russell successfully mixes bawdy humor, surprises, and tense drama as befitting the movie's theme. The pic's only short-coming is its ending, which I found a bit pat.",1054684800,,1339,4.677966101694915

Meanwhile, Saddam's Republican Guard has more important things to do, like suppressing the uprising of their own people.  Clooney and company step in when an innocent mother is executed by the Iraqi military, and our American heroes spend the rest of the film trying to save the villagers (against U.S. policy) and the gold, until a point is reached where it is either one or the other.

1264294,5,B00003CX73,"'Three Kings' is a fabulous take on the Gulf War, and the brllliance of it is that it *starts* at the conclusion of the war, and takes the position that - while the US fomented uprising and revolution in the northern and southern parts of Iraq - we failed to follow up with any meaningful assistance.  The upshot?  Our half-baked execution left thousands at the hands of Saddam's brutal retribution.
Now, as we prepare for Gulf War II, David O. Russell's insight strikes at the heart of what everyone needs to be asking:  what happens *after* Saddam?  Is the commitment to follow through there?  What are the odds of establishing a democratic state after 20+ years of brutal Baathist suppression?  Russell's film shows you just how complex these issues can be when you're on the ground in the heat of engagement.
Another kick is seeing a movie that hews closely to the plotlines of one of my all-time favorites, ""Kelly's Heroes.""  George Clooney, you're no Clint Eastwood.  But who is?",1046995200,3,985,4.752941176470588
1264295,5,B00003CX73,This movie will always be one of my favorites.  This is where George Clooney really comes into his own in acting.  I saw this in the theaters and thought how could George and Ice Cube make a movie work?  Such an odd pairing really made this movie stand out though.  A great mix of seriousness and a little bit of comedy mixed in.  Spike Jonez was also a great actor in the moive.  The movie really gives the view of actually what it was like in the gulf war.

Exceptional performances from the four leads here (Spike Jonze included) and a tour de force from Saturday Night Live alum Nora Dunn as the brash American reporter.  While this is an action film that never lets up, it also shows us how our government picks and chooses its battles as well as its motivations and timing for putting them into effect.  George Bush Sr. waged a war with selectivity and lack of concern for innocent civilians; this is the ideal movie to watch as we now contemplate war with Iraq yet again with Bush Jr. at the helm.  Also, the juxtaposition of the traditional Middle Eastern world with American goods and culture speaks for itself.

1264298,5,B00003CX73,"I wasn't sure what to expect from Three Kings. Billed as a comedy it was somewhat wrong. Not that there isn't humor in Three Kings, at times it's very funny in a black humor kind of way. Where it shines is it's multilayered view of the 1991 Gulf War.
The opening shot sums up the film. The war is over, an Iraqi stands on top of a bunker, he waives. The major issue is whether soldiers are still shooting with no one knowing.
At once it lets viewers know this war was not like others, nothing is particularly clear - not unlike battles during a war - but typical of the convoluted policies behind the Gulf War.
Politics are part of this film, still there are many interesting aspects to it. The acting is excellent and characters well defined. The air of confusion pervades the plot and view of the film's principle characters.
There is the cynical veteran and young men who saw no action but think it is glamorous. There are the Iraqi people who's plight becomes more and more a part of the film as the soldiers change from, for lack of a better word, looters to men of concience.
All the while there is a mix of adventure, humor and a touch of surrealism. Camera shots are gritty in the mostly outdoor film but are mixed with point of view and point of bullet's view which make for a visually unique film.
By film's end the main characters go from likeable rogues to noble heros. There's a lot of great themes within the film and some memorable dialog.

The extra material on the DVD delve deeper into the main themes of the film which enhances the experience. One of the best films of 1999.",1041206400,,1593,4.363636363636363
1264299,3,B00003CX73,"One of the few mainstream films to be set in the Gulf War, Three Kings, is an interesting, entertaining, critically acclaimed, but totally improbable military adventure.  In 1991, during the clean up operations after the end of the war, reservist soldiers Barlow (Mark Wahlberg) and Vig (Spike Jonze), discover a map ...of a captured Iraqi prisoner.  The two soldiers, along with Chief Elgin (Ice Cube) are reviewing the contents of the map when they are interrupted by Major Archie Gates (George Clooney).  Gates, from Special Forces, shows the group that the prize to be had is actually stolen Kuwaiti gold bullion, hidden in a nearby village.  Soon the group is on their way to claim the treasure from Saddam's Army, anticipating a ""milk run"", expecting to complete their mission in a morning's time.
Arriving at the village, the group is greeted enthusiastically by the villagers.  Iraqi soldiers are in control, and have as prisoners Bush inspired rebels, but no gold is to be found.  Believing that they have made a mistake, the Americans leave.  Realizing their mistake, they return to discover the gold in a hidden bunker, claiming it in the name of the USA.  With the help of the occupying Iraqi soldiers, the bullion bars, housed in hand luggage, are loaded into an Iraqi truck.  The group is about to leave the village, when an innocent civilian is brutally murdered.  This incident starts a chain reaction of violence that changes the whole dynamic of their for profit only mission.
It is also from this point, that much of the story's credibility falls away, and logic no longer seems to matter.  The Americans, leave the village, taking as many of the Iraqi prisoners as they can.  As they speed away, they are gassed by mortar fire, causing their vehicles to crash, and spilling the gold out on to the desert.  Can perhaps six mortar rounds, really cause a large section of the desert to become so clouded with gas, that visibility is reduced to near zero?  Then fortuitously, members of the rebel forces appear at exactly the right spot, to rescue their friends and the Americans, and recover the gold as well.  They all then disappear into a hidden underground cave located in the middle of the desert.  How lucky can you get?
Meanwhile, after launching the gas attack, Saddam's finest head out into the desert and succeed in capturing Sgt. Barlow.  Yet somehow they don't pursue anyone else, and have absolutely no interest in recovering any of the stolen bullion.  Barlow is immediately transported to a holding facility for interrogation.  Information is apparently more valuable than gold.  From this point, Three Kings continues along an improbable path to a questionable conclusion.  The US Army is apparently unable to locate the renegade group, which is operating within driving distance of their base camp.
If you ignore the elements which don't make too much sense, and just concentrate on the film's technical and action aspects, there is much that is impressive and entertaining.  George Clooney is always a competent lead actor, and the supporting cast is solid.  Cliff Curtis a Maori from New Zealand, is excellent as the Iraqi rebel leader.  The film covers events that few others have been willing to deal with, and has much to say about the nature of war, and the Gulf War in particular.  However, the logical inconsistencies, and rather weak ending do distract from the film's total impact.  Three Kings is good film well worth seeing, but falls well short of being a great one.  The DVD is loaded with many extras including several commentaries, and a making of featurette.",1039305600,,3609,4.912541254125412
1264359,3,B00003CX73,"I would give the story line a four star rating, but I have a difference of opinion with the director's choice of color production in certain scenes in this movie. He claims he wants to set a mood with the off color and tint in some scenes. I've always felt that the dialogue and the accompanying music should set the scene, and not the color tint, particularly when the tint casts unsightly hues on a character's face. It's one thing to shoot a scene where there is, let's say, a sole blue bulb in the room, but it's totally another thing to change the natural lighting of a scene in order to create a certain mood - it doesn't happen that way in real life.  I'm not saying you can never use it, but it is akin to using ""and"" & ""but"" to start a sentence - it can be done, but should be done very sparingly. In fact, this director can take a page from the movies that feature predominantly black stars. They consistantly shoot in full spectrum light which gives the scenes a very natural look, and make it a pleasure to watch. These movies are great to revisit for the sheer beauty on how they were shot. Whether the scene is shot indoors or outdoors, whether the scene is shot in the daytime or at night, the end results are good. They rarely cut off peoples heads due to photographical choices. Come on guys, that intimate close up shot can only go but so far - a close up on someone's smile, or of someone's eyes is very undesirable when viewed on a 90' x 40' movie theater screen, and still looks just as bad on home theater systems in the 50"" to 200"" range. The makers of Three Kings should get some pointers on how to make a film look good and natural by contacting Miramax. In their film Shakespeare In Love, they turn out a film that had so many of the aspects of photography correct. Whether the scene was brightly or dimly lighted, the colors were well saturated, had good shadow detail, had great texture detail, great contrast and framed well. I have revisited this movie many times just for the sheer joy of watching good photography on film. On the other hand, I'm not going to revisit the Three Kings until I make a personal dub of it, and record all questionable scenes in black and white with my DVD burner, or maybe I'll just watch it in black and white.",1039305600,,2271,4.30607476635514

1264361,4,B00003CX73,"While still resembling the disposable summer entertainment it pretends to be, ""Three Kings"" is actually a savage indictment of American foreign policy and the sorry implications of Western ignorance when it comes to the Middle East.  Most young men don't want to think about all that challenging stuff, so perhaps pitching this as an action-comedy about American boys kicking sandy butt was the only way to get the audience which most needs to see it into the theatres.  The result is a film with just enough action to be enjoyed as a purely visceral war story, but which more politically aware viewers can admire for its bracing and balanced take on modern imperialism and the politics of oil - although everyone may feel let down by an anachronistic Hollywood ending which reeks of studio interference or post-preview jitters.  But the real tragedy is that in the current political environment which Bush has strategically dumbed down into the dishonest polarity of ""Good vs. Evil"", this is precisely the kind of forthright, sophisticated film we should be seeing more of - and precisely the kind of film which now has little chance of ever being made again.

1264362,4,B00003CX73,"Ok, I have to admit, I have resisted seeing this film because of one name, Mark Wahlberg.  Its this thing I have, the psychologists haven't been able to put a name to it, but I have a fear of viewing films with certain ""actors"", Wahlberg being one of said ""actors"".  It's probably why I haven't seen The Matrix yet, the same symptoms seem to appear anytime I see Keanu Reeves.  But my friend Jack tempted me and I did partake.
Writer-Director David O. Russell, deliverers a film that takes a unique perspective at modern warfare, examining the beauty and pain of the human character.  I'll have to tell you, it made me reexamine my view of war.  Four soldiers go AWOL in search of gold bullion (not the small cubes used to make soup) that Saddam Hussein's army has stolen from Kuwait.  Finding and retrieving the gold was easy, but getting out of the country with the gold and their lives becomes the crux of the story as the soldiers struggle with the worth of the gold versus the worth of protecting the Iraqi civilians they have befriended.  This for me made the film; I have seemed to have lost hope with humanity as of late.  I think it is the drive I make to work everyday.  I see these cars with images of the American Flag or Calvin pissing on Bin Laden clinging to the rear windows, it's suppose to say I'm a good citizen or something like that, but they drive like terrorists, putting lives at risk, they obviously don't care about their fellow man. Anyway, Three Kings forces those involved to make a choice between doing the right thing for humanity and doing the right thing for themselves.
If you saw Traffic, this movie has a similar feel, kind of grainy, makes you feel as if you really are in the heat of the desert.  Oh, we can't leave out the bullet cam; this could very easily have been a scene from Fight Club.  We have seen this before, helmet cam, ball cam, goal cam, but this is bullet cam, we actually see the bullet tearing through flesh and organs from the bullets point of view, odd really.
I also really enjoyed the small role played by Jamie Kennedy; this guy is really funny and extremely talented.  If you haven't seen his show, The Jamie Kennedy Experiment, I highly recommend it, check it out on the WB, I know the WB, but this show really has substance.

1264364,5,B00003CX73,"Writer-Director David O. Russell places Clooney, Wahlberg, Jonze and Ice Cube in the desert to fight in the squirmish in the gulf.

Upon finding a treasure map in an Iraqi soldiers most sensitive hiding place our heros set out to find millions of dollars of Kuwaiti gold.  The neccessity for a plot like this highlights what a different kind of war the Gulf War was, the only way to show some action and interaction with the locals is a fictional treasure hunt.
This is not an action flick as it was sold in it's theatrical release but, it does move along nicely and Russell takes much care in not glorifying the guns and violence.
The great part about this release is the excellent use of the DVD technology.  It's packed with extras beyond the usual cast listings and commentary (although these are also there).

1264365,4,B00003CX73,"First, I don't necessarily agree with the politics of this movie (it was, after all, given a screening at the Clinton Whitehouse).  I'm not certain that the movie presents as ""fair and balanced"" a view of the U.S. involvement in the Persian Gulf War with Iraq as the producer claims he was trying to present (the notion that the U.S. was there to liberate Kuwait from Iraqi annexation is only cursorily glanced over), but aside from its view that the administration of George Bush (the Elder) did not sufficiently support the Iraqi people in their bid to overthrow Saddam Hussein (a belief that has merit even among conservatives), this movie also succeeds brilliantly in becoming much more than a 1990's update of ""Kelly's Heroes"", which is the only impression I ever had of it from the theatre trailers.
>
This movie takes a different angle than typical war films in that it doesn't try to show U.S. soldiers as the elite special forces troops as depicted in ""Black Hawk Down""; indeed, this may very well be the first war movie shot from the Reservists' point-of-view...our heroes aren't men who are dedicated to a life defending their country; they are family men with (menial) jobs who spend a weekend a month in the military for extra cash to help them get by (except for George Clooney, a career Special Forces/Delta Force officer who has lost his motivation for the life he's chosen after his involvement in a war that to this day leaves more questions unanswered than resolved).

The photography is inventive and interesting, the acting is first-rate (especially Spike Jonze and Mark Wahlberg...Ice Cube doesn't disappoint, and George Clooney is just plain cool...I personally enjoy the Arabic actors the best)...and there are enough special features to the DVD to have an interested viewer watching for hours.

Everyone in this movie is allowed three dimensions, not just the Americans, not just the refugees, but even Sadam's soldiers.  This is not a war movie as much as it is an unpredictable adventure tale.  I found myself smiling frequently and then becoming serious a minute later.  Somehow the tone can shift and fluctuate like the wind and yet possess the same, consistent demeanor throughout.  I don't know how they did that.  Mark Wahlberg's character was pretty damn enjoyable, Clooney can really do that thing where he smiles with only his eyes, and who better to throw a C-4 laced football then Ice Cube?  Great cast, witty dialogue, and surprising emotions.  I really like this movie.  Just don't expect a simplistic action plot with over used special effects.

1264367,5,B00003CX73,"David. O. Russell, the director of Three Kings, is arguably the most courageous person in all of Hollywood. He created a film that tells the truth about the Gulf War with gut wrenching imagery, symbolism and, yes, even humor.
After three weeks in wide release I finally got around to viewing this picture. I had been hesitant to go because I thought it might be just another gung ho, rah rah war movie that glorified US foreign policy. Was I ever wrong.
Three Kings, starring George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg and Ice Cube, tells the story of a small group of soldiers at the end of the Gulf War during the ""cease fire"" who head out on their own, unbeknownst to their superior officers, to find millions of dollars worth of gold that Saddam Hussein stole from Kuwait. At first all goes as planned, they find the gold and are ready to head back to base with the stolen loot. But then the reality in their midst sets in.
The cease fire agreed to by US President George Bush has created a horrible situation for the Iraqis who want to oust Saddam from power. US soldiers are no longer ""legally"" allowed to fire upon Iraqi soldiers even though many are being ordered by Saddam Hussein to terrorize and murder any and all resistance groups, including women, children and the elderly. The men are faced with the dilemma: Take the gold with them or do what's morally right and help the people who the US government has abandoned to Saddam's military.
Part of this film's astonishing quality is that it combines humor with its biting political commentary. Simply put, David O. Russell knows how to use a soundtrack, frequently in jarring contrast with the action that's taking place on the screen. In one scene the small group of US soldiers careens into Karbala with the Beach Boys song ""I Get Around"" blaring on the tape deck and a Bart Simpson doll as an ornament on the hood, all while Iraqi troops are killing the local civilians who are rebelling against Saddam. In another scene the soldiers are listening to Chicago's soft hit ""If You Leave Me Now"" as they head into battle with Republican Guard troops. I don't think I'll ever be able to hear that song again without thinking of this movie.
I don't want to give any more details because you simply must see this movie for yourself. But I must warn viewers: This film does have graphic violence and at least two scenes that depict what a bullet does to a person's internal organs. However, that's reality -- it's war as it really is. I cannot stress that point enough. While the overall plot is fictitious, the background story surrounding Three Kings is all accurate. For example, the area surrounding Karbala, the town depicted in the film where the gold is hidden, is the very place where Saddam's army slaughtered an estimated 10,000+ Iraqis who did as George Bush asked and ""rose up against Saddam."" And the reality is, the US government left those people to hang in the wind to suffer under Saddam's military.
Karbala is not the only truthful element of this film. David O. Russell also shows how big media colluded with the US government in only reporting a filtered view of what was taking place. And he also shows how the US government supported Saddam's military prior to the Gulf War when it was at war with Iran. The scene where an Iraqi soldier explains to the US soldier he's torturing that he learned his ""expertise"" from the US military is a damning commentary on US foreign policy.
Russell commented in one interview, ""I'm presenting fact. George Bush has said himself that he has regrets about the way the war was ended.""
I have not been this emotional about a film since Casualties of War, the true story of how a Vietnamese village girl was abducted, raped and murdered by US soldiers and how one man struggled to bring the perpetrators to justice. When I viewed both of these films I had to fight to keep from weeping. What both these films share is that, while they might have certain cinematic ""flaws,"" both depicted real events that occurred while the US was at war. Remember that when viewing Three Kings.
What you see on the screen -- the shooting of an unarmed mother pleading for her husband's life, the slaughter of civilians, the US government censorship of the media -- is pretty much what really happened. While Americans were parading through the streets because we ""won"" the war, the Iraqi people who did stand up to Saddam -- under the encouragement of President George Bush who indicated that the US government would support an uprising -- were all slaughtered. Those same people did indeed wonder, ""Where is the US military? Why aren't they helping us?""
If you can stomach the imagery, you should see this film. I urge everyone who is unaware of what has happened to the Iraqi people to see it.
Michael Moore, of Roger & Me, TV Nation and Awful Truth fame, stated that Three Kings is ""the best movie of the year."" I'm willing to go a step further. It's also one of the bravest movies ever created and ranks up there All Quiet on the Western Front, Born on the 4th of July, Paths of Glory and other such films which tell us what we already know but refuse to acknowledge.",1021766400,18,5153,4.596091205211726
1264368,5,B00003CX73,"I'll admit the first time I saw this movie in the cinema; I didn't like it that much. Then again, I wasn't sure what to expect. I wasn't sure whether it would be a comedy, a drama, or an action film etc. So when the movie was finished and I was walking out of the cinema, I wasn't too sure what to make of it.
I didn't watch the movie for another few years until my friend got it on DVD and having nothing else to do, I decided to watch it again, hoping I would have a different point of view after watching it for a second time. And boy, am I glad I did!
Three Kings is a great movie with; I believe, a deeper meaning. The basic plot is about 4 soldiers in the Gulf War who discover a map on a prisoner after the war is over. It turns out that the map shows the location of $23 million worth of Kuwaiti bullion stolen by the Iraqis. So these 4 soldiers set about getting themselves a nice little bonus. However, upon retrieving the gold, Sgt. Archie Gates (Clooney) and his men are faced with a dilemma: take the gold and allow innocent Iraqi people to be slaughtered by the Iraqi soldiers OR take the gold, try & save the Iraqi people. Obviously the second option comes along with a lot more risk. Gates' moral conscience takes over and he decides upon the latter, citing that ""necessity had just changed"" and so on goes the movie.
I think David Russell did a fantastic job directing the movie, and getting his message across, which I believe was that President George Bush (Sr.) left the Iraqi people to die.
When America won the Gulf war, President Bush told the people to rise against Saddam and that they would have the full support of the United States of America. Whereas in reality, Bush didn't give a rats a@! and innocent civilians were getting slaughtered while Bush felt he had done his part and `won the war'.
Overall, I believe Three Kings would be an excellent addition to anyone's DVD collection. Clooney, Ice Cube & Mark Wahlberg are all superb in their roles and it makes for a highly entertaining film.",1019952000,33,2022,4.323684210526316
1264428,5,B00003CX73,"THREE KINGS, story about a gold heist in March 1991 after the cease-fire agreement had been signed by Saddam after the Gulf War has a surprisingly renewed relevance in this post-9/11 world.
In Three Kings, a group of five US soldiers and a photojournalist crew get wind of some stolen Kuwaiti gold bulion in a bunker near the village of Kabala, through a map found in the rectum of an Iraqi POW.  The devise a plan to go find this gold.  Their paln is somewhat confusing.  Should they keep it, should they give it back to Kuwait, or should they give it to the Iraqi rebels?  While on their mission, tensions rise as the Iraqi Republican Guard start harassing the Iraqi rebels at the bunker.  They first get the help of the few Iraqi soldiers that are there to load the gold onto a truck.  However, some hardcore Republican Guardsmen arrive in a T-72 battle tank and thing change.  They then realize that they must help the rebels escape.  While driving out of the village, they are mortared by tear gas rounds and they accidentally hit some land mines.  They are then picked up by rebels that not only get them into shelter, but also picking up the bags of gold.  However one soldier gets captured by the Iraqis and taken to a old fortress.
It is during this time that the dialogue starts hitting home to what is happening today as talk is being made of finally deposing Saddam for good.  This part of the movie makes note of how the Iraqi rebels were encouraged to rise up against Saddam, but didn't get any support from President Bush.  (Kinda eirie you know.)  It comes down to that our ""Three Kings"" are there to steal gold while they let the rebels fend for themselves.  Once our Three Kings begin to see the potential threat against the rebels, is when they decide to help them cross the border into Iran.  They also decide that they will share the gold with the rebels.  It is after this sequence when you realize that this President Bush needs to finally depose Saddam.  Especially since the extras were special.  See the 2nd paragraph below.
THREE KINGS was filmed with various stocks of film that give the film a surreal look when there's a state of confusion, but then with standard cinema film when things start to calm down.  So when viewing the movie, don't worry about your DVD player because the film looks different throughout the movie.
An interesting note about the Iraqi rebels portrayed in the movie are *actually* Iraqi refugees.  In fact when designing the village sets, a set of brothers, who had in reality defaced hundreds of Saddam propaganda posters, were asked to deface the set props with grafitti of the same kind.  They gladly ablidged.
As for the sound, I thought this DVD had the best surround sound envelopment I have ever heard.  The actions scenes came alive with bullets flying behind you and explosions with deep bass.  The helicopter strafing scene was especially intense sound-wise.  So I feel the 4 score that Amazon gave is WAY off the mark.  I believe it deserves a 5+.
The extras on the DVD are an awesome mix of things.  You get a walk-through of the village and bunker sets by the designer which is extremely interesting.  You get a home-video documentary of the director from script to movie premier which is awesome, including casting screenings with George Clooney, Mark Walberg, and IceCube.  You also get a 20 minute ""Making of"" documentary.  I was extremely impressed with the Extras on this DVD for such a reasonable price.",1018137600,3,3477,4.626427406199022
1264429,5,B00003CX73,"To this reviewer, Three Kings was the single most neglected movie in this year's Oscar race. The old idea that Academy members have short memories doesn't always work for me. The Matrix, which was released five months prior to Three Kings, got four nominations and four awards. It's true that these were in the less exciting technical areas. Still, I still am upset that Three Kings got zilch. Oh, the humanity!
The Gulf War has just ended. Are we victorious? Yes and no. Kuwait is saved. That country will soon be back in the multibillion dollar oil business, and the sheiks and their cronies will get most of their gold and other goodies back. As a military and an economic force, Iraq will be paralyzed for at least a decade. The bad news, as we all know, is that we didn't get the bad guy. Saddam will continue to rule for at least a decade.
What we at home, as well as most of the guys and gals in the Armed Forces there, didn't know yet was that our call for the Iraqi people to rise up in rebellion against Saddam was answered in many parts of his county. And then we left. Just packed up and went home. Left the rebels to fend for themselves against a government that was very, very angry. I guess NATO generals decided that chaos was a natural byproduct of war.
This is the setting for Three Kings. It could have been a grim movie, but it is not overtly political any more than M.A.S.H was. It doesn't point fingers, and it makes no speeches. It's stance is that the soldiers were just as stunned and confused by the speed and abrupt end to the conflict as the people watching at home were. This was the first modern high-tech war. Conducted primarily through air assaults, it left the majority of the ground troops will little to do. So, this isn't like a Vietnam War flick in which troops are given unbelievable orders from seemingly insane commanders in an unwinnable situation. The Gulf War wasn't about Armageddon. It was about Alice in Wonderland.
Major Archie Gates [George Clooney] has been so disgusted by the way the war has been conducted that he's decided to resign. It's back to civilian life in two weeks time. He is most interested when he hears of a map taken from a prisoner. [I can't tell you from where on the prisoner said map was obtained.] The map gives the location of a bunker which contains $23,000,000 in gold bars stolen from Kuwait. Now that could make a nice retirement nest egg, Archie thinks. Soon, he is sets off with a select group on a most unusual heist. One of his comrades is Troy Barlow [Mark Wahlberg]. His wife just had there first baby back in America, and all he cares about is getting home in one piece. There is Chief Elgin [Ice Cube], an Army reservist from Detroit, who is basically on a four month vacation from his job as an airport baggage handler. Finally, we have Conrad Vigs [Spike Jonze, in an absolutely brilliant performance], a bright but virtually uneducated kid from the sticks. At first they are pursed by no one except vigilant CNN-type reporter, Adriana Cruz [Nora Dunn]. All she's after is a good story.
Remember that much of Iraq's army was still intact. They still guarded Saddam's stuff, like gold bars and luxuary cars hidden undergrounda. Archie and his co-conspritors don't face a risk-free mission. When they get to the bunker, they discover its in a town whose residents are some of the rebels mentiond earlier. The group decides that it's not their problem. Then something awful happens, and the situation turns ugly - and interesting. Do you get the gold or help the people? Do you do both? Neither? Aside from the problems attached to steeling gold, what do you do if helping these people is in direct violation of NATO orders?
I love George Clooney. He's right up there with Bruce Willis in the Most Underrated Actors Hall of Fame. Despite their having come from rock and roll, both Mark Wahlberg and Ice Cube are well know in the movie business as guys who take their acting very seriously. Nora Dunn, veteran of five years with Saturday Night Live, is a delight. I've already commented on Spike Jonze, but I must mention he did this while in preproduction on Being John Malkovich, which he directed. Writer/director David O. Russell brings the very best of his independent film background with him. He has all sorts of tricks he uses effectively with film, sound and camera angles. You've never seen a shootout like the one he creates here, for example. His use of color and of unusual film stock is extraordinary. Everyone involved has madeThree Kings a royal masterpiece.",1016496000,,4558,4.600737100737101

The movie makes the point early on that the Bush administration didn't go far enough in the Gulf War.  Since I agree with that, I was able to enjoy this movie as the Three Kings join with Iraqi rebels to save one of their own and then get the rebels to a refugee camp in Iran.
The movie is humorous at times and has quality action scenes and excellent direction.  But for me the movie emphasized that all people love freedom.  The Iraqi people just wanted to be free, and the wanted the USA's help.  We didn't help them in 1991, but it's not to late in 2002.

It is a war movie of the type rarely seen.  Not since Bridge on the River Kwai has a film so cleverly recognized the necessity of war and simultaneously shown the frustration and illogic of war's conduct.  No one is saying Sadam isn't a bad guy, but weird things happen when lives are on the line, and as we constantly learn, those the United States teaches to fight today might decide to fight us tomorrow.  A brilliant portrayal of how war is changing and staying the same.

1264436,5,B00003CX73,"What a total surprise. I started to watch this movie expecting a lot of fluff and silly 'Die Hard' kind of chases but instead I got an action packed DVD with some surprisingly good acting and even some political criticism that, altough it bristled my republican heart, it was correct and worked into the movie.
Briefly, the film is based on a group of US soldiers, in Iraq, shortly after the surrender by that nutbag Saddam Hussein. After capturing an Iraqui soldier with a secret map of the location of Iraqi gold that was stolen from Kuwait the team of soldiers decide to take an exctracurricular foray into the desert to libertae some of those gold buliion bars for their personal 'war trophies'.
The band of soldiers find the underground warehouses full of gold in the middle of remote desert villages with no problem, but, what they didn't count on was that these riches were all guarded by well armed Iraqui soldiers. The fabulous  twist here (and an all to true twist) is that htese soldiers really cared more for their own lives and keeping the population under control rather than protect Husseins gold.
Our band of thieving soldiers than faced a dilemma in doing the right thing in freeing villagers who were asked by the pres Bush to rise against Hussein with nothing more than a magic carpet in their hands, or, liberate the gold and sneak it back home ...... ( yes the movie does repeatedly bring the point home that the US enbcouraged Iriquis top revolt and then left them holding the bag)
Another pleasant surprise is the acting if Ice Cube ... fabulous .....",1005091200,2,1574,4.661870503597123
1264437,4,B00003CX73,"Three Kings was a stunningly good film. Also quite a departure from the man who gave us the comedy Flirting with Disaster. Although there are many funny and ironic parts in Three Kings, overall the backdrop of post-war Iraq/Kuwait is not pretty. George Clooney, Ice Cube, and Mark Wahlberg make a great team, with a bumbling, backwards Spike Jonze in tow. A few military guys find a map (interesting where they find it) which illustrates where Saddam Hussein is keeping Kuwaiti stolen property (gold, for example). The men are not quite sure what to do with it, but before they can decide George Clooney (who by far outranks all of them) has heard about the map and wants to make a plan to get the gold for themselves. Things all move along smoothly until they reach the village where a large amount of gold is stored. They steal the gold and are about the leave when the brutality of the Iraqi soldiers is so great that Clooney cannot leave without trying to take the people with him. This sets of a chain of unfortunate events, including some injuries to personnel, Wahlbergs being taken prisoner by the Iraqis, and even death. The film takes a serious look at the aftermath of the war with Iraq on the daily lives of the people. The people were encouraged to rise up against their oppressor but were given absolutely no support once they did. And they paid for that. The film also portrays Iraqis and other Middle Eastern people as regular, intelligent people who have families, run businesses, and have the same sorts of concerns as people everywhere else in the world. Unfortunately people who were made to pay for the fanaticism of their leader. (Which rings true now with someone of the anti-Arab backlash from the September 11th terrorist attacks in the U.S. Now every Arab-American or follower of Islam is condemned for the attacks perpetrated by a small minority).",1002585600,4,1874,4.73394495412844
1264468,5,B00003CX73,"Three Kings: rated R, 1 hour and 50 minutes
 Three Kings is an excellent, uniquely modern, and stylish war movie. Though it starts off slowly, it picks up pace and clearly makes its point. What makes it stand out as a war movie is its ability to entertain the viewer as an upbeat film rather than being utterly depressing. That's not to say that Three Kings doesn't have its moments of shocking realism. However, comical lines scattered throughout the movie, along with trendy actors who display a natural talent for contemporary filmmaking keep the movie in its place. In the end, Three Kings is exceptionally satisfying.
 Four young military men set off on their own personal expedition at the conclusion of the Gulf War to retrieve a bundle of stolen Kuwaiti  riches amassed by Saddam Hussein. The plan was shrewdly devised to appear straightforward and feasible, until the men put it into action. Things then seem to become increasingly complicated. The four run into a slew of obstacles that threaten to hinder their chances of success. Major Archie Gates, played by George Clooney, decrees the ultimate ambition for a human being to be necessity. Later, he admits that necessity often changes its form. In this case, the necessities of the four soldiers evolve from their intention to avoid returning  to their day jobs, into their desire to save as many human lives as possible. The operation begins as a greedy mission to acquire individual wealth, but metamorphoses into a test of valor and heroism. The men's integrity is challenged. They must inevitably contend with what is the right thing to do.
 The quest develops into one of virtue and greater reward than the success of a single man. It underscores the power of individual to make a difference in the world. Sacrifices are made and lives are lost, but for the most part, righteousness prevails. That is the main message of the movie. Humans have the capacity to do good as well as evil.
 The final scene of the movie is particularly engrossing. Without giving too much away, the surviving military men arrive at the completion of their undertaking, only to find that everything they have worked for, and everything they have forfeited for their noble cause has amounted to absolutely nothing. Wounded, and helpless prisoners to those that seek to punish them, in addition to being responsible for the lives of many innocent Iraqi refugees, all hope seems to be lost. It would require an even greater sacrifice to free them from the current predicament. Once again, their decency is questioned. This is perhaps the gloomiest, most miserable scene in the movie.
 George Clooney is suitable in the role as the leader of the group and the initiator of the mission. Spike Jonze is pleasant as the ignorant, unschooled member of the team. Ice Cube is all around excellent, exhibiting a strong sense of maturity in acting that was questionable prior to this movie. Somewhat surprisingly, the finest actor of all in this film was former singer, Mark Wahlberg. Troy Barlow (Mark's character) was a compassionate and highly admirable character that learns from his experiences. Not only does Barlow grow as a person, but also Wahlberg grows as an actor. It was the scenes focusing on Barlow that were most poignant. On the whole, the acting in the movie was as highly respectable, as the movie itself.

That such a plot can be pulled off in today's cinematic environment of the lowest common denominator of entertainment mixed with quasi-ironic cynicism is remarkable.
What makes such a romantic plot successful is that the cynical characters undergo their transformation in the surreal cease fire environment in Iraq at the conclusion of the Persian Gulf War. There is a biting indictment of US policy and motivations inlaid in this plot, and the amoral insanity helps the movie viewer change along with the films main characters.
Cinematically, the film is bizarrely filmed. Its shot in a gritty, documentary kind of film that seems appropriate for some European dystopian flick from the late 70s.

Personally I thought: Why are the US soldiers not helping the Iraqi resistance! You know, you can see some torture scenes using electro shocks and the killing of an Iraqi mother in this movie. I mean this is really tough!  Also, the movie tells me that American soldiers are only interested in their own benefits - in the movie: Gold. I don't believe that either! There is something in every human being, understanding what is wrong or right. I mean sometimes not, but the movie gives you the impression, Americans do not know! I also do not believe this!

I also have to admit I finally saw it because I have recently become interested in seeing the other work of actor Mark Wahlberg because I liked him so well in ""Planet of the Apes""(go see it!). I became interested in seeing some of his other work. He is quite impressive in this film. To my surprise I really liked this film. It is smartly done in that it deals with some pretty serious subject matter but manages to add humor as well in some pretty difficult scenes. This film is excellent in so many different ways. One being that these 3 ""kings"" , George Clooney (Archie), Mark Walberg (Troy) and Ice Cube along with Spike Jonze (Conrad- sort've the comic relief who has great admiration for Troy) set out to basically steal some gold (23 million dollars worth) that they learned about through a map found in a captive's (buttocks). But what happens along the way is something else  and you learn that these guys have heart and care about the people they have to end up rescuing that they really don't want to deal with-they just want the gold but they end up having to go through quite a bit to accomplish this feat-things that they certainly didn't plan on. At first it seems everything they touch ...blows up! It is kind of funny almost. I never really understood this war and why it happened in the first place and you do learn more about it and that it had  to do with the crazy Saddam Hussein. These characters you get to learn alot about who they are(and they learn about themselves) along the way as the movie progresses and you have to see quite alot of things that perhaps you would never want to see or know about (a Iranian woman gets shot through the head in front of her daughter and husband which is the last straw for these soldiers and at this point they seem to decide that this isn't right and they are going to help out these people and still get the gold). Sometimes the lighting is really harsh but it is also true form. The scenery isn't the best to watch as it shouldn't be given the setting. There is some really suberb acting as well. I continue to be impressed with George Clooney with each film he does and Mark Wahlberg also is a standout.....This isn't usually the type of movie I like but it was smart, funny, heart-wrenching and I was so glad I finally saw it. I even watched again. You will not be disappointed and you may feel like you have even learned something. It is a solid film with very solid outstanding performances.

Three Kings shows a cynical point of view of all the actions that took place  during the war .

Iraqi people seem desperate as they watch their last hopes for real freedom from their evil leader vanish away while U.S soldiers are presented simply uninformed of who they are dealing  with and why they are there. The director feels he must ask this question : Why wasn't Sadam killed or at least overthrown ? Wasn't this the perfect opportunity not only to protect the Kuwait people but to finally liberate Iraq from it's vicious leader once and for all ?

George Clooney stars as Archie Gates, Mark Wahlberg is Troy Barlow and Ice Cube is Chief Elgin. Together they are the Three Kings (Spike Jonze is to them like D'Artagnan is to the Three Musketeers). What Starts as a Treasure Hunt in the Iraqi Deserts Ends in the Escorting of Dozens of Refugees to the Border, away from Saddam's Tyranny. What looks like a Simple Plan (Get the Gold... and Get Out) and a Simple Film (a Generic Action/Comedy) grows into So Much More as it progresses. It has a few Things to say about Our Government, Their Government, Ourselves, Individuals and what One Person Can do to help. The film Makes all these Statements, without Ever losing sight of the fact that it's Mainly here to Entertain it's Audience... Which it does, with Flying Colours.
It is Also a Rapid Anti-war film. For the Americans it is all a Big waste of time, and for Everyone Else, it is Life or Death. Whenever the Americans try to help anyone, Red Tape and Bureaucratic Nonsense stands in their way. The Three Kings in question are out there, supposedly doing wrong, but they are the only ones Really Helping the Supposed Cause. It is all so Futile. The film also says all this, while disguising itself as a straight Action film (probably to get the script through all the Pitch Meetings with a Decent Budget and Studio Support... Good Move). The Reason for the 4 star rating instead of a 5 is that the film is Not one that warrants Repeat Viewing. It reaches Maximum Impact Straight away, unlike some other anti-war films (particularly Stanley Kubrick and Oliver Stone films). Since purchasing this DVD I have watched if Far Less than I Expected to. Perhaps that's just me. David O Russell's Directing is as Fresh and Original in a time where Nothing is Fresh and Original. The Pacing is great, the Performances are All Stand Outs and the Photography is Outstanding. Some of the Images will be Burned in your Memory for an Eternity.
If you like Action Movies, you'll love ""Three Kings"". If you like Anti-war films, you'll love ""Three Kings"". If you like your films to have a Point and a Message, you'll love ""Three Kings"". If you think George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg are Hotties, you'll love ""Three Kings"". It has So Many things in it's favour, Far too many to count.

1264511,5,B00003CX73,"A completely original war movie, ""Three Kings"" was one of the best movies of 1999 and possibly of the decade. Though not as commercially successful as it deserved to be, it received widespread critical acclaim for its director, David O. Russell, and excellent cast, including George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube, and Spike Jonze (""Being John Malkovich"").
A tale of greed and compassion set among the dust and desolation of Iraq during the Gulf War, ""Three Kings"" succeeds on many levels because it is unafraid to ask difficult questions about morality and humane actions in the midst of carnage.
Though revolving around war, the film is not without its dark humor. In fact, there are several laugh-out-loud moments in the midst of ominous dread (an exploding cow, a strategically placed map, Nora Dunn's hilarious journalist). Beautifully downplaying the ironic wit and enhancing the suspense, the cast is always believable and a pleasure to watch.

The plot is deceptively simple: steal the gold that Sadam Hussein stole from Kuwait during the invasion of that country. The trhee soldiers in the title{well,4 actually,Spike Jonez does not get full king billing, I guess,though he almost steals the movie}The scenes of the americans hiding in a humvee to steal the gold and being met with starving woman and children,then gunned down by iraqi soldiers is powerful as is the comment from the soldiers:Bush told them to rise up against Saddam and we'd support the,they did,we didn't."" Interestingly for a main stream Hollywood movie, that war and Bush are bashed mercilessly for their betrayal of the Iraqi's and Kurds who risked their lives, then were left to be slaughtered by Husseins troops. The 4 leads are uniformly excellent. Clooney is wonderful as Archie Gates,the Special forces major,Ice Cube is excellent as the chief{also he portrays a pacticing muslim in the movie,and it is done respectfully, another rarity for Hollywood}, Mark Wahlebrg is barlow,almost the conscience of the group and Jonze is conrad, the redneck{well, it is Hollywood after all} Searing in its indictment of the failure of American policy yet still funny enough to keep you watching, this is a very,very good movie.

Their plan, however, falls into complications when they become involved with Iraqui rebels whom Saddam Hussein has targeted for extinction.
THREE KINGS was marketed as a rip-roaring action flick, and it certainly delivers the goods in that department, with several well-staged, John Woo-type explosive set pieces and shoot outs.  But the movie is so much more than the sum of its pyrotechnics.  Foremost it is a satire on American pop culture, with several choice barbs lobbed at famous musicians.  (One demented Iraqui's theory as to why Michael Jackson altered his appearance is particularly funny and quite possibly insightful.)  And the director's ironic use of pop tunes (i.e., Chicago's ""If You Leave Me Now"")during moments of high tension is just masterful.  The cast is very good.  Clooney makes a solid, capable lead.  Walhberg discards his tough guy persona to limn a combination of sweetness and steel, and Ice Cube manages to make his trademark smirks and sneers palatable and appropriately funny.

I avoided watching this movie as long as I could, but a friend of mine finally convinced me to watch it.  Here's what I had been missing out on:
A no holds barred look at the effects of war from all points of view, not just the American's.  I saw the enemies portrayed as real people, not just mindless barbarians; which is rare to see in movies these days.  It turns out the Americans wanted to steal the gold because they needed it, not just because they wanted it.  It tried to add the all-important comic relief, which was successful most of the times, but there were a few goofy scenes.  The comedy is needed in a movie this hard core. I was blown away by the cinematography and the editing, all the action sequences from the fast paced to the slow motion were blended in perfectly.  I have been left with quite a few scenes stuck in my mind.  And I am very happy I was finally talked into seeing it.

The casting was a gem, with Clooney and Wahlberg reinforcing their roles as good leading men, and Ice Cube and Spike Jonze were great in their supporting roles. The Gulf War as we all know was about money, and this movie does an excellent job of portraying that idea, but it was almost too subtle. There was some great imagary and the film aimed at showing the not-so glorious side to war, trying to bring some perspective to a viewing country that is more interested in cable vs. satelite than foreign affairs. The only reason that the movie didn't get a five star rating from me is it's hokie ending. Too happy for a movie that looked to expose some of the realities of war fought not for honor or downtroden people but for economic reasons. The best way this movie could have turned out is if the Three Kings had accomplished their original goal and not turned to Hollywood pressure to make the ending pleasurable.

1264551,2,B00003CX73,"This was one of the strangest plots I've ever seen. There were more infantile plot twists than any good movie needs. So many, in fact, I couldn't help but laugh at the scene transitions. The oddest thing about this movie was that half of the acting was pretty good, but the other half was absolute horrible. Take a wild guess at what part of the country the two dumbest soldiers are from? Their Southern accents might give that away. Yet another ""bash the only non-pc group left"". The overwhelming theme of the movie seemed to be `Killing, war, electrocution, breaking rules, losing your career, and violating peace-time treaties are all justified by the anticipation of lots of GOLD.' Huh??
That aside, Clooney was pretty good and Ice Cube was an excellent match for his role. Mark Wahlberg is the most underrated actor today, mostly because the roles he ends up with (other than ""The Sixth Sense"") are so astonishingly stupid, you question whether he actually has an agent. His character in this has about as much brain power as my left foot, yet try to present him as being one of the more intelligent?....
The worst thing about the movie was the relationship between the American and Iraqi soldiers. They acted like they were opposing sides in the middle of a televised football game and they didn't want to appear too ""mean"" in front of the camera. Rarely did you get the feeling that these two groups were just on opposing sides in a deadly war.
I cringe when I see movies like this that are so lacking in character, plot, and scenery that they have to fill every empty scene with ANYTHING politically correct. They touch it all here too: racism towards blacks and Arabs, sexism, equal opportunities for women, gun control, violence, freedom of speech, ethnic cleansing, the ""War is bad"" theme stolen from ""The Thin Red Line"", etc. They even throw in the Rodney King video for good measure. The only things you'll get from this movie: WHITE Americans are evil, Arabs are wonderful, and Southerners are stupid. Other than that, I question my own Southern stupidity for wasting $3 for this garbage on pay-per-view.",978652800,3,2118,4.758152173913044
1264552,4,B00003CX73,"Three Kings isn't an easy watch.  The director and his cinematographer purposely mesh strange film lighting with strange colour filters.  The film has got a sandy look which isn't pleasant.  The lighting is too harsh for my liking.  Why David Russel opted to film Three Kings like this, I don't know.  But what I do know is that behind the annoying techinical problems lies a serious and important issue.
I love Dr Strangelove.  That movie is an all out laugh a second movie on the absurdity of war.  Three Kings cannot be compared to it simply because it never attempts to compare.  Three Kings doesn't make fun of the war as such.  There is a lot of humour here but it comes more from the characters than the situation.  In fact, there is nothing at all funny about the situation.  The war is over.  The Iraqis want the Americans out of their country.  But they are still holding innocent prisoners.
The performances are top class.  George Clooney chooses his parts well and here, again proves his calibre.  Mark Wahlberg is given the most intense scenes and doesn't disappoint.  Ice Cube defies his ridiculous name to make good a difficult, unflashy part.  Spike Jonze is used for comic effect and is also successful.
Russel direction is outstanding.  The Iraqis are not bad guys in his mind.  His views are very objective and fair.  His use of startling images like the unforgettable bullet-eye view are possibly unnecessary but this man knows how to tell a story.
Three Kings is not always interesting.  In fact, the movie does sag at times.  And is also often too conventional.  I didn't enjoy the reporter sub-plot.  The lighting was also unkind.

Although the cinematography was interesting (washed out desert scenes, what a bullet looks like inside of a body, silhouetted figures in the desert), the story line was confused and the attempt at comedy mixed in with gruesome wounds just didn't work.  It also tried to hard to be preachy about the plight of the rebels who the U.S. first supported and then abandoned.
George Clooney's performance as the womanizing leader was wooden and lacked the subtlety and range that he had exhibited in the TV series ER.

1264609,3,B00003CX73,"""Three Kings"" is one of the most visually impressive and unique films I've seen in recent years. Unfortunately, the characters and the script don't measure up, leaving the film a visual masterpiece but an emotional mystery.
Director David O. Russell's camera veers, sways and swings hypnotically; the landscape is washed out, monochromatic and almost mind-bending (the result of special film stock); we see pictures of human innards being pierced by a bullet as a voice-over describes the dangers of septic infection; a shoot-out is filmed from the point of view of bullets; and on and on.
The story unfolds in the aftermath of the Gulf War; burnout Special Forces Major Archie Gates (a one-note George Clooney) figures out from a reporter that the Iraqis have stashed Kuwaiti gold in a nearby village, and that there is a map showing the location of the village.
The map, as it turns out, has been retrieved from an Iraqi soldier's...ahem...posterior by two grunts: straight arrow Sergeant Troy Barlow (Mark Wahlberg) and redneck Beavis wannabe Conrad Vig (Spike Jonze); later, Chief Elgin (Ice Cube) joins Barlow and Vig. Gates tracks the three down, and they devise a plan to retrieve the gold (though we have no idea how they plan to smuggle it back to the states).
Eventually, the foursome ends up in the Iraqi village where the gold is stashed, but the natives mistakenly think that this is their chance to rise up (as President George Bush had exhorted them to do) to fight Saddam, whose forces occupy the village. Eventually, Gates decides to help the villagers out, and the Americans get caught up in a mini-rebellion.
Frankly, no amount of innovative camera work or visuals can hide the fact that the plot to this movie makes absolutely no sense, and the characters (especially Gates, who inexplicably turns from greedy carpetbagger to heroic liberator) do things that make no sense.
""Three Kings"" has a sly, hip tone that includes numerous allusions to American pop culture (including Eddie Murphy's ""My Girl Wants To Party All The Time"") and consumerism that the Iraqis are too backwards to really relate to (in one scene, an Iraqi soldier fleeing a bunker risks his life to smuggle out American bluejeans). But, perhaps honestly, Russell gives us no real reasons to admire the Americans either; for all their talk (and Bush's talk) about helping liberate Iraq, they're in it for the money.
And that one-dimensional sort of attitude would seem to be consistent with Russell's aims with this film: he is in it to show us some very cool and hypnotic direction, but fills the film with patently uninteresting people.
In the end, ""Three Kings"" is a mixed bag, but it's worth seeing for the excellent visuals alone. The DVD is also excellent, and has some very cool extra features that make it a worthy buy.",973123200,,2814,4.90146750524109

I also respected the way the arab people were portrayed - stuck in the middle between Americans who want to help and their own pro-Sadaam countrymen.  I thought it dragged a little...I started paying bills around the time Mark Wahlberg was getting resuced.  But it is worth a view if you have the time.

However, I was proved wrong on both accounts. The acting was much better than I expected. The message (which, from reading some other people's reviews, many people missed completely) was pertinent, moving, and inspiring. This is also one of the few movies I've seen that comes even close to accurately portraying the situation in Iraq and that atrocities that the US is allowing to happen to innocent Iraqi citizens.

1264641,5,B00003CX73,"Set in Iraq at the conclusion of the Gulf War, Three Kings is a brilliant whirl of a movie, taking you on an emotional roller coaster.  It works on many different levels.  As an action film, a docu-drama, a comedy, and a tragedy.
As the war ends a document is discovered on an Iraqi prisoner (in a place where the sun don't shine!) and it is soon revealed that it shows the location of an Iraqi bunker believed to hold millions of dollars worth of stolen Kuwaiti bullion.  Not letting the brass know about this rather important peice of information, four soldiers begin a quest to find it and enrich themselves.
The movie stars George Clooney as soon-to-be retired Major Archie Gates.  He is very effective in this macho role of a man who begins this adventure motivated by greed, and ends it wanting to help the Iraqi refugees.  There are also very solid performances from Ice Cube (as good an actor as he is a rapper), Mark Wahlberg (a much better actor than a rapper), and Spike Jonz (showing multiple talents in 1999 - he directed another good film, Being John Malkovich).  The best performance may be from Nora Dunn, in a supporting role, as a reporter trying to get the inside track on a good story but running into obstacles provided by the U.S. military, both intentional and unintentional.
There are things in this movie we have not seen before. There is an enemy torturer who has a story to tell moving enough for you to feel sympathy for an otherwise inhuman character.  We dont' just get bleeding bullet wounds, but the effect they have on the human body, FROM THE INSIDE!
The action is intense, ironic, and fresh.  This is not the same old shooting sequences, i.e. I hide behind a steel barrel (where these are all at, I would like to know), you hide behind a wall and bullets richocet.  There are exploding footballs and a confusion on who the enemy actually is.  There is an excellent sequence in a gunfight where everything is in slow motion.  Also, in a terrificly ironic scene Spike Jonz character rides into battle in an Infiniti Convertible, with an Iraqi rebel who does not speak English, while listening to Chicago's ""Baby, Please Don't Go"" on the CD player.  This type of irony is not just used by Russel for humor's sake, however.  It simply helps point out the absurdity that the situation dictated.
Within Three Kings I laughed, I watched with white knuckles, and I felt moved to tears at the end as seemingly everything started to go wrong.  The conclusion reaches just the right note without the ""Final Shootout"" so many action movies fall victim to.  If you can experience those range of emotions, enjoy yourself, see something new, and watch great directing and very good acting, how can it not be 5 stars?",972000000,2,2736,4.612371134020618
1264642,4,B00003CX73,"Set in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf war, ""Three Kings"" is a gritty and surprisingly intelligent fable about war, greed, human nature and the media, and the effect these forces have on one another.
With its door-kicking, guns-blazing plot, the film could stand alone as an action-adventure movie, but it also features dark humor and interesting camera work that lift it above the stereotypical ""war movie"".  The movie can be shockingly graphic, but it uses the bloodshed selectively and to good effect.  As in ""Saving Private Ryan,"" the full absurdity and drama of a world turned upside-down by war couldn't be conveyed without the violence.
Writer-director David Russell manages to take some stock war movie characters - the young man with a new baby at home struggling to do right by his family, the man due to be discharged in two weeks, the flinty officer who dislikes guns - and turn them into something that transcends it all.  Most interestingly, he does it without the tempering hindsight or nostalgia afforded to those exploring earlier wars, like WWII or Vietnam.  Those of us who got most of our information about Operation Desert Storm from the 10 o'clock news will both recognize the TV/MTV style Russell occasionally mimics and see a side of the conflict which wasn't covered heavily in the US.
The lead actors - the pretty boy from ""ER"", two former rappers and the future director of ""Being John Malkovich"" - seem like strange picks at first, but they turn out to be terrific as everyday people forced into extraordinary situations.",971654400,,1551,4.908396946564886

I loved the bleached look of the film, it gave me a sense how it must have felt in desert storm, sand everywhere, isolated, sweltering heat. This is one of the most original films to come out of hollywood in quite some time. The acting and direction are excellent. It is really a shame when films like this get ignored and movies like a""Armageddon"" are huge hits. The DVD is excellent also. In addition to excellent video and audio, the are two commentary tracks,  three behind the scenes featurettes, and tons of hidden features.

Marky Mark, Clooney, and Ice Cube are three Desert Storm soldiers who steal a billion dollars in IRAQ-y gold boullion (goods).  The deal made is that whoever survives the war gets the gold.

1264645,5,B00003CX73,"Three Kings may be the best war film of all time (yes, better than Saving Private Ryan). It's not because it's the most realistic or has the most impressive battle sequences (it has neither) but because it has an excellent plot and doesn't bother getting itself mixed up with that other stuff.  Clooney and Wahlberg team up for the first of consecutive movies together, the other being the summer blockbuster The Perfect Storm, and are both equally as good.  Clooney's a major two weeks from retirement and wants to leave the Gulf with something more than just sand.  He hunts down a trio who've retrieved a map that they believe leads to a bunker filled with Kuwaiti gold.  Along the way they manage to get entangled in the resistance movement and find themselves befriending they're precieved enemies.  It defys all the sterotypes we have of the Arab people, here they're potrayed as real people trying to live and work but find themselves constantly roadblocked by Sadam's iron fist.  After the skirmish Clooney and co. find themselves on the lam and looking for Wahlberg, whose fallen into enemy hands.  In one of the most unforgetable scenes Wahlberg's questioned while being tortured about his country's misplaced values and comes to empathize with his captors.  It's an excellent moment and movie, one that's totally unconvential, funny, dramatic and action-packed.  The picture quality maintains it's integrity on the DVD and along with a slew of extras makes this a great addition to anyone's collection.",971222400,2,1513,5.02
1264646,5,B00003CX73,"Like a Graham Greene for the MTV Generation, David O. Russell in Three Kings sends four naive, greedy American soldiers searching for stolen gold at the end of the Persian Gulf War. They create untold havoc as they blunder into cultural and political situations they can't begin to understand, plunging themselves and countless others into layer after layer of mortal dangers. Those who survive learn that hardest of home truths: ""No man is an island."" This movie is tragic, horrifying, cynical, touching and roll-in-the-aisles hilarious--sometimes simultaneously. Using dazzling techniques of photography and montage, Russell keeps the characters and the audience alike completely unsettled and on guard throughout the film's running time; the approximate effect is like a rollercoaster ride through Purgatory, with the passengers uncertain whether the tracks haven't collapsed somewhere around the final hill. Those with weak stomachs should stay away, but those with adventurous tastes should seek out Three Kings immediately. (Final note: I never gave two hoots about ER or Marky Mark, but judging from this movie and The Perfect Storm, George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg are making strong bids to become the premier male stars of the coming decade.)",970963200,,1252,5.492227979274611
1264647,5,B00003CX73,"Until there is a better film on Desert Shield/Storm, this is it. Like the others this one goes on its own tangent with a private myth and runs with it, I suppose a historically-accurate film would not be interesting enough. The thing the film conveys when you cut through all the 90s-ish hipness is that while we were celebrating, people in Iraq were suffering. To get us to see this, the writer has us go on a Kelly's Heroes type quest for gold. The point here is that America needs to improve its ability after a war at finishing the job and restoring to governmental power legitimate rulers who will not allow civilians to be brutalized. We all know we (our government) were unwilling to oust Saddam Hussein from power and attempt this. At some point we had best get ""willing"" and able to do this.
The next thing to praise the film is how it depicts what happends when a bullet hits the human body, its highly instructive and begs the question why we don't have some sort of area disinfectant that can be sprinkled into a wound like we had sulfa powder in WWII? The awareness of the vulnerability of the HMMWV to land mines is shown in the movie, which is good. Clooney's character the Major seems technically and tactically proficient with the situation he has placed himself in (not enough men, mobility or firepower, certainly no back up).
The ending was actually realistic in that the conventional military frowns upon initiative and would seek to punish those that practice it even if staring in their face was what the moral thing was to do.
All in all, the movie was better than what I expected and should be viewed more in an artistic, detached manner as a sort of statement using metaphors.

1264704,5,B00003CX73,"I am writting primarilly in response to the reviewer who claimed this movie was ""right-wing""... What movie were you watching? Were you  actually watching Three Kings, you would have noticed that all of the  Americans in the film, with the EVENTUAL exception of the lead characters,  are portrayed as uncaring, selfish, and just all around unpleasant people.  Former President Bush is essentially put down several times, and in case  you forgot, Saddam Hussein really is a cruel and violent dictator. If you  want to see real propoganda, try Iraqi television. The only people in the  movie who venerate the US are the rebels, who MISTAKENLY believe the US  will follow up on it's claims of freeing the people, everyone else, even  some of the Americans, point out just how hipocritical and petty the US  really is.
As for the special effects, the interior views of people  who've been shot are quite possibly the most realistic in recent film  history. No, people aren't really made up of nifty CGI graphics, sorry to  burst your bubble.
This is an AMAZING movie, one of the four best of  1999 (along with American Beauty, Fight Club, and Bringing out the Dead).

For example there are only one dozen bullets shot, but you really care about every single bullet. In the overdriven satiric moments, this film reminded me very much of MASH and Apocalypse Now. Also this film makes clear, that the usa didn't fight the gulf war because they care for the people, it was only for oil!

It has  everything - extreme mockery of stupid people, clever satire of the  American mentality, and a little moral about how war is evil.

The movie is  actually a fairly simple plot.  The movie is about 4 soldiers who get a  hold of a map that shows where Saddam hid the gold he stole from Kuwait.  The four of them make plans to illegally take the money from Saddam for  themselves.  The soldiers then are faced with some serious dilemas that  make them decide between right and wrong (can't give too much of the movie  away).
I disagree with Alci Rengifo, who's review put Three Kings into  the same level as Platoon, nor would I rank it as the best movie of 1999,  but it is still a great movie.

Ultimately the soldiers are forced to choose between never  having to work another day ever again - or saving the lives of  innocents.
I enjoyed 'Three Kings' and highly recommend it. However, I  was disturbed by the message of the film. Highlighted were the injustices  commited against civilians by the U.S. Army.

Set in 1991  immediately after the U.S. withdrew from the Gulf War, four soldiers led by  Clooney set out to get rich by recovering $23 million of gold bullion which  Iraq stole from Kuwait. Along the way, the men are torn between helping the  Iraqi rebels who are being slaughtered by Sadaam's troops, or taking the  gold and leaving.  ""Three Kings"" raises some interesting  moral issues about America's real motives for fighting the war, and about  the value we place on the lives of others.

However, it is also a touching story of 3  ordinary men and what they do when put into a situation of getting an  amazing amount of wealth.  It is also interesting because it is one of the  few Gulf War movies to hit the mainstream.

Elmore Leonard books  that are always adapted to films have a certain coolness to them so the  credit in that film was only partial to Clooney (not to mention Jennifer  Lopez...what a kitty cat).

It is an honest and humorous examination of the Gulf War and of the treachery of American policy toward the Iraqi rebels that  America promissed to support. Like ""Saving Private Ryan"" this  film contains gritty battle field realism, but of a totally different sort.  ""Three Kings"" displays the kind of battle field ambiguity that  can result in soldiers being killed unnecessarily. It also demonstrates in  a unique and grisly fashion what a bullet wound does to internal organs.  Most importantly, ""Three Kings"" reminds us that the Iraqis are  people too. The rebels who resist Sadam Hussein only want to open  businesses and lead a peaceful life. The Iraqi soldier who tortures an  American is himself a victim of the Americans since his wife was maimed and  his child killed by American bombs. This does not justify his brutality,  but it puts the audience in the awkward position of understanding its  origins.

And its not just about the war itself, but the change  in modern warfare, the rape of a country, and the seeming indifference to  profiteering by US soldiers after the battle. It's also interesting to see  these Sadam ""hideout bunkers"" that he supposedly used to elude  capture, as well as many of the other familiar footnotes to the Gulf War  that Americans watched on their tvs just a decade ago! The director eschews  the only hinted at subplot of America's lack of aid to the Kuwaitees after  the liberation of their country to keep the film light. And finally there's  that ""golden age of Hollywood"" ending with the villians of the  film eventually doing the right thing at great cost to themselves.

The black soldier of the group freezes for a  moment, probably questioning his own loyalty to a coutry that treats blacks  with disrespect.  Americans sitting comfortably at home, watching this war  and the Kosovo war on CNN were selectively fed the news that would make  them support their government's actions. Similarly, the soldiers in this  movie thought they were doing the right thing leaving the Iraqui people to  deal with Sadam on their own.

1264961,2,B00003CX73,"And maybe that was the problem...
Three Kings seemed like three movies  smushed together...but not in a good way.  It was part treasure hunt, part  anti-war, part left-field absurdist.  The film lacked focus, and because of  that, the script suffered, as do the characters and the pacing of the film.  Loved the cinematography, liked the plot, and that just wasn't  enough.
This movie also stereotypes -a lot-.  It's an equal-opportunity  stereotyping film.  And then, the film highlights one person in a  stereotyped group and tries to make that person look ""real"", thus  debunking the stereotype.  But the stereotype gets made to begin with (all  of the troops-both sides, the villagers, everyone) so it doesn't matter how  many ""individuals"" get shown-the damage gets done.  It was really  annoying-it's as if the film assumes that the viewers hold the same  stereotypes as the characters and have to learn along with them, when in  fact, that device gets a little insulting after a while.
There were some  really weird and out of place things in this movie.  True, visually, they  were stunning, but I couldn't help but think that they were wasting the  technology on an image or two just to show that they could do it.  Certain  moments just didn't belong in the film; they belonged in some other sci-fi  sort of film.
I even went back and watched this movie again; seeing all  the positive reviews of this made me wonder if I'd just missed something.  But my taste must just be different.  The movie didn't do enough to make me  care for the main characters.  Nor did it do enough to make me care for the  pseudo-spirituality they tried to throw in.  It also didn't do anything in  the way of making me not like the Persian Gulf War, which I didn't like to  begin with-it's not like the film had far to go on that one.

And  there, the similarities end.
Three Kings is a rip-roaring tale that  follows the misadventures of four American soldiers at the end of Desert  Storm, as played by George Clooney, Ice Cube, Mark Wahlberg and Spike  Jonze. All are good, but the first two were revelations to me. I had never  before seen Clooney in a movie, and doubted he could fill the screen. He  put my doubts to rest. The guy's a movie star in the best, old-fashioned,  big studio sense. He can act, and he exudes star power. Similarly, I had  seen Ice Cube do capable work playing one sort of character in contemporary  blaxploitation and ""urban"" pix (Boyz' in the Hood, New Jack City,  etc.), but didn't know if he had any range. He does. His endearing,  Bible-spouting character was a great challenge he made the most of. The man  may now quit his day job.

It is a great movie because it  juxtaposes great action sequences, astounding special effects, very good  acting and-perhaps most importantly-a look at the terrible toll that war  takes on people.  Plus, it's funny!
Not to be missed.

His `video' journal was short and mainly covered pre-production and the premiere. The  `making of' documentary was excellent and covered the whole production of  the film.  The commentary from the producers especially Chuck Roven was too  verbose. They mainly talk about money, casting and other production issues  that I've never found that interesting or entertaining.  The deleted scenes  were okay and you don't gain much to the story although they do explain  Conrad Vig's weird gun. The rest of the extras are just added features to  the documentary and was just a bit too much. A very good DVD to have in  your collection if you like the film.

1265055,4,B00003CX73,"George Clooney is definitely a big screen star.  I first saw him in ""Out of Sight"" which I enjoyed, and later in ""One Fine Day"" with Michele Pfeiffer. I bought both of these DVD's and have  watched them several times. I also made the mistake of buying ""Dusk  til Dawn"" --a Quentin Tarantino film I hated as it was filled with  gratuitous violence. (I like and own copies of other Tarantino films-  ""True Romance"", ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Reservoire  Dogs"").
Clooney plays offbeat leading men quite well, but there's no  romance in this film.  He also seems to have a ""bad boy"" side  (reminds me of Steve McQueen), and given his last few films, I think he is  poised for a career living on the edge of the law.
In ""Three  Kings,"" he's serving in Uncle Sam's army during the Gulf War. He and  his two sidekicks become separated from their unit--on purpose.  They've  discovered a map on an enemy soldier that purportedly leads the way a stash  of gold and other valuables Sadam looted from his own people.  The  ""treasure"" is hidden in a village of hapless Iraqi civilians  caught up in the Gulf War conflict.
The story doesn't go exaxtly as  planned by Clooney and company (mad dash to the loot, snatch it, take it  home).  Almost everything that can go awry does, and in spite of  themselves, the ""Three Kings"" end up being mighty  warriors.
This was underrated at the beginning of it's run in theaters.  You might consider renting it before you buy it to determine whether you'd  watch it a second time. (It's a bit irreverent of the U.S. Army and  reminded me of ""Stripes"" with Bill Murray.)",958780800,,1586,4.555160142348755

1265058,5,B00003CX73,"Three Kings is one of those strange kinds of movies that leave you hanging  with so many emotions you do not know quite how to handle it.  the movie  makes us laugh, it leaves us frustrated with the horrors of war, and it  makes us feel that any conflict, not matter how horrible, can work out in  the end.  Director David O. Russell has left us with a film that is nothing  short of brilliant, echoing the confusion and frustration that was  Operation Dessert Storm.
Perhaps the biggest surprise of Three Kings was  the superb acting by every member of the cast.  Mark Wahlberg and George  Clooney contained a strange believable chemistry and proved they could  break free of past acting stereotypes.  As I look at Ice Cube's character I  was able to forget his life as a rap star and saw him as a US Army soldier.  And of course who can forget Spike Jonze who proved that he could act as  well as direct high quality movies (Being John Malkovich).
Many  traditional war movies tend to make Non-American characters very static,  fitting neatly into stereotypes.  Three Kings is very careful not to fall  into this horrible pitfall.  Within the Arab community we see a people  suffering from a horrible dictator with the courage to stand up and fight.  Many aspects of Three Kings show us how our world is shrinking, and though  we may live in separate countries or on opposing sides, the essentials that  we hold dear stay the same.
I hope to see more work by David O. Russell  in the future.  In Three Kings he has created a masterpiece that has  quickly found a permanent home among the great movies of the 90s.",958521600,2,1614,4.510416666666667

In all honesty, I felt that it tried very hard to be everything you expect from an action movie and failed. The fighting scenes  were too violent for a 'comedy', which is what it seemed to be lacking.  What is true about it is that it can't be catergorised for the simple fact  that there's just too much going on and none of it is good enough to  sustain real interest. It's a guy's film.

What doesn't work  is the conflict, the characters and the situations.  Unless you know a  great deal about the gulf war I doubt you could be transported by this  movie.  It simply leaves too much unexplained, and a dissatisfying taste in  your mouth.  REPEATED viewings will reveal it's genius, but on the first  viewing, prepare to be somewhat bored. P.S.

Wait  until you see the bullet through the body moment...a fine case of violence  on screen actually sensitising you, not desensitising you! A mainstream  film with independent sensibilities is quite an accomplishment. The DVD  doesn't spare on the extras. The deleted scenes are short and pretty  pointless, but the commentary from director Russell is engaging and quite  informative. Best of all is the video journal, taking you through Russell's  problems making the film which he recorded himself, running to a good  fifteen or so minutes. It's a nice change from the PR stuff you usually get  on these things. Warner Bros always give good films some great extras,  which isn't usually the case with other studios, so it's no surprise to see  the quality of this package..

1265128,2,B00003CX73,"This movie got a lot of hype from some of my favorite critics so I was excited to see what it was all about. Sadly, I found this film to be overrated. Three Kings had all the chances in the world to be an  intellectually stunning movie, but every time the film approached an  interesting subject some sort of Hollywood-ism would work its way in and  the exploration would be destroyed. Case in point, a helicopter attacking  our heroes is brought down by a C-4 laced football. This comes around at a  time when the movie wants us to take things seriously as oil is poured down  a soldiers throat to attempt to show the true nature of the gulf war. You  can't be smart and stupid at the same time.
The attempt of this movie  was at dark comedy, not war. This would work brilliantly but the film is  stocked with so many typical Hollywood fight scenes that it becomes in your  mind a bad war film rather than good comedy. The movie dragged on and  explored nothing. They teased the audience by approaching the subjects of  the media and oil but all the film came down to was greed. ""Gold  Solves Everything"" could have been the title. The four soldiers find  the gold early in the movie and from there it becomes barter to get them  out of all of their sticky situations. Finally, after what seemed an  eternity, we approach a big ending which sadly disappoints you by being so  clean and simplistic. Once again our friend, the gold, makes an appearance  and solves everything!
The directing was bold and the acting good, but  it doesn't make the movie hold on its own. The interesting camera shots  grab your attention and add a lot of flare but in the end it's just all  camera trickery and you are left with a sub-par experience.",957657600,3,1730,4.4113924050632916

Sure,  the criticisms of the US policy are there (and rightly so)- but director  David Russell has painted practically everyone in the same light:  opportunists who are looking after their own self-interests.

I loved the film, but my friend was convinced that it  was all style and no substance.  True, the film does criticise the actions  of the American government during the conflict, but in the end it seems to  dissolve into Hollywood smaltz.  The good guys win out, and the bad guys  get punished.  The film goes to great lengths to show the corruption of the  American military, but then ruins it all by making the ending so clear cut.

But then again, I liked how the director handled  absolutely everything - including the lighting and uses of imagery. Being  an avid widescreen fan, I like how the 2.35:1 format is used to show off  the setting and images. Brilliant. And it really doesn't come off as a  mindless ""Commando"" flick where everyone and everything gets  blown up, although it does go into that for a short while. Clooney is real  good here, and quite funny in places; I think on the whole the cast did a  real good job. The only critique I have of it is that it gets a little too  sentimental towards the end, and that probably takes away some momentum. I  was scared to death that this was going to be one of those artsy war  movies, which, according to me, never works. PLEASE KEEP THE ARTSY  SYMBOLISM OUT OF THE WAR MOVIES!

When a truck explosion is the  highlight of a film, what else is there to say?  Probably the most annoying  and unrealistic portrayal of a newsreporter ever captured on screen is  evidenced here. How can the director, producer, scriptwriter, and actress  allow such a mockery of war correspondence?  I was hoping that a scud  missle would obliterate her.

Soldiers at the tail  end of the Gulf War get a lead on a hidden stash of gold and decide to find  it and take it home. What happens to them along the way changes their  objectives and changes their lives in profound ways. Director David O  Russell has crafted a movie that SEEMS to be aimless, changing directions  with the wind, but is actually a movie with a certain destination, taking a  more realistic approach to arrive there. A good example of this narrative  philosophy is pointed out by Russell in his excellent and illuminating  commentary track: in one scene Clooney is rushing pell-mell through an  underground bunker and collides with another man rushing to get out.  There's no ""point"" to it other than that these distracting things  happen in real life all the time, just not usually in the movies.

A Staff Sergeant is not called ""Chief""...  Map locations in the army are given with alphanumeric gridzone designators  which typically consist of 2 letters followed by 4, 6, or 8 numbers  (depending on the required level of precision).  But the map locations  given in Three Kings did not follow this - or any other known - format.  They were gibberish...  I'm not an explosives experts but I know C4 is  pretty benign until it meets with heat and/or pressure.  It's unlikely that  a nerf ball with C4 taped to it would explode when hitting a helicopter as  it does in the movie.  In any case, it would have never made contact with  the helicopter in the first place because the downward wash from the blades  would have knocked the ball off target...

But as a Desert Storm veteran who  fought in Iraq very close to where these events supposedly occured, I found  the film a little hard to swallow.  Events just didn't ring true.  Reservists who never saw action throwing wild parties at the conclusion of  the war - I doubt if it happened.  My unit - which did see combat - never  celebrated very much unit we returned to the United States (the end of the  mission was never clear cut - most of our fighting occurred after the  cease-fire).  A colonel yelling at a major as if he's a recruit in basic  training; soldiers in combat zones not wearing headgear; soldiers calling a  superior officer by first name; a career officer risking his retirement and  reputation (not to mention his life) to pursue some hairbrain plot with a  group of soldiers he doesn't know from Adam; soldiers running around  without the slightest hint of military discipline or training.  The list  goes on...  Virtual none of the characters in the movie behaved like any  soldier I ever knew.  (Oddly enough, the Ice Cube character was probably  the least unrealistic).  I didn't check the credits to see if any military  advisers were hired for this movie but - if they were - they certainly  weren't heeded very much.
Then there's the problem of geography.  Somehow  our intrepid stars manage to reach the Iranian border without crossing  either the Euphrates or Tigris rivers.
To give credit where credit is  due: much of the American and Iraqi uniforms and equipment were accurate.

Three Kings is a hilarious movie, but it is also a serious movie.  With A Message.  But the mesage is  wrapped in a very tasty, fascinating, entertaining package.  And the  message never seems forced, but very organic.
So we have the Gulf War,  which was hardly a real war.  And was a war about oil, plain and simple.  And we have four soldiers that wouldn't mind getting their grubby mits on a  few million worth of gold.  (Can you blame them?)  So that's exactly what  they try to do when the opportunity presents itself.
David O. Russell has  created a small masterpiece in Three Kings.  The visual style is  fascinating, the pacing shoots forward, and the acting is dead on.  And  it's FUNNY.  And there's a MESSAGE.  And just rent or buy this movie,  because it should be seen.
As for the DVD, it is a top notch Warner  release.  It features a couple extra scenes that are not just throwaway  scenes.  It has some great commentary, trailers, interesting featurettes,  and more.  Russell's video diary is quite intriguing (as well as  funny--check out that sedated Mark Wahlberg and uncomfortable George  Clooney).  And the Jonze-produced Ice Cube acting feature is pure  tongue-in-cheek fun.
Highly recommended, both as a movie and as a  DVD.

Not only a good war movie, but a good politcal movie dealing with the results of the Gulf War plus add some humor  and some really cool filmmaking techniques.  So if you liked the movie and  are thinking of buying my answer is definetly.  The DVD is loaded with some  awesome features from deleted scenes to director commentary.  It is just a  great overall DVD movie and extras.  And again, George Clooney is an  underrated actor.  Just watch him here or in the great movie Peacemaker.

1265290,4,B00003CX73,"'Three Kings' was an entertaining but improbable action flick.  It seems to be a war movie, but it is really a story about a gold heist.  The characters just happen to be soldiers in Iraq in the aftermath of operation  Desert Storm.  Major Archie Gates (George Clooney) learns of a map found by  Sergeant Barlow (Mark Wahlberg) and Chief Elgin (Ice Cube) and upon  investigating, deduces it is a map of bunkers where Kuwait's gold is  hidden.  Together they set out to find it and steal it for themselves.  This is a mild purloining of a similar plot from 'Kelly's Hero's', just  changing the war (A bunch of soldiers learn about a German bank with gold  bullion during WWII and decide to go into enemy territory on an  unauthorized mission to steal it for themselves).  'Three Kings' attempts  to take itself a lot more seriously than 'Kelly's Heroes' did, though there  are numerous light moments throughout the film.
The story required a lot  of contrivance to make it even remotely believable, but as action films go,  it wasn't totally outrageous.  The comedy worked well and there were a lot  of interesting insights into American perceptions of the war versus the  Iraqi perspective.  There were a number of reminders of the human toll that  war takes on both sides and that the enemy is comprised of real people with  feelings much like our own.
The direction by David O. Russell was good,  but he tried to get a bit to artsy with what was really a straight action  flick.  His opening explanation of the colors and exposures came across as  insecure; almost apologetic.  To his credit, the action scenes were well  done, except we really didn't need to track the path of each bullet in  super slow motion during that one firefight.  I think we also could have  done without the organ cam peek inside Barlow's guts.
The acting was well  done all around.  George Clooney gives another fine performance as the  smart, hard nosed action hero.  His deadpan style works well in this type  of film. Despite his no nonsense demeanor, he is effective in subtly  letting it be known that beneath the tough self centered exterior, there is  compassion and a sense of what is right.
Mark Wahlberg also delivers a  strong portrayal of a regular Joe reservist, trying to be the tough  soldier.  Wahlberg walks a fine line between vulnerability and machismo and  pulls it off admirably.
Overall, this is an entertaining guy flick with  some credibility problems that are easy to overlook.  I rated it a 7/10.",956880000,,2502,4.716279069767442

Another very creative and original movie with  meager box office success. This movie has an attitude and ""vibe""  very similar to Out of Sight, but it adds some outstanding movie-making.  The photography is awesome. The way the movies switches photography media  from act to act is awesome (not to mention the extra documentary on how  it's done). The action scenes are very original (a'la Matrix)and stray far  from the typical formulas all action movies seem to follow these days. The  script is very well written and effectively conveys the emotion rich story.

The director also manages to  leaven his message with humor and humanity in the midst of horror.  I found  myself tripping through a landscape of emotion: shock, laughter, dread, and  courage.  People get hurt in this film.  People rise above their own greed  and selfish ambition.  People cower in fear.  People are, well, real  people--not Hollywood cardboard cut-outs.

It is more a story of how the people of Iraq were left abandoned by the US army because they would not interfere in internal struggles.  Yet, we see in this film that  they were serious struggles and that the Iraqi army were killing their own  people.
The intervention of the US army comes about only because they  find a map where the Bunkers of Saddam are said to be filled with gold.  It  happens to be true, but the army soldiers also live the miseries of the  Iraqi people and they try to save them.
This movie is also about the  interference in this war from the Media.  However, we see that thanks to  this interference, the people of Iraqi can be ""partially""  saved.

1265379,4,B00003CX73,"""Three Kings"" is one of those strange movies that is destined to do poorly at the box office, but has lots of potential for ""cult movie"" status.
Unfortunately, ""Three Kings"" was marketed  as an action/war movie, something it is not and I think that that has led  to some of the more negative reviews posted here and in other publications.  It's really best described as an often humorous and sometimes scathing  political satire.  So you see: political satire marketed as a war/action  movie = box office failure.
This is too bad because the movie really does  have a lot to offer those who are interested in modern day social  commentary of the no-holds-barred variety.  The best analogy I can make is  to another scathing political satire (the best of our time), ""The  Manchurian Candidate"".  They are certainly very different movies in  many ways, but they are similiar in that at their root they are both  contemporary observations on our society and our political system told in a  contemporary way.  My guess is that if you liked the one, you'll like the  other.
So in short, if you're looking for a good war/action movie or a  movie in which you can see George Clooney striking a sexy pose, this isn't  it.  If you're looking for a movie that makes unabashed observations about  our consumer society and the modern day military, this is better than most.",956707200,2,1361,4.730769230769231

It blends action, tragedy, social commentary, and flawless  cinematic techniques like no movie since Bonnie and Clyde.  David O.  Russell had never made a war movie before, but he delivers big time here.  The story has great, believable characters; a good plot; and is  surprisingly angry and political.  The direction is flawless, at times  subtle and at other times boldly self aware, but always unique.  The  ""bullet cam"" scene, showing in detail what happens when a bullet  penetrates flesh is just one of the many classic scenes from this movie.  The acting is also outstanding.

I expected to see George Clooney mugging his way through a buddy movie, a smaltzy PC anti-war flick, or some other such nonsense.
How delightfully surprising, therefore, to see ""Three  Kings"". Actually, I had to be prodded into it by a friend.
The story  was far more complex than I thought it would be, and the cinematography and  direction were first rate. The best performance belongs (surprisingly) to  Marky Mark, late of the Funky Bunch. Thank God he decided to stop singing  and start acting (or was his singing an act all along?). Anyway, he was  riveting. Clooney kept the mugs to a minimum, which helped a great deal as  to the watchabillity of his character. Nora Dunn of SNL fame was a nice  surprise in her turn as a Christiane Armonpor (sp?) type reporter.
This  was a dark comedy, with morally ambiguous characters. Sadly, it is all too  easy to believe these young Americans falling in with the plot to pocket  stolen gold. On the other hand, there is redemption in this film. Tough  choices are offered, and the characters do not disappoint. This despite  their modern day cynicysm.
The film is not overly graphic, save two or  three scenes. We see in effects of a bullet on the inside of the body, and  the remains of the famous attack on the Basra road. But you should not let  these few brief moments keep you from seeing some amazing  filmmaking.
Funny, thought-provoking scripting, visual impact, and strong  performances lift this film above the hype, above the ""Mr. Star""  misgivings I had, and it delivers its message with little or no sap. Well,  maybe a little sap near the end, but it can easily be forgiven.

I was  actually confused by the ""artistic"" camera work, it didn't seem  to fit with the style of the film. Romeo & Juliet pulled it off much  better.  I guess that some of the test audiences shared my view as before  the film starts a message comes across the screen telling you that the  ""artistic"" camera work is used to reflect the emotion of the  scene.

Even though they were a renegade bunch were at odds with the rest of the  army even till that great climactic scene, I thought these 4 could easily  represent the entire American army.  They were only out to get gold.  America was in Iraq and Kuwait mostly to protect their own interests in  oil, I think--which is why I loved the scene where Wahlberg had oil forced  down his throat by an Iraqi soldier I began to like.
And the way the  camera moved, the way it followed the bullets when the bunch were first  attacked, the way we were shown what the people were thinking, made the  movie very cool, very slick.  Sometimes the scenes looked gritty, very  realistic (as realistic as a work of art can be compared to  reality).
Someone compared the movie to ""kelly's Heroes.""  The  plot is almost the same.  And the scene where the rebel leader's wife is  killed in front of him and his daughter remineded me of a scene in  ""Platoon.""  And the gritty handheld camera work looked like  ""Saving Private Ryan.""  I wouldn't blame a movie for imitating  something else.

1265554,4,B00003CX73,"I was expecting a fun in the sun with guns and gold kind of movie. Boy was I surprised! This ranks up with movies like Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line as a really intelligent ""war like it really is""  story.
It starts off fairly simply. At the end of Desert Storm a group of  soldiers find a map showing where stolen Kuwaiti gold was being kept so  they go get it. What was extraordinary was the way that the Iraqi soldiers  actually helped them but would not let them help any of the locals. Orders  from Saddam they said.
However, seeing the injustice being meted out by  the Iraqi soldiers our four heroes (Clooney, Wahlberg, Cube and Jonze)  decide to intervene. Things do not go well as Wahlberg is captured and  tortured and all their vehicles are destroyed.
The torture scene is  poignant. Wahlberg and his torturer have much in common: they are fathers,  they joined the army to give their families a better standard of living,  except that the torturer's one year old son was killed in a US bombing raid  and his wife lost her legs. When later on Wahlberg is rescued and he has a  chance to kill his torturer, his decision adds all the more depth to the  story.
Although Saddam is villified in this movie, the story seems to  take no sides. This is not about heroes and glory but about the struggle  that everyone has with their own oppression - whether it is a tyrant, a  poor job or dumb bosses. There are some very touching moments and some  great humour. All the actors are very convincing (including all the Iraqi  extras) and portay the ambiguity of people caught up in something out of  their control.

And what's with showing us  Mark Wahlberg's insides as if the audience suddenly developed Superman's  X-Ray vision?  These ""tricks"" weren't treats, did nothing to  enhance the story and should have been saved for Halloween.  The washed out  look of the video didn't do much for me wither, but having served in Desert  Storm, I know it really does look that drab over there.  That being said,  Clooney, Wahlberg, Ice Cube and Jonze were credible in their performances,  although I have a hard time believing a reservist as young as Wahlberg  would ever make it to a sergeant first class rank (rank comes much more  slowly to reservists!). The ""Arabic"" actors were good, and when  the story was allowed to develop at a natural pace, it kept me interested.  One note -- the title is never explained EXCEPT in the deleted scenes which  are some of the bonus materials supplied on the disk.  What's up with  that!  All in all, ""Three Kings"" was a decent film (or as I  like to think of it, a good film trying to escape a passable director).",955929600,3,1420,4.678861788617886
1265690,5,B00003CX73,"""Three Kings"" is set at the end of the Gulf War.  Some GI's played by Ice Cube, Mark Wahlberg, and Spike Jonze find a map on a POW detailing where Saddam Hussein has stashed some gold bullion belonging to  Kuwait.  George Clooney, who plays an officer about to retire, leads the  group in an expedition to find the gold (hint:  they aren't planning to  give it back to Kuwait).
They find the gold but then find that the Iraqui  civilians who our government told to ""rise up agaisnt Saddam"" are  being slaughtered by the Republican Guards.  Therein lies the dilemna faced  by Clooney, Wahlberg, Cube, and Jonze.
The cinematography in this motion  picture is excellent, and each of the cast members turns in a splendid  performance.  Every trick in the bag is used to drive home certain plot  points, to include sequential frame advance, slow-mo, and a very  interesting little bit that shows what a bullet does to one's internal  organs.  The writing and dialogue, especially between Ice-T and Jones or  Ice-T and Wahlberg, is very good and sort of Quentin Tarantinoesque in a  charming way.
Clearly, this is one of the most energetic and ambitious  works of the last few years in terms of technique.  I assume that it was  done to make to story stand out, but it does so quite well on its own  merits.  This film does have considerable violence, but if you can handle  that sort of thing then I highly recommend ""Three Kings"".",955843200,,1426,4.6305220883534135

It vibrates with style and energy. Like the best films of Oliver Stone and Martin Scorsese, this is a movie that's always alive through the writing and performances. Not to mention the visual look. Finally George Clooney makes a film that really does deserve four stars. ""Three Kings"" is never boring and always action-packed, but it's not some stupid action flick, this is a movie that raises issues, explores the mechanics of war and the people involved. It doesn't use the Arabs as stereotypes, in fact, it paints them almost as equals to the American soldiers. Russell makes a great point, showing that the other side suffers just as much as us. ""Three Kings"" shows how the world is getting smaller and the word ""minority"" can't be used as much, which is just as good. Then there's the brilliant cinematography that has an energy of it's own. The performances are superb and as in ""Out Of Sight,"" Clooney proves he isn't just an actor used as a package to sell an action movie like ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" (which was a cool movie). ""Three Kings,"" the best film of 1999. In a weird, way, it ranks along with ""Platoon"" and ""Apocalypse Now."" A true modern war film.",954374400,22,1340,4.780172413793103

Now, I looked up in my screenwriting mag an interview with  the other writer, John Ridley.  I guess he wanted the film to be more  action oriented, like Treasure of the Sierra Madre or Kelley's Heroes.  It  was mostly about getting the gold. BTW, the title of the Ridley script was  The Spoils of War.
David O. Russell wanted it to be more political, and  pretty much completely rewrote it completely.  The Gold was the catalyst in  this story, similar to the 30,000 dollars in Psycho.  It is what drove the  characters to get themselves into the story.  Thats the part where it is  not funny anymore.  Where these characters get their eyes opened and are  given the chance to react and become true heroes.  Now, I am not going to  spoil the film for you, but a lot of people complain about the ending being  ""too conventional"" where as I think it was the best possible way  to end the film.

1266196,4,B00003CX73,"Along with American Beauty, The Fight Club and Eyes Wide Shut, Three Kings is a good example of how major studios have made some pretty inventive films in 1999.
What sets Three Kings apart from other, more conventional  war movies is the way it blends a huge array of ideas into one cohesive  structure. George Clooney, Ice Cube and Mark Whalberg play the three kings,  a group of American soldiers who find a map giving the location of stolen  Kuwaiti gold in a prisoners rectum. As the gulf war is nearing an end they  commandeer a humvee and make their way across the desert in search of the  loot.
The movies first half an hour takes a very comic, up-beat tone.  When the soldiers arrive at a small village everything appears to be going  well until they are exposed to the slaughtering of innocent civilians. Mark  Whalberg is captured and at this point the film turns into a rescue film.
Three Kings eventually turns into the type of movie where the soldiers  can no longer pillfer the gold but must simply do what is right. In a way  this seems like a sort of compromise from what the film was trying to say  at the beginning but it all works out right in the end. What's the most  interesting is how director David O. Russell comments on modern day media  and consumerism. Three Kings is quite distinctive in the sense that it has  far more things to say than a standard movie.
Visually speaking Three  Kings is also a treat to watch. One in particular example stands out, a  controversial shot of a bullet slowly entering a human body. What makes  this shot so unique is the fact that it is filmed from the perspective of  being inside a human body. There has also been a great emphasis on the  colors in this film. The desert a wonderful visual backdrop that Russell  takes full advantage of.
The films conclusion is ultimately the one major  flaw here. It is quite sad when you see such a unique film take on a very  straight forward and predictable ending.

With this and Out of Sight under his belt (and the Coens' ""Brother Where Art Thou"" and Wolfgang  Peterson's ""Perfect Storm"" on the way) George Cloony could turn  out to be a really great cool actor, and Mark Wahlberg proves once again  (see Boogie Nights) that he is more than just a singer who drops his pants.  Ice Cube and Spike Jonze were great as well, I might add.  The best part  about this movie is that it doesn't abandon intelligence like most action  movies do these days, and preserves a strong political viewpoint  throughout.  The footage of the bullet entering the body was unlike  anything ive seen used in film, and the gunfight scene in the villaige was  great.  I think the most important part of the movie however was the long  running scene in the bunker between the imprisoned Wahlberg and his captor,  who lost his wife and child in one of the US's air strikes.  It shows that  both sides have something to lose, and offers the fact that the US can't  always be seen as the only side fighting for a richeous cause in a war.  By  the way: I am not one who likes to pass judgement on other peoples' movie  opinions, but I must say that anybody who gives Ace Ventura precedence over  this masterwork has more than a few screws loose.  I can't wait for the  DVD.",952732800,16,1393,4.41501976284585

Then, there is the great directing, as far as  I can remember, the Dorector has done a great job in mixing different  musics. Finally, all the actors are amazing, so my only advice is for you  to buy this movie, if it's not for the seriousness of the story, then buy  for the fun you'll have while watching it.",952214400,2,488,4.159574468085107

1266333,5,B00003CX73,"Last night I saw the UK Premier of 'Three Kings' with a friend of mine.  The main question running through my mind was, is this going to be just another gung-ho Schwarzenegger movies but set after the Gulf War?  I came  out of the cinema with the answer I didn't expect.  It is one of the most  anti-American movies to date, attacking the Bush administration and the  handling of the war.  The cinematography was a great feat with different  cinematographic films signifying the emotions of the soldiers, and  mindblowing special effects.  But this isn't just an action movie, it has a  spiritual and philosophical twist and many moral issues are raised  throughout.  For your own sake, please watch this movie, it will make you  all warm and fuzzy inside.",952041600,3,756,4.75968992248062
1266334,5,B00003CX73,"What makes a good war movie?  Is it an enormous amount of action and kill scenes.  No.  Is it a large number of big name actors.  No.  A great war movie constitutes an emotional feeling, it shows the two spectrums man  undergoes while in combat.  In a war man can be said to be at his ugliest.  That is why, when war movies reach to the other end and show how the human  spirit can in fact be good even at the time of war, that movie is said to  have a great impact.  I feel Three Kings does just that.  This film also  has an edge to it you do not see in many films today, it is almost  revolutionary.  Also, Spike Jonze gives a great performance in this film,  which is his acting debut.  He also had a monster film for his feature film  directorial debut, Being John Malcovich.  Spike Jonze could be one of the  most underrated men of the year.  If you want to see the greatest war movie  ever you really have three choices, Full Metal Jacket, Platton, and Saving  Private Ryan.",951955200,,981,4.128342245989304
1266335,5,B00003CX73,"It may go down in the history of film that 1999 was one of those years that broke the mold. This year a new generation of filmakers broke mainstream, those raised on MTV and such icons as Stone and the Beastie  Boys. In comedy, Spike Jonze dazzled with the brilliant Being John  Malkovitch, in Europe Tom Twyker's Run Lola Run broke the rules of time and  film concept. In drama, however, it was David O Russel's Three Kings that  led the pack. Ignored at the Oscars, this film is one of the best of the  year. It is everything a movie should be: entertaining, thoughtful, and  original. One of Russel's strongest characteristics is his visual style, a  style that is the so clearly defined you can barley believe it is that of a  young filmaker. The film also boasts strong performances from Clooney,  Whalberg, Cube, and the previously mentioned Spike Jonze, whose portrayal  of a redneck soldier is one of the film's strongest elements. As for story  and script, the film is equally strong. In conclusion, Three Kings is not  only a great film on its own, but a great represention of what may be the  new breed. Old school: Take heed.",951782400,,1137,4.569306930693069
1266336,5,B00003CX73,"A smart and funny war film that shows you don't have to be unoriginal to tell a war story. I think that Speilberg's Saving Pvt. Ryan is a poor film because it's dialogue and character development lack any realism and  originality, this film however has those qualities in abundance. Great  acting all around, a smart script and unflinching direction, this film is  very creative. In what could have been a typical war film director David O.  Russell adds the reality and intelligence of a world that has become  completely commercial. In doing so the story becomes new and fun.

A perfect war movie for our current period of time, Three Kings delves headlong into the alienation and circus of modern war. Reserve troops who are in the military for the extra bucks, media types going to battle to get the scoop, the artificial ""one world"" propaganda that stirred us into conflict - it's all there.

1266340,4,B00003CX73,"First and foremost, I was entertained, but looking deeper into the movie, I find more and more I like about it the more I think about it. It's a war movie with a sense of shame about war, which I think all good anti-war (or  at least anti-violence) movies need to have.  The heroes are flawed, and  that to me makes them much more believable and acceptable.  And it also  makes me want to listen more to what the film has to say about war.  One  of the big problems I had with 'Saving Private Ryan' was that Spielberg's  heroes were unconditionally good.  He was obviously trying to make an  anti-war/pacifists' movie (just look at the first half hour), but as the  movie progresses, it decends into shameless, flag-waving propeganda.  Spielberg would have us believe that even though war is evil, the men  fighting it are good.  It's a contradiction in terms.  I didn't believe  these ""angels in earth"" or anything they had to say about war  because of all this.  Now back to 3 Kings...  The heroes of this war are  completely believable to me.  They are virtuous, loving family men, yet  they're also greedy and exploitative.  If they ever pretend to like what  they're doing in Kuwait (like Wahlberg in the torture scene), then they  (and we) are reminded of the folly of international trade, of power  struggle, of oil monopoly, and of the arrogance of the United States.  But  even in the midst of all this corruption and fighting, they manage to be  heroes by saving some innocent people's lives, as if to say, ""We may  not be perfect, but that's no reason why we can't do some good while we're  here.""  They admit their faults and rise above them, rather than  pretending to be perfect.  They become war heroes without condoning war,  and to me, that's a successful war film.",951091200,10,1782,4.56687898089172
1266460,2,B00003CX73,"There is much that is both right and wrong with this film. It's extremely funny, well acted, and has some very intelligent things to say about war and its effects on people on both sides-- during the first half of the  movie. But midway through it loses track of what it wanted to be, or maybe  didn't ever know at all. What starts as a condemnation of gung-ho Rambo  warhawk mentality then turns into exactly that: a gung-ho Rambo action  movie with people outrunning bullets and explosions and knocking down  choppers with explosive-laced footballs. But you're not supposed to notice  this is happening because the characters are doing it for ""good""  reasons, and are supposed to laugh as the ""bad guys"" die by the  dozens. The intelligence and wit and irony built up at the start all goes  up in a big explosion, and then gets wrapped up in an all too convenient,  simple conclusion-- a tragic waste of an inherently complex, interesting  premise.",951091200,7,950,4.7317073170731705

I thought it was  directed superbly with some of the most creative and unusual visual and  directing effects you will ever see. The return to the village and the  shooting scene in particular were fantastic.
The film touched on some of  the moral issues of the war and asks alot of very profound questions about  NATO involvement.
It is one of the few movies I have seen which doesn't  seem to have a slow bit in it.

If you have seen "" Kelly's Heroes "" ( a groovy Clint Eastwood Vietnam era WW2 war / heist flick ) you have a good taste of  the plot of 3Ks, except 3Ks does add more to the after effects of war,  explains and shows what gunfire actually does and shows the human cost. No  I haven't really seen this too much in modern American film, but any well  or decently informed person should already know this.

It is a pity  if OSCAR does not  honor this film. From my readings, the general  consence of most critic put this film in their top ten.

This movie impressed me by tackling some moral issues surrounding the conflict in  Iraq/Kuwait as well as issues surrounding war itself.  But the issues are  not developed very fully and the comedic aspect of the film overshadows and  takes away from that development.  Saving Private Ryan, Platoon, etc.  didn't make a comedy out of themselves.  I think the comedy hurt the film.  In addition I thought that the story wasn't all that original.  You have  the anti-hero archtypes in the three leads who end up in the end making the  right choice.  (We haven't seen that one before).  If somebody asked me if  I liked this movie I would say ""Yes."" but I would not give it a  five.  I give it a high 3, pretty average.",949881600,,833,4.513513513513513
