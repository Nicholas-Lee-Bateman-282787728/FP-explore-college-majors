This show is a pretty solid worth Owning.

Overall Rating 4/5
The show is about Tamaya Seikichi, a famous fireworks maker from Japanese history.  A rather fictitious account with aliens, ninjas, and a plan to reach the moon with fireworks.

If I remember right, that was the plan The animation style is a bit odd but don't let that hold you back.  The show has some solid comedy and quite the cast of unusual characters.  The old guy in the wheelchair really has a funny surprise.  This show seems to have always been available very cheap.  Do yourself a favor and pick it up.

Theme Songs 4/5
This series has some catchy uniquely odd and good music. I never skipped the opening or ending

Ending 4/5
NO spoilers, the end was well done.  When you saw where it was headed, you wondered how they would wrap it up. I liked the ending for this one.",1502668800,,874,4.40625

8508494,5,B0071LEM2I,"This is a crazy, wonderful series and so much more than I had read of in magazine reviews.  The music is tops and stuff you normaly would not hear in anime either, another plus in my book.  This is heading to the top of my favorites list and top shelf of the collection shelf too.  My only complaint is that I waited so long to get it.",1419206400,,335,3.970149253731343

8508497,5,B0071LEM2I,"This is a great anime. I really like the little factoids that are constatly dropped about the Edo period. the comedy is lively. I watched the dubbed version and the storyline went well. The tranlstion points are beyond me, but as long as I am entertained, I am unconcerned with such things. I thought the comedy was great, and the gags were amazingly cross-cutural. The show also had a great plot wich was very well followed with a well resolved ending. The characters were well concieved. The voice actors gave wonderful performances. It was just a great show all around in my book. I give it full marks. I could see how some may not like it, but I would think that would be due to a matter of personal taste rather than a lack of artistic or technical quality on the part of the anime.",1364774400,,787,4.397260273972603
8508498,5,B0071LEM2I,"This is quite possibly, the perfect anime show.  It has just the right mix of action, adventure, suspense and crazy anime comedy.  That, combined with beautiful artwork, animation, and one of the best English dubs I've heard (seriously the voice acting is great), make it a must have for any anime collection.

Even if you're not into anime, give this one a try.  You won't be sorry.

It tells the story of firework maker Seikichi and the eccentric residents of Fuari row-house as they band together to help the strange and beautiful alien girl Sora return to the moon.",1358294400,2,569,4.707070707070707
8508499,5,B0071LEM2I,Another fun show with a great hook and excellent dub work by the American VAs.  This is another show that probably had another great season or two in it but ended on a high note.  The animation is great and the cast and setting really deliver the laughs over and over.  A must see.,1358035200,3,281,4.166666666666667
8508500,5,B0071LEM2I,"It is sometime in the mid-1800's in Edo (modern day Tokyo) and the young fireworks maker Seikichi Tamaya is having hard time due to harsh frugality laws, which ban all luxuries, including fireworks. The law doesn't stop Seikichi from doing what he loves best, but it does make for difficult working conditions. But one day Seikichi comes home to find a strange girl with an even stranger request: she wants Seikichi to build a firework that will reach the moon!

When I first saw advertisements for this show, I thought it looked kind of fun, but I wasn't really interested in it. But when I read a review for it on ANN that praised it and its excellent dub, I thought I'd give it a shot (I prefer to watch anime in Japanese, but I always appreciate a good dub). I watched the first episode online to check it out and it was suitably funny, so I picked up the set to watch with my sisters. We all enjoyed it greatly. The characters are awesomely wacky, the setting excellent, and the plot moves along at a good pace. The dub really is excellent, and I don't think that the series would have been quite as good in Japanese. We did watch a little of it in Japanese to compare, and while the voice acting for the Japanese dub was quite good, the humor was lacking. The English dub adds quite a few jokes and adapts the humor to a more western style. I think that they managed to make it much more enjoyable to western viewers while still preserving the spirit of the original.

If you enjoy wacky humor (for example&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kodocha-The-First-Season/dp/B003NE8B56/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kodocha: The First Season</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sgt-Frog-Season-One/dp/B0049TC8DA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sgt. Frog: Season One</a>) then you should be sure to give Oh! Edo Rocket a try. It is a solid, humorous, and entertaining show. (Oh, and did I mention there are aliens?)",1328227200,11,1985,5.1806853582554515
