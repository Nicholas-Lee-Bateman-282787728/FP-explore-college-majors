7337442,3,B011MMK87Y,Better than Season 2 but not as good as Season1. I bought the blu ray version Season 3 through Amazon Prime for 14.99. It is not Mike Rowe narrated. The other retard narrated it.,1444089600,6,178,4.264705882352941
7337443,1,B011MMK87Y,"Science Channel Fans, it pains me to tell you that this ""How the Universe Works"" is not the same one that is played on channel 284. This show sounds a little different to because the narration is not performed by Mike Rowe. It's very deceiving.  The audio is horrible quality and drowns out the voices of the scientists. I am not sure if it's a copyright issue and that is why they are not allowed to sell the original ""Mike Rowe"" version.

I loved the first season so much that I own it on Instant Video and DVD and have bought 6 more copies for family members.  The science taught in the show is spectacular.  I can't imagine how much it would cost to get the expert panel to do a seminar in one room.  All of these top notch experts donated their time for the sake of educating the World's future outside of a classroom setting.  I hated Science when I was growing up. My teacher didn't like to be a teacher and therefore I never thought it was interesting.  These wonderful teachers know how to relay the information in an engaging way so that we can all understand it.

They have amazing graphics, captivating CGI and scientists who are so smart that my brain would explode trying to follow their train of thought.  But, Mike Rowe's soothing voice makes everything better.  There is something about the reassurance in his voice that makes everything alright. Like a father comforting a scared child; Mike Rowe's comforting voice makes the explosion of the sun not sound like it's so bad. If he was a new reporter, I would crash my car to get home in time to see him go on the air.  The show is wonderful, but Mike Rowe turns it into a Superfecta of awesome.  :)

I do hope that Discovery/Science Channel will release the original version with Mike Rowe's narration.  If that day comes, will owe Amazon a lot of money for DVDs and Instant Videos.",1441411200,45,1850,4.43491124260355
7337444,5,B011MMK87Y,Mike Rowe is back! HOORAY! And the graphics keep getting better (which I wouldn't have believed possible),1440374400,2,105,5.235294117647059
7337445,1,B011MMK87Y,"This DVD was produced terribly.  The sound quality was a disaster.  The music played too loud over the narrator. There are times the narrator could not be understood.  There were no subtitles included. You actually need subtitles because sometimes you cannot hear the narrator. The actual shows for Season 3 as shown on the Science TV Network were excellent.  For some reason, the original narrator for Season 3, Mike Rowe, who is outstanding, was substituted for another narrator for this Season 3 DVD.  On the other hand, Season 1 and Season 2 DVDs, were excellent quality.",1489017600,6,575,4.947916666666667

7337450,4,B011MMK87Y,"I held off buying this dvd due to some of the reviews. I shouldn't have.  The background? music on the segment on the sun
was so loud it was VERY  hard to hear  the narration.  Calling the narrator a retard is uncalled for. He is reading the same script
that Mike Rowe would have read.  As I write this I've only seen two segments so cannot speak about the entire dvd, but I should say
the background music on ""The end off the universe"" was OK.  The narration was very good. I would recommend buying this DVD.",1473379200,2,509,4.195876288659794

Bad sound mixing on the segment ""The Sun.""  On that segment, the sound effects and music are so loud that sometimes you cannot hear the narrator or the commentators.  If you like the series, you'll like this one, too.",1470614400,5,361,4.758064516129032

7337461,1,B011MMK87Y,"After watching the first two season of this series I was eager to buy season three.  Today my husband and I watched the first episode and were shocked to find the sound quality so bad that it rendered the product useless.  The background music and sound effects are so loud that it drowns out the narration.  In addition there is no Closed Captioning so we couldn't even turn that on to figure out what was being said. Without the narration this is just a disk of loud explosions and crashing music.  The difference between this season and the previous two is that Amazon manufactures these disks themselves.

I will return these product, buy it from a the original source, and avoid all Amazon manufactured DVD in the future.  If you're interested in the science this series presents, avoid this product.",1450051200,20,805,4.714285714285714

8724683,5,B011MMK87Y,"If you are a fan of How the Universe Works seasons 1 and 2, then you will enjoy season 3.  Essentially a continuation of the same format of season 2 with new content and the same voice over from season 2.  The quality of the video and audio is great.  I did not see any issues described in an earlier review.  I highly recommend getting season 3 if you enjoy How the Universe Works!",1518825600,,382,4.121621621621622

Changing my review because it's not Mike Rowe doing the narration where as IMDB (amazon company) lists him as doing the narration. Erik sucks compared to him.",1501545600,,271,4.645833333333333
