8505174,5,B006VWB6BI,"I was looking for ways to support my kids in learning my native language and this DVD set is just perfect. Both my 2 years old and 5 years old boys love it and learned many new words from it. They use their new words on their own without me even guiding them. In addition, the customer service people at Dino Lingo are wonderful. They were very fast fixing the version problem.",1390435200,,377,4.25
8505175,5,B006VWB6BI,"I am a Turk and my wife is American.  Since my son is spending more time with my wife when I am at work, I don't get as much time to practice Turkish with my 3 year old. So I decided to buy this when I heard about it from a friend of mine.  Let me tell you, this really works!  My kid  loves it (duhh! what 3 year old wouldn't like dinosaurs!) and started to pick up lots of words. I like how this is laid out as a fun activity than some sort of course/lecture.  Highly recommend it!",1334880000,5,483,3.79
8505176,4,B006VWB6BI,"We don't have any kids. You might call us senior citizens.

We're planning a trip to Turkey in the near future. We've used the Pimsleur Turkish language CDs to get a strong introduction to the Turkish language but we wanted a way to get a broad overview of Turkish vocabulary. We figured that a product designed to teach kids might be just what we needed. That's why we ordered this product.

It works! Although not ideal for adult sensibilities, these DVDs provide a broad overview of the Turkish vocabulary. Turkish is presented in a fun way. You can learn hundreds of words for foods, animals, nature, activities, objects, people, relationships, etc. It would be nice if they offered some of the same content in a more compact, adult format, but, even so, this is a good way to learn. Maybe after we return from our trip, we'll give the DVDs to the grand-kids.",1332979200,4,863,4.633986928104576
