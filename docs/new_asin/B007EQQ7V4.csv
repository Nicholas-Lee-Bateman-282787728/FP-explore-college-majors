8515310,1,B007EQQ7V4,"Imagine a small group of NY lesbians smoking crack and then deciding to make an ""imaginative"" film on a $10.00 budget. I did not find anything shocking or funny. And worse, it wasn't entertaining, it was just stupid. The stories, including any possible plot spoilers are printed on the back of the DVD. There are also three additional short features not listed, which are about as long as the 4 short features you just watched.

Fans of John Waters and Pink Flamingo might have some borderline entertainment.",1413504000,,508,4.839080459770115

The sick sad sexless over at ASS Studios suffered greatly for their art, and now it's your turn...if you thought the Cinema of Transgression ended when Lydia Lunch took exercise advice from Lady Queen Bee the Church's Chicken Lady and Richard Kern quit painting a swastika over his lower extremities, then think again. Rev. Jen and Courtney Fathom Sell are here to bring the pain until you make it rain. Watching this disc was like masturbating without the virtue of spit and still managing to crank out large gobs of the hooey blooey. A sweet surprise for the uninitiated. Buy a copy for your mother.",1348704000,,703,4.770491803278689
8515312,5,B007EQQ7V4,"Oh My dear Rabbit glory hole! What have I fallen into this time? It seems the LES of Gotham is rampant with beatific bullies who abuse their many casual acquaintances in local bars, bodegas and most frequently on the damn street. The characters include many buxom babes, one whom appears to have a confounded convolvulus or a very thick root. My favorite character is the inebriated Salesian who injects each enslaved victim with enemata to preclude the introduction of enterococcus into delicate orifices.
What else can I say? This is the best movie ever made by humans or immortals. I bought it three times.",1348704000,3,609,4.865384615384615
8515313,4,B007EQQ7V4,"You know how you always think, Wow, I wish I lived back when, I'd go to the Factory and meet Warhol and see all those cool... Well, no, you wouldn't have; you woulda watched the Smothers Brothers on CBS and watched commercials for Prell Shampoo and had a burger and gone to bed, right?

Well, the stuff you'll hear about twenty, thirty years from now is in all its lurid, ridiculous, disgusting, joyously perverse glory here. Watch the Downtown Superstars of the last 20 years united and reunited, and see whether you dig it or if you want to turn it off and watch Glee. They've held court on the bleakest stages of the most demanding performance island on Planet Earth, Manhattan. Fix your eyes on them and they own you. Put your bottom out to be spanked.

Hard. HARDER!

I won't insult you with spoilers. These artists have been creating and performing new material for decades. They're worn-out drunken shells of their never-were selves and you can smell the given-up real-life glee of having nothing left to lose but to go balls to the walls, often literally. OFTEN, I TELL YOU.

Live the regret these cinematic pioneers breathe every day. Live the art edge of civilization in its severest decline. Eat your own puke AND LOVE IT.

Thank you. I love you. Every stinking, sleepwalking one of you.",1348704000,,1298,4.650655021834061
8515314,5,B007EQQ7V4,"I need a rape shower for my eyes after viewing this cinematic cacophony of B movie cliches artfully collaged into an homage to Jane Fonda-era Roger Vadim objectification of both the female and the male anatomy - hell, it's all one big object that many have objected to, but that I find strangely comforting to know that there are still efforts underway to undermine my mind with stories of vile bullies exerting their power over shaved-headed weaklings. Keep up the good work.  Can't wait for the next one!",1348704000,,506,4.75
