1234709,2,B00000JN3D,"These are five of the worst movies I have ever seen.

The only one worth the plastic it is encoded on is Master with Cracked Fingers.  Even that contains scenes blatently chopped from Drunken Master (a true Chan classic), and for the grand finale Jackie has mysteriously disappeared, replaced by a barely adequate stand-in.

In Young Tiger, Jackie is miscast in an uncomfortable bad-guy role with a horrible, hairy mole on his cheek.

Fantasy Mission Force is just plain bizarre, with Chan appearing only occassionally.  At least when he does show up, he's in classic Jackie Chan form.  This is in stark contrast to his unfortunate roles in Young Tiger and Eagle Shadow Fist.

Eagle Shadow Fist is a fairly standard kung fu flick...in which Jackie is killed off in the first half of the movie. I can't comment on the rest of the movie because I turned it off after that.

Fire Dragon is, perhaps, the worst of all.  It isn't even its own movie, it is a hacked up, alternate version of Fantasy Mission Force.  Many scenes were blatantly chopped from Fantasy Mission Force and dropped awkwardly into Fire Dragon, overdubbed with completely different English dialogue.  Weird!  Fantasy Mission Force was bizarre to begin with, but hacked up and rearranged into Fire Dragon, it is completely baffling.

The only way I could recommend anybody to ever purchase this set of films, is if you really want to own five of the worst movies you'll ever see.  Fantasy Mission Force, and its hacked up sibling, Fire Dragon, are so incredibly strange and awful, they're almost worth watching on that basis alone.  Master with Cracked Fingers has its moments, but is ultimately disappointing on several levels (not the least of which is Jackie's absence in the big finale).  Eagle Shadow Fist and Young Tiger might be tolerable for their genres, but certainly not for Jackie Chan fans.

Do not buy this set expecting to see the Jackie Chan we all know and love, or you will be bitterly disappointed.  If you are looking for classic, early Jackie Chan, I highly recommend Drunken Master.",1166832000,50,2069,4.813031161473088
1234710,3,B00000JN3D,"A nice collection of movies. A few of the old-world pony tailed martial arts movies. You can see a yound Jackie Chan maturing throught these movies.
About the DVD's I should say that the Pan & Scan is shabbily done with too much zoom, so that it makes us miss the action most of the time. You feel as if the person on screen is fighting with himself. The audio is also a bit weak. However I think it is due to the quality of the originals itself rather than the DVD mastering.
As is common knowledge, Fearless Hyena is a classic. Great action, nice storyline and good tempo. The movie video is better too as it is a recent movie than the others, which have some faded screens, especially Spiritual kung fu.
I couldn't comment on FH II however as I bought a used colleciton and this movies was not there. Reading from the other reveiws I gather that Iam not missing much.
Spiritual kungfu is a funny movie if you can accept ghosts acted out by guys dressed in white with red/blue/purple wigs !!!
Half a loaf of Kung fu is a poor effort to be funny but some of the action is good.
To kill with intrigue has some great action and amazing talent from most of the actors/actresses in the movie. But Jackie looks like someone else with an ugly ponytail wig and different facial make-up.
New fist of fury is to be considered a extra or bonus thrown if you buy the five pack. The movie doesnt merit anything else other than being a Jackie chan movie, and is nice to own one of his early days movies.",1007424000,6,1491,4.27208480565371
1234711,3,B00000JN3D,"I have the VHS videos of all the films on this DVD.  Please don't make the mistake that Jackie actually LIKED doing Lo Wei films!  Except for Fearless Hyena 1, which Jackie directed, he loathed them.  He was under contract to Lo Wei and only broke away when he signed with Golden Harvest and made the breakthrough martial arts film, Young Master.  The Lo Wei films in this collection are very badly done (except for Fearless Hyena and perhaps Half a Loaf of Kung Fu, which was an attempt by Jackie to ""break away"" from the martial arts mould).  But they are all worth seeing, just to view Jackie ""in embryo"".  His martial arts skills and stunts are as amazing as ever.  So grit your teeth at some of the comedy and storylines - and just enjoy Jackie!",988416000,4,750,4.391304347826087
1234712,3,B00000JN3D,"This collection in my opinion is a great bargain at 55 bucks and is a must have for any jackie chan fan.  Despite Fearless Hyena 2, To kill with  intrigue, and new fist of fury are all pretty bad films. The great fearless  hyena and the entertaing half of loaf of kung fu and spiritual kung fu make  this collection worth buying for the avid jackie chan fan as jackie show  off his trademark comedy/kungfu and charm.",966124800,4,416,4.35064935064935
7912708,4,B00000JN3D,"Ok...read the rest of the reviews, I do not need to rehash them. You get what you pay for. I really plan to use the nice metal case to store all my Jackie Chan movies in.
NOTE: If you have Amazon Prime then you can watch some of these (and others) there in better quality.",1455148800,,272,3.963636363636364
7912709,1,B00000JN3D,"The idea of a collection of Jackie Chan movies in a nice collector tin was very appealing. I like some JC movies. Having said that, this was a mistake. Even at the low price. These have to be among the worst movies ever produced. The sound quality is very poor. The dubbing is horrible. They are more valuable as a cool set of coasters. Literally!",1414368000,,347,4.3538461538461535

7912711,1,B00000JN3D,They sent me just a case. While the case (as seen in the picture) is cool i would have loved the DVDs that came with it. Luckily the people who sent it were nice enough to give me a refund without any hassle but just be careful and be sure your getting EVERYTHING you are paying for.,1385683200,,283,3.982456140350877

7912713,3,B00000JN3D,Sound was bad.  I guess these were his first movies. Picture quality not that good.  Not what I expected.  Was not worth the money,1380672000,,130,4.333333333333333
7912714,5,B00000JN3D,"These have to be some of Jackie Chan's earliest works.
I think it takes a true aficionado to fully appreciate this collection.
This would be a 'must have' for any serious collector, to be complete.

As an aficionado, I enjoy this collection the same as I do the old Keystone Cops movies, or W.C.Fields, Laurel and Hardy, and other unique, if dated, classics. We need to judge them in the light of the times in which they were created; not compared to modern film making techniques. It would be like comparing a classic model T Ford to the latest Ferrari. They each hold their own special place in history.",1352246400,2,605,4.5504587155963305
7912715,3,B00000JN3D,"I think whether or not you enjoy this collection depends largely on what you expect. If you believe the blatantly deceiving ad copy, and think you are going to get some rare classic Jackie Chan gems for this price, you will no doubt be quite disappointed.

This collection is better thought of as the ""Before he was famous Jackie Chan collection,"" and as such delivers footage not to be found elsewhere of a young and sometimes very young Jackie Chan, before he rated star billing. This is the sort of collection for a die hard Jackie fan who wants to be able to say to a friend ""Hey, check out this old movie I found with Jackie  Chan in it, but as a bad guy...""  Or a sidekick, or whatever.

And yes, as I said, the ad copy for this set is deceiving. It says ""rare and astounding,"" but I think it is only rare because  much of the footage is probably from the cutting room floor, and astounding because although it is billed as a Jackie Chan collection, Jackie is only the star of one of the films, and that one is a re-edit of a much more familiar film. One film is even a rehash of another in this same collection, and in it Jackie only appears using the same footage with a different English dub, and where they needed to otherwise use his character, the camera only shows the back of a double's head. The packaging of this collection is deceiving as well, being full of stills from much later Jackie Chan movies. I think the deception, however, is on the part of Madacy Entertainment, the company selling the videos, and not on the part of Amazon.

As far as the films themselves being ""the worst,"" or whatever, I think they are in general pretty standard for at least the B movies of the era and the genre. I think the bitterly disappointed reviews you see here are from people who expected what the  ad copy promised. And I suppose they should be able to believe what they read, but really, do YOU think you're going to get five wonderful and rare Jackie Chan movies for eight bucks or so? If you purchase them knowing what they really are, I think you will find them worth the small price you must pay to get them.",1320710400,6,2123,4.319095477386934
7912716,1,B00000JN3D,"this is a horrible box set, picture transfer is horrible, sound quality horrible and for some reason the main title screen plays the HALLOWEEN 2(1981) movie music for some reason. This is horrible do not buy this crap!",1318464000,,218,4.7631578947368425
7912717,1,B00000JN3D,"If you are a Jackie Chan fan then you will vomit when you see the films in this ""collection"".  They are horrible and this one is certain that Mr. Chan would like nothing more thten to have them disappear.
This ""collection"" of garbage was a huge disappointment and this one would never recommend this to anyone under any circumstances.
The person who produced this set should be hunted down and publically flogged while being forced to repeatedly watch each second of each disc without mercy.  Surely, that must be what hell is like!",1225756800,25,532,4.709677419354839
