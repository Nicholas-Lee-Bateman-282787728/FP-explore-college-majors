It begins at an airport. A C-54 is prepared for its flight. Dan Roman checks it over. He was the pilot on an airplane that crashed on take-off. Mr. Flaherty checks his luggage. Passengers have to give their name, age, and birthplace. Women wear gloves. Their fuel is 3,050 gallons. They talk about Dan Romans experiences. A young boy travels alone, Toby plays with a toy airplane. A man takes a basket of food with him. I like him. Toby wears a toy pistol when he boards the airplane. [Imagine that today!] A late arrival pays cash. Passengers are buckled in for take-off. They head west to San Francisco. One passenger appears scared. There is a slight disturbance.

The conversations tells about the passengers. They show V-1 rockets being tested at a restricted military base. One Professor explains his opinions about this; he will be sent home now! One woman asks to leave the airplane with the crew to avoid a man. Are the propellers in phase? When will they pass the point of no return? The talk pads out the story, but tells about the passengers, like the Josephs. [Would that language be used today?] Dan inspects the tail section - no trouble found. One passenger carries a revolver and walks along the aisles. Is he jealous? There is a gun shot! Then a motor catches fire! A radio message is relayed by a ship. The Coast Guard is informed, they send an aircraft and a boat. But there is not enough fuel now! They throw out luggage to lighten the weight.

On man plays his harmonica. Newspapers on the mainland ask for news. The passengers are told how to prepare for ditching after they are given life vests. This danger affects the passengers outlook on life. How close are they to the coast? One woman worries about her looks. [The Right to Keep and Bear Arms was then unrestricted.] The Coast Guard airplane meets them. Do they have enough fuel now? Dan thinks about this, he has an idea to save fuel. They approach the Farallon Islands. The passengers inflate their life vests and fasten their seat belts. The lights are turned on at the landing field, emergency vehicles get ready. There is safe landing and happy meetings for most passengers.

This was adapted from Ernest K. Ganns best-selling novel. Using travelers to provide a story goes back to The Canterbury Tales. Trans-ocean travel was a new form of travel after WW II; previously most people traveled by ship. After the sinking of the Andrea Doria in 1957 people switched to air travel (one day instead of five). The ship that hit the Andrea Doria survived because it was built for the icy waters of the north Atlantic and had a reinforced bow. This is slow-moving at times, it is not an action movie. It documents the culture of the times: ladies wear white gloves, men wear hats, you could carry a pistol aboard an airplane. Note the attitudes of the people.",1443052800,,2877,4.61328125
