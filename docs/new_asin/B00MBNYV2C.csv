8671460,5,B00MBNYV2C,"you are bless-youing because you got a germ mama. Oh how fun Oh the Skin you are In has been in our house! My 4 year old now thinks of herself as the diagnose and gives me checkups even more than she used to after watching this fun DVD. She has been curious about how the body works and asking questions recently, so we received this at a good time! She watched, enthralled as Martin Short took us on adventures through the body! Sneezy riders (as you could probably guess) was her favorite, only because mama was sneezy too! I know this will be a great addition to our video library, and will be watched many times. It is nice to be able to put on an episode and know that she is being entertained as well as gaining a little knowledge too! These are timelessly classic stories I will be able to share with my other little one when the time is right as well. We look forward to seeing more from the Cat in the Hat, since this was such a big hit.",1419811200,,946,4.118918918918919

8671462,5,B00MBNYV2C,My  3 year old son absolutely loved this dvd! You can never go wrong with the Cat in the Hat! He's watched it daily since we've gotten it! I love the fact that the cat teaches  children educational topics and does it in a fun way that catches their attention!  I would recommend the dvd to anyone with small children who love to learn!,1418860800,,335,4.203125
8671463,5,B00MBNYV2C,"The Cat in the Hat makes learning fun yet again! In this newest release, Oh the Skin We Are In, we learn about the body including our skin, bones, heart and stomach. This DVD release has an approximate running time of 60 minutes. The five episodes on this disc are The Skin I'm In, Jiggle Bones, Rumbly Tumbly, Keep the Beat and Sneezy Riders. The episodes are wonderful as usual- just the right mix of learning and laughs! My kids always enjoy the bonus features as well. The typical Cat in the Hat extras are included on this release. During ""Hat Chat"" we learn some fun facts about moths and wolves, and ""Fish Facts"" teaches us about bears, frogs and flamingos. The DVD also includes the ""Take a Picture"" challenge and a couple short ""Songs"". If you're kids like the Cat, this will be an instant hit!
