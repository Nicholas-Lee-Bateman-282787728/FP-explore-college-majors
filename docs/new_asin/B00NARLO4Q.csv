6622879,5,B00NARLO4Q,"really great DVD showcasing the past 40 years of Austin City Limits.  Tribute to Jimmy Vaughn and the last song ""Not Fade Away"" are worth the price of the DVD",1420416000,3,158,4.266666666666667

6622884,3,B00NARLO4Q,"I thought the selection of guests and songs was only a middling representation of the whole 40 years of ACL. It probably would have been better to simply pick out the best of the best past shows and do an anthology. Sheryl Crow was fine, though she outright stole Janis Joplin's (IIRC) licks on Me & Bobby McGee. Did Jeff Bridges really deserve a spot to do a song? There was a group I'd never heard of that sounded somewhat like early Santana. It was a good energetic performance, but again, not representative of ACL's 40 years. Willie Nelson? Of course. Lyle Lovett? Sure. Bonnie Raitt? Yes. I would also have asked Shawn Colvin, Asleep At The Wheel, played the clip of Coldplay performing a song they wrote for Johnny Cash, and invited Rosanne Cash to be on the show. These were my thoughts watching the broadcast. I was disappointed.",1415145600,34,838,4.593333333333334

6622903,2,B00NARLO4Q,"I was very disappointed. I thought it was a compilation of previous ACL actual performances.
 Suggest you buy actual ACL performances of the legends who have performed there.",1445212800,11,174,5.214285714285714

6622910,2,B00NARLO4Q,"I have to say, I didn't enjoy the 40th Anniversary much at all. For me, ACL's appeal is it's eclectic mix of performers, and can be hit or miss depending on your tastes. It began well, but quickly lost me. I actually fast forwarded through most of it. If a song or performance doesn't grab me, I move on. These didn't grab me.",1430352000,4,326,4.190476190476191

8677002,2,B00NARLO4Q,I didn't like this at all.  What was Bridges doing there?  Totally out of place.  I skipped around and only liked one performance - Kenny Wayne Shepherd with Stevie Ray's Band.  What great musicians!,1514505600,,199,4.764705882352941
8677003,2,B00NARLO4Q,"Not as good as it should have been.  Jeff Bridges does not belong on this stage.  Kind of like having your Uncle Barney play.  The performances by those who do belong were not the best, alas.",1509494400,,191,4.25
