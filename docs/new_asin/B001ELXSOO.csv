8298808,5,B001ELXSOO,"I just love Ti Lung.  I think he is one of the best kung fu fighters.  Good movie with a good plot, theme, whatever.  Tells about the evils of opium addiction and how it can take you down just like any other illegal drug can.",1441929600,,225,3.9555555555555557

8298813,3,B001ELXSOO,Anti-drug martial arts movie with a bit more plot and a bit less action than average (but not a lot less action). Nice change from the usual Hong Kong Cinema fare.,1323388800,,163,4.290322580645161

 Highly Recommended.

I understand the DVD is from the same superb master.",1239148800,,181,5.103448275862069
8298815,5,B001ELXSOO,"Great movie that captures the evils of drug addiction and how it almost destroyed a great martial arts master, the fight scene between Ti Lung and Chen Kuan Tai is a classic you can watch over and over again. Highly recommended.",1238371200,,228,4.585365853658536
8298816,1,B001ELXSOO,"I just recently purchased Opium and the Kung-Fu Master, I have read a lot of reviews about it and it turned out to be an excellent movie!

However..
I included a screen shot along with this just an alt+print screen cropped to the player window for your reference.
[...]

When I capture a picture with my software dvd player (VideoLan aka VLC, and power dvd, and windvd) it does not capture the white frame it appears normal. (as in the whole frame not just the films frame)
Of course the white frame happens still in my hardware ""set top"" dvd player plays the frame white too.

Also, I noticed that the framerates play differently in set tops and software players (set top plays at 30fps and software a 23.97? aka 24fps) which gives different run times.
On VLC it is at 37:40 or on power dvd it is 36:47 (Same scene though)
This is not a hardware or software problem as you can see from the picture included, but rather a possible bad pressed disc, or a bad flag, a bad transfer, or bad Authoring.",1236556800,3,997,4.378378378378378
