8148134,2,B000IZTV3Y,Darren McGavin was the only thing that made it watchable.,1472774400,,57,4.8
8148135,4,B000IZTV3Y,"Darren McGavin one of the best actors ever and known for The Night Stalker series that should have lasted more than one year and is
probably known more for that Christmas Story movie that plays every year during Christmas is here in a real 70's classic that is much
better than you'd expect. Yeah it's corny and has some really bad music but it has some great car chase scenes with some great classic
cars and some really funny moments and lines especially between him and the girl who plays his partner in reposing cars. Joan Collins
is in a few parts as a car thief who they continue to chase and he ends up having a fling with her but she really doesn't do much in movie.
The actor playing the girl part is pretty funny but I never saw her in anything else. This movie was never released in theater from what
I read but I saw it in reruns when I was a kid and just found it on internet. I can't believe it's not available on DVD. I don't know about the
VHS that buyers are selling on here but the movie is a rare 70's comedy action movie and McGavin is at his best in this one! Too bad
those horrible actors and singers the Hudson Brothers who had a Saturday morning kids show in 70's is in this movie! only bad thing.",1460073600,,1221,4.1344537815126055
8148136,5,B000IZTV3Y,Joan Collins in a  pre Dynasty fun comedy  romp. Sylvia Miles provides great support.  Some camp but give it a chance.,1361491200,,118,4.523809523809524
8148137,4,B000IZTV3Y,"Then this is your movie!  This isn't a great film, but it's fun to see a silly car chase movie with the always great Darrin McGavin (A Christmas Story, Night Stalker) as a down-on-his-luck divorced guy who has lost everything in a divorce (with his lawyer played by the unparalleled Dick Martin (Laugh-In).  His car is repossessed and he falls in the the repo crew when he gives chase to the young lady who takes his car 'Larry' Wilde (Denise Nickerson).  The repo crew is headed by the rather forward Sylvia Miles, who is still active in films today (Darrin McGavin passed away in 2006, and 'Zero to Sixty' was Denise Nickerson's last film, when she was about 20).

The film involves a multitude of great chase scenes with the full-sized mid-70 model cars (and a phone booth or two) that can't handle worth beans, and slide all over the place when they go around corners and hit vegetable box after vegetable box crashing down LA alleys.  There is also a great motorcycle chase with young Larry trying to run away from a bunch of thieves.

It's a fun film with some great old cars (most of which are smashed up pretty good by films end).  There's also a nice Alfa Romero Spider appearing in the middle of the film.

All in all, a fun film with McGavin the glue that holds the film together.  The wonderful Vito Scotti has a bit part as one of the repo crew.

Recommended as a slice of mid-70s life.",1255564800,3,1399,4.4296875
