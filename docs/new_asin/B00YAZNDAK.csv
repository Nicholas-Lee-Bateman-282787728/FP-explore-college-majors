7210202,5,B00YAZNDAK,"This film is quite excellent with a high entertainment value!  Considering its low budget it is actually rather awesome. Check it out, you just might love it.",1445904000,5,158,4.851851851851852
7210203,5,B00YAZNDAK,I really enjoyed this movie.  It's hilarious and very well written. I was also very impressed with the soundtrack and plan on exploring some of the music further. The music credits included websites for some of the artists - thanks! I like it when a movie includes 'outtakes' after the credits and this one does. It gave me a more personal glimpse into the film - thanks again! ! I will enjoy watching this again with some like minded friends.,1444867200,4,443,4.5375

7210205,5,B00YAZNDAK,"I was fortunate to see this premier in Plymouth, NH.  It felt like a showing of Rocky Horror Picture Show.  Laugh out loud material straight out of the mind of a madman.  No...genius.  Mad genius?  Watch this without expectation.  Enjoy!",1439078400,7,237,4.8

7210208,5,B00YAZNDAK,"As a kid growing up on movies like Day of the Dead, Night of the Living Dead and Creep Show, I found this movie to be right on par with the aforementioned. The flick is full of surprises and takes turns that you wouldn't expect. This movie continues the legacy of the B movie cult genre. CHECK IT OUT!!!",1472688000,,303,4.1525423728813555
7210209,1,B00YAZNDAK,This movie is a huge waste of time. Not even bad enough to be funny. Skip this one,1472428800,,82,3.611111111111111

7210212,3,B00YAZNDAK,"Campy. Filmed on cousin's
 farm with drinking buddies. Still, it was  entertaining..for  90 minutes.",1469750400,,100,6.0
7210213,4,B00YAZNDAK,"This movie surprised me, it was obviously pretty amateurish but it made me laugh alot",1469577600,2,85,4.733333333333333
7210214,2,B00YAZNDAK,"Schlocky movie, very low budget, bad acting but the Zombie Boy actor was great in his over the top rendition of a live able Undead",1467676800,,130,4.24
7210215,1,B00YAZNDAK,Boring start,1467504000,2,12,5.5
7210216,1,B00YAZNDAK,Gun fighting zombie with a beer utility belt.  Enough said.,1467504000,2,59,4.9
7210217,1,B00YAZNDAK,"Poor does not cover it.  Waste of bandwidth.  How does such ... get released?  Bad idea.  Bad script.  Bad acting.  Bad camera work.  Bad make-up.  Bad, bad, bad.  Not a comedy.  Nothing to do with the old spaghetti westerns.  Junk - pure and simple.  Only someone involved with this junk would give this a positive rating.
Save your time and effort.  Watch something like ""Warm Bodies"" or ""Night of the Living Dead"", or ""Zombieland"".  But not this junk.
Just shows how low the bar is these days.",1467331200,2,496,4.551724137931035
7210218,5,B00YAZNDAK,Not your normal Zombie move. It is nice to have something different and entertaining. If you  are looking for the same old zombie move this is not it. But if you want something that will have you laughing and keep you entertained you can not go wrong. Hope to see more from this production and group. everything works well in this take one part out and I don't think it would be  near as good. I think because this was a low budget film that is what made it work. The just went old school special effects and it worked.,1466985600,2,519,4.18
7210219,1,B00YAZNDAK,Don't waste your time! Movie is a real train wreck right from the start,1466812800,4,71,4.142857142857143

7210222,5,B00YAZNDAK,"Great, fun movie! Zombie love story with crazy action. Went to the premier and the rest of the audience loved it, too! I also enjoyed one of dirctor Jamie Sharps' other movies the mockumentary The Bigfoot Diaries.

7210225,1,B00YAZNDAK,Imagine a 12 year old who aspires to write and direct a movie actually gets the chance write and direct a movie. This movie is essentially the result,1466208000,5,149,4.357142857142857
7210226,3,B00YAZNDAK,Unique...it helps that we know some of the cast. They're just like that.,1466121600,,72,4.615384615384615
7210227,5,B00YAZNDAK,"Has some really hilarious moments. It's put together and flows well too. Don't let the ""independent film maker"" part turn you off to it. Waiting for the sequel!",1465776000,,160,4.75

7210230,5,B00YAZNDAK,"The zombie theme is all-the-rage, these days. Thankfully, this isn't JUST another zombie film or TV show. It has all the basic ingredients; plus New England scenery, off-the-wall humor, and crossover themes from different genres. All together, it'll leave you filled with laughter, and a great taste overall!",1463529600,3,308,5.4375
7210231,4,B00YAZNDAK,"Suspenseful, funny, violent movie from a New York Film Academy alumni.  You haven't seen a zombie movie like this one.  Great entertainment!",1460851200,2,140,5.318181818181818

7210234,5,B00YAZNDAK,"Dare I call Zombie Boy the zombie comedy event of the year? I dare. In fact, I suggest that it embodies a whole new genre of movie, the zomedy. As in, ""Have you seen that great new zomedy, Zombie Boy?"" Or, ""And the academy award for best zomedy goes to--no surprise here folks--Zombie Boy!"" I was lucky enough to see this in a packed theater and the audience howled with laughter throughout. This is a movie to see if you've always thought that zombies would make better friends than enemies. This is a movie to see if your drink of preference is beer, which plays a large enough role in the Zombie Boy that it might almost be seen as a secondary character (""And the academy award for best supporting role in a zomedy goes to...""). Watch Zombie Boy with buddies and a Bud.",1456704000,3,772,4.368055555555555

7210236,5,B00YAZNDAK,"A must have for anyone who loves zombies, beers, and cheesy movies! A great mix of comedy, slasher, drama, and even romance.  It may not win any Oscars, but it won a place on my top shelf! Joey",1454803200,,193,4.078947368421052

7210239,5,B00YAZNDAK,"From somewhere, hidden deep within the family bunker, basking in the glow of the computer screen, and surrounded by dehydrated food, and anti-government literature, self-proclaimed film critic, Chad Downing declares Zombie Boy, a must see.  A wonderfully, campy, misadventure. It will touch you in a special place, that hasn't been moved since your councilor snuck into your tent at summer camp. It will restore your faith in love, zombies, and alcohol.....",1453852800,3,457,5.436619718309859

7210243,5,B00YAZNDAK,"This movie is destined to become a cult classic. So over-the-top it's brilliant fun. The micro budget actually made the production value endearing.  If you like zombie stories, this is a must-add to your collection.",1448409600,4,215,5.142857142857143

8717999,4,B00YAZNDAK,This movie is worth the time to watch. It's corny but it will have you laughing all through the movie. The acting could have been a little better but it is a b-movie. Give this one a try.,1510444800,,187,3.9473684210526314

8718004,4,B00YAZNDAK,"Watch with low expectations and remember to have fun. Like playing outside when we were kids, plus with fireworks and guns shooting blanks! Oh wait, kids probably haven't played outside in the past 20 years.

Oh well have, fun, and stick around for the bloopers after the credits.",1477872000,,280,4.833333333333333
