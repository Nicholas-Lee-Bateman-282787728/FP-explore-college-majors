Stewart and Fonda can be counted on for excellent performances--Firecreek is no exception--but what impressed me most was the solid script. I did not find  the movie by any definition overlong or 'unrelentingly downbeat.' A  well-crafted, well-acted and thoughtful film.",948326400,6,329,5.56

555214,3,6303072747,"I first saw this movie many years ago and it made an impression on me. It took me so long to find it again I had forgotten the title. It is one of the few I could remember that stars both Henry Fonda and James Stewart, so those were the search terms I used. The first two thirds is introductions of the characters and build up. The last part is worth the wait. Not a lot of action, but I thought the script and the acting carries it. One of the main characters is the antagonist (I won't say which one) but I'm not used to seeing him in that role.

555274,5,6303072747,"This is a GREAT, classic western, shot in 1968, starring two of the greatest actors of all-time, James Stewart and Henry Fonda. They are both outstanding here as good man/part-time sheriff and bad man/killer, pitted against each other in the small, lazy, complacent town of Firecreek. The subtle, beautifully etched characterizations of these men, Fonda's pack of animalistic killers, the townspeople, mark this as a western maybe even a cut above ""High Noon.""  There is a similar structure to the great, rousing climactic shoot-out, but this story, in many ways, cuts deeper. It is beautifully shot, masterfully scored, and supremely well-edited. The screenplay doesn't waste a word and tells us much about how letting evil have its way only makes us pay a higher price later on: the film couldn't be more timely.  All great westerns are, in essence, morality tales, and this is one of the finest. How could it NOT be with these two greats, Stewart and Fonda, at their finest?  Compare their acting styles and abilities to ANY male actor today and all come up short compared to these two giants: their finely wrought emotion, their subtle, deep way with a word or speech, their instinctive excellence.  The climax to this unjustly neglected masterwork is the final shoot-out between these two stars.  It is superb, moving, and grand.  Leonard Maltin and other so-called film critics badly missed the boat on this one, but, interestingly enough, The NY Times film critic at the time, Howard Thompson, gave it a rave.  Look it up on-line - he's right on target.  This is one of the best films either of these two men made - ""FireCreek"" is one of the greatest film westerns of all time.  Buy this or the DVD dual version with a lesser, but fun film of the two stars, ""The Cheyenne Social Club.""
""Firecreek"" is definitely worth owning.  A five star classic!!",1239321600,,1855,4.841772151898734

555276,4,6303072747,"HIGH NOON, in a sense, all over again, but, of course, not nearly as good. James Stewart plays a weak farmer-sherrif in a western backwater town, and Henry Fonda rides in one day leading a small gang that gets the idea it can do whatever it likes and no one will stop them. They are almost right, until the end, of course, when Stewart's feelings of pride and honor suddenly emerge from their slumbers; he shoots them down one by one, except for Fonda, who gets his from the woman (Inger Stevens) he's confided in while in town. No doubt it's a downbeat oater, and though it copies NOON (especially the ending), it doesn't have the suspense or energy of the earlier gem.",1144022400,7,670,4.455284552845528
555277,5,6303072747,"The only problem with this is it is not on DVD and given the rightful restoration job it deserves. A fine cast, a great premise. Jimmy Stewart gives one of his finest performances as a common man placed in an uncommon situation. A simple, honest farmer, and good man who works part-time as the small town's law officer, he is placed in a position where he must make a tough stand and face almost unbeatable odds. The story is compelling, because it is the type of story where an ordinary man must become a hero. A man faced with evil, a man who won't back down just because he is afraid. His job is to protect a two-bit town that is being besieged by outlaws and the locals are too old, too afraid and either unwilling or unable to help him. He must face the odds alone. And that is the stuff that good westerns are made of! Henry Fonda does an excellent job as an injured outlaw leader who sees their two trains heading towards each other on the tracks, but is unwilling to throttle down or veer off and avoid the inevitable collision. Why isn't this amazing western on DVD?",1127088000,5,1075,4.326732673267327
555278,3,6303072747,"The unbeat beginning foreshadows the sadness to follow.  A gang lead by Fonda completely disrupts a small isolated community forcing a quiet farmer-rancher (Stewart) into the climatic showdown with Fonda.  The movie is hard to watch if one is looking for a film with good action and interesting characters.  This movie has some of that, but watching it on TV, with the comercial breaks gets to be to depressing at times.  I rate it 3 stars - GOOD for the preformances of both the lead characters and the rest of the excellent cast.",1082160000,3,531,4.67741935483871

7836786,3,6303072747,"The draw of this movie is seeing James Stewart, Henry Fonda, Jack Elam and the Farmer's Daughter - Inger Stevens in a western.  A trashy version of the ""High Noon"" storyline with one dimensional bad guys basically only interested in taking advantage of the women they see in the town.",1501027200,,284,4.68
7836787,4,6303072747,"RELEASED IN 1968 and directed by Vincent McEveety, ""Firecreek"" stars Jimmy Stewart as a farmer living on the outskirts of a small town of losers where hes the honorary sheriff. When a group of ne'er-do-wells comes to town hes compelled to take action. Henry Fonda plays the leader of the rabble-rousers while Inger Stevens appears as the quiet woman who sparks his interest. Gary Lockwood plays the top troublemaker with Jack Elam & James Best in tow. BarBara Luna is on hand as an irresistible squaw and Robert Porter as the stable boy, the catalyst.

The director was a reliable TV director of shows (e.g. Star Trek) & movies, but Firecreek was his first theatrically-released film. While his oeuvre includes a handful of other theatrical films, he mainly stuck with TV. I point this out because Firecreek has a bit of a TV Western feel to it, which isn't to say its not a solid Western, its just not on the level of the contemporaneous Bandolero!, also starring Stewart. The build-up is long and low-key, but the dialogues are good for the most part and you get to know the characters and their situation in a remote town of losers, as Dean Jaggers character humbly describes them.

Speaking of the town, this is a decidedly town-bound Western, with some scenery shots at the beginning. This isn't necessarily a bad thing as the celebrated Rio Bravo (1959) was a town-bound Western, but this limits the movie. In other words, don't expect a wilderness Western with numerous breathtaking scenic shots in the background, e.g. Jubal (1956).

Stevens plays the notable intelligent lady that trips the trigger of Fondas character. Unfortunately, shed be dead less than two years after the release of Firecreek from (supposedly) intentional overdose. She was only 35; what a shame.

The producers made a good decision to NOT make Fondas character a one-dimensional villain. Actually, the mans nothing of the kind, but he has to fulfill his part, his duty, in order to maintain the respect of his men. The success of the movie all depends on if Stewart can deliver the goods when the protagonist is finally forced to make a stand, come hell or high water. And he does so superbly.

THE FILM RUNS 104 minutes and was shot in North Ranch, Agoura Hills, California, as well as Warner Brothers Burbank Studios with establishing shots in Sedona, Arizona. The screenplay was written by Calvin Clements Sr. ADDITIONAL CAST: Morgan Woodward, Ed Begley, Jay C. Flippen, Jacqueline Scott & Brooke Bundy.

7836788,4,6303072747,"Under appreciated western. It made an impression on me as a youth. Now revisiting it the film seems to have grown on me more than I remember.

The real payoff is the plethora of excellent character actors on display. Most impressive to me, the 4 baddies in Fonda's gang are given real characterizations, real personalities. James Best, Morgan Woodward, jack Elam & especially Gary Lockwood as Earl. Lockwood does an amazing job. His bad guy is probably one of my favorite of all time.

7836789,3,6303072747,This is more of a traditional western then The Cheyenne Social Club.  James Stewart plays a peaceful farmer who is also Sheriff with a home made badge his kids made him.  Henry Fonda plays the leader of a gang that rides into town and starts bullying everybody.  When Stewart finally decides to take a stand.  It is kind of slow.  The final showdown is pretty good.

7836790,5,6303072747,Henry Fondation is one of my favorite actor. He is very convincing in fire Creek. James Stewart is very good actor.,1478044800,,115,4.523809523809524
7836791,3,6303072747,"Minor western about a farmer and part-time sheriff (James Stewart) who has two little boys and a wife in labor.  He keeps trying to look the other way when Henry Fonda and his gang of outlaws ride into town, causing minor disturbances at first.  Things eventually (and very slowly) escalate until James Steward can't ignore the situation anymore and must take a stand.

While Henry Fonda is technically the head villain, his character is too inherently decent to be a real villain.  This is a far cry from Once Upon A Time in the West (which came out the same year)--that film allowed Henry Fonda to show a genuinely evil and sadistic side that's completely missing here.

Firecreek finds James Stewart's part-time sheriff turning the other cheek and telling himself it's the right thing to do for most of the movie's length.  The gang doesn't really have any nefarious plans for the town--they are basically a bunch of low-level louts and idiots except for their leader Henry Fonda, so Firecreek never builds up much in the way of tension on the way towards its final confrontation.

That climactic showdown pitting James Stewart against Henry Fonda and his men is pretty stirring, but it seems to take a very long time in coming.  Director Vincent McEveety is mostly a TV veteran who helmed some minor 1970's Disney movies but never really distinguished himself much behind the camera.  His direction is functional but little more, showing little feel for the differences between television and feature films.  Firecreek could easily be a television film as there's nothing particularly theatrical about it in terms of visuals, sweep, language, violence or subject matter.  Firecreek feels kind of boxed in and small for big screen a western, which is something that might have been used to the film's advantage to make it more claustrophobic and suspenseful if it had been an intentional stylistic choice.

James Stewart and Henry Fonda make Firecreek watchable enough as a time waster if you are looking for a minor western that you might not have already seen, but it's one of those movies where once is most likely enough.  Both actors have made much better examples of the genre than this.",1477267200,,2196,4.902702702702703
