7789468,4,0780622391,"Peter Yates' ""Run of the Country"" (1995) is a pretty obscure picture and only available on VHS. I was able to secure a brand-new copy recently for only 25 cents. But maybe it's not so obscure since a poster for it can be seen at a cinema in a 1995 episode of Seinfeld, ""The Pool Guy"" (season 7, episode 8).

THE PLOT: Near the border of Northern Ireland an 18 year-old named Danny (Matt Keeslar) leaves home after the death of his mother due to serious friction with his gruff father (Albert Finney), a local cop. Danny moves in with his free-spirited friend, Cocoa (Anthony Brophy), and learns the ropes of manhood, including an intimate relationship with a girl across the border, Annagh (Victoria Smurfit). When crises strike he finally comes to understand his... (watch the film and find out).

Shot in the Redhills, County Cavan, area of Ireland, near the border, ""Run of the Country"" is a realistic coming-of-age drama. The acting is great across the board, especially Finney as the father and Brophy as Danny's wild friend. Simply put, this is quality drama with laughs, romance, conflict, action and gorgeous photography of rural Ireland.

7789470,5,0780622391,"I thought that this was an excellent movie.  Set in Ireland, it is about a young man, who after his mom dies, tries to make it on his own.  He does  not like to listen to his father, because he thinks that he killed his  mother.  He goes and he lives with a very outgoing friend named Cocoa.  When they go to town across the border, he sees a girl that he instantly  falls in love with.  They meet and do fall in love and eventually she gets  pregnant.  The two families have two totally different approaches on what  to do.  The girls family ships her off, and punish the boy for what he has  done to their daughter.  All in all I thought that this was an excellent  movie.",940896000,4,674,4.076923076923077
