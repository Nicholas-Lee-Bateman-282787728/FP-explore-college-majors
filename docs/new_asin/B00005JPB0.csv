1570319,4,B00005JPB0,"Sometimes coming in second can be a good thing. While ""Capote"" stole the awards and the box office, ""Infamous"" covering much of the same ground involving writer Truman Capote fashioning his ""novel"" In Cold Blood surprised me by how much better it was as a drama and how much richer the performances were. I say surprised because of the structure of the film and the fact that I had ""seen"" this story already in its predecessor. ***

Director/writer Mark McGrath (""Emma"" and the TV version of ""Nickolas Nickleby"") makes some fascinating and daring choices here. WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD By implying that Capote fell in love with Smith, McGrath suggests his artistic decline and fall into despair pushed the writer into alcoholism ultimately destroying his art and, in the process, making him a shell of his former self. Dramatically it touches on what truly was missing behind the story that drove ""Capote"". Keith proves himself every bit the equal of Oscar winner Philip Seymour Hoffmann and I personally found his performance more nuanced, richer and with a deeper sense of humanity and vulnerability. Adapted from the book by the late journalist George Plimpton, McGrath makes the choice of putting intermittent interviews with the actors in character. While this is disruptive (much like ""Reds"") at first, if you're patient you'll discover that the contrast between what we see happening and what they say happened provides an additional perspective missing from ""Capote"".

Capote (Toby Keith) intrigued by the brutal murder of a family in a small rural Kansas town arranges to write an article for The New Yorker magazine. Capote already well known at the time having published six previous books so thinks he'll have no problem getting the town's people to talk to him about the family and the tragic events. He takes along his best friend Harper Lee who is waiting for her book To Kill a Mockingbird to be published. Lee provides the humanity and warmth missing from Capote who is witty, sarcastic and just doesn't fit in as a flamboyant gay man in the early 60's in Kansas. When the police officer investigating the case (Jeff Daniels) refuses to give him special access about the case, Capote finds that Lee is right-he has to open up himself to a certain extent but, more importantly, use those he knows (Humphrey Bogart, Frank Sinatra, Lauren Bacall and other celebrities he worked with at the time) to impress and break the ice for the locals. Once the killer's are caught Capote finds himself drawn into their world particularly that of Perry Smith (Daniel Craig from ""Casino Royale"", ""Layer Cake"" and ""Munich"" in a stunning performance). Capote has to put aside his defenses and truly open up to Smith who hides a soft, almost artistic soul beneath his hardened exterior.

""Infamous"" receives a top notch transfer. Images are crisp, colors bright and the Kansas landscape is captured in all of its stark beauty. In contrast the sequences set in Manhattan with Capote's society friends (played by Hope Davis, Sigourney Weaver, Peter Bogdanovich as his publisher and, Gwyneth Paltrow, Isabella Rossellini, Juliet Stevenson) are bright, cheery looking as if we are in a perpetual party. Audio is as crisp as a cold morning in Kansas. ---

Director Mark McGrath provides a feature length commentary that is often fascinating focusing on everything from the creative decision he made for the opening nightclub sequence to why he chose to cast his film the way he did. Surprisingly, McGrath doesn't discuss the competing film which would have made the commentary catty (I'm sure he disagreed with the choices of director Bennett Miller and writer Dan Futterman made for their film) and that's to his credit. We also get the original theatrical trailer but no featurettes on Capote, the impact of his relationship with Perry and how McGrath believes it contributed to his artistic decline and fall into alcoholism.

 In this case second place proves to be more fruitful for the viewer-""Infamous"" speculates on the relationship between Perry and Capote but much of what director/writer McGrath does makes artistic sense even if we truly will never know how much of this is true. The film is more compelling than ""Capote"" and daring as well with its unusual structure which includes intermittent ""interviews"" with the actors in character discussing Truman Capote, In Cold Blood and the impact it had on his career and, ultimately, his life.",1171843200,3,4443,5.021709633649932
1570320,5,B00005JPB0,"`Infamous', written and directed by Douglas McGrath, based on the book `Truman Capote' by George Plimpton is a doppelganger (sorry, no umlaut available) to the somewhat earlier movie `Capote', with the title character famously played in an Academy Award winning performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman. Both films start with Capote's reading about the Clutter murder in The New York Times and both films end with the execution of the two murderers and the publication of the `non-fiction novel', `In Cold Blood'.

I can tick off so many things I like about `Infamous' that one wonders why it languishes while its earlier twin revels in glory. Part of the story may simply be that like the `Dangerous Liaisons' / `Valmont' pair of movies of a few years back, `Dangerous Liaisons' came out first; however, it also had the far superior cast and somewhat better writing, even though the two movies were adapted from the identical 19th century French novel.

The most important comparison, of course, is between Hoffman and Toby Jones, who portrays Capote in this movie. It's easy to understand why Hoffman got the Oscar, since it was such a stretch for the tallish actor to play the diminutive Capote, while Jones required virtually no camera trickery to have him appear as the 5' 6'' writer. Jones also seems to have the same roundish face. So, as far as the lead roles go, I think it's a photo finish, with the edge going to Hoffman for the fact that he had to work harder to fit the part. When we get to the supporting cast, things look MUCH different. Sandra Bullock's portrayal of Capote's close friend and author of `To Kill a Mockingbird', Tess Harper Lee is truly remarkable, especially when you compare it to so many of her other roles. Next in importance is Daniel Craig as Perry Smith. In `Capote', a relative unknown played this role, and absolutely nothing sticks in my memory about this performance. Craig, the new James Bond, on the other hand demonstrates the kind of acting which made him stand out as the first real challenge to Sean Connery in the Bond role. `Infamous' explores aspects of Perry's character that were not even touched in `Capote'. And, there are some prison scenes between Perry and Capote which surprise us in the extreme, and reveal a connection between the two men which `Capote' doesn't even hint at. The one role where `Capote' has the advantage is with the character of the local police chief. While `Infamous' Jeff Daniels does an excellent job, he just doesn't seem to fit the part as well as Chris Cooper in `Capote'.

From this point, all the rest of the character portrayals seem to be fairly comparable, albeit just a bit different. Where `Capote's primary literary business figure is `The New Yorker' editor, Wallace Shawn, played by Bob Balaban, `Infamous' has Random House president Bennett Cerf, played by Peter Bogdonivich. In support is an amazing list of actresses, Hope Davis, Gwyneth Paltrow, Isabella Rossellini, Juliet Stevenson, and Sigourney Weaver in minor roles, serving as witnesses to Capote's personality. These characters are used in much the same way as Warren Beatty used his `witnesses' in `Reds' or, in a wildly different context, as Woody Allen used them in `Annie Hall'.

These talking heads do contribute an amazing amount of detail and understanding of Capote to the movie. When I reviewed `Capote', I remarked on the amazing lack of narrative in a book about a famous writer. This movie suffers from no such problem; however, some people may have to tax their memories a bit to recall who Babe Palley (wife of CBS chairman William Palley) and Bennett Cerf were in their own time.

Near the end of the film, the Capote character says that an author takes the pain of life and transforms it into art. While there is certainly much art in this film, it seems to reflect reveal much more of the pain which comprises the raw material of the art, while `Capote' does more to celebrate many of the more artistic aspects of the cinematic craft.

This DVD includes a director's voice-over commentary that, for me, easily doubles the value of the DVD. Should you be inclined to own one of these films, I suggest you get both, as they are far closer in quality than the lopsided contest between `Dangerous Liaisons' and `Valmont'.",1171670400,7,4289,4.820652173913044
1570321,4,B00005JPB0,"In an incredible bit of misfortune, 'Infamous' will have to live with the stigma of being 'that other movie' about Truman Capote writing his masterpiece 'In Cold Blood'.  Over time that distinction may begin to wear off, but only time will tell.  The trouble with this situation is that it is impossible to see 2006's 'Infamous' without comparing it to 2005's 'Capote' -- even if you try.  I promised myself that I would attempt to watch it with a fresh perspective, but within ten minutes I had decidedly broken that promise and started a list of differences and similarities in my mind.  What is so unfair about this is that while 'Capote' is a very good movie, 'Infamous' is just a good one, making its faults stand out that much more by comparing it to its predecessor.  Never before has being good not been good enough.

Purists undoubtedly take to 'Capote' as the superior film and lambaste 'Infamous' as a pretender to the throne, but what they are missing out on are the intriguing differences in perspective that the two films have.  It is here that 'Infamous' earns its merits, but also where its defining flaw comes into play: that it is too afraid to risk making Truman an unsympathetic character.  'Capote' gets at the heart of the deviousness inherent in Truman's dealings with Perry Smith and Dick Hickock (the killers on death row whose stories, along with those of their victims, comprise 'In Cold Blood') -- how he used and abused their friendship and trust in order to write his masterpiece.  Philip Seymour Hoffman's Truman Capote is an egotistical liar that sells his soul for his story, made sympathetic by Hoffman's careful portrayal and by the fact that his cruelty causes him to spiral into drink, depression, and ruin for the rest of his life.  The makers of 'Infamous' shy away from this aspect of Capote, choosing to go for sympathy instead.  His deceit is only mentioned in passing -- with the effect that you wouldn't notice it if you weren't looking for it.  This Truman really cares for Perry Smith, and the film posits that what ruined him after the executions was the loss of the one person he had ever truly connected with.  This Truman is a victim of his book's conclusion rather than culpable in it.  It's an interesting theory, but it holds less weight and feels toothless.  I don't know enough about the facts to speculate as to whether or not the sexual tension that develops between the writer and the convict is accurate, but it does add an element of intrigue to the story.

The relationship between Truman and Perry in 'Infamous' adds a layer to the characterization of the author that was missing from 'Capote': that he was really a damaged, insecure man at heart, and had been ever since his childhood.  The bravado, the confidance, the wit, and the eloquence that Manhattan's high society adore him for is a mask that he has put on to hide how he really feels about himself.  His entire personality is an affectation, and his carefully maintained social life is artifice.  Other reviewers have criticized 'Infamous' for being too stylized, but I think that they were trying to show how fake his life in New York was -- and in my humble opinion they succeeded.  Toby Jones' portrayal is, as such, less natural than Hoffman's, but is perfectly suited to this intention of the filmmakers and succeeds in its own right.  Had 'Infamous' come before 'Capote' Jones may have been more recognized for his work with an Oscar nomination of his own, but as I said earlier, timing has not been kind to 'Infamous'.  Anyway, Truman and Perry make a connection because they can be who they really are around each other: Perry can talk about his lonely, abusive childhood and desire to be an artist, while Truman can let his guard down and stop acting like a ""wind-up doll"" (to use a term from the movie).  'Capote' gets at the heart of Truman's duplicity, but 'Infamous' gets at the heart of his insecurity.

The two film's really work as companion pieces, then, so I would encourage everyone to get over their prejudice and look at the two film's as two different sides of one of America's most distinctive voices.  It is fitting that a personality as outsized as Truman Capote's couldn't be captured by only one film, and he would probably be pleased to know that that is the case.",1171670400,168,4315,4.683443708609271
1570322,1,B00005JPB0,"I had seen the incredible Capote, and was looking forward to Infamous as a companion piece. Forget it. This movie comes off as a poorly-made joke.

Infamous has none of the gravitas, humanity or insight seen in the earlier film. What humor it has is without any subtlety, and pops up in the most outrageous places. Characters are weakly introduced and disappear again, leaving only a shallow impression. The actor who plays Capote does look strikingly like him, but interesting enough, Hoffman's Capote was more effective, more real. He worried less about ""the look"", and instead gave a performance of intelligence and fragility, and heart.

Infamous took an ugly and ridiculous turn with the introduction of Perry Smith. This Perry was so over-the-top, especially compared to Clifton Collins' nuanced and heartbreaking portrayal of Smith , that it was almost insulting.

There were just so many bad aspects to this movie that it's hard to touch on them all. From the off-handed capture of the killers, to the bland cinematography, to the inappropriate humor, Infamous is a mess. Stick with the far superior ""Capote"".",1171584000,9,1117,5.092896174863388
1570323,5,B00005JPB0,"INFAMOUS is a brilliant adaptation by writer/director Douglas McGrath of the 'infamous' George Plimpton book 'Truman Capote: In Which Various Friends, Enemies, Acquaintances and Detractors Recall His Turbulent Career'.  What McGrath has gleaned from this resource book is a story that better than any other lets us understand the bizarre personality of Truman Capote (an extraordinary performance by Toby Jones whose films have included The Painted Veil, Elizabeth I, Mrs. Henderson Presents, Finding Neverland, Ladies in Lavender, etc), from his early successes as a writer ('Breakfast at Tiffany's') through his countless acquaintances with the glitterati of the world to his ultimate obsession with the Kansas Clutter family murders that served as the matrix for his final volume 'In Cold Blood' and the demise of his career and life.

McGrath understands Capote's aura and lets us watch it in the early on camera 'interviews' with important people who knew him.  We meet Babe Paley (Sigourney Weaver),  Diana Vreeland (Juliet Stevenson), Gore Vidal (Michael Panes), Slim Keith (Hope Davis), Bennett Cerf (Peter Bogdanovich), Marella Agnelli (Isabella Rossellini), and his longtime partner Jack (John Benjamin Hickey).  Each gives us a vignette of a side of Capote's genius and caricature of genius, but it is not until Capote and Babe sit in a nightclub hearing songstress Kitty Dean (Gweneth Paltrow in a small but surely one of her very finest roles) sing and breakdown in her version of 'What is this thing called love?' that the story itself begins.  From that point on McGrath has a firm handle on the story we all know well.

The Clutter family murder in Kansas in 1959 as a small article in the newspaper captures Capote's eye and imagination: he decides to write an article on the response of the citizens of a small town to the heinous act.  He talks his close friend, novelist Nelle Harper Lee (Sandra Bullock) whose novel 'To Kill a Mockingbird' is all the rage but she is now in writer's block, to accompany him to Kansas to interview the townspeople.  Capote's flamboyant appearance and demeanor and voice are off putting to the townsfolk until Capote and Lee break a barrier with the sheriff (Jeff Daniels) and his wife and become a sought after dinner guest pair.  Then the killers are captured: Dick Hickock (Lee Pace) and Perry Smith (Daniel Craig in one his finest cinematic roles to date), and the flavor of Capote's concept changes dramatically.

Gradually Capote gains access to speaking with the two killers and decides his intended 'article' has become a book. His interviews with both Hickock and Perry feed his imagination and flurry, but it is his bonding with Perry that opens the gates of mutual self confession and shared understanding of not dissimilar backgrounds: Capote and Perry fall in love.  Once the trial is over and the two killers are condemned to hang, Capote returns to Kansas as the victims' invited presence at their hanging: much of what Capote needs to finish his book is dependent on their death and he longs for Perry to ask the world's forgiveness as the pinnacle for his book.

Capote's book is published and becomes an international best seller, but Capote sinks into alcohol, drugs and oblivion until his death.  We are spared all this by McGrath's once again allowing the interviewees to speak, especially the damaged and tender Nelle Harper Lee.  And the film evaporates into myth.

Cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel keenly photographs this inordinately strong cast as well as is the vast landscape of Kansas.  Rachel Portman provides her most original and successful musical score to date to conjure the moodiness of the tale. Toby Jones is magnificent as Truman Capote, delivering the kind of career making performance that comes along only rarely.  This is an intelligent script, well directed, and splendidly executed and deserves at least as much attention as the much lauded CAPOTE that probably prevented the success of INFAMOUS in the theaters.  Highly Recommended.  Grady Harp, February 07",1171497600,2,4054,5.104387291981846
1570324,4,B00005JPB0,"It's a shame that two Capote films came out so closely together, only because many people didn't bother to see this, the second one.  I enjoyed them both and together they give perhaps a fuller picture of this complex person.  I found the performance just as good as the Oscar winning Hoffman performance and again, it's just bad luck for this actor.  I thought Sandra Bullock's Harper Lee was first rate, too.  The difference in the two films, as I saw it, was that Capote showed TC as a monster, who cruelly manipulated Perry Smith for his personal gain, whereas Infamous shows a more vulnerable version of the writer, one who was genuinely moved by the criminal.  I loved the scene where Smith told Capote that he didn't much care for his work because he felt superior to his characters and that it had no kindness...! Perhaps this was his contribution to the heart and soul of Capote because his book In Cold Blood, did show Smith as a bright, highly sympathetic person. Who knows what lurked in the heart of the ""real"" Truman Capote? Which film was closer to the truth? I prefer to believe the latter version, but we don't really know.  In any case, they're both worth seeing.",1167350400,7,1181,4.57345971563981
1570325,5,B00005JPB0,"Probably the best order in which to view the films on this subject is this version first, then last year's, then the Robert Blake movie.

If CAPOTE is a sophisticatedly sec pinot grigio, INFAMOUS is a heartier, fruitier wine.  The power of CAPOTE is its restraint, with the complex central character both monstrous and sympathetic in his cool-eyed pragmatism about needing the killers to die in order to complete his book successfully.  INFAMOUS suggests that Capote is more emotionally torn by this conflict of interests between his attraction to Perry Smith and his ego as a writer.  There's more wallop throughout the more indulgent film, but CAPOTE's refusal to provide easier emotional releases makes it the more mature work.  That said, I'd be more apt to replay this version.

The opening scene, in which Gwyneth Paltrow struggles through the pain behind the lyric she's singing, sets the overall approach of this film.  It is dramatically effective, it's well-played, and it telegraphs both the theme and the somewhat manipulative means this movie will rely upon.  Similarly, the sexual relationship alleged in the prison sequences is carried off by excellent performances, is graphic as fantasy rather than likelihood, and distinguishes CAPOTE's restraint as probably a more honest narrative choice.

The acting and period design are excellent--making favorable comparisons to similar ambitions of the period piece on George Reeves' suicide.  Audiences will appreciate INFAMOUS more if they're aware of the history of Capote's ANSWERED PRAYERS, the gossip fest that exposed the secrets of all his socialite ""swans"" and thus cost him their friendships.

It's interesting that, in all three versions of this existential saga of meaningless virtue and shallow sophisticates, the Perry Smith performance particularly shines.  In this instance, Craig all but steals the film as a Tommy Lee Jones-like hunk, though it must be noted that Segourney Weaver is fantastic at the Twist.

The murders at the eye of this maelstrom are depicted in all three versions of the story, and they remain chilling in each instance.  (My companion at INFAMOUS was enraged, not having seen CAPOTE, that INFAMOUS treated such brutal killers so sympathetically--in Perry's case, as a romantic fantasy--but she acknowledged that this film is excellent.)  Based on the treatments of that central event, I'd recommend seeing the lighter (but not lite) INFAMOUS first, followed by the ascetically satisfying CAPOTE, and then the 1967 Richard Brooks original on the subject.  The reverse order would not do INFAMOUS, well, ""justice.""",1162166400,55,2610,5.3447432762836184
1570326,4,B00005JPB0,"Generally speaking, Douglas McGrath's ""Infamous"" covers the same ground as Bennett Miller's 2005 film ""Capote""--how Truman Capote researched his great non-fiction novel, ""In Cold Blood,"" and how it both made and broke him. But whereas Miller's movie remained austerely focused on the book and what it did to Capote, ""Infamous"" wallows lusciously in the gossipy New York high society Capote swam in like a minnow--or, as Babe Paley and Slim Keith might eventually have said, like a shark. ""Capote"" didn't even depict Paley or Keith; in ""Infamous,"" they're played by a glammed-to-the-nines Sigourney Weaver and Hope Davis, with Peter Bogdanovich and Juliet Stevenson thrown in for good measure as Bennett Cerf and Diana Vreeland. Instead of a wildly transformed Philip Seymour Hoffman, ""Infamous"" stars the British actor Toby Jones, a remarkable physical and facial double for Capote, and plays up the flamboyant aspects of Capote's singular character. And rather than simply emphasizing that Capote was sharply drawn to the murderer Perry Smith, ""Infamous"" asserts that Capote and Smith fell deeply in love with each other. (""Infamous"" underscores the attraction by casting Daniel Craig--the new James Bond, for crying out loud!--as Smith, an extreme contrast to ""Capote's"" physically unprepossessing Clifton Collins Jr.) In most ways, ""Infamous"" measures up fully to ""Capote""--the dialogue and performances are just as convincing. Sandra Bullock's Harper Lee and Jeff Daniels' Alvin Dewey are pretty much equal to Catherine Keener and Chris Cooper's performances in the earlier film. And, if Jones lacks the screen charisma of Hoffman, he makes up for it with a performance that skilfully hits every conceivable emotional note, from laugh-out-loud humor to tearjerking tragedy. (Jones' monologue about his mother's suicide would make stones weep.) Nevertheless, and perhaps inevitably, ""Infamous"" seems slighter and wispier than ""Capote."" Like Tru dishing with Babe Paley at La Cote Basque, it lingers more on the salacious aspects of the story than ""Capote,"" to its comparative detriment. Some viewers, however, may prefer ""Infamous"" to ""Capote"" for it lighter, more colorful tone. In any case, anyone with even the slightest interest in Truman Capote or ""In Cold Blood"" owe it to themselves to see both movies.",1162080000,12,2312,5.497191011235955

I remember seeing the movie with Phillip Seymour Hoffman and was pretty much unimpressed. do I think that this version has some literary license, I'm sure there is but it will not detract from the film at all. If nothing else Truman Capote was an interesting human, he had his own way of looking at things and how they should be done. Toby puts this across. Sandra plays Harper Lee who was a friend of Truman's and she wrote ""To Kill A Mockingbird"". The other amazing performance was turned in by Daniel Craig as one of the 2 killers of the Clutter family.

A good cast, so I liked it alright, and I appreciated that we got to see a bit more of Harper Lee's character... but Toby Jones clearly got the role mostly because of his looks, not his acting chops. He's not even in the same universe as Hoffman. Perhaps because of his less complex interpretation, even the script seems inferior. And maybe it was; it's hard to tell. The Hoffman version does such an exquisite job of balancing Capote's conflicting emotions about the murderers that perhaps it elevates that movie's script. But there are scenes in this one -- particularly when Jones' Capote is bragging about his Hollywood connections -- that don't ring true. Hoffman could pull off a bragging scene and make us believe that admirers' would hang on his words. Jones' version of the same behavior makes it hard to believe listeners in the room would do anything but roll their eyes.

And what about Toby Jones who plays Capote himself? Wow! There is so much quality acting in this movie it's worth it just to watch the characters come alive through the cast. If you have read the book written by Capote, you probably ended up with the opinion that the killers were just stupid guys who did stupid things and killed the Clutter family because they were a couple of aimless drifters who had nothing to lose. And the Clutter family was the local celebrated family of all-stars who could do no wrong. This movie implies a bond between Perry Smith and Capote which develops into an intimate emotional relationship, but does not show the more likely relationship between the two which involved Capote manipulating Perry into giving him the story by his attention.

I have been as close to the Clutter house as you can now, which is not close, but the house isn't brick, and there certainly wasn't a Dollar General Store across from the courthouse in 1959, but those minor mistakes don't take away from the beauty and sadness of this film.

For me, that such a relationship occurred is incidental to the story line. Capote had a helluva time getting Smith to reveal his ""inner being"".",1481241600,,556,4.863157894736842

We never did get an answer to Truman's question: ""Why didn't the caretaker hear rifle fire going off four times in the dead of night - from 100 yards away?""

I didn't bother to see this because, I mistakenly took for granted the overwhelming opinion that ""Capote"" was the better movie. But, today I watched it just for the hell of it and because it had been so long since I'd seen that movie. I am so very pleasantly surprised. ""Capote"" is a more serious movie and I get why some people feel it's better. But, in all honesty I think I prefer ""Infamous"". It is definitely more fun and entertaining in the beginning. There is a nostalgic bent on the art direction. I also think it did a better job showing Truman Capotes light frivolous side. It's very funny in a dry wicked sort of way. Which made it all the more poignant when he finally does get serious in his scenes with Perry (Daniel Craig) where he lets down that false bravado. And then eventually devastating when you see the toll writing this book took on him. Sandra Bullock puts in the most underated performances of her career.

Insight is provided into Dick and Perry's motives and details about their gruesome crime. Details that Capote acquired through many hours of interviews with Perry after gaining his trust.

Infamous has lighthearted moments that make for a less dark, less depressing story. Toby Jones REALLY looks like Capote- PSH has shaped himself into Capote. There is never going to be 100% accuracy of actual events (or characters!) so I would not compare the 2 and fault one or the other. I DO recall PSH being quoted as ""I wouldn't have done this film if it was a biopic""( in words to that effect). I take that to mean that he wanted to interpret Capote as a character- and perhaps not being 100% true to life? One of the things I find most interesting about this film are the ""swans"" as Truman referred to his society ladies. The portrayals are so terribly wonderful, as we love these style icons and they are so lovingly and accurately portrayed (within reason). And the period couture- well!

1570882,3,B00005JPB0,"I'm reading ""In Cold Blood"" at the moment, so I watched this back-to-back with ""Capote.""

A few things... I liked Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of TC in ""Capote"" better than Jones' in this movie.  PSH played him with the right amount of subtlety, while Jones plays him more as a prissy queen sashaying his way through the Kansas prairie.  Perhaps the true story of how it really happened lies somewhere in between.

I thought this movie did a better job showing the complexity of Capote's friendship with Harper Lee.  In my opinion, Sandra Bullock was more memorable than Catherine Keener.

The Capote-Perry Smith love story seemed a little contrived and embellished.  Did it really happen this way, or the way it was shown in ""Capote""?  Maybe it was somewhere in between.  We will probably never know for sure, since Capote had a reputation for embellishment.

I would still recommend ""Infamous"" if you're a Truman Capote fan, but I preferred ""Capote"" over this one.",1431907200,,972,4.9079754601226995
1570883,4,B00005JPB0,"It is a shame that INFAMOUS (2006) is more often than not compared to CAPOTE (2005), the Philip Seymour vehicle, as the Toby Jones version of 2005 is an often brilliant, always fascinating, effort. As I have not as yet seen CAPOTE, I feel I can write this review without any comparisons, invidious or otherwise, to the movie in question.

Told mostly in flashbacks and 'present day' interviews, INFAMOUS presents a detailed look at the effects of the Clutter family murder in Kansas on November 14, 1959, famously covered by Truman Capote in his book IN COLD BLOOD. The movie goes back and forth between Capote's life in New York City and his efforts at a new type of reportage in Kansas where the facts of the murder will be told but with the characters appearing as in a novel. Not fiction, yet not quite the absolute truth -- call it embroidered truth if you will. Capote goes to Kansas, accompanied by Harper Lee (Sandra Bullock), intending to see how the locals are reacting to a murder in their close-knit midst (before the murderers Perry Smith and Dick Hickock are tracked down). When the killers are caught, Capote finds himself drawn into their lives, particularly Perry Smith. Their capture forces to change the direction of his intended book.

This is where INFAMOUS takes on its Rashomon-like characteristics. Not only in Kansas, but also back in New York, the audience is confronted by varying versions of the truth from Capote, Perry Smith (Daniel Craig), and Capote's socialite friends in New York. Were Capote and Smith involved in what can only be described as a romance? When Smith is talking to the camera, is he genuine or is he a master manipulator? How are his perceived sensitivity and violent outbursts reconciled? When Capote is dishing with his harem of socialites, the viewer is led to believe that he is the only serial liar in his circle but as the others in his circle are being interviewed, are they displaying equal skill as liars? As in RASHOMON, whose version of the truth is valid?  But unlike in the Japanese masterpiece, there is no medium to give us the Clutters' story.

Ably supported by Sandra Bullock and Daniel Craig, Toby Jones is brilliant. He brings depth and credibility to his portrayal of Capote as social butterfly, tenacious writer and, yes, sensitive and caring person. Jones bears an uncanny resemblance to the post-youthful man who still retained a certain measure of attractiveness, physical and mental, before he became the dissipated nasty piece of goods 'as seen on TV' on the old talk shows. It is worth mentioning that Daniel Craig is extremely effective in his portrayal of Perry Smith: he almost makes the viewer forget that his character was involved in a particularly horrible crime. Almost.

Toby Jones alone is justification enough to watch INFAMOUS. But also consider the attractions of Sandra Bullock, Daniel Craig, and Sigourney Weaver. Also look for Isabella Rossellini as one of Capote's friends: I don't know from fashion, but she wears one of the worst outfits I've ever seen, reminding me nothing so much as a white-flocked Christmas tree. Okay, that last was nasty of me, but it IS just one example of the little details that also make this movie eminently watchable. I rate this film 4 1/2 stars.",1431561600,,3273,4.8375

1570983,5,B00005JPB0,"I watched ""Infamous"" yesterday and ""Capote"" today in order to compare the two movies. Each tells the same story in a slightly different way: how Truman Capote wrote his greatest book: In Cold Blood. While ""Capote"" was a fine movie, it takes a back seat to ""Infamous"". ""Capote"" has sedate timing, some might uncharitably call it boring, the pace drags. ""Infamous"" has a crisper pace, and we don't spend as much time appreciating bleak Kansas winter landscapes.

In my opinion, the actors playing the characters in ""Infamous"" are better in those roles. Toby Jones is a shorter, funnier, more flamboyant, more believable Truman Capote than the brooding, unfunny late Philip Seymour Hoffman. Daniel Craig as the killer Perry Smith emits both a subtle intelligence and hidden menace which Clifton Collins never projects. Both actors present a heartrending portrait of their character's broken soul rooted in a lonely and abusive childhood. And since I really love Sandra Bullock in anything, she wins as Harper Lee (sorry Catherine Keener).

Both movies have a ""with commentary"" option; in fact, ""Capote"" has two. The ""Capote"" commentaries are the typical useless banter I've come to expect from these special features. ""Oh, look at that scene, I love the colors!"" ""Yes, I remember, how cold it was that day and I forgot my scarf in the trailer"" Yada, yada, yawn. Who gives a rat's ass?

In contrast, the fascinating and informative commentary which ""Infamous"" director Douglas McGrath's provided just about floored me. He had clearly researched his subject matter and offered an encyclopedia of background information and psychological insights into the characters. Since his words drown out 90% of the dialogue, you have to first watch the movie, then watch it again with the director's commentary. It will not be a waste of two hours; I guarantee you`ll get twice as much out of this movie.",1427414400,2,1888,5.083870967741936

1571165,3,B00005JPB0,"I wanted to see this to compare to ""Capote"" which I thought was very dry, so dry I knew I would never watch it again, and  I donated it to the library. Philip Seymour Hoffman was also way too tall for Capote, and I never felt that he ""was"" Capote.

This film goes more into his gossip and lunches with Capote's swans (Babe Paley, Slim Keith), his defense of his writing, his shallowness. Toby Jones is much more realistic as Capote, especially since I never heard of Toby Jones. Sandra Bullock was wasted in the small part of Harper Lee. Daniel Craig was totally WRONG for the part of Perry Smith. He also was too tall for the character. He did an excellent job of acting, but the lines were not real. There was a studied phoniness in this Perry Smith. And when he said, ""...when that went away..."" referring to his parents' rodeo jobs, it irritated me and completely brought me out of the movie. People did not say things ""went away"" or ""will go away"" back then. Things ended or were over. They stopped. They were finished. They didn't just wander away, off somewhere....

And when Perry and Truman start making out, they lost me there. My gut tells me that didn't happen. They are trying to lean this into Perry being gay: not letting the girl be raped, putting a pillow under the boy's head, not liking pornography. But even if he was gay, I don't think he'd start kissing Truman Capote in his cell in full view of the guard and the inmates across the way. He'd also be afraid of Truman putting it in his book!

The film lets you know that Capote was sensitive (oh, how he felt for Kitty Dean when she stopped singing at El Morocco - what was that about anyway?), but also a liar. He had a really bad childhood; Perry Smith had a really horrible childhood. So they had that in common and could become kindred spirits. The townspeople are so shallow that once they hear that Truman knows famous movie stars, they invite him to their homes to hear his stories. He's like Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer - no longer an outsider, he can play reindeer games with the other reindeer.

The film was interesting as it went along, but it did not go anywhere that it really went in real life. I still did not care anything about the murderers, and don't know why anyone would. I thought the one-sided responses of various people who knew Truman, speaking about Truman (Jack Dunphy, Harper Lee, etc). were unnecessary and distracting. I guess they had to throw the George Plimpton interview technique in there.

Also, Diana Vreeland did NOT have enough lipstick on.",1410220800,2,2556,4.486021505376344

1571222,4,B00005JPB0,"Not a bad film considering it was on the foot of the previous award winning film 'Capote'. 'Infamous' has all the incidental drama the  screenwriters of 'Capote' avoided. If you like a TV movie drama - this one is fine. Toby Jones over-plays Capote's voice - it's almost a parody. Bullock is a convincing and indifferent Harper Lee - it is she who is Jones's safety net in sustaining a passable 'Truman Capote'. The film is close to Truman Capote's book 'In Cold Blood' but only in some passages  (though a particular scene with Perry Smith and Truman Capote in the prison cell was I felt, far fetched and highly unlikely to have ever taken place) perhaps this was screen writers taking advantage of their 'artistic licence'. My final opinion on 'Infamous' is on the filmakers themselves, they ought never forget the extreme value and importance of gathering all historical facts relevant to their subject - otherwise you would not have people like me discovering that, in Perry Smith's prison cell was an acoustic guitar leaning against a wall, of course it was meant to be his beloved old Gibson, who, as anyone who has read 'In Cold Blood' will know, was stolen  from a cheap hotel in which he and Dick were staying ....... long before the Clutters were murdered.",1404172800,,1266,4.719457013574661
1571223,5,B00005JPB0,"Though ""Infamous"" is invariably compared to ""Capote"" (starring Philip Seymour Hoffmann and released the year before), there is room for both films to co-exist as each takes such a different approach to the story. Infamous depicts Capote with all his simpering ways and gossiping airs, but also reveals his basic insecurity and how he struggled to achieve relevance and meaningful relationships. The oddly symbiotic relationship that evolved between Capote and the killer, Perry Smith, is at times heartwarming and at other times almost painful and embarrassing to watch.

I couldn't picture Sandra Bullock as Harper Lee initially, but she also grew to inhabit the role of the straight-talking, plain-looking and pragmatic author - before she became famous for her singular work - To Kill a Mockingbird. She was just a friend and accomplice to Capote, occasionally setting him straight when he seemed to be veering too far off course with his quest to find the human story in the Kansas killings. They are the ultimate ""odd couple"", but each scene in which they both appear is lively and interesting and compelling.

Daniel Craig as Perry Smith was almost unrecognizable. At first, I wasn't certain it was him because of his darkened hair and eyebrows and brown contact lenses which obscured his bright blue eyes. His raw animal strength and magnetism simply stole every scene in which he appears. It's easy to see why Capote was sucked up into his energy field and fell for him. Who knows whether he really resembled the real-life Perry, but the character he portrayed was complex and compelling.

The film sets veer from stark gray scenes in the prison to the sumptuous dining rooms of the New York City social scene inhabited by Capote. The re-enactment at the Kansas farmhouse where the Clutter family was murdered is unflinchingly gruesome. This is first rate entertainment, and has inspired me to re-watch ""Capote"" and re-read ""In Cold Blood"".

They are both fine movies and both show Capote's personality and how Capote, a very gay man who wore incredibly flamboyant clothes and had a high voice, was befriended by 1950s Kansas law enforcement officers and the residents of a small Kansas town.  That in itself was an incredible achievement.
Also interesting is the fact that Capote and his research assistant, Harper Lee, author of To Kill a Mockingbird, never completed another serious work.  Both became rich from their most important books.  Capote drank himself to death and Lee still is alive as a recluse.

This movie covers the same ground as ""Capote"" (the years in which the writing of In Cold Blood wiped out Capote's world) but does it with more intensity and more of a focus on the love between Capote and Perry Smith.

Sandra Bullock's transformation into dowdy but totally loyal friend NELLE was complete.  Jeff Daniels gave a short memorable performance as sheriff(?) Dewey "" FOXY "" who had come to quietly appreciate Capote's intelligence & wit.  Don't get lost in the doom & gloom of this film: There are some genuine funny scenes to have a watchful eye for --- don't miss them!  Mostly in relation to Truman disarming friends & strangers alike with his naturally charming self.  The real life Truman Capote is portrayed living in many worlds at once: Upper West Side Manhattan amongst famous & wealthy women & taking in meals at a diner with his working class gossipy friends.  Capote was born and raised in small town America so pursuing this new blockbuster murder story was like going home to him.

Daniel Craig totally DELIVERS as a doomed repressed homicidal inmate who emotionally connects with Capote during prison visits for his book research.  How does one write a book of redemption for a duo of ex-convicts who kill an entire family during a home invasion ?  Capote grapples with balancing their heinous crime w/ compassion regarding their tragic childhoods.  He reminds Perry Smith the book he's writing will be his only opportunity to speak his truth for the public to consider AFTER HE'S EXECUTED: Use this chance to appear less monstrous and more human.  Capote's consistent coaxing works - the pair speak freely about everything Capote ask and the book is written.  Capote invest 5 YEARS maintaining a relationship with this doomed duo as appeals are exhausted and their execution is finally carried out.  This emotional roller coaster proved to be far more of an investment than even Capote imagined.  Struggle though he did ... recovery proved to be impossible for him.

I've gained great compassion for everyone involved in this tragic true life tale.

1571573,4,B00005JPB0,"One of the key moments in this filmed account of the researching and writing of Truman Capote's IN COLD BLOOD occurs when Capote (Toby Jones) sends copies of his previous books to Leavenworth for the benefit of one of his great nonfiction novel's subjects, Perry Smith (Daniel Craig), one of the murderers of the rural Kansas Clutter family. Smith writes back to Capote that the books ""lack kindness"" in their treatment of their characters; though Capote is bewildered by such criticism from ""a four-time killer,"" we are later told by his great friend, Harper Lee (Sandra Bullock), that when Capote drafted IN COLD BLOOD he included kindness in to the text this time. The achievement of Douglas McGrath's 2006 INFAMOUS is its restoration of kindness to the story of how Capote both made his fortune and ruined his emotional health through the writing of IN COLD BLOOD, a subject that the much more critically lauded film from the year before, Bennett Miller's CAPOTE, treated much more coldly: in that other film, Philip Seymour Hoffman played Capote almost as a sociopath, willfully blinding himself to the cruelties he inflicted upon those around him. Toby Jones, who actually looks more like Capote than Hoffman does, emphasizes the writer's sweetness: though he first appears in Holcomb, Kansas like some sort of exotic animal, he gradually wins the townspeople's confidences by his amusing worldliness and great charm. This film also humanizes Capote more fully by depicting his emotional investment in his ""swans,"" Capote's famous, elegant society friends he courted throughout most of his adult life: perhaps the stunt casting of several well-known actresses (Sigourney Weaver, Isabella Rossellini, Hope Davis and Juliet Stevenson) hurt the film's reputation, although hey are fun to see, and Weaver (in particular) does a fine job as the sweet and trusting beauty Babe Paley.

Although McGrath gets so much right with this film, he missteps in the film's treatment of Perry Smith. Daniel Craig, who works extremely hard in his miscast role, is just too tall and hunky to be a believable Perry Smith; and when McGrath postulates both Smith's violent attack on Capote in his cell (when he believes Capote has sold him out) and a love scene between the two men, he may be following in Capote's footsteps by mixing fact with fiction, but he makes the tone of the film go all wrong. There's also a misconceived attempt to have Capote's associates offer commentary on the story seemingly after the events and Capote's death in 1984 (though the commentators do not appear to have aged, and Babe Paley's presence among them makes no sense whatsoever given her death in 1978). It does allow for some nice moments for Sandra Bullock, who does her best character work in years as the patient and forgiving Harper Lee.",1372982400,,2814,5.012820512820513
1571574,5,B00005JPB0,I recommend this movie to all.  Wonderful family movie for those who do not judge and for those who have open minds.,1371945600,,116,4.2727272727272725
1571653,5,B00005JPB0,"I understand that there was an earlier movie with same title and subject about which I have no knowledge and am not comparing.

  In any case, this movie is about the writer Truman Capote and is connected with his book ""In Cold Blood"". It is well directed and acted by competent professionals, and is worth your time if you are at all interested in the other respected NY City arts, literature and humor professionals of the 50's era who are introduced. They are presented (what can I say) in less serious moments of their careers. Comments made on camera, out of context, I suppose were taken from their own writings.

  The main focus of the movie is on a notorious murder committed in Kansas in 1959, but is not a remake of an earlier movie (1967, remade in 1996) with the same title as the book. That movie focused on the crime, the police investigation and the arrest of the criminals, and alleged that the criminals murdered the victims immediately and then spent some time searching for hidden money, of which there was none.

  By contrast, this movie is a biographical sketch of the author and his own personal investigation of the crime, along with his own attitudes, interests and observations at the crime scene, and finally, his interviews with the killers.

  I must break here and disclaim any direct knowledge of the characters and events themselves or of the author, director, or actors, or the book, and state that I am only discussing the movie and what the movie states directly or reasonably implies. If the movie misrepresented any of the above, then the offended parties should long ago have made claims against the movie's producers. If you, the reader, enjoyed the movie and had no questions, forget the rest of this review.

  The above is said because, to say it plainly, the movie is a study in Sadomasochism (consult the dictionary definition).

  Thus the author's interest (as it appears) is in vicariously experiencing the suffering of the victims; not in the killings themselves, but in details such as the distribution of blood shed (even a single speck), as if the killers were some kind of artists; and in undisturbed minutia of the victims household.  Likewise the author's interest in the killers was not in their plans (they had none) or their motive (nothing was taken). Their motive (as it appears) was only in the tormenting of victims, called sadism.

  The interviews with the criminals further brings out the absence of repentance, their disregard for their coming execution, and the authors masochistic desire to experience personal contact with and, at the end, physical abuse by the killers.

  In the final scene the author specifically states that the title ""In Cold Blood"" does not refer to the murders, but to the execution of the criminals.

  The good people of Kansas were gracious to the author during his stay, treating his life style and affectations as a novelty.

PS. The first scene, in which a professional actress flubs a song and breaks down crying, must be some kind of insider detail, known only by New York celebrities.  Forget it.",1371340800,3,3098,4.8125
1571654,3,B00005JPB0,"I have been fascinated by Truman Capote's life ever since I found out that the character of Dill in Harper Lee's 'To Kill a Mockingbird' was based on him as a child. I watched In Cold Blood the night before I watched this movie because I'd never seen it and because I wanted the ""back story"". Well, I must say I enjoyed the first much more than this one. I think Toby Jones did a wonderful impersonation of Truman Capote but it's little more than that. For all his rubbing his face and whining about how much the research for his book took out of him, I wasn't convinced. I think TC's was a truly tragic story of a truly tragic little man but this movie shed no further light on him or his life than that which I had already known. Sandra Bullock also does a very fine impersonation of Harper Lee but again, it's little more than that. I guess you'd have to blame the writing or direction, (I don't claim to be a film critic), because Ms Bullock can certainly make you feel like you know the character she's playing in most of her better movies. It's a shame too because Harper Lee is a somewhat tragic figure, as well. In conclusion let me recommend that you read about the lives of Truman Capote AND Harper Lee if you want to know something about their fascinating lives and careers, (Harper Lee is still alive and living almost as a recluse in Monroeville, Al), because you won't learn much from this movie.",1371081600,2,1410,4.34469696969697

1571657,5,B00005JPB0,"My review is not a comparison of this film versus the other films, books and real life history of these people. I judge this film simply on its own merit. I wasn't expecting very much when I sat down to watch it, which is one of the reasons it has taken me years to get around to viewing it.
There are great actors and performances in it, of course, but when there are a great many celebrities in a piece, and they are portraying real people-- well, the results are often overhyped, and ultimately, lackluster. And even when there are great performances from actors, a movie can be awful, because their efforts are dependent on the talent and vision of countless others in order for the final production to succeed in its aims.
However, Infamous does not disappoint. This film draws you in with its stillness and, as it progresses, you find each and every character's words and movements more and more compelling. It's a rare feat to find a director who can showcase great actors so well and build a world for them to inhabit, completely and effortlessly. The audience forgets about things such as James Bond and exists, for a time, in only this story.",1369612800,,1152,4.570048309178744

I will not dispute his character is overacted and possibly played for laughs from time to time, but, for the fact that its attempts to deal with Capote's interaction with the two murderers in order to write his ""reportage"" novel, are more truthful to what might have caused the gay author to gradually withdraw from life.  Also, several of the supporting characters are portrayed as lovingly ""eccentric"", It's not perfect but it beats the other one by far. Kudo's Hollywood.",1360540800,,737,4.888
1571780,5,B00005JPB0,"Technically, the film is based on George Plimpton's oral history of Capote, in which those who
knew, loved, and hated him comment on him from every conceivable angle. So, as in the book, we
get his ""swans,"" his publisher, his lifelong companion, and so on speaking directly to us. But
in fact writer-director McGrath made this film out of his belief that Capote gave up so much of
himself in his writing--and too much in creating In Cold Blood--that he couldn't survive it. Watch
the breakdown of the singer (Gwyneth Paltrow) in the beginning. What does that say about the
difficulty of communication in art? And what's the song she's singing? ""What Is This Thing Called
Love?""--by Cole Porter, another artist who greatly suffered and eventually committed slow suicide
through alcoholism, rather as Capote did. In particular, the film's treatment of the relationship
between Capote and one of the killers, played by Daniel Craig before he became famous as James
Bond, makes this an outstanding film about the relationship between the artist and his subject.
And don't miss the commentary track (by McGrath). It's fast-moving, fascinating, and really, really
smart, just like this movie.",1359504000,,1186,5.118556701030927
1571781,5,B00005JPB0,"Infamous is a 2006 American drama film based on the 1997 book by George Plimpton, Truman Capote: In Which Various Friends, Enemies, Acquaintances, and Detractors Recall His Turbulent Career.

It covers the period from the late 1950s through the mid-1960s, during which Truman Capote researched and wrote his bestseller In Cold Blood, a subject covered a year earlier in the film Capote. Capote is played by Toby Jones. The same role in the previous film version earned an Academy Award for actor Philip Seymour Hoffman.

In his review in the New York Times, A.O. Scott called the film ""well worth your attention. It is quick-witted, stylish and well acted... warmer and more tender, if also a bit thinner and showier, than Capote... it is in the end more touching than troubling.""

Rex Reed of The New York Observer opined, ""They gave the Oscar to the wrong Truman Capote. I do not begrudge the versatile, popular Philip Seymour Hoffman his Oscar for playing the tiny terror in Capote, but he was doing an impression. In Infamous . . . a diminutive actor with a titanic talent named Toby Jones literally becomes the man himself. This is no lisping impersonation learned from watching old Johnny Carson shows: Mr. Jones moves into Truman's skin, heart and brains. Infamous shows you the man's soul. It is a monumental achievement of great artistry and depth. In some ways, the movie is better, too . . . [it] is infinitely fascinating, cinematically breathtaking and largely impeccable. It proves that there's more than one way to tell a story and view a life. It is one hell of a beautiful movie to see and savor.""

I'm not sure, though, that this film doesn't stray further from the facts of criminal aspects of the case, my recollection is that it does.",1358553600,,530,5.0227272727272725
1571783,5,B00005JPB0,"A terrific film, and a huge surprise.

I am currently reading ""In Cold Blood.""  I bought it two or three years ago for the Kindle, started to read, but was sidetracked.  While I was probably half way through the last time -- I am on the last 30 pages this time -- I realized that I needed to start from the beginning again as I had forgotten so much about the book.  While the novel has some issues, it is a terrific read.

I have also seen the film ""In Cold Blood,"" which I really liked, and watched ""Capote"" several years ago.  I liked both of those films, and after watching Philip Seymour Hoffman in the latter version, I thought to myself, ""I will never see a better interpretation of Truman Capote.  EVER.""  Boy, was I wrong.

No disrespect to Mr. Hoffman, but Toby Jones just absolutely nails it here.  While Mr. Hoffman was very accurate with Mr. Capote's voice, Mr. Jones one ups him by accurately portraying the mannerisms -- and psyche -- of Mr. Capote.  I was literally blown away by Mr. Jones' performance here, especially after I read quite a bit of side material about how the townspeople of Holcomb actually felt about Mr. Capote.  (Most of them, to this day, didn't like the famous writer.  I can see both sides of this issue myself, and it would require too many pages of writing to say why.)  But I believe that Mr. Hoffman was surprisingly somewhat sabotaged by the writing and direction in ""Capote.""  While it was really good, they were afraid to take risks.  The writer and director were not afraid to take those same risks here, and there is a huge payoff because of it.  Suffice it to say that the interaction between the Capote character and one of the killers is chilling and realistic.  (And by the way:  casting Daniel Craig was a truly inspired choice here.)

If you liked ""Capote"" you will love ""Infamous.""  While the former is more famous than the latter, it should have been the other way around.  A huge recommendation for this underrated film!",1357776000,3,1977,4.509859154929577
1571784,5,B00005JPB0,This stellar cast is amazing to watch.  Toby Jones embodies Truman Capote throughout the entire movie.  It's really unfortunate that this movie came out in the shadow of Capote because it is a far superior film in every way.,1357603200,,224,4.717948717948718
1571785,4,B00005JPB0,"I agree this film is superior to ""Capote"", however I will not feel sorry for the killers no matter how many versions I watch. This film certainly portrays Truman Capote much better than the the one with his name attached. Yes you do sort of feel as if he was playing himself, it is that good. I give it four stars instead of five because of the time spent on the Perry character, and the effort to make him seem almost human. There is no way I can see either killer as human when they brutally murdered an entire family. I don't care about his childhood, nor do I care to study why he may have evolved into a cold blooded individual. In some ways, it almost makes the farmer deserving of his fate for not having the supposed safe with cash on the premises. Further, it almost seems like he was doing them a favor by worrying about the son getting cold, or placing a pillow behind his head before the he was shot. Then both killers cry at the hanging, which does not move me at all, except to think about if they had not committed this brutal crime, nobody would be feeling bad. It's just that unnecessary to have killed this family. I believe the punishment fit the crime, although I am never a fan of seeing another human being die. I suppose you could call it artistic license to think Capote may have fell in love with the Perry guy, but it also could be another example of doing this because Capote was gay. That does not mean he had to fall for the guy, any more than a heterosexual man would. All in all, it is a very good portrayal of Truman Capote. The killers will always be just that in my book. Not deserving of any extra attention, or sympathy. Save that for the very real victims of this crime.",1357430400,,1707,4.2392638036809815

Toby Jones as Capote is terrific, showing the charm that made this rather odd creature the magnet he was, and Sandra Bullock gives her most mature performance ever.  Jeff Daniels and Daniel Craig, yes, Daniel Craig, are terrific.

The same applied in the storylines, 'Capote' being subtle and low-key, and 'Infamous' being whimsical and much more innuendo.

1571844,3,B00005JPB0,"Leave it to Hollywood to get two depressing movies out of one novel. This movie is the story of Truman Capote (brilliantly played by Toby Jones) and how ""In Cold Blood"" was written.

It also makes some of the reasons clear why Capote called his book a novel, not straight reporting. He put words in people's mouths, words that mattered to the story. For example, ""In Cold Blood"" says that Perry tried to apologize before he died; that his last words were ""I'd like to apologize, but I don't know who to apologize to."" But ""Infamous"" quotes the DA on the case that Perry never said a word, he just chewed his gum. However, Capote suggested his last words to him, and so wrote in the book that Perry said what he suggested he say.

Harper Lee (real name Nell) was Capote's friend from childhood. Capote was that scrawny little boy who lived next door in ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" So when Truman decided to go to Kansas and talk to people, Nell went along with him. Truman was trying to get a magazine article out of the murders as about how the town felt, the way they reacted to such a brutal, apparently motiveless murder. But people thought he was odd (queer? eccentric?), and wouldn't talk to him until one kind lady invited him to her home for Christmas, referring to Nell as ""Mrs. Capote."" They accepted, and when Truman started name-dropping about all the famous people he knew, they thawed out.

Then the killers were captured, and Capote realized this was going to be a book, not just a magazine article. Dick agreed to talk to him as soon as Truman offered to send a share of the royalties to Dick's kids by his first marriage. But Perry had no family to care about the money, and he held out until Truman's persistence and sympathy convinced him to open up. After that, he was ""friend Truman,"" and Perry wrote two letters to him every week for the five years during which his appeal was going through the courts. When the appeals were all denied, he asked Capote to attend the hanging.

It was the hardest thing he had ever done. They hung Dick first, and the executioner kept checking for a heart beat with a stethoscope. It took him some 40 minutes to die. When Perry was on the gallows and the executioner put a black bag over his head, Truman could bear it no longer, and ran out of the execution room (really a warehouse or barn structure) rather than witness the final moments.

Truman Capote never wrote a significant work after that. He simply compiled and edited his earlier short works into books.",1337385600,3,2515,4.4945295404814
1571845,5,B00005JPB0,"I have always preferred INFAMOUS over CAPOTE for so many reasons.  While both Toby and Hoffman did a wonderful job on the portrayal, Toby's is just a bit more ""spot on"" for the character, you really do feel like it is Capote.  This film, coming out after CAPOTE, never really garnished the praise it deserved.  First off CAPOTE only has Hoffman and Chris Cooper who have any box office notoriety. INFAMOUS has Bullock, Weaver, Rossalini, Craig, Daniels even Paltrow and all perform their respective rolls with utter believability.  The film does not take itself too seriously, and breaks the morbidity of the subject matter with some humor and even glorious early 60s NYC society scenes.  It makes for a great contrast between that and the stark dark world of Kansas and the tragedy which has unfolded. Even some of the ""non factual"" scenes add cadence to the story and make draws you in much more than CAPOTE, which I felt was too biopic and at times way too boring.  The story line for both and the outcome for both remain the same, that does not change. But INFAMOUS, I feel gives us a much better insight into Truman as a person both before he began his project, and what his life became after it was completed.",1336003200,4,1215,4.601851851851852

This film is superior to CAPOTE in these respects: Toby Jones is the reincarnation of Capote in height, face and voice. Watch this man for 30 seconds and you'll forget it's an actor and not Capote himself. He's THAT good! Also, an outstanding supporting cast that features Sandra Bullock as Harper Lee, Sigourney Weaver as Babe Paley and Gwyneth Paltrow as nighclub singer Kitty Dean (Paltrow is fabulous!). Finally, there's Jeff Daniels as Kansas investigator Al Dewey, Isabella Rossellini as Marella Agnelli, and almost as amazing as Jones, Peter Bogdonovich is the spittin' image of publisher/writer Bennett Cerf. (Who knew Bog could act?)

INFAMOUS isn't perfect of course. There's a refusal to paint Capote as a back-stabbing friendship destroyer (as gigantic Philip Hoffman did so well in his Oscar-winning turn), although we do see an incident of mischievous gossiping. The script also injects some arguably superfluous man love (both tender and violent) into the story. It's clear that Tru's loyalty to Perry Smith prevents his total honesty, yet no mention is made that Smith probably killed all four victims, which varies from Capote's ultimate book description and crime scenario as depicted here. Finally, Tru's obsession over Smith and resultant alcoholic dissipation after the murderer's hanging is a P.S.ed afterthought.

Nonetheless, Toby Jones IS Truman Capote, and no matter any differences or similarities to the previous year's Hoffman turn, this one stands on its own as a darn good movie! Highly recommended.",1330387200,,2096,6.146757679180888
1571847,4,B00005JPB0,"Surely an Oscar was due to TOBY JONES for his central performance in ""Infamous""? And Daniel Craig too - menacing, sexy, intoxicating - you can see why this guy will pull off the lethal double-whammy - Bond for the boys - but films like ""Defiance"", ""The Mother"" and ""Flashbacks Of A Fool"" for challenging roles and acting chops.

The story begins with much of the cast narrating their thoughts on Truman Capote via interview to the camera. They discuss with dispassion this odd little American writer who was also a world-class raconteur and smoozer. Particularly good are Juliet Stevenson as the socialite and Sandra Bullock as Harper Lee (author of ""To Kill A Mockingbird"").

The story begins with Truman seeing a story in a newspaper about a family wiped out in small town America. He is drawn to it without really knowing why. He and Bullock travel to the town, but are stumped by paperwork. The town sheriff (downplayed subtly and beautifully by Jeff Daniels) won't play ball and allow either access to anything to do with the case. So Truman does what he does best - he wheedles his way into the sheriff's family and their affections with his charm and tales of famous folks (a trick he uses in the interviews in jail). Then the real murderers get caught and Truman gets stuck in on both of them knowing that these scumbags want their sordid stories told. And on it goes...

The support cast is uniformly superb too - Sigourney Weaver, Hope Davis, Isabella Rossellini and Gwyneth Paltrow - all actresses of real talent and power.

""Infamous"" made me like a man who some would say was superfluous to Humanity's requirements - a person who tested your patience - who was outside the norm - but used his wit, intelligence and verbal cunning to rise above the ridicule he so often evoked.

""Infamous"" is a thought-provoking story about a complex, clever, irritating, pretentious and ultimately fascinating person - a tale added to by the central performance - and not dominated by it (as Phillip Seymour Hoffman did in the more lauded ""Capote"" movie).

I thought it was a fantastic film - and with a great cast delivering on all fronts.

Highly recommended (and roll on the BLU RAY reissue).",1326326400,11,2192,4.73753280839895
1571898,4,B00005JPB0,"Having just read In Cold Blood for the first time and having already seen (Capote) years ago, I stumbled across this film and decided to watch it instead of rewatching Capote. I was really taken in by the opening of the film. The acting is exquisite (but frankly not as convincing as Capote). Certain portions are very funny.

The beginning and end contain ""documentary style"" interviews which just frankly didn't work for me. On a whole the movie works. It's touching. It's poignant. As a historian and as a writer, there were elements of it I found fascinating. That said, there were little inconsistencies that I found rather annoying. For example, the book makes clear how a crowd had gathered when Smith and Hickock are being brought to the jail. They were late and there was worry (unduly) that there might be a lynch mob. However in the movie it shows people running toward the police station in broad daylight as though it were an ad hoc event. Worse, Perry Smith's portrayal of his childhood relationship is significantly off. The way they show him next to ""Andy"" prior to the trial is off. Perry was kept alone in the woman's quarters of the local prison until after the trial. Showing Dick pulling the trigger on the women was eventually contradicted even in the book. There are others and they're fairly major points.

So it was enjoyable and touching. I feel this movie brings out more of a way Truman Capote must have been. A born storyteller. Someone who got people's confidences. The movie shows how he did it...even better in certain ways than Capote did. The acting performances in Capote are, however, more genuine. Because of the timing and its lack of panache, this movie is destined to be the ""Wyatt Earp"" to ""Tombstone"".

It's still definitely worth a watch.",1324512000,,1781,4.7387096774193544

1571901,4,B00005JPB0,"""In cold blood"" is a masterpiece. Never before a murder had the focus of a genius writer in such a way that led to brilliant ""reportage"". Many things were written and several movies focused on the murders and, recently, on the writer - the eclectic, socialite and excentric genius Truman Capote.

This is one of them, and you will not want to miss it. Toby Jones is an excellent actor and it's impossible to distinguish him from the real thing! With a deluxe set of supporting cast, including Sandra Bullock, Daniel Craig, Jeff Bridges and Sigourney Weaver, you have everything to make a very good movie, and the director didn't disapointed the audience.

Obviously the ""Capote"" movie stole almost all the glory this very good film could get. If ""Infamous"" had went to the theaters in 2004 probably most people knew this movie and most would had never heard of ""Capote"", although it is also a great work!

This film is somewhat humorous, although not light and quite dramatic in several moments; it focus on the past life of both the assassin Perry Smith and the writer investigator Truman Capote, and the events that led them to their present situation, demeanor and way of thinking. Also the manipulative aspect of Truman ain't forgot nor the masterful way he gossips and gathers information. Also another brilliant aspect of this movie is the interaction with the locals and the fascinating charisma of the character in social events (even in the country) - a must see.

The romantic aspect between Truman and Perry is also much more relevant in this film, and also the ""interpretation"" of the authors downfall. There is a clear intention to show more humane facets of Perry and Capote then other works.

Thus begins this movie, which, like the previous one,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Capote/dp/B000E33VWW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Capote</a>, focuses on Truman's attempts to ingratiate himself enough with the townspeople to earn admittance into their thoughts and feelings.

In the process, Truman Capote becomes so involved with one of the killers, Perry Smith (Daniel Craig), that he almost becomes part of the story.

At the end, after the hangings and after the book has exceeded every expectation, it's almost as though all of their lives are but an epilogue to the main event.

Narrating at the conclusion, the character Harper Lee comments that, in America, there is no attention paid to the ""small"" moments in your artistic life; instead, after the success, everyone asks, as only Americans can:  ""What's next?""

This comment seemed so poignant, considering that, despite the success that still surrounds&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/To-Kill-a-Mockingbird-Harper-Perennial-Modern-Classics/dp/0061120081/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">To Kill a Mockingbird (Harper Perennial Modern Classics)</a>, this book was the main event for Harper Lee as well.

The actors left their intriguing marks on the characters, adding a depth and humanity--even on the criminals--and also gave us a peek into the thoughts and feelings of the writers who turned the human moments into art.

While I enjoyed this movie, I was disappointed that Harper Lee was portrayed as a footnote to Truman (or a sidekick), with only the occasional moments that revealed that she might be his moral compass as well.  I feel compelled to learn more about her, which is why I am currently reading&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mockingbird-A-Portrait-of-Harper-Lee/dp/B001GQ3DTM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mockingbird: A Portrait of Harper Lee</a>, a portrait written by Charles J.

1571903,4,B00005JPB0,"INFAMOUS (2006), starring Toby Jones, Sandra Bullock, and Daniel Craig, has had a hard time. After following the excellent CAPOTE (released the previous year) which happened to be both about the same subject matter and was highly acclaimed, INFAMOUS has a lot to live up to.

The film tells the behind-the-scenes story of how Truman Capote's ""non-fiction novel"", IN COLD BLOOD, came to be, only this time, it takes a different approach. Rather than CAPOTE's no-nonsense biographical style, INFAMOUS opts to instead be a comedy/drama. This is on one hand one of the film's strengths, but on the other it is also its biggest weakness.

Toby Jones plays a much more flamboyant Truman Capote than Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Many of the film's jokes rely on how out-of-place and unusual Capote and his mannerisms are to the residents of Holcomb. Then, at about the film's halfway point, INFAMOUS drastically shifts from humor to tense drama. Looking at the movie as a whole, the jokes are funny, but when the tone changes, the humor becomes inappropriate when put into context with the outcome of the events. After the real-life Capote's book was completed, it left him a sad and broken shell of who he once was.

The film has other differences from CAPOTE, including documentary-style monologues from Capote's friends and social circle (played by actors, of course) who highlight his quirks and comment on the events. This detracts from the film's accuracy, and probably could have been done more tastefully by revealing their opinion of Capote only through their interactions with him.

Daniel Craig gives a more rough-around-the-edges performance as Perry Smith than Clifton Collins, jr. As in CAPOTE, Smith is portrayed sympathetically, but the difference is still noticeable. Also, the supposed sexual interest between Smith and Capote is much more overt in INFAMOUS. The murder scene is heart-wrenching and emotionally gripping. INFAMOUS uses the Hitchcockian technique of ""implied violence"" to achieve the emotional effect and it works well.

INFAMOUS is simply not the same as CAPOTE, but is still solid entertainment. If viewed only from that level, the film can be enjoyed to its fullest.",1278374400,,2191,5.177966101694915
1571904,4,B00005JPB0,"Two films about Truman Capote and his novel 'In Cold Blood' were made in 2005: The oscar winning 'Capote'  and this little known 'Infamous'. I read that surprisingly both films were being made at the same time but neither studio was aware of the other's project. While both films very much tell the same story, their tone and technique are different enough I can still recommend seeing 'Infamous' even if you've already seen 'Capote'.

'Infamous' follows Truman Capote (Toby Jones), the flamboyant New York City novelist as he travels to Holcomb, Kansas with his friend Harper Lee (a suprisingly effective Sandra Bullock) and covers the murder of a family and the subsequent investigation and prosecution of the killers. Like in 'Capote' we see how the murder case turns into Truman Capote's more celebrated novel 'In Cold Blood' and the relationship he ends up forming with Perry Smith (a terrific Daniel Craig). While the events play out pretty much like they do in 'Capote', 'Infamous' embellishes the events (particularly the romance between Capote has with Smith) to make it a much more personal and accessible story. While it lacks the authentic, minimalist approach of 'Capote' I found 'Infamous' to be a lot more energitic and entertaining.

The roles in 'Infamous' are also filled with more familiar names than 'Capote' was but they add to the more colorful nature of the script. Toby Jones plays Truman as a lively socialite who seems to approach everything with witty banter. Jeff Daniels plays detective Alvin Dewey as a likeable family man and Daniel Craig plays Perry Smith as an introverted but passionate tough guy.

It's hard to make a call as to which Truman Capote story is better. Most film buffs, and probably myself would agree that 'Capote's' more matter-of-fact, authentic-feeling movie is the superior one. However I still enjoyed watching 'Infamous' and it's a great film in it's own way.",1278201600,2,1914,5.028391167192429
1571905,5,B00005JPB0,"It's too bad that this Indie film's release was delayed, to allow another Indie film to capitalize on the Capote idea. I'm often amused when talented actors win Oscars playing against ""type"". Hoffman was certainly fine, but so was Toby Jones, who looked a lot more like the diminuative enigma known as Truman Capote. Both presented a Capote, reasonably free of carricature, with confidence and focus. These 2 films are basically the same story, but I must admit that ""Infamous"" delved a little deeper to present more of Capote's motivations and inspiration. Indeed, a film titled ""Capote"", might've included his birth, youth, and subsequent situations, which led him to become the eventual icon of pop culture that he was. The despair he felt after getting to know the real Perry Smith was much better realized by Mr. Jones, in my opinion. Actors against type who've won Oscars might include Charlize Theron, Tom Hanks (Philadelphia) and Dustin Hoffman (Rain Man), and certainly P.S. Hoffman (though Terrence Howard deserved it that year). And who can forget Linda Hunt in ""The Year of Living Dangerously""?  Sandra Bullock was as good a Harper Lee as Ms. Keener. I guess it's all in the timing. ""Infamous"" still made a few Top 10 Lists in '06, but the interest in Capote had pretty much reached its threshhold by the time this came out. The audience simply wasn't there. Pity!

1571996,4,B00005JPB0,"Comparing ""Infamous"" (2006) with ""Capote,"" both deal with similar periods in the life of Truman Capote--his research into his famous non-fiction novel ""In Cold Blood."" The brutal murders of the four members of the Clutter family by Perry Smith and Dick Hickock drew Capote into a five year ordeal. In ""Infamous"" he got emotionally too close to one of the killers, Perry Smith.
""Infamous"" is more sensational, more salacious, more campy, and I think less well-done than ""Capote."" Everything in ""Infamous"" is done in broad brush strokes and relies in the early portions more on caricature than characterization. Capote was an easy target for mimicry, and both Jones and Philip Seymour Hoffman occasionally crossed the line.
Capote is portrayed as selfish, self-absorbed, a malicious gossip, a liar, and a person with a frivolous, high-flying Manhattan lifestyle. He is shown rumor-mongering with his society women chums and doesn't mind sharing with them the gory details of the murders.
The outlandish outfits he is wearing when he arrives in Kansas are more a costumer's fantasies than the real thing. Much is made of Truman's flitty behavior.
Daniel Craig is a good actor, but not as good as Robert Blake or Clifton Collin, Jr. because he's too assertive and self-possessed for the part of Perry.
Truman wins over the townspeople by his gossipy tales about Hollywood celebrities. Jeff Daniels as the investigator has a smaller part to play as the movie progresses. Truman's skill as an arm wrestler seems phony as does the eye contact exchange between Perry and Truman when Perry is being brought back to the county jail for the first time after his capture.
Occasionally characters talk to the camera: Truman's friend Nelle Lee Harper author of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" and Jack Dunphy, his lover.
Truman tells how he's going to break ground with a new kind of reportage, applying fictional techniques to a non-fiction book.
One difference from ""Capote"" is in this movie Truman offers Dick and Perry a share of his royalties.
He entertains and manipulates Perry and wins him over, but also lies to him. A key confrontation comes when Perry finds out the title of the book is ""In Cold Blood,"" and if we are to believe this account, Perry, in a rage in his cell tried to sexually molest Truman. At one point they have a passionate kiss. This movie makes the emotional connection between them very powerful.
In this movie the scenes between Perry and Truman are more intense, more lurid and more melodramatic. When you view both movies, it's ""Capote"" that's more restrained, more balanced, and aims less for the prurient.
Nelle at the end said, ""There were three deaths on the gallows that night."" Truman never went on to write anything of value after his seminal book.",1248393600,2,2767,4.939914163090129
1571997,4,B00005JPB0,"Unfortunately, Infamous was released in the wake of Capote, which won an Oscar for Phillip Seymour Hoffman. It covers the same ground, the events before and after the publication of Truman Capote's groundbreaking blend of non-fiction journalism with novelistic techniques, In Cold Blood. Hoffman may have won the Oscar, but Toby Jones was no slouch, either. Jones had an advantage over Hoffman, in that he more closely resembled Capote to begin with. He then perfected the voice, and more importantly, the attitude. No one delivers a withering remark or snappy retort like Jones, unless of course, it was Truman Capote himself. Or Gore Vidal.

---------------------
Gore Vidal: [on Truman's voice] To the lucky person who has never heard it, I can only say: imagine what a brussel sprout would sound like, if a brussel sprout could talk.
================================

Truman Capote had the wit, but also knew how to be a good listener. There are great scenes with Truman and his many devoted female friends -- his swans. Quite a stellar cast of ladies: Gwyneth Paltrow, Hope Davis, Isabella Rossellini, Sigourney Weaver, and last but least, Sandra Bullock. Toby Jones does a great job of showing how the Capote charm, though outrageously flaming, was able to win over not only the wealthy and glamorous, but also the good people of Kansas, and even a couple of cold blooded killers:

---------------------
Truman Capote: When you're talking to them, they seem like perfectly nice boys. To be frank, I'm much more concerned for my safety around Norman Mailer.
================================

Jeff Daniels plays the D.A., Michael Panes was Gore Vidal, film director Peter Bogdanovich plays publisher Bennett Cerf, and Daniel Craig plays the cold blooded killer with an artistic temperament, Perry Smith. Sandra Bullock as Capote's friend, Nelle Harper Lee, author of To Kill a Mockingbird, was the only casting thud. Bullock just didn't work here, and her poor imitation of a Southern accent didn't help. A pity that they didn't use Samantha Morton instead, as originally planned. Gwyneth Paltrow, on the other hand, was quite a surprise, the way she handled Cole Porter's ""What Is This Thing Called Love?"" Not only did she sing it well, but she also made it the dramatic centerpiece of a nightclub act. She was so good as a singer that I thought she was an up-and-coming jazz singer who could also act. I didn't even realize that it was Paltrow, an actor who can really sing.

Though there was a lot on offer, Infamous somehow seemed more like a made-for-TV movie than a film. It would be interesting to do a side-by-side comparison with Capote, which I have seen, but a long time ago. On the box they quote one critic who says that Infamous is more fun than Capote. Perhaps they are right. Toby Jones may have been a better Capote than Hoffman, but he made it look too easy. Too easy and fun. No Oscars are awarded for easy and fun.

One last bit of Infamous trivia that I can't resist repeating: Sigourney Weaver's first role was in Annie Hall, and also in that cast, Truman Capote.

1571999,5,B00005JPB0,"""Infamous"" has a little bit of the same problem that the film ""The Wizard of Oz"" had in that it was released in 1939, the same year as ""Gone With The Wind,"" which of course took the award for best picture that year. This really good film will always be compared, perhaps unfairly, with ""Capote,"" for which Philip Semour Hoffman won the Oscar for best actor. The British actor Toby Jones is just as believable as Hoffman as the elfin author of such American classics as BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S and of course IN COLD BLOOD, the research and writing of which is the time in Capote's life that both films cover. Jones certainly has both the stature of the writer, actually looks more like Capote than Hoffman does and has the voice and accent just right.

Based on George Plimpton's oral history of Truman Capote, the film opens with Gwyneth Paltrow singing ""What Is This Thing Called Love?"" and moves back and forth between scenes in New York-- with usually either Capote meeting and gossiping with his high society friends, Diana Vreeland (Juliet Stevenson), Babe Paley (Sigourney Weaver), Bennett Cerf (Peter Bogdanovich), et al or these people speaking directly to the audience as they did in the book-- and Kansas where the entire Clutter family was murdered. Sandra Bullock is cast as Harper Lee, the author of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD and Capote's friend from childhood. Daniel Craig as Perry Smith, who plays one of the killers who was eventually executed for the murders, is sexy, complicated and vulnerable. While we do not excuse him for the horrific thing he has done, when we see the awful childhood he had, we can understand, at least in part, what may have got him to Kansas on that fateful night. While we will never know if Smith's and Capote's relationship was as intimate as this film indicates, it does seem certain that the writer's life was never the same after he wrote IN COLD BLOOD and that he spiralled downward and never wrote much of anything else of consequence thereafter.

As I recall, Jones plays Capote as a much more tragic and sympathetic person than Hoffman did. In ""Capote"" the writer comes across as much more cynical than in ""Infamous"" in that he really did not want the murderers to win their appeals since their executions would make his book better.

If you liked ""Capote,"" you certainly should see ""Infamous.""",1233446400,,2344,4.740196078431373

1572001,3,B00005JPB0,"Released nearly a year after Philip Seymour Hoffman's Oscar-winning turn in ""Capote"", Douglas McGrath's overlooked ""Infamous"" (based on George Plimpton's bestseller) covers, essentially, the same territory while remaining uniquey different from its predecessor.

Star Toby Jones has the right look for the late author, and certainly has his mannerisms down pat.  More spritely, less acerbic, and less dissipated than the Capote inhabited by Hoffman, Jones has an almost wholesome winsomness that seems to be counter to most of what I've read about the real-life Capote.  And while Hoffman's performance seemed to come from some dark and painful place deep within (and may, thus, seem more genuine), Jones' Capote is much more fun to watch. I think his portrayal comes closer to humanizing the fascinating ""tiny terror"", whose association with a notorious murder case and its perpetrators helped lead to his own downward spiral into disgrace and notoriety.  As best friend and fellow author, Nell Harper Lee, Sandra Bullock continues to refine her acting skills, proving that her outstanding performance in ""Crash"" was no fluke.  Alternately disapproving and supportive, her Nell is Truman's rock, his anchor in the often turbulent waters of his own life; she's strong and sensible, with the only problem being a Southern accent that is sorely unconvincing.  As Truman's high-society ""swans"" from New York, Sigourney Weaver (Babe Paley), Hope Davis (Slim Keith), and Isabella Rosellini (Marella Agnelli) provide a Greek chorus of tea and sympathy for Truman's ongoing dramas.  The delightful Juliet Stevenson delivers a nice turn as the fabulous Diana Vreeland, and Peter Bogdanovich is also fine as publisher and Capote confidante, Bennet Cerf. Character actor John Benjamin Hickey, as Capote's partner, Jack Dunphy, brings a lost and bittersweet edge to the film's goings-on, while Jeff Daniels, as lawman Alvin Dewey, lends the movie an element of strength and steadiness.

Of course, it is the killers of ""In Cold Blood"" who amp up the element of drama in both ""Capote"" and in ""Infamous"".  Lee Pace (of ""Pushing Daisies"") is suitably scary as cold and matter-of-fact Dick Hickock, who killed without remorse, and then never shut up talking about it.  But, conveying both the chilling barbarism and wounded sensitivity of murderous Perry Smith, while noting his similarities to Truman, is essential to successfully presenting a certain dichotomy that has probably rarely existed between an author and his interview subject. Robert Blake (in Richard Brooks' ""In Cold Blood"") epitomized the limping, pathetic Smith, humanizing him yet presenting him in a very real, warts-and-all way; Clifton Collins, in ""Capote"", though prettied-up, was also believable in the same role.  In ""Infamous"", no less than 007 actor, Daniel Craig, assays the role of Perry Smith, with, I think, less successful results.  He's an outstanding actor but too much of a movie star for this role; his glamour surrounds the Smith character with an aura that ultimately glamourizes the killer, imbuing him with an artificiality that dashes any hopes of bringing honesty or any real level of understanding to this most complex of characters.  The physicality between the two men and the suggestion of a jailhouse affair between Capote and Smith also strains credulity, and the sexual dynamics seem false and forced.  This brings an air of dishonesty to the Capote/Smith scenes, which, ultimately doesn't play well.  The Clutters themselves--the Kansas farm family slain by Hickock and Smith in a bungled robbery attempt--are barely shown, and I was thankful for that.  While the killings are briefly covered, the brutality of the crimes is not as much in evidence as it was in the previous films.

Except for the slaughter of the innocent family, there is nothing subtle about ""Infamous"".  From its weirdly flaky opening (with Gwyneth Paltrow as a lounge singer) to the flambuoyant lead character to the fluttering socialites, everything seems designed to SHOUT to the viewer, to PROJECT  to the audience sitting in the rafters.  At times, ""Infamous"" seems much more like a stage play than a movie, and all this accomplishes is to make the film seem more rough than its predecessors.  While there are problems with this movie, I still like it, mostly for Toby Jones' winning performance, however broad it may be.",1227744000,8,4382,5.276258992805755

1572004,5,B00005JPB0,"Of ""The Two Mr. Capotes"" (the other being the more commercially popular ""Capote"", released at the same time last year), this is definitely the best one.  While Phillip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal may have been Oscar-worthy, Toby Jones really brings the pain here - the mincing walk, overdone eye gestures, and chalkboard-grating high voice are dead on.  Plus, you get the feel of his relationship with what were then ""true socialites"", Babe Paley (Sigourney Weaver), Slim Keith (Hope Davis) and Marella Agnelli (Isabella Rossellini), who kept it real by keeping their designer clothes on.  (Paris and Nicky Hilton could learn something about self-respect and dignity from just watching this film!)  The most scandalous thing that they appeared to have done was kick off their pumps and do the ""Twist"" to the sounds of Chubby Checker!

Capote's murder masterpiece ""In Cold Blood"" was the very first ""true crime novel"" that I ever read.  It was chilling in a way that no other written account of a murder has been able to duplicate since.  In this film,  one not only gets an accurate account of the crime, you also get a look into the angst of the writer and what it must be like to be that close to such a heinous deed.  Truman Capote's later mental decline, substance abuse, and fall from society's fickle grace was not just the result of his inability to match this book, but from the unstable and dysfunctional life he had even before this, ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", and his other fabulous works.

Sandra Bullock gives a stunning turn as Truman's childhood friend, writer Nell Harper Lee.  And David Craig's portrayal as killer Perry Smith is sympathetic and pathetic and raw.  You find yourself wishing that this was a work of fiction so that this time he wouldn't be executed.

If all you know about Mr. Capote involves a disco ball, Andy Warhol, and Studio 54, watch this film before you watch anything else written or filmed about him.  The only other story about his life that really gives you a look into the man is ""in Cold Blood"".  Now that's scary!",1217721600,4,2060,4.779661016949152
1572005,5,B00005JPB0,"Comparions to Hoffman's Capote are inevitable given the proximity of the two releases as well as the fact the two films deal with exactly the same subject.  ""Capote"" painted broader strokes while ""Infamous"" was somewhat more specific. Lastly, Toby Jones was simply overshadowed by the more popular, Phillip Seymour Hoffman,

I vividly remember Truman Capote on the TV talk-show circuit and Toby captured the same deliberately profound annoyance that Capote seemed to wallow in.  I read ""In Cold Blood"" in high school and it was indeed an excellent book - quite well-written, though chilling in its subject matter as well as the treatment.  But as a personality, Truman was a most uncomfortable sight - I readily admit that my being a black, gay teenager certainly colored (no pun intended) my perceptions. Tennesse Williams & James Baldwin, both gay literary contemporaries of Capote were equally uncomfortable, (and equally talented/troubled).

""Infamous"" deals most intimately with Capote's relationship with Perry while researching and writing ""In Cold Blood"".  The performances of Jones & Daniel Craig are at the core of the movie. Their performances are wrenching and give the implications the movie makes enormous credibility. Sandra Bullock as Harper Lee, the author of 'To Kill A Mockingbird"" (another classic) is simply wonderful.  Quite frankly, it is some of the best work I have ever seen from her.

Even more interesting is that this particular perspective of the machinations behind the famous novel still take a back seat to a much more intimate situation lots of people find themselves in but that is rarely so beautifully addressed.

It is this aspect of the movie that made the biggest impression upon me.

In the beginning, it is obvious Capote is totally opportunistic in his quest to actually interview one of the killers.  His book is his focal point.  The film wonderully suggests that Capote was just as shocked (and pleased) to realize he cared deeply for Perry - and Perry for him.  And this was not an easy road for either to travel. More importanly, the evolution of their relationship had absolutely nothing to do with their sexuality.

This is a classic example of individual instances (quite common) where a gay/lesbian person forges a close relationship with someone straight - both sides initially having serious apprehensions about the other, only to have this complicated with genuine feelings developing on both sides. The inevitable result is that neither side knows quite how to deal with those genuine feelings.  After wading through all the mud, the lesson learned is that two people, if they allow themselves to, can forget race, color, age, economics, gender, or any other useless category and simply allow themselves to genuinely care about each other. (yeah, it went there for me)

I mean to take nothing away from Hoffman's ""Capote"". Both films provide insight; they present two alternative perspectives and I highly recommend both projects.

It is simply that as an art form 'Infamous"" more closely meets the general objective I believe all art forms aspire to - to open/elevate the dialogue.",1213833600,3,3138,5.145669291338582

Daniel Craig gives a rougher, more harder edge to Perry Smith's character in ""Infamous"", whereas Clifton Collins Jr. portrayal of Perry Smith in ""Capote"" was a lot softer, more gentle... It seemed as though Perry Smith was portrayed as more of a little boy lost in ""Capote"" and more of the hardened criminal in ""Infamous"" that one would expect him to be.

Truman Capote in ""Infamous"" seemed to be more compassionate towards the criminals and more caring towards them. Whereas the Truman Capote portrayed in ""Capote"", seemed to be just using the criminals as a means to end and that end was to use them in order to write his masterpiece ""In Cold Blood"".",1198886400,,916,4.71875
1572070,4,B00005JPB0,"This kind of thing happens all the time in Hollywood.  Remember when Kevin Costner's WYATT EARP didn't beat Kurt Russell in TOMBSTONE to the screens and didn't get the audience it deserved for trying to stick closer to history rather than offering a good guy/bad guy shoot-em-up?  Or when DEEP IMPACT and ARMAGGEDON dueled at the multiplex?

It even happens with serious art films.

CAPOTE made it out first, fetching Philip Seymour Hoffman an Academy Award for his brilliant performance.  Then INFAMOUS came out...with a brilliant performance from Toby Jones as Truman Capote.

Between these two films, I read the biography that served as the basis for CAPOTE and got a lot of insight into the life of Capote.  Actually, I felt the bio had LESS about his writing of ""In Cold Blood"" than the film but much more about his early and later years, as well as his life in New York City.

Based on that book, INFAMOUS probably comes closer to the real Truman.  (Also, after listening to the commentary on CAPOTE, I heard Philip Seymour Hoffman talk about how he ended up playing certain scenes differently from the script--improvised acting that added a sympathy for the character that would not have been there otherwise).

If you enjoyed CAPOTE, I think you should definitely check out INFAMOUS.  There's a great cast, a broader sweep of Capote's life, and an interesting insight into how the book came about...and its harsh consequences.

I was bent on thumbs down from the outset...and so, in the end,  it was appropriate..  ""Infamous""----it is to laugh.",1197158400,,617,4.738317757009346

The cast is outstanding, with cameo appearances by Gwyneth Paltrow, Isabella Rossellini (as a comical, dimwit Maria Agnelli), and Sigourney Weaver, among others. Toby Jones gives a strong performance as Capote, but it's difficult to live up to Philip Seymour Hoffman's magnificent portrayal. The real star here is the tough, smart, vulnerable Daniel Craig as Perry Smith, the murderer who becomes the only person before whom Capote will allow himself to be vulnerable, while he writes the masterpiece ""In Cold Blood.""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-Cold-Blood/dp/0679745580/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In Cold Blood</a>

Capote is treated much more sympathetically here than in the other film, as we learn of his terrible childhood. As an adult, his deviousness is more subtle, but still damaging. We see him acting as confidante to his socialite friends, only to spread the scandals all over New York as soon as he leaves the restaurant. And as he becomes more and more attached to Perry, he still must act uninvolved and uncaring when discussing the case with friends. His behavior towards Perry is the mystery in this story--the idea of Perry's execution leaves him weak with grief, but at the same time he frets to his friends about how his book can't be released until there's an ""end"" to the story. He romanticizes and sensationalizes Perry's death, pretending that he witnessed the whole thing even though the film shows him running away before the last moment. There's palpable sexual tension between Perry and Truman in this film, which may or may not be true but certainly brings an added dimension to the story.

I saw this film recently, probably two years after I saw ""Capote,"" and that's plenty of time to come to it with fresh eyes. It's a smaller film than ""Capote""--the famous black-and-white ball isn't mentioned, as Capote's inner life is more the focus. But ""Infamous"" is well worth seeing for its own sake--you won't be disappointed.",1196985600,,2291,5.63768115942029

I say unfortunate because both are very good movies but call for comparison in spite of it.  Phillip Seymour Hoffman even got his Oscar for portrayal of Truman Capote.  Inevitably, one has to compare Hoffman's performance with Toby Jones' portrayal of Capote in ""Infamous"".  I must say that although Hoffman has certainly earned his Oscar, Toby Jones was even better in his portrayal of the famous New Yorker writer.  Script for ""Infamous"" is better because it shows in more depth how complex and entertaining Capote as a human being truly was.  His weird voice, demeanor and dressing almost no longer matter after we get to know him.  He seduces us with his wit and sensitivity.  ""Infamous"" is peppered with high calibar actors like: Segourney Weaver, Isabela Rosellini, Peter Bogdanovich, Lilly Taylor, Daniel Craig, Gwyneth Paltrow and Sandra Bullock. While at the end, film runs out of steam a little bit, I find it to be a better one that ""In Cold Blood"" that got more publicity, which again is very unfortunate.",1196640000,,1119,4.8578947368421055
1572074,4,B00005JPB0,"This movie is one of those mysteries of Hollywood.  Why we got two movies about Truman Capote's writing of ""In Cold Blood"" is hard to fathom.  If ""Capote"" had not been made, this movie would have been more widely received than it has been.  Let's just admit from the start that ""Capote"" and Philip Seymour Hoffman created the more powerful and charismatic Truman, but Capote is more or less an impression of them man than an embodiment or impersonation of him.  Toby Jones captures the physical presence and the strange way Truman spoke more completely.  However, the Jones version plays more needy and less self-assured (but similarly tortured) than the Seymour Hoffman Truman.  I don't prefer one over the other and enjoyed both.  I have not heard anyone who knew Truman comment on which was more ""accurate"".

While both movies deal with Capote's homosexuality in some way, this movie is more frank and takes it further than ""Capote"" does.  Some may find the overt displays of sexuality in this film disturbing, but it is never graphic.  Where in ""Capote"" the relationship between Truman and Perry Smith is dominated by the manipulative writer, the relationship in ""Infamous"" is manipulative and desperate on both sides.  Which it actually was, I do not know.  Does anyone really know since the parties involved are dead?  Would Truman's testimony about it be reliable?  Didn't it change over time?  I love the scene where Truman is recounting something Perry told him and changing it slightly for different groups of people to gauge the effect.  For the book, he chooses the version for effect not accuracy.

Sandra Bullock is terrific in her portrayal of Nelle Harper Lee.  Frankly, it was such a delight seeing such a wonderful characterization that I didn't recognize her at first.  Usually she portrays the trademark sunny and goofy character despite the name or plot, and that is enjoyable, but this turn as a character was a real treat.  Jeff Daniels is also very good as the lawman Alvin Dewey who at first denies Truman access and then befriends him and enables Capote's ability to get information for the book.

The movie employs a technique of interviewing the characters who knew Truman as if the actors were the people providing insights for a documentary.  Some people have objected to this, but I kind of liked it.

I enjoyed this movie and admired its accomplishments.  Is it as strong a movie as ""Capote""?  No.  However, it has some marvelous scenes.  As just a few examples, the scene at the end with Truman going through the things Perry Smith left him is very powerful.  Also, Sigourney Weaver has some marvelous scenes as Babe Paley and shows the powerful emotional connections Truman had with many women throughout his life.  I also liked Peter Bogdanovich as Truman's editor and publisher, Bennett Cerf.  When no one else would go to the hanging with Truman, it was Cerf who accompanied him.

I would recommend seeing both films and appreciating each for its strengths rather than trying to pit one movie against the other.

We shared the magazine with friends and neighbors and we were all mesmerized with this amazing piece of writing.  And this film brings back all those memories of the early 1960s, Truman and his friends, his social whirlwind life and his love and passion for Perry Smith.

Not only is Jones a much better Capote than Hoffman, but this movie is superior to  Capote, it's funnier, the backstory of Capote's life is much richer and nuanced and the supporting actors are better.  Jones channels Capote, he lets the viewer understand why everybody wanted to be around this man and why he was such a sensation, he also showed Capote's darker side and how to him the ends always justifed the means, no matter how manipulative he had to be.  I also liked Bullock as Harper Lee, her accent came and went, but her performance was well done, she was the only person that really knew Capote and she was the only one would could really call him out on his hypocracy; he could not fool her.  Highly recommended, but if you deside to see both Capote and Infamous, watch Capote first, then Infamous, because if you see Toby Jones Capote first, it will ruin Hoffman's performance believe me.",1190332800,3,1069,4.518134715025907
1572270,4,B00005JPB0,"I saw this picture after seeing ""Capote"", for which PS Hoffman won a Best Actor Oscar.  I actually liked this one somewhat better.  I felt that it had more attention to the details in Kansas, and showed Capote as much more manipulative and gossipy.  Sandra Bullock did a wonderful job as Nelle Harper Lee, Capote's friend and fellow writer.  Her Alabama drawl was spot-on, and her reflections were very poignant and thoughtful.  And speaking of fab accents, I would never have known that Daniel Craig wasn't an American.  The Brits do American so much better than we do British.  Oh, well.

This picture also had more of what could be called the ""love story"" between Capote and Perry Smith, one of the killers from ""In Cold Blood"".  Little by little, Capote manages to ""seduce"" Smith out of his shell, until they bond and apparently fall in love.  There is also much better development of how Capote used his name-dropping and Hollywood gossip to charm the Kansas residents into giving him information.

Very weird that these two movies came out so close to each other.  As long as there isn't another one...",1190160000,2,1108,4.7434554973821985
1572271,5,B00005JPB0,"I first watched Infamous with Toby Jones as Truman Capote. I then watched Capote with Philip Seymour Hoffman who played Truman Capote.  I wonder what would have happened if the Academy had viewed both movies simultaneously.  I think Toby Jones would have been an Oscar winner instead of Philip Seymour Hoffman.  Although Mr. Hoffman did an exceptional job of acting, Toby Jones was Truman Capote.  As I watched both movies I forgot that Mr. Jones was an actor playing a part, I never forgot that fact with Philip Seymour Hoffman.  Not only was the casting of Toby Jones inspired, the fleshing out of the character was much more realistic.  I found it difficult to believe in ""Capote"" that Truman Capote could be so well liked by many without having sympathetic and engaging characteristics.  In Infamous, one could see why so many people were drawn to Truman Capote.  Although he could be manipulative, he also had a heart.  He was able to elicit trust in a variety of people.  Mere manipulation could not get people to disclose their most secret thoughts.  Truman Capote suffered in his childhood and that suffering made him keenly aware of the emotions and feelings of those around him.  As a writer he had to be skilled at ""getting the story"", but he also had to understand the human feelings that made those stories come to life. I think that is why Harper Lee befriended him.  Sandra Bullock did a fabulous job as Harper Lee.  I preferred her performance to Catherine Keener's in Capote.  Infamous was a more visually rich movie than Capote.  If was very much like watching one movie in color and the other in black and white.  I also liked how Infamous delved into the lives of Truman's Swans (his socialite friends) and into his relationship with Harper Lee.  Truman's rise to a celebrated author from a childhood that was less than nurturing is a study in triumph over odds.  He deserved his success. Was it any wonder that he would want to continue and expand upon his success by bringing literary life to the tragic story of the Clutters?  Truman stepped into a world that was not his own and found acceptance, after quite a bit of effort.  He also found kinship with Perry Smith, a man who shared much of his childhood pain.  Perry took one path, while Truman himself took another.  Truman's almost soul to soul connection with Perry was something that I do not believe he expected to experience.  I think Perry was smart enough to know that Truman was manipulative, after all he had a story to tell, but he also knew that Truman saw Perry as he was before, during and after the murder of the Clutter family.  When Perry was around Truman and when Truman was around Perry they could drop their facades, at least for a little while.  Daniel Craig did an amazing job as Perry Smith.  He was able to create a character that was sensitive, sympathetic, cold, scary, lost, sad, uncertain and fragile all in one complex package.  His scenes with Toby Jones were unforgettable.  Their connection was tangible.  Watching the two, you could understand how the real Truman Capote was affected by Perry Smith and why the phrase 'More tears are shed from answered prayers than unanswered ones' seemed to haunt Truman Capote till his death given the part he may have played whether literally(no pun intended)or figuratively in Perry's death. He finally got an end  to his book, but it was at a price.  The unexpected connection to his soul he had created or uncovered while writing ""In Cold Blood"" was severed permanently when Perry died. Infamous is a captivating movie, I highly recommend it.",1188604800,3,3592,4.715890850722311
1572272,2,B00005JPB0,Perhaps it is because I saw the Philip Seymore Hoffman version or even the Robert Blake Scott Wilson movie first but I just didn't think this movie was nearly as good as the two that came out before it.

Sandra Bullock finally gets a part where she doesn't (over)play a ditz and she is very centered, calm and good as Harper Lee.  James Bond, that is Daniel Craig, also does an excellent job as Perry Smith.  But you know what?  One movie about a semi-legendary writer, bon vivant liar, now dead for more than two decades (having outlived his era by at least another decade) and the slaughter of the poor Clutter family is enough.  Infamous is more centered in Kansas and, despite some frank physicality, feels less fictionalized than Capote.  But in the crux scenes of the relationship between Capote and Smith, it might all be fiction because all we've got to rely on is In Cold Blood, and Capote is anything but a reliable narrator.  That much both Capote and Infamous make abundantly clear.  Either one is well worth watching.

1572352,4,B00005JPB0,"This is an extraordinary tribute to a writer who I think is overrated. Years ago a Broadway show made the rounds called ""Tru,"" which depicted the master as a drunken loser with heart. The recent film ""Capote"" and now ""Infamous"" seek to show the man as a complex figure who wrote a very good book about the famous murders in the mid-west that would have been forgotten had it not been for this strange little genius. The film is well made, although I don't see dramatic differences between the stories, which both show Capote as a writer who was made and destroyed by this singular success. The acting is uniformly splendid. Especially noteworthy is Sandra Bullock, who plays southern extremely well. Juliet Stevenson is great. Weaver is a hoot, especially with that height that shows her towering over Capote. Toby Jones is very good as Capote, in many ways fulfilling the role fully, but Hoffman's performance in the rival film was equally good. Both give performances which convince us of Capote's his inner torment. Here, it seems to me, the part of Perry Smith was better written than in ""Capote."" There is more to him than meets the eye. The performance by Daniel Craig is memorable. Much is made of Perry's sexuality, and one is given the impression that Capote fell for him, which may or may not be true. Who knows? Two strong films about one very little writer are enough. Let's move on now to our many other gifted writers.",1185926400,3,1432,4.686507936507937

That said, it still doesn't have the power and depth of the original ""In Cold Blood"" with Robert Blake.  I don't think any remake will ever be able to match it!",1184544000,,418,4.4868421052631575
1572355,4,B00005JPB0,"This is certainly a highly entertaining film. Toby Jones is very convincing and funny as Truman Capote. Yet, unfortunately it was released around the same time as that masterpiece of film, Capote, also about the rise and fall of this American writer. Toby Jones plays a campy Capote, trying to use gay camp humor to open doors. This is dramatically different from the manner in which Seymour Hoffman plays Capote in the film of that name. In Capote, the character of Truman opens doors by careful and strategic revelation of vulnerability which in turn allows the person with whom he is talking to begin to open up and express thier own vulnerability, feeling that they are in a safe space. At the very beginning of the film, an actor, playing the role of Gore Vidal, says that Truman Capote talked just the way a brussel sprout would talk if a brussel sprout could talk. This is a perfect description of the way that Toby Jones selected to play Capote.

Infamous is interesting in the way that it integrates the bleak Kansas landscape where a family was murdered with Capote's life among America's wealthy jet-set power-broker women-friends. The film Capote selects to focus primarily on events in Kansas and this minimal approach actually hightens the drama and the tragedy.

Homosexuality in Capote is subtle and implied in the character of Perry Smith. However in the film Infamous, Daniel Craig masterfully plays a complex Perry Smith that emerges as a gay man during the five years he awaits execution. Daniel Craig's acting is exceptional and a high point of the film.

This leads to the major distinction between the two films. In Infamous, Capote falls in love with Perry Smith and this attraction to Smith helps motivate the production of the book. It is Smith's confession of love that disarms Capote and makes the hanging death of Smith tragic. In Capote, the artistic impulse is the driving force behind Truman Capote. When Capote begins to fall in love with Perry Smith, the tragedy is constructed around his dual and ambivalent emotions. If Smith lives, then Capote can't publish his masterpiece. If Perry Smith hangs, then the book can be published but Capote loses his love.

In Infamous, after the execution of Perry Smith, Capote is seen as falling apart and disengaging from his social life. In Capote, the fall into alcholism and the isolation is more pronounced and tragic. In the film Infamous, Nelle Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize for To Kill A Mockingbird is a narrative detail. In Capote, it is taken as a stab in the heart to Capote and he distances himself from his childhood friend.

Sandra Bullock does a very good job of playing Nelle Harper Lee, primarily by understating the part, speaking with the soft quiet mellow tones of a Southern lady.

The unfortunate thing about this film is that it is really excellent but it is almost impossible not to compare it to Capote, an exceptional and rare masterpiece of narrative film.",1184284800,3,2954,4.8396039603960395

Granted it unfortunately came out after the wonderful Capote and I admit I did not see it at the movies, which is actually a blessing because I would have missed out on the completely engrossing and informative directors commentary! Do not skip that! After you see the movie and the complex meanings have seeped into your consciousness, watch that commentary.
The actor Toby who channeled Capote was mesmerizing. He became Truman, was not simply mimicing.
Sandra Bullock was excellent, absolutely, as was Daniel Craig, Sigourney Weaver, Isabella Rossalini, Jeff Daniels, Juliette Stevenson,Peter Bogdanovich.... Oh! And Gwenyth Paltrow beautifully sang a cole porter song (which was a very telling scene...as explained by the director)
I do not want to give anything away, and I am sure other reviewers have summarized the plot line...but from the writing, to the acting, to the set designs, the music, the costumes, the period feel, the emotional twists of human achievement versus human cruelty...this is a film that is worth experiencing.

1572357,4,B00005JPB0,"This movie starring Toby Jones as Truman Capote covers almost the same ground as the Academy Award-nominated film ""Capote,"" starring Philip Seymour Hoffman. I'm not sure why two such similar movies appeared at almost the same time. But actually of the two, I found this Jones movie to be the more absorbing. If you only have the time or inclination to watch one dramatization of Truman Capote's writing of ""In Cold Blood,"" I suggest this movie be the one.

It doesn't have the cachet of Hoffman's performance. But neither does it have the sometimes annoying tone of self-importance of that other film. Nor does this movie have some of the anachronistic locutions found in ""Capote."" It is truer to Capote's wit and way of telling a story.

Best of all though, ""Infamous"" shows much more of the gossipy society circle that Capote generally inhabited. Juliet Stevenson turns in a priceless and all-too-brief performance as fashion editor Diana Vreeland.

There is also more texture to Capote's relationship with killer Perry Smith here. I'm not sure how much of the more developed romance shown in this movie is conjecture, but it makes for a heartbreaking love story. Daniel Craig turns in a gripping performance as the dark, vulnerable and volatile Smith.

Director Douglas McGrath provides a very interesting, literate commentary on the DVD. His accompanying thoughts run like a polished essay, without being at all pretentious. He becomes another character in the unfolding biography, a character most of us would probably like to get to know better.

All-in-all, we do get to know the wit and wiliness Capote better through this film. We see Capote as that flickering brilliance that Sandra Bullock-playing-Harper Lee describes. She says he had the sunny brightness of a candle flame - but always with that tinge of blue at the center of the burning.",1182038400,8,1852,5.019543973941368
1572358,5,B00005JPB0,"After reading ""In Cold Blood"" I decided to watch both of the recent films about Truman Capote, beginning with ""Infamous"" and then watching ""Capote"". My recommendation to others is to only watch ""Infamous"". Although it covers very grim subject matter, this movie is very watchable and enjoyable, as opposed to ""Capote"" which is two hours of artsy misery. Toby Jones really becomes Truman Capote in a way that Phillip Hoffman does not even touch. Jones' Truman draws the viewer in and charms, while Hoffman's performance in ""Capote"" alienates and repulses to the point that it seems that this actor secretly hates Truman Capote. Also, ""Infamous"" does a much better job at explaining the story to thise who have not read the book, and giving depth to the other characters than ""Capote"". Watching ""Infamous"", the dark parts of the story are thrown into sharper relief by the light and humorous parts, and it cuts precisely to the heart of the matter. Whereas ""Capote"" just bludgeons the viewer over the head with gritty green lighting, long staring pauses and unrelieved gloom.",1181260800,4,1073,5.0
1572359,5,B00005JPB0,"I went into this film with only the most basic knowledge about Truman Capote and his writing.  I knew he wrote Breakfast at Tiffany's and In Cold Blood, the latter of which was based on a real crime, I knew he was as exceedingly odd little man, and that's about it.  I've never read any of his work, and I haven't seen the film In Cold Blood or 2005's Capote.  As I first began watching Infamous, I found myself wondering how I could possibly sit through almost two hours of a film about this dandyish, hopelessly pretentious man smarming his way through New York high society.  His incredibly annoying voice didn't help, even though it was nowhere near as bothersome as Sandra Bullock's horrible fake Southern accent in her role as Harper Lee.  As the film progressed, though, this strange little man began to grow on me.  By the mid-way point, I was pretty much engrossed in the story, and the ending clinched all five of the stars I have to give this film (which is pretty amazing given the fact that it includes three of my least favorite actresses: Gwyneth Paltrow, Sigourney Weaver, and the aforementioned Sandra Bullock).

Obviously, Truman Capote is one of the most complex and fascinating of men.  I certainly won't define the man by the interpretation on display in Infamous (which is based on Douglas McGrath's 1997 oral biography of the man); after all, this is a fictionalized story of a man known for his own obfuscations with the truth.  You can't even look at In Cold Blood with purely objective eyes because Capote relied on memory rather than notes to produce the book.  And, from what I gather, 2005's Capote provides a noticeably different perspective on the man as it tells basically the same story as Infamous, focusing on the writing and later publication of In Cold Blood.  One thing I am sure of is that Toby Jones turns in an absolutely captivating performance as this most inscrutable of characters.  Capote seemed like such a fake in the early scenes, but Toby Jones transformed him into an incredibly human soul long before the end credits began rolling - sympathetic to a significant degree, as some of the flaws in Capote's character manifest themselves, but not without his own emotionally cold-blooded moment here and there.  If nothing else, this Truman Capote is not a man you would want to confide in with your darkest secrets.

Infamous gets pretty emotionally complicated once Capote finally gets access to both killers, especially a reluctant Perry Smith (Daniel Craig).  It's a bumpy ride, but the relationship that develops between Smith and Capote serves as the lynchpin of this film.  Infamous dares call it love, although I imagine that is debatable.  Clearly, though, the two men understood one another in ways few others ever did, and that makes the drama of the concluding scenes truly palpable.

I find it somewhat ironic that the actual murder that gave rise to In Cold Blood and these two recent films about Truman Capote doesn't seem to generate much interest at all.  Capote, both the myth and the man, towers over his subject matter.  I certainly don't feel as if I know the real Truman Capote after watching this film, but I'm intrigued enough to go and seek out 2005's Capote and see the story of In Cold Blood told from an alternate viewpoint.",1181001600,3,3299,4.754385964912281
1572468,5,B00005JPB0,"I was having a hard time watching or thinking of watching another ""Capote"" movie as I liked the last one that came out, but I did anyway and I have to say that I became SO drawn into it, as its done so differently than the other, and drew upon different aspects, ones more close to my heart. The review by the director was extremely helpful, I really wanted to know what was true and not, and it seems most of it was. It was tragic, really, but so well done. Everyone is so carefully and diligently researched and the acting so wonderful, its hard not to be glad you watched it, sad and wild as Truman Capote was.",1180742400,4,613,4.159663865546219
1572469,5,B00005JPB0,"Which is really saying something, seeing as the other Capote-related film I saw this week (I forget the title) won a bunch of those Golden Award Statuette Thingies (including Phillip Seymour Hoffman for his slick portrayal of the Tru-man himself).  But seriously, how ticked off must writer/director Douglas McGrath have been when he found out That Other Film was going to hit theaters first, relegating his outstanding piece of moviemaking - which chronicles the exact same period of Capote's life - to the status of sloppy cinematic seconds?  I listened to the entire commentary track hoping to get some info on this, but Mr. McGrath was all class, never mentioning a thing about it (could it be no one has had the heart or the nerve to tell him yet?).  Regardless, I find ""Infamous"" to be the more emotionally satisfying and flat out better biopic for many reasons.

First, McGrath and lead actor Toby Jones had better source material from which to mine this particular mix of truth and speculation; for instance, McGrath's friend (and sometimes creative conspirator) Woody Allen introduced him to Dick Cavett, who let Doug and Toby have total access to the decades of tapes of Cavett's talk show, upon which Capote himself was a frequent guest.  Also, Toby's godmother works at a New York City library and through her got to see all of Capote's ""papers"" - actual notebooks written by the man himself, including the one he took to killers Dick Hickock and Perry Smith's final hearing.  To me, these materials, along with the George Plympton book from which the screenplay is adapted (along with Capote's own In Cold Blood, of course), made for more sturdy script construction materials than the Richard Avedon photos, anecdotes and bios that were use to make That Other Film.

In addition, McGrath grew up in Midland, TX but has lived in New York City for twenty-six years, so he was/is very comfortable and skilled when it comes to writing about both the small-town Midwest setting in which the ""Cold Blood"" killings occurred as well as that of the bigtime socialite scene of the Manhattan elite.

Add to all that the fact that McGrath is no stranger to adapting great novels for the screen (he previously wrote screenplays adapted from Jane Austen's Emma and Charles Dickens' Nicholas Nickleby), and you can see why this was the more charmed and charming Capote project from conception to completion (except for that pesky release date, that is).

Oh, and have I mentioned the acting?  Well, funny thing about that.  You would think That Other Film's acting duo of Chris Cooper and Catherine Keener would blow away this movie's more tepid-seeming tandem of Jeff Daniels and Sandra Bullock in any movie, but the latter pair actually make it a close contest by turning in strong performances as the ""foxy"" Alvin Dewey and voice-of-reason (and Pulitzer Prize-winning author) Nelle Harper Lee.  Dazzling luminaries from Gwyneth Paltrow to Sigourney Weaver and Isabella Rossellini add cinematic sparkle to smaller roles as the Manhattan social stars who populate Capote's New York universe.  But the real star of the show is ""New Bond"" Daniel Craig, all but completely transformed behind dark hair and contact lenses, in a powerful and chameleonic command performance as the doomed killer/artist Perry Smith.  Such a potent mix of ferocity and sensitivity, his raw and revealing portrayal is the best (and most surprising) thing about the film.

But the screenplay, as I may have mentioned, is also something really quite special - McGrath exhibits tremendous affection for both source material and subject but certainly doesn't pull and punches about the book or the man.  In his director's commentary, he describes the adaptation of any book to the screen: ""you take an engine apart and then you have to put it together inside a smaller car"" ""and when you take it apart - boy, you see how really good they (the authors) are, and how carefully they construct, and how artfully they put their story together.""

McGrath displays an almost equally skillful craft in the words he chooses and uses.  The movie itself is structured like the book In Cold Blood (for example, we learn about the crime early in the novel, but don't actually ""see"" the crime until much later).  And the movie's tonal arc mirrors the true-life arc of Truman Capote - it starts out full of boisterous bombast and uproarious joie de vivre (p.s. I have no idea how factually accurate the dialog is or isn't - and frankly I could give a rat's rump, because it's so well written and I was enormously entertained), but then slowly there is more and more sadness until the gloomy and bitter end.  The film's score does an exceptional job in, er, underscoring this tonal transition, as it too moves from a delightful jauntiness, through spare and spacious emotional (and cinematographic) moments, to the more mournful moments at the closing stages - a fantastic job by Rachel Portman, here.

Toward the end of the film, Harper Lee offers one of her many ""testimonials"" to Truman: ""One must remember that at the center of any bright flame there's always that little touch of blue.""  Such is an apt description for the movie itself - it burns brilliantly before flickering and fading to its sad finale. But its warmth and beauty will linger in your memory long after the credits roll.  So if you can only see one Capote-related film this week (or this year or this lifetime), I strongly recommend this one.",1179100800,12,5469,4.8886486486486485
1572470,4,B00005JPB0,"""Infamous"" will forever after be compared (unfavorably by most) to its immediate predecessor, ""Capote"".  Without dissing the earlier movie, or Philip Seymour Hoffman's Oscar-winning perfomance, and having seen both, in the same weekend, I much prefer this one.  ""Capote"" may be the more ""important"" film, if self-consciousness & a complete lack of humor are virtues.  I feel quite certain that Toby Jones will not get a call from Oscar for this role.  The Academy prefers to pass out statues for acting only when heavy lifting is involved, and evident to all watching. Mr. Jones is a dead-ringer for Capote in build and coloring, and so effortlessly does he inhabit the diminutive shoes of the writer, you forget that this is an actor playing a role, and that you aren't actually being regaled by Truman himself.  You could never say the same for Hoffman, who wisely opted for restraint in his portrayal, given that he is twice the real Capote's size.  Not so Jones, who pulls out all the stops in giving us Capote's outrageous dress & flamboyant manner in a way that Capote's contemporaries might have viewed him.  And he gets away with it.  What might have appeared cruel camp on a larger man rests easily on Jones' narrow shoulders.  Whereas ""Capote"" is more effective at giving us the interior deterioration of Capote, ""Infamous"" is superior at painting the complicated and agonized relationship between the writer and Perry Smith, aided by an outstanding performance by Daniel Craig as Smith.  Both films are outstanding in their production design, but unlike ""Capote""'s elegiac, almost Homer-like landscapes, ""Infamous"" excels at giving us the Technicolor glitz of the late '50s, and making us feel that sense of (often cheesy) place, accompanied by some great Rat-Pack style tunes.  And the film is redolent with humor, usually tied to Truman's penchant for women's outerwear and the flustered locals of Holcomb addressing him as 'ma'am'.  This film gives us more of sense of how much joie de vivre Capote had, and how much fun he could be until things went off the rails.  It is not the complete story by any means, but it gives us Truman as others saw him.  The Hoffman version gave us Truman as he perhaps saw himself.  This is an affectionate portrayal of a character who will never be duplicated, but Toby Jones comes as close, perhaps, as another guy can get.  I think both versions can be enjoyed on their own merits, but whether you adored ""Capote"" or were nonplussed with it, ""Infamous"" deserves a look.",1177372800,2,2519,4.891764705882353

The movie is done in an artistic manner, and shows the shadow side of this very complex and ""slightly vicious"" writer. Truman Capote was in essence a true user of information for his own benefit, and lost all his abilities after his involvement with Perry (one of the murderers) from his novel/account In Cold Blood. Truman is shown in this movie in all of his dimensions, and every one is portrayed humanly, humorously and with tremendous artistic value. I would recommend anyone who is interested in this writer, and saw the previous film ""Capote"" to watch this extraordinary film.

The movie focuses slightly more on the writer who became obsessed with his Kansas story and seems to sell his soul in the writing of it, rather than a full focus on the horrible event. Sandra Bullock also does a phenominal job with the role of Nell Harper Lee. Very well done.

1572473,3,B00005JPB0,"The 'other' Truman Capote bio film, which came on the heels of the successful Oscar winning ""Capote"", also examines Capote's non-fiction writing of the slaughter of the Cutter family, and his relationship with the killers. Toby Jones, as Capote is more extravagant, more expressive and feminine than Oscar winner Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance, and there lies here a greater vulnerablity, a weakling inside a wolf's coat, a Capote whose insecurities are clearly evident beneath an exterior manner of confidence and vanity. When he is attacked by one of the killers, (Daniel Craig), in a jail cell, he cowers like a frightened child, when he reveals his own childhood traumas, in comparison with the killer's, all masks and manipulative attitude disappears, as if revealing a real person, without pretension for the first time. I don't know why there was a sudden interest in Capote writing In Cold Blood, the groundbreaking true crime book of 1966, but both movies, while attempting to present a character study of Capote, are overshadowed by the sensational and brutal murder of the Cutter family. It's difficult to access Capote's psychological struggle while the hunt for the killers carries on off-screen, as Capote and his New York literary friends sip wine and chat with the enamored townspeople, who after a silence campaign, accept Capote as an eccentric oddity they enjoy rubbing elbows with. I liked the nostalgic New York cocktail party scene, with literary art types learning how to do Chubby Checker's The Twist. It is another world compared with the bleak empty Kansas farmland where the murder occurs. The dialogue with the killers seemed at times, to be coy and unconvincing, as they find reason to put trust in the New York writer in a feminine fur coat, with the nasal muted voice described here as ""if a brussels sprout could talk"". It takes only a few manipulative and pat tricks from Capote to gain their trust, one being his familiarity with Marlon Brando. The two Capote movies are surprisingly alike, covering similiar ground, making sly mention of Capote ally Harper Lee's next novel after To Kill A Mockingbird, which was, and is still, unfullfilled, but both films accept the sad murder of the family as merely a  sub-plot to reveal Capote as a troubled man, and neither films compare to the original writing and the 1967 film by Richard Brooks, which too reveal the writer as deeply affected by his relationship with the doomed killers.",1176336000,5,2470,5.024390243902439
1572474,5,B00005JPB0,"If you think Capote was the only store, try seeing Infamous:  different cast with the same slice from Capote's life.  If Capote was the nice, sophisticated version, Infamous is the down-and-dirty version.  While none of us really know what happened in that jail cell between Perry and Truman, Infamous gives a fleshed-out version of what they think happen.  Toby Jones' reading on this part is fascinating.  And Sandra Bullock is just incredible.",1176163200,,446,5.138888888888889
1572475,4,B00005JPB0,"Unfortunately ""Infamous"" will always be remembered as ""the other Capote movie"".  It's a shame because this movie is very good, and definitely worth seeing.  However, it looks like it was too soon for its release; it was shunned in the theaters.

The movie does a very good job of capturing atmosphere, not only is its sets and costumes (which definitely evoke the period) but in the way the camera frames shots and moves throughout the film.  Director Douglas McGrath moves the film along at the perfect speed, allowing the audience time with Truman, and Nelle.  He also controls the mood of the film, letting us laugh and scoff at Truman's antics with his rich friends.  However when things need to get serious, the film turns slowly into a tragic image of a man being destroyed by his desire to create.  The only moments where the film falters is during a series of fake documentary interviews.  They serve to pull us out of the movie, instead of pull us in (as I suspect they were intended to do).  The score is solid, adding to the scenes, but not standing out in any way.

In a movie like this performances are key.  Praise must be given to Toby Jones who seems to inhabit the character.  From the moment he is on screen, I believed that I was watching Truman Capote and not an actor portraying him.  Toby is able to make Truman likable, annoying, cold, kind, and desperate whenever he needs to, and in a completely believable way.  Also surprising is Sandra Bullock as Nelle Harper Lee.  Sandra's performance is very natural and provides the perfect foil to Toby's performance.  I also enjoyed Daniel Craig as Perry Smith.  His intensity served him very well in the part.  The supporting cast was just as good providing many familiar faces in key parts.

""Infamous"" was a good evenings entertainment.  While the first half of the movie comes across as light and almost fun, the second half becomes more and more serious.  If you have any interest in Capote's work on ""In Cold Blood"" then I definitely recommend it, even if you've already seen ""the other Capote film"".",1174521600,4,2073,4.65564738292011

However if the quality is as high as this then that is no problem. This film is more sympathetic a portrait of Truman Capote with a cast and script of a higher standard. Daniel Craig is electifying as one of the murderers and worth the cost alone. The film has not had a lot of publicity but do not let this put you off - its one of the best.",1174521600,,498,4.144329896907217
1572477,5,B00005JPB0,"While Capote director Bennett Miller constructs a psychological analysis of the outrageous Breakfast at Tiffany's author Truman Capote's Faustian trail leading to the masterful crafting of the first true crime thriller ""In Cold Blood"", in ""Infamous"", director Douglas McGrath explores Capote's motivation on a more personal level.  Both films tell pretty much the same story; both lead actors, Toby Jones in this offering and Philip Seymour Hoffman in ""Capote"" submit first rate performances.  The difference lies in how each director accounts for Capote's ultimate later dysfunction as a writer and ruin as a human being.

""Infamous"" is told as a part docudrama where famous personages like Vogue's Diana Vreeland and ""To Kill a Mockingbird's Harper Lee interject their impressions of Capote to the audience while the actual events leading to the creation of ""In Cold Blood"" unfold in a quasi-chronological order.

The strength in this version of the ""In Cold Blood"" conception story is in the details.  Daniel Craig depiction of Perry, one of the murderers, blazes with an internal sexual intensity that leaves little to the imagination as to Capote's dilemma with wanting to have the perfect circular ending to his story and not wanting his relationship with this man to end with his execution.  In ""Capote"", actor Hoffman, as the titular lead, speculates that with their similar backgrounds and underpinnings and the absence of his writing as an outlet, he could have become Perry, but in ""Infamous,"" the audience needs not Capote's voice to provide an explanation.  Director McGrath forces us to watch the chemistry between Perry and Capote; we watch Capote deteriorate as he lies and manipulates to get the best story, all the while loosing his own needy soul to another.  ""Infamous"" not only recreates that late 50s - early 60s period of Manhattan splendor, but allows one entry into the conniving yet thoroughly human mindset of one of America's great writers.  McGrath weaves falsehoods with veracity, twisting Capote's intended creation with the brutal yet less dramatic actuality----his execution scene reeks with an unsentimental matter-of-factness as Capote relates to his society friends his manufactured perfect ending while in reality he runs in pain as Perry is hooded and prepared for death.  One of its most poignant and compelling moments occurs when Capote, after Perry's hanging opens up Perry's personal effects and discovers a pencil drawing of himself entitled, ""Friend Truman.""  Capote is depicted as friend, lover and conniving user.

Bottom Line?  This version of the ""In Cold Blood"" story is well worth expending the 118 minute playing time.  If you enjoyed Capote and want to re-explore the story from another perspective, check this one out.  Highly recommended.

The depiction of Capote is so much more real to life thanks to an absolutely marvelous acting job by Toby Jones (Painted Veil, Amazing Grace). Jones miraculously channels the soul of Truman Capote. There's humor. There's sadness. And there's a depth the 2005 version did not have. If you haven't seen Infamous, you're missing out! I pre-ordered the DVD so that I could have it in my collection as soon as possible.",1173830400,2,483,4.831325301204819
1572558,4,B00005JPB0,"Comparing Infamous to Capote is inevitable, not just because they are both about Truman Capote, but they both center around the period in Capote's life when he was writing In Cold Blood, and his relationship with the Dick Hickock and Perry Smith. (Not to mention the fact that they came out only a year apart). For all their similarities, the two movies are very different. Infamous focuses much more on the bouyant gabbish lifestyle Truman carried on, gossiping in restaurants with various friends. Also, an intense relationship develops between Perry and Truman that many historians question, and which ""Capote"" made no mention of.

Toby Jones is brilliant as Capote, so much so that it's hard to imagine that he is not actually the little, flamboyant man brought back to life to play himself. Jones probably would have gotten much more acclaim for his portrayal if Phillip Seymour Hoffman hadn't already won the Oscar for the role. It's hard to get the public interested again in after such critical success of the first.

At times the interview technique employed to provide background on some scenes is a bit awkward. It doesn't seem to flow with the rest of the film, but seems more like a faux documentary aspect of another script. Other than those sequences, the film flows remarkably well. Flashing from Kansas to New York, fancy dinner table to prison cell, Capote is constantly atwitter about his new novel. Slowly it begins to dawn on him how intense the situation really is, and how painful it will be for him to see the killers hanged for their crimes.

Although the film isn't terribly memorable, it's worth watching. It's every bit as good as Capote, and offers much more comic relief than the first movie. The DVD really has no special features, besides a feature-length commentary by director Douglas McGrath.",1173830400,3,1827,4.906148867313916

This movie didn't, (unless you count the speculation of a sexual relationship between Capote and Smith) but that is, in my opinion, purely speculation.  It did however, bring out the personality of Capote better  than anything else I've seen. Toby Jones is SUPERB!!!!! It shows his rather childlike charm (and pevish childish self-centered traits).  It does an amazing job of that.  What it didn't deliver (and what ""CAPOTE"" did), is the serious, sinister atmosphere that a movie about a mass murder SHOULD have.

I watched it all the way through, then watched it again with the director's commentary on, and then watched it again 12 hours later.  This movie is like getting too close to a waterfall --- you know there's danger, but the spectacle keeps drawing you closer.  I adore Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and applauded his Oscar, but this is the film I'll watch over & over again.  The overlapping circles of Truman Capote's varied worlds during the writing on In Cold Blood makes the film moving for me.  In NYC with his ""swans,"" travelling with Harper Lee (before To Kill a Mockingbird had been published, so that she was the unknown writer), the dinners and lunches and arm wrestling contests of small town Kansas, and the claustrophobia of the prison, all with their different rhythms and customs, accentuate the singular figure of Capote.  His character remains the same:  he expects the world to accomodate him, and surprisingly, it does. Definitely on my top 10 list of movies.",1172966400,5,1083,4.917582417582418
1572561,5,B00005JPB0,"Having been a Truman Capote fan for many years, I couldn't wait to see this film.  George Plimpton's book, for which this movie was based upon, first introduced me to Truman years ago when I picked the book up in a bookstore and couldn't put it down.  Although I have yet to experience such a life, I think I see a lot of myself in T.C.  Demeanor. Deep southern background.  Yearning for acceptance.  A love for writing.  The voice even.

I took a day's vacation from work to see the movie CAPOTE in the theater a few years back.  I thought Phillip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman was a good imitation and honest.  A much deserved Oscar win. But that movie was more about what the book did for Truman as a writer, and it was the shell of how he went about writing it, putting Holcomb Kansas on the map.  As discussed in Plimpton's book, this story was much more personal to Truman.  It made him, and it broke him.  The movie, Infamous, is about nothing but this raw and true feeling that Truman (both the writer and the human) experienced during those years.  I embrace this movie for daring to go there.

Just like the book, Infamous offers up snippets of interviews of those who knew Truman well...Gore Vidal, Jack Dunphy, Harper Lee.  Think of it as if you were at a cocktail party and going room to room overhearing bits of conversation.  The movie is laced with such dialogue to keep the story moving along beautifully.

Toby Jones IS Truman, and makes you quickly forget how good Hoffman was.  The storyline does a great job at showing you how Truman was looked at as an eccentric outcast, and how he probably stuck out like a sore thumb in Kansas.  But people came to like him; they warmed up to him.  He was the life of the party.  This movie shows Truman the clown, quick with a catchy one liner, everybody's friend...but by the end it opens Truman up a little.  You see his feelings, his ""tru"" character, his heart.

The relationship he had with Perry Smith is also treated honestly.  I believed it.  It's exactly what I had taken from the book.  I want to believe that Truman fell in love with Smith.  I want to believe that maybe Smith loved him back.  Maybe they shared a kiss.  There is proof of their letter writing, but not much else.  So forget about ""for the record,"" and take away what you too want to believe.

One other interesting story that neither movie goes into is that supposedly Truman bought the two prisoners gravestones which were quickly stolen.  A few years ago those gravestones were recovered and are on display in a museum in Kansas.  That's not important to my review, but it is interesting.

If you are a TC fan, or just a fan of southern literature, set aside some time to devote to this film.  It is a haunting story, that today in the age of the internet and computers, we may never experience in society in such a way again.  Truman was an infamous writing legend in his own, and I would have loved to have known him.",1172880000,5,2965,4.405904059040591
1572562,4,B00005JPB0,"This film delves more deeply into the period in Capote's life when he interviewed Smith and Hickok about the Clutter murders.  In that respect, it succeeds.  Also, Toby Jones, Sandra Bullock, and Jeff Daniels shine in their respective roles, as does the fellow playing Perry Smith.  I don't totally buy the Smith/Capote love affair, so that hurt the credibility a bit for me.  Otherwise, a nicely realized film.",1172880000,,411,5.0
1572563,5,B00005JPB0,"There would be an assumption that in the wake of the critical success of ""Truman,"" that another film looking at the story of how Truman Capote came to write his classic non-fiction novel ""In Cold Blood"" is as unnecessary as was the made for television remake of the 1967 film based on the book that featured the stunning black & white cinematography of Conrad Hall.  But director Douglas McGrath (""Company Man,"" ""Nicholas Nickerby"") is not exactly covering the same ground.  Whereas ""In Cold Blood"" was the story of the 1959 murders of the Cutter family in Holcomb, Kansas by Dick Hickok and Perry Smith, ""Capote"" tells the story of how Capote came to write the book.  The former ends with the hangings of Hickok and Smith, while the latter ends with Capote having attained the pinnacle of success in American letters only to never come close to such heights ever again.  ""Capote"" finds an obvious connection between the two, but does not really provide a definitive answer to nail down the cause and effect.  In ""Infamous,"" McGrath offers a more specific reason for why Capote was never the same after writing ""In Cold Blood.""

One again Truman Capote (Toby Jones) sees an article about the murder of a Kansas farm family, goes off to see how such a horrendous crime affects a small American farm, and decides that he needs to write a book.  Despite the fact that he is like nothing they have ever seen in Kansas, Capote is able to ingratiate himself with Alvin Dewey (Jeff Daniels), the lead investigator for the local policy.  More importantly, when Hickok (Lee Pace) and Smith (Daniel Craig) are captured, Capote is able to interview them the murderers in prison and attend their execution.  Ultimately, it is the relationship between Capote and Smith that McGrath sees as being the key to the mystery of what happened to Truman Capote after writing ""In Cold Blood.""

Of course there is the delicious irony that Capote is being hoisted by his own petard here.  McGrath developed his screenplay not from Capote's novel but rather from George Plimpton's book, ""Truman Capote: In Which Various Friends, Enemies, Acquaintances and Detractors Recall His Turbulent Career.""  McGrath's attempt is justified by a couple of key details in the film regarding what is presented as evidence of Capote's creativity in writing ""In Cold Blood.""  The first is the most repeated line from the book, which is Perry Smith's statement: ""I didn't want to harm the man.  I thought he was a very nice gentleman.  Soft-spoken.  I thought so right up to the moment I cut his throat.""  The film makes it clear that while Smith might have made some comment along those lines, the final polished wording of the quotation was the result of Capote's refinement.  The second key point is when Smith offers an apology for his crime when he speaks his last words at his execution.  Capote is seen in the film urging him to do so, but Alvin Dewey ""testifies"" in the film that Smith said nothing on his way to the gallows.  Your second time through this 2006 film you are strongly urged to listen to the commentary track by McGrath, who shows up to explain and defend his film, and not just to recall anecdotes about making it.  I rounded up on the rating of this DVD just because of his first rate commentary.

There is another irony in that Capote goes to Kansas with his close childhood friend Nelle Harper Lee (Sandra Bullock), since Lee wrote even less than Capote after the monumental success of ""To Kill a Mockingbird.""  It could easily be argued that neither one was ever going to come close, so living on their laurels made a sort of sense.  But if Lee only had one novel in her, Capote had written ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" and other works that suggested a long and distinguished literary career should have been his legacy.  So while it is too bad that Lee never wrote another great American novel, there is much more of a sense of tragedy that Capote was broken by the experience of writing the book for which he will always be remembered.

""Infamous"" is more about the celebrity of Capote, and not just because the film includes ""interviews"" with the likes of Babe Paley (Sigourney Weaver) and Bennett Cerf (Peter Bogdanovich).  Jones' Capote speaks a lot more than Philip Seymour Hoffman did in ""Capote,"" but then I felt Hoffman won the Oscar for key moments of silence in that film (e.g., when he sees the bodies of the Clutters at the funeral home).  Hoffman is 4 1/2 inches taller than the 5' 5"" Jones and this film takes much more advantage of the leading actor's shorter height to emphasize the writer as a strange little man who survives and flourishes in the big world because of the force of his intellect and personality.  The idea of seeing one film rather than the other strikes me as silly because they each stand on their own and even after watching not only both of these films but the original ""In Cold Blood"" (not to mention reading the book), you are still not going to have a full picture of the what really happened and how these people came to be who they were and meet their respective fates.  But you will have plenty to think about.",1172793600,4,5137,4.656699889258029
1572564,3,B00005JPB0,"Comparisons between films on the same subject are usually separated by decades rather than one year, but last year's CAPOTE (2005), starring Philip Seymour Hoffman is now being shadowed by the 2006 release of this film, INFAMOUS. And shadowed is the operative word here, simply because Capote towers both in acting and cohesive story structure over Infamous.

Probably the biggest issue with Infamous is its piecemealing together of the various story threads, giving the entire production a herky-jerky feel to it. Also, taking nothing away from Toby Jones's performance as the effeminate Capote, Philip Seymour Hoffman pulled in a finer performance thanks to a much smoother flowing storyline.

The best acting part in Infamous would have to be Daniel Craig's portrayal of Perry Smith, one of the murderers whom Truman Capote gets close to in order to finish his greatly successful novel, In Cold Blood. A novel that not only makes Truman Capote but breaks him as well, for he wrote nothing up to that standard for the rest of his life. Clifton Collins Jr. did an admirable job as Perry in the film Capote, but Craig stuns and surprises after seeing his gruff debonair-ness in the wildly successful CASINO ROYALE (2006).

Another problem with Infamous is that there are some big name actors/actresses in it if for no other reason than to say, ""Hey. There are some big name actors/actresses in this movie."" Jeff Daniels, Sigourney Weaver, Gwyneth Paltrow, Isabella Rossellini, Hope Davis, and a slew of others lend their names but not much of their talent to the film. A shame, too, as many of them are fine actors/actresses. Jeff Daniels might be the exception in that list, but not by much.

Certainly there are some entertaining portions to the film, especially whenever the social elite reveal secrets to one another (especially to Truman who is their constant confidant) and promise not to spread it around ...and then inevitably do the very moment they get a chance. That was quite entertaining. But, as a whole, the story's script flagged horribly in the end, never really making the viewer care about any of these once vibrantly active people (murderer and social butterfly alike). And that's what helped the film Capote succeed over this one.",1172016000,4,2251,4.994666666666666
1572565,5,B00005JPB0,"Based on interviews in George Plimpton's oral biography of Truman Capote, this well done film offers a somewhat different take on the character we'd already come to know through the previous year's ""Capote,"" which covers the same storyline - the writing of the author's bestseller, ""In Cold Blood."" Toby Jones gives a notable performance that emphasizes Capote's vulnerability - reinforced by the actor's diminutive size - compared to the more arch and self-centered  Oscar-winning portrayal turned in by Philip Seymour Hoffman. While both films show how Capote is overwhelmed by the stress of composing this landmark book and waiting for its publication as the two killers are held for years on death row, ""Infamous"" wants us to believe that Capote fell deeply in love with one of them, Perry, who returned his affection and regarded him to the end as ""Friend Truman."" That Capote never wrote anything of the caliber of ""In Cold Blood"" again and spent the rest of his years in a downward spiral of self destruction is used in the film as evidence that it was the fateful encounter with Perry that ruined him.

Sandra Bullock gives a wonderfully controlled performance as Capote's lifelong friend Harper Lee, who after the success of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" never published another novel and left New York to return to her childhood home in Alabama, where fate provided a much more congenial retreat from the limelight. ""Who knows what the heart wants,"" she remarks sadly at the end of the film, ""and who can defend themselves against it?"" And while the film treats its subject with a certain playfulness, reflected in a mostly cheerful and larky soundtrack, it is finally the story of a broken heart. The DVD has a very cogent and informative commentary by writer-director Douglas McGrath. Definitely worth watching, even if you've seen ""Capote."" Side by side, they demonstrate nicely Capote's own vision of truth as it's found in creative nonfiction.",1171929600,69,1952,5.021604938271605
1572566,3,B00005JPB0,"An unfortunate twist of providence plagued this 2006 film since it was one of two major studio productions covering the same story and completed almost at the same time. The other movie, Bennett Miller's ""Capote"" (2005), was universally acclaimed with Philip Seymour Hoffman's superbly etched performance winning accolade after accolade including last year's Best Actor Oscar. Held back for a year, this version is decidedly more colorful but somewhat more superficial, coming across less as a character-driven study than an unrequited love story between world-famous writer Truman Capote and notorious murderer Perry Smith.

Both movies focus on Capote's investigation of the 1959 Kansas murder of the Clutter family and the two young men convicted of the crime, Smith and Richard Hickock. Director/screenwriter Douglas McGrath places greater emphasis on Capote's celebrity-filled social circle in Manhattan by using them as a narrative device to move the story along. The other major difference is how the relationship between Capote and Smith becomes less about the author's singular ambition to get his story than how two disparate men find a common bond in their mutually repressive situation. The author's compassion for Perry contains a deeper sense of longing in McGrath's version, and the feelings are reciprocated with surprising candor by Smith.

Yet, the whole venture falls short because the star-studded cast and smart production values cannot compensate for the hollow ring at the core of this film. We are never really privy to Capote's creative genius, nor does his resulting book, ""In Cold Blood"" feel palpable beyond passing references. There is certainly not a lack of effort here, as character actor Toby Jones is far more of a dead ringer for the real Capote than even Hoffman. At the same time, the startling accuracy of Jones' cadence and mannerisms still cannot match Hoffman's pained gravitas in the role. Prior to becoming the current 007, Daniel Craig impressively conveys the tender and terrorizing sides of Smith with equal aplomb. As author Harper Lee, Sandra Bullock submerges herself into the quiet role of a low-key confidante who keeps Capote on his toes. Jeff Daniels effectively plays the taciturn D.A. Alvin Dewey, although the overall portrayal of the star-struck townsfolk feels overly patronizing.

The remaining star turns amount to extended cameos and frankly a marginal waste of stellar talent - Sigourney Weaver as Babe Paley, wife of CBS chairman Bill Paley; Hope Davis as Slim Keith, who was married to director Howard Hawks and agent Leland Hayward; Isabella Rossellini as socialite Marella Agnelli; Juliet Stevenson as Vogue editor Diana Vreeland; and in the opening nightclub scene, Gwyneth Paltrow as Peggy Lee (whose name has been changed to `Kitty Dean' in the movie). The late 1950's period look of the film benefits from expert, unobtrusive work from cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel, production designer Judy Becker, and costume designer Ruth Myers. Thanks to the exhaustive research he conducted on his subject, McGrath contributes an informative commentary track on the 2007 DVD, the only extra beyond the original theatrical trailer.",1171843200,10,3191,5.390781563126253

The supporting cast was sublime, in particular Sandra Bullock who I usually have as much use for as a lash underneath my eyelid.  The sets, costumes and make-up were all transportive to the Park Avenue social scene where Capote held court.  Have watched it multiple times.",1515974400,,388,4.818181818181818
7941898,4,B00005JPB0,"Watch this, watch Capote, watch the orig In Cold Blood,  will give you a good idea of the whole story about Capote, his relationship with Harper Lee, and his writing of ICB.
In the book To Kill a Mockingbird , Scout (the protagonist/narrator/author )is a young Harper Lee, Dill is Capote .
In Cold Blood was Capote's last completed work; his relationship with Perry Smith and the depressive nature of producing and finishing (Perry had to die) what Capote considered would be his greatest literary achievement proved to be  too much for Capote to was absorb;  Capote died within a few yrs of finishing the book,  of alcohol related health problems",1514937600,2,647,4.801801801801802

7941900,5,B00005JPB0,"In my opinion CAPOTE was quite a good movie, but this INFAMOUS was better.  Starring Toby Jones in the Truman Capote role with Sandra Bullock as ""Tru's"" exasperated co-researcher, Nell Harper Lee, this book is enlivened by a wonderful supporting cast, such as Daniel Craig as Perry Smith and Signourney Weaver as ""Babe"" Cushing Paley, wife to CBS magnate William Paley.  This helps set the background of ""cafe society"" in which Capote had immersed himself prior to heading for rural Kansas and the massive research and writing assignment that resulted in the book IN COLD BLOOD, which made him -- and broke him.  Fine, affecting drama with nice comedic touches.",1507852800,11,661,4.990909090909091
