7861539,3,6304061846,"I have owned this video for a few years now and I think it's not too bad. This isn't really a movie, so much as it is a documentary.  It shows fight scenes and interviews of various martial artists. One of the things I like  about this is that you are introduced to some of the lesser well-known  martial artists out there. I was impressed with the skills of most of the  people in the video. It shows a little bit about the younger Jet Li and a  couple of demonstrations and fight scenes. One fight scene is from 'Lord of  the Wu Tang.' Not a bad movie, but it's a little more on the  ""fant-asia"" side. Anyway, if you are interested in seeing new  faces and talent, I recommend buying this.",949622400,8,691,4.181818181818182
