6798054,5,B00PDRZF9G,"I bought this film couple weeks ago. I am a movie collector. I thought it would be just another average indie film. But I was surprised when I saw it. The director Mac Jay brings something new to hollywood, with a great love story with dancing, comedy and action. It's a very funny and positive film, with great messages embedded in the story. The characters are highly relatable to people you know, and experiences you've been through in love and relationship. It's a great must see film!",1423526400,5,489,4.632183908045977
