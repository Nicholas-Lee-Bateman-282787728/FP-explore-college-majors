1267380,5,B00003CXL4,"I just watched this film for the first time.  I laughed; I cried.  It became a part of me.
I had always assumed the ""facts"" about  the fall of Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker were true and simple.  This film at  least raises questions about the consistantly unchristian treatment of the  Bakker's by their tele-evangelist cohorts.
For me, any film that further  demonstrates that Jerry Falwell will burn in hell is sufficently  entertaining to justify the purchase, but this film has much more.  Seeing  inside Tammy Faye, one discovers that she is a good woman with a good  heart, but little if any self esteem.  She was way ahead of her time (ahead  of where most of her former cohorts are now) on social issues.  Her fragile  self-esteem was trampled upon again and again.  (The clip of Tammy Faye on  the PTL Club television set stoned on Ativan and trying to wade in the  water, which has been painted on canvas, is precious.)  I ALMOST feel bad  laughing at it all, but Tammy Faye has herself done what she suggests  others do with the lemons dealt her in life: .. yeah, make lemonade..  <eyes roll>
The film's irony is poignant throughout... RuPaul, who  wears less makeup than Tammy Faye, provides an even narration of the film.  A look at the Bakker's son shows exactly what one would not expect.  Jim  Bakker's ""victim's"" comments about the depravation of her  innocence are spliced together with tasteless, raunchy scenes from her  Playboy video.
Tammy Faye should be admired-- probably not for her  fashion and makeup prowess-- but because, in spite of getting knocked down  again and again and again, she always gets back up and remains true to  herself.
If you are not convinced to buy this film already, then do so  for the answer to the question of the ages: What do roaches, Tammy Faye,  and Cher have in common?",966124800,21,1823,4.632075471698113
1267381,5,B00003CXL4,"Tammy Faye Baker, who took up more than her fifteen minutes of fame throughout the excesses of her then-husband Jim's PTL digressions, always  struck me as pathetic and possibly manipulative; her mascara-stained eyes  seemed to become water-works like an actress who is able to cry on cue.  This affectionate, albeit skewed-in-her-favor documentary paints a portrait  of the woman that surprised and charmed me.  With a campy sensibility, and  obvious gay humor, this film exposes facts about Tammy's human fraility,  her early embrace of homosexuals (particularly the scourge of AIDS in its  earliest days), her naivete and ignorance of much of the politics of her  husband's empire, and her ""simple country girl"" heart.  Her  present-day tears created a true hush in the packed house, and stirred more  than a few hearts.  Tammy Faye may be seeking the limelight because that it  is a place where she feels at home -- but in the final moments of this  riveting, entertaining and engagingly fresh documentary, I believe her  testaments of faith and her renewed sense of priorities as never before.  All great documentaries should illuminate their subjects in ways that  inform, entertain, and challenge -- even with its heart on its sleeve, this  one does precisely that, and provides key glimpses into the telegenic power  and real talent that propelled a nation of Bible-thumpers to love Tammy  Faye in the first place.",964483200,9,1422,5.122270742358078

1267520,4,B00003CXL4,"Released in 2000, THE EYES OF TAMMY FAYE  wades through its subjects life from her early days on the revival circuit to her unexpected television popularity and equally unexpected fallall with the full permission of Tammy Faye herself, extensively photographed and interviewed for the documentary.

Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker were the king and queen of tele-evangelism in the late 1970s, when they were able to parlay their Christian talk show, The PTL Club, into first a Christian satellite network and then a Disneyland-like Christian theme park.  But there was trouble behind the scenes.  The couples marriage was in tatters, Tammy Faye had become addicted to prescription drugs and Jim was involved in questionable business transactions.  But they remained favorites  at least until the board of directors was asked to cough up a quarter of a million dollars to pay off a church secretary named Jessica Hahn, who claimed that Jim Bakker had drugged and raped her.  The resulting scandal put Jim in jail and Tammy Faye into a disgraced exile.

But something odd happened along the way.  Tammy Fayes outrageous make-up, bizarre attire, and extreme mannerisms gave her an oddly drag queen quality.  She was also one of the few people in the tele-evangelist community, at one probably the only person, who embraced homosexual men suffering from AIDS, and who exhorted Christians on the subject.  Between these points, she gradually emerged as a camp icon.

THE EYES OF TAMMY FAYE has a reputation for poking fun at a largely oblivious subject, and I found that to be true.  The mockery is often quite brazen, including the use of hand puppets to bridge scene segments and having RuPauls distinctive, drop-dead voice reading narration.  But this is actually rather trivial, for what emerges is a portrait of a surprisingly naive woman of both tremendous sincerity and incredibly bad taste, and whose life was often akin to being thrown off a cliff in the middle of the night during a tornado.

I found the film a little spottyit helps if you were around to remember the Jim and Tammy Faye Bakkers heyday and The PTL scandal that destroyed themand given the fact that she died of colon cancer in 2007, the way the film snipes at Tammy Faye is more than a little uncomfortable.  But it is worth seeing as a testament to the fact that, no matter how artificial someone may seem, there is a real person under the surface.  Unexpectedly touching.

For those of us who ""lived through the scandal"", this DVD is right on the money!  Many of us former supporters always felt that Tammy got a raw deal, and this is a very accurate portrayal of what happened.  Tammy doesn't throw anyone ""under the bus"" but at the same time shows how all of it went down.  She gave her critics (and dare I say ""abusers"": Paul Crouch, Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell) an opportunity to respond/participate in this documentary and cowardly they didn't.  This is also a story of redemption.  I recommend those that have criticized her - that only know of what happened by what they saw in the media - to see this.  Even the reporter at the Charlotte Observer who helped to ""bring down the Bakkers"" participated in this documentary and was rather empathetic towards Tammy in particular.  A very revealing documentary, and very well done.  I promise, after seeing this you will have a more positive impression and respect for Tammy Faye.",1424736000,5,1090,4.630208333333333

1267656,5,B00003CXL4,"Tammy Faye Baker changed my life.  20 years ago, you'd not have heard me utter one kind or sympathetic word about this woman.  I was appalled at the TV evangelists and especially this couple and I can tell you, as a true young 'American', properly brainwashed and believing every word the boob tube spewed at me back then, I may not have joined in the witch hunt but I certainly watched every moment with gusto.
Fast forward a decade or so and my life was falling apart, my consciousness was beginning to wake up and over the following years, when I saw Tammy on TV, I felt different.  I was able to recognize the suffering in her eyes, something I had not properly experienced in my younger days.
Fast forward again to a seemingly insignificant TV show called The Surreal Life.  I was flipping channels and saw Tammy Faye's unmistakeable eyelashes and had to watch.  She took the entire cast under her wing, including Ron Jeremy, the infamous porn star.  She didn't join in their shenanigans or change herself one bit to accommodate all the varied misdeeds and corruptions of her cast mates.  She simply seemed to LOVE them as they were.  I was overwhelmed with remorse after watching the entire season featuring Tammy Faye.  I had judged this lady...and who the H E double hockey sticks am I to judge anyone?  Who are any of us to judge anyone?
My strangest encounter with this wonderful lady came just a few years ago.  I was suffocating in my life, drowning in sorrow after the death of my 27 year old daughter.  I had a dream one night, oh so real.  I was in a salon, a very high end establishment, and the staff were fluttering around me as they washed, cut and styled my hair.  A beautiful young woman came up to me, looked at me in the mirror and with nothing but love and admiration said, 'you know, you look just like Tammy Faye Baker.'
In the dream world, despite my newfound respect and understanding of her, I was highly offended and as I whirled around to face her repeated over and over, 'do you realize that you're insulting me?'  The male owner of this dream salon rushed over to find out what the commotion was about and I told him how rude and thoughtless this young woman had been to me.
And then I woke up.  The spell of the dream world was broken and I knew immediately that I would never be that person again.  In the light of day, what that young girl in the salon had said to me was intended to be the highest sort of compliment...and I had destroyed it.  As I sat on the side of the bed and cried about my heartlessness in this dream, I realized something profound.
I WANT to be like Tammy Faye.  If I could have the kind and gentle soul that she had, the true love of people and the acceptance of who I am as she accepted herself, I would be a very lucky human being, indeed.
I can't wait to watch this film and I'm sure my preemptive review of five stars will stand.",1407110400,7,2894,4.325925925925926

1267760,5,B00003CXL4,"I expected this movie to be either a sensational, supermarket-tabloid, scandal-spewing freak show; or a cruel, cynical put-down - like an extended Saturday Night Live skit with her as the guest host, an unwitting stooge playing herself for ridicule. It's neither.

I'm surprised and delighted to find that - far from being either sentimental or campy, or sensational, OR abusive - this movie treats Tammy Faye with the seriousness and respect she deserves. It approaches her as a person worth getting to know, and it proceeds to let us get to know her.

It's a fascinating movie about a fascinating, one-of-a-kind human being. Underneath the (tattooed-on) makeup and behind the notoriety, she was - all along - a sweet, gentle, loving, extravagantly generous woman, eager to share God's love and (even more important) her OWN love with the whole wide messed-up world.

She embraced gays - with AIDS - when AIDS was still new and terrifying, when all her ""Christian"" peers were preaching that we deserved what we got. She was never afraid of looking like a fool or of confronting her own and other people's flaws; and she never wallowed in resentment or self-pity - after her whole world imploded she got up and she got out and she DID.

I thank the producers of this movie for showing her exactly as she was. The Christians who despise gays are no more hypocritical and evil than the secular people who despise Tammy Faye because she's different.

She fits no stereotype, any more than I fit any stereotype of what a gay man should be. Even at the height of her success she was an outsider at heart, a misfit, an oddball. Just like me. But unlike me she was an open-hearted, inclusive, insanely compassionate and loving person. I admire her greatly, and I love her a lot.",1385942400,2,1771,4.737012987012987

1267835,5,B00003CXL4,"Perhaps I had rented ""The Eyes Of Tammy Faye"" or seen it first on cable it's hard to recall. What's crystal clear is the impact it had on me.

I suppose like most who are as outside of the secular, fundamentalist strong hold Tammy Faye was little more than a cartoon to me, someone to be laughed at for a moment and quickly forgotten. But the joke, if there was one, was most definitely on me.

The documentary succeeds in stripping away the cruelty of the media hype surrounding her - and at the end of the day and certainly by the end of the film you see her as the fearless and forgiving person of both strength an faith that she was in truth and in life. She was uniq ue to say the least and a survivor to say the most.

The film is accurate in the portrayal of how Falwell robbed the Bakers of PTL and shed new light with painfully accurate detail of how Tammy was manipulated and abused by the heavy, greed based hierarchy of Evangelical Christians. Tammy never succumbed - not entirely to their hate driven mantra, instead she remained true to herself and her core beliefs that God didn't create garbage and dirt. We were all, even us LGBT folk children of God. And at that time this was an awfully brave position to take.

The first person to physically hug someone with AIDS publicly. She was fearless and in her own quiet way fighting  against the tainted ideology of Fanatical Fundamentalist Christians by refusing to be bullied -  as a woman and a person of faith. The documentary has it's light hearted moments and I would imagine even the most critical curmudgeon would find themselves cheering her on while falling victim, and happily so to her endearing charm.

Sold out by the men in her life - and towards the end abandoned by Messner himself. Her core beliefs were never shaken. Not her belief in the human condition, her love of people, her fierce individuality and of course her faith. A brilliant documentary that looks without grand standing or squinting into into her daily struggles and the ghosts that haunted her.

The Eyes Of Tammy Faye is bound to open another pair of eyes - your own.",1337817600,2,2114,4.472727272727273
1267836,5,B00003CXL4,"Just like everyone else, I've made my share of Tammy Faye jokes. Just recently in fact. I always thought of her as some after-effect of the Jim Bakker debacle, and never really took her seriously. When I heard she was with Roe Messner I was surprised, as we both used to live in the same small Kansas town (he came through my line at Ed's IGA when I was a cashier, in fact). It was kind of neat to say, hey I know who that is!

I watched this and expected, what, just a light glossing over of her life, maybe some fan-boy lovefest. But, I could not stop watching this. Please know I am as shocked as anyone else may be, I am usually not swayed by documentaries or anything like that. But this, this really showed Tammy Faye as a gentle soul, someone others found easy prey to take advantage of and often did. I didn't know that she could sing, and sing beautifully! And she had a fragileness to her that really made my heart go out to her. Perhaps her biggest testimony to her faith was that she never appeared to be negative about her cancer or blame God, she was gracious in all her interviews and even to the end. Now THAT'S a testament.

I always distrusted and disliked Jerry Falwell as he reminded me of Fred Phelps in his making-Christians-look-bad way. The Oral Roberts slimey fake-Christian kind of way. (To hear Sean Hannity say he admired the man made me barf!) After seeing what Jerry Falwell did to the Bakkers, I had actual disgust in my heart for this snakey jerk! If there is a hell, surely he's in it. What a slimeball!

Out of this whole mess, Tammy Faye emerged as the only sympathetic player in all the drama. I found myself completely changing what I previously thought about her (which truthfully was apparently not based on fact). I found great feelings of pity for how much she suffered in life, and hoping that she is finally at peace. Knowing, the way she forgave and how she was a living testament to her faith, that she is.",1319414400,3,1951,4.354395604395604
1267837,5,B00003CXL4,"I always thought Tammy Faye was eccentric and outrageous (in appearance), and I never really gave her much thought. Due to its award recognition, I decided to give it a shot; I am pleased that I did. Tammy probably wanted to be a performer, more than anything else. Her innate Christian faith was something that was inside her from early years. She was not a phony. Enter Jim Bakker, and she found the opportunity to perform and join her husband (to whom she was very devoted) on a quest of unbelievable proportions. Her admission that she wasn't sophistocated enough for all this attention was from the heart. She wasn't stupid; that label was appropriate for Jimmy Bakker, however, since he allowed himself to be taken down, so mean-spiritedly, by the snake, Jerry Falwell, a truly evil man. There's a lot to be said, and this film says a lot. I'm left with the impression that Tammy Faye was as sincere as can be about everything she did, with or without PTL, and I have new-found admiration for this relatively simple woman who  was nave enough to fall victim to the corporate empire of televangelists. So much for good intentions, but I like the person and I especially like the film for changing my mind about a sweet woman who was a victim of her own circumstances. The film-makers should be commended for not making a circus of Jimmy's indiscretions, though gold-digger Jessica Hahn is presented for exactly what she is. Tammy's pioneering efforts for gay rights is legendary, and I thought that the inclusion of RuPaul's narration might've made Tammy a campy carricature. Again, I was wrong. The entire film is done with respect and dignity, and presents a portrait of a sad, but hopeful, survivor.

1267840,1,B00003CXL4,"My wife and I are children of the 80s, so we remember the PTL scandal. The Eyes of Tammy Faye reminded me why I cannot stand Tammy Faye. Tammy Faye was an awful singer and she loved performing schmaltzy puppet shows. Bad music and bad puppetry take up a lot of this movie. Tammy Faye was interesting only because she got caught stealing from the faithful. Once you got past that, she was shallow.

The Eyes of Tammy Faye is bad. Tammy Faye was old news when she appeared in this film. The viewer watches her dreary attempts at a comeback as she visits a photographer for headshots and unsuccessfully pitches ideas for TV shows. The final impression is that she could not believe that her 15 minutes of fame were over.

The film should focus more on the PTL scandal. Tammy Faye accepts no responsibility for PTL's collapse. One Bakker apologist says that Jim would not have stolen only [...] million when he raised [...] million. Why not? [...] million is a lot of money; perhaps Jim didn't think that he could get away with stealing more; perhaps he had planned to steal the rest of it.

There are interesting scenes in The Eyes of Tammy Faye. Tammy Faye had many setbacks and showed courage in persevering. An AIDS patient appeared on Jim and Tammy Faye's show; it is commendable that they were not homophobes. The film, however, makes too much of this appearance, portraying Tammy Faye as a great champion of gays. Does anyone really believe that the Bakkers could have built their fundamentalist TV network if they focused on the need to be tolerant of gays?

""The Eyes of Tammy Faye"" bored me and reinforced my opinion that Tammy Faye was a vain, shallow crook.",1264118400,6,1665,4.577181208053691

1267843,4,B00003CXL4,"Growing up, Tammy Faye Bakker was the tacky televangelist that wore too much makeup. That was all I knew about her. When she appeared on the ""Surreal Life"", she charmed me with her sincerity and graciousness, and it made me curious enough to watch this film.

I found Tammy Faye Bakker to be a fascinating character. Full of contradictions, like all interesting people are, she seems to radiate an innocent, maternal charisma and down-to-earth charm, which contrasts wildly with her gaudy image and history of opulent living. She's a natural performer who seems completely comfortable in front of the camera; however her greatest talent seems to be her ability to reach out and touch the people around her. Her life is certainly fascinating and full of extremes: fortune, fame, addiction, betrayal, and all the stuff that entertainment legends are made of.

To some, it might seem strange that a documentary about Tammy Faye, a devout Christian and televangelist, would be narrated by the world's most famous drag queen. But as the film progresses, you realize that it actually makes perfect sense, because Tammy Faye IS a drag queen: Larger-than-life, over-the-top, magnificent, melodramatic, gaudy, and ultimately triumphant.",1187222400,3,1227,5.255102040816326
1267844,1,B00003CXL4,"I never knew who Tammy Faye was until 1987 and I was hoping for a good documentary about Tammy Faye but couldn't watch this because of the annoying, obsessive, angry, child-like temper tantrums directed at Christianity in this film along with Rupaul narrating in a raspy, annoying voice used in a way that takes too much of the focus away from Tammy Faye which this movie was about. No cool music accompanies this film.

Tammy Faye obviously was the first to say gays deserve respect and compassion but obviously after looking at these comments, it was not enough simply because she still clinged to her faith up to the end.

That's right she said it before any non-religious talk show host did.

Tammy was famous for her big make-up during the mega glam days of the 1980s where most women in the media were made-up a lot and obviously she impressed enough people resulting in a lot of cross-dressers worshipping her.

Something about Tammy made it clear she was a cool, compassionate woman who was mistreated by the media like no other woman has been. She was a lot more interesting to hear from than the same old media people and if you want to call someone a cartoon charater, look at oprah and her gurl 'friend' gale king.

Sad that Tammy died and never got a chance to do more in the media or recording industry. Pretty scary that so many people went on a shark frenzy when this woman suffered a fall. Tammy had compassion but her haters didn't. Vh1 would have made a better documentary about Tammy Faye than what is put forth here.",1185062400,3,1537,4.534296028880866

It is an interesting film and I am not sure if anyone has commented on how hard these people worked.  That much relentless pressure to perform for your public takes a toll.  I had no opinion other than negative for both Tammy and Jim, but I think they probably did a lot of folks a lot of good along the way. I too, am not surprised at Falwell's behavior...He has no shame.

1267938,4,B00003CXL4,"In ""The Eyes of Tammy Faye"", documentarians Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato explore the life and tribulations of televangelism's biggest star of the 1980s, the ""first lady of religious broadcasting"", Tammy Faye Bakker. Narrator RuPaul Charles takes us back to Tammy Faye's Minnesota childhood as the eldest of 8 children in a fundamentalist Assemblies of God household, through her marriage to Jim Bakker and their many successes, to her life in near isolation in Palm Desert, California, 12 years after scandal and financial troubles brought a dramatic end to Jim and Tammy Faye's broadcasting empire and their marriage. (This film was made in 1999. Tammy Faye now lives in North Carolina and suffers from lung cancer.) Through clips of the Bakkers' television shows and interviews with Tammy Faye, Jim Bakker, their children, Tammy Faye's 2nd husband and Heritage USA contractor Roe Messner, law professor James A. Albert, and ""Charlotte Observer"" journalist  Charles Shepard, among others, ""The Eyes of Tammy Faye"" presents an intriguing portrait of Tammy Faye's personality and values, as well as some insight into the PTL organization that the scandal-mongering media didn't often provide back when everything came tumbling down.

""The Eyes of Tammy Faye"" is sympathetic to Tammy Faye -and her maquillage- which is a nice respite from the often cruel and disproportionate attacks she has undergone in the press. The filmmakers present Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker as more ingenuous than ruthless or greedy -a view shared even by their critics. Their ingenuousness and simple, optimistic nature was a large part of their appeal. And it was a large part of their undoing. Jim Bakker didn't have the sophistication to competently manage PTL's finances, which became increasingly apparent as he tried to construct and maintain the ambitious ""Heritage USA"" Christian resort in Fort Mill, SC. ""The Eyes of Tammy Faye"" comes down hard on the Machiavellian tactics of the far more fanatic Jerry Falwell. Non-Christian observers (of which I am one) tend to lump televangelists in the same category, but the contrast between the ruthless ambition and fire-and-brimstone sermons of Falwell or Pat Robertson and the naive over-the-top enthusiasm and inclusiveness of the Bakkers is stark. ""The Eyes of Tammy Faye"" provides a valuable second look at Tammy Faye for those of us who only knew the scandal. No, she's not clever or tasteful, but she isn't what the secular press or Jerry Falwell made her out to be either.

Its amazing but it can happen, I always thought had the impression of her that wasn't so kind, honestly it was down right mean.  I can say that after watching this, my impression of Tammy Faye is every different.

Yes, she loves to wear crazy wigs, and uses more mascara in a month than I will use in my lifetime.  What I found surprising was that she and her ex husband created so much of the current televangalism movement that we have.  The 700 club, and the TBN, were projects that they helped to create.  Yes, they did run into some financial problems, was it over ambition on their part?  Most likely.

Some good points were brought out about the scandal was that they didn't intentionally deceive, and secondly that was a heck of a lot of work to do for so little financial gain on their part.  One thing that rings clear through the movie is that she is definately filled with love for people, and harbors no ill feelings towards her ex husband.

I walked away from this movie with empathy for her, she has been truly villified, and she continues onward.  I definately recommend this movie to others.  Growing up in the 1980's these stories were definately part of my culture, and its wonderful to go back and see the behind the story version.",1121299200,14,1387,4.438735177865612

Imagine my surprise when I wound up with a new respect for Tammy Faye. She is a survivor, if nothing else. Sure she makes spaghetti sauce with ketchup. But she was one of the first, and certainly the most high profile, Christians to express concern for the victims of AIDS. I loved her dismantling of the rabid Jerry Falwell.

1267943,5,B00003CXL4,"Since the PTL Club scandal in the 1980s, Tammy Faye Bakker has become one of the all time greats of the eccentric pop-culture icons. The PTL financial scandal and Jim Bakker's affair with Jessica Hahn have faded from front page news stories and into a tiny dot on the historical map. Tammy Faye, however, still pops up in pop media frequently enough to be more recognizable than ex-hubby Jim, not to mention the almost forgotten Hahn.
""The Eyes of Tammy Faye"" delivers a well documented history of Jim and Tammy Faye's rise to fame on the TV Evangelist circuit, their fall from grace, and where the dice landed for Tammy Faye. If this were a film exclusively about the PTL scandal, this docu would come up short; but the main focus here is on Tammy Faye the individual. In doing so, the film makers did an excellent job of presenting the most important aspects of the scandal in a nutshell, and giving us a three-dimensional view of Tammy Faye.
Early on, this documentary shows a genuinely sweet side of Tammy Faye, telling of her unhappy childhood, and how the religion she grew up with was just one big monolithic intimidator, threatening the believers with eternal damnation. Instead of Tammy Faye taking this fear into adulthood, she instead turns it upside down, and preaches Christianity to the TV public with compassion. Particularly moving is a clip from a PTL Club episode where she has an AIDS activist on the show; wherein you would often see TV preachers brag that they will cure AIDS victims of their lifestyle and illness, Tammy Faye brings the activist on the show with compassion. They discuss the battle against AIDS, never bagging on the gay lifestyle.
Another reason to check out this documentary is to catch the disturbing info on Jerry Falwell taking command of The PTL Network. Dislike Falwell and his Moral Majority? You will despise both after seeing this account of his betrayal.
Much of the film is presented with snipets of old Praise The Lord Television footage, narration by Ru Paul, lots of funky hand puppets (an explanation for that comes early on in the film) and through the lips of Tammy Faye herself. While the documentary is sympathetic to Tammy Faye, she shows through her own words that she is still in denial about the misappropriation of funds husband Jim tolled. Tammy Faye is eccentric, strong, unethical and sweet, all rolled up into one. All in all, I went away with a soft spot for Tammy Faye, something I have never before had for a TV evangelist.

1267996,4,B00003CXL4,"Directors Bailey and Barbato have crafted an amusing and startlingly informative documentary on the famous Tammy Faye - she of the 'religious make-up'. The complete history of Tammy is resurrected from her childhood to first meeting with Jim Bakker to her current limbo status. The most fascinating aspect of this woman is her resilience. Starting from a scrappy beginning as TV evangelists, Tammy and Jim rose quickly and famously to the top of the religious networks. The PTL recreational park is second to Disneyland!
It's not an intentional site gag to watch her makeup grow more intense with the years. She has survived failure after failure and still keeps on going, running on her fuel from God. Her attitude is nearly obnoxiously upbeat and her refusal to be vindictive is impressive (or is denial a big part of her survival)? Note that the ""Reverend"" Jerry Falwall is shown as more than a villain here, which makes Tammy all the more precious. Regardless, she proves to be a remarkable study and a compassionate person as well. It's difficult to not be impressed by her stamina, but her cheerfulness can be near manic. The directors have introduced a nice spin by having high-voiced hand puppets introduce each segment. The pitch of their voices is not far from Tammy's. This film makes for a nice 'rent', but to own it might be considered sociopathic!

1267997,3,B00003CXL4,"Browsing through Rotten Tomatoes one uneventful evening, I was jolted momentarily when I stumbled upon this movie.  ""An 88 percent approval rating?"", I pinched.  ""Were Jim and Tammy Bakker perhaps judged too quickly during the collapse of their massive empire?  Is it possible that Tammy Faye actually has some cognitive activity working upstairs after all?""
Nah.
I soon realized that the quality of this flick lay in the production of the documentary itself, not the human product involved.  Barbato and company paint a cute and somewhat naive televangelist caught up in a host of scandals, none of which she ever saw coming.  True to its title, the movie is based on Tammy Faye's side of the story from beginning to end with little or no options for other possibilities.
There is a fundamental problem with Tammy Faye and those of her ilk.  The woman reveals no knowledge or even a faint curiosity of the ancient ancestors, culture, or documents of her own proclaimed faith.  Scripture is something to exploit as needed, not research as necessary.  She's not a minister but a celebrity.  The Bakkers never revealed anything otherwise.  That whole crowd, commonly known as ""televangelists,"" practice a kind of top-40 version of Christianity.  It's as plastic as their imaginations, and their TV circus performances are an embarrassment to humankind.
Tammy Faye certainly has nice qualities about her as a person and is clearly quite likeable in her own way.  The movie delivers that trait well.  But many people throughout the world possess wonderful qualities without ever getting a crack at the big screen.  The movie impressively unfolds the horrors and tragedies Tammy endured during her career, and certainly no one deserves such torment.  But there are many good people who have been through much worse.  Hollywood has not brought them to the cinema so that we might share in their grief as well.  No one even knows who they are.  They are in fact you and me, and others we all know in our personal lives.
So what exactly is it that makes Tammy Faye worthy of the special attention?  The movie is silent on this point.  It's quite a privilege to casually rake in millions for singing rudimentary ditties and shedding superficial tears.  Ministers?  How realistic is it to identify the Bakkers as some sort of link between human consciousness and sacred deity?  The movie focuses too much on the trees and forgets the forest.
The documentary highlights some of the details of the PTL exploitation by Jerry Falwell.  But anyone familiar with this man will find no surprises here.  Anytime this guy enters a scene, nearly anyone else looks better by default.  According to the report, the Bakkers were blackmailed into turning the empire over to Falwell's rat pack because he got word of Jim's sideline fling with what's-her-name.  This is some crowd we have here.  In his predictable manner, Falwell inserted a dagger into the Bakkers' empty skulls and thanked God for the opportunity.  Isn't he the suave one?  Falwell never fails to leave the kind of sick feeling one gets from a dead-baby joke.  I soon realized that this flick has no protagonist.
One important point in favor of the movie is noteworthy.  The Bakkers' ministry was active during the outbreak of the HIV virus.  With the exception of Billy Graham, most conservative televangelists responded with bitter judgments of condemnation toward the gay community.  Some are well known today for the massive hatred they drilled into the minds of their congregations.  Tammy Faye was one of the very few to insist on reaching out to AIDS victims with genuine compassion.  She stressed that believers needed to embrace and love the gay community rather than condemn them.  But more to the point, Tammy Faye practiced this sermon.  She visited AIDS victims and spent valuable time with them.  For this reason many in the gay community have grown to respect Tammy Faye.  This is perhaps the one quality that makes her different from others of her ilk, and it is a quality worthy of both recognition and respect.
The movie is well made.  It succeeded in gripping my emotion, but not with any earth-shattering revelations of the woman.  Tammy Faye simply is what she is.  The movie suggests that Tammy Faye deserves another chance at fame.  This viewer does not agree that she does.  Nonetheless, The Eyes of Tammy Faye is just possibly her best achievement in the entertainment industry to date.  Believe it or not, there's a real woman underneath all that makeup.",1070409600,17,4523,4.923280423280423
1267998,5,B00003CXL4,"""I think the eyes are so important. I believe they are truly the windows of the soul,"" says Tammy Faye Bakker-Messner.
Since Tammy Faye wears a mask of make-up, including her cherished L'Oreal Waterproof Lash Out Mascara, one finds a soul once you move beyond her eyelashes. Her soul is apparent along with her faith.
Twelve years after the dramatic collapse of the Christian empire of Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker, ""The Eyes of Tammy Faye"" tells, for the first time, what really happened. Tammy Faye Bakker explains what really happened to her and her husband when they lost control of the first and most successful television ministry of its kind.
PTL was the first network to launch its own satellite - ""broadcasting 24 hours a day until the Second Coming"", and the first - and only - to build a theme park, a huge Disney style Christian retreat that Jim built from donations from his loyal viewers. It was called Heritage USA. It's attendance was behind Disneyland and Disney World.
Their fall was as spectacular as their rise. It was the biggest scandal of its day, and one of the big crashes of the late 1980s. The Bakkers found themselves crucified in the court of public opinion for their greed and supposed corruption. Tammy Faye ended up at the Betty Ford Clinic, and Jim was imprisoned.
 ""The Eyes of Tammy Faye"" explores the dark workings of the televangelist industry and shows how Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker were tricked out of their ministry by rival televangelist Jerry Falwell, leader of the moral majority. Falwell, it is claimed, promised help and support, then denounced them, staged a coup, and needlessly forced their ministry into bankruptcy.
From the trailer and teaser, I thought ""The Eye's of Tammy Faye"" would be humorous and poke constant fun at Tammy Faye.  To the contrary, I wasn't sure if it was a documentary or not.
 According to Fenton Bailey, director of ""The Eyes of Tammy Faye,""  ""Well no documentary is objective; the notion of 'fly on the wall' filmmaking is a contrived pretense because it is a scientific fact that the moment one observes something, the thing that is observed changes.  Once you put a camera in the room, the room changes. The camera is less a fly on a wall than it is an elephant in a room, and anyone who pretends or acts as if a camera is not there is doing just that; they are pretending and acting. Therefore the very notion of objective filmmaking is a nonsense.  Especially when you get into an edit room and start cutting because then - like it or not- a point of view is determining what is excluded and what is included.""
""Most award winning documentarians have a definite agenda, and/or point of view, this is rarely challenged because their agenda or point of view aligns with the politically correct opinions of their audience and their critics,"" explained Bailey.  ""This is perhaps, where we have failed and hopefully we will continue for the rest of our careers.""
Besides her eyelashes and make up (which most of it is permanently tattooed on), Tammy Faye's faith is the makeup of her life. If more so-called Christians would follow the scripture in Luke 6:37 like Tammy Faye,  ""Stop judging others, and you will not be judged. Stop criticizing others, or it will all come back on you.  If you forgive others you will be forgiven,"" we would have a truly spiritually diverse world.
Tammy Faye shares with the audience her favorite scripture, which is Psalm 91.
""Those who live in the shelter of the Most High will find rest in the Shadow of the Almighty. This I declare of the Lord: He alone is my refuge, my place of safety; he is my God, and I am trusting him. For he will rescue you from every trap and protect you from the fatal plague. He will shield you with his wings. He will shelter you with his feathers.  His faithful promises are your armor and protection. Do not be afraid of the terrors of the night, nor feel the dangers of the day, nor dread the plague of the day, nor dread the plague that stalks in darkness, nor the disaster that strikes at midday...""
""The Eyes of Tammy Faye"" is not a  right-winged religion focused documentary.  It is not meant to converge the gay community to Lake Washington for a Sunday afternoon baptismal. It is meant to inform and share Tammy Faye's life.
Tammy Faye has put her life back together.  She even plays the organ every Sunday at her Palm Springs church.
As ""The Eyes of Tammy Faye"" concludes, you her Tammy Faye singing, ""Don't give up on the brink of a miracle.""  After watching this documentary, I believe there are miracles.",1068508800,2,4552,4.63151364764268

You owe it to yourself to see this film!  Find out what kind of Christians Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson and the Crouches REALLY are!  You've judged her before.  Now you can take back everything you ever thought about her.  I did.",1050364800,,511,4.674157303370786
1268001,5,B00003CXL4,"I thought I knew all the facts.  This was, after all, a tale about my branch of Christianity.  Additionally, I had read Jim Bakker's book, ""I Was Wrong,"" and Richard Dortch's, ""Integrity.""  Yet, this film showed me, as never before, how people can cling so tenaciously to faith in the midst of adversity--and even in the midst of personal sin.  It also showed that Tammy has lived up to the byline of their shows, ""You can make it!""
Another amazing aspect is that Jim Bakker participated in the production.  My guess would have been that he would still be too hurt that his wife divorced him.  Yet, he demonstrated true admiration for his former spouse--showing an ability to forgive even what is often treated as the unpardonable sin.
The producers also dramatized the Falwell take over of PTL in a manner that was clear, objective, and yet rather humorous.  I had never understood exactly how that all happened, even after reading Bakker and Dortch's separate accounts.
My one complaint is that the puppets lent a flippant, almost sarcastic tone to a film, that, while light-hearted, also deals with serious issues of human nature and spirituality.  They needed to be there, because puppets gave Jim and Tammy their start.  However, their role might have been incorporated more delicately.",1040515200,,1291,4.912442396313364
1268002,4,B00003CXL4,"Tammy Faye is now someone I admire!
I purchased this as a vague curiosity after reading some other reviews.  I thought these people have GOT to be wrong.  No...it turns out I was.
This is actually a very telling account not only of Tammy Faye, but of televangelism (If you thought Jerry Falwell was evil before...you will see him as Satan Incarnate after viewing this).  I will say that I thought of Tammy Faye as master media manipulator...but after seeing this...I honestly don't think so.
One of the things this documentary subtley conveys is that Tammy Faye is more resilliant than she is brilliant.  I think it's just her natural tenacity that has kept her going and has drawn media attention like flies.  I think she's a person who has a genuine good heart who has just too much naievete for the world of evangellical broadcasting.
Overall, I was amazed how much I had warmed up to her by the end of the film, and honestly gained a whole new respect for her ability to never say die.",1039651200,44,989,4.533707865168539
1268003,5,B00003CXL4,"Who would have thought that a documentary could be such a crowd-pleaser!  This is definitely better than anything you'll ever see on A&E biography or on one of those VH1 Behind the Music shows.
This account of Tammy Faye is perhaps biased in favor of the make-up-loving former first lady of evangelism, yet it works somehow.  We see a more gentle side of Tammy Faye that has often been distorted by media portrayals of her husband's scandals.  You will leave this movie feeling like a better person.  If you are a Christian, then you will probably feel like a better Christian after seeing this movie (being able to see more clearly some of the hypocricy that exists out there in the church as a whole).
Tammy Faye is not perfect or sinless, but she sure is likeable and charismatic in her own eccentric way.  Take a look at this film.  A+",1022198400,4,839,4.52317880794702
1268054,4,B00003CXL4,"Enter the wild and wacky world of Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker's ""Electric Church"", and believe it or not it all started with puppets. Tammy and Jim Bakker are certainly colorful characters, but what makes this movie essential viewing is it shows what a duplicitous slime Jerry Falwell is, as he takes over the PTL Club. This makes perfect viewing after Falwell's flap about who may really have been responsible for the September 11th terrorist attack on the World Trade Center (I laughed when I heard it. Oops the mask slips!). Verification of his most despicable acts comes down to his word against the Bakkers, but all the on-tape evidence doesn't make a strong case for Ol' Jerry. One has to wonder why at a press conference he states, after smearing Jim Bakker, that it's for the best that he not return the PTL Club to the Bakker's if, as he claims, they freely gave it to him? He makes accusations about Bakker being homosexual (no evidence, only Falwell's word) to augment Bakker's shame of getting caught in some not very homosexual acts with Jessica Hahn. Speaking of which, Jessica Hahn gives her side of the story in, yes, a Playboy Centerfold video. She seductively gyrates in lingerie while telling us we should appreciate her personality and not think of her as an object. It's great.  Through out the movie we see Tammy Faye continuously reaching out and being supportive to people ""other televangelists wouldn't even go near"", as well as repeatedly forgiving those who have wronged her. Comparing these acts with Falwell's words and deeds will hopefully give viewers thought as to who are the real Christians. As Falwell stated, ""She's a loonie"" (he can't deny it, it's on record), but better a kind-hearted loonie than a lying, back-stabbing, power hungry, hate-mongering, monster,...say.",1008201600,9,1803,4.930921052631579

She is compassionate, lively, and has one heck of a sense of humor.  Granted the movie was pure classic camp, but what about Tammy isn't?  The movie is very similar to Madonna's ""Truth Or Dare"", except it doesn't try to be more than it is.  ""The Eyes Of Tammy Faye"" doesn't take itself too seriously(any movie with sock puppets and drag queens is pure fabulousness).  And the movie doesn't attempt to make Tammy Faye into something she is not.  She is fierce and strong-just a like a lioness.  Some parts are hilarious and some parts of devastingly somber.

I agree with the other reviewers that you will likely come away  from watching this movie with a more positive view of Tammy Faye  (Bakker) Messner. (And an equally more negative view of Jerry  Falwell!) But this movie is a sad indictment of the shallowness  of the electronic church and the faith of its fans and creators,  and hence as a testimony to Tammy's professed faith (i.e., belief  in Jesus Christ as the Son of God and Savior of the world) - as  opposed to a testament to the woman's practical faith (i.e., no  matter how many lemons life hands you, keep making lemonade) - it  falls quite quite short. I was eager to watch this film after  reading all the positive reviews (and after also reading son  Jamie Bakker's book SON OF A PREACHER MAN - which I recommend),  but I was disappointed.

1268058,4,B00003CXL4,"I knew nothing about Tammy Faye Bakker prior to seeing this film and I was surprised not only at how fascinating her life has been, but also just how fascinating she is period.  The jovial tone of the documentary is really the key to the film for a couple of reasons.  First, it allows us to have fun at Tammy Faye's expense (and besides her make-up, there is still much about her that is worth poking fun at -- the archival footage of the Bakkers hosting a show while Tammy Faye was hooked on prescription drugs is the film's highlight), and her participation in the fun makes it easier for the audience to laugh along.  Secondly, to allow us to look back on her past hardships with so much humour, instead of bitterness, does give the impression that she is one hell of a survivor.  My impression of Tammy Faye before seeing the documentary had been cemented by the mainstream media, which has made her out to be a rich, spoiled and corrupt witch.  So you can imagine my shock as I realized that Tammy Faye had completely won me over by the end of the film.  My immediate reaction to this was that I had been manipulated and I complained that the directors must have felt too much affection for Tammy Faye since the audience was never exposed to the evil side of her character.  However, after considering the film a little more, I realized that Tammy Faye is likely to be too self-unaware and too much of an exhibitionist to actually hide the less pleasant aspects of her personality.

The filmmakers were obviously quite taken with their subject, which gave me some doubts about their objectivity in such matters as Jerry Falwell's role in the downfall of PTL (although I have no trouble seeing Falwell as a villain).

1268061,5,B00003CXL4,"We rented this mainly because we like documentaries and this was supposed to be a good one. I was very impressed, and also moved. I remember not being able to stand the sight of this woman back in the 80's, and being extremely satisfied when the Bakker's empire crumbled very publicly. Maybe I just got sick of hearing about them, and the media did not exactly paint a flattering portrait. I started out this movie feeling pity for Tammy Faye, but began to admire her as it went on. I had no idea she was gay-friendly way before it was fashionable to do so(and even now, I don't think there are too many gay-friendly televangelists), and had no clue that she had a TV talk show with an openly gay co-host. Not to make media headlines for being 'daring', either. With many other celebrities, you get the feeling they figured out, ""Hmmm, gay men seem to really love me, I think I'll use this and cash in on it"". With Tammy it's clear that she is not calculating at all but just a very friendly person with no prejudice. The movie, narrated by RuPaul, chronicles her life, and gives her side of the story of the scandals. There are interviews with her current and ex-husband, and many of her friends, people she worked with, and biographers. The film includes great archival footage of her early television shows (if you think she has big hair *now*, just wait) to her later ones. The movie is divided up into chapters that are introduced with sock-puppets (this is not as ridiculous as it sounds, though the movie has plenty of humor). In one scene Tammy confronts a reporter who wrote a very unflattering, and Tammy says untrue, book about the PTL Empire. This and several other scenes are hard to watch (though it's fun to see the reporter stammer when Tammy asks him point blank why he printed lies about her). In another scene I felt like watching through my hands over my eyes, during a point in her life when she was addicted to prescription drugs, we see Tammy sort of wandering off in the middle of a broadcast to remark on the backdrop, pretty whacked out. When I found out the circumstances that led to her doctor prescribing something to calm her down, I wasn't disgusted but more surprised that she wasn't taking every narcotic she could get her hands on at the time. I remember thinking back in the 80's that anyone who walked around looking like Tammy and carrying herself confidently was out of their mind, or at best, delusional. At some point during the movie- probably a scene where she cheerfully pitches ideas for TV shows to someone probably 20 years younger than her at the USA Network (you get the feeling maybe he won't make fun of her as soon as she's out the door, but it's easy to imagine him having a good laugh with someone he knows later as he tells them about his encounter)- I realized she is just, well, being herself. She knows that her heavy eye makeup is ""her trademark"", and is proud of it. Let's face it, it takes real guts for this woman just to walk down the street when most people consider her a punchline, a cartoon, a freak, or all three. She is not a stupid woman and knows this, but holds her head up high anyway, and carries herself proudly. How many people would be brave enough to do that? I never thought I'd say this, but after seeing this, I have a newfound respect for Tammy Faye. If the film-makers intentions were to have people view the subject of their documentary in a different light, then they did an excellent job, and I don't have any complaints about it at all. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to know more about Tammy (even if only out of morbid curiousity, like I did at first) and loves a fascinating, touching documentary. Be sure to wear waterproof mascara when watching it, though. A note on the DVD-not much in the way of extras, though it does include the theatrical trailer. However, I'd still recommend it wholeheartedly.  ",985996800,6,3903,4.495774647887324
1268062,5,B00003CXL4,"This is a remarkable documentary, not for any other reason than it's indomitably spirited lead.  Yes, Tammy Faye is a cartoon, a travesty of taste (on the dvd it is easy to focus on her fashion, we kept going back to some sort of hat that looked like she was a huge, religious, heavily made up insect....antennae and all.)  But like all good documentaries, it respects it's subject in a way that you come from it with much love and appreciation.  The dvd has no special stuff but the documentary alone has enough for cult viewers, pop culturists and voyeurs to obsess over for months.  There are puppets(religious puppets that they formed from porky pig heads), there is Jesus as Joy, lots of singing, Jerry Falwell(if you never hated him before, you will now) riding down a water slide, narration by a sedated RuPaul...but under all the incredible tack, Tammy Faye emerges as an amazingly passionate, forgiving non judgemental human being.  Her stand considering gay christians and christians with aids is almost revolutionary.  .......also there is a speech she gives at the end, when doing a sermon, which is inspired and forgiving.  It gives you a very different perspective on the permanantly made up miracle maven......This is a documentary that stays with you, respectful, kitschy(love the jim j and tammy faye show), informative and at times confrontative, this is a really fun watch.

Okay, maybe I did think it was a network fluke of camp and glitter when they match good ole Jim J. and Tammy Faye but this documentary explains the marriage of the 2 on the short lived talk show they share.  Tammy Faye has been delicately combating the heterosexist empire that her now foes Pat Robinson and cronies have been building brick by hate filled brick for the past 30 years.  Unlike Linda Carter, Tammy has not been fighting for our rights in her satin tights, but the woman has a heart unmatchable by even the likes of, dare I say, Oprah Winfrey?  Tammy may not have a truth lasso, or an angel network but, her eyeliner is tattooed on (I'm not lying), and those tears, every one of them, are genuine and real. You'll learn, that no one, not even my own mother, has suffered and overcome more times than Ms. Tammy.  Through comical segment headers with sock puppets as chapter announcers, we go into detailed and somewhat comical yet tragic life tales of Tammy and Jim.  Don't get me wrong.  This is Tammy's movie.

The scene where Faye ""challenges"" a local investigative journalist regarding his ""exaggerated"" reporting is disturbing to behold. The journalist simply shrugs and laughs it off, then requests that she sign his book about her and Baker. He should have stood up to Faye with the facts that he had gathered over the years. Faye and Baker stole millions of dollars from their trusting viewers- many of them elderly and vulnerable. Yes, blowhard men like Falwell and Robertson were ""worse"" than Faye and Baker in many ways, but it in no way discounts the sociopathic evil of Faye and Baker's crimes. Her current husband at the time of filming served two years in Federal prison for bankruptcy fraud, and presents as the victim of an evangelical witch hunt. Really? He committed bankruptcy fraud.
