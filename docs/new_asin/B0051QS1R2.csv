4525750,2,B0051QS1R2,Narration is very good. It's good to know that some small details can help solve cases. That's  why it is important to scour thoroughly in order to find things that will be solid  eivdences later on.,1358467200,,199,4.5

4525752,5,B0051QS1R2,"These are just some good shows to have around to watch when nothing else is on but re-runs of all the other programs (or in my case, when you turn the cable off and just don't have a thousand channels to choose from). Nevertheless, it's still always interesting to see the ways some of these criminals end up getting caught by these new scientific methods that people come up with.",1354233600,,381,4.457142857142857
4525753,4,B0051QS1R2,"Forensic Files is an American documentary-style series which reveals how forensic science is used to solve violent crimes, mysterious accidents, and even outbreaks of illness. The show takes a ""whodunit"" approach, making each case a mystery to be solved. Every 22 minutes episode follows one case from initial investigation until conviction, acquittal, or some other legal resolution. Pathologists, medical examiners, police officers, detectives, prosecutors, defense attorneys, friends and families of victims or sometimes even the suspects themselves are all interviewed about their roles.

This set is about Historic cases, cases where the investigators used new forensic techniques to find the killer(s). All 12 investigations are very interesting. Here are the 12 episodes you'll find on this set:

1. Bio-Attack: The 1984 Rajneeshee bioterror attack was the food poisoning of 751 individuals in The Dalles, Oregon, United States, through the deliberate contamination of salad bars at ten local restaurants with salmonella.
2. Cats, Flies and Snapshots: The disappearance of 19-year-old Lori Auker leaves police stumped due to the poor quality of a surveillance tape. With help from NASA, however, digital imaging was employed to clean up the video; later, three hairs that belonged to her cat were found in a suspect's trunk, leading to his arrest and eventual conviction.
3. Chief Evidence: A young suburban couple was murdered during what appeared to be a drug deal gone awry. But police found no drugs in the home of the victims - and there were no traces of the victims' blood on the clothing of the suspects. The victims' dog, Chief, eventually led police to the killer.
4. Drowning Sorrows: A family vacation becomes a nightmare when the wife is found face-down in the lake.  Determining the manner of her death proves to be difficult... until a forensic pathologist uses a groundbreaking technique to discover the truth.
5. Fire Proof: The case of the infamous ""Seattle Arsonist"". Fire is on the doorstep of many in the Seattle area. Can the arsonist be caught before he hits your home? Watch Forensic Files to get the answer.
6. Nice Threads: A young woman studying to be a Christian missionary was sexually assaulted and strangled with a bed sheet. A computer program was invented and used to make forensics history in examining fabric for evidence.
7. Over a Barrel: The investigation into the slaying of an elderly couple is stymied by inconclusive forensic evidence. Years later, however, a scientist discovers overlooked evidence, and makes scientific history in the process.
8. Purr-fect Match: An examination of the first time animal DNA was used to solve a criminal case. In 1994 Canada, on Prince Edward Island, the body of Douglas Beamish's estranged wife was discovered. Authorities linked 20 cat hairs found on her jacket to a cat owned by Beamish's parents, with whom he lived.
9. Reel Danger: When two boys are viciously attacked while fishing in a nearby pond, authorities spring into action. They suspect a group of teenage thugs, but lack solid evidence. It would take the murky waters of a fishing hole to provide clear evidence, and help authorities reel in the boy's attackers.
10. ""Shear"" Luck: The violent death of an Air Force officer's wife outside a Philippines air base is examined, amid accusations of a love triangle involving the murdered woman's husband. Investigators use groundbreaking computer forensics to make their case.
11. Ticker Tape: The murder of a kind and generous man who lived in a small, rural town in Australia. He was killed by brunt force trauma to the head with an axe during a robbery. This case was the first one in the world to use data from a pacemaker to convict the murderer
12. Tight-Fitting Genes: A behavioral profile is helpful in a murder investigation, but it's not a road map to the killer. One such profile caused the Baton Rouge Police Department to search for the wrong man. They might not have made an arrest, had it not been for a DNA picture of the suspect, painted by a molecular biologist.",1352160000,17,4074,5.059523809523809

A must-must see series !,1331510400,11,301,5.711111111111111

I would have given this dvd a five-star rating (as a huge fan of the show) if it had included some dvd extras, but alas, it did not. This set is merely the episodes listed, no extras or any advertisements.

This set deals with historic cases, which simply means that the new methods of evidence collection used in those cases were either ground-breaking or just new ways to use old things.  Many have gone on to become standards for evidence collection when needed in similar circumstances.  It is fascinating to hear how the cases evolved, and to hear from the experts!",1314144000,26,792,4.924812030075188
4525757,5,B0051QS1R2,When I had cable years ago this series had me sitting on the edge of my seat as it still does today.  Great for adults but not children under 15.,1411430400,,145,3.8333333333333335

4525761,5,B0051QS1R2,I chose '5' stars for this 2 disc set of historic forensic cases because the investigations are so thorough. I love how each case shows how circumstantial evidence can make all of the difference in the findings of a case. One great example of that is a cat hair that was on the body of a victim in the trunk of a car. The only thing that lead investigators to know for sure that the victim was in the trunk was a hair from her cat. Anyone intrigued by suspenseful murder mysteries will definitely enjoy this set.,1384992000,,512,4.288659793814433
