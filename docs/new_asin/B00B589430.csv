5556853,1,B00B589430,The trailer and the cover of the film bill it as a Christian Slater action film -- the film starts off extremely slow -- Christian Slater is killed off early -- the plot is dubious at best and there is no tangible explanation for how some of the scenes arrive or conclude,1372118400,,271,4.230769230769231

5556855,3,B00B589430,"Even a low budget film can look good and entertain. Most people don't know that. Most think that if they've never heard of the movie playing at the local multi-plex then it can't be any good. I'll grant you that many low budget films might not equal what you find in the latest STAR TREK installment but there are some that offer some quality made offerings. Sure their roots lie in exploitation but that doesn't mean that the entertainment quota isn't intact.

Such is the case with ASSASSIN'S RUN. Featuring the perennial straight to DVD star Christian Slater in a supporting role it's a decent action flick that offers up ballet as a martial art. Yes, you read that correctly.

Slater stars as American businessman Michael Mason, an entrepreneur in Russia who sees the potential for vast wealth. When some documents come up missing Mason is killed before he can look deeper into just who is trying to ruin his business and take all the money at the same time. Unfortunately ties to the Russian mafia are also in the works and they aren't pleased when they discover the money is missing. The only lead they can find is Mason's wife, prima ballerina Maya (Sofya Skya).

Maya and Mason's daughter is taken away and Maya framed for murder. Sent to prison there is little hope to escape and even less that she will ever be released. Even Mason's best friend and partner Roman (Cole Houser) can't seem to get her out. When fellow prisoners try to make her talk and eventually kill her, she decides the only person who can help her is herself.

Trapped in the tiniest of cells Maya begins a non-stop workout of ballet moves that she can then apply towards combat. The next encounter she has in the yard with the intent of her demise she pirouettes a few facial kicks and takes out her deadliest foe. Having made one friend she escapes and sets out to find not only her daughter but who killed her husband as well.

With only one friend to turn to, someone Mason told her to contact should anything happen, she goes down the path of revenge. Her chances are slim but then again this is an action flick where revenge is the best path taken and almost always succeeds.

The movie offers some interesting fight sequences that are not only well choreographed but photographed well too. We don't get the now standard extreme close up fight sequence but have the opportunity to witness the sweeping blows and kicks that Maya comes up with. Could real ballet become a martial art? Doubtful but it makes for a good movie.

The acting is higher quality than one would expect in a straight to DVD film. Slater offers a commendable though short performance. He deserves better. Skya shows great potential here and let's hope to see more of her.

While this isn't the best movie around you could do much worse. If you're looking for some straight action fare that leaves several lose plotlines lying about then give this one a try.",1369958400,2,2914,4.601156069364162
5556856,1,B00B589430,"So he hasn't some a movie worth anything in some time. Well, he might as well not have. I couldn't wait for this movie to end.",1367366400,,126,3.8846153846153846
5556857,3,B00B589430,"Like any talented individual with potential that does not realizes it, this movie ends up leaving an impression of so much providing so little. Let's see if I can clarify. There are a couple top rated actors in the movie, the main actress was a Miss World winner that was a professional ballet dancer in reality. The story line was that she uses her ballet skills to achieve her goals. Scenery, videography and editing was decent, the angles and colors were brilliantly shot. The dialogue although a little cheesy in the beginning was endearing. So, I though this princess like character was going to be debased into performing her great ballet skills to the hierarchy of mob bosses and powers that be in order to climb the social ladder in a sordid way (like the other side of midnight) in order to gain power over her rivals and reclaim her sanity and self respect after conquering all her villains. That would have seemed more believable than ballet being turned into judo and Kung Fu skills, without any plausible transition, like in the karate kid. Half of the show was very plausible, interesting and respectable, then when she went to prison and the fighting starts, the movie went all down hill. Actually the down hill started when the Slater character just stood by his car trying to plead with the bad guys not to kill him (hardly in character with the  business mogul of his achievements). So you are left with wanting to like the movie but ending up laughing at it for the way it just peters out into stereotypical nothingness. I wanted to buy this movie just based on the grace and beauty of Sofya Skya. But alas that could not overcome the let down of the story.",1367280000,3,1676,4.605351170568562
5556858,3,B00B589430,"I'm not a huge Christian Slater fan, but I recognize he has done solid work over his career. So, with that in mind, I thought to chance the rental, hoping for the best. Well, that plan hit the trash fairly quickly... but it's not his fault. Christian's on-screen time is modest and he's saddled with a one-dimensional role. That left me with Cole Hauser and the real star of the movie... Sofya Skya.

Both actors (Cole and Sofya) delivered good performances with their characters - but whereas Milla Jovovich in the Resident Evil saga was given extraordinary powers by the T Virus, or if you prefer, Angelina Jolie in the Tomb Raider series who engaged in combat training night and day - here, there is no such crutch to help suspend reality for a demure Russian ballerina kicking her way past the Russian Mafia. Admittedly, I found myself liking her character, respecting her sacrifice for the ballet, and identifying with her fears for her life and family - but watching that translate into fighting skills lessened the movie for me. Sure, there is a certain ""fun"" element watching a gorgeous woman kick-ass (pun intended)... and the basic plot is consistent... but it could have been so much more. The Russian roles were the usual stereotypes, the blase attitude of killing for money touched everyone, and the movie should have been extended to wrap up ""loose ends"" rather than providing a memorable line for the sequel. Not sure if they'll pull that off...

On the whole, there were aspects of Assassin's Run that I enjoyed... I just found the writing lacking in depth across the board. Perhaps that is what they believe will appeal to audiences these days. It might have slipped into higher ratings if they had ""lipsticked"" it with big budget special effects and dramatic scenery, but this was produced on $4 Million. So, lower your expectations and take the plunge knowing what your diving into, or maybe use this one for the girlfriend/wife movie night when you can give them a female lead ""B"" action/thriller flick.",1367193600,7,2023,4.810344827586207
5556859,3,B00B589430,"Michael (Christian Slater) is an American business man in Russia. He is married to Maya, a ballerina (Sofya Skya, professional ballerina). They have a daughter (Marianna Khalifman). His position is resented by the Russian Mafia who want him killed because of the way he has ""raped"" Russia. The carnage starts 23 minutes into the film. Maya, uses her ballerina skills in hand to hand combat, eat your heart out Milla Jovovich. The film sets up for a sequel that promises to be better because a certain actor won't be in it.

I liked the idea of the ballerina fighting, perhaps the next reality TV show. The plot or editing appeared to need some work. In spite of the killings, there was no lead up or excitement. Maya spoke very softly and her voice seem unnatural as if it was dubbed. The Russians are all made out to be cold, which translated into a lack of characters. The film just didn't seem to have it together.

I have mixed feelings on the ballet style fighting, a serious waste of artful talent to entertain us lowbrows. What next? Opera stars doing rap? A good film if you need a quick Milla Jovovich fix.

5556860,4,B00B589430,"This movie pulls the bate and switch like many of these B-movies that come out of Eastern Europe. Christian Slater and Angus Macfadyen do not have as much screen time as you want them too and that sour puss Cole Hauser has too much. But unlike most of these movies, the switch isn't that bad. Professional dancer Sofya Skya proves she can carry a film all on her own. There's a strong potential for more movies with the type of dance fighting she does. She clearly deserves a bigger budget and a better script without all the B-movie gimmicks. For me, searching for the good in these types of movies is what makes them so fun to watch. So if that's what you like, you have to watch this flick.

Also, I really enjoyed the absurd American DVD cover. It has absolutely nothing to do with the movie at all. Ha ha!",1367107200,5,810,4.328947368421052
5556861,1,B00B589430,The premise that a 90 lb ballet dancer can kick the bejeezus out of 300 lb Russian mafia guys is CRAZY. Christian Slater should look for different parts.,1367107200,,153,4.5
5556862,2,B00B589430,"""How did two American's wind up in the Russian oil business?"" Maya (Skya) is a Russian ballerina living with her wealthy husband and daughter. Her husband Michael (Slater) is working with a Russian oil firm when suddenly millions of dollars goes missing. The mafia decides to take matters into their own hands and goes after Michael and frames Maya. All she has on her mind is revenge, and the safety of her child. I first off have to say this was nothing like I expected at all. That said this movie has been done a hundred times...most recently called Colombiana. I have no problem with a strong female action hero, I think that is refreshing...but the only reason I think they introduced the ballet aspect is so when she starts to fight it seems legit. Before you question that line...yes, she uses ballet moves to fight. Lots of spinning and high leg kicks to take down her assailants, when that started I started to lose interest and by the end I was just waiting for it to end. This movie could have been so much better but ended up just a little too cheesy and generic for me. Overall, a movie with potential but fell short. I give it a C.",1365984000,5,1146,4.436018957345971

We have allowed Hollywood, to develope an industry propriertary to the state of California, that supports the labor unions involved in the entertainment industry, and it appears we keep those in the unions regularly employed in generating substandard entertainment. Assassins Run was just one of many that talked a good line but was lacking in talent and creative thinking from the writing, through the directing and finally down to the acting. This project along with 98% of what is produced by this industry should never have made the cut to be produced and offered as entertainment to the public.

Utilizing what skills you have but in a different way was not out of the realm of impossibility. It is no different than someone with zero fighting skills picking up something to use as a weapon in order to defend themselves. The story was not perfect, but definitely well-paced.
