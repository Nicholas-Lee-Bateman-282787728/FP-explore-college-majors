8414294,5,B00439928A,"Clancy Street Boys is worth it just to see Huntz Hall in drag. He reminds me of my aunt. It's all part of  wacky sceme to fool rich uncle Pete into thinking the boys are part of Muggs family. This very plot line with be lifted by The Flinstones years later where Barney poses as Fred's baby to impress a rich Taxan uncle. Anyway, it's very funny awtching Glimpy cornered into kissing the rich uncle. Smart Alecks is good too, the boys get mixed up with some mobsters with the usual wacky results. All in all, good clean fun like I remember watching these movies on Sunday mornings on channel 5 in the NY area.",1285027200,,609,4.2956521739130435
