2792438,5,B000O7862S,Great video. Les is the Man. Fun to watch and educational. Les Stroud and Bear Grylls are the dudes of the day. Get it and enjoy,1183680000,,128,3.9615384615384617
2792439,5,B000O7862S,"I purchased this DVD for my husband, as he became a fan of the show on The Science Channel; I never expected that I would become hooked too!  Les is entertaining and likeable, the landscapes are breath-taking, and the show is educational.  Don't be fooled by ""set-up"" shows like Man Vs. Wild--Les is actually ALONE (no camera-man, no crew) and doing it all on his own. Sometimes he succeeds, sometimes he doesn't.  That is the beauty of watching the show.  Watch a couple of episodes, and you will be hooked too!",1182470400,6,512,4.593406593406593

Les Shroud gets dropped off in some remote place with some camera gear and has to survive on his own for 7 days.  He really puts you right there with him.  The shows are generally about him building a shelter, making a fire and finding food.  He uses some random stuff that his production crew has planted in his kit, but otherwise, it's just him and mother nature.

2792441,5,B000O7862S,Survivorman is a great series if you like the real outdoor stuff.  Les Stroud is amazing in the ways he can improvise in the wilderness.  Plus he does all of this while carrying 55 lbs of camera gear with him.  Don't be fooled by other similar shows where the survivor is flanked by a camera crew and there is so much editing that you really don't know if it's real.  Les Stroud is the real deal and is truly a Survivorman.,1181001600,9,423,4.185185185185185
2792442,5,B000O7862S,"Les Stroud is the man!

Survivorman is awesome. This collection is one of a kind. I had seen a few episodes on tv, but wasn't really familiar with the show. I bought this set and love it.

Les takes you through the following adventures:
Desert
Boreal Forest
Swamp
Jungle
Artic
Mountain
Winter Plane Crash
Canyonlands
Lost at Sea

Bonus Disc:
Surviving Urban Disasters

Les carries all his own cameras and supplies. Amazing outdoorsman and adventurer! You will learn things on this dvd that you never would think of.

It was him making speculation after speculation. What little bit of evidence he presents is nothing but garbage. He quickly loses credibility and looks like a nutter. Pointing out silly things and looks like he results to faking it. Sad end for a once reliable show.,1519430400,,411,4.421052631578948

2792459,5,B000O7862S,"This is the first season of survivorman by filmmaker Les Stroud. He is a Canadian filmmaker that has a series of shows that document how to survive in different situations like desert conditions running out of gas etc.

I like that he is alone usually and while there is a support crew many times he can't contact them and they are miles from him.

He teaches things I learned in scouts. How to decide when to stay w a vehicle when to leave an are. He is genuine though as he shows mistakes he makes at times like leaving a favorable location and getting into a worse situation due in part to making assumptions.

I don't usually say a lot about plots as I don't see the point of watching if one knows too much. This one has the most shows later there are less shows but more features.

My favorite episode on this 2 disc DVD he is cast adrift in the ocean. I honestly don't remember the ocean but believe the Atlantic with only himself and a dingy and am emergency inflatable covered survival raft. There is a team that tracks him but I believe they are about 10 miles away.

These are great ones in season one as he is learning his craft a lot still. He does learn in each season on every episode. This one doesn't have the option of play all in the Amazon version but each show is broken into days as chapters.",1493510400,,1313,4.236

2792487,4,B000O7862S,"Great show. It teaches lots of useful survival skills and the host is very down to earth and doesn't do crazy bravado stuff. (No Man vs. Wild; 'you can suffer a heart-attack by falling into freezing cold water. Now watch me as I do what I just told you not to by jumping in a hole through the ice, possibly giving myself a heart-attack!' *Rolls eyes*)

The DVD is great if you like to watch the show repeatedly like I do; Survivorman has a very soothing voice and I've found that, once I've seen an episode at least half a dozen times, its something that can help lull me to sleep when I'm having trouble conking out by myself. It should be noted though that, unlike all DVDs of series that I've ever owned, there is no option to play all the episodes straight through on a disc. I poked around at my PS2's DVD menu and found that it has a 'program' function that allows me to circumvent this problem and a repeat function (this allows me to run the disc all night if I wish to.) So, if your DVD player has similar functions, you should be able to get around that potential hurdle too.

It should also be noted that, oddly, this DVD set also has no subtitles/captions function on the disc. (I was also not able to get captions through my 'ancient' CRT TV's caption function.) If you've seen the episodes over and over like I have (on a streaming service like Netflix that has a captions option on this show) and only have a slight hearing problem (I usually use the subtitles/captions to catch words/phrases I couldn't quite hear) then it shouldn't be a problem. But if your watching it fresh/NEED the captions to get the dialogue, then you're probably going to have to look elsewhere to see this series.

Also of note is that this set comes with a nice surprise; a bonus DVD of Survivorman teaching about urban disaster survival. It covers several scenarios based on Hurricane Katrina; being trapped in a flooded home, high up in an office building, and in a stalled and flooding car. Has good info on what you can use/make with the stuff around you when your totally unprepared. (Note that this disc also has no captions.)

Bottom line: its a really good DVD set. Its a quality show with good information. It has a useful bonus DVD. However, it oddly lacks a 'play all' function programed right on the DVD and has no subtitles/captions. It's a great buy (as long as the two things mentioned above don't affect you) if you're a fan or if you like shows that teach about wilderness survival.",1411257600,2,2491,4.456140350877193

Regardless of your level of bushcraft and survival skills I can positively say that you there is plenty to learn.

2792505,5,B000O7862S,"""Survivorman"" is Canadian Les Stroud, an outdoorsman who goes out into (much) varying locales throughout the world and stays there--alone--for seven days; filming his experiences; and, well...survives.

I first ""discovered"" this show quite by accident.  I was channel surfing one night and caught Les Stroud curled up inside a lean-to surrounded by old, used fuel drums in the Arctic Tundra.

The show just looked so cool.

No pun intended.

BACKGROUND

Les Stroud has said in an interview that he was inspired to make ""Survivorman"" by the show, ""Survivor.""  He said that when ""Survivor"" came out, he said to himself, ""I can do that.""  Starting in 2001, he made a five-part series entitled ""Stranded,"" that was very similar in scope with ""Survivorman.""  He would be in an isolated location and, well,  have to survive.

In 2004, Discovery Channel green lit and broadcast the first season of ""Survivorman.""

SURVIVORMAN

As I said, the premise of the show is that Les Stroud is dropped off by his camera crew/safety team at an isolated location armed with only what he has on him.  He does NOT get anything extra given to him during the week--and he stays at the location--completely alone--for seven days.
It is amazing just how well a job he does of filming himself.  The show never feels like you are watching ""The Blair Witch Project.""  The quality of his filming is that good.

And, the shots he gets are breath-taking.

Les generally will pick a spot he wants to stay at for the night and go through, one by one, all of his belongings.  He then usually sets up a base camp, giving tips all the while, and settles in.  He also hunts for food, in the form of game or vegetation, shows us various ways of making fire, and always gives tips on we should--and should not--do if we ever find ourselves in the same situation.  In cold weather locales, Les always comments on how you have to be careful never to sweat:  ""You sweat, you die.""

Many people, who found themselves in a ""Survivorman"" predictament, have credited the show with saving their lives.

FURTHERMORE

I think I am such a big fan of the show because of just how real it seems.  Les is very honest with his viewers, too.  He admits he does carry a global satellite phone with him in case of emergency; he has a safety camp located not all that far from his location; and that he does prep his location in advance before going in (which plants are edible, which are poisonous).

Also, Les Stroud will struggle with getting a fire going.  Not every show has him making one in just a couple of minutes.  Sometimes it takes a while.  He also isn't always successful in hunting/fishing game.  In many episodes of the series, he won't catch a thing.  Again, this authenticity is why I enjoy the show as much as I do.

I highly recommend it.

PHOTOGRAPHY

Whether it is:

A spooky, mist-filled swamp at dawn; a lush, tropical paradise; night view close-ups of an absolutely miserable Les Stroud in the jungle--sweaty, exhausted and bug-eaten; lively rolling brooks throughout the cold weather--but green--Canadian  Boreal Forest; rail line in the middle of nowhere which seem to run on forever; the sun peeking through the canyons of Utah...

This collection has it all.  Beautifully photographed.

FINAL THOUGHTS

I feel this is the most ""real"" of all the reality shows out there.  It has depth. You can learn quite a bit from each episode. As said, the photography of each episode is beautiful. And who knows?  Watching this show may one day save your life.

My strongest reason to recommend this show, however, is Les Stroud, himself.  Seeing as how he has to carry the show by himself, he succeeds greatly--and is very likable, to boot.

I'm sure that when you check the show out you'll agree.

2792506,3,B000O7862S,"I borrowed this DVD from a friend and if I liked it I'd end up buying it. Sadly it wasn't all that great so I won't be purchasing it after all. First off I give the guy credit for carrying 50-55lbs of camera gear with him to each and every place. He has to set up the cameras and then do the amazing shot of whatever task is at hand and then go back and collect the camera gear. So he is burning 3x the amount of energy he has since he is doing this all on his own. But, while this is great to help understand he actually is on his own it doesn't help much on giving a lot of survival tips. Yes there are some things that are indeed informative but I felt like the entire time he was out surviving out on his own he focused more on the fact that help would come and that he would be in a warm comfortable place soon as the camera crew returned for him/ he found them first. He spoke of how he didn't like to kill unless it was for food. Which I understand for just a show but people who are watching these videos for survival skills should be shown how to make traps or for food. I did however enjoy how he was able to show and admit he may have not known how to do something and didn't practice before hand (like most other survivor shows) but again it wasn't as informative as it was because he was running around trying to get the ""shot"" or collecting the gear. Not his fault - I'd say producers for having him lug around 50 - 55lbs of gear EVERYWHERE.",1332806400,,1455,3.969283276450512
2792507,5,B000O7862S,"Thank you for shipping the Survivorman DVD to me.  I liked the DVD and your handling of my order, very much.",1328572800,,108,4.142857142857143
2792508,5,B000O7862S,"And I mean no insult to guys that I have a deep and abiding respect for - men like the late Ron Hood, Ray Mears, Cody Lundin, Dave Canterbury and Mykel Hawke. They're all experienced instructors whom I look up to for inspiration and leadership.

But my cover statement says a great deal about the means by which Les Stroud executed his missions - truly surviving. No camera crew, no sound man, no producer. No assistance, no one to work with or with whom he could rely on. No companionship. No stunts. Just him and the situation.

After reading critiques that Survivorman is boring, that Les is just showing how to die slower, I would argue that attempting a self-rescue using skills that most people do not have, cannot learn, or cannot successfully attempt is a surer suicide. I would argue that surviving does not mean going gung-ho; charging up, down and thru environments that most average people could not do in a controlled wilderness training course. Surviving means getting back to your loved ones, not earning props from veterans of the special forces.

Unlike some other survival-type programs, there is only the truth about Les and his week-long missions. Again, it's not a stunt show.

It still amazes me to watch his productions - always stunned one person could do all of that and still deliver an effective presention. This is, in my opinion, the videography equivalent of pitching a baseball, running to home base, and hitting it into play. Crazy incredible stuff.

For those who missed Les when his program was on the air - 'Survivorman' drops off one man with odd bits-n-ends to survive a perilous situation for an entire week. Part documentary, part entertainment, part teaching video.

Some of the most challenging episodes are often some of the most amusing. Typically, at the start of his week-long expedition, I find myself laughing when he looks into his vagabond 'kit' - materials scrounged and cobbled together, searching for potential survival items. Now, obviously, some of it is set-up for demonstration purposes. But it teaches you to think outside of the box; that sometimes throwaway junk can be repurposed for something that will aid you in an unexpected situation. Nothing is truly 'trash' when you're desperately trying to survive.

Example: When he made fire by hitting a rock he found in a stream against a shovel with a piece of char-cloth he made from the skin of a crashed plane - all while it was snowing! That was just about the most bleeping incredible thing I have ever seen. And I'll be bluntly honest: If you told me that were possible - I would've said someone was having fun at your expense. But he did it. Just bleeping amazing. {:-o

And I love that he pulls away the curtain with the bonus behind-the-scenes episode. No stranger as a student, the DVD contains important and revealing outtakes not included in the show. Including his own need to learn from local specialists before entering into unfamiliar territory; men and women not unlike himself, who regularly face the challenges of living off the land with little resources other than what you carry in your bag of experience. I appreciate his honesty. He doesn't present himself as a global-any-situation-any-time expert, he's a student too. And I really, really respect that.

Important Note: Episodes from the Discovery Channel are edited slightly different than the versions offered by Les himself via his website. So consider that if you're deciding to make a purchase.",1327363200,8,3482,4.898132427843803

I have spent alot of time alone out there, and I recognize the way it shows on Les when he's filming. I highly suggest this series. This series was one of the best of it's kind with a wealth of practical information,and a non glamourous approach that just might teach someone something.

2792521,4,B000O7862S,"I would have given this 5 stars, except that as I watched 9 episodes over 3-4 days, it became depressing.  Also, I realized that Les took unnecessary & not recommended risks for the sake of ""the show"", i.e. hiking into the rain forest in Costa Rica instead of staying safely on the beach; leaving his relatively safe plane crash site & trying to hike out; trying to raft out of the Ofeefanokee Swamp amidst gators, snakes, etc. instead of staying on somewhat dry land & shelter; & generally, trying to ""walk out"" of every simulated situation, which most people are not able to do.  They do better to stay put, build a shelter, find water & food, build a signal fire, stamp out ""SOS"", & wait to be rescued.
  That said, I have learned a lot from Les in shelter & fire making & general resourcefulness re:  using whatever is available.  I have done many day hikes & one 8-week fully equipped backpack trip through the outer islands of Hawaii, as well as many kayaking/canoeing trips in FL.  I regard vacations as ""expeditions"", with all needed equipment & supplies top priority.

Even if you are in similar terrain his tips may not always be applicable.  Of course I would hope that I'm never in a situation where I must use the techniques he teaches.

Honest drama, and educational factors play a big part in why I am a big fan.
 I tried to space out the episodes as to not watch all of it at once, however, Les makes that impossible to do. I had to keep going! Some episodes, you can see the frustration he is going through. Les is also a comedian at times.
 I feel this show is one of the best Discovery Channel has to offer. Excellent family entertainment. Most of all, You'll learn something about survival and how to do it in certain situations on a real life survival scale.

But, Heres the nitpicking, There are no special features to explore (we would all like to see more of his crew coming to get him, how the show is made or broken down) maybe its just me.
Also... there is no play all, certainly the ease of programming a play all deems this to be a flaw.

Thirdly, entering the episode the show is broken into his days spent, where I can see this makes sense, the images are covered by numbers, and give you little reference to what actually happened on that day. (hence the reason youd go back to watch a particular day)

2792545,5,B000O7862S,"Terrific show, great DVD. This is a repackaging of the Season One DVD available on Les Stroud's website for $25. It contains the 9 episodes from Season One plus a behind-the-scenes episode.

Years ago when I heard about ""Survivor"" I thought it would be dumping modern Americans on an island and watching them try to feed themselves. I thought that would be a great show. Instead it was the series of challenges and voting people off the island - not about survival at all.

Les Stroud made my wish come true. He recreates accidents that would leave you stranded in the wilderness, and then uses the items at hand and his wits to survive for seven days. He actually falls out of his canoe and watches it drift away, then he swims to shore, gets out his backpack and sees what he has to survive - in one episode he smashes a video camera and uses the lens to start a fire. He survives the desert, artic, a shipwreck in a raft, the Georgia swamp (he catches and eats a rattlesnake).

He does all his own filming, talking as he goes. This leads to some of the humor in the show - he'll film himself making a slow trek up a steep ridge, and then point out he has to go back down to get his camera - then go up the ridge again.

Some of what he does works well - he catches a snow-shoe hare with a snare, something everyone has heard about but he actually shows you how it works (its not like in the cartoons) but some are flops. He eats plants which make him throw up, and it takes him a LONG time to start some of his fires, with multiple failed attempts. I find it all very interesting.

He has immense patience, and his super-power is to go for five days without eating more than two lizards without complaining.

One last comment - the show invites a comparison to man vs wild, which is much more dramatic and over-the-top and gross - the man vs wild guy drinks by squeezing elephant dung and brown liquid comes out and he swallows that. That guy goes out of his way to face drama - he chooses an escape path over a lava field so you can see his boots smoke, where Les Stroud would walk around it. Plus I can never forget that the man vs wild guy is standing there with a camera crew which has coolers and a truck right there. They are presumably drinking Coke and eating McDonald's while the guy drinks elephant dung juice. Its a stunt. Whereas when Les Stroud found the rattlesnake (he jumped a mile and they had to bleep what he said) if he had gotten bitten he would have had to face it alone.

Les Stroud is very low key and Canadian, and he plays his harmonica to keep his spirits up. He is very likable.

He's also got a great sense of humor despite the fact he eats almost nothing for seven days.

This dvd is JUST the episodes, no making of, no out-takes, nothing like that at all.. Its good, but could be better.",1187049600,5,287,4.538461538461538
2792564,4,B000O7862S,"This stuff is great, but not long enough.  Les Stroud is very personable and fluent in his world, making a science out of survival methods & techniques from around the globe.  The episodes could stand another 8-10 minutes though, given to better detail of just what he's doing, and how he's doing it; they leave you wanting more.  All in all, one of the coolest new shows in years, and it makes ""Survivor"" look like ""Beach Blanket Bingo""...

Les Stroud takes off into extreme conditions for one week, by himself, carrying along 50pnds of camera equipment. This DVD set includes all the episodes from Season 1, and they're great. My personal favorites are the jungle and swamp episodes. For this cheap price, you can't possibly go wrong. Alot more realistic than Man vs. Wild.",1185148800,7,398,4.955223880597015
2792567,5,B000O7862S,"I enjoyed watching the Survivorman episodes.  Les gets dropped off in the middle of nowhere with very little to help him except what an average person might have with him.  This show is interesting, educational, funny and a lot of fun to watch.  I was hoping that it would have the episode in which he stranded himself in the snow in a car and had to make his way back.

I have also watched Man vs Wild and have found that not to be as good. He always brings a flint to make fire and a canteen full of water, not to mention a camera crew. Les brings none of that with him.  Survivorman is definitely the best survival show out there.",1184889600,7,633,4.155737704918033
2792568,3,B000O7862S,"Les Stroud, survival expert, takes us to nine extreme environments, from the Arctic to the Desert, from the Mountains to the Sea.  He shows us the good, the bad and, sometimes, the ugly.  I enjoyed most of the episodes.  I like it when he debates the myths - does moss only grow on one side of the tree?  Should you eat snow?  Without a camera crew, without any way to get access to outside help, he has to last for seven days in the wild.  And most of the time seems to do a great job of it.
But other times he will do something completely unplanned and stupid.  For example, he was on the shore of Latin America, doing OK, but decided to go inland.  He got lost, bitten by every insect alive and ended up following a river back to the sea anyway.  Why?  Because that's the best place to look out for passing boats and civilization.  Then WHY leave the beach in the first place?  Also, when compared to Man Vs Wild does not seem to dish out as many facts.  You can watch an episode, and while it is amazing to see, come away with very little useful information.",1184716800,12,1062,4.172413793103448
2792569,5,B000O7862S,"***** This set does not contain ""The Making of Survivorman"". That extra footage came out after I purchased this DVD. Try Survivorman's website for the latest version. *****

The two colorful DVDs come in a classic plastic container. The picture quality and sound are perfect. Each episode is shown in its entirety and without commercials. It doesn't get any better than this.

Disc One

Desert - Les salvages his broken bicycle after it strands him in the desert. He later uses those parts to aid his situation.

Boreal Forest - Just what it implies. The forest. It's in one of these forest/jungle outings that Les almost amputates his finger when his knife slips.

Swamp - Bullfrogs and turtles are Les's main staple as he builds a raft out of the swamp.

Jungle - At night the jungle floor moves with activity.

Disc Two

Arctic - No food anywhere, except for his pack of seal blubber. Polar bears stalk his sleeping area.

Mountain - Shelter building and fire making at its best.

Winter Plane Crash - My favorite. Les fakes a broken arm to reflect a real plane crash situation. He builds a nice shelter from the busted up airplane, and traps rabbits with a snare.

Canyonlands - The loneliness of the canyons grates on Les's nerves as he smokes out a living quarters and catches small animals for food.

Lost at Sea - Les takes flight in a rubber raft and gets hit by a nasty unexpected storm.

I can't wait to see what Les has planned for Season Two. I'll be the first to buy his DVD.",1184630400,67,1489,4.5111940298507465
2792570,5,B000O7862S,"I remember watching this a couple of years back, caught on some obscure Canadian channel. This channel never had anything good on it, but i was channel flipping and came upon Les. I saw him trying to make a deadfall, and he was messing it up, and i considered him an idiot.

Then one day, i caught that same episode from the beginning, and was completely engrossed in what he was doing.

Les is obviously an expert in survival, but what he does that often TV actively seeks to hide, is to make the show as real as possible, and this includes showing his mistakes. Not only does he learn from his mistakes, but so do we.

It truly is incredible that not only does he have to survive a week with usually nothing more than a multi-tool, but he has to do so while also packing along 50lbs of camera gear and filming himself. If you see him walking away in the distance or climbing a mountain, that means he's done it at LEAST TWICE... once to do the shot, and another to retrieve the camera.

And he doesn't do stunts like some other shows that i won't name. He doesn't try to climb a 30' into the air for coconuts when there are coconuts on the ground already. He doesn't climb down a waterfall when he can just walk around it. It might make good television to do that, but it's completely unwise in a real survival situation to do stunts like that (and he doesn't have people feeding him energy bars behind the camera to do those stunts).

The Discovery channel version is different than the Canadian version i watched. The Discovery channel version edited some things out (i guess not to offend the American public... such as when he ate the seal eye).

Anyways, thank you Les for such a great show... and for inspiring me to head into the woods myself (although i carry actual gear instead of cameras).",1183680000,12,1802,4.380239520958084

It's the eating of unfamiliar plants or wild vegetation is where years of training would come in handy.

8183827,5,B000O7862S,"Survivorman and Man vs Wild were on the air at the same time.  Where Bear was more photogenic and would eat strange animals for dramatic value, Bear would also do dumb things like run downhill, off-trail (a great way to break ankles and legs).

It wasn't initially clear that Bear had support staff (later, it was a known fact), but it was always very clear that Les was by himself.  In one early episode in the snow, he mentioned how difficult it was to film himself - placing cameras, walking by, retrieving the cameras. Les is a charismatically watchable, low-key host, who is clearly doing everything he can to keep himself alive for a couple of days.  This is a great show, full of interesting information.",1520294400,,711,4.619047619047619
