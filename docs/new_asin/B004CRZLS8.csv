If you really want to learn to play reggae with the rite reggae feeling then Wicket Beats is the way to go.",1296604800,2,462,4.087912087912088

4328733,5,B004CRZLS8,"I loaned it to him the day it arrived. He hasn't given it back yet. The good news is, he's incorporated the things he's picked up from the video into his playing with our ska band. The bad news is that I'm out $16.",1394582400,4,214,3.8863636363636362
4328734,5,B004CRZLS8,"What an entertaining tutorial video! It has the history, the techniques and the culture of Reggae and Ska all in one. I especially like how Gil highlights the feel needed to play this music. That's the key to Reggae and Ska. That's the culture of this music for me. That the beat offers the missing link. Many musicians overlook that aspect and think reggae lacks depth and technique. Gil shows how important that it is not just to play the notes and that's why this DVD is great it offers a holistic approach to the style!

I also think it was great how he included ska punk and 2 tone in the DVD. A lot of people scoff at the two genres and call them derivative but Gil breaks the beats down and shows the true connection of the genres to reggae and Jamaica ska.

Definitely for any musician - doesn't matter what instrument you play
Actually, it's definitely for everyone!

P.S. I'm a musician but I don't play a drum kit!",1386460800,,925,4.366279069767442
4328735,5,B004CRZLS8,This is something ive been looking for most of my life. Very informative and the genres/sub genres gil covers in the dvd are just about every one in Jamaican music.,1378598400,,164,4.5
4328736,5,B004CRZLS8,"This DVD opens up the door for drummers who want to learn roots/reggae playing styles. Gil Sharone does a good job in demonstrating and breaking things down along with assistance from a bassist, keys. and guitar who all play from the roots. One wickedly Irie DVD.",1371168000,,263,4.739130434782608
4328737,5,B004CRZLS8,"Wow.  I haven't seen other reggae drum videos, but this is how it should be done.  great angles, rhythms, and bands.  It will take me a while to catch on, but there is so much here",1363824000,,180,3.9444444444444446
4328738,5,B004CRZLS8,"This is a very comprehensive collection of beats and history. I won't reiterate points made in previous reviews (this is #5) but I was very impressed. FWIW, I own a growing collection of drum vids and Hudson Music's quality is so far the best of all. The Wicked Beats musicology is excellent as are Gil's breakdowns and explanations of the beats, including the eBook. There are play-along bass tracks but I find myself playing along with the songs in the Performance tabs included in the bonus section of the DVD.  As Gil promised, the exercises have helped me in all my drumming.  I commend this vid to ANY musician serious about Jamaican music, not just drummers.",1329868800,2,665,4.724137931034483
4328739,5,B004CRZLS8,"This DVD is a visual encyclopedia and tutorial of reggae drumming. There are literally hours of viewing ahead of you if you decide to use it. i.e. you will definitely be going back and watching it over and over. It teaches truly authentic Jamaican reggae (not some watered down American version) and covers all styles of reggae. The presentation is professional and modest, just letting the playing speak for itself rather than the author boosting himself up. There are also some legendary Jamaican musicians in this video and everyone is genuinely comfortable playing together. I don't know anything about Gil Sharone or his history (never heard of him before) but he passes on tips and tricks learned from top notch reggae drummers like Sly Dunbar and others.

There's a section on basic reggae exercises showing you how to build strength in both hands and these are to be practiced without drum rolls etc... forcing you to focus on the discipline of the beat. There's another section showing you how to tune the drums to get a reggae sound - not so much tuning but muffling to get that dead sound. Also exactly how to play the snares and toms, hi hat's etc. with the emphasis always on ""feel"" - not cold theory.

It was filmed in California but it has a very Jamaican vibe and the production quality is excellent - you get studio quality sound meaning that the drums (and instruments) are all properly mic'd up and recorded... this is no amateur home video.

The whole video is compulsive watching; entertaining as well as instructive. I was more interested the rocksteady and roots reggae sections that comes later in the video. When I first got the DVD, I watched it from beginning to end but now I'm going back picking out sections and going over them again. There's plenty here to be working on for a very long time.

I am totally inspired by this video and it has already help me to play 1000%  better reggae drums.

Without a doubt - if you have ANY intentions whatsoever of drumming reggae - you need this.

Worth every cent!

UPDATE: March 1, 2012 - I've been using this DVD for about a month now and on a scale of 1 -100 my playing has gone from say 15 to 75.  It's a great way to learn reggae drums.",1328745600,5,2212,4.5376884422110555
4328740,5,B004CRZLS8,"After playing drums for 20 years, and being in a ska-punk band for several years, I felt like the time had come for a closer look at the Jamaican genre of drumming.

In this vid, Gil Sharone breaks down a variety of Jamaican rhythms in a clear, concise manner. After breaking down the beats, Gil plays the beats in a full band situation. He also talks a bit about how to get the classic drum sounds of Jamaica, with muffling and tuning techniques.

In one section he has a couple old-school rastas playing hand drums, and they talk about the origins of some of the rhythms. One rhythm comes from the human heartbeat. Another rhythm comes from the sound of lightning and thunder ... heavy stuff!

This is a quality instructional drum DVD that's worth the price, if you want to rock the Jamaican beat!",1312156800,,799,4.496551724137931
4328741,5,B004CRZLS8,"I've been playing reggae drums for many years now, and I know that there is a lack of quality material out there to teach others about reggae music or reggae drumming. Most of the educational videos and music I have seen over the years have terrible, honestly.

Because of this, there are a lot of drummers who do not know how to play reggae, and it is evident in their feel and sound. This DVD addresses all of that. This is basically a library of information (within a tutorial) on reggae drumming, music, history and philosophy.

The first portion of this video addresses the origin of reggae music through the Nyabingi rhythm and philosophy. Gil plays along with traditional Nyabingi drummers ( a real treat ), and he lets them explain Nyabingi philosophy, drumming as well as the purpose of the drums themselves.

From that point on, the entire DVD encompasses everything you will need in order to play old school and modern reggae. I am amazed at how much information is packed into this single DVD. My hat is really off to Gil for being so knowledgeable and knowing the music so well. His explanations are perfect, and his reggae drumming is VERY powerful.

An overview of all included material:

  * An illustrated history of reggae and reggae beats
  * Tutorials  and exercises on all major reggae beats, and there are a lot.
  * Over 10 live performances with full a full band. Guys, this band is WICKED.
  * Play along tracks with no drums
  * Interviews with reggae drumming legends like Santa Davis, ska Legend Lloyd Knib and Adrian Young of No Doubt.
  * Tuning tips for that reggae sound
  * An ebook with exercises and a photo ebook

The sheer respect that Gil Sharone has put into this work of art really shines through. There is so much well thought out information and insight included that this DVD could be a source of study for any drummer's lifetime.

If you want to really play reggae like a pro, this is the way to go. Add Wicked Beats to your library today!",1299888000,13,1983,4.5423728813559325
8423535,4,B004CRZLS8,I liked this dvd/E-book.  The beat examples are fun and present a good learning opportunity.  Gil conveys the beats well.,1483574400,,121,5.0

8423537,4,B004CRZLS8,"5 star playing! !
But 4 on overall structure. I was hoping for some technique teaching but he doesn't really get into that. Gil is an incredible combo of world class technician and rock drummer. Most of the world class guys don't have the raw feel of a groove drummer but gil certainly has it. The play along tracks are cool and the e-book includes many exercises to help develop that style of playing.
Also lacking is reggae fills. He plays many of them but doesn't transcribe a whole lot of them. Still I would say buy it there's plenty of material to learn from. Not sure why this guy isn't more recognised or heard of if you will, but dude can surely drum!",1462233600,,660,4.330645161290323
8423538,5,B004CRZLS8,Bought this for my significant other... he loved it. It was a good price and he was looking to get into the reggae music beats and he loves learning so... this was a good purchase.,1451692800,,180,4.171428571428572
8423539,5,B004CRZLS8,"What a great dvd. Just long enough to cut into 2 or 3 sessions of watching and very easy to go back and reference for practicing. It totally covers the roots of reggae and its variations such as ska, but never gets bogged down in over-explanation. The songs played are great as well to see the different styles played by a full ensemble. The guests on the dvd are great as well, and give different takes on both traditional and modern reggae. If you love the style this is just a fun dvd to watch, but it gives drummers TONS of ideas in the genre and clears up the essence of what makes or breaks a true reggae beat. As Sharone says this is a long-awaited dvd that fills in the educational gap for the drumming community on reggae - one of the most influential and coolest types of music and drumming [in my opinion]. Your reggae knowledge and playing ability will definitely increase if you study this dvd and practice the patterns. Comes with a nice included eBook pdf of the different grooves to reference, play-along tracks, recommended discography and photo gallery. If you have any interest in reggae drumming don't think about buying this, just get it. At $15 it is a complete steal for a lesson you can refer back to anytime you want.",1444780800,2,1242,4.475770925110132
