7963473,4,B000067J2L,saw it back in the 80's and thought is quite macabre.  i used to own a red knee tarantula and she was the best pet ive ever owned.  but i never used to her to get revenge. i did use her to keep my land lady from snooping in my room.  the land lady was terrified of her.  i would tell her i let her out to roam free and not to go in my room.  worked like a charm.,1360886400,,362,3.475

I'm not quite sure how to review this incoherent mess of a movie, since most of what I was thinking while watching it had to do with speculation about the altered states of everyone involved with this movie--from the writers of the spec to the distributors who actually released it. (""Actually"" as in ""you <em>actually</em> sent this to a movie theater and expected them to <em>show</em> it?"".) I certainly couldn't concentrate on the plot, which pops in and says hello every once in a while before going back to cower in its hole. Or the acting (only one cast member, <em>Scream, Blacula, Scream!</em>'s Eric Mason, had a career in Hollywood after this movie; he never worked in features again, only television). Or the direction. Or anything else, really. I don't think I've ever described a movie as ""goofy"" before, but I can't think of another term that fits here.

The plot concerns Susan Bradley (Suzanna Ling), a disturbed teenager who really, really likes spiders. It's your basic revenge drama (think <em>I Spit on Your Grave</em>, or perhaps more on point <em>Willard</em>), teen thugs break into her house and kill one of her spiders, and she sets the others on them. But it's structured almost like a porn film--once we get to the revenge bit, there are long, drawn-out episodes that have very little scene-building before we get down to business. Except in this case, the business has not to do with naked bodies but crawling spiders.

To be fair, I have seen worse movies over the past week, but that doesn't mean it's worth your time. Bloody awful. * ",1335484800,,1627,4.884057971014493
7963475,2,B000067J2L,"Anyone with a fear of spiders would be ill-advised to watch this film! KISS OF THE TARANTULA follows a young girl that becomes traumatized after her mother dies from fright when Susan slips a tarantula in her bed to scare her. As a teen, she becomes obsessed with the creatures, exacting revenge on her tormentors with the help of her furry friends. This eight-legged take on WILLARD has some enjoyable moments (mostly in its over the top performances and creepy use of real tarantulas), but it wreaks of the cheap drive-in circuit from which it was spawned. The simple revenge plot rarely breaks the surface, relying more on the bloody deaths than the strengths of its characters to carry the film. What is worse is that the run time is padded with unnecessarily long stalk and chase sequences and an awkward subplot involving Susan's incestuous uncle that only serve as empty filler. KINGDOM OF THE SPIDERS would debut the year following, offering a much larger and more entertaining spider invasion than can be found in the minimized suspense and action of this film. Spider fans will still find enough chills as they watch Susan's pets inch up their victims legs, but most other moviegoers will find the film severely lacking.
