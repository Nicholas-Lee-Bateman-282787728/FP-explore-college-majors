3421564,5,B0018Y398C,"There are very few movies that warrant the blowing of me away. Enough about me.

At first glance, this movie might appear a bit erudite. Go right ahead and move past that - if you listen carefully, you will hear scintillating brilliance and dry urbane wit that rivals Monty Python's Quest for Holy Grail.

Of course this is not a comedy. But sometimes, dry can be humorful in an incredulous, eye-opening sort of way.

One of the things that absolutely floored me is how revealing this movie is. You will see people who are the real deal (extraordinary people from powerful places and top positions in the stratosphere of the global elite) say astounding, unbelievable things. And, they mean every word. It's mindblowing.

Don't be surprised if you say to yourself, ""Did I hear correctly?"" ""No, I couldn't have heard that - let me rewind..."" ""They're joking, right?"" ""This is a put on... isn't it?"" ""Are they impersonators? Dub-ins?"" ""Are they who they say they are?"" ""How did the movie director get them into this movie?"" ""Astounding!"" ""I can't believe it!""

Your head will swivel. You will definitely have to watch this movie over and over again to savor every enlightening moment, every little zinging nuance.

One reason is, because, there's so much depth amongst the flashes of light and dark. It's mesmerizing. Small, simple little phrases here and there that have the weight of dark matter.

There's this quote from Voltaire - look for it. It's extraordinarily timely, considering today's economic climate... It involves ""corporatism.""

One beauty of this movie is that it allows you to draw your own conclusions. It provides information. You provide the thinking.

The Acting and Actors...

Great acting by two student actors who play Yale grads. One of the actors is actually a Harvard grad - how funny is that? You KNOW there was a dig in there, some way...

Another student actor was from Princeton, another, Stanford. I wonder if any were from... Yale. After all, we're talking about the political, affluent, power elite... would any Yalie participate in this most delightful movie?

Other ways this movie rrrocks...

The script is perfection, the acting, superb, actors, well chosen, the music, most excellent, and the actual real people who played themselves - stupendous.

The movie opens with a with a surreal exaggeration of an Ivy Leaguey gathering in the garden. The stage is set with verbal poetry in motion. It's like pastel vellummy old paper, crispy and faded at the corners. Dry. Jaded. Ennui'd. Just the right touches to take the Ivy League theme a touch over the top, and yet not.

And the soundtrack and music... worth putting on in the background while you're studying or working. You know how classical music increases work production? The music in this movie does that for me even though it's not classical.

This movie is a MUST HAVE as you will most definitely want to watch it over and over again. You'll see things you totally missed, every time. This movie is... aBUNdant. Overflowing with meaning and discovery.

If there ever was a movie for a lifetime, this is it. Also check out Half Moon Street with Sigourney Weaver.

3421568,5,B0018Y398C,"This new film by director John Kirby is a truly one of a kind social commentary.  As a documentary its style is completely unique, mixing documentary, mockumentary, socio-political essay, and musical!

The story follows two young men through a series of encounters that illuminates the true nature of America's social class structure.  While one is ready to buy in and join the wealthy ""ruling"" class of America, the other strives to hold on to his ideals and live a life that is meaningful in the way HE wishes it to be.

These personal narratives are intercut with interviews with prominent American cultural figures such as ROBERT ALTMAN, BILL BRADELY, KURT VONNEGUT, former Secretary of State JAMES BAKER III, HOWARD ZINN, WALTER CRONKITE, and many others, each of whom offers their own unique perspective on how our country is organized into a class that holds most of the money and most of the power and another class consisting of EVERYBODY ELSE.  And just to make things interesting, musical interludes occasionally break up the action, adding new dimensions to the meaning of the film, as well as adding to the overall entertainment it offers.

I bought this DVD on a whim, as I am a very big documentary fan, and I have to say that I couldn't be happier with the purchase.  You should definitely CHECK IT OUT.",1232496000,2,1319,4.8097345132743365
3421569,3,B0018Y398C,"I watched the DVD with no preconceptions as to what I was going to see except that there were a lot of well-known folks listed on the box as appearing in the film. Walter Cronkite, Senator (and NBA star) Bill Bradley, Director Robert Altman, author Kurt Vonnegut, activist/singer Pete Seeger and Disney Chair Mike Medavoy were there. Yet this was a small independent film. Were they being roped into being on camera as part of a publicity stunt? Well, yes.. and no. Director John Kirby's film is sort of like a Michael Moore documentary in that it certainly has a specific agenda but, though the premise is truly fictional - two graduating Yale seniors head off in different directions, one working for a big investment firm and the other working in social service. With the help of columnist Lewis Lapham, they also get to visit and interview the above named celebrities and politicians asking the question: Who is the current American ruling class? The musical part of the ""mockumentary"" is composed of some clever songs to bind the actual interviews. The students were real students but their quest for the answers was a ""set up"".

This film apparently played many Film Festivals and I can see why it was an audience favorite. No it won't win any Academy Award nominations, like Moore's films, but it's certainly worth watching.

There are no special features on it, which would have added to the value of the DVD.

3421571,5,B0018Y398C,"Lewis Lapham's The American Ruling Class, is a devilish and illuminating ""dramatic-documentary-musical satire"" on our plutocratic power elite.

No one is better equiped to pull off this dark seriocomedic venture than the wry master of patrician sensibility himself, the author of Fortune's Child, Money and Class in America: Notes and Observations On Our Civil Religion, and Imperial Masquerade.

Lapham is joined by a sterling cavalcade of establishment noteworthies playing themselves, as this sly Luciferian guides two befuddled innocents through the Oz-like, kaleidoscopic maze composing the elite corridors of power in America.

Lapham is the former editor of Harpers magazine, and one of America's premier essayists.

He ranks with H. L. Mencken and Albert Jay Nock in his stylistic elegance and keen ability to dissect the bloated rotting corpse of the American body politic, exposing the frailties, pretentiousness, and rank imbecilities of what he aptly describes as its ""equestrian class.""

3421589,5,B0018Y398C,"I especially enjoyed the lugubrious 'Nickled and Dimed' lament of the low-wage hois polloi.  I've worked a high-paying tech job and also worked about 5 low-wage jobs at various times of my life.  I had to work at a movie theater and grocery store in my 30s because I relocated rather naevely following an imploded startup business venture.  I was so tired by the end of the day, I would just listen to the radio and take a kind of catnap before driving home.  Although I worked full time and shared a tiny apartment with a musician, I lived very simply (grocery store would give us free eggs from cartons where an egg broke for example), but I still went further into debt, living off a credit card.  I managed to pay most of it, but there was always an ever-creeping balance I call the downward poverty spiral.  I couldn't get credit assistance because they require 10k in debt, and I was no where close to that.

At any rate, sorry this review became a rant about poverty.  This movie does a very good of demonstrating exactly this effect.  It also demonstrates privilege, concentration of power and how the banks basically run everything and own democracy, even to the extent that the media is gamed as well.

Although the movie is not particularly enlightening if you haven't explored these topics before in other documentaries such as 'Inequality for all', it does a good job of pointing out the two competing attitudes about money and the drive to obtain it.  Kurt Vonnegut was questioned and he said to do something virtuous, suggesting perhaps that this automatically results in fortune, which is a terrible joke if that is what he meant.  I see virtue every day but it's mostly thankless.  This is again repeated in the 'Nickled and Dimed' bit and I love what the waitressing essayist had to say about where the 'real' contributers to society are: the thankless working poor.

Walter Conkite was also interviewed and said something to the effect of 'people should pursue a position within the ruling class because it validates the ruling classes influence over democracy'.  I think what he was trying to say could be put succinctly that 'capitalism works' -- that the pusuit of excess somehow makes everything work.

What I think is funny is that if you apply this principle to say, the interstate system, I can assure you that all it does is make everyone think you're a jerk...and in some rare cases in california, shoot you in the face out of rage.",1418601600,,2460,4.672853828306264

What a disappointment.  Once I realized Lewis Lapham was the host, I was hoping for insight, given how good I thought his ""Money and Class in America"", 1988, was.  As a lead-in, I'll point out that two points Lapham made in his classic 1988 book were:
1).  Everyone, regardless of where they are on the economic ladder, seems to believe that if they just made twice as much as their current income, that their economic problems would be solved.  2).  That people never seem to feel they have ""enough"", and endlessly try to ""keep up with the Joneses"".  He gave examples of rich people making themselves miserable because their (1980's prices) $1.5 million entrance  foyer was ""tacky"" and ""embarrassing"".  I found insight here, but perhaps I was just young.  At least it taught me to worry NOT AT ALL about the ""Joneses"" on any level.

So what did we ""learn"" in the film?  I'll give some specifics, instead of the generalizations most of the positive reviews centered on.

We learned that (gasp) big media corporations like the New York Times are subject to constraints from Wall Street (which expects profits) as well as their desire to report the news responsibly.  Thus, advertising revenue is a major concern.  (How horrible!  As though the capital to run a major news organization appeared by magic.)

We learned (as we always hear from the far left) that it's impossible to live on a low wage job.  Consistent with left wing punditry, we heard NOTHING about education, self improvement, moving up the ladder, personal responsibility (like saving), etc. as possible ways to grow OUT of minimum wage jobs, of course.  And then we learned that people with low wage jobs are all very skilled and the high wage people are all living off their work.  Naturally, we heard NOTHING about all the taxes the highly paid people pay.  Notice how the big push for a magical minimum wage of $15 is roughly double the current minimum wage -- point number one in ""Money and Class"" above.

We learned that it's not possible to do well financially, as well as to do good. One of the capitalists Lewis complained about was Bill Gates.  He lamented that if Gates (who supposedly had as much wealth as the bottom 40% of Americans) was asked about his wealth, he'd say he didn't have enough.  Funny how that works though, since Gates is now giving away almost his entire fortune via his charitable organization -- but for the far left, such giving is NEVER enough.  Since per IMDB the film was released in 2007, it's interesting how DISINGENUOUS this is, considering (per Wiki) that the foundation was formed in 1997, and Gates pledged a huge proportion of his net worth from the beginning.  It also was never mentioned that Gates just built a company that traded software for money.  No coercion, bombs, etc. were used.

We learned that if whining were sand, the far left would really get somewhere since they could tip the evil capitalist system of heavy rocks over with all the sand they could produce over the ages.  (Sadly, whining doesn't produce anything).

In the alternate ending, we learned that the time will come when capitalism, banks, etc. will go away.  One of the kids proclaims how they now ""own their home"".  Odd that the fact that without capital, loans, etc. -- the building blocks to produce things like modern day home ownership for the lower and middle class -- that such homes wouldn't be produced.  (Ah, but the far left can never be bothered with financial details -- they're too busy planning how to spend other peoples' money, after all).

...

Apparently things never change.  If they actually want to truly change something, I'd suggest the far left work for truly better educational standards and opportunities for people of all ages.  As a capitalist who earned his way with lots of hard work and paid lots of taxes, I'd support that, if the programs had standards for people remaining in them.  (More solid wage earners and less need for social support programs would be good for everyone).  However, since whining is easier, I won't hold my breath.",1417046400,3,4170,4.7454798331015295

Sellouts who shill for bankers or become banksters themselves in order that they can then later indulge their humanitarian interests.
The movie fails to honestly reveal the true criteria for access to the ruling class,
which every aspiring Jewish, Indian, and Chinese minority family in the Northeast and California knows and strives for-
get into one of the private or public Ivy League schools and then intermarry with the existing ruling class.
If not and you manage to make it anyway on your own merit or luck, you'll be considered second class and open to mockery.
(Howard Baker went to Tulane, so it's open season on him as if he's a war criminal while Henry Kissinger, who is seen eerily throughout the movie on every wall of every elite is not mentioned though he be a real war criminal- Harvard graduate)
The cream of the ruling class are those blessed by admission to Oxford through Rhodes Scholarship,
and this cements the Anglo influences and interests in the US, while the anglophile US elites fall in place behind them.

How many countries are run by plumbers and office workers? Its always been that way, always will. What this film could have done was offer solutions. Instead it merely asked the same question over and over. Many interviewed chose to ignore the question anyway. Others admitted a ruling class exists but only offered excuses. In the end I was confused on what point exactly Lapham was trying to make. Was it satire? Was he just pointing out how screwed up the elite's thinking was? Did he really mean the quote he kept repeating towards the end about national and personal best interests being the same? So he's a Ayn Rand-ian? Or was that supposed to be funny? It's never clear. I guess if you are a reader of Lapham it is obvious, but for those of us who are not, its just confusing.

The ""acting"" was quite bad. I suppose that was on purpose, but why? A few of the musical numbers were actually pretty good( nickeled and dimed), if a bit out of place.

I WOULD PREFER TO GIVE THIS MOVIE 2 1/2 STARS.  SOMEWHERE B_E_T_W_E_E_N, ""I DON'T LIKE IT"" and ""ITS OK"".  IT REALLY I_S OK...BUT IS S_O OBVIOUSLY BIASED AND HEAVY-HANDED, THAT PART OF ME DOESN'T LIKE IT....AT ALL!

WHEN I WAS GROWING UP IN THE 1960s, I WAS, OF COURSE, INFLUENCED BY WHAT I SAW ON T.V. AND READ IN THE NEWSPAPERS.  MEMBERS OF M_Y generation all seemed to want to get out of their parent's middle-class homes and into communes.  Oh, I'm sorry -- of course, not ALL people of my generation were middle-class.  Some were, (through no fault of their own, of course), so VERY poor, they had to live in welfare hotels...or worse.  But they, too, seemed to all want to go join communes, and be free of the ""corrupt capitalism"" which had ruined the ideals of the Founding Fathers and the Constitution of the United States.

Although I quite desperately wanted to do what ""all"" the kids in my generation were doing, and also, (really!), desperately wanted to help those less fortunate than myself, (I continue to have a lingering guilt at never joining the Peace Corps, which probably would not accept me in any event, to the slightest of physical ailments), I also had these terrible, awful secrets.  I.....loved money(!)  And....(gasp!)....I wanted to join those who were rich....and powerful! (And -- (double gasp!) -- still do!)  I wanted, (and still want), to somehow become a Debutante, and/or to marry a Royal Highness, (HRH).  (I know this is part of what it means to be an ""Indigo"" person -- but even realizing it, doesn't make my longing one bit less!)  It was said this was impossible for me, (being American, and Jewish, and, yes, very slightly handicapped -- not to mention being a commoner) -- but those were, and still are, my dreams!  It's taken me several decades and a lot of soul-searching to admit these ""terrible"" longings, (and to admit it, not only to myself, but, (gasp!), here on Amazon for all to see....  Not a very lady-like thing to do, perhaps -- but I feel, strongly, that the ""conscience of the Left"", has denied me my dreams, and told me they were evil.  But Royalty, in the intervening years, has married many, many commoners -- including one Crown Princes who was not only a commoner before she married, but also who is part-Aborigine!  She and her (Crown!) Prince are supremely, sublimely happy -- and I feel strongly that, had this particular crown prince, (and perhaps others as well),  found a Jewish, American, slightly handicapped person that he loved, he would have married her, (me!) as well!  But no -- I was told such things are ""not real"" -- or at least, ""not real for YOU!""  I even remember
waiting for my dad to pick me up from a railway station one day.  My wonderful father, (NOT a physician), had decided that he had a disease called, ""NO-Monya"", (Pnen-nonia), a tough joke he made up about his lower-middle income status, (monetarily, that is).  His family HAD been sort of well-to-do for a time....but then the Crash of 1929 happened, and they, along with millions of others,world-wide, lost almost everything.  Anyway, I saw a book in the luncheonette near the railway station -- and bought it. I felt a traitor to my generation for buying it, and terribly, terribly ashamed ...but I just HAD to have it.  Was it pornography?  Was it a non-code comic book?  Nope!  It was a book which I did not know then was a classic:  ""Think And Grow Rich"" by Napolean Hill!  My dad would have loved that book -- it would have given him hope and inspiration.  But poor, brain-washed little me hid it from him, and from everyone else.  My dad never did see that book, or learn of that title!  (Watch out for the media.  Purposefully, or not -- it can twist your brain in ways even the effects of drugs cannot do....)

temptations of being wealthy and powerful.  Both are Harvard Grads, but one has a WASP-name and features, the other a minority, (Italian), name and features.  The WASP young man, (after a while), does get ""seduced"", and joins ""G-S"", (initials of a famous brokerage firm, the absence of mentioning the complete name of which, may be prudent here.)  Also mentioned are power-sources such as ""The TLC"", (which does NOT stand for ""tender loving care""), and ""The C___ On F___ R___"" and, shown quickly in a video, the names of many other familiar ""power elite corporations""-- all of these names well-known and always hated, by leftist leaning goups.  The WASP, (White Anglo Saxon Protestant) looking and name-sounding young man, is introduced to a lady-journalist-under-cover, who has taken several low-paying jobs to see how people can ""make it"", on $6 to $7 an hour.  She confides that, on her waitress's salary, she is having trouble paying the fee for her trailer, in her trailer-park space.  A song, ""Nickled and Dimed"", follows, wherein people, (presumably actor /singers), bewail the fate of the lower-paid worker.  There is also an interesting, farcical silent movie, shown in black and white, wherein a character, (played by the same actor who plays the part of the young Harvard grad with the Italian last name), has to decide whether to sell his soul to the corporation -- or not.  I found this short, humourous bit of super-propaganda somewhat heavy-handed, but very amusing.  And, although I do feel, myself, that minimum-wage salaries should be raised, and agree with the lady-journalist-under-cover, when she says she has learnt that there are NO ""unskilled"" jobs, still I wonder why these people do not at least go to the public library to find books with which to educate themselves, (as Abraham Lincoln did).  There is a WONDERFUL story I once heard, (not mentioned on this DVD, of course), of a lady who was a legal secretary for twenty years.  She had so much experience and knowledge, in fact, that, (not studying law itself, at all), she passed the Bar, and became a lawyer, on her very first test!  I am not saying that all low-payed workers can do this -- but taking out books from the library, with which to pass a GED, and studying further, in order to partake of the ""CLEP"" (College Level Examination Program), while not easy, is still a road that can be taken by just about any lower-class person who wants to raise their socio-economic status.  I think....  (And, if they have access to a computer, FREE classes on many subjects are available on [...]  Or were, last time I looked.....

I stopped watching this slanted, conscience-torturing DVD about 40 minutes through the 89 minutes playing time.  I shall go back to it, presently, to watch the entire DVD -- but taking it on all at once is a bit more than I can bear.  WILL the young Harvard Grad with the Italian last name, accept the invitation of his WASP friend and colleague at the G-S brokerage house?  Will the pretend-waitress be able to make her trailer-park rent this month?  These and other questions should be answered in the latter half of the DVD, (they'd better be -- or I will state that the habit of NOT tidying up loose ends -- often a case with leftist film-makers -- is sadly here as well.  But I hope that the answers will be given, I will see....

Winston Churchill said that, ""if a man is not a Liberal in his youth, he has no heart.  But if a man is not a Conservative in his maturity, he has no head."" ( ! )  Conservatives -- at least, moderate-leaning conservatives like myself -- have, I hope, both hearts and heads.  I agree absolutely with what the WASP young man says to his friend in this ""dramatic documentary musical"", as it terms itself.  He says: ""Make a lot of money first -- THEN give it to poor people.  It's easier that way.""

And, I might add, that way, you can also give a lot MORE money to help others, than if you have less, far less, yourself. MUCH more money.

Poverty -- though not a bodily disease -- has many of the same negative factors of any physical ailment.  My dad was right -- ""No-Monya"", (Pnemon-ia), really IS an illness of a kind.  Dreams are dashed by poverty, and talents go unfulfilled.  This is not only a tragedy for the individual concerned -- but also, to Humanity, at large.  In the series of books, ""The ______ Name In History"", (fill in ""Smith"", ""Jones"", or whatever surname you desire), there is a heartbreaking picture of a young man, in the 1930s, dressed in a neat new pair of overalls, a hat on his head, behind a primitive plow which is to be drawn by a horse.  This young man is obviously
 working on his own, or his family's farm.  He is NOT an employee, and NOT a servant.  But the aching look on his face betrays that he MUST have other dreams....to become a writer, a flyer, a scientist...who knows what>  But grinding poverty obviously ground over his dreams....and any greater contribution, other than subsistence farming, that he could have made to humanity,

My mom told me of a story she had read.  There was a simple French farm boy, (in the 1970s-1990s, not the one above), who looked and acted like any other farmboy, the world over.  But when he was tested....it was discovered he was a genuis!

It is said in this DVD, that many rich people do not consider other people to be fully human unless they are making $500,000 a year or more.  This attitude cheats the majority of humanity -- and puts people, (in their youth), like Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Carnegie, Andy Grove, Oprah Winfrey, Colin Powell, and almost every other person who HAS risen to fame and fortune, in the ""sub-human"" category.  Not to mention ""late bloomers"" like Grandma Moses!  This is an attitude that cheats, not only these potential beneficiaries to humanity, but to the snooty proponents of this false theory, themselves.  As was said, unforgettably, in the South African play,
""Master Harold and the Boys"": "".....you know what your prejudice does to us -- but do you know what it's doing to you?""

Making money in itself is not a sin -- even making LOTS of money. Monwy ia, after all, only a TOOL.  And if joining an elitist organization will help one make lots of money, why not?  Isn't it better to make lots of money, then give it away to deserving charities, than to make hardly enough to make one's own ends meet?
As one young woman says in this film, ""I don't have a trust fund that I can rely on with which to help others.....""  Or, as Mike Todd,
(working undercover to root out communists for the FBI), once said: ""If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.  THEN beat 'em!""

Robin Hood, after all, WAS, in reality, the Earl of Huntington!",1279152000,2,10707,4.63395225464191

So I'm buying it to watch it again and again. (There is a lot of info in this movie.) If you go into it with an open mind, you'll come out a better person. I strongly recommend this to everyone. Great use of music too. (It is a musical documentary after all.) Have the remote handy when you watch it, you'll probably find yourself rewinding it many times, ""Did I just hear what I thought I heard?""

The willing involvement of real ""Movers and Shakers"" is almost unbelievable!
