4565887,2,B0054DPLQQ,"The detail and explanations about the banks exploitation of the mortgage markets was very well done.  What was glaringly left out was how those markets were manipulated and left wide open to corruption and greed in the first place.  There is little to no mention of Freddie/Fanny/Countrywide et al and the MASSIVE amount of taxpayer dollars that have gone into buying subprime mortgages in the secondary market.  Government sowed the seeds of corruption by agreeing to buy overvalued mortgages, and the banks were quick to sweep in and take advantage.  Without taxpayers backing the loans there would have been no subprime mortgages made in the first place.",1343952000,31,657,5.11214953271028

This, plus a solid, cautious head on their shoulders should help them the next time they hear a political BS about the economy - they will know to support the ""good"" version of capitalism vs the ""1% gets more money"" version.......or so I hope!",1343606400,3,593,4.619047619047619

4565890,4,B0054DPLQQ,"I came to this film a bit later than others and you'll see some more detailed reviews here, including one by my fellow reviewer K. Harris. But I wanted to add some info not previously provided by other reviewers.

This moderately short (81 minute) documentary on the ""recent financial crisis"" was the idea of the three Executive Producers who (we learn from the director) had lots of money but no Director. (Guess they were part of the ""haves"" who survived the monetary meltdown. They found British Director David Sington, who knew little about banking but specialized in science documentaries, to direct the film. Sington tells a lot in the 48-minute Q&A session which appears as a ""bonus feature"" (and he's almost as entertaining as his film).

The film was released in 2010 and is now on DVD from Docurama - a DVD label I have always admired for giving exposure to small documentary films that fly ""under the radar.).

You don't need to know much about banking, mortgages or real estate to enjoy this film. (After all, the Director didn't.). There are lots of quick edits to keep things going and a nice original score. Older folks will enjoy the clips taken from 1950s educational films on finance that Sington inserts.

If nothing else, you will learn - after watching the film - the difference between buying an ""asset"" (something people buy more of when the price goes up - like real estate and stock) and ""goods"" (like gasoline or coffee, where people stop buying when the price increases). That one lesson is worth the two hours (including the Q&A) on this DVD.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

4565920,1,B0054DPLQQ,"It's very difficult to expect balance in any documentaries related to political issues, and believe me this one is about politics, not the economy. In short the filmmaker pegs the cause of the real estate bubble on income inequality (a favored trope of the left to discredit capitalism) combined with easy credit. Not mentioned at all in the film are things like the CRA (Community Reinvestment Act) and how that altered how loans were written and credit standards relaxed with the goal of achieving diversity among home owners. Also not mentioned is the role of government sponsored entities like Fannie Mae in the writing and backing of loans that would have never otherwise been written. Not mentioned is how the US income tax code is currently biased toward home ownership. To this reviewer's eye, by making big banks the villains they missed the real causes of the bubble which were not the banks alone but the banks cozied up to big activist government.  One of the major points of the film is to show how basically everything was pretty stable (exemplified by home prices and income inequality) up until the 1980s but then something changed, making it seem that conservative policies of the Reagan-Bush years bear the blame. The ghettoization of the inner cities is described as a phenomenon of capital flowing to the White Suburbs. Not mentioned (notice the trend) is what other factors contributed to income inequality. Surely the demographic profile of the US changed from 1900 to 1980. What was the role of the welfare state in the breakdown of the traditional family and thus the distribution of income? I guess we'll have to find another documentarian to know the answers. If you watch this movie, take it was boulder of salt.",1428192000,2,1739,4.894915254237288

It doesn't get into to what extent there was a change in borrower behavior verses predatory lending by banks or misrepresentation by mortgage brokers or explain really why anybody was willing to invest in the collateralized mortgages given some of the debt quality that was blended into them. It also doesn't get into the extent to which banks were required by regulators and then courts to write debt in areas where communities had poor credit and if that really was significant in causing banks to be willing to allow known poor debt to be blended. However, these are details which probably don't lend themselves to a general audience so I congratulate them on getting as far as they got.

While the film makers and interviewees identified the elimination of risk to the banks from the loans that the banks created, they failed to mention how the increased application of democracy and markets in other countries created increased competition, which has resulted in the fall of living standards of the middle class in this country.  The film makers and interviewees failed to grasp how psychological phenomena contributed to the collapse.  The film makers and interviewees failed to discuss the role of govenment policy like Fanny Mae in the collapse.  The film makers and interviewees failed to grasp how asymmetries of profits, which made it profitable to create the 2008 banking collapse, but not profitable to prevent the collapse, contributed to the collapse.  As a result, Greenspan was wrong when he said ""We are not smart enough,"" because there were people who were smart enough.

4566041,1,B0054DPLQQ,"This film is bad, really bad. If you were an alien transported to this planet today and were told that there was an economic crash in 2008 and then you watched this film which claim to answer ""What exactly caused the world s greatest economy to crash and burn?"" You still would have not a clue.

Let me give you come terms that HAVE to be in any film that wants to know why the economy crashed but were NEVER mentioned in this one.

Derivatives  - That is the general disease that the patient had (cancer).
CDS (Credit Default Swaps) - That is the specific type of cancer cell the patient had
FIRREA (Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act) - That is what implanted the cancer cells into the patient undetected
CFMA (Commodity Futures Modernization Act) - The is what let the cancer grow undetected
BISTRO (Broad Index Synthetic Trust Offering) - This allowed the cancer to metastasize at a furious rate.

These are the five keys that are crucial to understand WHAT happened but this film doesn't mention a single one, nada, zip, zilch.

Let me blunt, if you think that the world's economy nearly faltered just because a relatively small amount of people didn't pay their mortgages you have been sadly misled and films like these are leading the way in misleading people. The fact is we paid more in tarp funds than all of the fore-closed and late paying assets were worth and then some.

Here is some math, The US government could come in pay for ALL of the troubled mortgages at a cost of 2.5 billion per month, currently we have paid over 2.4 TRILLION to stabilize the economy without touching the troubled mortgages.  They could have paid off every single mortgage for about 1.5 Trillion in one lump sum. But they didn't and you know why - they were NOT the real problem, CDS's were.

Compare these numbers 1.5 trillion = ALL troubled mortgages vs 62.2 Trillion of CDS's at the end of 2007. The CDS market is what imploded and took down economies all over the WORLD, that is what caused this problem, not some foreclosures in the US.

Anyhow here are just some of my notes that I wrote down while watching this dud of a film.

Dumbest thing said in the film:

""Capitalism started with Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher""

LOL - Capitalism was ""identified"" in the 17th century even though it's dates back to at least 2000 BCE. That is just a wee bit before Ronald Reagan but I understand the partisan political hack job the filmmakers were doing by trying to attribute capitalism to Reagan.

The film Tries to link income inequality with the derivative crisis. This is downright ludicrous, first off it gets it data wrong. Income inequality started growing in the 1960's according to the IRS but that's just a minor point. The fact is the rules were completely different back then and uber rich were still rich it's just that they owned their money in trusts, businesses or other vehicles and it didn't count towards their personal income. The actual 'effective' inequality of all money created hasn't changed very much from the 50's to today. This talking point is one only used to gin up emotion, dumb people down and start class warfare rhetoric.

The filmmaker also put forth the revisionist history that the stock market crash and subsequent depression of 1929 was the result of a credit bubble. Not only do they do that they then claim that rising credit loads are a symptom of a credit bubble but there is plenty wrong with that analysis. While it is true that credit was at an all-time high (back then) the credit loads of the average American family was LESS than they were in the 1950's, that means the symptom of the credit bubble was worse in the 1950's then before the great depression.  However the viewer would have no clue about this because when they make that claim they show a chart that would seem to back up what they are saying but in reality the chart has NOTHING to do with credit to individual households, instead it was a income chart.

The film also got it wrong when they said that banks ROI is higher with low rates, that is 100% false, in fact their ROI falls precipitously as rates get lower and lower and they must make that up in volume. The film then goes on to show misleading figures that conflate and confuse banks with investment houses and then it interviews ONLY people from investment houses but keeps talking about banks. This purposeful misdirection only adds confusion to the average viewer of what really happened and who they players really are.

I got a great chuckle at the so-called expert saying that middle class people HAVE to match what the rich are doing, so when the rich are buying bigger houses then all the housed for middle class people are manufactured larger and they have NO choice. This is pure poppycock and doesn't reflect the real world at all.

The filmmaker totally skips over why the rules that governed home lending were revoked and new rules implemented  which led to the flooding of the market of low-cost loans that were sold to low income people. Ironically the goal of revoking the legislation was to allow more low-income people to get loans and now that they were the very people who masterminded this plan and applauded it before the implosion, now claimed it was predatory lending. BTW the person who makes the charge of predatory lending is using it as a talking point and has NO clue what the term actually means.

Zero Sum Economics - It's FALSE people, don't buy into the claptrap of this movie. NO economist believes that we live in a zero sum economy. In fact ALL economic theories are predicated that the economy is expanding (usually). But much of this film is predicated that a zero sum economy is a reality.

It never asked why housing prices were rising - BUT only in some areas, which is one of the key elements to understanding the housing bubble.

Virtually everyone of this films claim is a correlation equals causation error.

It totally got the trigger event to the collapse wrong to - it claimed it was the lowering of the credit rating on MBS, but in fact the only reason they were lowered was because delinquencies were going up because the fed raised interest rates. It was the raising of rates that was the match that struck the primer cord, aka the trigger. The clueless experts then proclaim that the events unfolded ""extremely fast"" and with lightening speed. But the historic facts say differently the first signs of trouble were in mid 2005, by 2006 the credit rating agencies were downgrading and foreclosures were increasing , by 2007 the fed was dropping interest rates to control the foreclosure rate and the economy finally collapsed in August of 2008. There were hundreds of articles and warnings all through 2006 and 2007, in fact I got out of all of my residential investments in 2006 because of the likelihood of a collapse. It really wasn't very hard to see this coming. What was hard was for the average person to know anything about CDS's and how they would collapse too bringing the economy to it's knees.

Bottom Line: You won't learn anything about why the economy collapsed from this film and what you do learn is mostly wrong.",1374537600,49,7174,4.639589905362776

It consists, almost entirely, of academics (half of them British) harping about the evils of income distribution in America. Only in the last half hour do they talk about any of the causes of the mortgage crises. Nowhere in this indictment is any mention of how government regulations distorted the market, making these crazy investments marketable. Remember, Fannie and Freddie bought every crappy mortgage these banks created, providing a no-lose incentive to write more of them. Also missing was how government mandated which three ratings agencies must be used, and how these ratings agencies were paid by the ISSUERS of these securities - creating an incentive to give favorable ratings.",1365465600,5,750,5.418803418803419
4566063,4,B0054DPLQQ,"The Flaw was well produced and highlighted many issues. The film also attempted to spread the blame for the housing bubble around to both mortgagees and mortgagors. But I will side with some other reviewers in feeling that the film didn't do enough to detail the full extent that speculation in housing drove the increase. Instead the producers focused much more on those that argued macro-economic conditions, starting in the 1970's, drove people to rely more heavily on financial products to ""keep up with the Joneses"".
I thought it was worth watching for free but do not go in expecting a highly in-depth analysis of financial side of the housing bubble. This film deals with the personal stories that coincided with it.",1363996800,2,723,4.934426229508197

4566066,4,B0054DPLQQ,"The talking heads, charts, & figures deftly examine debt, income inequality, and the 2008 crash, but the flaw in The Flaw is over-editing. It's very disjointed, with rapid cuts to cartoons, old movies, useless graphics, pedestrians, traffic, and other nonsense. It's as if they think they can better hold our short attention span by continually jumping around, but for me the result was frustration and a sense of an incomplete picture. I would prefer that they just let each guy talk and show each graph and be done in a quarter of the time with a clearer overall understanding.

When the collage was over, I clicked on Extras, hoping to watch Steiglitz, Shiller, and others in unedited interviews, but the only interview was 48 minutes with the director (which was better than expected). There's very good content, but it's an incomplete & kaleidoscopic scramble. (Many reviewers prefer that ""liveliness"".)

My favorite line is ""debt (private OR public) drives income inequality.""

My biggest disappointment is that both the documentary and the director's interview remain bound in the economists' myth of infinite resources and perpetual growth without ever addressing the broader reality that our coming problems will be dominated by resource scarcity and not merely a fair distribution of an ever-growing pie.",1360281600,3,1314,5.247619047619048
4566067,2,B0054DPLQQ,"The film is worth watching and covered many aspects of the mortgage crisis. It was mostly accurate in what it covered, but was not balanced in explaining the greed working on both sides of the lending process.
The predominant theme was to blame the rich, blame the banks and mortgage brokers.
Rarely was any blame assigned to personal greed of the borrowers, some of whom actually profited from their financial deals (by living rent free for many months after they stopped making payments).
At one point it was stated that the fees and points charged by the lenders for refinancing loans in urban neighborhoods were the main cause of home equity decreasing in those neighborhoods (and not the cash being pulled out). Very misleading.
The ""Flaw"" in loose mortgage policy is that home prices can fall (not the propagandist themes that this film portrays).",1359590400,4,853,4.930555555555555

4566069,5,B0054DPLQQ,"Greenspans 'Flaw': the understatement of the century, and a phrase that deserves a place on his tombstone as his eternal legacy to America, and the greatest transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich in all of human history engineered by his policies.  This film is interesting in the parallels it shows between 1929 and 2007, though it doesnt explicitly state that 2007 was the start of another Great Depression, the conclusion is pretty obvious since the preconditions of real estate bubble, debt bubble, credit bubble, and exponential inequality were all the same.  So now we have a repeatable experiment performed with repeatable results - repeal the 1930 regulations and viola - another Great Depression.  But will any of the Wall Street vultures ever learn from this?  Doubtful.  Who was it who said that when a man's paycheck depends on him not understanding something, he will be determined not to understand it?  This film makes one wonder if Wall Street on the whole has any redeeming societal value whatsoever. If the poor suckers ever understood how Wall Street systematically sucked their equity dry and left them with lifelong debt burdens via predatory lending, there would be riots in the streets to make Occupy look like a tea party.  Luckily for us, we have Fox News to keep them all confused and blaming Barney Frank and George Soros.

Another point made by the film is that the entire premise of home ownership - the 30 year mortgage - does not fit into any banking investment model, and so requires strange institutions like Fanny/Freddie to take on the mortgage and the risk after the banks have skimmed the fees.  Now fannyfreddy have only gotten bigger and less solvent as a result of TARP.  This seems to be another instance where things have gotten worse as a result of the Sept 18 2008 collapse - banks have gotten bigger and riskier, and FannyFreddy have gotten bigger and riskier.  We need antitrust action to break up the banks and to find some way to unwind FannyFreddy, but it will probably take complete systemic collapse worse than Sept 18 2008 to do so, since government is now institutionally structurally incompetent to do anything except enact deregulation that lobbyists pay them for.",1356825600,2,2225,4.8753315649867375

8456501,5,B0054DPLQQ,"We all know the basics of what happened. Liar's loans. Using the house as an ATM. CDOs. Fraudulent credit ratings. etc, etc. But why did all that happened? This documentary answers, and the answer is the neo-liberalism that started in the 80s and ensuing income inequality. The inequality parked too much money at the top, the money went out in search of the yield, and that created the credit bubble that in turn created housing bubble. (Stieglitz says in the film ""the top 1% would not give them pay raises, but was perfectly willing to make them loans"").

This documentary interviews academics, the players, and the Joe Blows off the street. That in itself may not be that remarkable; other documentaries on the subject have done the same. But it meshes them skillfully to draw the real picture of what happened.
