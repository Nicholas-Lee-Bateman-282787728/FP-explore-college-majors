1829646,1,B00008973J,We've been waiting for this on DVD for how long? And someone butchers it? PSYCH-OUT is a fun movie...if anything extra/cut footage should have been ADDED! Along with BONUS features. Shameful.,1053216000,11,191,5.193548387096774
1829647,5,B00008973J,"Really great double feature! Psych-Out features a new documentary interviewing Rush, Kovacks, Dick Clark, and a bitter Bruce Dern! Fun! Then you get a real great looking and sounding print of the film. Nice to see that Nicholson couldn't really act much back then too! He's perfected his ""Jack"" character so well that he literally turns it on and off for the cameras. Then, suddenly, Dern walks in and blows Nicholson's ""talent"" away. To top it off, Dern's hippie wig is even more silly than Nicholsons, yet his acting is superior. Great music to boot: The Seeds and The Strawberry Alarm Clock!
I'm going to watch The Trip tonight, and expect nothing less than what I got with Pysch-Out. In fact, I will be so ""loaded"" that this film should blow my mind!",1051056000,4,754,4.676691729323308
1829648,5,B00008973J,"Psych-Out, weird from the start, but a true classic in every sence of the word.  The film has some really good performers in it; the greatly missed Susan Strasberg, who stars as a young deaf lady looking for her brother in San Fransico, Dean Stockwell and Jack Nicholson and others.  It has a soundtrack that is outstanding, featuring The Strawberry Alarm Clock and The Seeds and a very important anti drugs message.  A film NOT to be missed!
I had never seen The Trip before, Susan Strasberg also appears, though not as prominent as she was in Psych-Out, Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper (always welcome) and Bruce Dern (who has a minor, but pivotal role in Psych-Out).  IMHO it's not as well acted as Psych-Out, but it's enjoyable.  Another important message about the dangers of drugs.  An extremely weird movie!
Both movies come complete with some interesting features.  Interesting to see how American International (maker of these movies) changed with the times, from early 60s Beach Party, to late 60s happenings with these movies.
I cannot recommend this movie enough, especially for Psych-Out, which is a true classic!",1050883200,7,1121,4.962566844919786
1829649,3,B00008973J,"This double-feature DVD features a couple so-so movies from the late sixties that focus on the hippie movement and especially the drug scene.  Even big name actors such as Jack Nicholson, Peter Fonda, Bruce Dern and Dennis Hopper cannot make these movies anything more than truly average.
The Trip is the weaker of the two movies.  The story is that a guy takes LSD and sees weird things.  That's it.  Roger Corman directs and he makes it at least visually interesting (occasionally borrowing from his Poe movie sets), but this is generally a mess.
Psych-Out at least has a story, focusing on Susan Strasberg as a deaf girl who is aided by Jack Nicholson and his buddies in finding her brother.  Nicholson is good enough, but once again, the focus is too heavy on psychedelia, which was probably okay for the audience at the time, but now it just seems dated.  At least this movie gives the hippie scene a realistic grunginess that the Trip lacks.
The special features, including a couple ""making-of"" documentaries are often better than the movies themselves.  As stated before, these are extremely dated movies and are, at most, mildly entertaining (although they might be better if you're stoned).  Most of the characters are cliched and even those that aren't are not all that interesting.  For a far better movie about that era made in that era, try Alice's Restaurant.  For this pair, the best that can be said is that they are occasionally visually nice...otherwise this is three-star material all the way, and only that good because of the extras.",1050796800,3,1554,4.830188679245283
1829650,4,B00008973J,"I was so pleaed to see both these movies on a single DVD cause I was going to buy both of them anyway. First off Psych out shows Jack Nicholson in his heyday as 'Stoney' a hippie in the haight ashbury district of San Francisco smack dab in the middle of the hippie movement with lots of great sixties psychedelia and a wonderul soundtrack and a good storyline. Next on the double bill is 'the Trip' the reason I bought this DVD;It was written by Jack Nicholson and stars Peter Fonda,a man who just went through a divorce seeks his friends guidance in an LSD trip to better understand his problems but as the hallucinations grow and the confusion of the trip set in you are guided on a trip through the city from paranoia to horror to ecstacy and you in the end are as unsure of things as he is cause you all in'all experience what he experiences. Truly brilliant film making for a truly surreal glimpse into the often misunderstood world of psychedellic drugs. You get the impression LSD is neither glorified or villified just documented.",1050710400,9,1038,4.497354497354498
1829660,3,B00008973J,"Both these films capture a time and feeling quite well. I know because I lived through it. Peter Fonda and Jack Nickolson were both part of the early Hippie scene and  got a lot of the feeling across, even though some of it is over the top. Even Roger Corman admitted that he tripped and smoked pot before creating these films, for authenticity, of course. Fun stuff.",1355184000,,367,4.477611940298507
1829661,5,B00008973J,I lived in the the 60's and experienced the magic of those times. Psych  Out and The Trip brought back a lot of good memories. And seeing the actors that later became superstars was very exciting.,1341360000,,196,4.444444444444445
1829662,5,B00008973J,"Very cool item. Twin features from the Psychedelic Sixties with Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper, Jack Nicholson & Bruce Dern. Sorta like Easy Rider lite.",1324425600,,148,5.208333333333333
1829663,2,B00008973J,"The videos should have been edited in their full version and screen. Is making money the only purpose? What about customer satisfaction? There already are similar comments posted. So, are you going to keep customers informed about what corrective actions are going to be taken?",1289952000,2,277,5.177777777777778
1829664,5,B00008973J,"I have a copy of these films and they are SO entertaining to me and my friends that this is a copy I purchased for a couple of friends of mine.

Being a child of the 60's, it's always fun to see how they portray events on film.

Entertaining films if you are a ""B"" movie fan like myself.  If you are looking for CG special effects, pass this one up but if you want to see old school effects, DON'T HESITATE!

These are very fun films!",1282608000,3,434,3.954022988505747
1829665,1,B00008973J,"This version of Psych-Out was made from a full screen version, where the left and right sides had been cropped. Then to make this version, they cropped the top and bottom so the image would fit a modern 16:9 monitor. What you see when you watch the version on this DVD is a small rectangle that was cut from the center of the original movie.

The full screen version showed up recently on broadcast TV, and I wanted to see the parts that had been cropped off the sides, so I got hold of a copy of this DVD. Although this DVD is labeled ""widescreen"" in the description on Amazon, it actually shows less of the original movie than the cropped full screen version. I'd say anyone who buys this on Amazon is entitled to a refund because the term ""widescreen"" implies, incorrectly in this case, that you are getting the entire original image.",1273708800,15,837,4.435064935064935
1829666,5,B00008973J,This was truly a vivid reality check into the world of the 60's drug den and it's effects!,1273449600,3,90,4.055555555555555
1829667,5,B00008973J,"Susan Strasberg plays Jenny Davis, a young woman who runs away from home, and lands in San Francisco. Jenny's looking for her brother, an eccentric artist with a host of problems. Jenny is deaf, and has to struggle to communicate with those around her. She meets a hippie named Stoney, who is the leader of a psychedelic rock band. Stoney is touched by the waifish Jenny's situation, and offers her a place to stay. He also wants to help Jenny locate her brother. But that's easier said than done, especially since violent thugs are after Jenny's brother.

The stellar cast of this movie, makes it the classic that it is. Jack Nicholson as Stoney, is in rare form. Even back when this movie was made, Nicholson's unique brand of screen charisma, was already evident. It's no wonder that he went on to become an acting legend. Bruce Dern also gives a notable performance, as Jenny's brother, Dave. Bruce deftly conveys the manic, electric energy, that radiates from Dave. Susan Strasberg did a good job of portraying the frightened, yet determined urchin, Jenny. But she doesn't shine as brightly as her co-stars do.

The plot of this film is beside the point. It's really a celebration of the 60s counterculture, and the wild lifestyles of it's participants in Haight Ashbury. The stoned hippies, love-ins, psychedelic art and music, etc., were all the main focus of this movie. I was a youngster back in late 60s. So I knew how it was then, and this movie gives an accurate account of that time-period. That era was wild and thrilling, to say the least. I recommend this film, to those that want to see how off-beat the 60s really were. Especially if you're a Jack Nicholson fan.",1261958400,3,1680,4.710884353741497
1829668,4,B00008973J,"I unfortuantely have yet to see Psych Out, and when I do I will edit this in.

But in the Trip, Peter Fonda takes LSD in 1967 to deal with his divorce, guided by Bruce Dern. He starts off enjoying himself, but then gets paranoid, seeing little hobbits killing him on beaches and in caves of modern L.A. He escapes the house he his tripping in, and comes down, finding himself in the same place he began.

The best sences are early ones: the interaction between Fonda and Dern is amazing to watch, and the big early 20th century mansion they are in, painted in psychadelic colors, is a real bonus prize.

When Fonda escapes, the film still works, but the interplay is gone. Still, this is a great view, for the first half, or as a period piece.",1260835200,3,743,4.330935251798561
1829669,5,B00008973J,"I enjoyed both of these movies very much! It was a chance to get a glimpse into the hippie sub culture and also showed me valuable insights into the history of the 1960's. These movies were NOT 'pro-drug' and showed how there was so much more to the counter culture movement then just hedonistic drug use. It actually was about so much more. This was the first time I ever got to look into that culture, and it taught me a lot about my country, my history and the people who made the way for modern rock, metal and punk. Very cool movies. I highly recomend them to everyone.",1253750400,4,574,4.275229357798165

1829681,1,B00008973J,"I was very disappointed with this DVD. The sound reproduction was abysmal. The video wasn't very good either; although, I can understand why transfer of a film after 40 years might result in less than optimal video. What I can't understand is why so much of the original footage was deleted from these DVDs.

CONCLUSION: A Big Disappointment.

1829683,4,B00008973J,One reviewer claimed The Trip was never released on video. Wrong. Years ago I purchased it when it was released on VHS. Wanted to put it up for sale on Amazon. Started reading these reviews. The American Flag played their music in the Trip and it's great 60s music. Anyone know if the Flag put out any other music like this? Didn't notice the film was cut on DVD. Psyche Out was new to me. Love the way those people looked back then. Too bad they hacked that movie up too. Two GOOD movies from that era. Glad to see people nowadays mirroring that time. And my woman said bellbottoms wouldn't come back.,1126483200,6,602,4.336283185840708
1829684,4,B00008973J,"What an experience here! Two long-forgotten movies, 'The Trip' ('67)which is about a disgruntled newscaster who's been recently fired (Peter Fonda) tries LSD to deal better with his problems, while under the supervision of a drug guru (Bruce Dern). Fonda goes through some rather pleasant as well as brutal hallucinations. Visuals include a love scene, some psychedelic images and Fonda being chased by armored demons (?) on horseback. Definitely, fun to watch. Then there's 'Psych Out' ('68) which has a runaway deaf girl (Susan Strasberg) looking for her brother, 'The Seeker' in the hippie borough of San Francisco where she ends up being befriended by Stoney (Jack Nickolson). A decent find. Features music by The Seeds and Strawberry Alarm Clock. Only trippers, hipsters, former biker wanna be's, bikers, later day hippies and fans of '60's culture would most likely get the most out of these two movies. Anyone else is chancing it. Recommended.",1124755200,10,950,5.215686274509804
1829685,1,B00008973J,"Sadly, The Trip and Psych-Out have apparently been cut up and censored beyond belief. And why?

Of course it was all done by the establishment, man. That's right - the powers that be don't want we the people to see and hear the real truth. They had already proved that by banning these flicks from VHS as well. This is just so totally bogus!

So I say we boycott these films until the Republican jack-boot army, that hates all expressions of peace and love, finally stops hiding all that beautiful footage from us!

Yes, I said boycott! Boycott! BOYCOTT!

UPDATE 2008: Checked back here a few years after my original review, to see if they might have cleaned up their DVD act, as some other studios have. But I find that they did not. Only the same chopped-up, censored version is still available. Absolutely unacceptable.

I urge everyone never to buy such junk, whether it be this DVD or any other similarly sliced movies. Until we can get the uncut and uncensored ORIGINAL theatrical release that the studios have hidden in their vault, forget it!",1083628800,48,1050,4.654054054054054
1829686,1,B00008973J,"The Trip and psych-Out, two great movies in same package, on DVD...sounds too good to be true, and is too good to be true, I'm afraid, since BOTH of the movies are shorter versions from the originals. So be aware, if you are about to buy this DVD, you won't get the whole movie. The movies have really been mutilated, I was really angry to notice how ridiculously they have been cut. Especially Psych-Out suffers from this mutilation. Since I'm writing my thesis about the 60's films, I really feel these movies earn a better treatment. I feel cheated, but I quess there is no way getting your money back if you live in Finland like I do. So, be aware, it's a rip-off.

1829687,3,B00008973J,"Was there nothing that modern technology could do to make the soundtrack to ""The Trip"" listenable? It sounds muffled and dialogue is sometimes hard to follow - I don't recall having this problem when I saw the film theatrically. Maybe they were trying to re-create the drive-in speaker experience. And why on earth edit ""Psych-Out,"" truthfully the better of the two films?
