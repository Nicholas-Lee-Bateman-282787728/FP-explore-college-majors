8256554,5,B0014Y00YM,"i liked this version. it showed how herbie was made and why he is like he is. this on involves another car but un-herbie like. racer angainst racer. good vs evil. and the cheaters try again. herbie searches for his new owner and finds trouble again.

it pretty much holds up to the rest of the love bug series. though i would have wanted a dvd of it ... so it won't wear out (or get eaten by a vicious vcr machine).

i will be trying to get the love bug tv series next ... i think there was only 4 episodes but it is supposed to be on dvd.

and wasn't there an animated love bug series for a while?

i will be looking into it.",1260921600,3,626,3.905511811023622
