Given that, I really wanted to love this series. I do love some aspects of it, but there are areas in which it could definitely improve.

Taking possible improvements first, I'm not familiar with Canadian schools, but I have a hard time believing students can be suspended indefinitely just for watching a fight or that a student can be expelled based solely on the word of another student without any further investigation. At the other end of the spectrum, a student who any reasonable person would have suspected of planting false evidence against a teacher with tragic consequences gets off with a wrist slap.

Also, some of the characters are overdrawn in the interest of humor. I like humor to arise from natural situations, and there are times where it seems forced here. For instance, the guidance counselor, Ms. McDonkey (yes, that's actually the character's name) acting as she does would never have gotten  through a job interview, much less survived working in a high school for more than a few days.  Are there high school staff members whose enthusiasm seems misplaced and who treat high school students like younger kids? Sure, but those problems are far more subtle in real life than they are here.

Just as the humor is sometimes overplayed, the more serious situations sometimes get underplayed. A fight with a drug dealer ends up being a relatively tame shoving match? I doubt a real drug dealer would attract the kind of attention a public showdown would bring, If he was fighting someone who'd cost him big money, it would be private--and there'd be blood and probably broken bones. I fear younger kids would get a very wrong impression about what confrontations with drug dealers are really like. The confrontation seems to be set up the way it is to produce the outcome the writer wants, regardless of the fact that it isn't even remotely realistic.

The drama connected to Hugh is closer to reality, but considering how much he suffers, his reactions are surprisingly mild. Sure, students can hold emotions in sometimes, but they're going to come bursting out sooner or later. Hugh raises his voice sometimes and does at least one dastardly thing as a result of his problem, but at times he'd be shouting in real life, and crying a little (or a lot) privately. His defiance of authority rings true, but he changes gears too easily. The intense emotions he should be feeling wouldn't disappear instantly because someone is kind to him.

I think perhaps the overall problem is that the series can't quite decide if it wants to a drama or a comedy. Yes, elements of both can be blended, but here the combination doesn't work as it should. The parent conference Hugh's parents attend is a good example. Their complete ineptitude and even their alcoholism is being played for laughs, even though the consequences are so obviously serious.

After all of that, why am I not giving this series one-star? Because despite all of that, there are bits that ring true and others that shine. The writer, when not unrealistic, is inventive. Situations are cleverly designed. The teachers' past lives are used effectively to explain how they are now. The principal, when not making completely irrational decisions, is believable, as is her secretary. Generally, the teachers, when not at their most extreme, have a lot of believable moments as well.

Leaving aside the overly tame drug dealer and Felice, another character somewhat exaggerated for comic effect, the students also ring true most of the time.  How tough it can be to be a teenager comes through well. Cassie does well as the girl who can't quite figure out what to do with the guys in her life. Hugh and James make an interesting contrast, especially when their lives prove to be somewhat the opposite of what an audience would first expect. James is perhaps the best part of the whole show. Without pulling out all the usual nerd stereotypes, the actor captures the adolescent for whom puberty is a real struggle. Even little details like the way he walks, the general feeling of awkwardness he projects, and the way he sometimes breaks eye contact when he's very emotional capture the reality of the situation very well.

There's also something about the general feeling of this series that's positive. It makes me feel as if its a passion project for people who really have their hearts in it. That's why I'll watch the second season despite the problems in the first.",1504051200,,4603,4.8286802030456855
