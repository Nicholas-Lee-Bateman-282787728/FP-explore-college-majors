8075523,4,B000A7G53E,"Great movie, great price and service. I watched this movie and great story. I really enjoyed hope you do too!
Update- I wanted to share this movie's story very touching movie about how the love of a dog or puppy or animal can change lives this was more than a movie it brought back fond memories of love of many dogs and cats when I was young and how much they give back and just know how to give love to us without trying know when we need them make us laugh, cry, laugh and play we can not forget no matter how old we are make time to laugh, love, play and yes cry our furry friends are always there even from beyond they wait for us to see us again some day.",1386633600,,661,3.9402985074626864
8075524,2,B000A7G53E,"The movie wasn't so much about the dog as about the two families in question (the family fostering the puppy for the first year and the receiving family). The acting - except for the Banner the dog - was stiff and over-acted. I don't feel like I learned the values the movie was intending to pass on. For example, within the family that fostered the dog, the purpose of doing the fostering was to teach their teenage son responsibility. Instead of making him be responsibility for the care of the dog, the parents allow him to pass on the majority of that responsibility to his younger sister who understandably becomes very attached to the dog. After much emotional difficulty, she passes the dog on to the recently disabled Curtis. Very little of the movie shows any detail of how Banner helps Curtis with his disability resulting in wasting a wonderful opportunity to continue showcasing the Kansas Specialty Dog Services purpose. Spoiler alert -- there's also no explanation of the abilty to ""retire"" the dogs which I would have appreciated a better understanding of.",1384560000,2,1071,4.85792349726776
8075525,5,B000A7G53E,"I Love movies like this!  It shows the love animal provide to humans
IT does meet my expectations of whatever sipnosis I read",1367712000,2,125,4.434782608695652
8075526,5,B000A7G53E,"The only thing better than seeing humans helping animals is seeing animals helping humans. Today there are many organizations around the world pairing disabled individuals with dogs and other animals. In this film, not only will you learn how the dog program works, but you will also see the redemption of two families helped by one special animal, a story that is happening again and again.",1364169600,2,391,4.9393939393939394

8075529,2,B000A7G53E,"I was about halfway through this film when I realized that it was basically a commercial for the Kansas Specialty Dog Service, which trains dogs to help people of a variety of disabilities. In that light, the movie plays a little better, understanding that the funding for such a project was likely very limited. Only a couple of ""name"" actors appear in this film, namely Diane Ladd (whose small role as Aunt Edna is largely for comic relief), and Pamela Bach (who is best-known for being married to David Hasselhoff). The only other recognizable actor is Allan Kayser, who played Bubba on ""Mama's Family."" The rest of the cast is limited to wooden cutouts who mostly mumble through equally wooden dialogue. The plot is fairly limited, keeping to two threads: the fall of a young husband and his subsequent recovery (which pretty quickly becomes a routine of bitterness directed at everyone and everything around him), and the raising of a puppy by a family who knows that it will eventually be returned to the KSDS. From the beginning, it's pretty obvious that the Labrador will wind up with the paralyzed young man.

Even though it is largely an infomercial, this film could have been so much more than it was. It's hard to fathom the producers couldn't locate more than a few actors who could utter their lines even semi-convincingly. Still, kids might find the movie a little interesting, particularly when Aunt Edna shares the screen with her ultra-pampered dog. But even kids will likely get bored at the myriad of lulls in this movie. It gets an ""A"" for effort, but a ""D-minus"" on execution.",1128470400,2,1598,4.7898550724637685
