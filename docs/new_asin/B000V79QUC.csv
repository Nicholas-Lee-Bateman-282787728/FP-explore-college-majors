8217204,4,B000V79QUC,"wonderful, artistic movie... not so great transfer... missed the original packing, which was like a book. Too bad I lost the original movie, but this movie is during a period when England had enslaved India and the rich played into their hands. A wonderful love story with the usual love triangle that is so superb. This movie is worth to purchase and watch. I have seen it so many times and I never get tired from watching it.",1407369600,,427,4.487179487179487
8217205,1,B000V79QUC,"The movie was not what I expected.  Rabindranauth Tagore was a great writer/poet, but still don't think that the movie was as good
as the reviews....",1407283200,,149,4.730769230769231

8217207,4,B000V79QUC,I am aTexan who has developed a. Crush on Bollywood movies. My friends are not interested. I guess the subtitles are too much for the ignorant.  Look at the other reviews for the story line. I love the main actress but I did not like her in this movie.,1394841600,,252,4.142857142857143
8217208,3,B000V79QUC,"I have always know that male and female are viewed differently in all cultures/societies.  This movie surely brings it to the forefront.
What really grabbed my attention was how a formerly educated woman and one not formerly educated; how they relate to the men ,other woman around them and one another. This is movie I purchased and pleased I did I like learning of various cultures and how their lives are viewed during certain time periods.",1314403200,2,443,4.828947368421052
8217209,5,B000V79QUC,"This movie has a very good history. The acting by Aishwarya Rai and others characters is just fine. Aishwarya Rai is such a beautiful and sensitive woman that it's heartbreaking seeing two men refusing a marriage proposition with her. After these refusals she got married but she is widowed after a year. For that reason, she's being ostracized by the society and even if she's very well educated and stunningly gorgeous, she can't get married again. I am not an Indian, and I don't know a lot about this particular condition in the old India. I've seen another movie on the same theme. It's called Water and it is directed by Deepa Mehta. Her movie also depicts the miserable life of the widows but to an extent much worse than in this movie. Those who don't like films with singing and dancing will be happy since there's none in this one. Personally I like this stuff, but Choker Bali is the kind of movie not suited for that.
