7937159,4,B00005BCKL,"FOR A LOW BUDGET MOVIE, THIS IS ACTUALLY GOOD. THE MOVIE IS ABOUT A BOXER WHO UNINTENTIONALLY KILLS A MAN AND THEN RETIRES. OUT OF WORK, HE THEN BECOMES A BODYGUARD FOR GIRLS THAT BELONG TO A PIMP NAMED GOLDIE [ICE-T]. THEN, PROBLEMS OCCUR AS GOLDIE OWES A DRUG DEALER NAMED BLACKIE [KOOL MOE DEE] A TON OF COCAINE MONEY. THIS MOVIE REALLY SHOWS HOW NEGATIVE A PIMP REALLY IS, IT ALSO SHOWS HOW COLD THE PIMP GAME REALLY IS. ICE-T ACTUALLY DID A GOOD JOB OF SHOWING WHAT A PIMP IS REALLY LIKE. FOR A MOVIE THAT SHOWS THE PIMP GAME'S TRUE SIDE, RENT OR BUY THIS AS SOON AS YOU CAN.",1058054400,3,580,4.1415929203539825
7937160,2,B00005BCKL,"I couldn't take the slowness of this film. I was really diggin' the script, but the actors (that's a whole different story). The characters lacked movement and expression. There's not much anyone can say after seeing this movie. ""Good intentions - bad outcome"", I reckon.",1014681600,,271,5.044444444444444
7937161,3,B00005BCKL,"The movies about a boxer who kills a man unintentionally & becomes a kinda bodyguard for Ice-T whores but he wants out. Ice wants to muscle in, into the crack game and goes to Kool Moe Dee for the base......the boxer double crosses them both and he rest. YOU'LL HAVE TO BUY THE MOVIE",998006400,,283,4.2592592592592595
