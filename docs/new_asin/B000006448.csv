8484576,1,B000006448,"This is by far the most poorly produced and horribly narrated documentary on the life of Selena.  First off, the narrator pronounces Selena's name wrong throughout the entire video.  There is nothing in this documentary that hasn't been said before on VH1 Behind the Music or in the documentary, ""Selena Remembered"".  The footage is weak, there are no interviews with Selena, just the same clips over and over again.  Selena fans please don't waste your money.  Buy ""Selena Remembered"" or buy the book ""Como La Flor"" if you want to learn about this amazing person's life.",992131200,18,571,4.90625
8484577,1,B000006448,"This video is a total waste of time for any Selena fan. I was disgusted after watching it, it's low budget, there's NONE of her music or videos, instead it's the same scenes over and over again in front of her old house  and around her gravesite with interviews from fans. And it looks like it  was done on someone's home computer. DON'T waste your money or your time!",952905600,26,368,4.318840579710145
