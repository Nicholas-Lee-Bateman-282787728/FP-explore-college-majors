8495896,5,B006AXZZ56,I saw Manon back in the early 50s and have searched for it for years and was delighted to find it.  I was very struck by the beauty of Cecile Aubry.  The story about post war Europe and people's struggles at that time was original and different.  The end featuring Jews attempting to get to Palestine was a surprise twist.,1378339200,2,322,4.333333333333333
8495897,4,B006AXZZ56,"Reading the reviews for the Alcina transfer, I was a bit apprehensive about what the Imovision disc would look like(especially as there were no reviews). Rest easy, Amazoners. Until Criterion steps up and grabs this gem, the Portuguese Imovision print will do just fine. The English(and Portuguese) subtitles are crisp and the transfer is blazing sharp. As far as the runtime goes, the Alcina version clocks in at, I believe, 87 minutes. I checked this one at a bit over 100 minutes. No special features. No lobby cards. No interviews. Just Clouzot at his post-war best.",1341532800,6,570,4.947916666666667
8495898,1,B006AXZZ56,"In my chasing down hard-to-find films over the years I've run across several that were in bad or terrible condition, but the 87-minute ""Alcina"" Studio issue ranks among the very worst.*

I first saw Henri-Georges Clouzot's 1949 ""Manon"" at a special showing in a US art house theater some time in the early 1950s; and then I watched a rental VHS copy of it about 30 years later, or some 25-30 years ago. Seeing it again now on DVD I realize that I had forgotten much of the film, and appreciate Clouzot's artistry as both screenwriter and director much more than I was ever able to earlier.

First I should say that Amazon's Product Description of this DVD is entirely accurate, both in their Editorial Review of the plot, and in the timing and other information given. But I must add that this DVD is virtually unwatchable. The audio is quite noisy throughout, and there are several major problems with the video: the top, bottom and right side of the film are all cut off, while there is a black bar running down the left side, from misalignment; black and white contrast is very badly washed out; and edge fading is severe, making everything look somewhat out of focus as when a videotape has been copied multiple times.

Many foreign-language movies from this era provided only sparse subtitles, just enough to let viewers follow the basic gist of the dialog, and this film is no different. White subtitles against a light or white background are always problematic, but especially so here because the grayscale contrast is so washed out.

Another major problem is that the movie is cut down from 100 minutes to only 87 minutes. Comparing this copy to a different edition I count ten or more scenes where at least small cuts were made, several of which were substantial, and three I consider crucial to understanding the story. Adjusting for NTSC-PAL conversion, and discounting differences in opening credits, etc, I calculate that at least 16-17 minutes total has been cut.**

I have no idea of the provenance of this copy. Alcina was the original 1949 producing studio of the film, as noted here by Amazon. The credits on the film itself are given in English, and the English subtitles are burned in, so obviously the DVD is taken from some source originally created for an English-speaking audience. One thing that's particularly strange, however, is that a title card is inserted about one hour into the movie, reading ""One Moment Please While We Change Reels"". Even in 1949 nothing like this would ever be shown in a real movie theater, and I'm tempted to think that this version may have been created for military use, with unsophisticated film equipment, in postwar Europe. This suggestion also ties in with at least several of the cuts made in the film, as scenes that military censors would prefer not to be shown, mostly for political or ethnic reasons. Two other cut scenes involve a whorehouse, and a fairly graphic but bloodless murder. On the other hand, near the end of the film when Robert is carrying Manon in her torn dress and more of her breast is visible than would have been usual in 1949, this sequence is not censored at all. But inexplicably, the finale described by Amazon as ""ironic and heart-rending"" *is* cut out for no discernible reason.

My opinion is that this present DVD, which is an all-region NTSC and will play on standard US players, is simply not worth having. It's a home-burned disc ""Published by Mad Phat Enterprises 2009, Copyright Video Yesteryear 1983"". I assume that all the cuts to the film had already been made in their source material, whatever it was. But I'm tempted to think that many of the problems with the film's video and audio must be at least partially the fault of Video Yesteryear's transfer, or of Mad Phat's subsequent transfer to DVD format.

I'm aware of two other releases of this film. There is a fine Korean release with a runtime of just over 100 minutes - the correct uncut length - with full and extensive subtitles available in Korean, Japanese and English. However, the English subtitles are either generated by a very unsophisticated computer translating program, or by a Korean with an extremely tenuous grasp of the English language, and they are frequently hilarious when they are not entirely incomprehensible. This is in NTSC format with no region code, so it will play on any player. Amazon's ASIN for this release is B0044SW9HQ; it has been available from Amazon.co.uk. Its UPC is 8809116472785.

The other release, which I have not seen, is distributed by Warner Home Video, and is sure to be in excellent condition. The runtime for this is given as 96 minutes, but since this is in PAL format rather than NTSC, I think it must also be the correct full length with no cuts. There are two possible problems with this release for American viewers. Of course this is a French film, and is undubbed. But this Warner edition comes with no subtitles at all, in any language, so you would need to be fairly fluent in spoken French to understand what's going on. Also, this is a Region 2 disc that will not even attempt to play on a standard US player - it will just give an error message unless you have an all-region player. This is currently available from Amazon.fr, Amazon.com's French affiliate, as ASIN: B003W15SJ2.

*Very unfortunately, posted reviews are copied higgledy-piggledy onto different releases of the same title, which makes it extremely difficult for a purchaser to distinguish between different editions that may range from excellent to execrable. This review pertains *ONLY* to the 87-minute home-burned disc attributed (actually, misattributed) to ""Alcina"" Studio. I am not familiar with the 91-minute edition released by ""Retro Flix"" (ASIN: B0041VJQ40) or any other releases beyond those specifically addressed here.

**Both this present home-burned edition and the Korean release are nominally in NTSC format, but playing them side-by-side, this one consistently runs slightly slower than the Korean copy, meaning that if it had been left uncut it would run several minutes longer than 100'.",1286496000,10,6096,4.864161849710983
