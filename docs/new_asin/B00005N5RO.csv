1628209,5,B00005N5RO,"I haven't seen many Brazilian films, but every one I've seen really blows apart--really challenges--your morals.  I claim that I can watch this with an open mind, in order to objectively judge the outcome, the impact to each of their lives.  Does each character find meaning in his/her life?
One aspect of the plot that is interesting, is Darlene the main character bears each man in  her life a son, except for her legal husband.  This has some fullfilling effect on these men.  Her husband on the other hand, emasculated in a sense, in the end does what he can to preserve some vestige of his manhood and status.
I love movies that take me somewhere.  This movie is beautifully shot, yielding many scenes of its stark beauty, but it by no means romanticizes.  The setting is of a vast dry land.  It is hot.  They live in mud houses (Of course this appealed to me in look and practicality.).  Everyone sleeps in hammocks.
The people, though very poor and unglamorous--to me this made them genuinely beautiful--have a rough life.  Darlene, the main character must work, even when pregnant harvesting in the cane fields.",1017187200,12,1119,4.716494845360825
1628210,4,B00005N5RO,"How often do you watch a movie in which the main character is a not very attractive woman in her thirties AND she has three men in her life?  If you answer pretty frequently, this movie is not for you.  I have to admit that the premise of the movie is nothing short of incredibly daring.  Yet, it is not something extraordinary.
After watching Central Station and a couple other Brazilian movies, I wonder if poverty is a key ingredient in Brazilian cinema.  However, these films are hardly exploitative and pity-inducing.  This is especially true with 'Me, You and Them'.  Poverty is a strong backdrop to this movie, however, the film does not allow it to overtake the overall tone of the film.  Behind the poverty, there is a prevailing sense of life.  The richness of life exists whether one is rich or poor.  This film does well in presenting this aspect while telling an ordinary story about a life of ordinary woman in perhaps an extraordinary circumstance.
The movie does not employ fancy plotlines.  There are not many peaks and valleys within the story and it is pretty consistent throughout.  In fact, a person unwilling to take a peek at somebody else's life, as mundane as it might be, would probably fall asleep before the end of the first half of the film.  In its simplicity, though, lies a beauty.  Much of the beauty lies with the fact that the film is impartial and holds back its verdicts.  Darlene's conduct might be seen as immoral, then again looking at her circumstances, couldn't it be justified? The film is unwilling to pass any judgments.  Even the ending does not suggest much, avoiding the cause and effects type of storytelling.
The cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking.  Like every other aspect of the film, it doesn't seek for the grandeurs.  As a result, there is a certain raw, stark quality to the images while still capturing the beauty of arid Brazil.
If you are a lover of international cinema, you do not want to miss this one.  You might finish the movie none the wiser, however, you will definitely be 'cinematically richer'.",1005091200,28,2077,4.706371191135734
1628211,4,B00005N5RO,"The movie tells us more than simply having kids from one man to another.
It's about Darlene's search for happiness in a dismal place -- where poverty is widespread & the land is barren.  It also shows why people create relationships & why they stick to it for various reasons.  Initially fooled & disillusioned by 1st love, Darlene wises up to accept a marriage proposal from Osias for security purposes (house & pension fund), in lieu of romance.  Being ordered around, she feels further helpless in her seemingly 'impotent' husband & finds love & respect in the arms of Zozhino, Osias' cousin.  Things would have been better but passion comes in, in the guise of Ciro, Darlene's co-worker.
Let us just say this film is not so ordinary despite its almost barren setting.  All these characters & their children live under one roof, & how they all get along, is something worth watching & analyzing.  The seemingly indifferent Osias brings with him a certain tension & what he does at the end is something to ponder about.",1003017600,12,1021,4.740112994350283
1628212,5,B00005N5RO,Its a beautiful film based on a real story. There is so much to say... just trust me on this one an buy it.,1001894400,3,107,3.5
1628213,2,B00005N5RO,"A Brazilian woman in her mid 30s is set to marry a man--she's pregnant by him--and he dumps her. She then finds another man with a house whom, she figures, can care for her child. She marries him. But, as it happens, he's lazy and wants her to wait on him hand and foot. Still, being a good wife and all, she engages in connubial bliss with him. She's pregnant again. Kid number two. But her husband is not the warmest of people.
The husband has a friend who's at the house quite a bit, who's much warmer than the husband and the woman becomes interested in the friend. They enjoy each other deeply and soon she's pregnant yet again. OK, so because you can count, of course, by now she's up to 3 kids. Now the friend is really nice and warm, et cetera, but he's not what you would call sexy.
OK. Then in the fields where she works, she meets another guy and this one IS sexy. Oh yeah. So they go to an isolated part of the field and enjoy each other deeply. (Believe me, there's a LOT of enjoying deeply going on in this flick). Then, you got it, she's preggers again. Kid number four.
OK, so the friend--who's already living in the house--now has to share the living space not only with the original husband and the woman, but also with this new sexy guy AND four kids. So now we're up to, let's see, eight people. That's a lot of people for a small house in rural Brazil. Oh yeah.
That's the story in a nutshell. It was no doubt made as a cry for women's independence--i.e., see, a woman can do these things too; it's not just a man who loves sex and can have it with whoever he wants.
The point is made repeatedly. I have no beef with women's lib or a woman being independent or a woman enjoying deeply. I just think a much better movie could have been made with this theme. The two stars are for the cinematography which is excellent, and for the superb music by Gilberto Gil.  Buy the soundtrack; it's excellent.",1001635200,7,1917,4.223433242506812

7946208,5,B00005N5RO,"An archconservative will not probably not like this movie. I shared the plotline with my family and they found it repulsive. To me, it is a lovely synchronization of visual and thespian skill. Other reviewers have provided a keen idea of the story. It's intriguing to see that a woman in an impoverished setting can arrange her life to suit her desires.",1396915200,,353,4.709677419354839
7946209,5,B00005N5RO,This movie has a way of  cheering me up.  Darlene makes the best of the hand she's been dealt and lives her life her own way.  It's very liberating to see a woman in charge.,1379894400,,173,3.8857142857142857

7946211,4,B00005N5RO,"This movie is funny and very interesting. It can be a little slow for the ""now generation"". Each child that is born looks nothing like her husband. The husbands female cousin has smart remarks with each arrival -- priceless. Very real world rural Brazil. I read other reviews focusing on birth control etc., but I found that I was looking forward to the next child to see how the child would look and the reaction around the arrival. If you take life too seriously and trying to look for hidden meanings/agendas -Not for you - Just enjoy it for what it is.....

Life goes on..........",1140220800,3,584,4.561904761904762
7946212,5,B00005N5RO,"I never write raves. But this is a very underestimated film. The screenplay is spare and polished. The actors - sublime. Regina Case is amazing in this role. Should have won all kinds of awards. Completely absorbing. Best film I've seen in a long time.

No violence, restrained sex - real life, with somebody you are really rooting for.",1138147200,5,336,4.694915254237288
7946213,3,B00005N5RO,"This story of a libidinous mother (who has apparently never heard of birth control of any kind) living in the Brazilian backwoods presents some of the best and worst of Brazilian cinema.  On the one hand: beautiful cinematography, which is no easy feat for a bleak landscape, and authenticity in sets, dialogue and characters.  On the other hand: the seemingly obligatory depiction of squalor both physical and moral, and a storyline that only intermittently entertains.  Sinto muito, but the film so merece tres estrelas.",1114041600,2,522,5.190476190476191
7946214,2,B00005N5RO,"I've seen quite a few brazilian flicks. To prove the point at hand, it's just obvious and very slow moving. The plot is not very intriguing.. not what I expected.",1106265600,,162,4.433333333333334
