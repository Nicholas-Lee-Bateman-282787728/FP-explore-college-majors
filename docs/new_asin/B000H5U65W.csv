2628686,5,B000H5U65W,"He-man era la serie animada que primero me llam la atencin. Despus, mucho despus llegaron G. I. Joe y los Transformers.

Cuando me compr la primera temporada de esta serie de animacin, me di cuenta que estaba tambin en espaol y con las voces originales del doblaje con las que fue transmitida en el canal de televisin abierta donde las segua cada domingo, religiosamente. Eso si, en desorden. Aqu, pude darme el lujo de verlas todas en el mismo orden de aparicin y, como ya indiqu, con las mismas voces del doblaje.

Excelente adquisicin para alguien a quien le haya gustado esta serie.

2628687,5,B000H5U65W,"He-Man and the Masters of the Universe was one of the best marketing ideas, as far as toylines go, of all time.  The TV show went hand-in-hand and this set of the final episodes to air is a great book-end to the entire set.  A lot of time and effort went into all of the Masters of the Universe DVD sets and this is no exception.

If you're a fan of He-Man or ever WERE a fan of He-Man, this is a ""must have"" set.  I do have one tiny gripe over all of the DVD sets though...

The dubbing of the sound doesn't exactly match the video so the mouths are just a slight bit off from the words (it's not overly bad...just something that needs to be mentioned in a review...call me picky)

By the power of Amazon...buy this product!",1168300800,,725,4.070422535211268
2628688,5,B000H5U65W,"You either love it or hate it. Me personal I loved the cartoon because that was one of the cartoons I grew up watching in the 80's. Yeah when I watch it now it seems pretty corny, but its still bring back the nostalgia of my childhood days. If you was a fan of this show growing up you owe it to yourself to purchase all four volumes.",1167868800,,334,3.926470588235294
2628689,5,B000H5U65W,"This set will fulfil your expectations.  The set is extremely well done.  It includes lots of extra features which include interviews, commentary and original artwork.  As for the episode content, the theme that good shall prevail over evil, continues. This set makes a great addition to the collection of He man fans everywhere, as well as anyone who grew up in the 80's.  The set is also very entertaining for young children.",1167868800,,427,4.888888888888889
2628690,5,B000H5U65W,I think it's great to bring He-Man out for the next generation.  We loved this show when we were kids so it's inevitable that our children will love it too.,1166572800,,156,4.2
2628691,5,B000H5U65W,"I regret to inform you that this is the last dvd set to the original Masters of the Universe series. When I look back to the time as I kid until now, I can officially say that Masters of the Universe is my favorite cartoon ever. The seemingly eternal battle between He-man and Skeletor continues. . . however, do we really want it to ever end? Anyways, we will come to expect great things with this finale.

In this set, there will be Episodes 98-130. Here, we will see some of the best storylines. Episodes such as ""The Secret of Grayskull"", ""The Problem With Power"", and ""Teela's Triumph"" are worth watching over and over again.

As with every set so far, there will be several featurettes about the making of the series. Along with that, there will also be character bios. Let's not forget that with every box set comes two art cards by some of the best contemporary artists. (These cards will be numbers 11 & 12 out of 16, which means that we can expect to have at least two more dvd sets containing the episodes of either the ""New Adventures of He-man"" or the new ""Masters of the Universe"" series that came out in 2002, so our adventure isn't over yet!)

For a lifelong fan, it's been a long wait to see something like this happen, which makes me very excited, as I hope that you are as well.",1156896000,5,1297,4.351239669421488
2628692,5,B000H5U65W,"Well the time has come. He-Man Season Two Volume Two has finally hit stores. Which means that the complete He-Man series is out. Episodes like The Problem  with Power, Visitors from Earth, Teela's Triumph, Orko's Return, and Not So Blind have power and potentcy with fans. The final documentary of the Stories of He-Man and a documentary called Animating He-Man round out the special features as well as a much anticipated preview of The New Adventures of He-Man due out in near future. Two excellent art cards finalize the He-Man set for this version.

Keep an eye out for She-Ra Princess of Power Season One Volume One due out in November, for He-Man crossovers as well as the Princess of Power herself, She-Ra. Let the power of He-Man return one final time!",1156204800,7,760,4.75
2628703,5,B000H5U65W,This is the original 1980's serial.  I used to watch these with my children as they were growing up.  It is so good to see them again now the children are grown.  They bring up so many good memories.,1288483200,,199,4.051282051282051
2628704,5,B000H5U65W,"The Final volume of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, has the same type of action, adventure, humor, and well written stories as the previous volumes of this series.

2628705,5,B000H5U65W,"I remember the day. I was not looking without the least bit of expectation, then behold...I saw it!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/He-Man-and-the-Masters-of-the-Universe-Season-Two-Vol-2/dp/B000H5U65W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">He-Man and the Masters of the Universe - Season Two, Vol. 2</a>. I felt like an archeologist. It was difficult keeping myself poised in the store. I could careless what it cost and made every excuse with tunnel vision. I think I put I on a credit card. They are relatively inexpensive.
  I forego the conclusion that if 2 of 2 is out then all previous volumes must also be...How Nice! I had found the last, first! The following day I watched the entire volume in 12 hours. Then within 3 weeks I had the entire collection. Thereafter, I disciplined myself to watch one episode a day, it was not easy.
I would have been happy if the dvds were less than perfect, but I could not believe how much meticulous attention each episode got, with pristine quality due to BCI Eclipse. It was more than I wanted.  Thereafter that, it just did not stop. Some of the most landmark cartoons of the 80's are in retail!...YES!!!",1249948800,4,1183,5.315508021390374
2628706,5,B000H5U65W,"These DVD sets of He-man are better than I remember.  The colors are excellent.  I especially like that there is a lesson to live by at the end of each episode.

2628708,4,B000H5U65W,"Whoever coined the term ""all good things must come to an end"" was surely influenced by Filmation's epic fantasy show, He-Man and the Masters of the Universe. As hard as it is to imagine, the second volume of the second season represents the grand finale of the entire 130-show run. Coming from a fan of the show since its days in syndication, it was with great interest that I set off on a voyage of blissful nostalgia in reviewing the entire He-Man and the Masters of the Universe DVD series from BCI. When presented with the notion of 130 episodes spanning across 4 box sets of 6 discs each, it is easy to get into the false notion that the good times will never end. Unfortunately, here we are at the final installment of the classic series.

Despite the fact that there is an unmistakable sadness that taints the viewing experience (after all, we realize that this is goodbye), the show's writers managed to break out of the slight slump that they apparently fallen into during the first half of the season. Unlike the first half, where additions to Mattel's corresponding toy line meant the introduction to several new characters (save Roboto), the second half works more closely with the formula discovered in the first season: the plots are bit more lesson-oriented but with slightly richer animation quality.

At this point in time, the Filmation creative machine was changing gears for the upcoming She-Ra: Princess of Power series but their efforts in closing out He-Man were a worthy farewell. Those expecting some kind of closure or finale may be disappointed to learn that each and every episode of the 130 was designed to be a stand-alone plot (with resolve) and # 130 is no different. Interestingly, Larry Ditillio (one of the show's staff writers) went on to say that had Filmation decided to write multi-part episodes, it is likely that they would have had no shortage of material to work from for future seasons. As it stands, the reason for the show's demise was based not only on a lack of financial backing but also because the writers were basically tapped out as far as developing an additional 65 (or more) stand-alone plots was concerned.

Preventing this experience from being ridden with sadness, fans can take solace in the fact that BCI has gone the extra mile to continue releasing their excellent He-Man related DVD sets to enjoy. Directly following this incarnation of the show are three 6-disc She-Ra: Princess of Power DVD sets, two 6-disc New Adventures of He-Man sets, and at present, the first (of three) 3-disc sets has been released celebrating the impressive 2002 Mike Young Productions version of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe.

I've said it before and I'll say it again: About the best thing that can happen to a series is discovering that BCI is the company bringing it to DVD release. This installment is no exception!

Hunt For He-Man
The Greatest Show On Eternia
Not So Blind

Extras are once again abounding. The sixth disc contains inspiration for some of the various episodes between numbers 99-130, facts and trivia, scripts etc. Also noteworthy is the fantastic conclusion to the multi-part Filmation history called Animating He-Man and the Masters of the Universe. Very interesting stuff! 3 episodes contain full audio commentary and like always, BCI packs in a pair of 4x6"" collectible art cards, this time from artists: Dan Brereton and Mike McKone.",1209945600,3,4040,4.889051094890511

2628710,5,B000H5U65W,"This is the last volume of this series, not including the spin- off She-Ra Princess of Power. This show is still one of the best children's stories ever made. It is an action adventure, that also teaches different leasons. These include moral (ethical), the importance of learning, and the fact that anyone can do or be anything they want, if they try.

I enjoy it now, as much as I did when I first saw it in the 1980s. It has not lost a thing. It is great for family viewing.",1175817600,,477,4.241758241758242
2628711,4,B000H5U65W,"This wraps up the He-Man series completely, giving you the last half of Season 2.

The animation is high quality, produced by Filmation in the 1980s. The packaging is well designed. If you buy all four volumes of seasons 1&2, the DVD boxes will sit side by side on your shelves making up a nice pictorial display on the covers.

Now I anxiously hope for She-Ra season 2 as well. If they release that, the entire He-Man and She-Ra output from Filmation in the 1980s will be available on DVD.",1175472000,3,490,4.433333333333334
2628712,3,B000H5U65W,"As far as the whole He-Man series goes there are several episodes that I don't remember and to say the least from what I do remember it wasn't a bad show. Some of the fissures should have been worked out of before the episodes were aired. But hey nothing's perfect.

[My most memorable charcters for me were Orko, Evil-in and The Sorceress]

The most disturbing thing I found was the lack of reference to his sister through out the serious. For those who did not keep up with She-Ra Princess of Power that is his sister. I think it was mostly due to the possibility that He-Man serious of the late 80s was already at an end by the time She-Ra started. (as far as the writing goes)

King Randor had two babies, a set of twins Prince Adam and Princess Adora. (He -Man and  She-Ra) On the show I watched He-Man appeared quite often but she never appeared on He-Man so it was kind of like they never bothered to include her fighting along his side from time to time. Maybe the writers didn't think it was wise to write her in at least sometime into the second year, I don't know. But I'll have to include it into my collection. You shouldn't have one without the other you know.",1170374400,,1174,4.298642533936651
