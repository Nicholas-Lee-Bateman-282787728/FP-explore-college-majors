668257,5,6303490972,"...and add the following recommendations. Watch this film alongside another pair of mid-80s films in the ""When Very Weird Things Happen to Very Bored (White?) Guys"" genre. I'm speaking first of John Landis' ""Into the Night,"" starring Jeff Goldblum (can't get to sleep) and Michelle Pfieffer, but most memorable to me for the David Bowie-Carl Perkins(!) knife-fight. Second is Martin Scorcese's ""After Hours,"" starring Griffin Dunne (can't get out of Soho), Rosanna Arquette, Catherine O'Hara, Cheech & Chong, Linda Firoentino, Teri Garr, etc. Of this divine trinity of put-upon nerds, ""Something Wild"" holds up best for me. All, however, are lots of fun, with ""After Hours"" being, unsurprisingly, the darkest of the three, and ""Into the Night"" being the most fantastic. BTW, any fan of ""Something Wild"" who hasn't checked out the soundtrack is missing a gem!!!",994896000,2,860,5.2846715328467155
668258,5,6303490972,"With only philadelphia and silence of the lambs to refer to, I never could fully understand why Johnathon Demme was so highly touted. But After viewing this film I can see That Demme certainly was an American voice to be reckoned with at one point. This film crackles and gyrates like no other American movie at the time , except for perhaps the categorically similar After Hours. The way this film seems to be so thematically aware of the time it was taking place in is almost revelatory. a true achievement that all too sadly illuminates the sheer and utter waste of Demme's later career, much like what My Own Private Idaho does to that of Gus Van Sant. Plus the great American rock band the Feelies make an unexpected cameo.",993081600,2,728,4.564885496183206
668259,5,6303490972,"I have no complaints about the quality of the DVD.  The movie itself I give 5 STARS.  Melanie Griffith is a delight in the role of Lulu (and led me to having a crush on her yow!).  Lulu is a woman who's been leading a freewheeling, marginal life of a kind that must have reminded Ms. Griffith a bit of her own wild times, but with a better outcome.  Anyway, the movie starts out lighthearted with Lulu essentially shanghaiing (sp?) Jeff Daniels away from his empty job in NYC and off to her high school reunion in PA.  There, the couple run into Ray (Ray Liotta) who's Lulu's real husband and who is also fresh outta jail and looking to get the one good thang (Lulu) back in his life.  At this point (about the last 30 minutes or so) the movie turns from freewheelin' fun to drama and violence.  Kind of like life, eh?  One minute you're up, the next....  I recall reading a review once that said the movie wasn't as popular as it should have been because it didn't fit neatly as either a comedy or a drama. Pity it wasn't marketed as both.  Go for it!",983923200,6,1052,4.215
668260,4,6303490972,"After recently re-watching ""Something Wild"", I was reminded why Jonathan Demme was one of the more promising new directors of the 80's,before being reduced to a hired hand on Oprah Winfrey's ego project ""Beloved"". Melanie Griffith and Jeff Daniels (before his one-note aw-shucks Jimmy Stewart persona became tiresome)give top performances as the kooky free spirit and the (initially) uptight yuppie. Demme successfully blends classic 30's-style screwball comedy with some surprisingly frank sexuality (for a Hollywood film). A mid-80's zeitgeist fills each scene with rich neon colors and a very hip selection of music. The introduction of Ray Liotta's well played, menacing psycho ex-husband character, while initially jarring, saves the film from becoming merely a collection of zany, episodic vignettes, adding interesting dramatic tension. There are also enough subtle layers to the characters that make the film worth repeated viewings. A definite sleeper that has aged well.",981417600,4,980,5.719178082191781

Upon checking, I discover it's being played at the 4-hour speed (LP).  This is sometimes done in order to get a longer movie on a  shorter cassette to save manufacturing costs.  It's not always indicated on  the box.
I was disappointed at this, for the price I paid.  Movies at  Wal-Mart for cheaper might be that way; at least I'm not surprised  then.  But I was with this purchase.",958694400,6,542,4.5625
668263,5,6303490972,"I thought Demme walked on water after seeing this movie (and its follow-ups, Married to the Mob and Silence of the Lambs). I love the layers of texture to this movie--there's always some set decoration I never  noticed before, and the performances he wrings out of his stable of actors  is great. This movie defined ""alternative"" when it was released,  and deftly pulled off the seemingly impossible feat of starting out  screwball comedy and turning violent halfway thru without losing its voice.  All three leads have never done better than they did here (okay, maybe  Liotta in Goodfellas). So why is SW subjected to the basement of video VHS?  This movie made tons of critics top 10 lists for the Eighties (sadly not  much of a challenge, but still...) and yet can't even get a DVD date to  prom. Wild...",957225600,28,808,4.714285714285714

668462,5,6303490972,"Something Wild is somewhat of a lost gem and leave it to Criterion to select it for a new and wonderful transfer.  It is by far and away the best thing that Griffith has ever done.  She's gritty, intelligent, ironic and never plays for schlock.  She was very well directed by Demme, appearing controlled and reserved in her character's journey.  The veiled references to Louise Brooks and Frida Kahlo in Lulu/Audrey's character are a welcomed and an insidiously wonderful touch.  She is brilliantly supported by Jeff Daniels and Ray Liotta.  Something Wild also contains the best New Wave soundtrack ever attached to a film, of course assembled by Laurie Anderson and John Cale.  Amazing what can happen to a soundtrack when the talent behind it is knowledgeable, pertinent and relevant.  The music is integral and perfectly matched to the action.

Most importantly, Audrey gets her way, men be damned.  She runs the show from beginning to end.  Despite her flailing street angst and bad choices, her character is driven by her inner passions and logic from beginning to end.  Demme got this right from the get go and never lets Audrey founder in predictable, paternalistic drivel.  She sacrifices nothing and emerges strong, resilient and determined.  The wild child who gets it right.  Daniels is perfectly cast as Audrey's dim-witted, delusional and cuddly cohort.  No one could possibly play the brainwashed corporate dork better than Daniels, except, maybe Ed Begley Jr.?",1432512000,5,1476,5.0875

668602,3,6303490972,"The first half of the film is great, which is why I'm giving it three stars; Melanie Griffith plays a zany, sexy character named Lulu who takes buttoned-up Charlie (Jeff Daniels) on the ride of his life. They're both funny and part of the charm is wondering what craziness is going to happen next.

Unfortunately, the movie switches gears when Lulu's ex-con husband (Ray Liotta) shows up. It becomes a sinister story that bears little resemblance to the wonderful first half. Lulu's character is especially problematic because she changes to a damsel-in-distress that Jeff Daniels now needs to rescue. What happened to her zaniness?

We're given a happy ending, but once again, Lulu shows up wearing an outfit more fit for a Fifth Avenue cocktail party than the East Village bon vivant we met at the beginning. Her complete shift in character is what makes this film an uneven and unsatisfying outing.",1397347200,2,901,4.921052631578948

""Something Wild"" is one of those movies that you just can't stop watching.  I struggle to refer to this as a comedy, and that is part of the beauty of this movie.  It starts off seeming like a comedy, draws you in, and then takes you on a journey through poignant drama, romance, action, and suspense.  By the end of the movie you may have experienced every possible emotion.  The characters are odd and quirky, but believable, even as they transform from who they think they are (or want to be) into who they actually are. And as swiftly as the characters transform, so does the mood/tone of the movie, keeping you on the edge of your seat from the very beginning to the very end.",1396742400,,785,4.3493150684931505

668695,5,6303490972,"It's hard to believe that this movie is almost thirty years old.  It provided Ray Liotta's with his first real substantive part, and although Melanie Griffith and Jeff Daniels had had a bit more experience, it was relatively early in their careers too.  It's an engrossing movie -- it keeps you off balance at first, since we don't know enough to make sense of the different kinds of ""wild"" behavior on the part of Daniels's and Griffith's characters.  Daniels (Charlie) seems to be a married, suburban husband who has just made VP in a financial firm, and Griffith (Audrey/Lulu) seems to be a quintessential free spirit, and she takes Charlie for a ride that he seems not totally unwilling to be taken on, and presents him as her husband to her mother (who isn't fooled, and we soon find out why) and to her high-school reunion classmates.  The reunion, by the way, provides Jack Gilpin and Sue Tissue with a neat cameo, as one of Charlie's co-workers and his pregnant wife.  But we learn at the reunion that Charlie isn't married -- his wife took the kids and ran off with a dentist nine months earlier, so that puts a new perspective on wildness and puts Audrey's wild behavior in a new context, the effect of which is to make us more sympathetic to Charlie and Audrey -- or rather it enables the audience to somewhat settle their feelings about these characters and to see their behavior up to that point in more clearly comic terms than had appeared at the time.  But then a different kind of wildness enters the scene in the person of Ray (Ray Liotta), Audrey's violent ex-con husband.  He wants Audrey back, but she isn't up for THAT degree of wildness.  But he carts her off after beating up Charlie, at which point the worm turns -- Charlie is determined to get her back.  The problem for Jonathan Demme at this point is to blend comedy, suspense, and violence, and he does it masterfully, allowing each its due (one important feature is the quality of the witty writing for the violent Ray).  Blending of this kind creates its own uneasiness ( different from that of the movie's beginning), but fans of the later ""Fargo,"" for example, will understand how these things work.

Good performances by all -- Melanie Griffith, with that little-girly voice, is always an appealing actress, and Liotta is effectively funny and frightening.  Jeff Daniels is perfect too -- he's one of these actors who never calls attention to himself, but never puts a foot wrong.  Demme directs with splendid efficiency.  Add lucid cinematography from Tak Fujimoto, and a great score, and you have a winner.",1390694400,2,2593,4.695364238410596

668784,4,6303490972,"If you've ever wondered what Don Johnson and Antonio Banderas ever saw in the now plastic surgery experiment known as Melanie Griffith, check out this nice film by Jonathan Demme.  I remember seeing the film in theaters but recalled there was something off-putting about it.  Like many films it is advertised as something it's not.  This is not a comedy...at least in the traditional sense.  It starts out with a very, very hot Lulu (Griffith) picking up straight laced Charlie (Jeff Daniels) in a New York caf.  She lures him into her pimped up car and off they go, headed to Pennsylvania.  This is really crazy stuff for Charlie who just got a promotion at a brokerage house.  It isn't like him.  He says he has a family.  Still, he like the rest of us red blooded American boys can't resist Lulu.  Griffith dazzles in her dark wig and short skirts.  Charlie initially gets what he was promised and we pretty much get to see it all (yeah!).  This is the part where Don and Antonio knew what they were doing.  Once in Pennsylvania, Lulu changes her appearance and her name (her given name of Audrey) and visits her mom, presenting Charlie as her new hubby.  Then they go to Audrey's high school reunion.  Here's where the tone changes dramatically.  She meets her ex - well they never made it official since he was in prison for the last 5 years - played in a cool, menacing style by Ray Liotta in his first movie.  He is very scary and still has feelings for Audrey.  She not so much.  The film becomes a terroristic thriller from here on, culminating in a mean, realistic battle at Charlie's house on Long Island.  Most critics liked this film, most audiences did not.  The shift in tone is upsetting but that is the idea.  At the same time there is a period in the second act where the film stalls.  Once Ray (Liotta) begins his road trip to find Charlie and Audrey/Lulu, the film seems to just tread water until the final act.  This is one to watch if for nothing else than Melanie Griffith giving one of her best performances and a young Ray Liotta emerge as a star.",1318550400,4,2072,4.449468085106383
668785,4,6303490972,"Jonathan Demme's kinky, crazy, off-kilter 1986 road trip starring Jeff Daniels, Melanie Griffith and Ray Liotta and noted for it's vivid cinematography by Tak Fukimoto, never misses a beat as it careens down the highways to eventual romance.

Jeff Daniels is a strait-laced businessman having lunch at a downtown New York hole-in-the-wall diner where he meets cute, quirky, free-spirited Melanie Griffith and accepts a ride back to work that detours to a motel quickie (in handcuffs).  This is just the beginning of a dangerous, fast-paced amalgam of thriller, drama, comedy (kind of) and love story that is really about what happens when two people reveal their secret selves.  The unusually precise and perceptive soundtrack (David Byrne and others) adds immeasurably to the pleasure of this film experience.  Ray Liotta in his feature film debut is a memorably menacing presence.",1311638400,,882,5.323741007194244
668786,4,6303490972,"As usual, The Criterion Collection provides a bevy of wonderful films alongside easily the greatest assortment of supplementary materials. But what can be debated are the choices of the films chosen.

SOMETHING WILD is by no means a top AFI pick or all-time blockbuster hit or any of the traditional benchmarks of a notable film - except for one. Directed by Jonathan Demme, SOMETHING WILD came at a time when Demme began to take the wonderful tools he had learned studying Hitchcock and working with Roger Corman to more mainstream audiences. After making the highly under-appreciated MELVIN & HOWARD, Demme finally grabbed some national attention with his Talking Heads' documentary STOP MAKING SENSE, and then came SOMETHING WILD.

Don't lie to yourself. Loving this movie because Melanie Griffith is topless with handcuffs in the first ten minutes isn't wrong. It's part of the film's undeniable charm. You never know where this film is going to go from one moment to the next. And it includes a handful of wonderful cameos which further film's feeling of a gem that is being rediscovered.",1308960000,10,1093,5.033149171270718
668787,4,6303490972,"Academy Award winning director Jonathan Demme is well-known for his films such as ""The Silence of the Lambs"" (1991), ""Philadelphia"" (1993) and the remake of ""The Manchurian Candidate"" (2004) but many years before these films, he had been directing since the early '70s beginning with ""Caged Heat"" in 1974.

The film would be the first major collaboration between Jonathan Demme and cinematographer Tak Fujimoto (""The Silence of the Lambs"", ""The Sixth Sense"") and in 1986, having worked together for several films, the duo once again returned to work on the film ""Something Wild"", written by E. Max Frye (""Band of Brothers"").

The film would star Jeff Daniels (""Good night, and good luck"", ""SPEED"", ""Pleasantville""), Melanie Griffith (""Body Double"", ""Working Girl"", ""The Bonfire of the Vanities"") and Ray Liotta (""Goodfellas"", ""Identity"", ""Smokin' Aces"").  And the film would not only become a cult hit, each of the three major talent received a Golden Globe nomination for their performance in the film.

Also, a highlight of the film was its music soundtrack featuring music from New Order, Oingo Boingo, UB40, Fine Young Cannibals, David Y Celia, Jimmy Cliff and Sister Carol to name a few.  The film had two composers, John Cale (""American Psycho"", ""Shrek"", ""The School of Rock"", ""Sid and Nancy"") and music artist Laurie Anderson.

While ""Something Wild"" has received a DVD release back in 2001, the DVD has been out of print for quite some time.  But now the Criterion Collection will be releasing their second Jonathan Demme film (the first was ""The Silence of the Lambs - The Criterion Collection #13') on Blu-ray and DVD in May 2011.

The film would receive a restored high definition digital transfer supervised by cinematographer Tak Fujimoto and was approved by Jonathan Demme.

VIDEO:

""Something Wild"" is presented in the director's approved aspect ratio of 1:78:1.  Director of photography Tak Fujimoto supervised the restoration and the final high-definition digital transfer was approved by director Jonathan Demme.

According to the Criterion Collection, this new high definition digital transfer was created on a Spirit Datacine from a 35 mm interpositive. Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, warps, jitter and flicker were manually removed using MTI's Digital Restoration System and Pixel Farm's PFClean system, while Digital Vision's DVNR system was used for small dirt, grain and noise reduction.

With that being said, if you want the best presentation of this film, you will definitely want to get the Blu-ray release.  But I will say that this DVD release is fantastic, especially when comparing the picture quality to the 2001 DVD release.  The PQ looks a lot cleaner and doesn't look aged at all.  I would assume that since the film is shot outdoor for many scenes, that the Blu-ray release will be much more vibrant but still, this is a really good presentation of the film on DVD and fans of the film should be happy.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Something Wild"" is presented in 2.0 Surround.  According to the Criterion Collection, the soundtrack was mastered at 24-bit from a 35 mm magnetic track and clicks, thumps, hiss and hum were manually removed using Pro Tools HD.  Crackle was attenuated using AudioCube's integrated workstation.

Similar to the video, if you want the best presentation for audio, you will definitely want to go for the Blu-ray release.  Otherwise, the 2.0 surround track is clear through the front channels.  I opted to set my receiver to play stereo on all channels for a more immersive soundtrack but for the DVD sounds great.  I didn't notice any audio defects and the dialogue and music were crisp and clear, especially during those short action sequences.

Subtitles are presented in English SDH.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Something Wild - The Criterion Collection #563' DVD comes with the following special features:

- Interviews - The following interviews are featured: Director Jonathan Demme (33:14) on working on the film and casting the talent and writer E. Max Frye (9:19) talking about how he came up with the story for the film and why he chose Jonathan Demme to direct the film.
- Trailer - (2:27) The original theatrical trailer for ""Something Wild"".

EXTRAS:

Included is a 20-page booklet featuring the following essay ""Wild Things"" by David Thompson.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Melanie Griffith definitely made heads turn when she played the porn star in Brian De Palma's ""Body Double"" in 1984.  I have no doubt that she is going to make heads turn with her erotic and mischievous performance in ""Something Wild"".

A film that is a vindication for Jonathan Demme who saw his previous film ""Swing Shift"" being re-shot and changed due to actress Goldie Hawn and the studio insistence as they were not content with the film's serious tone, a tone that Demme wanted the film to be.

His work on ""Swing Shift"" was not what he and Taku Fujimoto were expecting and for Jonathan Demme, it could have been the end of his filming career as he was discontent with what had happen to his film.  But fortunately, screenwriter E. Max Frye was a fan of one of Demme's films and had him on the shortlist with Martin Scorsese.  With Scorsese busy with another film, Demme was brought back in but this time, giving him the creative freedom to make ""Something Wild"" the way he wanted it to be.

What we get is a sexually-charged '80s film but with characters that have depth but also have a mysterious side to them that is revealed as the storyline progresses.

Melanie Griffith plays a multi-dimensional role as a mysterious and care-free woman who is looking for trouble but somehow the man she ends up being interested in, is not your average bad boy.  He's a straight-laced, clean cut guy who is a successful businessman but a man who likes to dabble in the side of danger, even if that danger may be him not paying his tab at a diner.  But it's the sexual tension between Lulu and Charles that captures everyone to the big screen.  The eroticism at the beginning of the film shows us that Griffith literally owned the role, she was perfectly cast and did a wonderful job.

Jeff Daniels on the other hand does a very good job at playing the clean cut guy who probably is tired of being clean-cut but willing to do small things that he can always get away with by pretending that her forgot to pay for his tab.  But you know this guy wouldn't do anything to risk his career. Lulu knows it and we see in the beginning of the film that she tries to make his life a little bit unpredictable when she handcuffs him while on top of him and then calling his office and then literally making him talk to his boss while she pleasures him.  Daniels plays the innocent guy very well, as Griffith can easily play the naughty girl role as she did with ""Body Double"" but this time around, showing us that she has tremendous potential as an actress (which should earn her an Academy Award nomination for her starring role in the 1989 film ""Working Girl"" and a Golden Globe nomination for her role in ""Something Wild"").

But perhaps the biggest surprise was Ray Liotta, the soap opera star from ""Another World"" and only appeared in TV series, being given the chance to be in a feature film.  Liotta did a fantastic job as the ex-convict Ray who literally has an aura which makes you feel that he is a guy up to no good.  I have no doubt that his role and strong performance in ""Something Wild"" was what gave him the opportunity to play a tough guy and one of the main characters in Martin Scorsese's 1990 film ""Goodfellas"".

""Something Wild"" is now a cult film that people still love to watch because it's a unique movie.  Both director Jonathan Demme and writer E. Max Frye managed to create a film that is built around its characters and fortunately, casting was perfect for this film and working with Daniels, Griffith and Liotta paid off.  We know that Charles friendship/relationship with Lulu would get him into trouble but instead of going through the usual banal route of a spiraling person out of control, instead we see how both Charles and Lulu eventually compliment each other.

As for the Blu-ray and DVD release of ""Something Wild"", I wish there was an audio commentary included, as a Criterion Collection release without one is usually unheard of.  Special features are more on the short side but you do get about 45 minutes of special feature content with interviews with director Jonathan Demme, writer E. Max Frye and the film's original theatrical trailer plus a 20-page book. You do get a much better transfer on DVD (and I'm quite confident that the film looks and sounds even better on Blu-ray) than its 2001 DVD counterpart but you have to give credit to the Criterion Collection for taking an '80s film (which could have shown it's age) and really giving Criterion fans a solid transfer.  ""Something Wild"" looks very good on DVD and I can only imagine how magnificent it would look on Blu-ray.

While Jonathan Demme will always be remembered for his work on ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and possibly even ""Philadelphia"", his work on ""Something Wild"" is possibly among my favorite films from the director because this could have been a dark and twisted film.

Demme and E. Max Frye chose to focus on character development and we can see the transformation of these characters as the story progresses and thanks to the wonderful performances by the three talents, the efficacy of ""Something Wild"" was realized with its strong plot and its fun musical soundtrack made ""Something Wild"" a highlight for me back in the mid-80's.

Overall, ""Something Wild"" is possibly one of the more accessible Hollywood films released from the Criterion Collection.  If you are looking for a fun, smart, upbeat black comedy...you can't go wrong with ""Something Wild"".

Definitely recommended!",1306195200,3,9839,4.842891278375149
668788,5,6303490972,"Jonathan Demme is a unique talent. The director moved seamlessly from comedy to dark drama and action within the same movie years before Tarrantino did the same thing in his films. ""Something Wild"" remains one Demme's finest films.

Criterion does a terrific job of bringing ""Something Wild"" to us in a high def transfer for Blu-ray.

A brief summary of the plot (those who have seen the movie can skip it--Jeff Daniels plays Charles Driggs an uptight businessman who meets Lulu (Melanie Griffith)in a diner and is immediately taken with her to the point where he chucks his day and ends up on the road involved with her. It becomes clear when Ray (Ray Liotta)a dangerous and demented criminal appears that Lulu isn't everything she appears to be and Charles may be in trouble.

Jeff Daniels does a terrific turn as Charlie a man who had everything and lost it all suddenly rediscovering the excitement of life when he meets the impulsive Lulu (or Audrey as he later discovers). Griffith likewise does a great job as Lulu finding the heart of this ""free spirit"" who really is very injured. Once Ray Liotta appears he steals the rest of the movie in his turn as Ray.

Criterion does a terrific job of bringing the movie to Blu-ray with a nearly flawless looking transfer that looks positively stunning. This new transfer was created form a newly struck interpositive transfers created from the original negative of the film and supervised by DP Tak Fujimoto and approved by Demme. There's a nice layer of fine grain present to just remind us that this IS a film. The image hasn't been overprocessed so there's a nice level of detail present throughout. Colors pop and skin tones are accurate to the original intention of the direcotor.

The film appears in its 1.78:1 preferred aspect ratio.

The 2.0 audio mix sounds quite nice with dialogue front and center as it should be during the comedic and dramatic moments in the film.

The extras are extremely good if a bit on the slight side especially compared to other Criterion releases. There's a 30 minute entertaining interview with Demme that's quite entertaining. There's also a 13 page essay by film critic David Thompson. We also get an interview with the writer E. Max Frye (""Band of Brothers"")included as well. I'm a bit disappointed that Demme wasn't asked to do a commentary track and missing-in-action here are stars Jeff Daniels, Ray Liotta and Melanie Griffith all of which could have provided additional insight into the making of the movie.

Perhaps there were some cost/licensing issues that prevented more special features from being provided but why the actors couldn't have given new interviews, audio commentary tracks, etc. is beyond me.

Although a bit slight on the special features, ""Something Wild"" receives a lovingly done transfer with input from Demme and Takimoto. I doubt that the film would have received as extensive a restoration by any of the major studios.

Highly recommended.",1305417600,3,2961,4.904
668789,4,6303490972,"Similar to the style of E. Max Frye's screenplay, the Criterion Collection playfully steers it's fans into a special admirable treat at different turns and in different directions. Jonathan Demme's on the road masterpiece, ""Something Wild"", is certainly an uncouth but enjoyable gift for cult fans and Criterion aficionados like myself. Jonathan's passion in making this film gushes out of the pores of every scene and character introduction, from the minor roles to the larger ones, no one is left unscathed; moreover, the actors express an enthusiastic delight in Jonathan's style and willingly embrace it by adding their distinct values and genuine charisma.

  Don't ever judge a film by a simplistic plot because Jonathan Demme will effortlessly quell and eradicate any potential space for such pre-mature thoughts.
Charles Driggs, played by an conservative but never dull Jeff Daniels is caught in the act of casually walking out on a lunch tab. His inner rebellious side is accidently exposed to a funky, free-spirited and very uncouth Lu Lu ( later to be revealed as Audrey) played by Melanie Griffith. Charles sly misdeed ignites Lu Lu's impulsive nature before following him outside the restaurant to point out his petty crime. Initially, or what appears to be, a facetious battle of polar opposite personalities, actually turns out to be an assimilated and visceral driven road trip across a very diverse American landscape. The rewarding humor that ensues along this road trip as well as the dangers that lurk in unknown territory (Ray Liota)  will entertain and leave audience members guessing at every ramp exit turn, literally.

Jonathan Demme successfully captures the 1980's American landscape flawlessly without ever having one facet dominate the other. Everyone and Everything is treated equally and with ultimate sincerity from the funky east village of Manhattan, to Long Island suburbia , to the rural countryside and all of the nitty gritty details that make up these beautiful landscapes are sewn beautifully and crafted very meticulously. In a childish and enthusiastic way of saying it, ""Everyone is a Winner"" in this little gem.

The Criterion Collection adds a valuable and unique gem to it's prestigious library but unfortunately short changes it's fans with a lackluster set of supplemental material. The 30 minute interview with Jonathan Demme is incredibly delightful and informative to watch. It is wonderful to see a director that is so gratefully proud of his work and all of the blood, sweat and tears that was invested. Without ever explicitly saying it, he implicitly expresses a substantial amount of gratitude for the actors and everyone else who worked on the set. As much as this was a delight to watch, a persistent appetite for more will brew; a documentary, more interviews and a commentary would of sufficed just right, with more emphasis on  a commentary. I especially would of loved to hear Jeff Daniels journey throughout this film. Other than this minor shortfall, the Criterion Collection surpasses one's expectation when it comes to the picture and audio quality department because the film is nothing short of excellent; vibrant and appropriate colors and sounds contribute to the overall theme seamlessly.

As the preceding paragraphs show, this film is a joy to view at every turn. The Criterion Collection has uncovered another treasure and carefully placed it in the vault.",1305417600,,3430,5.223636363636364
668790,5,6303490972,"This is a great film that metamorphoses into several incarnations in the course of 2 hours.  It starts off with Daniels as an uptight guy whose life is subordinate to his career in a piddling investment office (I think).  He does everything he is supposed to do, feels terrible stress and is aware that something is missing from his life.  When he meets the yin to his yang - an unbelievably sexy young Melanie Griffith - he talks about how he locked in bonds at a high interest rate right before the rates fell in the early 1980s.  Griffith is an agent of chaos, a doorway for him to fun and risk that he has not known for years.  The scene where she seduces him is classic:  handcuffed to the bed, she calls his office and hands him the phone before climbing on top of him.  As he fumbles in his pleasure, it is so funny it is sad, a truly great cinema moment.  She even goads him to skip on a restaurant bill, with a meat-cleaver wielding chef chasing him.

After witnessing the light side, the movie suddenly becomes very dark with the appearance of her old boyfriend, Ray Liotta.  He essentially forces her against her will to come with him, setting off a deadly duel with Daniels that is completely believable, a mundane salariman facing a ruthless criminal.  Griffith suddenly appears like a pathetic victim with little control over her life, making her a loser, not a free spirit.  I do not want to reveal the resolution, but it is wonderfully surprising.

Melanie Griffith plays Lulu, a fun-loving lady with a shady past.  She stumbles across Jeff Daniels one day in a diner and is drawn to him through his attempt to leave without paying.  Next thing the two of them are on a wild journey full of funny situations.  However, its not all fun!  There are some genuine scary and tense moments in the film when Lulu's ex-husband turns up.  But these help add spark to the film and make it one of the great films of the 80's.
Something Wild"" is one of those special films that comes along once in awhile.  It's also one of those films you can watch over and over, I just love it!  Along with ""Working Girl"", this is one of Melanie Griffith's shining moments.
DVD SUMMARY:  Let me begin by saying that I was thrilled to obtain this on DVD, after owning a rather poor quality pan/scan video version of it.  The DVD is in widescreen anamorphic, and while the transfer is not exactly clear and pristine, it is accceptable considering its age.  Special features include a trailor.
SOMETHING WILD is a must-own DVD. Grab it before it goes out of print.",1086220800,6,1259,4.497797356828194
668933,5,6303490972,"First, the music in this movie.  Director Jonathan Demme has always put good songs in, but  ""Something Wild"" might be the best example.  Just about every song used reminds me of the good things about inventive creative music from the 80's, while leaving the garbage out.  Thus the ""time capsule"" header, as this is the way I'd like to remember that era.
The movie itself is a wild roller coaster that is somewhat of an updated version of a Hitchcock movie.  The comparison here is based on an everyday guy getting himself drawn deeper and deeper in to a situation, where he not only at times escape is fairly difficult, but he'll eventually have to fight for his life.
But what makes it more intriguing is that when the everyday guy does get a chance to escape, he finds his situation so intriguing that he changes his mind.  He not only spies on the situation he probably should be running away from as fast as he can, but he also confronts it in one of the most ballsy scenes in movie history.  The restaurant scene where he virtually walks in and takes the girl from the nasty bad guy is a cinematic treat.
So is the casting.  Jeff Daniels is perfect as the everyday guy.  It's disappointing to see Melanie Griffith today, because in this movie she absolutely sizzles as the bad girl who gets him into the predicament, but also has a good side that wants to get out of the bad life.  And the screen debut of Ray Liotta is absolutely electrifying as an intelligent violent man, and I'm sure this is what got him the recognition that led to ""Goodfellas"".  I'm amazed that I saw this movie while well into my adult life, and considering that was already sixteen years ago, I'm starting to feel old again.",1043452800,6,1704,4.464516129032258

The picture moves like lightning is uproariously funny but leaves you with the constant feeling that we're gonna get it from this superb cast and Demme doesn't disappoint!  He keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Relax and love it!  Demme got Laurie Anderson and John Cale to do a superb soundtrack as an added bonus.

668936,5,6303490972,"I first saw this movie in the theaters, and I remember sitting spellbound, utterly enthralled by the adept manner in which Jonathan Demme blends comedy, romance, drama, and suspense in a single film. For years, I would catch it whenever I could on cable -- or, if I were hanging with a ""virgin"" friend who had never before seen the film, I'd scrounge up a rental copy (pan-n-scan, of course) at the local video store. All told, I've seen it about a dozen times, twice as many times as I have seen any other movie -- but only once in the widescreen format in which it was originally composed.
When people ask me what my favorite movie is, I tell them without hesitation, ""Something Wild."" Inevitably, a look of comprehension is absent from their face. I briefly explain the plot, describe Melanie Griffith in the black wig, Jeff Daniels as the nebbishy accountant, and Ray Liotta as the Lulu's sinister ex-con (IMHO, career-best performances for all three), and faces begin to light up. Most people have caught at least a part of this film on Comedy Central and recognize it (if only slightly) from those heavily edited screenings, which is a shame because this movie needs to be seen in its unexpurgated form in order to really gain an appreciation of its genius.
So you can imagine my delight when I opened a birthday gift from my girlfriend and found inside a copy of ""Something Wild"" on DVD. If I were capable of squealing, I would have. You see, I was under the impression that this was one of those ""lost titles"" that would never be released on DVD.  Yet there it was, in my hands, a true cinematic masterpiece, one of the best films of the 80s, my favorite movie. Sigh. What a great birthday present!
Now that I have recovered from the initial giddiness of actually owning the flick and watched it once or twice, I can report objectively that the DVD release isn't perfect. The transfer is average (but nevertheless widescreen -- yay!), with a slightly washed-out look that minimizes some of the impact of the garish 80s couture. And the disk is pretty straightforward. You can select from 16 scenes, watch in the original English or dubbed Spanish, watch with French or Spanish subtitles, and view an irrelevant theatrical trailer. Or, you can just live with the fact that this great film is finally available on DVD and watch it start to finish, over and over again.",1011312000,19,2374,4.6389548693586695
668937,5,6303490972,"Jeff Daniels ISN'T sorry when his Charlie character, an uptight accountant who is recently divorced, meets Lulu (Melanie Griffith).

Lulu spots Charlie in a diner after he skips out on his bill, and she decides he needs a little excitement, her brand.  She requests a ride, and kidnaps Charlie for ""Something Wild.""

This movie begins as a non-stop fun odyssey of roadtripping, hotel sex, light bondage, stolen meals and liquor.  All this culminates at destination Lulu's moms house in Pennsylvania.  After meeting Lulu's mom as her new husband, (which mom's not buying for a second), Charlie also meets Audrey for the first time, the REAL Lulu under the black wig.  Suddenly the strange creature he met in the diner,  has transformed for her highschool reunion, into something MILD!

The most unusual and unexpected thing about this movie is how it makes a complete 180 degree turn from its earlier wacky farce theme.  This happens at the point when Audrey and Charlie attend Audrey's class reunion as ""Husband and Wife.""  A few people know it's a hoax.  Charlie unexpectedly meets a co-worker who gives him the old ""wink wink, nudge nudge"" over his affair, while his pregnant wife views Audrey with disdain. While sharing drinks and a romantic dance at the party, trouble in Charlie and Audrey's paradise begins when Audrey is spotted by not so ""ex""-husband and very ex-""con"" Ray, menacingly played by Ray Liotta in a great screen debut.  It is then, that the party is truly OVER.

Once Ray convinces Charlie and Audrey to get a few beers with him, the film turns from a lighthearted romp, into a tense edge of your seat ride until the close.

This is classic Johnathan Demme, before he got all serious with later works, such as ""Silence of The Lambs.""  Like his subsequent classic mafia comedy, ""Married To The Mob,"" this is quirky and exciting filmaking at it's finest.  Again, Demme also uses all his favorite character actors like Charles Napier, there are cameos from ""Polyester"" director John Waters, Tracey Walter and other familiar Demme faces too.

This is a film that is appropriately named, and therefore, if you're looking for a little something out of the ordinary, I think you'll go WILD for this film, I did!",1008720000,,2225,4.859416445623342
668938,5,6303490972,"Something Wild is one of my all-time favorite films. It title is perfect--a wild, exhilirating ride from start to finish (with a great soundtrack to boot). Melanie Griffith and Jeff Daniels have a crackling chemistry, and it is showcases the two actors doing their very finest work. Ray Liotta was an unknown when cast for this film, and his performance is unbelievably scary (though nominated for a Golden Globe for the role, he should have won an Oscar--you will never forget his role, I promise you). If you're tired of the same old formulaic... at  the movies and on video, you simply  must buy it--it's a true original and a great film.",997833600,,641,4.714285714285714

7849230,5,6303490972,"Was rehashing the movie last night. This has to be one of the best underrated movies of 1986. The plot starts out simple, Charlie who is played by Jeff Daniels accidentally forgets to pay for his lunch in a small diner in New York. Lulu, who is played by Melanie Griffith calls him out on it. She says she'll take him back to work as a kind gesture. The meat of the movie really takes off after the two of them leave the motel the next morning.
All the acting is spot on and Ray Liotta couldn't be better than the ex-husband in a role that he's used to. It's a great movie if you can get passed the scene where Lulu seduces Charlie in the bedroom. I stumbled across this movie about a year and a half ago on eBay and it serves as one of those 'after hour' movies you might be interested in watching in the wee hours of the morning. I don't like writing spoilers, but the movie does sort of leave the audience hanging, and wishing that Charlie and Lulu would tie the knot.",1520640000,,971,4.142857142857143
7849231,4,6303490972,"This film is a terrific character study with an ingenious narrative.  Charlie (Jeff Daniels) is an uptight Wall Street executive rebounding from a recent divorce looking for a little excitement in his life.  For his sins Lulu (Melanie Griffith) comes along.  Besides an afternoon of kinky sex at a seedy motel Lulu proves to be more than Charlie was bargaining for.  Unknown to Charlie he represents to Lulu the normalcy she's been missing since her childhood.  Before that can be attained Lulu has to dispatch her parolee husband, the volcanic Ray (Ray Liotta).  I really admire this film a lot but there's a disjointed quality to it.  The first half has a kind of skewed screwball quality to it.  The second half, however, has a certain unpleasantness of tone that is unrelenting.  Liotta represents the unsavory aspect of ""Something Wild"".  Not only is Liotta terrific he's mesmerizing probably the best I've ever seen him.  It just goes on too long.  Regardless, Daniels and Griffith have probably also never been better slowly shedding sides of their respective characters personas revealing their true natures.  Director Jonathan Demme invests the film with color incorporating an appropriate world and new wave music score that only accentuates the quirky atmospherics.  This is a film that I wish was wholly successful instead of mostly so.",1516492800,,1348,5.095890410958904
