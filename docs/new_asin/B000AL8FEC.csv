Having written about this sad state for years, it's now to the point where I merely shrug at the loss for cinema fans.

This is another of those forgotten productions.

Based on the real-life story of Countess Maria von Maltzan and writer Hans Hirschel; tells the incredible tale of a Jew who lived in the heart of Nazi Germany for the entirety of the war. (see Wikipedia)

When one thinks about a true police state - and not the hyperbole-filled nonsense uttered so casually by far too many fools - it seems impossible. Yet it did happen.

Fritz Friedlnder and Countess Nina von Halder have fallen in love. Unfortunately, it's 1938 in Germany and falling in love for a Jew and Catholic was beyond just illegal - during the monstrosity of terror known as The Third Reich - it was considered an abomination.

Already legally hounded and expunged from society - businesses taken away, livelihoods destroyed, personal property confiscated, and except what they could carry - victims were given the jackboot to anywhere in the world that would accept them. Still, despite the horrors being poured on these people, many Jews still felt 'German' and they weren't giving up their homeland for any reason. State sanctioned monsters like Himmler and Heydrich realized that their so-called mission was not going as projected - so a new idea was being formulated.

Figuratively and literally - the writing was on the wall - Death was coming.

Three years before&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-malignant-1941-Wannsee-Conference/dp/B00KG2QO2K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the malignant 1941 Wannsee Conference</a>, the couple realized that intolerance was warping into something terrifying. So, together with Fritz's loving mother, they hatched a plan. One that seemed simple on the surface, but was layered with many levels of danger.

Their idea was based on the German need and love for accurate bookkeeping.

Fritz would commit suicide.

During this dark period, like all Nazi state functionaries, police officers didn't give a crap whether there was one less Jew. In fact, they preferred it since it was one less problem. One more Jewish mother's tearful request to be ignored. One more report to file. And as far as the bureaucracy was concerned: One Fritz Friedlnder was dead --- good riddance.

But hidden within the home of his lover - he lived on.

As the years passed, the world became much more scary, so much more insane, and so much more sick. And soon after the Wannsee Conference - it became a world beyond anything anyone could have imagined in their worst of nightmares.

And still there were many Jews who refused to leave. This tiny remaining population that numbered only several thousand, were being systematically identified, categorized, torn out of their homes, and herded to The Trains.

But the Nazi Internal Security apparatus, Gestapo, weren't stupid. They knew there had to be secret hold-outs. And they used every twisted trick in the book to lure out the remainder. Baits using family already on their way to the crematoriums, threats against German friends, traps around Jewish gathering places, and ultimately - spies - poor captured souls who were trained to snare their own in order to live another day.

Everything to insure The Final Solution.

Overall, an excellent dramatization. Production values were period correct and the sets felt appropriate - a shared platform that produced a bizarre dichotomy of warm home and cold prison. Stars Jurgen Prochnow and Jacqueline Bisset made a very believable couple, which really gave the movie a tangible reality.",1423440000,,3672,5.217687074829932
8078730,5,B000AL8FEC,"I couldn't find this movie anywhere and was thrilled to find it here! based on a true story, this is one of the very best films ever made about WWII. it's the less known drama - not the concentration camps, ghettos, partisans or heroic frontiers. just two ""Berliners"", caught in the middle of a storm, and doing what we would wish anyone to do, against all odds. watch it if you can find it.",1306713600,3,391,4.297297297297297
8078731,4,B000AL8FEC,"Purportedly based on a true story (""the Last Jew in Berlin')of a German Jewish man and his aristocratic Aryan lover during WWII.  Excellently acted, mature script, gripping tale of quiet heroism and eventual triumph over the evil of the Nazi era.",1236556800,3,246,5.0
8078732,4,B000AL8FEC,"This is quite a good video about wartime Berlin. Countess Nina and Jewish Fritz fall in love, and when the Nazis start to send Jews to the concentration camps, Nina decides to hide Fritz in her flat.
Countess Nina von Halder also joins the resistance and works hard to save Jews from the clutches of the Gestapo. She co-operates with the Swedish church in Berlin, and the Swedish priest gives her jobs to do.
I found the film exciting, informative and romantic.
If you want to learn more, read Leonard Gross's book 'The Last Jews in Berlin'. It's a very well written book. In this book you will learn that Nina and Fritz's real names were Countess Maria von Maltzan and Hans Hirschel. The real story is just as captivating, and mostly 'Forbidden' follows the real story. Just some few details are different, like for instance Maria and Hans didn't take in one little girl, but two Russian girls. Maria was quite insecure about if she should take in the two sisters: If she didn't take them in, the two girls may be killed. But then, if she and Hans did let them stay in their home, they risked that the children may tell about Hans or any other Jew staying in their flat. Maria and Hans decided that the girls should live with them, and in the end the eldest sister saved Maria and Hans..
I recommend that you watch the video and read the book",1143072000,12,1343,4.441295546558704
8078733,5,B000AL8FEC,"WWII has begun.  For the vast majority of German citizens, Hitler is their hero, but independent Countess Nina Von Halder (Jacqueline Bisset) refuses to become one of his hatemongering disciples.  Courageously, she joins the gentile underground in a desperate attempt to save the lives of Berlin's remaining Jews.

Then Nina falls in love and has a forbidden affair with Fritz ('Das Boot's Jurgen Prochnow), a handsome Jewish writer who's in grave danger of being sent to a concentration camp.  When Fritz's aristocratic mother (Irene Worth) is picked up by the Gestapo, Nina takes the ultimate risk and hides her passionate lover in her apartment.

Through the fire, blood and destruction of the war, Nina and Fritz struggle to survive against overwhelming odds, but sometimes they need more than their love to get through the horror that was Nazi Germany.

Based on a true story, and actually filmed in Berlin, Forbidden's sumptuous production values and hypnotic score by Tangerine Dream make for a first-class motion picture experience of the highest degree.
