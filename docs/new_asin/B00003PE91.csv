1332271,3,B00003PE91,"TWO GANG BANGERS [MACK 10 & FAT JOE] ARE IN RIVAL GANGS. BUT, THEY SOON BECOME BEST FRIENDS. DEFINITELY BETTER THAN MOST OF THE OTHER RECENTLY RELEASED GANGSTA MOVIES. FEATURES A LOT OF RAPPERS, SUCH AS; ICE CUBE, MC EIHT, B-REAL, CJ MAC, BAD AZZ, K MAC FROM THE COMRADZ, AND MANY MORE. IT HAS SOME PRETTY GOOD ACTION SCENES. IT WAS AN ALRIGHT MOVIE, DESPITE THE FACT THAT A LOT OF THESE RAPPERS CAN'T ACT. A PRETTY WORTHY ATTEMPT.",1071705600,3,431,4.4
1332272,5,B00003PE91,This is my all time favorite movie. It has so many surprises. The things that happen are just too funny and at times too sad. I can't explain just how much I recommend this movie. It keeps your eyes glued to the screen. There is profanity but it is needed to set the scene. It is captivating. Watch it an you will agree.,1021248000,,320,4.095238095238095
1332273,1,B00003PE91,"I Fell in love with this movie after seeing it on HBO. I then bought it. The dvd looks and sounds terrible. The Pan and Scan (no wide-screen) seems to have only cropped the sides and kept  the center leaving conversations where you only see one person. The colors are washed out and look worse than a good VHS. The 5.1 plan is mix everything loud in every speaker all the time. I didn't expect a Fight Club, just a clean version of the movie  the way it was intended to be viewed.",987379200,2,480,4.150537634408602
