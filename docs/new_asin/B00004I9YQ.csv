7920442,4,B00004I9YQ,This dance lesson is great and is a 5 star to me.  I rated this 4 star because the VHS tape is defective.  Get the DVD version and it is worth your money in terms of the lessons taught and the video quality.,1359158400,,207,3.7906976744186047
7920443,4,B00004I9YQ,"Very good video. It shows very nice moves and they are very well explained. This video fit exactly my level of dancing. One draw back is the quality of the video I've received, however, it may not be the same for all, but there is a buzzing noise in the background which won't go away. Ohter than that, I recommend this video for the beginner/intermediate level.",1170720000,,362,4.5
7920444,5,B00004I9YQ,"If all dance videos were produced this well, there would have to be at least 10 times as many places to dance in the world in order to accomodate all of the dedicated dancers. The instruction, dancing, tips, photography, audio, and sequencing of steps (which step is taught first, second, etc.) are all absolutely impecable. In fact, Peta's tips for using the video (given at the beginning) can be applied to learing from any dance video and to learning how to dance in general - from any source.

And the dancers are just plain fun to watch too. The music that accompanies Josie and Peta during some of the dancing, when the step isn't being broken down in easily understood chunks, is very appealing. Also the music varies a bit so you don't have to listen to the same segment of music over and over as the steps progress.

What's missing is also a plus. There's no self-conscious joking between the instructors. There's a minimum of time between segments. The backdrop to the dancing is attractive yet minimal. The focus is on giving the highest value, minute by minute, to the viewer.

Even watching without a partner, I'm able to quickly learn and retain a few cha cha patterns at a time before going to a dance. (I'm an intermediate level social ballroom dancer.)

First the step is shown, with both Josie and Peta dancing together, at a moderate pace with counting and no music. Then Peta demonstrates the man's part once while he instructs. Then Josie demonstrates the woman's part once while she instructs. Then they dance the step together to music at a normal tempo (in other words, up to speed) a couple of times.

Very well paced. I've never seen any dance video produced this well before. I'm eventually going to buy all of the Josie Neglia DVDs I can find. I'm so glad Josie and Peta made this wonderful instruction product. I'm happy to to have such sensuous and creative teachers to emulate. You will be too.",1141776000,,1925,4.633431085043989
7920445,4,B00004I9YQ,"It is a good video because it contains twenty variations, it is well explained and both Peta and Josie are very good dancers. However, the variations are shown as starting on two and I find more natural to start on one. Besides, their waist movement does not look as natural as a latin street dancer.

7920446,5,B00004I9YQ,"I've had very little luck finding cha-cha dance video's, and most of them show the same basic steps over and over.  This video is the exception, I'd rate this as Josie's best video in terms of production and content.  The routines are well thought out and explained.  The style of cha-cha shown is the same one I learned and see practice in clubs here in Texas, so no complaints there.  Overall this video packs a huge bang for the buck.  70 minutes with the mans, then woman's part explained.",1013472000,9,493,4.49438202247191
7920447,3,B00004I9YQ,"Josie Neglia calls the steps in this video her version of nightclub cha cha. To me the steps in this video look like Latin American Ballroom Cha cha. There is nothing wrong with this I am just trying to explain the style  as opposited  to a street style Cha cha cha. This is a good length video 70  minutes. I enjoyed the clips at the end of the mistakes they made making  this video. Lots of Salsa teachers have been trying to make videos in the  last couple of years, most do not because it is so hard. They show each  step three ways. (1) They count the beat (2) They explain the man's &  women's parts separately.  (3) They dance the step to music. There are 20  steps explained. This is more than you need for social nightclub dancing.",960940800,16,740,4.228571428571429
