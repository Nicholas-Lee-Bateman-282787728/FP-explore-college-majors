5000876,5,B006L4ZEDW,"A film by Peter Jackson and Steven Spielberg, story by Steven Moffat, Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish and starring Jamie Bell, Andy Serkis, Daniel Craig and Pegg & Frost. Sounds good, doesn't it? But 'ware! The subject is one of the most cherished icons of 20th century child's story-telling, held dear by pretty much anyone of a ""certain age"" and transferred from a distinctive style to modern CGI animation. The potential to fail is strong in this one...

Briefly, the story is a mash-up of three well known episodes in the Tintin canon, The Crab with the Golden Claws, The Secret of the Unicorn, and Red Rackham's Treasure. Tintin (Bell) meets Captain Haddock (Serkis) and embark on an action packed search for the Captain's ancestor's treasure trove. They are joined by two of the more fondly remembered of Tintin's associates, Thompson and Thomson played by Pegg and Frost, (or is it Frost and Pegg?) and stalked by arch criminal Ivan Sakharine (Craig).

The film is produced using performance capture animation and it bridges the gap between a live action film and the straight ""cartoon"" of the Bernasconi animated series. Obviously Tintin purists will have their objections as the film does take *some* liberties with the ""look"", but to the ordinary audience member, the end product is both impressive and reverential to Herge. If there are any objections to the CGI animation (and there are a few minor ones) I think it's important to remember that the art and technology of CGI is still developing and it would be churlish to criticise too strongly. One criticism I have heard is that the emotional expression of the characters suffers in the CGI process. I'll have none of that! The characters' faces are expressive and readable and it is quite easy eventually to forget that they *are* CGI and my wife came out of the cinema remarking that the make-up was very good and she didn't recognise Andy Serkis at all!

Most importantly, the animation really does keep the faith with Herge's vision (Herge even appears in a small cameo in the opening sequence) in almost every way. The characters are depicted as 3D versions of his original ligne claire artwork (without the lignes) and it's a big relief that the story is set in the 1940's Tintin universe, ""somewhere in Europe"", plus-fours, bowler hats, rusty tramp-steamers, schmeisser machine guns and sea-planes galore. The film really retains the film noir ""feel"" of the original and that will be important to Tintin's fans. The ""scenery"" is, like Herge's comics, sumptuously populated and I was crying out for a remote control to pause and rewind the film so that I could revisit some of the little details that I half-missed - the covers of magazines carelessly tossed onto desktops, the contents of the desk's partly opened drawers, little cameo sequences that take place at the edge of the screen while the main action is front and centre, the array of faces in The Milanese Nightingale's audience and so-on. The film has *huge* rewatch potential and I will be pre-ordering the DVD as soon as it becomes available for this reason alone!

The acting is brilliant and all the performers really bring their characters to life. Bell does a fine job and Serkis and Pegg and Frost convey their slapstick antics extremely well. It's good that the actors' performances don't overwhelm the characters' already well-developed personalities. While I've heard some criticism that Serkis overcooks his Haddock, I disagree - the Captain is a larger-than-life personality and Serkis does a fine job with this wonderful character. I am aching, however, to meet Professor Calculus in a sequel (please let it be Destination Moon)!

Ol' Steve has been around a while, now and knows a thing or too about the action/adventure genre and he really lets rip with this one. Indiana Jones for kids? I'll say. The action is breath-taking and at nearly two hours in length it's a rollercoaster ride. The motorcycle chase scene, filmed in a single continuous take is the centrepiece of the film. Spielberg bundles you into the sidecar and takes you on a break-neck race, bouncing you off the walls, leaping chasms and leaving you, several minutes later, sitting in a small cloud of dust with steam coming off the seat of your pants and little cork-screws of sweat radiating off your head. The ""Long Take"" scene is becoming a bit of a cliche in modern cinematography and, I think, looks a little ostentatious in live action film, but in animation it works rather well and left me exhausted and deeply satisfied. And it doesn't let up - in true Spielberg/Indy style, the film barely slows down for a minute. There's plenty of good, Herge slapstick, not too overdone and obeying the hallowed traditions of visual comedy, and genuine laugh out loud moments aplenty.

In the final analysis, The Adventures of Tintin is a top notch family film. It will, like any film of this sort, have its detractors; but what Jackson and Spielberg have achieved is a joyful, exuberant whoop of a film that will appeal to kids of all ages (i.e. anywhere between about 5 and 85) and will offend none but the hardest of Tintin die-hards.

Did we enjoy it? Ten thousand thudering typhoons! Of course we did!

5000877,4,B006L4ZEDW,"For those brought up on these characters, this film succeeds in bringing the viewer into their world:  small town France, with the plucky reporter and his faithful dog, who get into wild adventures in the big world outside with Captain Haddock, the alcoholic who perpetually falls off the wagon.  The film follows The Secret of the Unicorn closely, but makes a number of small plot changes - I mention this because aficionados of the books will have memorized every single scene.  The changes do not detract from the story.

The characterizations are pretty good, though Tintin's face is often curiously devoid of emotion.  As the adventure moves quickly, the viewer can forget about Tintin's lack of character, but it was an occasional annoyance.  Haddock is much better:  the film definitely captures his essential mix of buffoonery, courage, and purity of spirit; he is very funny, always the more delightful character than the ernest and wholesome Tintin, so perhaps that is why he has more life to him.  The other characters are also more vividly drawn than Tintin, from Thompson and Thompson to the many bad guys like Red Rackam.  For the most part, the animation, atmosphere, and action are spectacular, so clear as to be indistinguishable from film.

My kids enjoyed this as much as I did.  We saw it in French, its original language, so I cannot comment on voice characterizations for an American audience.  Warmly recommended as good fun.  We will definitely buy it when the price is right.",1321747200,2,1500,4.9282868525896415
5000878,4,B006L4ZEDW,"MOVIE NOTE #7: THE ADVENTURES OF TINTIN. What a really well done photo-realistic, motion capture animated film That I saw tonight at a Pre-Screening at Paramount Pictures tonight in Hollywood. This film will not be relased until Dec 21, 20011 - but I was quite surprised as it was directed by Steven Spielberg himself. His FIRST animated feature as the director (and producer).

Along with co-producer Peter Jackson (Lord of the Rings, Kink Kong) and written by Stephen Moffet (Doctor Who, Sherlock), this film stars the voice talents of Andy Serkis (Lord of the Rings, 13 Going on 30, King Kong (2008), Rise of the Planet of the Apes) as the extremely inebriated Captain Haddock who inadvertantly is guided on a massive treasure hunt invlving a sunken ship of his ancestry by the young reporter Tintin - voiced by Jamie Bell (Jane Eyrie, Jumper, Defiance). Accompaied by the most inteligent and funniest sidekick I've seen since Snoopy himself - a faithful fox terrier named Snowy, everyone in this film needs to stay one step ahead of the evil villian who is artfully voiced by the talents Daniel Craig (007, Cowboys and Aliens, Defiance).

Overall the movie started a little slow for me, but toward the middle it becomes a romp of fun, comedy and adventure - with quick cuts, many near misses and a whirlwind of physical hapenstnaces that only a true animated hero could survive. Accompanied by a brilliant score who was composed by Spielberg's long time parnter, John Williams (Star Wars, Jaw, Schindler's List, E.T. Close Encounters, Saving Private Ryan) - which may have sounded a little too much like the Indiana Jones themes for me (but that is what this movie is - an animated Indiana Jones) - this movie is definately family fun for all. Keep an eye out for his one in December!",1321747200,3,1788,4.8019480519480515
5000879,3,B006L4ZEDW,"Steven Speilberg's very association with a movie is reason enough for one to watch it. The man never ceases to surprise and enthrall. I watched this movie at PVR today - the cramped up seats notwithstanding the movie is a masterpiece of technological brilliance, moreso for someone who has recently suffered Ra. One. The quality of animation is painstakingly meticulous, the characterisation endearing BUT, (yes, there is a BUT even in this movie) there is something amiss. Something which is the difference between good and classic. I think it is the scale of the climax, which perhaps fails to create the denouement that the movie deserved and was expected of Speilberg. Even so, it is a movie worth watching. Rating 3.5/5",1320883200,8,724,4.991735537190083
5000880,5,B006L4ZEDW,"Spielberg bought the rights of the adventures of Tintin, at least those starting with this episode when Captain Haddock comes into the picture. So we will have one film every Yule season, at least, if the actors survive the series or do not age too fast, though the digital processing of them enables them to age unseen in their digital skins.

The choice of technology and actors is perfect for those roles that are so well known that they do not admit any kind of mistake. The Dupont-ds are supposed to be perfect, and what's more perfectly dumb and inefficient, which they are. The very antagonistic representation of the Belgian policeman or inspector seen as Hercule Poirot for example. I must say the dog, Milou, is less convincing in that processing. He is processed slightly too much and smells as if he were just out of the dog's beauty parlor. The Castafiore is a marvelous superb operatic monster and she is truer than she could be in real reality.

The story is an old pirate story and Captain Haddock is an ignominious drunkard but he is fabulous in the desert and when he is reliving the adventures of his ancestor. At that level the film is quite a success for those who like pirate films and sea fights with sail ships, fire, canon powder, sabers and swords, etc. The falcon is also a good chap who fulfils his part quite well.

What Spielberg managed with great success is the great variety of landscapes, seascapes and other locations that is extremely important in this comic strip that leads the readers from the popular suburban areas of Brussels to the Sahara desert, the French foreign legion, the Atlantic by boat and the Atlantic by hydroplane, the unstable setting of a ship or a flying plane, as well as the disturbed stable setting of a city of a harbor. The duel with harbor cranes is quite a good idea indeed and spectacular.

Those of you who have known Tintin when you were the same age as the comic books will find it realistically done. Those who are from a younger generation will like the action and the special effects, and of course the chase for the treasure. You will only get the first leg of it right now, but next year, it is a promise, you get the second leg. After that If I believe the images of the opening credits you are going to get  the moon, Tournesol and quite a few more of these adventures. I saw an allusion to Tibet too which is an earlier period, hence surprising. Have a good voyage in comic land.

5000881,5,B006L4ZEDW,"I grew up reading Tintin. Tintin was created by a Herge (his pen-name) in 1929. It is the most widely published cartoon series in the world, having sold over 200 million copies. Tintin is the protagonist of the series, a reporter and adventurer who travels around the world with his dog Snowy. Throughout much of the series, Tintin's attitude is characterised by inquisitive tendencies and a noble, forgiving nature. I can't wait for the Bluray to come out! I hope that Spielberg has created a magical animation.",1319587200,,512,4.896551724137931
5000882,1,B006L4ZEDW,"We who have grown up on the thoughtful Tintin of Herge's books, the skinny kid with a big heart and a sharp mind, have a new thing coming. Brace yourselves for Tintin's older brother.  This guy is no longer a boy, but strangely not a man either. He seems more like a machine's idea of what an older adolescent should look like, and we end up being treated to the antics of a latex-skinned castrato in his early twenties, pumped up with steroids and, to judge by his hyperactivity, snorting cocaine nonstop just out of our sight.

Visually the movie is opulent, of course, but it feeds the eye while starving the mind and the heart. The artificial faces are devoid of subtlety and humanity - even the dog has been cleaned up and ""Disneyfied"" - no scruffy Snowy here. The constant, vivid, over-the-top roller coaster of activity and imagery will quickly grow tiresome to the grownups and will be gratuitously over-stimulating for children. Is such an overdose of action what it takes to retain the attention of a generation raised on cut-a-second TV programming and video games?

It strikes me that this is not what we need for our own children if we want to raise them with quiet, clear, settled, inquisitive minds.",1319328000,25,1214,4.663551401869159

5000899,5,B006L4ZEDW,"I had a cousin that was big on the Tintin (taen-taen) comics.  I only ever breezed through his collection, never really indulging in any of them (I think they were mostly written in French anyway).  So, when heard that a movie was coming out I was somewhat already in the know, and when I finally saw the movie I was pretty thrilled by it.

The CGI actually adds a layer of texture to the film that I think was much needed for a cinematic presentation.  If I had shot it I would not have had the presence of mind like Spielberg to actually enhance the visuals of both environment and the characters, which means my production would have looked pretty plain.  But, I never did follow through with my film career, and so we get cinematic masters like Spielberg who really and thoroughly vetted the Tintin stories for all their worth to bring us this film.

To me this is pure adventure.  It's what I write.  It's what I know.  It's what I like.  And so it is that I like this film and all of the plot intrigue that it presents.

For a comic book translated to motion picture media, it's difficult for me to say whether this is really over the top or not.  Again, it's adventure, it's Hollywood, it's Spielberg, it's post 1990s film making from a man who made his name in the 80s, so it's got that real splashy action quality to it.

The bluray certainly looks better than what I saw in the theater, and that's about all I can say about it.

( I know it started off as a comic but I didn't have access to that type of media) I love the 3d animation effects and the story line! The characters and background were beautifully designed and the plot is intriguing and easy to follow. I'm glad that the character designers let the characters stick to their original personalities and not change them. The voice acting for each character is great and it's always funny to hear Captain Haddock curse like a drunken sailor ""Ten Thundering Typhoons!""

5001043,4,B006L4ZEDW,"I had a few doubts about this movie at first: why, I wondered, wasn't it done in regular live-action, like Marvel adaptations (which, of course, are also graphically sourced)?  But having seen it, I understand why Spielberg et al. made that choice: there are quite a few things they could do in CGI animation that simply wouldn't have been possible any other way.  It's not surprising that Spielberg would have chosen to adapt Herge's beloved character, who has more than a hint of Indiana Jones about him--or that he'd have hired John Williams to provide the score.

Sometime in the '30's, the very young but well-known journalist Tintin (Jamie Bell) is browsing through a street market when he sees a gorgeous model of a 17th-Century ship and knows at once that he has to have it.  No sooner has he concluded the deal than two people try to buy it from him--and when he doesn't sell, one of them is shot on his doorstep and the ship vanishes from his apartment.  He soon discovers that there are in fact three of the models: his own, one that's been acquired by the sinister Sakharine (Daniel Craig), and one that's up for grabs.  And he also discovers that each of them contains a piece of parchment that furnishes part of the directions to the location of the lost treasure of the Haddock family, whose ancestor Sir Francis was the captain of the original ship.  Assisted by Interpol agents Thompson and Thomson (Nick Frost, Simon Pegg) and by the very last of the Haddocks, the hard-drinking Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis), Tintin and his faithful terrier Snowy set out on a grueling voyage by sea and land to track down the third model before Sakharine can get his hands on it--and discover exactly what the secret is that ""only a true Haddock"" can unravel.  Plenty of action and a lively score are among the high points, and the final scene leaves room for a sequel.",1452470400,,1872,4.634441087613293

5001065,1,B006L4ZEDW,"My worst fears came true: Spielberg and Jackson managed to ruin three perfect Tintin adventures in order to milk out a boring animated remake of Raiders of the Lost Ark.

I grew up on Tintin albums, and it's quite obvious neither of them got it. Tintin is much more than dodging cars or ducking bullets. It has fun, researched context, self-parody, witty dialogue, great characters, wonderful stories, and even pathos. This movie here is mere slam-bang, non-stop action with not much else to substain it (the finale with the fighting cranes is so banal I didn't know whether to get a headache or fall asleep). And last but not least, the half-real, half-drawn characters are TRULY a bad idea.  Not only are they portrayed all horribly wrong, but given the beauty of Herg's draughtsmanship, wouldn't have been great to see a true  3D Tintin drawn in Herg's famed crisp-clear style?

In a nutshell: The movie is so bad, I don't think there'll  be a sequel. If there is, please stick to the original material. Why mess with pefection.",1443484800,9,1031,4.769662921348314

5001086,5,B006L4ZEDW,"Entertaining Story, Wonderfully Presented.  I would have completely overlooked this film if it had not appeared among Peter Jackson's credits.  Then I saw that Steven Spielberg directed it, and a little cartoon began to pique my interest.  Animation and effects by Weta Digital.  Starring Jaimie Bell, the actor who played the endearing Billy Elliott in Peter Jackson's 2005 production of King Kong.  And then, oh my!  Then there was the indisputable master of performance capture, Andy Serkis (Gollum, King Kong, Caesar in the Planet of the Apes films) as Captain Haddock.  Those credits were more than enough to lead me to buy the Blu-Ray, and I am very happy that did!

Spielberg and Jackson takes us on a classically Spielbergian adventure romp around the world, with a set of likable and entertaining characters faithfully imported directly from the ""Tintin"" books by Belgian cartoonist Herg.  (The original stories are in French, and Tintin's name sounds better; pronounced something like ""dan-DAA"" with the short 'a' vowel being forced out through your nose.)  When I saw examples of the original work, I finally made the connection between the movie character and the characters of Tintin and Snowy that I remember from my youth.  Here we see them brought to life in full 3D, with facial expressions that use every muscle in the human face and realistic skin and sweat and hair, to the point that you just no longer see the visual effects and watch the characters; but nevertheless represented in a cartoonish style very faithful in both appearance and movement to Herg's original art.

In an earlier review, someone asked whether is was live action or animation.  In this case, the answer is yes; both.  It's performance capture.  All the humans on screen were acted out by live actors wearing motion-capture rigs, and then those motions, including facial expressions, are integrated into a fully digitally generated world by Weta Digital.  The dog, Snowy, was more classical keyframe animation; he was represented in the live performances by static models that showed his location and gave the human actors something to interact with.  And the result was wonderful.

It might be interesting to see where Steven Spielberg goes next.  He learned from this experience how to do performance capture and what it will do, adding a powerful new tool to an outstanding director's tool kit.",1434585600,,2391,5.069053708439898

5001089,5,B006L4ZEDW,"This movie is based largely but not wholly on The Secret Of The Unicorn.  The difficulty with adapting books/comics to film is that the nature of the business is such that a literal adaptation can't always be done.  What one hopes for is something that keeps the spirit, the flavour of the books.  Some criticize this for incorporating elements from several Tintin books, to which I say, so what?  Sometimes a literal adaptation is completely off, sometimes all the elements are there but the whole is less than the sum of its parts. Fortunately for viewers, The Adventures of Tintin while not following the book exactly maintains the spirit, the flavour of the books.

5001113,3,B006L4ZEDW,"The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn is an animated film of the super-modern variety made by Peter Jackson and Steven Spielberg, of all people. It's based on Franco-Belgian cartoonist Herg's popular comic albums featuring the boyish but brave reporter Tintin, his half-mad and frequently drunken companion Captain Haddock, the incompetent detectives Thomson & Thompson, and (of course) Tintin's dog Snowy.

I read the comic album version of The Secret of the Unicorn as a child. The plot of the film was just as I remembered itwhich means Jackson and Spielberg successfully tricked me, since the film version is really based on three different Tintin albums. Apart from The Secret of the Unicorn, plot elements from The Crab with the Golden Claws and Red Rackham's Treasure have been incorporated into the storyline. No hard feelings, though!

Since we're talking Hollywood, the action element of the original stories is heavily emphasized, while the crazy element is somewhat less pronounced. It's still there, though. The Thompson Twins are incredibly dim-witted as usual, the opera singer Bianca Castafiore is forever the diva (actually calling a sultan a peasant), and little Snowy (the dog, remember?) has more lives than your neighbor's cat. As for Captain Haddock's Scottish accent, I always pictured him that way! Great Scott, of course a crazy English sailor is really Scottish However, it seems his colorful insults have been kept down to a minimum.

To be honest, the constant chases and fights of Jackson-Spielberg's remake bored me after a while, so I'm only giving The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn three stars. Yet, I suspect the really hardcore Tintin lovers (the kind of guys who continued reading the comic even as adults) will fancy this as a valuable addition to their blistering barnacles, ha ha",1428192000,,1849,5.156666666666666

5001180,4,B006L4ZEDW,"This animated adventure is both produced and directed by Steven Spielberg in his first animated effort, it is in most ways a satisfying watch with some excellent animation, a good voice cast and an exciting storyline

I have quite a few of the Tintin books and enjoyed the exploits brought to life by the Belgian cartoonist Herg (Georges Prosper Remi)

The film take inspiration from a number of books and mixes in some bits of it's own, The Crab with the Golden Claws and The Secret of the Unicorn are the two main plot lines. Cast do a decent job including Jamie Bell as Tintin, Daniel Craig who voices Ivan Ivanovitch Sakharine and Red Rackham, Nick Frost and Simon Pegg provide the well known detectives Thomson and Thompson, no complaints about the voice acting

The story starts with Tintin and Snowy (his longstanding dog companion) at a market where they buy a model ship ""The Unicorn"", taking the ship back home it's broken by accident revealing a scroll inside it which is the basis for most of the film story, the attempts by others to steal the scroll and the hidden secrets it contains. It turns out there are other scrolls and when combined will reveal the location of the real Unicorn ship and the treasure it contains.

A fairly simple plot, very much in the style of adventure films both animated or not. The quality of animation is excellent throughout clearly a lot of effort has been put into the production. The film is quite fast paced, and at times a little too much with very little time to ponder or relax (many films get criticised for being too drawn out or slow Tintin probably goes a bit too far the other direction) The ending leaves the door (somewhat predictably open) for other sequels which is a little disappointing that during the 1 hour 47 minutes the story isn't concluded. Plenty of material to work with for future Tintin adventures I'd have liked to see this one wrap up at the end. Still leaving the slightly super fast pace/action (in a few cases a little overboard and going beyond reality a bit too much) this is an enjoyable film which is a slick production with great visuals, and a genuinely fun adventure/storyline.",1416528000,,2164,4.642297650130549

5001215,2,B006L4ZEDW,"I'm afraid I didn't think much of this movie.  It's not the worst thing I've ever seen, but it has many, many flaws.

Most of the characters in this movie are stereotypes, and they are drawn that way.  On the other hand TinTin himself is drawn with greater accuracy, landing him right in the middle of the uncanny valley.  That makes him a very uncomfortable character to watch.  He's always thinking out loud things that the audience knew long before he said them.  The voice acting is also poor for many of the characters.

The movie is filled to the brim with cliches.  The bumbling indistinguishable police officers, the boy who is simultaneously unreasonably smart and shockingly dim witted, the pirate-talking alcoholic seaman, the stuffy butler who knows the answer all along but no one asks him, the animals that are smarter than people and know exactly what is going on, the crazy strokes of luck over and over.  It goes on and on.

The movie is also heavily tainted with the stink of wannabe Disney.  You know what I mean about live-action Disney movies.  Unreasonable action that should kill the characters right and left.  The main character flying through the air and breaking through brick walls without even flinching. Many millions of dollars of damage done along the way and no one really cares.  Descendants looking exactly like their ancestors and continuing a feud just because someone cursed someone else.  A steady stream of jokes and comic music as people are dying.  The movie is beyond predictable and stiflingly formulaic.

I thought for a while maybe these things bother me because it was written for a younger audience.  One without mature tastes.  My kids won't sit through it, though.  Not even close.  At the end of the day I'm not sure who the target audience is.  It's a shame.  There were good animators involved.  How Spielberg, Jackson, Kennedy,  Moffat, Willams, and the rest of the all-star cast could turn this out is beyond me.",1407974400,2,1967,4.8

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: In a ripping return to the Saturday morning adventure serials that inspired 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', Steven Spielberg brings a beloved European comic to the silver screen using motion capture performances and 3D CGI animation. As creative partners, Mr. Spielberg collaborates with Peter Jackson, who acts as producer on this film and intends to direct the second part of what they hope will be a trilogy, and screenwriters Steven Moffat [Screenwriter for Doctor Who], Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish.

Tintin, as voiced by Jamie Bell, is a young journalist whose inquisitive nature sends him off on countless adventures to recover stolen antiquities...or at least that's what all of the newspaper articles on the walls of Tintin's study tells us. This time around, Tintin purchases a model ship, the Unicorn, from a street vendor moments before the mysterious, and most likely dangerous, Sakharine [Daniel Craig] arrives to buy it. Tintin keeps the Unicorn, which he learns is a model of a ship captained by one Sir Francis Haddock that sank hundreds of years ago with a long, lost treasure. However, legend says only ""a true Haddock will be able to uncover the lost treasure of the Unicorn.""

Sakharine will stop at nothing to get the model, including murder and kidnapping, but thanks to Tintin's bumbling Interpol agent friends, Thompson and Thomson [the always funny Simon Pegg and Nick Frost], and a local pickpocket, Sakharine snatches Tintin, but doesn't get his hands on the secret scroll hidden within the model ship's mast. Tintin wakes in the cargo hold of a freighter steaming for foreign soil. Sakharine has hijacked the freighter from its captain, the last surviving Haddock [Andy Serkis]. Here it becomes clear: there were three Unicorn models, and Sakharine plans to find three scrolls and use Captain Haddock's family knowledge to find the Unicorn's location. Trouble is Captain Haddock's a drunk, and has forgotten all the old Haddock family stories. It's up to Tintin to pull the truth out of Haddock while racing across oceans and deserts to beat the nefarious and deadly Sakharine to the lost treasure.

As I live in the United Kingdom, I've had little exposure to the original comic books, even though there are great deals of massive fans in the UK, who know more about this cartoon Character. Written by Belgium Herg [a.k.a. Georges Prosper Remi], save for a few High School French classes and, while there are numerous in-jokes and references to the comic itself (or at least I think there are, based on the reactions others, who claimed to know the comic, when I saw the film theatrically), this is a really strong adaptation for all audiences, whether or not you're a lifetime fan.

So how does it measure up? Well, personally speaking, I really loved the Indiana Jones feeling of it all, and felt the filmmaking, performances, tone, and adventure worked very well. There are some contrivances, and Tintin's lines are a bit convoluted, but this is a real return to the Amblin and Steven Spielberg I love and very impressed with the use of motion capture to build the character performances and the overall improvements in the animation quality succeeded.

'The Adventures of Tintin' is also a lot of fun. The action set pieces are clever, funny, and tense. My jaw hit the floor a number of times, especially during the Unicorn vs. the Pirate ship scene, the single shot motorcycle chase sequence, and the battling harbour cranes fight. The camera work is playful in a way that harkens back to Steven Spielberg's 1970s and 1980s heyday. In fact, the experience is such a throwback to the wonder if the film, which lacks a certain cynicism found in modern blockbusters and works as well for younger audiences.

Overall, I think fans of Steven Spielberg or the Tintin comic books will enjoy this comedic, romping adventure. Tintin fans will no doubt get more of the in-jokes. As for casual viewers, there's a lot of fun to have for the entire family, unless you have a hard time connecting to motion capture performances.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Tintin tackles the 3D world with a subtle but magnificent looking 1080p encoded image that will dazzle and amaze most viewers. Its 2D counterpart is already fantastic enough as it is, and the 3D merely enhances the CGI video by placing emphasis on quality and depth rather than the usual pop-out gimmicks. Granted, a couple scenes do have random items protrude from the screen, mostly for amusement or as a comical device, like when Rackham points his cane at the camera, but by and large, the presentation is on immersing viewers into the third-dimension with a great deal of natural depth, which it does in spades. Buildings on the European streets and long hallways seem elongated and distant, genuinely feeling as if far removed from the foreground. Other objects appear to move independently of each other, such as when Tintin and Captain Haddock meet for the first time inside his cramped quarters. In fact, several of the best moments come while the two run around the Karaboudjan and try to make their escape. Later on, during a wild chase on the confined streets of Bagghar down to the harbour, the rapid camera movements and non-stop action is the film's coolest sequence, arguably making it one of the best uses of the 3D technology yet. On a large enough screen, it quite literally feels like being on a roller coaster ride, weaving and zigzagging between buildings and people. The film comes with several dark scenes, and never does delineation within the deep, murky shadows come into question. The rest of the presentation is equally outstanding with pitch-perfect contrast and superb, crystal-clear clarity, allowing viewers to see far into the distance. Black levels are inky and penetrating with extraordinary gradational steps in the grayscale, adding to the layers of dimensionality already present in the video. Although the photography comes with a slightly antiquated appeal to it, colours are vivid and richly-saturated, leaping off the screen with an energetic pop. The transfer is beautifully detailed from beginning to end, revealing the smallest imperfections on clothing, architecture and the walls of the ship. One can really appreciate the artwork and effort that went into the film's making as the faces of characters have a lifelike texture that almost makes them seem real. Captain Haddock's nose and cheeks are probably the most impressive, sure to leave viewers astonished with this awesome high-definition 3D presentation.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The audio is the same as its 2D counterpart and makes a wonderful addition to the video's immersive effect. The 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack makes excellent use of the system as it comes natively in a 7.1 soundscape. Directionality and panning is absolutely flawless as bullets and vehicles zoom all around the room, and the debris from explosions flies overhead as well as to the sides. There's not much to speak of in terms of ambience, but a few atmospherics quietly sneak into the rears, generating a decently pleasant sound field. John Williams' animated score also enjoys a strong presence in the surrounds, filling the air with excitement and adventure. Much of the runtime is spent on the front soundstage since a great deal of the narrative is dialogue-driven. Conversations are very well-prioritized and perfectly audible during the movie's several high points. Dynamic range is expansive with room-penetrating clarity, allowing listeners to revel in a variety of sounds and noises which make the action sequences come alive. Again, John Williams music benefits most with clear instrumentation and terrific acoustical detail. Low-frequency effects are a plenty with powerful, full-bodied explosions and punchy gunshots. 'Tintin' makes an awesome debut audio.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras: For this 3D Blu-ray edition of 'Tintin,' Paramount adds several high-definition exclusives to the package, along with the 3D version of the movie, a DVD copy and BD-Live Functionality. Arriving day-and-date as its 2D counterpart, the Blu-ray shares a couple of supplements with the DVD release, along with a code for accessing an Digital Copy or downloading a Digital Copy.

Special Feature: Toasting Tintin: Part 2 [2012] [1080p] [3:00] Another toast from by the filmmakers after completing the film.

Finally, Directed by Steven Spielberg and produced by Peter Jackson, 'The Adventures of Tintin' is a fun and thrilling big-screen adaptation of Herg's beloved classic comic books. The CGI animated action-packed adventure animation film is reminiscent of Steven Spielberg's 'Indiana Jones' franchise films, but stands on its own as an entertaining and rousing motion picture for the whole family. This 3D Blu-ray edition of the film arrives with a first-rate audio and video presentation that's sure to satisfy everyone. Bonus material is fairly extensive, and most of it is exclusive to Blu-ray, making this wild thrill-ride worth the price. Again like a lot of people who are not a fan of this Belgium author Herg [aka Georges Prosper Remi] and the books of Tintin and `The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn' animation film fills in the gaps for us who are not up on the exploits of Tintin and the film is based on three of Herg's books entitled: The Crab with the Golden Claws [1941], The Secret of the Unicorn [1943], and Red Rackham's Treasure [1944] and I think Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson have done a grand job in bringing the pages of the Herg books to life and I can tell you it is a brilliant animation film that will give you a brilliant rollercoaster ride and the voice artists really bring the characters to life and I can also tell you that you will have an amazing experience, especially in the fantastic 3D image experience and it is such an honour to add this to me ever increasing Steven Spielberg Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!

5001222,5,B006L4ZEDW,"I love tintin the only thing I hate about tintin is that penguins of madagascar has a bigger name then this so the movie and game for tintin didn't  make much money the penguins game sucked and tintin was fun but it was $5.00 and the penguins were $15.00 and it was made in 2011 really but you'll love tintin and so would even adults so I think there part two would make more then the penguins because of the last one so I'll try to look at it that way it needs 100,000 stars per person",1406592000,,486,4.010309278350515

5001224,5,B006L4ZEDW,"This is such a great movie.  I remember reading the Tintin books when I was young, and I couldn't believe it when I heard they were making a movie of it.  This turned out phenomenally too.  The voice acting was spot on, the animation was just outstanding, the story was well thought out, and the action and humor you find in this movie are more than enough to keep the parents engaged when watching this with the kids.  It is one of the better 3D movies Ive seen to date too.  Its one of the ones Ill throw in when showing 3D to friends and family.  My 4 year old daughter loves it when we put this one on.  If you're teeter-tottering on whether or not to pick it up, dont.  It is great for all ages.",1406505600,,700,4.0583941605839415

5001226,5,B006L4ZEDW,"Years ago when I was a youngster reading comics, Tin Tin was a favorite of mine.  I've seen some of the French editions and  I could follow the story without reading the translations.  If you want to know what kind of movie this is, think Indiana Jones!  Only in this version, created decades before Indiana Jones, it's about a young reporter, a dog and a crusty sea captain seeking adventure,solving mysteries, and finding lost ancient lost treasures.  This movie wasn't embraced by American audiences but as viewer of great cinema, I think it's a movie you should see at least once in your lifetime. I liked this film so much I'm going to purchase all three volumes of the animated series. I hope someday there is a sequel, only my concern is, it will be a direct to DVD release.  This was a very high quality, roller coaster of an adventure!  It's too bad there wasn't more promotion and merchandising behind this film.  It might have helped to sell this to an American audience.",1406332800,,982,4.603448275862069

Being French, his adventures were better known in Europe than the states. This movie brings the Adventures of Tin Tin to the greater American Public. The story is great and fun to watch.  You need not have watched the French cartoons or have read the Comic books, to enjoy this movie.  The animation is first rate.  I liked this film.",1403913600,,445,4.313253012048193

5001236,5,B006L4ZEDW,"This gem isn't talked about much. Some how it has managed to skate through seemingly unnoticed by many. Ask a friend or family member and more than likely they haven't seen Spielberg's magic with Tin tin. Plot= good, visuals= good, Characters =good. The fact of the matter is Tin tin one of best animated movies within this decade. The sheer attention to detail (like many of the cool scene transitions)  shoots this movie over the top let alone some of the best animation I have seen in the newer crop of 3d style animated movies. A definite must own. After watching it 5 times you might just be able to catch all of the minor  extras and easter eggs.

5001243,5,B006L4ZEDW,"This effort by Spielberg and Associates again raises the bar on entertainment, as he always has and continues to provide to the general public.  It is an adventure movie in the great traditions on celluloid that Twain gave on the printed page.  That might seem like an exalted comparison until you see this for yourself, which I urge you to do with your whole family,  especially the little ones, who will forever remember this as one of their finest childhood experiences in entertainment as many of us do from early Disney classics, whose studios now, alas, pander to the lowest common denominator.  This film has no profanity or sexual innuendo, which is refreshing and a relief from the usual run of ""so-called"" family films that now dominate, that genre!",1401753600,,759,4.8604651162790695

5001251,4,B006L4ZEDW,"For those of us who grew up with Tintin, this was an exciting chance to add to our Tintin experience.
I think Tintin was brilliantly captured, a little less effeminate than in the early animated films,
It would never have been the same without Tintin's wonderful dog Snowy-loved when Snowy tamed the Rottweiler that was chasing Tintin and made him into a friend, and his struggle on the ship with rat for a sandwich.  And Captain Haddock was captured down to a pat.-absolutely classic.
The film combines three Tintin adventure books-The Secret of the Unicorn, Red Rackham's Treasure, and
The Crab with the Golden Claws
It begins with Tintin's innocent purchase at a flew market of a model 17th century ship which leads to his life being endangered and on a thrilling, dangerous adventure.
Also like the touch of the evil Professor Saccharin being Red Rackham's  descendant bent on a centuries  long feud with the Captains' descendants
Action scenes were a little long but this is an action adventure after all.
Also liked how the scenes effortlessly moved in the Captain's delirium from the desert to his battles with Red Rackham.
A little disappointed about no adventures for Tintin and friends in the Caribbean as in the book of Red Rackham's Treasure.
But the touch of brining in opera diva Bianca Castafiore was quite amusing. A lot of the dialogue was amusing and a a great inspirational speech by Haddock near the end when Tintin is ready to give up. 'Failed. There are plenty of others willing to call you a failure. A fool. A loser. A hopeless souse. Don't you ever say it of yourself. You send out the wrong signal, that is what people pick up. Don't you understand? You care about something, you fight for it. You hit a wall, you push through it. There's something you need to know about failure, Tintin. You can never let it defeat you.'
Yes I enjoyed this.",1401235200,2,1868,4.706422018348624
5001252,3,B006L4ZEDW,This movie was entertaining and it got a little long.  There were times during the chase scenes that it seemed like the producers were just trying to find new obstacles and fantastic rescues to add to the scene.,1401148800,,211,4.552631578947368

5001259,3,B006L4ZEDW,I have to say overall the movie wasn't too bad. I should have looked into the movie a little more in depth before letting my younger children watch it. I thought because it was animated it would be more child friendly but ultimately it's the adventures of an alcoholic sea captain and a young man that many people want to kill. Almost a cartoon version of a James Bond film minus sex and cursing.,1400457600,,396,4.364864864864865

5001265,3,B006L4ZEDW,"My only interest in seeing this film was the fact that Jamie Bell provided the voice of the story's main character. I know...that's far less than an open minded approach to reviewing a movie but I'm just being honest.

The animation is pretty good but not perfect. I found the storyline to also be pretty good but how can you go wrong with a red headed kid, a cute white dog and an evil villain? I think most kids would enjoy the tale although I did find my attention beginning to wander astray about midway through it.

I rated it only 3 stars despite Bell's role. That being said, one should keep in mind that I've rarely given any animated film more than 2 stars. lol",1400284800,,670,4.309523809523809

5001299,5,B006L4ZEDW,"The animation in this film is way above average, so are the action scenes. I was quite pleasantly surprised with the adventure of Tintin.",1398384000,,137,4.75
5001300,5,B006L4ZEDW,"I really enjoyed this great movie, great animations, and great story. Hope the adventure continues in the near future. Thanks",1398384000,,125,5.3
5001301,4,B006L4ZEDW,Normally I hate animated movies but happened on this one. My husband HATES animated movies but he also watched it. We both laughed out loud in places and found it thoroughly enjoyable.,1398211200,,184,4.78125
5001302,5,B006L4ZEDW,The Steven Spielberg and John Williams duo once again make a film which is fun for all ages.  Plot is well written and animation is spectacular.  In some ways reminiscent of Raiders of the Lost Ark.,1398211200,,198,4.472222222222222
5001303,5,B006L4ZEDW,Thanks for a great movie.  I would hope that there could there be more children movies of the same type.,1398124800,,104,4.2

5001305,4,B006L4ZEDW,"A lot of the new 3D movies are disappointing, but this one isn't -- it's a lively, good-natured boys-own adventure tale, with inventive 3D effects.  Not one of Spielberg's greatest, perhaps, but good, solid entertainment.",1398038400,3,221,5.314285714285714
5001306,1,B006L4ZEDW,"My wife and daughter really like this movie ,but, I personally can't stand it. This reminds me a lot of Polar Express in the sense that it relies upon its incredibly detailed animation to compensate for its complete lack of storyline and direction. I am not overly impressed by a movie that can only deliver 2 hours worth of special effects with almost no storyline. Watch for yourself and make your own decision. Who knows, you might like it...",1398038400,7,445,4.6455696202531644

5001308,5,B006L4ZEDW,There were a few plot twist in the move but I did feel like it was a surprise. Once things start happening it continues right to the end. Great family movie.,1397779200,,157,4.096774193548387
5001309,4,B006L4ZEDW,"It wasn't a perfect movie, but for eye popping practically Rube Goldberg style situations, this movie had them, and was a great attempt to use the unlimited visuals of CGI and motion capture to convey some acting behind all that technology. The film, though aimed at a young crowd, didn't shy away from bizarre drinking problem moments, actual swashbucking, dehydration. In the end, you could feel the Spielberg effect on this movie, which can be a turn off for some movie viewers, and the hyper-CGI look (realistic isn't really applicable here) still suffers from the uncanny valley effect, though not as bad as other full CGI movies of the past, especially when the source material (TinTin is a longtime graphic novel , but not in the US) is so beautifully illustrated that they could have tried to go a different art direction, but in many cases rendering that cartoon/pulp fiction look may have been even harder to visualize, since this is more a display of the advancements of mo-cap (Peter Jackson can't get enough of Andy Serkis doing another mo-cap performance).All in all, a fun movie, if you give it a chance.",1397779200,,1119,4.833333333333333

Has good guy ending that satisfies.",1397520000,,284,4.64

5001313,5,B006L4ZEDW,"I grow up reading Tintin. So, when I heard about Spielberg's project I felt like ""YES!"".

I watched the 3D version in the theater. It was awesome, then I bought the 3D Bluray version, it is awesome too.

Seeing all your characters coming to life us priceless. Don't get me wrong, I like reading comic books, but seeing them in action, that's priceless.

Thanks to the whole team those made that classic a reality.",1397520000,,413,4.554054054054054

5001317,4,B006L4ZEDW,"First I enjoy animations. And today's animation technologies make watching animations worthwhile for me. I tend to watch them for the fidelity of the world they are creating and the story being told.

While I enjoyed the movie my grandson got bored and moved on to something else (no context).",1397260800,,293,4.86
5001318,3,B006L4ZEDW,Great animation with a happy ending.  However it was a one time watch for me because it was exhausting to watch,1397260800,,111,4.285714285714286
5001319,5,B006L4ZEDW,"Outside of one of the main characters being an absolute booze hound, this movie is a home run.  My young boys think this movie is the coolest movie ever!  There is a defiantly need for more movies like TinTin!!!",1397260800,,211,4.384615384615385

5001330,3,B006L4ZEDW,"A young man's adventure story as if he were an adult in the world. The animation is very good, but the story goes on just way to long. TinTin is the boy who can do anything and it gets a little unbelievable that he can. His dog snowy is the smartest dog you will ever find.",1396828800,,273,3.892857142857143
5001331,4,B006L4ZEDW,"A well-executed film, though the action was a bit on the overkill side (can't believe I'm actually saying that) without a true chance to pause for breath.  While I understand this was a compression of three of he books in the series, this film could have easily been three of them on their own.  Hopefully the next two films in the series will take a (slightly) slower pace.",1396742400,,374,4.485294117647059

5001333,2,B006L4ZEDW,"First off, I love animated movies, but this one was a total miss for me. I never read any of the comics or had an influence to watch this movie prior to seeing it. The beginning was okay, but as the story progressed, and the adventure started, I began to roll my eyes a lot. My review will contain a few spoilers in it. They chose to put the wallet thief in the movie, which I found a bit, well I don't think weird is the word I'm looking for. Pointless maybe, although he was quite a bit weird. The dog, now I'm sure is very intelligent and loyal. But then other animals kept popping up that were just as intelligent and loyal. Mainly the hawk (the other was the rat). Eventually it got annoying, and more over-the-top than it should have. But what really annoyed me was the scene in the, well I wasn't paying 100% attention, but the desert city. Her voice breaking the bullet-proof glass, the un-tearable pieces of paper, the building cascading down the cliff, shooting a bazooka backwards. And although those are the big ones that I remember, annoyances like this caught my attention through out the movie. Again, I never read the comics but to me this movie was extremely far-fetch-annoyance. Besides, I never really got caught up in the story to begin with. I felt it could have been done better and/or differently, like Up, How to train your dragon, or Finding Nemo. To name a few.",1396569600,,1387,4.464566929133858

5001336,5,B006L4ZEDW,Great movie. Awesome animation. This is very well done and the action never stops. Scenes are so real vivid you will forget it's an animation and get lost in it.,1396396800,,161,4.4

I've always loved animation, this was very well done and made me seek out the documentary on Herge. A product from Spielberg and Jackson had to be great (it is), and Bell, Serkis and Craig did wonderful voice overs. Really successful blend of talent and presentation.",1394582400,,421,4.943661971830986

5001357,5,B006L4ZEDW,I had very little knowledge of this film when it was coming around all that I knew was that it was an animated Indiana Jones type movie with Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson working on it. Then in my freshman year of highschool my french teacher had a stack of TinTin books in the cabinet for us to read . Since I heard what it is I decided to check one out and was instantly hooked. I would be borrowing one each day and love each and everyone so much even the ones that looked boring by the look of the cover and I was excited to see the movie instantly and bought it on blu ray because I missed the theatre release but I did want to see it before when it was in theatres because it did look cool. This movie felt like a huge nostalgia feel even though I had just read the books and it is just an amazing Adventure and makes me feel like a little kid and I am completely excited for the next one.,1393718400,,900,3.977900552486188

5001363,5,B006L4ZEDW,A tale that resembles an Indiana Jones action film but because it is an animated film they could easily carry the action of those antics to an extreme. I particularly loved the flight scene where the storm put the crew and passengers of the small plane into an anti-gravity state. Combine that with the weak virtues of the Captain to add some humor to almost any scene.,1393372800,,369,4.522388059701493
5001364,2,B006L4ZEDW,"The movie is visually stunning, but the story itself was dull. I don't know. It just didn't draw my interest. It's basically about Tin Tin buying an old model ship, which just so happens to be the object of obsession for a villainous party. There's a hidden treasure map or something. Since TIn Tin doesn't give it up for any price, the villainous dude goes after him. ADVENTURE! ensues.

You're almost better turning off the sound to just stare at the pretty pictures.",1393372800,,469,4.650602409638554

5001387,5,B006L4ZEDW,"This movie brought to life the comic book in very good and different way.  It was not just a ""cartoon animation"" of the comic book which has been already done in the early 90s, but it wove in the characters with lifelike features.  At times, I felt I was looking at a real person, and the mood generated as the story unfolds is very captivating. I strongly recommend it for all family members.",1391472000,,393,4.36986301369863

5001392,4,B006L4ZEDW,"My son loves Tintin books and the cartoon episodes (we have one DVD coded for the European region just so he can watch them all since not all are a ail able in US format).  He loves this movie even though he feels the cartoons are more true to the books (even at 8 he is a but of a purist).  I agree.  It is fun and entertaining.  People should note that this movie combines several of the books, not just one.  Only issue for some people might be many references to alcohol use and abuse, hard not to include with a story involving Haddock.  Also cartoonish violence on par with books.  Again, if the content of the books is fine with you the movie will likely not shock and dismay you.  Pop the corn and snuggle up for a fun movie night for the family (even my daughter laughs all the way through and then allows that it is ""ok""...such a tween).",1390953600,,847,4.153374233128834

5001397,3,B006L4ZEDW,"Watched this after Rin Tin Tin and there is no comparison with the original tale.  It's alright to have on while you are doing something else, but I wouldn't sit there and watch it.",1390867200,,181,4.323529411764706

5001402,4,B006L4ZEDW,"I wasn't sure what to expect, but I thought the production was quite delightful. It was apparent that Spielberg had a soft spot for this story and one could see his likeness in a couple characters. I'm not sure young children would enjoy it or follow the story line, but I think older children would like it. Just go along for the ride--the animation draws you in quickly.",1390176000,,372,4.485294117647059

5001406,5,B006L4ZEDW,Love the animation. Great story line. No longer a comic strip out o the Sunday paper!! Would recommend to friends and their children.,1390003200,,133,4.826086956521739

5001408,5,B006L4ZEDW,"My whole family loved this movie and we all gave it a resounding thumbs up when we saw it in the cinema. Now it's time to own it on Blu-Ray.

A great adventure story and a visual spectacle to behold. Brilliant characters and situations, both funny and serious. Far flung destinations that are so rich in their color and detail you just can't take it all in, be it on land, sea or air. You get it all.

A great film and a brilliant accomplishment technically. I really hope they make more of these.",1389744000,,497,4.276595744680851

5001410,4,B006L4ZEDW,"A fun film, filled with adventure. I used to read the comics as a kid and was worried the film wouldn't live up to them. Not the case at all. It was great and I enjoyed it very much.",1389744000,,182,3.6923076923076925
5001411,5,B006L4ZEDW,We have read the books numerous times in English and French and so were a bit worried. We needn't have been this was right on the spirit of the originals.,1389657600,,154,4.166666666666667
5001412,4,B006L4ZEDW,"This movie is great BUT parents beware it has heavy mature elements that might offend some viewers. I had to do a lot of explaining during the whole film to my eight year old. There's heavy drinking, smoking, and some language which for a cartoon kids movie is unexpected. But as an adult it was a great movie and my husband and I enjoyed it!",1389398400,,342,4.276923076923077
5001413,5,B006L4ZEDW,"This was such a fun movie.  I wish plotlines like this weren't such a thing of the past.  Tintin is an old-fashioned hero - unassuming, adventurous, and always ready to help a fellow human being in need.",1389398400,,203,4.45945945945946

5001416,5,B006L4ZEDW,I highly recommend this movie to any Tintin fans. Spielberg did a great job or compiling two or three episodes.,1389139200,,111,4.6
5001417,2,B006L4ZEDW,"We lbought this movie to add to our small collection of 3-D movies for our new TV, since several reviews said it was a good 3-D film. Maybe, but not the best we've seen, but what put us of was that we could not make heads or tails of the so-called plot. We found sout later lthat the movie is a smashed together complilation of three of the Tintin novels. We just assumed it was a movie taken from one novel, and didn't realize there was a series of these Tintin books. If you are a follower of these books, then I think you would probably enjoy the movie, but since we knew nothing about Tintin and his adventures, it was a mish-mash, and we were all lost pretty quickly. After watching about half of the movie, we all gave up on it, turned it off and returned it to Amazon.",1389052800,,775,4.139072847682119

5001422,5,B006L4ZEDW,"Having read the comic books, this movie did them justice. I watched with my son and daughter and they loved it too. It's a movie that I recommend to watch with the kids. At the end, my daughter (10 years old) asked: ""When are we watching the sequel?""",1388620800,,250,4.229166666666667

5001426,5,B006L4ZEDW,"I thought this was a great movie and watched it with my 7 and 9 year old children. There was violence in the movie, but no where near as much as other movies or tv shows the kids currently watch. I don't think I needed to shield the kids from Tintin, but other parents may feel otherwise.",1388361600,,288,4.0701754385964914

5001430,5,B006L4ZEDW,"Watched with our 8-year old who's been reading TinTin books for the past year. It was great. Fun with good message, but it's a little mixed up in some violence and drunkeness.",1388016000,,175,4.5
5001431,4,B006L4ZEDW,Loved it.  Would recommend it to children and adults alike. A movie I would buy for friends and family. Merry Christmas.,1387238400,,120,4.714285714285714
5001432,5,B006L4ZEDW,"Good story line, and animation that dazzles. Sometimes the characters and scenery look like you're watching live TV. Amazing! The end of the movie sets you up for a sequel, but don't know if one's coming or not.",1387238400,,211,4.578947368421052
5001433,5,B006L4ZEDW,Loved every minute. Fantastic storyline with wonderful character development and spectacular animation. So good you forget it isn't real. Can't wait to see the next one if/when it comes out!,1387238400,,190,5.366666666666666

5001436,1,B006L4ZEDW,"Lucky for Spielberg Herg no longer is, because he would either have cried or laugh at this ridiculous movie. The books are class and timeless. As a fan of TinTin comic books, you return to reading them again and again even when you are older. The characters are so well defined and the stories unfold with attention to detail. I don't know how the producers could have missed that. Either they took advantage of an internationally successful series of comic books knowing it would draw people or just naively missed on something to evolved for them.

Only see this film if you know nothing of TinTin books and don't plan on reading any.",1386979200,4,636,4.628318584070796
5001437,4,B006L4ZEDW,"Saw this in the theatre with my two young grandsons( 9&10).  While I did think some of the action scenes were a little over the top, it's a movie and even live action movies are way overblown.  The bottom line is the animation was amazing and the boys really enjoyed it.  It was fun.",1386892800,,283,4.203703703703703
5001438,5,B006L4ZEDW,This movie has much more action than expected.  I was expecting a kids movie and got an animated spin on Raiders of the Lost Ark.,1386892800,,129,4.16

5001441,5,B006L4ZEDW,I had read all of the TinTin books here in Brasil and even have them all. They helped me to learn Portuguese. The film is so true to the books that it is astounding. I enjoyed this film very much.,1386547200,,196,3.925

5001448,5,B006L4ZEDW,"I started buying a lot of 3D movies after finally getting a 3D TV and so far ""Tintin"" has been my favorite of all the 3d Movies I have seen at home. Visually stunning, I can't believe how good animated films have become. When I say favorite 3D I don't mean because of the 3d effects hanging out of the screen, or the in your face stuff.  I just mean cause of the graphic's.
The Story is pretty good but the visual's are what still the show here.",1385164800,,445,4.056818181818182

5001454,4,B006L4ZEDW,Loved getting reacquainted with the characters and I think that was the best part of the film. I wish the film had just been one adventure rather than a mashup...and the crane scene addition was over the top.,1382745600,,208,4.5
5001455,4,B006L4ZEDW,"I did not know much about this picture before watching it, so I had little expectations going into the experience. I was able to follow the plot, and it was engaging and clever, helping the story build nicely. I was pleased to be thrust into an ever-changing environment from a busy city square, to modern pirates, to an Arabic paradise. The Adventures of Tintin captured the kid in me for certain, and was an enjoyable plight. I can't say that I learned a great deal or had my views broadened in any sense, but there was no disappointment from this fun and exciting story of unlikely friends.",1382572800,,593,4.5514018691588785

5001459,4,B006L4ZEDW,"When I saw the trailers for this I was beyong excited! I grew up watching the animated series with my dad, how could this not be exciting??
1. I would say this (as one would expect) is amazing work by Steven Spielberg, but arguably not his best
2. The voice cast is phenominal, I always enjoy watching kids movies and being able to recognize the voices of actors. (The young adult crowd should without hesitation be able to hear Daniel Craig, Pegg and Frost!)
3. As others have mentioned, the movie plot blends classic Tintin stories into one master plot and the writing was tastefully and most importantly seamlessly done
4. The CGI can be quite magical, especially scenes that are zoom in/ out of either positive or negative space onto the next chapter.
5. What one might find disappointing with the CGI will quickly be forgotten with all the fine details in scenes much like the original Tintin series
6. Some liberties were taken on character representation, but I think that's a given when pumping new life into an old series, overall I think it was well done
7. Cameo, cameo, cameo, cameo...see if you can spot it! :)
8. Overall, I liked this as a family/ kids movie, as for the little kid in me that so much enjoyed the animated series, it missed the mark a little bit.",1382400000,,1276,4.528138528138528
5001460,5,B006L4ZEDW,This movie was amazing. My toddler was a bit less interested. But then again I was using it to distract him from a new baby brother. It's so realistic that I am the one who ended up loving it! Great family movie!,1382140800,,212,4.071428571428571
5001461,4,B006L4ZEDW,I gave this a 4 star rating because the animation was impressive and very clear. The story was very much like the stories from the Tin Tin books. Good for all ages.,1382054400,,164,4.15625

Third, when I finally got around to watching this movie my expectations got in the way of what I saw, a gang of thugs out to murder a boy and his dog for a scrap of paper.  Ideal subject matter for a children's movie.

Why employ a photorealistic style of animation when you could just as easily achieve the same results with live action?  It felt more than a little redundant, ultimately just a nifty gimmick that worked well only part of the time.  As for the story, it's a treasure hunt/quest and an endless chase sequence.  Poor Tintin and Snowy (my favorite character) were continuously undermined, outsmarted, plagued by misfortune/misadventure, thwarted by an unbeatable enemy until the very last second when he's abruptly vanquished and summarily dismissed from the rest of the tale.  ""Great snakes!""  There is such a thing as too much plot, of things being too frantic, and not a little repetitious.  I liked parts of it but not as a whole.  There was just something off-putting about the process: real and yet not real.  But I do love the score, I thought they picked the perfect actor to voice Tintin (Jamie Bell), the dog was great, Thomson and Tompson were perfect, and Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis) was fun.

5001493,3,B006L4ZEDW,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

'The Adventures of Tintin' has been described as a ""3D motion capture computer-animated epic adventure."" Like many Spielberg productions, the story represents a hearkening back to yesteryear. It's similar to Spielberg's 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' series, in that it involves a search for lost treasure, in the spirit of the old radio and movie serials. It also involves the struggle between a clear cut noble protagonist and calculating, villainous antagonist.

I never really was able to figure out how old Tintin, the young journalist protagonist, is supposed to be. Somehow probably between 16 and possibly 22. Anyway, the plot is not overly complicated. Tintin buys a model ship, the Unicorn, at a flea market and it's actually one of three models, that contain a scroll. When pieced together, the three scrolls, reveal the location of sunken treasure.

Tintin's model ship is stolen by Sakharine, the antagonist, who later is revealed to be a descendant of Red Rackham, a pirate who attempted to gain possession of the actual 17th century ship, The Unicorn; but he ends up being thwarted by the ship's captain, Sir Francis Haddock, who intentionally sank  The Unicorn, in order to prevent Rackham from taking possession of the treasure on board. It turns out that Haddock's descendant, Captain Haddock, is manning an old freighter, which Sakharine takes over by inducing a mutiny amongst the ship's crew, in order to pilot it to Bagghar, a fictional port city in colonial French Morocco, where he intends to steal the third model ship, from a powerful, well-to-do sheik.

Where 'Tintin' really takes off is in the deliriously choreographed 3D motion capture computer-animated sequences. There's a chase involving Silk, a pickpocket, in late 40s (?) or early 50s (?) Brussels, who has stolen Tinton's scroll from Unicorn #1. Then there's another great sequence where Tinton and a drunken Haddock escape the freighter in a lifeboat and eventually make their way to Morocco in a stolen seaplane. If that isn't enough, Sakharine steals the third scroll during an operatic concert for the Sheikh, given by a woman who reminded me of Margaret Dumont (from the Marx Brothers). Finally, there's a great chase scene, where the good guys finally apprehend Sakharine.

'Tintin' falls flat in its attempt to be periodically humorous. There are two Scotland Yard detectives, Thompson and Thompson, who are too inept to be funny and then there's Captain Haddock, whose drunk act, proves ultimately tiresome. Tintin himself simply doesn't have enough idiosyncrasies to be a compelling protagonist, and comes across as a generic sleuth. What really kills 'Tintin' in terms of narrative, is the lack of a romantic interest for Tintin or at least some kind of female foil, that could spark things up. Tintin has a lot of action for prepubescent boys, but adults will probably find quite a bit of this stuff, simply juvenile. I recommend Tintin for all the technical wizardry, but the target audience is really best suited for ages eight through twelve!",1378080000,,3080,5.101190476190476

5001507,4,B006L4ZEDW,TinTin is a solid movie that is good for most children as it is not too scary.  The animation is terrific and shows what a talented team can put together.

5001511,5,B006L4ZEDW,"I have seen this movie three times since it came out. My siblings and I were introduced to Tintin as preteens when we lived overseas. My family's first official pet, a white toy poodle, was named after Snowy; Snowy passed away several years ago. When I first saw the character Snowy in the movie, it brought back some memories!

I thought this was a great movie version of the comic books. Tintin, Snowy, Captain Haddock, and Thompson & Thompson were perfectly portrayed! My sister-in-law who had never read the books was bothered by the Captain's drinking, but I knew that was just like his character in the book (Tintin's character does a good job of showing how he disapproves of this behavior during the course of the movie). In regards to the storyline, Tintin and his adventures are just that, they are adventures! There isn't some great moral or I would say a particular message that the comic books are trying to get across; they are just about a young man and his dog and the mysteries that they attempt to solve, the adventures that cross their paths. I think the movie does a perfect job of showing that.

The movie is family friendly and would be appropriate across ages, but it does have more violence than most kids animated movies, because of the type of story that it is. It has a couple of mild swear words, but no inappropriate or dirty humor, keeping it just like the comics. As a fan of Tintin, I really think the movie was made for the fans, not necessarily as a kid movie, but probably to introduce new people (children) to Tintin. It may not have done a good job of that, but Tintin has been around for years, and has never become popular in the US. If you haven't read any of the comics, you should definitely try them. They are comics that I would want my children to grow up reading, good, clean mysteries, with an intelligent protagonist, trusty sidekick, and fun and interesting secondary characters.",1376352000,,1928,4.569364161849711

The movies characters are all big nosed, which I find to be weird and unattractive except for TinTin himself and his dog Snow.

Lighting, shadows and details were very realistic when the story called for it, or were somewhat cartoonish when needed for effect. The story was very entertaining, however my grandsons found it a little long and started to lose interest near the end because it was so long. Great movie though, please check it out!",1374105600,,574,4.75
5001534,5,B006L4ZEDW,"As one of the movie critics said, Tintin has a great job: he is a reporter who only goes on adventure and doesn't seem to write any article at all, but he is getting famous anyway!

For the people who knows Tintin, the comic book (or ""Bande Dessine"" as we say in France), The adventures of Tintin are a mix of ""The Crab with the Golden Claws"" and ""The Secret of the Unicorn"". While looking to pierce the mystery of the Unicorn, Tintin and Snowy encounter Capitain Haddock, and the three of them continue this adventure through the Karaboudjan (Haddock's ship), the Sahara, and Brussels.

Visually speaking, this movie is by far the most accomplished animation movie ever made. This can be seen with the characters, who are all amazingly drawn and animated at a point it is troubling. They look indeed so real, but yet specific ""Comic book"" elements are kept. That allows Spielberg to show unbelievable scene - like the one in Bagghar - that would annoy in a realistic movies, but are simply enjoyed in this case. You can compare this to Myazaki's movies, which shows believable character in situation not so believable, but some little moments (inertia, size of the tears, etc.) help for the movie coherence.
So yes, the characters animation is astonishing. The action scenes are great too, though not as detailed as the characters. Yet a 10/10 for the reatlisation for sure!

As for the story, many people got upset that two stories are mixed to produce one movie, or that Professor Calculus wasn't introduce. The fact is that the movie feels a bit long - especially at the end - and has multiple slow moments. I think people who read Tintin as a kid/teenager had a ""too much/too little"" feeling after this movie, hoping for more and regretting some parts.
My understanding is that Spielberg use these Comics to make an adventure movie, and he succeeded in it: it is thrilling, interesting, funny and Comic-y. However, there are two moments that creates problem.
 - The first is the rememberance of Haddock about his ancestor, which is a way to introduce the plot of the next movie, more than explaining this movie's story. This wasn't necessary, and could have been kept for the beginning of the second movie.
 - The second is the final battle. It lacks (in my opinion) the intensity shown during the scene in Bagghar. Therefore, you end the movie on a smaller note than what you would expect, and therefore a bit disapointment

Apart from these points, there is no deception.
If you are a kid, you will enjoy all of the adventures and the insults Capitain Haddock is yelling.
If you are a young adult, you will be fascinating by the visual quality of this movie.
If you are an older adult, you will appreciate this kid movie (because it is a kid movie) without the bad humour so many animation movies are showing these time.. And the hero is actually a human, not a snail or a car, yay!",1374105600,,2889,4.6328125
5001535,5,B006L4ZEDW,"I love Tintin and it reminds me of my youth actually, when I was reading all his adventures in cartoons. I used to listen to the radio movie as well at some point. Ah!!! the new generation will never understand this :-)

I reluctantly sat down to see it with him, and it took a solid 3 seconds for me to be impressed. We had a blast! Fantastic computer animation - the best I've seen yet. Great adventure, and very close to the original story lines, or so my son told me. A bit on the violent side for the younger set, but for older kids (and adults) it was fun from beginning to end.",1372982400,,457,3.872340425531915

So, you must imagine my enormous delight when, in fact, it is NOT about a weird robot, but rather one of THE most enjoyable animated films I have ever seen!

5001557,5,B006L4ZEDW,"I really truly enjoyed this movie, I wish my wife was into CGI movies.

The pacing, storyline, and visuals are just great for an all-CGI movie.  I enjoyed it much more than Polar Express.

CHILDREN: Around minute 9, a man gets machine-gun shot in the back, falls on his face, and dies; while you don't see the bullets permeating his body, it's all implied, and that is the most violent part of the movie. I don't know what age that is appropriate for.  The purpose was to clearly show how far the villian would go to get what he wants, but it may be the deciding factor to letting my children see it.

There is heavy drinking done by the sailor, but it's mostly comic relief for the storyline.  As a parent, I don't think kids even understand drunkenness and its moral/ethical implications in a movie, so I don't have a problem with that.",1372636800,,838,4.409090909090909

A friend has a new 3D Tv and 3D Blueray, so I thought I'd buy this for a Tv-warming present.  I had no idea how well-made this movie was -- the characterizations were phenomenal from Andy Sirkis as Capt. Haddock, Daniel Craig as the villain and Jamie Bell as Tin Tin.  My Gawd!  The animation was so superb and intricate--you could see droplets of water blowing away on the portholes, each hair moving in the wind, the haircut lines, the ocean waves, all of it no detail unturned.  Then there's the storyline, which was complicated and adult for a ""children's"" movie.  My friend, who grew up in the movie business (his father, aunts and uncles were film cutters in the 30's through the 60's), generally has very little truck with bad movies (he generally falls asleep through them or he's always pointing a boom shadow or a bad film match -- always ANNOYING!).  He actually stayed awake and exclaimed that the animation had to be incorporated into real-life backdrops (something akin Dick Van Dyke dancing with penguins)...but it's not-- it's all computer animation and fantastic!  The atmosphere of the movie and the adventures may make you think of Indiana Jones--but, frankly, it's so much better!  The last scene indicates a new adventure...and I sure hope Stephen Spielberg and Peter Jackson make good on that.  I. Would. So. Like. To. See. It!

Great story - true to the popular print series. Full of adventure, ""scary parts"" and outright laughs.

Great visual experience - the detail, clarity, and format add up to an experience to be enjoyed over and over.

Can't wait for the next episode!",1369267200,,357,4.819672131147541
5001625,3,B006L4ZEDW,". . . But . . . it's still a cartoon.  Sorry, but it just couldn't capture my heart.  However, I do like the humor in ""Gromit and Wallis"" cartoons.",1369267200,,147,3.8666666666666667

5001631,4,B006L4ZEDW,"The Adventures of Tintin was a movie I had not originally heard of until recently, and boy it IS a treat. Tintin is not just your average animated film. So believe me when I say this movie is well worth your time. Peter Jackson and Steven Spielberg are two of the best film makers and they do not disappoint with The Adventures of Tintin. The title character Tintin, is played by Jamie Bell; I think he did a wonderful job with his approach and the intensity he brought to the character. Daniel Craig takes a break from 007 and plays the bad guy Ivan Sakharine; he also did a marvelous job. My favorite character who brought a lot of the humor to the movie was Captain Haddock played by Andy Serkis. So to sum up my review: Tintin has: humor, adventure, action, interesting storyline, and great visuals for an animated film in my opinion. I will definitely be buying The Adventures of Tintin on blu-ray, and I am really looking forward to the upcoming sequel.

Perhaps if ALL characters had either ""cartoon"" faces, or ""real"" faces as did Tin Tin, I would of enjoyed it more. Snowy the dog, however, was well done!",1368489600,,307,4.310344827586207

5001651,1,B006L4ZEDW,"This film is Spielberg at his best and worst.  Like Speilberg's Catch Me if You Can, Tin Tin's opening title sequence is great but also the best part of the  film.  Spielberg has decided to recycle the cliches from 1930s movie serials he put to work very creatively in Indian Jones (the first one) and draw them ut in bogus 3D sequences that are pure spectacle and add nothing to the plot.  The film is well-crafted, but it is targeted to 12 year olds whose parents are supposed to enjoy, it would appear, watching their kids have their first Spielberg experience.  I am happy my 12 year old son liked it.  I took a nap through most of it.",1368144000,7,639,4.3277310924369745

5001662,4,B006L4ZEDW,"I admit I knew nothing of this movie when I decided to watch it. I thought ""Tin Tin"" was a play on ""Rin Tin Tin"" - the name of the dog. Actually, Tin Tin is the young man and Snowy is the dog. I have to say I was impressed by this film. I remember when the movie trailers came out for this and I didn't think it would do well because the animation looks almost real...and humans don't like looking at characters that are close to being real humans ( but are not real humans) : it's creepy. Nevertheless, I quickly got beyond that and I found myself gasping and laughing and just overall amazed at this film.",1367625600,,607,4.109243697478991

5001670,4,B006L4ZEDW,This was better than I thought it would be. Good story and amazing animation. Calling it animation is not quite accurate since at times I thought is was live action. Thats how visually impressive it was. A wonder to behold in hi-Def. My whole family loved it especially my 9 year old son who watches it over and over again. Highly recommended!!!,1367366400,,345,4.580645161290323

5001673,5,B006L4ZEDW,"This isn't a review of the movie just its contents. this bluray dvd combo has an ultra violet copy for those who like to use flixster for viewing on the go. i actually like ultra violet, being able to use flixster as a medium to view your movies on the go, as well as being able to download said movie for offline viewing on up to 5 different devices is ingenious.
the movie comes in both french and spanish audio options as well as subtitles. now if your wondering about extras, your in luck. theres everything from talks with Steven speilburg to behind the scenes features about using live actors for the motion capture software, to how they built a set to house all the action for the entire movie. hint, its only the size of a basketball court. there are i believe around 9 or so featurettes on this bluray which i love. always love seeing the behind the scenes things on what makes a movie like this come to life.

Andy Serkus (Yes he's the voice of Gollum) was spot on as the hard drinking captain. And Daniel Craig made a convincing villain with is voicing of the antagonist Saccharin. Of course Tintin and Snowy are the stars of the show and I was surprised how much I cared about them and their quest, having very little regard for their comic strip counterparts.

There is something called the uncanny divide, where animation that approaches reality is better, until at a certain point it is so close to life-like, without being life-like, that it looks all wrong.

There are moments where the CGI is so lifelike that it is hard to suspend disbelief on some of the physics required to carry out the action.

I got myself doing something else In the middle of the movie. Too boring!!!!",1363737600,,151,4.241379310344827
5001749,2,B006L4ZEDW,"While I had heard of TinTin, I never read the comic strip and had no emotional attachment to the character. Apparently, lots of people do. However, I have a feeling that those people are not into hyperactive 3D movies with animation that is alternately super-realistic and ultra-cartoonish. (Read: older generation.) At the same time, for those of us who wouldn't know TinTin from Rin Tin Tin, the film is lacking a central character we can really latch onto.

It's kind of a shame, because as animated by Spielberg & Co. and acted by Jamie Bell, this TinTin person is kind of likeable. He's attractive, he's smart, he's almost human... and yet... there's just something off about him and his world. TinTin himself actually makes it through what's called the ""uncanny valley,"" which is a term among 3D animators. Basically, when a character falls into that area, it means that they are realistic enough to be human, but at the same time there's something inhuman about them. The human brain can't really process the contradiction, and so the character just seems weird and off-putting. This was the state of the art about five years ago.

Now, TinTin makes it through the valley and seems very real, but the problem is that I'm not really sure how old he's supposed to be. Visually, he really looks like an adolescent, with his flawless skin and short pants, and Bell's youthful voice adds to that illusion. When we first meet him, he also takes immediate interest in a model ship at a flea market stand -- something which seems like a teen boy interest, not an adult one. And yet... TinTin is apparently a famous journalist who has his own (rather posh) apartment.

Again, if I were familiar with the comic strip, this would probably all make sense. They stopped publishing the original TinTin comics in 1976, if Wikipedia is to be believed. I think you can see the disconnect between the source material and the audience right there.

So... we have this totally autonomous but realistically animated teen boy running around on his own. Meanwhile, he's accompanied by his faithful dog Snowy. Now, while Snowy is an endearing character, he also falls sharply on the other side of the uncanny valley -- that is, way too animated looking to be realistic. And so do most of the other human characters that we meet. While it may be true to the original comic, this is where everything falls apart. Cartoonish denizens of this world would be totally acceptable if the entire film were done in old school 2D animation style, or if TinTin himself did not look so real. The two together, though, are just visually jarring, and took me right out of everything the first time that ""real-ish"" TinTin met his first cartoon-face human.

I won't even get into the plot, which rockets TinTin into his adventures, and then lets him conveniently stumble upon one clue after another way too quickly. I can feel Mr. Spielberg's love and nostalgia for the material, but he should have left it in the visual vernacular of its era. This is a perfect example of ""sometimes, the most advanced technology is not the best tool for telling the story."" The sets, lighting, physical animation and all of that is beautiful, and stunningly real when it wants to be. As a bunch of pretty pictures, the film is a knockout. However... pictures are not a story. Humans are. When a couple of your humans -- mainly the hero and villain -- look like real people, while everyone else looks like either an animation test gone wrong or the grotesque failure of a genetic experiment, empathy becomes impossible.

That said, this is probably the perfect film to stick the grandparents and kids in front of, because both of them will find something to relate to. But if you're between 6 and 60... you'll find yourself humming the scenery, wondering what TinTin really does for his money (blackmail Belgian priests?) and, while admiring Mr. Spielberg's always incredible mastery of film making, lament that he wasted it on this labor of love that never could have found an audience, because the combination of source and realization were born to be at complete odds with each other.

If only he'd gone full live-action, he might have given TinTin to a new generation. Instead, in trying to pander to both, he's satisfied neither, and dropped everything right into the middle of that uncanny valley.",1363651200,2,4353,4.788282290279628

The rendering of light and shadow and texture allowed me to forgive any reservations I may have with the uncanny valley of today's motion capture technology.

It's Indiana Jones in CG with one of the most dizzying chase sequences I've ever seen, taking full advantage of CG.",1363305600,,423,4.888888888888889

5001770,5,B006L4ZEDW,"Surprised by the journey and calling back memories of ""Indiana Jones,"" this was a fun movie for our family (ages 9-15) to watch.

Beginning in a public market, a young man purchases a beautiful three-mast model ship.  Immediately, he's offered a princely sum ... yet, the young investigative reporter (and his small dog) fall upon a 100 year old story of sunken Spanish treasure.

With swash-buckling sailors, freighters in open sea, an eclectic pick-pockets, and bumbling constables from Scotland Yard, this was indeed a surprise movies that slipped under the radar.

At times one wonders if the scene one is seeing is truly animation or live-action; it's that good. I believe that Tintin might actually be giving us a view of the future of motion pictures, a time when it's too expensive to shoot live action with real human beings, so everything is rendered by computer; and we only know real actors by their voices, or perhaps the visages that they lend animated characters in return for a royalty.",1363046400,,522,4.505263157894737

I wasn't sure my kids (5 y/o boy and twin b/g 3 y/os) would like it, but it has quickly become a family favorite -- right up there with Toy Story and Despicable Me.  Excellent animation and a good story (if a tad violent at times).

5001817,4,B006L4ZEDW,"The Adventures of Tintin (Steven Spielberg, 2011)

I have to admit, I was really, really expecting to not like this movie. I can count the number of Spielberg-directed efforts I'd be willing to watch again on one hand, Tintin has never really adapted all that well to the big screen (I've seen at least half a dozen attempts, none of them completely successful), Spielberg hasn't delved into the PG world for over two decades (his last PG-rated film was 1991's Hook) and Peter Jackson never has. And honest to Ritz crackers, of all the people you could have cast as Tintin... Jamie freakin' Bell? Billy Elliott, for pete's sake? Why does this kid even have a career after Jumper?

And yet, somehow, I am amazed to tell you, it all works. I'll put it this way: my fifteen-month-old son barely has the attention span to watch a ten-minute episode of Moomins or Curious George, but I put The Adventures of Tintin on this morning and he sat in his high chair riveted to the screen the entire movie. And you know what? So was I, well without the high chair. Everything that should have been irredeemably wrong about this movie somehow works.

If you're familiar with Herg&eacute;'s series of Tintin comics, The Adventures of Tintin is a (loose) adaptation of The Secret of the Unicorn, with a very abbreviated version of Red Rackham's Treasure in the last fifteen minutes. If you're not, the plot: Tintin (Bell) is an award-winning Belgian reporter between the World Wars. He and his faithful dog Snowy are wandering aimlessly through a flea market one afternoon when they chance upon a beautiful triple-masted model ship. Tintin buys it for a pound and is immediately accosted by two men in succession who want to buy it from him for dozens of times more than he paid for it. Obviously, there's something special about this ship. After Snowy accidentally knocks the ship over, Tintin finds a miniature scroll hidden in the mainmastand soon finds that Professor Sakharine (Craig. Daniel Craig.), one of the men who had attempted to buy the ship from him earlier in the day, has an exact replica. With, presumably, another scroll. Thus begins a globetrotting game of cat and mouse, as the two attempt to wrest each other's scrolls away.

Now, I'm one of those people who thinks that this motion-capture form of animation that's gotten so big recently is just downright creepy-looking, which was another thing the movie had against it in my head before I started, but ten minutes in I had almost forgotten I wasn't watching a live-action film (save Snowy, who's always pretty obviously a CGI creation). The characters are expressive and just shy of realistic, almost all of them very well-voicedand delivering great lines thanks partly to Herg&eacute; and partly to screenwriting team Steven Moffat (Coupling) and Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead), who are obviously familiar with the series and inserted references to a number of other Tintin adventures (The Crab with the Golden Claws, Explorers on the Moon, The Land of Black Gold, and many more). Spielberg has always been good at action sequences (and that handful of his films I'd be willing to watch again all turn on distinctive ones1941, Duel, Saving Private Ryan), and he delivers some solid ones here, especially in the film's climax. This is excellent stuff all around. It would have been very nice to see them draw it out another twenty minutes or so and work in at least a little more of the actual Red Rackham's Treasure storyline, but you can't have everything. ****",1362096000,,3524,4.829470198675497

5001833,5,B006L4ZEDW,"I picked this movie on a whim - I like adventure stories, I like animation, and most things with Steven Spielberg's and Peter Jackson's names attached are good. So here we go.

Both my boyfriend and I really enjoyed the movie. The animation was unlike any we had really seen before - much more detailed than other animation. Unfamiliar with the Tintin story, we didn't quite know what to expect. I love the humor paired with the action, and even if some of the action sequences were unrealistic at times, that's okay because it was a cartoon. The character development was great and definitely had you rooting for the characters at the end.

5001849,5,B006L4ZEDW,"My introduction to the Tintin adventures was back in the 1960s when my father brought me back a copy of the Golden Press edition of ""Explorers on the Moon"" when he returned from a trip. Being very much a space fan I was thrilled and reread the book many times. ""Explorers"" was probably not the most representative Tintin adventure given the locale but it did have all the hallmarks of the Tintin adventures - great plotting, great characters, and wonderful touches of humor.

I am pleased to report that the film version has all these hallmarks as well. After hundreds of reviews there is not much I can add but a few impressions.

1. The feel of this film was exactly right. There was no attempt to bring it up to date and introduce 21st century technology, social issues, political concerns, strong female characters or the like. The setting looked just like its comic strip inspiration - the world of the 1930s.

2. The animation was unbelievably realistic. If not for the cartoonish features of most of the characters one could almost think it was live action in places. One wonders how long it will be before there is no way to tell the difference.

3. The action sequences were, as one might expect, well beyond what was depicted in the comics. This usually worked well (the crane fight was superb) but occasionally was over the top (the chase sequence in the North African city, and the sea battle between the Unicorn and the other ship where the latter goes over the former and both are afire). This was one area where modern sensibilities did intrude.

4. The humor hit just the right note. Thomson and Thompson were great! Snowy was also well done. I regretted not seeing my favorite from ""Explorers on the Moon"", Professor Calculus, but those are the breaks.

All in all, highly recommended. I worry that this film will be too dated looking to appeal to children but adults should definitely give it a look.",1361664000,,1918,4.64306784660767
5001850,5,B006L4ZEDW,"The same story as the original animation, but very nicely done, will open this work to a new generation  Great effects, very well illustrated and directed",1361664000,,154,4.923076923076923
5001851,5,B006L4ZEDW,my little people keep asking if we can watch again. Mom and I liked it to so its good for the whole family,1361664000,,106,3.652173913043478

5001857,4,B006L4ZEDW,"This was pretty good.  I thought some of the action went over the top of the top a few times.  I understand creative liberties, but there can be too many liberties taken.  All in all, it is a cartoon, and it was enjoyable.  Would watch another one if there was one.",1361491200,,265,4.137254901960785
5001858,5,B006L4ZEDW,"Great story, great characters and just a truly fascinating movie.  I was hesitant to see it thinking that it would be a movie just for kids, but it sucks you in and before you know it you're rooting for the character.  It was constantly moving and never stagnant, the story just kept unfolding.  I will definitely watch it again.",1361491200,,329,4.5423728813559325

5001860,5,B006L4ZEDW,"When I first saw this movie, I really didn't know that much about it and that would be because the character is more well known in Europe.  I loved the animation, the music, the story, the humor, the action, and the actors who contributed to this film.  I highly recommend it!!",1361491200,,277,4.411764705882353
5001861,4,B006L4ZEDW,"Very enjoyable movie, good for the whole family.  A little weird the way the past and present converged.  People are rarely that enmeshed in their family history.",1361491200,,162,4.962962962962963

5001866,5,B006L4ZEDW,"Steven Spielberg did a great job on this movie also, have to give them thumbs up. If you like  automated movie's directed by Steven Spielberg you will like this movie.",1361404800,,167,4.566666666666666
5001867,3,B006L4ZEDW,"The animation is so well done and it really is fun to watch, so I almost gave it a 4.  But it seemed a bit too long to me, and I was more than ready for it to end.  I'm not sure who the right audience is for a movie like this.",1361232000,,226,3.326923076923077
5001868,4,B006L4ZEDW,Fun movie - nothing special - nice escape. Enjoyed the simple story and the animation. Hope there is a sequel.,1361232000,,110,4.55

5001870,4,B006L4ZEDW,I watch this movie with my six year old grand daughter and we enjoyed it very much.  I don't know how may times she ended up watching it but it seemed like every time I turned around she was on the kindle watching The Adventures of Tintin.,1361145600,,239,4.085106382978723

5001872,5,B006L4ZEDW,From the way that the movie ended there there must be a sequel to fallow I will be waiting on the edge of my seat!,1361145600,,114,3.6

5001875,4,B006L4ZEDW,"this is classic Tintin and certainly worth watching especially since it's free with Prime. It's a cartoon but it's an adult movie with crime fighting, alcohol, guns, etc.",1361145600,,170,5.107142857142857
5001876,5,B006L4ZEDW,Very entertaining! Awesome animation! Great story! It felt as if I was watching a live action movie! If you are into animated movies you should definitely watch this one.,1361145600,,170,4.896551724137931
5001877,5,B006L4ZEDW,"It was a movie that was filled with adventure wonder and captivated my imagination, I've always been a sucker for cartoons, but it was some thing about Tin Tin's perpescuity that sold it.",1361145600,,187,4.696969696969697
5001878,3,B006L4ZEDW,Could have a better story line for such a well put together film. Animation was great but I soon got bored.,1361145600,,107,4.142857142857143
5001879,1,B006L4ZEDW,This was poor animation with caricature characters and the misleading title.  Tintin is the guy not the dog and this is not about a dog.  The dog has a very small role.,1361145600,2,168,4.21875
5001880,4,B006L4ZEDW,Cute Movie.  Sort of a cross between Sherlock Holmes and Get Smart rolled up in animation.  Suited for young adults.,1361145600,,116,4.75
5001881,4,B006L4ZEDW,Never read the comic books but googled before watching the movie.  Really enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to anyone.,1361145600,,125,4.9523809523809526

5001884,4,B006L4ZEDW,"I did not think I would like this movie ..the story reminds me when I was younger and READ every ""Hardy Boys"" books...it's a mystery and they solve it but the filming of this is unusually & beautifully done..never seen this kind of ""cartoon"" effect..and the books ,after I did some research, are very popular..so maybe a second one will come out.. that dog is some character. I really loved this movie and never thought I would...great movie for any age group..

5001885,5,B006L4ZEDW,A fantastic job of animation.  I watch this and wonder what Walt Disney would have thought.  Such a perfect balance of story and special effects.  My grandkids love it.  Every time I watch it I see things that were missed before.  It is really very very good.,1360800000,,259,4.425531914893617
5001886,5,B006L4ZEDW,I would highly recommend this movie as the story is very intriguing BUT even more amazing is the special effects. They are even FANTASTIC!,1360800000,,138,4.791666666666667
5001887,1,B006L4ZEDW,The movie was so slow and most characters are so ridiculous. This extended preview doesn't represent the movie at all!,1360800000,,118,4.95
5001888,3,B006L4ZEDW,"I came into this expecting something mindblowing and conceptually aggressive.  Instead, its follows the ""mystery solving boy"" formula pretty closely. Its pretty over-the-top at times with action that bordered upon slapstick, and I had to remind myself more than once that its an adaptation of an old comic. Still, for all that, I found it to be enjoyable. It is visually impressive and the Amazon streaming treated it well.",1360800000,,423,5.130434782608695
5001889,2,B006L4ZEDW,I feel asleep while my husband watched this one. I heard him laugh out loud several times but he said later it was not a good movie.,1360713600,,132,3.925925925925926

5001892,4,B006L4ZEDW,The plot is fun and Tintin is unique and quirky. Graphics are colorful and fluid. 1930's settings cars and planes feel like an episode of Poirot. I'm looking forward to the next episode.,1360627200,,186,4.666666666666667
5001893,5,B006L4ZEDW,"I love TinTin and have read all the comics as I was in school overseas with my family some 20 years ago. That said I already was in love with the comic well before this movie came out and enjoyed it more on my TV at home in HD than I did in the theater! I mean really, it was like I was on the ship with them and you forgot it was even animated because it was so spectacular!

As far as the film itself, action packed, adventurous and mystery always are in abundance when TinTin comes calling! Great for kids, or the big kid in you! LOVED IT!",1360627200,,542,3.9272727272727272

5001895,5,B006L4ZEDW,"Classic Steven Spielberg here! (And Peter Jackson as well!)

My son and I really enjoyed watching this film; reminded me a bit of the ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" in that it feels like a modern interpretation of the old film serials of the 30s and 40s.

The animation and attention to detail are amazing.  Lots of action, intrigue, and hidden treasure - more than enough to inspire the imagination of young adventurers everywhere!  This one is a new classic for our family...",1360540800,,472,4.650602409638554

5001898,4,B006L4ZEDW,This is story you can enjoy with entire family. I would highly recommend. The 4 star is for somewhat predictability of the plot.,1360454400,,128,4.608695652173913
5001899,4,B006L4ZEDW,The Adventures of Tintin is a thoroughly enjoyable film.  Why should you insist my review be a certain length?  I resent that.,1360454400,,126,4.681818181818182
5001900,5,B006L4ZEDW,Very reminiscent of the old Indiana Jones movies. It was very fun to watch. The graphics are a perfect mix of realistic and cartoonish. The drunk captain is an amazing character,1360454400,,177,4.741935483870968
5001901,5,B006L4ZEDW,I really liked the story line and the animation was great. The characters were life like. Would watch it again.,1360454400,,111,4.6
5001902,2,B006L4ZEDW,"Animation was terrific--everything else left me, well, unsatisfied.  It would be a great film for kids, except that there's a lot of violence.  The plot and and characters are far too predictable for adults to enjoy . . . so who's left?  People may disagree with me and that's fine, but I didn't enjoy it very much.",1360454400,,315,4.491228070175438

5001905,4,B006L4ZEDW,"It's a animated movie, the plot is quite simple, and it's rather enjoyable. Though not quite my cup of tea. I watched the whole thing and didn't feel like I wasted my time, however if you are watching it as a grown-up movie, I would recommend something else. It's probably a great movie to watch with children.",1360454400,,310,4.456140350877193

5001908,3,B006L4ZEDW,"The animation and voice acting were great.  But both my wife and I lost interest in several parts.  Didn't really care for the stereotype drunk Russian (and no I am not Russian).  Not sure if a drunk character is really appropriate for children.
The dog was the best part.",1360454400,,272,4.510204081632653

5001924,1,B006L4ZEDW,"The film opens very nicely, with a lovely tribute to Tintin's creator, Herge, depicted as a street artist who does a portrait of Tintin at the flea market where he picks up the first model of the Unicorn. It's all downhill from there.

The plot loosely follows the ""The Secret of the Unicorn"" for a bit, but works its way into other stories from the series, and deteriorates further and further into a cliched crap blockbuster. The plots of the marvellous original books, though far-fetched, had a sort of plausibility, and didn't try to overdramatise every single detail of plot and character. The characters were basically decent, with flawed heroes and villains who tended to be credible human beings (e.g. the Bird brothers gang) who could even show repentence. The film, in contrast, seems to be trying (too hard) to do the opposite in every respect. Red Rackham's descendant shows up in a sort of bizarre rekindled good-vs-evil blood feud, and everything builds up to a (yawn) spectacular climactic battle with dock cranes.

A film, in short, which diligently erases all signs of originality in plot or character, so that we are left with the ridiculous bland, bombastic formula of any hollywood film. Keep your money in your pockets.",1360108800,7,1240,4.92822966507177

5001938,5,B006L4ZEDW,"I'm sure I'm not going to be able to make my review the bomb like some other people have with their great descriptions and all. But I wanted to tell you what I thought about the movie as someone who grew up sometimes watching the cartoon when it was popular on HBO in the 90's.

First off...if you have any doubts if this movie will do the cartoon any justice or not it does. In spades. I recall watching the cartoons of the past but eventually getting bored with them. But this movie was pretty exciting from the get go. It had me glued and waiting for them to solve the mystery of the ""scrolls"" located inside of the boats.

It's been a couple of months since I watched this movie on demand on my television so I don't really know the story anymore. But what I can tell you is that if you like movies with plenty of action and mystery then you will most likely find much to enjoy about the new Adventures of Tintin movie.

5001950,4,B006L4ZEDW,"I am a 44 yo mother.  I home with my son who has the flu.  He is almost 16.  In searching for a movie we would both be comfortable with watching I happened upon this selection.  I didn't want something that would be uncomfortable to watch with all the sexual inuendos that are so common these days, but I knew I needed to make a selection that would keep his attention.  This was a very good choice.  A bit immature for his taste he admitted, afterall he is almost 16. However, he also conveys that he found it to be captivating enough once it got rolling to keep him smiling at times and his curiosity peeked. I suspect, he enjoyed it more than he is allowing me to know.  He has an image to maintain.  I come to this conclusion because I could see him curled up with his bulldog patting her and smiling at times as he watched ""TinTin and Snowflake"" on their adventure.  This movie, although animated seems very realistic and has the tempo of ""Speed"" with Sandra Bullock, if you've ever seen that one.  I was truely impressed with the ingenuity of one predicament after another and the outcome.  Neither of us were familiar with any of ""TinTin's"" works previously.  We found it overall unexpectedly a good memory for both during a not so good sick day for him.",1358294400,,1261,4.387931034482759
5001951,5,B006L4ZEDW,"In a day and age where Hollywood seems to be taking wonderful things from my childhood and destroying them through sheer stupidity (see The Chipmunks, for instance) it's always refreshing to see someone do it right. After The Muppets were successfully brought back last fall I wondered if Tintin would be done the same justice. I was skeptical and missed this film during it's theatrical run. After deciding to pick it up on Blu-Ray I can wholeheartedly say that The Adventures of Tintin didn't disappointment and took me back to those summer days of watching the old cartoon series.

For starters, the performances and direction in this film are stellar. The voice work of Jamie Bell, Andy Serkis, and Daniel Craig are excellent and they give breath and life to these characters. They've believable and instantly connect with you as soon as they appear on screen. The motion capture is perfect and the voices flawlessly match up with the action in every sequence. Though it's computer animated and the situations themselves are somewhat unbelievable, there's still a sense of verisimilitude that draws you in and makes the world these characters inhabit a bit more personal and realistic. The story moves quickly and I was amazed at how much time flew when watching this film. It clocks in at an hour and forty-six minutes, yet it feels much shorter because of the pacing. Sometimes that kind of quick pacing and constant jumping around can hurt a film but in the case of Tintin it works in the film's favor. From the opening street chase to a battle aboard a ship to a thrilling motorcycle chase, every scene flows together and each one feels tight and necessary.

Having John Williams do the soundtrack was a great idea and it's another solid score from the man whose music perfectly incapsulates adventure and intrigue. The fact that Peter Jackson produced and Steven Spielberg directed makes for a perfect duo and I can't imagine another other team being able to pull this kind of project off. Their enthusiasm and passion for the genre and source material is evident in every frame. It's great to see a film that families can enjoy together. Don't get me wrong, I love dark and gritty films, but sometimes it's just refreshing to see a movie that relies on great characters, an engaging story, and fun set pieces in place of artsy styles, violence, and f-bombs.

The Adventures of a Tintin is a breath of fresh air and the news that a sequel is in the works has me excited. This is a film that warrants not just its own sequel but it's own franchise. The comics leave plenty of material to draw from and Tintin is a great character that has room to grow. This film made me smile and brought me back to my childhood. It's upbeat, fun, beautiful to look at, and safe enough for kids while being smart enough for adults. This is one I enjoy returning to again and again.",1358208000,,2873,4.685148514851485
5001952,5,B006L4ZEDW,"I had no experience with Tintin until this movie and found it simple, wholesome, and enjoyable. It was a great ""lay back and unwind"" movie for me and I was very happy to find it ""family-friendly"" but not childish.",1358208000,,213,4.487179487179487

5001956,2,B006L4ZEDW,"I grew up with Tintin. I've read all the books so many times that I can't count them.

Spielberg took so many liberties with the characters and the story that this movie does not make any sense for whoever knows Tintin books (and the TV series which I really like).

He borrowed parts of multiple books and rewrote everything to try and make something coherent. To anybody who has any knowledge of Tintin, it's pure heresy! Things that you assumed happened in the past are now in the future, and vice-versa, etc, etc. Imagine taking The Hobbit and the 3 Lords of the Rings plus other books and mixing them together to form a new story without any consideration for the timeline, borrowing bits and pieces from each book and just making one single story.

If you're not really into Tintin and want to learn more, I would rather advise to watch the TV series.

If you really don't care - it's not a bad movie. It's well done and the intro is really cool.

Me - I could not finish it - too much rewriting there...",1357948800,3,1010,4.379679144385027

5001961,5,B006L4ZEDW,I only faintly remember the Tintin comics from my youth. I never had any but a friend I had when I was 5 did. After watching this I feel compelled to track down all those comics and collect them. In a sense I can see where this type of fiction from the WWII era led to the Indiana Jones type of adventure story.,1357603200,,311,3.9523809523809526
5001962,5,B006L4ZEDW,"I love this movie. The plot is great fun. The art work is out of this world exceptional. The characters are drawn well but seem to be more cartoony than the backgrounds, which is my only minor objection to this overall wonderful production.",1357603200,,240,4.604651162790698
5001963,3,B006L4ZEDW,"Steven and I are the same age, so I was surprised when he said that -- though he'd taken French in high school -- he'd never heard of TinTin until 1981. I took Spanish, but often saw the TinTin (and Asterix) comics used in French classes laying around.

Though this film appears to be reasonably faithful to the original, TinTin (who was obviously created as a contemporary hero for boys) just doesn't work well as a film. There are many problems translating a fundamentally unbelievable cartoon character to a fundamentally realistic medium (film), and ""TinTin"" suffers from many of them. *

Though TinTin acts like an adult, he looks like a short boy who's barely halfway through adolescence. And he carries a semi-automatic pistol, which -- though obviously needed for protection -- is discomfiting. The stories -- mostly mysteries and adventures -- have little, if any, real drama (strong/important human interactions). (I'm assuming here; I haven't read the books. Tom McCarthy, a TinTin expert, would likely vigorously disagree.) There is little that would appeal to adult sensibilities. I really don't /care/ about TinTin, one way or the other.

Spielberg said that he didn't want ""TinTin"" to look like ""Indiana Jones"" and, unfortunately, it doesn't. All the Indiana Jones films are, at some level, people stories with something more-important at stake than simply recovering an artifact. ** But in ""TinTin"", finding a treasure to line one's pocket is the raison d'etre of the adventure.

The character design is terrible. TinTin becomes a believable human, but most of the other characters have their noses inflated to outrageous proportion, as if they were descended from Cyrano by way of Malden.

Perhaps the worst thing about ""TinTin"" is that Steven Spielberg has succumbed to making a film that is nothing but action. Such films (eg, ""The Mummy"", ""Clash of the Titans"") are boring, because action sequences work best when they're separated by quiet moments -- especially ones with real emotion (or its filmic simulacrum). You can't ramp up the tension before you've let it fall back for a while. (See ""Die Walkure"", Act 1.)

As for John Williams' score... The title music is lively and unexpected jazz, but the rest of it is the same old same-old.

It's diffcult to recommend ""TinTin"" as a film you're likely to want to watch more than once. But there is one laugh-out-loud visual joke (just one, unfortunately) that borrows from another Spielberg film.

* ""TinTin"" is worth seeing for Weta's startling achievement in creating photorealistic humans. They're only a stone's throw from being able to create ""synthesbians"" (as the writer of a ""Popular Science"" article put it a decade ago).

** I recommend reading Tom McCarthy's review. I can't post a link here (Amazon will delete it), but it's footnote #81 in the Wikipedia ""TinTin"" article.

I knew I recognized him from somewhere, and then looked up Simon Pegg to refresh my memory, I clicked on the Shaun of the Dead trailer, and BAM! TINTIN!

It loses a star in my rating because the 3D version was lacking.
Nothing that really jumped out at me. After a short while of waiting for something special in the 3D, I just took off the glasses and put in the regular Blu-ray disc.
After that I could see that the 3D was adding a bit of depth to the film, but it wasn't worth it.
Wearing an extra pair of glasses to watch the film wasn't worth it, and it was just making me tired.

Finished the movie without 3D and I was perfectly content. Well, content to finish the movie without 3D, not content in the fact that I was disappointed with what the 3D version was bringing to the table.

The story follows young reporter Tin Tin and his dog milou (yes that's his name not snowy), and captain Archivald Haddock in their adventure to discover the misteries behind the unicorn a ship long lost in the deep seas.

has promised in the extras to make other movies based on this comic character and I really
look forward to seeing them. I think children of all ages could watch it, but there is violence

I do however warn you if you are a Tintin fan, this movie chops everything up for you but without ruining the fun, it does not follow the story completely but it is close enough, worth a watch.",1354320000,,502,3.9702970297029703

This movie would make a great Christmas gift for any age by the way!  This movie really took me by surprise as you can tell, but really it is one worth having!

I actually wasn't too interested in another animated movie, but for the kids I will make a sacrifice.  I am so glad I did.  The movie reminded me of a Nancy Drew for boys.  I guess that would mean Hardy Boys right?  But I wouldn't know since I have never read a Hardy Boys book.  There is a lot of mystery, action and suspense which will keep you on the edge of your seat and at attention the entire time.  And although I say it is a Nancy Drew for boys, this movie would appeal to any age boy or girl.  I was just really impressed with the story line, and the awesome degree of animation that makes the characters and scenery come alive as if it were real!

Give it a try.  What do you have to lose? If you don't like it turn it off, but you will be in for a treat if you happen to stick around and watch it to the end.

This movie does have the bad guys trying to get what they want, and the young boy making daring leaps at the top of buildings.  Things that wouldn't ever happen in real life, but it is all done in a way that still makes this a wonderful family movie for years to come.  You just don't get good clean movies like this to come along very often.

5002073,4,B006L4ZEDW,"Tin Tin(released Dec/11)is a brilliant animated feature directed by Steven Spielberg. The look and feel are totally life like;although the characters themselves are slightly exaggerated so one doesn't forget that this is just animation,when circumstances on screen get too""real"" or not. Herge's creation has been around for years,being Belgian born and raised,and first hitting the media in the late 20s. Now Spielberg and company have gotten control of Herge's creation and come up with this new animated movie,full of excitement,comedy and adventure. And I believe Tin Tin is in good hands here.
The plot involves Tin Tin,a Thin Man/Indiana Jones combo young man,and his faithful wire haired terrier Snowflake. He acquires a model ship at a flea market and from there his troubles start. It seems other agents want that ship too. It contains a scroll in one of the masts,one of three,that someone needs to complete a bigger puzzle,leading to a kings ransom.
Tin Tin is captured and taken on board a ship. He meets up with Capt. Haddock,a drunk whose ship Tin Tin's captors have taken control of. When they reach land in Morocco they find another model ship owned by a Shiek and it is then Capt. Haddock relates the tale of his ancestor who captained the original ship the models are based on. It was his ancestor who had to purposely scuttle his own ship and only he and his descendants know the exact location of the treasure,everyone now seeks.
The rest of the film is taken up trying to outwit and survive the onslaughts of those that would seek the treasure and kill Tin Tin,Snowy and Capt. Haddock. Will the adventuresome trio succeed?
There is no doubt the ending was as spectacular as the events leading up to it. The sense of humour and twists and turns never abate throughout the film,which leaves you sitting on the edge of your seat awaiting what will happen next. It is not too many animated films that can generate this kind of excitement and interest,but this one does in spades. The only drawback I found was with the length and intricacy of the plot. While it may be fine for the older set,the younger ones tend to squirm in their seats. I know,having taken my grandchildren to its premiere and sitting in an audience full of children.
Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp and in a 1:85:1 w/s a/r. Extras include featurettes on the making of Tin Tin and one on Snowy.
All in all a highly recommended film for the whole family,filled with lots of exciting adventures and humour which will keep you on the edge of your seats from beginning to end. The length and plot twists and turns will have your younger ones turning into squirmers. Listen for the voice talents of Daniel Craig,Nick Frost,Simon Pegg,Andy Serkis,among many others.",1347926400,,2762,4.804621848739496

5002078,4,B006L4ZEDW,"Based on the popular comic book series, ""The Adventures of Tintin"" follows the young man named Tintin and his dog Snowy who after Tintin purchases a model ship gets thrust into a plot that involves ancient scrolls and a lost ship that holds something very valuable and there are some that would kill to have it. This story is presented with some breathtaking computer graphics that truly advance motion capture technology to new heights, the characters look real, the action scenes are well done and the whole presentation is quite good.

The only real faults may be the story is a tad basic and thus this movie relies on more action than anything else, there is some good humor throughout though thankfully. Director Steven Speilberg does heavily make up for the abysmal ""Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" and the remake of ""War of the Worlds"" with this breezy and fun movie. Its not really for small kids as there is some violence and bloodshed, the cast is also very fitting with voices provided by Jamie Bell, Andy Serkis, Daniel Craig, Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Toby Jones and others.

5002085,5,B006L4ZEDW,"Although created by the Belgian Georges Remi alias Herg, Tintin has been adopted by France as one of its national heroes and figureheads, along with Asterix the Gaul and... Lucky Luke the cowboy and bounty-hunter, ""the man who shoots faster than his shadow"". President De Gaulle once said that he was the second most famous Frenchman after Tintin, and Tintin is very much part of every Frenchman's culture, old or young, an equivalent maybe of the Marvel and DC superheroes for Americans. In fact I think Tintin may be even more a part of French culture than the superheroes to American culture, because it is part not only of popular culture but also of high-browed culture: intellectuals, university professors or a President de la Rpublique can (and should) profess to be Tintin nuts with no shame (one of the favorite games is to mention as many possible of Capitaine Haddock's insults - dictionaries have been written on that). A term has even been coined for us: ""Tintinophiles"". Everybody's a Tintinophile in France, except some foreigners. There once was a weekly comics magazine in France named after Tintin (that's where the new Herg stories were first published, in two-page instalments if I recall), whose slogan was ""the magazine for the youths from 7 to 77"". Well, now, based on my own experience with my kids and the increase in life expectancy, make it ""5 to 105"". Maybe my parents' generation wasn't as infatuated with Tintin as mine, because comics were still then suspiciously regarded as a subculture for kids, but I see with my own kids that Tintin still ""works"" on their generation as it did with mine. And it is not just nostalgia for one's childhood. Reading again all those Tintin albums to my kids, sure, the earlier ones chronologically can be embarrassingly naive and sometimes even irritatingly dumb - Tintin in Congo, Tintin in America (but this one has this breathtaking page, just one page, where you see the native Indians chased by the army from their reservation after oil has been discovered, and a modern skyscraping city built in a day - America summarized in one page), Cigars of the Pharaoh, The Blue Lotus. There are still some nave twists of scenario in The Broken Ear, the Crab with the Golden Claws and The Shooting Star that liken them to kids literature, but with The Black Island and King Ottokar's Scepter the stories are so masterfully conceived not just in drawing but in script also that they liken Herg to a great movie director, for young AND old - like Spielberg. And all the others, from The Secret of the Unicorn to Flight 714 to Sidney, are true masterpieces. I hadn't liked the latter so much when it first came out at the end of the 1960s. Re-reading it now, I think it is one of the best (among many ""best ones"").

So, given the importance and prevalence of Tintin in French culture, and knowing what the cinema usually does with pre-existing literature it adapts - betray it - the Spielberg-Herg encounter was an affair fraught with risk, at least for those steeped in the Tintin culture, which is probably not the case of most American viewers. In fact (and I may be here a minority opinion among French high-browed culturists) I think the film is great, because it realizes a great transmission of the relay baton between the universe of Herg and the universe of Spielberg, the world of comics and that of film.

First, there is the decision to use motion capture technique, and I think the visual result perfectly symbolizes that bridging between comics and film, with an image too artificial and slick to be ""real"" motion picture, but too ""real"" to be animation. Second, the film's very beginning explicitly and wittingly stages that transmission between Herg and Spielberg. You are, as in the album The Secret of the Unicorn, at the Brussels flea market (I don't think the city is designated, but if you have a little Tintin culture, you know), but unlike the album it starts with a street draftsman doing a portrait of Tintin. And the penciled portrait furiously resembles the Tintin of the comics. The draftsman speaks with an unmistakable Belgian accent, and when the film shows his face: it is Herg, and he says (I'm mentioning the line from memory here), ""hey, something gives me the impression that I've drawn you many times already"". Isn't that clever.

In fact, everything is clever about the adaptation. Very clever is the conflation of two Tintin albums, The Secret of the Unicorn (Part I of Red Rackham's Treasure, which centers around Captain Haddock) and the Crab with The Golden Claws, which stages the first appearance in the Tintin series of Captain Haddock, and the transitions between both stories are brilliantly and seamlessly managed. (Incidentally everybody comments that the script also draws on Red Rackham's Treasure,the sequel of The Secret of the Unicorn, but in fact it hardly does, see below). VERY clever is to have turned what is a secondary character in the album, the collector Sakharin, into a very descendant of Red Rackham (and indeed there is a physical similarity between the two, of which Herg failed to do anything - or maybe he meant it as a red herring, a false trail), the pendant of Captain Haddock with his ancestor Franois de Haddocque. Some critics (and some of my Tintinophile friends) have taken exception with the final battle of cranes between Haddock and Sakharin, finding it too much Hollywood action blockbuster and not enough Tintin. I think they are entirely wrong and that there is something they didn't catch: that the battle of cranes between the two scions is the pendant and modern transcription in today's technology of the battle of sabers that opposed the two ancestors; it is a brilliant invention of Spielberg and his scriptwriters, and again the symbol of that passing of the relay baton between Herg and Spielberg.

My only frustration is the ending: The Secret of the Unicorn was only the introduction to the frustrated hunt for Red Rackham's Treasure, which took Tintin, Haddock and Professor Calculus (making his first apparition on that occasion, but sadly absent from the film) all the way to the Caribbean, and a great illustration of the dictum that one doesn't need to search the hidden treasures at the world's end when they are in one's garden. In the film, because obviously Spielberg wanted it to end on a closed- rather than an open-ending, there is no ""false track"" and the ending feels very abrupt.

And then, other than all these clever twists of script-writing, there is the magnificent art of Spielberg the film-maker. I haven't always been enthusiastic with Spielberg's film-making, finding it a little too block-bustering and aimed at the wider public to allow for as much subtlety and shadows as I would have liked. But here, I find the visual imagination grandiose. The way a Sahara sand dune morphs into a 17th-century galleon on a stormy sea is a breathtaking visual moment.",1346630400,,6932,4.851351351351352

5002095,5,B006L4ZEDW,"This review is based on having watched the film at home on Blu-ray with my family.

Although I was never a huge fan of the comics as a child, I remember every Saturday morning watching the TV cartoon adventures, divided into short episodes which always seemed to finish with Tintin and his friends apparently about to get shot, blown up, or drowned, only to miraculously escape at the start of the next episode. Whenever I think about Tintin I can still hear the ridiculously overdramatised narrator's voice from forty years ago, asking whehter our heroes will meet some dreadful fate and telling the listener to find out next week on ""Herge's Adventures of Tintin!""

In a nice touch, this superb example of modern animation starts with a nod to the original comics and TV cartoons as Tintin, whose face is at first out of shot, is walking in the market and a street artist offers to draw a cartoon of him. We see first the cartoon, which looks just like the Herge cartoons, and then the modern animation of Tintin as it is handed to him.

This film is apparently based on three of the favourite Tintin stories: ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Secret-of-the-Unicorn-Adventures-of-Tintin/dp/1405262397/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Secret of the Unicorn (Adventures of Tintin)</a>,"" ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Red-Rackham-s-Treasure-Adventures-of-Tintin/dp/1405262400/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Red Rackham's Treasure (Adventures of Tintin)</a>,"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Crab-with-the-Golden-Claws-Adventures-of-Tintin/dp/1405208082/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Crab with the Golden Claws (Adventures of Tintin)</a>.""

It features the indomitable boy reporter, his dog snowy, Captain Haddock, and the bumbling policemen Thompson and Thomson.

Just like the original this film is preposterous but highly entertaining escapist fantasy and was both amusing and exciting: both Tintin and the bad guys regularly achieve the impossible, but it is very easy to suspend disbelief while you're watching the film and just enjoy it.

Quality of the animation was very high indeed and in places you could almost have been watching something real.

A very high-powered voice cast brought out the voices beautifully and sounded very like the original TV series.

The problem is, so much time was spent on the look of the movie, the story line ended up getting the short end of the stick. So much was crowded into each sequence that the film ended up seeming like a series of loosely connected vignettes. The producers should have opted to make two films, with the last three sequences being a separate sequel.

I will say, apparently this movie is based upon a book series, which I have not read. So I can't compare it to the books.
The story follows a young reporter on his quest to uncover the story behind what happened on a ship, starting with his purchase of a model ship of the same name at a street market. And his adventure begins, with his faithful dog as companion/side-kick.
First, the animation is incredible, the eyes, the hands, the hair, clouds, relfection in the water, action sequences, etc. In fact, the animation is so good, you can hardly tell at times it is animated, which is amazing. The directing is incredible as well, particularly with the action sequences.
Where this movie fell short for me, is in the story department. I simply was not capitvated by Tin Tin, or his adventure, and I should have been. Present me with a ""hero"", reluctant is better, present him with a challenge or obstacle, and proceed to kick his butt, while I spend my time rooting for him to win and come out on top.
Obviously, this movie had quite a budget for animation. But it lacked the same attention, focus, and follow through in the story's foundation.
You can spend millions and make the most beautiful movie in the world. But if your beautiful movie doesn't have a strong story to match the awe-inspiring visuals, you've got yourself a ""dud"", in my opinion.",1342051200,2,1616,4.572413793103448
5002100,4,B006L4ZEDW,"The movie contains story from at least two different books in the original ""Adventures of Tintin"" series, ""The Crab with the Golden Claws"" and ""The Secret of the Unicorn"".
The movie itself is chock-full of action and lifelike animation.  One of the scenes can be kind of hard to follow what is happening, but it's rather funny anyway.  The very young children may find some of the action too violent and scary, but for older kids, it's fine.
I had originally been hoping that there would be more special features, like deleted scenes and outtakes; but the behind the scenes feature was interesting, to see how they made the animation.",1342051200,,634,4.754545454545455

5002117,4,B006L4ZEDW,"I recommend this motion-capture animated adventure to families who don't want their movies to be spoiled by foul language or other cultural toxins.  It's an action movie (Indiana Jones for Kids, some other reviewer said) that is an enjoyable ride, if somewhat over-the-top frenetic at times.  Especially the chase scene when they are rushing out of Morocco, is frenetic to the point of ridiculousness.  But, the motion-capture animation is incredibly realistic and makes you think sometimes that you're seeing a real film.  The characters of Tintin, Captain Haddock, Snowy and the evil Sakharine (descendent of Red Rackham) are very enjoyable to watch!  The plot line is fun, albeit unrealistic, but this is Tintin, after all!

Flaws in my opinion:  (1) over-the-top frenetic action by Spielberg is geared towards the limited attention span of today's video-playing youth; (2) there actually is a lot of violence (shooting mostly, and fist fighting), but in a cartoonish sort of way.  Being like an Indiana Jones flick you'd expect that, but for young kids, parents beware that lots of ""bad guys"" get killed.

Drinking: You know, you call it a ""kid's movie"" but the subject of drinking and sobriety is handled in a pretty adult way (in a good sense) in Tintin.  Captain Haddock is a funny drunk at first but then he gets sober and he becomes a much more admirable character.  I like this responsible attitude re drinking, or getting high in general, which many other sophomoric Hollywood films could use.

Overall though, it's enjoyable adventure and even intelligent at times! Which is more than I can say, for example, about the 2011 Three Musketeers.  In the words of Captain Haddock's worst oath, ""Blistering Blue Barnacles!""",1339545600,,1729,5.067137809187279

The television cartoon had been awful and while it was Peter Jackson and Speilberg, so I knew that the effects etc would be good, I didn't know what they'd do to the story.

He's immediately accosted by two others who also want the model, and after taking it home, it's stolen. Fortunately, before that a secret scroll falls out after Snowy accidentally knocks the boat over, breaking the main mast in which it is hidden. However, it soon becomes clear that Tintin's scroll contains only part of a set of clues. And so Tintin and Snowy are soon off to find the rest of the clues.

5002122,5,B006L4ZEDW,"I finally had the chance to watch The Adventures of TinTin with my son. It looked like a good movie when I first saw the preview and when I knew Steven Spielberg directed it, I expected a good film.

Man was I blown away by this movie!

The plot wastes no time getting into the action. Within a couple minutes we learned of the Unicorn: an old pirate ship with quite a history. TinTin purchases a model of the ship to which he immediately is approached by one man about it and then another. This ship certainly has a story behind it! The story goes 100 mph from there. From that point, there's not a moment to take a breath until the credits.

The two main characters, TinTin and Captain Haddock, are great. TinTin's intent on a story and doesn't let fear stand in his wait of getting it. Haddock is a humorous drunk. I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of interaction between the two.

The animation in this movie is fantastic. Coupled with some awesome action scenes (in particular the flashback to the battle on the Unicorn and the chase through town near the end) the movie is nothing but fun. Spielberg has done a fantastic job of using animation to his advantage to get impossible angles, camera pans, and close-ups on the action.

I highly recommend you see this movie. Have fun with it and don't take your eyes off the screen.

NOTE: I suggest 8 and up can watch this film. There are a number of gunfights, murder, and alcohol usage throughout the film. If you prefer your youngster not be exposed to this, you might want to avoid this movie.",1339027200,,1548,4.4522968197879855

5002128,5,B006L4ZEDW,"Somewhere in a European city, reporter/adventurer TinTin (voiced by Jamie Bell) just bought a model ship of a famous ship called ""The Unicorn"" yet some other person named Mr. Sakharin (Voiced and performed by Daniel Craig) wants that for a diabolical purpose. TinTin discovers that the model has a secret clue that leads to a great treasure buried somewhere years ago where he and his faithful dog Snowy get kidnapped while his 2 bumbling detective friends Thompson and Thompson (Voiced and performed by Simon Pegg and Nick Frost) are trying to solve the mystery of the wallet theif that has been going around lately. TinTin meets an alcoholic captain named Archibald Haddock (Voiced and performed by Andy Serkis) as they team up to find other clues that can lead to the treasure.

A beautifully rendered and complex yet hilarious animated adventure from Steven Spielberg and producer Peter Jackson with co-writer Edgar Wright that nicely adapts 3 TinTin comics into one movie. Since 1984 Spielberg obtained the rights for a TinTin movie but after years of waiting in 2008 he greenlighted the movie and used his friend James Cameron's Avatar technology for his movie as he decided to make a full length Motion Capture animated movie out of the beloved Herge comics. I am an American who grew up with the HBO cartoon in the early 90s as a kid and became a fan of the character as i knew someday they should do a movie on it, i saw this movie 4 times in theaters and loved it. WETA who did impressive work with Lord of the Rings, Avatar, King Kong and Rise of the Planet of the Apes has done yet another outstanding achievement this time but as a full length motion capture animated movie. This one is far better than what Robert Zemeckis attempted so far as the characters are fully realistic including no dead empty eyes but soul at last including realistic renderings on hair, skin including fuzz on skin, clothes, animals and all that as it's very impressive including using stretched chins/noses to bulb noses. The film co-stars Cary Elwes and Toby Jones, this is an outstanding achivement in animation and motion capture as it has action, laughs, fun and solid storytelling from Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson.

I'm not talking about the graphics they look great except for the fact that everyone besides the main character has an overly large nose which I really didn't like, I'm talking about the story in general.  Its starts out very interesting but loses my attention when the main character is able to overcome so many adversities so easily.  It just seemed like lazy writing to me.  If the main character had not so easily overcome his obstacles I probably would have enjoyed the movie.  Also the second lead character is rather annoying.  I don't think this movie is excellent.

In close-up scenes, every hair of the character can be seen and every hair has its own color and highlights.  This is far beyond anything Walt Disney (the cartoonist,not the company) ever dreamed possible.

With realistic videos like this today, it won't be long before new movies are made starring Humphrey Bogart or Elvis.",1338076800,,576,4.857142857142857
5002134,3,B006L4ZEDW,"Basically this is an action-adventure, animation film depiction of Herge's (belgian cartoonist) brilliant tintin comics which he did between the 30's and the 70's. It takes story lines from a number of different adventures and combines them to try and create relatively new elements to the main story of 'The Secret of the Unicorn'. Our young Journalist Tintin gets involved in an adventure that sees the bad guys trying to get hold of 2 different model tall ships as they contain parchments that reveal the secret. This results in Tintin being kidnapped, meeting his buddy-in-adventure, Captain Haddock, being stranded at sea, then in the desert and ending up in Morocco. There's also flash back sequences to stories of pirates and buccaneers that are integral to the plot. There's a lot of action on the way and some witty dialogue too but the strongest element lies in it's general mystery plot and globe trotting fun.

Tintin the comics were one of the first pieces of writing I ever loved. The adventures were so exotic and he would find himself in countless countries and environments (including the moon), fighting drug dealers and gangsters, making friends with latin revolutionaries and arab sheiks. They were stories with great mystery, suspense and sometimes the super natural thrown in. Now, I know it's difficult to translate the detail of books to film but it can be done. This film, like most, once again does not deliver this well. I mean some of the new ideas and the idea of combining different books into this one story actually works ok but what let's it down is too many 'unrealistic elements' and cheesy moments. I know this is an animation movie but Tintin is also supposed to be a 'more realistic character and subsequently so should the movie. For example, how does he go through a chase sequence where his motorbike explodes, leaving him with the front wheel and handle bars (whilst he's in mid air) which he uses to zip line (the line also appearing conveniently in front of him)? And in terms of cheese, for example, Haddock, having drunk the alcohol to use as emergency fuel, burps into the fuel tank once he's crawled outside the plane and sits on the engine. The fumes from his constant state of inebriation apparently helps fuel the plane just enough to get to land. Once the plane crashes, he then ends up in the still running blades of the plane which spins him comically (apparently) and flings him away, in a Tom and Jerry esk style. Clearly the target audience of this movie is pretty young but the tone of the rest of the film does not go with such a comic style and reduces it's enjoyment for those wanting the film to remain grounded. By all means, have comedy, but keep it witty and interesting like much of the pixar movies or one of my favourites, Rango. In recent years, Spielberg has really let the fans down because like George Lucas, he seems to favour over the top action and cheese instead of intellect and wit. Maybe if the mantle for director was handed to the pixar guys, things may have been a lot better.

As I mentioned, the animation in this is stunning and it's a great medium between real actors and the usual computer graphic animation, which I think is perfect for Tintin.  Having turned Tintin and chums British, the casting hosts a lot of talented brits that i think are perfectly cast for their roles. In addition, the script is very adventurous and fun and on the whole the dialogue is good. The first half an hour in particular is enjoyable as you get immersed into the mystery and plot. However, the mindless, uninteresting, over the top and numerous action scenes, as well as the hurried pace, certainly detract from the quality of this film and left me feeling bored and uninterested the longer the film progressed. Ultimately, the best of the movie was, in general, where the script remained more true to the comics. That's why the general plot of the movie is really exciting but let down by the hollywood factor.

Overall, think maybe viewers around 7-13 may enjoy it for the adventure and action but don't think it will hold the attention of older viewers. I would say it was still worth watching for the quality of animation and also if you're a fan of indiana jones type films but don't, at the same time, expect a great deal..you might enjoy it more that way. Old tintin fans, you're going to be annoyed but watch it anyway if you like to see Herge's golden boy brought to life.",1337990400,7,4453,4.661577608142494
5002135,5,B006L4ZEDW,"I loved this movie!  It wasn't what I expected at all.  David Spielberg has done some great stuff, but a lot of it is very strange mash-ups with weird storylines.  This story was clear and straightforward.

Yes, it was a touch frenetic, but it told an old-fashioned tale that is SO not modern movie!  There was no madman out to destroy the world, no evil corporation with military cohorts (or vice versa) - just that a blackhearted  villian has stolen a map and with his gang is trying to find a treasure.  They don't turn into skeletons and walk underwater, either.

  We watched this for ""movie night"" in a room of ten adults (no kids) and everyone loved it. Knowing Spielberg I expected a) politically correct censuring and b) obnoxious kids and c) my son kept asking when the aliens were going to come through from the sky in their spaceship.  (If fact, all the adults kept saying, ""NOW the aliens will come!"" all through the movie.)

None of that.  It really had the feel of an old-fashioned 1930's movie, despite the modern animation.  It was an excellent combination of the natural and fantasy -  I felt I could enjoy it without that strange disorientation I got from, say, ""Polar Express"".

Now, if you have kids, there was fighting and the combo of fantasy animation and reality could be intense for younger ones.  Also, if you don't like movies for your kids with guns this will probably not be the one for you.  There is a touch of blood, too  - an assassinated agent marks a newspaper with a secret message with it.  So it's really not a ""little ones"" movie.  It's not a ""G"".  But for all us adults, it was great fun, and I'd say any kid but a young kid would like it.

Great movie by the way. A lot of fun.",1336435200,,259,4.18
5002147,2,B006L4ZEDW,"I was excited about a new revamp of an exciting character. New technology that is cutting edge. New way of approaching film.
I got a dull, predictable plot that at many points made no effort to connect the story/plot point together.
It is as if they were so focuse on the technology that they assumed the story would make itself.
You are left with the feeling that the director thought, ""it's a cartoon so it doesn't need to make sense.""
And, it didn't.",1336435200,,453,4.469879518072289
5002148,5,B006L4ZEDW,"Finally, a grand movie with a great plot that brought back the excitement of watching Indiana Jones for the first time.  I sat with 9 year old son to watch this movie and we were blown away.  A great story with depth, action and humor.  It's not suppose to be realistic, the hero is suppose to be a hero, to get out of danger with creativity and luck.  We enjoyed this so much, we watched it the first time Saturday night and followed up with watching again on Sunday and it was just as fun the second time.  We can't want for a sequal!!",1336435200,,537,4.125

What I missed is the humour of the French language which can't be translated.  Captain Haddocks' jurons (if you can call them bad words) which are unique in the French litterature and Milou's reflexions about humans' strange behaviour.  On the whole if you like Tintin, Indiana Jones and of course the magic of Spielberg's movies you'll really enjoy it.",1336262400,,496,4.52808988764045

The few reviews I'd read for this film said it was good so I put it in my N'flix queue and wow, how in the world did this fail at the box office. The animation is spectacular. Reminiscent of the old Saturday matinees, it's a thrill a minute but I especially loved the fast witticisms and that Snowy, what a great pooch. This will be a classic.",1335744000,,412,4.1625

So without any prior knowledge I still felt that this was one of the themost enjoyable animated films in 2011.

You have two of the best directors of the past 30 years, two incredible young script writters and a cast for the ages. The 'Adventures of TinTin' is just a rolercoaster of excitement and pefect blend of adventure and comedy. You do not need to be a Tintin purest to enjoy this one. I just hope there are sequils because I really loved it.",1335571200,,625,4.2521008403361344

It captures the characters well but I have to admit it was a Sunday paper cartoon that I vaguely remember and seeing it didn't jog much memory. Still, I will get a chance to watch it as much as I like and perhaps I will see much more that I may have missed on the first viewing.

5002166,3,B006L4ZEDW,"Snuggling up on the couch with my little angels and watching this childish adventure film was a delight, even if there is a disconnect really between the audience and the film.  Tin Tin is a fun film and the action is here in spades, but somewhere between one action scene and the next there is a seeming emptiness that needed some sort of filling.  The basic premise is one of sheer adventure, and as such this film really works.  The brisk pacing keeps everyone on the edge of their seat and the visual effects are beautifully composed to keep us entertained.  I'm a little shocked they decided to do a stop-motion film when there is nothing here that they couldn't have shot live-action, and it may have even been more exciting in that context.  Still, the main issue with Tin Tin is that the film never breathes.  It's like everything is thrown at the viewer in a barrage of sequences, but nothing is given a moment to just relax and take any real shape.  I liked this, but I was expecting something more balanced, less stuffy.",1334793600,,1031,4.510752688172043

Tintin (Bell) meets Captain Haddock (Serkis) and together they go looking for a treasure trove.
Spielberg combines capture animation and straight cartoon along with Herge line art to bring the books to life and the result is a meticulous painting with many details that would make it a repeat watch, I definitely will watch it again.
The acting is superb, courtesy Jamie Bell as TinTin, Andy Serkis as Captain Haddock.
Spielberg bring the wildness of the Indiana Jones series to one of the most amazing chase scenes in recent times. Watch the motorcycle chase scene, but there are several scenes that will make you smile and keep you on the edge of the seat.
On the whole, TinTin is superb and Peter Jackson the producer and Spielberg the director have managed to create an entertaining film which will surely please fans and newcomers alike. 4 stars. 4/6//2012",1334361600,,1010,4.804597701149425

I like the fact that they keep it real (no talking animals or breaking into song.) It had a good story line and kept you interested in what was going on and I liked the life lesson at the end never let failure defeat you (or something like that.) I can't wait for the next movie.

I would recomend this for anyone nine years and older.",1334361600,4,473,3.9789473684210526

5002177,3,B006L4ZEDW,"I'm a huge Tintin fan!  I grew up reading the graphic novels and was really looking forward to this movie.

However, as others have said, the plot is very chaotic and hard to follow.  I don't know why they mixed together multiple books and then left a kind of lame cliffhanger ending.  This did nothing to appease existing Tintin fans and won't earn any new ones.

Of course, this is Spielberg, so the production was excellent.  I didn't find the animation style creepy at all.

But the confusing plot made this hard to watch.  I doubt there will be any further movies, and if there are, I hope they get a different writer.",1334102400,5,623,4.451327433628318

5002179,3,B006L4ZEDW,"I agree with several reviewers that this is not the best movie ever.  If you have ever read any of the Tintin comics you will immediately feel that you've seen this before.  The producer/director just animated the comics.  They did a good job of the animation but you really didn't care much about the main character(s).  By the end of the movie I was just tired and wondered why the movie had gone on for so long and the final ending was basically a ""meh"" with a shoulder shrug (a la Gru's mom in Dispicable Me).
I honestly wondered why they even made a movie out of a little known Belgian comic book about a character who is a journalist who is somwhere between 12 and 20 years old.  If so, why isn't he in school and how is he a journalist and where does he get his money?",1334102400,,775,4.174496644295302

5002182,3,B006L4ZEDW,"I was EXTREMELY impressed with the ""quasi-realistic"" computer animation style introduced and used by this movie.
For that alone, I give the movie 6+ stars.

Despite this, the movie itself lost our interest after about 30 minutes.

Instead of any real adventure story, the movie felt like one ""falling dominoes"" or ""fancy mousetrap"" scene after another strung together.
By ""falling dominoes"", I mean those scenes that are set up where ladders fall, throw a bucket in the air, dog lands in bucket, bucket floats down waterfall, etc.. etc...

Instead of telling a story, the scenes BEAUTIFULLY RENDERED AS THEY WERE, simply felt like exercises in manipulating computer animation with as crazy and looney scenes as possible.

At the end of the movie, I actually felt bad for not liking the movie more.

I mean there is TONS of hard work and talent that goes into manipulating modern computers and pixels to create such a visually impressive movie.
That deserves respect.

How many nameless ans faceless people spent late hours working on this visually impressive piece of art.
People will remember the names Spielberg and Jackson, but what about all those dozens of CGI guys behind them that REALLY did the hard work ?

As it ends up, as impressive as the computer animation was .... the movie felt lifeless and dull.

I would much prefer to see a detailed and in-depth documentary on the full process of how a movie like this is made from scratch.

I actually think such a documentary would be much more interesting than the movie itself.",1333843200,2,1535,4.850574712643678

As a long time Tintinologist, I was anxiously awaiting the movie's arrival and was not disappointed. The merging of the plots from three different Tintin graphic novels improved on the story (heresy, you say!). At first I was disappointed that Prof. Calculus was missing but he wasn't integral to this version of the story; wait until ""Prisoners of the Sun,"" Peter Jackson's contribution to the Tintin trilogy.
The biggest shame regarding this wonderful movie is how the American audiences stayed away in droves to but made garbage like ""Chipwrecked"" #1. Makes me question America's tastes in movies. Watch the blu-ray and marvel at the crispness of the picture! You see wood grain, rusting metal, the rolling oceans and characters' fleshtones, everything looking beyond photorealistic! Amazing! And the story is exciting with danger at every turn. (Tintin puts Indiana Jones to shame!) And who could resist the charms of Tintin's ""soul mate,"" Snowy?

It just trust us from one action scene to the next and then back again. I felt like I was watching young indiana jones, the scenery was the same, the music was the same and the action scenes were the same. I was actually yelling at the screen (at home) at the end of this insult to my childhood icon.

--Oh we lost the ship, but by chance we have the ships telegraph transmission codes, and here comes interpol that knows how to use these codes to track the ship, and I  and oh look again there is an airplane ready for us to catch the ship, that is apparently going back home to where the story started! --

5002188,5,B006L4ZEDW,"I got this on Blu-Ray and settled down to watch it with my kids.  We loved it and I thought it did a great job capturing the essence of the characters and the book, while also making the story approachable to newcomers who didn't know Tintin.

The movie is a mashup of several books, but the choice of storyline was excellent to serve up a self-contained adventure and introduce us to Tintin and Haddock together.  This movie packs a lot of story in a relatively short time.

The characters are well done and they resisted white-washing Haddock's alcoholism, which was certainly a big problem in the earlier books.

Last and certainly not least, full use was made of the possibilities of an animated movie.  Take for example the early scene where Snowy chases the car and goes through a herd of cows.  There is no way you could film this scene with a dog and real cows, but this is precisely where cgi animation shines - on a relatively ordinary subject matter that can't be done for real.

The chase scene at the end is perhaps a bit over the top, but... hey, it's a comic book adaptation after all.

He teams up with a ship captain also embroiled in the mystery, and together they end up traveling around the world in search of answers, pursued by others on the trail of the same mystery. On the plus side, there is a lot of action and chase scenes, an adorable and hilarious dog, and some equally humorous bumbling Interpol detectives. The animation is  compelling, in the 'real-life' style of Polar Express.

My only reservation was the gun violence, and the theme of the drunken captain - the captain needs to remember a secret handed down through his family, and at first can't remember because he drinks too much, then starts to remember only when he drinks. He struggles with his drinking throughout the film, and many of the jokes center on this, so I had to try and explain what 'drunk' and 'sober' were to my kids (ages 5-8) in order for them to follow. Also there's a lot of gun shooting in this movie, although little blood (this is in keeping with the source comics.) The plot in general was also a bit complex for them to follow, but they enjoyed the cute dog and action enough for it not to matter in terms of their enjoyment.

One of the ways we kept them interested in written French when they were living in an English speaking environment during their elementary school years was Tintin. We spent many, many hours reading the books to them. Our French-English/ dictionary for them was even Harrap's illustrated Tintin dictionary. A lot of the cleverness in the books is in the French, even though the English and German translations I have looked at are also good. I was a bit concerned about a movie created by two English-speaking guys (I still have not watched it in French, so this review is my first evaluation based on watching the English original version). I can say that when our now teen-age daughter and I watched it we were very entertained. The animation is realistic to the point of being often vaguely creepy (especially Haddock's eyes!), the over-the-top action is Tintinesque, the characters are like those in the books, and the dialog is well-written. I especially liked the way the bad guy looked like a younger Steven Spielberg, which is as it should be. It certainly is non-canonical, but it does keep to the spirit of the books. I think it may end up being a good gateway to young people watching or reading the series.",1333065600,,1282,4.8054298642533935
5002197,4,B006L4ZEDW,"I originally thought this was live action; and depending on how you define it, actors did provide motion sensor tracking for the facial images and motion but it's really a kind of animated movie, based off a french comic (I'm not sure if it was a strip converted into books or books that got converted to comic strips but it eventually got translated into english I remember seeing some of thes in the news paper comics when I was a kid.  They made several adaptations to make it work in the U.S. like renaming the dog but I don't think they detracted from the story line.

The animation (like sophisticated claymation?) was very good.

The story starts out interesting enough but kind of peters out a bit. No clever lines in this one like we have grown to expect from many other animated movies - and no chuckles. There is no ""charm"" to this story or the characters, so this may not glue you to your seat - but it was entertaining enough to watch if you're not the restless type and don't go into it with high expectations.",1332892800,8,597,4.274336283185841
5002199,4,B006L4ZEDW,"A wonderful adventure tale that should make all but the most purist of Tintin fans happy. Spielberg acquired the rights to Tintin after creator Herge's death in 1983 but a number of issues delayed the creation of this film until now. The tale is engaging and well fitted for all ages as Tintin and his allies search for a legendary treasure trove. The clue with the scrolls was nicely done and the camera angles impressed me in adding to the tale. A few of the solutions to their jams were clever and humorous, especially the one on the plane with Captain Haddock and the lose of plane fuel. The twin detectives were more amusing than expected and the villain looked a little like Spielberg to me but I think that was just coincidence, right? Spielberg directed and Peter Jackson was one of the producers. Spielberg intended this an ""Indiana Jones for kids"" and that's about right. ""Great Snakes!"" and ""Fresh Water Politicians!"" this is one you don't want to miss, people. The $135M budget grossed over $373M at the Box Office (Wiki source).

Some old aficionados might quibble over the retelling of the classic tales in a new way, but I feel that Spielberg and Jackson are faithful to Herge's vision.  They take some poetic license with the story, but the movie is amazingly close to the look and feel of the comics, with a technological update, of course.",1332806400,,437,4.45

For fans of the original Tintin books by Herge I think this movie will not disappoint.  Although the format is totally different than the original hand drawn books, showing much greater detail and more vivid color on screen, they have managed to keep true to the feel of Tintin.

Initially I was disappointed that the producers/writers took the liberty of combining elements from a couple of different Tintin books, but in the extras they do explain their thought process on making these adjustments.  I'd still prefer pure movie versions of the unadulterated Tintin books, in this same quality, but I can't complain about this product.  It is really well done and lots of fun.

The picture quality on blu-ray is dazzling; certainly better than when I saw it in the theatre in 3D.  The extras are good as well, giving an insight into the production process as well as a little bit about the background of Tintin.",1332720000,,1036,4.8522727272727275

5002203,4,B006L4ZEDW,"Tintin, a young Belgian journalist, is drawn into a web of intrigue and deception when he buys a model of a ship called the Unicorn. At least two groups take an interest in the model and Tintin finds himself shot at and his flat burgled. Sensing a possible story, Tintin pursues the mystery of the Unicorn across multiple countries and continents to its surprising and unexpected conclusion.

The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn is a motion-captured animated movie directed by Steven Spielberg and produced by Peter Jackson. An enormous amount of creative firepower has been brought to bear on bringing Belgian cartoonist Herg's characters to life. It was a bit of a gamble by Spielberg and Jackson, as the Tintin albums (graphic novels) are immensely successful worldwide but are relatively little-known in the United States. Making use of this fact, the movie was released in Europe several weeks prior to its American release, building up a good word-of-mouth that boosted the film's success in the States (and leading to a sequel being put into development).

I was a major Tintin fan as a child, collecting quite a few of the albums and watching the animated TV series. I was interested to see what Spielberg and Jackson could produce, but was also a little worried. Early trailers seemed to show an artistic style reminiscent of the 'uncanny valley'-stricken Polar Express (where the almost-human-looking characters are off-puttingly fake). Fortunately, the finished film is mostly a success, avoiding most of the pitfalls of CGI movies that try to stick too closely to realism. The animation is jaw-dropping, whether it's depicting an action-packed, one-shot motorcycle chase through a Middle-Eastern city, a battle between duelling shipyard cranes or a running gunfight on a ship at night. For the most part the characters are given animation and life, with a slightly stylised art style used that falls between realism and outright cartoons. The 'uncanny valley' issue remains in small doses, and is a particular problem with Tintin himself. Like his comic counterpart, the film's Tintin is a little on the bland side with few defining characteristics aside from his stoic heroism and determination. Luckily, his more colourful and interesting companion characters (most notably Captain Haddock, whom, as in the albums, steals most of the scenes he's in) more than make up for this lack.

As well as the successful animation, the movie is backed up by a strong, pacy script. Co-written by current Doctor Who showrunner Steven Moffat and British comedy directors Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, Scott Pilgrim) and Joe Cornish (Attack the Block), the script draws on storylines from three of the albums: The Crab with the Golden Claws, The Secret of the Unicorn and Red Rackham's Treasure (probably among the best-known and apparently the biggest-selling of the albums). The writers pack a huge amount of incident into the film's 110 minutes, but ably move between moments of characterisation, comedy and action without making the film feel too busy or short. Spielberg's direction is also impressive, particularly the aforementioned tracking shot depicting a motorcycle chase through a bustling city, which is much more successful than Spielberg's previous attempts to do long one-shots. A sequence in which Haddock recalls the adventures of his ancestor and mixes present-day shots of the desert and flashes back to a raging sea battle is also highly engaging.

Rounding off the film's success is the voice acting. Andy Serkis (best-known as Gollum from Jackson's Lord of the Rings movies) is great as Captain Haddock, imbuing him with comedy and pathos as needed. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost as Thompson and Thomson are also amusing, whilst Daniel Craig is superbly menacing as the film's primary villain, Ivan Sakharine. Jamie Bell does a good job with Tintin, but is not given a huge amount to work with.

Overall, The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn (****) is a highly successful adaptation of Herg's characters and stories. The film is funny, dramatic, exciting and fast-paced, easily Spielberg's best work in a decade and hugely outstripping the terrible Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull as a rollicking adventure movie. Where problems emerge are a few (mercifully short) sequences where uncanny valley-itis sets in and the issues of Tintin not being a terribly engaging protagonist. But with its excellent voice acting, awesome visuals and well-paced script, the movie overcomes these problems with ease. The film is available now in the UK (DVD, Blu-Ray) and USA (DVD, Blu-Ray). I highly recommend the Blu-Ray version for its superior visual quality. This is one film which really deserves to be seen in as high quality as possible.",1332633600,,4808,5.158974358974359

Now that I have seen it on pristine blu ray I am thrilled that I didn't get TinTin on iTunes. This is a movie that you need to see without all that compression on it.

I think the doggie, Snowy was our favourite character.  I absolutely recommend this movie for kids, teens and mom and dad! There was some action adventure so maybe not the little kids.

Truly, only a master director could have done this!! I last read Tintin comic books as a 10 year old kid, now watching it after few decades took me back to good old times, what a pleasure it was, I just did not want it to end.

The story flow is extremely well conjoined to make one excellent movie out of 3 comic books (The Secret of the Unicorn, Red Rackham's Treasure and The Crab with the Golden Claws). The characters are very well cast, and I wish some how ""Professor Calculus"" could have fitted into this movie, I missed him. I am glad that the director just did not lift the movie frame by frame from the comic books, instead he decided to add and subtract his own action sequences, which makes this movie brilliant, adds a newer feel and is pleasure to watch.

I did not hear any curse words, but there was shootings and stuff. Also the captain is basically a drunk. So if you have a really young one I would not get for them.

5002211,5,B006L4ZEDW,"Wow! Now this was a real adventure! Old school meets newest school - and perhaps the penultimate achievement of CGI to date.

I had so much fun screening this incredible production that it's difficult to compress into a short review. Obviously, others will likely do a plot synopsis and character breakdown, so I'll limit this to just my feelings and observations about Director Steven Speilberg.

This seems to me the pinnacle of Speilberg's visions - having finally found the one medium that can truly express his artistic endeavors, his passion for adventure and drama; of reverent history and fond remembrance. While he'll always be remembered for his live-action films, and who can forget Jaws, Saving Private Ryan, The Color Purple, etc; in my opinion it will be his magic with children's stories that will perpetuate his long-term legacy. This film should, at least in my eyes, be the grand capstone to his incredible career.

I'm so charged right now it's difficult to write! <laughing> ;-D

Suffice to say, this is what I've always believed CGI could accomplish when a competent guiding hand is on the steering wheel. This stunning film is what I suspect Zemeckis' syrupy sentimental '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Polar-Express/dp/B000Q7ZO8U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Polar Express</a>' and Cameron's infantile and ridiculously preachy '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Avatar/dp/B002VPE1B6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Avatar</a>' was attempting.

And proof that, if done correctly, computers can achieve something truly magical.

I can't wait for the next chapter! Will happily pay my admission years in advance for another Tintin Adventure.

Personal Notes:

- Loved that there were shades of both 'Indy' in the soundtrack and the use of blended scene cuts - awesome!

- Jazzed when his shooting star signature got worked into the story. <g>

- Was completely floored when I saw, for the very first time last night, that the Laurel & Hardy of our times - Nick Frost and Simon Pegg - were in the movie! Holy smokes! <laughing hard> X-D

- Have to admit at being surprised that the filmmakers utilized ""Tin-Tin"" and not the phonetically correct Belgian of ""Tahn-Tahn"". Completely understandable, but it did initially throw me off. (my thanks to The Amazing Race for that tidbit) ;-D",1332288000,,2369,5.589385474860335
5002212,5,B006L4ZEDW,"We rented TinTin and after watching with the family we had to buy it immediately! The graphics were incredible unlike some of the other 3D style animations like Polar Express.  It was so lifelike we had to remind ourselves that this was an animation.  The story line was as exciting as any adventure film with such likable characters.  TinTin is an amazing kid/man who can do anything and if you are fans of the comic this will not disappoint.

Everyone loved it- (ages 4-10 and adult) No one lost attention and the story line was exciting and easy for even the littler kids to understand.

We were also so excited to know that Peter Jackson was a producer and his WETA studio worked on it.  With his incredible work with graphics on LOTR this was no doubt going to be excellent.  Jamie Bell is also one of our favorites (Billy Elliot, Jumper - he stole the show, and Jane Eyre) and we were excited to know he was TinTin.  And Andy (Gollum) was Captain Haddock.

My only complaint is that I rented the movie at all and didn't just trust our instincts and buy it... We ordered the blu-ray/DVD/digital copy combo so we can watch it at all times.",1332201600,10,1143,4.430622009569378

5002216,5,B006L4ZEDW,"I am probably going to say this a lot but the animation on this movie was just outstanding.  I was amazed multiple times during the movie at the detail in the characters and in the backgrounds of the locations depicted in the scenes.

Tintin is a young but respected reporter who will pursue a good story until it is solved and the truth is known.  While at a city market Tintin buys a beautiful model ship named the Unicorn.  It was a real three mast freighter sailed by Captain Haddock.  It was lost at sea and as rumor has it only Captain Haddock survived an attack by pirates lead by the infamous Red Rackham.  Immediately upon buying the model two men want to buy it and pay more than Tintin just paid for it.  He profoundly says no as it is his new found treasure.  Little does he know the adventure that this ship will lead him on!

What follows is two hours of intense action in the style of Indiana Jones.  The movie is well portrayed by the CGI characters and you will get to be involved in their personalities as the animation is so good they seem real.  The mystery has villains, heroes and treasure while leading Tintin and his trusty dog Snowy into hazardous situations around the world.  Planes, ships, automobiles, and motorcycles will be used in chase scenes and battles throughout the movie.

I know virtually nothing about the Tintin saga but the never ending action will keep you on the edge of your seat.  Spielberg has done a wonderful job of making this movie and my grandson was mesmerized by the story and action. I won't go in into the storyline at all as not to provide spoilers but I took over two pages of notes on this movie.  It was entrancing to watch and enjoy.

My wife and grandson said it was 5 stars and I said 4 1/2.  I was a little lower as the action was almost too much at times, but it was still an enjoyable entertainment feature.  Your family will enjoy this movie as much as mine did and you should get it and watch it together with popcorn.

It is just spectacular. And the story moves along beautifully and it is filled with humor and high adventure and mystery and incredible direction and compelling characters. And the voice work is superb.

How this film didn't get more attention and a wider American audience is a mystery to me. I found out, however, that it did achieve amazing success overseas. I am grateful for that because I am hoping these are not the final adventures of Tintin. That would be a shame.

This is escapist adventure at its very best. During a year when the Oscars were filled with ho-hum entertainment, this one somehow was overlooked. It is an amazing piece of art and one the whole family can truly enjoy together.",1332028800,3,1020,4.538043478260869

5002222,4,B006L4ZEDW,"I'm coming at this movie not having read or seen anything else from the Tintin franchise. I admit I really only checked it out because of Peter Jackson and Steven Spielberg's involvement. I liked the film overall, but had mixed feelings.

First, the animation is incredible. The movie really blurs the line between live-action and animation. The characters all look realistic, except for their big noses. You can see the characters' pores and individual strands of hair. Moreover, the characters really look like they're acting. Every once in a while you'd see Tintin give a subtle glance full of emotion. I absolutely love the look of the film and hope more animation is done in this style.

However, I'm not sure the ultra-realistic animation style fit the style of Tintin. This particularly came out during the movie's attempts at humor and the more ""cartoonish"" moments. The animation style takes this movie outside the realm of ""cartoon"", so it just seemed odd when the movie took a cartoonish approach to humor. For example, the Captain Haddock character burping alcohol just seemed disgusting, not funny. Also, when the characters are thrown around without any regard for the laws of physics, it removes suspension of disbelief. Ultimately, I think parts of the movie were victims of the success of the animation. In retrospect, I can understand why other animated movies intentionally take an exaggerated approach.

Another problem with the movie is the plot. It's just sterile and boring. It's a routine treasure hunt, but there's nothing particularly exciting about the treasure or the villains or the plot twists. It's pretty straightforward with few genuine surprises. The characters take a long journey just to find a small pot of gold and jewels in a house. It seems like Tintin has an exciting life, but he comes off as vanilla. This movie was for Americans an introduction to Tintin and I could tell this just wasn't one of his more exciting adventures. Maybe something more along the lines of a murder investigation would have been more gripping.

Don't get me wrong - overall, I enjoyed Tintin. I think because so much of the movie is done so well, those little problems become that much more glaring. I'd definitely encourage Spielberg and Jackson to make another Tintin movie, this time with a bit more emphasis on plot.",1331942400,3,2340,4.976982097186701
5002223,5,B006L4ZEDW,"I really did not know what to expect. I am American, so I had never heard of TinTin until the release of this film.
It absolutely took my breath away.  I didn't even know what hit me until after watching it.  It is even hard for me to write about TinTin.
To be fair, I was lucky enough to watch it in the original 3D version on BluRay.  3D enhanced this movie into the stratospheres. I cannot say enough for how powerful the use of 3D is in this movie.  It makes a huge difference and I am sure increased my love for TinTin by leaps and bounds.  The 3D TinTin something to behold!!!
This is one movie I am so glad I purchased on Blu Ray. I really want to watch it again and again.  I feel I only skimmed the surface the first time through.
The plot is somewhat complex.  The characters are remarkable.  TinTin and Snowy captured from what I can see, the comic characters to a T.
It is a very fast paced action film that never ever stops for a second.  But that is how the comic book is. One thing after another.
That being said, it got under my skin.  The motion capture photography is like nothing I have ever seen before.  It is spectacular. The colors are cinematic wonders.  Spielberg outdid himself. I feel this is the Indiana Jones I had been told was so great. I loved this movie a thousand times more than every Indian Jones put together. But I am sure that is just me.
The animation is in a class by itself. And the movie has stuck with me in a way no movie does. I can't get it out of my mind.
I am surprised by the tepid amount of reviews for TinTin.  Maybe it is an American thing. I think in Europe where TinTin is well known it was a smash hit.
I loved it so much.  What a wonderful film!!!  I had no idea I would even like it.  I did not even have any big expectations for it once it was released here in the US.

Love them all!  So many times I have been disappointed when Hollywood takes something I love, adapts it to the big screen, and completely ruins it so that any resemblance between the movie and the original is pure coincidence.  With Spielberg and Jackson at the helm, I expected a high quality production, but what about the actual story?

This movie takes elements from three Tintin books - ""The Crab with the Golden Claws"", ""The Secret of the Unicorn"", and ""Red Rackham's Treasure"".  Most of ""The Crab..."" that's in the movie is about how Tintin and Captain Haddock met.  In ""Unicorn"", the flea market scenes actually took place AFTER Tintin and Haddock met, as Tintin had bought the model ship as a gift for his friend.  But in the movie, he bought the ship before he met Haddock.

But unless you are that much of a stickler for details, this shouldn't matter.  With the exception of these few details, the story was very true to the books and the Nelvana animated series.  What was even better was how the characters were written; I am sure Herge would have approved, as they were just as he intended them to be.  All the personality quirks of Tintin, Snowy, Captain Haddock, Thomson & Thompson, etc - all there as we remember them.  I thought they did a great job with the casting, as well.

I was afraid they'd ruin this movie by doing something dumb like bringing on a love interest for Tintin (something that never happened in the books, but Hollywood often can't leave stuff alone).  This is an adventure story, not a romance, and it was wise of Spielberg/Jackson to treat it as such.

The ending of the movie left me begging for a sequel.  I hope they do make one, and it's to the same standards as this one.  This Tintin fan loved it!",1331769600,23,1939,4.557803468208093

5002233,3,B006L4ZEDW,"I don't know if it's just me, but in all fairness, I found Tintin to be like a big, greasy burger from McDonalds. Sure it has the power to tempt you with its big lettuce and cheese and tomatoes and it's juicy patty... But even despite the yumminess of the burger, it's a dull experience overall as you've devoured nothing of actual substance.

I'll admit, for the first thirty minutes of Tintin, I was hooked. I hadn't read a single comic book, watched a single cartoon or even encounter a piece of literature that bore the name ""Tintin"" as a child, so this was all new experience to me. Unfortunately, the fun only lasted for thirty minutes. About two hours later, I left the cinema not only feeling dazed from all the 3D effects and always moving camera shots, but also wondering why they even bothered to try to make CG animated film out of something that clearly looked as if it wasn't meant to be a film.

Don't get me wrong guys. I don't mean any disrespect to Stevie S, as he is a fantastic filmmaker and has made dozens of fantastic films throughout his career. But frankly, Tintin was just... Boring.

I think the biggest problem lies in its protagonist. Tintin is a very empty character and almost a Gary Stu. Everything seems to go exactly as planned for him and he seems to have no weaknesses or defaults. I'll remind you yet again that I didn't know anything about Tintin before going in, so I'm not sure if I missed the point of anything but really... He was just a dull character, and not interesting enough to warrant an entire movie based around him.

It really is a shame because Haddock, his partner was a fun and quirky character, and kept me watching. And the spine tingling chillingness of Daniel Craig's Saccharine was just mesmerizing, gorgeous to watch even and how he played the evil character nicely. So... Couldn't the movie's own damned protagonist do anything to show he's worthy of a movie?

I also don't know of this is just me, but I could tell the writers were trying to force too many eggs into one basket. I have no idea what stories this takes inspiration from but I just feel like this was just a bunch of stories mashed together with no cohesion.

However, at least it looked pretty. At least it gave me something to look at when I wasn't trying to wrap my head around the not very interesting story, or how many of those there were. Alas, this is a film I could see myself putting on at parties as a background type thing, you know? But if I were to try and sit through the film again, I'd have a headache from it all. So I guess my review should be a 3/10... But it did look pretty, so I'll give it a 5. For one it could have been a lot worse.

Hey, for one, we could have gotten another ""Immortals"" with this one. At least we didn't. At least.",1331769600,2,2785,4.344230769230769
5002234,3,B006L4ZEDW,"Having never been exposed to the Tintin books or TV series, I approached this movie merely on its pedigree and the trailer.  Like many of Spielberg and Peter Jackson films, TINTIN is a big, action-oriented adventure, an animated Indiana Jones of sorts.
Motion performance animation is a strange experience, a cross between cartoons and real-life characters.  As expected, the production is flawless, the action scenes well-executed and the voice characterizations well chosen.  Unfortunately, the movie felt more like an assault of the senses, almost like there was too much going on and for too long.  I just expected a little more humor and less swashbuckling.  I'm sure audiences with knowledge of the source material found it more enjoyable.",1331769600,2,745,5.279661016949152

This is an absolutely wonderful movie. Very close to the spirit of Tin Tin and a film we'll watch numerous times.

5002236,5,B006L4ZEDW,"""The Adventures of Tintin"", Spielberg's adaptation of Herge's ""Red Rackham's Treasure"", is both a worthy tribute to the original stories and a fine family adventure movie in its own right.

From the viewpoint of a longtime Tintin fan, I would say that this film is far more faithful to the original works -- including the depiction of the characters' personalities. After the hatchet job done on Aragorn's personality -- turning him into an embarrassingly weak, cowardly, furtive buffoon in the Lord of the Rings movies from the forthright, fearless leader he was in the books -- I feared that Peter Jackson's involvement would result in mangling of the characterizations.

However, all of the characters retain their identifiable traits; many of the scenes from the books are reproduced very closely in the movie; and nowhere, in my opinion, is the spirit of Herge violated.

A few shortcuts are taken in the film to link up plot points that took a lot more exposition in the books, and in fact, the film blends several books together. However, without making the film 10 hours or more long, it would have been impossible to follow the plot exactly. The ""abbreviations"" are handled smoothly and preserve much of the original story in a slightly more streamlined form.

The film producers did alter several major details of the story, and this is ground that I'm less confident of giving 100% praise to. Sakharine is made the descendent of Red Rackham and the owner of Marlinspike Hall, rather than the Bird Brothers in the latter case. This does make a more complete story, however, and is in my opinion

The seemingly much-loathed duel between cranes at the end is a new addition, but I fail to see what the furor is about. It is hardly ""over the top"" by the standards of either Hollywood or Herge. In the original books, we have people using crystal balls full of magic powder to attack scientists and put them into a coma-like trance that allowed them to be tortured from thousands of miles away; others rolling off a cliff in huge snowballs; rivers full of piranha-aggressive alligators; and all sorts of weird action. The only reason Herge didn't have a fight between cranes is that he didn't think of it -- it's right up the alley of a Tintin story, as far as I can see.

The one thing that bothers me a bit is Castafiore (sp.) shattering the glass with her singing. It sounds like something that might be included in a Tintin story, but on the other hand, it just sort of came out of nowhere. She showed up for no very good reason, broke the glass, and vanished from the scene. Still, it's a minor hiccup at best, not anything catastrophic.

In effect, the plot was tweaked to fit into the movie and make a more complete story than would have been shown in the limited time. But the personalities of the characters, the whole Herge atmosphere with a mix between investigation and action, and the look and feel of both the people and the scenery all capture what a Tintin movie should look like. A superb, well-crafted film that is respectful to the genius of the original while bringing it vividly to the screen. Herge would have been thrilled, in my opinion -- the movie vindicates his statement that only Spielberg could do justice to his creation.",1331683200,4,3258,4.695271453590193
5002237,3,B006L4ZEDW,"Another Oscar nominee was released this week and Steven Spielberg's first foray into motion capture technology, The Adventures of Tintin.

Featuring an all-star voice cast that includes Andy Serkis, Daniel Craig, Simon Pegg, and Nick Frost, Tintin can be compared to an earlier Spielberg franchise starring a certain treasure-hunting Archaeology professor by the name of ""Indiana,"" which could be good or bad, depending on how you look at it.

Screen adaptation has a mellowed Haddock with passion, a tintin that is too serious for an adventure, and a story that is at heart of Tintin's adventure - ruined by slapstick stunts rather than being enamored by tintin's quick wits and Haddock's silly antics.

Incredible action scenes, rich characters, exotic locations and of course a lost treasure. Andy Serkis the king of motion capture is awesome as the bumbling drunken Captain Haddock. The only reason this film isn't 5 stars is that it's overall shallowness. Not that it's a problem while your watching it, but it might just be kind of forgettable for some viewers.

Definitely a must see.",1331510400,,667,4.605042016806722
5002244,5,B006L4ZEDW,"Let me start this off by leveling with you.  I don't come at this movie from the perspective of someone who knows nothing about the franchise.  You see, I've read virtually all of the Tintin comics, though I never saw the animated series.  I know these characters and what they're all about.

Fortunately, fans of the comics won't need to suffer the disappointment of character derailment in this movie.  Every last character is spot-on.  Tintin, Snowy, Captain Haddock, Thompson & Thompson...  It's all there.  If you read and enjoyed the comics, you'll find much of what you enjoyed in this film as well.

I say ""much,"" because while a certain amount of excitement was also common in the comics, they were largely mystery-based, rather than action, and this film has very strong and almost-constant action and suspense elements to it, though its penchant for mystery, treasure-hunting and adventure remain as strong as in the comics it was based on.

However, now it's time for the fanboy in me to take a back seat and explain some of what this film is actually about for those not familiar with the character of Tintin (who, it must be admitted, is something of a niche character outside of Europe.)

Tintin, a young reporter and seeker of secrets and stories, buys a model ship in the marketplace one day, while he's out for a walk.  Immediately, two men try to buy it off him, but he doesn't sell, because he realizes something must be up with it.  A series of accidents, investigations and crimes lead him to uncover an old poem which seems to promise a great treasure to those who can unlock the secret of ""the three unicorns sailing in company.""

However, Tintin and his friends will need to fight for their lives, because another man; Saccharine is looking for the same treasure, and that's not all he's looking for.  He's willing to stop at nothing to get what he wants, even if it involves kidnapping, torture, thievery and murder.  Tintin is fast action, high adventure and a thrilling mystery all rolled into one.

Now, specifically to those who've tried to claim that Tintin rips off Indiana Jones.  It would be more likely that the reverse was true, since Tintin comics were published from 1929 to 1976, and Raiders of the Lost Ark wasn't released until 1981.  However, it's almost universally recognized that what Indy really rips off is Allan Quatermain, so I won't make that claim.  Needless to say, if you think this film is a ripoff of Indy, you're simply wrong, and that's all there is to it.

What this film is, is simply fun.  Good, clean fun with some nice action sequences and several very good chase scenes.  It's a well-done ride, and as icing on the cake, a bit of Catholic history comes up at one point during the movie.

Herge himself (the comic's author) was Catholic, and writing for a Catholic publication, which only elevates my respect for the series, as you might imagine.  It's a great series, and a very good movie as well, and I think the main reason is that Stephen Speilburg and Peter Jackson seem to have realized that they just shouldn't mess with what obviously works.  Kudos to them for understanding this, and for their faithfulness to the source material.

I recommend this movie to anyone looking for good, clean fun, or anyone who likes a nice, hair-raising adventure.  There's guns and alcohol in it, but it's all treated appropriately, I think.  I don't even think kids would have too many problems with this movie, to be honest.  I know I didn't, and I hope many other Tintin fans will get as much out of it as I did.",1331337600,6,3569,4.654952076677317
5002245,3,B006L4ZEDW,"This movie is weird!
Well for adults anyway.
 Now I freely admit I haven't read a lot of Tintin, but I always imagined him to be a boy,....oh say about 16/17 maybe.
The character as presented here is some sort of strange hybrid man/boy. He looks like a boy, (well sort of!), but has all the strength and abilities of a man,lives alone, carries and use guns frequently and is more than capable of knocking full grown huge thugs out with his fists.
It's sanitised of course, ......he shoots a lot but the direction is contrived so that you never see him actually hit anyone, ...much less kill them.

It was conflicting messages for me, but then as I mentioned above, I'm a bit of a newcomer to Tin-tin.
Positives first: It's BEAUTIFULLY drawn in most cases. Clever, ...even witty illustration in parts, specially during the wipes; and the textures and effects are visually very captivating. The water, the fire, etc. are exceptional.
I do have issues with the motion capture process used, which at times had some characters looking like a human actor's body just wearing a huge caricature mask over their head. This was most obvious on the Captain character.

Now I am one who can usually quite willingly park my brain in the foyer and suspend disbelief for the duration of a movie that creates a fantasy.
That being said, I enjoyed the beginning of this movie where it sort of stuck almost within the bounds of possibility, ...or even went just beyond.
However as it progressed, the action really ""jumps the shark""! Shark? More like leaps the leviathan!

Yes I know it's a cartoon but the extreme and constant OTT exaggerated and impossible action scenes just left me saying ""Yeah right, ...like THAT'S ever gonna happen"" after a while.
And it's kept at that frenetic level for most of the second half.
Spielburg has never been one for restraint or subtlety in any of his movies, and let's just say he doesn't go against character in this one. There's certainly no build up to an exciting action bit, then releasing of tension so that it can be built up again sort of thing. It's just full-throttle all the time. All of which has the effect of over-kill for me
I would have appreciated just a little more of a nod to the original Herg material by way of keeping it more ""boys-own-adventure"", rather than the Indiana Jones on hyper-steroids approach.
I certainly enjoyed it for the animation, ....apart from the bodies with big carnival heads I've already mentioned.

I still think Spielberg has ""aged"" Tintin too much, creating a conflict in the audience's mind between his appearance and what we see him do. Although I did notice he does NOT drink the champagne handed to him near the end. So it's apparently OK for a kid to possess guns and shoot at other people with intent to kill, but a sip of celebratory alcohol is a no-no?
As I said, ....a mental conflict.
All that said, I very much enjoyed the beginning, and the drawing, but its descent into constant OTT totally unbelievable action scenes lost even a minimal touch with reality which I think the story needed. A connection Herg was always careful to preserve, even if his stories were still largely aimed at a young boy's imagination.",1330992000,8,3195,4.66785079928952

Having watched the cartoons and read the comics, you can imagine my delight and relief, as a fan, when the film was announced as collaboration between Peter Jackson and Steven Spielberg. Why is that important? Because I had the upmost faith it would be a brilliant film and faithful to Herge's creation. Thank god, I wasn't let down! The brilliance of the film starts from the very cool opening titles with John Williams' amazing, nostalgic score, and from there it doesn't let up. Performances of all the cast was outstanding, with special shout out to Serkis as the bumbling, drunk Captain Haddock.

""The Adventures of Tintin,"" for better or worse, is a Steven Spielberg film. It is fast-paced, though some (including me) find it too fast, especially the second half of it. Anyway, it is an animation film from the director of the action-packed Indiana Jones franchise, and there is no question as to its entertainment value. This is a fun roller roaster ride, with plenty of action set-pieces.

Jamie Bell plays Tintin, and Andy Serkis, Captain Haddock. But what you see is not them, but the characters processed by motion capture (or performance capture) technology. Eight years have passed since the release of ""The Polar Express"" (in which Tom Hanks' character looked like a walking dead body), and the unnatural feeling that was often prominent is motion capture films back then is gone ... well, almost.

I for one enjoyed the new film, but I suspect this is partly because I did not expect much from the film adaptation from the beginning.

5002252,5,B006L4ZEDW,"My wife and I went to see this for different reasons; she thought that 'it looks fun'...me, I wanted to see the graphics.

She was quite correct, this is a VERY fun film, a fast-paced and enjoyable adventure with an 'Indiana Jones' flair to it.

For my part, I will state that these were the best graphics I have ever seen on the screen. The detailing is perfect, I noted that I could see characters` individual hairs being blown by breezes during scenes. The characters themselves were depicted with an almost surrealistic blend of realism mixed with exaggerated facial details that added a comic book effect while giving you an almost photographic reality in an animated world.(I`ve already pre-ordered the Blu Ray)

Now, all that was fun... here is where the 'wonder' from my title comes in...

Seeing this movie makes me wonder why Stephen Spielberg makes us wait for years upon years to see another live-action 'Indiana Jones' adventure with an ever-aging Harrison Ford ?

There could just as easily be new Indiana Jones adventures--with 'Indy' in his prime--voiced by Ford with graphics such as found here. Granted, the location fiming in the Indiana Jones movies was a vital aspect of them, but it strikes me that the character and the adventures count for a bit more (otherwise it`s just a glorified travelogue).

If the sort of 'Hyper-Reality' found in TINTIN can be created, then why not apply the tech to characters such as Indiana Jones ? I would certainly be willing to pay to see Indy in action, looking good again, in his 30`s or 40`s..back in the 30`s or 40`s... rather than wonder if Spielberg, Lucas & Ford are going to get around to making one more movie before Ford gets too far past the believability point in years for an 'action/adventure' character.

Makes me wonder....

But, I digress...Give TINTIN a try. He won`t let you down...

5002253,3,B006L4ZEDW,"Stephen Spielberg released The Adventures of Tintin nearly simultaneously with his other film, War Horse. The two are strike an interesting contrast with each other. Where War Horse plays the role of the classic Hollywood epic, Tintin serves as its hyperactive younger brother. Most in the Anglophone world are, at best, nominally familiar with the strangely coifed titular character, Tintin, but he's a pretty big deal among the Francophone part of the globe. My history with the character is modest, having only watched a short lived animated version on Nickelodeon when I was a kid. So I'm familiar with some of the characters, but I couldn't tell you how the movie stacks up to the source material. But the film itself is rather unruly, at times providing exciting action but also failing to tell a fully engaging story.

Tintin is a boy reporter (his age is somewhat ambiguous) who has a penchant for discovering vast plots that require quite a bit of globetrotting to uncover. The film opens with Tintin buying an old model ship, a replica of the lost galleon The Unicorn, at a flea market. He snatches it up mere moments before another buyer, Mr. Sakharine, arrives to pick up the ship. Tintin rebuffs any offer from Sakharine to purchase the MacGuffin, er, ship, from Tintin at a sizeable profit. Needless to say, the model ship is more than it first appears, and in fact it comprises part of a series of clues that lead to a long ago lost treasure. Sakharine doesn't take Tintin's refusal to sell kindly, ransacking the intrepid hero's apartment and eventually kidnapping him and storing him on a large steamship. The ship's captain, Captain Haddock, has been deposed by Sakharine and the mutinous crew. Tintin and Haddock team up to stop Sakharine and discover the secret behind the fate of the Unicorn and its treasure, a secret that has familial ties to Haddock himself, since it was his grandfather who captained the Unicorn before it became lost at sea.

Perhaps more so than Tintin himself, Haddock seems to be the fan favorite character. He's a bit of a drunken buffoon, and while I would imagine he wouldn't be the ideal partner for world wide adventuring, he's great fun to watch. Tintin was filmed using motion capture techniques, similar to the ones used in those Robert Zemeckis films, Beowulf and The Polar Express. This isn't my favorite kind of animation because, as others have noted, the combination of animated characters and eerily realistic movement tends to produce an uncanny valley effect. However, this technique does allow Andy Serkis to put in an enjoyably cartoonish performance in the role of Haddock. Serkis has become the go to man for motion capture performances--he's kind of a 21st century Lon Chaney--and his robust performance is a highlight of the film. He plays Haddock as a perpetually energetic man who has little control over his own drinking, downing bottles of liquor before he has a chance to even think about it. To his credit, Spielberg keeps all of the now risqu drunkard jokes, refusing to pander to his audience. And while Haddock's alcoholism is often played for laughs, he's also chastised once or twice by Tintin, even if he never gives up the drink.

Much of the film is an excuse for Spielberg to deliver one fantastic action piece after another without regard to pesky things like the laws of physics. There are some fantastic moments, including a battle between two ships during a raging storm and a crash landing in the desert. But perhaps the most thrilling part of the film is a chase through a Middle Eastern bizarre that takes place in a single, long shot. In these moments we see Spielberg eager to play with animation in ways that he can't in live action. Unfortunately, it's in the moments between the action that the movie seems unsure of itself. Like a jittery kid on a sugar rush, the movie can hardly sit still for a moment. The film is a series of action set pieces strung together with exposition as epoxy. This means that when the adventure should feel exciting, it sometimes feels exhausting. (I did see the movie in 3D, which may have only exacerbated this problem). This seems to be a problem that's worse in animated films. With the exception of Pixar, most animation studios feel the need to barrage the viewer with constant noise and unending movement, like they're shaking a pair of toy keys in front of a baby. Filmmakers need to let these films breath, to find a natural rhythm. Unfortunately, Tintin is no exception to this rule.

The director and film theorist, Sergei Eisenstein wrote extensively about the concept of dialectic, the synthesis of two seemingly opposing elements. We see this in plenty of Eisenstein's films and, strictly from the point of view of entertainment, the audience is wrenched from one emotional state to another. In his most famous film, Battleship Potemkin, Eisenstein precedes the massacre on the Odessa steps with images of celebration of the arrival of the rebellious crew of the Potemkin. The contrast between celebratory citizens and the gory images of innocents being gunned down makes the film that much more compelling. Likewise, an action film, at the very least, needs moments of calm in order to further elevate the moments of gunplay and fisticuffs. Spielberg has done wonders with this kind of contrast in other films. The famous caravan chase in Raiders of the Lost Ark, for example, comes after a grueling and atmospheric descent into the Well of Souls. It's only because we have followed Indiana Jones through a pit of snakes that we are now ready to release all that built up tension by watching him slug some Nazis. These days Spielberg almost always excels when it comes to laying out the action, but he would be well served to pay as much attention to the part of the film where bullets aren't whizzing by.",1329004800,6,5845,4.830339321357285

5002255,4,B006L4ZEDW,"Let me state upfront that I grew up in Belgium (home country of Tintin-creator Herge), and that in my youth I read all of the original Tintin comics, and they were simply amazing, taking me in my imagination to the wonderful world of Tintin's many adventures. Over the years there have been a number of attempts to bring the comics to the screen, and the cartoon series that appeared on HBO a number of years ago did a pretty great job of it, in my opinion, staying true to the origins of the Tintin comics. When I heard that none other than Steven Spielberg and Steve Jackson were planning to make a Tintin movie, I was very excited. Then I saw the trailer in the theatre last year, and I have to admit I cringed a bit. This did not feel like the ""original"" Tintin I grew up with. But I finally gave in this past weekend and went to see the movie in the theatre.

""The Adventures of Tintin"" (107 min.) is not a live action movie nor is it a cartoon, but instead somewhere in the middle, an animated movie using live actors in the filming who then get ""digitized"" for the final result. Why, oh why? As I watched the movie, as entertaining as it was at times, I kept thinking to myself it felt ""fake"". I simply do not understand why Spielberg didn't chose to make this a live action movie, as the movie feels pretty much a cross between ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""Pirates of the Carribean"". Not that the movie is bad, but it could've been so much better. The highlight of the movie is actually the opening credits, where we see the cartoon Tintin and his dog Snowy dodge a number of dangerous situations (not unlike, say, the opening cartoon credits of the Peter Sellers-era Pink Panther movies), just tremedous. The movie did do just okay but not great in the US, although it earned bunches more in overseas markets. Peter Jackson supposedly will direct the next Tintin movie (if there is one).

As an aside, the movie's plot is based on 3 Tintin books originally published in the 1940s, The Crab with the Golden Claws (1941), The Secret of the Unicorn (1943), and Red Rackham's Treasure (1944). I reread those comics the other day, and frankly, they are tons better than the movie. I bought most of the Tintin books in English for my kids when they were younger, and they loved them too.

I saw this and ""War Horse"" on the same day and could not believe they shared the same director. Tintin is ice cold, overbearing, and boring. It is closer to Spielberg's worst and most indulgent movies, ""1942"", ""Hook"" or ""Temple of Doom"", than his best fantasies, ""E.T."", ""Close Encounters"", or ""A.I."", as it should have been. All of Herge's warmth, intelligence, and fanatical attention to detail is lost here. What we have is one ""clever"" action set piece after another. Moffat's screenplay is as one-note and show-offy as his Dr Who scripts have become, at this point I'm ready for him to crawl back into the obscurity of the BBC where he came from. I really cannot think of anything to recommend this movie unless you simply want to check out the latest in mo-cap technology.

Don't get me wrong.  I loved the comic series, and thought even the television cartoons quite good.  But there was always a careless innocence to Tintin, and Hollywood isn't really good with things with careless innocence.

This is standard Spielberg entertainment.  You go, you watch it, and you find it entertaining -- but it's certainly not a movie you'll get excited over, and recommend to your friends.",1328054400,2,676,4.920353982300885

5002261,2,B006L4ZEDW,"A huge disappointment by two genuinely great directors specialized in popular entertainment, like Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson. The secret of The Unicorn was the first Tintin book I read (my parents give it to me as a present when I was 9 years old, more than thirty years ago). It is also one of my favorite Tintin books. This might be why I felt so disappointed by this. Absent from the movie is all the subtlety in the book. What is present here is a very heavy handed, video-game like approach.

In theory, this could have been a match made in heaven, as previous works by Spielberg especially (like the Indiana Jones franchise) have a strong resemblance to Tintin, in terms of plot and in terms of the epoch (the thirties and the forties were the epoch were both Tintin and Indiana have their best outings). In practice, the film doesn't work. Let's try to analyze why.

Let's first concede that Tintin is difficult to bring into the screen (previous adaptations, both animated and live-action, have failed). I think one of the reasons is that Tintin lives in a very stylized world, and this becomes quite obvious when one transplants Tintin from a drawing in a paper to a photographic medium (even in the form of computer animation).

The charming plot of the book (Tintin finds by accident a manuscript hidden inside a model ship called the Unicorn that might be a clue to a hidden treasure, and soon sees himself chased by other people interested in that treasure), has some minor changes, but those changes are generally for the worst. For instance, the slimy Bird brothers in the book were better villains than Ivan Sakharine in the film, who was not one of the bad guys in the original book. Mixed up with the plot of the Unicorn (and in a not very convincing manner), appear elements of other Tintin books, especially The Crab with the Golden Claws, another favorite of mine.

Lastly, the animation is not completely convincing: the problem of the unrealistic eyes (the so called uncanny valley, which many have pointed already in The Polar Express, and which evidently hasn't been solved) makes for a Tintin that is slightly creepy. By the way, the photography is some scenes is too dark and murky, when the Tintin books are famous for the use of bright colors and little contrast (the famous clear line style).",1327449600,8,2330,4.703431372549019
5002262,5,B006L4ZEDW,"I am a huge Tintin fan since I was 12! I used to watch the Nelvana cartoon with my family back in the 90's and I never missed one single episode of it!! Besides, that's the TV series that introduced me to the character.

Having grown up with the series, at that time I had no idea that it was inspired on a series of comics written by Belgian writer George Remi (Herg), so when Internet finally came in the late 90's I started to search for those comics, and boy, I had a hell of a thrill ride!

With that said, needless to say that I was eagerly waiting for this movie! Of course there is some other movie adaptations out there, but truth being told, they never made much justice to the supreme creation of Herg.

By the way, Herg used to say that the only person alive capable of taking his creation to the big screen was Steven Spielberg. And boy, he was 100% right!!

This first adaptation of the Tintin adventures around the world is brilliant!! More than brilliant!! It's perfect!! Seriously, the only thing more perfect than this would be if Spielberg copied the entire stories from the comics to the form of a movie. And don't get me wrong, he did keep the original story by Herg almost intact in this movie, but being the great filmmakers that he and Peter Jackson are, they decided to have a take on more than one story per movie and put those stories to work together as a whole. Did it work? Oh yeah!

In this first movie of a hopeful long series of movies (Herg made 24 Tintin stories!!) they decide to introduce us to the characters. They introduce to the Tintin rookies the main character, the reporter Tintin and his dog Milou, who are two courageous fellas who are always ready for adventure. We also manage to meet the Dupont twins on this movie, two silly and dumb police officers and Captain Haddock, the longtime friend of the main character. Even the Moulinsart Castle and the lovely Bianca Castafiore was there.

The stories chosen to this movie was ""The Crab with the Golden Claws"" (where Tintin and Haddock met for the first time), ""The Secret of the Unicorn"" and ""The Red Rackham's Treasure"", three of the most exciting stories of the Tintin collection.

The animation is fantastic, fluent and the digital sets take your breath away. The acting is superb, they got the right cast to act, Andy Serkis as Haddock is spectacular!! And that's another strong point in the movie, the characterization of almost every character on Tintin's universe was kept intact, except for Dr. Sakharin, who in the original stories was never a descendant from Red Rackham, but it was a nice addition and brought more drama and interesting developments to the script.

The humor is top notch!! I laughed out loud with the drunk jokes in the movie, in fact, I laughed out loud in the entire movie!! It was fantastic!! Being able to see all those beloved characters from my youth in the big screen exactly the way I used to know them was just great!!

As for the story, well it's the story everyone as a fan already know. It was the same story we know from the comics and the Nelvana cartoon, but told differently, so, except for the Sakharin development, there was no surprises at all for me in terms of story.

The only character I missed on the movie was Professor Tryphon Tournesol. I just love this scientist. He is deaf, but doesn't know it, so he gets everything wrong and usually causes a lot of trouble, but he have a heart of gold. I was eagerly hoping to see Prof. Tournesol on the movie with his shark submarine, but I guess I'll have to wait for the next one.

And boy, I will be eagerly waiting for the next one, the one Peter Jackson will direct. I seriously hope to see more Tintin movies from now on. I'm also really sad that the film went so bad in the USA, I guess US people didn't get the point of Tintin, but I hope they will next time.

Anyway, great movie, wonderful adaptation, I hope to see more of this, and I will finish my review by saying: Great Snakes and Blistering Barnacles!! Go for Tintin!!! You won't regret it!!",1327276800,12,4050,4.43606998654105

Spielberg thinks if there is one second of film without constant agitation and motion with big swooping camera movements, he will lose the attention of the audience. But that kind of thing actually has the opposite effect; faced with the constant barrage of meaningless, overly-choreographed action, the viewer can't help but retreat their attention, possibly into a nap. It's like watching clothes go around and around in the dryer for two hours. Some of it is like being IN the dryer, looking out through the glass door.

I also didn't like the character designs, and I don't think they would match the imaginations of any of the readers of the original brilliant comics. Even without prior knowledge of the originals for comparison, they are simply ugly and unappealing. Also, the motion capture makes many of the characters appear to be human actors outfitted with overly large grotesque heads.

Prior to seeing it I'd underestimated the movie- mistaking it for a little kid movie that probably wasn't worth going. Of course, I had no idea how awesome Tintin was until then.
All of the animation was incredible. The CGI made the movie look like real life, and a couple times I even found myself forgetting that it was animated! Good job Stephen Speildburg ;-)
After seeing Tintin, I reaserched him a bit on Wikipedia. I have to say, I was suprised at how much cool stuff like this passed right by me in the world. Not like it's the first time, but still.
I can only describe the main plot as this: take one part Indiana Jones, one part Alex Rider, and just a dash of Pirates of the Carribean, and stir until well blended.
Now, because of the movie, I'm going to read the comics, maybe watch the animated show, and get it ASAP. Tintin and I are going to have a good friendship by the time it comes out on DVD.

All in all, definitely worth the price of the tickets. Take your kids, take your kids' kids, even take your parents if you can. This movie is sure to be a hit with the family.

Just one thing that confused me: How old is Tintin? He seems pretty young, maybe 15 (he looks even younger than that to me in the comics!), but how many 15-year-olds in the 1940's had their own apartment, was a well-known reporter, and carried a gun just in case? (Correct me on my history if nessecary. I've always been bad at that subject in school :-P) Probably none, but that still made little sense to me.",1326758400,2,1615,4.257328990228013

It has everything you can ask for in a movie of this kind: Likeable heroes (Tintin, the Captain, and Snowy the dog), Snidely whiplash style moustache twirling villains, comedy relief bunglers,  and TONS of adventure and action. In one film, you will see swasbuckling swordfighting pirates, French foreign legionnaires, animal fights, wild plane rides, harrowing motorcycle chases across some really great scenery. Oh what good old fashioned rip roaring FUN! I took my nephew to see this and it was like thrilling to Flash Gordon with my dad when I was a kid all over a kid. This movie will bring the adventure loving 12 year old out in the most serious of adults and you will stand up and cheer!

Oh yeah, the ""ending"" (which I will not reveal here) will have have you yelling, ""SEQUEL!"" Guess we'll have to wait until around 2014.

5002267,5,B006L4ZEDW,"Spielberg releasing two movies in the same month? And two supremely crafted movies, at that? Ach, the flaunting of the man! Seriously, though, WAR HORSE and THE ADVENTURES OF TINTIN are both epic cinema and should be viewed, maybe several times. Here in the States, you hear the name ""Tintin"" and scratch your noggin and maybe venture a guess: ""Is a heroic dog, no?"" No. Once upon a time, Georges Prosper Remi - more popularly known in Europe as Herg, but barely known here - created THE ADVENTURES OF TINTIN, a comic strip beloved throughout the length and breadth of Europe. Spielberg is a big fan of Tintin and years ago was able to garner the rights to shoot a film adaptation. Herg passed away in 1983, but odds are - in spite of certain liberties taken (not the least of which is the visual look of Tintin himself) - he would've been proud of what Spielberg wrought. Keep an eye out for a Herg cameo during the opening sequence. He's the illustrator drawing a caricature of Tintin.

It's no coincidence that an Indiana Jones flavor suffuses the narrative (yes, I played the Indy Jones card). The comic strip often propelled Tintin into many a pulp adventure. There's an old time feel here, redolent of those Saturday serial reels, of wild cliffhangers and derring-dos. Tintin looks like a kid - especially with that upswept tuft of hair - but he is well regarded in the community, is treated like an adult. Everyone knows who he is. Tintin is a daring reporter who doesn't hesitate to go after a story. This time, Tintin senses a mystery behind a ship's model of a 17th century man-o'war, which is coveted by several shady characters. Tintin's suspicions are confirmed when he unearths a cryptic scroll hidden within the ship's mast. What happens next, you can call it investigative journalism or a headlong leap into adventure. In any case, Tintin and his clever dog, Snowy, are soon dodging bullets and up to their necks in exotic locales and embroiled in an epic treasure hunt. Apartments are ransacked. There are frequent eruptions of gunfire. Skulls are occasionally ka-bonked. Perilous chases ensue, and fisticuffs. There be even pirates... and opera singers. In one instance of skulking about - as Tintin is about to ""borrow"" a set of keys - he is given a heads up about one particular goonish sleeper in the room: ""He's a light sleeper, on account of the tragic loss of his eyelids."" I really love that line.

If you're down with the comic strip, then the plot may be familiar. It's lifted (but tweaked a bit) from three existing Tintin exploits (""The Crab with the Golden Claws,"" ""The Secret of the Unicorn,"" and ""Red Rackham's Treasure""). Familiar characters surface as the film progresses. Those hapless law enforcers, Thompson & Thompson, pop in and provide comic relief (they're played by Simon Pegg and Nick Frost). ""Policework isn't all glamour and guns. There's an awful lot of failing,"" proclaims Thompson, or was it the other Thompson? Mostly, they're just here for show, relegated to trying to nab a notorious pickpocket. More relevant is Captain Haddock, the hard-drinking sea captain and the last surviving Haddock, ancestor of him what stowed away 400 weight of gold. Haddock's ravaged memory is key to unlocking the riddle of the scroll. But drink has done in the captain's synapses. His memory is shot (or is it?). As Haddock, Andy Sirkis, master of capture performance CG, is quite awesome. Have they started doling out awards yet for best capture performance performance?

Parents contemplating taking their young 'uns to this one is advised that there is massive gunplay, with Tintin even busting out a gat on one occasion. Mostly, I think the film adheres to the spirit and tone of the source. Time and place are evocative of the 1940s. Tintin is intrepid and noble and idealistic (and, let's face it, sort of bland; the dog Snowy and Haddock always did provide the color). Spielberg and co-conspirator Peter Jackson got all ambitious with the visuals. The performance capture CG is exquisite. I marveled at the vivid attention to detail. The hardest thing to render in CG is the hair, how it sits on the character's head, how it moves, how it looks. But even this was pulled off convincingly. The animation style is photorealistic, except that there are enough bulbous noses going around that a whimsical touch manages to peep thru. There are many spectacular panoramic scenes to absorb, such as Tintin's plane floundering thru a mammoth storm or the sailing ship ripping thru the sand dunes of the Sahara. Near the end, my jaw dropped several times during that exhilarating chase in the streets and on the rooftops of Morocco. ""Blistering barnacles!"" to quote a Haddock. Thanks to ever-advancing CG technology, anything truly is possible. Even Haddock's nose hairs are impeccably rendered.",1326067200,2,4825,4.874543239951279
5002268,5,B006L4ZEDW,"For anyone unfamiliar with Herge's work, the style of the movie might be considered similar to what Raiders of the Lost Ark might look like if it were CGI animated and tuned for an audience of 8-year old boys.  The colors are bright, the violence tame, and there is no pesky romance to slow down the wonderful action sequences.  The result is a film that is sheer simple fun.

The plot, an adaptation of The Secret of the Unicorn and Red Rackham's Treasure with a good dose of The Crab With the Golden Claws blended in, is quick moving and hokey, serving well as a framework for the action sequences and little more.  Character development is minimal, true to the original texts.  Only two female characters are discernible, both very minor (the unavoidable Bianca Castafiore does not even interact with the main characters, but it should be noted that she does not appear in any of the three books adapted.)

The resulting film provides undemanding enjoyment for anyone who is or can remember being an 8-year old boy.  Also, my mother loved it (despite grumbling about the additional cost because it was only showing in 3D (THANKS FOR TAKING US, MOM)).  Also, both my daughters (nearly 9 and nearly 12) loved it (even though the younger one fell asleep in the Sahara Desert and missed the entire pirate backstory.)  Reports from friends on Facebook of various ages have yet to reveal anyone who did not thoroughly enjoy it, despite a few scettered minor complaints.

The film is a worthy representation of the books, offering wonderfully humorous action with little meaning or messages to slow the pace, with a visually appealing presentation.",1325980800,2,1644,4.818505338078292
5002269,5,B006L4ZEDW,"The Tintin graphic novels follow an unlikely protagonist: a mile mannered, sharp-witted young reporter.  There are about two dozen of them, artfully drawn, with a recurring cast of colorful characters woven through various tales. The books have been translated in 50 languages.  200 million copies have been sold around the world, but, oddly, not many of these are in America.  That makes Tintin something of a rare gem here, and he's part of my family culture.  I worried that Speilberg would spoil the magic, ruin the brand.  Somehow, he didn't. At all.  The film is brilliant.

Not only did it capture the tone, pace, and geographic sweep of the novels, it also caught so many details -- facial features of minor characters, body posture, personalities, villains, props, gags, cameo appearances, gestures, curses.  It is all there.  The motion capture style made it almost lifelike, but clearly not.  Just like the novels.

It's as if the books had come alive. Another clever adventure with colorful characters in foreign lands half a century ago.  Nice to see so many old friends, looking good after all these years.",1325203200,64,1120,4.994594594594594

5002271,4,B006L4ZEDW,"Intrepid newspaper man Tintin (Jamie Bell) and his faithful dog Snowy team up with a drunken sea captain (Andy Serkis) in a race with the dastardly Ivan Ivanovitch Sakharine (Daniel Craig) to crack the mystery behind three scrolls hidden in model ships.  Will European audiences accept Hollywood's interpretation of a beloved character, and will US audiences line up for it?

Like so many Americans, I'm out of the loop on Tintin.  I was aware of the character's popularity in the soccer-loving part of the world and could have picked him out of a lineup, but that was about it.  Therefore, although I was hugely entertained by this film, I can't comment on its fidelity to the source material.  (However, the fact that Herge himself reportedly felt Spielberg was the only one who could do justice to his character bodes well on that count.)  The over-the-top exploits that sank ""Crystal Skull"" for so many people (swinging through the treetops with the monkeys, `nuff said) go down much easier in CGI, which straddles the line between the visceral impact of live action and the suspension of the laws of physics allowed by animation quite successfully here.  Tintin is a bit of a cypher--he looks like a teenager but he has his own apartment, everyone treats him like an adult, and his collection of news clippings is evidence of an eventful career.  The most interesting character is really the drunken Captain Haddock, whose arc takes him from a pathetic souse to something much greater.  I'll dock it one star because the action goes on perhaps just a hair too long, which makes the perfectly good denouement suffer by comparison.  I'm on board for any sequels, and I'm thinking that the original books might be fun to read with my young son...",1325030400,4,1748,4.8355704697986575
5002272,5,B006L4ZEDW,"Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson set themselves a challenge in translating the iconic comic book character Tintin to the big screen.  Popular in Europe through a series of graphic novels, Tintin is less well known in the US; any movie would have to appeal to both audiences.  A suitable story had to be selected from decades of plots; ""The Adventures of Tintin"" borrows elements from three.  Finally, the movie straddles the animation/live action dilemma by using live action capture.

The result is a vivid, fast-moving thriller that quickly introduces the young investigative reporter Tintin and his faithful dog Snowy, and sends them off in search of clues to a mysterious ship model and a missing treasure.  Along the way, Tintin links up with the colorful Captain Haddock, who hold one of the keys to the mystery.  The three of them will survive adventures at sea and in Morocco before returning home for a final confrontation with their ruthless opponent and his minions.

A clever opening sequence sets the tone for the movie, in which an artist who looks suspiciously like Tintin-creator Herge does a sketch of Tintin in a marketplace.  When Tintin accepts the finished sketch, we see both the familiar face of Tintin and Jamie Bell's movie portrayal.

The story is build around plot elements from ""The Secret of the Unicorn"" and ""Red Rackham's Treasure"" to set up an audience-pleasing treasure hunt, although an inserted segment from ""The Crab with the Golden Claws"" is used to get Tintin and Captain Haddock quickly in partnership.  The plot is stitched together with a series of often frantic and sometimes over-the-top action sequences.  This reviewer wishes the producers had settled for a shorter, simpler movie that better captured the exotic but not unrealistic tone of the original stories.

""The Adventures of Tintin"" is likely to appeal to new audiences for its fun and adventure, and to long-time fans for its many knowing nods at the pantheon of Tintin characters and story elements.  ""The Adventures of Tintin"" is highly recommended to both audiences.",1325030400,2,2075,5.067647058823529

The filmmakers did an excellent job and even my friend who went to see it with me the first time who was unfamiliar with Tintin enjoyed it thoroughly too. It made me want to read the comics again so I went out and bought the collector's edition for our family as a Christmas present. I've since read or re-read through twelve of the comics, including the three that the movie was based from, and I have to honestly say as much as I still enjoy the stories, I like the movie even better!

It will make you laugh, giggle, oooooh, exciting and truely an all round family movie, although my hubbie thought the special effects were very realistic in places and though therer were pieces with the violence that maybe a little realistic for young kinds below 10: you have been advised!",1324684800,5,588,4.85
5002276,3,B006L4ZEDW,"Put me in the evidently small group of people who have never heard of Tintin, let alone read any of the books.  Well sure, I've seen the movie trailers.  Initially, I was a bit put off because I couldn't figure out how old this kid is.  My son suggested he was about 15 and that's pretty much the way the character acted and looked.  Then, he heads back to his bachelor pad, straps on a Ruger 9 mm and heads out looking for the crooks that stole his model ship.  He even heads out to sea after being captured and manages to dispatch numerous henchmen with the boxing skills of Manny Pacquiao.  I guess he's a bit older.  In any case director Steven Spielberg, in his first animated film, resurrects what appears to be Young Indiana Jones.

Tintin purchases a model 3-masted sailing ship at a flea market unaware that sealed inside one of the masts is a map that leads to a great treasure.  This early part of the film wants to be witty and I wish it were.  Where are all those inside jokes that keep the adults interested?  The movie jumps to a full gallop and never lets up for the next hour or more.  Tintin, with the help of his trusted pooch Snowy, manage to figure things out.  Aboard the ship, Tintin frees the captain who is the grandson of the original sailing ship's captain.  The ship (Unicorn)  sunk loaded with gold and other treasures.  In reflection the ship was sunk after a great battle with a pirate named Sakharine.  He was the grandfather of the thief (Rackham) who took Tintin's model ship.  Each of the 3 model ships that were built by grandpa Haddock contains clues to the treasure location.  The chase is on.  And it's quite a chase.  The action is exhausting.

The movie uses motion capture and is very well done.  Excellent voice acting helps as well.  Jamie Bell is Tintin, Daniel Craig is the evil Rackham/Sakharine and talented Andy Serkis is the Captains Haddock.  I saw this film in 3-D and it is subtle and very effective.  This is a close second to the 3-D version of ""Hugo"" in terms of technical effectiveness.  I would also note that I saw this in a theater filled with kids who can often be fidgety and noisy, but there wasn't a peep.  The only distraction was the numbskull in front of me who kept checking his Blackberry.",1324684800,3,2258,4.415048543689321
5002277,5,B006L4ZEDW,"A headlong adventure movie in the spirit of the Indiana Jones movies and the matinee serials that inspired them. In fact, Tintin no doubt was an inspiration in the creation of Indiana Jones and it's wonderful to see Tintin brought to the big screen so grandly and successfully.

I was decidedly unfriendly to the choice of animation style but was won over completely; Spielberg and company have somehow managed to make perhaps the most troubling animation style in existence seem both astonishingly realistic and comfortingly classic at the same time. That is an amazing accomplishment. That it is accomplished in the service of such a fun cinematic romp is a treat to experience.",1324598400,5,680,5.017699115044247
5002278,5,B006L4ZEDW,"As a half-Belgian, I grew up on Herge's work of Tintin and loved it immensely.  I still have the books that I originally collected back in the 80's.  About a year ago, I began reading the Tintin books to my own daughter who has been completely hooked.  Then, we learned that Spielberg/Jackson were heading up the effort to bring this to the silver screen.

So, when I heard that Spielberg and Jackson were on the job, I felt that the project was on track to begin with (Spielberg having bought rights to make the movie back in 1984!).  After having seen it, I couldn't imagine how much better a Tintin movie might have played out, nor who could have played the characters better.  Everyone was perfectly chosen and no one felt out of place...ever.

For those of you unfamiliar with Tintin, what are you in for?  Well, to sum it up briefly, Tintin is a young, intrepid reporter who has an insatiable thirst for adventure and need to solve mysteries along with his white, wily dog Snowy (or ""Milou"" in the original Belgian version) who is never far away from his master's side.  Other characters in Tintin's universe include the bumbling detectives, Thompson and Thomson (one with a ""p"", the other without).  Captain Haddock, from the original comic series, is a hopeless drunk ready with a quick lash of his nonsensical oaths (""blistering blue barnacles and ten thousand thundering typhoons!"") and even quicker with a bottle of whiskey, often to amusing effect.

*minor spoilers in the next paragraph*

In this movie, Tintin comes across an exquisite replica of a 16th Century ship called the Unicorn.  Straight off the bat, the ship is sought after by multiple men who try to relieve Tintin of his purchase at a flea market with cash.  Sure enough, Tintin soon becomes embroiled in a mystery that has been buried in the past regarding the ship's secret cargo.  The nature of this mystery has supposedly been passed down through to the last surviving heir who happens to be Haddock himself.  What follows is a race to decode a cryptic message left in the boat in Tintin's possession.  It's a breakneck, fantastic adventure involving danger on high seas, a fantastic aerial sequence, deserts, Moroccan palaces, and Europe itself (albeit a fairly non-descript one that suggests that Tintin is of English origin) ultimately culminating in solving the riddle behind the Unicorn and a revelation of Haddock's past.

For those of you who are familiar with Tintin already, how is the treatment of the source material?  I would say that it's fairly decent although bringing such a story to the silver screen does require changes.  The movie touches on elements of the ""Secret Of The Unicorn,"" ""Red Rackham's Treasure,"" and ""The Crab With The Golden Claws.""  For the sake of brevity, the pace of the story and the whole Calculus/submarine storyline were abandoned in favor of a plot that moves very quickly.  However, elements that closely parallel the original stories (including the moment where Tintin hilariously interrupts Haddock who attempts to incorporate a swig of whiskey during a historical flashback), are handled with exquisitely painstaking detail and you can tell that Tintin afficianados were involved from start-to-finish; this is not a mere cash-grab.  In fact, the opening credits feature a vignette that is reminiscent of Herge's original artwork.  Also, a quick look around Tintin's apartment shows newspaper articles that depict many of his other adventures from other books.  Other touches include a cameo from Herge himself (who has been dead since 1983) as he sketches up Tintin at the flea market, revealing a portrait that is a perfect replica of Tintin from the comics.  For a true Tintin nostalgic fan, all of these touches are brief, but a delightful nod for those of us who remember.

As for the motion capture and rendering of the movie itself?  Simply astounding.  I always thought that Polar Express was beautiful, but there was something about the characters' eyes that gave me the ""is there anyone in there"" sensation.  In this movie, however, everyone looks very much alive and the eyes really betray the emotions of how everyone is feeling.  Even the detail of Haddock's spray of explosive saliva as he grates, ""No one takes my SHIP!"" is a jaw-dropping experience.  The ocean water looks extremely real and it's hard to believe that I'm watching an animated feature most of the time.  The 3D effects - for those of you who are into it - are really done quite well, but I know that it's not everyone's cup of tea.  However, the luminosity issues that plague most 3D movies don't hurt Tintin noticeably; even dark scenes provide extremely good contrast for a great viewing experience.  Colors are extremely vibrant and pop even with the 3D glasses.  The 2D version looks just as good without the 3D effect...yes, I've seen it twice - I told you that I'm a fan.

As for parents, I would say not to take the PG rating too lightly.  Haddock is a drunk, so there is consumption of alcohol but often to humorous effect; however, if that sort of thing offends you, you've been warned.  The bad guys also have no qualms at shooting at Tintin, Haddock, and Snowy either...although our trio is not afraid to dish it back either.  There is very little blood, but a character does die revealing a blood-spattered newspaper (not excessive, but enough to give you the idea that the fellow isn't doing too well).  I took my 8-year old daughter to go see it and she handled it just fine; a lot of the same elements that you see in the movie are in the books as well, so she was already prepared for everything that she was about to see.

I applaud Spielberg for his work on this film.  It certainly threw me back 30 years to my own childhood and I enjoyed the movie immensely.  The ending of the movie certainly suggest that more could be on the horizon.  My only fear, however, is that despite having sold 350 million books, Herge's work is not as widely known in the United States...I can only hope that it does well enough as well as it has overseas thus far to warrant another release.  My daughter and I will eagerly be in that line should it ever occur.",1324425600,7,6170,4.751173708920188
5002279,4,B006L4ZEDW,"So what do you get when you take the director of The Lord of the Rings movies, the director of the Indiana Jones movies, and the writer/producer for the current series of Doctor Who and give them $135 million to play around with? Turns out you get the best action film I've seen in ages and what will likely be the Best Animated Film winner at the next Oscar ceremony.

The Adventures of Tintin is based on a Belgian comic book that, despite having three years of French in high school, I have no memory of. I'm sure I read it at some point, but I was always more of an Asterix kind of guy. So while I cannot comment on the film compared with the comics, I can comment on the film itself and I can say that it was everything I'd hoped for.

The story focuses on Tintin (Jamie Bell), a...boy, I suppose? It's hard to tell his age for sure, but I get the impression he's supposed to be around sixteen or seventeen? However he lives on his own and has a job as a successful reporter, so perhaps he's just an adult. Anyhow, he buys a model ship, only to find out that certain other people, including a rather sinister-looking man (Daniel Craig), want to get their hands on it. Soon the boat is stolen, and Tintin, along with his faithful dog, Snowy, are kidnapped, and trapped aboard a ship.

With the help of the ship's captain (Andy Sirkis), he manages to escape, and winds up in chases involving, at various points, the following vehicles: a cargo ship, a life boat, a seaplane, a motorcycle (that becomes a unicycle), and a hotel (don't ask). This culminates in a sword-fight that uses cranes as swords. It is, to put it mildly, somewhat action-packed. I really can't say enough about the action sequences in this movie, which very much put me in mind of The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, only with a better budget.

But like the best Speilberg action movies, it doesn't lose track of the story, which is engaging and enjoyable. All the characters serve a purpose and are fun to watch on screen. Captain Haddock, in particular, was wonderful fun. Andy Serkis continues to prove that he really did get the royal screw-job when he wasn't nominated for an Oscar for his performance as Golum. Jamie Bell is also great as Tintin, who is played somewhat like a younger version of the Doctor, which is no surprise given Moffat's involvement.

The film did seem to drag a bit toward the end, and the obvious set-up for a sequel was a bit annoying. On the plus side, regardless of how the film performs here in the USA, a sequel is likely, since it's already pulled in nearly $240 million overseas.

One final word: if you want to see the film in the theatre, don't knock yourself out to see it in 3D. The 3D effect is ok, and doesn't distract or anything, but I don't know that it really adds anything to the movie. It was well done and all, but like with any 3D, it does dim the screen considerably, and I'm sure the film would work just as well in 2D.",1324425600,,2947,4.378427787934187
5002280,5,B006L4ZEDW,"The truth is I don't care much for movie reviews, so I didn't know what to expect when I went to watch this movie.  I liked Tintin from the first time I read one of the books back some 45 years ago.  Since then, I've always had one or another Tintin item here or there.  AS far as the movie goes, I liked it.  It  wasn't exactly like the story on the book, but the movie adaptation more or less followed the general idea of the story.  The movie was action from beginning to end.  The special graphic effects were outstanding and the future of many movies to come.  I saw it in 3D and I liked it too.  The old 3D used to give me a headache sometimes. But this new 3D looks great and you get used to it fairly quick.  All the actors did justice to the characters they were playing.  Craig, Bell and Serkis did an excellent job with their characters.  The story line, special effects and 3D, as well as the large pop corn I had were all good.  I even got a senior discount on the ticket.  What more could I have asked for?",1324425600,,1020,4.035
5002281,4,B006L4ZEDW,"The Adventures of Tintin was a film I wasn't sure what to think of. Another motion capture CG animated film? Haven't we gotten enough of those from Robert Zemeckis? Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull really soured my opinion of an already faulty foundation known as Steven Spielberg's more recently directed films. However there was an upside: both the outstanding Edgar Wright and writer/director of Attack the Block Joe Cornish contributed to the writing of the film. The cast was also incredible and the film had a reputation amongst critics who had already seen it as being this nonstop action adventure. Tintin sounded like money going into it; BIG money. The final product turns out to be rather good, but isn't quite as spectacular as the hype lets on.

You're pretty much thrown into this mystery right from the start. This isn't an origin story. It's a continuation of a character most people either are already familiar with and/or immensely love. Tintin (voiced by Jamie Bell) buys a model ship at an outdoor market known as The Unicorn, but things become strange very quickly. Two men try to obtain the ship from him right after he purchases it: the first one warning him to get rid of it as soon as he can and the other, a man named Ivanovich Sakharine (voiced by Daniel Craig) offering him any price he'd like. Politely declining, Tintin takes the ship home and eventually discovers that something is hidden inside the ship. As a journalist always hungry for a story, Tintin embarks on an incredible adventure accompanied by his dog Snowy and a sea captain named Captain Haddock (voiced by Andy Serkis).

The opening credits are amazing. It's traditional 2D animation, so it stands out from the rest of the film. There's this mini mystery solved during the duration of the opening credits. The pace is perfect and it's easily one of the best film openings of the year. You'll probably also notice the incredible score by John Williams right out the gate. It captures the atmosphere of crime and noir films perfectly and makes full use of a wide range of orchestral instruments. It's just an extraordinary score all around.

Peter Jackson once described the film's look as ""photorealistic; the fibers of their clothing, the pores of their skin and each individual hair. They look exactly like real people - but real Herge people!"" This is a really exceptional quote to fall back on when trying to describe how the film looks. Textures, hair, and the way character's mouths move are all very realistic. Despite sharing motion capture qualities with recent Robert Zemeckis films such as A Christmas Carol, Beowulf, and The Polar Express, Tintin looks better. It could be due to the characters looking more like the actual characters and not the actors who portray them, but Tintin pays ridiculous attention to detail which is probably just as much a blessing as it is a curse.

There are two action scenes in the film that are worth the price of admission alone; Captain Haddock's pirate flashback and the motorcycle chase scene. The pirate ship battle makes it seem like the Pirates of the Caribbean films failed miserably at anything remotely resembling action. Tintin has this fantastic use of perspective in that it's dynamic, but it doesn't get too experimental or crazy. It's like you're always in the right place at the right time. You can clearly make out what's going on at all times, which is something Michael Bay isn't able to claim the majority of the time. The motorcycle chase is my favorite of the two since it's nonstop. The pirate scene cuts back and forth between what Haddock is remembering and what's transpiring in the real world. The motorcycle chase is just in your face the entire time, lasts around six minutes, and puts you on the edge of your seat.

Tintin does have its shortcomings though. It does feature two of the year's best action scenes, but it also drags quite a bit in the middle. You get a little bored at times watching Tintin and Haddock be stranded out at sea, stumble through the desert, and Haddock's incessant rambling of never having enough booze. It results in the film feeling longer than it is. There was also a big deal about seeing this on screen. ""It MUST be seen in 3D,"" is what we were told. As you can imagine, the 3D isn't really mandatory for enjoying the film. Aside from one scene, I don't recall a huge use of it anyway. A lot of the action was also extremely unrealistic, as well. I know, it's Hollywood, it's Steven Spielberg, you're supposed to already have this suspension of disbelief anyway. If I get to the point where I notice that this couldn't happen in reality though, then I feel like the movie hasn't effectively done its job; not completely anyway. That feeling was almost overbearing at times with Tintin.

The Adventures of Tintin does seem to fall a bit short of the painting critics have painted for it, but is still well worth the price of admission. This year has also been an amazing year for movies featuring dogs: The Artist had Jack, Beginners had Arthur, and Tintin has Snowy. Snowy is easily the most entertaining of the three, but he's also the most animated and the most fictional. Tintin may be a bit slow at times, but visually it's freaking spectacular and the score is an easy contender for one of the best of the year. As far as animated films go, it's films like The Adventures of Tintin that movie lovers live for.",1324425600,2,5436,4.716842105263158
