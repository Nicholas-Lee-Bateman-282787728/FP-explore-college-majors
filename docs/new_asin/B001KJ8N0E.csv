8323305,5,B001KJ8N0E,"This updated movie version of the original Japanese Version of Wu Cheng En's Journey to the West series (Titled Monkey Magic in the UK, and translated to English by BBC) has a golden haired frisky version of Goku (SunWukong), A rather impish and demure big hat wearing version of Pigsy, and a cool Anime style version of Sandy (in this version he's a Kappa-Japanese Water spirit) While Tripitaka is actually played by a female. They are first seen crossing a great dessert (unlike all other `movie' homages to JTTW) this version picks up on an independent story based off the Japanese TV series, and is not a homage to the books by Wu Cheng En. (I mean that most versions depict Monkey's 1st journey with Tripitaka, or the tale of how Monkey became joined with Tripitaka.) This tale is the story of Golden Horn and Silver Horn with a new twist, they added in some fun quirks and new jokes, and even a poke at cosplayers. If you like cheesy movies, you collect JTTW items, you have a fun love for all things Japanese, and you enjoy the culture and bounce that makes Japanese and Chinese Mythos so wonderful, then this movie will be a gem in your collection. If you don't like any of those things, you most likely won't like this movie unless you are at a convention, or are with a group of friends heckling it with a ton of food and drinks at hand.
I recommend the China Masterpiece: Journey to the West (10 Dvds) collectors edition, if you want to TRULY enjoy the video/TV version of Wu Cheng En's masterpiece, Journey to the West and see the real SunWukong and his adventures at their very best.
