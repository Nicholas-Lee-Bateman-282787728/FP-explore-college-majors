7813763,4,6301648560,"A less  well written and gritty tale than Counsellor at Law(  the outstanding stage play by the great depression-era  playwright Elmer Rice,) but nevertheless showcases Barrymore in a pre-code tale of a redeemed sleaze-bag mob mouthpiece who  jumps the fence to become state's attorney on his way to a Governorship. Well-paced and with good support  from  the lady actors including the first wife of Laurence Olivier.",1481155200,,417,5.242424242424242

7813765,4,6301648560,"I think it is one of Barrymore's greats. Great courtroom scenes, but ""Counselor at Law"" is probably better because of the cast and the script.",1456444800,2,142,4.72
7813766,3,6301648560,"This is a very old movie, very dated in some ways, but John Barrymore gives an interesting performance as a flawed hero and other players are good.",1442016000,2,147,4.481481481481482

7813768,4,6301648560,"John Barrymore as an unethical lawyer with a drinking problem and a sense of disillusionment.  Barrymore is effective and the film has a touching
emotional ""flavor"" to it.  Holds up reasonably well overall.  The best part of the story is the relationship between the lawyer and a fallen woman that
he befriends and ultimately lives with.  Their up-and-down relationship is at the core of the film and most interesting to follow.  Good film overall.",1426204800,2,448,5.0
7813769,5,6301648560,"Barrymore at his best! Also ""Dinner For Eight"" and ""Grand Hotel"" are classics staring Mr. Barrymore.",1423353600,,100,5.3125
7813770,4,6301648560,"The amount of sliced ham in this movie ought to have kept local delis in the black, Depression or no.  Helen Twelvetrees might have been one of those for whom any form of stardom was unfounded, but she manages to hold her own against Dear John, and that is no mean feat.",1388361600,3,270,4.1923076923076925
7813771,5,6301648560,"If you want a good movie, with John Barrymore in the later years of his movie career, get this one.  It's interesting that the studios let him do this and ""Dinner at Eight,"" portraying characters that were so close to own life; I've always thought it was sad that he drank his career away, as did other actors.  Anyway, he does a great job in this, I think.",1367539200,8,357,4.235294117647059
7813772,5,6301648560,"This is a great pre-code movie with lust, divorce, drinking, suicide and sex scandal. Later they redid it as Criminal Lawyer, with a more sanitized script.",1207353600,6,155,5.0
