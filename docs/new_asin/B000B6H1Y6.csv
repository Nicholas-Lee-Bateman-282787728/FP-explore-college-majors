2403429,5,B000B6H1Y6,"This was a wonderful movie.  Not only was it heartwarming but it illustrated a gospel point better than any other movie I have ever seen.  Jesus said ""You must lose your life to save it."" and this is the lesson Calvin learns.  When he stops trying to manipulate the situation and just does what is right (another gospel point), he abandons himself to just enjoying the time he has with his family.  Noboby ever lies on their death bed and says ""gee I wish I had taken my family business public!""  or ""nice family, but I'm really bummed about that business failing 30 years back.""  Watch this movie and get your priorities straight.",1134432000,38,631,4.539823008849558
2403430,3,B000B6H1Y6,"A cute modernized ""remake"" (or rip-off) of ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE.

Weber makes the film.

Of course he really wasn't such a bad guy to start with which throws the story a little out of whack... heck, he saved the family business from Chapter 11 and made it a success so the whole family is now financially secure.... cut the guy some slack!!

We watched this the same day as the Pitt/Jolie movie MR AND MRS SMITH and actually enjoyed this one a bit more.",1133654400,20,453,4.305882352941176
2403431,3,B000B6H1Y6,"The 12 Days of Christmas is one of those rather innane made-for-tv Christmas movies that crop up every holiday season.  I believe this was a USA network picture as I recall.  The movie basically borrows elements from Groundhog Day, It's A Wonderful Life, and Scrooge to arrive at its story.  Steven Weber, a fairly likable actor plays Calvin a business owner who has taken the family store and built it into a national chain.  But this has of course hurt him in his personal life leading to his marriage disolving and alienating his son and brother.

Calvin has an accident and wakes up to find that he's essentially dead...He's meets Nurse Angie who is his guardian Angel and he is told, ala Scrooge that he has 12 days to set things right with the rest of his family and his life...or else.  Shannon provides most of the laughs in her own usual manic way, basically hammering Calvin over the head on what he has to do.  And of course in the end we have Calvin discovering the true meaning of Christmas and he sets things right with his family.  The performances were very good it's just too bad there wasn't more of an original story for them to work with.",1131926400,34,1158,4.480952380952381

2403453,5,B000B6H1Y6,"This movie is probably one of the lesser known movies about Christmas, but it is very good and always amongst the first that I watch at Christmastime. I would recommend this movie primarily for adults. It has a good moral, in that in the end - the wrongs are righted and good triumphs over evil.",1321228800,,295,4.381818181818182
2403454,5,B000B6H1Y6,The write-up looked good to me so I purchased the movie. I remember when the movie aired on TV and I missed watching it so I was glad that Amazon had it for sale. I shall watch it during this holiday season. I gave the seller a five star rating for their service and delivery.,1316390400,,276,4.036363636363636
2403455,3,B000B6H1Y6,"This is a Christmas version of ""Groundhog Day"".  I was disapointed that comedienne Molly Shannon wasn't given a script worthy of her talent.  This movie was worth watching once - as we eavesdrop on a 'corporate suit' trying to get his Christmas Eve day right... along with his life as a whole with his estranged family.  Find it at your local rental place, but I wouldn't purchase it.",1258675200,,384,4.617647058823529
2403456,4,B000B6H1Y6,"People are the most important items on my list today. Really they should be the most important items every day. In fact, that point is the theme for the movie 12 Days of Christmas Eve starring Steven Weber and Molly Shannon.

The Plot

Calvin Carter is a self-indulged, wealthy CEO (of a discount chain store) who puts self and making money before family, friends, employees and really his own best interests. Then Fate intervenes. An accident triggers a ""Groundhog Days"" scenario.

Carter has the opportunity to make Christmas Eve perfect for those around him, not according to his self-absorbed wants. In fact, he gets 12 chances to get it right or else the accident turns fatal. His clueless actions cause frustration and pain for those around him and are sadly typical of many who don't value the relationships in their lives. But Carter does seem to be growing in his appreciation of what ""perfect"" means.

This movie, with its humorous treatment of a serious theme, is one I'll watch again.

Watch the movie to see if Carter finally chooses to live a perfect Christmas Eve. It's a PG rating so I'm sure you can guess the ending.

My dd (24) did not like the movie. She felt it was predictable from the first scene. And come on, 12 tries to get it right.

But I stand by my first assessment of the movie. Most of us will probably never be wealthy enough to have the connections to buy a boat on Christmas Eve or own a wealth producing company with potential international franchises. But many of us probably need a reminder or two about what constitutes perfect as far as our priorities in life go.

This movie would be great to watch with others and then talk about what needs to happen in order to have a perfect Christmas Eve this year.",1228003200,,1744,4.5673076923076925
2403457,5,B000B6H1Y6,This movie is  done with an excellent sense of humor but also has a good Christmas message included.  I loved it and will watch it every year!,1208131200,3,142,4.222222222222222
2403458,2,B000B6H1Y6,"Really, the main character has to repeat this day of dying many, many times before he gets it right! It is way too much like Ground Hog day but less funny. The crudeness and unbelievableness makes this a two star movie. I don't recommend it as a family movie.",1197849600,4,259,4.3061224489795915
2403459,1,B000B6H1Y6,"I returned this movie.  Being a Christmas movie fan, I could see no need to retain this in my home.  The main reason - the producers found it necessary to include in one of the Christmas Eve's a portion of the main character being extremely self-absorbed -- he buys everything he wants, treats people anyway he wants -- which OK is what self-absorbed people do, however, I didn't need the scene where he has self-fulfilling sex with his girlfriend.  The whole bed scene could have been eliminated, even if the producers alluded to it.

At best, the acting was B-rated.",1168300800,17,568,4.65
2403460,4,B000B6H1Y6,"Coming up with new ideas for Christmas movies must be a hard task for movie producers.  This charming little holiday nugget combines the reliving the same day elements from GROUNDHOG DAY with the perennial tale of Ebenezer Scrooge as a man given a chance to make his life correct.

In this version, Steven Weber is quite good as Clarence Klein, a corporate exec who opts to spend Christmas Eve courting the head of a South American company interested in his stores, The Buck Stops Here.  Patricia Valesquez is charming in this role and adds some love interest (?) as well.  After a succesful day with Velasquez, while missing his son's Christmas concert and using a reservation for a fancy restaurant from his current squeeze, Klein is killed when the huge pointing finger logo sign crushes him.  He ends up in the hands of angel/Angie Molly Shannon who informs him he has 12 chances to make things right.

Weber tries everything from working in a soup kitchen to giving away 1.2 million dollars to try and earn a new chance but of course it takes him the full twelve days and eleven more deaths to see the light.

Weber's charming performance and Shannon's acerbic turn spark the movie and make it a delightful holiday movie.",1164499200,9,1226,4.700934579439252
2403461,4,B000B6H1Y6,"I watched this movie expecting to be bored as I have been by other movies where the same day played over and over. I was surprised that this movie didn't bore me, but instead left me anxious to see what would happen next. The guy, played by Steven Weber, thinks he has just experienced this best Christmas Eve of his life because of a great business deal. He has 12 chances to realize what a ""best Christmas"" really is, and he must figure it out for himself with no hints from his nurse/angel, or it will actually be his last Christmas Eve.",1162857600,16,540,4.303921568627451
8082418,5,B000B6H1Y6,"I found this movie oddly sweet.  Molly Shannon & Steven Weber are great together!  This is a sweet Christmas movie in high fashion of bringing the true meaning of Christmas to light.  Steven's character was building his business, losing himself and his family.

8082427,5,B000B6H1Y6,"I am a total sucker for Christmas movies, and they can cheer me up any time of year. No matter how many times the themes and character types are repeated, I can always find something to lift my spirits. The Twelve Days of Christmas Eve is no exception to that genre. It evokes all the best elements of It's a Wonderful Life, A Christmas Carol, and a little Ground Hogs Day tossed in for good measure! Of course, lessons are learned in the nick of time and all is right with the world in time for Christmas.

Sigh... If only it was Christmas every day we'd all learn our lessons and the world would be a much better place. Oh, and add yet another star atop your tree if you are a fan of Molly Shannon! (And if you aren't, well, you just should be -- so... yet another lesson learned!!)",1353283200,4,784,4.19205298013245
