8400782,5,B003N9BMV6,"I live on the opposite coast from the PonyPros, but I have followed their website, videos, and Facebook page for several years. My 7-year-old son just got his first riding pony, and I have just re-watched this video for ideas for him. As a student of natural horsemanship, and a mom, I am really impressed with the techniques presented here. The focus is on the relationship between child and pony, and on balance - not perfect placement of your heels and hands. This is a riding school/camp where the students actually start their own ponies (under adult supervision, of course)!

If you have any doubts about purchasing this video, find some of the PonyPros video clips on YouTube and spend a little time watching them first.

The first approx. 30 minutes of the video are theory/discussion - this is all great information, but if you are like me, you want to get to the action! I do really recommend that you watch this first 30-minutes at least once, maybe more if you don't have a background in natural horsemanship (even if you do, there are some great tips in here). There are no video chapters, so I watched the video one evening and wrote down the starting time for each sequence in order to reference them quickly later on - some of my favorites are:

37min - Spooky (desensitization)
41min - Hippity Hop (weight of the rider)
51min - Stick Together
1hr23min - Stretching
1hr33min - Seatwork on Longe",1371340800,2,1410,4.6546184738955825
8400783,5,B003N9BMV6,"I absolutely enjoyed this video.  I first rented it as an instant video, and watched it repeatedly during the rental period.  Truly, this is a video to own, not rent.  The exercises are terrific things to do either with a new horse/rider partnership, or as ongoing relationship building in existing partnerships.  Truly wonderful ""meaty"" information . . . . not a bunch of fluff at all.

Some folks might criticize the production quality, if they are those sorts of folks.  However, I have paid more for videos where the content was FAR less.  I am happy to bypass slick presentation if it means greater education!

I hope the PonyPros folks publish more videos or books, as they are really helping our relationships with our equine partners!",1322611200,2,742,4.833333333333333
