7899697,1,7121021412,"I ordered this film from Amazon and took it back with me to Singapore where we can play any format. I was surprised to find that this French foreign film does not have any English Titles. I have heard wonderful things about this film but I was not ever expecting to order it in the United States and have no mention that it has no English titles. After all, the US is supposed to be an English speaking country. The product detail mentions that it is not zoned for the USA but it never says it lacks titles. So if you don't understand French then do not purchase this product.",1343606400,6,576,4.245454545454545
