I remember when this show was on TV originally and my parents would have it on and of course, I'd watch.  It was classic comedy.  And now, I love to watch it again, and I've shared it with my daughter, who also finds the show hilarious!  This type of family comedy never goes out of style.  I'm glad to watch it again, and pass it on to a new generation!",1463961600,,440,4.190476190476191

8049128,5,B0007N1QU8,"Show #1 (1975): The legendary horror movie actor Vincent Price & the talented comedienne Joan Rivers are the guests. Included: A sketch about a distinguished mystery author (Price) who meets his match in a young girl scout (Carol) during a book signing; Carol & Vicki do a musical tribute to famous people from Brooklyn, which eventually cues Rivers to do a hilarious stand-up routine; theatrical couple Funt & Mundane (Carol, Harvey) find themselves sabotaged & ambushed during their stage performance by their understudies (Vicki, Price); a marathon spoof of then-current T.V. shows like ""Police Woman"", ""Chico and the Man"", ""Rhoda"", ""Tony Orlando & Dawn"" (the genuine articles make a cameo), and ""The Waltons"" (their spoof is called ""The Walnuts""); and the climax is an amusing chorus version of ""Peter and the Wolf"".
Show #2 (1976): Up-and-coming Broadway star Kay Cole is the guest. So impressed was Burnett with young Cole's performance in ""A Chorus Line"" that she invited her on the show. Included: A sketch about a woman (Carol) going to extremes to prove that an accident victim (Harvey) she injured is a phoney; an amusing bit of banter as Carol & Co. give Cole their support (and advice)--she soon demonstrates her great voice in a musical number; the always-worth-waiting-for ""family"" sketch, which introduces Ed's (Harvey) twerp-of-a-friend/employee Mickey (Tim) in a celebration which soon disintegrates into another family argument; and a musical climax with songs all about rain.
Again, two good shows with a crystal-clear DVD remaster!",1251763200,4,1552,5.287449392712551
