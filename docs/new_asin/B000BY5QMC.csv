8094237,3,B000BY5QMC,"This is an interesting take on trading stocks.  I decided along the way that I wasn't going to trade, so this book became of less value to me.  I've become an index and ETF buy and hold person for the most part.  Works better for me at this time.",1388793600,,246,3.979591836734694
8094238,2,B000BY5QMC,I bought this DVD and I am very disappointed in it. The guy mentions a few dotcoms to go to for your trading information like stockcharts and a few others that cost you 10 bucks a month. Also what throws me is his definition of Swing trading. He said that Swing trades are to be held for 2 weeks to 6 months. Sounds to be like Buying and Holding a stock. He called it the new buy and hold as if he was inventing his own new category of trading. Swing trading was supposed to be a couple days to maybe 10 days tops. All I can say is it was a poor lecture and I wasn't impressed at all I am sorry to say. He is no Oliver Velez with his speaking skills that is for sure. But at least he is trying. I don't think a lecture giving us a few dotcom sites constitutes a dvd to be honest. There is nothing here that gives me any socalled essentials that is for sure. He says he is a hedge fund manager great. But is he a successful Swing trader? I don't think so. I don't think he puts his money where his mouth is. But you never know. He looks like a guy that puts his money in Bank of America in a CD but and maybe dabbles a few bucks in the stock market. He is a writer so he got type happy and wrote a book on it. But you never know I could be wrong lol. All I can say is this dvd will not be watched anymore. But if you want to buy it just to witness it for yourself then be my guest. I would gladly sell you this one for 1.99 if I could. I will give him 2 stars for trying. Next time I suggest he put some substance to it. Not merely talk about three or four dotcoms as if that was inside information that will give us the edge. Show me some Japanese Candlesticks and a method that wins 75% of the time. Also work on your speaking. Put the microphone closer to your mouth. Modulate your voice and sound strong. It just seemed so High School to me.,1342569600,,1844,3.8552631578947367
8094239,5,B000BY5QMC,I got more out of this than a similar one by Oliver Velez. Markman reveals the essential elements needed to craft programs that consistently enhance your advantage and increase your rewards. get a good book on swing trading too and you will become an expert at it.,1272672000,,264,4.638297872340425
