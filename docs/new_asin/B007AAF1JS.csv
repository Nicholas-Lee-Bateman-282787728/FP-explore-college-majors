8513216,3,B007AAF1JS,"Registered Nurse (Robert Florey, 1934)

Pre-code melodrama clocking in at sixty-three minutes, barely feature-length, that doesn't really hold a candle to better-remembered movies from the era, but is still worth a look if you're a fan of pre-code stuff. 42nd Street beauty Bebe Daniels stars as Sylvia Benton. As we open, Sylvia is at a party with her drunken, overbearing lout of a husband, Jim (Gordon Westcott, who would die the next year in a horse-related accident). When they leave the party, Sylvia tells Jim she's had it with him and wants a divorce; he loses control of the car and crashes into a tree. Fast-forward a few years and Sylvia, who was a nurse before she met Jim, is back in the business at a swingin' metropolitan hospital, going by the nickname Ben, and is hotly pursued by two of the staff doctors, Connolly (He Married His Wife's Lyle Talbot) and Hedwig (50 Million Frenchmen's John Halliday). Why? Because Ben is pretty much the perfect woman. All the men want to marry her, all the patients love her, all the nurses want to be her. Are the alarm bells going off in your head yet? They should be. There's a big twist in the plot about halfway through where she reveals why she won't marry either one of them, but plot is secondary here to hospital life and mildly prurient jokes. It's amusing, and it's short, so it won't take up much of your time, but it's not terribly memorable, and once the plot pops back up, it's pretty predictable. ***",1362096000,2,1469,4.606870229007634
8513217,4,B007AAF1JS,"THE CRASH is excellent...the usual Ruth Chatterton vehicle with her suffering through various indignities (sleeping with a millionaire to get stock tips, taking a JOB (gasp!) when the stock market crash hits, etc).  If you liked her in DODSWORTH you'll enjoy her here, and the famous early 30s Warner Bros style is in full force.

REGISTERED NURSE is a fascinating find, since its been hard to see any Bebe Daniels films besides 42ND STREET and the original MALTESE FALCON over the years.  This is a typical episodic, everything-but-the-kitchen-sink Warners ""B"" movie, with some sly, suggestive sexual references (especially from gold digging nurse Renee Whitney, who..ahem...""reads"" to male patients and gets diamond bracelets out of them!).  Love that all the nurses smoke like locomotives...it's the least healthy hospital imaginable.

The prints are OK (the sound on NURSE fluctuates quite a bit), but most likely this is the best source material to be found for these titles.  Nice way to add two rare pre-codes to your collection.",1360886400,9,1036,5.248484848484848
