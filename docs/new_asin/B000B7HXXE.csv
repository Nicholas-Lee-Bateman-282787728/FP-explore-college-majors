8082793,4,B000B7HXXE,"This little 52-minute British drama, made for Granada TV, highlights the generational conflict in Great Britain as a result of the sexual revolution, and at the early stages of gay liberation.

It stars Joyce Redman (so memorable in Tom Jones as the randy Mrs. Waters), the 'veddy propah' mother of a gay son, played by Rupert Frazer.  In fact, she is in complete denial about his sexuality, fixing him up with a series of 'nice' young woman.  Meanwhile, his incredibly beautiful live-in boyfriend (Nigel Havers) waits at home.

The story comes to a head when the meddling mother agrees to take care of their dog so they can go on holiday.  She arrives at their lovely flat in a desirable London townhouse (not too much stereotyping there).  Nigel is there alone, so the two talk uncomfortably.  Nigel is rather straight-forward about the relationship, and she hides behind her propriety.  When Rupert arrives, the air is cleared somewhat.  They announce their plans for the future together, and the word 'homosexual' is finally uttered out loud.  We get the impression it has been mentioned before, to no avail.  This time the boys stand their ground.

No doubt, many families have been through dramas, melodramas, and traumas just such as this.  The mother reluctantly seems to accept her son's true identity, though not without tears.  And, although the tone of this good little film is sometimes a bit overwrought, it is well-acted and compelling.  We may muse at being reminded how difficult it was to be open in 1985, but the societally-imposed struggles were genuine enough.",1255564800,,1581,4.9581749049429655
