7672734,5,B01C6S1PKM,"Our entire family enjoyed this film, which I recommend for anyone who enjoys a good laugh and a bit of mystery! The roles of all the kids are played very well and I'm sure the older guys will enjoy seeing Denise Richards (nothing too provocative, though).

The mysterious new neighbor has a ""monster"" in his basement...or does he? Thankfully, nothing preachy or totally ludicrous about O:NW; just fun and laughs for everyone.",1462752000,,425,4.902777777777778

8752398,1,B01C6S1PKM,"Amazed this is the first 1 star rating. If you're looking for a good family movie, this isn't it, at least the first 30 minutes . We couldn't finish the movie it was that bad. Acting seemed improvised at best. We got sucked into the 4 star rating. Had we known there were only 3 ratings at the time, would have waited.",1463875200,,318,4.145161290322581
