7828811,3,6302662818,This tape is OK but just Ok. Nothing really special. Does what it says it will and is an Ok addition to a collection. The worst thing was after I bought the tape I immediately saw the same tape for $1.00 at the Salvation Army store. With shipping and handling I paid a lot more than that. So you might want to check your local thrift stores first.,1320364800,,347,4.117647058823529
