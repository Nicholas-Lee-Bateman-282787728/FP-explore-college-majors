6194552,1,B00HP4W1NI,"I love zombie movies. Give me Dawn of the Dead, Evil Dead or anything remotely related and I'm good.

This movie, well, stinks. You've got a guy running around as an advertisement for fear.net, a guy pretending to be a Texan? I'm still not sure and a WHOLE BUNCH of over the top acting.

Low budget is the key here. Sure they had a tiny budget, but the film resolution is so terrible it looks like it was done with a camcorder from 1985.

The fight scenes aren't bad (really, they're the only redeeming factor) and the story has a lot of potential (Battle Royale meets zombies? Uh, yes please!) but this is bad.

In all honesty, this film looks like it was done by a couple of bros and their parent's video camera. The soundtrack sounds like it was part of some Muzak student's final project. Even the fight scenes are a little goofy. And really: the texan's accent? Please stop. Please.

I'd like the last hour and a half of my life back, please.",1405728000,2,947,4.357954545454546
6194553,3,B00HP4W1NI,"This movie is pretty entertaining, in a low budget sort of way.  Despite an outrageous depiction of an American game show host, who was so stupidly over the top it made me want to turn it off, I kept watching and was pleasantly surprised in some spots. Not so much in others.  BUT, the entertainment factor outweighed the moments where I wasn't, so I would say it was an okay movie.  But having said that the most annoying thing you will notice (besides the game show host) are technical issues with the sound.  I had to keep turning the television up and down to hear what was going on.  The description says it's a mix between Shaun of the Dead and Dawn of the Dead, I think that's a bit of a stretch. It's somewhere under those two. All in all though, good fight scenes, good premise (could have been done better), so/so zombies and some humor.  And I'd still recommend it because I was entertained.",1399248000,2,902,4.403614457831325
6194554,2,B00HP4W1NI,"So sad. I could have put up with bad acting, sound, camera work, storyline, or a combo of a few of these, but not all of them at once!
I love b movies, but I don't think this qualifies. I saw the trailer and thought well looks rough but maybe its a good story, like Slashers or Dead and Breakfast. Nope, just bad!",1397606400,5,313,3.984126984126984
6194555,4,B00HP4W1NI,"From award winning Irish filmmaker George Clarke comes THE KNACKERY. a fun twist on the reality game show format.
Alan Crawford is your host, in a Battle Royale style game show where a motley crew of misfits battle against a horde of Zombies for the big prize. Like THE LAST LIGHT and SPLASH AREA, Director Clarke takes a unfeasibly small budget (by small we mean less than 500.00) and comes up with an original, entertaining horror flick. At times comic (the cheesy elevator style music during the CCTV camera interludes is hilarious) is is also exciting, the fight scenes are expertly choreographed with an athleticism seen in Jackie Chan movies. The Zombie make-up is what it has to be, but all worn by an enthusiastic bunch of extras (one being Robert Render who can be seen in both movies above.) A lot of fun is had watching this movie. Its a surprise Hollywood have not tried to remake this,...l totally enjoyed this one.",1392854400,,928,4.699386503067485

6194562,3,B00HP4W1NI,"Not bad if you're a zombie fan, which I am.  Interesting premise, not much on special/make up effects, production values a little lacking.  Seems most of the budget went for gallons of fake blood which got spilled liberally.  Might have gone four stars, but I really despise fast zombies.",1441929600,,288,4.836734693877551
6194563,1,B00HP4W1NI,"Unfortunately it doesn't seem to be possible to give it less then one star. But it really deserves zero. Horrible camera work and cinematography.

6194566,5,B00HP4W1NI,"I disagree with the reviews saying this movie was poorly done. There was a ton of  parkour action in this film. (The art of running and jumping) I was entertained from start to finish.  The 'show announcer' was a cheesy , fake and annoying dude by design. When he would come on I would have such a strong desire to shut off the movie, but fortunately that characters appearances are short and should just be suffered through. As soon as the movie/game show resumed I could forget all about the annoying announcer. The action was intense and reminded me of the way Jacky Chan can jump through ladder rungs and such.  It came free with amazon prime, but had I paid money for this, I would not have regretted it.  I think the story line itself was more of an excuse to make a movie about parkour.",1439251200,,793,4.374149659863946

6194589,4,B00HP4W1NI,"The film production quality is poor and so are the special effects.  The sound value is low so you'll have to turn your TV to the highest setting to hear it well.  The music is overly dramatic and ridiculously cheesy at the same time.  The acting is ... wow, it's just BAD, especially the guy playing the host. Now, having said all that, if you can get to the 17 minute mark then you'll see some pretty decent fight scenes. They were choreographed well and executed with some degree of skill.

6194591,1,B00HP4W1NI,"If this was an actually war movie (like Saving Private Ryan or Black Hawk Down), I would give it more stars.  This movie has a dark humor in it and it does not really appeal to me.  Who comes up with the stuff?  It has a lot of graphic blood portrayed mostly through use of zombies - I guess you could call them that - that cut and maim their victims to death.  If you thought Hunger Games was okay, this would be something a little worse than that movie.

It appears low budget and it doesn't have a lot diversity.  If you're looking for vehicle chases or vehicle action, firearm action, explosions and other neat weapons this is not the movie for you to see because this movie has none of that.  Aside from that the movie has very good or excellent hand-to-hand or close-quarters fighting scenes.",1415577600,,798,4.351351351351352
