8454851,3,B0052Z7KO2,"For the record this is not really based on the book.  If you're looking for a true to the book adaptation or a semi-true to the book adaptation this is not it.  This is a cute Saturday morning cartoon.  If you're looking for the sheer nostalgia of it all or if you're a huge NDDP/HOND fan like myself, then this is a pretty good show.  It's light, cute and I recommend watching it in your pajamas while eating your favorite childhood cereal on a Saturday morning.
Is it up to today's cartoon standards?  No.
It's a goofy kids show.  If you're looking to watch this for story or artistic value don't.  Like I said, it's a good buy for purely nostalgic value.  Or if you're like me and must have all things NDDP/HOND.",1377734400,2,715,4.323308270676692
8454852,5,B0052Z7KO2,"I never got to see this as a kid, but can say it was much better than I was anticipating. Originally, I imagined Quasimodo would be stuck to duties around the castle ringing the bell as he was portrayed in some of the movies, but this Quasimodo is daring, brave and very considerate of others on his adventures across the land, facing off against many creatures, villains and his evil Nemesis magician, who is constantly trying to put an end to Quasimodo and his two friends, the lovely Gypsy and the comical poem singer. Quasimodo doesn't let his hunchback ruin his life, as he overlooks what others think of him and focuses on his strengths and goals. A truly inspiring character.

The animation is good and Saturday morning standard. The scenery is purely medieval, and appealed to one of my favorite series traits, the Gummi Bears, offering plenty of castles, hay stacks, rolling hills, forests, rivers, caves and more. Every episode kept my attention, thanks to the well done voice acting, music and creative storytelling.

Despite some minor flaws such as one episode having a double voice track where a spanish track is heard beneath the English voice over, and not presenting the DVD's in their own DVD snap lock spots (they're in folder windows in a boxed portion of the DVD case, which I've since put in my own dual DVD package for better preservation) the series looks great overall and I'd say is worth the 14.99$ for many, many hours of entertainment. This is actually one of the better cartoons series I've seen in my life, having grown up in the classic Golden age of Cartoons in the 1980's.

A great show worth a purchase. 10 hours and 2 minutes of fun adventure.",1320192000,2,1679,4.684745762711865
