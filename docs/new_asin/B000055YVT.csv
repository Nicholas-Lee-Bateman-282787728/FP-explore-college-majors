1395390,3,B000055YVT,"Robert Altman's latest ensemble piece opens with a scene that basically fills in the background from which the rest of the film will spring. In a gynecologist's office in Dallas, his upscale clients are fighting tooth and nail to get into his stirrups. The roving camera shows us high society Southern belles in sequined suits and extravagant hats ready to claw the eyes out of each other's heads to get the undivided attention of his staff. That din of shrieking women is Dr. T.'s life.
Richard Gere plays Dr. Sullivan ""Sully"" Travis, a man with a few too many problems. His wife (Farah Fawcett) has succumbed to a condition called the Hestia Complex that leaves her in a mental hospital after a nude frolic in a shopping mall fountain. His two daughters Connie (Tara Reid) and Dee Dee (Kate Hudson) are hashing out the details of the latter's upcoming wedding. Connie is flunking out of Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders training camp. Dee Dee's interests might lie elsewhere. His sister-in-law Peggy (Laura Dern) is divorcing her husband and has, with three matching kids, moved into his home. His office manager Carolyn (Shelley Long) thinks she may have just what the ole doc needs. And the new golf instructor in town (Helen Hunt) is just too interesting to keep out of his mind for more then 10 minutes. All in a day's work.
Of course Altman is known for these sort of huge casts and can often handle them very well indeed (MASH, Short Cuts, etc), but lately he hasn't come up with a big winner. Last year's Cookie's Fortune is probably his best of late and, while very watchable, Dr. T. pales in comparison to even that modest success. Both films are set in the South and feature a lot of local flavor. Being a native Dallasite myself, I don't think you can make a film based here without mentioning Tom Landry - it's probably a local ordinance. Altman also definitively identifies Dallas' alpha male culture with golf, patio grills, hunting, football and, of course, women.
I'd have to agree with Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly when he says, ""This may be the last place in America where feminism and chivalry could still be duking it out."" I always open the door for a woman (and hold it for any more that may be coming). I wouldn't cuss in casual conversation with a woman I didn't know, although I probably would with a man. And I don't personally like women who drink or have tattoos either. I say all this to give you an indication of the way most men are raised in Texas and Altman has captured that perfectly.
Sully is a guy who just wants his life to settle down and let him catch a breath. Mainly that means his daughters and sister-in-law, a blonde trio that harries him with every demand and never manages a thought outside their own little social circle. While provocative, the women that torture him never really become full fledged characters. Even Liv Tyler who shows up as the bridesmaid from Houston has only a few words in the entire film, none of which give us a hint as to who she is. The one person who might save him (and the film) is Helen Hunt but her role as the one rock steady female in the story is cut short in the effort to include so many of the others.
While Gere does an admirable job as the decent, honest and confused man, Altman just doesn't give us enough time to get to know these folks. He's sure to do better in the future (as he has in the past), but at least Dr. T.
is an interesting failure. The final scene seems like a return nod to P.T. Anderson's Magnolia, which was fun to see but probably my favorite part was Laura Dern's three little girls. All dressed alike and on their little leashes. It reminds me of two kids I met while in high school. Their knucklehead parents actually named the twin boy and girl ""Cotton"" and ""Candy"". This, dear friends, can only happen in Texas.",976492800,9,3834,4.525936599423631

Confusion, patience,impatience all put on Dr. T by every woman he sees, his family,his practice, and friends. You have to feel for the poor man, who really tries to understand women.

1395403,4,B000055YVT,"Being female and having spent a good deal of my doctor visits in gynecologists office, this movie could be viewed as a satire of a gynecologists practice. One office that I used to go to was fabulously busy and crowded and impossible to get through on the phone and everyone was waiting to see Dr. X, who also had numerous females working for him, including secretaries, nurses and other female doctors. I never once saw a male in that office and every seat was filled sometimes with standing room only.  Sound familiar? Only the hair color and the social class of the patients were different from the movie.  Furthermore a lot of these gynecologists, now mostly female could take a lesson from the kind and compassionate dr. Travis. I wish all Drs. We're like that.
In any case the movie was enjoyable and interesting to watch especially with the all star cast which included Richard Gere as Dr T, Farrah fawcett, Helen hunt, Laura dern, liv tyler, Kate Hudson and others.",1468195200,,973,4.684210526315789
1395404,1,B000055YVT,"Monotonous. Poor plot. I like Richard Gere, Farrah Fawcett and Helen Hunt, but even the all star cast could not save the horrible writing.",1467590400,,138,4.791666666666667
1395405,5,B000055YVT,"First of all note, that I gave this movie FIVE STARS because this movie provides an excellent textbook example of how to make a stinky movie.  DR. T AND THE WOMEN is a 122 minute color movie, taking place in the present era.  The plot concerns only people in the upper-social class.  Richard Gere plays a gynecologist (""Sullivan Travis"").  Farrah Fawcett plays his wife (""Kate Travis""). The couple of two daughters, played by Tara Reid and Kate Hudson.  Helen Hunt plays a golfer with the first name, ""Bree.""  The movie uses various techniques that work together to produce a stinky movie.  In my opinion, the presence of even one of these techniques could create a stinky movie.  Because of the presence of so many poor cinematographic techniques and poor script-writing techniques used in this film, the result is a movie that is UNBEARABLY STINKY.  What makes this movie so excellent, is that so many cinematographic mistakes and script-making mistakes are tied together in a tidy package, that the movie provides an excellent teaching device on what mistakes to avoid when making a movie.  Here is a partial list of the bad techniques:

(1) PLOT GETS SNOWED UNDER.  The main plot, or anyway, what is supposed to be the main plot, is that Farrah Fawcett somehow acquires a psychiatric disorder.  In short, she takes off all of her clothes and prances about in a fountain in an upscale shopping mall.  The movie shows that this takes place next to a store called, ""Godiva Chocolates.""  Ha, ha, ha, this could be the only clever part of the entire movie.  Discriminating gentleman will not complain too much, at the full-frontal sight of Farrah Fawcett's ta-tas.  Some of the plot concerns Farrah Fawcett's character receiving treatment in a psychiatric ward.  However, issue of Farrah Fawcett's psychiatric disorder gets lost and snowed under by many other scenes and episodes in the movie.  There are scenes on a golf course.  There are scenes in a cheerleader's dancing class.  There are many scenes with cell phones.  Cell phones, cell phones, cell phones.  There are too many fricking cell phone scenes in this movie.  I am under the impression that the entire movie is some sort of bizarre advertisement for SAMSUNG cell phones.  Then, there are many scenes in Richard Gere's office, and there are many jokey episodes about gynecological exams.  Ha, ha, ha, oh how funny.  Hee-hee-hee, ha-ha-ha.  The end result is that the issue of Farrah Fawcett's psychiatric condition gets snowed under and lost.  Truly, this is a movie without any plot.

(2) UNBELIEVABLE PLOT.  Assuming that the plot in this movie is Farrah Fawcett's psychiatric condition, what detracts from this movie is the fact that the disorder is imaginary and hardly enough to draw the viewer's sympathy or attention.  The disorder is called, ""Hestia Complex.""  In this complex, the female victim takes leave of her senses and retreats into childhood. Hestia complex affects only upper-class women who are loved too much and have everything they need.  Hestia Complex also results in the victim to lose all interest in concupiscent behavior (lack of interest in ""doing it"").  At any rate, this unbelievable feature of the plot did not make me more interested in the movie.  This feature of the plot only caused me to view the movie as stupid and as a plot component that a high school student might have dreamed up during recess.

(3) JOKES ABOUT PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S ASSASSINATION.  The movie includes a scene where a tour guide is explaining details of the assassination of President Kennedy.  The character in the movie refers to President Kennedy's head being ""blown up.""  I was in seventh grade at the time of the assassination.  It occurred during lunch hour at my middle school.  There was a television in the main office of my school, which at that time was called Queen Anne High School.  A couple of the female students watching the television news story were crying.  And so, the joke about President Kennedy's head being ""blown up"" has the effect of causing the movie, DR. T AND THE WOMEN, to be a movie that is disgusting, repugnant, and immoral.

(4) ROBERT ALTMAN'S TECHNIQUE.  Robert Altman created the cinematographic technique of using extensive overdubbing to create overlapping, simultaneous conversations.  This technique is used boldly at the very beginning of the movie.  But the technique is continued, now and then, at various points in the movie.  This technique is annoying.  Use of this annoying technique once, might be fine.  However, use of this technique again and again causes the movie to be annoying.

(5) RUNNING JOKE REPEATED TOO MUCH.  Helen Hunt plays a golfer.  Her first name is ""Bree.""  A running joke in this movie is that her name sounds like the name of a type of French cheese.  First of all, please note that this is not a funny joke.  Second, please note that repeating a funny joke over and over again is annoying, and that repeating a non-funny joke over and over again is even more annoying.

CONCLUSION.  It is no wonder that DR. T & THE WOMEN was a box office bomb.  I give this movie FIVE STARS because it is such an excellent example of cinematographic mistakes that should be avoided when writing a script or when directing.",1466208000,2,5250,4.872171945701357

Shelly Long and Farrah Fawcett gave very warm and poignant portrayals of women trying to cope with their situations in the best way they knew.  Laura Dern was fabulous in all her southern boozy splendor.  Dona Granata did a visually luscious job with the costumes. The ending, however, took me out of the moment and became sort of surreal.  It didn't fit the rest of the story line.  If the ending had been different, this movie probably would have made it even bigger because there was some top-of-the-line acting here.

1395438,5,B000055YVT,"""Dr. T and the Women"" is a surreal caricature about a prestigious gynecologist and the socialite patients he is surrounded by, as well as his all female family members, his female staff, and a professional female golfer he has an affair with.  Although some could say it is a sexist movie, because the movie focuses primarily on superficial and needy female characters, his small group of male friends doesn't appear to be any better.  The only character that has any sense of normalcy and depth is Dr. T.

The story was confusing, silly and unedited. Nothing held together. In one scene Richard Gere and his car are tossed about in a twister storm (Dorothy in OZ) the car is totaled, and Dr. T comes thru unharmed and then walks away from his crashed car,  He then washes his hands and delivers a baby somewhere in Mexico speaking a moronic Spanish. If it weren't so utterly stupid and impossible, it wouldn't  be as embarrassing to the actors as it I'm sure it had to be.",1463616000,,544,4.42

1395565,5,B000055YVT,"I liked this movie. Richard Gere of course is awesome, as usual. What a phenomenal actor. This is a very different movie. Has many top notch actors/actresses. The viewer instantly bonds with Dr. T., he's Mr. Perfect. He is a Gynecologist with a busy schedule, with a gorgeous home. But he has sadness in his life. His wife (Farrah Faucet) has some kind of dimentia or mental breakdown going and it breaks his heart. She even goes to an asylum to try to get healed. It's laughable how busy Dr. T's waiting room is. Women get ancy waiting, the nurses and receptionists try to hold down the fort. Sometimes family comes in to talk with him then his schedule gets really behind. This is a very caring man with a busy life, with 2 grown daughters. And one is getting married soon, so wedding plans are happening. Dr. T. meets someone at the Golf Club and they bond. It is a good movie. Lots going on and the ending was quite different. You'll love this. I recommend it. There are ups and downs, unexpected things. The only thing that kind of bothered me was how noisy the waiting room got with everyone talking at once and they had background music. It was a little distracting.

Overly quirky Texas caricatures rendered by somebody who has zero understanding of Texas women. No end of ""overtalking"" or dialogue battles where every character talks at the same time, creating a cacophony where the viewer isn't sure which conversation is important enough to tune into.

Exhausting to watch, and I mean that in the worst way. You can't cast your way out of a bad script, but Bob sure tried to camouflage this stinker by throwing every relevant actress from the past four decades at the screen and seeing who stuck.

As it turns out? Nobody stuck. There are no redeeming characters except Dr. T himself, and he was a Neutrogena peel-thin representation of the evolved male psyche. Dr. T was the characterization of the man women THINK they want. Ironic that every woman in the movie rejected him in the end. Or not ironic.",1461628800,,946,4.7272727272727275

1395975,4,B000055YVT,"Robert Altman's ""Dr. T and the Women"" (2002) is an ensemble dramedy with some romance detailing an overworked, socially-in-demand gynecologist (Richard Gere) in Dallas who faces problems with an assortment of women beyond his practice. His daughter, Dee Dee (Kate Hudson) - a Dallas Cowboy cheerleader - is getting married, but his younger daughter (Tara Reid) drops the ball that Dee Dee's a lesbian having a relationship with a former co-ed (Liv Tyler). Worse, his wife (Farrah Fawcett) reverts to a child-like state and is, consequently, placed in a mental institution. Desperate for love, the doctor turns to an independent golf pro for succor (Helen Hunt). Meanwhile, his sister-in-law is an alcoholic (Laura Dern) and his office manager is in lust with him (Shelly Long).

This movie has a horrible reputation, but it's actually not bad as long as you're in the mood for a drama with amusing touches. It's far from great, but it's certainly not bad. Gere is very likable in the title role and bends over backwards to help all the women in his life. The women are likable too, although many of the peripheral ones are somewhat annoying.

I find the criticism that the film is ""misogynistic"" funny in light of the fact that the screenplay was written by a woman, Anne Rapp. Others argue that the story's pointless and the ending is ridiculously unbelievable. While the latter point is true, this IS a dramedy/satire and not everything is SUPPOSED to be strictly realistic. As to the former criticism, just enjoy the ride and reflect on the plot and subplots. You may not agree with its points, and they may be elusive, but it's not pointless.

While I like the film and it contains scores of beautiful women, I'm only giving it a marginal ""thumbs up"" because they could've done better on this front considering the wealth of resources they had to work with, not to mention the opening credits sequence is noticeably overlong and dull. Interestingly, the ending graphically details the birth of a baby -- a male.

The film runs 122 minutes and was shot in the Dallas area.

1395981,1,B000055YVT,"Directed by Robert Altman.  Rated ""R"".  Running Time: 2 hours, 01 min.

In Dallas, Texas, a senior woman (Jeanne Evans) is on the examination table for her gynecologists appointment. Dr. T (Richard Gere) is using the medical equipment to examine her. As he shines some light on the subject, she tries to talk to him about his family to stay relaxed.
  Dr. T's office is full of women. The employees are woman and the patients are well-to-do upper class women who just can't wait to see the doctor.
  His obnoxious nurse, Carolyn (Shelley Long) tries to keep everything in order, but bugs him to much. Dr. T needs a moment to himself.
  What is a doctor to do?  He has more trouble with his wife, Kate (Farrah Fawcett), when she wanders off in the mall and is found naked in a fountain.

Also in the cast: Tara Reid, Laura Dern, Kate Hudson, Robert Hays, Andy Richter, Janine Turner, Helen Hunt, Lee Grant, Liv Tyler.

I enjoyed Jeanne Evans performance as the first patient.

Music by Lyle Lovett.

 Filmed in Dallas, Texas and Silurian Dry Lake, Mojave Desert, California.

Movie shows the Texas School Book Depository, now the Dallas County Administration Building and also the ""X"" in Elm Street where approximately  President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963.

Janine Turner, who played ""Dorothy"" wore a red outfit that reminded me of what Elizabeth Shephard wore in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Damien-Omen-II/dp/B00096S48K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Damien: Omen II</a>&nbsp;(1978).

It is only at this point, that he has her committed. So here's Kate, wife of handsome, passive-submissive gynecologist husband, together having produced the most superficial aimless offspring, living in a world of feathers and ceaseless yaking females.  Kate is the one who escapes.

Even though I have not read the story in decades, (and have always had extremely poor recall), Charlotte Perkins Gilman's short story, 'The Yellow Wallpaper', came to mind immediately.

I kept thinking that Bree, the golf pro bedmate, was either A} going to brutally murder Doc T for some heinous wrongdoing to a sister, or B) That when the Doc comes to find her and sweep her off to mad adventure, he would find her with another woman.  Nah. That would be too interesting.  Instead, it turns out she's just your stereotypical male golf pro in a woman's body.

If the movie had centered on Kate's escape from the miserable people and culture of her world, with all else swirling about her - the real madness - and showing her sane and free at the end - the movie would have been good, and possibly, great.

Questions:  Why didn't Doc T lock the door when Bree comes to his office - (she comes to his office during office hours!), and they're fooling around.  Seems to me he wanted to be caught and punished -- soundly, and, probably with a paddle, because
Doc T is a submissive if ever there was one.  His friends are ignorant, passive dullards; they're always shown hunting.  They can't shoot anything.  When Doc T finally gets a shot - get this -- wait for it -- his gun isn't loaded.  There you go.

She does do a nude scene in the shopping mall's water fountain. The other cast is in small scenes as well, with maybe the exception of Helen Hunt. Shelly Long is funny in her role as Richard Gere's assistant, who is secretly in love with him. The lesbian sequence should have been eliminated because it was very small and didn't add much to the plot of the movie. But then again, the movie doesn't really have much plot. Anyway, if you are a Farrah fan and want to collect all of her movies, add this to your collection in her memory. However, I for one am glad that I only spent $1.99 for this dvd. Sorry to the Robert Altman's fans.",1255737600,,965,4.396648044692737
1396010,3,B000055YVT,"This movie starred Richard Gere as Dr T, a Dallas Texas based gynecologist with a way with women -- until they all get to be too much for him. It would have been way better if it had been called Mr T and the women, and if Mr T had played the character he created for the ""A"" Team, B.A. Baracus, as a Dallas, Texas based gynecologist. When Dr T's wife, Kate (Farrah Fawcett), took off her clothes and swam in the shopping mall fountain, he would have just looked at her and said ""Shut up, fool. You ain't no fish."" As the women of Dallas made plans for Dr T's daughter's wedding, it seemed like they were taking over the world. You couldn't swing a dead cat without hitting a dysfunctional blonde pre menstrual or post menopausal woman. Mr T would have summed up the situation and said something pithy and insightful, like ""I pity the fool who goes out tryin' a' take over da world, then runs home cryin' to her momma!""

Or what if the Dr T had been Dr. Terwilliker, from The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T., who had an insane plan to enslave 500 boys in his Piano Academy and force them to practice 24/7 on his magnificent piano? With a script by Dr. Seuss, and starring Hans Conried as Dr. Terwilliker! Take Dr. Terwilliker, and make him a gynecologist instead of a piano teacher, set the whole thing in Texas. Can't you just imagine Dr. T. singing ""I want my lavender spats!"" out on the Texas range? That would have been Atomic. VERY atomic!

Instead of that magnificent spectacle we are forced to settle for second Gere and Altman's workaday mise-en-scne. At first Gere is a doctor who thinks women are the best thing since sliced bread, but Dr T grows to despise them as their needs, imagined ailments, and, as Dr Terwilliker would say, their ""idiotic cock-eyed flum-dummery"" overwhelms him.

This film is chock full of beautiful and talented women, like Farrah Fawcett, Laura Dern, Shelley Long, Kate Hudson, Tara Reid and Liv Tyler, but it doesn't really like women. The film is a mysoginist. Only Helen Hunt escapes its hellish fury, as a golf pro who toys with Dr T, but then tosses him aside, just like a man would do. Dr T says he is attracted to her because she wasn't like all the other women. If she was a woman who acted like a man, that would explain a lot, Dr Freud.

Was the scene of Kate Hudson practicing her routine with the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders merely gratuitous, or was it integral to the plot? I would have to go with merely gratuitous. Or how about the scene where Kate Hudson and Liv Tyler make out? Once again, gratuitous. But as long as we're being gratuitous... Liv Tyler isn't the only one who wished they would have used more tongue and ""gone for it.""

The ending seems not only preposterous, but is also patronizing. I won't give it away, but suffice it to say that Gere's Dr T  still thinks he is god's gift to women, but in reality women have been having babies without any help (apart from a small initial investment) from men for thousands of years.

Hannibal: B.A., there's an old saying - ""The best defense is a good offense.""
B.A. Baracus: You got that wrong, man. A good offense is the best defense.
Hannibal: Okay, have it your way.

Back when I saw this movie in the theatres years ago, I was with friends.  I wanted to cry!  I couldn't believe I wasted $8.00 on a ticket and almost two hours of my life with this rotten flick.  Unfortunately, since it was considered socially unacceptable to get up and walk out of the theatre I sat through the ENTIRE painful film.

Even then, I thought that no movie could ever come close to being this horrendous, including those made at home by a high schooler.  I believe, to this day, my assumption is correct.  For every bad movie I see, I can say, ""Well, at least it wasn't as bad as Dr. T and The Women.""

No redeeming qualities about this movie at all. Sadly, I'm amazed at some of the reviewers saying that it is worth it to see Farrah Fawcett or Helen Hunt naked. And you admit this freely? Put away the tissues and get out of your parent's basement right now! The rest of you, avoid this. Despite some great actors and a reknowned director, this is not good. No characters to like - not one, a ridiculous plot, and an ending that is satisfying only because it is the rotten cherry on this terrible cake, so at least the ending is as bad as the rest of it.

In one scene in ""Dr. T and the Women,"" one of the doctor's daughters comes in his office, which is hectic and busy all day, and wants a few minutes to tell him his other daughter is a lesbian.  Any child who had grown up with a physician father, or any father with a hectic, high pressure job, would know better than to go to his work place and ask for a few minutes to drop a bomb on him.  They would choose the weekend, or at the very least, a week night to have a heart-to-heart.  If you're going to make a big mess of a movie, at least have it be realistic.

With the great cast, you would think no way this film COULD be bad.  This movie is so bad its almost unbelievable.  Like another reviewer said, its not even funny bad.  Its just bad.",1124323200,11,907,4.166666666666667

1396030,1,B000055YVT,"Let me preface this by saying there's a fine line between a bad movie and a horrible movie. Bad movies are often funny to watch, cheaply made shtick. Then there' horrible movies that are meant to be very serious and have potential and then are really awful.

This movie, is the latter of the two.

Looking at the cast one says ""Whoa, this movie must rock!"". Sadly it doesn't even summon up a pebble, let alone a whole rock.

The actors barely get a chance to act. The plot is thin and boring. This isn't even a thinking mans movie, or a chick flick, or a sexy flick. It's so bad the only thing I could classify it as is ""other: morbidly boring and inane"".

Not to give away the nonexistent story but Gere plays a middle aged OB/GYN whose family is highly dysfunctional and getting worse by the day. His teenage daughters are driving him crazy and his wife (who already is crazy) is no consolation. He turns to the new, sexy and attractive golf pro at his country club, played by Helen Hunt. The affair seems forced and rather uninteresting. Honestly the high point of the film is you see Hunt take off her blouse from a distance, but even this rather sexy scene ends without offering a saving grace to this film.

The movie ends in a sort of quasi ""Kubrik"" dreamesque sequence where Gere drives into a hurricane and gets swept off to OZ, no wait that would have been more entertaining. He lands in Mexico (though why it looks like Mexico of the early 1700's I'll never know) and there delivers a baby boy. The movie ends with that highly ridiculous and pointless highlight as if the director was trying to say, ""Ah heck, I give up"".

Very disappointing throughout and overall a waste of time and film. I hope I saved you 2 hours of time by writing this review, I'd hate for anyone to have to sit through this like I did.",1117065600,11,1820,4.353982300884955

She just appeared to be ""acting"" her role...she did not at all come off as being natural...(naturally drunk.. maybe)but not natural in her ability. The rest of the cast i thought did at least some justice to their roles; despite not dealing with the greatest script ever written....The one thing  that i've heard some of the women say in response to this movie is that the women are portrayed in a very negative light...that they are portrayed as irrational, stupid, self-centered, unreasonable chattering hens etc. But the last time i checked..lampooning characters.. and giving them bloated chacteristics has been the VERY common thread used in comedies..dating all the way back to the Greek Comedies/Dramas. It's all a part of the satirical nature and narrative. What? attempt a comedy with completely ""normal"" characters? How does that work? Please enlighten me..What i find absurdly ridiculous is the blatant hypocrisy with the womens attitudes'. Keeping things in perspective...when the table is turned and it is the men in movies who are shown as irrational, dim , lazy, stupid..etc.( understandibly in a comedic context)and in contrast..the women are depicted as levelheaded, sensitve human beings, these same women don't voice their displeasure about these circumstances. So, it would seem that some women can't tolerate dirisiveness of other women..but it's completely tolerable if it involves men...hypocrisy, hypocrisy, hypocrisy...Anyway, i'd still recommend this movie.",1113264000,,1601,5.455645161290323
1396032,1,B000055YVT,"I'm going to have to agree with most of the previous reviewers and say that this film is indeed VERY BAD!

Dr T & The Women, brings to the screen the story of a gynecologist in Texas who has to deal with problems regarding both his personal and professional life.

The major setback is in relation to the plot (or lack of it); that is to say that the story is beyond words...  School plays (and pre-school for that matter) have better plots!

It is truly sad...

In short, it is a weak plot/storyline, lacking originality while being VERY predictable, not to mention the not-so-hidden messages that it is trying to convey, and for which the writers and director are to blame.

The only positive aspect of the movie was that it did have the potential to be better considering the makeup of the cast, which includes Richard Gere, Liv Tyler, Farrah Fawcett, Kate Hudson, and Helen Hunt among others!

In short, it could have been so much better if the writers/director had the ability to... write and direct!  A shame really...",1111017600,8,1024,4.587912087912088
1396033,2,B000055YVT,"Dr T and the Women is about a GYN and his dealings with the many women that are in his life; his daughters, his wife, his secretary, his new love interest, and not to mention the many female patients that go to his practice.
The movie sets up everything that is going on in Dr T's life; his daughter is getting married but finds out she is a lesbian, his other daughter is obsessed with JFK, his wife has a mental disorder that causes her to act like a kid and therefore really can't be his wife anymore, his secretary is in love with him, his patients almost tear the place down every day trying to get in to see him, and his dealings with his new love interest (Helen Hunt).
Things eventually go so crazy that he can't take it anymore. At the beginning of the movie, he makes a statement about understanding women and what they want, but after the movie's climax, he realizes that he doesn't know a thing and seems to conclude that women are crazy and unpredictable. Really, I think that's probably what the movie is all about and could be stated as the theme for the entire film.
This movie had a teriffic lineup of characters and actors to play them. The story wasn't too bad either. My problem is with the ending; it's inconclusive, unsatisfying, and anti-climatic. That's being nice. And yes, the ending is that important to a film like this. 2 stars. I felt cheated, in a way.",1072396800,4,1383,4.385214007782102
1396034,3,B000055YVT,"Like much of Robert Altman's work, this one's quite a hit and miss movie, but worth seeing for some good performances, a handful of genuinely funny scenes, and some of the master's typical ensemble sequences with all hell breaking loose while everybody talks at once. It is probably unhelpful to approach it as though it was a full-blooded satire on wealthy Texas women. For a start, the target is too easy - like the floating and walking birds Dr T and his buddies seem to think it's fair to shoot at - and in any case the focus of the film is not the Women of the title, but Dr T.
Richard Gere gives a typically charming and understated, performance as Dr Travis, who is surrounded by women whom he likes and respects in private life, and cares for in his professional life as a gynecologist, but no more understands than most men. Farrah Fawcett gives a touching portrayal as his wife, who retreats into childhood to escape his smothering affection. Helen Hunt, an independently-minded intelligent golf pro, provides a refreshing change - both for Dr T and the audience - from the empty-headed shopaholics who people much of the movie. Laura Dern, Kate Hudson and Shelley Long sparkle as, respectively, Dr T's sister-in-law, daughter and receptionist. As we might expect from Altman, the city of Dallas also plays a leading role; and the best casting is definitely that of Eric Ryan as the ""birth baby"".
What probably made the movie the flop that it turned out to be was that in a typical Altman way (Pret A Porter?) it meanders on and on, with quite a few side-plots introduced (including an aging ex-wife who obviously has health problems but we never find out if they're mental or physical), but the movie never really comes to a point, nor do we see any sensible conclusion to the side-plots. And, the ending is so far-fetched it borders on the realm of sci-fi/fantasy, especially if you know ANYTHING about the geography of Texas or the Southern United States.
If you approach it with the programmed expectations of a typical audience, you'll be disappointed. This is a long way from the vintage Altman of Mash, Nashville and The Player. But, it is still richer than most Hollywood fare and would probably make a decent rental.",1071360000,5,2235,4.704081632653061

I know what it was trying to say but it was such a cop out, and it left hanging quite a great deal with all the characters we had come to know throughout the course of the film.  This is one of those movies where I can understand why my friends don't like Altman.  *See Nashville, The Long Goodbye, The Player.  Those are his best films.",1063152000,6,587,4.043478260869565
1396054,1,B000055YVT,"The doctor Gere plays in this movie should be a dentist, because that is what this movie is like, going to see the dentist.  This movie has absolutely no energy or pacing behind it at all.  Director Robert Altman makes it look like a bad 70's movie, scenes leading nowhere, characters that often just complain, a ""realistic"" environment, and a complete lack of any cohesive plot.  A half hour into it makes you feel as if you've been watching it all day.  The movie is so bad it not only makes you bored, but mad at it as well, mad, too, that  a piece of drek like this can even be made in the first place, with actual money spent on it, when other decent ideas are probably sitting on shelves in Hollywood.  How so many stars managed to appear in it is a mystery to me.  I can just hear their agents:  ""You'll be working with Robert Altman, don't worry about the script!""  Well, somebody should have.  Altman even managed to talk Farrah Fawcett into a brief ""artful"" nude scene, I can just picture that conversation, too:  ""It's art, Farrah!""  The characters she, Gere and others play simply don't work at all.  Here is a movie who's faults lay squarely on the shoulders of the director.  If Altman had any talent to his work at all (I'm not convinced he ever had), then it's all gone dry now. This movie does have one distinction:  many movies make you bored with them, very few make you actually hate them.  This one certainly does.",1049500800,10,1435,4.399239543726236

Unfortunately, he tries to say it ALL in this one movie, with inconsistant results. Richard Gere is at his charming best as the put-upon titled Gynecologist trying to remain the calm center of the chaotic estrogen storm around him. Gere's on screen romantic chemistry with golf pro Helen Hunt is undeniable, and props also to Shelley Long, in excellent form as the good doctor's dedicated nurse (no, really, Shelley Long). With all this riding for it though, ""Dr. T"" does itself in by dragging on too long and getting bogged down in an unnecessary subplot about his daughter's wedding. Somewhere inside this tedium is a great movie trying desperately to get out. What a shame Altman can't thin out all his ideas to find it.",1047427200,2,875,4.7631578947368425
1396056,1,B000055YVT,"My wife and I picked this movie off the rental store shelf purely off it's star-power. We figured, ""How can eight marquee-level stars all be wrong?"" After watching the film, we had to ask, ""How did eight marquee-level stars get duped into appearing in this dreck?""
I'm flabbergasted to find Dr. T was written by a woman.  Why?  Think of any negative female stereotype, and this film screams it into an amplified bullhorn.  Without exception, ALL the female characters are completely neurotic, ludicrously overdressed, blindly self-absorbed, and chatter incessantly about nothing of substance whatsoever, often several characters at a time crescendoing into a mind-grating cacophony.  (Is this supposed to be avant garde?  'Cause in fact, it's just plain annoying.)  Even Helen Hunt, who at first appears to be the female gender's saving grace and Dr. T's calm in the midst of this maelstrom, (Look out! Don't let me ""ruin"" it for you... if that's possible) turns out to be a man-eater.  Dr. T lovingly states he trusts all women because they're ""natural saints"", but not a single woman in this movie has earned that badge.
Enter Dr. T: The Rock of Gibraltar, the only character with more substance than a french fry.  Nothing phases him; not when his wife gets naked in a crowded shopping center and thus is committed to an insane asylum (because, as her psychoanalyst so sincerely puts it, Dr. T. just loved her too much -- puh-LEEZE!), not when his daughter runs into the arms of her lesbian lover rather than her fiancee - at her wedding no less (who didn't see THAT coming?), not when hordes of sex-starved and under-appreciated women clamor into his office almost daily, and no, not even a Texas tornado. That's right. Dr. T. survives being sucked out of his convertable by a tornado that would've made Dorothy and Toto proud and is deposited somewhere in Latin America -- without a scratch!  He literally gets up, dusts himself off, and follows some Spanish speaking children to a remote Latin village just in time to deliver a baby (and yeah, they show EVERYTHING).  Dr. T is Superman!
The suspension of disbelief required for this self-indulgent waste of celluloid is going to break the bell curve.  The characters are all cracked, and the story so schizophrenic, I felt like *I* should be committed!  Please, instead of cursing your own poor video-box-reading judgement like I have been, do something comparatively constructive.  Like watching infomercials.",1044057600,12,2466,4.985365853658537

1396059,3,B000055YVT,"If you have even a passing knowledge of the cinema, then it should come as no surprise that a Robert Altman movie is by definition, as the Amazon critic above has noted,  a ""loose-limbed"" affair.  His modus operandi is to get together a talented cast, give them the outlines of a scene and let them improvise a good deal of it.  Sometimes it works brilliantly (MASH, NASHVILLE, McCABE & MRS MILLER) and sometimes it falls flat, but even when he stumbles, he is at least interesting. DR. T. & THE WOMEN is not one of his great successes, but it isn't quite the failure that a lot of the reviewers below (and elsewhere) suggest.
If this movie was marketed as a light comedy and not as another Altman experiment, then it is understandable that a good chunk of the viewing audience would feel like they've been ripped off.  There are many comic--and some downright loopy--moments, but this is not a hardy har har Hollywood comedy, or even a rambunctious nouvelle-comedie a la the Farrellys.  I don't even know if it really should be called  ""a barbed social commentary,"" since that term doesn't really seem to do justice to Altman's jaundiced worldview.  The oft-cited misogyny is actually a more-inclusive misanthropy (hey, those duck hunters aren't exactly appealing either).  As for Gere's Dr. T himself, he is, as others have noted, charming, affable, and seemingly on top of the world--until his world falls apart at the proverbial seams.  Through it all, Gere maintains something of his own (I imagine) real-life Buddhist serenity, until he doesn't.  It's a an intriguing performance by an often underrated actor.
The film's abrupt non-sequitor dreamlike ending evokes THE WIZARD OF OZ, only with Mexicans instead of Munchkins.  It's also reminiscent of another Altman film about women, 1977's brooding, poetic THREE WOMEN, which also ended in a dreamy idyll. Both seem to have something to do with escape from your stereotypical ""American Dream turned nightmare,"" both seem somehow too to end up in some poetic realm beyond such notions.",1038182400,8,2040,4.9530791788856305

There is so much to this movie, it will keep you thinking about it for days! Dr T has a picture in his mind of what women are like, what they need and in every scene in this movie he is more and more startled about how little he really knows and finally does come to the right conclusion without even really knowing it: Every woman is different and has something that makes her different from the rest. If you watch the movie with this quote, later repeated in the movie, you'll understand what the director is getting at here. I loved the contrast between the woman's world and the man's world depicted here, and the suggestion about the importance of balance in the big scheme of things. The undertone is that woman are complex, you cannot possibly understand them, or generalize what they need and crave, and the twists in the plot repeated in this movie are Dr T's disillusion with what he thought he knew about the women in his life until his whole ideology (he frequently dishes out advice to everybody) is finally unravled and he spins out into a final ""twister"" , stripped from what he knows or thought he knew. And when he finally deliveres the boy in the end, you know he has to realize that he would be much better at understanding his own sex and he is clearly relieved about this realization. There's a lot to this movie, I can watch it over and over, and think this is showing how different and complex and beautiful women are and how refreshing to step away from the idea that all women are the same and what they want are the same and predictable. Men aren't always the answer and men don't always understand what women want and need. Stick to you guns.

1396066,5,B000055YVT,"This is an excellent Altman movie. Though there is the usual large cast you expect from an Altman movie this one is unique in that despite all the periphery confusion it brings an ever increasing focus on just one character, Dr. T himself. Richard Gere has never been one of my favorite actors but he gives an impeccable and likable performance as an always generous and compassionate gynecologist. His wife played by Farrah Fawcett has a breakdown(and gets naked in a fountain) at the mall early on and spends the entire movie institutionalized. His daughters are played by Tara Reid and Kate Hudson, ones a JFK conspiracy nut and the other a lesbian cheerleader(her lover played by Liv Tyler).  Dr. T's work life is equally confusing as he treats one hypochondriac after another. Excellent small part by patient Janine Turner. While his wife is in getting treatment he begins an affair with independent golf pro Helen Hunt. In synopsis the movie sounds wacky and it is but it is also a very solid drama. The movie has a backbone and that is Gere. As his perfect life falls away before him he becomes more and more exposed, vulnerable. Lyle Lovetts soundtrack provides a sober running commentary on one man losing control of his life and how he deals with that.  An ending that will blow you away....highly recommended. This is a very confident Altman being experimental in a very interesting way, he's full of insight again. Reminds me of some of his seventies work like 1978's The Wedding, but with firmer directorial control.",1017014400,29,1529,4.809885931558935

1396068,3,B000055YVT,"Director Robert Altman's movie, Dr. T and the Women might best be described as lesser Altman. It doesn't have the range or the power of his early works, such as M.A.S.H., Nashville or McCabe and Mrs. Miller. The satire isn't as biting or as insightful as it is in his more recent films like The Player and Short Cuts. Still, lesser Altman is better than the best movies of half the directors at work today.
Dr. T, is the nickname of Dr. Sullivan Travis, a Dallas gynecologist who is much favored by the city's wealthy and influential women. Both at work and at home, where he lives with his wife and two daughters, as well as a recently moved-in sister and her three girls, Dr. T's world is one filled with women. Even the new assistant golf pro at his country club is female. About his only contact with other males is the hunting and fishing afternoons he shares with three buddies. This is not a man besieged by the opposite sex. This is one who is quite happy with his situation in life. He considers himself fortunate.
His world begins to come apart when his wife, Kate [Farrah Fawcett], has a major nervous breakdown in the middle of one of the city's most fashionable malls. She winds up in a posh institution where she is diagnosed as suffering from something called the Hestia complex, a condition in which a woman falls apart from being loved too much. (Whether or not such a condition actually exists is beside the point.) Meanwhile, Dr. T has a practice to attend to, as well as a daughter who is about to be married. It isn't long before the new golf pro catches his eyes. As is often the case in real life, it doesn't take long for a content and ordered life to unravel in the right circumstances.
Richard Gere has never been nicer than he is as Dr. T. The chemistry between him and both Ms. Fawcett and Helen Hunt, who plays the golf pro, is much stronger than it was with Wynona Ryder in last year's Autumn in New York. He hasn't lost his touch. Indeed, his interaction with all the women in this picture is a lot of fun to watch. All of the actresses are strong, especially Laura Dern as the hard-drinking sister, Shelley Long as T's office manager, and Liv Tyler as Marilyn, his daughter's maid of honor and the one who is the ultimate undoing of the wedding. Altman has a history of creating strong roles for women. It is no wonder so many actresses line up to work with him, despite the fact that the pay is far less than they usually get.
Dr. T and the Women has been criticized for being antifeminist. I don't think that it is. Altman is a satirist. In this movie he takes a look at a certain type of woman, namely the kind who marries well and finds it neither necessary nor fulfilling to work. Many such women still exist, and I personally do not begrudge their right to live as they please. To each his own. They are, however, not sacrosanct and are as fair a target of satire as any other group. Besides, if being always politically correct means that one has to cast aside one's sense of humor, then I say that a little political incorrectness is always in order.",1016323200,,3090,4.385017421602788
1396069,3,B000055YVT,"Altman's red rag to an audience that didn't play.  At first, 'Dr. T' seems like one of those neanderthal, anti-feminist 'comedies' from the 1970s that stretched their 'laughs' from how funny and silly and shallow and brittle 'powerful' women really are.  Dr. T is a popular gynacologist, with a large and demanding clientele.  The opening credits manages in familiar Altman-style to catch the dynamics of a group, in this case a gaggle of rich, bored, aroused, hysterical women who can't stop chattering at a soon-incomprehensbile pitch.  Dr. T's all-female family, loving but spoiled, similarly babble, a tendency heightened by the upcoming wedding of one daughter, and the steady mental deterioration of his wife.  Amid all the female hubbub, Dr. T is a beacon of quiet sanity, a man so inured to women's bodies, he has to cant about their spiritual uniqueness.  His outings with his buddies for golf and hunting may seem ridiculous in their posturing, but, compared to the amazons, offer a manly calm.
Had 'Dr. T' continued in this vein, it would have been fair enough to label it misogynistic. But having wound us up into thinking it's about one thing, Altman imperceptibly shows that the film's about another, shaking T's absrudly (I mean, 'T'!) pompous complacency.  While the women become increasingly complex - the ploy of not showing Kate Hudson's bridegroom suggests she's only interested in the material and social trappings of a wedding, but this absence is revealed to have a strong emotional basis - Dr. T finds himself unable to deal with them as real, as opposed to his categorised Ideal.  Most piquantly, the attraction of golf professional Helen Hunt, is that she is more like a man than a woman, implying a suppressed homosexuality in T that paralells that of his daughter.
Dr. T was generally considered a failure on its release, and although Altman dutifully marshalls his trademark visual rhythms, that glorious dance between off-hand characterisation, mobile wide-screen camera and fluid editing, it never becomes anything special.  This is arguably because the characters are all, male and female, too shrill; because the script isn't sharp enough; or because Gere - brilliant, but slyly passive - leaves a black hole at its centre.  Having said that, second-rate Altman is more fun than almost anything else currently available, and the various group crescendos have their comic moments, though the cod-Tennesse Williamisms are an easy target.",1015804800,3,2468,5.1475
1396070,1,B000055YVT,"With all respect to Altman devotees, ""Dr. T"" ia a real failure.  Some say this sprawling, shapeless movies is in genuine Altman-style with goos readon.  All right, they are getting what they want.  But there is another way of talking about it, and that is, Altman is just another overrated director because of his apparently anti-Hollywood attitude or his cynical observation about everthing he dislikes...
For those who're interested in the film's plot, ""Dr. T"" displays in its center a gynecologist Richard Gere and his life, which starts to be shaky after his wife Farrah Fawcett is hospitalized due to a rare (fictional) mental disease, which is the result of too much affection given to her.  At the same time around Dr. T's office come countless ladies every day that represent the entire high society of Dallas (where Texas-born writer Anne Rapp once lived).  And Doc must face the wedding day of his daughter when a lovely golfer Helen ""Bree"" Hunt appears in his life.  Troubles and troubles follow.
I read a material about this film, in which it is pointed out that the plot is allegorical, partly based on the Book of Job from the Old Testament.  As I can remember the contents of the Book only roughly, I do not go any further than just pointing out, but even so, I don't know how to figure out the way to put the messy script of the film together.  The female characters are all caricatures with various degrees -- for example, Tara Reid is obsessed with JFK assassination, Shelley Long a high-strung nurse, Kate Hudson a lesbian cheerleader, and so on -- and the fashion they are portrayed is not always kind.  I would say not a little nasty.  I wonder for what those good female players came to him (I mean Altman) after all.
But the most irritating thing is that their acting is uniformly good, including Gere's.  It seems that only the director didn't do his homework, letting his direction as loose as possible, not knowing where he should go, or what he should do.  Not biting enough as a satire, not well consctructed as a drama, but just as loose as hackeyed name of ""emsemble"" can mean...",1015632000,6,2109,4.654986522911051
1396071,3,B000055YVT,"In the special features interview, Altman discusses how a film is never seen in isolation, but is compared to whatever else is out there culturally and how his past output creates a certain amount of baggage and expectation. As a veteran of the business, he seemed philosophical about the process and saw time as a friend. I haven't seen any of his contemporary films and his seventies work is more of a distant memory so I was able to view 'Dr T' on it's merits. I thought it was a wonderful, touching comedy. The first half is languid and therefore testing. I was interested in Dr T as a character, but only moderately interested in his day. Perhaps the verisimilitude of the women's hairstyles and dress created a homogeneity amongst the characters that was confusing for a time. It all comes together in a funny second half with a finely judged performance from Gere. The charge of mysogyny puzzles me as I found the picture quite affectionate, unless you want to take the final exhortation as some universal statement rather than the wry, character driven epiphany it actually is. I did not find Gere's affair seemingly out of character for a man who claims to respect women, merely prescient of his ambivalence. The Wizard Of Oz like denouement has been problematic for some, but I thought the way it was shot was inspired from a comic standpoint, as was his complete inability to escape his lot in life. On the strength of this, Altman is one of the few directors working today with an original and brilliant vision. If he may not like all humanity (who could?) He is at least interested in it.
I also found the film informative in other ways. I had always wondered how men and women actually get to go to bed with one another. This film takes you through the entire process and in the unlikely event I manage to get away from the PC and find myself in a similar situation, thanks to Mr Altman, I will at least have some clue as to what to do. The film does not cover the morning after aspect of the whole event but perhaps 'Gosford Park' will enlighten me further. I hear it's jolly good.

1396086,1,B000055YVT,"Pretty harsh, I know, but allow me to elaborate:
My wife and I had high hopes for this movie. I'm completely comfortable with the gynecological subject and we thought it might be a funny movie for us both to enjoy. We hadn't realized the cast selection was so good and as a result our expectations were raised when we saw the opening credits...Helen Hunt, Liv Tyler, Farah Faucett...even Andy Richter (from Late Night With Conan OBrien). Now halfway through the movie I had the feeling that the story wasn't going anywhere and I was confused at all the directions the producer was trying to take us and all the various and seemingly unnecessary storylines. I still held out hope since many movies tie it all up in the end. However, in the end all the storylines ended up coming to a quick, no rushed close that seemed unbelievable and illogical. AND, the movie was often funny but hinted at a darkness that I sort of felt like we shouldn't be laughing at. The ending was the stupidest part of the entire film...so much so that I thought Dr. T was a dreaming it and they were only kidding. When the screen fading to signify the ending of the movie I was downright mad that we had wasted a couple hours of our time with such an incredibly dumb movie. It was hardly entertaining and I'm NOT normally a harsh critic.
So my recommendation is that you stay away from this movie unless you REALLY like the subject or the actors and actresses. The acting was good in parts.
Just for reference sake, the worst movie I have ever seen was Congo, about the wild monkeys, etc. Dr. T and the women ranks a pretty close and my wife agrees with me (Yes I did ask her).

1396088,3,B000055YVT,"A universal fact of life, and one of the common elements that tie us all together, is that everyone-- in one way or another-- has problems; or Life experiences, if you prefer.  All of which, on an individual basis, illustrates what the great philosopher once referred to as the Human Comedy, and which Dr. T and the Women, directed by Robert Altman, demonstrates cinematically with more than a touch of irony and some insight into human nature.  And, as often happens with a film of this type, it was mistakenly promoted as a comedy, which ultimately may have had a negative impact on the way it was initially received by the public at large.  It is amusing to be sure, and downright funny at times, but only in the way that life is in general, even in the wake of tragedy; hence the saying, Thats life.
 The story centers on Dr. Sullivan Travis (Richard Gere), a gynecologist with a wife, two daughters and a successful practice, who is well liked and admired by his patients.  And he should be; hes good looking and charismatic, but most importantly, hes a good doctor.  But his personal life is quickly becoming something of a shambles.  His eldest daughter, Dee Dee (Kate Hudson), is about to be married, his youngest, Connie (Tara Reid), is a conspiracy theory activist and his wife, Kate (Farrah Fawcett), to whom he is devoted, is on the verge of a nervous breakdown.  He makes a valiant attempt at holding it all together and trying to please everyone, but as always happens in a situation like this, eventually something has to give.  And when it does, it leaves the good doctor at loose ends and forces him to take stock of his life and what it all means, if anything.
 The first fifteen minutes or so of this movie is so hectic it is nerve-shattering and guaranteed to increase adrenaline levels, and your first reaction may be to scream Enough already! as the agitation and anxiety that fills the waiting room of Dr. Ts office threatens to explode off the chart.  But discomfiting as it may be at the moment, it really puts you in the story, and in the final analysis its a good piece of filmmaking by Altman, because its the turmoil of the waiting room that becomes the manifestation of Dr. Ts inner state of confusion and enables you to relate to him, which in turn gives a vital and necessary perspective to the film.
 The performances are solid, though only a couple stand out as especially noteworthy.  Gere is believable as the doctor (quite unlike Tom Cruise in Eyes Wide Shut, who came across as an actor playing a doctor), and maintains the reality of the character by avoiding any superfluous dramatics; he plays him as a man who is what he is and nothing more.  Helen Hunt is good, as always, playing somewhat against type as Bree Davis, a fairly self-absorbed golf pro with rather ambiguous morals, who is willing to give only if what she receives in turn is satisfying to her (Bree is a character of whom Ayn Rand would be proud).  And Farrah Fawcett does a nice job as Kate, but lacks the screen time necessary to really develop her character; the perspective you get of her is established mainly through Dr. T and some of the other characters as they speak of her.
 Hudson, Reid and Liv Tyler (Marilyn) are all credible in their respective characters, but there is certainly nothing endearing about any of them.  Not that they are unlikable, but because of the way that Altman presents his characters, these are people about whom it is easy to adopt an ambivalent attitude.  The same can be said of Laura Dern, in a somewhat forgettable supporting role as Peggy.  And one can only suspect that this was done intentionally, as it allows Altman to keep the focus of the film on Dr. T.  As Carolyn, the woman who runs Dr. Ts office, Shelley Long gives one the most memorable performance of the film.  As something of an integral, yet peripheral part of Dr. Ts life, she is charming and funny-- not to mention agreeably attractive-- and adds some real spunk to the film.  And Janine Turner, as Dorothy, is also impressive as one of Dr. Ts patients.  These are the two characters, in fact, who really bring this film to life.
 Of all of the actors in the film, the usually dependable Lee Grant is the only one who gives a somewhat disappointing performance.  In a brief appearance as Dr. Harper, her delivery is too stagy and overblown; in a scene in which she is having a conversation with Dr. T, for example, rather than coming across as a real person having a real discussion with another, she looks like an actor playing a part.  Its a performance that may have worked in live theater, but for the intimacy of film it was too much (Olympia Dukakis had the same problem in Steel Magnolias).
 Rounding out the supporting cast are Robert Hays (Harlan), Matt Malloy (Bill) and Andy Richter (Eli).  Altman has a rather stoic, almost aloof way of telling a story, which makes Dr. T and the Women difficult to embrace emotionally, but it is a good story, and the subtlety of the presentation may invite a reflective moment or two.  If you want comedy, look elsewhere; but for an interesting-- though somewhat quirky-- drama, this may fit the bill.",997488000,3,5166,4.57871878393051

1396105,5,B000055YVT,"This movie is nothing what I expected.  Most Robert Altman films have their emphasis on being erotic, or at least attempting to be erotic.  There is maybe one scene in this film which is slightly erotic; the rest of it does not even pretend to be anything of  a sensual nature.
Now, this is not bad, just not what you'd expect from an Altman film.  After watching this movie, I had a feeling it was going to take a beating in the customer reviews (and as you've noticed by now, I was right!).  As others have already noted, this movie is most ASSUREDLY not for everyone.
In many ways, what this movies seems to be, at least to me, is kind of a counterpart to the Mel Gibson movie ""What Women Want.""  It's curious to note that Helen Hunt starred in that movie as well.  While WWW focused on the noble attributes of the female gender while doing some mild male-bashing, this film does the opposite.  It's not an absolute parallel, however, as this flick only indirectly steers one towards positive male-attributes, while at the same time the theatrical commentary on women is a touch more scathing than that which is directed  towards men in WWW.  Also, WWW is much funnier than the present movie, although Dr. T does have its moments.
True much of the general depictions of women in this film are stereotypical.  However, that is not to say that they do not have any footing in reality [again, just like the slams on men in WWW].  With my own personal encounters with women over the years I, for one, could relate to several scenes in this film.  At first I found the ending to be Deus Ex Machina.  However, upon further review, I believe that it was where this film was headed, after all.  The tornado is symbolic of all of the chaos brought to the kindly gynecologist's life by the sundry women in his life.  Nice touch.
Again, this movie is not for everyone.  It is border-line misogynistic, but always seems to have just enough charm to refrain from crossing the line & becoming really nasty.  However, most men will be able to identify the impetuous and capricious behavior of the ladies in the story.  Probably the most interested group of people would be men who are going thru a phase of frustration with their relationships w/women.

By contrast, the woefully awful, obscenity saturated, cynical, laughably pretentious and misanthropic ""Magnolia"" got plenty of praise from many of the same audiences and critics! And that guy was attempting to imitate Altman in embarrassingly inept fashion! Go figure the absurdities of the American movie-going public! But you have to understand that Altman's film doesn't peddle the over-the-top, sleaze-ball attraction of Tom Cruise grinding his pelvis and referring to women in the most degrading fashion imaginable; and yet, lo and behold, it's Altman's gentle satire that was labeled `misogynist' by some because it didn't show any thoroughly exaggerated male characters like P.T. Anderson's not-likely-to-be-remotely- real (except maybe on the Jerry Springer show but that show's all exaggerated for effect anyway and not pretending to be profound) even-as-a-writer-for-Hustler-magazine buffoon, and instead, concentrated mainly on a few, well-drawn and realistic shallow women and one strong and intelligent one.
First of all, it must be said, in case people forgot, that this film is a satire, and in a satire people are made to look routinely ridiculous to hopefully enlighten those who can understand and gain some perspective through it, to refine, if applicable, their own behavior by weeding out certain similar types of stubborn and insidious behaviors. It's about exposing vanity and absurdity. And if the balance of satire falls more heavily on the women in this film, there are at least 5 other films made by Altman himself where the opposite is true. But even this film is far from one sided when looked at more closely. How exactly are the men that go hunting with Dr. T, not made to look like idiots? And so what if Dr. T himself is made to look only `gallantly foolish' for being `too nice' (therefore causing his wife Farrah Fawcett to go into `Childhood regression' ) ? Isn't a character criticized for being `too accommodating' and intemperate in the opposite direction from the one so overwhelmingly depicted in almost every other satire, highly original in itself? Where else have you ever seen a character like this? Dustin Hoffman in ""The Graduate"" maybe? But he was a confused kid with no money and Gere is a successful gynecologist making bank! The almost Marcus-Welby-like, meticulously polite and accommodating Dr. T. gynecologist character is as rare a subject for satire as any, and he is satirized for sure, but not in as obvious a way as his patients and family members, i.e., `the women,' who bear the burden of his intemperate `niceness' (and maybe take advantage of it in ways that they themselves don't realize). It's easy to mistake it for a `faultless' depiction, because the fault happens to be an excess of something everyone considers a virtue when not in excess. But an excess of politeness and accommodation is definitely a fault and maybe even a vice and it will get you in a lot of unexpected trouble.  Dr. T's doesn't know why he's made a mess of his life but we do, and that's immensely fascinating (especially since chronic `nice guy' syndrome is widespread in society and potentially much more harmful than people think if not checked by some stronger, harsher, more truthful, and ultimately healthier realities).
And so what if most of the women in Richard Gere's office are shown to be annoying idiots that drive him up the wall day after day, and whom he has to accommodate because it's his job? So what if most of the women in his family are relative airheads? Isn't the Helen Hunt `golf coach' character the opposite number from all these airheads? Isn't her character one of the strongest, most independent minded women depicted in a film for quite a while? Doesn't she come to Gere's office and sit in the midst of a whole roomful of bickering women with quiet, dignified detachment? Doesn't she sleep with Richard Gere on a first date because she feels like it, fully aware that he will not look at her as `easy' or in any way adversely as a result, but on the contrary, as a strong woman who takes what she wants guiltlessly and confidently, because she has related to him on an equal footing from the start? Doesn't she later give him advice in his office, and then reject his offer to marry her and `take care of her' because she has her own life (like any self-respecting feminist would)? And so what if she's seeing Robert Hays (Gere's hunting buddy) on the side? Doesn't that further prove that she's independent enough to keep her options open and reject a conceited `gynecologist' she likes very much but not enough to give up her career or principles for (if it comes down to a marriage offer that she's not ready to accept, as it surely did in the end)?  Doesn't that show foresight and mature independence rather than some `two-timing' `cheating woman' nonsense proving her `typical female treachery,' and `shallowness' when she wasn't romantically committed to Gere yet anyway? I very much think so, and all Altman is doing is 'keeping it real,' and away from audience expectations and cliche, which, naturally makes a lot of people quite annoyed and mad, since their programmed tastes weren't satisfied.",992217600,7,5859,4.988752556237219
1396107,5,B000055YVT,"This film is getting horrible reviews here at Amazon, and I would like to put up a defensive review of this wonderful movie.
As one reviewer pointed out, I imagine this movie is not for everyone. No movie really is. However, for lovers of the kind of masterful weaving of character and story that Robert Altman is famous for, this movie is truly a gem. Robert Altman has grown to be one of my very favorite directors, and truly an icon of American directors.
Robert Altman is not concerned with special effects, spine-tingling plot twists, edge-of-your-seat suspence. As is obvious through all of his films, Altman is concerned with character and story. His characters, especially in this film, are deeply rich. While most of them don't pour out thier souls, thier behaviors and particular choices allow you to truly understand each character as a unique patch on a giant quilt. When the movie begins, I began a journey to really know these people, and by the films end I wished that I could stay with each of them a little longer just to watch them live thier funny, and interesting lives.  This film is at once, sad, funny, touching, and fascinating. If you go into the film with an attitude that is prepared to take in an Altman film like Dr. T, this movie will not dissapoint. For those who hated it so passionately, I don't reccomend that you see Altman's other films. However, those who liked what this film did, Altman weaves similar magic in to the characters of Nashville, Short Cuts, Cookie's Fortune, The Player, M*A*S*H, and 3 Women. This film deserves far more credit than its getting, so please, judge for yourself.",992131200,7,1629,4.71578947368421
1396108,1,B000055YVT,"This movie is proof that even Richard Gere can't save a horrible movie. Dr. T is a busy, sought-after doctor in Dallas ... a doctor (the lucky kind were told early on) married to a wacko (played by Farrah Faucett... what a stretch is that?) who he is accused of giving a complex because he ""loves her too much."" If that's not bad enough, the plot thins with wedding plans of one daughter we learn is a lesbian and another who is played by Tara Reid... enough said. He's in the midst of a fling with Helen Hunt who must have a quota of crappy movies to make in a single year. Just when you thought this movie could bite no more, he drives his convertible into a tornado and lands in Mexico in time to deliver (we get to see a live birth) a baby.

1396109,3,B000055YVT,"So many people have been criticizing this movie. Look at all the 1 star reviews, it's just not fair. I would like to know if the people who hated this movie were Altman fans to begin with. I really don't think they were, otherwise, they knew what they were getting in for. If your familiar with Altman's style, then I don't understand, what the problem is someone would have with this movie. Altman constantly makes movies with ""no plot"". There's never a strong central story-line. Or really devolped characters. But, either you accept this or you don't. I'll freely admit some of his movies work and some don't. I think what happened with this movie was, too many non-Altman fans went to see this and didn't know what to expect. I honestly think that's what happened here.  For those who don't know this Altman film written by Anne Rapp is about a Dallas gynecologist, Dr. Sully Travis (Richard Gere) and the ""women"" in his life, which include; his wife (Farrah Fawcett) whom is suffering from a disease where she has sorta went ""crazy"" after getting too much love from her husband. Then there's his daughters; Connie (Tara Reid) who is about to get married, but, keeps a very dark and shocking secret about her sex life. Also there's his other daughter Dee Dee (Kate Hudson). And at work their's his co-worker Carolyn (Shelley Long), and a woman who he now has a crush on Bree Davis (Helen Hunt). Altman was fooling around with an idea that another movie tried more successfully, ""What Women Want"". ""Dr. T..ect"" tried to figure that one out itself. First he thinks a woman would want to feel loved by her husband, then he learn that, that's what drove his wife into the condition she's in. He then thinks that woman like a take charge kind of guy, as in the case with the Helen Hunt charcater, only he finds out he was wrong again! Now, I'm not going to say that ""Dr. T & The Women"" is one of the greatest movies ever made, it most certainly is not. I'm sure many won't think it's Altman's best, but, the movie does have moments that work well. There are some parts that made me laugh. There were other parts that worked up on the emotional level it wanted to hit. It has a nice blend that sometimes works. People are really being far too harsh on this movie. THIS IS NOT FOR NON-ALTMAN FANS! If you've never seen an Altman film don't start here! Watch ""M*A*S*H"", or ""The Player"". If you already like Altman's films you won't be disappointed. A pretty good movie on Altman's scale of things (notice I said on his scale of things, not in general). *** 1\2 out of *****",991699200,3,2569,4.489316239316239

I have seen chick flicks that that were way better than this.  There is no story, no underlying meaning, and the acting is awful!  I have always thought that Richard Gere was a good actor, as is Helen Hunt, and they did the best they could with what they had to work with, but there was just no feeling at all.  There were lots of other lovely actresses here (Liv Tyler, Kate Hudson, Janine Turner) that had horrible parts.  They could just as easily have been mannequins!  I can't imagine that any of them read through the script and said, ""Hey, this looks good"".  The waste of talent displayed here is staggering.  I kept waiting for it to get better, but it didn't.

1396116,1,B000055YVT,"It would be fair to assume that a movie titled Dr. T & the Women would be one of three types: a cheap B movie about a washed up doctor and a bunch of showgirls, a tacky porn movie, or a lighthearted look at a man who loves and respects the many women in his life. I expected the third and was sadly mistaken.
Early in the movie, Dr. Travis describes women as angels who should be worshipped. His problems with the women in his life are supposed to result from his doing just that. His wife suffers from being loved too much, one daughter is spoiled because he gives her everything she needs, his office manager has a crush on him because he's a great boss, his patients love him because he tells them all they're beautiful... it goes on and on.
Those are the fictional problems of the character in this movie. Here are my problems . First, there is not a postive female role in the entire picture, with the possible exception of Liv Tyler's character. His wife is loony, his sister in law is a drunk, one daughter's a spoiled brat, the other's a tattletale obsessed with violence, the office manager tries to seduce him, the old bat in the waiting room regularly assaults the young, beautiful, rich, insecure woman who has bi-weekly appointments at the gynecologist because everyone there tells her how beautiful and perfect she is, and the golf pro, supposedly a strong, self-confident woman, is fooling around with a guy who she knows is married. Even Liv Tyler's character, a friend of his daughter in town for the daughter's wedding, is dubious. I mean, if you had to squeeze in a visit to the gynecologist while you were in town, would you really want your best friend's father at the other end of the stirrups?
Second, if Dr. T loves women so much, why does he treat them so poorly? He ignores his family, doesn't visit his wife in the mental hospital for six weeks, doesn't get a second opinion when her doctor diagnoses her with some ridiculous condition and recommends he not see her, cheats on his (beloved) wife during that six week period, constantly leaves women in his waiting room for hours on end and, although it doesn't actually say this in the movie, probably doesn't pay his office staff enough to put up with the garbage that they handle for him while he runs out to golf and shoot skeet.
Finally, the filmmaker seems to have taken Richard Gere playing a gynecologist as an opportunity to frame his face as often as possible with women's thighs. Do we really need to see him do a breast exam? Is this an integral part of the story? Was the birth scene, shot from the doctor's point of view, necessary? Oh don't worry - this movie couldn't care less about the women in it, so the birth only lasted 15 seconds and was as clean as Martha Stewart's kitchen. It was just an excuse to place Richard Gere between one more pair of female thighs.",986342400,8,2858,4.477011494252873

When we went to the video store this weekend, I figured I owed it to her for us to get this movie.  We both hated it.  We only got about halfway through.  As you can see from the other reviews we were not alone in this opinion and I agree wholeheartedly that there wasn't any plot.  Reading the other reviews however makes me glad that we didn't sit through it any longer.  I can add this much more to the commmentary about how nauseating this movie was.  Dr. T (Richard Gere)'s wife (Farrah Fawcett) goes thru a complete mental breakdown and is committed.  The reason for her breakdown is the fact that Dr. T loves her too much.  However, once she is in the ward, Dr. T quickly begins an affair with Helen Hunt.  This movie however still portrays him as the good guy in all this.  This made me want to vomit.

As bad as the movie was, the ""making of"" feature on the DVD is even worse.

Well surprise surpise (come to think of it, Gomer Pyle would have done a better job of acting in this than RG). Well, it didn't get better. In fact much worse. The screeming women scene stopped.

Now, I knew that with Altman, there was always a bit of hit-and-miss going on, that most of the time his movies had no apparent plot (i.e 'Pret-&agrave;-Porter' among others)but, let's face it, he's a great ensemble cast director. However, I still found 'Dr. T...' extremely offensive to women.
The movie is about a gynecologist (Gere) who lives surrounded by women. Dr. T is the good guy here. He loves his (insane) wife, his two daughters, and all his patients. Even when he is with his mistress (while his wife is in a mental hospital) he still manages to look sympathetic. 'Men good, women bad' is basically what the movie tells you. Ah, the women! They are portrayed as insane, hysterical, drunk, emotionally unstable, unfaithful and it goes on...I don't understand how brilliant actresses (and women) like Helen Hunt, Shelley Long, Laura Dern (and others) would have wanted to be associated with this project. Perhaps for the sake of working with Robert Altman...
Anyway, I don't see how any woman could enjoy this movie...It is a travesty of the image of women in general (even though defenders of the movie say it's only a snapshot of a type). From the first shot (which made me think of a hen-house) to the last (""It's a boy!""-thank god!), I just couldn't believe that $12 million were wasted on a story such as this one.",982972800,3,1510,4.723484848484849
1396139,1,B000055YVT,"I bought this movie based on the reviewer's comments on the DVD cover. Boy, am I ashamed! We viewed it with friends and had to turn it off after 15 minutes, - that is, about three gynecological exams into the feature. What a total waste of talent and disappointing mess of a movie.  We decided to watch Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray in Double Indemnity instead and I must say, it saved the evening.  Don't waste your time or money on this one.",982713600,,449,4.397590361445783
1396140,2,B000055YVT,"At first I thought this was just the ultimate chick flic.  But after speaking to women about this, they hated it too.  Twenty minutes of this film is spent with characters on the phone planning a wedding.  The women are obnoxious and very unlikable.  Somehow we are supposed to like Gere's character who has a fling with Helen Hunt while his wife if in the hospital.
I give it 2 stars instead of one due to the great kissing between Liv Tyler and Kate Hudson.",982713600,2,459,4.364705882352941
1396141,2,B000055YVT,"To be frank, I watched the movie because of the talent behind it.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed with virtually every aspect of this movie.
  There are times when the action bounces back and forth between two sets of characters and situations (a la Fifth Element) but there is little or no connection between the two situations, which leaves me dizzy and confused instead of entertained or stimulated.
  There is extreme character development, such as the numerous times we see Peggy (Laura Dern) slipping off to take a nip from her flask or pouring herself a drink.  The idea of her alocholism is pounded into my conscious to the point of annoying me, and then I found that the fact that she has a substance abuse problem has nothing to do with the plot, the character interaction or anything else for that matter.  Why did Robert Altman make such a big deal of it then?  Filler?
  The obsession with the Kennedy family for Connie (Tara Reid's character) is another case where a good amount of time is spent in trying to show us this side of the character and it is never followed up with any tangible purpose later in the movie.  Strangely enough, she is probably one of the more 'normal' women in the picture.
  All of this would have lead to a mediocre movie but the ending really killed it for me.  I have no idea what the ending is supposed to mean.  In fact, it reinforces the idea that the whole plot was derived by the writers completing several Mad Libs pages and then editing them into a screenplay.  There is really no other explanation for why so many aspects of the movie seem to be so random (or haphazard at best).",982713600,8,1634,4.506802721088436
1396142,1,B000055YVT,"this is a terrible movie .
There is no plot, and no good acting ,and I felt the entire movie seems to have been shot in Irritatavision with so many people talking at once that you just want to strangle someone!
bottom line: Avoid this if you can. and me? ..I will never, ever see another Robert Altman movie.",982627200,9,308,4.237288135593221
1396143,2,B000055YVT,"Jackson Pollack became famous in abstract art for laying a canvas on the floor and splashing, dripping and hurling paint on it.  After seeing this film, one might conclude that Robert Altman is to film as Jackson Pollack is to art.  The question is whether this is genius or just a compulsive eccentric flinging stuff into the frame.  My vote goes to the latter.
The story is a very scattered, almost incoherent stream of foolishness that surrounds the life of Dr. Sullivan Travis (Richard Gere).  Dr. T is a prominent gynecologist in Dallas Texas and his socialite patients are among the looniest on the planet.  His wife (Farrah Fawcett) went nuts because he loved her too much and treated her too well.  His daughter (Kate Hudson) is getting married and her lesbian lover (Liv Tyler) is her maid of honor.  His long time nurse (Shelley Long) is in love with him and along with his golf pro (Helen Hunt), wants to seduce him.  To top it all off his ditzy sister in law (Laura Dern) is living in his house with her three daughters.
The script has comic possibilities, but Altman's bizarre presentation dissipates it into a chaotic din.  Most every scene is dominated by the constant yakity-yak of ten women tittering and chattering at once.  Clearly, Altman is attempting to lampoon Texas society with his characterizations, but his free-for-all style turns it into amateurish trash of sitcomesque proportion.
This film is extremely unflattering to women.  Almost all the women are portrayed as insane over-emotional, irrational, stupid, or hypochondria ridden flakes.  The only woman close to normal is Bree (Helen Hunt), and she is manipulative and self absorbed.  Dr. T, in contrast is levelheaded, rationale, reasonable, sensitive and wonderful.  His shooting pals are also seen as pretty normal guys, if not particularly bright.
A treasure trove of acting talent is squandered in the cacophony.  Richard Gere plays a very lovable character, which is a novelty for him.  He is all sensitivity and vulnerability here without a hint of his normal macho impassiveness.  Helen Hunt gives another fine performance as the self-centered golf pro who seems to be Dr. T's refuge from all the crazy women that surround him, but is really using him for her own hedonistic ends.  Farrah Fawcett also gives a terrific rendition of a woman who has taken leave of her wits.  In truth, the entire all-star ensemble is fantastic.  However, great performances with a bad script and a weird director add up to nothing more than so much debris chucked into the frame.
I rated this film a 3/10.  The whole is much less than the sum of the parts.  For a film with this many bankable stars to gross only $13.0 million at the box office ($5 million of that in week one) is a clear indication of how poor it is.  If you are lucky enough not to have seen it yet, do yourself a favor and miss it.",982022400,46,2874,4.761616161616161
1396144,3,B000055YVT,"Disappointment is the only word that comes to mind while writing this review.  I had such high hopes for this ensemble piece including such favorites as Helen Hunt and Richard Gere and rising starlets Tara Reid and Kate Hudson.  I liked the setting, the characters, and the basic idea.  The movie just didn't live up to its potential.  All we see is a bunch of scenes from Dr. T's life.  We observe the many eccentric characters of Dr. T's family--Tara Reid as the JFK conspiracy-obsessed daughter, Kate Hudson as the Dallas Cowboys wannabe cheerleader/lesbian daughter, and Laura Dern as the drunk, crazy hat-wearing sister-in-law.  Most pathetic in the family is Dr. T's wife (Farrah Fawcett), a woman who suffers from the Hestia complex and has consequently reverted to childlike behavior. She supposedly suffers from this complex due to the ""overwhelming amount of affection her husband has shown her.""  I find this hard to believe, since Dr. T's daughters can hardly have five minutes of conversation with him without some kind of distraction.  The only redeeming quality of the film is Dr. T's hilarious nurse, Shelly Long.  The scenes in the waiting room are top-notch!  Total chaos and LOUDNESS abound the room as Shelly Long tries to keep the ""fillies from getting restless"".  Even funnier are the number of women fighting to be the first in line for Dr. T's gynecological equipment!  Yet, even these few humorous scenes aren't enought to save this film from drowning.  The final scene does not even attempt to wrap up this movie.  In the end, we're merely left with a bunch of interesting acquaintances and even though the movie is pretty horrible, we can only hope for a sequal to wrap up this unfinished mess.",981936000,10,1721,4.889655172413793
1396145,2,B000055YVT,"With such a talented cast and a semi-decent story, you think it would have been a great movie.  Richard Gere plays a gynecologist in a large Texas town.  His life is on the down side and he is close to having a nervous breakdown.  His wife is going crazy.  One of his daughters might be a lesbian and the other is just mean.  He doesn't know what to do.  That's when golf pro Helen Hunt moves to town and he is immediately infatuated with her.  I love Robert Altman.  He is a great story teller, but there was something missing from this film.
