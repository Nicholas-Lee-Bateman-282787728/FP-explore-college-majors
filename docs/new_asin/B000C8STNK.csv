Watch  Bruno Wolkowitch who performs the role of chief of police. He is very talented and has participated in some 80 films.
He just finished rolling some six hundred hours of a French Television caper, called SPIN,  available through Amazon with English subtitles.",1501372800,,384,5.17741935483871
8096378,5,B000C8STNK,"Sweet love story, with some beautiful location photography.  This was a blind buy for me, meaning i had never seen the film, but like the actor Nicolas Cazale's work in some other French films.  The story concerns an Algerian boy who gets in trouble with the law, and goes on the run with the beautiful daughter of his boss. It is a story that has been told before in films like ""Guncrazy"" with drew Barrymore, but ""L'amour Dangereux"" re-tells it without any exploitative elements, such as unnecessary graphic violence or sex.  This is a very French production, supposedly made for French television, which is surprising, as it looks good enough for the big screen. I am happy to have discovered this film..",1488758400,,707,4.778688524590164

8096381,4,B000C8STNK,"L'amour Dangereux is a beautifully filmed and very well written (Franois Lemaire, Steve Suissa and Samantha Mazeras) story that finds more information about the early stages of love in the young set than a score of other films.  Director Steve Suissa knows exactly how to balance the motivations and the responses of his cast, making a potentially predictable story one that holds our attention - and hearts - from the first frame to the last.

Simon (Nicholas Cazale, a formidable screen presence) is a lower class laborer, kind, caring, industrious, and 'in love' with a girl Noemie (Jennifer Decker) he has observed since childhood, a girl whose parents are property (shop) owners and thus in another class.  Always ready to increase his work to make a better salary, Simon accepts a questionable 'job' for 500 Euros for just 2 hours work.  Needless to say the job is a robbery and Simon, in the course of the failed robbery, assaults a policeman who is attacking his friend, wounding the policeman badly. The others in the robbery are caught but Simon escapes.  He visits the cafe where Noemie works, asks her if she has car keys and Noemie not only gives Simon her father's car and keys, but also asks Simon to accompany him on his escape.

The remainder of the film is a road trip with Simon (who is age 18) and Noemie (age 16) running from the police. They find joys in nature, live in a small shack on the beach, and fall in love in one of the most sensitively written sequences on film.  Simon is hesitant to say he loves Noemie because he feels responsible for her: Noemie begins to feel she must return home but will stay if Simon will only say he loves her.  The cops led by the wily inspector Queyrolles (Bruno Wolkowitch) close in and Simon is captured and the manner in which the film ends is one that reinforces the importance of truth in life and relationships.  What could have been a Hollywoodesque ending complete with suicide leap is instead a tender working through of personal growth.

Nicolas Cazale is one of the more sensitive actors in French film today ('Three Dancing Slaves', multiple TV roles) and this film should make him a star.  The entire cast  - including Marc Samuel as Simon's misunderstood father - is splendid.  The cinematography is magnificent and the tender musical scoring mixing Schubert, Chopin and modern songs fit the mood perfectly.  This is an amazing little film that bravely takes on issues of the Romeo and Juliet manner and remains entirely unique.  Highly Recommended. Grady Harp, June 06",1149552000,4,2544,4.736961451247166
