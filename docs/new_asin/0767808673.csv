6279,5,0767808673,"This film is a definite must for any fan, young or old. It is hillarious,  with great new versions of older songs, with awesome performances of thier  first ones. Older fans, keep in mind that it is a senseless comedy, and  gets awfully hokey sometimes, but the movie never takes itself seriously,  so you it's dumbness is forgiven. To make up for it, seasoned movie buffs  will have fun spotting all the cameos, especially if you pay close  attention to brittish television.  END",908064000,,480,4.710843373493976

6399,5,0767808673,SO GOOD!! Stands the test of time surprisingly well. I think it's even funnier now because so many members of the cast have become even bigger stars than they were then.

6424,5,0767808673,"Everybody has something that they enjoy and just can't explain. They might even be a little embarassed to admit that they like it. Well, I'm not embarassed to admit that the Spice Girls are one of my guilty pleasures. Granted, their music may be a little hokey, but they sure are fun to listen to. In ""Spice World,"" the girls take on a world tour with Bond-esque style. This movie isn't fantastic, but it is fun enough for the whole family to watch. It's silly, it's goofy, and, at times, it is brilliant. You get a feel of what these ladies had to put up with on a daily basis, albeit in a grand and over-the-top style. There are cameos abound in this flick as well. The acting isn't that bad and the girls seemed to enjoy making the movie.
Funny moments abound in this flick, but some of my personal favorites are when the girls first get on their tour bus and they complain about how hot it is. They say that they could use a fan and, in perfect British comedic style, a young, pre-teen girl comes through the door screaming with glee and then runs back out the door. The girls sigh with comfortable relief. Another funny moment is the expensive, special-effects laden tour-bus jumping a draw-bridge with Posh behind the wheel scene. Finally, in the end credits, the girls ""interact"" with the audience. They remark on people making out, wonder why folks watching their video can't find anything good on the ""telly"" and audience member clothes.",1472169600,,1446,4.565384615384615
6425,5,0767808673,so good,1472083200,,7,3.0
6426,5,0767808673,"The movie was terribly written and had no feasible plot line. I loved it. I've only been a fan of the spice girls for a short period of time, but to see them walk and talk as their alter-ego's was really cool. Glad I have it on DVD because I will be watching it again.",1471219200,3,268,3.890909090909091
6427,5,0767808673,This was my kids favorite movie. We only had the VCR tape. Now we have the DVD !!!,1470960000,,82,3.611111111111111
6428,4,0767808673,"If you go into this movie with the right attitude, i.e., it's ridiculous, you'll have a great time.  It functions at once as a tribute to ""Hard Day's Night"" and a time capsule of everything that was right and wrong with the 90's.  It's quite possibly one of the finest guilty pleasures you'll ever rent.",1470700800,,303,4.490909090909091
6429,5,0767808673,"It's a great way to Spice up your day.  These gals are adorable. The movie has no real plot, it's more like a series of fun adventures strung together, with music and beautiful girls thrown in the mix.
But the results are one heck of an entertaining movie.  I love their girl empowerment message and the comedy bits that pepper this movie.  You have to listen close sometimes for little inside jokes and that also makes it fun.
All in all, if you have time to kill, and want a simple non absorbing musical, this is your movie.",1469577600,5,526,4.346938775510204

6441,5,0767808673,"My friend is in town and hadn't seen this former Oscar contender so we had to remedy that. I restrained my inner 8-year old from quoting the entire movie, but we enjoyed singing along. Such a silly, fun movie about girl power.",1469059200,,226,4.404761904761905
6442,5,0767808673,"Great fun movie! A little slow in the middle and towards the end but fun! Our daughter just discovered our old Spice Girls CDs so I decided to buy the movie and she loves it! Too bad they didn't keep the pace of the movie up throughout the whole thing. It works best when it has the girls perform songs and those performances are part of the ""story"" of their upcoming show at the end of the film. So it lags when too much time passes during the movie and there hasn't been a song or performance. Otherwise, it's good fun!",1468800000,2,521,4.1683168316831685
6443,4,0767808673,It you enjoyed the Spice Girls you'll like Spice World. Just a long music video with them on a big bus. A few stars pop in and out to spice it up - wink wink.

Get up and dance if you like.,1468800000,,341,3.6216216216216215

6507,5,0767808673,"I love the Spice Girls and I love this movie.  I figured it was time to update my worn out VHS version of it and upgrade to something higher quality.  Buying the DVD was cheaper than buying a digital copy (which is a little sad).  I was torn between this Special Edition Version and the slightly cheaper Regular Edition.  I didn't want to miss any of the 'Girl Power' so I went with this.  I can safely say that there is nothing extra on this Special Edition except a redone cover and new disk menus.

 Save yourself a few bucks and buy the regular edition.  The only bonus features were a trailer and the song ""Mama"" performed at the concert scene at the end of the movie.  This was originally stuck at the end of the credits on the VHS and is included in the regular edition of the DVD as well.

Anyway, the movie is still awesome and I'd love for a blue-ray edition to coincide with he 20th anniversary tour they are planning. Let's hope!",1450051200,,941,4.265536723163842

It is a light-hearted rip on the Pop music-making machine (which still exists!) that sprinkles the typical themes of Spice Girls : friends first, girl power, and don't let anyone else tell you who you are suppose to be.

Do yourself a favor and buy this film, and then buy an extra copy and pay it forward.",1422576000,,515,4.526881720430108

Especially if I want to add a film to my personal collection it has to be a minimum of widescreen if not bluray to boot.",1422403200,,338,4.467741935483871
6633,4,0767808673,"I should start out by confessing how I've always been partial to Posh Spice Victoria Beckham (<nee> Adams back then).

Like others have said, this film takes its basic premise from ""A Hard Day's Night"", then goes wild. This thing covers a couple of days in the life of the girls and leads up to a monumental concert at the Albert Hall in London. It begins at the end of one concert in one town, at the end of which they board their Union Jack-covered tour bus and move on. Thing is, the bus is more than ten times bigger on the inside than the outside, a tribute to ""Doctor Who"", I gather. That's when the fun really starts.

If you want a serious documentary like one about the Beatles, or the Rolling Stones or the Who, that tries to discuss the more serious influences the Spice Girls have made on our culture, you can fergitabutet, although one of the film's character's is a documentary-maker trying to do just that. Like the Girls themselves, this film is never meant to be taken seriously.  It pokes fun at everything in true British Spike-Mulligan ""Monty Python"" style. It kids VIP parties, publicity photo sessions, girls being girls, ""Charlie's Angels"", haunted house themes, army sergeant-majors, news happenings, and the BBC.  There's a newspaper magnate so tired of the group that he's willing to jump on anything that may cause them to disband. There's George Wendt as a Hollywood producer eager to make some sort of film about the Girls and is full of daffy ideas for it. There's Richard Grant as the Girls' hysterical road manager.  There are cameos by Sir Elton John, Sir Elvis Costello ( interesting the amount of knighthoods handed out to major entertainers during the Tony Blair premiership), Stephan Fry, Hugh Laurie, Bob Hoskins, and Jennifer Saunders (""Absolutely Fabulous""), among others.  And there's Sir Roger Moore as the Girl's All-Highest Manager, kidding his own James Bond image. Though I'd agree with other reviewers that the ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" take-off is perhaps a bit much. Is this to show how the appeal of the Spice Girls is truly ""universal""  or something?

The Spice Girls themselves are sporting enough to put themselves through any sort of gag. They always kid themselves and each other and preach ""Gil Powah,"" while Posh herself already shows her interest in clothes. And of course they sing their greatest hits, which aren't too bad, though the lyrics being subtitled means you could risk having those syrupy-sweet songs being stuck in your head for some time.

The Spice Girls' fad seems to be over now, but it looked like they had a great time while they were around. And ""Spice World"", while certainly not nearly as great a film as ""A Hard Day's Night,"" tells it all.",1422403200,,2731,4.7568710359408035

6753,5,0767808673,"Ok, so first off, I have to say that I have been an avid Spice Girls fan since I was 4, so there might be a slight bias.
Anyway, this movie is the perfect example of the wacky adventures and tacky humor the Spice Girls represented in the late 90's. With that being said, going into the movie, you can't expect Oscar winning performances or a fantastic storyline. Instead, you get 5 girls preparing for a live gig at the world renowned Albert Hall. In the movie, you follow the girls through multiple press conferences, costume changes, alien encounters, photoshoots, and smaller performances in the studio or at a one off performance in Milan or on TV. The girls never take themselves too seriously and there's actually a sense of humor in all of the girls, ESPECIALLY Victoria with her sarcastic remarks and flying down the highway in the Spice Bus. The movie ends with the performance at Albert Hall and doesn't disappoint. If you watch while the credits roll, the girls will have a quick chat with other cast members and finally will break the fourth wall and talk to you as if you're still in the theatre in 1998. The music of the film is from the group's first 2 records and it fits it perfectly (obviously) but it doesn't ruin scenes by not being able to hear the dialogue. All in all, this movie is cheesy great fun and it helps if you're a Spice Girls fan but if you aren't, spice up your life with this movie!",1382313600,4,1418,4.436781609195402
6754,5,0767808673,"Does this movie even need a rating? Come on, its SPICE WORLD! Spice girls forever! If you don't like this movie the 90s weren't good to you",1378771200,,139,4.185185185185185
6755,4,0767808673,"Disclaimer: I am an 80s-born female, who blossomed into her wily teen years through the 90s. While I rebelled (musically) against most of the pop-in-a-box boy- and girl-bands, commercial disney bubblegum, sinfully unoriginal one-hit wonders of the pop world, somehow I got swept up in the tornado that was the Spice Girls. I remember sitting on my bedroom floor, making specially crafted mix tapes which included the likes of Rob Zombie, Incubus, Limp Bizkit, Korn, Papa Roach, etc. And there, on my CD rack, sat not one, but TWO Spice Girls CDs. Single-minded listeners be damned! Sometimes, living in popular society (shopping at Walmart, listening to any major FM radio station, participating in social media, going to the movies) carries with it the burden of being exposed to things, experiences and or people that wouldn't normally lie in one's range of taste. But there you are, unable to avoid it. And then, sometimes, what first may repulse can suddenly attract (insert adage about opposites, Paula Abdul song, yada yada yada), and it becomes not about taste, but simply repetition or familiarity. Then like grows to love, and before you know it, you know every word to every song on both albums. At least that's how it happened for me. The movie became an extension of that guilty pleasure. Nothing more, nothing less. Judge not, lest ye listen to some band that someone else equivocates to the Spice Girls.",1378166400,3,1417,4.957983193277311

6856,3,0767808673,"If you like the Spice Girls, and you don't mind movies with poor story lines, then you'll probably enjoy this.

However, if you try to follow the storyline, which I did, it will give you a headache, like it gave me. There are way too many bad guys in the film, who are plotting various things for the Spice Girls. In the end, we realize they're all good people, and this movie all leads up to a live concert, which is somewhat ironic, because the biggest thing I wondered after watching this film is if the Spice Girls actually recorded any of their own music.  Why do they sound like heavy smokers when they're talking, but that completely goes away when they're singing?

Pros:
+Fun, jovial movie
+It has the Spice Girls
+It has almost all of the Spice Girls' songs
+It kind of indirectly hints at the origins of the Spice Girls' nicknames

Cons:
-They lip sync all of their songs, and it really shows
-Bad sound editing
-The tour bus is about three times wider on the inside than on the outside, and since they spend so much time in here, it's really distracting
-Way too many extra bad guy story lines going on in the background",1282953600,,1132,4.401913875598086
6857,2,0767808673,"Just because The Beatles&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/have-done-it/dp/B0000542D2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">have done it</a>, that doesn't mean the Spice Girls should do the same.  It's a heavy risk for music artists to sell their name on to the big screen, and believe me,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/this-could-go-very-wrong/dp/6302261589/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">this could go very wrong</a>.  Some make it out okay with just the bio-pics, other played it safe and just make theirs a concert movie, but ""Spice World"" took a completely alternate step.  It's a Spice Girls power hour where a lot of zany antics occur, and nothing makes sense.

I might be completely biased with this movie, because much like my unholy memories with Tom Green, the Spice Girls were also a devistating memory of youth; the thing is I used to like Tom Green while I was strongly indifferent with the girl band.  But for most of my middle school years, I'm surround by many fangirls in support of this group who play their music loudly and constantly, and I had to be the butt of a ongoing ridicule just because I made a simple comment that Ginger Spice was cute (and Geri Haliwell still looks pretty good).  My adolescent years was damaged because of the band, so reopening this mental wound does lead to personal spite.

But there are objective things to legitimately castrate this movie.  The biggest problem with the movie is that it's aimless.  The Spice Girls were setting up for a concert, they had a convenient pregnant best friend to chat with, their agent was pushing them to work hard and not have fun, and a tabloit journalist hired a sleazy paparazzo to tarnish the band because he's bored.  Everything else is practically plotless, just random scenarios that segue into other random scenarios.  They sing in different places, they meet celebrity cameos, they go on a photo shoot, two American studio execs are pitching a Spice Girls movie out of the blue, they ride on sport boats with their contest-winning fangirls, they were in a military dance camp with a stern gestappo instructor, and they were discovered by an alien race who loved their music.  There's no connection with each of these scenarios, the randomness of the goofball situations is akin to ""Family Guy"".  It also means these situations are practically idiotic in direction, if not just wordy whenever the girls just run their months about stuff only pre-teens would get into.

Just to hide the fact that the Spice Girls have no acting talent, the rest of the actors have to be completely bonkers. Their agent acts like if Ari Gold popped some speed and drank a pack of red bull, the tabloit guy is pontifically British, and the studio execs are so desperately perverse when they pitch the worst ideas ever in a film, almost like a parallel to this film; the execs even ripped-off an idea from a show pilot in ""Pulp Fiction"" (Spice Force Five, get it?). Neither of them are funny, they're just pretentious, much like the movie's gags.

Again, I'm being biased.  I am not the film's audience, the audience are young impressionable girls who loved the band's songs.  This movie understood its intended audience, that's why the Spice Girls went on an S&M club, they let their pregnant friend drink alcohol, they wear revealing outfits, an alien nearly copped a feel on Scary Spice, and their agent threatened to hang himself live in concert if the band didn't show up.  But seriously, the audience for this movie is limited at this point.  It wasn't long after the movie's release that Ginger Spice followed her own independent example and left the band, which cause the foundation to crumble and the fans had to move on.  I could say the Spice Girls are gone for good (and no, I'm not counting their world tour stunt a few years back that lasted only a week), but something life has a funny way of turning things around.  If New Kids on the Block manage to get together&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/and-release-an-album-not-too-long-ago/dp/B001LN2W38/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">and release an album not too long ago</a>, it's possible that this girl group would rekindle their friendship.

6869,5,0767808673,"Fine, this is a silly movie and if you weren't a fan, you probably won't get that much from this now. Solution: don't buy the DVD.

BUT if like me, you are (/were) a fan of the Spice Girls, give Spice World a try (or another try)! I watched this movie in the fifth grade when it first came out and I loved it then. That said, I'm not always sure I knew what I was thinking back then, so I was inclined to think that 12 years later, I'd find the movie ridiculous. My friend with whom I watched this also had the same expectations. But nope, we were pleasantly surprised to find that Spice World was still a great movie. It was ridiculous, but great.

Maybe it was the lowered expectations, but really, if you take this movie for what it is - a film about the Spice Girls having fun and making something for their fans - it is very entertaining. Again, it wasn't made for the Academy (though the acting wasn't so bad), it was made for fans. You can sing along to the songs that were their hits in the 90's and laugh at the jokes and implausible scenarios as loudly as you did in 1997.

Yes it was silly, at times it was a kind of duh humour that you may have heard before in one way or another. But it was never dull. I enjoyed their good natured shenanigans and thought that they actually did a good job for a showcase movie.

Im sorry that as a group they didn't last as long nor did their reunion concert that I attended with my then 13 year old daughter catapult them into a new vibrancy.

6877,3,0767808673,"Ten years after they first become famous, the Spice Girls recently toured again. It's all over now until they start to run low again on funds, but with their tour came a re-release of Spice World, the movie. Now I can honestly say, this film is no classic. But hey, it's good classic fun, with lots of British celebrity cameos, and bad acting (from all the Spice Girls but especially from Victoria), but it provides a few laughs.

The story is quite complicated, cos it seems to jump around quite a bit, and is extremely jumbled. Basically every plot they could think about they threw in.

I was a Spice Girls fan. I wasn't broken hearted when they 'broke up', and followed Geri when she went solo, but they were still good poppy songs, and I had all their albums. I think I still do. This was done before Geri went skinny, blonder, and didn't want to be known as a former Spice Girl. Mel B was still loud & brash, Victoria was in the early beginnings of her romance with a certain footballer, before she would take over the world (it seems that way), and Emma & Mel C seemed to have stayed remarkably the same.

There's a whole host of famous British faces in this. Gary Glitter was supposed to have a cameo, but that was quickly cut from the film when he was arrested. (But they kept in the song ""Do You Want To Be In My Gang?"") Other famous faces are Michael Barrymore, Meatloaf, Elvis Costello, Alan Cumming, Neil Fox (in voice only thank God), Stephen Fry, Bob Geldof, Richard E Grant, Jools Holland, Bob Hoskins, Elton John, Hugh Laurie, Roger Moore, Naoko Mori (now in Torchwood), Richard O'Brien, Jonathan Ross, Jennifer Saunders ... Phew. I bet I've missed someone out.

Spice World is one of those films that you will be embarrassed to admit you own, but it's joined by many more in my DVD collection, so I'm not embarrassed in the slightest. It's harmless fun.",1204588800,,1871,4.478005865102639

While it won't be on AFI's top 100 films list, it will definitely be on the list of pop-culture because like the movie the Spice Girls are part of pop-culture history.  With the girls on tour now there's no better time to pick up this movie and look back on the girls when they ruled the world.

So I have no idea what drove me to watch it again now, let alone buy it. But it seems that the wisdom that comes with growing older, and growing out of a taste for teen pop, leaves me with an ability to finally appreciate Spice World for what it is: a slight, yet unpretentious and oftentimes hilarious film that doesn't take itself too seriously and is having an awful lot of fun doing it.

Seriously, the Spice Girls seem to be natural comediennes. Their comic timing is brilliant, and they all have personality to spare. (Their lip-synching abilities are another matter.) There's also an amazing host of well-known British actors who you'd normally think wouldn't be caught dead in a film like this - Alan Cummings, Bob Hoskins, Stephen Fry for starters. I particularly loved Richard E. Grant as their uptight, controlling manager. I recognized him as the devious butler from Gosford Park, and his character here is a complete 180 of that.

6886,4,0767808673,"The movie pulse review above is a little too short sighted to understand why people would enjoy this film. Their review is more like the kind of arrogant criticism you'd expect from these self proclaimed critics
. Movies are enjoyable for a number of reasons. First you have what some consider high art. A lot of times although these films are original and at times can have great imagination they normally are not very fun to watch and are generally boring. You also have your big blockbuster movies with huge budgets. Hollywood movies that put millions of dollars into everything from actors to their catering. Once and a while hollywood can hit the mark and many of us can name off a few films in this category we enjoy but, we all know that big dollars do not always equal entertainment nor a good film. Then you have your independant and B-films.  Films with smaller budgets that do what they can with what they have. In terms of fun and entertainment they are much the same as the high budget films (hit and miss). Lastly and more to the point we have campy films. Some are not intended to be and some are. What can generally be agreed upon is that when we watch  movies such as these we don't watch them because they'll win some sort of award (how shallow is it to only enjoy films because they can or have won an oscar). No, we watch these movies(and movies in general)for their intended reason...To be entertained and have a good time. This seems to be what moviepulse has forgotten. Their review is more intent on picking apart the film for it's lack of ""Academy Award"" standards in which all films must apparently shoot for in order to get good reviews. They forgot to tell us if the movie was fun watch. They neglected to say if there were audiences out there that found this film enjoyable. their review is unbias and narrow minded.

This gets me to my point. The spice girls movie is by no means an award winner but if you enjoy campy films that will make you laugh and leave you feeling entertained when they are over then give this movie a chance. Of course this was a Spice Girl vehicle. They were at the height of their popularity. Anything they would have done would have been seen that way. The movie resemble the Beatles ""a hard days night""? Well try and find a film that does not pilfer from another. A lot of times films a slammed because they resemble another film. Most movies are this way and few films are so fresh and new as to boast complete originality. I own this movie and watch it regularly. Many of my friends did not want to watch it. They had the same ""noses turn up"" view of this movie as moviepulse yet after one viewing they not only liked it but have seen it multiple times after the fact. if you like the spice girls then it's a no brainer but if you don't I still recommend this film. It's a riot and you'll have  great time watching it.",1196208000,5,2879,4.375700934579439
6897,1,0767808673,"Little more than an excuse to exploit the success of the Spice Girls, Spice World is a grossly lacking film, even for those who enjoy the music. Essentially a ripoff of The Beatles ""A Hard Days Night"", the Spice Girls are unfortunately not nearly as famous and their music not nearly as universally recognized. A slew of cameos and familiar supporting cast members can't save the film from its own bad dialogue, poor choreography and painful lip-syncing. Apparently everyone was in it for the paycheck.

Piers Cuthbertson-Smyth (Alan Cumming) is a documentarian desperately trying to obtain footage for his latest project, a look at the popular five-girl singing group The Spice Girls: Ginger (Geri Halliwell), Baby (Emma Bunton), Posh (Victoria Beckham), Sporty (Melanie Chisholm) and Scary (Melanie Brown). While he struggles to sneak into parties and onto sets where they practice, the girls themselves prepare for a big stage show in England. Meanwhile, their eccentric manager is in cahoots with Chief (Roger Moore) the man who feels he is responsible for their success and can take it away with a snap of his fingers, or a caress of his squealing bovine. And if that isn't enough, a mysterious paparazzi spy gets carried away snapping pictures of the fivesome and pasting it all over the headlines. To top it all off, a pair of filmmakers pitch their idea of a Spice Girl movie to studio executives, which as it turns out, is basically the very movie we're watching.

Since the story of the film is largely pointless, and little else really holds attention spans, it is easy to pick out inaccuracies and bits of concepts that don't quite add up. For starters, the girls drive around in the Spice Bus, a blue and red monstrosity that has an impossibly large interior. So impossibly large in fact, that it doesn't even pretend to make sense. Workout equipment, couches, beds and all sorts of other furniture are scattered throughout the inside of the bus, in shots that are clearly not capable of being inside the bus. And yet the filmmakers go so far as to show the flashing lights of other vehicles zipping by the bus windows, even though the realism has long since been abandoned.

While each Spice Girl physically embodies stereotypical fashions, physiques and attitudes, those characteristics don't translate over to their personalities. Either they were all scripted to be ditzy, or they're just naturally that way. Through constant daydream sequences they act out various scenarios, most of which are intended as comedy relief, despite the blatant absence of humor. Similarly, the dance and song segments arise from nonsensical situations, and they're choreographed with little self-respect, and with obnoxious elements such as an Army dance instructor and poor lip-syncing. Alan Cumming plays a character very much like we envision him to be in his everyday life, and Roger Moore embarrassingly plays a villain who strokes various furry animals and speaks in riddles, an obvious farce of his own James Bond evildoers.

With brief appearances by Elton John, Bob Hoskins and other well-known Brits, a wholeheartedly unexciting speedboat adventure, and countless attempts at failed humor, Spice World is still unable to create entertainment that reaches beyond diehard fans of the all-girl group. And even entertaining those fans is debatable. When the group revives an unconscious sick kid by suggesting that Ginger Spice take her top off, it's apparent that their true talents are not in the music.

This effort is an attempt to cash in on the phenomenon before a fickle populace turns their attention to the next best thing.  To be fair, the girls are not to blame for what a tedious flick this is.  Rather, they are appealing and prove to be the film's lone redeeming factor.  The fault lies in the script that tries to do for the Spice Girls what ""A Hard Days' Night"" did for the Beatles.  Whereas the Fab Four's film was full of wit and cogent commentary on Beatlemania this flick is unfunny and basically incoherent about what it's trying to say about the Spice craze.

Instead of a cat he now keeps a pig in his lap. Very cool idea! As with David Lean's DOCTOR ZHIVAGO it is about a few years in the turbulent life of the all-female Anglo-Soviet assembly. The Spy and Spice Girls have plenty of character, and that helps make up for the lack of action and adventure that keeps their movie debut from being a truly epic motion picture. The concert scene at Albert Hall in London was very reminiscent of Hitchcock's THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH. It was kind of a 90's version on some of his themes as well as David Lean's and those of the Bond producers. However, it has a potential of being cult epic like AUSTIN POWERS. Perhaps not.

6937,4,0767808673,"Back in 1997 when the Spice Girls ruled the charts 2 years after what I like to call the Ace of Base era and before the boy/girl band/group era, no could ever imagine the girls being in a movie. But that is what people got and even now 7 years later, it is still a fun ride if not a little outdated.

For anyone who remembers the phenonom that was the Spice Girls, you can not but conjure up some thoughts (let them be negative or positive) about their rein. Their music was catchy and when listening to it in this day and age can bring a person to a calmer time in life.

If you grew up in the latter part of the 90's you cannot fullly appreicate this movie no matter how hard you try.

The reason for this is that the movie just has no plot. I will agree with everyone else and say that this movie is completely pointless. But that does not make it a bad movie. It actually makes it more of a golden treat.

Cashing in on their popularity, this movie was made by mixing the girls, fictional characters, aliens, nostalgic and outdated jokes (by todays standards) and complete nonsense. It does it all in a clever formula.

The most rewarding part of the movie for anyone though has to be the first time you see the girls faces. You remember them in your head, but when you actually see them on screen for the first time in 7 years, you can not help but to admire their beauty for several minutes on end. They look great. Posh is still hot, Baby is innocence done right, Sporty is still a cutie, Scary is still scary in a good way, and Geri just looks fine.

Overall, this movie is a great way to spend a hour and a half on a weekend esp. if you want to go back a time when everyone was happy. Literally.",1105920000,,1704,4.117469879518072
6938,1,0767808673,"Spiceworld: The Movie is a movie starring the Spice Girls.

What....you want a plot? Sorry, there just isn't one. Well, nothing that could be coherently described as a plot, anyway. The target audience of this movie won't realize this, but what we get is a collection of music videos very very loosely tied together around a number of dismal subplots.

To give you some idea of the looseness of the subplots, some of them involved;

A snooty bumbling reporter, Piers Cuthbertson-Smyth (Alan Cumming) filming a documentary on the ""real"" Spice Girls. He wanders about with his moronic crew, bumping into things and falling over a lot.

A spitulous newspaper mogul, Kevin McMaxford (Barry Humphreys) whose goal is to break up the Spice Girls so that he can sell more newspapers, and his associated super sleazy press photographer.

An impotent, stressed out manager - Clifford (Richard E. Grant).

A bizarre quoter of nonsense played by Roger Moore who is supposedly the big Chief.

A very pregnant friend of the Spice Girls who goes into labour whilst dancing at a nightclub.

A movie producer (George Wendt)and writer following Clifford around pitching Spice Girl movie ideas at him which he keeps rejecting until, surprise, surprise, they pitch the idea for this movie to him, and he agrees.

Aliens that have heard of the Spice Girls and want their autographs (whilst they are in the bush looking for a place to pee). I'm not making this one up, honestly.

The movie also featured a bus with a Union Jack plastered all over it which was the Spiceworld tour bus. They must have put Dr Who's Tardis somewhere in this bus, since it was an awful lot bigger inside than outside, but never mind about that. Meatloaf drove the bus.",1105315200,4,1725,4.816949152542373
6939,1,0767808673,"What a roller coaster ride of a movie. I say this not because it had me at the edge of my seat with excitement but because it made me vomit allover myself. Wow, where do I even begin? Ok how about this? You know how a movie can be so bad that in a way its actually kind of good. Well this movie was so bad that it just flew past that point quicker than Rick James' heartbeat after a 4 day coke binge, and then went back around full circle to being just plan horrible.

I don't know how this can even be characterized as a movie because a movie requires a plot of some kind. I could have taken a blank piece of paper. Conjured up the biggest loogie that I could possibly make. One with a small solid chunk in it and with a nice faint yellowish hue. Spit it on the paper and have made a better script then the one used in this movie. There must have been something wrong with either the tape I was viewing or my VCR, because about halfway through, the picture fluttered and the screen went blue for about 7mins. I witnessed more plot turns and more character development in this 7min span of blue screen, then I did throughout the whole rest of the movie.

This movie left me so violated that at the ending credits I felt like a preschooler leaving the Never Land Ranch after a week long slumber party. At one point I just couldn't take anymore. I tried to stand and walk to the TV to shut it off, but I was so mentally and physically exhausted from viewing this movie that I couldn't even make it to my feet. Watching this movie required the use of muscles that I don't usually use on a regular basis. My body actually physically ached with soreness for 3 days after viewing this sick joke of a film. During one of the musical montages I sincerely feared that my brain cells may try to euthanize themselves to avoid enduring this torture any longer. The extent of psychological damage this movie has caused me is immeasurable. I now have recurring Nam flashbacks and I didn't even fight in Nam. Sometimes I'll just start weeping out of the blue like when Richard Simmons consoles a grossly overweight woman. I developed a drinking habit. I lost my job. All the hopes and dreams I once had are now lost, just like the fat from around Jarrids' midsection, all because of ""Spice World""

Director Bob Spiers should receive a beating so bad that The Gooch wouldn't even unleash it upon Arnold Jackson, for recording these ghastly events on film. If the spermaceti that was responsible for producing Bob Spiers knew that he would later go on to make this movie. It would have screamed out kamikaze and took a fatal dive into the sticky mucus lining of the fallopian tubes, instead of fertilizing the egg. Just think about how destructive, to the whole human race, Spice World can be. This next statement may sound very farfetched but in all likelihood it's not completely inconceivable. God forbid this would ever happen, but for a moment just imagine that all intelligent life on this planet was eradicated by some sort of plague. Now imagine that after hundreds of thousands of years a new race were to discover our planet and start studying who we were and how we lived. Imagine how they would marvel at some of our discoveries and inventions. They would be mesmerized by the huge skyscrapers we erected. Our knowledge of medicine, electricity, the automobile, the computer, and the family size George Foreman Lean Mean Fat Reduceing Grilling Machine with bun warmer. They would be awed by some of our great poets, artists and philosophers. Just imagine what they would learn from us. Imagine the respect and admiration they would have for us. That is until one of them were to unearth ""Spice World"". The respect they once had for our hole race would be taken back faster than a bowl of cereal from Trix The Rabbit. Where we were once hailed as kings we would now be reduced to nothing more than the butts of their jokes like blondes, the Polish and Janet Jacksons' Nipple. All because of ""Spice World"".

So in closeing. Whatever you do, do not buy or watch this movie, and if for some reason you already own it at least make sure you keep it locked up tighter then Martha Stewart. It may help preserve our good name in the long run.",1104537600,8,4229,4.445876288659794

Well, I'm not embarassed to admit that the Spice Girls are one of my guilty pleasures.  Granted, their music may be a little hokey, but they sure are fun to listen to.  In ""Spice World,"" the girls take on a world tour with Bond-esque style.  This movie isn't fantastic, but it is fun enough for the whole family to watch.  It's silly, it's goofy, and, at times, it is brilliant.  You get a feel of what these ladies had to put up with on a daily basis, albeit in a grand and over-the-top style.  There are cameos abound in this flick as well.  The acting isn't that bad and the girls seemed to enjoy making the movie.
Funny moments abound in this flick, but some of my personal favorites are when the girls first get on their tour bus and they complain about how hot it is.  They say that they could use a fan and, in perfect British comedic style, a young, pre-teen girl comes through the door screaming with glee and then runs back out the door.  The girls sigh with comfortable relief.  Another funny moment is the expensive, special-effects laden tour-bus jumping a draw-bridge with Posh behind the wheel scene.  Finally, in the end credits, the girls ""interact"" with the audience. They remark on people making out, wonder why folks watching their video can't find anything good on the ""telly"" and audience member clothes.  The entire movie is just a fun little trip.
Alan Cumming(X-Men 2, Josey and the Pussycats) takes a turn as a reporter attempting to document the lives of these ladies.  George Wendt(Norm, of 'Cheers' fame)is a movie producer looking for a film to put the girls in and cash in on their fame.  Meatloaf is the bus driver for the girls.  Some of the better-known cameos that American audiences will recognize are Elton John, Bob Hoskins and Roger Moore.  If you're a die-hard fan of British film and television, you'll recognize many of the other cameos as well.
The only reason I'm giving this movie three stars is because,obviously, this movie isn't for everyone.  In fact, many people might think that this movie is just too silly to watch.  On my personal scale, I would give this flick four stars for the simple fact that I love to watch it and because the Spice Girls don't take themselves too seriously in the movie.
Overall, this is a silly, blatantly cheesy movie that lets you laugh at and with the Spice Girls.  They poke fun at themselves and have a good time doing it.  A good movie to watch when you have a little time to kill or just want to forget about the world(but not the 'Spice World') for awhile.",1077148800,17,2676,4.53125

So good that I ACTURALLY bought the movie on VHS and then updated to DVD.  I watched it on VHS and it was okay but when I popped in the DVD ... it lost it's magic.

1.) Quality - The picture was great.  Clear and perfect.  The only problem with the picture was it was too dark to even see who was who.
2.)  Music - Couldn't they had put more felling into the music and acturally, I don't know, sing for once.  I know you lip-sing in music videos but, if you really want to get the crowd going and yelling for a sequel or another Spice movie, just sing and don't be scared and stupid as lets say, Britney Spears is.

This was back when I was around 13-14, when I wasn't really into music as much as I am now, but I did like Rob Zombie a lot, and he was just PERFECT to get that trash out of my head!
Onto this movie... If you want a movie about a GOOD British band, check out ""This IS Spinal Tap""
well at least the Spice Girls didn't call theirselves 'punk', unlike another band that rhymes with Hood Farlette....

(I admit I had a crush on Baby Spice, but other that that, BLEECCCCHHHHH.)
Right about when these talentless hacks became popular, I was in fifth grade, and every girl in my class (plus a couple of guys...) had to have EVERYTHING with their stupid faces on it. Me and my friends were starting to get into nu-metal like KoRn and Wimp Bizkit (hey, we were in fifth grade, give us a break), and everywhere you went, you got attacked by a bunch of prissy peabrains running around going ""GIRL POWER!!!!"" Oy vey. Well, that's okay. Thank god that these mental midgets are no longer around to sully the media any further.
This garbage, along with those ever-annoying Hansons, get my vote for the worst fads of the late '90s. Both ""acts"" are illogical, dull-witted, implausible, unreasoned, muddled, stupid, cloddish, thickheaded, nettlesome, maddening, harassing, and just plain flat out a waste of some perfectly good blank DVD's/CD's.

The music is top-notch (although I'm still wondering why their cover of ""Leader Of The Gang"" seen in the film remains unreleased), and the acting is well done (in a sort of inexperienced Beatles / A Hard Day's Night sort of way).  No, it's not an Oscar contender, but is is fun.  As a former fan of the group (I gave up when Geri Halliwell left - she was my favorite) I recommend Spice World to anyone who wants to have a good time.  It's fun!",1060819200,,600,3.975

I look at the bad reviews of the movie, and wonder how many people have actually WATCHED the movie? Did they just give it one star because they hate the Spice Girls? I think that was probably the case for most reviewers. Congratulations to the people who gave it 4 or 5 star reviews - you're not ashamed to admit you liked the movie! I also liked it. The Spice Girls may not be popular anymore or what you'd call the latest thing, but they were a fantastic girl band. I bet nearly everyone had at least one song they liked from the girls.
But anyway, onto the movie itself. It's damn hilarious! I don't know how so many people didn't think it was funny! I think it's amusing now, and it's been 6 years since it came out in the theatres. The storyline is a bit thin, I have to admit, but the jokes are funny, not cheesy. I especially like the bit where Geri and Mel B are playing chess and Mel B doesn't understand the rules and Geri says she's gonna slap her. Also another funny bit is the part where Victoria says she doesn't know what to wear, and Mel C muses over whether Victoria should wear the ""little Gucci dress, the little Gucci dress OR the little Gucci dress"" as Mel C says. Then Emma chimes in ""I think you should wear the little Gucci dress!"". I like the part near the end where the two movie directors are telling the story to Clifford and everything is happening to the girls.
The cheesy parts of the movie include the aliens and the part on the boat. The most dramatic part of the film is the bit where the Spice Girls are having a fight with Clifford and they all storm off.
The movie begins with a Top Of The Pops version of ""Too Much"" and ends with a fantastic performance of ""Spice Up Your Life"". The rest of the Spiceworld album is played during the movie.
My favourite Spice Girl is Emma, and she had some funny lines during the movie.
Overall, Spiceworld is a funny movie that doesn't deserve all the negative reviews.",1060646400,2,2215,4.165501165501166

Motion Picture: 4 stars

At the height of girl power, when ""Baby"", ""Posh"", ""Scary"", ""Sporty"" and ""Ginger"" were words regularly spoken in all parts of the globe, the famous five dropped their sophomore album (and accompanying movie) ""Spiceworld"".  A little more outspoken, vibrant, mature and innovative, this album one ups the Spice Girls debut in attitude, but lacks the freshness.  In other words, if ""Spice"" was the girls' declaration, ""Spiceworld"" was their confirmation.

I'm a Spice Girl junkie: My walls were plastered with photos, and I had several pairs of platform shoes (which regularly caused sprained ankles).  I wore my hair in pigtails, flashed girl power/peace hand signs everywhere and owned a Spice keychain.  But that's beside the point.  The Spice Girls were a novelty, no doubt.  But while they lasted, they were fun.  ""Spiceworld"" achieves fun with ease and showcases bolder lyrics from the girls.  This could be considered a concept album: Many of the songs allude to a world ruled by the Spices, and what the result of such an impossibility would be.  The album artwork itself is unique, with each girl appearing at her spicy best and a backdrop of stars with the lone Planet Spice floating by.

In many ways, this album feels a bit more retro than ""Spice"", and is far more diverse.  There are obvious references to disco scattered throughout, such as ""Never Give Up On The Good Times"", ""Denying"" and ""Do It"", all peppy and uppity numbers designed mostly to get the listener up and moving around.  ""Never..."" does the best job, opening with an addictive drum loop and transitioning into a syncopated organ melody: The message screams girl power, with lyrics encouraging women who may have lost their edge to regain their strength and beauty.  The song has always been a favorite of mine, and would have been a great single.  It embodies the spirit of the Spice Girls perfectly.  ""Stop"" sounds a bit like something you might have heard back in the 50's or 60's, especially during the chorus.  It's very sugary, lighthearted and fast.  ""Move Over"" cranks it up a notch with guitars and lots of distortion (very 80's).  The lyrics are pretty innovative and there's a lot of rapping between the ladies.  ""The Lady Is A Vamp"" is the girls' musical montage of idols and heroes, backed by flirty horns and clarinets.  ""Spice Up You Life"" is one of the Spices signature tunes, loaded with fire, drama and lots of exotic instrumentation.  ""Saturday Night Divas"" opening melodies are instantly appealing and while the rest of the track isn't much to scream about, the vocals alone make it worthwhile.

The exciting dance tracks convey girl power, but it's the lush ballads that really showcase the girls' vocals.  ""Too Much"", the song used to open the girls film debut, oozes sophistication and uncertainty.  For the first time, the Spices seemed to really put some emotion into what they were singing.  The vocals are accompanied by a fabulous string arrangement and a beautifully executed horn solo.  The best is yet to come with ""Viva Forever"".  One of the girls most beloved tracks, it includes some wonderful low melodies and emits raw emotion accompanied by Latin undertones.  A Spanish guitar frequently adds sensitivity and romance to the track.

The Spice Girls were never fantastic singers, but they worked with what they had, amped the sassiness and sang with gusto.  Despite a short reign, breakup, seemingly infinite hiatus, and a reunion spoiled by lack of enthusiasm and nostalgia, the Spice Girls made their mark in history.  The world is much more fun for it.

(See below for the ""Spice World"" motion picture review)

Lets face it.  Anybody who loved the Spice Girls was mostly in love with the attitude, the look and the companionship between the ladies.  I know this because I have always been a huge fan, since February 1997.  The Spice Girls gave young teenage girls a reason to want to be gorgeous, witty and smart, and they gave the boys a reason to love women, body and mind.  After Geri's departure and even after the unoffical breakup of the band, Spiceworld has lost none of it's flavor.

Not meant to be a tear-jerker, action film or any form of comic genius, the movie was purely meant for fun and publicity.  What many didn't expect was the movie's ability to take even the biggest Spice haters and make them laugh, even if it was AT the girls themselves.  Cleverly written in glorious Britain comedic form, the girls took their roles and ran with them, exaggerating every bit of their personalities.  This movie is a fantasy, what the world would be like if it all revolved around the Spice girls.

There's a bus with an interior much larger than it appears on the outside, a band that goes by the girls' schedule (even if it means taking a two hour break to visit with pregnant friend Nicolla), a director whose soul purpose in life it seems is to create a documentary about the girls in a realistic environment, and strangely enough nobody mauls the ladies when they're roaming freely in clubs or on the street.  But who cares, this film is meant to take you to another universe anyway.

Almost every line is a memorable one, especially the lines between ladies.  ""I'm always going to be known as Baby Spice, even when I'm... thirty!""  Emma pouts.  ""I never know what to wear...""  moans the vivacious Vicky.  ""My boots Geri, you're wearing my boots!""  Screams Mel B as her usual loud self.  ""Why do people stereotype us, all the time?""  The peacemaker Mel C sighs.  ""If you're looking for a fight, you're gonna lose!""  The bubbly and bright Geri strikes again.  There's dozens more lines that you'll remember after you watch this film.  And it's not just the girls that get the great lines, the supporting characters do as well.

Not only does the film have clever writing, but the color in the movie is great.  The girls wear their brightest outfits, and everywhere they go, the colors seem to come to life around them.  There's one particular scene where the girls perform in Spain and the body-builder dancers wear pastel purple suits.  The girls' bus is a giant British flag driving down the road, and the inside is lush with color.  Another great scene is the photo shoot, where the girls wear various costumes including Marilyn Monroe, Danny and Sandy from Grease, and they also dress up as each other which is the best part.

Another big perk the movie is its soundtrack, made up of entirely Spice Girl songs.  All the big hits including Say You'll Be There, 2 Become 1, Too Much and even Wannabe (done as a version before the girls got big) are in the movie.

A mindless but perky movie, Spiceworld is fun and entertaining.  In the end, the girls finally make it to the theater to perform their concert and even the cop in the audience is dancing.  Unrealistic... yes.  Unenjoyable?  Goodness no.",1057795200,,6866,4.765055131467345
6973,3,0767808673,"When a group that's the real flavour of the moment decides to make a movie, it'll either be a total success or a total flop, depending upon how universally-loved the group is.  The Beatles are hands down the most successful (Hard Day's Night, Help!) due to their immortalized status.  Others have not been so, e.g. Herman's Hermits, Bill Haley.  The Spice Girls kind of fall inbetween the two.
The primary influence is probably A Hard Day's Night.  Spiceworld is, after all, a day in the life of the Girls, and includes  musical numbers, an uptight manager, and a triumphant concert number.  Needless to say, it will never stand side-by-side with the Beatles' groundbreaking classic.
One credit in their favour is the scene where they parody their own personalities.  Victoria, for example, can't decide whether to wear the black Gucci dress, the black Gucci dress, or the black Gucci dress in her closet.  To which Emma successfully suggests, ""why don't you wear the black Gucci dress?""  Emma's baby-like innocence is also parodied.  And Geri's misquote on the Pope is a parody of what John Lennon said about Jesus.
They seem to have the most fun trying on different costumes in the ""Saturday Night Divas"" number.  Geri as Marilyn Monroe in The Seven Year Itch and Wonder Woman shines out in particular, as do Mel C. and Geri as Danny and Sandy from Grease, and Victoria as Honey Rider in Dr. No.  But the best is when some of them dress up as each other.
There are some subplots along the way, such as a documentary team following the Girls, the Girls' very pregnant friend Nicola who pops up every now and then, and a tabloid publisher who hates the girls so much, he hatches a plot to tarnish their image.  The tensions between the girls and their uptight manager Clifford, and an American film producer (George Wendt of Cheers) who consults Clifford to discuss a movie deal involving the girls.  Their Spice Force Five idea (think Spice Girls as Charlie's Angels) is actually a good segment.
There are amusing guest cameos from well-known British actors and singers, such as Richard Briers, Hugh Laurie (Wooster in Jeeves and Wooster), Stephen Fry (Jeeves in J and W), Bob Geldof, Elvis Costello, Elton John, and AbFab's Jennifer Saunders.
I doubt if Roger Moore would consider this movie as his best performance, but he seems to be enjoying himself as the Girls' behind-the-scenes handler, with some really hideous lines:  ""The drummer without sticks has no backbeat.""  Richard E. Grant though gets noteworthy mention as Clifford.  The scene of him having a real fit at seeing tabloid headlines bashing the girls is funny, but the girls laugh it off and even make fun of him, which makes him even madder.  Meat Loaf is Dennis, the Girls' loyal bus driver, and there's an in-joke when he's asked to add repairing the bus-toilet to his list of duties.  ""I love those girls.  I'll do anything for them, but I won't do that.""  Hint:  his last hit single.
The performances in this movie may depend upon which Spice Girl is your favourite.  In my case, it's Geri, Emma, and Mel C. in that order, but love or hate the movie, all the Spice Girls are still very charming and lovable.  Songs done in this movie in order:  ""Too Much"", ""Do It"", ""Say You Will Be There"", ""Mama"", ""Denying"", ""Saturday Night Divas"", ""Stop"", ""2 Become 1"", ""Leader Of The Gang"", ""Never Give Up On The Good Times"", ""My Boy Lollipop"", ""Wannabe"", ""Viva Forever"", ""Who Do You Think You Are"", ""Spice Up Your Life"", and ""The Lady Is A Vamp.""

The Spice Girls spoke to my heart and to those of millions of adoring fans around the world. The Spice Girls were better than the Beatles or the Rolling Stones. The Spice Girls had REAL music that touched our hearts. They had an upbeat, motivating message unlike the Beatles who gave us nothing but nonsensical lyrics and gloomy moods.
One of the darkest days in my life was when Ginger left the group. It was devastating for me. She was part of the soul of the group and I blame Scary Spice for messing that up. Also, they dumped their manager who brilliantly guided the group into being one of the top groups in history. Again, Scary is to blame.

7012,4,0767808673,"Ya, the spice girls aren't nearly as popular as they used to be, ok not at all, but sure ther were when they were around! And so that makes this a pretty good movie since I was a big spice girl fan. These girls are really funny here!",972604800,,233,3.875
7013,5,0767808673,"The auteur theory of filmmaking is alive and kicking in this cinematic vehicle for the girls. ""Auteur theory?"" you may ask. ""Yes, most definitively."" The trend of cinema and other forms of art as a mainstream attraction and influence on everyday life have escalated to gargantuan proportions. As society becomes more ""plastic"" the perpetuators of ""plastic"" want to exponentially increase their monopolistic viewpoint and hold on the retail market and thus their hold on the individual. Many critics compared this film to ""A Hard Day's Night"" but they are sadly missing the point. ""A Hard Day's Night"" was the last film as that traversed the void from innocence into cynicism. George Harrison's scene with the advertising executive was a forerunner of thing to come as big business learns how to mold the teenage market. ""Spice"" in its entirety is about big business and the teenage market. Roger Moore seen with a pig in his lap is not doing a James Bond parody of Blofeld. Roger's character is commenting on big business and the plastic society it has created. That's no ordinary pig in his lap. That's a golden pig.",972086400,,1117,4.915343915343915

7015,3,0767808673,"I admit that this movie was good but it is no ""Hard Days Night"". Spice Girls tried to copy many things that were in HDN, for example, lateness for a concert.

Fly by the seat of your pants, enjoy  every moment, dress up in funny costumes. And most of all love yourself for  who you are.  Even though the film is considered a cult film it is a blast  to watch even if you AREN'T a spice fan.  It's so stupid it's hilarious  (kinda like the live action George of the Jungle) and the music is great.  I truly recommend this movie for a party cuz that's the time laughs come  the easiest and stupid stuff doesn't matter.  You know you want it!",966902400,,661,4.216
7022,1,0767808673,"I'm begining to understand why The Beatles left England.  This movie is the cinematic equivilant of watching paint dry.  Here, at last, is a movie where one can miss 30 minutes of it and not miss any plot points.  It's the  kind of movie you shouldn't buy snacks for because there's no telling how  long they'll stay down.  This flick is as contrived and mindless as their  music.  But I suppose the point is that they made lots of money -- they  certainly got my brother's [money].  I suppose it's my own fault for  watching it. A good veiwing tip would be a full-frontal lobotomy.  Spice up  your life....",966643200,,607,4.458715596330276
7023,5,0767808673,"Considered now by many as a cult classic, ""Spice World,"" marks the feature-film debut of Britain's most famous band since the Beatles. Directed by television veteran Bob Spiers (""Ab Fab""), the movie  focuses on the girls during a few days in their hectic life, as they  prepare for their big gig at Royal Albet Hall in London.
The movie's  camp factor helps in boosting the film's appeal with teenagers and  pop-culture fans, and although the acting is not that great, the film gives  us many hilarious scenarios including a Mission Impossible-based fantasy  called ""Spice Force 5,"" and an enjoyable photo shoot where the  girls imitate major pop icons of the past and themselves.
The songs from  the band's first two albums provide the film's soundtrack with a diverse  selection of tunes that keeps the film together. I only wished that  producers released a compilation album of the band's songs that were  remixed for this film (""Who do You Think You Are"" sounds wicked  in a techno beat).
The film's other highlight includes multiple cameo  appearances by such personalities as Sir Elton John, Bob Geldof, Meatloaf,  Bob Hoskins, Roger Moore, George Wendt, and one of the actress from the  ""Ab Fab"" series. All give wonderful comic performances.
The  film's worst scene involves the girls' encounter with aliens during a  midnight hike in the woods. Personally, this scene seems out-of-place in  such a film. Richard E. Grant is great as the girls' manager, and the  film's subplot of a tabloid thrasher going after the girls makes it much  more fun to watch.
Reminiscent of a ""Hard Day's Night,"" Spice  World will garner more new fans throughout the year as the film is aired on  television and at midnight-movie festivals. If you want a fun, fun movie,  wthen this is it!",961977600,25,1778,4.89261744966443

7025,3,0767808673,"Who cares if the plot made no sense, who cares if they couldn't act, what did you expect?  These are the Spice Girls!  No one ever nominated them for a Grammy, so why should you critize them for not trying to use millions  of dollars to get an Oscar nomination? It's sorta sick to see so many  movies try to break box office records and get Oscar noms. They just wanted  to make a movie in which you could just sit back and laugh. They didn't  expect to last forever as a band, or actresses. So get over it! I got this  movie over a year ago and I still watch it from time to time. It's just a  time capsule of how earth was durin the brief moment it was known as Spice  World. It would've been worse if these girls actually took themselves  seriously and tried to go off and act in 'real movies'.

Nothing wrong with liking it either but at least be aware that its all propaganda, don't fall for the con - it ain't real! The Spice  Girls did NOT know each other, grow up together and slug their guts out to  get known by people.(...)Oh, and as a film, this is awful.  Self indulgent nonsense with no plot, extremely annoying and insulting. And  if this is who the Spice Girls really are, why can't they act? I mean, how  can you NOT act your own personality?

There were some really fun parts in the film, like when they  swapped roles, and dressed up as their favourite idols. (Nothing like  playing dress-ups!) I loved it when they sang the old Gary Glitter song.  They made fun of themselves a little, which is always a good thing.  They  may not be the most talented or gorgeous beings in the world, but at least  they don't make you want to die of sadness like a lot of acts today do  (well, depending on who you are!)

Granted, the acting is what you  would expect from a bunch of singers, but what did anyone expect?  Anyone  who feels the need to slam this movie would have to go after ""A Hard  Day's Night"" and even Pink Floyd's The Wall as mere ego boosting  movies by bands who couldn't create a ""real movie"".

It tries to make the Spice Girls seem like the coolest and greatest. Kinda pathetic
Also, isn't femenism partly about not being treated like an object. Yet Scary who  claims to be feminist (as well as the other Spice Girls) says something  like ""We think men should be ordered like a pizza"".  That's just  sexist.
