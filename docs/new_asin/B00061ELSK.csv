8036341,5,B00061ELSK,I liked this movie.  Wayne Maunder did a great job as Custer.  I think history put Custer in a bad light.  Oh I suppose he was a bit egotistical but lots of men were back then.  He was a soldier following his orders.,1415059200,,216,3.953488372093023
8036342,3,B00061ELSK,"As mentioned above; this is a mediocore film at best.  I liked the one about the Famous Tecumsa.  They a much BETTER job that this. WHOEVER, If you are a master historian like myself; by all means get this.",1236038400,,206,4.256410256410256
8036343,4,B00061ELSK,"A decent Western, Crazy Horse and Custer, brings to the screen the story of the well known Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer, one of the most controversial American historical figures of all time.  Hero or Villain?  Well that's easy; neither and both, since one's hero is another's villain, case closed. And speaking of, this is a pro-Custer approach.

The cast carry out their performances well enough, (though ""Late Sixties"" is written all over it...) the only exception being the general who is not that convincing in his role.

The dialogues could have been better too.

Nevertheless, the plot, the setting, the battles and the costumes are all above average.

Overall, though not a masterpiece, it is definitely a movie worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment!

For wonderful Westerns I would strongly recommend The Outlaw Josey Wales, Major Dundee and The Undefeated.",1143849600,,905,5.157534246575342
