5708155,2,B00C9LNTBK,What a terrible movie. Items added to the movie that had no meaning and never brought up again.  Not well written at all.,1476144000,,121,4.260869565217392
5708156,1,B00C9LNTBK,"Unfortunately, this was poorly written with completely unbelievable dialogue and sub-par acting skills in the actors. One friend was stumbling, slurring drunk after drinking a half cup of beer for crying out loud, and this same actor seemed to be trying to act like Jack Black... you know, his lovable, silly roles. But this actor was simply not good enough to pull that off, and this viewer did not find ""imitation is the greatest form of flattery"" (Oscar Wilde) to be true in this case. The sound effects were marvelous when first used in the 1953 version of Edgar Allan Poe's ""The Tell-Tale Heart"" because they were original and allowed a viewer to hear what the narrator was hearing and feel his terror. However, in this 2013 movie, those same sounds were simply bad; a cheap, over-used - in this movie - technique to stimulate and manipulate the viewers. Yet, the cinematography was decent, so that is a plus.

The point of view of the movie switched somewhere, as well. Aubrey, portrayed by the deplorable Jesse Draper, arrives home to catch fiance Nathan, portrayed by the wooden Ben Bledsoe, cheating on her. She has a loaded rifle that Nathan slaps away - but not before a silent shot is let loose, apparently killing Elle, adequately portrayed by Kelly Curran. Nathan tells Aubrey they must get rid of the body, to save her, instead of phoning the authorities for help. Yet, by movie end, Aubrey is suddenly the poor, abused, defenseless girlfriend that was bullied into helping her murderous boyfriend - so she must now shoot him before he actually kills Elle, and make him pay for all the damage he has done. Say, what? Aubrey is the one that shot Elle! And do they even make silencers for old rifles?!? Oh wait, the sound effect department was busy muting hammering sounds to drive viewers insane, instead of adding the sound of gunfire.

The blurb one reads on the back of a DVD case or the description listed next to this movie, was far more interesting than the actual film. This film isn't worth a rainy Sunday afternoon viewing, or even for a laugh. This viewer does not recommend this film. It was awful.",1476057600,3,2123,4.689008042895442

5708194,3,B00C9LNTBK,"This film seems like a homage to a Alfred Hitchcock film titled ""Rope"" though with a enough differences to make the film watchable and not just another knock off. What made this movie enjoyable was the fact you could see the story on the news or 60 Minutes as the film did not demand too much suspension of disbelief on the part of the viewer. I thought the camera work was good for a Indy as well as the performances from both leads, and a lot better than most true independent features films.

I'd like to know however, how the hell did the girl escape from under the floorboards without anyone noticing ? I mean there were people present at the party in the living room at all times. I don't understand why Ben continued to want to kill the girl when she was clearly alive and not call 911. It would have been worse for him if he had murdered her . Another big mistake in covering up the crime was not turning the ringer off the cell phone or destroying it completely. The excuses for her absence were stupid and unbelievable.

I had to leave where i was able to come back to it and it still wasn't that bad, for i was able to continue to keep up with it as i was now putting away my groceries and such. So it got 3 stars for keeping me interested while i also got a few things done around my home today too, okay??

5708218,1,B00C9LNTBK,"In the immortal words of Charles Barkley, this movie is ""turrible, just turrible.""

The plot is nonsensical, the writing is beyond sub-par (I've read freshman short stories that are better written than this sad attempt), the dialogue makes you want to stick an ice pick through your eardrum, and it's made even worse (yes, it's possible) by some of the worst actors I've ever had the displeasure of watching. Just count, within the first 10 mins, how many times the name Aubrey is used. Have you ever talked with someone who kept calling you by your name in every sentence? Of course you haven't because that would be stupid and real people don't have to keep reminding you of your name every second they speak with you. (If you are a gamer just imagine the ""Jason"" scene from the beginning of Heavy Rain except replace the name Jason with Aubrey and then just play it on a loop and you essentially have the first few minutes of this film. You're welcome).

That was intentional, I'm sure, to set him up as a sympathetic hero of sorts. But the hodgepodge of rmiscreants is part of what worked for me. The movie kicks off well. I liked the beginning set up. Once the party gets rolling, its like a comedy of errors. How bad those two are at pulling off a crime!!! It was entertaining to see the scramble and try to clean up their blunders. And it was fun to guess at who would crack first and when. The ending kind of disappointed me, not in the sense of how it was executed but how the story wound up resolved. I would've preferred it to go in a different direction. But hey- that's OK. Its just a flick.

5708222,1,B00C9LNTBK,"This film might have had a good plot if just a little attention was paid to details that were contradictory within the plot, script, set and filming.  For example:  At the beginning of a party that was filmed in the bright afternoon sun reference was made to the behavior of one of the attendees during the party as lasting all night.  Later, when it was still bright outside one of the attendees said it was getting late.  One character leaves the party room during the sunlight and returns several minutes later when it all of a sudden is very dark outside. There is a gunshot at one point within a room that cannot be heard.  I cannot give away a number of the other contradictions without disclosing the plot.

Other than the problems with the plot, script etc., the acting was of junior high school quality.  I might not have been as annoyed with this film had the morally compromised main characters been somewhat convincing, but their ability to portray of emotion was laughable.

I also suspect that the Amazon ratings were favorable influence by 5 star reviews from reviewers that had never reviewed any film or products.  I should have checked.  Do not spend time on this film unless you have some perverse need to be annoyed.",1399161600,11,1236,4.628440366972477

5708229,2,B00C9LNTBK,"This plot read well on the DVD cover and it had many intriguing possibilities; however, I simply could not get past the sub-par acting by a majority of the actors, especially Jesse Draper, who played one of the two main characters (and who was also the executive producer).  Since she was in almost every scene of the movie, it was very hard to get past her bad acting and enjoy the plot.

I suppose Jesse Draper, the executive producer, really wanted to play the main role of Aubrey herself; however, Kelly Curran, who played Elle, the ""dead"" girlfriend, would have been a MUCH BETTER Aubrey, as she seemed to have the most genuine acting ability of all of the actors, and, unfortunately, she was ""killed off"" immediately.  I understand that having a small budget limits many of the casting decisions, but, making that one, small change and having Curran play Aubrey, instead of Draper, would have made the movie much more bearable (Ben Bledsoe, who played the other main character, was no pleasure to watch, either, in the believability category, but, he had a bit more acting ability than Draper).

As mentioned above, the plot had a lot of potential and the cinematography was fine; the overall skills of the actors were just too mediocre to get past to enjoy the plot.

Every casting decision affects the overall effectiveness and believability of a film and, although this film truly had some real potential, the casting decisions and the acting really brought the film down.  The film was supposed to be a suspense thriller, but, I kept finding myself chuckling at the bad acting or shaking my head in frustration over the lack of acting ability, instead of ""sitting on the edge of my seat"", as a previous poster stated.

I really expected a true suspense thriller, but all I got was a potentially suspenseful plot that was bogged down by poor acting.",1373846400,7,1858,4.751552795031056

and ""Aubrey"" was pronounced 12 times in less than 2 min.  I'm serious.

Also, the shooting actually had a surreal quality about it.  Because there was no gun noise.  Literally.  Not even the noise the best silencer on earth would make.  I'm talking zero decibels.  Had another reviewer not mentioned it, I would have been WAY confused, because the two are tussling over the gun, and suddenly they just kind of stop and you're wondering why.  Then he suddenly flounces onto the bed cussing, and you're wondering why.  Then they start to look around blankly--are they confused? tired? trying to remember their lines?  Then blonde chick sits on the floor and you're wondering why.  Then the guy proclaims that the blonde chick has been shot, and you're . . .--wait! . . .Huh?
OK.  Well.  We'll just have to take your word for it, since we heard no shot & we see no blood, and I'm
wondering . . . .
Come to think of it, I'm still wondering how Aubrey made it home so fast when she just told her husband 3 min. ago that she would be home in an hour.  What? did she hack the software and ramp the Tesla up to 500mph on that last stretch?

This is so bad.  I mean really, really bad.  The acting! the writing! the situation! the acting! the dialogue! the acting! ---beyond-belief bad when thrown at you all at once (or even separately).  Amazingly, the cinematography isn't too shabby.
Right now I'm rather hypnotized by the wretchedness of the guy's acting . . . . I can't look away . . . .
""Cuddlekins"" . . !?  Did he just call her ""Cuddlekins""?  Wait, I'm going to vomit . . . .

Film continues through lamest party in the history of the universe.  Then a flurry of unexciting activity takes us to the grand finale.  And, another silent gunshot.
