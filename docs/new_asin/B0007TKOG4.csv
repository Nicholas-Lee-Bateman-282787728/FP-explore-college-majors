2241752,4,B0007TKOG4,"This movie proves that these days they are making a goodly percentage of movies for TV that are better than what you see in the theater. After gasping in dismay at some of the junk Hollywood vomits into the theaters, I rented this movie at Blockbuster and it was an entertaining 2 hours. My God; a story told clearly and in a consistent way!!!! I promptly purchased it.

The movie is stolen by actor Riley Smith, a teenage kid who has lost his father to urban violence and is forced to move away from the big city to a more rural area with his mother. Smith is really believable and touching in the role; an actor who is leagues better than the majority of Hollywood teen heart throbs. He makes you feel his pain and his desire in this movie. He is surrounded by a good cast; a good script, and very straight forward direction.

By the way, if you think this is just another animal ""slasher"" flick, you're wrong. The DVD cover suggests this, but it is very misleading. The bear and her cubs are not villains in this movie which explores and glorifies humane treatment of animals.",1265414400,10,1079,4.417085427135678
