7991432,1,B00009MEFQ,"Having read the good reviews, I bought this for my 10 yr old son & my 8 yr old nephew for Christmas.  Sat down w/ my son and watched it.  I became skeptical when the cartoon intro had a guy flipping the bird.  One scene, the background wall has the ""F"" word, and kick ""A..""  Then an interview with a 13yr old skateboarder saying ""sucks"".  The last straw was another person coming up to the camera and ""flipping"" it off.  We shut it off after about 10 minutes.  My son and I both agreed to send it back.",1104710400,2,502,4.061224489795919
