4261449,5,B0044PGU24,"You don't ""require"" me to review ANYTHING. PERIOD!!!  I would have gladly done so for the Inspector Morse Sets, but VOLUNTARILY, not REQUIRED.",1354147200,,142,5.173913043478261
4261450,5,B0044PGU24,"I came to the Inspector Morse series by way of Inspector Lewis, and discovered that Kevin Whately (who is amazing as DI Lewis) also used to play DS Lewis in Inspector Morse. He is one of my favorite actors, and of course, John Thaw is one of my all-time favorite actors in investigative dramas. Thaw's Morse is compelling to watch - he loves listening to operatic music, enjoys his quality pint of ale, is easily smitten by a pretty face and intelligence, and is meticulous and astute in his deductive reasoning. All in all, Morse exemplifies the consummate detective, and most of the Morse episodes are of superior quality in terms of writing and acting.

Set 10 contains three episodes:

Twilight of the Gods
The episode begins with Morse watching an opera performance by mezzo soprano Gwladys Probert (convincingly portrayed by Sheila Gish). Morse is so overcome by emotion that he is compelled to shout out, ""Bravo!"" Next, we see a middle-aged woman coming upon a murdered man, the victim being a freelance journalist. The journalist had been working on a piece on college benefactor Andrew Baydon. After Morse witnesses his beloved soprano (he develops quite an infatuation) getting shot by a sniper while she stands next to Baydon at the annual procession, he comes to suspect that the two cases might be linked.

This episode is notable for having some famous names in it such as Sir John Gielgud who plays the Chancellor of Oxford, Robert Hardy as college benefactor Andrew Baydon, and a very young Rachel Weisz as Arabella Baydon.

The Way Through the Woods
""Through the Woods"" is a stellar episode featuring impeccable casting and writing. John Thaw as Chief Inspector Morse is a consummate detective who works tirelessly to get at the truth. In this episode, a man convicted as the Lovers Lane Killer, is killed in a prison fight. Although five victims were attributed to this killer whose name is Parnell, the fifth victim, Karen Anderson's body has never been found. Morse's rival and antagonist DI Johnson believes that Karen's body is at the bottom of the lake at Blenheim, but Morse is adamant in that not only is the body not at the bottom of the lake, it is buried somewhere in Wytham Woods. Morse also believes that Parnell is not Karen's killer.

Meanwhile DS Lewis (Kevin Whately) struggles between his loyalty to DCI Morse and a possible promotion if he leaves Morse and joins Johnson at regional headquarters. Lewis feels that Morse takes him for granted, feelings which are only exacerbated by Johnson's constant needling.

The plot is tightly-knit, and there are plenty of red herrings scattered throughout the story. As the story progresses, one suspect after another crops up and is just as easily eliminated, leaving the viewer puzzling out the identity of the elusive killer. When the killer is finally unmasked thanks to Morse's unflagging persistence, it comes as quite a surprise, making this a truly riveting detective drama.

The Daughters of Cain
Chief Inspector Morse (John Thaw) and DS Lewis (Kevin Whately) find themselves a bit out of their depth when confronted by the murder of an academic. Their investigations gradually reveal several interesting details - the politics of university fundraising, the underground drug scene at the college, and the possible involvement of three women working together in the death of another person.

Morse meanwhile, finds himself charmed by one of the female suspects, an attractive and confident younger woman who is clearly involved in some way, but Morse and Lewis find it difficult to prove her involvement. I liked the intricacies of the plot and the surprise element in this case. Unlike most of the cases Morse and Lewis work on, this is one case where some of the perpetrators walk free!",1351728000,3,3773,4.949447077409163
4261451,5,B0044PGU24,"This is Set Ten of eleven ""Inspector Morse"" Sets. Each Set has three episodes/discs. Don't confuse these eleven ""Sets"" with the previously issued (but still available) ""Collection Sets"". Each of the six ""Collection Sets"" cost more, as each has more episodes/discs than these Sets.

Set Ten has three episodes. The first episode originally aired as the last episode in the ITV Series 7. (The ITV used ""series"" instead of ""seasons"".) The last two episodes in this DVD Set Ten aired in the same order, as the first two, of five total, ""Inspector Morse"" Annual Specials.
Episodes:
Twilight of the Gods - originally aired January 1993
The Way Through the Woods - aired November 1995
The Daughters of Cain - aired November 1996

TWILIGHT OF THE GODS:
Andrew Baydon, successful entrepreneur, wants to donate a huge new building to the college. He's receiving an honorary degree, but he's not in a good mood. He's furious over some uncomplimentary newspaper stories and he expects someone at the end of a phone call to do something about it.

The second story thread starts with Morse attending a special class at the Sheldonian Theatre, given by Gwladys Probert, the Welsh Canary. He is enthralled by her demonstrations of opera singing and expression. He looks forward even more to her concert that night. In the meanwhile, a dogwalker finds a young Neville Grimshaw with a bullet hole through his forehead. Lewis is taking notes at the scene, but Morse hasn't arrived yet.

That's because he's at the florist, ordering two dozen long stemmed roses to be sent to the diva before her concert. The card with the flowers reads, ""To the greatest diva of her time, with grateful thanks from an admirer."" And ""diva"" is right. At the time, Gladys is in her dressing room screaming at her sister, Mari, who is supposed to be grateful to her, but doesn't look it.

It turns out Grimshaw was a journalist, but Morse can't get excited about the case as it's interfering with his operatic reverie. His peace is shattered, however, when Gwladys Probert is shot in a college square in a group of college dons and Andrew Baydon. ""Why her?"" Morse asks rhetorically. ""What harm does a beautiful voice to do anyone?""

Trivia: This episode was written by Julian Mitchell, based on the characters created by Colin Dexter. Dexter's walk-on is where he is sitting behind Lord Hinksey at the diva's class. Lord Hinksey, the politically incorrrect college Chancellor, is played with daffiness by Sir John Gielgud, 89 at the time.

Gwladys Probert is played by Sheila Gish. Her singing is dubbed by Susan McCulloch

THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS:
Three things are happening at once. 1. Morse is in black tie at an outdoor string quartet concert and meets a new seemingly eligible woman.
2. Steven Parnell is cleaning the bathroom at his prison, when he's attacked by three other inmates. The guards and the chaplain rush to him, and he whispers something just before he dies.
3. A man is walking his dog in the woods, and the dog digs up a human skull. However, it rolls down the hill, and the man never sees it.

Morse and Chief Superintendent Strange are talking about Parnell. They got Parnell's confession to five killings, but Morse was never happy with that. Karen Anderson, the 5th victim, was different from the others, and they've never found her body. Plus, Parnell confessed after a grueling interview with DCI John Johnson. According to Morse, ""Given John's interview technique, I'm surprised he didn't confess to the A6, the Julia Wallace and the Whitechapel Murders.""

Strange is adamant, ""I don't want you outside the tent on this, Morse. Understand?""  What chance is there that that warning will take hold, even when Morse is on leave.

Lewis and the aforementioned DCI Johnson go to the prison and talk to the chaplain. He tells them about Parnell's final whisper, "" 'Not the girl... not the last.'  Those were his words. I took from that that he'd meant four, he killed four, the two couples.""  Don't you love it when Morse is right?

But to keep Morse from getting too big-headed about it, he and Lewis, after Johnson's prodding, have a terrible name-calling row. It's good, though, because in the following rapport, they have greater appreciation of each other.

Trivia: This special was written by Russell Lewis, based on the book of the same name by Colin Dexter. It was his 10th Inspector Morse novel, published in 1993. Dexter's walk-on occurs where he's a fellow attendee at the opening concert attended by Morse.

Morse mentions three famous murders. The Whitechapel Murders, of course, refer to Jack the Ripper.  In 1931, William Wallace was convicted of murdering his wife Julia. His conviction was overturned on a re-examination of the evidence, the first time in British legal history. It is still discussed today, the way in the U.S. we wonder whether Richard Kimble or the one-armed man killed Helen Kimble. The A6 Murders happened in 1962. James Hanratty was hanged for shooting and raping a couple on an A6 lay-by. This was very controversial; people argued that Hanratty had no previous history of violence, and the court did not allow evidence of his mental history and prognosis of ""mental deficiency"". Books were written about it and the did-he-or-didn't-he controversy lasted until 2000 (five years after this episode aired), when DNA analysis confirmed Hanratty's involvement.

DAUGHTERS OF CAIN:
Morse starts out with a funny bit. He has just poured himself a drink and settled in his chair, when he gets a phone call. He's furious, ""Are you telling me that the college is so broke that it is getting its undergraduates to ring up old members using their Christian names? Because if Lonsdale is reduced to selling itself like double-glazing, Good Night!""

Well, that is what the college is saying. And in the meanwhile, Wolsey College is having a black tie dinner, where Dr. Felix McClure guides a man and his checkbook to sit next to the college president. That's Felix's specialty. He's been called back from retirement to be in charge of fundraising. And the next day he's found dead in his college room. Morse asks the new pathologist, Dr. Laura Hobson, ""Anything I need to know?""  And she replies exactly what I'd been thinking myself, ""Time you had a haircut.""

In a second story string, we see high school teacher Julia Stevens mutually commiserating with her housekeeper, Brenda Brooks.  Julia has just discovered she has an inoperable brain tumor, and Brenda is getting beat about by her choleric husband, Ted.

What do Felix's death, Julia and Brenda's plans, Ted Brook's vile personality and the suicide of student Matthew Rodway have in common?

Trivia: This special was written by Julian Mitchell, based on the novel of the same name by Colin Dexter. The novel was his 11th Inspector Morse mystery, originally published in 1995. Dexter's walk-on finally has a name!  He's Mr. Humphries, a man with crutches in the hospital waiting room.

Wolsey College, where Felix does his fundraising, is a made-up Oxford college name, as are all the Oxford college names in Dexter's books and the ""Inspector Morse"" TV show. Lonsdale, Morse's made-up Oxford alma mater, is not to be confused with the very real Lonsdale College, part of the University of Lancaster, UK.

The Pit-River Museum, where Ted Brooks works, is a real museum. The knife stolen by student Kevin Costyn is a real knife in its collection, a Barotse Tribal Ceremonial Knife from Zambia.

It is always lovely to see Phyllis Logan, who plays Julia Stevens. I am particularly fond of her in the mystery/comedies&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lovejoy-The-Complete-Collection/dp/B002DY9KRA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lovejoy: The Complete Collection</a>.

4261452,5,B0044PGU24,"After immensely enjoying the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Complete-Inspector-Lewis/dp/B0056031NW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Complete Inspector Lewis</a>, you may want to explore the beginning, with Inspector Morse. Apparently, a complete boxed collection of Morse had poor quality transfers and sound, and missing footage. This recent release of DVDs precludes that, though you have to slog through purchasing Sets 1 thru 11 separately. Even so, the complete price is less for these more recent, upgraded disks, even though you don't get the wooden box featured in the complete collection.

The first story in this 3-Disk collection is the weakest, though opera fans may rejoice.  ""Twilight of the Gods"" stumbles with a miscasting of the superlative Robert Hardy (Harry Potter, All Creatures Great and Small, etc.). A very young Rachel Weisz is excellent, given the small amount of material she has to work with. Issues of class and culture are dealt with, though ultimately, talent should out, whatever pedestal the diva may have been placed upon.

The second story, ""The Way Through the Woods,"" introduces the wonderful Clare Holman as Dr. Hobson, an excellent character featured in many later mysteries of  ""Lewis."" Neil Dudgeon, of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mrs-Bradley-Mysteries-Speedy-Death-The-Mrs-Bradley-Mysteries/dp/B0002XVRXE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mrs. Bradley Mysteries (Speedy Death, The Mrs. Bradley Mysteries)</a>&nbsp;is great, as usual. A killer confesses to his priest right before dying, throwing several just solved cases out of wack. Inspector Lewis confronts bureaucratic obstinacy and pressure from his peers, who resent his re-opening ""their"" neatly tied-up case. This episode tells you much about Lewis' relationship with other ""coppers,"" and most importantly, the issues of loyalty and respect between himself and Sergeant Lewis. This one will keep you guessing, part of the fun!

The third episode explores spouse abuse, one is quite sympathetic to the victims and their solution. The schoolteacher is brilliant, as is her cake-baking, long-suffering assistant, and Amanda Ryan, as the daughter of a harrowing domestic drama, is excellent; a strong, ruthless survivor.

One can see why John Thaw, as the thoughtful Inspector Morse, has such a loyal following, as does the fine Kevin Whately as Sargeant Lewis.

I wouldn't object to the series being technologically dated, not to mention the hairstyles, but the way a gay man's character was written and acted was so wildly off, and so stereotypically insulting, that I gave it up.  I happen to be a 50-something straight woman, so no personal axe to grind here.  I just know lots of real people who are gay, and I couldn't watch the foolish characterization on Morse.  The reason I didn't go on to watch further episodes is that I felt the tone was set:  so out of it.  I do recommend:  Sherlock (absolutely compelling actors, and super direction and editing). Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries (deliciously stylish and witty, with the proverbial heart of gold), The Hour (very complex and demanding, well worth your effort), in addition to those mentioned above.

The Way Through the Woods stars Neil Dudgeon, who now appears in the new Inspector Barnaby series, and who always is a great addition to a good mystery as this.  But the best one is The Daughters of Cain with Phyllis Logan as one of the stars.  She starred in the Lovejoy Series as Lady Jane with Ian McShane and is excellent in this character which is the direct opposite of Lady Jane.
