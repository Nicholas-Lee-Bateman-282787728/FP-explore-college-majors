4533770,5,B00535QKPG,"Challenge of the Gobots is a wonderful sight.  A comeback for a cartoon I loved and grew up to during my childhood.  The DVD features the pilot miniseries about giant warring robots from another world that come to Earth (sounds familiar?).  The only difference to the Gobots and Transformers is the storyline.  The Antagonist Gobots, the Renegades, come to Earth too enslave the entire population and build an armada of war machines called ""ZODS"".  It is up to the Protagonists, The Guardians, to stop the Renegades from launching the Zods against their home world and free the people of Earth.

If you grew up to the Transformers then you will enjoy the Challenge of the Gobots and the characters in the story.  Characters like Crasher, the crazy Renegade racer who can summon a living lightning bolt by stomping her foot on the ground.  And Leader One, the commander of the Guardians and skilled air fighter, who sacrifices himself to save his comrades and uses his head to save both worlds at once.

If you enjoy classic cartoons from the 80s, Get this DVD.  If you love Giant Robots that transform and have robot wars, Get this DVD.

Now the Gobots actaully continued beyond the miniseries into a TV show for about 2 seasons.  This mini series is a great start for the show and hopefully will encourage the release of the entire show.",1316304000,11,1338,4.695278969957082
4533771,5,B00535QKPG,"Transformers beware , because your old rival show ( Challange Of The Gobots ) is making a comeback . Now , if someone could just make a 4 film favorites collection involving their miniseries , their 5 part episode , Battle Of The Rocklords and perhaps a Robot Chicken short of the gobots with all of it's bonus features ; I wouldn't have to buy the entire series whenever the other volumes come out . Then again , it was one of my favorite cartoons from my youth , so maybe I  will buy the whole series . Transformers or Gobots , you decide who is .................. The DEADLEST WARRIOR !!! (not a big surprise who).",1313107200,,617,4.318965517241379
4533772,5,B00535QKPG,"I have been waiting for them to come out with this show on dvd for a long time. I am really happy that when this came out. The only thing I notice is that it was put on DVD-R or DVD-R+. However the quality was good and remastered.

I hope that the rest of the Challenge of the Gobots including the movie The Rock Lord will come out on DVD, remastered, and in a complete set.

When Challenge of the Gobots and the Transformers came out together in the 1980's, I was hoping they would do some kind of combine series together for a one week series.",1313107200,,545,4.08411214953271
4533773,5,B00535QKPG,"Often forgotten in light of the huge success of the Transformers, the GoBots enjoyed some success of their own back in the 80's. It will be great to see Leader-1, Cy-Kill, Turbo, Zod etc. again. Hopefully, they will release the entire series next. Bringing back at least some of the toys would be cool, too. Kids from that time period are now adults that have kids that they would love to share the things they enjoyed with. I also hope we can get an American release of Tranzor Z.",1308268800,5,481,4.415730337078652
4533774,4,B00535QKPG,"I have been waiting for them to come out with this show on dvd for a long time. I wish they would bring back the toys but i guess not. I cant wait for this to come out. To me the 80's were Transformers, Voltron, Thundercats, Gobots, GIJOe and more. Well i am really not so happy that when this came out that it was not ready when they said it was ready. So If you can find it on another site do it other wise you might be waiting a long time.
Soon no one will be shopping at the stores but on the websites but if you cant find it on the sites then where do you turn to go buy the stuff you like.
To me if any site says a certain date it will be out then have the product ready then. Other wise this is a must own dvd.",1308096000,,717,3.6623376623376624

4533784,4,B00535QKPG,"I really enjoyed watching this mini series again! The best thing I liked, is how in each episode, they would introduce a new character (mainly the renegades) and gave it them more life with their own personal involvement with their individual useful abilities.

The only thing I would have liked more, to give it a five star, would be to have a little behind the scenes director's history and some interviews with the voice actors/actresses. If that is not important to you, then I would give it Five stars. The picture quality is clear as if it would be shown as a new cartoon of today,",1434585600,,587,4.537735849056604

4533791,5,B00535QKPG,"Finally! Hanna-Barbarra has released one of their best cartoons in television history! Bit of fun fact, Challenge of the Gobots came out one month before Hasbro's G1 Transformers, but the latter got more recognition. But now, you can relive the first five episodes every Gobot fan calls ""The Battle For Gobotron"". See how the Renegades first come to Earth and the Guardians follow and the latters befriend three humans who help them. A must have if you already have the first volume of Gobots episodes and a great gift for any fan!",1416960000,2,531,4.782608695652174

4533793,3,B00535QKPG,I'm glad I bought this so I could see for myself why it was canceled. Not the Transformers. I liked them when I was little but I was most likely not listening to the dialog. Cheesey,1410825600,,181,4.055555555555555
4533794,5,B00535QKPG,it's been 3 decades since the cartoon was on television I was a very big fan of the series I am happy to say that I am very pleased that it is available to own the mini series tells the story & the origins  about the battle with the guardians led by leader-one  & the renegades led by cy-kill,1409616000,,292,3.9322033898305087
4533795,5,B00535QKPG,"The Challenge of the Go-Bots original mini series is one of those shows that if your into that era of cartoons or the concept of transforming robots you'll like it but more you'll probably love how silly it can get when it's desperately trying to be serious.

The animation is pretty good but many times the robots come off as too human or too simplified in their designs compared to the toys they were based on and other robot series of the day. In some cases like Turbo they just come off as looking creepy or weird as a result.

Basically the show tries to come off as a Transformers alternative but it essentially takes most of its plot and origins directly from that series and sort of does it haphazardly. Like your never really told why the robots are all Earth based vehicles on their home planet of Gobotron they just expect you not to question it.

Just like Transformers there are two warring factions: The heroic Guardians and the evil Renegades. The Renegades eventually escape imprisonment and make their way to Earth followed by the Guardians hoping to protect the planet and its inhabitants from the villains with the help of human allies on each side.

Speaking of the human of the series you can also count on the fact that nearly every time the Go-Bots get around the humans they do things that should kill or injure them but nobody ever gets more than a little shaken up or scared. It's especially funny how many times the Guardians, the heroes of the series, do this.

If your looking for an alternative to Transformers that is more kid friendly or just a fan of the transforming robot genre  I highly recommend this series.",1407628800,,1645,4.559322033898305
4533796,4,B00535QKPG,"I was surprised by how good the quality was on this, it basically looks HD to me (but I'm no expert). I was expecting a video from the 80s to be grainy and whatnot, but it was great! This DVD needs more episodes, I feel a little cheated there, but I guess for the price, what was I expecting. If you liked this series back in the day, it's worth it.",1407456000,,349,3.9295774647887325
4533797,4,B00535QKPG,The Go-Bots are enjoyable. This is the original mini series only. Both this and the actual series are a bit overpriced.,1405728000,,119,4.714285714285714
4533798,5,B00535QKPG,This is an excellent classic cartoon series. You will enjoy watching this and can share this with your family. It is a very family friendly show.

So if its been nearly 3 years and Hana Barbara studios still haven't released the rest of the series and the movie on dvd yet , than they never will ; its like Shout Factory with volume 2 of both vr troopers season 2 and beetleborgs season 2 all over again .

4533803,4,B00535QKPG,The GoBots get a bad rap for being Transformers ripoffs which quite frankly they deserve but this cartoon series was pretty good. It was actually one of the more sophisticated cartoon series Hanna Barbera put out compared to some of their more badly written shows like the SuperFriends & Scooby Doo and stuff like that. The animation is colorful & clear and the story isn't bad either. It's also extremely rare so I say go ahead and get it.,1384128000,,440,4.582278481012659

4533812,1,B00535QKPG,"I got a DVD-R with a tiny scratch. I played it and it looks great, I won't deny that, but this is a DVD-R, and I'm very disappointed.
I give it a star only because I'm a fan of the Gobots, but this release deserves no stars.",1324944000,3,224,3.7872340425531914
4533813,5,B00535QKPG,"GoBots is a must have for anyone who likes Robots along the lines of the Transformers, but here presented in a slightly clumsy but very likeable way. This series is a Hanna Barbera Production and has all of the familiar sound FX, style, and music of many of their classic productions.
Here we have the powerful villain Cy-Kill, a motorcycle/robot hybrid from the planet Gobotron who's sole purpose is to take over the earth and destroy Leader 1, a fighter Jet/robot who does his best to help humanity.

This set includes the introduction to the Gobot world Gobotron, and the Gobots first encounters with humans. Scooter, a red scooter/robot hybrid is strongly showcased here, and the show includes the voice of Frank Welker.

The action is plentiful here, and the story line very interesting. You'll also see plenty of the star robots and their interactions with the human scientists and the evil scientist cohort of Cy-Kill. It's a joy to watch this classic show once again, as these skilled but somewhat clumsy robots engage in an unending battle of wits and laser fire. Highly recommended for Robot fans looking for a very unique animated show about robots.

Storylines: 8/10
Robot Selection: 8/10 Many classic robots are here
Music: 8/10
Sound FX: 9/10
Action: 8/10
Fun to watch: 8/10
Overall: 8/10.

If you want the entire series on DVD, put forth a purchase of this classic robotic series now, so the series has enough sales to warrant more videos.

On a side note, when is the Hanna Barbera Pac Man Cartoon series going to hit DVD? It's digitially available, but not on DVD yet. UPDATE: Pac Man now on DVD. Thanks Hanna Barbera for releasing it. Now we just need the full GoBots series please.",1322697600,4,1700,4.7687074829931975
4533814,4,B00535QKPG,One of my favorite cartoons of the 1980s next to The Transformers.  They didn't have armies like the Autobots and Decepticons did on Earth.  They had 3 Guardians and 3 Renegades.  Simple.  The Gobots came from Gobotron.  I only wish that more of this series was on DVD.,1322438400,,269,4.520833333333333

The story kept me interested and the quality was very good. I am anxious now for the full series to come out on DVD as watching this made me want to see more episodes. I found myself enjoying the Crasher character the most. I would recommend this to anyone as I very much enjoyed it.

8454997,5,B00535QKPG,This cartoon original Miniseries was the/is the Best gobot excitement ever. The music is dramatic and there is more action than even the newer series. The story is just as good as the later ones. Hanna Barbera/ now Warner Bros(from what I hear) is excellent!,1505174400,,258,4.7555555555555555
8454998,3,B00535QKPG,"There are a few odd editing choices made to the episodes on this DVD.  The ending credits are missing the classic swirling Hanna-Barbera logo they used in the 80's that were at the end of the syndicated version when the show originally aired.  Episode 2 is missing all audio from the commercial bumpers.  No music and no voice of Dick Tufeld saying the show would continue after these messages/back to the show.

As for the content, the original miniseries of the Gobots was okay.  It was a decent enough introduction to the series.  The show definitely got better when the show proper started airing about a year after this miniseries did.

Why do the producers of DVD material insist on making stupid edits?  Wouldn't it be far easier to just take the original source material and convert rather than take the time to make stupid editing choices that the viewer didn't want?",1501113600,3,876,4.717105263157895
