1905516,5,B0000AGQ5Y,When Will They release all the seasons? I used to watch this and power rangers when I was little I really wish they would release some complete seasons of both shows.,1177286400,9,166,4.387096774193548
1905517,4,B0000AGQ5Y,The Spiderman collection served its purpose as my son was very happy to watch and pretend he is spiderman and/or his enemies.  The Spiderman collection should involve every Spiderman DVD from that series as it is somewhat confusing when ordering and not knowing which DVDs actually come in the collection series.  Overall I rate the series w/a passing grade.,1173312000,3,358,5.0508474576271185
1905518,2,B0000AGQ5Y,"this dvds start off fast and exciting the color is good but the story lines seem to run together and before you know it the dvd is ending such story lines as the green goblin run to long. also where are the orther villians. such as rhino and electro and orther that spiderman fans have come to love this is a quick fix by marvel to give you a small taste only to intice you to by the main disk  67 collerction,",1168300800,2,410,4.0
1905519,4,B0000AGQ5Y,well i can't say that i like this one as much but the boys sure do so we keep this collection of spidey's fox t.v. shows is very grapic but it is still better than the new justice league!! enjoy!,1149033600,,195,3.9
1905520,5,B0000AGQ5Y,This is a must have cause the animation was good for american cartoon's back then the U.S. cartoonist could draw good and make good action cartoons. We need to bring that back. We could be just as good as the japanese anime. The Spider Man series had other marvel characters that made guest appearances on the show even Stan Lee himself made a guest appearance as a cartoon character. Peter was bitten by a radioactive spider then the next day he had super powers he never needed glasses again.,1128643200,5,494,4.561797752808989
1905521,5,B0000AGQ5Y,"This DVD set is a must have for all Spiderman fans.

It is worth the money.",1098144000,5,75,3.6875
1905522,5,B0000AGQ5Y,"This disc set contains ""The Ultimate Villain Showdown"", ""Daredevil vs. Spider-Man"", and ""The Return of the Green Goblin"".
The three discs comprise the entire story titled ""The Sins of the Father"" save for chapter 1 and ends on chapter 1 of ""Partners in Danger."" Each contains four 20 minute episodes and lots of extras including comments from creator Stan Lee himself.
Having always been a big Spidey fan, I absolutely love these stories. You not only get to see lots of web slinging but get to spend just as much time with Peter Parker. One of the things that makes Spider-Man so appealing to me is the fact that he has a life outside the custume and oh brother, can it ever be a mess. The stories and the animation can be a bit fast paced but I believe that it was done well enough that it really helps push the story along and give you a sense of how rapidly things are supposed to be happening and the split-second decisions our hero must make.
These recordings are all quite clear and decently well done. If you like Spidey at all, this series is a must have.",1077321600,70,1064,4.406091370558376

7996964,4,B0000AGQ5Y,"$298 new or $98 used for the three disc packaged set? They're not limited or rare. You can buy the three discs in this set used for a penny each individually. Seriously a penny! Why venders go through the trouble to list items for a penny, I have no idea. Hardly seems worth the effort.",1368057600,4,286,4.218181818181818
7996965,2,B0000AGQ5Y,"Why this is relase in Europe,10 disc 1310 minutes for 20 pound like 30 dollars and we get 3 disc 200 minutes and 100 to 300 hundred dollas for a porcion of this season this is bs",1351555200,9,178,3.8378378378378377
7996966,1,B0000AGQ5Y,I wish Marvel would release all the season of Spider-man of the FOX 1994 and when the series ended and i want to see where it started and ended and they have all the series and i would buy it.,1284854400,,192,3.825
7996967,5,B0000AGQ5Y,"251 Dollars for this? We need Full Season Box sets of this show. But the folks at Buena Vista Home Entertainment refuse to do us fans a favor and release it properly. I wish I knew why thy refuse us fans what they could easily give us. Im not alone in this, there are many fans who would happily pay top dollar for these shows, and they are all just as tired as I am of these piss poor releases. Amazon, please save this show, and X-Men while your at it. Try to make a deal With Buena Vista to release this, it would be foolish not to, you would make alot of money, I promise.",1222819200,48,576,3.9741379310344827
7996968,5,B0000AGQ5Y,"I just don't get it....when you hit the toy store these days you see Spiderman figures everywhere but then there is no good cartoon on DVD to show your kid except the few 1981 videos that are a part of this set.  I tried the 2003 Spiderman ""the new animated series"" and he did not like it at all as it does not have Venom, Carnage, or Doc Ock (all the main villians that are sold at toy stores).  Once I bought all the individual videos separately (that are a part of this set I assume) he was as happy as could be.

Whoever has the rights to Spiderman (heard it's Disney)needs to release all the older (1980's) cartoons on DVD....they will make a fortune as the story line is good, the villians are neat, and Peter Parker is a very likeable guy.",1205107200,,746,4.2027972027972025
7996969,4,B0000AGQ5Y,"After finding Vol I in the Walmart discount bin, I was excited to view the rest, I never saw thus series on TV. But When I went for the  on-line search I found that the Volumes did not list the episodes. Not wanting to re-buy what I had, I looked deeper. And as I thought there is a flaw to the series( Not being able to get them all in one series). The show is very good, really beyond comparison to current American animation. But I will take Dart Kommisar's suggestion and wait for the full season series or hope to stumble across them individually in the discount bin. I was about to order them individually on Amazon through the ""used"" section but decided to skip the hassle and added shipping cost. Walmart might have the other volumes, so I will check there first. In review, Great show, great animation, lousy marketing. My suggestion, let's all express our feeling to the company. WHO'S IN?",1182729600,,899,4.4817073170731705
7996970,4,B0000AGQ5Y,While I believe the cartoon itself deserves 5+ stars this set is only getting 4.  For one reason alone.  They need to start releasing the season box sets.  Come On!!,1179187200,17,165,4.433333333333334
