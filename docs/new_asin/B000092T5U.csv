2792943,1,B000092T5U,"A perfectly good waste of film.  But, then again, it may have been shot with a GoPro.  The acting was absolutely among the worst I've ever seen.  Couldn't take more the 15 minutes of this 'film'.  If the total budget for Drug Lordz exceeded $1K, it went well over budget.  The trailer to this 'film' is all you need to watch to see what a complete waste it is.",1480032000,2,360,4.159420289855072

2792948,1,B000092T5U,just plain bad--nothing much more to say other than I had to turn it off after 20 minutes. Paying $1.99 for it didn't make it any better..,1434412800,,138,4.148148148148148
2792949,3,B000092T5U,"I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area so I watch pretty much any movie, drama series, etc., centered on the Bay Area. This movie actually doesn't show much of the Bay that you could identify with. I understand that this is a low budget film but the acting could have been a little better. The plot was ok but you could figure it out midway through the film. I think an above average score of 3 out of 5 stars is appropriate.",1432944000,,422,4.158536585365853

2792952,2,B000092T5U,"Right from the opening scene you can tell this isn't going to be a cerebral stretching movie.  Cheesy acting, cheesy special effects and mediocre dialog are just a few highlights of this film.

This is certainly a first timers movie on many levels.  But what the heck, ya gotta start somewhere.",1482796800,,294,4.7254901960784315
