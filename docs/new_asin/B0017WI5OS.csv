When the local video store closed up I thought it was the end of Jazztime Tale for my students.  I located this DVD on Amazon and am thrilled with this purchase.",1317859200,,320,4.406779661016949

8267675,1,B0017WI5OS,"The DVD story had nothing to do with a pig...I don't know what the story was supposed to be about, but it wasn't a pig. And the narrator didn't know how to pronounce ""marzipan"".  I called and requested credit for the purchase (since it was apparently not worth the expense of returning).",1449705600,,287,4.519230769230769

8267681,5,B0017WI5OS,"I saw this on television when I was 5 years old. At the time I found it very peaceful and calming. My thoughts have returned to it here and there in the years since, until I finally went and bought it again. The narrative is gorgeous, as is the animation. The story is of a marzipan pig who falls out of sight and longs to be found; a mouse eventually discovers him but hungrily eats him. However, the spirit of the marzipan pig still influences all those who come into contact with the mouse, spreading love to the most unexpected places.

According to another reviewer, their daughter had nightmares from this. I find that quite amazing, considering how gentle and soothing it is, but all kids are different after all, and the ends of bell curves are far away. If your child is very sensitive and easily upset by the idea of a mouse eating a pig-shaped sweet, don't let them watch this. Otherwise, they will enjoy this absolutely lovely tale. Animation for children is so loud and bombastic these days. It's nice to have something this soft and pleasing to remind us that there is a certain beauty to be found in well-made mildness.",1373760000,2,1134,4.53170731707317
8267682,5,B0017WI5OS,Came across this short on one of the HBO Family channels by sheer random luck.  I've been enamored with the short and narration by Tim Curry ever since.  The style of it combined with Tim Curry's voice talent is very enchanting.  Highly recommend!,1340755200,2,247,4.6976744186046515
8267683,5,B0017WI5OS,"I came across The Marzipan Pig on cable TV years ago. Unfortunately the visual reception was bad--the picture was all zig-zag and I couldn't see a thing. But the narration was SO lovely that I couldn't change the channel.

I've been longing to see it ever since. Now it is on DVD so I got a copy from Amazon to watch with my 10 year-old nephew and 6 year-old niece. I forewarned them it had a couple sad parts but a good ending. They were both A-OK with the whole thing. We were not disappointed--the animation was as charming as the narrative. My niece was captivated by the dancing mouse. And we all enjoyed the poetry and alliteration of the spoken sentiments.

The Marzipan Pig remains a timeless treat. Highly recommended!",1336348800,3,727,4.541984732824427
8267684,1,B0017WI5OS,"I rented this movie from the library last night, based on the description on the cover.  My daughter (almost 4) started crying when the mouse ate the pig, and was bawling by the time the owl ate the mouse; we turned it off.  She woke up screaming in the middle of the night last night, but would not say why.  I should have done my research, had no idea this could be sad for little ones.",1327536000,4,388,4.078947368421052
