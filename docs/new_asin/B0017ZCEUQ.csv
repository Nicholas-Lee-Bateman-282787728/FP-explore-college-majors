8267913,3,B0017ZCEUQ,"I like this dance workout. Some of the changes are too fast for me, but you can modify using her teaching steps. I'd like it better if it was a tad slower and if it had some intervals with weights, like strength training as an option.",1431648000,,234,4.108695652173913
8267914,3,B0017ZCEUQ,I like Pam Cosmi.  There are two routines on this tape ... they're just too easy for me.,1428192000,,88,3.888888888888889
8267915,3,B0017ZCEUQ,"This one was too advanced for us older, couch potato types.  Nice to watch from my recliner!",1420416000,,92,4.411764705882353
8267916,5,B0017ZCEUQ,Fast paced but dance makes it easier to follow.  Would recommend to any one that  wants to move more and lose weight,1366156800,3,116,4.2272727272727275
8267917,3,B0017ZCEUQ,I think I will have to watch the DVD a lot to even get going with the steps. Feels very awkward. I guess I will stick with the older versions of dance cardio I have in VHS. Sign of old age? Possibly.,1363564800,2,199,3.761904761904762
8267918,2,B0017ZCEUQ,"I've been doing dance workouts for years. I'm 65 and fairly fit for my age, and I was bored to tears with this DVD. It's extremely repetitious and not strenuous at all. I returned it immediately.",1352764800,,195,4.444444444444445
8267919,2,B0017ZCEUQ,"This is really not for seniors.  It would be good for someone under 55.  I did not like it, so I do not do the exercises.",1324425600,,121,3.6153846153846154
8267920,5,B0017ZCEUQ,"This is just what I wanted! Moderate cardio with a dancey feel. It was easy to catch onto right away-but not boing. Her moves were seemless and blended for a smooth, gliding cardio routine! Each dance is 15min with the warmup and cooldown You can do both for a 30 min workout. I really liked this one and the time flew. It got my heartrate up, without it getting too high. It was a perfect moderate intensity and easier/moderate choreography level. It fits the bill for me to do before or after a toning workout! Thanks Pam!",1287014400,3,524,4.412371134020619
8267921,5,B0017ZCEUQ,"Nice dance workouts...easy to follow along and she was nice to listen to.  Not super hard but not super easy either, just quick and fun routines.  I can see using this a few times a week when I want to have a little fun and have little time.",1275436800,5,241,4.0
