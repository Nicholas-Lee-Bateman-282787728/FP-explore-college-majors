8423794,3,B004CYF7SU,"I thought that this was an entire episode of the Tonight Show.  It's actually just a few clips.  They edited out huge amounts.  Maybe they showed the best stuff, but I wanted an entire episode, complete interviews, etc.  I wouldn't buy one of these again.",1390348800,,255,4.6
8423795,4,B004CYF7SU,"Johnny Carson was something I grew up with, it's fun reliving some of that time.

I was how I started to enjoy comedians good sense of humor.",1367625600,,141,4.222222222222222

8423797,1,B004CYF7SU,"Although my English is extremely deficient, I will to try a comment.
I am very disappointed! From this DVD  (and with this price)  I had expected more.  It runs just 24 minutes and of these you must to see during the first 13 min this rubbish with Johnny Carson, that, so it seems, especially he himself thought it is comical...  To me it was important to see the talk with John Denver - and this were no more than 5 minutes plus ca 3 min singing.  -  The rest of remaining 4 min of this ""show"" is not noteworthy.",1293753600,8,513,4.1313131313131315
