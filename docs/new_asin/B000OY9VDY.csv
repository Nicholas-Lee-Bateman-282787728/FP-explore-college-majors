2804810,5,B000OY9VDY,My 3 year olds love this video. They watch Mighty Machines as many times as I will let them.,1245974400,,92,3.8947368421052633
2804811,3,B000OY9VDY,"My son received several of these for Christmas this year: Tremendous Tools,  Big Wheels Rollin', Roadways to Runways, Diggers & Dozers, and Lights & Ladders.

While I have learned a lot about all sorts of vehicles, these videos are honestly kind of dull and slow-moving.

For example, in Lights and Ladders, we meet all sorts of city worker vehicles-- like street sweepers and trash trucks.  At once point, we spend several minutes watching the trash ooze from the back of the truck and it deposits it before it gets put into a landfill.  It is very dull-- in fact my son will spend about 15 minutes watching then run off.  Mind you, this is a 90 minute video!

I was hoping these were the ones that sneak letters, numbers and shapes into the program, like veggies in a casserole, but they are not.",1231200000,,798,4.538461538461538
2804812,5,B000OY9VDY,My almost 4 year old loves this dvd.  We have had it for a couple of months now and he can watch it almost every day.  Of course his favorite part is the airplane section. He almost has it memorized.  We also own the lights and ladders dvd and he does enjoying watching it but not as much as this one.  Highly recommended.,1213660800,,322,4.063492063492063

2804894,5,B000OY9VDY,"A fantastic DVD for kids! It is very educational and fun at the same time. It shows all aspects of operations in airports, race tracks, etc.
My 4-yr-old son was glued to the TV the whole time. Now after watching it so many times, he loves explaining things to me about the subjects they cover in the DVD.
It was our second DVD from Mighty Machines series and we both recommend it with four thumbs up.
I am so tired of kids programming on cable TVs nowadays - cartoons with rude languages, eyes and limbs popping as reactions to anything...
Mighty Machine series DVDs are so well done. They are fun and keep the kids' attention, but also they explain how things work in real world and boost the kids' confidence as a society member and a learner.",1271548800,,745,4.405797101449275
