I'm really glad I did, the sound is fine if you have decent equipment, in fact I'd say it's very good. The content is just the concert and everything is in Japanese. Well, what do you expect? lol It doesn't get in the way of the concert and the DVD is still in chapters if you want to jump around, just like you'd expect.

If you are not familiar with Aldious and have been pointed here by Amazon by some off the wall recommendation process, you got lucky. Their studio albums are good but feel a little gentle in terms of metal, this DVD shows that they are anything but. This is some excellent metal that just happens to be played by five young Japanese women including a lead singer, who's style is a little different and soft, that is ultimately very talented and makes nice noises. Add Little Bo Peep, who lost her sheep, but found a pink flying V and owned it instead, and the universe is a better place for for what came next.",1500595200,2,1028,4.244897959183674

A rock show where you can't hear the lead guitarist play is a big shame.",1450137600,,167,3.9411764705882355
8689741,5,B00PXS6VTS,"Great live show.  I love this band.  They may look like The Spice Girls, but musically, they're in league with Metallica, Iron Maiden and any other great metal band you can name..  If this is what is happening in Japan, I've lost interest in what's happening musically in the States.",1434412800,4,283,4.62
8689742,5,B00PXS6VTS,"This is a pretty cool DVD to watch, I really like Aldious and this is sadly the only way to watch them perform since they don't tour outside of Japan it seems (I could be wrong and they have at some point) The girls give a pretty awesome performance and have a great time too you can tell. Overall I enjoyed this DVD, but if you like extras like most bands put on their DVD's this one has nothing at all. You just get the 23 song concert and that's all, though if they did put any extras on it most people might not bother with it anyways since no subtitles so they wouldn't know what is being said anyways.",1430006400,2,607,4.066666666666666
