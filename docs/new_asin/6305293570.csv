7886966,5,6305293570,"This is one of the best volumes in the Magical Project S series.
This volume is mostly about friendship,and love. In episode 8, I think it's really cute when Misao and Sasami hold hands. In episode 9, there's a lot of twists and turns when Sasami and her father land on a deserted island. Who will save them? Will Pixy Misa get there first? In episode 10, Sasami and her father travel to a western town and meet a friend. There, Sasami has her work cut out for her as Pixy Misa arrives to help the mayors enemy destroy the town. This is a wacky and fun volume you just don't want to miss!!!!",1024704000,,591,4.192982456140351
7886967,4,6305293570,"The series ends (volume 8 of 8) with a character that looks alot like Ryoko to (of course!) help out against the character that looks alot like Aeka (some things NEVER change! But at least there's no Tenchi around to fight over in this episode though.
The plot is filled in starts to really make sense after some missing information is revealed about just how the earth and this other world the Queen candidates came from are intertwined.

My favorite scenes from this volume are when Pretty Sammy is a passenger in father's motorcyle sidecart.  Very very cute.  Unfortunately, her father is not the best of drivers, and they get lost and crash land onto an island.  Will Pixy Misa be able to find here here?

7886971,4,6305293570,"I love Japanese animation and I want to share that love with my kids. Unfortunatly, the majority of anime has themes and situations that are not particularly family friendly. This is not the case in the 'Magical Project S' series. All of the videos are delightful! The animation is very good, the characters are funny, and Pretty Sammy is awesome. My kids love this series and so do I. If you are in search of an anime series that you can share with anyone from 2 to 200, this is the series.",994809600,,491,4.3478260869565215
