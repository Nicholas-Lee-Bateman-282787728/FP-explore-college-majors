He has a great voice but I felt cheated as being the ""star"" usually means watching him.  The story was okay but seemed offensive at times towards Italy.  Save your money if you have already seen everything he has done on Amazon.  If you haven't go straight to ""Hawking"", ""Amazing Grace"", The Fifth Estate"",""12 Years a Slave"" , ""Star Trek into Darkness"" and my personal favorites, of course, ""Sherlock"" and ""Parades End"".  We are seeing the meteoric rise of the new Laurence Oliver, Anthony Hopkins, Ian McCellan, and other incredible actors from the past.",1392940800,16,675,4.87719298245614
