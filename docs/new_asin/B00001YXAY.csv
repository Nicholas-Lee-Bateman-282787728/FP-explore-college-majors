1247739,3,B00001YXAY,"Ok, before he went on to fame and glory in Revenge of the Nerds, Robert Carradine did this fine film for which he obviously got short-changed for not getting an Oscar.  This is perhaps the greatest film ever committed to celluloid, outside of your finer late 70's and 1980's xxx pornography.  This movie, with him and others cavorting about with cheerleaders is simply delightful fun for the entire family, and a great way to spend an evening.  Watch it again and again.",1134086400,3,470,4.7073170731707314
1247750,2,B00001YXAY,"I usually watch a movie like this until the traditional girls' locker room scene is over. I then bail before the plot's unconvincing resolution can nullify any positive impression created by natural breasts and bikini tan lines.  I gave this an extra star because in addition to the okay locker room bit, the movie obliged me by voluntarily quitting before it got to any kind of slapped together conclusion. There is a bonus male shower scene where the high school football team displays sunken chests and broomstick arms.  I bet the offensive line averaged all of 125 lbs (about half what I weighed as a defensive lineman).  The star of the show, hands down, is a candy apple red 1955 Chevy sedan.  We need more films like this to pass legislation to raise the voting age.",1477180800,,773,4.661764705882353

1247785,2,B00001YXAY,"The Pom Pom Girls (1976) follows the activities of a group of high school students who make trouble, get into fights, and follow wherever their hormones take them.  If you're into mildly rebellious teen dramas, you may appreciate this B-movie.

This probably was a fun flick to make, as nothing is treated with any respect.  The cast is turned loose as the movie is mostly a series of fights, pranks, reckless acts, and awkward romances, as close friends, and teammates on the football team, Johnnie (Robert Carradine,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Revenge-of-the-Nerds/dp/B00IXD2MMU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Revenge of the Nerds</a>&nbsp;(1984)) and Jesse (Michael Mullins), hook up with Laurie (Jennifer Ashley,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inseminoid/dp/B00000I1ZI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inseminoid</a>&nbsp;(1981)) and Sally (Lisa Reeves), members of the pom pom squad.

The film features some slices of high school life, from the long bygone 70's.  Whether you find the antics of Johnnie and Jesse amusing, these are the kind of guys who may seem familiar, regardless of the time period.  Football plays a very small role, and the pom pom element is hardly worth mentioning, as the girls are mostly along for the ride.

The Pom Pom Girls is also included in the 12 movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Too-Cool-For-School-Collection/dp/B002DQSKMY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Too Cool For School Collection</a>, a very low cost three disc set, featuring Crown International Pictures comedies released in the 70's and 80's.

1247789,3,B00001YXAY,"The title pretty much says it all.  This movie was made to be forgotten if you bothered to watch it at all.  Basically it's a forgettable Seventies high school comedy that might strike a nostalgic chord if you happened to have been there.  Others be forwarned.  This flick was not so much made but manufactured for the drive-in audience.  It was designed to be triple-billed with other innocuous fare for a teen audience with little to do on a Saturday night.  You can stop at any point and neck with your honey and you're not going to miss much.  You can gauge what's going on if you really care.  ""Schindler's List"" this is not.

7915109,2,B00001YXAY,"In the past year, I have become fascinated with exploitation films that were popular in the late 60's and throughout the entire 1970's. I was not a teenager until the early 1980's but did manage to catch a few of these classics at drive in theaters before they disappeared practically overnight. Back then, the only thing our generation knew was that these films were pretty outdated yet contained just enough nudity to get things rolling in the back seat of the car with a member of the opposite sex. Now that I'm older, I thought it would be fun to revisit these campy films to see if they had any real substance or were just made for the older kids in my neighborhood to watch while ""making it"" in the back seat of their cars 5 to 10 years before we did.

FIRST AND FOREMOST, AMAZON CLAIMS THIS MOVIE WAS RELEASED IN 1999 WHEN IT ACTUALLY HIT THEATERS IN 1976!

""The Pom-Pom Girls"" gained my attention because it made the top 20 list of Quentin Tarantino's favorite Grindhouse movies.  (It was #20 out of 20.)  My intention in this review is to give you my opinion regarding what Mr. Tarantino took away from this low budget piece of crap.  Furthermore,  a synopsis is useless because the movie has no plot and most of the scenes are high stakes teenage shenanigans that don't flow together to make a story of any kind.  With the exception of the final scene, this movie could have been edited 100 different ways and the outcome would have been exactly the same.  It sucks.

For me, there are basically two aspects of this picture that are interesting and did perhaps resonate with Mr. Tarantino.  Seeing Robert Carradine (as Jonnie) play a bad ass is pretty difficult to make believable.  Having said that, there is one fact that needs to be pointed out.  While we all know him best as the gullible character 'Lewis' from the ""Revenge of the Nerds"" franchise, you must remember that these films were not yet made.  Mr. Carradine is by no means a credible tough guy, but about 20 minutes into ""The Pom Pom Girls"" you realize that he is f-ing crazy and will do anything (including risking his life) for no apparent reason.  He is the leader of his circle of friends and no matter what insane idea he comes up with they seem to go along with it for the most part.  You're probably wondering ""What the hell does this have to do with Tarantino""?  Stick with me here.

Robert Carradine (Johnnie) has a killer 1955 red Chevy sedan and figuratively drives it to hell and back.  He constantly pushes the car to the brink of destruction and unfortunately some of the impressive stunt driving gets lost because you're distracted by the lack of a plot.  Honestly, I can find no evidence regarding my opinion as to why this awful movie made Quentin Tarantino's list of favorite Grindhouse films.  When thinking about it, however, I could only come to one conclusion; ""It's the car, stupid"". The story for Death Proof developed from Quentin Tarantino's fascination for the way stuntmen would death-proof stunt cars so a driver could survive horrific, high-speed crashes and collisions.  So is it possible that ""The Pom Pom Girls"" was a tiny spark that ultimately fueled the film ""Death Proof""?  (I really have no idea.)

We all know that Quentin has worked with David Carradine, however, I wanted to know if he had worked with Robert.  I wasn't looking for a big role, but rather a small one that might connect the two together and shed some light on Tarantino's affection for ""The Pom Pom Girls"".  My thought was simple; If Quentin was somehow inspired by this piece of sh*t film I can guarantee he put Robert in one of his movies as a gesture of gratitude.  I didn't know it at the time, but I was exactly correct.  Robert appeared as one of the trackers in ""Django Unchained"".  I'm not saying this is proof of anything.  I'm simply throwing it out there because it's the kind of thing that Quentin Tarantino would do.  What say you?",1479427200,,3925,4.565714285714286
