I was also there that day, although i was not in the same building. I was friends with alot of the people that got shot, and with some of the people that were held hostage. as a matter of fact, Beamon was supposed to call me that day after school. but thats all im going to say about that because i don't want to scare my kids by breaking down right now. Johnny...i never knew that you were the one. i cant even imagine how your life has been since that day. i don't think ive even talked to you since just after it all. email me some time... yeah_baby_its_wicked_@msn.com

1628052,5,B00005N5QX,"I was impressed with the leads and this is a movie based on actual happenings. Prinze in one of his better roles and Schroder has never been better. the school shooting footage themselves might disturb a lot of viewers and it puts thoughts in your mind. Schroder is electric as the kid who was once a student at the school, comes back. Henry Winkler is great also as the police chief. powerful, violent to the extreme and a shcoking end that will leave you hanging.",1066780800,,465,4.482352941176471
1628053,4,B00005N5QX,"I was actually an extra in this film. During production the film was called ""Detention"". The director and everyone in the cast did an amazing job putting this movie together in the short time that it took. When I finally saw the finished version on television I was stunned at how mesmerizing this film actually was and I was there for the filming of most of it. There are several really good actors and actresses in this film and this is a most see kind of movie. Enjoy!",1049414400,2,471,4.363636363636363
1628054,4,B00005N5QX,"This film is based on actual events at Lindhurst High School in Olivehurst, California, May 1, 1992.  The local community strongly resisted and resented the making of this film, but they tuned in just the same, and those of us involved agreed that the film is a powerfully, even disturbingly, truthful presentation of the events of a shooting spree followed by an eight hour standoff and hostage negotiation.
  I was a technical adviser for this film, and so had the priviledge of visiting the set to see some of the filming, and to meet the cast and crew.  Everyone involved with the project invested themselves very heavily in this project, were happy to be working with the director Michael Watkins (a real talent), and showed genuine interest in portraying reality as closely as possible.  Their dedication really shows in the final product.  Obviously, liberties have to be taken to keep a desensitized television audience enrapt, but truth be known, the portrayals in this film are very close to the reality of the situation, at least from the perspectives of the character portrayed by Freddie Prinze Jr.  Henry Winkler's character is based on the story of another technical advisor to the production, and I suspect that this is also very close to reality.  In fact, much of the script is taken from transcripts of tapes the police made of the event with hidden microphones.  Producer Steve Natt and his associates worked for nearly three years to get this movie off the ground and have it done right.
  Ten years ago, I lost a beloved teacher and three beloved classmates to a gunman whose own life had spiralled down into hopelessness and dispair.  His pain and anguish led him to cause inflict pain and anguish on others about which the local paper still runs articles.  The top-notch performances by the writer, the actors, the director, and every member of the crew made this an extraordinarily watchable, yet true-to-life portrayal of a tragedy that torments many lives still today.
  The truth is always worth telling, and this film does it.",1020297600,12,2055,4.881844380403458
1628055,4,B00005N5QX,"Until NYPD Blue did I ever see Ricky Schroeder in a dramatic roll as an adult. I loved him in that show, as did I in ""Hostage High.""  He acted the part extremely well. His facial expressions and blank stares during the movie were eerie. Just like that of an actual crazed killer. Yet he also showed the confused and caring side of this person Jason Copeland.
I only wish they would have given more detail about the real incident and people involved. The end of the movie sort of left me hanging,wanting to know more about the actual event and the life of the actual killer.",1013299200,,573,4.355140186915888
1628056,4,B00005N5QX,"I never heard of this movie before, so I decided to gamble as it has Rick Schroeder, who played Jon Voight's little boy in the 1979 The Champ. And this movie really exciting as it keeps you glued to the screen for its 90 mins running time.
The story is about a high school Drop out (Rick Schroeder) who got fired from his job because he has no high school diploma. So he came back to his old high school and started shooting at teachers and students and held the entire school hostage. It is said to be based on a true story but didn't say when it took place. Henry Winkler is great as the role of hostage negotiator. Freddie Prinze Jr co star as one of the student hostages.
The DVD is OK. The full screen picture is bright and clear and the sound is not too bad considering a made for TV movie. Overall this DVD is worth at least a rental.",1006473600,3,841,4.1030303030303035
7946114,3,B00005N5QX,"I currently only have this film on VHS, and just rewatched it this past weekend, good but unquestionably disturbing. I have never witnessed these events first hand, but between Columbine and the bully related shootings and suicides, adults turning a blind eye to the severity of the issue, is No longer a rational option. 'Those who don't learn from their past, are doomed to repeat it' Possibly paraphrased, but hopefully you get my point, 'history repeats itself'. The three main actors did a nice job- seeing Freddie Prinze Jr. do a non-comedic role before everything else was neat, Henry Winkler, who I like anyway, was very good as the cop/ negotiator. Rick Schroder was tragically convincing as a late teen who finally got pushed over the edge, after losing everything he cared about. I don't condone his actions, to be clear, but can empathize with what he was going through. The script went back and forth between painting Jason/ R S as psychotic to a more tragic figure, which was also a nice touch. In case you haven't noticed from this review: I'm very anti-bully, anti-ignorance, scandal and many others that I'm running out of patience with. I may get the DVD, but right now, I'm not sure.",1465257600,,1202,4.783653846153846
7946115,4,B00005N5QX,"This was filmed at my old High School, Jordan High in Sandy, Utah just before it was torn down and rebuild. Was a total trip down memory lane for some of the scenes. Although, what the were using as the ""band room"" was actually the ""choir room"" Rick Schroder did an excellent job as did Henry Winkler & Freddie Prinz Jr. All in all, a pretty good early 90's flick touching on a subject matter that was ahead of its time, Columbine happening not too long after the release of this picture. Oh, and problem for me, the cover shows flames shooting out of the windows, Never happened in the movie. Guess the distributors thought it would make for a more eye-catching cover.",1460073600,,669,4.4471544715447155
7946116,4,B00005N5QX,"I was a Junior in high school at the ""rival"" school MHS across town. My boyfriend was a senior in high school at Lindhurst high school at the time of the shooting, but was out sick that day. He lost a few good friends and a teacher that day. I remember our school having us run to meet our parents , as they weren't sure if the gunman was going to move from school to school or not. I remember listening to the radio and watching the news in disbelief that this was happening in our small town. Today my children attend Lindhurst and on May 1, 2015 one of the deceased students mother visited the school and shared memories to my daughters class of her son. I give this movie four stars for the fact they portrayed a high school in a small town that not many people know of.",1430611200,,774,4.132450331125828
7946117,5,B00005N5QX,"Haven't seen the Movie but I'm about to order it right now.
I gave 5 Stars just because its based on LHS. This school has the most Asian and Hispanic Kids attending that school I don't know why they have only white kids n the movie. Anyway ORDER UP!",1420416000,,249,4.1020408163265305

7946119,5,B00005N5QX,"I've seen this movie a long time ago when I was still in High School and I was really touched by this true story of how one young teen can go to any extent to put many innocent lives at stake just because he failed. This can't be acceptable for punishing those students who have nothing to do with his problem, IT'S JUST NOT RIGHT MAN!!!",1373328000,,337,4.121212121212121

7946121,5,B00005N5QX,"We loved the movie and watched it several times. It came in the mail very quickly.  In fact, it came in the mail a couple of days later.  The movie was good.  I liked how the young man kept his head and worked with the police to get not only himself but his fellow classmates released from the hostage situation.",1281052800,,312,4.166666666666667
7946122,2,B00005N5QX,"I was one of the real-life hostages, so I bought the movie as soon as I heard about it.  I knew it was a made for TV movie, so I wasn't expecting Oscar quality.  I realize this is only ""based on"" a true story, so they have some artistic license, but they definitely did not capture the mood of the real-life events.  It is much more like a mash up of the real event and a 12 year old's pizza party, which I found insulting.  We did crack jokes and try to lighten the mood, but that is something you have to do in order to deal with having a gun pointed at you all the time.  I blame the direction.  All of that aside, the movie was interesting to watch, even as a watered-down version of the events and I think it would be a good conversation starter for parents and their children.  I also give Henry Winkler a hair comb and two thumbs up.  ""ehhhhh""",1172102400,2,850,4.047904191616767
7946123,5,B00005N5QX,"I was a senior at Lindhurst High School the day of the shooting in 1992, and this movie, which the story was based, has done its homework. There is not a day that goes by that I am not, in some way, reminded or affected by the horrific events of that May 1 day. I was 19 at the time of the shooting when I lost my first period teacher, which this film portrays. He was more like a lifelong family friend than just my Civics Instructor. He was a true mentor to me and an inspiration to everyone who knew him. He will continue to be missed and never forgotten. This true-to-life epic recaptures the raw terror and horror of the siege. I very highly recommend this movie to everyone.",1152921600,4,680,4.198473282442748
