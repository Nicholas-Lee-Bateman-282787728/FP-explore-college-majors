2680216,5,B000JYW5BE,"Our home was burglarized late last year, and one of the casualties was our awesome DVD collection, so we're slowly but surely replacing everything. I have a new sign on my door: ""Nothing in this house is worth dieing for!""
This double hitter of Mr. Lee's was high on our list to repurchase.
Now, I'm not a Tommy Lee fan, although I do like most of his movies, my wife made sure this part of the collection was replaced in haste.
Personally, I prefer him in a drama than a comedy, like Men In Black I & II (which we also repurchased). His face is suited for drama. He makes you believe.
Having two movies on one disk is very convenient. Good thinking.

Also, Harrison Ford is a darn good actor, although in real life he has the personality of a tomato. Wesley Snipes is a very good action figure, in the right movie.",1273881600,,815,4.292207792207792

2680223,4,B000JYW5BE,"More than a decade on, The Fugitive holds up surprisingly well, managing to neatly avoid the usual pitfalls of TV-series-to-movie crossovers by opting to tell a single self-contained story rather than trying to set up a new franchise. Thus Harrison Ford's Richard Kimble doesn't go on the road helping strangers resolve their problems because he's too busy trying to evade capture, prove his innocence and catch his wife's killer, making for an entirely satisfying manhunt thriller that stands on its own merits. Chief among them is Tommy Lee Jones, taking over from a dying Richard Jordan and walking off with the movie as his dogged pursuer, getting all the best lines and effortlessly outshining the film's star.

Structurally the follow-up, U.S. Marshals, is a reworking of the original, fulfilling the classic sequel brief of ""the same but different"": the producers substitute an incredibly impressive plane crash for the incredibly impressive train crash, a fall from a tall building for a fall from a dam and government defense secrets for drugs trials while throwing in the same plot device of an ally who turns out to be an enemy. The main difference here is no Harrison Ford, more Tommy Lee Jones and added Wesley Snipes (presumably on the run from the taxman) and Robert Downey Jr. (who really should have kept the sunglasses on until he finished rehab). There are no surprises, it's somewhat overlong and you won't remember it a day later, but it's energetically directed by Stuart Baird and superbly edited by Terry Rawlings and does its job effectively enough while you're watching it.",1165795200,24,1599,5.033962264150944

2680347,5,B000JYW5BE,"Two movies held together by a relentless lawman played skillfully by Tommy Lee Jones. Both runners are Innocent, but otherwise as different as can be. In The Fugitive, Harrison Ford is wrongfully convicted of his wife's murder, escapes, and the chase begins. In U.S.Marshalls, Wesley Snipes plays a murder suspect, who escapes on a Prison Transport Plane, where Tommy Lee, just happens to be a passenger, and the chase begins.

When I brought this set I looked up the features as I'm a DVD Features guy and saw it said it had all the features that you would get on the individual releases, meaning I'm buying both for the price of one. I thought, cool, unfortunately while The Fugitive has everything that the individual release has(commentary, documentaries, etc), U.S. Marshals only has a commentary track. I'm assuming the original DVD release of the 2nd film was a two disc or 2 sided DVD, so the rest of the features are not present for this reason(since this is a double sided release with each film on its own side), but what bugs me is that WB list the features. So unless you don't care for features, I'd say buy them separate(watch out for the Tommy Lee Jones 4 Film Collection as well as the U.S. Marshals disc is bare bones)",1365724800,11,832,4.444444444444445

2680433,5,B000JYW5BE,"The Fugitive - U.S. Marshals

The 1993 movie ""The Fugitive"" is great entertainment. Some say it was based on a true crime, the conviction of a surgeon for murder in Cleveland Ohio in 1954. A dozen years later lawyer F. Lee Bailey sued for a new and fair trial based on the biased newspaper coverage; the conviction was then overturned. ""The Wrong Man"" by James Neff is the latest book on this interesting case. A fictional novel is always better when it is based on a true crime. This is a murder mystery, an example of wrongful conviction, an escape and action movie, plus an expose or warning about a corporation that applies for a fraudulent patent on a medicine. It alone makes this product a good buy.

""U. S. Marshals"" from 1998 is a sequel that uses most of the same characters from the earlier movie. It is an old Hollywood tradition to produce another movie based on an earlier successful movie. ""Jaws"" was followed by ""Jaws 2"" and ""Jaws 3"" (with diminishing returns). The 1931 movie ""Dracula"" was followed by innumerable sequels that used the same idea of a powerful monster that attacked humanity but was defeated in the end. The market for this story died out around 1945. ""Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein"" marked the end of the series. Real concerns of the people led to new horror movies that echoed the threat from invaders from another planet. Some symbolized the threat from atomic warfare. This movie is not as good as the original ,perhaps due to the plot (it has plenty of action). The idea of an innocent man charged with a double murder may have been inspired by a famous court case from 1995. Could this interesting idea from a true crime have failed due to its echo of a controversial crime that was unsolved? Or did parts of the story seem too incredible to the audience?",1360540800,4,1800,4.586956521739131

2680448,4,B000JYW5BE,"Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones have yet to make truly bad movies, these are no exception.

Both movies in the action genere provide base thriller escapism at a very reasonable price.

US marshalls is possibly the better of the two, but mostly because of the lead acting, though to be fair there's not much to choose between them.

Ford gives a more than credible performance in ""The Fugitive"", both films sweep the viewer along with easily followed storylines from start to finish.

I'd rate the films as follows:

Overall quality, both 4*
Acting, both 5*
Sets, both 4*
Special effects, Fugitive 4* and Marshalls 5*
Direction and production, both 4*

Sit back and enjoy, perhaps more than once.",1325116800,,697,4.815126050420168

2680450,5,B000JYW5BE,This double feature dvd has a lot of action and some suspence. These are 2 good films with well known actors in them. I received this item earlier than expected and I got a good deal on them as well.,1308787200,,199,4.0
2680451,5,B000JYW5BE,i loved the Fugitive and had never seen U.S. Marshalls. I liked it a lot. Great quality1,1289088000,,88,4.235294117647059
2680452,4,B000JYW5BE,These are both pretty good movies with a slight connection of having Tommy Lee Jones and his US Marshal crew being the hunters.  The plots are well done with just enough twists to keep your interest.  The acting is solid in both but I actually liked Wesley Snipes better than Harrison Fords version. Robert Downey is solid in US Marshals and makes it better because of his acting.  Tommy Lee is his usual scene chewing character but always fun to watch.  As a 2 film set this is a real bargain.,1286150400,5,494,4.395604395604396
