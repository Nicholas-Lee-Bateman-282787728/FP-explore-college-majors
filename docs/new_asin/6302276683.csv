8294412,4,6302276683,"Living language: French, by Crown Video, is an excellent videotape for learning the basics of French.  It is easier to learn a language this way than from a book or audio tape, because you engage more senses to learn.  In a book, you don't hear the pronunciation and the pronunciation guides are often difficult to follow.  In an audiotape, it is easy to lose your place of where you are at, without the visual clues of a video.  This video is well organized.  You follow a couple from arriving at an airport, to checking into a hotel, to locating and dining at a restaurant, to going shopping.  Phrases are spoken slowly and clearly enough for understanding and English translations are provided verbally and in writing.  Previous concepts taught are built upon in a logical order.  The level of complexity is right for a novice.  Keep in mind that this is strictly a conversational course-French words are not spelled out at all in this video.  I think that would have improved the video, if it had been present.  Others might argue that it would have added unneeded complexity to the video.  Also, there is no written study guide to go along with the video-what you see on the screen is what you get.",1139529600,5,1203,4.622641509433962
