7903604,5,B000006421,"I have been searching for this VHS tape for 5 years.  Takes me back to my kid days when the Hell Drivers and Auto Thrill Show came to my small town once a year.  Joie Chitwood was the master showman.  All of the acts were pretty much the same, but Chitwood was the master showman.  His son ran Indianapolis Motor Speedway for years.  Saw the tape at the Belleville Midget Highbanks Hall of Fame years ago and had almost given up finding even a badly used/ abused edition.  An epiphany said, ""try Amazon!"".  They had a brand new one.  Almost afraid to play it, because I don't believe I'll find another. But play it I will.  Ah for the sound of crashing metal and the antics of the clown.  Nostalgia time.  Thanks, Amazon.",1323302400,,721,4.345864661654136
