8189373,1,B000P6R9KI,There is just way too much talking on this video and alot of boring footage. We were looking for more of the racing scenes as some of the videos show the races and my sons like to race their cars on the floor simultaneously. I would watch an old race on YouTube before buying this next time.,1367280000,,291,4.12280701754386

8189375,3,B000P6R9KI,"I'll give Volume #2 of this series, 3.5 stars, because it has good enough bonus features and one excellent episode. However, the other two episodes are only average. Once again, everything is in widescreen format and the episodes are in 5.1 surround sound. The Dvd full running time is about 180 minutes (including the bonus features).

Each of the three different episodes on this Dvd are about 44 minutes long and are narrated by actor J.K. Simmons (he played Ralph Earnhardt in the ESPN tv movie ""3""). The best episode is ""The Cars"". It starts off by showing 14 cars from both today and yesteryear running on the same track. Although these cars aren't actually racing together, it looks very cool to see Jeff Gordon's 1995 ""Rainbow Warrior"" car driving alongside the 1964 Mercury Marauder, etc. Too bad it all lasts less than a minute. Still, it looks so cool! Luckily, they also show enough real racing footage of these classic cars later on. As well, all these cars are also featured in the 360 degree close-up view bonus feature, ""The Ultimate Starting Grid"" (see BONUS FEATURES section in this review for more info).

""The Cars"" episode was also of interest for it's many excellent interviews with several NASCAR drivers, owners and crew chiefs. I learned so much about NASCAR from this episode. The candid stories about cheating were of particular interest to me. Darrell Waltrip admits to using a 50 lb. radio (filled with lead), to pass the pre-race weight inspection, and then once he pitted, they just took it out. Although all, or most of the drivers were also cheating, it was still weird to hear Darrell admit to it. GRADE: A

""The Dirt"" episode mostly focused on moonshine, Bill France, and the early Daytona races. I wish it had more information about dirt racing, but at least it was all satisfactory enough to keep it moderately interesting. GRADE: C

The ""Speed and Danger"" episode covered much of the same stuff that Volume #1 covered, but also had more about the deaths of Adam Petty, Fireball Roberts, and Dale Earnhardt. None of this stuff was very involved and this episode was rather boring. However, the brief but very good crash highlights, while discussing  super speedway racing, did get my interest back. They were even better than the several crashes they have in one of the bonus features (also on this Dvd). GRADE: C

BONUS FEATURES (all in widescreen):
Ultimate Starting Grid (14 minutes long): Full 360 degree views of 14 different cars. They play music in the background as the camera sweeps across the cars, close enough to read everything that's written on them. The cars are: 1950 Plymouth Deluxe Fastback (#98-Johnny Mantz); 1951 Hudson Hornet (#6); 1959 Plymouth Savoy (#43-First Chrysler raced by the Pettys); 1963 Chevy Impala (#3 Junior Johnson); 1964 Mercury Marauder (#16-Darel Dieringer); 1966 Chevy Chevelle (#29-N.Bonnett + B.Allison); 1967 Chevy Chevelle (#13); 1969 Dodge Charger Daytona (weird huge wing-#7 Jack McCoy); 1969 Ford Torino Talladega (#17 David Pearson); 1972 Ford Torino (#41 B.Unser); 1982 Buick Regal (#1 Buddy Baker); 1984 Pontiac Gran Prix (#43 Richard Petty-STP); 1995 Chevy Monte Carlo (#24 Jeff Gordon- Rainbow Warrior paint scheme); 1995 Chevy Monte Carlo (#3 Dale Earnhardt-Goodwrench Service paint scheme). GRADE: B+

Paint Jobs (8 minutes): Features the paint schemes of Richard Petty (#43), Jeff Gordon (Rainbow Warrior), and Dale Earnhardt (#3-Black Goodwrench car). They don't show any decals or paint being applied, but instead talk about the origins of these paint schemes. GRADE: B

Cheater's Notebook (8.5 minutes): More great stories about cheating. At the end, crew chief Michael ""Fatback"" McSwain says that trying to trick the NASCAR officials is like a big game. I'm sure NASCAR really liked hearing that ""Fatback"". GRADE: A

They Walked Away (17 minutes): Features 11 crashes (each about 1-3 minutes long) from several different camera angles (including in-car ones), all from the actual tv broadcasts with the actual tv announcer commentary. They are: 2001 Daytona 500 (3 minutes) -Tony Stewarts flip; 2002 California-Dale Jr. hits wall; 2003 Daytona 500-Ryan Newman flip and roll; 2003 Talladega-Elliot Sadler's flip and rolls; 2003 Chicagoland-B.Labonte's car on fire; 2004 Daytona 500-M.Waltrips flip+other cars; 2004 North Carolina- Carl Long rollover; 2005 Daytona 500-Scott Wimmer Flip and roll; 2005 Talladega (UAW Ford 500)-various cars involved + interview with M.Waltrip, then they show Scott Riggs separate flip over; 2006 Homestead-Miami-J.P.Montoya's car on fire; 2007 Daytona 500-Clint Boyer finishes race on his roof. GRADE: B+

So, even if you've seen these three episodes already (on ESPN), you still might want to get this Vol. #2 Dvd, just to see the bonus features. Nothing earth-shattering, but still enjoyable enough.",1189814400,3,4830,5.172855313700384
8189376,5,B000P6R9KI,"This is the 2nd of 4 DVDs in this series. There's a LOT of information on each DVD.  I bought all 4 for my son's 10th birthday.  There are plenty of crashes, interviews, etc.",1188518400,,174,4.088235294117647
