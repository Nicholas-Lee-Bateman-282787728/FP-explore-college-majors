8016758,5,B0001W2W7G,"This was a special that aired on tv in the early 90's, it doesn't really give up any new info on Madonna but it was fun to watch as the host kept asking her to call in since it was a ""live"" telecast, it has some fun insight on her career mainly through interviews by people who ""knew/know"" her, there's even an interview and ""live"" performance by former back up dancer Slam from the Blond Ambition tour, cheesy at it's best, it's worth the 80 minutes of your time, if you're a Madonna fan, pick this rare vhs up and enjoy!",1334016000,2,522,4.178217821782178
