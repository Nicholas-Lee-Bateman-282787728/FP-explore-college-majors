7583776,5,B019WMTX72,"Dignity...that is the theme that kept me thinking throughout the film.  The dignity of the main actress and she tries to struggle with her feelings for her family as she leaves for new shores in America.  The dignity of the two men who are dating her - and they are searching for love - not just a good time with a girl.  The dignity of work and of her efforts at accounting school.  The dignity of her sister who let her younger sibling make the jump to a new land rather than herself.  The dignity of the Irish workers - now unemployed - who gather together at Christmas and revisit their feelings for their old homeland. The dignity of the priest who helps the young woman.

Everything from the subtle characters to the music to the cinematagraphy works in unison.  And Saoirise Ronan shines.  A lovely woman inside and out.  You can't fake that.

Best movie of the year in my book.",1452124800,387,885,4.407407407407407
7583777,5,B019WMTX72,"In 1952, young Irishwoman Eilis Lacey yearns for a better life in her small town.  Opportunity knocks when Eilis' sister Rose arranges for her to move to America.  After a tough crossing of the Atlantic, Eilis comes to rest in Brooklyn in an extended Irish community, with a job at a department store and a traditional Irish landlady to watch over her.  Eilis is homesick, but her life picks up when she meets Tony Fiorello, a young Italian plumber who falls hard for her.  However, her old life isn't quite finished with her.  Her sister Rose dies suddenly, and Eilis returns Ireland to be with family and friends.  Her old life looks different now, and with skills learned in America, Eilis finds she may have to choose between either of two futures.

""Brooklyn"" is a beautiful movie, authentic to the period and thoughtful in its pacing.  The location shooting is wonderful, capturing the details of life in a small Irish town, in 1950's Brooklyn, and even in steerage in a trans-Atlantic liner.  If the story line is perhaps predictable, the execution is marvelous, and the director gets everything out of a group of good actors, especially Saoirse Ronan as Eilis Lacey.  Very highly recommended as an excellent movie experience.",1452038400,7,1233,4.856459330143541
7583778,5,B019WMTX72,"I saw this movie and was very moved by the story and performance of the actors. I'm not one to cry for a movie, but this made me cry with joy and sadness. It is a movie that I hope to own and place in my collection of movies to watch again and again. I'm looking forward to Amazon.com making this title available for purchase.",1452038400,4,326,4.030769230769231
7583779,4,B019WMTX72,"""Brooklyn"" (2015 release; 112 min.) brings the story of a small town's young Irish woman Eilis Lacey (played by Saoirse Ronan). As the movie opens, we see Eilis get up early to go to church, after which it's just another day at work (in a grocery store), except that Eilis informs her employer that she's moving to New York, courtesy of a contact her sister Rose made in New York. Upon first arriving in New York (in the early 1950s), Eilis is overwhelmed by home sickness. Just as things seemingly can't get worse, Eilis meets Tony, a young Italian plumber who seeks to court Eilis. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this movie is directed by Irish director John Crowley and, equally if not more importantly, written by Nick Hornby (based on Colm T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's book of the same name). While the movie is of course plot-heavy (side comment: avoid the trailer at all cost, as it unnecessarily hints at a major plot twist, which turned out to be the case), the movie makers actually play up the emotional aspects to the hilt. Eilis' longing for home (i.e. Ireland) will tug at your heart, as do later scenes. In fact, let's just go ahead and say it outright: ""Brooklyn"" is an old fashioned romantic weepie, the likes of which I haven't seen too much (can't speak for all those Nicolas Sparks movie adaptations). It all falls on the shoulders of Saoirse Ronan, still only 21 yrs. old if you can believe it. She is the heart and soul of the movie, and captures the young women's aching perfectly. There is a great sentimental/romantic orchestral movie score, composed by Michael Brook, that is worth seeking out as well. (The soundtrack is available on Amazon.) *UPDATE* The movie was just awarded multiple Oscar nominations, including Best Picture and Saoirse Ronan for Best Actress.

The movie expanded nationally over the Thanksgiving weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The early evening screening where I saw this at was attended nicely (heavy on the seniors, I might add). If you like a good ol' fashioned love story, with a nice immigrant angle to it (I myself am an immigrant to this country), you cannot go wrong with this, be it in the theater, or eventually on Amazon Instant Video and DVD/Blu-ray, but don't forget to have the Kleenexes handy! ""Brooklyn"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1451692800,12,2405,4.751196172248804
7583780,5,B019WMTX72,"Eilis Lacey (Saoirse Ronan) must leave her beloved sister Rose (Fiona Glascott), and mother, Mary (Jane Brennan), behind on The Emerald Isle to come to America for a chance at a better life sponsored by her mentor, Father Flood (Jim Broadbent). She will arrive with a job and a dream is in her smiling Irish eyes. Her passage is fraught with seasickness and, at times, tossed by terrible weather; thank goodness for a traveled bunkmate with a sassy attitude. Arriving at Ellis Island in New York a bit haphazard and moving directly into a strict but quite amusingly filled, Mrs. Keoghs (Julie Walters) boarding house, Eilis is anxious and very homesick in her new surroundings. The letters from home keep her going as she begins her new life in 1952.

She begins working in a hurried department store and Father Flood keeps her afloat with his support while also enrolling her in night classes for Bookkeeping. She also volunteers (which I found one of the most heartwarming sides of Eilis) at an Irish soup-type kitchen so the men can have food for Christmas and a camaraderie together. These workers have built the bridges, tunnels and so much more in the city and now are unemployed. It is extremely difficult for the Irish people still. Their faces are saddened because of their feelings of longing from the Irish folk songs being sung in memory of their beloved motherland. Eilis is a lovely young woman with a generous soul and a heart of gold now thriving where planted. It is no wonder that she meets a new fella, Tony  (Emory Cohen), quite soon. He also works as hard as Eilis for the American Dream. It is at this point that they begin their story together in New York as he is besotted with her and so is Eilis concerning him.

Well into their ongoing relationship, Eilis must immediately return to her home in Ireland once again to confront dire issues. As time slowly passes she is becoming grounded in her homeland of Ireland once more and realizes the importance of her past and present; with her Irish heritage and all she has known of her village right there and with her new but relatively short life in America. While in Ireland, she meets another possible fella, Jim (Domhnall Gleeson) who is equally caring and impressed with her. These special people and all her memories tug on Eilis sentimental heartstrings, although she is soon solid in her decision about where her home should be.

Based on the novel by Colm Toibin with a fine tuned and impressive screenplay done by Nick Hornby, Director John Crowley offers us the story of a young woman with meager funds but expansive dreams, and she is not afraid to chase them down until she finds what is right for her life. A heart-tugging tale that brings you the feeling that Eilis story could be one of many that have passed through Ellis Island at the time before its closing in 1954. This features gorgeous sights (Yves Belanger) during the fifties; a sprawling New York setting bringing back a more uncomplicated time in our history. Ireland is well represented also as an opposite with its cozy hamlets along with its beautiful coastlines while the fashioned city where the hustle and bustle of Coney Island and downtown New York are quite different. The film is beautifully acted and Saoirse Ronan absolutely amazes as Eilis. This film is a must see;' beautifully picturesque and emotionally endearing as we watch Eilis navigate her life. For me, this is the most heartfelt and enduring movie to come along in quite a long while.",1451606400,106,3505,4.731587561374796

7583817,5,B019WMTX72,"This is one of my favorites. I love period pieces, and this one is such a sweet, heartwarming tale. It is a view of the immigrant experience, shown through the eyes of Eilis Lacey, a young Irish woman. It also involves other characters in her life, of young love with her boyfriend, Tony Fiorello, and of all the hard choices that calls for being an adult. It's a moving tale, and the love story makes you want to root for these two people as there are forces in play that jeopardize them being together. There are also plenty of funny moments mixed in to the drama. Mrs. Kehoe, the lady  who owns the boarding house is quite a character, and so are some of the boarders.

What I can take from this movie is that there were those (not going to give it all away) who either pulled all the strings for Eilis Lacey, often for good reasons, like her sister, Rose, or those who manipulated things to have them go their own way. Not to mention that Tony was not only love-struck, but persuasive.  What did Eilis really want? That question permeates through the movie, and I thought it was very well done.",1532649600,,1098,4.372549019607843

7584060,5,B019WMTX72,"A rare gem in today's movie-making world, ""Brooklyn"" is a showcase of  intelligent, believable characters and honest emotions, leavened with just enough quiet humor to block any descent into soap opera or melodrama.  Outstanding script and performances distinguish this from just another lazy formulaic rom-com, and the period setting of early 1950s Ireland and New York lends a warm nostalgic air.  The Irish and British and American actors are marvelous in their roles and I found myself wanting to read the novel this is based on to perhaps learn more about what happens to everyone besides the two main protagonists.  There is a lot of story suggested but unseen onscreen.  When most movies are shouting at you,  or rocking the theatre with explosions and bad music, ""Brooklyn"" dares to speak softly, in a sweet Irish lilt, an Italian-American grin, and to the  tender rhythms of a Gaelic waltz.

Strange not to see Saoirse Ronan noted among the actors in the listing, Amazon!  She's ONLY the LEAD!!

NOTE: the DVD coding leaves a lot to be desired. I'm not going to dock any stars from my review, but trying to access the Director's Commentary was almost impossible. I was stuck in a loop that kept repeating the previews and trailers (annoying enough when trying simply to see the movie).  I finally had to stop the player and remove the disc and start over.  The ""Resume Film"" option just keeps throwing you back into the same  forced studio  promotional crap.  Same for the ""Menu"" option.  Digital has ruined a lot of the DVD experience, once studios figured out they could program a DVD to keep you captive or stopped caring about de-bugging them. I also note that the  bonus feature ""Featurettes"" are very short but there is no option to ""Play All"" so you'll have to punch you controller frequently, and that despite the director's commentary remarks, there are NO Deleted Scenes included on this DVD.",1507680000,2,1911,4.848765432098766

7584072,5,B019WMTX72,"As a son of Irish immigrants to England who now lives in the US, I felt keenly the loss my parents must have felt when leaving Ireland, starting a new life, returning ""home"" to Ireland for holidays with all of us, their kids, but knowing Ireland could never again be their home. At the beginning of the film, I yearned for the homeland of my parents. As the film progressed, I came to terms once again with being now able to call neither Ireland nor England my home, at least as long as I live here in the US. ""Home is where home is."" A wonderful film. And glad to be able to watch one in which a priest is portrayed positively after all the bashing we priests have received, particularly as a result of the scandals back ""home"" in Ireland and elsewhere.",1506816000,,754,4.27972027972028

I'm glad that I waited for the Blu-Ray price to drop to less than $10.

Except for captions, there's absolutely no need to watch this in Blu-Ray.  The sound is DTS but there's no wonderful music so there's no need for DTS (uncompressed audio) either.  No need for a big HD screen either.  You can watch this on your iPhone without missing anything.

My wife and I separately rated it 'meh' -- meaning 3 stars.  Not bad, but not great either.  We could never sit through this film again.

7584127,5,B019WMTX72,"In a time when there are so many blockbuster movies clamoring for our cash it is so nice to find and appreciate a quiet period film like ""Brooklyn"".  When Hollywood insists on making only superhero movies, sequels/remakes, or animated features, this film is a breath of fresh air!  This is a movie about real people in relatable situations with authentic emotions, from the elation of falling in love to the grief of losing a loved one, everything in this film is done with a sense of taste.  From the beautiful writing, to the impeccable acting, to the lovely cinematography, to the colorful costume design, this is a story that has it all in spades.  Being such a nice change of pace from all the CGI-infused nonsense or intense gunplay and brutal violence present in so many movies these days, encountering a film like ""Brooklyn"" makes me hopeful for the future or cinema.  ""Brooklyn"" is artistic without being 'artsy', with genuine emotions and sincere characters, absent the melodrama of the classic films it emulates so well.  The final bit of icing on the cake is that, being a period film, it will undoubtedly age gracefully.  Buying it on Blu-ray is also essential due to the outstanding, understated, colorful production design.  What else can one say but this is a film for those who are tired of the 'old hat' Hollywood, popcorn nonsense being force-fed to the public too, too often.  ""Brooklyn"" is a beautiful film, in every respect.",1499126400,,1446,4.821862348178137

The fact that this was set in a day where there is no internet connectivity punctuates what a hard line of separation existed for immigrants. The fact that the girl marries her boyfriend without a hole lot of thinking and hoopla is actually very true to how young people are. I also think it's true that having gone to America made Elish more interesting and desirable when she returned to her home country.

The acting is world-class. Saoirse Ronan is a revelation. Emory Cohen keeps pace.

The cinematography is stunning, but slightly strange- a favourite of the director is when sound kind of goes in and out and everything slows down. It doesn't detract at all from the importance of this movie.",1492560000,3,553,4.935483870967742

7584175,4,B019WMTX72,"The premise, characters, and relationships in this movie give off plenty of warm glow for basking, but those same elements are also deftly used to illuminate the immigrant experience and explore what it is to be left out in the cold. Though sophisticated in content and effect, the approach is understated, twining together a realistic tale of joy, pain, wit, and the courage it takes to risk that is universal but intimately personal. The first night of the journey to America sets the tone, with the camera staying focused on Ellis and what she experiences--a bit of deck where she and those women pressing around her watch Ireland recede in the distance, a closet-sized double berth she shares with a stranger who pops in late and immediately leaves, a plain dining room where she eats a bad beef stew all alone before the male waiter clues her in about stormy waters ahead, and a night spent with a bucket for a bathroom. It's a horrible, hilariously funny beginning that dishes out misery and means for salvation (actual and metaphorical) in surprising measures. It is a feminist movie about sisters doing it for themselves, looking out for each other, and also looking for husbands to share the journey, without any of them ever talking about women's rights. The film version cut some of the progressiveness story of 1950s America treated in the novel, but it deals with the lack of mobility in post-war (or post-""Emergency,"" for the neutral Irish) Europe and working-class poverty on both sides of the Atlantic, without raising any solution but hard work. It's a different kind of period piece, one person's modest story told with an honesty that accomplishes more than most sprawling epics. That isn't to say it's missing lush cinematography, as to see through Eilis's eyes is to see two beautiful, rich lands with much to love in both, and you'll be sorry to return to your black screen and plain walls when it's finished. Thankfully, modern streaming means you can replay the vision at will, and it's the kind of movie destined to be a holiday treat you can happily return to every Christmas and St. Patrick's Day!",1489276800,3,2124,4.837912087912088

7584183,2,B019WMTX72,"Brooklyn: 4 out of 10. For such a gentle passive costume drama about a 1950s emigrant from Ireland Brooklyn evoked a surprising amount of ire.  First of I am surprised that Saoirse Ronan was nominated for an Oscar in this role. She isn't a bad actress by any means but her character is so passive and banal and inconsistent that it is hard to get a read on the performance.

Leaving aside the main character for a minute the film has a few other issues. While the interiors are filmed well the exteriors (Particularly the ones that are supposed to be in Brooklyn) seem out of a made for PBS movie from the mid-eighties rather than a modern film. One-half expects Raul Julia to pop up in at any moment doing a riff on Casablanca. The remaining characters, with one notable exception doing her best Margaret Hamilton impression, are played as very nice people. Almost too nice. It is as if a Mary Sue convention let out next door. All the characters also only seem to exist to help, enable and be nice to our heroine. They rarely seem to have lives of their own.

Our heroine, by any measure, is a horrible self-centered person. I am unsure if the film even realizes this. Ronan plays her as a passive aggressive social wallflower yet the script seems to have written her as a predatory self-centered narcissist. As a result, we have a character asking a man to walk her home not because she is interested but so she can abandon a new young immigrant girl she finds disagreeable (The film mind you gives us no reason to find this ancillary character disagreeable which makes her declaration even more jarring)

Ronans character then proceeds to tell bigger lies and inflict even greater cruelties on her loved ones and those whose only crime is being nice to her. Yet the film seems strangely oblivious to its protagonists cruelty. A wisp of a film only promoted by a surprise Oscar nomination and a veneer of a decent date night film. It disappoints on almost all levels.",1488499200,,1970,4.572237960339943

The reason the second daughter can abandon her mother and sister to pursue her own selfish dreams is because the elder sister is willing to sacrifice her dreams to take care of their aging mother. Then the elder sister dies. Perhaps if the sisters had shared the care of the mother both sisters could have happy lives. Then the younger sister lies and deceives her family and another family about being married to a man in NYC. Then she again abandons her family and mother in Ireland. It's okay to pursue your dreams as long as no one sacrifices. The mom and elder sister sacrifice everything for the younger sister. She becomes selfish, self centered, a liar, a deceiver, abandons her mother twice, and is a hero?  That's what we want to teach our daughters?

There is one sex scene, but no nudity (in case you plan to watch this with the family).  Great acting.

Spoiler alert:
One minor change I would have made would be for Tony to run to Eilis at the end.  I thought it was strange that he saw her for the first time in weeks (or more) and just took his time crossing the street.  No Tony, you drop your toolbox and run and grab and lift and kiss and grope and squeeze and, well, you get the idea.",1482624000,,641,4.072

7584468,2,B019WMTX72,"I feel about ""Brooklyn"" the way I felt about ""Windtalkers"" -- there's a great story in the history, but this isn't it. The movie is pretty, but the characters are boring.  (The one compelling character is Rose, and she isn't in the story very much.) Eilis is so ambivalent toward the love interest she ultimately chooses that if they were a real couple, I'd be worried about their future.

Overall, it suffers from Independent Movie Disease -- too many characters with too little development, and too little conflict. There's a curious antiquated feel to the main character, Eilis, because she's so wholly passive. Aside from a few sassy comebacks and her only stated desire (she wants to be an accountant!), pretty much everything that happens to her is either set in motion by someone else, or is her tepid reaction to it. That makes her more 1950's Disney princess than brave young immigrant. In fact, the poster completely captures the film: a beautiful picture in which the main character is utterly still.

On the other hand, it has a 97% on Rotten Tomatoes, so maybe I'm missing something.",1481846400,4,1096,4.819148936170213

7584537,5,B019WMTX72,"Brooklyn Review: A Compelling Character Study

 I love this movie, it is amazing that it is a quiet kind of a movie, but it works!  It is so non-clichd.  Watching this movie, I started seeing it at the perfect time when this movie was so relevant to my current journey in life: moving away further away from home for the very first time.  It is so refreshing to watch the ups and downs the character Eilis Lacey goes thru, and Saoirse Ronan plays this part so exceedingly well indeed!  During my favorite time of the year (after the holidays and summer, of course, ha ha), it was awards season and I kept hearing about the rave reviews of Brooklyn.  Kept hearing it was a must see and how Saoirse deserved the Oscar.  So once I saw this movie, wow!  Saoirse was really a close second next to Brie Larsons Oscar-winning portrayal of a young, insufferable mother in another Oscar darling, Room.  Overall, Brie did deserve the gold statuette for Best Actress this past year, but if not for her, Saoirse wouldve won by a landslide!
 But enough about Oscars talk (for now), but anyway, I enjoy how this movie is NOT just a love story, the love triangle serves as the subplot of this story, which is so refreshing.  Yes, it has romance, but I really like how it focuses on the protagonists independence and her character development throughout the movie.  We, as the audience, see this, inside and outside.  Inside, we see Eilis express her inner turmoil of being very homesick, and on the outside, we see how her style transforms over time, the more shes in her new life in Brooklyn, as an American.  We see her outfits evolve, brighter colors, which I pretty much view as symbolic of her character becoming more open-minded to new changes and challenges that bestowed upon her in America.  As Eilis returns back to her homeland of Ireland, we see how she has grown, and we see that part of her heart definitely resides in America permanently, but that is really the central conflict that she faces once she returns back in Ireland.  Watching this, I myself was not real sure what she was going to do, and THIS underlying mystery is where I personally related to this movie.  As in, hmmm, go back to the homeland, or see where your new residency will take you.
 This movie explores the theme of life as an immigrant, yes true, but this movie I thought is really relevant to any American who locates elsewhere further away from their hometown area.  This is because for example, we as the audience see Eilis become less homesick and much more independent and capable of leading a new life away from her original home.  In real life, Americans residing elsewhere pretty much go through the same sorts of things: we wonder what else is out there, we wonder what to explore, yet at the same time we may hesitate of stepping into the unknown, and as the great Robert Frost has once said, taking the road less traveled by.  But anyway, we see Eilis try to adjust to a new job, new people, new surroundings, new everything really, after all, it IS America!  I enjoy how the movie lets the audience see that, as more time goes by in Eiliss new phase in life, her life becomes more exciting, once she opens up to trying new things and while not leaving her heart fully behind in Ireland, she begins to move forward to all of the great things Brooklyn has to offer her, right in front of her.  Literally.  What I really mean by this is, for a great example, when she is at another one of those dances she and her roommates go to downtown one night, and we see that as she is dancing with some guy, we also see another guy standing further away, alone, looking right at Eilis.  He stands literally right in front of her, a distance away, and I just enjoy how he just stands there, watching her, who has no idea that he is.
 Then we get to see Eilis and this guy by the name of Tony hang out together more and more, and he serves as a huge part of her new life.
 Overall,  A MUST SEE!",1480636800,,3967,4.410714285714286

7584651,5,B019WMTX72,"I pushed back more than few tears in reading this book (saw the movie first then had to read the book). I don't think Eilis was happy in the end but she had to settle for the only decision she could make under the sad circumstances she found herself. WARNING  SPOILER ALERT

This meant returning to Brooklyn and Tony. He had wisely (and unwisely) boxed her into a quick marriage before she left due to his own insecurity and fear she might not return. She was pressured into saying ""I love you"" earlier in their relationship when she clearly was not convinced she did. But she didn't want to hurt or lose Tony - who had been the only love interest in her young and innocent life. She ""liked"" Tony and ""liked spending time"" with him but committing to ""I love you"" was something she felt pressured to do. In the movie, the fear in their facial expressions was obvious. It was not a happy joyous occasion as proclaiming ones love should be. Her fear of losing Tony and his fear of rejection (and then relief as she relented) dominated the scenes.

She also resisted his sweet but whiny badgering for them to get married before she left. Even after wondering why a promise to return was not good enough she finally gave in and agreed to marry. Keep in mind, in the book (unlike the movie) they had already had sex so her lack of interest in marriage at this point (especially in 1952) underscores the fact that true love was not there. In the movie, they did not have sex until they had already agreed to get married the next day.

The movie departs from the book in several areas all to enhance the weak and thinly veiled virtue of Eilis whose Catholic upbringing did not seem to slow down here sexual emergence - if anything it enhanced it. In the book she had sex before even discussing marriage which didn't come until several months later and only after confirming she wasn't pregnant. Also the movie does not show the very heavy petting (tongue in mouth, crotch touching, breast cupping, etc) that took place in Ireland between Eilis (married) and Jim who was gradually winning her heart by moving slowly in the relationship and displaying himself as a gallant gentleman with only her best interest in mind.

Two years earlier while still in Ireland during a brief encounter with Jim, Eilis misinterpreted Jim's behavior and took him as rude and stuck up when in fact nothing could be further from the truth. He was just shy and afraid to approach her. After learning how nice Jim truly was and how easy and secure her life with him would be back home with her mum living close by, she started to fall hard for Jim and dream of a life with him. Eilis openly acknowledged to herself she really did not love Tony. She even considered consulting with Jim as to helping her obtain a divorce but immediately rejected the idea (not due to its merit but due to Jim's innocence & how this whole mess would appear to him).

In the end, it was Ms Kelly's not so subtle threatening to spill the beans on her marriage back in Brooklyn to everyone she cared about in Ireland that pushed Eilis into deciding that her only remaining option (with the least collateral damage) was to return to Brooklyn and Tony.

If you notice the author spared Eilis by never revealing in the book what she would write to Jim when she returned to Brooklyn. Her note to Jim in the book only said that she had to return to Brooklyn and would write him with a full explanation, which never occurred or was never revealed. I would have loved to read that one.

Previously in Brooklyn, Eilis was already concerned that once returning to Ireland she might decide to stay so the correct approach for Eilis would have been to insist on an engagement with Tony (as a compromise to marriage). This would have been stronger than a promise (at least in 1952) and still leave Eilis some wiggle room to adjust her life if needed when she returned to Ireland. If she decided to stay in Ireland then having sex with Tony could be denied and often is by girls claiming higher than actual virtue and the engagement could have been broken honorably. Unfortunately - Rose's death which forced Eilis's return to Ireland also deprived her of the only person she could have consulted with about such matters of the heart, something with which she had little experience.

Did Eilis make the right decision in returning to Brooklyn and Tony? - I don't think so but it depends on how you keep score.",1476921600,,4443,4.509316770186335

7584656,5,B019WMTX72,i loved this movie from beginning to end. The acting is superb and the feeling of the 1950's is purely conveyed through the sets and costumes. Chick or no chick....this is a great flick!,1476230400,,186,4.5
7584670,4,B019WMTX72,"I have so many mixed feelings about this film. I think I need to read the book for more answers. This has been running on HBO for the last couple of months and it's, in many ways, a beautiful film though profoundly sad. I've seen it several times now, still trying to understand it and why people think it has a happy ending when it clearly did not.

First things first. What I like. Eillis came to America in 1951, which was a completely different thing than the immigrants who arrived in earlier times. The U.S. was post-war and things were looking up. My parents are first generation children of immigrants and were born around the same time as Eillis so I have some background on the times, specifically in New York, from family stories, photos and their memories. So for anyone thinking that Eillis's immigration process should have been more difficult, this was the 1950s, not the 1890s. It's perfectly plausible that she had help in the process. Just because there wasn't a lot of drama around her arrival in Brooklyn and she didn't live in poverty, doesn't mean that the immigrant experience was depicted incorrectly for the decade it occurred.

The other thing that I think was done right was Tony's Italian family, who were depicted in a true sense  nice, hardworking parents who made a nice home for their children, who were polite, soft spoken and welcoming  none of the Italian American prejudice and stereotyping that you see in practically every part of the media  as criminals, low life Mafioso, etc. They even threw in the youngest sibling who was on the college track, which I thought was a nice touch.  Also, they depicted Irish Americans in the same light, not as just drunks and cops (though there is a mention of Irish cops). I thought this was a generally fair portrayal of two groups of Americans that don't always get a fair shake in the media.

But the main thing I haven't worked out is why Eillis selected Tony over Jim, who seemed better suited to her and for whom she seemed to have genuine feelings. But let me back up. Eillis met Tony when she was at the height of her loneliness and despair. She didn't seem bowled over by him or notice him before he noticed her. Tony also admits upon meeting Eillis that he really only likes Irish girls (though he doesn't go into details about why that is  which leaves the viewer to assume that it's solely about looks, which reveals a shallowness in him). When she meets him, she's a college girl, the only woman in a class of all men studying accounting. He's a plumber. At this point, the viewer is left feeling like she's with him because she's lonely as she just seems to be going with the flow filling up her time to help with that loneliness. That he's both handsome and sweet doesn't hurt either. When he invites her home to meet the family, she shows not an ounce of the nervousness any woman serious about a man would feel when meeting the parents of a man she has deep feelings for (for the first time, no less). It felt like she was going off to a friend's house for dinner. When he blurts out something very telling at dinner, her reaction is one of shock, not happiness. When he walks her home and tells her he loves her, she says goodnight and leaves him on the street. Later, she asks Sheila, one of the other boarders at the house, why she's not married and the response was essentially, ""my husband left me and I don't want to be in a boarding house forever, alone."" You can see that marriage or love (Tony or not) has never crossed Eillis's mind until Tony forces her to think about it. Sheila's little speech about being alone seems to make Eillis consider the possibility that being alone is a bad thing. This is not a surprise as all of the young ladies in the boarding house are fully focused on finding men to marry (it was the times they lived in, nothing more). When she next sees Tony, she tells him that she has thought about what he said and that ""maybe I feel the same way."" She never says, ""I love you.""  But she answers yes when he asks, ""You love me?"" and then immediately shuts him down from speaking of it further, like she's completely uncomfortable with the situation (she is). Tony, clearly sensing this note of insincerity and still insecure about her feelings toward him (rightly so), pressures her to marry him before she goes home to Ireland to deal with a family tragedy. She seems to resist until he insists and they head off to City Hall to seal the deal. When he takes her out to look at a parcel of land in Long Island that could be their future home, she is characteristically reluctant but agrees to that, too.

Back home in Ireland, the universe seems to be opening up for her. She gets a job, she meets Jim, a very sweet, successful and educated man whom she seems genuinely attracted to in a way she never seemed to be with Tony. With Jim, she's shyer, softer and more reserved, showing the nervousness a woman would feel who truly cares for a man. Jim is also more on her level, education-wise as well as culturally. In Ireland, she's around friends, her mother, she has her dream job as a bookkeeper (she's not fond of her sales job in Brooklyn) and a man with education and resources who genuinely cares for her and not just because she's Irish. Jim is a sweet and sensitive man. So is Tony, but Eillis never reacted to Tony the way she reacts to Jim. The fact that she's just ignoring Tony's letters and not writing back to him is very telling. Real love would not permit that. It's clear that she feels guilt and conflict but she seems to be settling into something at home that feels more right to her than her life in Brooklyn ever felt, even with Tony by her side. Eillis's marriage to Tony took place in City Hall, not in church, so it would probably not even be recognized by the Catholic Church in Ireland at the time. She could have easily moved on with her life in Ireland had it not been for her witchy ex-boss who reveals that she knows about Eillis's secret marriage to an Italian fellow in New York (through a customer whose niece ran into Eillis and Tony at the City Hall, just by chance). Eillis's hand is forced and she has to make a quick decision, which is to go back to Brooklyn and Tony to avoid the shame of being found out for her indiscretions in her home town. I honestly didn't feel like Eillis wanted to go back to New York but she went back because she had no choice. If she had truly loved Tony, she would have told her best friend and her mother that she was at least involved with a man in New York. She didn't have to say she was married to him. She would have written. Back in New York, Tony is concerned that his inability to write a letter without misspellings and grammatical errors is putting Eillis off and that's why she's not writing back. He enlists the help of his 8-year-old brother with grammar but it's clear that there's a much bigger problem. This emphasizes the divide between the them.

Back on the boat to New York, she seems unhappy and at a loss. In the end, her lies and her behavior have forced her from home, her true love, a job she loved and her aging mother, whom she left in Ireland all alone, with no one.

In the end, I have this nagging feeling that though she appears happy to see Tony again, her heart was elsewhere and that she ended as she began  with her life in New York but her heart across the ocean. That's my takeaway from this  that actions have consequences. Maybe that was the point of this but it's sad to think that her life could have been even more had she been able to choose what truly made her happy. When she says, at the end, that you'll find yourself thinking about something or someone with no connection to the past, it's sad to think about what had to be sacrificed because of youthful mistakes and dishonesty.

The emotion, turmoil, and experiences are so rich you can't help but feel a part of the story. At the end, all I wanted to do was see the story continue for about another two hours.

7584875,5,B019WMTX72,"Colm Toibin's novel ""Brooklyn"" was a very good book, and this movie, directed by John Crowley, does it justice.  The interest of the novel seems to me to be in the way that its protagonist, Eilis Lacey (played by Saoirse Ronan in the movie) negotiates two broadly different kinds of circumstances: those over which she has no control and those in which she can make decisions with something like freedom.  The dramatic interest lies in the fact that even where her control is limited, decisions have to be made, and Eilis accepts responsibility for her actions as her actions even when they might seem to us to have been forced on her. (Incidentally, the heroine of Toibin's later novel, ""Nora Webster,"" exhibits that same kind of moral courage).  Interestingly, Eilis doesn't analyse herself in these terms -- she just gets on with life, sometimes happily, sometimes less so, but never ""overthinking.""  Saoirse Ronan catches this quality of Eilis perfectly, so that even when she does or doesn't do things that we (the audience) see could lead to trouble, she never loses our sympathy, even though it's impossible to simply label her as a generic kind of dramatic character.

Eilis goes -- is sent? -- to Brooklyn from Ireland for economic reasons, and she adjusts and she learns and she takes advice, even as she makes her own decisions too, and it's possible to see her time in Brooklyn as her gradually becoming freer in both her personal and professional life.  Then a tragic event in her family requires her to return to Ireland for a time, and it's there that she comes under an older, more familiar, and almost more comfortable set of pressures that seem to work against the freedom she won in Brooklyn and even to pose a viable alternative to it.  The emotional dynamics of this part of movie -- as in the novel -- are subtle and they're wonderfully rendered -- though, at the end, there is the question of the extent to which Eilis's final action is chosen or forced.  Can we be sure that she would have acted otherwise than as she did?  Obviously, I'm being a bit vague here, in the interest of avoiding spoilers . . .  I would just add that the final scenes in Ireland are actually extended a bit beyond the novel's -- not to a degree that is out of keeping with the novel's vision but to a degree that gives more emotional weight to the final scenes.  Toibin himself reportedly loved the movie.

The acting is strong throughout -- Julie Walters and Jim Broadbent have substantive cameos that perhaps come closest to Irish stereotypes, and Emory Cohen and Domhnall Gleeson are fine as the men who interest Eilis, and the great Brid Brennan is a nasty piece of work as Miss Kelly.  The setting is the 1950s, and period detail in both Brooklyn and Enniscorthy is well realized.  The cinematography is unobtrusively effective.  Most of all, though, Saoirse Ronan carries the movie, as she must if it is to succeed.  It is the most impressive performance I've seen from her.",1471478400,,2982,4.673040152963671

7584898,4,B019WMTX72,"This film portrays the young adult life of Ellis Lacey, an Irish woman who emigrates to the US, specifically, Brooklyn.  The details of the trip, including an experienced woman who helps her through the ordeal, help the viewers to become acquainted with the setting of the early 1950s era. Ellis moves into a boarding house, finds work, learns new ways of life, and falls in love.  There are character developments, of course, both of Ellis and the people with whom she interacts.  Ellis' sister, whom she left behind in Ireland to care for their mother, dies, and Ellis travels back to Ireland.  There, she steps into her sister's job and also becomes romantically involved with a young man.  She faces the dilemma of returning to America or staying in Ireland.  Her decision becomes easy when a gossipy woman reveals information she has learned of Ellis from someone in Brooklyn.  Ellis realizes that the small town attitudes and platitudes are best left behind.

So when anything involving the Irish comes up, it immediately registers on our radar. Brooklyn is that rare film in which I can root unabashedly for the main character the entire way through. Saoirse Ronan is excellent in the lead role. I thoroughly enjoyed watching her character blossom and begin to discover her own voice, and to use that voice to ask for what she wants with more and more assertion as the film progresses.  Otherwise, nearly every supporting character is agreeable; no one is truly unlikable, save for one character who gets her due comeuppance, so even that is satisfactory in the end.

7584930,4,B019WMTX72,"A lot to like here. First, as much as the Hollywood product is maligned, as it should be, there are still those in that awful town who try to put out worthy, intelligent films, knowing full well even their best efforts are not going to translate into box office gold. This is such a film. It really does work on you as it gets on, the power of human drama. All due to a strong book, I'm assuming; a strong script (Nick Hornby, of all people), strong acting by all concerned, and good, subtle direction, or so it seems.

Some nitpicking: Ronan, and the director, seriously overplay the dour, homesick look for the first half of the film, I think, in fact was seriously thinking of hitting the eject button it was that overdone. You have a job working a counter at a high-end store -- grow up and do your job. (And the scene where she at last does do her job, very subtle, quite lovely.)

And two: the ship and crossing scenes. I think two needed long shots were needed, one of the boat about to sail -- those close-ups on the railings shots just don't cut it, and during the storm, same problem. You can't simply have the actors rocking back and forth like Sulu and Chekov on the bridge of the Enterprise, you need the establishing storm shot. Always works! Can't do without it!",1470700800,,1277,4.361344537815126

This movie, however, seemed to be a bastard child of the worst parts of Angela's Ashes and a bad version of Tess. Brooklyn's boring characters were just... boring. The entire movie was snail-paced and derivative, and left us feeling that we just wasted a couple of hours of our lives. We were thankful that we, like the passenger sitting next to the boring guy in Airplane!, didn't feel the need to hang ourselves to escape the narrative. Almost though.

7584962,5,B019WMTX72,"One of those brilliant, slow burning films that you can get lost in, and never want to end, Brooklyn never misses an opportunity to eschew big Hollywood confectionary bs, and just let the ordinary characters explore  their extraordianry humanity.  Moving from Ireland to New York, and back again, the movie is a profoundly moving paean to the generation before  the baby boomers, the one that raised us all. An aura of nostalgia, including the gauzy, washed out cinematography, pervades the film. The script is beautiful and the acting is great all around. Highly recommended.",1469750400,,576,5.1063829787234045
7584963,5,B019WMTX72,"Brooklyn is the setting for most of this sweet love story but it is an Irish story at heart. The heroine, Eilis, leaves a dead-end existence in her hometown of Enniscorthy in the early 1950s, to embark on a new life for herself in Brooklyn. She finds success in business and falls in love with an Italian-American plumber. When she is called home to  Ireland after her sister dies, she must re-evaluate her decision to leave; it is a painful choice and one that gives the viewer pause, as well. Saoirse Ronan is luminous in the role of Eilis, a delight to watch. I loved this movie!",1469750400,,582,4.4392523364485985

An innocent young lady from Ireland moves to NYC. She suffers, grows up, falls in love. Then she's called back to Ireland, and has serious choices to make. The movie is charming and done perfectly.

There is one love scene but although romantic and passionate, it didn't seem explicit. It probably isn't appropriate for young children. Otherwise it seemed fairly family friendly, while still offering substance for the adults insofar as having a wonderful story line, and being a visually appealing period drama.",1469232000,,643,5.056603773584905

Excellent acting and realistic for time period, we enjoyed watching this happily non-violent movie about a young female Irish immigrant, especially because immigration is such a difficult topic now.

7585042,3,B019WMTX72,"I love Saoirse Ronan.  I've rarely seen a movie she's in that I didn't like and it's hard to separate my admiration for her from the film.  That said, this wasn't one of her better movies, although, I enjoyed it and am glad I rented it.  The character, Hanna, starts off well enough and I appreciated how she kept things to herself and had her pride/dignity a trait most young women emulated but... she came off as cold, uncaring and distant, especially with her mother.  So, she's off to America, as many of our immigrant ancestors did, and her story is probably very much like many of our ancestors... torn from the home they knew and the family they loved.  The boarding house, the job, the friends and especially the romance with the Italian boy are all believable, sweet and engaging... enjoyed all the characters.

The problem with the story develops when she returns to Ireland.  First of all, she didn't seem close enough to her mother for me to believe she felt obligated to go back and care for her.  Once there I didn't see her caring for at all; instead, she gets a job and starts dating.  I, also, understand how an innocent meeting can turn into a romance if everyone is encouraging you and setting the stage for you -- and you're far from HOME.  They say you can never go back and maybe that was the point... home for her was in America now.  Still the film lacked to show me how Hanna became so sensitive to the small town gossiping of her native Ireland -- I only saw one mean spirited woman with too many opinions -- hardly enough to make a young woman want to leave everything she knows and move to another country... imho, they should have shown the impact of not finding employment and the very real hardships that drove people to America.  But, no, the film has them going to dances and not finding any boys that meet their fancy.

Because the relationship with the town and her mother were never significant enough for me, her decision at the end seemed overly dramatic... I'm glad she came to her senses and went back to America but the emotion wasn't very believable... she loved her mother so much she had to go back to care for her only to abruptly leave when someone pisses her off... maybe Saoirse just plays more complicated characters or sociopaths better than sensitive yet, up-tight young women... or the director was seeing and feeling something that didn't translate to the rest of us... well, me.

Still worth seeing just no need to write home about it..",1468713600,,2490,4.5167037861915365

7585095,5,B019WMTX72,"These days, being human seems to mean the crudest, most heartless things.  If that's been depressing you, there's no better remedy than watching ""Brooklyn.""  Yes, there's a wonderful depiction of a sweet young woman's immigration to the U.S. and the downs . . . and then gradually the ups . . . which come with it.

There are also wonderful depictions of the various characters Eilis meets along the way.  Like everyone else I was amused by her Irish-American landlady.  But I particularly loved Eilis' supervisor at the department store, who seemed at first to be cold as ice, but soon showed her true colors as a very caring, and witty, young woman.

Above all, though, there was the relationship between Eilis and her Italian-American boyfriend Tony.  I watched incredulously as he actually treated the girl he was attracted to with respect and tenderness.  And whenever, at the beginning of their relationship, he wanted to get physical with her, he didn't even kiss her--he embraced her.  How did this movie ever get made in our instant gratification culture?

If you're cynical about what men and women (and also men and men, and women and women) *really* want from each other, despite what they say, you'll yawn over Eilis and Tony.  But if you always felt we could connect with a partner--were even built to connect with a partner--in loving, lovely ways, Eilis and Tony are like taking a super-vitamin shot when you're running on empty.

As for those relatively few negative reviewers who said basically the same thing about ""Brooklyn""--too slow, too boring, nothing happens--I'll pass on one of my own experiences.

Back in the '60's, I had my first job right out of high school as an office boy on Madison Avenue.  One day I decided to read Virginia Woolf for the first time, and a friend recommended ""Orlando.""  (This was long before a movie was made of that book.)  I bought the book and found it one of the most boring, trudging books I'd ever read.  ""Get on with it!"" I shouted to the book, ""pick up the pace!""--as I read snatches of it on the subway and during my work breaks in an office where everything had to happen in a New York minute.

Finally I put the book away.  The following winter I caught the flu and had nothing to do but lie in bed.  I picked up ""Orlando"" out of desperation--and gasped.  The writing was absolutely beautiful.  Every sentence was a jewel.

My point to the negative reviewers: instead of critiquing the slowness of ""Brooklyn,"" perhaps your own pace of life might be a little too fast?  In other words, don't bring your own pace to a movie or book or play and fault that work for not keeping up with you.  It's unfair--plus you might miss out on something really gorgeous.  I know I almost did with ""Orlando.""

""Brooklyn"" is a beautiful, great movie with a lot of depth.  Don't miss it.",1468195200,,2833,4.634538152610442

The movie itself is pretty good. It's about a young Irish woman, Eilis, whose sister arranges for her to move to Brooklyn to get a job and go to school. The first part of the movie shows Eilis's struggle with homesickness. She is surrounded by opportunity in a new country, but all she can think of is her mother and sister back in Ireland. I thought the way they captured those feelings was perfect! It's such a relief to watch her slowly get over that homesickness as she starts to throw herself into her new American life.

I had this movie on my wish list for a while, but I waited to buy it until the price dropped to $11.99, because I have a hard time convincing myself to buy movies for full price.

7585140,1,B019WMTX72,"This movie was praised to the sky and a friend of mine convinced me to watch it, claiming I would love it. As you can see from the rating I gave it, she was wrong.  I admit the acting is superb, the filming spectacular, the costumes are in legitimate 50s style, but the plot is so bizarre.

This story is about an Irish immigrant girl in the 50s who moves to Brooklyn at the urging of her sister. She is homesick for a while but gets over it because she gets a boyfriend. I like the character of Tony, but his little bother was infinitely more entertaining. And Eilis's story in Brooklyn is a very romanticized (pun intended) portrayal of immigration in the 50s. A person whose only problems were seasickness and homesickness?  Um, no.
Eilis also suffers from lack of character development and personality. When Eilis does show some kind of personality it is either deceptive (this really shows on her return to Ireland) or mean. Other than that she is just...there; the heroine? of a bland story.  On top of that, I freely admit to hating love triangles, which is a term for character development cop out, and this film had the oddest 'love triangle' of all time.

When her sister dies Eilis returns to Ireland and, despite having married her boyfriend before she left, she dates a man in Ireland, ignores letters her husband sends her, and acts like she will be staying in there.  There is never a reason given for the fact she fails to tell anyone in Ireland, not even her mother, that she's married to a man in Brooklyn.  When someone finds out and Eilis is called out on the fact that she is married, she reacts with righteous indignation, as if she had done nothing wrong by keeping her marriage a secret and living a lie. Her mother is heartbroken at the news, as she had been hoping her only living child would stay in Ireland with her, and argues with her daughter. But I guess we're not supposed to care about the mother, only what Eilis wants. And there is no real conclusion to this odd story.  It repeats some worn out storytelling cliches as Eilis takes a boat back to the US of A and then she's suddenly back in Brooklyn, hugging the husband whose letters she had ignored for no reason for a month, and there the story ends. Not that I had any objection to that.",1467504000,8,2277,4.430622009569378

7585349,4,B019WMTX72,"Ever experience homesickness? How about when you move overseas to live in an entirely different country of unfamiliar culture? What if you had to leave your sweetheart? What if you find some other love in your new home?

Virtually anybody can relate to the complex inner journey of Eilis Lacey, a 1952 immigrant from Ireland. Director John Crowley does miss several crucial details in the crafting of this young womans journey to self-fulfillment, but he still succeeds in creating a tender and warm perspective on the life of communist-era immigration in Brooklyn.

If anything lifts Crowleys feel-good enlightener off its feet, its the leading female Saoirse Ronan (Atonement, The Lovely Bones). Ronan is simply impossible to not love: her Irish accent sounds as petite and pleasant as her charm, and her gentle vulnerability generates an immediate rare bond between audience and character. Saoirse Roman focuses less on being an exceptional actress, and more on playing the role honestly and openly. She is a defining triumph on screen, and always looks stunning with her blue eyes and red lips that pop against her soft, pale skin tone.

The same cant be said about Eilis two love interests, who each has as much depth as any little girls prince charming to the likes of Disneys Snow White or Cinderella. While careful investment went into the development of Eilis emotional arc, the men are treated by the director and writers only as plot devices, a direct role reversal of the way women are portrayed in summer blockbusters. I would have liked to see how male characters with greater personality would have put Eilis decision at higher stake.

The screenplay adapted from Colm Tibns novel by Nick Hornby (An Education, Wild) also has its share of missing details. While addressed right from the beginning that Eilis is a young Catholic woman born and raised in Ireland, any exploration of her life in Ireland cannot be found. Rather, she just tells her boss within the first three minutes about her move to America. Next we know, she gets hurled and tossed by a miserable ship ride of seasickness and eats nightly dinners with other immigrated Irish women at a boarding house in Brooklyn. Then she talks about her homesickness, even though we never know what it was about her home she feels sick for.

At least the momentum picks up after she meets an Italian boy named Tony at an Irish dance. What follows are many of the usual first date antics which anybody whos dated before will instantly pick up on. She has to be taught the proper way to eat spaghetti so she won't embarrass herself in front of Tonys family. She must consistently remind him how little she cares about the Dodgers. She vents to him about how much colder New York is than Ireland. To top things off, she gets caught in what to say to him when he tells her, I love you.

The two eventually make a decision to get married, followed by the most out of place scene in the entire picture: a rough and steamy premarital sex scene. Im sorry but onscreen sex is just so immaturely typical for a romantic drama, and it kills the innocence this film once carried. Could we for once hear about a romance left undamaged by the dangers of sex outside of marriage?

Anyways, after no showing of any wedding or boat ride, she just confusingly pops back into Ireland where she falls in love all over again with another man, in spite of being secretly married to a man in New York. Will she return to New York or stay in Ireland? Where does her love rest?

Maybe I would have felt her decision more deeply if I knew anything at all about what the Brooklyn culture in 1952 felt like. I know I already bashed the lack of detail on the Irish culture or the two men, but even Jon Favreaus Elf captured the feel of the Big Apples culture better.

But regardless of the missed opportunities, Brooklyn miraculously manages to make you feel fully satisfied in the end, possibly thanks to the brilliant ways Crowley captures Eilis homesickness. Maybe its a heartfelt Irish folk song sung at an immigrants luncheon, maybe its the soft, balanced glow of Yves Blangers (Dallas Buyers Club, Wild) cinematography, but Crowley knew right from his first reading of the screenplays first draft where the emotional core needed to be.

As you may probably figure, Brooklyn is no date movieyet anyone should go on ahead and check out Brooklyn. It appropriately humanizes historys immigrants, revealing their true inner journeys after the effects of WWII, as told through the relatable tale of a love triangle across the Atlantic. There, through Americas history with the world, is where our greatest stories come from.

If anything, its simple decency and goodness worked against it--I, too, resisted the film a bit at first because it sound like it could be one of those cloyingly sentimental movies that are much too earnest for their own good.  But in the case of Brooklyn, it just ain't so.  For one thing, the protagonist makes choices for her own well-being that hurt others.  And the nasty old judgmental shopkeeper back in Ireland is a hoot, as is the landlady of the boarding house in Brooklyn.

7586017,4,B019WMTX72,"Saoirse Ronan is one of those very few young actor and actress can grasp different roles thoroughly, you don't see unnecessary acting through her portraits of different roles and characters among her movies in the past. In my personal opinion, this is not her best movie or should I say the way story put into the film does not give Saoirse Ronan way too much space to develop her character more deeply, cannot blame her for the fair and plain storyline. If they remake ""War and Remembrance"" mini movie series, she is very fit in that type of movies. So far, I would say ""Byzantium"" and
""The Way Back"" are her best performances, which are very, very good.

Little Ronan is growing up, her acting career is growing better and better as in fact it is right now; she is really underrated, it is unfair to see that happen not only to her but also to some other young fellows into the acting career and good at it but still struggling...
As a fan( I am not easily fan of anybody), I will watch her movies does not matter it sales or not because she is indeed good enough to gain my attention for I am a fan enjoys good movies with good actor and actresses in them.",1464825600,,1159,4.31651376146789

7586022,5,B019WMTX72,"Although the film's plot is fairly predictable, it does not decrease the film's sentimentality and feel-good feelings.  Centered around one Irish's woman's struggle for independence as a 1950's immigrant in America, the film highlights the Irish woman's  inner battle for fulfilling her personal wants versus fulfilling her family obligations as a daughter and sister. The movie starts with a scared, young, unaccompanied, Irish female immigrant traveling to America.  Then, the movie shows her growth as an American working woman seeking an accounting degree, better employment, and a successful relationship.  The Irish woman's inner conflict begins when she temporarily leaves her loving, supportive American husband and promising, new accounting position to take care of her sick, needy mother in Ireland. After crossing the Atlantic Ocean, the Irish woman dutifully performs her role as her mother's caregiver.  During her stay, the movie juxtaposes her future life in America against her future possibilities in Ireland.  The married woman is intrigued by the romantic advancements from a handsome, wealthy Irishman. As she imagines her life as the wife of a rich Irish husband, she is offered a challenging accounting position.  Now she must decide between the two countries' offerings. Which will she take?",1464825600,3,1314,5.57286432160804

I caught myself wondering why there was no mention of the war, but ""As Irish-American historian and novelist Peter Quinn explains, The country wasn't in the Second World War, it had been kind of cut off from the rest of the world, and it wasn't part of the Marshall Plan. So it was still a very rural country. The economy was at a standstill, while the U.S. was booming. Some 50,000 immigrants left Ireland for America in the 50s, about a quarter of them settling in New York."" Understanding that many of the immigrants were women makes Eilis' story very real.

7586488,5,B019WMTX72,"Brooklyn tells us the story of Eilis Lacey, a young Irish woman that moves to the United States in search for a better future that her hometown can't give her. Torn between her hometown and Brooklyn, her new home, we see life through Eilis' life and her evolution as an unexperienced girl, to a strong young woman, and why not? Love is also found between that big change.
Based upon Colm Toibin's novel, Brooklyn is one of the weird cases when the movie is better than the book, staying true to the original source, but correcting major flaws and providing changes that are for good. Since the movie begins, Saoirse Ronan delivers an Oscar-worthy performance, portraying the emotions of the lead character flawlessly. I wish she would have won that Academy Award, but in my heart she did. The whole vibe of the movie is perfect as well; from the costumes, to the music and cinematography, Brooklyn is a delicious film that inspires and it's without a doubt one of the best movies of 2015 that should have gotten more Awards!",1464048000,3,1024,4.662983425414365

7586515,2,B019WMTX72,"My wife is Irish, and we've been back there many times. Also, our son used to live in Brooklyn, and I can't say this movie captured the spirit of either place. What a far-fetched plot! None of the characters are properly developed, there is virtually nothing that would make me ever want to see this film again. The DVD cover trumpets""the year's best love story""! That's a laugh. All those glowing reviews I read must be from people who don't go to the movies very often. The only thing that had any semblance of reality was that the Irish accents were authentic. Probably because the actors were Irish. All in all, I'd say to anyone that if you loved this movie, then I've got a bridge I wanna sell you. Know which one??",1463702400,5,721,4.428571428571429
7586516,4,B019WMTX72,"""Brooklyn,"" is a sweet coming of age tale of homesickness, new love, and loss. I wouldn't say it was a tear-jerker, but you do feel the emotion in the movie. I liked the actors, but they seemed to be lacking some in chemistry--but then again, it wasn't a head-over-heels kind of love, so maybe that was intentional. I enjoyed and would recommend ""Brooklyn.""",1463702400,,357,4.682539682539683

This movie is a simple tale about family, love, compassion, tragedy, and all thing people actually live through. To top it off, the movie is populated with good characters with heart. No backstabbing, conniving, nor misbehaving cretens that fill so many movies these days. You feel good and clean during and after watching this movie - what a surprise. Of course, people whose attention span is measured by minutes between big bangs will absolutely hate this movie. Really this movie should be used as a test for one's humanity and IQ. Unfortunately, at least half the people will probably flunk the exam.",1463616000,,728,4.879032258064516

7586526,4,B019WMTX72,"On the one hand the underlying conflicts in the story might be predictable, but they end up being a bit of a surprise anyway.  Like a good book is a good read, this is a good watch.  And a relief from all the over the top synthetic action in so much of what Hollywood has been producing lately.

7586530,5,B019WMTX72,"Brooklyn is a pretty good chic flick taking place in Ireland and New York post WW2.  I am a sucker for older films like this and Gangs of New York, Far and Away etc.  Period piece dramas that have intriguing central stories of Americas past that keep you interested in the movie and glued to the screen.  I love how the movie seems to come full circle from where it started.  We get to see Eilis as a shy and reserved young woman early in the film and confident and worldly by the end of the movie.  Saoirse Ronan has beautiful eyes and in many scenes you can watch her thoughts moving in her head just by her stare and facial expressions.

This is one of those movies that is like the American dream itself, an immigrant passing through customs into the new world looking for a better future.  But on the same token this movie also brings back the good things that Eilis had in Ireland that she didn't realize until she came home.  A good high paying accounting job she wanted, clear beaches without crowds, seeing her old best friend, companionship.

The choice she made was not an easy one to walk away from.  The roommate scenes in the boarding house are all very well done and believable.  The film itself seemed very realistic and refreshing.  I liked how Father Flood in the film is really trying to do what is best for his community.  Tonys character is a little cliqued at times but he comes across as genuine and caring.

Overall I would rate this a 5 star film but it is definitely not for everyone, it is a slow moving and not a film you can miss lots of parts of and expect to grasp the full story.",1463356800,,1611,4.291390728476821

I had never heard of it, but after watching it on-line, I bought and DVD to give to my daughter, and she shared it with the rest of her family on their own personal movie night. Th consensus? Everybody loved it! It is a wonderful story that is well acted and well told.

7586582,5,B019WMTX72,Being Brooklyn born and just old enough to be aware of the fact that we were Irish American the sounds of Irish brogues permeated my neighborhood . The dis  and dat of this very simple wonderful story of a new life in a new land wonderfully acted by a totally believable cast notably the amazing Saoirse Ronan along with the brilliant support of Julie Walters and Jim Broadbent make this a film that certainly could  mirror the stories of thousands of Irish woman in that time period in New York  and  Boston. Colm Toibins novel is brought wonderfully to life the look feel and sounds of Brooklyn  and all its blue collar working class glory and the constant struggle of the cultures that no doubt still tug against each and every generation of  immigrants everywhere.,1462838400,3,768,4.651851851851852

problems:
1. Why did they cheapen it by having her sleep with a man she wasn't married to?  That scene was completely unnecessary.
2. If she and her future husband were both practicing Catholics, they would have gotten married in the Church - they'd have known legal ceremonies are not licit.
3. What in the world was she doing when she went back to Dublin??!?!?!?  Her behavior made no sense at all.  I wanted to shake some sense into her!

Go see it if you like a movie that is simply a great story -- no explosions, no major foul language, no explicit sex scenes so if you want that, this is not your movie...just a great story and great acting!",1462752000,,605,4.17948717948718

This reminded me of a movie from the '80's ""Crossing Delancey Street"" which also told the story of immigrants to the ethnic neighborhoods of New York. My ancestors lived in Brooklyn, New York in the early 1900's and owned a ""dry goods"" store. The acting in""Brooklyn"" was so natural - I loved the actress' honesty and truthful portrayal of a naive young immigrant girl making her way in the late 1940's in America. There were a few false notes, but I only noticed them because my mom was a young college girl in that time period and described her experiences in that same time frame.

Eilis is staying at a boarding house (dormitory) with prim and proper roommates. Acting as her tutor, she is taught etiquette and pizazz that put her on par with them. She takes to it easily. At Brooklyn College, she is studying to become an accountant, and she flourishes there. The Friday night dances are the highlight of the week as in a Jane Austen novel. She develops an intimate relationship with Tony Fiorello, her direct opposite. He's blue collar (a plumber), Italian, and not her intellectual equal. He looks up to her and respects her, and that is what's important to Eilis. After the sudden loss of her sister, Eilis returns home to Ireland to grieve with her mother. In this small, close-knit town, everyone knows everyone else, and they band together to do everything in their power to dissuade Eilis from leaving, a second time. She is introduced to and begins dating Jim Farell, ""a catch for someone"" her mother states. In addition, she is offered and accepts an accounting job at a local company. A stack of unopened, unanswered letters from Tony accumulate in her dresser drawer. The question becomes - will she stay in Ireland or return to Brooklyn?

7586668,4,B019WMTX72,"Eilis (Saoirse Ronan) is a young woman working part time at a grocer's store in a small Irish town. She doesn't have many prospects so her sister has arranged with an Irish priest in America for passage  to the New World. Eilis is excited but worried. It's 1951, so she still has to take an ocean voyage. The trip is rough because of the weather and the inconsiderate people who share her cabin's bathroom. Her roommate helps with the situation and gives Eilis a lot of good advice to get through customs and immigration. Eilis is soon settled in a boarding house with four other young Irish women and a job at a local department store. She is very homesick and shy, so the priest, Father Flood (Jim Broadbent), gives her some more help--he has her signed up for night classes in accounting. She goes to the church's weekly dance where she meets a nice young man, Tony, who is Italian. Her homesickness melts away as she becomes more comfortable with her new home. She faces more problems when a tragedy happens back in Ireland.

The movie is very sweet and charming. While the romance is the central element of the story, the movie also gives an interesting look at the immigrant experience. Saoirse Ronan gives a great performance as Eilis, a very likable if not perfect character. Her challenges are interesting and compelling. The story is very satisfying dramatically as well as romantically.",1461801600,,1397,4.721311475409836

This is Hollywood's equivalent to elevator music. Yes, these movies are enjoyable to watch but a bit to thin to command the price of a Blu-Ray package.

If many men are guilty of falling for mindless, hyper-violent ""guy films,"" then can't women also admit to crass self-indulgence when they patronize and approve of such films as ""Brooklyn,"" a veritable ""chick flick"" if there ever was one? Apparently the critics have also fallen for this empty vessel of a film masquerading as an art house triumph. Call me a curmudgeon but the best thing that can be said about Brooklyn is that it's a beautiful Hallmark Greeting card!

Brooklyn begins in post-World War II Ireland and stars the very attractive Saoirse Ronan as Eilis Lacey, a young woman who decides to make a new life for herself in the United States. Note that good melodramas have good villains but the best Brooklyn can muster is Miss Kelly, the vindictive shopkeeper who later proves to be a significant stumbling block in Eilis' herculean effort to resolve a tough refrain of ""torn between two lovers.""

Aside from Miss Kelly (who has scant screen time for the main antagonist), most of the other characters Eilis encounters on her journey from Ireland to New York and back, are of the goody two- shoes variety. There is of course her long-suffering mother and sister, a kindly priest who arranges for her passage to New York, a sympathetic fellow female traveler who's already been to the US who helps Eilis with an embarrassing bout of seasickness on the passage over, not to mention the sage advice she imparts on how to ""act like an American"" upon arrival.

Once Eilis is firmly ensconced at the Irish Boarding house in Brooklyn, she's taken under her wing by the an overbearing landlady, Madge Kehoe, who implies that the other young women staying there are guilty of shameless moral turpitude. We don't learn that much about Eilis' fellow boarders but her boss at her new job initially appears to have some potential as a bitchy martinetonly to morph into a bland do-gooder just as soon as Eilis is called back to Ireland following a family tragedy.

After about a good half hour, when you've already expected the proceedings to have broken into Act II, Eilis finally takes a substantial step into her new world by meeting Beau #1, the ever so perfect ""Tony,"" who is confident that Irish lass Eilis will fit in quite nicely with his cute and perfect Italian family. It soon becomes quite apparent that screenwriter Nick Hornby knows little about Italian-Americans in general so all we learn about Tony is that he loves the Brooklyn Dodgers and works as a plumber (oh yes, he's a wonderful guy to boot!). Meanwhile Eilis's chums back at the boarding house are determined to show Eilis how to fit in with her potential in-laws by teaching her how to twirl spaghetti at the dinner table! There's also Tony's precocious little brother who manages to talk like an adult and hardly like a kid growing up in the early 50s.

Brooklyn is designed to manipulate your emotions at every turn so just imagine if director John Crowley didn't have a maudlin string section to intrude whenever significant plot points reach their fever pitch. The strings are particularly ubiquitous when Eilis returns to Ireland following the death of her sister.

The lack of character development is also heavily apparent when it comes to Beau #2, Jim Farrell. He's basically the Irish version of Tony, another wonderful ""nice guy"" who eventually learns that slicked back hair is not the way to ""get the girl."" Oh yes, he also will be inheriting his parents' house when they move to the country (proving that he's obvious good ""marriage material"").

Finally we arrive at the moment which explains why Brooklyn's antagonist, the meddling Miss Kelly, is only a minor presence in the narrative. The primary antagonist is part of Eilis's internal arc, not external. Poor Eilis cannot choose between Tony and the new world and her homesickness, which also means a new bookkeeping job in Ireland as well as potential nuptials with Jim. The previously alluded to ""torn between two lovers"" refrain is precisely what fires the passions of all those women (and their male enablers) who fall for such rampant sentiment. For them, Eilis' internal conflict is understandableeven natural, and is proof of her nobility. For me it only underscores Eilis' fickleness and lack of strength of character (and this is perhaps where men and women differ: women see the influence of Eilis' homesickness and attraction for home-bred Jim as emotionally understandable and excusable; men see the broken vow to Tony (after she marries him back in New York), as irrational!

If Brooklyn gets anything right, it's in the excellent production design, which undoubtedly awakens nostalgia for the good old days of the late 40s and early 50s. I like how Brooklyn Heights has been transformed into ""halcyon days"" replete with those long forgotten street signs and various vehicles of that era, not to mention the fabulous women's dresses and bathing suits (most honorable mention goes to Ms. Ronan's fabulous yellow dress).

Brooklyn's acting ensemble (and notably Ms. Ronan in the lead role) perform well despite the simplistic script. Mr. Hornby can do little in fleshing out his characters but occasionally provides a few twists and turns in the plot (the foreshadowing where Eilis runs into a fellow Irish denizen at the municipal court before she gets married, nicely sets up Miss Kelly's extortion plot, forcing Eilis to admit she was already married in America and subsequently is forced to return!).

As a self-confessed, semi-curmudgeon, Brooklyn is precisely the type of film that immediately gets up my (critical) gander. Let me be clear that I don't dislike every chick flick that's out therecertainly there are certain romantic comedies that have no trouble passing muster. But when a chick flick such as this dips into the realm of the bathetic, all bets are off.",1461715200,12,5868,4.9351570415400206

7586708,4,B019WMTX72,"In structure, this is an old-fashioned boy and girl from different worlds meet and fall in love with the question being whether they will make their relationship work.  The actors make this simple story work by being believable in every scene together.  Saoirise Ronan's Oscar-nominated performance is a touching portrayal of a young woman forced, as so many were and still are, to leave their homes and emigrate to a distant land.  When circumstances give her an opportunity to return to her native land, she has a life-altering choice to make.  Where this movie really shines is in the moments it illuminates that immigrant experience.  I do not want to spoil a first-time viewer's enjoyment of this movie by describing those scenes.  The Blu-ray renders a vivid presentation of the film's wonderful cinematography.  I highly recommend Brooklyn to anyone who enjoys a movie that explores the ability of the human heart to endure and find life.",1461456000,,945,5.019230769230769

Because of an empathetic boss and a caring priest, she ends up going to night classes and is able to leave her job at the department store.  She also meets a young Italian man and falls in love.  There are more trial and tribulations to come before the story ends.  I didn't know anyone in the cast but the acting was genuine and believable.

7586810,4,B019WMTX72,"BROOKLYN is rather innocuous as period dramas go, but also suffers a little bit for its dogged adherence to convention. The story is about Ellis (pronounced 'Ay-lish,' and played with aplomb by Saoirse Ronan), a young Irish woman who travels to America for better job opportunities. While there she meets a handsome Italian man. However, trouble back in the home country prompts her to go back, and she finds herself torn between two homes (and two men). While I didn't find myself completely engaged on a story level, BROOKLYN has much to offer in terms of acting talent and production values. This was Saoirse Ronan's movie through and through, and she carried it with a calculated assuredness beyond her years. She's also not terrible to look at either, and her eyes do a lot to keep you on her side, even while making some (retrospectively) poor decisions. The other elements I thought worked rather well were some excellent soundtrack choices and economical camerawork which lent the film the intimacy required for a small-scale drama. Perhaps those choices made it less cinematic than it could have been, but I'll take unpretentious over its opposite any day. There was also a warmth and vibrancy to the overall visual style which contributed to a nostalgic feel that I enjoyed, at least on that level. What isn't as forgivable is how straight the narrative and themes are developed in terms of the time period it depicted. I don't think that everything has to be approached in a ""wink, wink"" post-modern fashion, but it is possible to create characters and situations that fit a certain historical period while also acknowledging modern social ideas. But in BROOKLYN's world, the pinnacle of a woman's life is finding that right man to settle down with, and part of the plot hinges on this very outdated notion. Some concessions are made in terms of Ellis' career goals, but she sticks out like a sore thumb compared to all of the other female characters around her. I won't give away any spoilers, but I can say that convention is the name of the game here. The filmmakers succeeded in making a film that is easy to watch, enjoyable even, but ultimately a hollow, unchallenging experience. It's ""feel-good"" entertainment in a lot of ways, but little of the emotion that came through felt earned. I liked the film overall, and there are many other people who probably will as well, but it could have been more than what was presented. (3.5/5)",1461196800,,2449,4.833333333333333

7586849,4,B019WMTX72,"I agree with the comments of other reviewers who stated that 1. It is primarily a love story made for the female moviegoer, and 2. while the film took place in the 1950's, there were few details to keep it from happening anywhere from the 1920's to the 1950's. The Ellis Island immigration processing lines were right out of Godfather 2 and the third class accommodations on the ship from Ireland to America were right out of Titanic. Only the 1950's automobiles in Brooklyn obviously gave away the actual era.

After watching the movie something rather profound struck me. In an era where most male protagonists seen in films are imperfect at best, the 2 male leads in this film were really nice guys who loved her and wanted only the best for her. Having long since been conditioned by cynical, contemporary cinematic mores and values, I kept waiting for the dark side of one or the other to rear its ugly head in the form of abusive language or actual physical abuse. This never happened. One won and the other lost but they were both worthy of her, and in the end, she (eventually) made the right decision.",1460937600,2,1110,4.577889447236181

7586853,3,B019WMTX72,"Although I will say this wasn't quite my type of movie, it is a cute and sweet story that probably is more for a female audience than for me necessarily.  The movie for me was quite slow but to be fair it is that type of movie.  The story is pretty decent though with the struggles of being an immigrant to the US and a sweet love story combine with the conflict of the heart and home sickness caused by the separation of being away from family and friends.  It is a very gracefully filmed piece with an elegant feel to it and a nice subtle message of home being where your heart is.  Saoirse Ronan does a nice job in her role of the young innocent girl who transforms herself in her journey into the unknown and her heart.  It is definitely watchable and I can see this easily being rated higher by those who like chick flicks more than I do.  Even though this is not my favorite style of movie and a bit slow for me, I did find that the story is worth watching and enjoyable.

7586880,5,B019WMTX72,"I rarely write movie reviews but this little gem was so well acted and directed that I felt compelled to do so.  Eilis (pronounced Ay-lish) Lacey is a young woman with little prospects in her native Ireland so her older sister secures, with the help of a priest, a position for her as a shopgirl in America.  Ellis is heartbroken to leave her family but necessity forces her to leave home for the hustle and bustle of New York.  She is able to continue her studies at nights and on weekends goes to the dance hall to socialize.

The beauty of this movie is in its simple storyline.  One might think that a new immigrant tolling along in America is just one of many, yet here it is taken with such care that you can compare it to a blooming flower---soft and fragile, giving up its secrets as it opens up.  This isn't pushed.  It happens on its own terms, leading you along until the very end.  You realize that you are holding your breath all along, expecting heartbreak or indescribable joy.  I can only credit this to the outstanding talent of director John Crowley and the heartrending performances of Saoirse Ronan, as Eilis, and newcomer Emory Cohen, as Tony.  Cohen's work in this film is so good, in fact, that he has been lauded as a young Marlon Brando or Johnny Depp.  This is the perfect romantic movie to watch with your special someone.  It takes your breath away.",1460419200,9,1377,4.464

7586889,5,B019WMTX72,I don't write movie reviews very often but this one was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. So many heartfelt feelings like Saoirse Ronan's character on the ship leaving Ireland and the terribly sad looks on the faces of the families whose children were emigrating. For many it was the realization that they might never see their children again. And the scene in the church kitchen in Brooklyn where the old Irish workers were being fed Christmas dinner. If that scene in which the old singer got up and sang the song in Gaelic didn't bring some tears to your eyes I don't know what will. The whole terrible experience of Ireland's history was bound up in that scene.,1460246400,5,682,4.464

7586894,3,B019WMTX72,"As movies about Ireland and the Irish go, this was not my favorite by a long shot.  There is usually a lot of humor and wit in Irish stories, and this had little of that.  I vastly prefer the likes of Waking Ned Devine, about a guy in Ireland who wins the lottery posthumously.  Another good one was The Matchmaker, about a young American woman in Ireland. A more recent good one was Leap Year.  Far and Away was a film about an Irish couple who immigrate to the US.  While it covered their trials and travails, it was not nearly so dreary as this film was most of the time.  I was very disappointed, as this film was nominated for some awards, and my expectations were high.  Also, there are Italian characters in the film, but not one Italian actor.

The film encompasses the immigrant experience. While it is never implied that the move is intended to be permanent, the young girl struggles with homesickness and longing while trying to fit in with fellow immigrants from Ireland and the melting pot that NYC is. It reflects quaint charm on both sides of the Atlantic as well as some harsh realities. It is sadly obvious why the girl needs to leave Ireland. An unexpected twist of fate necessitates a trip back to Ireland. The timing isn't the greatest. The girl has changed and now has a very different life and Brooklyn is now home. Lots of twists and turns takes a predictable plot into something far more. You think you know where this is going, but I am guessing you won't because the writing is so cleverly done. The photography and the perspective of mid-century America sucked me in, but the actors were so good that it was easy to forget this was a movie. Loved this one.",1459987200,6,1156,4.4575471698113205

7586913,5,B019WMTX72,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Lately it seems that the word immigrant has taken on a whole new meaning. Politicians from both sides of the aisle seem determined to either demonize immigrants or cast them into sainthood. The reality is that immigrants made this country what it is today. And for those politicians perhaps they should consider that it wasn't all immigrants but legal immigrants that helped form this melting pot. So what better time to release a film about an Irish immigrant who comes to America and finds love?

BROOKLYN is just that, a sort of throwback to those romantic films of the past fueled by romance, love and affection rather than simple lusts and hookups. Saoirse Ronan stars as Eilis Lacey, a young woman who leaves behind her mother and sister in Ireland with the hope of creating a better life for herself in the United States. Sponsored by a local priest Eilis sets sail for America with no idea of what to expect. Fortunately she ends up bunking with a young woman who has been through the ropes already.

Upon arrival Eilis takes up residence at a boarding house the priest set her up in Brooklyn, watched over by matriarchal Mrs. Keogh (Julie Walters). She and withdrawn, Eilis gets to know the other girls living there as well as the rules Mrs. Keogh establishes. In order to take care of herself the priest has also arranged a job for Eilis in a big department store. At first she finds this job difficult because of her shyness as well as a serious bout of homesickness. All of that changes when she meets Tony (Emory Cohen).

Tony is a plumber who comes from a large Italian family. Although both come from different backgrounds the attraction is mutual and soon they are as serious a couple as can be found. Eilis meets Tonys family and they are taken with her. The movie does a great job of showing their love developing rather than have things move at light speed. You believe in the affection that bonds the two of them together.

But thing change suddenly and Eilis is called back to Ireland. With plans of this being a short visit things alter those plans along with more than a few nudges from her mother. As the visit lengthen Eilis finds herself attracted to a young man in her home town named Jim (Domhnall Gleason). Eilis carries secrets with her tear at her, as she must come to terms with decisions made in the past and to be made. Just what decision she will make will affect not just her life but the lives of those around her.

The movie is entertaining from start to finish. Not once does this movie become one where you find yourself staring at the clock, checking to see how much longer the movie is or grabbing the remote to fast forward. It engages you as a viewer and holds you captivated by the story of a young woman who not only discovers love but does so with two different men. How she comes to the decision she does by the end of the film is a satisfying conclusion to a movie that not only keeps you watching but makes you consider the lives of so many who came to this country all those years ago.

While every performance involved in this film is superb it is that lead role of Eilis as performed by Saoirse Ronan that holds the movie together. Not once do you think this is an actress in a role. She captures the very essence of Eilis from early on in the film until its end. At only 21 years of age she has already rung up a number of outstanding performances in several films. She may have lost the Oscar this past year for this performance but I would be willing to bet the elusive award will find its way into her hands eventually.

The movie is one of the best nights Ive had in some time watching films to write about. As I said earlier I never once found myself looking for something else to do or somewhere else to be. I was too caught up in the story of this young woman in search of something better. My guess is that you will be as well. This one is not just a movie that youll watch and forget, but one that you might want to add to your shelf.",1459814400,,4053,4.3589403973509935

Saoirsa Ronan was brilliant. Her face expressions, her tears, her happiness and her Irish heritage showed so beautifully in this film. Julie Walters, as usual delivers an unforgettable character. But my absolute favorite was Emory Cohen. His boyish, innocent, real and sincere character stole the show in my personal opinion. He made you fall in love with him.

Eilis Lacey [Saoirse Ronan] moves from small town Ireland to Brooklyn, where she has the opportunity for work, for a future and love, in the form of Italian-American Anthony Tony Fiorello [Emory Cohen] with whom she becomes romantically involved. When a family tragedy forces her to return to Ireland, she finds herself drawn back into the life she left behind. As a secret threatens to reveal itself, Eilis Lacey has to confront a terrible dilemma and a heart breaking choice between two men and two countries.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Set in 1950s Ireland, Saoirse Ronan stars as young Irish woman Eilis Lacey, who is given the chance to move away from her tiny countryside village to the bustling streets of Brooklyn in New York. Once on dry land, and after a very bumpy journey across the sea, especially getting seriously seasick, Eilis Lacey settles down in Mrs. Kehoes [Julie Walters] boarding house, alongside several other giddy, giggling girls. With the homesickness coming on in huge waves, Eilis Lacey struggles to fit into American life, until she meets handsome Italian boy Anthony Tony Fiorello [Emory Cohen]. Swept up in young love, Eilis Laceys world is torn in two when Eilis Lacey is forced to return home to Ireland for a month, leaving Anthony Tony Fiorello behind and wondering if the love of his life Eilis Lacey will ever return to Brooklyn.

Once back in 1950s Ireland, Eilis Lacey finds that things have moved on since she originally left, with her friends pairing off and getting married. When shes invited out for the day, she meets Jim Farrell [Domhnall Gleeson], a popular member of the community from a wealthy family. Its clear they are a perfect match, but where does Eilis Laceys heart lie? At home in Ireland, or back across the ocean in Brooklyn?

Director John Crowley has gone above and beyond when shooting Brooklyn, making it sumptuous to watch, as if youve really travelled back to 1950s New York. Its crisp, beautiful cinematography is hard to take your eyes off of, leaving you to soak in as much as you can before the next frame. Paired with a stunning soundtrack, its an immersive experience, something to be enjoyed and absorbed.

But what really makes the film BROOKLYN worth it are the performances from the cast. Saoirse Ronan is pure perfection, with the role of Eilis Lacey letting her really show her worth. Flitting between shyness, enthusiasm, heartbreak and joy, Saoirse Ronan is beautiful inside and out  if anything, watch it just for her performance alone. Emory Cohen as Anthony Tony Fiorello is, again, a marvel to watch, with his smooth Brooklyn accent and gorgeous smile. Paired together, Saoirse Ronan and Emory Cohen are truly wonderful. Julie Walters as the God-fearing, sarcastic Mrs. Kehoe is totally hilarious, while Jim Broadbent plays the gentle Irish giant Father Flood, but all in all Eilis Laceys is a guiding light when the young lady is out afloat in New York.

BROOKLYN is a tale of blossoming young love, and finding out that home isn't always where you expect it to be. Highly recommended, and a very worthy of its numerous nominations. BROOKLYN as the winner of the BAFTA Awards for Best British Film and nominated for three Academy Awards and it is clear that BROOKLYN is a really special and beautiful film. Give it a chance and youll see exactly why I loved it 100% and definitely a film I will treasure and want to view again and again, but also be prepared to get the Kleenex tissues out, as you will need them, as you will experience a massive amounts of rollercoaster emotions.

Blu-ray Video Quality  BROOKLYN comes to this Blu-ray disc via LIONSGATE and BBC Films with a wonderful looking 1080p encoded image transfer with an equally impressive 1.85:1 aspect ratio that really shines across the board. The film is heavily romanticized both in story as well as visual appeal, opening up the film with a rather grey and misty looking tone that shifts to a more natural colour grading as the film progresses. Certain parts of the film have some brilliant white levels that go into the nice ambient category to give a sort of halo effect to the sequences, the biggest one being on the Ellis Island sequence where the whites are so bright as to almost simulate a heavenly glow. At those moments and a few bits on board the transatlantic flight I noticed some softness due to a green screen effect, especially the water, but overall the fine detail is simply superb. BROOKLYN is not colour graded but the primary colours tend to be slightly saturated and seem to pop out off the screen at any given time, especially in Brooklyn in New York. Eilis Lacey [Saoirse Ronan] green overcoat is brilliant in its contrast to the greyish stone of Brooklyn and the cars whizzing by just seem to stand out off the screen with sharp blues and yellows and reds. Eilis Lacey lipstick stands out the most and highlights the pale Irish face behind it, making her all the more adorable. Black levels are consistent and there are few moments where the white colures are quite prominent at times. Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The BROOKLYN audio comes to you with a 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track and it is exactly what one would expect from a romantic drama like BROOKLYN. It doesnt have the complexity and overwhelming intensity of an action film or other more immersive style of film, but it does exactly what it is asked of it and is extremely effective on the smaller scale that its niche is. The dialog is the mainstay of the track and every word, whether it be in a heavy Brooklyn accent, and Irish one or even the thick Italian ones that Tony and his immigrant family speak in are perfectly intelligible at all times. There is quite a bit of ambiance in the big city as well as the country town that Ellis Lacey grew up in overseas, and they all integrate nicely into the surround channels in a more subdued and soft fashion. Certain scenes punctuates with a little oomph, otherwise it comes in to accentuate the melodic score that flows throughout the track. Its a simple track, but a very effective one that brings the film to life.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Deleted Scenes [2015] [1080p] [1.85:1] [6:12] Here you have a selection of 10 individual deleted from the film BROOKLYN. There are no separate titles, it runs automatically.

Special Feature: Interviews [2015] [1080p] [1.85:1] [7:35] Here you have a selection of two in-depth interviews from people who were intimately involved with the film BROOKLYN and how it affected them in different ways. The two people being interviewed are Saoirse Ronan [Eilis Lacey] and Colm Tibn [Writer]. As per usual, you can either watch them separately or Play All.

Special Feature: Featurette: BROOKLYN [2015] [1080p] [1.85:1] [5:40] This is a really beautifully presented in-depth documentary look at the film BROOKLYN and all who were affected with being involved with the film and basically informing us the meaning of the film and what it meant intimately to everyone who was involved with the film. It is broken up into different categories entitled TWO COUNTRIES; TWO LOVES and ONE HEART. It also has contributions from the following people, who are Colm Tibn [Writer]; Jim Broadbent [Father Flood]; Saoirse Ronan [Eilis Lacey]; Nick Hornby [Screenwriter]; Julie Walters [Mrs. Kehoe]; John Crowley [Director]; Domhnall Gleeson [Jim Farrell]; Emory Cohen [Tony] and Jessica Par [Miss Fortini]. We also get plenty of nice clips from the film and also nice behind-the-scenes filming. Despite being very short, it is still worth a view and is presented in a very professional way.

Finally, what can one say about this beautiful film and of course you will simply say that, BROOKLYN was one of the biggest surprises in 2015 that I have viewed in the last 6 months or so. I had heard rumours prior to the press release and was instantly intrigued to see Saoirse Ronan in an adult role. Sweet, laid back and entirely heart-warming in a non-cloying sort of way, BROOKLYN is a fantastic beautiful love story that can appeal to both men and women equally with its simple storytelling. The set pieces and locations are sumptuous and visually stimulating and the specs on the Blu-ray make it almost reach through the screen and touch it worthy of all the Awards it received and deservedly so and is definitely worthy of a watch. In some ways BROOKLYN feels like a film thats not just about life in general at the period it is set in, but also from, a more innocent age. Though the country to which Eilis Lacey emigrates is the America of the Korean War and the Red Scare, we get no hint of those national traumas, and potential racial tensions are defused in the comedy of irrepressible little brother Frankies announcement, when Eilis Lacey arrives at the family apartment, that the Italians hate the Irish. But this side lining of harsher elements is perhaps only to be expected in a film that takes a conventional romantic set-up and, and definitely elevates it to a more intelligent dramatic level of award winning performances. Very Highly Recommended!

7587352,5,B019WMTX72,"Colm Toibin is one of my favorite authors. His stories of Ireland and its history and heritage have given me a keener sense of that land and its people. His novel, 'Brooklyn' has been made into this film, and it is a veer from the usual path. I have a sense that this may be the beginning of an Irish/American tradition.

Eilis Lacey is a young woman living a sheltered life in a small Irish village, Enniscorthy. The period of time is the 1950's and there are two classes the working and the well to do. Eilis has several brothers and an older sister, Rose. Her mother is widowed and keeps the family running. The brothers have gone to Dublin to seek their fortune. It is Eilis' sister, Rose who is keeping the family fed and clothed. She is a secretary and earns a good living. Eilis is very good with numbers and a visiting priest from the United States is asked if he can assist Eilis to find a job. There is nothing available for her in her village, but Father Flood has many contacts in America. And, much to Eilis's surprise Father Flood has offered Eilis a chance for a new life and a job in the United States.

The promise of a new life in America brings many changes, but Eilis copes with her new found friends in a rooming house and her job as a sales girl. She studies accounting at night and writes many letters home. All is as it should be. Rose assists Father Flood with meals for the homeless and attends dances at the Catholic parish. It is here that she meets a young Italian boy, Tony. Love blooms and Eilis's life takes a new turn when tragedy strikes and she is summoned home. Eilis's response to these new life's changes may be surprising.

The film did an excellent job in fleshing out the characters, and Eilis and the Lacey family and friends in the small Irish village. However, the same cannot be said of the characters in Brooklyn. There was much more that could have been said about Tony and his family. Eilis's time at Brooklyn College and her studies of tax law seemed to fall apart. This is a nice film about a young Irish girl who finds love in a new land, and then returns to the land of yore.

I love a good romance, but what was there between the Irish girl and the Italian-American boy that was supposed to have made it such a great love affair?  Nothing, other than he ""liked Irish girls"" and she was lonely. He pressures her to marry him before she goes back to Ireland for a visit as a means of securing her return, and to my dismay, she succumbs to it. I wanted to scream at the screen ""DON'T DO IT, IT'S A TRAP!""  A more realistic -- and yes, MORE ROMANTIC version --- would be that they slept together but didn't get married, she goes back to Ireland and decides it's better to stay there amongst the kinship of family, friends, culture and a promising career --  than be with some guy who was simply her inferior in all respects just because she was no longer a virgin.",1458864000,10,834,4.32051282051282

7587368,5,B019WMTX72,"I saw Brooklyn in the theater about a month ago and fell in love. When my mom and I watched it on Amazon, she did, too. This is a sweet coming-of-age film. Yes, it is a love story, but it is also a story about a young woman growing up and setting out on her own. It is beautifully shot, quiet, and emotional, but not sappy. As a woman, I also appreciated seeing a well-made film told from a woman's perspective. In my experience there are many wonderful coming-of-age films featuring men and boys, but fewer featuring young women. This is not to say that men will not also love this movie - I believe it will appeal to a wide range of people. Anyone who has ever gone through the sometimes difficult experience of growing up and becoming an adult (and even many teenagers) should find something to love and relate to in this film.

Heartfelt, heart-rending rendition of the challenges of leaving all that is familiar - family, friends, culture, memories, places and trying to rebuild most of it all.

7587414,2,B019WMTX72,"This could have been 5 stars but wasn't. This is 2-3 stars to me because I'm a judgmental moralist.  Maybe I shouldn't blame the movie if some of it was from the writing of the author.  Maybe I'm too morally conservative for Eillis' mistakes.  For a movie that is ~2 hours, the last 1/4 of was crammed together and abrupt.

Spoiler alert: Some of the proponents are high on it's so-called dignity which Brooklyn has a lot of, yet I find the decision to withhold her marital status to all of her friends and mother and new illegitimate beau quite undignified.  This plight was uncalled for because it ruins some of Eillis' credibility without thoroughly exploring any good motives or valid reasons for her withholding this information. I guess it's left up to the audience.  I don't find it compelling.  Especially when it takes an old woman's vicious implications to force Eillis to disclose her marriage to her friends and mother with Eillis,  shortly thereafter, returning to Brooklyn with her Tony.  The Irish affair wasn't resolved at the the end with her husband.  I don't think the last 1\4 of the story was dignified at all.

The first 1\2 was great and dignified as some would say.  I loved the acting, producing, and directing except for the above mentioned concerns.

I think the time allotted to the beginning with the long drawn-out slow motion scenes for effect could have been minimized, and the time could have been devoted to Eillis' inner feelings, justifications, reasoning, and resolutions with her husband regarding the affair.

I'm frustrated with Hollywood which spoils otherwise amazing products with a small bit of ""spoiling bacteria"" thus ruining a potentially wonderful masterpiece as a small bit of bacteria can ruin a masterful fine wine.",1458345600,6,1766,4.922297297297297

7587430,5,B019WMTX72,"Place two very fine authors side by side  in this case Nick Hornsby (An Education, About a Boy) who adapted the popular novel by the same name by Colm T&oacute;ib&iacute;n (The Backwater Lightship) - and place it in the sure hands of a fine director John Crowley and the result is one of the more sensitive exploration of love and immigrants to be seen on the screen.

The story is deceptively simple a struggle of a young poor Irish girl who wants to better herself and believes that moving to the US will allow that  - but the underlying psychological lessons abound, making this a film not only satisfying the entertainment value but also producing some serous thought about problems we all face.

An Irish immigrant Eilis Lacey (Saoirse Ronan) leaves her mother Mary (Jane Brennan) and sister Rose (Fiona Glascott) and lands in 1950s Brooklyn, where she quickly falls into a romance with a local Italian boy Tony (Emory Cohen) and learns the ins and outs of working in a department story but maintains the goal of being a bookkeeper. She lives in a boarding house run by the strict but hilarious Mrs. Keogh (Julie Walters), navigates becoming a dating woman, agrees to marry Tony, but when a priest (Jim Broadbent) notifies her that her sister has suddenly died she returns to Ireland where she falls in love with an Irish lad (Domhnall Gleeson). When her past catches up with her, however, she must choose between two countries and the lives that exist within.

Rich in Gaelic charm and a fine examination between immigrant families (Irish and Italian) in Brooklyn, the film sings. Grady Harp, March 16",1458259200,,1607,4.766187050359712

7587440,5,B019WMTX72,"This is a subtle but very compelling film about a young woman who leaves Ireland to seek a better life in America. In Ireland she is pinned down by poverty, joblessness and a society that sees her as beholden to her ability to interest one of the young men in marriage. In America, she struggles against loneliness and homesickness, as she educates herself for a profession she hopes can lift her out of the daily grind of low-wage jobs. Along the way, she finds allies, from co-workers and a local priest, to young men who identify with her desire to better her lot. She goes back to Ireland with new eyes, and a much higher social status, and then she must choose between her greatly improved possibilities in Ireland, and her new life in America. This is the immigrant story retold, and the movie is also beautifully done, from the script to the art direction to the casting.

7587462,5,B019WMTX72,"I don't give five stars easily. This was an absolutely beautiful little film. Saoirse Ronan is very good in the lead, as are the supporting cast. It's a story that many viewers may know well -  about a young person who, with utter confidence, makes a decision to immigrate to another country and culture, only to find that home haunts you for months, and the homesickness you experience is nothing like you expected. It is nearly unbearable. And then the biggest surprise . . . that you are missing a ghost, because home doesn't ever stay the way we left it; it changes and disappears and something else takes its place. Things are never the way you remember.  If you have ever experienced this, you may do what I did and cry like a child throughout the film. If you haven't, you may see immigration differently. At any rate it will make you think about the meaning of ""home"" - is it the past?  The familiar?  Is it a person you can't live without?  Is ""home"" ultimately what you make it?

There is no antagonist,  no star-crossed lovers.  Contrary to the blurb on the jacket, I would not call this a compelling love story; It's more of an introspective piece.  The movie's conflict is entirely internal to our main character, a very sympathetic character.  The events in her life as she emigrates to America are mostly unextraordinary.  So this movie's reason for existing lies in it's realistic depiction of our heroine and the universality of her conflicts and choices -very satisfying on this level.",1458086400,,687,5.035398230088496

America is a country that carries so many people's dreams. Fortunately, it is a place for people who try hard and work hard to become progressive and successful. The movie uses Brooklyn as the title since New York is so famous in the world. However, I think this story also can occur in a lot of other cities.

7587581,4,B019WMTX72,"I went into this movie having high expectations-- especially knowing that Saoirse Ronan was nominated for an Academy Award. Unfortunately this movie just isn't as good as it should have been.

A brief synopsis: This tale of a lovely young woman leaving Ireland to make a new life in Brooklyn is refreshing. Eilis (Ronan) falls ""in love"" with a blue collar, young Italian plumber in Brooklyn and is forced to return home to Ireland and her budding romance due to an untimely death in the family. While in Ireland, a young man who is clearly of an aristocratic family begins falling in love with her, and hints that he may want to marry her. Who will she choose?

Unfortunately the relationships with both the plumber and the aristocrat are very superficial and are mostly unexplored. It leaves the viewer kind of uninvested really in either relationship. The director and screenplay should have explored these relationships quite a bit more.

I watched the movie expecting it to be akin to a 5 course meal, but unfortunately it lacked substance and felt more like bowl of Spaghetti O's",1457308800,,1084,4.817204301075269

Eilis's story made me realize how strikingly similar is the story of any immigrant. The homesickness, the longing for something better only to discover that now you long for what you left behind.... All and all to discover that the place you call home is no longer that.
That defining moment where you get to go back to realize that home is the new place where you had your new beginning. Home is the place where you became who you ultimately are. The place where you make new friends and a new life. The place where you find true love and you start a family. The place where you had opportunities that you wouldn't of had anywhere else.

7587672,5,B019WMTX72,"This movie is about a virtuous and innocent young Irish immigrant making her way through Brooklyn in the 1950s. A benevolent New York priest (a refreshing change from the predatory priests depicted in Spotlight), in contact with a priest in her hometown in Ireland, arranges a job in New York and a place for her to rent a room. At first shes very homesick, but then she falls in love. Its partly a sad movie, because she has to choose between the two countries. The movie is set partly in Brooklyn and partly in Ireland, and both settings are visually pretty and cheerful (a look that Richard Brody disparages as a blandly pretty, boutique-y palette of images). About midway through the movie, a tenor sings a beautiful Gaelic song a cappella, and that I think that song alone is worth the price of admission. The movie has some comic scenes at a boarding-house dinner table presided over by a landlady played by Julie Walters. The bittersweet ending is not a downer. I had read Colm Tibn novel on which the movie is based, and I thought this movie did a good job of telling Tibns story.",1456876800,,1088,4.5561224489795915

7587714,5,B019WMTX72,"I am so in love with this movie.  Viewed the movie November 2015. Think of the movie often. Every detail was addressed. I went to Brooklyn during  the 1950""s, when I was very young.  Wonderful memories  of the old Brooklyn and how sad that the movie has to be shot in Montreal
Hoping that Saoirse would have won last evening for Best Actress but not in the cards
My mother is Irish and in that vain this movie will always bring tears to my eyes",1456704000,3,444,4.188235294117647
7587715,3,B019WMTX72,"I agree with many reviews.  A sweet simple film, a movie a family could see together.  Set in 1952, but in this case Ireland didn't seem so terrible to leave.  It was more about a personal issue with a girl trying to find something different in life. A simple romance, should she stay with the man she fell in love with in Brooklyn.  I kind of agree, the film has really nothing to do with Brooklyn, it's just the city they happen to settle in.  If you were looking for a deep historical lesson about the city, it's not there, other than the message that many immigrants came there to live.  It was interesting learning about how the immigrants stayed in boarding houses at first and how the church helped settle probably many people.  If you're looking for the terrible, unfair conditions the Irish(or any ethnic group for that matter) had to live through say in the late 1800's, you are not going to find it.  Some reviews made me chuckle, because I was looking for some words to describe a characteristic of the film, I couldn't quite find the words - the great amount of serious staring the main character did.  Lots of staring!  Not much dialog in those parts.  Nice effect but overused in this case.  Couldn't figure out why it was nominated for some Oscars.  It was ok, not bad, not great.  The actress was beautiful though, I'll have to say that.",1456704000,,1354,4.473469387755102
7587716,5,B019WMTX72,"A beautiful moving movie.  My mother immigrated to America from Blackburn, England, art e r marrying my father who fought in WWII.  She left behind her mother, father, and two sisters.  She, like Eillish was so home sick.  She had married a man who was raised by a religious zealot, and hated her because she was a Methodist, and not a 7th Day Adventist.  Sadly her life was one tortured living with a man who was tortured by religion by his father.  I so wish she had met someone as kind as Eillish had.  It would truly have been a better life for me and my four siblings.  This was truly a beautiful movie, one I wish my own mother had lived.  That celebrated her heritage, beliefs and the type of love she didn't find.",1456704000,,721,4.281481481481482

7587724,5,B019WMTX72,"One of the best movies (and not a comic book) I've seen in ages. It's a thoughtful movie, poignant, beautiful, that tugs at heartstrings without sentimentality. Saoirse Ronan was incredible. There was more dialogue in her face - you could feel her changing emotions - excitement and sorrow, the conflict of letting go and holding on - she was brilliant.

7587779,5,B019WMTX72,"A beautiful and poignant film. The main character in this film really is the setting and it should win an Oscar.

Possibly the only misstep in this amazing film is the ""sex"" scene, which was wholly pointless and gratuitous. It was certainly not the audience expected behavior of the Eilis that the screenwriter so carefully constructed to ensure we identified with. And we did, to the point where we read every nuance and gesture, as if we knew her well.  The movie moves fluidly except for that very brief scene.
Eilis is a private woman, a girl really. She is very conflicted and yes, in many ways immature. A woman who is dealing with two cultures, a past and a future.

Worth seeing, again and again.",1456444800,,704,4.571428571428571
7587780,4,B019WMTX72,"A sombre film with a satisfying ending. Eilis Lacey, a passive, quiet and acquiescent young woman largely conforms to family and social expectations to avoid conflict. However, despite Eilis's reserved nature and compliance her intelligence shines through revealing that she wants more from life than just finding an ideal marriage. Despite the homesickness she endures when she arrives in Brooklyn she ultimately embraces the American Dream and is responsive to the opportunities that this larger and thoroughly modern city offers her. As new opportunities, new friends then the rapid development of her romance with Tony develop Eilis's homesickness fades into the background to the extent that she is almost reluctant to return to Ireland resulting from tragic circumstances.

Her return to Ireland and the pull back to Brooklyn and Tony reveals how much Eilis has changed. The slower pace of rural Ireland is a stark contrast to fast paced and progressive Brooklyn with it's enclaves of Irish immigrants dreaming of better life. As Eilis's mother and friends and a new romance present at home they try to persuade her to remain and she becomes seduced to stay building up the tension of having to made a decision before the decision is no longer her own. This is a migrant story which reveals that despite leaving home and family that humans ultimately seek a better life, are remarkably adaptable and embrace a new different life. Saoirse Ronan is brilliant as Eilis and the director vividly encapsulates 1950s Brooklyn and Ireland.",1456358400,,1537,5.172690763052209

Even now, while other film claim to be better, you can judge by yourself because I thought they didn't make them like this anymore. Not a frame is wasted, every bit of acting is perfect. There no unnecessary noise or padding. It's the story of heart's quest.",1456272000,,475,4.6
7587782,5,B019WMTX72,"Set in 1952, Brooklyn tells the story of a young Irish woman Eilis (Saoirse Ronan) and her immigration to New York where at first she has a hard time settling in at her new job at a department store while living at an Irish boarding house where she dines each evening. She soon falls into a romance with a young man from an Italian family named Tony (Emory Cohen) which helps her become more comfortable and confident in her surroundings. When her past life in Ireland falls to hardships after the death of her sister, she quickly moves back and suddenly must chose between the two countries and her lives that exists within them.

Told with beautiful authenticity and simplicity in the direction by John Crowley and amazing performances by Saoirse Ronan and the rest of the cast, Brooklyn is without a doubt in my mind the most believable and truthfully thought out romance stories in recent years that deserves to be place with classic Hollywood films such as Casablanca (1942) and Now, Voyager (1942) for its pure professionalism. Ronan is an actress for the ages who I believe has a great career ahead of her and the chemistry between her and Cohen is sincere and moving. While it is for all intents and purposes a drama, there are even moments of delightful humor and it is very effective. The films third act brings the film and Ronans character into a sense of conflicted emotions that works completely to its fullest effect. It makes this work an intriguing and honest coming of age tale.

It is rare in this day and age that we see a film with this much charm and class and Brooklyn is fully worthy of the praise it has received from critics and audiences a like, it is arguably the one film from this year that has achieved such a status. The film is currently up for Oscar nominations for best picture and best actress for Ronan and weather it wins in either category, I have a feeling that it will endure for years to come as one of the true film classics of the decade.",1456272000,2,1982,4.502777777777778

7587792,5,B019WMTX72,"I've loved Saoirse Ronan since I first discovered her as the early life of the author dying who wants to cleanse herself of what can only be called the vengeance of a wicked young woman in the adaptation of Atonement. I eagerly anticipated what future roles she would play, and my wait is now over.

In Chicago, Colm Tobin's novel was selected a couple of years ago for the citywide reading initiative, One Book, One Chicago, so I was notstranger to the film's plot, and lovers of the book, myself included, will not be disappointed by faithful adaptation. There's a slight deviation from an important storyline....no spoiler here.

The production is visually wistful of the 1950's America and reminiscent of that era's Douglas Serk. Fans of the Julianne Moore/ Dennis Quaid Far from Heaven might see the correlations to those films. As Innis' life evolves, the backdrop of the city, the charming depiction of immigrant communities may think of Cher's development in Moonstruck.

7587794,5,B019WMTX72,"Brooklyn is the story of a young Irish woman who in the early 1950s leaves behind her family and the only life she knew to come to America, the land of promise. She ends up in a boarding house in Brooklyn and takes a job as a salesclerk in a department store.

Eilis Lacey, played by the talented Saoirse Ronan, yearns to be something more and so, with the help of her sister's friend, a local priest, takes night courses in accounting, which is also her sister Rose's occupation in Ireland.

Like so many young women of the day, Eilis spends her evenings at the parish dance hall, where she meets a nice Italian boy, Tony (Emory Cohen). The couple's evolution is sweet and evokes the innocence of the era and the two fall in love but, after a family tragedy, Eilis is called back to Ireland, and a stay that was to be temporary becomes something more. Returning only to be a help to her aged mother, Eilis is drawn into a life in her homeland. With America in her rear-view mirror, Eilis is torn between the new life she forged in Brooklyn and the surprisingly promising life she falls into in Ireland on her return. But when a secret she is harboring is threatened to be revealed, Eilis must decide whether to carry on in Ireland or return to America.

I first became aware of Ronan in the 2007 film Atonement, which starred Keira Knightley, fresh from Pirates of the Caribbean fame and someone to watch out for, but Ronan, a young teen at the time, stole much of Knightley's thunder and proved to be a gifted actress way back when.

With a screenplay written by Nick Hornby and taken from the popular fictional tale penned by Colm Toibin, Brooklyn is a film that will appeal to most age groups. The lush cinematography is reminiscent of postcards of the era taken in black and white and colored by hand. It's a memorable film and different from most cinema fare, in a good way.",1453939200,5,1880,4.440579710144927
7587795,3,B019WMTX72,"This sweet and inoffensive film is in the running for an Oscar this year, but frankly, I'm not sure why. Focusing on emigrant Eilis Lacey in 1952, ""Brooklyn"" paints a story of a nave young Irish girl who happens to score a job in the States, thanks to the efforts of her sister and a kindly priest. She endures the standard difficulties -- seasickness, new customs and accents, strange working conditions and crippling homesickness. She meets a boy and falls in love. A crisis sends her back to her homeland, where she is sorely tempted to rethink her decision to leave Ireland. The crux of the film deals with her choice.

What's strange about the film is that it gives poor Eilis no motivations to leave Ireland, depriving us of a rationale for her later crisis of doubt. She seems to love home, disliking only the mean-spirited witch who runs the dry goods store where she works. She and mom get along, and she loves her sister for giving up her life and career to give Eilis a chance to make it in the big city. Only in the last minutes, in the film's critical moment, do we learn the Eilis had resentments about the confinement of small town living. By that time, you feel like you've been had.

For a small-town girl in conservative 1950s Catholic Ireland, Eilis, (always portrayed as virtuous and polite to a fault) has remarkably few scruples about jumping into bed. Amazingly, for a neophyte, she's quite adept at the procedure. Must be all those Gene Kelley movies she saw. And don't bother looking for a rosary, dolorous Virgin or Sacred Heart in this film about Catholic Ireland. Any more than you would find an arrow-pierced Saint Sebastian statue at Downtown Abbey. Strange.

That said, the love affair between Eilis and her American beau is sweetly awkward. The best part of the film is their awkward courtship.

Brooklyn, in spite of its title, spends little time in the borough. That makes sense for a film that seems not to understand her protagonist's culture or what makes her tick.",1453593600,8,2002,4.662889518413598
7587796,5,B019WMTX72,"Brooklyn. In this charming poignant love story, Eilis Lacey, a young Irish immigrant (played by Saoirse Ronan), follows the plan laid out by her sister  Rose and a friendly Irish priest, Father Flood, to leave her hometown Enniscorthy (also author Toibins hometown), in the second great Irish Diaspora,  as people left their homeland in order to find better work, and a better future, in the United States. Eilis lands in New York City, settling in 1950s Brooklyn, then the largest Irish city in the world. There, after a period of loneliness and homesickness, she falls in love with Tony Fiorello, an Italian-American local.  But  family tragedy calls her  home: she eventually must choose between two countries, two men.  The romantic/dramatic/comedy, coming of age story, based on the critically-acclaimed book by Colm Toibin, (THE BLACKWATER NIGHTSHIP, THE MASTER), was adapted for the screen by the English journalist/novelist/screenwriter Nick Hornby, directed by John Crowley.  The film is high on many movie critics best of 2015 lists; Ronan has received a Best Actress Oscar nomination.

Recently, I saw an interview with screenwriter Hornby. He remarked that  young women actors generally have so little to do in films, just playing the girlfriend/wife lying around the house waiting for the boyfriend/husband to come back from the front/the real world that, as a screenwriter, he  knew, considering the size and scope of the part of Eilis, he  could get the top  young women actors to compete for the part.  And so he snagged Ronan.  This is her first adult role, but she was greatly praised for her work in ATONEMENT, HANNA, THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL.  Ronin is ably supported by honored veteran Jim Broadbent, (MOULIN ROUGE, HARRY POTTER), as Father Flood; the fine-featured Fiona Glascott, ( Mrs. Raworth, the missionarys wife, INDIAN SUMMERS), as Eiliss sister Rose; Emory Cohen as Tony; the admired veteran Julie Walters, ( Cynthia Coffin in INDIAN SUMMERS, HARRY POTTER), as Mrs. Keogh, Eiliss boardinghouse landlady; and the currently ubiquitous young Domhnall Gleeson, son of Brendan, ( THE REVENANT, EX MACHINA), as Jim Farrell.

The film is highly literate, of course, does the Irish countryside justice, brings the Brooklyn neighborhoods both my husband and I know well, for we were each bred and buttered in Brooklyn, to the life.  It is tender, touching, rollicking, funny, sharp of elbow when need be. Mind you, I have read and reviewed on its Amazon website the book of the same name upon which the picture is based. The film has picked up some favorite scenes from the book, and made them little comic masterpiece interludes: Eilis being taught to eat pasta the Italian way by her boardinghouse friends, actually properly eating the pasta with Tonys family at dinner. And, at that same dinner, Tonys younger brother announcing that the family did not like the Irish. It has also, oddly enough, picked up a couple of minor anomalous mistakes I caught Toibin making in the book: womens pink plastic razors were not introduced until the 1970s; and nobody, but nobody, put ketchup on their hotdogs at Nathans, Coney Island.

As it happens, I saw this film in Dublin, with Maire, a dear Irish friend.  She was puzzled, shocked by the films later Irish chapters: Eiliss behavior is hard to understand.  I explained the cynical theory Id formed after reading the underlying book. It goes: just how successful would a novel similar to BROOKLYN, be, would a movie  ever be made of such a similar novel, if the story were simply that a fair young Irish girl leaves her homeland, is homesick and lonely, finds fella. (More recently, Ive seen that such a book would be self-published.)  Anyway, later in our conversation, Maire identified the song  at the churchs Christmas dinner for the homeless as a beloved old Celtic song,Casadh antSugain (A Twist of the Rope), sung by a popular traditional sean-nos singer, Iarla OLionaird. It had reduced us both to tears. There aren't many pictures that can have you falling about with laughter , then crying in two hours.  This is one of the best.",1453593600,14,4104,5.010309278350515
7587797,5,B019WMTX72,"Theatrical review.  Is it too late to amend my Top 10 Movies of 2015?  This little film finally showed up at a theater near me and so I took it in.  The film features the excellent Saoirse Ronan (Hanna and The Grand Budapest Hotel) who got her first Oscar nom for 2007s Atonement.  She plays Eillis Lacey, an Irish lass of about 20.  With the urging of her older sister Rose (Fiona Glascott, House of Shadows), shes heading off for America, where she will settle in with other Irish emigres in Brooklyn.

Director John Crowley (Closed Circuit) had me from the beginning.  As the departing Eillis is waving goodbye to Rose and their mother, Mary (Jane Brennan), the camera closes in on the faces of the families on shore.  Panning the camera to the left, we see others whose faces project the sadness of family members heading off to a new life across the Atlantic.  Eillis isn't sure about it all, but Rose has insisted she will find a better life there.

Once she arrives, Eillis settles in at a boarding house run by Mrs. Keogh, (Julie Walters), thanks to Father Flood (Jim Broadbent).  The landlady is a hoot as are the other tenants.  Much different than I expected.  Shes morally sensible but has no problem with the young women seeking a man.  It seems a little off-putting in todays world, but the ideal life in the early 1950s was a man, a woman and children.  Each of the ladies have small scenes at the nightly dinner table and rather than turn them into run-of-the-mill meanies or misfits, Crowley and screenwriter Nick Hornby give each a personality.  It is really quite refreshing.

As Eillis begins to adapt and moves on past her loneliness and regret, she meets Tony (Emory Cohen, The Place Beyond the Pines), a young Italian plumber, at a church dance.  In a beautiful turn by Cohen, Tony is the perfect marrying type.  Hes handsome, hes polite, he has a job, and hes ambitious.  Everything seems to be working out.  Even Eilliss clerk job at a high end department store is going well.  Shes taking night classes in bookkeeping and hopes to become an accountant, like her sister.

Plans are interrupted however as events in her home country require a trip back.  Once there, Eillis meets some old friends and eventually Jim Farrell (Domhnall Gleeson), another well-meaning bachelor from a wealthy family.  They become friends quickly.  Eillis is even given a part time job in her chosen field.  What to do?  Stay in Ireland or go back to Tony and New York.  Frankly, the choice is difficult and Ms. Ronan handles the scenes brilliantly.  Im guessing she won't win the Oscar this year, but if she does, I won't be shockedor disappointed.  Shes in almost every scene and shes terrific, as is the movie.  Highly recommended.",1453507200,143,2737,4.661087866108787
7587798,3,B019WMTX72,"Nine Things About ""Brooklyn""

1. This is a romantic drama that tells yet another New York immigrant story. It's biggest strength is it's sense of style and place.

2. It's set in 1952, and is about a lovely, innocent girl named Eilis (which is pronounced ""Ay-lish""), who leaves her mother and sister behind in small-town Ireland and moves to Brooklyn to find a better life. She does find a better life, but she also feels the pull back to her homeland.

There. That's the whole plot.

3. This is set in the mythical America, where everything is clean, everybody is nice to each other, and if you follow your heart, everything turns out OK. There is only one scene that acknowledges that the American dream doesn't work for everyone, and the point of that scene is just to show what a big heart Eilis has.

4. Every story needs a conflict to stay interesting. The biggest conflict in this movie is watching Eilis decide where to live and who to marry. But even those conflicts are mostly of Eilis's making - it didn't have to be that difficult.

5. Like every mythical America story, there is a bit of ""Cinderella"" about this movie, but here, the evil stepsisters are the resentful young ladies that Eilis lives with in a boarding house. The fairy godmother is a Catholic priest.

6. The two main actors, Saorise Ronan (Saorise is pronounced ""Sur-sha""), and Emory Cohen, are charismatic and have a good chemistry together. They are such a gosh-darn cute couple that you just have to root for them to get together.

7. The town in Ireland was actually more interesting to me than Brooklyn. There were some great characters there, including a bitch that runs a little shop, and Eilis's mother, who must deal with ever-increasing loss in her life.

8. I give the movie credit for not making it a completely fairy tale ending - it does show a few sacrifices that immigrants must make in order to have a better life.

9. There's not a lot to this movie; the pretty style and breezy story cover up the fact that it's pretty thin. When the biggest piece of suspense is wondering about a girl's marital status, it doesn't take a lot of concentration. But it doesn't suck, and is a good thing to watch if you wish you lived in a pretend America instead of the real one.",1453507200,3,2259,4.528255528255528
7587799,4,B019WMTX72,"A pleasantly diverting movie of the immigrant experience in America and its effect on this naive and inexperienced young woman literally fresh off the boat from Ireland in the early 50's. Saoirse Ronan gives a solid and empathetic performance of the woman and her evolution to a modern and more self-reliant aspiring American. The supporting cast with Jim Broadbent as her New York parish priest/support system and the colorful Irish landlady running the boarding house where she lives are lots of fun to watch as is the young Italian-American man she falls in love with in an equally warm performance. The performers make this movie watchable, but the movie itself is not terribly original or at all judgemental of time and place at least on this side of the ocean. In the end, it really has nothing new to say, which is a shame in my opinion, But then, you'll likely be willing to forgive that while watching it enjoyably unfold. .",1453161600,2,933,4.765432098765432

7587802,5,B019WMTX72,"Eilis is a young immigrant woman with each foot in a different world. All they have in common is: She falls for a man in each place.

Written by Nick Hornby (""About a Boy"") and based on Colm Toibin's novel, this lovely film is directed by John Crowley (""Closed Circuit""). We know the actors are excellent because he can indulge in lengthy single-take scenes.

The cast:
  * Saoirse (""Sair' sha"") Ronan (""The Grand Budapest Hotel"") is Eilis, frustrated by small-minded provincial people in her Irish hometown, agrees to emigrate. Sponsored by a Brooklyn-based priest, she has lodgings and a job when she lands in the United States.
  * Jim Broadbent (""The Iron Lady"") is Father Flood, personally familiar with the immigrant experience, he is the perfect sponsor.
  * Julie Walters (""Harry Potter"") is Mrs. Kehoe, the wise (and funny!) landlady at the residence for young women where Eilis has a room.
  * Emory Cohen (""Smash"") is Tony, the young Italian plumber who loves Irish girls. He also loves the Brooklyn Dodgers! His family is delightful and we get to see their expressive Italian hands in action around the dinner table.
  * Domhnall Gleeson (""About Time"") Jim Farrell is the appealing young man in Ireland. There are some things she hasn't mentioned to him.

It's lovely to watch a capable actress like Ronan inhabit a character who evolves from timid and tongue tied, to confident and articulate. We see how homesick she is at first and how she uses that chatty dinner table to learn some much-needed survival skills: e.g., how to eat spaghetti! We respect her ambition as we watch her enroll in night school, but hope those new skills won't be used against her when she has to make an emergency trip back to Ireland.

If I had to quibble, I would say that the 1950s didn't boast such vivid cosmetics or such eye-catching clothes. But who's to say, I only lived them. In addition, Mr. Cohen seems to be emulating Marlon Brando: his mumbled dialogue begs for captions! This nit-picking notwithstanding, this is a highly satisfying chick flick when the only betrayal our heroine experiences is the one of her own heart.",1452902400,2,2127,4.8076923076923075
7587803,4,B019WMTX72,"l remember first seeing Saoirse Ronan in the 2013 movie ""Byzantium"".  She did an amazing job in that particular film, and I am glad to have had the opportunity to witness her outing in the movie Brooklyn.

 Ellis Lacey is a young but curious girl from Ireland who gets the chance to go to America in hopes that she can have a better life.  And Saoirse Ronan's portrayal of Ellis is spot-on in every way. No matter how great the other actors/actresses are, Saoirse leaves her stamp on this movie in an extremely memorable way. Her fellow supporting cast members such as: Julie Waters, and Domhnall Gleeson also have nice outings in Brooklyn as well.

What's more likable is the beautiful scenery and landscape displayed throughout Brooklyn. But aside from Saoirse's impressive turn as Ellis, I found that I very much enjoyed the music that played numerous moments throughout Brooklyn. I'll keep this review short, by writing that I definitely enjoyed Brooklyn; its a very thoughtful film and it is definitely a showcase for Saoirse Ronan.",1452729600,4,1037,4.869318181818182

Again, a movie mentioned in someone else's list, it is a heartfelt Romantic drama, well acted, costumed and shot with an authentic feel for the early fifties period.

7587806,5,B019WMTX72,"We hadn't seen Saoirse Rona in anything since 2011's Hanna [Blu-ray]. She was excellent in that and she is excellent here. The story is simple, the script common. But this film about a young woman forced to move from Ireland to New York is executed flawlessly, in a very straightforward yet heartwarming manner. ""Ellis Isand type"" movies may be a dime a dozen, but this one is pitch perfect. A period piece set in 1952, it at times felt like it could have been from decades earlier.

Saoirse's character leaves Ireland because of economic conditions, but there was much to her town she did not like with rude (but funny) people, small town gossip, and entrenched elitism. Homesick at first, she blossoms in NY. When she leaves the new life she has started and returns to visit her mother, circumstances conspire to keep her there, and she has to decide whether she wants to live in the past or the future. There is no right or wrong answer, and she will be leaving behind loved ones regardless what she decides. Sounds pretty glum, but the movie is shot in a way where optimism is always around the corner, filled with many kindhearted people to outweigh the bad. This has a much warmer tone and seems more Americanized than much of the PBS brit-type fair that is fairly popular right now. If you enjoy The Paradise: Season 1 or Doc Martin you will still likely enjoy this as well.

A very good supporting cast, nicely shot, with a perfect soundtrack. 2 hours long, but with solid pacing that goes quickly, this movie manages to be a chick flick, good date movie, enjoyable by highschoolers to 80, and artsy all at the same time. It is nice to see simple and innocent still being capable of being so entertaining.",1452297600,76,1713,4.576547231270358
7587807,4,B019WMTX72,"This is a very emotional and beautiful film of 1952 Brooklyn, where an Irish small village girl arrives when a certain Father Flood arranges it.  She is uncertain and naive and accepts all that happens around her: the counter job at Bartocci's, a rather fancy department store; the other young Irish ladies at the boarding house whose major focus is marriage; the boarding house owner who is running things like an Irish nun; the Italian-american plumber who comes to the parish hall to find a girl like her; the night classes in bookkeeping and commercial law; the limited choices are typical of the time for an Irish young woman with a poor background.

I have one quibble with the love story of the young plumber, who lives with his parents and siblings.  eilis is shown as a determined and opinionated young lady as the film progresses.  She is very sharp in her commercial law class.  All the other students are young men.  In the novel the teacher is a holocaust survivor but that is omitted as irrelevant in the film.

We are shown that Tony Fiorelli can hardly write.  He must have barely passed grammar school.  He is not too bright  and that comes through in his speech.

I am Irish and naturally I love words and books and ideas.  Tony does not.  Eilis is not shown reading but she is shown as ambitious and very intelligent.  So what does not ring true in the least in this story is why she likes him.  He is clearly infatuated in a puppy-like way.  She is cool and calculating yet decided that this simple Italian plumber is her true love.  Perhaps the scene with the spaghetti, meeting his parents, rang true for Italian viewers.  Why it did not ring true for me is that I know in my guys that Irish women were looking for Irish men.  And this woman is extremely Irish in her thinking!  She will rule the roost!  With an iron shillelagh!

Poor Tony indeed!  Amenable this woman is not.  Only on the surface, as it suits her petty goals, does she go along with jobs and food and certain people.  Underneath she is a very strong willed and rebellious woman.  Perhaps Tony senses this and  knows he needs such a person.

All I can say in the end is that it is a very strong and emotional film for any Irish woman to see.  The strings restricting her in the job world and in the gossiping around her are scary.  Perhaps she realizes that marriage is the only real and decent option.  Otherwise she will be nobody and have nothing and be gossiped about.

The book had a lot of admirers and a lot of naysayers.  The passivity of Eilis annoys some readers or viewers.  I'm Saying it is a question. Of  very limited choices!",1452297600,3,2630,4.4423480083857445
