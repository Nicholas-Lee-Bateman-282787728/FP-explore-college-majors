7934304,3,B000059TP0,"Legend of Black Heaven is very funny and has a very cool story idea.  With more effort it could have been awesome, but weak animation and lack of secondary-character and plot development keep it from being a great classic.

In the final disc, the space chick dons a bunny suit to undergo special training, and joins the band as keyboardist, Oji's wife finally leaves him, before discovering he's been telling the truth all along, and the band must face off against the evil enhanced clone of their own dead keyboard player. The lack of cool animated scenes of the six-armed keyboard player was a defining disappointment for the cheapness of the animation.  Surely they could have managed one or two really cool scenes of keyboard-pounding madness, instead of the one nearly static frontal view and the one view of three hands on the keys.

Still, if you've watched the series this far, you should find the end reasonably satisfying",1247270400,,931,4.836477987421383
7934305,5,B000059TP0,"The Legend of Black Heaven is a new series by AIC. The main character is Tanaka Oji, ex-guitarist of metal band Black Heaven. After marriage he had to throw his passion and become regular office worker - try to oppose your wife! ^_^ Anyway, one day he meets Yuki Layla, new secretary in his company. She's asking him to play guitar in a strange 'night club' (really it's a space ship!). From this point the hot action begins - his playing is necessary to activate the ultimate weapon, which is the only chance to stop alien invasion in a quadrant localized very close to Earth. If you want to know more you have to watch it yourself. Very good animation (though real otaku may not accept 3D renders when the action is localized in space), lotsa humor and thrilling story - this combo will blow your mind! ^_^",989280000,,808,4.466216216216216
