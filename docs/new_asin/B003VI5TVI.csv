8406816,5,B003VI5TVI,"Ok so the show it's self is stupid, Concept good but really bad acting.  I lived on Catalina for 10 years so really wanted this for the views and the fact I am in one scene with some friends!!",1311120000,,192,3.923076923076923
8406817,5,B003VI5TVI,"You are so right Donna B. I LOVED this show! What is wrong with television executives that this was not picked up? The music is great, I loved the adult and teen couples and come on - Jack Kincaid is TOTALLY HOT!! I guess family programming with fun and values isn't suitable for TV.  Glad I bought the DVD.",1295481600,2,307,4.203389830508475
8406818,5,B003VI5TVI,"I loved ""twentysixmiles"" It was beautifully shot, I loved getting to know Catalina Island. I also loved all the characters.  Jack is sooo sexy! The band ""Renegades"" rock!  I'm bummed the show didn't get picked up. It would be great to see more episodes.",1289865600,3,253,4.7272727272727275
