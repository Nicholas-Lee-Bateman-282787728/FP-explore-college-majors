It is amazing and the DVD is perfectly coded so you can skip directly to the drill you are ready to work on. The explanations are wonderfully clear and you truly do know when you're ready to move on. You also find out quickly if you've moved on too soon as you'll struggle with a skill drill that you're not yet ready for. It truly does make anyone feel beautiful and competent in the water. I love using swimming as a meditative exercise!",1186704000,,536,4.114285714285714
8132878,5,B000GIXGXY,Enjoyed the dvd and would definitely recommend it! Goes well with Terry Laughlin's book.,1181174400,,88,5.357142857142857
8132879,5,B000GIXGXY,"This is a fabulous DVD for the novice or expert swimmer.  Hard to believe but I fit the first category and I have gone from struggling, gasping swimmer to a smooth and steadily improving swimmer.  I have Master Swimmers ask me about my training and some of the drills I practice.  My training consists of reading Total Immersion ...the book by Mr. Laughlin which is fleshed out by this DVD.  The drills are all described in the book but hard to recreate on your own.  Not only does the DVD show you in great detail and narrative how to do the drills but you get to see good technique in all four strokes.  Never mind about the packaging.  It is the content that is absolutely priceless.",1180656000,2,686,4.396825396825397
8132880,5,B000GIXGXY,"Like all the Total Immersion DVD's I've viewed, this one provides easy-to-follow instructions for drills, arranged in series of gradually increasing difficulty.  Even without a coach, I find that I can use these intelligently designed drills to learn new strokes or even a whole new way of being in the water.

This latest addition adds new material on the crawl, not repetitions from earlier crawl DVDs.  My balance in the water, already good after working with the TI Freestyle Made Easy DVD, has improved dramatically after just a few sessions in the pool using these latest drills.  I had never before learned any butterfly, but the drills on the Four Stroke DVD have enabled me to ""dolphin"" two pool lengths in a row after just a few days of practice....I expect to be performing the complete stroke--as well as the breaststroke--soon.

This video calls into question the common wisdom which tells us that you can't really learn a skill correctly without the aid of a teacher.  I am hoping someday to be able to take some  lessons with a TI swimming coach, but until then, I am enjoying the water (for the first time in my life) and feeling safe, powerful, and fluid as I move through it.

By the way, the production values are excellent.  The slow-mo sequences are particularly helpful in breaking down each stroke into its elements for learning.  It would be nice to have a brief introduction to the swimmers who elegantly demonstrate the drills so we could see what their faces look like.

Thanks, Terry Laughlin, for producing this wonderful tool.",1173398400,6,1556,4.81203007518797
8132881,5,B000GIXGXY,"This DVD shows in detail progressive drills for each competitive swimming stroke, so that by practicing them the swimmer can greatly improve technique, which leads to faster and more effortless swimming. At the age of 50 I recently joined a Masters swimming program, and practicing the drills has greatly enhanced my understanding of and ability to do the strokes.",1168473600,,364,5.186440677966102
8132882,3,B000GIXGXY,"Good explainations of drills and easy to see examples.  Focus is ONLY on drills, not on any full stroke.  Something more comprehensive, showing the breakdown of a full stroke, would be more useful for age-groupers.",1168300800,5,214,5.085714285714285
