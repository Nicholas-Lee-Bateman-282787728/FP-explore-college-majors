1630423,2,B00005N911,"The Hallmark version of Mark Twain's classic, ""The Prince and the Pauper"" fails to tell major parts of the story. The acting is very childish, and the many of the characters fail to act their parts.

  Many scenes are poorly shot, and there are many chapters of the book left out (ex: the ""foo-foo, king of the moon calves"" scene, the whole character of the priest who teaches Tom to read Latin, and the test to determine the true king at the end of the film).

  In addition, the wardrobe is aweful. There is really no showing of actual poverty in this film. In the beginning of the film, Tom is wearing a decent set of clothing with shoes. In this time period, if a youth of age twelve was dressed as Tom was, he would not have been considered poor by any means. In addition, Tom speaks like an educated American rather than a poor English youth. Also, Tom's grandmother is a kind, gentle lady quite unlike her portrayal in the novel, where she and her son (i.e. Tom's father) beat Tom, his mother, and sisters. In fact, there is no beating at all in this film. It is more a fairy tale than social film.

  In short, I believe this film (if rated) would receive a ""G"" rating. There is no swearing, no real violence, so social crisis, etc. While I realize that teachers have few options for their classes as for COLORED versions of this films to watch, I would recommend the Disney VHS version of the film - ASIN: B000E78DGC. In fact, I really hope Disney eventually releases this 1962 version of the film (starring Guy Williams) on DVD. For the Disney version of the Prince and the Pauper is quite accurate concerning the poverty of Tom Canty and the splendor of the Tudor family.",1197763200,25,1682,4.41747572815534
1630424,3,B00005N911,"Ah.... HALLMARK HOME ENTERTAINMENT, the production company of clean boring stories for the family! Sorry, but with so many other versions of THE PRINCE AND THE PAUPER done over the years, this production for all of it's star power (Alan Bates, Aidan Quinn and Jonathan Hyde) is rather generic and ultimately unsatisfying. The screenplay is pretty choppy and cuts through alot of the book in order to make the 90 minute deadline required to fit in all of the advertisers. Aidan Quinn is SO much better than this. His role as the king's protector, Miles Hendon, is pretty much nothing! The film has a VERY made-for-television look and feel.

What I did find good about this production was the use of real life twins, Robert and Jonathan Timmins to play Edward and Tom. Generally, other productions have used the same actor to play the mirror images. Ultimately what made this film most enjoyable is the excellent soundtrack by veteran composer Stanislas Syrewicz. He has a wonderful sense of period music and he has created a very enjoyable soundtrack that far exceeds the accomplishments of the film itself. Syrewicz's other notes of work are the sountracks to THE CLANDESTINE MARRIAGE, NORA, SEPARATE LIES and THE HOLCROFT COVENANT.",1181692800,,1232,4.980582524271845
1630425,5,B00005N911,"This movie takes you on a grand, childhood, adventure. You are right along in this wonderful story; back in the days of horses, swords, nobles, peasants, thieves, castles, kings, and adventurous children. The 1937, version, with Errol Flynn is also very good. I enjoyed them both.

The adventures of a poor young boy in England in the 1500's, a prince, a musketeer, and villains, and I can't say more without giving away the plot. Written by Mark Twain, who wrote Tom Sawyer; just as good.

Other good period, adventure movies are ""Tom Brown's School Days 1935"", ""David Copperfield 1940 & 2000"", ""Oliver Twist"", ""At Swords Point 1952"", ""The Adventures of Tom Sawyer 1938"", ""The Three Musketeers 1939"", and ""The Scarlet Pimpernel 1935"".",1155945600,2,735,5.016393442622951
1630426,3,B00005N911,"If you are looking for a good adventure movie to watch with your family, this one definitely rates five stars.

If, however, you have read the original novel and have great respect for the writing of Mark Twain, you will hate this movie. Several reviewers have rated this version as the best of all the P&P movies. If this one is the best, I don't even want to think about the others.

On the plus side, the movie is, as stated, a good adventure family-type movie. It gives a vivid portrayal of medieval England, both the pomp and the grunge. It has plenty of action, fun, pathos, and a happy ending but also deals with the brutality, intolerance and political scheming of the age. The twins who play Prince Edward and Tom Canty are very good -- much more honestly expressive and far less hammy than most of the adult actors. They are attractive and personable without, thank God, being just-too-cute-for-words kid actors.

Now for the axe. I do not and never will understand why people who adapt books for movies think that they are better writers than the original authors and can take whatever liberties they like with the plots and story lines. I do understand that it is almost impossible to film a book without leaving out many details and even characters and I can tolerate that. What I cannot tolerate, however, is the outright changing and destroying of as much of the original story as these screenwriters have done, not only weakening it but making certain situations absurd as well as inaccurate. Thus this movie is simply not Mark Twain's imaginative, sometimes biting and brutally frank, often hilarious statement for social justice.

So -- by all means buy the movie or rent it if you want an evening of family entertainment. But avoid it like the plague if you are looking for an adjunct to the reading/study of Mark Twain's wonderful novel.",1151539200,50,1857,4.704615384615384
1630427,5,B00005N911,"I am happy to report that this is not only better than the other movie versions of The Prince and the Pauper, but that it is a very good movie.

The 1937 version (a.k.a. ""the Errol Flynn version"") is quite good, but the ending was boggled by the introduction of an unnecessary and unhelpful delaying action, which was then made worse by being repeated (!), dispelling the high tension of the climactic end.  The twins who played the lead were very appealing but were made to speak in a very phony (sickeningly sweet) way.  There are also technical limitations, such as the sound quality.  I'd give it 4 stars.

The 1978 version with an all-star cast had much going for it.  The big stars all played their roles well, but the movie was ruined by using a 20 year-old boy to play the 12 year-old Prince.  And he was repellant as well.  Also, the ""rollicking"" scenes went on a bit too long and too often.  I'd give it 3 stars.

Fortunately (and for a change), the screenwriters learned from these past versions and this version is flawless.  The story rolled smoothly, not too fast, not slow, without repetitions or unnecessary delays or needless complications.  The twins who played the lead were appealing and played their parts well.  All of the cast were good.  The color, the photography, the music, the sound--all good.  The ending was just right.  This version also added a coda in which the Prince of Wales kept his various promises made to the several poor people who had been kind to him.

Bottom line: Don't miss it.  Also, the whole family can enjoy this one.",1142208000,63,1567,4.575539568345324
1630428,3,B00005N911,"Everyone is no doubt familiar with Mark Twain's classic work of two boys (one a prince, the other a pauper) exchanging identities. In this latest film remake of The Prince and The Pauper (put out by Hallmark Entertainment) we are given an interesting spin on the story. The story line stays intact but subtle emphasis is placed on the two characters' fathers.
  Prince Edward (Johnathan Timmons) and Tom Canty (Robert Timmons) have fathers that are mirror images of one another as the boys. Both sires exhibit a contempt for women, greed and an insatiable desire to control. Tenderness and mercy are not in the vocabulary of either the king nor the thief.
  When the  young boys exchange clothes they see the reality of life from both sides of the palace walls. Edward is confronted with poverty, unjust laws and the oppression of his father's terror. Tom witnesses the oppulance of the court, endless power plays and the ceaseless back biting. Both boys find themselves having to come to terms with their heritage and doing what they feel is just and right.
  You won't find superb acting. The Timmons brothers do an adequate job in portraying the two characters. Miles (Aiden Quinn) shows a deep empathy for the pauper who is Edward. Alas the poor boy is mad thinking he is a prince then a king. Miles goes along with the game but after awhile is challenged by Edward to move beyond his own disillusions.
  This is another good family video. It is entertaining and enjoyable. Mark Twain would no doubt enjoy this rendition of his work.",1014854400,5,1537,4.7481203007518795

1630507,4,B00005N911,"The movie was fantastic and showed many details.  It related to the book somewhat, but left out characters, changed characters, and changed up scenes.  The movie also added more details.  For example, Lady Edith in the novel was changed to Sarah.  Otherwise, the movie was good.  The sound in the movie is clear and the color is very vibrant.  Although in the novel, you may find scenes described more carefully.

-Joanna

I personally believe that The Prince and The Pauper movie was spectacular.  The graphics, voice, and clothes were very good.  Although, in the movie Miles Hendon ends up Marrying Sarah instead of Lady Edith, and Hugo never even comes in.  A boy steals the pig, throws it at Edward and runs.  That part I was a little disappointed at.  Another thing I was disappointed about was that no ""crazed"" archangel was shown.  Everything else was amazing.  I would yes indeed recommend for someone to watch this movie.

-Morgan

The movie was okay.  If your an action fan I recommend to not watch the movie because, like the book, Tom is very merciful.  First of all, there is only about three action scenes.  Second of all, there was no blood and it did not show any death.  In my opinion, I didn't really like the movie.  There wasn't really any ""wow"" moment in, ""The Prince and The Pauper,"" movie.

-Joshua

The movie the Prince and the Pauper is based on the famous novel the Prince and the Pauper by Mark Twain.  Like many other movies, there are parts in which the novel doesn't have or is missing parts.  For an example, in both the movie and novel, Tom rules wisely, Miles becomes Edward's friend and John Canty is still an evil villain.  Unlike the novel, the movie made Lord Hertford, the royal protector, and tried to take over the king, and how Nan and Bet, Tom's sisters are supposed to be twins and older than Tom.  In my opinion, the movie and novel are related, but completely different stories on their own.

-Faith

The Prince and The Pauper movie was very different from the novel.  The most important part of the movie and novel was the royal seal.  In the movie Edward doesn't hide the royal seal, but in the novel he does.  That is a very big difference because in the novel that is how Edward proves that he is king.  I recommend this movie to anyone who has read the book, but it is not the best.

-Grace

In the story and movie there was a lot of things that happen in the story then in the movie.  In the beginning of the story they talk about how Tom's grandmother and father are drunks and beat up Tom, but in the movie it was just his father that would be drunk and beat Tom up.  Another thing in the story is that Miles true love is Lady Edith, but in the movie it was Sarah.  When Miles and Edward go to jail, Edward meets two ladies who were accused of being witches, then they were burned to death, but in the movie it was only one lady that Edward met.  I did like this movie.  I like how the actors looked, dressed, and talked like they were from London in the 1500's.  What I did not like is when in the book they said so much information, but the movie took so much of it out.  When John Canty kills Father Andrew.  Also when Hugo had a sword fight with Edward.  And in the movie Miles and Edward have a mud fight, but everything else was good.  Hope you like it.  Have a good time.
