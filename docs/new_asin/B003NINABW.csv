8401182,4,B003NINABW,"Oh, what a tangled web they weave ... which is not fair, because they never intended to deceive - it was thrust upon them.

Series 1: Great premise and execution.  Donald is anticipating a promotion, and Caroline is looking to re-boot her career after raising a family.  Neither expected to end up on the wrong side of a corporate policy: lie or lose their jobs.

Series 2 & 3 (also very well done):
Peter Bowles replaces Geoffrey Palmer.  The rumor mill is alive and well, and the gossip is quite creative!

***** When will this be released on Region 1?  Reliable region-free players are beyond my budget.",1499558400,,606,4.607476635514018

8401185,5,B003NINABW,Anything with Penelope Keith in it gets my vote - The Good Life/To the Manor born - she is just delightful. I doubt if this type of comedy could be done in this pathetically politically correct age.,1398211200,2,198,4.378378378378378

8401187,4,B003NINABW,"Penelope Keith is wonderful in any British sitcom she has been in. Loved this program - BUT - when is this going to be released on USA format !!!??? Only time I have been able to watch this is when my local PBS channel broadcasts it - last time was 2 years ago.

Please release on USA format. Thank you!",1364428800,5,303,4.05
8401188,5,B003NINABW,"Geoffrey Palmer and Penelope Keith star as a husband and wife who, through company mergers, find themselves working for the same company.  However company policy does not allow husbands and wives to both be employed with this company.  The show follows the antics of each as they try to function as strangers at work while still remaining married at home.  Nice series for those who enjoy or might enjoy British comedy.",1357171200,4,419,4.873239436619718

8401190,4,B003NINABW,"I adore Penelope Keith and have purchased all of her sitcoms that have been out on USA format ... lot of USA folks have watched with delight ""Executive Stress"" on our local PBS channels over the years ... PLEASE - bring out on USA format too so we can purchase!",1290384000,9,261,4.24
8401191,4,B003NINABW,"Penelope Keith's fans have long campaigned to get this series released on DVD, and finally here it is!  EXECUTIVE STRESS was written by George Layton, cleverly based on real-life experience when his wife decided to resume her professional career after raising their children.

Penelope Keith stars as Caroline Fairchild, who has well and truly developed a bad case of the ""empty nest syndrome"".  Married to Donald (Geoffrey Palmer), the sales & marketing director of Oasis Publishing, Caroline's role as the ""woman behind the man"" is getting stale.  She decides to re-enter the publishing scene herself, but Oasis frowns on married couples working together.  Caroline takes up her maiden name of Fielding and applies anyway, creating a fictional ""husband"" stationed in Saudi Arabia and installing a separate telephone line at the house.  As Caroline Fielding, she's Oasis Publishings' brightest new editorial director.  But as Donald's wife...?!?  Caroline and Donald's quest to maintain their married life AND Caroline's separate ""career identity"" at the same time forms the main basis for this delightful series.

EXECUTIVE STRESS ran for three years on ITV, and was also highly popular on the ABC in Australia.  Penelope Keith's ""To the Manor Born"" leading man Peter Bowles replaced Geoffrey Palmer as Donald beginning in the second series (a casting move which also refreshingly shook up the overall look and pace of the show).  Elizabeth Counsell, Harry Ditson and Hilary Gish are the main co-stars for this debut year.  Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice wrote the charming theme song (""Remember Why We Fell in Love""), which was performed by Julie Covington, a frequent Lloyd Webber ""interpreter"".  The DVD includes all seven episodes from the first series.",1284422400,10,1761,5.2913669064748206
