8619306,4,B00FXSI95M,"It seems similar to another film about Tibet,""The Cry of the Snow Lion"", but not as brutal still it shows what Tibet is going through and still we have to to say  WHY?. How selfish can another country be?",1468713600,,204,4.230769230769231

8619308,5,B00FXSI95M,"A poignant and insightful look at the victim/victimizer game that is playing out on the lands of Tibet. Interesting to learn the various Tibetan perspectives, especially those that contrast with the Dalai Lama. Before this movie I was not very clear on the role he plays in the governing of the people of Tibet. It's a kind of religious monarchy. So, I understand how Chinese propaganda gets traction in Communist China by portraying China as liberators of Tibetans from religious oppression. Not endorsing either perspective ... just appreciating how this movie helped me understand the gap between the Chinese and Tibetan perspectives.

Meanwhile, there is an actual monarch also living in exile. His perspective and sharing in this film was probably the most poignant of all. The burden of expectations ... ironically limiting his freedom. The weight of the assumption that his life's work is to ensure the freedom of his people, his country was profound. Think about that for a second ... how does that work? He is expected to create freedom by sacrificing his own freedom. He's exiled in India. Maybe he can take some council from the words of Gandhi ""Be the change that you expect to see in the world""

Also, interesting were the threads of violence vs. non-violent philosophies as well as western economically-driven foreign policy that wove through this important film. The backdrop for the film was the 2008 Beijing Olympics and how that amplified the focus of the world on China. Protests organized to amplify the focus on Tibet triggered a lot of the narrative.
