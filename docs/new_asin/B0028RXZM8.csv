8356721,5,B0028RXZM8,"It was very funny and very educational. He and his USO tour did 22 bases in 15 days. Its fresh and funny and a little heart rending. If you want your kids (I recommend tweens and above because they use a lot of vavavavooom to make the soldiers happy) to get an idea of what it was like in the 70's besides the long side burns and Brady Bunch, this is a good place to dip a toe in the pool; real servicemen, real hospitals, real Dads holding up signs that they hope their kids will see when this movie makes it back to the states. Real Christmas in the jungle; real talk of the people who picketed the soldiers and not just the war. Real laughter and real hope. Also, really funny.",1358208000,,680,4.120300751879699
