8518427,5,B007JMG37G,"In the interest of full disclosure, this film is based on a short story of mine. That being said, I was thoroughly impressed when I saw the final product. Not only did Willy Adkins and Jason Sullivan bring to life most of what I had imagined, but sometimes they improved on it. For instance, the character of ""Roy"" was kind of a composite of the original campus security guard and the bumbling cameraman in my story. The result was a very memorable character played by Michael Schmid. For me, the character of Roy really made this entire film come to life. If you like short indie films, this is definitely for you!",1373760000,,615,4.5
