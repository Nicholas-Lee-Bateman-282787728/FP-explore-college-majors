8418593,4,B00489YLCW,"Like another reviewer stated, the form is poor but I find this form of yoga very interesting.  There are two 30 minute routines and I have yet to get through a 30 minute session but I enjoy doing about 15 minutes once or twice a week.  Essentially, I need a NON namaste type yoga to stretch out my muscles.

Update: PIYO is a better version of this DVD.",1439942400,,353,4.161764705882353
8418594,2,B00489YLCW,To my surprise the instructor on this DVD had very poor form. I also thought she could have been more creative with the weight part of the workout.,1313366400,6,147,4.285714285714286
8418595,5,B00489YLCW,I have done this workout several times and it's a very good yoga workout.  I have to accompolish some of her new moves and I am looking forward to that.,1302134400,,152,4.066666666666666
