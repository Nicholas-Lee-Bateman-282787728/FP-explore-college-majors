8183201,5,B000O75VBM,I was/am a Bonnie & Clyde historian and am a close friend of the Barrow family. As well I contributed time and a photo in the making of this documentary with Tim Leone the film's producer. Marie Barrow herself once told me this is the best documentary on Bonnie & Clyde ever made. I and most of the historians agree. Many of the people in the video were there when the ambush happened but sadly are now gone. This film contains some rare interviews never done before or after so it remains as a treasure trove of historical content. If you want to know the actual true story of Bonnie and Clyde and only own one video this is the one to own. I am proud of the contribution Tim let me make to the film.,1416096000,,701,4.161764705882353
8183202,5,B000O75VBM,"I wasn't too sure when I first thought of purchasing this DVD - - but I was pleasantly surprised how good it truly was !  The reseaching on this movie was thorough - - the digging up of old archives and extremely rare film footage from those who were there, or who knew Bonnie and Clyde personally, was probably the best thing about this DVD overall.  This is a really nice job for a documentary focusing on two pathetically poor and down-and-out young people who had nothing going for them in life, but because of what they did during their 2-years together, has seemed to immortalize them in the annals of gangster history in the 20th Century United States.",1315526400,,659,4.529411764705882
8183203,5,B000O75VBM,This is by far the best documentary you will see on Bonnie and Clyde !!!!!!,1284681600,2,75,4.066666666666666
8183204,5,B000O75VBM,"Although I pretty much knew everything presented in the DVD, it was interesting to see and hear some of the actual people involved with Bonnie and Clyde. I wish more information had been presented about Bonnie. Overall, I'd say it's a good resource for collectors of Bonnie and Clyde history.",1207526400,4,292,4.86
8183205,5,B000O75VBM,This DVD was a treat after many years of pouring through books and  photos!  My only complaint is that it was only a hour long...there was far more to see!  A must for all Bonnie and Clyde researchers and fans...a well worth addiction to any true crime collection!  Was also great to see news footage of W.D. Jones and to hear what Marie Barrow had to say about her brother Clyde and his girlfriend!,1192060800,14,399,4.351351351351352
8183206,4,B000O75VBM,"Although I did not learn much of anything new by watching this DVD, I enjoyed watching it immensely, especially the interview segments.  Overall, a worthwhile purchase, particularly for those with a keen interest in the story of Bonnie and Clyde.",1181260800,15,246,5.15
