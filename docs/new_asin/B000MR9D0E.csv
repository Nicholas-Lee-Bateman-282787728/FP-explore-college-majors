8171366,5,B000MR9D0E,"I find both DVDs great!  The Beginner one teaches in a professional and clear way all the different jumps and then has a workout at the end.  The Intermediate DVD has a fun workout and abs section.  Both are quality productions, with good pump music to keep you in rhythm.  I find the included rope a bit difficult to use (it tangles) and I have ordered a 'segmented' rope (like the ones they use in the DVDs), which apparently do not tangle and are easier to use.",1413763200,,464,4.2988505747126435
8171367,3,B000MR9D0E,"The information on the DVD is pretty good.  The only reason I'm rating it a 3 is because I'm not a good skipper.  I've had so many ""gashes"" on my arms from tripping on the rope.  Grrr..  The participants make it look so easy, so it is motivating to keep tying.",1333843200,,260,4.03921568627451

8171369,5,B000MR9D0E,"I am still working onthe basic video right now, but I have not jumproped for probably 15 years and I picked up this video and am now doing every jump with ease. I would definately recommend this video if you want to learn to jumprope-it works great!",1236816000,2,249,4.319148936170213
