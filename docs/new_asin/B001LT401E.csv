8319744,2,B001LT401E,The film quality is horrible. It is very grainy. The acting is bad. The zombies were not good zombies. The music was way too loud and wasn't good any way. Plus the DVD was a DVD-R. I didn't hate it. I just didn't like it,1266019200,,220,3.911111111111111
8319745,2,B001LT401E,"Recently I purchased The Sick and The Dead on the strength of the reviews it was receiving from those who have also purchased the film through Amazon vendors. However, I failed to notice what was so special about this film. Truth be told, the storyline is nothing to write home about, the acting is bad, and the setting is average at best. Yes, I realize it is a low-budget horror flick. That doesn't escape me. Be that as it may, this film simply failed to deliver anything even remotely comparable to the zombie films I appreciate, like Automaton Transfusion, Land of the Dead, Planet Terror, Evil, Versus, Undead, Day of the Dead, Flight of the Living Dead, Diary of the Dead, Zombietown, Mad, Dead Alive, Onechebara: Bikini Samurai Squad, Necroville, Redneck Zombies, Poutrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead, Dance of the Dead: Ghosthouse Underground, etc. This one, in my opinion, can be inserted into the mediocre zombie film archive. To rate this film from one to ten skulls---one being the worst, and ten the best---I would have to give it two, maybe two and a half skulls.",1261872000,4,1080,4.780748663101604

8319747,1,B001LT401E,"Scatophillia is a ""thing"" I have never fully understood.  Some people are into it, though.  For that select crowd, this movie is for you!

I am the greatest zombie movie fan ever born (I was actually an extra in the original Dawn of the Dead), but this doesn't qualify as a ""horror"" or ""zombie"" (the effects wouldn't fool a challenged third grader) or ""acting"".  It's shot on tape, negligibly scripted and stars (""stars?"") an astonishing collection of wooden fence posts as actors.  This is feces on a a shiny shiny DVD.",1247184000,6,520,4.670329670329671
8319748,4,B001LT401E,This movie is crazy and you will know it when you watch it. My favirte parts is all the fights with zombies and all the extra fteatures behind the scenes because they are having so much fun and you know it. There is even scenes from a other movie in the behind the scenes thats even crazyer. That is my friends favrite part. I watched it the second time with him because he likes zombies alot to. I would give this four stars.,1233705600,,426,4.144578313253012
8319749,3,B001LT401E,"I was lucky enough to see this film on the big screen. There's a good bit of humor between and the zombie stomping scenes.  I'm glad it has made the rounds of horror and zombie festivals and is now available on DVD, just in time for Valentine's Day!",1233532800,2,249,4.1875
8319750,5,B001LT401E,"Way better than the last few big-budget zombie movies I've seen. In fact, I nearly swore off the whole genre after viewing the ""Day of the Dead"" remake, but ""Sick and the Dead"" has restored my faith in flesh-eaters. You can tell the budget must have been very low, but the zombies look awesome, and the many kills are a lot of fun!",1230595200,4,331,4.26984126984127
8319751,5,B001LT401E,"Some people say that a fine spring day while riding a unicorn is perfect....I'd disagree, Sick And The Dead makes springtime unicorn riding look like a trip to the abortionist!!",1230508800,,177,4.933333333333334
8319752,5,B001LT401E,"When I attended the world premier of this film in Durham, NC I was hoping to see lots of zombies and if that's what you want, that's what you'll get! Unlike most zombie films, this film takes place after the Zombie invasion focusing on the survivors and their plight to live on another day. A great zombie flick done on a cost effective budget.  I have nothing but praise for the fine makers of this film.  Perhaps I just like zombie or post-apocalyptic fiction, either way I can't wait to see what they do next.",1229731200,4,512,4.378947368421053
