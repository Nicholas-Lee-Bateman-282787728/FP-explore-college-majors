7912678,1,B00000JMP1,"If you're searching for the best martial arts movie featuring Cynthia Khan, give this one a miss as the martial arts choreography doesn't present her with the opportunity to showcase her skills. You'd do better watching In Line of Duty IV.",1377129600,,239,4.853658536585366
7912679,1,B00000JMP1,"The commentator spoke too much for the length of the dvd.  The bloopers weren't that funny for the entire dvd.  None the less, there were a lot of goals to see and yet, they were not exciting.",1283472000,,192,4.162162162162162
7912680,4,B00000JMP1,"I started out watching this series backwards so i seen part 4 before i seen this one and it really doesn't compare. Yuen woo ping choreographed In the Line of Duty IV so its a no brainer that it would be way better than this. I mean you could get up and go to the bathroom and not miss much. The best thing about this movie is the ending fight scene. The robbers in the movie are really good and just for some reason always have machine guns on hand. They are really tough fighters for the police to go up against and they usually spray up the whole place with like Mac 11's in every scene they're in.

Pros: Ending fight scene, Robbers.

Cons: At times it seems more of a drama with not enough action for me, Some of the dumb things police do in the movie.

Its a must have if you are collecting the series from when Michelle Yeoh was doing it. I'll give it 4 stars cuz i like the series.",1275264000,,889,4.0397727272727275
7912681,4,B00000JMP1,"Seminal film in the modern Hong Kong action film series, notable for the debut of Cynthia Khan, who had the unenviable task to replace the ""retired"" Michelle Khan(Yeoh), who starred in the previous installments.
In a bloody beginning, a pair of stylish Japanese thieves steal some valuable gems.  In a harrowing scene, during their escape, they kill the partner of a ruffled detective (think Columbo with a Chuck Barris hairdo). The detective swears revenge, and the thieves (played by the athletic and lovely Michiko Nishiwaki and her terminally ill partner/lover played by Stuart Ong) plan on going to Hong Kong, selling the loot and then buying weapons for the Red Army. All the while Cynthia, a rookie cop in Hong Kong, is seeking criminal busting action, but is discouraged by her uncle(?) who leads her task force. The Japanese thieves and the detective trailing them, all make their way to Hong Kong, and Cynthia ends up entangled in the same mess with the detective, trying to bring the cold blooded and desperate thieves to justice. People on both sides are killed, leading to crossed paths of personal revenge, everyone out for each others blood.
The action, typical of the genre, is fast, bloody, and brutal, both Cynthia and Michicko are firecrackers and, in addition to being very easy on the eyes, display some great kicks and punches. The fight scenes, particularly the finale, are directed in a rapid paced, almost too fast, blink and you'll miss it fashion. Highly entertaining film. The DVD is very good by Hong Kong action standards, bright picture, sharp, no noticable audio problems. Contains the usual extras like brief star bios and action film trailers.",973641600,8,1677,4.989285714285714
