7913666,5,B00000JX0S,"Most of this video has to do with Rachmaninoff's battle with depression after his Symphony #1 was trashed by the critics.  After his treatment by Dr. Dahl, a hypnotherapist, Rachmaninoff was able to write his most famous work--Piano Concerto #2 in C minor.
Using musical examples,photographs and interspersed with commentary by Jon Kimura-Parker, Pinchas Zuckerman and others, we learn about how Rachmaninoff was able to overcome his personal problems.  Also included is a very simple, but excellent demonstration (by Kimura-Parker) of how Rachmaninoff took Paganini's Caprice for violin, and made the beautiful 18th Variation from ""Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini.""
And, one cannot say enough about Kimura-Parker's performances of the various pieces by Rachmaninoff, especially the Concerto #2.  He and Zuckerman (as conductor) work well together, and the lovely and melodious final movement is just perfect.
If this video was only longer...but it is fabulous!  Highly and enthusiastically recommended!",975283200,15,1003,5.666666666666667
