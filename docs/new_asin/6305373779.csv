7889483,3,6305373779,"This program spoke about ppl who are HIV-positive but living absolutely healthy lives.  It even spoke about HIV-positive patients on meds who go off the meds to see if or how long they will survive.  I am sure at the time it was informative to let the public know that some HIV-positive ppl are relatively healthy.  It shows that AIDS doesn't have to be seen as a death sentence.  However, I remembered at the time that news reports said the ppl they knew who seemed unhurt by the virus were all entirely of European descent.  In short, articles at the time suggested they knew of no Black, Latino, Native, or Asian person who was HIV-positive but living a completely unhampered life.  Here too all the ppl viewed were of Caucasian heritage, but the programs says NOTHING of it.  I felt this may have been a tragic blind spot.
For other reasons, this program feels dated.  The program never mentions HAART meds, thus I am assuming they didn't exist at the time of this video production.  Those meds are helping patients, of all races by the way, to live 20 or more years with the virus.  This better cocktail has helped similarly to make it not seem like AIDS is a death sentence.  Magic Johnson is still alive and healthy; this may be a great example of HAART med working wonders.  Sadly, however, some think that Magic's existence proves that HIV can be cured, something that at this point is not true at all.
There is a celebrity who has HIV but hasn't been materially hurt by it:  Jm. J. Bullock.  He was interviewed on ""E! True Hollywood Stories.""  However, he is absent here.  I wonder if the program makers didn't ask him to interview or if he didn't want to at the time.",1426204800,,1678,4.488448844884489
