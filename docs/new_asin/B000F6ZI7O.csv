8118245,4,B000F6ZI7O,"this video is amazing, it explains everything so clearly. I'm just slightly dissapointed because I'm a very busy woman with tons to do, and I wanted to get my permit so I could finally learn to drive, and being as busy as I am, I needed a faster way to learn the information that reading more than 100 pgs of the manual. They made it sound like if you watch this and take notes and all, you could abandon your drivers manual and pass your DMV written test the first time. It is not so. After I watched this video I took practice tests online and the results were bad. They seriously didn't teach lots from the drivers manual. But they also TAUGHT a lot and the way they make the video makes the information really stick well, and you remember it. So, if the reason you're getting this is to get away with not reading the drivers manual, it will help you a lot, but not enough. Still, 95% recommended. If you are getting it to help you remember the info you already read, a million percent recomended.",1335484800,2,1000,4.296296296296297

8118247,5,B000F6ZI7O,"Our Learning Center Purchased the item for an adult learner that was studying for her Driving Test.  She and her tutor used the DVD several times  and she passed the test.  The visual/audio helped her to understand what they had been trying to comprehend from the written driving manual and this was just the tool to help her understand.

I am sure we will have other tutors and learners that will find this a great help when studying for the Califronia driving test.",1162512000,2,467,4.590361445783133
