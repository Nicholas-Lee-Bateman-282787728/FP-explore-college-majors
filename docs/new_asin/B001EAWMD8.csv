8297475,2,B001EAWMD8,"I know several people loved this movie, based on the reviews I see here now. I'm here to tell you it is NOT for everyone.

A guy and his wife travel to the home of his ex-friend - her ex-lover - for the weekend. Their marriage is troubled. She is tempted by her ex, he is tempted by the ex's new fling, a silly-acting married woman who likes to run around naked.

You see lots of dream sequences with water and several scenes around the lake. The symbolism is tired and nothing new. He's drowning in his wife, his obsession, his lack of confidence... The list goes on and on.

I can do foreign films that are engaging, but this one was just too much for me. It is dull, the film is green throughout, and it was excruciating at times to watch. Perhaps a bottle (or ten) of red wine would have made it better.",1230854400,3,807,4.160256410256411
