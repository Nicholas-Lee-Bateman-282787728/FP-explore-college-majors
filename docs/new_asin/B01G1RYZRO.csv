7753128,3,B01G1RYZRO,"Sniper: Ghost Shooter is the fifth film in the action franchise about elite sniper Brandon Beckett (Chad Michael Collins), son of the late legendary Thomas Beckett (played in the earlier films by Tom Berenger). Beckett and fellow sniper Richard Miller (Billy Zane) are fighting extremists in the Middle East when Colonel (Dennis Haysbert) assigns them a new mission: protect a gas pipeline stretching between the Republic of Georgia and Western Europe from terrorists. When skirmishes with the enemy lead to U.S. snipers being killed by a shooter who locks onto their exact location, a security breach is suspected.

Sniper: Ghost Shooter is the ultimate popcorn flick  lots of action, explosions galore, and endless gunfire. Almost a live-action cartoon, it doesnt delve into character but presents one action sequence after another. A token love scene is quickly overshadowed by testosterone-driven conflict.

Though entirely fictional, the film resonates in a world of increasing terrorist attacks. The script is simplistic in its portrayals of good and bad guys, with little nuance.

There are no bonus features on the widescreen DVD release.",1470096000,11,1146,5.421348314606742
7753129,5,B01G1RYZRO,"Better storyline than last ""Sniper"" movie.  Great action and cinematography.  Well worth watching.",1470096000,4,98,6.461538461538462

7753131,2,B01G1RYZRO,"""Every sniper hesitated, but only once."" Brandon Beckett (Collins) is still struggling living in his father's shadow. While out on a mission he is about to take his shot when a child shows up. Brandon freezes and he doesn't take the shot things go south. The terrorist is free, and members of his group begin to take out soldiers in Beckett's squad. Brandon must once again try and live up to his name and fix his mistake. This is not a bad movie, but being the 6th one in the series you really can't expect a whole lot from this. The plot isn't that bad and the drama keeps you interested somewhat, but the real downside of this movie is that it is just so slow moving and boring in some parts that I found my mind wandering and I even started to doze off a few times watching it. That to me is not the sign of a good movie. Again though, when the 5th sequel comes out you have to lower your expectations. Overall, nothing amazing and not a huge drop off from the previous movies from the series but the movie just lacked heart and excitement, and that really hurt it. I give this a C.",1470009600,,1086,4.2009569377990434
7753132,3,B01G1RYZRO,"This is another story in the life of Gunnery Sgt. Brandon Beckett  (Chad Michael Collins) and Richard Miller (Billy Zane). The characters have been introduced in a previous film:""Sniper: Reloaded-2011"".

They are part of an elite sniper group. The film starts out in Syria, then Turkey, and finally ends up in Georgia where our team is tasked to protect the building of a gas line to connect Georgia to Ukraine. Beckett suspects the Georgians working with the US are supplying the enemy with co-ordinates due to some recent killings (new people in landing party).

The movie has a lot of sniper style killing. If people looking through a scope and taking the head shot is your kind of film, this is it. Plot is straight forward.

7753139,5,B01G1RYZRO,"This film is WAY above a clich shoot em up production.  The plot is more sophisticated, the enemy is on par with the good guys, acting is good, even for Billy Zane.
Without giving away any spoilers, here are a couple of inaccuracies:  when deployed in the snow, the snipers are wearing green uniforms.  Should be white.
Why not use a combined, but independent air intelligence between drones, high flying planes and satellites?
Perhaps, the military advisors for the filmmakers were not too good?
Nevertheless, I would highly recommend this film for connoisseurs of action spy thrillers.",1505606400,,587,5.030927835051546

I really appreciate the latter detail, because it adds some new dimensions to the action. A good example is when the main character is being disciplined for a transgression and he is sent to the snow-covered mountains on the Russian border. That's a nice break from what lately seems an endless series of military action films set in the Middle East. I hope they make another in the Sniper series.",1476748800,,553,4.711340206185567

7753199,5,B01G1RYZRO,"Sniper Ghost Shooter was excellent.  One of my top 10 films of 2016.  Had a big production feel to it (I mean like $100 million big budget feel to it).  I was happy to see much of the cast from Sniper Legacy return, like Dennis Haysbert, Dominic Mafha, etc..., and I hope they continue to return for future films in this franchise.  They are really solid actors and bring a lot to the stories.  I watched this on my 70 inch big screen, and was thinking just how amazing this film would be on a big screen at the movies.  Really great cinematography and locales, great shots, special effects, and the Sniper action is just great (An extended sniper battle in the snow is a real tense treat here).  The story is great, and the script is well written.  The only character miscast I thought was Stephanie Vogt as Robin (she just had no presence on the screen and was a bit annoying).  One of the themes explored in this film are the moral quandaries of being a sniper, dealing with uncertainty in a situation where a moments hesitation means certain death.

I just wish they would make this into a real big budget series bc I think the producers and directors of the SNIPER series take the stories and films seriously and really put out great product sylistically, and action wise, and I also believe there is a strong market for this now.  I fully and whole heartedly recommend everyone see Ghost Shooter.  Fantastic addition to the Series.",1474848000,3,1437,4.505791505791506

The performances are stiff and can be ""eye-rolling"" Billy Zane, what happened to him? He is the bet thing in this but still very deadpan. No emotion is anywhere on this movie. The Colonel, the man who sends them on missions I also better than this. The STAR is Chad Michael Collins and if given the chance I think that he could actually act. God forbid he smiles! And then we get the usual big chested female who can't act and she is in charge and she knows all. Why do we do this? Stick with what you know.

7753217,5,B01G1RYZRO,"Okay, this is a good vid. FIVE stars might be stretching it a bit but, I'm sure that many of you out there is a fan of the ""Sniper"" inception. Years ago the original Sniper came out with Tom Berringer behind the cross hairs. The movie (at that time) was a hit because the idea of taking out villains that were so evil, that they had forfeited their right to live for being humanitarian monsters. The bad guy ""had it coming."" So, without stooping to their level and just making a five mile crater in the earth to get the bad guy --that would surely cause harm to innocents that just had the misfortune of being near the monster-- another course of action must be used to surgically remove the offender. Often times these despots would surround themselves with human barriers. These sitting ducks were put there; often times, without a choice. So, movie goers get their first glimpse into the lives of these highly specialized breed of soldiers: The Sniper. The gillie suits, the incredibly slow approach and set up. The incremental adjustments made for windage and elevation.. The stealth and other forms of camouflage were devised to rid the world of one less bad guy. Moviegoers were amazed at the intricacies. In a perfect world, the Sniper would move in...one shot...and then disappear like a ghost as the last echoes of the single strike died rebounding from all directions. Where did the shot come from!? Were the crosshairs settling even now on someone else? The panic and sheer terror was USUALLY enough to cover the Sniper as he retreated. Berringer played this part so very well. In real life Barringer is not a big man, but on the screen...he was Death in the shadows.
  But the man behind the scope had to live with his horrific job. Quite a few soldiers could put on the suit and camouflage and creep around until they have the target in sight...sometimes the realization of what all the hours, days, months, even years of training did not quite prepare them when they could actually see the PERSON'S eyes in their sights. It was not a paper target. This was was not an exercise. They'd been drilled time and again to be ready for this very moment. But there is no real way to get a soldier ready to take a life. All the crazies that were a bit to happy about killing had been fazed out long ago. Immoral people have no business in The Hide. A situation where recklessness, and bloodthirsty nature would be the death of all involved. No, the only person that actually detested murder, could be a real life-taker.
  Alright, so the first sniper was a huge success. The sequel was ALMOST as good. Barringer's character had lost his trigger finger, so it was his job to train someone else to set behind the scope.
  Then the next movie...well, kinda lost it's momentum. Movie goers were getting tired of the painstakingly slow hunt; the build up to that final moment of retribution. Especially after the middle east crisis, where REAL snipers were using the very same techniques...and rarely was their mission in a perfect world. The extreme danger of being a lone trigger man, along with his spotter and a few highly trained rearguard often didn't get away.
  Zane has turned out to be a very capable actor. He's a big guy. And he can ACT! Life is breathed into a series that should have stopped after the first couple. After a recent role based on the atrocities in Darfur, Zane has become skilled at performing this sort of character. And in this latest ""Ghost Shooter"" as Berringers character comes full circle as his own son begins the lessons of being the stalker in the shadows.
  Good job.",1472860800,4,3606,4.6203125

8761913,1,B01G1RYZRO,"This movie got on my nerves on SO many levels, I was in the Army for 20 years (retired three years ago) so speaking from a vet and two deployments to Iraq this movie really was so far from reality, here are a few reason, (not all, I haven't finished watching it though but I was so irritated I had to comment)
1.  Females are not even allowed to go to sniper training, I'm sure that will change eventually, but I guess a movie with all men wouldn't have been a ""seller""
2.  No body goes ""outside"" the wire with civilian clothes and baseball hats turned backward, they wear eye protection, Kevlar helmets,
3.  Female colonels do not give briefing dressed up in tight pants and unbuttoned shirts with their long blond hair flowing, your hair has to be in a ponytail or a bun and it cannot go past your collar.
4.  BlackWater is no longer allowed to operate in any place of combat, because the were not military, they did not feel that they had to follow the ""rules of engagement"" that the military did, so they ran ""amok"" until they were banned.
5.  We did not take orders nor take any lip from any Russian soldiers
That's it for now, I'll see if I can get through the rest of the movie",1528675200,,1184,4.2444444444444445
8761914,4,B01G1RYZRO,"When you consider some of the other movies in the Sniper series, this isn't half bad.  Tom Berenger is not in this but in no way does that lessen the movie.

All in all, decent action, mediocre acting and an okay story.",1527292800,,219,4.190476190476191
