1062263,5,6305562822,"This is an absolute delight.  We see Jane as an adventurous teen stowaway on an ocean liner with dad Brent being the Captain who relegates her to the kitchen where she has the whole staff involved in an ""Alouette, Gente Alouette"" to die for.  Who ever dreamed that number up was a genious.  We also get to hear her sing Manon's Gavotte, and beautifully as she's trying to impress Melchior who plays (what else) an opera singer.  But Melchior had already left so the gavotte was in vain.  Later she gets to impress him with some operatic allusions in a fantastic version of ""Peanut Vendor"" with Cugat.  Melchior sings Wagner, a drinking song, and a final duet with Jane.

Another enjoyable Powell musical is Holiday in Mexico.",1249171200,2,725,4.661417322834645
1062264,3,6305562822,"This is a charming but minor MGM musical in glorious Technicolor. Even in the oeuvre of Jane Powell it ranks below her best pictures, 7 Brides for 7 Brothers and Royal Wedding. However, caveat emptor, buyer beware! This disc is part of the new Warner Archive Collection and is a ""burned"" DVD-R video-on-demand disc, as oppsed to a professionally stamped and pressed DVD.  The discs in this collection have been somehow encrypted to work on ""play only"" devices and will not work on player/recorders or on computers. That said, it is nice to have these rare titles available and the quality is quite good from original, if unrestored, elements.",1242518400,5,642,4.889908256880734
1062265,3,6305562822,"A winner for Jane Powell. This movie was done back in the 40's before she got the 50's look. Except also in Holiday in Mexico, she never looked so beautiful. This time though she does a scene or two in braids and looks adorable. As a movie it's a filler, but a fine one. Jane Powell sneaks onto her father's trip in order to meet her favorite opera singer. On the way the both of them fall in love, her father results in a marriage, hers she admits a ""passing fling"". The guy has an eerie similarity to Joey Lawrence.
Marina Koshetz, the supporting actress, almost steals the show as an annoying opera singer. Her performance of I've got you under my skin was funny.",1069372800,18,666,4.336
1062266,4,6305562822,"LUXORY LINER is a cute movie with terrific singers and a weak plot which serves primarily as a platform for the excellent musical entertainment. Jane Powell sparkles as the daughter of a widowed ship captain. She is a passenger on her father's ship and she spends most of her time either trying to manage her father's love life or else attempting to advance her budding career as a singer.
The film is worth a high rating based mostly on the outstanding music. Jane Powell, Lauritz Melchior, Xavier Cugat and Marina Koshetz complement each other well. They are ably backed up by George Brent, Frances Gifford, Connie Gilchrist and Richard Derr.",1059523200,7,644,4.863636363636363
1062267,5,6305562822,"i  very highly recommend this film, and think it's fun and entertaining.  Jane Powell really shines in it.",1034035200,3,106,4.833333333333333
1062268,4,6305562822,"Color, beautiful clothes, romance and great location don't always spell success for a movie. You also have to care about the people and be interested enough in the story to continue watching. This movie has all of the above and more. Pretty people, scenes, colors, clothes, enjoyable storyline. It also has romantic excitement with old fashioned values. Actions and words of the characters seem natural and therefore flow well.
There's beautifully sung music if you enjoy that sort of thing; but if you can't handle it, just fast forward a bit. I had forgotten that Jane Powell had real musical talent as I had forgotten she was in ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers."" The other leading lady is pretty too, and believable. George Brent seems perfect as a middle-aged ship captain, just a bit tired out by life. The older man (real-life tenor) is rather enjoyable to watch and a joy to hear sing. After the movie is over you'll feel nostalgic for a more civilized era.",1020297600,25,965,4.7844311377245505
1062269,5,6305562822,"Top talents and colorful production numbers make this an effervescent, light-hearted musical cruiz in the great tradition of the MGM musicals.
On board are the the ships's captain (George Brent) and his spunky daughter, Polly (Jane Powell).  When stow-away, Polly, is discovered by the captain, she is given custodial duties which she uses to her advantage to play Cupid to some of the ship's passengers. She discovers that tenor, Lauritz Melchior, is also on board and she uses every opportunity to show him her own musical talents.  Meanwhile, Francis Gifford and Marina Koshetz vie for the captains attention and complications arise.
Jane opens with the lovely ""Spring Came Back to Vienna"" and later sings ""Alouette"" assisted by the talented kitchen crew.  Her musical prowess is displayed in ""The Peanut Vendor"" and the lilting ""Gavotte"" by Massenet.  Mr. Melchior gives us ""Come  Back to Sorrento"" and an aria from ""Aida"" in his rich tenor voice.  Xavier Cugat shares his latin rhythms with ""Cugat's Nougat"" and ""Con Maracas"".  The Pied Pipers are on hand for ""Yes, We Have No Bananas"" and the cruise closes with a reprise duet of ""Spring Came Back to Vienna"" with the youthful Powell and the renowned Melchior.
All aboard for a musical outing with mirth and joyful singing.",972000000,18,1279,5.033175355450237
1062381,5,6305562822,I saw this movie on TV for the first time this spring.  It was so good.  I don't know if my Mom has seen this movie or not but in my book it is a must see.  So I bought it for my Mom for Christmas.  Love Jane Powell,1417564800,,215,3.326530612244898

1062384,5,6305562822,"I saw this movie in 1947. As a 17 year old lad, I fell in love with Jane Powell.  I saw the movie 7 times. I also loved Lauritz Melchoir.
I was also a Tenor myself, so I admired him very much. I have often thought how nice it would be to write to Jane Powell and tell her how much pleasure she has given me through the film. My wife and I watched it together and she enjoyed it as much as I.  We have been married 64 years  last March 18th.  Thank you for sending the film to me.
Sincerely,

1062385,3,6305562822,Jane Powell playing little miss fix it again and being quite obnoxious in the process. It is obvious that Pasternak was trying to emulate the Durbin character. However the singing and music is acceptable and Lauritz Melchior is a bonus. Harmless fun and Jane Powell showed a flair for comedy and mores the pity she was not used in this genre in later years,1393027200,,356,4.578125
1062386,5,6305562822,"This is such a fun story, Good and wholesome.

1062388,5,6305562822,"I love Jane Powell movies and this is one not to miss. Jane plays the golden-voiced teen daughter of an ocean liner captain who tows away on dad's ship in hopes of showcasing her singing talents to a voyaging opera star played by real-life Wagnerian Lauritz Melchoir. Other musical talents include Xavier Cugat, the Pied Pipers and operative soprano Marina Koshetz. This movie has lots of good music.",1366848000,,400,4.897058823529412
1062389,4,6305562822,"This is a beautifully shot movie and one of the limited opportunities to both hear and see Lauritz Melchior sing--the other one being ""Two Sisters from Boston."" These disks are produced on demand by the Warner Bros archive, so there is no printed information or additional electronic features. The story is thin and sweet, but any lover of Wagner will be amused to see and hear Melchior do a private performance of ""Winterstrme wichen dem Wonnemond"" for the chambermaid.",1365638400,,470,4.962025316455696

1062446,3,6305562822,"This is charming, cute and minor. It's enjoyable and a pleasant diversion-but not anywhere near close to the pricing put on the DVD.

1062448,4,6305562822,"I am a fan of George Brent, and even in later movies, I find he is still a versatile actor, and charming. All characters play their roles perfectly. A younger Jane Powell shows her stellar singing voice.",1301184000,4,203,4.513513513513513
1062449,4,6305562822,"Jane Powell made many cute MGM musicals, and this is one of the better ones. As with Rich Young and Pretty and Small Town Girl, these Warner Archive titles are of excellent quality.  They appear to have been worked on to some extent as colors are vibrant, and sound is clear with out hiss. These are quality releases. Go for all of them if you are into this type of old fashioned quality enbtertainment.",1294272000,,403,4.445945945945946
1062450,4,6305562822,"This is one of my all time favorite musicals.  I grew up watching it with my mother on a regular basis, so I may be a little bias.
Anyway, most people reading this have probably seen the movie already and are more curious about the quality of The Archive Collection and if it's actually a workable, quality DVD.... as I was before my purchase.  The Archive Collection consists of films with too little demand to make and sell in mass quantities, so they basically burn a copy for you upon your request for the merchandise.  I was worried it wouldn't play on my DVD player or be really poor quality.
I have 3 DVD players set up to test it on.  It worked on all but my VHS to DVD recorder.  I wasn't too worried about it because that is a machine meant to record VHS onto DVD anyway, but does play DVDs alone.  It worked fine on my computer and PS3.
The quality of the picture is about the same as a VHS tape, so it hasn't been re-worked and improved, which is fine by me.  I was worried it would be worse or super hazy, but it wasn't.
I'm just glad to be able to own the film.  I enjoy it so much, I would have given it 5 stars, but it lost one for the disc not playing on one of my DVD players.
Thanks to Warner Brothers for giving us this option as opposed to none.",1293408000,,1266,4.036
1062451,4,6305562822,"I now have several movies from the Warner Archive Collection.  Both have been of good quality despite the fact that they have not had any restoration work done to them.  In this movie the color is not as vibrant as I have come to expect from Technicolor films, but it is solid and not washed out as has happened to many of the 1950s Kodak Film Stock Movies.  The singing is solid -- it is a treat to be able to listen to the reasonably young Jane Powell as well as Lauritz Melchior.  The plot gets a bit silly and overly complex in parts for a romantic comedy, but the film is enjoyable.  It played fine on my Sony Blu Ray DVD player",1286928000,3,633,4.1138211382113825

I saw the film when I was eight years old and never forgotton it. I have nearly all of Jane Powells films and can hardly wait for Three Daring Daughters to be available. Please Warners how about the rest of the Lassie fils especially the Sun Comes Up and The Hills of Home.also I would like to see the Gordon McCrae  and Dennis Morgan versions of the Desrt song.
