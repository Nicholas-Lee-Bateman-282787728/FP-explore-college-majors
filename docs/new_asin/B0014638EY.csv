8254527,3,B0014638EY,"I loved the book which inspired this film and was looking forward to seeing it on the screen. The Region 1 version with English subtitles was $79, so I bought this Region 2 version, assuming that the subtitles would be in French. Wrong! They're in Dutch, and what's worse, I couldn't turn them off. It was very distracting!

I ended up buying a version from Amazon.fr which does have French subtitles. That said, it's a great movie and is fairly faithful to the book. Audrey Tatou is wonderful as usual.",1242000000,2,503,4.588888888888889
