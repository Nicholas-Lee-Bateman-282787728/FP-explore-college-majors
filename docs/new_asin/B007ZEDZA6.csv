5115059,5,B007ZEDZA6,"Loved this show as a kid, only wish I could find the other seasons. Definitely worth every penny and great for any MiB fan.",1357776000,8,123,4.166666666666667
5115060,5,B007ZEDZA6,"This is an amazing animated series.  Even as an adult, I got up early Saturday morning to sse it.  The animation style isn't completely realistic, but it is nice to look at.  The stories are well done.  Even some of the characters from the movies (such as the Worm Guys and the Bug) make appearances.  The voices for Agents J and K (Keith Diamond and Gregg Berger, resp.) are not impersonations, but great substites.  Billy West plays Jeebs in 4 episodes, and Vincent D'Onofrio reprises his role from the original movie.

The plot is the same as it is in the movies.  An older Man in Black and his new intern agent are members of a secret agency that control the many different extraterrestrials already living amongst the citizens of Earth, using rayguns and other futuristic technology to keep the world safe.

The originality and aesthetic quality of this show make it worth watching.  I'm still hoping they'll make an X-Files animated series in a similar style.",1339286400,6,965,4.724550898203593
5115061,5,B007ZEDZA6,"As other reviewers have said, Target has this cheaper. However, don't let the high price here stop you from purchasing! I have waited years for this series to get a proper release in the States, and the audio and video quality of the discs is great! If we support this release, hopefully Sony will put the remaining three seasons on DVD as well. Every episode is what one would expect from a cartoon show that was shown on Saturday mornings in the late 1990s--smart, interesting, and chock-full of character development and multi-layered humor for both kids and adults. The series is for MIB what ""The Real Ghostbusters"" was for the film it was based on. It can be argued that the recent film MIB 3 took some elements from this show in its complex and interesting portrayals of Jay and Kay.

Don't be swayed by negative reviews! Please support the release!",1339200000,6,856,4.66887417218543
5115062,1,B007ZEDZA6,"Ok, the last reviewer already mentioned this, but I feel the rating should also reflect the nonsense of this ridiculous price!  Go to Target and drop $15 for this by all means but DO NOT pay the insane price these idiots are charging!  It's outrageous!  DO NOT GET RIPPED OFF!  Go to Target and get this exclusive DVD",1336521600,4,317,4.413793103448276
5115063,3,B007ZEDZA6,"Buyers should be aware that this DVD was released in Region 1 as a Target stores exclusive on 5/1/2012 for $15. You're being scalped if you buy it elsewhere for more money. (Unless you're reading this a few years from now and it's out of print.)

This is a bare-bones stealth release (i.e. no prior announcement) of the first 13 episodes of ""Men in Black: The Series"", the animated TV show followup to the popular 1997 Will Smith/Tommy Lee Jones feature film, just in time for the third installment. These first aired starting in the fall of 1997 on Kids WB! and ran for four years. With slight changes to appearance, and almost none of the original actors, all the major characters from the first film appear: Jay, Kay, Elle, Zed, Frank the Pug, the worm guys, the two one-eyed aliens who run the communications board, Jeebs, and even the ""Bug"" (actually several different ones over the series' run, tho still played by Vincent D'Onofrio). A variety of new aliens are introduced, including a nemesis for Kay -- his mentor Alpha.

No special features, just the episodes, on two discs. Australia and Europe got this material 4-5 years ago as two separate releases. The video quality on the DVD isn't very good -- whenever something on-screen moves, the lines get fuzzy/lo-res. (The DVDs themselves are not ""full"", either; over a GB of space available on each). Stories, your mileage may vary -- I saw the show when it first aired and remember it being fairly decent, tho nothing spectacular; I haven't (re-)watched all the episodes on the DVDs yet. It tends to be slower-paced than most of the superhero shows that were on at the time.

It's decent entertainment, and depending on where you get it, doesn't cost much. I was excited for this when I saw in the store, my enthusiasm lagged a bit when I started watching. I wish the video transfer quality were better; maybe if I see it on an older ""tube"" TV. More strongly recommended for fans of the movies or of animation; if your interest is causal, may want to think about it.",1336176000,21,2026,4.637883008356546

Writing is very imaginative.
A must have for any M.I.B. fan.",1425513600,,89,4.625
5115082,5,B007ZEDZA6,"My ""but"" is simply that this is the only season that's been released on DVD.  Release the rest!  Regardless, this is a great first season, my favorite episode being ""The Take No Prisoners Syndrome"".  The animation in this season is also, in my personal opinion, better than that of future seasons.  It simply gives the characters, both humans and aliens, a more three-dimensional quality.  They just look more alive and separate from the background they're working in.  Also, Ed O'Ross's vocal performance as Agent Kay gave the man the appearance of a grizzled agent who's been on the job longer than anyone could remember...it again humanizes him.  All these and many more qualities make this a great season and perhaps the best of the series as a whole.  But this was a great series from beginning to end, so that might be a tough competition.  I like it and so will you.  Now, let's get the remaining three seasons out there on DVD!  Enjoy.",1402963200,13,943,4.689024390243903

8523367,4,B007ZEDZA6,Awesome cartoon series. The only problem is the quality of the animation (i.e. you can tell the animators/graphic artists were lazy and incompetent by noticing the animation).,1513728000,,175,5.518518518518518
