5159216,4,B008G33PCS,"My boys have always had a soft spot for Barney and now my 1 year old is dancing to the Barney songs.  This DVD contains lots of Barney fun and singing.  It features great lessons for kids and is truly wholesome.  While Barney can drive me crazy it is actually a good show for young children, I can't even think of anything inappropriate in it.  This is perfect for any new or old Barney fans!",1350345600,,392,4.1866666666666665

8527564,5,B008G33PCS,"This DVD captivates all three of my kids (9, 6, & 2)!! I bought this almost two years ago because my then three and a half year old loved Barney and now my youngest is also obsessed. My oldest will say she doesn't like Barney anymore but we put it on and she's glued to the screen singing and dancing along with her two youngest siblings. They love the music, dancing, everything! My youngest loves the Dragon episode and will actually dance the moves to the ""I may look a little scary"" song and sing some of the words. Adorable. Highly recommend this DVD. Captivates every time.",1422316800,,579,4.420560747663552
