8093062,2,B000BVM22M,"The producers/makers of this video focused solely on the black culture of Cameroon, and totally ignored the caucasian descendents of English and French origin. Furthermore, the producers focused on some of the more bizarre aspects of Cameroon such as fortune telling and a king with 50 wives. There's a significant Baptist community in Cameroon which was completely ignored. The Lutheran Church in Cameroon has 215,000 members, which was also completely ignored.",1352678400,,462,5.52112676056338

Because I plan to go to Cameroon next year, I was looking for something that would more give me broader information about the people and cultures. I felt it was more about the animals than people. But I got to see some nice visuals of the country.",1206403200,2,286,4.2
