3697271,5,B001MFNB7G,My daughter loves these videos and I enjoy watching them with her.  After each episode is a little lesson with real children doing experiments and activities related to what they have just seen.  I am thrilled with these and will buy other Curious George DVDs.,1247270400,2,260,4.7555555555555555
3697272,5,B001MFNB7G,"All of my grandkids cover a wide age range, but they all seem to enjoy the Curious George DVDs. For a monkey that doesn't talk, George conveys a lot of teaching in each of his lessons. I liked purchasing this set, Curious George Monkey Collection Volume 1, that features 32 shows in a nice boxed set...no commercials, and I can preview the DVD before the kids see it. My toddler grandchild is going through a ""fussy stage"" when her mother leaves for work. I gave her a Curious George stuffed animal to hold, and popped in this DVD set and she immediately quieted down and has been distracted ever since!",1244937600,14,603,4.490909090909091

My grandson is almost two and walks in my door every morning saying ""Want George?"" After a few days of constant pleas, I logged on to Amazon.com to choose a DVD. The 4 pack was perfect and a good value. Thirty-Two episodes allows me to put one DVD on in the bedroom to play continually. Each day we can watch a new DVD and enjoy George nonstop.

From what I've seen, many of these have not been shown on PBS for at least the past 6 months. We watch Curious George a lot at my house and they seem to run the same few episodes over and over again. So, this boxed set is not only a bargain--it's a relief! The running time for the four disks, according to the box, is 7 hours and 14 minutes.

3697339,3,B001MFNB7G,Bought these for my nieces son who is 2 1/2 years old. He was so excited to get them I couldn't very easily return them due to them having broken cases.  Very disappointing as these are sold in a box with a handle so he can take them with him.  But center pieces are broken out so they slide around and can get scratched very easily.

3697342,5,B001MFNB7G,Our 19 month old doesn't get into T.V. that much but loves Curious George. I had to make a long road trip so was hoping this would help ease the ride for him. Worked great! He was very content watching these videos for his waking hours on the road. I am very happy with this purchase. Our son seems to think he needs to communicate more in the manner of George after watching it so much.  I am sure this will subside now that the trip is over and he isn't consumed with Curious George most of the time.,1393372800,,502,4.070707070707071
3697343,5,B001MFNB7G,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my nephew and we watched it to death while staying at his house over the holidays. I'm actually going to buy it again so he'll have a set to watch when he comes over to visit my house. It so much easier than setting him up on YouTube and having the browser crash or having to start and stop through my DVR recordings while a toddler is begging for another show in the background. George is the best... and Auntie loves watching him too :),1388534400,,476,4.129032258064516

The fun helped her smile during the painful recovery, and the facts (she said) help keep her brain occupied on something besides the pain. I admit; I watched some of these (new since my childhood), and the new ones are as good as the old.",1387929600,,398,4.25
3697346,4,B001MFNB7G,"After I bought this set, I was curious and just priced out each dvd individually.  They were all about $5/DVD.  So, depending on the price you might not want to buy the set.

I didn't notice this until I spent time with my grand children that live out of state.  They have a lot of DVD's and when I'd ask the twins which DVD they wanted to watch and I held up one DVD at a time they'd say ""No, Scary""

I mentioned this to my daughter and she told me ""This is why I like the Curious George videos because they don't have anything scary in them""  So now I'm sold.

3697393,5,B001MFNB7G,"I bought this for my daughter when she was a baby and it has not waned in popularity for 4 years. Her little brother who loves Thomas the Tank Engine still has room in his heart for Curious George, these DVDs are always in rotation at our home.

PBS has done a great job of updating Curious George for the 21st century without losing any of the charm that made him an icon when he was first created. Prof. Wiseman is no longer the bald white guy, she is an African American. Bill the newspaper boy lives near George's country home and he is African American too. New characters like Chef Pisghetti and the Renkinses who are farmers blend seamlessly into George's country and city existences. These DVDs are packed with episodes loosely connected by a theme, and there is always something to learn but they never beat you over the head with it.

This set proved popular with my niece in India when we went to visit, I ended up buying it for her as well. Curious George goes global!

I have been waiting for years for a Volume 2. The kids in your life will definitely enjoy Volume 1.",1330560000,,1081,4.3681592039801

My son is in LOVE with Curious George, so everyday I wound up having to record each episode to the point my DV-R became 100% full and I couldn't record my own TV shows. So I gave in and decided to search around for some DVDs so I could free up my DV-R.

We got this shipment extremely fast, within the next day after ordering. The DVD set comes with 4 DVDs, 32 shows total, 8 episodes on each DVD, run time over 7 hours all together. Now my son loves choosing which DVD mommy should put on when it's time to watch ""ooh ooh ahh ahh"" as he likes to call it.

My 5 1/2 month old son didn't pay much attention to TV until I saw an episode on PBS and decided to see if he would even look at it. Now, we DVR all of the episodes and have put a Tv & DVD player in his room where we both do tummy time while watching this collection. He giggles when George ""talks"" and Im so glad that he is interested in something so entertaining and still teaching such great lessons even after Ive grown up. This is a collection that I will keep for him when he has children. Unlike so many other cartoons I watched growing up George has always stayed so wholesome and very kid friendly. I even enjoy watching these with him & will be buying another set for my 2 year old step-niece as a birthday present.

3697411,5,B001MFNB7G,"My wife and I are careful about what and how much TV we let our daughter watch. Curious George is one of the few shows we're very happy to let her watch and, together with Clifford, have become my daughter's favorite shows. The sheer number of episodes that come in this amazing collection is staggering, considering how inexpensive it is. You're literally getting hours and hours of Curious George. Great for long car/plane trips and vacations. We've bought Clifford and Dora collections, but this Curious George collection is by far my favorite and my daughter's favorite. We picked it up while she was still 2 years old. She just turned 3 and still requests it. She never gets tired of them. My only word of caution is the ""cave"" episode deals with being afraid of the dark and that things can look scary in the dark. Although watching the episode didn't frighten my daughter, it did heighten her awareness about the dark and probably accelerated her discomfort with it. So depending on the age of your child and their personalities, it's the one episode I would be extra cautious about. Otherwise, I can honestly say this is the best collection of shows, and possibly one of the best educational shows out there, and I highly recommend it. I only wish there was a volume 2 out there now!",1284336000,8,1291,4.666666666666667
