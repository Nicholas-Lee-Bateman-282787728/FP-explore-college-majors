8553276,5,B00AL2EY72,"Fortunately, I have seen two live performances of marionette performances of opera to date.  Readers may be aware that Haydn composed a number of operas for the marionette theater at Esterhaza.  I was struck in the live performances how quickly I forgot that I was watching marionettes rather than singers move about the stage.  The Salzburg marionettes are fun to see and there are a number of creative decisions evident in the production.  I recommend this performance.  I showed it in one of my opera courses (with a hundred students present) and the responses were quite positive.",1362700800,,584,4.979381443298969
