827046,1,6304268378,"To be kind , this is not, by very far, Jackie's best movie. First: Jackie appears in the movie for less than ten minutes. Second : fights are not as good as his average movie. Third the story could have been developed better. Fourth , the quality of the image is quite low . To finish , the end of the movie is quite sad , like the whole movie, where there's no trace of Jackie's humor.",985305600,,386,4.025974025974026
827047,3,6304268378,"This is an average Jackie Chan movie, since I've seen better action sequences and a better storyline from his myriad of movies.  What really took away the stars was that this was pretty depressing.  I wanted this to be a feel good movie, like all his other movies.  It's just so sad at the end, I won't give it away, but any one who likes Jackie Chan will fully or partially agree with me.  I thought having Sammo Hung in the film would brighten things up, but he has a depressing role too.  This is the first movie I've seen pop singer Andy Lau doing any fighting.  Can he really do those moves or was it a stunt double?  Despite the  tragic theme throughout the film, it's not a bad movie, but to see a really cool Chan film, you gotta see ""Drunken Master 2"" aka  ""The Legend Of Drunken Master"".  It's a definite 10 stars.",985132800,,824,4.2243589743589745
827048,1,6304268378,"Jackie must've seen ""Cool Hand Luke"" and thought he could do it better than the Academy Award winning film. He thought wrong. This is a terrible film. Bad writing, bad editing, bad acting...the works. If you want to see a good Jackie Chan movie check out Drunken Master, Young Master, Drunken Master 2... I'm a big fan of most of his movies, but if you watch this one you will be disappointed. We all make mistakes.",984096000,,415,4.473684210526316
827049,4,6304268378,"This movie is actually an older HK movie called ISLAND OF FIRE.  I saw it in SF Chinatown many years ago.  I agree it is not a good place for new Jackie Chan fans to start.  It is a grim movie with a very downbeat ending unless they have changed the ending for this DVD version.  Still it is a good example of the different types of the movies being produced in HK's ""Golden Days"".",983836800,,381,4.04

827329,4,6304268378,"Great movie, really divergent from what most people expect from Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung, although the cast also includes other big names like Andy Lau, Tony Leung Ka-fai and Barry Wong. The Prisoner (also called Island of Fire) is gritty and has realistic tones, seemingly just trying to tell a short dramatic story of some men without reaching for anything too grand. Just an good flick with popular actors. Personally, I find it really enjoyable to see Jackie cast in a way that doesn't force him to be a comedic action superman. Here he's just a prisoner stuck in unfortunate circumstances.

The dub is alright, not great and it does seem like you have too many main characters fighting over screen time. But if you want to see something that doesn't follow tropes this is a very enjoyable watch.",1491955200,,802,4.728571428571429
827330,3,6304268378,"I'm leaving a neutral rating because the dubbing was so bad I couldn't watch anything beyond the opening scenes.

827331,4,6304268378,"Jackie Chan is not the main character in this movie. Get that notion out of your system and you should be able to find adequate entertainment value from the proceedings. If you can stand the poorly structured screenplay, this film should jive even better with you. Everyone gives good acting performances in the flick. Character motivations and reactions come off as confusing due to the script. The fight scenes are substantial enough to carry scenes and show off a few flashy moves but that seems to be the director's highest ambition. The real thrills in this film's action department come from the small stunts and shootouts. This film succeeds due to the acting and chemistry of its stars, the satisfying way of resolving of the mystery aspect, and the thrilling final shootout. Jackie would appreciate The Prisoner better today. It features two things that are in synch with the future he wants in cinema: It's a drama and SPOILER Jackie dies in the film.",1475107200,,961,4.865853658536586

827335,4,6304268378,"i thought this was a great movie as the sceme gets deeper , i liked it alot as jacky chan was not the main character in the film but a host of characters put together make this a great film",1187481600,,189,3.75
827336,4,6304268378,"This movie followed the typical 'jail house' plot line with both a cop and a gangster's murderer on the inside forming an unspoken, unportrayed alliance.  The cinemography was average for a high budget martial arts flick (better than I expected it to be), and there is a delightful selection of great actors present.  The title is quite misleading, as Jackie Chan may well be the least represented of the big names, and it left me wondering for the first 15 minutes if the publisher confused actors, as it took about that long for his first appearance.  That being said, a change of title would likely raise the average rating of this movie, and I could see it easily gaining 3.5-4 stars.

  As alluded to earlier, Jackie Chan's roll in this movie is really something of a bit part.  He has maybe a dozen lines of dialogue, and three fight scenes to my recollection (not counting the shoot-out).  His total screen time is probably about 30 minutes.

  The discrepency of the title dealt with, the coreography is fairly good (though not on a par with Jackie's other movies), and the acting is convincing an enjoyable.  The plot seems to get forgotten at times, and the direction seems a bit confused between trying to be an action flick and an emotional flick without giving enough screen time to either to satisfy.  The dubbing sounds to be performed by native English speakers, and has some colorful dialogue.. unfortunately, the voices were not well chosen to match the actors they represented.

  All in all, I enjoyed this movie once I got over the part where I was trying to figure out how Jackie Chan tied into the story.  Though the fight scenes do display some enjoyable martial arts, I would be quite hesitant to call this a martial arts movie; similarly, while there are several action scenes, I also doubt I would call this an action movie.  Ultimately, it seemed to be a movie without focus... foruntately, the actors carried it and you are able to get engrossed just by watching the antics on a moment-by-moment basis.",1149465600,2,2031,4.705382436260623
827337,1,6304268378,"Bottom line: Jackie Chan owed Jimmy Wang Yu a favor, but apparently so do a lot of people.  I wouldn't recommend this movie, but do recommend reading about how it came about in Jackie's autobiography ""I Am Jackie Chan: My Life in Action"".",1123804800,4,238,4.534883720930233
827458,1,6304268378,"I was disappointed with this movie - I was expecting some Kung Fu action centered around a plot, at least any plot. There is no plot in this movie. It's just The Day-To-Day Life In Prison, which soon gets rather boring and one begins to wonder what the point of the movie is. The ending doesn't really match with the rest of the movie - it's like watching two movies in one.  Overall, there's not much kung fu action to be had in this movie. There's nearly more gun shootings than necessary and fist-fighting scenes. The dubbing is also the worst I have ever heard.  No attempt has been made whatsoever to match the spoken words with the lip action. Sometimes, I wasn't even sure if it was the character speaking, since the mouth was closed most of the time and the tone of voice did not match the character's demeanor.

If you need a movie to put you to sleep, this one will do the job.",1116720000,3,887,4.299401197604791
827459,5,6304268378,"Before I get to anything let it be known that there are spoilers in this review.

Although Jackie hardly speaks in it and is showed in it, it kinda seemed like he played a big part in the movie, but I think Tony Leung was the main character in this movie. I thought it was awesome. Sammo Hung I thought was kinda funny how he always tried to escape from prison and would get caught, and the one where he ran over that one police officer(You could easily tell that was a doll). If your a diehard Jackie Chan fan that always likes to see him succeed this is not your movie because Jackie Chan gets killed in this movie. It's the first one where I have seen that and I was suprised. Overall its a great movie and it actually has a good story to it if you pay attention to the beginning.",1102204800,8,783,4.084415584415584
827460,2,6304268378,"This cheesy kung-fu prison movie, contrary to the box art, does not ""star"" Jackie Chan. Chan and several other Hong Kong actors (like Sammo Hung) reportedly did this as a favour to co-star and producer Jimmy Wang-Yu (""One-Armed Swordsman,"" ""Fantasy Mission Force""). Much of this movie is laughably bad, with goofy dialogue and entire scenes ripped-off from ""Cool Hand Luke"" of all things. Jackie Chan is in the movie for about 15 minutes.
The DVD is in the aspect ratio of 1.85:1, and it looks reasonably good. The dialogue is dubbed, but it hardly seems to matter in a movie like this. There is a commentary by a martial artist and filmmaker named Phillip Rhee that is okay. His historical insights aren't fabulous, but his anecdotes about some of the films stars are enjoyable. Rounding out the extras are some cast biographies and a trailer (which, deceivingly, shows Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung as being the central characters).",1090713600,3,931,4.89873417721519

He can play comedy, bad guy, serious, silly, action, drama, and EVERYTHING in between. If you are too spoiled by Hollywood action movie with big budget to ruin the true action stars does it all, you MUST see this film. Hong Kong people are the BEST at showing you a REAL action film.

827462,2,6304268378,"Not a bad movie for this genre, but the title of the movie (""Jackie Chan is the Prisoner"") is a Big Fat Lie.  This is not a Jackie Chan movie -- he's just one of many in the cast.  Maybe it's naive to let such bold face lying (marketing) bother me, but it still does.  We got the movie, actually believing that it was what Columbia/Tristar Studios promised it would be ...",1081900800,3,372,4.138888888888889
827463,3,6304268378,"JACKIE CHAN IS THE PRISONER (originally titled ISLAND OF FIRE) is a group effort all the way so those expecting to see Jackie Chan in all of the scenes will be disappointed, but not terribly disappointed as the rest of the cast is top notch and the film itself is pretty good.
The story involves a cop (Tony Leung) who believes something fishy is going on within the walls of a certain prison and then goes undercover as a prisoner to try and prove it.  Once inside, however, he finds that this dangerous assignment just may be his last.
Supoporting stories include a desparate young man (Jackie Chan), who kills the brother of a well-known gangster while trying to raise money for his girlfriend's liver transplant, an ingenious convict (Sammo Hung) who always manages to escape from jail to see his son on important occasions, a convicted gang boss (Jimmy Wang Yu) who earns respect from prisoners and resentment from wardens, and the gangster (Andy Lau) who's brother Jackie killed who purposely gets caught and sent to the same prison to avenge his brother's murder.  Also, along the way are the usual tough guys, weaklings, sadicious wardens, and corrupt officials.
The film is a low budget affair lensed mostly in Taiwan (probably in an old airplane hangar redesigned into a prison according to audio commentator Philip Rhee), but this actually helps to convey the real sense of grittiness the characters feel behind bars.  The fights are well staged with Jackie being given the most opportunities to display his acrobatics and martial artistry, although there is one brief car stunt involving Sammo escaping that, while simple, is a real doozy.  Sammo, Tony, and Jimmy are also given the chance to shine as dramatic actors in many poignant scenes showing they're truly more than just action actors.  Sammo's comic touch isn't ignored either as witnessed in two especially fun moments, one involving a large breasted woman and a flat tire, and the other involving a race between a mouse, a lizard, an insect, and some cigarettes!
The film's flaws are that it does try to cover a lot of ground in one movie, and that ground is rather familiar.  If you've seen one corrupt prison movie chances are you've seen elements that appear in this one (bullies, weaklings, fightings, beatings, solitary confinements, lousy food, breakouts, etc.)  However, the lead actors succeed in giving their characters unique and very human qualities, the individual stories are plausible and moving, and the fight scenes are appropriately dirty with every move visible and suspensefully logical as the fights build to exiting finales.
I recommend this film to fans of Jackie Chan to show that he is as capable an ensemble player as he is a star.  His fight scenes here are plentiful and well staged, and he really gives his all when he's on screen.  I'd also recommend it to fans of the other four leads, fans of modern day Hong Kong action films, and those who just like prison movies in general (as long as you don't mind that the actor's mouths don't match the words since this version's been dubbed into English from Chinese).  Give it a try!  3&1/2 stars!
For other takes on Hong Kong or martial arts action styled prison flicks try:  PRISON OF FIRE (starring Chow Yun Fat and Tony Leung), BAMBOO HOUSE OF DOLLS (starring Lo Lieh), THE STORY OF RICKY (with Yukari Oshima), DEATH WARRANT (starring Jean-Claude Van Damme), and IN HELL (also starring Van Damme).",1078617600,,3448,4.855195911413969
827464,3,6304268378,"The title is misleading.  It's 'Cool Hand Luke' meets 'Lock Up' in Hong Kong, with some slightly bizarre plot twists that leave you going ""Huh??"".  I enjoyed it, though, in spite of the fact that this is NOT your typical Jackie Chan film.  It's gritty, the dubbed dialogue is comprised of American slang, and there's an abundance of gratuitous profanity.  Also, be warned that Chan's character is a rather minor one with not much face time and minimal fight scenes.  If you aren't familiar with Chan's work, I suggest becoming acquainted with it before you see this one.

Though it is still a good film! it's about this cop who goes undercover in a prison to find out who ordered the assasination of his father-in-law. What he finds instead is a prison system so fraught with abuse that it's hard to tell who is part of an elite group of assigns recruited by the prison warden.

827467,1,6304268378,"This is my first review, but I just Haaaad to say something.  Number one, as everyone has stated, Jackie Chan is only one minor prisoner. Number two, there are TWO Tony Leungs, and the Tony Leung who was in 'Gorgeous' is Tony Leung Chiu Wai, the Tony Leung in The Prisoner is Tony Leung Ka Fai (from 'The Lover'). I can't believe somebody didn't do their research.  And number three, you would think that with such a distinguished cast as Jackie Chan, Andy Lau, Tony Leung (Ka Fai) and Sammo Hung, that a better film would be the result.  What we actually do have is a muddled, confusing mess.  If you like any of the actors involved, or are looking for a good representation of Hong Kong cinema, or just a good action yarn - don't bother.",1007683200,2,739,4.372262773722627

He's not the main character, not that there really is a main character, it seems.  The plot, tangled as it is, seems to be about some prison that pretends to execute people and then uses them as assassins.  But we only hear about this during the first few minutes and then at the ""climax"" at the end of the movie where Sammo Hung, Jackie Chan, Andy Lau and that other guy run around an airport shooting a bunch of people with not much reason.  Most of the movie deals with innumerable subplots that serve only to drag out this ordeal.
Yes, Jackie Chan shoots people.
So we have here a movie with Jackie Chan where you only see Jackie Chan fight a couple times (the highlights of this movie) and then a bizarre climax where pretty much everyone dies.

827626,3,6304268378,"Personally, I liked this movie.  However, my liking it isn't quite an addiquate reason for me to recommend this movie.  The real fans of this movie will be those who love seeing the really sick people of society get beaten down and/or shot a few times.  I really hated the villains in this movie, and watching them get hit and thrown around was something that excited me quite a bit.  However, tragically, the comedy interlaced with the action isn't at all present, and all the stars who fight, are never shown fighting together (unless you consider the end a fight scene).
All characters are well driven, as they each have a particular background story and attitude.  All the characters are decently well acted, too.  The fighting is feirce, but quite energetic, and some parts of this movie are very powerful (like the surprise ending).  There are several reasons I liked this movie.
However, those don't quite add up for me to give this movie a high score.  I will probably buy it someday, but it's not among my ""Need to get Jackie Chan movies"" list.  I also complain about how I couldn't shut off the captions!  I was happy that some lines that were unclear were spelled out for me to read.  However, those captions still ruined the movie a tad, like at the begginning, the main character says ""Hey, who's visiting your father?""  Then, Caption: ""Gunshot.""  Audio: ""Boom!""  I saw the bullet shot coming, and it's not because it was obvious; it was just told to me before it actually happened.

On top of that, he is only in one brief (and not too spectacular) fight scene (the scene that lands him in jail actually) that proved to be one of the few fight scenes in the movie. Sammo Hung fans will also be disappointed to find out that not only does Sammo not have a single fight scene, but that he is, at best, a distant supporting character.
Despite the fact that this is a bad Chan movie, it's a fairly entertaining movie in and of itself. Chan fans will pass out when they see what happens to Chan at the end though.",987984000,2,677,4.022222222222222

Paul Newman's version is a lot better. ""The Prisoner"" also steals a scene from Burt Reynold's ""The Longest Yard""
Even though this movie isn't very good, (it has all the prison movie cliches) I liked seeing Jackie Chan expanding his range, he can do serious work. To me, the most interesting thing about this movie is recognizing the scenes stolen from other movies.",987811200,,687,4.488

Jackie Chan was one of the only major know actors so they simply label it as such. Many other Chinese movies suffer this treatment and put off many viewers to what would otherwise be a decent movie. It's a straight froward action movie, it's not trying to teach you some awe inspiring truth, following several characters with their own simple plots. Great movie if you take it for what it is.",1497571200,,524,4.46875

7866715,4,6304268378,"Very dramatic movie. It's a change of pace for most of the movies you typically see with Jackie and Sammie Houng. It was a very gritty drama action. After seeing his mentor/fianc&eacute;'s father murdered by a supposedly executed prisoner, a cop decides to go undercover in prison in order to investigate. While he is serving his prison term, he meets other men who are jailed and thru various circumstances become  acquainted. The drama in the prision is such that one forgets the reason why the cop is there. It isn't until the late in the movie that the audience is reminded of the investigation. At which time, you're like, ""oh yeah, I forgot that's what was reason for him being there."" LOL. It was a good watch, very good action, mundane plot (seen the plot before), but the storyline was different. Typically, the movie is driven by the investigation and the drama in the prison is an after thought. Here, the prison drama is 80% of the movie. The cop is treated just like any other prisoner with no safe words or ways out.",1496188800,3,1030,4.5978260869565215
