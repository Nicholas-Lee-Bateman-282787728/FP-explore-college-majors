1237484,4,B00000JRW8,"At first glance, this is a pretty average 90's animated movie. But for some reason, it has stuck with my two and three year olds.  They love the music and the story.
Admittedly, I still find the children's eyes odd (the pupils are white), and the story fairly cliche, but after having to endure it  a few times for the kids, it has grown on me.",1402704000,,344,4.196969696969697

1237717,3,B00000JRW8,"These three features all are fairly well-animated and feature good acting and GREAT dialogue. Perplexing, though, is the plot writing, which is beyond terrible on the first two offerings (""Jingle Bells"" and ""We Wish You a Merry Christmas"") and just average on the third (""O Christmas Tree""). It's almost as if the person who wrote the dialogue didn't write the plots.

This trio of releases put together make the package slightly more attractive, but not much because ""We Wish You a Merry Christmas"" with it's convoluted, meandering mess of a story would rate one star on its own, and ""Jingle Bells"" with its nonsensical plot devices (Selling the family horse only to have it magically reappear with no explanation as to why...total God in the Machine moment) would get just two.

""O Christmas Tree"" actually is fairly impressive and would push four stars if released by itself.",1355702400,,878,4.965986394557823

1237743,3,B00000JRW8,"Review by brother and sister ages 6 and 8.

""It could teach some people not to take on lots of debt and that you don't need to buy presents for your children, and that the best presents are the ones that you already have. But all the extra parts made it get ridiculous. It was especially really crazy when the toy horse turned into a live horse. The mom was silly and got the idea that she was a ""wicked witch"" mom. The dad didn't think things over enough, and it resulted in sadness.""",1325030400,,485,4.159574468085107
1237744,3,B00000JRW8,"I loved that the movie taught the importance of giving rather than receiving but the movie did not portray the Dad in a very positive, intellectual light and the 'magic' scenes were just cheesy.

1237747,5,B00000JRW8,"These movies are very well done, Excellent singing in them, animation is very nice. Our favorite is the O'Christmas tree for the very youngest. The little pine tree feels left out during Christmas and the animals in the forest help him out, They make home-made ornaments for the tree and the story teaches young children that all the materialistic things you can buy from a store aren't all that important. A discarded soldier ornament adds to the story line.

OUr second favorite is Jingle Bells, A family with a boy and a girl have very little money, The father wants very badly to buy the chidlren gifts. the children want to  give their parent's a gift. Sadly the father sells their family horse to earn money, and the children rebuild an old sled to give the family a sleigh ride with the family horse. ON christmas morning their is a lot of disappointment, but all works out in the end.

The 3rd movie is based around a home for children and the children want to give to the community, but don't know what to do for them, since they have no money. All works out in the end, It is a lovely movie, with wonderful singing in it. It doesn't keep the youngest children's interest as much as the other two movies do.",1317686400,2,1216,4.443946188340807
