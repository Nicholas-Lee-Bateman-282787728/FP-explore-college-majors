6453782,5,B00KYJHQ0Y,"We love Mike the Knight in my house. I pre-ordered this as soon as I heard it was coming out, as I knew my 2 year old would love it. This movie does not disappoint. It is a full length feature filled with songs, new characters, and wonderful life lessons about team work and family. Mike's dad, who doesn't make many appearances in the TV series, is featured throughout the entire movie. We really get to know and understand where Mike gets his enthusiasm from! Squirt, the dragon, gets some much needed screen time as well. We even find out where he really came from. If your children are Mike fans, they will adore this movie and will probably want to watch it over and over again as we often do.",1418169600,,698,4.33587786259542

6453784,5,B00KYJHQ0Y,"Once again we absolutely fell in love with Mike and his family in this new adventure. My daughter truly loves to watch Mike and his knightly missions, and loves when Evie gets to go along for the ride as well. This story is a great lesson in working together as a family- and in the importance of doing the right thing (doing things right!). My daughter likes to remind me that Mike should listen to his dada when he decides to follow his dad on his mission to Dragon Mountain. We love this movie length video! It is a great way for us to have a conversation about listening and working together, which is GREAT with a 4 year old! Keep the wonderful stories coming- we will be on the lookout for more!",1414972800,,701,4.2781954887218046
6453785,4,B00KYJHQ0Y,"Mike the Knight: Journey to Dragon Mountain is a fun adventure for the little ones. In this 70-minute feature length film, kids will watch as Mike, along with his father the King and sister Evie, take on a new mission together. They encounter gargoyles and dragons along the way as they attempt to return a stolen treasured crystal jewel (that turns out to be a dragon egg) to Dragon Mountain. There are some cute songs and silly moments along the way, as Mike and his family learn to work together and appreciate each others unique abilities. In addition to the movie, the DVD includes bonus features such as music videos and puzzles. My 3 year old really enjoyed this movie!
*Disclaimer: I received this DVD to review as part of the NCircle Nsider program.",1414195200,,758,4.664179104477612
6453786,5,B00KYJHQ0Y,My two year old really enjoyed watching this DVD. He's not usually one to set still but he really like the dragons & the frog. Very cute show :),1413331200,,144,4.0
6453787,5,B00KYJHQ0Y,"We were given this dvd through the NCircle movie program to watch and review, and I must say we're very please! It's a very cute movie for any child who likes Mike the Knight, and my 3 year old actually sat through the whole hour of it ( which is rare lol.) I would recommend this movie as the perfect family night movie for sure!",1413158400,,330,4.092307692307692
6453788,5,B00KYJHQ0Y,"I would have rated this DVD 4 stars because I'm not a fan of all the singing, but my two and a half year old son loves Mike the Knight! This movie is great in the fact that it has Mike and Evie on an adventure with their father the king to return a crystal to dragon mountain. At first they hide from their dad, because he told them to stay home. They find that working together as a family they get the mission done. Lots of laughs and fun throughout and of course my little guy finds the Vikings so funny, he laughs every time he sees them. Another great adventure if you don't mind the sudden singing ",1435449600,,604,4.07563025210084
