8435884,1,B004MB5MGU,"I have used several Peggy Flores videos in my art classroom for years. They are understandable to a wide ranges of ages, and I think they're terrific! Her Maskmaking with Paper is a classic, as are several others. Her instructions are clear, and easy for students to follow. Much as I admire her videos, I wish she'd make a total redo of this one (which I returned after previewing) at a much higher level of difficulty. This is fine for moms looking for rainy day fun for little kids, but misses the mark for any other expectations.",1314057600,,533,4.505154639175258
