832747,5,6304274114,"A gritty and unique film, a great watch for Mickey Rouke fans. Fantastic performance from Ted Levine, formally ""Buffalo Bill"" from ""The Silence Of The Lambs"". A must have for fans of Tupac Shakur on the big screen, not a ton of screen time for Tupac, but the scenes he is in are great. Tupac's co star from ""Juice"" Jermaine Hopkins also appears in this movie. Also features ""The Sopranos"" actress Suzanne Shepherd as Rouke's mother.

832857,5,6304274114,"Bullet, film actor Mickey Rourke, now beside Mickey Rourke in my opinion being an outstanding actor, this particular film Bullet really touches my heart, in its malicious, malignant, and absolutely tough guy life in the down deep ghetto of New York City & Prison Life, it is a delicate film of male emotions of equally delicate male emotions.  Male emotions I don't think to many directors get in tune with in male characters, in this film there is an implication of homosexuality without the scenes being blatantly homosexual in their performance.  We Protestant and Catholic Americans don't like to address in the film media or any other media, that men do have love for one another, and its all not homosexual or blatant in sexuality (not to say such love won't lead to sexuality between men, but so what!) Mickey Rourke portrays a man who has been in prison for eight years, and has probably learned what love and loving hostility can be between men, on top of that, hes got a heroin addiction, which eventually gives his character a don't give a damn attitude about life in general, except of course to find ways to get that next heroin hit, which is his characters cop-out to the life and living.  Perhaps I have a special empathy to this Mickey Rourke film because I am a recovering addict myself, and saw so much of myself in Mickey Rourkes excellently portrayed character in this film.  A film not recommended for the light hearted or nave person.",1437177600,,1456,4.698039215686275

The scenes with Tupac and his guys feel like a ""B"" movie and hurts the overall rating but who cares?

833164,3,6304274114,"The ingredients were all there, but ultimately it just didn't come together.  The acting which was top knotch from all corners wasn't to blame; Mickey Rourke, Tupac, Adrian Brody, Ted Levine & John Enos fully fleshed out their roles.  And the story was compelling; the lost hope of a Jewish family destroyed by drug abuse and imprisonment of the middle son (Rourke), the mental breakdown of the eldest son (Levine) and the aimless drifting of lost graffiti artist & younger son (Brody).  The tension builds as ex-convict Rourke and his nemesis Tupac like two wild cats hiss and spit and curse at each other from scene to scene until they pounce.

It may be that the writer did not ultimately decide if he was writing a family drama, or a personal redemption story centered on the mean streets.  Still a good film.",1364428800,,813,4.697183098591549

833170,4,6304274114,"""Bullet"" has such extraordinary acting we can only wish that someone had chosen a more upbeat story. There is little comfort to be found in the story of the 3 sons of  Brooklyn Jewish family - one is a ex-con druggie hell bent on self destruction, another is an ex-veteran reduced to paranoid schizophrenia, and the third is an ""artist"" who paints on bathroom walls and abandoned buildings.

Mickey Rourke (1952) plays the ex-con. Rourke is best known to younger viewers as the Oscar nominated star of ""The Wrestler"" (2008) for which he won a BAFTA. Older viewers will remember him for ""Body Heat"" (1981), ""Diner"" (1982), and ""The Pope of Greenwich Village"" (1984). Personally I liked him best in ""Angel Heart"" (1987). Rourke is probably one of the most talented actors around, and this is one of his strongest performances.

Adrian Brody (1973) plays the artist. For his role in ""The Pianist"" (2002) Brody won an Oscar and a Cesar and was nominated for a Golden Globe. At 29 he was the youngest person to ever win the Best Actor Oscar.

Ted Levine (1957) plays the ex-vet and his performance is so good he steals every scene, which is quite an accomplishment given the cast. Levine is best known from his role as ""Buffalo Bill"" in ""The Silence of the Lambs"" (1991).

Tupac Shakur (1971-96) plays a local hood who has a long history of conflict with Rourke. Shakur was a world famous MC and the highest selling rap/hip hop artist. In real life, Shakur and Brody were good friends. This was Shakur's last film and he was killed within a few weeks of completing the film.

The film is directed by Julien Temple (1953) who works primarily as a documentary director and is probably best known for ""Earth Girls are Easy"" (1988). He manages to keep the action moving so that you never have a chance to sit back and relax.

If you like really good acting, this film is for you if you can stand to sit through the grim story.",1304553600,,1917,4.555232558139535
833241,5,6304274114,"THIS MOVIE IS AMAZING....... For fans of buffalo bill from the silence of the lambs, you're gonna love this one. This movie is kind of different in that it shows gang bangers from a Jewish prospective.............odd to hear i know, but seems to exist once you watch this. A typical hood life type movie but instead of life in the hood, its more like life in the big city and hustlin for your heroine addiction. Drug use and violence keeps you watching. A good story which brings a tear to your eye when the revenge scene takes place, makes you chear for and feel glad that our lead character got even. This is a very gritty and action packed movie, with a good story. Has a good lesson for living the ""cool"" life. Love the drug abuse and fight scenes in this one. You will enjoy this one.",1303171200,,789,4.337837837837838
833242,4,6304274114,"I've been checking out all of Rourke's movies after seeing The Wrestler. This one was good, but it had a few scenes that felt like they were rushed and thrown together. The acting was good though and Rourke's character is very complex and intriguing. My favorite scenes are when he is swinging his bat or hitting the boardwalks, remembering who he once was and what he could have been before the drugs and prison took everything from him. You really feel this guy's pain of a life wasted. Tupac also did a fine job and the older brother did a real good job playing the loony Vietnam vet.",1294876800,,587,4.444444444444445

833244,4,6304274114,"This movie is a very realistic movie. Bullet is a 1996 crime drama film directed by Julien Temple and starring Mickey Rourke, Tupac Shakur, John Enos III, Ted Levine,Adrien Brody and Donnie Wahlberg. The screenplay was written by Rourke and Bruce Rubenstein. The film was released a month after Shakur's murder.

Mickey Rourke was also the music supervisor of the film. It had limited distribution in theatres in US and was shot in New York with a significant portion in Brooklyn.",1259452800,,480,4.925925925925926

833246,4,6304274114,"I had bought this movie originally a couple of years after PAC was killed and I enjoyed it a lot.  Looking at it again this evening on the IFC channel on cable, the one thing that stood out now as compared to watching it back then was the stars who were in this movie and how they've blown up since.  We all know PAC was on the verge of blowing up movie wise before his death.  Mickey was always Mickey and he kind of crashed and burned after this one but now has risen like a Phoenix back on the scene as an Oscar contender in ""The Wrestler"".  Oscar worthy?  Talented as hell yes, but Oscar and Mickey Rourke in the same sentence who'd a thought it.  Adrien Brody has blown up nicely since as well winning an Oscar in the ""Pianist"" in 2002.  Who can forget Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill in the original Silence of the Lambs and his appearance in the crime thriller Heat.  Donnie Wahlberg as ""Big Balls"" in this movie and of course Michael K. Williams aka Omar Little from HBO's The Wire as Hi Top.  Watching this movie again after all these years, with a little better directing and scriptwriting and with this talented cast, this film had potential to be a classic urban flick.  But we all gotta start somewhere.  Still a good collector's item flick for PAC fans and fans of hood movies.",1233360000,,1286,4.2946058091286305
833247,1,6304274114,Big Mickey Rourke fan here but this movie was horrible. Rourke was good but the entire movie was just a big pile of dung. Don't even bother.,1229558400,,140,4.222222222222222
833248,4,6304274114,"Bullet is Mickey Rourke's show, he owns it. Plus there's also a high quality ensemble cast comprising the impressive line-up of the late Tupac Shakur, Adrien Brody and Ted Levine.  The storyline involves Butch Stein(Rourke) being released from prison after serving time for taking the rap for a crime he did not commit. Uppermost in his mind upon his release are two things:getting loaded on smack and getting his own back on his arch enemy Tank(Shakur). The Stein family is comically dysfunctional and the hysterical reunion dinner dialogue involving the convict Butch Stein(Rourke), the schizophrenic psychotic ""GI Joe"" Lewis Stein(Levine) and the ""Salvador Dali"" Ruby Stein (Brody) with them all being thirty something, still living at home, being terrorised by their alcoholic ball- breaking overworked father and nannied by their yenter jewish mother really sent me over the edge. It's the classic Jewish ""We did eveything we could for you boys and look how you turned out"" schpiel.
Butch Stein knows he is too far gone on the drug addiction and life of crime for any reform and his fate is to finally square off his revenge with drug dealer Tank.

There is a great supporting cast and John Enos III as the closeted homosexual Stein family friend Lester delivers a solid and convincing performance. Julien Temple delivers a sylishly directed film with wonderful camera angles, a superb Barry White music score which adds to the contradictory love and beauty theme within the contorted urban grit of big bad city life.

Fully recommended.",1216684800,,1542,5.086956521739131
833249,3,6304274114,Bullet wasn't Tupac's best movie role but it's a decent movie. Mickey Rourke for once doesn't do his method acting .

High profile names do nothing for this film. Brody doesn't have the ganster film look....Rouke's character does nothing for me and Shakur's role in the film  was just that of a gang banger.

833365,5,6304274114,"The last great performance by Mickey Rourke (check out the original bad boy pimp in The Pope of Greenwich Village, Angel Heart, Diner & Barfly)...Couple of observations though, the film has the production values of ""Family Ties""...don't expect an operatic ""Scarface"" type Gangster film. The oddball casting and stylistic touches win you over in the end, from the soundtrack  to some of Julien Temple's wierd angles. This film must have been written when Mickey was high on heroin, some of it is straight on Mickey Rourke Bad Ass, some of it like the dysfunctional jewish melodrama is out of place. Still everybody should check it out, for a couple of reasons, #1)Its the second film Julien Temple works with a major music star who ends up dying just a year later (Temple directed Sid Vicious in ""Great Rock and Roll Swindle"")#2 Adrien Brody in a really wierd role, Brody actually worked with Mickey on ""Thin Red Line"" but Rourke had his scenes cut from the film, its amazing that Brody has gone on to become an Oscar winner and Rourke has since become a character actor. #3 Tupac's Slick Rick impersonation is hillarious...I think also Pudgey guy worked with Tupac on Juice...don't quote me on that one.",1070668800,,1203,4.811594202898551
833366,3,6304274114,Rourke really buts the bullet in Bullet. his performance as Bullet saves this one from being a flopsum jetsum mess. Tupac is 'aight and the intense scene would have to be when hes the gang members start shooting in a restaurant with kids and civilians. Ted Levine has his moments as Rourkes strange?war obsessed brother and he evenges Bullets death at the end which was satisfying.,1066176000,,381,4.787878787878788
833367,4,6304274114,"This is a straight to video classic that I rented several years ago. It's good to rediscover it on DVD. If you're not a big fan of Hip Hop, don't let Tupac's presence in the film scare you off. There's plenty of dark humor and macho fight scenes to appeal to a broader demographic than just rap enthusiasts. Most of the dark humor is supplied by Ted Levine who portrays one of film's craziest Vietnam War veterans since Robert Deniro's Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver. Fans of Silence of the Lambs will remember Ted Levine's performance as that loveable genital tucking women suit making serial killer who was always making people rub the lotion on the skin. Ted is equally crazy in this film and will have you laughing at his lunacy. When you throw in a midget, a character named Franky Eyelashes, and some great Barry White tunes, you got yourself a great original guy flick to watch with your buddies. The DVD is lean on extras but includes wide/full screen and unrated/rated R versions of the film. There are some behind the scenes interviews with Mickey Rourke, Tupac, and recent oscar winner Adrien Brody.",1059177600,,1110,4.668367346938775

833429,4,6304274114,"This has to bee one the tightiest hood movies I ever saw in my day. When I first saw it by when it was released on video back in 1997 (when 2pac was pursumed dead or alive)personalily I was moved by it than my cusins who disliked it rationaly. It was reminding my of the environment I was living when I was only in sixth grade at the time when the east and west coast war was unfolding. The story of the movies main character ""Bullet"" is something I can relate to emotionaly.
  ""MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD""
Butch ""Bullet"" Stein (Mickey Rourke)gets released from prison after a eight year sentince he took for a close ally from the neighborhood and hooks up with his little brother Ruby who is a highly talented piantist,and childhood friend Lestor who is a big male gigalo. When Bullets Prison nemmenis Tank (2pac) who wants revenge one him for shanking his eye out when they in prison finds his back in the neighborhood all hell breaks loose. Bullets back to shooting smack and has a death wish. Bullet and his  thugish homeboy paddy are at war with Tank and his crew and are in a power struggle that they can resolve by an ultimate sacrifice.
BULLET is one of the most underrated films on thug life ever made and nerver made the theaters. It has a handful of supporting actors in including Bullets schizofrinic vietnam vet brother Louis who defenitly stills the show and 2Pac who has the best lines throuhout the movie. One of Mickey Rourke's best performances since YEAR OF THE DRAGON and is cooler than cool.
The DVD has a R-rated and UNRATED versions of the movie. The unrated has extended footage of a guy getting stabed in the eye with blood swirting out and a extra footage of a sex at a nightclub. If your from a prilvidged background you wouldn't understand the moral values of the story being told. I recommed this film along with JUICE,TAXI DRIVER,STATE OF GRACE AND TRUE ROMMACE.",1049760000,,1886,4.524926686217009
833430,5,6304274114,"An important and contemporary film about street life to be sure, but there's something magical about Bullet. First of all, you'll never see anything like this again, Tupac: gone, Mickey: just different these days, and Wahlberg played ""Big Balls"". You can tell, that things just came together to make an incredible film. Little details of realism and humble, masterful performances. For example, even character interaction with ""Big Balls"" is given careful attention. Bullet says in a caring way ""how you doin Big Balls?"". He treats Balls with respect because Balls says exactly what he feels (and is not afraid - hence ""Big Balls""). Even after Balls says ""none of this ...happened until this crazy ... showed up"" Bullet is calm and doesn't take it as a personal attack, he just sits there and let's them yell it out. Bullet is afraid of no-one. Neither is ""Tank"" (Tupac), and ""men love to hate"". So the story goes. It's not just drama, (I hate drama) it's priceless nuance and good filmaking. If you enjoyed New Jack, Menace2 or Sugar Hill, Bullet will blow em away. You'll be touched, but don't let that stop you. Don't miss Bullet.
As for the storyline: Bullet (Mickey Rourke) gets out of prison and the very same day, exacts revenge on Tank (Tupac) by robbing some of his smack customers and stabbing one his dealers in the eye. From there, we go through family and interpersonal dysfunctions of Bullet and his foemen. There is more tragedy than optimism, so be warned. One thing fer sure, you'll never shoot smack.",1043798400,,1518,4.797709923664122
833431,5,6304274114,"To describe it in one word....Brilliance. One of the greatest travesties ever bestowed upon this world was the absence of ""Bullet"" from theatrical viewing. Mickey Rourke is a Jewish hoolum who doesn't play by the rules, and he's in the fight of his life against the man he scarred many years ago. Also starring John Enos III as his flamboyant yet loyal confidant Lester. Together, these two modern day poets reek havoc on the streets of Brooklyn, eye stabbing, shooting, and searching for the ever elusive final hit. If you want action, sex, comedy, all wrapped up into a story of a family overcoming addiction...then Bullet is not for you. Words can't even describe this movie's viewing power. You all should thank Christ for Mickey Rourke, John Enos III, and whoever played Bernard and the midget in the film.",1040256000,,811,4.841726618705036
833432,5,6304274114,"My Whole Crew Has been waiting for this day to come for 4 years now. Bullet Is One Of The All Time greatest movies up there. From the Soundtrack to the direction to the stars I recommend this film Immensly. It's a story that anyone on some level can relate to and that everyone should see at least once.

833434,5,6304274114,"This is the best films I have ever seen. It is a damn shame that a film with such an excellent story line never made the theaters. Bullet has great music from vivaldi and Barry White that make the scenes very powerful and touching. Mickey Rourke plays the part of Butch ""Bullet"" Stein great. I love his laid back personality in the movie even though he is a heroin addict. Tupac also plays his part of a drug dealer really well and I know some people are dissapointed that he has a small role in this film but you shouldn't like this film just cuz Pac is in it. This film really shows you how a family can be destroyed by a life of drugs and crime. This is my favorite film and I can't describe in words how good it is and how powerful and touching some of the scenes are. We should all try to have Bullets laid back personality because that's what makes Mickey Rourke so great in this movie. Mickey Rourke cowrote this film as ""Sir Eddie Cook"" which is a name that he goes under as a writer which really shows you how talanted he really is to make such a great film. Hey also was the music supervisor for the film. I love all the scence in the movie but one of my favorites is when Bullet his younger brother Ruby and friend Lester get high while they are driving right after bullet gets out of jail and the Barry White song ""Never Never Gonna Give You Up"" comes on. That song is just perfect for that part. Any one who says this is a bad film really doesn't understand movies and the message that directors and writers try to get across to people. These people critize because they could never create anything like this and are flat out ignorent so don't even pay attention to their reviews. Tupac is most likely the greatest rapper ever and a pretty good actor but to all the Pac fans you can't hate this movie because it isn't Pacs best. Hey I love tupac too, but I realized that Mickey Rourke is just the coolest guy ever to do this movie because he is perfect in playing the role of a BULLET.
Like I said I could talk for ever about my favorite movie. Just watch it and hopefully you will understand it a like it too.",1009238400,,2123,4.180487804878049
833435,4,6304274114,"Bullet is one of several extremely entertaining Mickey movies, about a 35 year old jewish convict named butch (a.k.a. Bullet) who threw away his talent (Baseball) on drugs and crime. the movie focuses on 2 things, one: bullets self destructive behavior and lost will to live. and two: his rivalry with a nieghborhood druglord named tank (a little overacted by tupac)who bullet stabbed in the eye while they were in prision. bullet and tank share an equal amount of respect and hatred towards each other and both get what eventually comes to those who live by the sword.
I personally enjoy most of mickey's earlier work, and this is no acception.",1008201600,,645,4.81981981981982
833436,4,6304274114,"Bullet is a stylish mix of violence and vindictiveness. It fiercely voyages into the dark underworld of two men who share a bitter hatred and grudging respect. It elucidates of just what it takes to survive on the streets of reckless drugs and vengeful gangs with a penetrating intelligence. And while it may appear as being your average gangster film with nothing more to it than a number one soundtrack, pessimistic dialogue and pistol-packing thugs whose only pursuit in life's to blow everyone else's brains away for virtually no reason at all but for the sheer appeal it has to many viewers out there-it isn't. It focuses more upon moral values and the consequences that are made between you and loved ones if deciding to be so careless as to not altering such a perilous lifestyle that's good for nothing but taking away your dignity, everything that you believe in and the person that you once were in whom others so deeply treasured. As it converts you to another one of the filth: a degrading individual in society who seeks out for nothing but the rush of getting high...the rush to dissolve away such tainted afflictions that are of living.
The entire cast was stupendous, for they delivered some of the most powerful and hypnotic performances I have ever seen. I use the term ""hypnotic"" most notably because of Mickey Rourke's performance that make clear of just how talented he really is throughout depictions of various drug-induced hazes and other scenes that are just as moving. He perfectly essays the smooth roll of an easygoing drug-attic without any values or care for himself or life in general, and who clearly knows where his future is heading. When you realize that he was once a joyous youngster known to win plenty of metals for his talent in baseball, a sport that was evidently a factor to a bright future as perhaps the next Babe Ruth, it becomes clear that shooting up heroin is the only solution for this helpless man's afflictions, and you really feel for him; you share his anguish.
Though such a gloomy and moody picture ultimately has you aware that a ""delightful"" conclusion is something it won't exactly offer as Butch's probabilities of making it out alive began to slender, the director has him use all the good that is left in him, all that he has become good for, to show to others the life they'll be living if ever deciding to approach what made him the man that he is today. (For instance, though he did not necessarily get along with these two specific students fresh out of high school and new to the hood, rather than giving them the pleasure of getting physical near the end when they had one last encounter with him inside some nightclub, he rolls up his sleeves and, while he shows them of how overpowering things you pick up from the streets are, sternly looks at them with eyes so swollen you would presume he was through hell and back, and it becomes clear of the point that he is trying to make as he tells them that if they do choose to follow in his footsteps, they aren't ever going to make it out alive.) The director doesn't glamorize drugs. Instead, he makes his point and he makes his point well by showing us how destructive they are in this realistic melodrama, and Butch was someone in whom he used to accomplish that goal. Like a chain smoker that now winds up drawing smoke in and out from the hole in his throat which had to be surgically made because his lungs can take no more, you can't help but to recoil away, as those two students found themselves doing; there was real impact there. And while it may have seemed like the director had a weak part as to filling us in to why Butch was sentenced for eight years in prison, he ultimately does, and once you find out, you develop a whole new kind of esteem for Butch and the film.",1004313600,,3799,4.547445255474453

Brilliant acting from Tu, Rourke and especially Levine. What a wonderfully refreshing character Levine has made Louis into. Worth watching for his performance alone. Rourke is in his element as the underachieving hard Jewish lad who had promised so much.

He's always interesting, but the character doesn't give him the opportunities that films like Angel Heart, Barfly, and Johnny Handsome, and Homeboy did.  I think he wrote the screenplay as well under the name Sir Eddie Cook, but I may be mistaken.  I can't wait to see Rourke in another role worthy of his talents.
