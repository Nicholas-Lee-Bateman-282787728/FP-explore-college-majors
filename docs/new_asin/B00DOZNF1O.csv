5839552,1,B00DOZNF1O,"The SRP is $70 for 3 discs? Really? Amazon is charging $60. There is a big discount! When you buy a box set, it should wind up being cheaper per disc then if you purchased the discs individually. They are still charging $20 per disc. I know it is the Halloween season, but that is still a blatant rip off. And they wonder why more and more people are abandoning the home video hard copy market altogether and turning to services like Netflix.",1379548800,5,442,4.337349397590361
5839553,4,B00DOZNF1O,"Scream Factory gives the most famous haunted house in America its due with the release of ""The Amityville Horror"" Trilogy box set. The collection includes ""The Amityville Horror,"" ""Amityville II: The Possession,"" and ""Amityville 3-D."" It also marks the first time the two sequels have been available on Blu-ray and in 3-D.

Everybody knows about the legend of the Amityville House at 112 Ocean Avenue in Long Island, New York. A family moves into the house and the older son murders them all in their sleep. When he's apprehended, he tells the authorities a voice told him to do it. Another family moves in a year later and they're plagued with paranormal incidences. Things get so bad, they abandon the house and never return.

Whether or not you believe the stories are true, the ""Amityville"" films do provide good times for horror fans. Some want to revisit their childhood fears. Others want the opportunity to share the experience with their children for the first time and scare them to death.

Upon watching the first two films again for the first time in over a decade, I realized a couple things. ""The Amityville Horror"" isn't as hokey as I remembered it. The last time I watched it, I was disappointed by how tame it was. I found it to be a satisfying watch now. Maybe I've come to appreciate its subtleness in the wake of so many graphic gore fests and torture-porn films.

""Amityville II: The Possession"" is the best of the first three films. It really taps into a person's fear of losing control and the supernatural. The whole story just feels more fleshed out than the first.

""Amityville 3-D"" was truly cashing in on what producers felt could be a franchise by the time it was released. Not only were they attempting to capitalize on the first two films, but they jumped on the 3-D bandwagon being exploited at the time by other horror series like ""Friday the 13th,"" ""Jaws,"" and others. Filmmakers were so desperate to pull more people in that the movie is even rated PG. Here's the perfect example of a movie where barely anything exciting happens except objects poke out of the screen at you.

Religious folks won't be satisfied with ""The Amityville Horror"" Trilogy if they're easily offended and take things too seriously. Good very rarely wins over evil in these films. Good usually runs at the last second screaming out of evil's house. Sadly, the powers of the priest never seem able to triumph over the demonic forces they come up against.

The Blu-ray transfers of the film look and sound good. They all manage to maintain their 1970s and 1980s ""real"" film flavors but look cleaner and clearer. ""The Amityville Horror"" and ""Amityville 3-D"" are presented in 5.1 surround sound while ""Amityville II: The Possession"" is only in DTS Master Audio Mono for some reason. It's still safe to say these Blu-ray versions are most likely the best these movies ever sounded.

As usual, Scream Factory provides great special features for each disc. ""The Amityville Horror"" includes audio commentary by Dr. Hans Holzer, Ph. D in Parapsychology. It also contains a new documentary entitled ""For God's Sake, Get Out!"" that features interviews with actors James Brolin and Margot Kidder. A theatrical trailer and radio spots can be found as well.

""Amityville II: The Possession"" contains the most special features. There's audio commentary provided by author Alexandra Holzer (""Growing Up Haunted-A Ghostly Memoir""). There are interviews with Director Damiano Damiani and actors Andrew Prine, Diane Franklin, and Rutanya Alda. A theatrical trailer is included as well.

""Amityville 3-D"" features a theatrical trailer and the 2-D and 3-D versions of the film. It also contains an interview with actor Candy Clark. I guess you could count early appearances by Meg Ryan and Lori Loughlin as special features, too.

""The Amityville Horror"" Trilogy box set has Scream Factory and Shout! Factory doing what they do best again. They're reviving and breathing life into forgotten cinema gems of the horror genre. Not everybody is going to like all the films in this collection, but there are definitely enough enthusiasts out there to merit giving these classics the high-definition treatment they deserve.",1378252800,14,4205,4.950354609929078
5839554,3,B00DOZNF1O,"The Amityville Horror is a classic story about a family experiencing problems after moving into a haunted house. The Amityville Horror craze was an unexpected and terrifying phenomenon in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The slasher hadn't exploded yet when this film scored huge at the box office. Supernatural horror had ten good years already but everyone who saw Amityville Horror was blown away. The lead actor, James Brolin, couldn't find work for 2 years after appearing in this film despite being an accomplished actor! To this day I'm not sure I understand what happened and why with the ten film franchise (the eleventh installment has just been completed). Friday the 13th established the slasher for the 1980s the year after and the rest is history. My personal favorite is Amityville II. The Possession features Burt Young (Rocky) who just slaps you around right away and it's full-blown possession time 20 minutes into it. Good performances, great make-up, great effects, good plot and pacing with enough oddities to turn your head (""Why didn't you pull the trigger?""). Sonny (Jack Magner) was so creepy he never worked again. I consider it an improvement from the suspense-filled original. Part 3-D is more of an effects-based movie than a character-driven, plot-based investigation into the house. Amityville 3-D does have a great cast including a young Lori Loughlin (Full House) and Meg Ryan (Sleepless in Seattle). A journalist moves into the house to debunk rumors of the supernatural and investigate the *basement*.

Many fans want to know about Amityville 3D in Blu-ray 3D. It is a good presentation but it does show the limitations of the technology and photography from when it was originally filmed. The 3D effects are exaggerated, creating a pop-up effect when you watch it. It's pretty cool but hardly convincing if you don't like the movie. Since it was filmed in ArriVision 3D it can cause some strain on the eyes at times but you get added depth. Amityville fans will get a kick out of it but Avatar fans might not. Overall, the picture quality is good but the audio is disappointing. This 3-disc release includes The Amityville Horror, Amityville II: The Possession and Amityville 3-D (1983). This is the Blu-ray debut for Amityville II & 3D. The third film is also in Blu-ray 3D for the first time (you get both 2D and 3D versions). This trilogy comes surprisingly with 90 minutes of NEW content (lots of interviews and one new audio commentary). Scream! Factory didn't skimp on this set by doing a bare-bones release. The DVD collection did not have extras for the sequels (the focus was on the original). That has been corrected in the Blu-Ray release with new featurettes for Amityville II and 3-D. There is roughly 2 hours of total bonus content included. My only complaint is that deleted scenes from the trilogy could have been added (especially from Amityville II). Including a bonus disc with Amityville IV, the remake or more previously released extras would have made this set even more complete. Admittedly, the later sequels are fairly bland. An audio commentary for Part 3-D will likely be added in the future.

This is a solid release for Amityville fans but I can't rate it more than 3 stars because it isn't deluxe and not all the films have aged well. Overall, the picture quality, audio quality, films and extras are good but not great. Keep the old Amityville Confidential bonus DVD. The other 7 films in the Amityville film franchise are sold separately (they are not as good but the remake and Amityville 1992: It's About Time (Part 6) are worth watching). Now if we can get Friday the 13th Part 3-D in Blu-Ray 3-D then everything will be perfect. Amityville Horror fans are lucky. This is a better box set than Hellraiser, Robocop, or the Halloween franchises received in DVD or Blu-Ray. There is also an out of print 3-film DVD release of Amityville VI, VII and VIII (It's About Time, A New Generation, and Dollhouse). You do get the 3 best Amityville Horror films in one collection.",1377129600,7,5179,5.1049528301886795

5839556,5,B00DOZNF1O,"For those complaining about Amityville 3-D, here's the real story . . . It WILL be in both standard format, and 3D. The box features on this site is a slip-cover, and reflects no features as of yet. we only see the front and side. The individual cases and sleeves will have their original poster art, and all of their individual features. Those are the boxes/cases that will tell-all about each film. From what Scream! tells me, the second film, which had the most cut from it, is getting a lot of love for this release. Perhaps we will see the many sequences removed, such as the rape scene between husband and wife, the Lost Souls ending, Anthony cleaning his guns outside, and the dead squirrel in the fireplace sequence. As for part 3, it is indeed in both viewing formats, so don't lose your heads. Let's just all enjoy these on October 1st!",1374451200,5,846,4.5
5839557,5,B00DOZNF1O,"this gives us a early 80's 3d film on 3d blu ray! The picture is pretty good although it's not as restored as much as I would have liked it's still great to see this in 3d again.  Hopefully other early 80's 3d efforts will return as well.  And there were some good ones, 'parasite' , 'comin at ya' ,  'jaws 3d' , 'spacehunter' , 'rottwieller'  and others.  who can explain why universal can't even get 'jaws 3d' out? that is just foolish. (they restored it! even)  Shout factory did a good job with this set. I do wish that they'd restored these pictures. But at least they look decent.  The best looking is the second movie , which is also the scariest. The first was a monster HIT and although some people put this down now , at the time , it's simple effects were enough to scare you because it was based on a 'true book' ,  I bought this for the 3d blu ray though. Which is NOT named on the box!  I don't get why not.  but it's in the set and thankfully they put this out for us to enjoy. Now if only they would grab some of those other early 80's 3d films. 3d fans should buy this set , because you get amytiville 3d ! and the other two good horror films as well. Story wise part 3 is weaker than part two, but it stands alone pretty well. There are another ten?  amytiville movies as well. All made to video release , but these were the three major theatrical releases of the franchise and a must have for 3d fans.",1373932800,,1420,4.071942446043166

5839571,2,B00DOZNF1O,"I suspect most folks plunking down $50 for three DVDs about hokey haunted house know what they're in for: all films are campy, the first one is decent but the sequels are terrible (in the fun way, for me).  I'd give the films three stars.  This set, however, is not so great and overpriced: Scream factory didn't add any new material/bonus from the original MGM sets of one and two.  The reason to get this set is the third film, which is rendered in 3D.  The 3D is super fun, except for the problem with sountrack syncing: on three different machines/set ups, the soundtrack is out of sync with the image.  I thought at first it was my set up in the living room, so I tried the bedroom, then I tried the DVD today at work (a university).  The soundtrack was still chasing the image.  This is pretty bad for a set that costs $50 and only includes three films with no new extras.  It's the first SHOUT/SCREAM Factory release I've bought that I think is really lousy.",1453766400,,965,4.351955307262569

5839573,4,B00DOZNF1O,"This is a series that has several hits and misses. This set contains the original trilogy, to include a (rapidly transferred) copy of the 3D Movie.
Unlike modern 3D effects, this movie uses the ""pop out of the screen"" effect to an almost comical effect.
When someone claims 3D movies give them headaches, this is probably the type of 3D movie they remember from decades ago and NOT what you get in a modern film. Even when most modern 3D films use the pop-out effect, it is not as eye-cross-inducing as it is in this version.
The audio is also completely out of sync and will cause you to search for lip-sync delay settings on your audio device or Blu-ray player.

None of this happens in the other two, non 3D, movies - this is why I still give it 4 stars.",1452816000,4,757,4.330985915492958

5839576,4,B00DOZNF1O,"I don't know how I feel about thr Amityville films. Ever since I got interested in horror films in middle school, the Amityville series was the first I got curious about mainly because of it being based on a true story and the iconic ""evil eyed"" house looking cool and scary. Anyways you getbthe first 3 original theatrical films from 1979-1983.
The Amityville Horror is exactly like the regular bluray release with a different Scream Factory exclusive cover art.

Amityville 2: The Possession is loaded with features and is probably the best disc on this set mainly because of the added extra content alone.

Amityville 3-D surprisingly is the movie I got this set for because I like cheesy B horror films (and this was actually the first Amityville film I watched...). I just wish I had a Blu-ray 3D TV and player so I can watch this awful amusing film like how it was meant to be seen. The extra feature showing Candy Clark talking about all the stunts she did on the film was really cool because usually forgotten, bad horror movies like this don't usually get interviews like this...but thanks to Scream Factory we're able to! Also it made me relieved about how fun she had doing the stunts and making jokes about them despite everything her character goes through o_0

This set isn't perfect however and this is just my opinion:

1) I'd pay more for this if it came with both Bluray and DVDs of the movies. I'd even pay more for this set if it did! Plus, who doesn't like the feel of 2 disc bluray combo packs ^^?

2) All of Scream Factory's releases come with reversible artwork. Why didn't these movies have then? The 2005 MGM DVD covers would have been good enough or maybe some international movie poster artwork perhaps?

3) The most talked about deleted scenes from Amityville 2 included a rape scene between Rutanya Alda and Burt Young, plus the Lost Souls scene near the end and the Montelli children in the bathtub. There's many more too such as Burt Young's character cleaning out his rifle and a scene where the two priests in the film are implied to be gay with each other. This I'm only getting from sources by the way. I dunno, maybe a license issue or because the footage was destroyed may be possible reasons why we don't get deleted scenes? Same could be said for Amityville Horror with the ""white hooded"" figure...but one can only dream. The appearance of that spectre would've made the movie a lot scarier!!

4) I like that Amityville 3-D had a couple extras but I wanted a commentary track on that film! Maybe the 3D version of the movie counts as an extra but I was hoping for more besides the typical trailer and still gallery. The interview with Candy Clark is enough I guess. Hey at least we get something. Better than no interview at all.

6) The box set artwork. At first I wasn't really a fan of the Scream Factory box art...hoping they'd make a miniature Amityville house to house (get it?) the films in...but that'd probably be too much work. Besides, Amityville isn't on the level of fan favorites like the Halloween and Friday the 13th series' so you can't ask for too much. But after a couple months I've come to enjoy the artwork.

That's why I'm not giving this set a 5 because it was good, just not perfect. Pick this set up if you're a horror fan. I'd definitely recommend it. For a series of such minimal popularity, Scream Factory really did put a lot of effort into pleasing the fans and making this set better than any of Paramount's releases. ""I'm looking at you Friday the 13th! Amityville has a better set than you! Amityville 3-D is also in true Bluray 3D unlike your 3D entry still using thise red and cyan glasses!""

Thanks Scream Factory!

Anyways, the Blu-Ray set is excellent!  It is much higher quality picture when compared to the DVD or VHS.  Sound is a little better than the DVD but not too much.

5839595,4,B00DOZNF1O,Whether you believe in the true stories behind the first and second Amityville movies theres something special about the first two movies that keep me always watching them. They have that old school haunted house feel and a cast that is good at selling the horror. The best cast member being the house itself. Its creepy on its own...enough so that its spawned far too many sequels. The first one is a classic but theres something about the second one (which is a prequel technically) that is just downright creepy...not sure if its the incest undertones or the true story that makes the movie the creepiest of the trilogy. Now the 3rd is a complete waste of time but the care Scream Factory put into it is still appreciated as they could have easily just ignored it.

I browse through a lot of movies and shows sometimes on the television and I see the word horror and I think it's going to be a thriller but the movie ends up some weirdo story and a cast so desperately trying to please the audience.

 What's the ultimate bone shaker in this movie is that it is based on actual facts! Which is cool if your into the paranormal thing!

I am glad I got it.
  The three Blu-Rays come in a cardboard set.  And they are a bit more compact than said DVD's I had.  While the picture is still a bit grainy, it is still a step up from my DVD versions of them.  And I do like the extras on all three.  The first Amityville movie has the extras from the DVD.  But the other two have never before produced extras that were never on the original DVD editions.  And Amityville 3D has both the 2D & 3D versions which is nice.  But one has to have the 3D TV & Blu-Ray to access the 3D version.  But that's no big loss to me either way.

5839616,4,B00DOZNF1O,"Shout's first year of releasing horror titles through their Scream Factory brand has yielded numerous treasures for genre fans, giving even B-tier titles like THE AMITYVILLE HORROR TRILOGY their due on Blu-Ray.

Never regarded as a classic, even of the cult variety, the original 1979 AMITYVILLE HORROR nevertheless became one of the biggest independent hits of all-time. Produced by Samuel Z. Arkoff's American-International Pictures, the pulpy adaptation of Jay Anson's supposedly-""true story"" of the infamous haunted house provides plenty of cheap thrills and a few unintentional yucks to go along with it.

James Brolin and Margot Kidder essay George and Kathy Lutz, who move into the quiet Long Island community of Amityville. Unbeknownst to them, their new home was previously occupied by a family that was slain by their teenage son in a series of brutal shootings. Whether or not the teenager was driven mad by the house (or something in it), the Lutzes soon find themselves being barraged by a variety of haunted house cliches: slime flowing out of toilets, glowing eyes in the upstairs bedroom, invisible play pals of their young children telling them secrets, and George being taken over by some kind of entity from another dimension. Even a local priest (Rod Steiger) fails to clean the house of its inherent evil after giving it the old Father Merrin try.

Directed by Stuart Rosenberg, ""The Amityville Horror"" is standard but competent late 70s horror. The performances are solid but the movie has that ""plastic"" kind of look so many films of its era do. It's like watching an ""Eight Is Enough"" episode crossed with ""The Exorcist."" More effective is Lalo Schifrin's score, which unfortunately was copied in so many other genre films (and used in even more trailers) that it's then-unique mix of child chorus and creepy orchestral arrangements also seems well-worn.

Shout's ""Amityville Horror"" Blu-Ray doesn't merely reprise the already-available MGM/Fox Blu release, adding in extras from an older Special Edition DVD that the prior Blu-Ray lacked. ""For God's Sake, Get Out!"" is a superb look back at the success of the film, sporting interviews with Brolin and Kidder, who isn't ashamed to admit the movie was her ""pay day"" following ""Superman."" Radios spots and the original trailer are also on hand, though the most entertaining extra is a full-length commentary from parapsychologist Dr. Hans Holzer. The late Dr. Holzer may be known to some for his occasional appearances on Leonard Nimoy's old series ""In Search Of...,"" particularly in the Amityville episode where he was a lead investigator. Here, Holzer engages in a fascinating, if not completely off-the-wall, discussion of the actual Lutz haunting, noting where the filmmakers went wrong in making the movie and needlessly messing with the ""actual"" accounts of what happened in the house. It's the kind of talk one wishes you'd hear more often in a DVD commentary. Shout has also shot new extras for this box-set, though the only new supplement on ""The Amityville Horror"" is a 10-minute conversation with Lalo Schifrin, discussing his oft-imitated score.

Visually, the 1080p AVC encoded transfer is probably as spiffy as the film is going to appear, and both 2.0 and 5.1 DTS MA mixes are included on the audio side.

The set also includes the Blu-Ray debuts of the series' two theatrical sequels: the tasteless AMITYVILLE II: THE POSSESSION and the entertaining, if not generic, AMITYVILLE 3-D. Dino DeLaurentiis produced both sequels, which Orion released to declining box-office receipts, leading the ""Amityville"" series to head to the small-screen and direct-to-tape productions thereafter.

""Amityville II"" purports to be a prequel showing what happened to the family that moved in before the Lutzes. Tommy Lee Wallace's script, which claims to be based on Holzer's ""Murder in Amityville"" book, is an unholy rehash of ""The Exorcist"" and numerous other genre films of the period, exploiting the actual murders that occurred in the house and adding doses of sexuality (including incest!) under the direction of Damiano Diamiani.

Shot in New Jersey (exteriors) and Mexico (interiors), ""Amityville II"" leaves one with a sour taste, mainly due to its attempt to explain the brutal killings by having the teen son responsible for the crimes being possessed by a demon. The movie has an eclectic cast, with James Olson as a priest who attempts to exorcise the teenager of all evils, Burt Young as the doomed father of the Montelli clan, Moses Gunn as an attorney and Diane Franklin (seen also in ""The Last American Virgin"" during the summer of `82) as the eldest Montelli daughter. The make-up effects are okay in an `80s gross-out kind of way, but the sequences showing the Montelli son running around, gunning down his family, leave an uncomfortable feeling that no amount of subsequent hocus-pocus can eradicate. (For the movie's defenders, ask yourself if most folks today would enjoy watching an exploitation film about the Newtown shootings with the gunman's actions being explained by him being possessed by a gooey-green monster)

A film that's always carried a notorious reputation for that reason, ""Amityville II"" makes its Blu-Ray debut sporting the most amount of supplements in Shout's box-set: a 10-minute interview with the Italian director (who passed away earlier this year) is on-hand, as are recent conversations with Diane Franklin and co-stars Rutanya Alda and Andrew Prine, plus writer Tommy Lee Wallace, who was about to make his directorial debut on ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" when he took the assignment to pen the sequel/prequel. There's also a lengthy talk with Hans Holzer's daughter, Alexandra, who discusses her father's work and also participates in a limp commentary track filled with long silences. The trailer, a fresh 1080p AVC encoded transfer and 5.1 DTS MA stereo and mono audio round out the release.

With Richard Fleischer at the helm, the following year's AMITYVILLE 3-D offers a superior viewing experience, seemingly more influenced by ""Poltergeist"" and similar supernatural tales than its predecessors (the movie was even released with a disclaimer that it was unrelated to either of the previous ""Amityville"" films). Tony Roberts and Tess Harper play the latest fun couple to move into the Amityville house, just to prove writer Roberts' theory that the hauntings are just a hoax. Unfortunately for them - and their daughter Lori Laughlin - the Baxters find out the hard way that the spectral scares are indeed real.

William Wales' script and Howard Blake's score are both a cut-above the norm, and while nobody will mistake ""Amityville 3-D"" with a classic of its kind, the movie is a big upgrade on the second film and even offers one or two eerie moments (particularly after Laughlin drowns). The anamorphic frame also gives the movie the most cinematic look of the entire series, and presented here in its proper Arrivison 3-D dimensions, the movie at last restores its most entertaining element: its stereoscopic effects, which (while blurry around the edges - an inherent issue with the Arrivision-shot films of the era) are competently executed by Fleischer.

Shout's 3D Blu-Ray of ""Amityville 3-D"" enables viewers with 2D sets to enjoy the film as well (the disc will default to either 3D or 2D depending on your set-up), though 3D is clearly the way to go if you have the ability to view its original format. The transfer is like looking at a Viewmaster reel in motion - a far cry from most of today's tepid 3D offerings. Extras include a brief trailer and a new interview with Candy Clark, who discusses her work in the film, which - like ""Amityville II"" - was shot mostly on Mexican soundstages.

The set utilizes the original theatrical one-sheets for its individual Blu-Ray cases, though as of yet, Shout has no intention of releasing the discs individually.",1381363200,6,7902,5.1210240496508925

5839618,5,B00DOZNF1O,"better than the 2005 MGM Boxset if you have this then try to sell it or throw it out
and buy this new Blu-ray box set of the Amityville Horror film series
incredible box set Definitely worth the money
this box set released by Scream factory which is part of shout factory
contains all 3 Amityville movies on blu-ray each Disc has their own case
and the artwork is excellent plus the Discs have artwork to (Pictured Discs)

if you're a new fan of this film series i'll tell you a bit about the plot of all 3 films
THE AMITYVILLE HORROR released in Theaters 1979 which is based on the novel of the same name is an incredible piece of work
a really Good supernatural chiller, very creepy, along with that is Great Acting by James Brolin and Margot kidder
and also well Directed by Stuart rosenberg
it's about the Lutz family that move into this particular house that happens to be haunted by Evil spirits
and they experience alot of Supernatural events through out the whole film, Unexplained events, Ghosts etc
after the first 30mins the film starts to get very creepy and bizarre at the end of the film the Lutz family were very lucky
not to get possessed by the Evil spirits in the house and the Lutz family fled the House and never returned for their property
if you believe in the supernatural you'll get a real kick out of the film, if you don't then you might not find it scary, you might find it boring
so it depends who's watching it really.
the film is very well Directed and well Actored so i found it scary regardless
THE AMITYVILLE HORROR is Widescreen, the picture quality looks excellent, it's beautiful Blu-ray transfer with High Definition Audio
the surround sound quality is pretty Good for an old film like this, scream factory really did make an effort to enhance the picture and audio in Blu-ray quality
Definitely better than the MGM DVD release from 2005

AMITYVILLE II-THE POSSESSION released in Theaters 1982 which is based on the book Murder in Amityville by Hans Holzer who's a supernatural investigator/Ghost hunter
this sequel is actually a prequel set 1 year before the Lutz family moved into the house
this sequel which i think is just as frightening at the original classic has brilliant Directing by Damiano Damiani
Burt young as the controlling father steals the film aswell as Rutanya Alda who plays the mother
the 2 kids get Abused and bullied by their father, the mother gets slapped around alot
the Eldest son gets possessed by the Evil spirit in the house and kills his whole family by Shotgun
and that is basically the plot so it's a prequel to the original
this film holds no punches there's tons of suspense and terror from the first scene til the last scene i found some scenes were difficult to watch
cause the Acting made it look so real, Brilliant Actor Burt young and Rutanya Alda
and there's incest overtones by older brother and sister, no sex scenes just a bit of intimacy which was Disturbing.
this film is also presented in beautiful High Definition Widescreen, the picture and audio quality is amazing much better than the 2005 MGM release

and the last sequel AMITYVILLE 3-D released in Theaters 1983 which is actually a sequel/a continuing story from the first film
similar plot to the original classic i'm not going to explain the whole film, you can look it up on wikipedia
but the film is suppose to be in 2-D and 3-D, you need a 3-D player and TV to watch the film in 3-D and i have neither
so i only watched the film in 2-D so i can't review the 3-D version
the film's plot is still scary but not as frightening as the first 2 films in my opinion
again this 3rd sequel is in Widescreen High definition for the first time ever so the picture and audio quality does look better than DVD for sure

now to the Special features, unlike the 2005 MGM Boxset that had no extras at all for the 2nd and 3rd film, the original had a making of Documentary etc
this new blu-ray boxset is the best for any Amityville horror fan
the first blu-ray still has the Making of Documentary with James brolin and Margo kidder plus the Audio commentary by Hans Holzer
there is a brand new interview with Music composer Lalo Schifrin
plus stills Gallery, Theatrical trailer and TV spots

with Amityville II the special features are incredible,
about 90 mins of interviews if you played them altogether but you can't select that on the Menu so you have to watch them seperatly
Interview with Director Damiano Damiani goes for about 5mins
Interview with Tommy lee wallace who wrote the screenplay about 15mins
Interview with Dianne Franklin who played the Older sister in the film, goes for 15mins
Interview with Rutanya Alda goes for 15mins, Andrew prine who played the priest is interviewed for only 5mins
and Alexandra Holzer is interviewed for the longest about 30mins, she talks about her fathers involvement in the Amityville series.

all Great interviews all interesting to watch

Alexandra Holzer does an Audio commentary for this film which i haven't heard it might be interesting commentary or might not.
there's no Behind the scenes featurette/footage unfortunately but there's a still Gallery, Theatrical trailer and TV spots

Amityville 3-D has some special features, it does not say them on the cover art
but there's 2 interviews one with Candy clark who plays Melanie in the film and another interview with another Actor from the film
there's no commentary or Interview with Director Richard Fleisher
which i'm not bothered about cause Amityville 3 is an alright sequel, the first 2 were the best of the series in my opinion

so scrap the old 2005 MGM boxset and definitely get this new Blu-ray boxset by Scream factory definitely worth the money.
the only fault with this blu-ray boxset is the price
amazon have this for $60 which is a bit of a ripoff in my opinion, but if you buy direct from scream factory website you'll only pay $50
and DVDempre has this boxset for $50 aswell so amazon has most expensive price.

but get rid of the MGM boxset and get this Scream factory blu-ray box set, definitely for the fans.",1380931200,6,6063,4.61595547309833

8595647,4,B00DOZNF1O,"The original ""Amityville Horror"" (1979) was, and remains, a dumb exploitation flick masquerading as a serious film on the merit of its being based on a ""true story."" That the story later turned out to be a hoax removed that mask. Thanks to weird filmmaking choice after weird filmmaking choice, it's more often hilarious or bewildering today than it is scary.

""Amityville 2"" (1982) is also an exploitation flick, but prouder of it. Holy moley, what a sick, wonderful movie. A prequel to the first, it's a better-made film, has a more coherent story, more engaging performances, better set pieces and scares, and is wildly offensive. Trigger warning: there's a LOT of domestic abuse in this movie, and it takes a variety of forms. There's also a dude-peels-face-off scene that gave me nightmares as a kid.

""Amityville 3-D"" (1983): The most low-key, though occasionally just as goofy as moments in the other two. The story is solid. Performances are generally okay to good. A very young Meg Ryan skates by on cuteness in a nothing role, while a pre-""Full House"" Lori Loughlin shines in the film's best sequence, an eerily quiet gut-punch in the third act.

The first two films look and sound very good to great on Blu-ray. Some reviewers have said the ""Amityville 3-D"" BD looks way too soft and complained of consistent and egregious chromatic aberrations. As for the chromatic aberrations, they're there just as much on the DVD, and I'm confident they were there when the film was shot; 3-D was clunky back then. Regarding the softness, which has been the main complaint: to my eye it looks better, and closer to the source, than the processed paint-daub edges on the DVD.",1508976000,,1673,4.8426573426573425
