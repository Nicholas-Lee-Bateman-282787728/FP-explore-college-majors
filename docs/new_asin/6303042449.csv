558914,5,6303042449,"O'Donnell, Dreyfuss and Estevez make a great team in this movie. It is an all around humorous flick. I think everyone will get a kick out of it.
Dreyfuss and Estevez's characters team up with O'Donnell to stakeout a place in Washington State, after a witness for a murder came out of an explosion alive (while she was under protection with the police to testify in that trial for the murder). Now that she's missing and presumed alive, they've narrowed down to stakeout this couple in Washington-whom they think would be a place that the witness would run to hide from the murderer and/or police.",996364800,,596,4.685714285714286

Two detectives(Dreyfuss and Estevez) are assigned to Steakout an escaped convict's ex girlfriend(thinking he'll return to her).While one the detectives are steaking out the ex girlfriend, the other detective falls in love with the ex girlfriend while he was in her house bugging the phone.

558916,5,6303042449,"Richard Dreyfuss, Emilio Estevez and Rosie O' Donnel are fantastic. The movie is very funny, funnier the first stake out but rather limited in  action. This movie was not big on the big office but I strongly believe if  they make another sequel involving the three main characters, it will be  big. The chemistry between Dreyfuss and Estevez in my opinion is better  than Mel and Danny (Lethal Weapon). Get it you won't be sorry.",965260800,,429,4.68
558917,4,6303042449,"The Chemistry between the 2 leads is what makes these movies so much fun. And the Addition of Rosie was a Stroke of Genious.

559042,3,6303042449,Another Stakeout is better then the first one.  It has action and comedy.  One of the highlights is Emilio Estevez  has to shave his mustache to look younger to go u under cover and just about has a break down over it.  And this is the best thing Rosie O'Donnell has ever been in.  I won't get into myy feelings about her.  Let's just say she is not my favorite.

Richard Dreyfuss ['Mr. Holland's Opus'], Emilio Estevez ['Young Guns I & II'] and Rosie O'Donnell ['Sleepless In Seattle'] light up the screen in the action-packed hit, 'Another Stakeout.' Once again, Seattle detectives Det. Chris Lecce and Det. Bill Reimers are teaming up on a stakeout, but this time they're bringing along a headstrong female partner, Gina Garrett [Rosie O'Donnell], and her mischievous dog, Archie. Together, they're posing as the perfect family and it looks like these unlikely housemates might just catch their suspect...if they don't kill each other first. Twice the fun of the original 'Stakeout' and this star-studded action comedy will have you howling with laughter.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: Older but not especially wiser, Det. Chris Lecce [Richard Dreyfuss] and Det. Bill Reimers [Emilio Estevez] are back to do it again in this amiably undemanding sequel to the 1987 hit, 'Stakeout.' Working as an undercover police detail in Seattle, Det. Chris Lecce [Richard Dreyfuss] and Det. Bill Reimers [Emilio Estevez] are abruptly pressed back into stakeout service when the prime government witness in a mob case disappears after a fiery attempt on her life in a Las Vegas ""safe"" house. The witness, Lu Delano [Cathy Moriarty] is thought to be hiding out with the O'Haras [Marcia Strassman and Dennis Farina] on scenic Bainbridge Island, and the assignment to watch the O'Haras house for signs of Lu Delano is straightforward enough until the duo learn they are to be supervised by federal prosecutor Gina Garrett [Rosie O'Donnell].

Creating further complications is Det. Chris Lecce's now-rocky relationship with Maria McGuire [Madeleine Stowe]. Det. Chris  Lecce's quarry-turned-love interest from his earlier adventure, Maria McGuire is now so impatient with Det. Chris Lecce's inability to commit that Maria McGuire goes home to her mother and is considering a move to Vera Cruz to take a new job. While trying to patch things up with Maria McGuire, Det. Chris Lecce and Det. Bill Reimers must also contend with Lu Delano, who keeps threatening to blow their cover by doing such things as inviting the O'Haras over for dinner. Det. Chris Lecce tries to take advantage of the dinner by sending Det. Bill Reimerss to plant a bug in the O'Haras house. However, he is knocked out by Lu Delano, who mistakes him for a mob killer. She is about to finish off Bill Reimerss and drop him off a pier when Det. Chris Lecce and Lu Delano arrive to save him and take Lu Delano into custody.

John Badham may never make another film as big as 'Saturday Night Fever' or his earlier telemovies. But when it comes to putting a talented cast together and through their paces, he has few peers in mainstream film making. 'Another Stakeout' requisite action sequences are exciting and help compensate for the less than tight plotting of scenarios Jim Kouf's script. The climax, in particular, depends upon Lu Delano's inability to recognise either Lecce or Reimers as cops despite having had to wrestle with both of them the night before. It also depends upon Lu Delano's insistence on bringing her entire federal entourage to the O'Haras front door after earlier taking pains to conceal their role in helping her elude the mob and the feds. After all that, the O'Haras inexplicably aren't even home, presumably because their presence would only complicate the climax.

Richard Dreyfuss and Emilio Estevez tackle their roles like the seasoned pros they are, and while neither Jim Kouf nor John Badham gives them much room to breathe, their buddy bonding never becomes grating. Madeleine Stowe spends most of the film standing around and talking on the phone to Richard Dreyfuss, perhaps because her jeans are so tight that to sit down would be to risk catastrophe. Richard Dreyfuss scores laughs with a spoof on his famed pantyhose rant from 'The Goodbye Girl' and Rosie O'Donnell is consistently the funniest of the trio (thanks to her own flawless comic timing and to her good luck in having some of the film's choicest bits), but Dennis Farina gets the film's single biggest laugh as he shovels down an ice cream sandwich in record time so he and his wife can escape dinner-from-hell with the cops, whose farcical efforts to maintain their cover make them appear an offshoot of the Manson family. Exhausted though the action-cop-buddy-comedy genre is, 'Another Stakeout' manages to be fairly entertaining.

Blu-ray Video Quality  'Another Stakeout' features a decent 1080p high definition transfer. Though some inconsistencies include regular edge enhancement; occasional background noise; and what is sometimes a scrubbed, flat appearance; the image is otherwise fairly strong, albeit hampered by its two primary problems. Detailing is quite strong and the image is rather sharp, though a few scenes do go a little soft and several shots showcase downright smeary details, particularly around the edges of the frame. Colours are nicely revealed, maybe a bit on the dim side in a few places but brighter hues and particularly the red Mercedes convertible that plays prominently in the film are handled without a hitch. The image is practically free of pops, scratches, and other unwanted debris. This isn't the best-looking image out there, but the Mill Creek Entertainment transfer is very watchable.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  'Another Stakeout' arrives on Blu-ray with a stout 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack. Though it's without much in the way of flair, the track delivers smooth, spacious music and a surprisingly honest low end. It's not abundantly rich, clear, or satisfying, but it is heads and shoulders above some of the other recent Mill Creek Entertainment two-channel releases. The soundtrack could use a bit more energy in places; dialogue is sometimes a bit shallow and explosions could stand a touch more heft, but most action-oriented sound effects, especially a chair crashing down a flight of steps, a barrage of gunfire that dots the final minutes of the film are pleasantly handled, featuring a fair bit of strength and halfway decent clarity. Overall, the track manages to impress with the greater spacing, power, and clarity than previous Mill Creek Entertainment Blu-ray releases.

Finally, 'Another Stakeout' is a really good mediocre film. Nothing exceptional and memorable, but incredibly watchable and infinitely entertaining, it's a perfect representation of the kind of films John Badham makes. A great cast and even better interplay elevates the film another couple of notches. This isn't must-see-cinema, but 'Another Stakeout is a tough act to beat for a breezy and fun Saturday afternoon sort of Action/Comedy film. Mill Creek Entertainment's Blu-ray is technically, not at all bad. Relatively strong video and audio don't cancel out the complete absence of extras, but the low price and quality of this Blu-ray is worth purchasing. But sadly I do not understand why the previous film 'Stakeout' is not going to be released, as it was a brilliant very funny film and definitely a good companion to this Blu-ray disc. Highly Recommended!

Dreyfuss and Estevez go through the motions without apparent conviction and Rosie O'Donnell adds little to the mix. The absence of Madeleine Stowe, the sexy, beautiful, damsel in distress, in the original film, is  a hole that nobody is asked to fill. The tension  created by  her danger is absent this time while the danger to the woman in this case is never of much interest since no effort is made to establish her as a person.,

561182,1,6303042449,"Somewhere in the cobwebbed recesses of my moviegoing memory, amid the flood of 80's and 90's cop-buddy movies, I know I saw 1987's STAKEOUT.  Starring Richard Dreyfuss and Emilio Estevez as the requisite cop buddies, I have virtually no recollection of that hit movie of its day.  However, it apparently did well enough at the box office to warrant a sequel, because in 1993 the same creative team came together to turn out ANOTHER STAKEOUT.

Helmed by John Badham, a journeyman director who hit big in 1977 with SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER and went on to become a ubiquitous feature presence during the next two decades, ANOTHER STAKEOUT is reflective of the sheer competence Badham could usually be counted on to deliver.  Hamstrung by a clichd, by-the-numbers script by Jim Kouf (RUSH HOUR, NATIONAL TREASURE, STAKEOUT) that shoots for laughs amid the sparse action and consistently misses, Badham does his best with the lifeless material, turning out a slickly produced studio-level mediocrity.

I can't imagine any acting team bringing the comedy in Kouf's lame screenplay to any kind of life.  But with the forced chemistry of Dreyfuss and Estevez never gelling, the grate factor is only multiplied by the third comedic genius thrown into this mix - Rosie O'Donnell.

She plays assistant D.A. Gina Garrett, who has to go undercover with the two cops, staking out a house on Washington's Bainbridge Island where Brian and Pam O'Hara (Dennis Farina and Marcia Strassman) live, because they think that's where mob informant Lu Delano (Cathy Moriarty) is hiding out.  So, Dreyfuss and O'Donnell (who has to bring along her pet Rottweiler, Archie) pretend to be a married couple, with Estevez undercover as Dreyfuss' son.

After a fairly cool action opening, in which brutal hitman (are there any other kind?) Tony Castellano (Miguel Ferrer) attempts to take out Lu Delano by completely blowing up the Vegas house where she's under protective custody, the movie becomes a hackneyed retread of much better, more exciting films of the era (48 HOURS, BEVERLY HILLS COP, LETHAL WEAPON).  You would think that in a sequel the filmmakers would try to top themselves, but the scale of ANOTHER STAKEOUT is so minor that it's a testament to Badham's skill that he is able to breathe any life into this moribund property at all.

Oh, and if you ever had any desire to see Rosie O'Donnell from overhead in a bubble bath, this is the movie for you.",1312243200,4,2430,4.931372549019608
561183,2,6303042449,"While this is not as good as STAKEOUT, it's still very funny and I enjoyed watching it again in blu-ray.",1311552000,,104,4.25
561263,3,6303042449,"I watched the original Stakeout many times when I was 12 years old. I was 13 by the time the sequel hit the cinemas. I saw it at the now demolished UCI Cinema at Kinnaird Park in early 1994. The fact that it was a PG compared to the R-rated original didn't bother me (I wouldn't have been able to see it otherwise).

Chris and Bill are back, joined by then-closested Rosie O'Donnell and her big dog. A mob witness may or may not visit old friends for protection on the beautiful Pacific-Northwestern Bainbridge Island. Our heroes are in the house opposite and their sit-and-wait chore is all the more difficult by their new third-wheel partner. The chemistry between Dreyfuss and Estevez is still perfect, and you really get the sense that these guys work together very well. Shame they don't have a lot to do.

The only big fault with Another Stakeout is that all of the action happens at the very beginning and very end, leaving a massive chunk in the middle for bumbling and low-brow amusement. It works, but it feels very underwhelming when compared to the original. For a belated, throw-away sequel it has a surprising amount of continuity with the first film, normally you don't get that. Stylistically however, this is completely different. Where Stakeout was dark, gritty, and rugged Another Stakeout is glossy with high-key anamorphic Panavision photography. Since the rating was lowered I guess it made sense to change the look of the film.

Another Stakeout languishes in a weird gray area. It's more than above average, but never really achieves any kind of greatness, and for that reason I have to rate it lower than the first.

Touchstone licensed the rights for the film to Mill Creek for release on Blu Ray and it's a big step-up from the DVD in terms of AV quality, this time presenting it in the correct 2.35:1 aspect ratio in lovely 1080p. The end credits claim the film was merely in 'Dolby Stereo in Selected Theatres' and the DTS HD-MA 2.0 soundtrack works just fine. There are no extras whatsoever, and the production design of the Blu Ray and the package is really quite poor. But what do you expect for a budget title? At least it doesn't come in a horrible eco-case.",1306627200,3,2192,4.656330749354005

So to those customers in Region (B) who might want to purchase this Blu-ray movie it might also play in your Blu-ray player.,1306540800,2,394,4.266666666666667
561265,3,6303042449,"...but still good to watch. It's consistently funny and has a reasonable plot but you get the feeling it should have been better. Maybe it's too late to save the series with another movie but it would be great to see Richard Dreyfuss on the big screen again, he really is an under-appreciated and underrated actor.

The main problem with Another Stakeout is that it just isn't as strong as the first film. Sure it was funny and had childish humor but Stakeout had a hard edge that this sequel just doesn't equal. The dropping of the R-rating for a PG-13 might have made economic sense but it betrays fans of the original.

Second is all Another Stakeout has going for it is the endless arguing and fast-talking banter between the 3 characters. There's no perfect mix of smart-mouthing and action. In fact, the action is far too toned down and only really occurs at the very beginning and very end of the film.

And for all the work John Badham has done in the past, the direction is lacklustre and uninventive. With the sole exception of the cat's bum POV shot of course. And he does do a great job with the Pacific Northwest scenery. But enough with the in-jokes. Yes, they are fun but there's too many for a film like this.

If you're a fan of the first you might be disappointed at how diluted Another Stakeout is but you'll still laugh enough for it to be worthwhile and anything with Dennis Farina is always good.

561267,2,6303042449,"""That's it, nobody calls me Ed McMahon!""
- Emilio Estevez saying the funniest line from a rather dry sequel
""Another Stakeout"" was six years in the waiting. After the first film, ""Stakeout,"" made a huge splash at the box office in 1987 (the same year another cop-buddy film came out--can you guess which one?), everyone anticipated an unnecessary--but perhaps funny--sequel that would inevitably result after box office earnings were tallied up by film executives in an office somewhere.
Alas, the six years passed, and we got...this mess?
Richard Dreyfuss and Emilio Estevez reprise their roles as stakeout cops who get paired with a new partner in this watered-down sequel. The new partner is played by Rosie O'Donnell, who is so startlingly unfunny in this it almost makes you involuntarily switch off the television as soon as you see her chubby face smiling at you.
The story starts with a bang--literally--as a trial witness being protected by the CIA is unsuccessfully assassinated--and by that I mean: They die, she lives. What a surprise. (This is the type of scene where the villain is able to blow up a house but the witness just happens to be taking a stroll outside as it happens--or something like that--preventing her from dying along with the other agents who were previously protecting her. This type of thing was spoofed greatly in the truly underrated ""Last Action Hero."" It's not a joke in ""Another Stakeout."")

Unfortunately for the United States, the trial witness never returns--she runs away and doesn't let anyone know where she is. Afraid she may be in danger, afraid to lose a star witness, and believing that she might try to contact old friends, the gruff chief of police assigns the unlucky trio of Dreyfuss, Estevez and Donnell to watch the her old pals to see if she turns up.
She eventually does, of course, but first we get some painfully unfunny buddy-buddy moments between Dreyfuss and Estevez and O'Donnell. She brings a bunch of clothing and a dog with her. They don't like it. Har-har. This was used a bit better in ""Spaceballs,"" in which Princess Vespa brought along that entire luggage through the desert (remember?). This is just a copy of that scene, minus the punch line.
Estevez also shaves his mustache, which is supposed to be a type of sacred moment and is referenced at least ten times throughout the film (he goes to stroke his mustache, he complains about chopping it off, Dreyfuss complains about it, etc.). But for heaven's sake, he's only been in one film so far--we've only seen the mustache once--so a better thing to do would have been this: make a few more sequels and, when the last entry comes, have him shave it off. By then the audience realizes that his mustache is part of him, and that losing it is like losing part of his soul.
But I'm glad they didn't make any more than one sequel.
One of the things that kept the ""Lethal Weapon"" franchise going was the fresh ideas, fresh buddies, and fresh scripts. (Great actors never hurt an action comedy, either.) The ""Stakeout"" franchise--which didn't even last long enough to spawn more than one sequel--tries to copy this formula but isn't sure how. The introduction of Joe Pesci in ""Lethal Weapon 2"" was great because he thereby became the Third Stooge, whereas O'Donnell's entry into the series is nothing but a humiliating reminder that talk show hosts can't always act in front of a camera and maintain the same type of humor they may (or may not) exhibit on their (awful) TV ""talk show."" (Which is, by the way, consumed of entirely staged so-called ""interviews."")
And whereas Pesci, as Leo Getz, added a type of silly vibe to the ""LW"" series, O'Donnell just seems like a carbon copy clone of Estevez from the first ""Stakeout."" Dreyfuss didn't like him at first, and--guess what--they suddenly became best buds. The same thing happens in the sequel, much to the audience's chagrin.
Of course, ""Lethal Weapon"" and its sequels were never more than a few years apart (the first coming out in 1989, two years after the original). But ""Stakeout"" had six years to make a respectable sequel, and it fails. It fails the same way that many prolonged sequels do. But, for once, it's not because the audience has forgotten the original film--it's because the audience is fed up with the same routine.
The film was directed by John Badham, which is surprising, since he's a talented director (""Saturday Night Fever,"" ""The Hard Way,"" ""Stakeout""). Here he jumps through all the hoops, turning his own series into a pale retread of the original--only watered down: minus the violence, language, nudity, and humor. I'm not saying a movie has to be R to be funny. But if you've got a sequel to an R-rated movie like ""Stakeout"" and you decide to turn its sequel into a cutesy-tutesy children's entertainment program, you'd better advise the audience before they sit down expecting something funny and fresh.
