8351701,5,6303203922,"If you do this video regularly, you will see results. I've used it before on weight-loss plans and I have always been able to see my body change. Because of the warm up and cool down, I never got sore. And even when I was 150 pounds overweight, I could still do the video. It's my all time favorite.",1243641600,4,299,4.084745762711864
8351702,5,6303203922,"I am a jogger from Minnesota and I needed an exercise tape for inside when the weather prevents me from jogging. I have just placed an order for my second Cory Everson's Total Body Workout as I am fearful that my first one  will wear out. If inside exercise generally bores you to tears, Cory  alleviates the problem. This is a fast paced workout with enough variety to  keep you entertained. She includes a warm-up and cool down, trouble zone  toning,strength training,step training and circuit training, everything a  woman needs to maintain a healthy body in just one hour. It does require a  step, for step aerobics, and hand held weights, but there are no gimics, no  annoying music or irritating voices just a thoroughly enjoyable workout.",942969600,37,745,4.818897637795276
