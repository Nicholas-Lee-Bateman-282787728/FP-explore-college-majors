2054839,3,B0002235P8,"With all the crapola trying to pass itself off as horror these days, Deathwatch was an attempt to make an honest to God horror film.  Unfortunately, this is one of those films where you admire the effort more than the film itself.  I do love the effort here.  The film looks great, it obviously had a budget behind it, and I'm sure it had a theatrical run in England.  The acting was good all around as well.  The story has a bunch of soldiers during WWI taking over a German trench in some unknown territory, and eventually finding out that it's basically haunted.  Great concept-haunted trench in WWI.  The down side of this is that the film just isn't scary, nor does it really pull you in.  There's a cool scene straight out of Children Of The Corn with ""something"" tunnelling under the ground(looks like Bugs Bunny when he tunnels around), some barbed wire with a mind of it's own, and some rats eating a guy's legs off.  These are the only ""horror"" parts that really stand out, and that's not much out of a 96 minute film.  Still, I'd suggest checking it out, coz if this film is any indication of things to come from this director, we may be in luck",1088208000,,1156,4.384976525821596
2054840,3,B0002235P8,"""Deathwatch"" (2002) is a British horor film set in the battle of WWI.  It stars Jamie Bell (""Billy Elliott"") as the rookie soldier Charlie Shakespeare, who lied about his age when enlisting for the army.
Shakespeare, after a fierce combat against the German army, finds himself in the uncharted territory somewhere behind the enemyline, with nine survivors from his Y-Company.  The soldiers, however, encounters three Germans in the trench, and despite the warning to go away from the place, they seize it, capturing one of them.  The radio contact is lost, and the place is infected with rats and dead bodies, but the most uncomfortable thing is yet to come, in the shape of something unknown.  Someone, or something must be there, possibly not a German who had run away....
The film belongs to the supernatural horror, in which many bizarre things happen around the soldiers whose fear gradually turn into a frenzy, and ""Deathwatch"" is a mixed bag at that.  Some scenes are really scary, but the logics behind these strange things are often weak, and even too philosophical.
The actors, besides Bell, include Andy Sarkis (""Gollum"" of ""Lord Of The Ring""), Ruaidhri Conroy, Lawrence Fox, Dean Kris Marshall, Hugh O'Conner, Hans Matheson, Hugo Spear, Matthew Rhys, and Dean Lennon Kelly.  The acting is good, and Bell expresses the innocence of the boy who should learn something about the war and humanity under severe conditions.
The production designs of the water-soaked trench is perfect, and the images are often memorable, showing the visual flair of the first-time director Michael J. Basset.  Though the film cannot sustain the tense because of the lack of logics, it is worth watching for the fans of genre, or Jamie Bell.",1085788800,3,1731,5.010452961672474

2054853,5,B0002235P8,"This is not a film for everybody as it is a cross-genre film. It's an historical horror/thriller film, which can produce mixed emotions from its audience, depending on one's expectations of what a film like this should be.

Having said that, if you're a lover of subjective subject matter and storylines this is a great one for you, as it will have you thinking about it long after the credits roll.

I don't really want to give up anything about this film, as anything I could offer would tarnish the individual experience of the film; yes it really is an ambiguous film which some movie-goers don't appreciate. Some people need all of the answers handed to them (which is fine), and if you fall into that camp this film will most likely not appeal to you.

For me, it was a fine example of perfect film-making. Well written, well acted, beautifully filmed and creepy as hell!

2055040,3,B0002235P8,"WARNING:  CONTAINS SPOILERS!  I wasn't quite sure what to make of this film.  It's an interesting, claustrophobic piece from an era (WWI) that isn't really covered in films much these days, and has a good, eerie atmosphere.  Some technical nitpicking aside [the British uniforms are more or less period correct, but they're armed with No 4 MK I Enfields from WWII rather than No 3 pattern SMLEs (if you're not a gun person you won't care, but to a collector or a history buff the two rifles look distinctly different), and the German stuff is all WWII from their gear to their weapons], the filmmakers did a good job of recreating the period.  However, the film was inconsistent with the supernatural vs. psychological, ""degrading nature of war"" theme that it was trying to present, and couldn't seem to make up its mind as to whether German zombies or some psychological factor causing the men to turn on one another were the main antagonists of the film.  The ""war is hell"" idea has been done before without having to resort to a Twilight Zone, ""they don't realize they're dead and reliving the war over and over again as Purgatory,"" twist ending.  Still, I did care enough about the characters to want to see what happens to them, so the film was successful there.  Not stellar, but not bad.",1444089600,,1294,4.669603524229075

I like my share of both genres, but this movie combines both in a competent but slightly lackluster way. There's not a lot of blood, not a lot of war and not a lot of clear plot. By the end, you can make out what's been going on (and I won't spoil it here) but some people will find the getting-there to be too much. Still, what I like about it is the presentation. The crushing depression of the WWI setting is really the true horror here, and it is presented splendidly. The period details are gorgeously rendered, really more of a museum piece of a WWI trench than a movie. That is probably why I watch it;The accurate uniforms,  the mud, corpses and grinding tension all combine to Put-You-There in trench warfare. As far as a being an entertaining movie, however, it's less successful. The characters are hard to get a grip on, the situation is amorphous for most of the running, and the obligatory horror movie Threat isn't well delineated, ever. The clues make it easy enough to guess what went on once the ending has rolled around, but they never spell anything out directly and some people, again, might not like to work that hard.

2055061,4,B0002235P8,"This is a pretty original British horror and I rather liked it, with especially the ending being particularly strong.

This film begins with a night attack launched by a large British unit (maybe a division) somewhere on Western front in 1917. German resistance is however very strong and casualties are heavy. A little group of soldiers from one of companies (Y company) gets lost in the no man's land and when wandering in the morning mists they find a German advance trench kept by only three soldiers. This advanced post is quickly taken and the only British officer present, Captain Jennings (Laurence Fox), decides to hold this position until reinforcements arrive. However pretty quick it becomes clear, that there is something wrong with this place...

What follows is a pretty well thought and well made little horror movie with some strong scenes and some unsuspected twists. Jamie Bell plays the main character, a barely 16 year old Private Charlie Shakespeare and he does a very good job. Andy Serkis gives a great show as Private Thomas Quinn, a pretty mean guy who actually enjoys the war and Hugo Speer is excellent as a tough, highly professional veteran, Sergeant Tate. All other soldiers (Corporal ""Doc"" Fairweather and Privates McNess, Hawkstone, Starinski, Bradford, Chevasse) also have some screen time and we get to know them before bad things begin to happen - and this is a pretty good thing.

The realities of trench warfare on Western Front in WWI are pretty well shown. Mud and rats are omnipresent, barbed wire plays an important role and we can almost smell all the decaying bodies left unburried in the no man's land. Some pretty special weapons which were really used in World War I are shown in the film, like the bayonet fitted on a Webley revolver (not a very practical thing and therefore quickly discarded) and also a wooden club spiked with nails (a surprisngly effective weapon in close quarters combat in a crowded narrow trench). At one moment we can also see a Bergmann MP18 sub-machine gun, which is an anachronism, as this weapon was not yet in production in 1917 (and also the version we can see is the one produced AFTER the end of WWI).

This is a very, very violent film and therefore should absolutely be reserved for adults.

There are some weaker moments in the second part of the film, but the ending is pretty strong and this is a precious thing. I liked ""Deathwatch"", although I can not exactly say that I enjoyed it. It is a pretty clever, well done film, warmly recommended to all horror amateurs.",1357516800,,2552,4.777777777777778

You won't see demons or much in the ways of spooks, but you will feel the depair and anguish of the actors as they exprience the horror.  There is considerable violence, so I do not recommend this movie for children, but for a horror movie, it does depict the true actions and the violence of war.

Basically, a group of WWI British soldiers go ""over the top"" in trench warfare and find themselves mired in a night battle.  CUT TO: The same soldiers walking across a quiet foggy battlefield.  They soon happen on a forward German trench with three otherwise-preoccupied German soldiers in it. The Brits take the trench, ultimately leaving one of the Germans alive.  (The common language between the Brits and the German is French.)  Fine so far.

*** BEWARE POSSIBLE SPOILERS ***
Now, what ensues in the trench from this point on will not necessarily add up from a logical standpoint because this in not your standard horror fare, with explanations as to what's going on, what the deal is with the trench, etc.  This is really a ""thinking"" horror film rather than a sit-back-and-be-entertained horror movie, the latter of which was my expectation.  It's more about personal redemption than anything else.  Thus, what you see happening in the trench may not ""actually"" be happening.

Also, pay particular attention to the part where one of the Brits steps into the rotting guts of a frozen soldier on the foggy battlefield.  Then pay attention the next time you see it much later on.

It has some of the best trench warfare footage I've seen and the uniforms and equipment used are all dead-on perfect for 1917.  It's not a gore-fest gruesome flick, more of a suspense thing, although there are some fairly gruesome scenes, so this isn't for kids.

Deathwatch is far better than many horrors I have seen recently. It may not be worth quite four stars, but I rounded up because although a bit gory in parts, I never felt it was trying to be gory for the sake of gore. War is gory and so here it is appropriate.

However, this origin or purpose of this ""evil force"" is never explained.  It manifests itself in a variety of seemingly random, weird ways that aren't really all that original or scary.

Then I came back a day later and watched the last hour and was pretty much glued to the TV.  See, what this movie does is what so many modern horror movies don't do, which is create a sustained creepy mood level throughout.  It makes you feel like at any moment something could happen even when nothing much of note is.  And THAT is what horror is all about.

Another thing that greatly adds to the mood is that background ""void"" music.  It's like a creepy little brief wind/void sound that really adds to the environment perfectly.  I think it's one of the main reasons I was so drawn into the movie.  Excellent choice of background sound.

I cannot forget to praise the actual look and feel of the trenches as well.  That was the other mood grabber.  The trench is almost like its own character.

The special effects are what they are.  They're not insulting but not the greatest.  But they're used so little it doesn't matter.  And since this whole thing isn't in real time anyway that can be used as a crutch reason why.  They shouldn't ruin anything for anybody.

The major setback is in relation to some of the acting and some of the dialogues e.g. Andy Sarkis' character is just too much (he is a psychopath); it is indeed very hard to believe that one would find such characters and such lack of discipline in the British army of that time.  Yes it is war, yes it is the horrible war of the trenches, but still the British very rarely had to deal with such breakdowns in the chain of command as other armies have often faced.  Nevertheless, it is not supposed to be a true story, but fiction, so no argument there.

2055087,2,B0002235P8,"I absolutely dig Weird War stories.

When I was a kid I came across a trunk full of old pulp comics in a reclusive, eccentric relative's attic, long stowed away, guarded by spiders, stinking of must and reeking of decrepit, forgotten time.

The chest was stuffed with the horror classics, the shivery, nasty, brutally gruesome little grand guignol of the American printed page: ""Tales from the Crypt"", ""The Vault of Horror"", ""Ripley's Believe it or Not"" (astonishingly twisted back in the day, actually), and best of all---to my furiously bloodthirsty adolescent mind---""Weird War Tales"".

The cover art alone was always deliciously, wickedly morbid, grotesque, blood-curdling---macabre. You'd get the doomed and damned stock characters: the impeccably groomed SS sturbandfuehrer, resplendent in the habilments of Evil, jackboots a-gleam and monocle glinting, ready to discharge a shell from his service Luger into the skull of some cowering victim---completely unaware of the slavering ghoul about to pounce on him from the smoky, coiling darkness.

Or you'd have a vignette, lovingly detailed right down to the swamp grass and baobab trees, of a squad of US soldiers (Pacific theater), deep on patrol in the jungle, coming upon a small boy, squatted on his haunches, back to the GIs, face to us. The boy, a diminutive Filipino or Japanese, looks unassuming to the patrol, but to the viewer---to me, stunned in that long-ago attic---he is the portrait of Terror, with long fangs jutting from his mouth, and eyes green with evil---and hunger.

War calls up the primal, bloodletting Monster: already soaked in blood and caked in gore and terror, it is a powerful frontier for Horror of another sort. That's why I made an effort to track down this little micro-budget British flick, billed as a ghoulish romp into the horrors of World War I trench warfare---and we're not just talking artillery, machine gun nests and mustard gas. And how many World War I horror flicks are out there, anyway?

If ""Deathwatch"" is any indication, this might be the first and last.

A patrol of British soldiers huddles in a trench; artillery shells explode overhead, dirt patters against their helmets. The command comes down the line: the boys have to go ""Over the Top""---leave the relative safety of their Trench to rush the Germans nestled in theirs. Almost certainly a suicide mission. We watch as, one by one, the troopers get mowed down, tangled in barbed war, slaughtered.

Next scene: mystifyingly, in a fog-enshrouded thicket. All of the patrol is there, suggesting either a) we've moved back in time or b) the troopers didn't really get mowed down in the opening sequence. There is a (c), of course, but I'll get to that in a second.

The British Tommys stumble upon a forward German trench, shoot two of the three Krauts guarding it (easily surprised, as they appear to be covering something *within* the trench), take the other German prisoner, and dig in, given the cold company of the mud-covered corpses, rats, and the rain. Oh, and did I mention?: the sense that something is very, very wrong.

Bad news: that description, with one single exception, is about as scary as this ambitious but fatally flawed movie---and ultimately terminally boring---film ever gets. Here's what you get instead: Soldiers set up camp in Trench system. Soldiers scream at each other in nearly impenetrable Cockney accents. Pretty much everybody dies, some at the hands of their buddies, some at the hands of the Concertina wire (evidently the wire likes the ""Hellraiser"") series; everybody screams constantly. The End.

There are no answers offered, or even suggested. Why does the razorwire like to get some good quality face time with the British Tommys? Why did the original Kraut occupants of the trench slaughter each other, and why is the British patrol following suit? I talked about Alternative ""c"" above, here it is: if the patrol is dead, and the trench is purgatory, then who is judging the Dead, and on what grounds? And the biggest question of all: would it really have killed the makers of ""Deathwatch"" to get a decent script? Ambiguity is one thing; incoherence is something else.

In ""Deathwatch""'s defense, trench warfare never looked so nasty, and it's evident from the care taken with the set---which reeks of death---that ""Deathwatch"" was a labor of love. The acting here is all competent, though erring on the side of histrionic: Lawrence Fox (Captain Bram Jennings) calls to mind the WWI Blackadder series, Andy Serkis (Quinn) makes a buddy of a spikey club and manages to be even uglier than his Gollum incarnation, and Jamies Bell (Shakespeare) is fine---if whiney crybaby cowards are your cup of tea.

There is also one single, electric thrill (that and the set design get ""Deathwatch"" its two stars): a lone sentry spotting three 'interlopers' standing deadly still at the end of a trench. It's a spooky scene, but to get to it requires slogging through 50 minutes of deadly dull stuff, and even this scene is prefaced by the fat, flabby, dirty sentry masturbating to some vintage German porn. I don't know if your idea of a good scary movie requires having a fat British soldier yanking his John Bull, but I am *so* not there.

Does a decent set and one good scare justify sitting through an otherwise painful mess of a movie? You be the judge: go AWOL or over the Top. I'm not going to enlist for ""Deathwatch"".

2055088,5,B0002235P8,"I liked this film. It was quirky, had a sting in the tale and had a cast of excellent characters, from a young and innocent Private who tries to understand the horrors of war, a man about to loose his faith in God, a solider who wants to survive the war with the minimum of guilt, a dying teenager who has been shot in the spine and unaware of the horrors to come and to a psychotic solider who will kill anyone, friend or foe.

Add to this a German soldier, played with sinister and frightening conviction by unknown actor, Roman Horak and you have a seat of your pants film that you shouldn't watch on your own!

However like many low budget movies, especially those that come of the UK criticism and panning is the name of the game.

Now this REALLY gets up my nose! Come on guys, this isn't America you know, we don't have the sort of greenbacks to pay for state of the art special effects in any movie that is British funded. We have to rely on spit, prayers, private investors and God's good will.

The acting was good overall, with most of the actors showing some nice restraint. Typically, you give an actor a period military uniform, a gun, and some exclamation points in the dialogue and you have a recipe for disaster. Points go to the director for keeping a lid on the overly dramatic yelling and screaming.

The movie plunges you into the atmosphere of WW1 trench warfare in a way that immediately has your nerves on a raw edge.  If there is a more horrific place to be than in the trenches during WW1, I haven't heard of it.  The fear is creeping and constant and that's just the danger presented by German soldiers, shell barrages or insidious gas.  The movie starts off with enough of a taste of this to get you in the mood.  Following this, a small band of British survivors from the opening battle end up lost in fog and stumble upon a mysterious German trench system nearly all but abandoned, and full of decomposing bodies.  From here on in you have a building tension not unlike that found in `Alien' or `the Thing', where group members start dying one by one.  The supernatural force behind all this manifests itself in a somewhat inconsistent way, and yet the tension and creepiness just keep on keeping on. The script writers have tried just about every trick in the book to add tension and by and large it works.  A key to this for me was that I found it easy to sympathise with the survivors.  The largely unfamiliar actors and strong atmospherics give this movie a weird feeling that actually works in its favour.

2055092,3,B0002235P8,"Although much-hyped as a horror film during production, 'Deathwatch' obviously shifted tone substantially in post-production towards a depiction of the everyday horrors of the Great War and seems all the better for it. Although there are vague similarities to Michael Mann's disappointing 'The Keep' and its truly dreadful British rip-off 'The Bunker,' this is both more ambitious and successful than either. A more accurate comparison would be to John Ford's rarely revived 'The Lost Patrol,' where a group of soldiers lost in the desert turn on each other as their situation worsens.

The production design is for the most part impeccable: unlike the studio-bound and cliche-ridden 'The Trench,' this offers one of the most realistic screen recreations of trench life at its worst, rats and all. Where the opening battle sequence never quite seems intense enough, the mundane realities of surviving daily life in what is little more than an open grave leave a lasting impression.

There are problems: some of the attitudes are wrong for the period, as are occasional lines of dialogue (such as references to then-nonexistent holiday camps or contemporary slang such as 'plank'). It's not even remotely frightening, and only begins to chill with its oddly touching ending (which bears more than a little similarity to a famed Bruce Joel Rubin script, the title of which would ruin the ending for anyone who hasn't seen it). But, unlike most British efforts of recent years, it is a real film with ambition and a sense of scale that deserved better at the box-office and is well worth a look.",1100476800,,1592,5.072519083969466

They find one that's abandoned and decide to secure it until reinforcements arrive to help them get past enemy lines.  The soldiers will soon discover that they are not alone in the trench like they originally thought they were, and it's not German soldiers stalking them but something else.  Something not quite human...

I've always been fascinated by films that fuse the war and horror elements and this one could have been seriously scary.  I can't think of too many more unpleasant things than spending the night in a muddy, feces-filled bunker surrounded by dead German bodies, squeaking rats and pouring rain.  So the concept and general idea was good but where this film suffered was in its execution and content.  True, it's a low budget film but still could have been great, look at the film ""Dog Soldiers"" for a prime example.  One thing that bothered me was the insistence on filming battle scenes in a close-up style, it just gave the film a cheapo look as though everything was not filmed in a field but inside of a studio.

The cast (including LOTR's Andy Serkis) look deeply involved, maybe a little too much so.  The actors are talented for the most part but they overact in so many scenes that it gets ridiculous.  I was taken aback by the constant shouting, yelling, screaming.  I know they're faced with dire situations but aren't these grown men after all?  Trained to be soldiers no less?  Hearing them screech and wimper like a bunch of 10-year olds really got on my nerves after a while.  As for the ghostly apparitions, they took way too long to appear and by the time they did I felt that the movie had already run its course on me.

""Deathwatch"" is not necessarily a bad film, just a mediocre one, an honest attempt at serious horror that could have greatly benefited from more creative writing.

This story about a company of British footsoldiers in WW1 who stumble upon a haunted German trench could've been a lot better given the great production design and eerie setting.  What is lacking here is a script with some meat on it's bones.  A lot of time is killed watching the soldiers walk slowly around the trench calling each others names.  It just dosen't MOVE.  The acting is good from a young cast that includes ANDY SERKIS from LORD OF THE RINGS fame as the standout character, a psycho named QUINN who scalps Germans for kicks.  The trenches used are superbly spooky, and with a constant rainy grey look the film definitely sets the mood.  Alas, once mood is set nothing is done with it.  The pace is sluggish and the story never explaines any of the goings-on.  This flick takes you to a place you should be frightened of but never shows you (or tells you) what of or why you should be frightened.

As they spend their first night, it is more than German soldiers they have to worry about, somewhere within the trenches is something that is hunting them down one by one.

It sounds like your typical monster-horror film, but Deathwatch has more supernatural than slasher as its theme than anything else. The one film I can compare this to is Carpenter's The Thing. As more and more of the company dies, paranoia and suspicion grows amongst the rest as to who or what may be hunting them. A very good film that delivers on the suspense and horror.

I really enjoyed watching it, and will hopefully get the DVD, so that I will have access to the bonus features.
Great job Mr. Bassett!!! :-D",1089936000,,220,4.666666666666667
2055098,4,B0002235P8,"Ok first of all I get why there is no push for this movie.
The subject matter here hits way too close to home in every aspect past present and future.
Y-Company is disbanded into enemy territory with no idea where they are that is untill they find a german trench filled with dead bodies and a handfull of surviors.
What transpires for the next 96 minutes is so riveting and daring that one cant help but sit in awe of this little know nothing direct to vid shelf stuffer.
Yes it is a horror movie but not with the archtypical ghouls and goblins and ghosts that usually occupy most films in this genre no this is the kind of horror that goes straight for your head and succeeds.
Dont expect big surprises here just PLEASE PLEASE try and read between the lines because this movie has a very important message about humanity and what we have done with ourselves and to ourselves over time.
Deathwatch is nasty and clever and deserves liberal minded discussion.",1088812800,2,958,4.48
2055099,3,B0002235P8,"After viewing this movie I thought and thought about what it all meant.  Durring the beginning there is a scene of a very horrifying battle that leaves much of both sides dead.  The next scene is a group of lost Allied soldiers, which I thought died, taking over a haunted german trench.  The rest of the film is a psychological horror film where each cast member is killed by another cast member.  The scenes in the film are all shot with a very dark, rainy claustophobic look.  There is something in the trenches that plays on each soldiers worst fears and ends up making them go mad and kill each other.  I believe the Allied soldiers died in the beginning and the rest of the movie is them all living a nightmare in hell.  The movie has some pretty good supplemental stuff in the extras section.  There is not much gore.  There are plenty of frights thrown at you.  A very violent death scene with barbwire thrown in for utter chills.  I am an avid reader of WW1 and WW2 history and the film truly captures the trench warefare that made WW1 so terribley violent and horrible.  I would recommend a rent this instead of dishing out the $20 bucks for a copy.  Watch in a dark room with your mate and see and hear all the spooky stuff going on in the film.",1088553600,,1256,4.316239316239316

Oh and to the other dorks, whats your deffinition of horror? War is the most Horrifying thing in the world, then to add ghost into it?",1088467200,2,393,4.24

8020164,5,B0002235P8,"I absolutely love soldiers versus monsters or the supernatural sub genre of horror and this film did not disappoint! I found it a rather poetic film with some anti war undertones. Andy Serkis is in this film, yes he played Gollum in the Lord of the Rings saga, but in this film he plays a hate filled soldier with a deep blood lust. Incredible, I was just impressed.",1498003200,,366,4.397058823529412
8020165,4,B0002235P8,"Very well done film, I enjoy any and all war films, and find films about WWI very interesting as we see a recreation of life in the trenches. Then with the underlying evil, you get an outstanding thriller that will keep you glued to the screen and on the edge of your seat.",1493337600,,273,4.169811320754717
8020166,4,B0002235P8,"Great horror flick with a suspenseful slow burn that kept me interested throughout!  Pacing is pretty decent and enough atmosphere to set the right tone.  Notable performances by Serkis, Bell and company.  I found this film quite enjoyable, even with the use of some much exhausted horror tropes.  There are enough twists on old ideas that gave this movie a strong recommendation to other fans of the horror/suspense genre.",1490227200,,423,5.086956521739131
