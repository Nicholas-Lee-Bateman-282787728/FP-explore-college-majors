8512206,5,B0077T5SJU,"This is a great collection of TV series from l953-70.  Shout! Factory had previously issued a Christmas collection a few years back featuring many of these same shows.  With this batch, the emphasis is on love and romance, 1950's style.  Don DeFore is featured on two shows, as a supporting player on OZZIE & HARRIET, and as one of the stars on HAZEL. In the first. Harriet is afraid that son David will spend all his money on a new girl for Valentine's Day.  And on the latter, it's Shirley Booth as HAZEL, who is in for a jolt, when an old flame suddenly shows up.  Booth who won two Emmys for this show, is sharp and spunky, as the title character, and the awards are much deserved.  In THAT GIRL, Marlo Thomas and Ted Bessell, finally become engaged after a five year courtship.  This, the final season of TG, never shows them actually in wedded bliss, something that Thomas, son of Danny, insisted upon.  Still, it's a fun episode. Bessell had a great comic sense of timing and was much under-appreciated in his time.  Ronnie Schell, his comrade from Gomer Pyle, guests on this episode.  Best of all is FATHER KNOWS BEST featuring Billy Gray as ""Bud"" in love with an older woman who works at the Springfield supermarket.  This well written and much Emmy nominated series, displays in this outing why it is still considered one of the best ""family"" sitcoms of the 1950s! Watch the intricate wordplay and attention to little details that made this show stand-out from the pack. Episodes from LEAVE IT TO BEAVER and DENNIS THE MENACE (with the 2nd Mr. Wilson, Gale Gordon), are also featured.  As are THE PATTY DUKE SHOW.  It is a good chunk of Americana to have.",1342051200,5,1665,4.546979865771812
