8694746,1,B00RBYJM48,"I'm sure they're great, but when I opened them and tried to play them, I found I couldn't, because they're in UK format. I bought British movies by accident. The seller wouldn't let me return them because I unwrapped them. So I  was left with a box set of movies I couldn't watch, and I ended up throwing them in the trash.",1501977600,4,323,4.209677419354839

8694749,1,B00RBYJM48,"I just sat down to watch the first DVD in this set and got a lovely ""Region Error"" message.  There was NO MENTION of the region I needed to be in to watch this.  I now have a set of DVDs I can't watch because the seller forgot to include this vital information.

Oh, and it gets better - I just hit the postal service's website to get an idea of what I will have to spend to send it back.  It's a pittance - $90.00 in order to get one third of that back.

I should've known that the $30 price tag was too good to be true",1444176000,27,520,3.7339449541284404
