6094481,4,B00GO55NYS,"The dramatic debut feature by S. Viknesh, True Love is a classically styled detective story told in that dark film noir story fashion that fans of the genre will enjoy. The lead character, Ramesh, is saddened by personal problems and desirous of exiting his business, or at the least taking a break from it. When he's approached by a women seeking to locate her husband, he takes the case despite his reluctance. What follows is a psychologically twisting road leading to more than he expects.

The film weaves through a web of deceit and betrayal, and while not filled with action (there is some), the drama unfolds and finds its way to an ending not easily predictable.

Of note, it is filmed entirely on location in Singapore which is an added element. It is also mostly in English with sub-titles where required. It does have a indie foreign film flavor to it, but it is also presented with a lot of American style elements reflective of the 1950's classic genre.",1389139200,,967,4.682352941176471
8625283,5,B00GO55NYS,"It is easily a 4-star rating for being quite an ambitious Singaporean independent film. Not often you get to see a Singaporean movie that revolves around a main character of Indian descent who speaks mainly English and Tamizh in the film. Besides that, the photography is definitely worth of an extra star! Very stylishly shot on 16mm film, gritty, edgy, and daring, portraying Singapore in an unfamiliar light that's not of its typical image. The film is slow paced, and it is an attribute, the director does not rush in his storytelling. The story has its flaws, but as one gets to relate to the main character's restlessness. it doesn't become an obvious problem through the viewing.

With many American independent films that were able to become box office hits, such success and progress seem rare and slow in Asia. Particularly for Singaporean cinema, on which it doesn't seem to get as much exposure as its neighboring movie powerhouse. It's great to see a film like True Love that stands up to its 'independent' spirit. If you have a taste in Asian cinema and like to explore more into it, give this a watch!",1412294400,2,1116,4.752577319587629
8625284,5,B00GO55NYS,I love detective stories and this one was very well done. The story moved smoothly and the cinematography and direction was outstanding. Very impressive use of lighting to set mood and drive emotion.,1407196800,,199,5.0606060606060606
8625285,4,B00GO55NYS,"Viknesh Silva's first feature-length film is a nice blend of modernity & traditionalism, devotion & betrayal, surprises & the expected, religion & secular humanism, passion & malaise--all set in a rich Singaporean & Indian milieu which Westerners will find eye-opening.  The soft edges and ambiguity of the plot are enhanced w/ photographic technics including black & white, fast forward, grainy & dreamy scenes, and flashbacks which Silva expertly weaves in & out of his story.
""True Love"" has a subtle way of getting you to invest in her characters, both the good and the bad, and when it's over, your life has been expanded with knowing them, their location and their struggles.

8625286,5,B00GO55NYS,"I bought this movie on amazon while browsing, then bought the DVD to keep. I love it and I think most people can relate to it. What an awesome independent film. I have to disagree with all the one star reviews. I love love love it! Great actors, great script, great directing! Well done!!!!",1405209600,,290,4.388888888888889
8625287,5,B00GO55NYS,"I watched this movie when it premiered in Singapore, then bought the DVD. It was a great movie with an interesting plot. Exactly what you expect from a good independent film. The people with the 1 star rating must not have appreciated that it was done in a Singaporean fashion (with Singaporean actors)",1404345600,,302,4.716981132075472
8625288,5,B00GO55NYS,Love it! The suspense was killing me. Hated the Chinese lesbo character. I wished she got shot in the storyline. It's always nice supporting independent film makers. Takes a lot of effort to make a movie. I'm looking forward to more films by S.Viknesh. Great story!,1404259200,,265,4.782608695652174
8625289,5,B00GO55NYS,"Not sure why the reviews are not appealing but in my opinion the movie deserves the attention. The storyline was impressive! Though I wish the ending was not going to be something I have to guess what happened. Maybe the reviewers who rated a one star probably do not understand the Singaporean lingo and cultural diversity therefore the uncertainty.

Overall great storyline - well directed - hope to see more movies being directed by S.Viknesh.",1404259200,,446,4.946666666666666
8625290,4,B00GO55NYS,"If you do some research one will find this was the first feature film from director, Viknesh Silvalingam. That being said, there are a few plot holes and continuity errors, but overall it's a solid film with a compelling story. Sadly, people forget or don't understand the stress, hard work, and lack of money that goes into and distributing low budget independent features. I am excited to see what features follow in this young directors resume.",1404172800,,447,4.894736842105263
8625291,1,B00GO55NYS,"I ordered this by accident, but decided to try watching it. It was so bad I turned it off less than halfway through.  Don't bother with this movie, the acting is bad & much of it isn't in English, but with subtitles!",1403827200,,216,4.142857142857143
8625292,1,B00GO55NYS,I disliked this so very much that I did not finish it after a period of watching it.  Cannot recommend it.,1401408000,,106,4.0476190476190474
