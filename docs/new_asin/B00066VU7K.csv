2170935,4,B00066VU7K,"Gus Kubicek is a shy and lonely cartoon artist who has just beaten Hodgkin's Disease. Gus is still on the path to recovery - ergo, still bald and overweight from the radiation therapy - when he encounters lovely journalist Emily Pear, thanks to his matchmaking romance novelist and sister, Lizzie. However, after a disastrous first meeting, Emily is not too enamoured of the self-conscious Gus, though Gus is clearly smitten with her. He calls her up and asks her out but she is too busy ""having oral surgery done"" or ""taking a cajun cooking class."" So Lizzie helps her brother to get back into shape and then assists him in formulating a zany plan to woo and win Emily. Thus, Gus's new persona - the unshaven, bike-riding Lobo of New Zealand  - is born. Emily is instantly attracted to the rugged Lobo, and things seem to be looking up for Gus. But, as Emily falls deeper in fascination with him, how long can Gus keep up the pretense?

The Boyfriend School is a funny romantic comedy, with a winning cast. I used to have the biggest crush on Jami Gertz, she of Lost Boys and Less Than Zero fame. She had that waif-like quality that added a dimension of vulnerability to her roles. As Emily Pear, she is down-to-earth and seemingly independent, yet has an inner romantic streak that yearns for happiness and love. I've always liked Steve Guttenberg. He's no great actor, but he's not the worst one, either. Given a character within his acting range, preferably the role of a slightly sardonic average Joe, Guttenberg could admirably pull his weight. In this film, he is engaging and very funny in his dual parts: good guy Gus and the exotic, slightly seedy Lobo.

The supporting cast is great, starting with Shelley Long as Gus's busybody but caring sister, Lizzie Potts. Lizzie doesn't drink coffee because she's ""naturally wound up a bit too tight."" I actually like Shelley Long in this role, finding her more palatable here than in Hello Again and Outrageous Fortune. Suffice it to say, she never had it so good as when she played Diane Chambers in Cheers. Kevin Scannell is wonderfully goofy as Mitchell, Lizzie's husband, who accompanies  his highly  unconventional cooking with overbearing opera music. The little girl Annabel (or Piglet) is a hoot, as she is constantly, intensively lectured by her mother on the consequences of putting things (screws, bugs, etc.) in her mouth.

I first saw this movie years ago, by the way, when it was titled Don't Tell Her It's Me. But, whatever its film title, this is very droll and diverting stuff.",1151193600,4,2546,4.748868778280543

2170937,4,B00066VU7K,"In the spirit of Romancing the Stone, this movie (Originally ""Don't Tell Her It's Me"") feels like a very cute romance novel turned into movie format.  Shelley Long is her regular likeable but vaguely annoying self as the romance writer & match-making sister to Steve Guttenberg, who turned out one of his most enjoyable performances.  He's an idiot but a cute idiot, though I might've wished for someone a little sexier as a compliment to the oh-so-beautiful Jami Gertz.

2170939,2,B00066VU7K,"This rather forgettable movie was based on a very hilarious book by a lovely woman named Sarah Bird.  The book is called The Boyfriend School, and if you have the time, save yourself and read it instead of watching the movie.  I've done both, and would unquestionably recommend the book instead.  The movie was originally titled Don't Tell Her It's Me, an odd choice even given the inherent plot reference.  I guess if I'd seen the movie only, I might have found it entertaining, but the book was SO wonderful, the movie was just a disappointment.",1120867200,3,547,4.666666666666667

I am a huge fan of Steve Guttenberg and I love him as the sexy motorcycle riding Lobo. In the beginning of the movie he is looking really rough, but boy does how look hot with the long blonde hair.

Maybe I'm pathetic but this and ""Sibling Rivalry"" and ""Soapdish"" and ""Delirious"" all came out at around the same time, and I think they're the most hilarious movies ever. They don't make them like this anymore. This one is my favorite of all of them. Buy it, you won't regret it.",1111881600,14,474,4.3977272727272725
2170942,4,B00066VU7K,"I loved this gentle romantic comedy. I have seen comments that Steve Guttenberg wasn't 'man enough' for the part - must have been written by a straight male reviewer as he's just right for it. There are some really amusing bits to this and it qualifies for the 'comedy' description. Shelly Long is excellent too.

However I add to others comments questioning the change of title. I have borrowed this several times from DVD outlets under its old name and had just about given up hope of finding it on DVD for myself -as I was looking under the old title. What are the distributors playing at - don't they want to sell movies?

It's ironic really that the movie is 'Dont tell her it's me'. Perhaps it should have been 'Dont tell her it's 'Dont tell her it's me': tell her its 'Boyfiend school'!

So as you seem to have tracked this item down in its hidden guise I'd jump at the chance and risk it if you haven't seen it! Even though it is a great 'chick flick' I've watched it with males who quite enjoyed it too.",1109980800,34,1012,4.315789473684211
2170943,5,B00066VU7K,"I'm glad that this film is finally on DVD.  MGM has aimed to please by making this DVD a ""flipper disc"" to make both modern viewers and those stuck in the past happy.  I would have preferred a dual layer, single sided disc, but oh well.  Side A is a nice 16X9 Widescreen transfer, Side B is the modified Full Frame version.  I think it's nice of MGM to offer both the Widescreen and Full Frame versions of this film, but in this day and age, they really only needed to provide the Widescreen version.  The picture quality is excellent, much sharper and clearer than the VHS tape that HBO and Hemdale released in the 90's.  My only question is why did they change the title from Don't Tell Her It's Me to The Boyfriend School?  The movie hasn't been altered in any other way at all.  It doesn't make any sense, especially when the song ""Don't Tell Her It's Me"" plays over the opening and ending credits.  I was extremely pleased to see that MGM decided to include the theatrical trailer on the disc also, which is a bit strange, considering that the original title appears on it.  But, no matter what they want to call it, I'm just glad that this film is finally on DVD.",1106352000,19,1169,4.321100917431193

If they had not changed the name I would have owned it sooner, the old title ""Don't Tell Her it's Me"" was better, but I'll take it however as long as I can own it. This is the best ever romanic comedy. Steven Guttenberg not man enough?? Well, all I can say to that is, I'd take him over your other hollywood stars any day! Everyone drolls over Brad Pitt and I'm thinking, have him - there is something about Steve Guttenburg that just draws me in. He is an amazing actor. He is the perfect man and he did an awesome job in this film. He is amazing in ""High Spirits"" as well. But, this film is still the best.

The plot is predictable, but it's so well done you don't mind. It's fun. Shelly Long and Kevin Scannell are hilarious as Steve Guttenberg's sister and brother-in-law. You really feel for Steve's character Gus as he assumes a new identity to win the heart of Emily Pear (Jamie Gertz). Kyle MacLachlan plays the smarmy character (as usual) of Trout.

Because the ""bad boy"" premise hits so close to home is why this movie is so funny.  Lines like, ""I left the handsome rogue fantasy behind in high school"" and my favorite, ""I am Lobo, I hunt alone, I need no one"" are just to funny.  Movie starts off a little slow, but once Gus shows up as Lobo at the gas station I usually can't stop laughing after that.  Just a fun movie!",1377734400,2,525,4.117647058823529

2170960,4,B00066VU7K,"Yes, yes, I know it is confusing with the title changes that have occurred here. Originally titled ""The Boyfriend School"" after the novel, the title was changed to ""Don't Tell Her It's Me"" when it was released in theaters but then changed back to its original title when released on dvd. However, the VHS tapes still use the ""Don't Tell..."" title. I have no clue why the titles were switched around so much. A similar thing happened to another movie that was ironically also filmed in Charleston and that was the 1988 Justine Bateman movie ""Satisfaction"" which is sometimes for some reason referred to as ""Sweet Little Rock & Roller."" Anyway, this is a cute movie whatever the title. I only bought it b/c I collect movies that are filmed here in Charleston since I live here. I like to see how the city and surrounding areas have changed since the times the movies were filmed here. I think the reason this movie is so expensive is b/c it is a lesser-known film so it hasn't exactly been mass-produced and since that means there are fewer copies out there, they have to charge more to make it worth it (make a profit from releasing it on dvd.) It is certainly not worth the $40+ I forked out for it but as I said, I collect movies filmed in my city so wanted to have it for my collection. I had bought the VHS tape that was sold on Amazon but it was not in the best condition since tape gets old and strained to the point that it doesn't play well.

2170990,5,B00066VU7K,"If you haven't read Sarah Bird's classic romance THE BOYFRIEND SCHOOL, you probably should. It's one of my favorite contemporary romances of all-time. Originally published in 1989, the book is about Gretchen Griner, an underpaid photographer sent to cover a ""Romantic Times-like"" conference in Austin, complete with cover models and authors dressed in full Southern belle regalia. There she meets bestselling romance author Lizzie Potts (known as Viveca Lamoureaux to her adoring readers) and romantic chaos ensues as the well-meaning Lizzie decides to fix the cynical Gretchen up with her brother Gus by making him over as the ultimate romance hero.

One of my readers recently let me know the movie version of THE BOYFRIEND SCHOOL (originally titled DON'T TELL HER IT'S ME) had just been released on DVD. While not quite as good as the book, it really is pretty adorable. And it will make you say four words you never thought you would-- ""Steve Guttenberg is HOT!""

When Gretchen (renamed Emily for the movie) first meets Gus, he is recovering from cancer treatments and is boring, bald and bloated. But the quirky Lizzie (played by Shelley Long before anyone realized she wasn't going to be a big movie star) quickly makes him over into ""Lobo,"" a mysterious Harley-straddling hero with a stubbled jaw and a really fine mullet. If you enjoy a romantic comedy that's romantic, funny and touching. I think you'll love this one! (And did I mention that Steve Guttenberg was really HOT?)
