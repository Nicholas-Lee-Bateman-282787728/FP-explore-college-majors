7874312,4,6304558279,"The first episode is one of my favorites. It's where you see Sasami meet a new friend named Mirai. She turns out to be a ghost who is just lonely. Every one else is looking for her, while Mirai takes Sasami and Ryo-oh-ki to all sorts of fun places. But then Sasami has to leave, because everyone is worried about her. It ends with  you seeing a picture of Mirai, and then butterflys go over it and you see Sasami and Ryo-oh-ki in it. The second episode isn't as good, in my opinion. Yugami is stolen by two teenage punks, who end up getting caught by Jurai royal forces, who thinks they're Tenchi and company. ^_~ good for them! I rated it four because I love the first episode. It's one of the episodes that you can clearly see how important friends are to Sasami, who, next to Ryoko, is my favorite character!!",975110400,3,812,4.30718954248366
7874313,4,6304558279,"This volume has a mixture of emotion and the usual comedic flare.  There  is a ghost in one episode that Sasamie becomes friends with and learns a  few new things.  While in the other episodes you have some of the usual  crazy adventures like a food shortage and requiring Ryoko to get more  supplies with their money (heh heh).  Then an episode where the Yagami is  stolen by a couple of punks who end up face to face with the Juria military  fleet.  Its good but it doesn't really add much to the storyline but kinda  gives a break from it temporarily.  Kinda of like the Time & Space  series, a quick offshoot.  I think if if you liked the earlier volumes of  Tenchi Universe then you'll like this one too.",965260800,,709,4.305343511450381
