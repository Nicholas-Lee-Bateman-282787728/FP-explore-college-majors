7731831,2,B01E7N9SSK,"Your small children might enjoy this frantic mix of Megamind, Despicable Me and Robots, but adults might want to leave the room while they watch it.  There are basically two men in Bling who are hopelessly in love and have the same idea--one is good-guy with low self-esteem Sam (Taylor Kitsch) who wants to propose to childhood sweetheart Sue, who is rich, successful and a celebrity reporter.  He thinks he needs a huge ring to propose to his beloved and spends a fortune (for him) on a ring he can't afford on his salary as a lowly mechanic at a theme park.  But rather than simply popping the question after he gets the ring Sam comes up with an elaborate plan that is supposed to make the moment spectacular but ends up backfiring horribly.

The other lovelorn male is supervillain Victor (James Woods) who is madly in love with Catherine, the mayor, and also Sue's mom.  Strangely, Victor is apparently the same age as Sam, suggesting a rather large age difference between Victor and Catherine that the movie never acknowledges.  Victor steals a much more valuable ring from the same jewelry store where Sam bought his, also planning to blackmail Catherine into marrying him--he will give up being a supervillain if Catherine says yes to being his wife but destroy the city if refuses.

The rings get mixed up, making Sam flub his second attempt at a marriage proposal to Sue and causing Victor's evil plot to go equally awry.

I'm honestly making this sound much better than it is.  Victor and Sam are such paper thin characters that it's impossible to care about either of them.  Victor is also never sufficiently developed to function as an actual villain--he comes across as harmless and silly, which might be fine if you are a five-year-old but more mature viewers would likely prefer someone at least a little threatening as the baddie.  It feels like nothing whatsoever is at stake in Bling because you don't care if Sam gets the girl and Victor's threats against the city seem completely empty.

Bling is actually a pretty cheap looking Korean computer animated feature dubbed with an American voice cast.  Did it work better in Korean?  Maybe.  The English language dialogue is uninspired, to put it mildly, and the obsession with diamond rings as the centerpiece of a children's film seems more than a little bit off.  Maybe Koreans are even more consumerist than we are and five-year-old girls dream of getting huge rings when they grow up, but it's hard to imagine Pixar or Disney or even Dreamworks greenlighting something with a premise like this.  Yes, the message is that the ring doesn't matter, love does, but that doesn't change the fact that this is a children's cartoon about two men who really want to get married.  Maybe Bling was aimed at adults as well as children, but better jokes, less obvious plotting and much stronger character development would be necessary to engage anyone who isn't very small and extremely easy to please.

Small children will likely be satisfied enough by the bright colors, constant movement, and robot fart jokes to sit through this once without complaint, but I wouldn't waste money buying it because Bling isn't likely to become anyone's childhood favorite.  The movie is just too shallow and disposable to function as anything other than an 82-minute distraction.",1463875200,,3327,4.84452296819788
