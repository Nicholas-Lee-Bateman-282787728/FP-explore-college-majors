6072980,5,B00GDEZNTK,"First of all just to confirm what the other reviewer wrote, all the films are presented in 1.37: 1 ratio apart from Playtime which is 1.78.1.
The reason I know this is that those of you who live in a region B area for blu-ray will not have to wait for the no-doubt splendid Criterion edition to arrive later this year (and as Criterion only issue discs as region A you cannot play them anyway!) as StudioCanal in Britain have just released this box set under the title of The Essential Jacques Tati - again 7 discs containing all the films plus a disc of shorts and a booklet. I imagine that this box is the same more-or-less as the Criterion edition. So region B users can give a cheer and go now to the Amazon Uk site and order your copy - the price is reasonable. Once I have sat down and gone thru the films, documentaries etc I will post a review on the UK site, although this may take sometime. Note that these disc will NOT play on region A machines (eg USA) so those of you affected will have to wait for the Criterion edition - sorry!",1405987200,12,1043,4.1940298507462686
6072981,5,B00GDEZNTK,"This is not so much a reveiw as a correction: Amazon lists aspect ratio as 2:35:1. This is impossible - Tati shot everything

6072990,5,B00GDEZNTK,"In adding my enthusiastic 5 stars to previous reviews, there's really little left to say about the quiet genius of Jacques Tati. So let me address some of the less than glowing reviews -- not to dismiss or condemn them, but to point out that ""comedy"" may mean different things, and that the word might have misled some into thinking these films are typical laugh-fests. For those expecting the usual sort of comedy I can see why Tati might be a disappointment. While he's working in classic silent slapstick tradition, he brings more to his films in the way of social commentary, bemusement, and philosophical critique -- not unlike a master such as Chaplin.

It helps to look at Tati's films as one ongoing work, as he examines the effects of change & modernity on human beings & culture. ""Progress"" is very much a dubious thing in Tati's worldview, displacing the uniquely human for a thoroughly homogenized world of inhuman efficiency that's increasingly inefficient. So while there are plenty of sight gags that certainly make me laugh at loud, my real response is a somewhat melancholy smile that's both amusement & rueful resignation, as M. Hulot becomes more & more swallowed up & lost in each subsequent film. Yet he somehow survives, and even finds his own small, personal triumph in his final appearance in ""Trafic"".

Time has shown that Tati was quite prescient. I can only imagine what he would have made of the current digital world, and I smile all the more to think of M. Hulot struggling to cope with Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, phone menus, ATMs, etc. -- to say nothing of the perpetually adolescent fratboy ""humor"" that dominates alleged comedies today. His modestly humane outlook is desperately needed in these times, which is one of the things making his films so timely as well as timeless. His real theme is nothing less than the survival of the human being in an automated & soulless world of our own making. And as long as civilized human beings exist, there'll be a deserved place of honor for Tati & his work.

Most highly recommended!",1469491200,11,2064,4.792134831460674
6072991,5,B00GDEZNTK,"Like any other film auteur, you'll either love, enjoy, or hate Jacques Tati. Those with short attention spans should move on. If nothing else, Tati, the grandson of Vincent Van Gogh's picture framer (!), is one-of-a-kind, there's no filmmaker like him. You have to admire his precision and timing, honed during his years as a successful mime, his observational gifts are second to none. Those unfamiliar with his work, should rent ""Mon Oncle"" and ""PlayTime"" first, if you like them, you'll like this set. If you're a Tati fan, this set is manna from film heaven (hangin' out with Jacques, Roger?)! Here's what you really get, some of Amazon's info is wrong (the short synopsis are courtesy of Criterion)......

DISC ONE:
""Jour de Fte"" (""The Big Day"") (1949) In his enchanting debut feature, Jacques Tati stars as a fussbudget of a postman who is thrown for a loop when a traveling fair comes to his village. Even in this early work, Tati was brilliantly toying with the devices (silent visual gags, minimal yet deftly deployed sound effects) and exploring the theme (the absurdity of our increasing reliance on technology) that would define his cinema. (Run time: 86 minutes, Black & White/Hand-colored/Color), Aspect ratio: 1.37:1, Language: French with English Subtitles)

Disc Features:
-New 2K digital restoration, with uncompressed monaural soundtrack on the Blu-ray
-Two alternate versions of the film: director Jacques Tati's 1964 reedit, featuring hand-colored objects and newly incorporated footage, and the full-color 1995 rerelease, completed from Tati's original color negatives
-""A' l'ame'ricaine,"" a 2013 visual essay by Tati expert Ste'phane Goudet tracking the evolution of Tati's comedy
-""Jour de Fe'te"": In Search of the Lost Color,"" a 1988 documentary on the restoration of the film to Tati's original color vision
-Trailer
-New English subtitle translation

DISC TWO:
""Monsieur Hulot's Holiday"" (1953) Monsieur Hulot, Jacques Tati's endearing clown, takes a holiday at a seaside resort, where his presence provokes one catastrophe after another. Tati's masterpiece of gentle slapstick is a series of effortlessly well-choreographed sight gags involving dogs, boats, and firecrackers; it was the first entry in the Hulot series and the film that launched its maker to international stardom. (87 minutes, Black & White, 1.37:1, French with English Subtitles)

Disc Features:
-New 2K digital restoration of director Jacques Tati's 1978 re-release version, with uncompressed monaural soundtrack on the Blu-ray
-Original 1953 version of the film
-Introduction by actor and comedian Terry Jones
-""Clear Skies, Light Breeze,"" a 2013 visual essay by Tati expert Ste'phane Goudet about the debut of Monsieur Hulot

-New interview with film composer and critic Michel Chion on Tati's use of sound design
-Optional English-language soundtrack for the re-release version
-New English subtitle translation

DISC THREE:
""Mon Oncle"" (""My Uncle"") (1958) Slapstick prevails again when Jacques Tati's eccentric, old- fashioned hero, Monsieur Hulot, is set loose in Villa Arpel, the geometric, oppressively ultramodern home of his brother-in-law, and in the antiseptic plastic hose factory where he gets a job. The second Hulot movie and Tati's first color film, ""Mon Oncle"" is a supremely amusing satire of mechanized living and consumer society that earned the director the Academy Award for best foreign-language film. (116 minutes, Color, 1.33:1, French with English Subtitles)

Disc Features:
-New 2K digital restoration, with uncompressed monaural soundtrack on the Blu-ray
-Introduction by actor and comedian Terry Jones
-""My Uncle"" director Jacques Tati's 1958 reedited, English-language version of the film
-""Once Upon a Time . . . 'Mon Oncle,'"" an hour-long documentary from 2008 on the making of the film

-""Le Hasard de Jacques Tati,"" a 1977 French television episode featuring an interview with Tati about his dog, Hasard, and the canine stars of ""Mon Oncle""
-New English subtitle translation

DISC FOUR:
""PlayTime"" (1967) Jacques Tati's gloriously choreographed, nearly wordless comedies about confusion in an age of high technology reached their apotheosis with ""PlayTime."" For this monumental achievement, a nearly three-year-long, bank-breaking production, Tati again thrust the lovably old-fashioned Monsieur Hulot, along with a host of other lost souls, into a baffling modern world, this time Paris. With every inch of its super wide frame crammed with hilarity and inventiveness, ""PlayTime"" is a lasting record of a modern era tiptoeing on the edge of oblivion. (124 minutes, Color, 1.78:1, English, German & French with English Subtitles)

Disc Features:
-New 4K digital restoration, with 3.0 surround DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack on the Blu-ray
-Introduction by actor and comedian Terry Jones

-Interview from 2006 with script supervisor Sylvette Baudrot
-Audio interview with Tati from the U.S. debut of PlayTime at the 1972 San Francisco Film Festival
-Alternate English-language soundtrack
-New English subtitle translation

DISC FIVE:
""Trafic"" (1971) In Jacques Tati's Trafic, the bumbling Monsieur Hulot, kitted out as always with tan raincoat, beaten brown hat, and umbrella, takes to Paris's highways and byways. In this, his final outing, Hulot is employed as an auto company's director of design, and accompanies his new product (a ""camping car"" outfitted with absurd gadgetry) to an auto show in Amsterdam. Naturally, the road there is paved with modern-age mishaps. This late-career delight is a masterful demonstration of the comic genius's expert timing and sidesplitting knack for visual gags, and a bemused last look at technology run amok. (97 minutes, Color, 1.37:1 French with English Subtitles)

Disc Features:
-New 2K digital restoration, with uncompressed monaural soundtrack on the Blu-ray
-""Jacques Tati in Monsieur Hulot's Work,"" a 1976 episode of the British television program Omnibus featuring an interview with Tati about his Hulot films
-Trailer
-New English subtitle translation

DISC SIX:
""Parade"" (1974) For his final film, Jacques Tati takes his camera to the circus, where the director himself serves as master of ceremonies. Though it features many spectacles, including clowns, jugglers, acrobats, contortionists, and more, ""Parade"" also focuses on the spectators, making this stripped-down work a testament to the communion between audience and entertainment. Created for Swedish television (with Ingmar Bergman's legendary director of photography Gunnar Fischer serving as one of its cinematographers), ""Parade"" is a touching career send-off that recalls its maker's origins as a mime and theater performer. (89 minutes, Color, 1.37:1, French with English Subtitles)

Disc Features:
-New 2K digital restoration, with uncompressed monaural soundtrack on the Blu-ray
-""In the Footsteps of Monsieur Hulot,"" a two-part documentary from 1989 by director Jacques Tati's daughter Sophie Tatischeff

-New English subtitle translation

My advice is to watch the documentary ""In the Footsteps of Monsieur Hulot"" on Disc Six first, it functions like a 105-min. trailer or primer for the contents of the set.  There are clips from the shorts, the films and even many of the special features included in the set, but none give away too much plot or really spoil anything. It also has some great rare material, like Tati as a guest on the Steve Allen Show! In interviews Jacques comes off as a gentle populist, a really nice guy that you'd like to know. After watching it you're definitely psyched to watch the films......

Each disc has it's own cardboard jacket and in a plastic tray. All seven discs and the 64-page booklet featuring essays by James Quandt, Jonathan Rosenbaum, Kristin Ross, and David Cairns are in a fairly sturdy cardboard slipcase. The only film that looks ""rough"" is the first short, ""On Demande Une Brute,"" everything else is fantastic, even the other earlier shorts. I will update the review if necessary as I go through it's mammoth contents! Hope this helps......",1459987200,,9963,5.55270092226614
6072992,2,B00GDEZNTK,"This collection is an excellent technical presentation. Having seen ""Mon Uncle"" many years ago, I highly expected to really appreciate this collection. The films themselves are impeccably staged, framed, filmed, architected, and produced. However, much to my surprise, having watched the first four films in this series, I doubt that I will watch the rest. The films actually made me crack a weak smile on a few occasions,  so if you think that accidentally shifting one picture frame on a wall by 15 degrees while straightening another by the same amount is funny, of if you like doorways that make funny sounds, or if you prefer your entertainment to be ""charming,"" then these films are for you. (Jerry Lewis productions run roughshod over these for being funny and memorable.) These films remind me of children's picture books. The last film that I watched was ""Play Time"" which is the most elaborate light entertainment I have ever seen. It seemed like two films awkwardly stuck together. The first carries on Tati's frequent theme of bemusement of modernity, and the second is a long slapstick sequence of nightclub chaos.  I am sure that a film student would ruminate on the complex staging and choreography, particularly in the second half. I, however, felt as though I had wasted two hours, and have wasted time overall with this collection.",1458950400,5,1349,4.9911111111111115

6073001,5,B00GDEZNTK,"The DVD's are very clear and the sound is excellent. Included are reviews and critiques by knowledgeable individuals which provide information about either Tati himself or his problems in the filming. Also included are a number of short films he created very early in his career. From these early films until the last one provides an overview of his growth as an artist and as a very gentle social critic. I am so glad I purchased this collection. No matter how many times I view a film, there is always something I had not noticed before. An additional value for viewers today are the films of the old section of Paris where Hulot presumably lived in ""Mon Oncle"" since that area no longer exists. It is quite charming.",1441843200,3,719,4.625
6073002,4,B00GDEZNTK,"It would be a full five stars if it were not for the crappy ""recycled"" paper they made the case out of.  The separate blue-ray containers (and I use the term ""container"" loosely here -- more like a flap over each disc) were packed so snug into the container for the set that I actually damaged the box trying to extract one.

They certainly must have put all their money into restoration because it is obvious they ran out of money when it came time to actually ship their product.",1440028800,2,481,4.333333333333333
6073003,5,B00GDEZNTK,"This is an absolutely stunning collection of films. Jaques Tati as a performer and filmmaker is in the same class as Chaplin and Keaton. His film persona of Mr. Hulot, although distinctly French, is as universal as any film character has ever been. There is great joy in watching a Tati film and this boxed set with the absolutely fantastic collection of Criterion disks amplifies the pleasure to an extraordinary degree.

Tati's films are intricately designed and performed, actually choreographed. Each film is also layered with meaning and truth both simple and sublime. This is the work of a master of cinema like Einstein's was the work of a scientist. Each film is heavily supported by additional material on the film itself and Tati in general. The curators of this collection found some extraordinary background material for example, the film ""Mon Oncle"" has a very short interview with Tati on his dog and how he worked with the dogs who were a huge part of the film. What an unbelievable treasure of information on this important aspect of the film.

There are not many things I have owned which I feel were a steal at the price I paid but for a lover of cinema, like myself, this amazing collection is definitely one of them. The films of Jaques Tati fill me with great joy and having them all, beautifully presented, in one collection makes them one of the greatest things I own",1439078400,11,1390,4.716049382716049

6073005,5,B00GDEZNTK,"For me, the best two blu-ray discs I own are the two Criterion releases of Playtime.  With each new restoration of this film,  we seem to get more and more clarity, depth, and color.  As far as preference goes,  we are all greatly influenced by how the previous blu-ray looked in 2009.  It was the original for most of us.  I had seen Playtime multiple times on DVD, but no viewing experience has impressed me more than the first time I saw it on blu-ray.  I am not surprised by Roger Eberts comments concerning Playtime:

And if you ever get a chance to see the film in 70mm, take it no matter the amount of time or money involvedI have seen it in that format three times in my life and count them as among my most treasured moviegoing experiences.

I have studied the online images for the 2014 remaster.  In a few scenes, colors are not quite what I would expect to see.  However, as good as the 2009 blu-ray looks, it also seems a little too washed-out to me personally.  I agree that the newer version has better flesh tones and more color overall, but consider this excerpt  from dvdverdict.com:

Colors are a bit muted, especially compared to previous releases, but they feel more nuanced and equally saturated. Black levels are deep and clean throughout. Overall, this is a marvelous transfer of a cinematic treasure.

To me, the new 4k restoration is significantly better than the 2009 transfer.  For great film reviews from a man who actually worked with Jacques Tati, I would recommend googling Jonathan Rosenbaum (of the Chicago Reader).",1437004800,2,1549,4.619047619047619

Tati's slow, methodical creative process meant that this is a relatively small set of movies, but every one of them is a gem. Some days, Playtime is my favorite movie ever. Other days it is Mon Oncle, or Mr. Hulot's Holiday. But all of these are delights. Watch them and listen to them; Tati's use of sound is brilliant, too.

The following are not HD:
""Jour de Fete"" (color version) - This transfer is awful. It looks like worn VHS, where the color has only a tenuous relationship to the picture. I've seen this version in 35mm; it doesn't look very good, but nowhere near as bad as this video suggests.
""Jour de Fete"" (1964 version)
""Monsieur Hulot's Holiday"" (original 1953 version)
""My Uncle""

Additionally, ""Play Time"" is newly altered. In 70mm and the previous Criterion disc, the music that starts and ends the picture plays to a blank screen. This edition removes that unique and memorable aspect by inserting a new logo during the opening music, and laying new end credits over the exit music. The previous disc is a more accurate representation of the film, even with its increased grain (it looks fantastic in 70mm, but it's not grainless), and is what you'd see if you saw it in 35mm/70mm. If I'm going to pop in ""Play Time"" in the future, it'll probably be the older disc.

The new transfers for the color films seem off. This is readily apparent between ""Mon Oncle"", which looks brown and drab, and ""My Uncle"", which looks how I remember it did when I saw it in 35mm- bright and vibrant. Judging by the screenshots on the DVDBeaver website, all the color films now look tinged brown, with a reduced color palette. Some of them veer to teal-and-orange.

Lastly, this set suffers from logo overkill. Before every movie, there's the Criterion logo, the StudioCanal logo, the ""les Films de Mon Oncle"" logo, at minimum. They're long, noisy, and completely unnecessary.",1421366400,9,1765,4.815181518151816

6073025,5,B00GDEZNTK,At least 5 stars for this collection.  I have been a fan of Tati since the 50s'.  I am very surprised at how few people seem to know who he is.  I have just finished the entire set and read ALL the accompanying literature on Tati and find no one anywhere who has observed at how he incorporates small children and dogs into most of his work.  What a treat to rewatch this completely charmed and charming person perform.,1420934400,2,419,4.265822784810126
6073026,5,B00GDEZNTK,"Jacques Tati should need no introduction these days: he's one of France's--and the world's--great observers and commenters on humanity. If you're reading this review, you probably already know that; if Tati is new to you, try out one of his more accessible films like ""Hulot's Holiday"" or ""Mon Oncle."" My personal favorite is ""Playtime,"" his magnum opus that nearly destroyed him when he created it over several years leading to it's disastrous release. The reason you're likely reading this now is confirmation of the effectiveness of the BluRay transfer and I can confirm it's stunning, especially in the visual feast that is ""Playtime."" I have an HD projector and have watched the entire set on a big screen home theatre set-up and it's fantastic. Supplemental materials are interesting but largely duplicate those on Criterion's previous early 2000s release. The early shorts are great to have with this, as are the last two films he completed, which are not considered very successful by many folks, but which I really love. A great set and since you can't get this via streaming (not in the BluRay transfer anyway), well worth acquiring if you love Tati.",1420848000,4,1160,5.015544041450777

6073037,5,B00GDEZNTK,"Like any other film auteur, you'll either love, enjoy, or hate Jacques Tati. Those with short attention spans should move on. If nothing else, Tati, the grandson of Vincent Van Gogh's picture framer (!), is one-of-a-kind, there's no filmmaker like him. You have to admire his precision and timing, honed during his years as a successful mime, his observational gifts are second to none. Those unfamiliar with his work, should rent ""Mon Oncle"" and ""PlayTime"" first, if you like them, you'll like this set. If you're a Tati fan, this set is manna from film heaven (hangin' out with Jacques, Roger?)! Here's what you really get, some of Amazon's info is wrong (the short synopsis are courtesy of Criterion)......

DISC ONE:
""Jour de Fte"" (""The Big Day"") (1949) In his enchanting debut feature, Jacques Tati stars as a fussbudget of a postman who is thrown for a loop when a traveling fair comes to his village. Even in this early work, Tati was brilliantly toying with the devices (silent visual gags, minimal yet deftly deployed sound effects) and exploring the theme (the absurdity of our increasing reliance on technology) that would define his cinema. (Run time: 86 minutes, Black & White/Hand-colored/Color), Aspect ratio: 1.37:1, Language: French with English Subtitles)

Disc Features:
-New 2K digital restoration, with uncompressed monaural soundtrack on the Blu-ray
-Two alternate versions of the film: director Jacques Tati's 1964 reedit, featuring hand-colored objects and newly incorporated footage, and the full-color 1995 rerelease, completed from Tati's original color negatives
-""A l'americaine,"" a 2013 visual essay by Tati expert Stephane Goudet tracking the evolution of Tati's comedy
-""Jour de Fete"": In Search of the Lost Color,"" a 1988 documentary on the restoration of the film to Tati's original color vision
-Trailer
-New English subtitle translation

DISC TWO:
""Monsieur Hulot's Holiday"" (1953) Monsieur Hulot, Jacques Tati's endearing clown, takes a holiday at a seaside resort, where his presence provokes one catastrophe after another. Tati's masterpiece of gentle slapstick is a series of effortlessly well-choreographed sight gags involving dogs, boats, and firecrackers; it was the first entry in the Hulot series and the film that launched its maker to international stardom. (87 minutes, Black & White, 1.37:1, French with English Subtitles)

Disc Features:
-New 2K digital restoration of director Jacques Tati's 1978 re-release version, with uncompressed monaural soundtrack on the Blu-ray

-Introduction by actor and comedian Terry Jones

-New interview with film composer and critic Michel Chion on Tati's use of sound design
-Optional English-language soundtrack for the re-release version
-New English subtitle translation

DISC THREE:
""Mon Oncle"" (""My Uncle"") (1958) Slapstick prevails again when Jacques Tati's eccentric, old- fashioned hero, Monsieur Hulot, is set loose in Villa Arpel, the geometric, oppressively ultramodern home of his brother-in-law, and in the antiseptic plastic hose factory where he gets a job. The second Hulot movie and Tati's first color film, ""Mon Oncle"" is a supremely amusing satire of mechanized living and consumer society that earned the director the Academy Award for best foreign-language film. (116 minutes, Color, 1.33:1, French with English Subtitles)

Disc Features:
-New 2K digital restoration, with uncompressed monaural soundtrack on the Blu-ray
-Introduction by actor and comedian Terry Jones
-""My Uncle"" director Jacques Tati's 1958 reedited, English-language version of the film
-""Once Upon a Time . . . 'Mon Oncle,'"" an hour-long documentary from 2008 on the making of the film

-""Everything's Connected,"" a 2013 visual essay by Tati expert Stephane Goudet comparing Mon oncle to the other Monsieur Hulot films
-""Le Hasard de Jacques Tati,"" a 1977 French television episode featuring an interview with Tati about his dog, Hasard, and the canine stars of ""Mon Oncle""
-New English subtitle translation

DISC FOUR:
""PlayTime"" (1967) Jacques Tati's gloriously choreographed, nearly wordless comedies about confusion in an age of high technology reached their apotheosis with ""PlayTime."" For this monumental achievement, a nearly three-year-long, bank-breaking production, Tati again thrust the lovably old-fashioned Monsieur Hulot, along with a host of other lost souls, into a baffling modern world, this time Paris. With every inch of its super wide frame crammed with hilarity and inventiveness, ""PlayTime"" is a lasting record of a modern era tiptoeing on the edge of oblivion. (124 minutes, Color, 1.78:1, English, German & French with English Subtitles)

Disc Features:
-New 4K digital restoration, with 3.0 surround DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack on the Blu-ray
-Introduction by actor and comedian Terry Jones
-Three selected-scene commentaries, by film historian Philip Kemp, theater director Jerome Deschamps, and Jacques Tati expert Stephane Goudet

-Interview from 2006 with script supervisor Sylvette Baudrot
-Audio interview with Tati from the U.S. debut of PlayTime at the 1972 San Francisco Film Festival
-Alternate English-language soundtrack
-New English subtitle translation

DISC FIVE:
""Trafic"" (1971) In Jacques Tati's Trafic, the bumbling Monsieur Hulot, kitted out as always with tan raincoat, beaten brown hat, and umbrella, takes to Paris's highways and byways. In this, his final outing, Hulot is employed as an auto company's director of design, and accompanies his new product (a ""camping car"" outfitted with absurd gadgetry) to an auto show in Amsterdam. Naturally, the road there is paved with modern-age mishaps. This late-career delight is a masterful demonstration of the comic genius's expert timing and sidesplitting knack for visual gags, and a bemused last look at technology run amok. (97 minutes, Color, 1.37:1 French with English Subtitles)

Disc Features:
-New 2K digital restoration, with uncompressed monaural soundtrack on the Blu-ray
-""Jacques Tati in Monsieur Hulot's Work,"" a 1976 episode of the British television program Omnibus featuring an interview with Tati about his Hulot films
-Trailer
-New English subtitle translation

DISC SIX:
""Parade"" (1974) For his final film, Jacques Tati takes his camera to the circus, where the director himself serves as master of ceremonies. Though it features many spectacles, including clowns, jugglers, acrobats, contortionists, and more, ""Parade"" also focuses on the spectators, making this stripped-down work a testament to the communion between audience and entertainment. Created for Swedish television (with Ingmar Bergman's legendary director of photography Gunnar Fischer serving as one of its cinematographers), ""Parade"" is a touching career send-off that recalls its maker's origins as a mime and theater performer. (89 minutes, Color, 1.37:1, French with English Subtitles)

Disc Features:
-New 2K digital restoration, with uncompressed monaural soundtrack on the Blu-ray
-""In the Footsteps of Monsieur Hulot,"" a two-part documentary from 1989 by director Jacques Tati's daughter Sophie Tatischeff

-""An Homage to Jacques Tati,"" a 1982 episode of the French television program Magazine featuring a tribute to Tati by his friend and set designer Jacques LaGrange
-New English subtitle translation

-New English subtitle translations

My advice is to watch the documentary ""In the Footsteps of Monsieur Hulot"" on Disc Six first, it functions like a 105-min. trailer or primer for the contents of the set.  There are clips from the shorts, the films and even many of the special features included in the set, but none give away too much plot or really spoil anything. It also has some great rare material, like Tati as a guest on the Steve Allen Show! In interviews Jacques comes off as a gentle populist, a really nice guy that you'd like to know. After watching it you're definitely psyched to watch the films......

Each disc has it's own cardboard jacket and in a plastic tray. All seven discs and the 64-page booklet featuring essays by James Quandt, Jonathan Rosenbaum, Kristin Ross, and David Cairns are in a fairly sturdy cardboard slipcase. The only film that looks ""rough"" is the first short, ""On Demande Une Brute,"" everything else is fantastic, even the other earlier shorts. I will update the review if necessary as I go through it's mammoth contents! Hope this helps......",1417996800,45,9952,5.545454545454546

6073044,4,B00GDEZNTK,"This is not really a review, but as I found the product description lacking some key information about the films, I decided to provide here some important information on the films. I hope this information is useful to you.

JOUR DE FETE (1949) - 70 minutes - Director: Jacques Tati - Starring:  Jacques Tati, Guy Decomble - Genre: Comedy - Plot: When the faor comes to town and shows a movie of the efficient American postmen, the bumbling, ineffectual postman Francois sets off on a series of mishaps and misfortunes to do his job as good as they do.

LE VACANCES DE MR. HUBLOT (1953) - 83 minutes - Director: Jacques Tati - Starring: Jacques Tati, Nathalie Pascaud - Genre: Comedy - Plot: Monsieur Hulot comes to a beachside hotel for a vacation, where he accidentally (but good-naturedly) causes havoc.

MON ONCLE (1959) - 117 minutes - Director: Jacques Tati - Starring: Jacques Tati, Jean-Pierre Zola - Genre: Comedy - Plot: Monsieur Hulot visits the technology-driven world of his sister, brother-in-law, and nephew, but he can't quite fit into the surroundings.

PLAYTIME (1967) - 115 minutes - Director: Jacques Tati - Starring: Jacques Tati, Barbara Dennek - Genre: Comedy - Plot: Caught in the tourist invasion, Hulot roams around Paris with a group of American tourists, causing chaos in his usual manner.

TRAFIC (1971) - 96 minutes - Director: Jacques Tati - Starring: Jacques Tati, Marcel Fraval - Genre: Comedy - Plot: Mr. Hulot drives a recreational vehicle from Paris to Amsterdam in his usual comic, disasterous style.

PARADE (TV Movie 1974) - 84 minutes - Director: Jacques Tati - Starring: Jacques Tati, Karl Kossmayer- Genre: Comedy - Plot: Two children go behind the scenes of a small circus.

ON DEMANDE UNE BRUTE (1934) - 23 minutes - Director: Charles Barrois - Starring: Jean Clairval, Jacques Tati - Genre: Comedy

GAI DIMANCHE (1935) - 33 minutes - Director: Jacques Berr, Jacques Tati - Starring: Rhum, Jacques Tati - Genre: Comedy

SOIGNE TON GAUCHE (1936) - 13 minutes - Director: Ren&eacute; Cl&eacute;ment - Starring: Jacques Tati, Max Martel - Genre: Comedy - Plot: A young farmhand who daydreams of boxing volunteers to face a professional boxer, even though he knows nothing about boxing.

Note: for many of these obscure but delightful films, it was hard to track down information. I have done it the best I could. I hope you will forgive the absences of several of Tati's more rare short films. Now it's time to crunch some numbers. This box set costs $119.99 and contains 6 feature length films, and 7 short films. When we divide to find the cost of the individual film, we find that each film costs roughly $19.99 (short films not counted). When you factor in the short films and the numerous special and bonus features, I think this is an excellent value to own these delightful and hilarious films from a master of comedy.
