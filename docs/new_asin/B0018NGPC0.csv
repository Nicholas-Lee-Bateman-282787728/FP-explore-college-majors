8270175,5,B0018NGPC0,"In my opinion, this is one of the best DVDs for beginners in horseback riding.  After several attempts to find the right DVD for my children, we finally found one that was very helpful.  I highly recommend a DVD like this in combination with taking formal/informal riding lessons.  Much of the DVD is in English.  Where English is not used, subtitles are provided.",1308873600,3,364,4.73015873015873
8270176,5,B0018NGPC0,"If you love horses thise is anawesome little dvd, great footage of all the disiplines and lots of cute kids on cute ponies, I can watch it over and over.

Any child getting ready to take lessons would benifit from this dvd, though some is in subtitiles so they have to be old enough to read.

Fun to watch.",1297728000,2,306,4.169491525423729
