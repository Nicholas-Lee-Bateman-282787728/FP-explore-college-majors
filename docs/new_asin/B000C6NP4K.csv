2453569,5,B000C6NP4K,"I purchased the Esteban Beginner Course and Cord package from Amazon.com I read everything, watched the DVDs and listened to the Cd.
Not once was there a marketing spill to sell you anything. Esteban LOVES music and you can tell in the manner in which he talks and teaches. You won't find a better more knowledgable guitar teacher anywhere. I play several string instruments and have expirence with different styles of teaching. I purchased the Esteban guitar from a friend so I didn't get to pick out the exterior graphic design I normally would have chosen. The guitar is infact made of wood and is compatible to any $500-$600 guitar you would find in any music store. The guitar is mass produced in China, as is most producs the US imports, includeing many of those $500-$600 guitars found in music stores. There is nothing cheap about the Esteban Guitar. It is very well made with metal insets in the frets...not decals like one fellow claimes in another review. A professional probably would not be interested in this guitar as the better one becomes at one's craft the better tools that professional would like to aquire. A real professional could make this guitar sing, just like Esteban. In the instructional videos, Esteban used one of the guitars he sells, so you get to hear what the instrument really is capible of sounding like. If you look closely at the close up shots of his hands you can see the Esteban logo sticker inside the guitar. As I said before, he isn't selling anything in any of the instructional DVDs...he is teaching you the craft he loves. You can see it in his teaching style. He did what all professional guitarists would like to do...he made it big in his field and sells a lot of guitars. That's not all. Look at all the CDc he has out on Amazon.com. Now compare that number with those who are his critics.
One improvement Estenan could make is to have a 2nd camera and a split screen  so you can see the left and right hand  close up shots at the same time.

This is the stright skinny guys. I hope it helps you in your purchase decision.",1329436800,6,2074,4.540106951871658
2453570,1,B000C6NP4K,"I expected a package that teaches how to play guitar. However, they put all their focus on marketing the guitar itself than teaching. It is very difficult to see the hand movement and there are times that hand movement are not shown at all.",1217376000,7,240,4.4772727272727275
2453571,5,B000C6NP4K,I know that some of the reviews that were given by some of the people that were self proclaimed guitar virtuosos. Basically were saying oh he isn't that good and one guy even comments that he messes up on one of the scales and that they were to cheap to edit it out. Well I order this course anyway and have found that it is quite good and he appears to be an exellent teacher and have found it quite enjoyable. I believe he may have left in the one mistake(maybe to show some humillity?)to show that even someone who has played for many years can still make a mistake so as a student do not give up trying. I believe if you just learn half of what he has to offer its well worth it and you may become a fine player. If he was to release more I would buy them.,1187827200,12,760,3.973856209150327
2453572,5,B000C6NP4K,I took guitar lessons for many years and with many instructors. I wish this had been available back then. It is the easiest and most comprehensive way to learn to play.,1184198400,6,168,4.451612903225806
2453573,5,B000C6NP4K,"I don't have this particular one, but I have the 5 dvd set that came with master class package. I own over a dozen other learn guitar dvds and Esteban is by far the best. I'm very new (been playing almost 6 months) and have gotten so much better then what I was in just the month i've owned the dvd's. His exercises for running scales and his picking technique put me miles ahead of where I was. When I started playing, one of the songs I really wanted to learn how to do was Yes ""meet all good people"" and have been failing miserably at it since the beginning. Last night I actually got through it for the first time! Still had a few problems changing cords (but hey I'm new) picking the beginning however was flawless using the techniques I learned from Esteban. I haven't sat down and practiced with a few friends that play in about a month, but the next time I do these guys are gonna freak out. The progess i've made with this technique is really great. Considering some of the othere dvd's i've purchased got 4 and 5 stars in review. Esteban deserves a much higher rateing. This guy far outclasses them by a wide margin.",1172966400,15,1126,4.291079812206573
2453574,5,B000C6NP4K,"I am a TOTAL beginner and have tried to learn using another guidebook and dvd. I learned more from this DVD in 5 minutes than I did in several chapters of the other instructional book and DVD.  He has an easy going style that makes learning from him easy and he teaches you the basics you need to know to get started actually playing.  It was exactly what I hoped for since I am a visual learner.  I felt discouraged from the other book/DVD, but not with this one.  Now I'm just waiting to develop the lovely callouses I so dearly need so practicing will be more comfortable. I love Spanish classical guitar music so I am an eager student to learn this style of guitar.",1167868800,17,669,4.285714285714286
2453575,5,B000C6NP4K,"I checked this out from my local library and was not expecting much, as I always saw Esteban as the con-artist guitarist selling cheap crappy guitars on the home shopping channels (I've played one of these...bad guitar!!!!). However, I was pleasantly surprised. I have played guitar for 16 years, mostly open chords and basic melodic soloing. Esteban's video very clearly and easily added to my repertoire, and I am having fun with some new challenges in the Spanish guitar style.

I don't know how approachable it would be to a beginner, but this method really added some great flavor to my playing.",1166313600,11,600,4.882352941176471
2453576,5,B000C6NP4K,"I have been using this instruction for about a month as a beginner. I really enjoy it. It comes with a nice ringbound book, which has easy to follow instructions for playing each song. It also has the music and tab. There are a few small errors in the book, but easy to spot and remedy.

The dvd instruction is excellent.

This course gets you right into playing music, which is a great motivation to keep going in the early learning stages when your fingers are not used to fretting chords and the progress seems slow.

I am using this as a core to my learning, but also recommend a book or two on learning the guitar; to supplement this nice package. This course is designed to get you right into playing, but other beginner books can add depth to your study of the guitar.",1163462400,28,775,4.3310344827586205
2453577,5,B000C6NP4K,"I found this to be a great guitar lesson. It is great for the beginner or the intermediate player who wants to learn Spanish guitar style. Esteban makes it clear and simple. There are a few aspects he presents, namely some freeform techniques, that I wouldn't recommend for the absolute beginner as it may seem confusing at first but its nice that they are included in the lesson so you have a another level to study after you learn the more basic techniques. Esteban demonstrates the playing methods very clearly and I was actually able to play Malagunea almost immediately, which says a lot. I cannot emphasize how clearly explanatory this lesson is. I was very happy with it. This is one of the better instructional lessons I have seen. It is relatively comprehensive yet simple considering that it is a somewhat more complicated style. Esteban is a great teacher and that makes all the difference. I highly recommend this study course.",1140652800,42,939,4.802469135802469

8096032,5,B000C6NP4K,"I am moving slowly but very happy with Esteban's guitar course for Beginners.
He is thorough and gives you time to rewind and practice and try to get it down better.
I would recommend it for any beginner.",1394323200,,204,4.394736842105263
8096033,5,B000C6NP4K,"I am ordering a 2nd set for myself to use since I gave away mine with a guitar to a family member. Even though I had been playing for over 40 years, and this DVD set takes you from a beginner to more advanced lessons, I learned to play songs and use methods I've never been able to do in the past. Esteban is by far the best teacher I've used and very good in the DVD lessons. He teaches you to play sections of songs and practice, then move onto the next part of the songs until you learn the entire song sets. Some are still difficult, but I've learned to play and keep up with most of his videos and CD's to date. Something I thought would never happen. I've also purchased the 2009 Legacy Esteban Guitar and although made in China by hand, it has held up over the years (Dec. 2013 so far). It is superior in quality over my Washburn ""Oscar Smidt"" 12 string that the bridge started pulling up after a year of use. I have been searching for more Esteban DVD's with guitar lessons since I found him to be an excellent teacher. I can read piano music, guitar chord music, etc. These DVD's you learn by repetition rather than by ear or by reading music. He still has the fastest fingers I've seen in awhile and very long with a reach further than mine. Not to mention growing the fingernails on his right hand and using them all as natural picks.",1385856000,,1345,4.196911196911197
8096034,5,B000C6NP4K,"I bought this as a gift for my husband who wants to learn to play guitar now that he is retired and has the time.  This is a good basic course for a beginner.  It gets you playing simple music before you have time to be bored with all the necessary but not-so-exciting details that you have to learn.  There's a lot of basic information in this 2-DVD set, enough to keep my husband busy for quite a while.  I consider the price of this course to be money well spent.",1358294400,,466,4.087912087912088
