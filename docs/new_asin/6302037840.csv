7820539,3,6302037840,Really overly reviewed not a big shocker as some would put it. How many times has you seen a cut throat?,1518307200,,104,4.0
7820540,5,6302037840,"While Diane (Brenda Vaccaro) and Harry (Chuck Shamata) are out tooling around in Harry's Corvette, they are taunted by a Camaro-load of maniacs. Said maniacs are led by Lep (Don Stroud- THE AMMITYVILLE HORROR), who is even crazier and more dangerous than the rest. Taunting turns into road rage, causing Lep and his fellow thugs to be run off the road. Needless to say, Lep isn't happy! He swears vengeance, convincing the rest of his gang that finding Diane and Harry is now their life's mission. Harry and Diane, having sped away, wind up at Harry's vacation home in the hinterlands. Harry, who turns out to be quite the voyeuristic pervert, believes that he's in for a wild weekend w/ Diane. Well, he's in for a wild one, but NOT in the way he might have imagined! When Lep and company arrive at the homestead, the hell begins. DEATH WEEKEND (aka: THE HOUSE BY THE LAKE) is a particularly nihilistic home invasion / revenge film from 1976. The senseless property damage is epic! As Lep, Stroud is perfectly intimidating. It's the sort of role he seems to have been born to play. The other goons are screwy, but Lep is actually frightening! Ms. Vaccaro is also quite believable, and ultimately resourceful in her part. DW belongs somewhere between STRAW DOGS and LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT. Great stuff...",1402358400,3,1303,4.719298245614035

7820542,1,6302037840,"I will be completely honest, I only got half way through before turning this trash off. This is one of those sleazy exploitation shockers that were so prevalent in its day. Im all for a gripping terrifying backwoods thriller but this was just unlikable from the start. If you like scuzzy drive in fodder than you may want to give this a whirl, otherwise you can avoid this one.",1313193600,,377,4.478260869565218
7820543,5,6302037840,"Good story,good actors. Don Stroud & Kyle Edwards played an excellent role in this film. The story is simple but quite impressive.",1233705600,,130,4.954545454545454
7820544,2,6302037840,"I had not seen this since the first time I saw it on GILCABLE 1977(remember that kiddies)  The only thing I could remember from this film was a bunch of guys getting ready for their turn with this woman and she stabs a guy in the neck with a broken piece of mirror.  That was all I could remember?  I did not have a title or new the actors.  Now fast forward to 2003 and I am watching I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE with Joe Bob Briggs doing commentary(which is great I might add) and he is naming all the RAPE and REVENGE films that were put out after the great stir that LAST HOUSE on the LEFT brought out and he
says AND THEIR IS DEATH WEEKEND!!!  I said to myself COULD THAT BE IT!?!
It is indeed and the scene that soooo disturbed me at age 7 is not so disturbing anymore.  As a matter of fact the movie is not mediocre to say the least and the only rape film I know that the woman(actress Brenda Vaccaro)does not get nude???  I mean nothing!!!(she backed out the last minute much to Dir. William Fruet's anger) I guess that would be like a TERMINATOR movie with no guns :)  Anyway back to this GREAT film Vaccaro and Shambata's adulterous weekend at a country cottage is disrupted by a quartet of vicious goons led by Don Stroud(who is the only one that keeps this movie rolling I might add) Originally called Last House By The Lake(""sheesh"") I tell you I have found more suspense in the movie MY DINNER WITH ANDRE...For RAPE & REVENGE movie completes only",1217721600,,1452,4.216606498194946

Derivative exploitation, but effective nonetheless. Please note that a majority of the reviews listed for this film (also known as THE HOUSE BY THE LAKE) in the IMDb and even MUZE (there are no ""motorcycle thugs"") are littered with errors in the who, what and where of the storyline... so let me set the record straight, at least based on my own viewing of this rare Japanese VHS release. Fashion model Diane (BRENDA VACCARO) accompanies her playboy swinger dentist friend Harry (CHUCK SHAMATA) to his country house to join several others for a weekend-long party. On the way, he allows her to take the wheel of his souped-up Corvette sports car and she engages a gang of hillbilly hoodlums in a dangerous road chase, which ends with the four miscreants crashing their hot rod Camaro off the road and into a creek bed, and the Vette speeding away. The menacing gang leader Lep (veteran DON STROUD) swears vengeance on the pair, especially the driver. Up at the house, Diane is observed by Harry (the voyeur) via a two-way mirror taking off her clothes and nude in the shower. Nice guy this Harry. Not surprisingly, Diane soon discovers that there are no other guests coming up to the lake for the weekend. She also realizes that sleazy Harry just wants a quickie sex romp and another notch on his belt. Meanwhile, the psychotics in the Camaro are causing havoc all over town, nearly killing a local man of the law, in search of the two in the black Corvette. Of course, the vicious thugs arrive at the lake house, terrorizing Diane and Harry, and really begin messing up the place. Two of the gang members even take Harry's expensive speedboat for a spin out on the lake and kill some drunken hicks in a rowboat, who were out to help the dentist. When doctor Harry is revealed to be a bit of a wimp and the chaos really begins to ramp up, Diane in desperation, takes matters into her own hands and begins to exact her revenge, but not before she is sexually assaulted by Lep, the crazed ringleader... and dry-humped by one the creepy gang flunkies while locked in one of the rooms of the house. Strangely enough, the ending of this film has a bit of an ambiguous tone. You'll have to watch it for yourself to see what I'm talking about. Recommended backwoods brutal shocker that is destined for Z-Grade glory.  //thechooper",1158278400,6,2487,4.665148063781321
