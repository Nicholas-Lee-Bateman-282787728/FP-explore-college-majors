8642267,4,B00IICENG4,"Teachers' Day isn't the greatest slasher movie ever made, but it is fun. A lot of slasher movies today seem to aim to be either disturbing or overly gory, but Teachers' Day just aims to be entertaining and light fun. It sort of reminded me of a less goofy version of the Bikini Bloodbath series from a few years back. My favorite character in the movie has got to be Luke. He was a lot like Stifler from the American Pie series. The death scenes are pretty good too. My favorite death scene actually had no blood in it at all. It took place right after a game of bobbing for apples. That's all I'm gonna say as I don't want to spoil it totally. And watch the closing credits where you can hear the hilarious rap song ""Fruit On My Belly"".",1394668800,4,737,4.197183098591549
