6583817,5,B00MJEUXAW,"Beautiful imagery and stunning view of Alaska's Northern Lights. The DVD transports you to Alaska as if you are really there seeing it in person. Highly recommend this for anyone who has never seen them in real life but has always wanted to, and for people that have seen them and want to relive what is one of the greatest natural wonders of the world.",1427587200,11,353,4.446153846153846

8672777,5,B00MJEUXAW,"Fantastic high-def photography!  Lovely scenery!  I fell in love with ""Beneath The Auorora"" within the first 10 minutes of viewing!

I can't wait to play it at our Imbolc celebration to represent the returning light, and to bid one more farewell to winter before the vernal equinox arrives!

I saw the aurora borealis live while in North Dakota some 30 years ago.  The aurora doesn't move nearly as fast as depicted in this time-lapse video, but real-time recordings would probably be too boring to viewers who are not accustomed to ambient videos or to observing nature as it is.  The changes in the aurora's apparition are actually much more subtle. In fact, the first time I saw it live, I just happened to notice it out of the corner of my eye near midnight and thought, ""Hmmm, there must be some sort of outdoor sports event just ending over the horizon."" Then I looked up to see these fantastic curtains of light shimmering and fading in and out. A most spectacular treat!

I can't wait to play this DVD with visiting friends in the room and to hear their comments!

As a lover of ambient music, I thought the selections were well-suited and well-matched to the images.

The special feature on how the human eye and the digital camera perceive the aurora differently is also interesting to us geeks and nature/science lovers who appreciate such technical information.

My only wish would be that the main feature looped endlessly, without the credits.  There may be an option for that, but I haven't seen it.  The composers and musicians and producers should absolutely receive credit for their work, but most ambient DVDs include that info as a separate file.  However...

Great job, Astralis Productions!  What else have you got to wow me with?!!",1515369600,4,1754,4.780730897009967
8672778,5,B00MJEUXAW,"Photos of the northern lights are amazing, but this time-lapse recording captures the wonder of seeing the aurora in real life.  Not as grand as seeing the whole sky of light, but completely joyful and inspiring to view.  I have sent this DVD to loved ones who always wanted to see the northern lights but will never be able to see them in person.  A great find and a great buy.  Thanks.",1514764800,,387,4.333333333333333
