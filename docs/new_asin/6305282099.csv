7887144,5,6305282099,"In a time when old sitcoms are being put on DVD right and left, what's up with Hogan's Heroes? This is a classic program and deserves to be put on DVD. The studio needs to read these reviewa and understand that there is a demand for Hogans Heroes on DVD.",1093046400,5,254,4.1

7887146,4,6305282099,"There is a tendency to consider ""Hogan's Heroes"" to be something of an abomination when it comes to television situation comedies since it had the audacity to prove that life in a Nazi POW camp during World War II could be funny.  Pointing out that historically the camps run by the Luftwaffe were at the opposite end of the spectrum does not matter all that much when the other end consists of a long list of infamous concentration camps where millions of people were murdered.  However, there is a tradition of lampooning the Nazis, which goes back to Charlie Chaplin's ""The Great Dictator,"" and ""Hogan's Heroes"" is certainly in that model.  The two things I would point out, by way of observation, would be that ""Hogan's Heroes"" ran for six years on CBS and that when it went off the air the following season a new military sitcom, ""M*A*S*H,"" premiered.  During the first couple of seasons of that classic series one of the main writers was Laurence Marks, who was the main writer on ""Hogan's Heroes.""  Amazing how fast things can change in television.
This videotape offers up a couple of episodes from the first half of the series.  ""Hogan Go Home"" (Episode 19 from Season 3) finds Colonel Hogan (Bob Crane) is ordered home by the brass to help sell war bonds.  Of course, everybody at Stalag 13 knows that Hogan can do a lot more good leading the resistance from camp than he can on tour in the U.S.  Unfortunately, Colonel Crittendon (Bernard Fox) arrives upon the scene and the bombastic British officer has both seniority and no knowledge of what the POWs are doing.  Even without trying, Crittendon does more to thwart the group's efforts than anything Colonel Klink and Sgt. Schultz have ever done.  ""Will the Real Adolf Stand Up?"" (Episode 12 from Season 2) features Larry Hovis as his Sgt. Andrew Carter finally gets to do something fun as low man on the character totem pole.  As you can guess from the title, Carter has to impersonate the F&uuml;hrer for a mission and goes completely over the top (not quite ""The Producers,"" but in that general direction and closing the gap).  Besides all the shtick it is also fun to see Klink (Werner Klemperer) quivering in the presence of Hitler.  Neither episode is to be taken seriously, but that was pretty much established by the premise of the entire series and the two shows actually create a nice counterpoint between the serious undercurrent of fighting the war and the outright ridicule of Hitler and his goons.",1056758400,3,2474,4.7122969837587005
7887147,5,6305282099,"I remember watching this show all through the 60's and early 70's  It was with deep regret when the show was taken off the air.
I purchased about 30 of the VHS tapes about 5 years ago and still watch them..they never get stale.
The final comment I want to make is ""if the episodes were reality that war (WW2) would have ended alot sooner than it did!!""
That Sgt Shultz....He..He's so German!!!",1052870400,,393,4.383561643835616

7887149,5,6305282099,"This show was before my time. As a matter of fact my parents watched it when they were children. After watching an episode of it on TV Land; I became a fan of the show. Hogan's Heroes is probably the funniest show on TV. They need to keep shows like this on TV, or make copies of all the episodes and sell them to people who love the show for a decent price.",984268800,2,358,3.9178082191780823
7887150,5,6305282099,"Hogan's Heroes is one of the only shows that would dare make a comedy in that time period for that subject!  Col. Klink is a funny and most entertaining charactor to say the least!
Highly Recommended!!!!",928886400,,203,4.638888888888889
