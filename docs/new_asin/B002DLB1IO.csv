3911221,5,B002DLB1IO,"This movie was great, my boyfriend is a big fan of theirs and he showed me a YouTube clip of the movie.  The clip almost brought me to tears, these guys really are endearing, so we went to see the movie and it was GREAT!  You see their high's and lows (mostly lows!), and you're rooting for them throughout the whole movie.  The band was big in the 80s' when metal was real popular.  Then once the metal craze died down things started going sour for them...they had to get ""real"" jobs but they still had thier dream of playing in front of huge crowds. The ending was great (and fairly predictable!) but you really do grow fond of the guys in the group because they are trying SO HARD to make it again in the music industy.  The bond between Lips and Rob is a true testament to friendship and it's a huge part of the movie.  Rock on Anvil!  You've got a new fan!",1249776000,23,861,4.150602409638554
3911222,5,B002DLB1IO,"I can't say enough about just how much I enjoyed this film. I wasn't an Anvil fan before, but I sure as hell am now. This is a story about how two friends started a band and would absolutely not take ""no"" for an answer until they made their dreams come true. A concert ""festival"" promised to have ""thousands"" of fans draws fewer than 200? An almost 1:1 ratio of band members to audience members at a club show? Nothing is enough to discourage these guys to keep rocking and the life lessons for everyone are clear and touching as they maintain the attitude and the desire to keep it all going. Back in the 80's they inspired bands like Metallica, Slayer and others & they will inspire you to keep focused on your dreams no matter what bumps you might face along the road. You can't help but cheer them on & the ending is....well, just watch it yourself",1249430400,8,852,4.33125
3911223,5,B002DLB1IO,"""Anvil: The Story of Anvil"" is an entertaining doc about a Canadian metal band that was always this-close to making it to the big time, but mismanagement, bad investments, and poor recordings always set them back. Through it all though, they managed to release 13 albums mostly to a loyal cult base. The film chronicles their last ditch effort to be re-teamed with the producer of their first album and possibly rise from being an obscure cult band to a well known band. It is funny and touching and I gotta say you really root for these guys that it nearly moved me to tears. You don't even need to be a metal fan to like this movie, very well done!",1248912000,6,650,4.380165289256198

3911239,4,B002DLB1IO,"I assume it gets harder to sing about death once you get past the half-way mark.  But you have to admire these guys for pursuing their dream, not giving up and living with the consequences.  And seeing their friendship and loyalty, let's not rule out the possibility they just weren't ruthless enough to make it.  Rock star, politics, CEO; these are not careers for nice people.

If I had kids who wanted to be rock stars, I'd want them to see Anvil.  The good, the bad and the fact that even if you don't click, the Japanese will come to your rescue.

As a footnote, some of the guys here who did make it really are the best of the best, like Michael Schenker and Carmine Appice.  But even so, I think Lemmy is right to say it's mostly being the right place at the right time.",1416960000,2,777,4.244897959183674
3911240,4,B002DLB1IO,"not a fan of anvil? don't even know who they are? worry not. I didn't know much about this band either (still don't). however, don't let this stop you from immersing yourself in a great  documentary. this really is a movie done in a documentary style (not so much a ""rockumentary""). they really had to work off of a shoestring budget and succeeded in making a really great movie, both inspiring and heartbreaking at the same time (these guys are in their 50s!).

though there are moments that are very spinal tap, the reality of the story seems to rise above the latex-ridden clichs, and presents the artists at their best and worst. but it is all human and devoid of anything fake. the band goes from playing small taverns, not getting paid, eating goulash, to a triumphant finale. there are lots of great interviews in between and some heavy, emotional breakdowns.

however, if you are a struggling band or an individual looking for some emotional fuel, watch this movie and you may even like the METAL to METAL.",1408665600,2,1014,4.653631284916201
3911241,5,B002DLB1IO,"Such a great, positive movie! These guys look on the bright side when other bands would've given up or died... literally!
I watched the movie, then met the band a couple years later and they're as real as this documentary leads you believe.

3911244,5,B002DLB1IO,Any Canadian should enjoy this movie.  This documentary breaks down the reality of struggling metal bands as well as the crash of the early 80's hair metal scene.  You can't help but love these guys who struggle to carry on and who wear their hearts on their sleeves.  Very enjoyable story of comeback for humble metal heroes.,1387929600,,326,4.684210526315789
3911245,5,B002DLB1IO,"Not only is this one of the finest documentaries ever put out, it's also the climax of the career of two of heavy metal's greatest gifts, Robb Reiner and Steve Kudlow.  Their band, Anvil, has demolished false precepts for decades.  The powerful story of their journies is what makes this film so memorable.  In what can only be described as a triumphant underdog cult classic, the band inspires musicians across the board to live their dreams without comprimise.  You'll laugh, cry and probably buy a guitar.  Couldn't recommend it more!",1375574400,,537,4.9222222222222225
3911246,5,B002DLB1IO,"A great documentary about trying to make it in the music biz. It really shows life from the perspective of a bunch of guys who have had a dream of making it big for decades, and never quite managing it. they don't give up, they persevere, and in the end you understand why they do what they do. They might have wasted their lives chasing a dream, but at least they didn't waste it working a 9 to 5 job in an office.
Of course the movie is of particular interest to metal and rock fans, but I think even fans of other genres can learn something here on how thee biz works, and how many setbacks and hardships you can expect as an aspiring singer.",1374710400,,645,4.126984126984127
3911247,5,B002DLB1IO,"This was a very heartbreaking story. And for many reasons I can think of, but the most obvious one is that I can totally relate to this band because I suffered an even more unsatisfying demise in my own musical journey than Anvil did. In my case I gave everything I had for more than 25 years to make something lasting in the music industry. I played in front of more people than Anvil ever did, I wrote many songs that were as good or even better than what Anvil put out, yet I couldn't even gain the noteriety that this band had. It breaks my heart because their music is really very good metal. It reminded me of the work of underground artist Rozz Williams who founded the band's Christian Death and Shadow Project. Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson admitted that without Rozz's musical creativity they never would have found their success with their music. yet major label success was to never be for him, and in 1998 he commited suicide. But for every artist that makes it, there are thousands more that are even better that are never even discovered. I remember when Metalica became famous, it seemed to make no sense to me because there were other bands out there doing the same kind of music even before they were and doing it better. I remember a band from Hawaii called Sacred Rite. Their first album called simply- Sacred Rite is still one of the best metal albums I have ever heard, yet none of you have probably ever heard of them. They simply never got the noteriety they deserved either. And so the sad reality is the music industry is an ugly business. It is really like winning the lottery. It's all chance and miracles no matter how good your music is. Like Anvil I am still hoping for that big break some day but it is not likely to happen. I recommed this film to any young band because it will open your eyes to the reality of the music business.",1367625600,,1869,4.389048991354467
3911248,1,B002DLB1IO,"I was never a huge fan of Anvil back in the day, I didn't mind them, boarding the line of thinking they were OK.
But this thing shows just what pathetic, whinny, lazy idiots the members of Anvil are.
Stop giving excuses for being so pathetic.
The only reason this thing ever came to light because of a an old fan, with connections and money who did them a a solid by supporting this DVD. Basically someone had to grab the immature baby that is Anvil by the ankles, slap them on the bottom and put a nipple in their mouths. And they still couldn't get that right!
They should have just stayed away (as they did until the nipple came along), or, try on your own, because THEY wanted to do it. But they gave up a long time ago.
Yea a lot of bands like mentioning Anvil for 2 reasons: They liked a song or two from them that they did back in the day, and, they feel real bad for them. But not bad enough to bring these 50 year old kids on tour with them (especially after watching this thing).
Anvil can't blame anyone for their failures but themselves. And we can't give Anvil credit for a ridiculous ""come back"" (use the term very lightly) because these losers couldn't and wouldn't do it on their own.
Sad.
Pathetic.",1367366400,4,1215,4.241379310344827
3911249,5,B002DLB1IO,"Back when I was a kid and Anvil was supposedly relevant, in the early to mid 80s, this band was the textbook definition of third (or even fourth) tier metal act.
Not that I remember them that much... I can recall somebody taping me some songs from Metal on Metal (their supposed masterpiece) around 1985 and always fast forwarding the cassette when they came up. They weren't really that bad, they just sounded lame, like some lesser talented Manowar with boring songs and no charisma. My best guess is that back in the day, some people outside Canada listened to them simply because they weren't that many bands to choose from, and that their rapid slide into irrelevance was more a consequence of their lack of talent rather than management and record label woes.
The movie makes a big deal about how important they were in shaping the early sound of thrash metal, but really, I don't see how this band could've influenced Metallica, Anthrax or anyone for that matter. While Venom, Diamond Head, Motrhead, Raven and Exciter had a seminal role bridging the NWOBHM with early thrash, Anvil was just a standard radio metal band that couldn't write good singles.
Now, don't get me wrong. I do admire these guys, but not because of their musical legacy, and being a guy who quit his own band at 26 and music altogether at 30 because juggling between two careers was too hard, I can't feel nothing but respect for this duo.
The Story of Anvil struck a chord on a lot of people because it's not really about an unsuccessful, over the hill heavy metal band: it's a testimony to friendship, never giving up on your dreams and the power music has on people.
Back when I saw this movie in 2010, I was so moved by it that I bought Metal on Metal and Forged in Fire. Sadly, both albums confirmed me, at 38, what I already knew at 12: this band's just not that good, or even mildly interesting.
That said, this documentary manages to be both a fun ride and an incredible study on human nature that any music lover will doubtlessly enjoy... and will be Anvil's ultimate legacy.

Notable DVD Extras:
Aside from a rather uninteresting commentary track, there are three enlightening deleted scenes. The first one features extra footage of Lips working as a caterer, the second, the story of Lips' older brother's medical problems, and the third, short ""where are they now"" style interviews with two original members who left the band in 1989. It's quite easy to see why said scenes were left in the cutting room floor: had the first two been included, the film's tone would've turned up too depressing, and the third one, while informative, would've hindered the documentary's narrative pace.",1365120000,2,2676,4.681528662420382
3911250,5,B002DLB1IO,"I first heard of this documentary being made on a show here in Nyc called Friday Night Rocks with Eddie Trunk who people also know from That Metal Show on Vh1 Classic,i have been a fan of Rock/Metal since i was a teenager and to be honest i had never heard of Anvil,sad but true. I decided to see this documentary at the theater when it came out and i must say it is absolutely great..In watching it my heart went out to Steve ""Lips"" Kudlow and Robb Reiner in seeing all of the BS that they go through while on tour in Europe and in trying to make their dream a reality although they aren't getting any younger,there are moments in this documentary where i really felt bad for the band,however there are also moments that are quite funny and the end is uplifting...For anyone who is a fan of this music who hasn't seen this yet...I highly recommend that you do.",1353974400,,861,4.288343558282208
3911251,5,B002DLB1IO,"Last year, I came across this title on the DVD rack of my local Fry's Electronics & I did't know what to make of it.  From the mugging band members on the cover (a pair of decidedly middle-aged guys; one bare-chested & the other seemingly doing a bad Angus Young impression), I figured that ot was just some half-baked Spinal Tap wannabe.  I must admit that I'd never actally heard of these guys before & was awfully sceptical when the procession of metal elite-types started going on about Anvil's massivive influence (not that I'm some sort of authority on the subject of '80s metal, but considering the plautids being tossed around by the likes of Slash, Scott Ian, etc, you'd think that they'd at least have gained SOME level of noteriety).

As a result, I spent much of the first part of the presentation wondering to myself whether this was legit or just parody.  The part where the lawyer comes along and tries to talk them nto dumping their manager in favor of him seemed just a bit too ""Spinal Tap-ish"" to really be taken seriously, but ultimately I came to the decision that what I was seeing was an actual bit of ""reality"" (as opposed to the phony ""reality"" which has become such a staple of the modern media) & while some of the scenes of personal interaction between characters appeared to be somewhat less than spontanious, I just chalked it up to ""creative license"" intended to butress the story line.  If this WAS on fact a ""mockumentary"" as I had originally suspected, there would certainly have been frequent stabs at absurd humor (there are virtually none) and the characters individual stories wouldn't have been presented with such sincerity (by the end of the story, Robb and Lips' struggles and triumphs genuinely endear them to the viewer.  I damn-near had a tear in my eye as they took the stage n Japan at the end of the flick!).

To summerize... I really liked this biopic.  Perhaps it has something to do with my abyssmal expectations prior to actually seeing it contrasted against what I ultimately found to be an enjoyable experience that really drew me in (even as the only-occasional metal fan that I am)",1347840000,,2136,4.662234042553192
3911252,5,B002DLB1IO,"This is a great documentary about music, friendship and hope. It makes me feel like a better person and I cry of happiness everytime I watch it. By the way,Does anybody know the name of the song they play at the end of the movie, when Lips and Robb Reiner are walking in the streets of Japan and Lips, pointing at the sky, says ""Oh, Godzilla!""? My advise is: if you want to feel good about yourself, watch this great documentary. 5 stars.",1338768000,,438,4.289156626506024
3911253,5,B002DLB1IO,"This is a great documentary show about  a band that rode a high wave of success back in the early 80's only to fade away.  They are a thrash type of metal band , and they are good at it , not that I find thrash to be as good as regular metal in the slightest. in fact it's far below regular metal in talent. Still this is like a real spinal tap band with everything going wrong for them for decades. The tour is a disaster that is a real life comedy of errors.  At least we don't have to see endless drug stories in this one. In fact the band is at this point regular dudes just trying to make it. The two lead guys are quite attached to each other and that's quite evident as they are brothers really. This documentary show goes by fast and quick as the band stumbles from disaster to another. They are decent guys though and you hope that they win. the endind is a good one and I won't spoil it for you. The dvd has extra features and by the end I did like anvils brand of metal much more than I used to. Although I would rather hear black sabbath or the scorpions anyday! Still after watching this show you will wish these guys the best. after all few people their age are still out there rocking!",1332720000,2,1200,4.033613445378151
3911254,5,B002DLB1IO,"This is like the spinal tap in real life. Very much enjoyed the documentary, would see the band again when it comes my ways....",1332288000,,127,4.333333333333333
3911255,4,B002DLB1IO,"Meet the real life Spinal Tap, the guys of Anvil.  As the film proudly proclaims, with such luminaries as Metallica, many influential metal bands from the 80s can list Anvil as one of their influences and sing their praises.  The group has put out 14 albums over a 30 year career, yet have you ever heard of them?  This excellent documentary rectifies that oversight.

But the sad thing is, this IS a documentary and is all real.  While Spinal Tap is a funny story about a once-great band bumbling through a comeback tour.  Anvil, unfortunately for them, never really hit it big and is almost a cautionary tale of the rock world.  While many rock and rollers realize by the time they hit their mid 30s that if they haven't yet made it, they tend to pack it in.  Not Anvil.  These guys (naively?) still strive for that elusive brass ring of stardom, and always fall short.  We see every excruciating (funny and uncomfortable) moment of one of their recent tours of crooked club owners, lying A&R guys and fickle fans.  It gets to the point where it is almost sad to see these two guys chasing an elusive dream.

And yet it is oddly inspiring.  This is the story of two guys who refuse to give up their dreams, in the face of in many cases, insurmountable obstacles.  Many bands have banned Spinal Tap on tour buses because it is considered bad luck because of the eerily prescent look at the wacky world of the rock music business world.  This should be another one.  At least you can laugh at Spinal Tap, because that is the point.  In the case of Anvil, this is real and you get an uneasy feeling of laughing at someone who does not deserve it.  The movie actually ends on a high note, proving sometimes that truth IS stranger than fiction.  This is a great movie, worth watching.  Parents, show it to your kids if they are considering entering the music business.  It gives a very unflinching view of the grunge behind the glitz.  As the old saying goes, if it was easy, everyone would do it.  This film shows what happens when one tries and fails, over and over.  Yet they keep coming back for more.  Humorous, sad, hopeful, and in the end, inspiring, this movie is a must for anyone who loves a good story about interesting people.  Not to be missed.",1331596800,,2254,4.4365853658536585
3911256,5,B002DLB1IO,"I really don't think there are any other bands out there who could honestly say that they'd still be doing what they do for 30+ years even if they didn't get paid. That is what makes Anvil different from everyone else. They have been trying to ""make it"" for over 30 years and they still have not given up. Yes, the similarities to Spinal Tap are humorous, but what makes this documentary so special is the fact that this is a real band and this is a true story. And this story has a lot of heart. Steve and Robb are unlike any other bandmates in the world. They not only share the bond of heavy metal brotherhood, they share life. Success or not, they have stood by one another in pursuit of the rock and roll dream. Unspoiled by the glitz and glamour of making it big, these guys are the real deal doing what they've always dreamed of doing and continuing to do it no matter what the cost. Sure the stories are often funny, but they are also a sad reminder that in a business where only money matters, true talent and heart are too often overlooked.
Will Anvil ever be inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame? Of course not. Should they be? Definitely. If for nothing else, at least for their dedication to their fans. Unwavering faith in themselves is the message I got from this movie. They are an inspiration to everyone who has ever had a dream and were too afraid to go after it. They are happy with their lives because they have never backed away from going for that dream even now that they are in their 50's. Who else can say that? My hat is tipped to these guys and I have the utmost respect for them. They are the best band so many people have never heard and really the only one that is worth hearing. Keep up the great work guys. You're number one in my book! Anvil forever!",1329177600,2,1792,4.227405247813411
3911257,5,B002DLB1IO,"On one level, this is a real life ""Spinal Tap,"" as many reviews point out.  The band even visits Stonehenge!  The movie begins with a disastrous tour of Europe, set up by an apparent amateur promoter and fan who talked the band into a tour via a number of email messages.  She promised them 1500 Euro per show.  As you might expect, they got essentially nothing, and the promoter got engaged to one of the band members.  It's a tough 5 weeks for the band, and when they return to Canada they are discouraged, but not so discouraged that they don't muster up the money and the will for a subsequent last shot at stardom.

This movie works because Lips and Robb Reiner are such likeable guys with such enthusiasm for their music.  It doesn't hurt that the Anvil classics like ""Metal on Metal"" are really, really good songs.  These guys aren't deluding themselves that they have a hard road, being 50 and attempting to get back on top of a music genre that has, by and large, come and gone.  The intensity and purity of their belief in their eventual success is inspiring and touching, even if they never get past where they are right now.  That belief is also the core of a lot of their problems, as they are too willing to trust people that they really shouldn't.

""Anvil"" is at least worth a rent, and would make a great gift for the metal fan in your life.",1329091200,2,1357,4.366533864541832
3911258,4,B002DLB1IO,"Not that the movie was bad, in fact I really liked the movie. However the book goes into much more detail than the movie which is great. I'll keep it short and sweet, if you have any interest in Anvil or liked the movie I highly recommend this book. Great Read, B grade in my book!",1327017600,,281,4.035714285714286
3911259,3,B002DLB1IO,"I remember hearing a little bit about ANVIL during the 80's, but they truly were overshadowed and overlooked during the heyday of the classic heavy metal era. My general recollection was (and still is) that they were sort of a bunch of clowns on the rock scene. Early on in the film, there are some brief segments of concert footage of the band from their zenith in 1984; the lead singer/guitarist Steve ""Lipps"" Kudlow is wearing a thin mesh S & M shirt, a studded neck collar, and he's playing his guitar with a woman's vibrator. It's good for a laugh, but the image of an ugly heavy metal drag queen armed with a dildo may have been a bit much for the average ""metal"" fan at the time. Who knows?

At many points in the film, it felt like I was watching a Spinal Tap-style spoof; ""Lipps"" oftentimes comes off as hyperbolic and just plain goofy, particularly when he was nearly getting into physical altercations with first a club manager in Prague who refused to pay the band after a show, and then with his life long friend and drummer of the band, Robb Reiner. I would be laughing at many of these scenes until I started seeing tears streaming down their faces, or some of their family members' faces -- It was at these moments I started thinking to myself ""Jesus, this is actually real. This heavy metal version of ""Bob & Doug McKenzie"" has been scratching out this meager musical existence for over 30 years, holding out a quixotic hope that they will eventually achieve stardom."" Part of me felt truly sorry for the band; part of me felt like they were pathetic aging rockers who should have packed it in a long time ago. Most of all, I felt sorry for the family members of the band; the wives, the siblings, and the band members' children who had also been forced to endure the protracted failure of ANVIL; when the older sister of ""Lipps"" wearily agrees to allow the band to borrow $18,000L to make a high quality production for their 13th album, I actually started to cringe. All I could think was that, yet again, this was going to be another ANVIL failure, and that this poor woman was going to lose all of her money. At first, this seemed to be the case; no major record label was interested in picking up the album. However, in the 21st century internet age, it's become obvious that the major record labels are becoming obsolete - Why depend on the record companies for something that you can now effectively do yourself? This is what ANVIL did, and this is what made their windfall - A Japanese booking agent listens to a copy of their new album, loves it, and then invites them to Japan to play in front of 20,000 screaming fans.  Coupled with the release of this film at Sundance, and support from high profile musicians such as Slash of Guns n' Roses and Lars Ulrich of Metallica, ANVIL seems to have finally achieved their dream.  I was also happy to read on their Wikipedia page that ""Lipps"" has repaid the money borrowed from his sister to record their album.  Truly, it's a one-in-a-million miracle for the band.

Best of luck to them in the future.",1323820800,5,3071,4.476785714285715
3911260,3,B002DLB1IO,LIKED A FEW SONGS SO I DECIDED TO GET THIS CD. AS FAR AS I KNOW THIS CD COVERS IT ALL. LIKE I SAID NOT A BIG FAN JUST LIKED SOME SONGS. SO IF NOT A BIG FAN IT'S WORTH BUYING USED THRU AMAZON.,1317945600,,191,3.3636363636363638
3911261,4,B002DLB1IO,"You really have to stand in awe of the dedication, perseverance, and optimism of these guys in the face of one bitter disappointment after another. Lips and Robb have stayed together dedicated to doing their music THEIR way for over 30 years, regardless of making very little money off of it after pouring their lives into their art.

I have to take issue with amazon's reviewer, Sam Graham. He says that Anvil simply aren't that good. I'm sorry, but he doesn't sound knowledgeable about heavy metal. First, let me say this: I wasn't very familiar with Anvil until recently. I have sat down and listened to several of their songs from most of their albums. I can honestly say that these guys, while not as good as Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth or Anthrax, they're certainly not bad at all. I mean, those bands aren't called the Big Four for nothing. These are legendary bands that are superior to most bands anyway. It's an unfair comparison. You don't HAVE TO be as good as Metallica to have some moderate success. Anvil is a damn fine band. I'm a college-trained musician, and I've been an avid metalhead (and a fan of many other genres as well, such as jazz, funk, and latin) since the mid 1980's. I can honestly say that Anvil is as good a band as any deserving of wider recognition.

Like another reviewer said, it would be nice if some of the artists that are shown praising Anvil (Slash, Lemmy, Lars from Metallica), would take them out as an opening act at least once. THAT would help them!

If you're intrested in heavy metal at all, and especially if you're a musician yourself, you MUST watch this.",1316131200,3,1607,4.592334494773519

Starts off with some funny parallels to ""This Is Spinal Tap"" but then turns into something unexpectedly emotional and deep.  I ended up watching it numerous times, back to back.  And when I get down about things, I watch it again for inspiration.  You grow to learn about and care very much for the band, and by the end you are absolutely rooting for them.  Made on a shoe-string budget but this doc has it where it counts.  Have some kleenex ready -- unless you are made of stone, you will cry at points.

Intrigued, I started out thinking that this was a mockumentary similar to ""This Is Spinal Tap"", but when I started to see people like Lemmy, Slash & Lars Ulrich being interviewed, I caught on that this was a DOCUMENTARY.  Amusing at first, it quickly became very engaging and moving.  I felt so sorry for these guys!  I was literally sitting with a box of Kleenex as I watched the rest of the film, all the while praying that something would happen for them.  Following the guys through hope & failure over & over again was heart-wrenching!  I was crying through most of it, but in the end, you come away with a feeling of hope again & an amazing respect for this band of really great musicians who just refuse to give up on their dream.  How rare is that?  As an aspiring author, I know what that is like.  Wonderful film!  I sure hope that this jumpstarts their success.

You witness the culmination of the tour......the ""big gig"" at the end......the triumph at the ""festival crowd"" of 152 people (expected crowd - 5,000).

It's difficult to tell how much was real, and what was put on for the camera. Having seen Anvil play Reading in 1981(or was that 2?), I know something of their background (from Toronto), play crappy heavy metal (oops, did I say that out loud).

Then saw them last weekend and they haven't changed a bit (well maybe the bassist has). Music still as bad.

This was a band destined to go nowhere .. and they would have succeeded, but for this film.

We learn a bit about the business along the way.  Substantially speaking though it's hard to give the movie much more than 3 stars.  From the reviews and write-ups I was expecting a bit more.  ""The greatest movie about rock n roll ever made"" touts the cover - I don't think so.  As a documentary it had some interesting moments but was long even at 80 minutes.  It bordered on the over-sentimental - ""reality TV"" style.

While it may be worth a watch, you might want to rent before handing over the cash.  And speaking of cash, if this movie doesn't boost their album sales, nothing will.  I'm sure it has already though.  Anvil it seems put themselves back on the map with this movie, and for all the lack of competent managers producers and marketers that they blame their failure on, whoever produced this movie did a pretty slick job on the marketing.",1280880000,,1008,4.46448087431694
3911272,5,B002DLB1IO,"To watch ""Anvil: The Story of Anvil"" is to be reminded that your faith in human nature is not misguided; that hope springs eternal, that it is never too late in your life to strive for greatness. The movie just might reaffirm your faith in humanity.  Here's four guys that just will not give up; at least for the two original members of the band who have kept Anvil going for more than 30 years.

Are they a real-life Spinal Tap?  Yes.  However, they are also real people with real dreams, desires, hopes, and fears.  These guys inspired me because they did not give up, even when trapped in the European tour straight out of Dante's Inferno, with each date becoming increasingly surreal and pathetic.  Even the ending of the movie is so Spinal Tap-like, it's a case of life imitating art, when, at the end of their rope, they are asked to play a gig in Japan that revitalizes their career (just like the end of Spinal Tap).  Quite surreal.  I hope these guys get the success they deserve.

One of the bonus features on the DVD is an interesting, if not long-winded interview with Lars Ulrich of Metallica.  Man, that guy could talk the ears off of a donkey.  He gives some good props to Robb Reiner, the drummer of Anvil. Although you can tell Lars is a little self-centered, he seems generous with his praise, and doesn't quite live up to his mean reputation.

Another bonus feature is ""a day in the life"" of Lips, the lead singer and guitarist of Anvil, as we follow him around in his job at a food-preparation warehouse (it's clear that this is a low-paying, strenuous job).  Kind of sad in a way, but Lips seems to accept his lot in life with almost zen-like serenity.  Everybody should be as positive as Lips, the world would be a much better place.",1278892800,2,1755,4.44375
3911273,4,B002DLB1IO,"In the 1980s, heavy metal was the rage in popular music. Anvil was a Canadian band that included Steve ""Lips"" Kudlow and Robb Reiner. Unfortunately, Anvil never quite made it. About twenty years after heavy metal died, filmmakers caught up with Kudlow and Reiner. The result is the charming documentary Anvil: The Story of Anvil.

By the 2000s, Anvil was releasing music on obscure record labels and touring small bars. The documentary includes memorable footage from a disastrous European tour. The tour was organized by a fan and the band was left with no transportation, few fans at their gigs, and - often - no pay.

But the Anvil documentary is not just another ""Spinal Tap"" in which viewers jeer at a bunch of losers. Viewers cheer for these guys. Why?

Anvil is a story of friendship. Viewers like Lips and Reiner because they come across as down-to-earth guys who love to play heavy metal. Both men come from Jewish immigrant families. Reiner's family supported his involvement in music; Lips' did not. Their friendship is closer than the relationship that either enjoys with his wife.

Also, this is a movie about dreamers and the importance of dreams in our lives. In their early-fifties, Kudlow and Reiner work menial jobs to support themselves but they will not surrender their dreams. Viewers will consider how far they'd go to keep a dream alive.

Although in the late '80s I pretty much liked 99% of metal bands, when the genre was at its peak, I was never a fan of Anvil, and the reason is because their songwriting was extremely lacking and redundant, as opposed to many of the contemporary metal bands of their time, which had at least a few good songs and decent hooks, but I must say this movie is enjoyable for open minded individuals, regardless. Me included.
I firmly believe the whole reason why Anvil never made it, IS because of their crappy songwriting, when the band members and their producer, in this movie, blame their lack of success to the ""crappy production, crappy management...."" lame excuses.
If you're a somewhat decent musician, and you can come up with somewhat decent hooks, there will be people out there who will enjoy your music. Anvil's music appealed to mostly hardcore metal fans and listeners who never expected much out of music to begin with.
The scenes about the Tiziana Arrigoni character were rather annoying, and I hope those who watch the movie did not get the impression that all Italians are that way.
She was just an inept, spoke poor English and that was it. There are many Italians who are far more intelligent, capable and speak far better English than that woman.",1268784000,5,1608,4.746428571428571

3911281,5,B002DLB1IO,"It's not every day that you watch a movie about aging heavy metal musicians who never quite made it and find inspriration. Anvil: The Story of Anvil is one of those occasions, though.

As a middle-aged metalhead, I was already familiar with their music from the early 80s. Like the rest of the world, I was surprised to find that they never went away and were still recording albums, going on tours, with the dream that this would be the one that would hit the big time.

Watching Lips and Robb talk about their 30 years together and their dream of being rock stas was amazing. How two people can have such perpetual optimism and hope is baffling. To hear Lips say that everything went wrong on a tour, but at least there was a tour for them to go wrong on... now that's refreshing and inspirational. In a time when people focus on the negatives all too much, he found ways to focus on the positive. And against all odds, Anvil has finally made it.

You can't help but root for these guys when you're watching the movie. And if you really want to enhance the experience, read the book, too. You won't believe what these guys have been through over the years.

3911284,4,B002DLB1IO,"Sometimes pioneers just don't get the credit they deserve.  Take Anvil, a band that helped to define much of what is meant by the term ""heavy-metal"" (their signature album was in fact called ""Metal on Metal""), yet a band that never achieved the kind of worldwide fame or notoriety that groups like Metallica, Twisted Sister, Slayer, Megadeth, Guns & Roses or Motorhead did while following in Anvil's footsteps.  Now, thanks to the documentary ""Anvil: The Story of Anvil,""  that injustice may, at least in part, have been rectified.

Director Sacha Gervasi took her cameras to Toronto, Canada to catch up with two of the original members - lead guitarist Steve ""Lips"" Ludlow and drummer Robb Reiner - who are busy raising families and holding down jobs during the day, while still rocking out as Anvil (with additional members) in local clubs at night.  Yet the dream of ""achieving bigger and better things ahead"" persists.  The first step in fulfilling that dream comes in the form of a tour of Europe - a tour that, thanks to incompetent management and a flurry of scheduling missteps, turns into an aggravating comedy of errors, with the group stuck playing in rickety venues to decidedly under-whelming crowds for virtually no money.  Yet, unbowed and unbroken, the band members continue to forge ahead, staying true to their dream.

Next up is the recording and promoting of a new album, even though securing the funding for that endeavor presents a nearly insurmountable obstacle to these two working-class dudes.  But the members know they are fighting a losing battle against aging and time (Lips is already in his 50s) and that if they don't strike while the iron's hot, such an opportunity may be lost forever.

As subjects for a documentary, Lips and Reiner are wonderfully appealing in the openhearted frankness and unflappable optimism they display in the face of some pretty daunting setbacks.  Indeed, the movie is at its most compelling when it focuses on the complex, tumultuous relationship between these two lifelong partners and buddies (they often refer to each other as ""brothers"") who tear each other down almost as much as they build each other up, who cater to one another`s weaknesses almost as much they reinforce one another`s strengths.  Yet, it is a relationship that has worked for them for decades and has helped them remain hopeful through a lifetime of disappointments.

In fact, if there's any lesson to be gleaned from the story of Anvil, it's that a good dream will never die - provided you never give up trying to achieve it.",1264204800,2,2562,4.916473317865429

3911286,5,B002DLB1IO,"Anvil! The Story of Anvil - I heard this movie was very very good - and the trailer certainly leads you to believe this would be so too - but I was still completely unprepared for the emotional roller coaster I was about to experience. Watching Lips and Robb travel the rocky road of life for 90 minutes was way more intimate than any other rock documentary that I've ever seen. I'm still a bit teary-eyed, nearly three hours after watching it.  Hearing these mountains of praise for the band from band members of Metallica, Slayer, Anthrax as well as Slash was really something. ""Everybody ripped them off and left them for dead,"" says Slash, voicing an idea which could have easily been the title of the film. Ultimately, the love and emotion between these guys for their cause, and their art, is unconquerable, even if you do get a major laugh at Robb's painting to ""The Megalithic Anvil Monument"", you can see that the spirit is just that huge (Robb's paintings are really very good, including the one of the drumkit, and the one that hangs at the top of his staircase, which will fetch millions on auction some day). On Rotten Tomatoes, the movie gets a 98% approval rating, which means that out of 123 reviews there cannot be more then two that are negative, making it just about the highest-ever rating on Rotten Tomatoes. It is well deserved. I'd watch the movie again, but I don't know if I'm ready to have my heart put through the wringer again so soon.

After I watched the movie, I went and read everything I could find out about the band. The story about Sacha Gervasi, and how he had been their roadie at 16, went off and done all sorts of incredible things, and then re-entered their lives to make this movie, is amazing. His touching personal note at the movie's website is also something amazing to read. I bought a signed DVD with extras for $20 on their website, I'm sure it's going to be well worth it.

The band's classic album, ""Metal on Metal"", was released in 1982, and I remember hearing several songs from it on the radio, including the title track and ""Stop Me."" Great tunes. That year Slash was 17, Lars Ulrich of Metallica and Scott Ian of Anthrax were 19 and Tom Araya of Slayer was 21. Now, 27 years later, people are still talking about it. Amazing.

This is by far the best movie I've seen this year. Don't watch ""Avatar"", watch ""Anvil""!

For those who love Anvil for those that love the Anvil movie, there's nothing like owning a copy DVD signed by Lips and Robb.  The DVD does offer a few interesting tidbits, the most ""interesting"" (not sure that's the right word) is the full interview with Lars, where we see what director Sacha Gervasi had to go through to get a soundbite out of rock's most eager interviewee (this guy can talk and talk and talk).

Other extras are three deleted scenes (""Children's Catering"", ""Former Band Members"", ""Lips' Brother"") and a scene of Sacha drumming with the band's performance of ""School Love"" in Japan. Of the deleted scenes, ""Former Band Members"" should have been in the film, as it interviews two of the five ex-Anvil guitarists and bassists. INterviewed is Dave ""Squirrelly"" Allison, a formerly skinny metalhead who's turned into a middle-aged Canadian hoser with a mullet, baseball cap and mustache driving a pickup and chilling out at his cottage up north. More interesting is former bass player Ian ""Dix"" Dickson, who was a handsome Steve Harris-type young metaller who has turned into a successful artisan/goth/lutist with a home arts and crafts studio. Drinks his coffee from a cool skull mug.

The ""Children's Catering"" scene is extended out of scenes that are in the movie, the most part of it shows Lips driving to work, talking about his life and the jobs he's had (delivering flowers, delivering fish), his aborted studies in cinematography, the end of a fifteen year relationship chronicled on the ""Worth the Weight"" album, a.k.a. the death album (death of Robb's father, death of Lips' marriage, flower deliveries to funeral homes where he saw his first dead bodies, etc.). That is also the theme of the segment Lips' brother Jeffrey, who has been diagnosed with a neural degenerative disease and only has a short time left. The clip shows Lips with siblings Jeffrey, Gary and Rhonda in Birmingham, Alabama, it is a very sad, private moment.",1263772800,5,4329,4.686842105263158

3911292,4,B002DLB1IO,"(Caution, spoiler ahead)
This is a wonderfully funny, sad and moving documentary about two close friends who formed a metal band in the early 1980s, made it big very briefly, and then descended into obscurity for decades while the many groups they inspired enjoyed great success. The lead singer and the drummer are in dead end jobs (one delivers school meals, the other operates a power drill) and yet they are convinced, against mounting evidence, that they will make it. What really makes this succeed is the total honesty and emotional openness we see in the two characters, who are often excited, angry or in tears. There are no cold characters here -- everyone, despite their flaws, is warm and honest and reflective.

After a part-hilarious and part-tragic tour of Europe, where the large crowds promised by the hapless promoter singularly fail to materialise, Anvil records a demo tape of their 13th album and reestablishes contact with the English music producer who worked on their first album in the 1980s. He is very blunt about why their star faded so quickly -- bad songs, bad production, bad recording labels and bad promotion. The lead singer borrows $25,000 from his sister to make the album and yet, despite all the effort and sacrifice, it attracts little interest.

(Here's the spoiler). My problem with the documentary is what comes next. The band are as down on their luck as ever, when all of a sudden, they get a phone call from a Japanese promoter who promises them a big gig in Tokyo. Over they go to Japan and hey presto!, they're playing in a huge space in front of thousands and thousands of young screaming fans, finally hitting the big time after all those years of poverty and frustration. This all seemed just a little bit too convenient to me.

That said, the richness of the relationships between the lead singer, the drummer and their families is what makes this stand out. You don't need to know anything about, or even like, metal music. The hapless promoter may be not very good, but she's a warm human being, and ends up marrying one of the back-up band members.

The other notable thing about this delightful work is that it's only 80 minutes long, yet never feels forced. I can't believe it didn't make the Oscars shortlist.",1262304000,3,2266,4.743654822335025
3911293,5,B002DLB1IO,"Don't be scared off by the mega-kitschy cover. This dvd can be amazingly inspiring and motivating (not just for musicians).

The guitarist/singer and drummer are the main focus here, and both are extremely likable. It's so refreshing to see people that do things both because they love to do it, and because they really believe in themselves. Being a huge Metal fan myself, it helps that they have such a simple, childlike faith in METAL! But any of their attitudes could be applied to any preference.

I just loved how they couldn't care less about the obstacles: indifferent record companies, family members who weren't entirely enthused, rip off promoters, etc. They just want to live Metal (aka their DREAM). It's important to stress that these heavy metal veterans don't live in a fairy tale world...far from it. Rather they see the abyss on a regular basis, and have learned how to deal with it in as healthy a way as possible. For Lipps and Robb, fighting is just another outlet, one that can be a little heartbreaking at times, but they bounce back with thousand-mile-stare perspective. Alot of bands that are really young and having ego problems might be able to salvage and resalvage themselves by learning the lessons implied here.

I wasn't very familiar with Anvil back in the early '80's. Back then, I was consumed with Dio-era Black Sabbath, Ac/Dc, Judas Priest. But after watching this movie, I got more interested in their music, and now I'm sold. So, grab this movie, and then be sure to grab a new copy of one of their cds, just to make sure these inspiring veterans get PAID!",1262131200,,1595,4.750902527075812
3911304,5,B002DLB1IO,"I saw Anvil on a talk show some time back and wondered (a) whatever happened to them in the first place and (b)what was all the fuss about this DVD.
I treated myself to a copy of the movie and was really amazed and moved by their story. This movie, more than any other I have seen, conveys all the emotion, passion and pain living for your art must be about. Anvil endures, without the success of platinum records, awards or the trappings of what we perceive to be the ""rock star"" existence.
We are taken on an ersatz tour with Anvil and witness the less glamorous side of trains, planes and automobiles. The anquish of less-than capacity (ahem) crowds; the frayed nerves 35plus years of head-banging-turned-banging-your-head-against-the-wall have brought upon our heroes. It's all very powerful and makes a real-life story so compelling.
The Barenaked Ladies song ""If I had $1,000,000"" comes to mind-- if we did, we'd give it to Anvil...the reward for their endurance.",1261958400,,969,4.843373493975903
3911305,3,B002DLB1IO,"This is a decent film, but not a great one, but it is certainly not ""the greatest film ever made about rock and roll"".  It doesn't really flow like a good film, in fact, jumps around rather incoherently from gig to gig, happening to happening, and it feels unfinished.  The actual story of Anvil is interesting, though.

We see Anvil playing really small venues in Europe (including one when they show up 2 hours late and don't get paid because the owner said most of the people have left, and he was right).  Eventually the band got their money for that gig, but it was only 100 euros.  There's also one scene where they play for 174 people in a venue that can hold 10,000 people.  We see Steve ""Lips"" Kudlow talk and talk about how he's not giving up, and how his music makes him feel good, and it's the only thing he loves doing.  We also see his extended family, his wife, sisters, and the like, and while they're supportive of him, they are also weary, and later in the film you can tell that Steve's behaviour is getting to them.  Steve's behaviour is also getting to the drummer, Robb Reiner, Steve's childhood friend and the only other original member of Anvil.  Reiner is actually a good drummer, and a good painter (we see his painting in his house).  He's also a bit of an introvert, and I think Reiner would like to cut Steve loose and quit the band.  There are times in the movie where he almost does, but he always comes back to the band, perhaps out of loyalty and friendship.  To me, Steve seems determined to recapture his lost youth.  He had taste of success when he was very young in the 80's (where Anvil was mentioned along with other bands like Metallica), and he seems desperate to get back to that time.  In an early scene when Anvil is playing a festival, there are other rock legends around, and Steve tries to make conversation with them.  Most of them (like Vanilla Fudge's Carmine Appiece, one of rock's most underrated drummers) don't remember him and/or ignore him.  It's rather sad to see him like this.  He's almost like a high school jock going back to the old high school because he was someone there, but in the real world, he's nobody.

As much as it pains me to say, I think the reason that Anvil has never made it big is simply their music is not particularly good.  Metallica, for example, has grown out of their head banging days and go on to make much more complex music.  Steve's guitar playing is decent, and he enjoys it, but his songwriting is pedestrian, and his vocals are just as pedestrian.  You feel for the guy (struggling artist is a bad thing to be, and struggling artists always elicit sympathy from me),but in Anvil's case, the struggle isn't worth it.  The band does have a cult, most of whom have been following them since the early 80's.  In fact, one of them ends up giving Steve a job as a telemarketer (which Steve is no good at).  It's kind of touching, yet sad at the same time.  It's almost like Steve and most of Anvil's fans are all in arrested development.

The film was made by one of Anvil's longtime fans, so he's going to be a bit biased in his filmmaking.  That's OK, but the film is jumpy and disjointed, and has no real flow to it.  That's a problem with many current documentaries.  I would recommend watching it, but it's a depressing, sad film, and it's sad to see Steve ""Lips"" Kudlow indulging in self delusion.",1261699200,11,3390,4.405144694533762
3911306,5,B002DLB1IO,"'The Story of Anvil', having now seen it in the theater and now on DVD, I feel is among the top rock movies ever made.  There have been several comparisons to 'This is Spinal Tap' - the coincidence of Rob/Robb Reiner, and the humorous antics and life of the heavy metal world.  But Lipps and Robb's story is real -- it's harder to imagine how much more drama and pain these guys can experience in their quest for getting Anvil ""to rise"" (as Robb said in the film).  When the film came out, for me it was 'oh, Anvil - that early '80s heavy metal band, whatever happened to them?' and then I find out that, sadly, not much good has happened for them since the days of 'Metal on Metal', and when they were among the crop of hard rock/metal bands such as Metallica, Slayer, Bon Jovi, etc to emerge from that time.  As someone who still plays rock music in bands and would love to hit the big time, I saw a piece of myself and others in my position (people in their 40's and older who still rock out, who know they are at least twice as old as any band that would get signed and likely have any real success in the music business) and saw the Anvil story as a cautionary tale (be careful if you say in your teens ""I'm going to rock out forever, no matter what"" because Lips and Robb took that to the Nth degree, now that they are in their early 50's and still rocking out, albeit without anywhere near the level of success as the other bands I mentioned) but also as a heartwarming story of deep friendship, mutual respect, and love between two friends that, as long as they both live, will keep on going.

I'm not a big fan of Anvil's music - matter of fact I more or less have a similar take on it that George Tsangarides has -- their music, simply put, is not that spectacular.  Ask just about any heavy metal fan and chances are bands such as Metallica, Slayer, Motorhead, Guns 'n Roses, Anthrax are ""up there"" and for good reason - they all have put out outstanding records many of which are revered and thought of as top albums in the metal/hard rock genre (as the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, the Who, Led Zeppelin are considered in the 'classic rock' genre) whereas Anvil might be at best a 2nd, 3rd tier band like Zebra, Y&T, Autograph, Accept, and any number of lesser known bands that just didn't come up with quite as lasting, quality, memorable and respected music.  At least Anvil had the gumption and guts to tell their story, and it is an amazing story - may they rock on forever, record companies and management be damned.",1260662400,,2542,4.305439330543933
3911307,4,B002DLB1IO,"Often promoted as a real-life 'This is Spinal Tap', Anvil: The Story of Anvil documents the struggles of an aging, Canadian heavy metal band. Interviews with famous metal musicians such as Slash, Lars Ulrich and Scott Ian reveal that Anvil was very influential in the early rise of the 80's metal scene. The band never reached the heights of popularity achieved by those that followed them and wallowed in obscurity for 20+ years, releasing over-looked and quickly forgotten albums (interestingly, of the 19 albums listed on their discography, all but 2 have three word titles). Now in their 50's, the band attempts one last grasp at the brass ring, sinking themselves and those around them deep into dept to finance a 13th studio album 'This is Thirteen'. The film follows Anvil on a less-than-impressive tour full of missed trains, double-crossing club owners and audiences numbering in the teens. As far as comparisons to 'Spinal Tap', I feel they are unwarranted. The only similarities I saw were the aging rockers, refusing to 'grow up' and get 'real jobs' and give up their dreams. There's definitely a very juvenile slant to these gentlemen, both in their writing styles (oft-strained double entendres and suburban Satanic symbolism) and in their relationships with each other and with the 'business' part of 'show business'. However, the film is NOT a comedy. It is more of an inspirational portrait of two men who have never, and probably will never, stop rocking.",1260403200,,1473,5.040983606557377
3911308,5,B002DLB1IO,I caught this Film in Theaters over the summer and couldn't wait to buy the DVD ! An inspiring METAL/ROC doc DVD for an music fan . Anvil Inspires !,1260316800,2,148,3.966666666666667
3911309,4,B002DLB1IO,"Everyone in the world has regrets. The only real choice in life is to have most of your regrets be things that you did do, or things that you didn't do. The men in the heavy-metal band Anvil -- the center of the documentary Anvil! The Story of Anvil -- are in the unhappy position of regretting the things that they had no control over, and so aren't sure if they did right or wrong.

Anvil was an up-and-coming band back in the early '80s, just before that big wave of thrash/death/etc. metal really broke with Megadeth and Metallica and so forth. There's a montage of famous metal musicians, early in Anvil!, all talking about how great and groundbreaking Anvil was back then, and how they upped the game for everyone. (One may consider that these men are mostly being polite and charitable, depending on one's opinion of Anvil's music as shown in the movie.)

But Anvil never happened -- maybe because they were from Toronto, maybe because they were always on small labels, maybe because they never had a decent manager, maybe because of bad luck, maybe because their records never sounded as good as they could have, maybe because their songs just weren't good enough, maybe a thousand maybes. But the core of the band -- Steve ""Lips"" Kudlow, the singer and guitarist, and drummer Robb Reiner -- stayed together. At the time this movie was filmed, they were both in their early fifties, and had been playing together since they were both fourteen -- most of that time as Anvil.

The movie is then something like the portrait of a long-term marriage; Kudlow and Reiner have been together longer than most marriages, and have been that close most of that time. Kudlow is more annoyed by the failure of Anvil than Reiner is -- they hew pretty close to the stereotype of hair-trigger frontman and phlegmatic drummer in that. It's not the story of their failure -- they didn't exactly fail, anyway, just didn't succeed in the way that they'd hoped for -- but an examination of what it's like to still be chasing that rock 'n' roll dream in middle age, with wives and kids and tedious day-jobs. Kudlow and Reiner are like the guys in ten thousand bar-bands across the civilized world, except that they saw that brass ring, and got close enough to almost touch it.

Anvil! has all the things a good rock movie needs to have -- the disastrous tour, led by the hard-working but overwhelmed manager; the big fight during the recording of the make-or-break comeback album; the interviews with die-hard fans; the montage of Big Names explaining why we should care about Anvil; vintage footage from when everyone was younger and had all their hair. If we sometimes get the sense that Kudlow in particular has seen too many rock documentaries and VH1 reality shows, and is trying to live the life he thinks he ought to have rather than the life he has, that's only to be expected. This is rock 'n' roll. It has to be bigger than life, or else it's nothing.",1259971200,2,2946,4.605714285714286
3911310,4,B002DLB1IO,"I am not a big fan of thrash metal and I had never heard of Anvil before I saw the trailer for ""The Story of Anvil"" on VH1, but I'm glad I rented it recently. It is a very honest, very touching film. You can tell that the person who made it knows these guys well and has a tremendous amount of love and respect for them.

After watching it, I looked them up on YouTube and couldn't find any professional music videos. I'm wondering if that may not be the main reason why they never made it big.

ETA: I mentioned the DVD to my brother the other day and was surprised to learn that he actually listened to Anvil back in their days. Apparently, ""March of the Crabs"" was THE metal hymn in his circle at the time. I never knew!",1259625600,2,723,4.048951048951049
3911311,5,B002DLB1IO,"I've got to go wait for the limo in the lobby...

Clearly the director knew that this is pure uncut Tappishness, and wisely shied away from all comparisons except for the one shot of the volume going to 11. That they actually went to Stonehenge only drives it home: these guys are as Tap as can be. (But, only one drummer so far!)

I had such a great time watching this, aided by seeing it with the drummer I've played with for the last ten years. And I play guitar and sing. It's a good thing we've never taken ourselves too seriously, as this might have hit too close to home! We howled at points, especially during the bit with the painting of the anvil. I have truly never seen my friend laugh that hard. He was literally rolling on the couch and choking with laughter. I had tears rolling down my face.

They MUST have mentioned Tap during the entire making of this. They HAD TO!! Evvery band I know quotes that thing forever, but these guys live it! Too good.

Still, the real greatness of this movie lies in the friendship of Lips and Robb, and especially in the support of their friends and family---except Robb's fat stupid sister, clearly jealous of whatever success they once had and mad that anyone still cares about him. But to counter her we get Lips' older sister, who is so sweet and loving that I almost cried. Now THAT is what family should be about. A gorgeous moment, now vitiated by Anvil's present success.

Let's face it: what makes this movie so good is that Anvil are not in fact a great band. They are okay, but miles from Metallica or any other truly fine metal band. Reiner makes the group, clearly, and the scene where we only hear Lips' vocals as he cuts a track points out the main reason they've never made it: a mediocre singer with inane lyrics (""Thumb Hang"", about the Inquistion? Calling Nigel Tufnel, please come to the departure gate...).

But the guy is mostly so likeable it's hard to fault him. What this movie is really about is friendship, and the willingness to hold onto a dream long after the expiration date. The bottom line is, these guys can't do anything else, so they keep trying to ""make it"" doing the only thing they could. Metal is a young man's game, but don't tell these guys.

One very interesting note: listen to the dvd extra interview with Lars (where he makes 3 points over and over for 20 minutes). He mentions that what made Anvil big back in the day were the tales of their backstage debauchery, and Lips' dildo (he mentions that repeatedly, kinda hilarious in fact). So why did we never hear of this in the movie? I think becasue we'd be less likely to root for these guys had we known that they'd already had the whole rock and roll dream full-on. Once a lifetime is plenty, no? Don't be greedy! But the director knew that would pull sympathy away from them, so he makes it seem like they never quite had enough fun, and thus deserve it now. Good direction, perhaps, but it makes one wonder about all the other stuff left out.

In any case, avoiding the endless Tap comparisons was wise, as it makes them all the more glaring for real metal fans, and that's what makes this so much fun to watch.

But my hero is Lips' sister. You, madam, are a truly human being.

I guess now we'll see a thousand docs on every half-assed band that never made it but thought they should have. I just hope they're all half this funny.",1259366400,2,3382,4.388178913738019
3911312,5,B002DLB1IO,"Whether you are a fan of heavy metal or not, ANVIL - THE STORY OF ANVIL should be on your 'must see' movie list. The film chronicles the lives of Canadians Steve 'Lips' Kudlow and Robb Reiner, who started a heavy metal band together when they were 14, vowing to 'do it until we're old men'. In the 80's they toured the world with the icons of heavy metal music - many of whom claim them as an influence. But ultimately there was no real audience, fame or payday for ANVIL. Now in their 50's, the film follows them as they make their way, holding down low-paying jobs to pay the bills, all while continuing to churn out poorly produced records and holding on to the dream of becoming rock stars.
Parts of this movie are laughably absurd - most notably the European 'tour' that is pure Spinal Tap with its empty venues, fights, getting lost and showing up late to gigs, and throttling bar owners to get paid. If it wasn't real life it would be hilarious, but it's real and it's heart-breaking. All of this bad luck and trouble falls squarely on the shoulders of Lips and Robbo and tries to pull them apart.
But it is also what makes this film so compelling, because at its heart the story always returns to Lips and Robbo, who continue to believe that the dream is still out there and that there's a chance to get a piece of it. They never stop believing.
This story is all about perseverance and redemption. When that redemption comes, it's brief. But you also can see that for Lips and Robbo it's enough - enough to keep the dream alive for them.
Near the end of the film, as Lips drives from one record label rejection to the next, you hear him say ""The music lasts forever. Maybe the debt does, too, but the music lasts forever"".
That statement captures this story beautifully, as well as the unrelenting optimism of its two subjects.",1259107200,4,1836,4.402941176470589

3911324,5,B002DLB1IO,"I had barely heard of Anvil back in the 80's.  The bands logo refreshed my memory from the record stores or the rock magazines (i.e. Hit Parader, Circus, etc.) back then.

Never heard Anvil's music on Houston, TX rock stations but, then again, the Speed/Thrash Metal bands didn't get much airplay down here back then anyway.  It was always ""word of mouth"" down here that promoted this type of music....even with the Fab Four speed metal bands (i.e. Metallica, Megadeath, Anthrax, & Slayer).

I guess I am 30 years too late but that's ok.  Anvil's spirit kicks ass.  It is their spirit that keeps them going.  It is the bond between Lipps and Rob that is most certainly uncommon in modern times in all relationships accross the board.  Most have just given up after 1 year in the music industry.  Many fade away.  You could say the same for marriages, business, etc..

This band went to the ashes after a rise to what was considered ""the top"" of the metal world with many other bands.  After spending many years in the ashes, Anvil now has risen above the ashes with the help of this documentary and, quite frankly, their name.  A bitter sweet ending.....no, a bitter sweet beginning!

Most documentaries tell a bunch of facts, and if you like the subject and they're okay to watch.  But this movie tells a story, with a beginning, middle and end.  It touches all the emotions and just when you thought things couldn't get worse for the group Anvil, Sascha, the director, figures out a way to make you feel their pain, and then gives you the perfect ending.  This is not a standard documentary, this is a movie, and a very good one.  And one that actually accomplished something.  Since the movie was released, Anvil has finally seen their dreams come true.  Because of the story, and the response to the movie, the group has gotten a record deal, and a US Tour is coming up in 2010, and they recently opened at Giants Stadium in NYC for AC/DC.

As for the DVD itself, I don't often take the time to watch movies while listening to the commentary track.  I want to see the movie.

3911327,5,B002DLB1IO,"Although I do not own the DVD yet, I recall seeing this film at the movie theaters.  At first I thought it might be a spoof film like this is Spinal Tap.  Unfortunately, I recalled the band from an earlier performance shown in the beginning of the film.  I remember discarding them as another bunch of wanna-bes that someone in the universe other than me must really like (King Diamond, Loudness, Kix, (early) Queensryche).  But they were not a band that I thought would never make it altogether.  They had the style and the musicianship to back them up, they just did not have the one break out song they needed to get over the noise festering at the bottom of the pit.

That is why this film came as a complete shock to me.  Anvil has made 13 Albums and are no longer on a decent record label (Major or independent)  In fact they are barely known in their own home country of Canada.  This is where the story takes us to and hopefully beyond.  The lead singer is working delivery hot lunches to either schools or nursing homes and his drummer is basically living off the wealth his parents left him.  They have not had a hit nor a decently recorded album in years.  Their new manager hopes to change all this and place them on an European tour that is disaster in the making.

I do not want to ruin this film for those who have not seen it, but I will state that by the end of the movie, you are hoping this band will find the success they most desperately crave and become true Rock stars.

I found myself rooting for the band members more and more as the movie progressed! The film flows along well; and the cinematography works wonders for the picture. The scenes capture the essence of the band both in their brief heyday as well as those awful, countless times when things don't work out for them. There's a lot of footage about their relationships as well; there is in particular a focus on Steve ""Lips"" Kudlow and his band mate and buddy for life Robb Reiner.

Sure, the band had a hit or two and their music really isn't that bad; but they still weren't strong enough to make a lasting impression on people so they only got their fifteen minutes of fame. They had poor representation more often than not, although things are tough for them especially when Chris Tsangarides, who worked with bands as big as Black Sabbath and Thin Lizzy, can't even make it happen for them. They do get one of their biggest fans, Tiziana Arrigoni, to manage them on a European tour but she's so inexpert and her language barriers are so great that you just know that tour is doomed.

Yet Steve ""Lips"" Kudlow remains optimistic; he comments in the film that if things went badly ""at least there was a tour for them to go wrong on."" His buddy Robb Reiner, the drummer for Anvil, also still shares Steve's hopes and dreams that even after nearly thirty years of disappointments the band might yet make it. And that's remarkable in and of itself--they play to nearly empty stadiums that could have held thousands of people and they play a nightclub in Munich where there are hardly any patrons to perform for--and suffering the indignity that comes with the shocker announcement from the bar owner that he's not paying them--which they learn of only after they've played!

In addition, look for interesting insights and commentary from the family members and wives of ""Lips"" and Robb. There are some mighty good moments there and it all becomes rather poignant; their families want them to succeed and they share Steve's and Robb's frustrations. We also get great footage of Steve working at a catering company where he is well liked although of course he's not truly happy because he's not playing his music; Robb and anyone else playing in the band must also work a relatively boring job to make ends meet.

The DVD comes with extras. There are deleted scenes including interviews with two former band members; an optional audio commentary with Steve ""Lips"" Kudlow, Robb Reiner and director Sacha Gervasi; an interview with Lars Ulrich of Metallica; and an extra entitled ""'School Love' in Japan with Sacha."" They're all quite good.

Anvil: The Story of Anvil explores the history of the band and lets us meet the leaders of the band as well as some others with the band and a couple of men who left the band after several years. By the time the film is over you'll be rooting for these guys to finally hit it big; we see a very human side of them and their ache for fame and fortune is something many people will identify with. I recommend this film for people who are interested in heavy metal music as well as bands like Anvil that inspired other major bands including Metallica, Slayer, and Anthrax. In addition, anyone interested in the pathos that can result when people's dreams are not being realized will find this film quite intriguing.",1256169600,4,3524,4.67741935483871

Everyone likes to root for an ""underdog"", but the underdog has to at least have a little bit of talent and a genuine reason why they should succeed.  Why has Anvil struggled for 25 years trying to make it?  Because they aren't any good.  Their playing is mediocre at best and their songs are lame and amateurish.  There are a thousand highschool garage bands who are just as good as these guys.

At least Spinal Tap's songs were clever and well done.",1256169600,11,564,4.157407407407407
3911355,5,B002DLB1IO,"I LOVED this documentary!  There, I said it!

I'm not a metal fan. I had never even heard of Anvil.  But still, now ... I want to buy thier CDs just to support them!

It was completely unexpected that these two regular guys, with a terrific bro-mance, making music together for 30 years would have been so inspirational.  That's what makes this film so great though. They are just regular guys, making their way with a big dream. Who hasn;t wanted to live thier dream?  No one fell down a hole, or had some tragic thing happen that opened thier eyes to suddenly believe in a cause.  They just believe in themselves and they give it all they've got!

Lips was so happy, enthusiastic and motivated.  He keeps you smiling right along with him!  He stays positive and optimistic even when the chips are down.  It is easy to hear their talent, even if you don't care for the genre of music.  It is a shame, they haven't hit the level of success they've hoped for because they sound great! The music just isn't as relevant as it once was.  How can you not cheer for a guy who with his head in his hands and circles under his eyes, struggles as an employee of one of his fan's seemingly questionable tele-sales center's, because he says he was raised to be a nice, honest person and that the job was just too hard for him?

3911356,5,B002DLB1IO,"As a metal head and documentary fanatic, I was worried that this movie would never live up to the ""hype"". I stand corrected. I was a teenager in the 80's and hung with many of the metal bands of the day. I had the chance to see Anvil, and loved the music and the show they put on (which was later copied by many of their contemporaries). I didn't keep up with them over the years, but in all fairness they were hardly a household name.

Now for the movie review...The direction of the movie was superb. You get a real sense that the band members have a genuine love for both the music and each other, despite the odds of crappy management and languishing in virtual obscurity for over 20 years working against them. In Lips, I found myself amazed by his tenacity, cock-eyed optimism, and love for his music and friends. The scene between he and Robb where he says he could ""jump off a bridge, but that would be the easy way out"" and Robb's subsequent reply made me tear up.

The most pleasant suprise is that AC/DC, who were NOT in any of the promos for the movie (hint..hint..Slash & Lemmy)actually took Anvil out on tour with them this summer. Its one thing to say ""what a great band, what ever happened to them?"" and another to put your money where your mouth is and give them a gig!

Whether you're a metal fan or not, this is a great movie that just may renew some of your faith in the human race. I'd like Lips to know that I am trying to use a little of his optimism in my own life!!!

Great luck to you guys!!!",1255737600,7,1518,4.188356164383562

My only Anvil purchase was Forged in Fire and frankly, I didn't care for it a lot. I never bought another Anvil album. After watching this documentary, which I did purchase, I want to buy all of them. I won't go into detail about the movie but will say this: it is a must-see.

Rock and Roll is a tough life. Many, many bands don't make it. Many bands don't even make a record and settle for doing covers in a smoky bar. Anvil has made 13. Was Anvil a success? Hell yeah. As successful as Metallica? Hell no. I have new found respect for Lips and Robb and have nothing but respect for their families, the ones who stood by them during their journey. Cheers to all of you.

Both Lips and Robb are good people, the kind of guys you would like to hang out with and have a few drinks. I wish you both all the best. Congratulations on a great career and a great documentary. I hope you make a little money off of this.",1255478400,3,1181,4.038461538461538

3911361,4,B002DLB1IO,"I saw this in the theatre. Its a great flick. Honest, sometimes funny and sometimes downright sad. It is cool to see a real movie about a real band like this. God knows there are thousands of bands still sticking it out and trying to just get by making music that they love. This is one of those stories. A real doc about 2 great friends who refuse to totally throw away their dream. I really enjoyed this movie and my biggest complaint is that there was no real eclipse to the ending even though they got to play in front of a lot of people. The real point of this film is to see the relationship between these 2 best friends. I really enjoyed that aspect of this and I will watch it repeatedly because of it.

4 stars is for the ending and the actual music. Listen, I have known of Anvil since I was a teen. Their music never was the greatest and I believe this is the real reason they didn't make it. Sure, it was fun and had some energy back in the early 80's, but the reason they didn't get further, IMO, is the fact that they were hard to take seriously. Lyrically they were challenged at best! lol.. They had no real label to back them and they didn't evolve as other bands did. Maybe a great producer and a real mix would have gotten them further way back when, but because of the corny lyrics, I believe they were seen as more of a novelty act. There are so many metal bands out there that its hard to see them as more than a very good garage band.

That said, this is still a great film to see the behind the scenes BS that many bands face. Especially a band that has been around for 25 years and never quite made a name for themselves. These guys are just a couple of real, nice guys. Its hard not to root for them, and you will find yourself rooting for them when you watch this. The scenes with them meeting some of their heroes is sad and funny. Especially the look on Michael Schenkers face! Priceless.

Get this if you like Rock n Roll Doc's. This is one of the best and the people are real. Doubt they will gain a ton of fans of their music because it truly is a niche audience they cater too. But at least they got to make a statement in the end. It really is a cool flick and I admire the director for following his heart in making this. Good luck Lips and Rob! They really have shown in this film that living your dream is most important, regardless of the size of the audience.",1255046400,4,2398,4.097872340425532

Seeing that the band still have the same passion as well as the desire to make it to the big time is inspiring. I could write a hundred great things about what I love about this movie, but the thing I think the movie fails to do is really dive into the reason they initially lost their momentum early on. The movie should have mentioned that in 1984, their 4th album was a compilation that featured a few new songs, which was hardly a good move for them. Then, they had a three year absence before coming out with ""Strength of Steel"" in 1987. Three years out of the public eye was disastrous for them. By the time they released the outstanding ""Pound for Pound"" in 1988, most metal fans moved on to something else and Anvil drifted into obscurity. Most will say the point of the movie isn't about that and I agree, but a movie called ""The Story of Anvil"" shouldn't leave out vital information like that because anyone can tell that these factors probably played into it. I see they have a book out too, so I'll have to read this to see if they touch on this subject there. I still give the DVD five stars because it's an incredible movie and is extremely brave in the approach. It deserves a 6th star for Lars Ulrich's incredible interview in the DVD extras.

This movie has antecedents, and they are the two movies listed above.

3911382,5,B002DLB1IO,"The Story of Anvil is a Rock 'n' Roll cautionary tale for those of us living out our Rock 'n' Roll dreams. You can be an innovative band, have the respect of your peers, and have the same access to fans but still not make it into big time Rock 'n' Roll. The story of Anvil is also a story of hope, friendship and following your artistic vision to create something that not only do you like but will be there after you're gone.

Anvil is a Heavy Metal band created by childhood friends Steve ""Lips"" Kudlow and drummer Robb Reiner. They've been together as a band for almost 30 years and while bassists have come and gone they still share a dream to make it to the big time. Their belief in themselves isn't unrealistic, as proved by interviews by such Heavy Metal luminaries as Lars Ullrich, Lemmy (from Motorhead), and Slash attest to. They credit Anvil with being Heavy Metal innovators not only in their music such as songs like Metal On Metal, which Ullrich says other bands used and borrowed without ever looking back, but in stage appearance such as Lips early penchant for wearing bondage outfits onstage, and using dildos as a guitar slide.

There is a pathos present too. As the band embarks on a European tour that was managed by an amateur promoter, they played bars where the band almost out number the patrons, or a bar owner that tries to rip them off. There's also the family and friends who are shown and they understand and support the dreams and ambitions of Reiner and Kudlow. A sister of Kudlow going so far as to front money for Anvil to record with Heavy Metal producer Chris Tsangarides (Black Sabbath, Thin Lizzy).

Why didn't Anvil make it? The movie isn't about that, although, Lips and Robb wrestle with it a little. Lips seems to think it's because in 25 years of Rock `n' Roll they never had good management. Another reason that might explain why they didn't make it goes uncommented on by either the filmmaker or the band themselves. It may be the reason they didn't rise in the Rock `n' Roll world is the band members themselves. During a recording session, which they shelled out 13,000 pounds to producer Chris Tsangarides and for reasons not clear at first, Lips blows up at Reiner and even goes so far as to say Reiner is ""fired."" After an impromptu therapy session run by Tsangarides, Lips and Reiner make up. How much of this played into their not making it to the big time? The movie doesn't delve into that aspect at all, and keeps the focus on their struggles of the present.

Some reviewers and critics argue that Anvil just wasn't as good as other bands they were contemporaries with, such as The Scorpions, Bon Jovi, Metallica. I'm not much of an expert on Heavy Metal but both in the vintage footage of them playing in Japan and in hearing songs off their new album This Is Thirteen they sound as good as any other band in the oeuvre. Their music has moments where the music has something of interest, but my only complaint is the same I have for any other Heavy/Speed Metal band, is they blow past those moments too fast looking for the next interesting phrase.

The movie seems to elicit Spinal Tap comparisons. Maybe it's because the format resembles Spinal Tap so much. We can't leave out the coincidence that the drummer and founding member of Anvil is Robb Reiner. But there are some Spinal Tap moments in the movie such as when the band is recording and the producer turns up a volume control that you quite clearly can see goes to 11! There is also Reiner's painting of a giant anvil in the middle of a park. Other paintings of his are quite good, reminiscent of Edward Hooper. There are moments the band itself seems cognizant of being like Spinal Tap, such as when the band is being lead to the stage and Lips is delivering a monologue about them being lost backstage.

One question I asked myself while watching this movie is, it's very cool to have all those heavy hitting, heavy metal rockers saying how cool and innovative Anvil is, but couldn't they ask Anvil to open for them? That might get them the exposure they need. Hopefully, this film will bring Anvil a larger audience.",1254614400,31,4136,4.515353805073431

One of my ongoing fascinations spinoffs from addictive record collecting (thank the Almighty for thrift shops!) is researching the fringe carnival barker 4th tier show business characters (""ex-rockers"") who grind out a living raging against evil rock music in small churches, with slide shows, laying out folding tables full of fringe fundie Christian DVDs (er, VHS) eyeball punishing documentaries, and lots and lots of things that look like books, calling upon teenagers and their panicking parents to renounce the ""rock lifestyle.""  Frankly, THE STORY OF ANVIL here and a 1987 film about Los Angeles 3rd-rate ""hair bands,"" THE DECLINE OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION, THE METAL YEARS, would be far, far more effective discouraging guitar slinger get rich wannabees than HELLS BELLS.  Taking a close look at ...ANVIL, the Toronto band's 1982-84 experience seems very much like a Los Angeles heavy metal defunct band, Odin, featured in THE DECLINE OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION, THE METAL YEARS.

Most eye-opening moments in THE STORY OF ANVIL center around the minivan trunk marketing shots of Lips loading up boxes of vanity private press THIS IS THIRTEEN albums (cardboard crates of maybe 1000-1500 CDs?), attempting to get the last ditch record deal locally at EMI, and the end credits' followup stating that Anvil got paid off by the Czech bar owner for 100 Euros (about $130 bucks?) after the gig and yelling match being paid in noodles.

8365312,5,B002DLB1IO,"Released in 2009  and directed by Sacha Gervasi, Anvil: The Story of Anvil is a documentary chronicling the Toronto metal band Anvil, focusing on the friendship and aspirations of the two main band members, singer/guitarist Steve Lips Kudlow and drummer Robb Reiner.

The band formed in the late 70s as Lips, but changed their name to Anvil upon obtaining a record deal in 1981. The mid-80s were a good time for the young band and they were expected to go on to great success, but it was not to be. Guitarist Dave Allison left the band in 1989 followed by bassist Ian Dickson in 1993. But Steve & Robb soldiered on with new members, releasing album after album up to the present (16 studio albums altogether, as of this writing). When the film was shot, Ivan Hurd was the second guitarist with Glenn ""Glenn Five"" Gyorffy on bass. Both are featured in the movie while original members Allison and Dickson are featured in the deleted scenes on the DVD (their scenes shouldnt have been cut IMHO).

This is a great inspirational documentary whether you like Anvil and metal/hard rock or not. I really like the band, but never heard their stuff until 2009 when I rented the 1988 movie Sleepaway Camp II: Unhappy Campers, which features two songs from Anvils 1987 album STRENGTH OF STEEL, the catchy ""Straight Between the Eyes"" and ""Wild Eyes."" One critic claimed that their 1982 album METAL ON METAL was their best-selling recording, but thats simply not true, STRENGTH OF STEEL was; and, although its maligned by some fans, its easily one of their top albums and not too commercial, as some erroneously contend (check out songs like Concrete Jungle, Paper General, Kiss of Death and the aforementioned Straight Between the Eyes).

Anvil were just as good in their own unique way as any of the so-called Big Four, Metallica, Anthrax, Slayer and Megadeth. If you don't believe me, check out their top albums, like WORTH THE WEIGHT (the album being recorded in the movie, THIS IS THIRTEEN, is actually NOT one of their better recordings, song-wise, nor is the follow-up JUGGERNAUT OF JUSTICE). So why didn't Anvil AT LEAST attain the success of the secondary bands of the Big Four (i.e. Megadeth and Slayer)? Cheap production of their 80s albums may be one reason, although the production wasn't THAT bad for the era and certainly listenable; it was superior, for instance, to the production of albums by the contemporary Venom. Perhaps their location had something to do with their inability to reach the next level, but then how did Rush (another Toronto-based band) become so successful? (Then again, Rush switched from prog metal/rock to pop rock in the 80s). Bad management is likely another possibility. The reason is probably a combination of factors, including the bands sense of humor, Lips outrageous antics and their sometimes goofy or juvenile lyrics (e.g. Straight Between the Eyes).

In any case, this is a great documentary on the travails of trying to make it in a struggling rock/metal band. Their European tour shows that the lifestyle is difficult and takes dedication, to say the least: They miss trains, arrive late at a club in Prague because they were lost, play before small non-crowds, don't get paid and are offered goulash as a substitute. At a festival in Transylvania with a 10,000-seat capacity only 174 people show up. While there are certainly some high points on their tour its mostly terrible. Steve, ever the optimist, responds, ""Everything on the tour went drastically wrong. But at least there was a tour for it to go wrong on.""

I know of a local struggling metal band, by the way, thats currently touring Europe and Im sure they're facing the exact same kinds of challenges.

Anvils family members are loyal, but think maybe they should throw in the towel. Yet Steve & Robb march forward in faith. A famous producer decides to produce their next album THIS IS THIRTEEN (2007), but its going to cost thousands of dollars. Where are they going to get the money? And how are they going to release the album without a record contract? A Japanese promoter shows interest in having them play at a festival, but will more than a handful of fans show up?

Then you have Steve and Robbs great friendship, which is seriously tested at times, like during the stress of recording their new album in England: Tempers flare, one quits in frustration and the other apologizes. Will they stay together?

Anvil: The Story of Anvil is an entertaining lesson on faith in ones calling, perseverance, friendship, teamwork, glory/humility and the nature of true success.

The film doesnt wear out its welcome at 80 minutes.
