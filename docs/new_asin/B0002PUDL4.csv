8030251,4,B0002PUDL4,"I am an avid everglades fisherman in the backcountry so I have a lot of respect for anyone that can actually live there and make a living. The DVD shows the life of Totch Brown and how he chose to live in the everglades, raise a family and make a living. He said that he would rather live with the mosquitoes than put up with traffic in the city.

I recommend this DVD for anyone interested in pioneer men and living free!

I am would give this movie 5 stars except I am hard of hearing and the DVD does not offer closed captioned so I am sure I missed some of the dialogue.

Thank you",1126051200,4,585,4.025862068965517
