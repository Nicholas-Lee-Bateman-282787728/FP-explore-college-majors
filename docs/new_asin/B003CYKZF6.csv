8394566,1,B003CYKZF6,I rented it because it had a 4 star review - what a lie! It will go down in history for being one of the absolute worst movie I have ever tried to watch! I couldn't even finish it!,1370476800,,180,3.641025641025641
8394567,5,B003CYKZF6,"I loved this movie!  Eraserhead meets The Forbidden Zone with a touch of John Waters-esque humor.  The music is wonderful and gives all the dark imagry a fun, jaunty, silly feel.  I am eager to see more Chris Miller films after seeing this one.",1333152000,2,244,4.5

8394569,5,B003CYKZF6,"This movie is an instant cult classic!  Tits, gore, and special effects galore!  It made me ponder the meaning of life all while I was laughing my ass off.  The film has everything you could possibly want.  My only complaint is that it wasn't LONG ENOUGH!  I WANT MOOOOORE!!!!!!",1269734400,2,278,4.591836734693878
8394570,5,B003CYKZF6,"Ironhorse is an instant classic. This film is an obscure tale of two artists and one mad scientist who is hell-bent on utilizing his evil potion to bring inanimate objects to life.

  This potpourri of mixed media is not for the faint of heart, the gruesome kill scenes are both entertaining as well as a stroke of brilliant innovation by Director Chris J. Miller. The musical score which features Bagpipe Requiem by the talented Eric Lutes is both maddening and clever. These musical compositions paired with the seemingly drunken perceptions and surrealistic imagery is nothing short of captivating. Lydia Blaisdell-Miller lends her angelic voice to the score as Cynthia with her naturally poetic performance. This film offers a wide array of characters all colorful, peculiar and often...murderous, each haunted by their own personal demons. It is more than an artsy indie flick, it is uniquely haunting and absurd, but not without depth.

Ironhorse is an imaginative and maniacal dance of psychedelic gore and macabre.",1269475200,2,1022,5.213414634146342
