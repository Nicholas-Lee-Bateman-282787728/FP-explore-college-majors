5635628,5,B00BK8E4D0,my son loves it so much that I already know certain parts word for word and has his map where ever we go.,1371427200,3,105,3.608695652173913
5635629,4,B00BK8E4D0,"I purchased this Mickey Mouse Clubhouse the week of release, as a reward for my kiddo.  He loves all the episodes, especially the title one with ""Kansas City Mickey"".  Super fun episodes, very interactive, and there are 5 total MMC shows.

The reason why I deducted one star is a combination of the higher price, content, and lack of extras. This dvd is really bare bones (no dvd sleeve, not even any special features) and shouldn't be priced for more than ten dollars, especially considering there was no coupon or rebate offered. The episodes themselves are very ""boy centric,"" focusing on the male characters and their adventures (Disney has been releasing more and more 'girl' and 'boy' specific dvds lately...). And lastly, to the great disappointment of my preschooler, the dvd does NOT include the treasure map and stickers that were advertised on the commercial and dvd webpage. We went to two different big box stores as well as looked here on Amazon and NONE of them had the packaging with the ""bonus"".

Good kid-friendly episodes on this dvd, but definitely NOT the best Disney Junior dvd out there...",1369958400,2,1112,4.867724867724868
5635630,5,B00BK8E4D0,"When Pete steals the Crystal Mickey statue from The Clubhouse, Mickey and friends and your preschooler must go on an adventure through a lot of hard places to get the Crystal back.  Otherwise the Clubhouse disappears.  The adventure is full of Pete's traps.  This movie is fun.  Your preschooler also uses The Mousketools, and will laugh because of the thrills, fun, and surprises.  This DVD has 4 additional episodes for even more fun.  Recommend this interactive, learning DVD for all preschoolers.",1369699200,,500,5.111111111111111
5635631,4,B00BK8E4D0,"The nicest thing about the new ""Quest for the Crystal Mickey"" DVD collection of episodes from ""Mickey Mouse Clubhouse"" is that Disney fans might notice a little nod to Walt himself.

I won't give it away, but I will give a clue that it has something to do with Walt's early career and Mickey's name in the signature episode.

""Mickey Mouse Clubhouse"" is a preschooler CG series along the lines of ""Blue's Clues"" and ""Dora the Explorer."" Regular cast Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Daisy and Pluto share a basic storyline with visits from other Disney favorites like Ludwig Von Drake, Chip 'n Dale, Clarabelle Cow and Pete, who serves as a villain or just a misguided soul.

""The Quest for the Crystal Mickey"" epsode boasts probably the most intricate of all the plots, but that's okay since kids love the repetition and parents can catch the mild in-jokes (it's not quite as edgy as Sesame Street).

A friendly gadget called Toodles provides objects in each episode that help solve the problem. There's always a mystery tool that is revealed near the end. Kids can follow Mickey and the gang and help them figure things out, also doing some counting, colors, shapes, concepts and things like that.

One of two original songs highlight each episode. There's also a nice soundtrack album on CD or download on amazon and iTunes.

Some may find this a watered-down version of Mickey, but it's a great way for very young children to get to know the characters on an everyday TV basis rather than waiting for the occasional cartoon (as it was in my day).

Mickey Mouse should mean more to kids than just being a corporate icon and theme park greeter. For a long time, that's pretty much what he was, though that's okay for some. Children saw him in merchandise and his basic shape clearly appeals to them. But I like that kids are relating to him as a character, he same way they do to other preschool TV characters.

5635633,5,B00BK8E4D0,"While my boys are starting to watch the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse show less and less as they get older, this DVD got them hooked again.  They recently watched some of Indiana Jones and have been obsessed with him.  Having Mickey be an adventurer like Indiana Jones was so cool to them.  I thought the episode was super cute and didn't mind watching it.  It did feel though like a movie and was a refreshing episode to watch.  Now in case your wondering, this DVD features episodes of the show, not a whole movie.

Quest for the Crystal Mickey
Donald of the Desert
Donald the Genie
Goofy's Coconutty Monkey
Goofy's Giant Adventure

The ""Quest for the Crystal Mickey"" is just one episode on the DVD, along with four others.  They are all episodes that your child may have seen on tv already but I love how they are all on one DVD.  It is nice to be able to put on this wholesome show whenever your child wants it.  Honestly we have a few other Mickey Mouse Clubhouse DVDs and this is my favorite because of the Quest for the Crystal Mickey episode.  It is just such a fun episode full of the gang going on an adventurer against sneaky Pete.  Very cute and age appropriate for preschoolers.

I received this DVD to review in exchange for my honest opinion.",1369267200,,1250,4.406113537117904
5635634,5,B00BK8E4D0,"My kids have been anticipating Mickey Mouse Clubhouse: The Quest for Crystal Mickey for a long time so we were really excited to get this one! Mickey Mouse Clubhouse is a favorite in our house, as it is among most toddlers in America!

Quest for the Crystal Mickey is much more adventurous than most episodes and my kids really enjoyed that aspect of it. So did I! It felt more like a movie than a regular episode.

Even though my kids understand that this is just a show and it isn't real, my three year old still gets concerned about things. She was very worried that the Clubhouse would disappear forever and she would be sad! Even though it wasn't scary, just the idea had her worried so I watched it with her every time.

I love that Mickey Mouse Clubhouse encourages imagination and creativity, even if it gets their imagination working a little too much sometimes! It's better than the alternative and opens the door to discussions about what is real and what isn't and comparing it to things that happen in real life.

I'm so happy we have Mickey Mouse Clubhouse: The Quest for Crystal Mickey on DVD so my kids can enjoy it anytime they want. It's perfect for the Mickey Mouse lover in your house!",1368921600,,1205,4.488584474885845
5635635,5,B00BK8E4D0,"My girls (ages 3 and 6) love Mickey Mouse Clubhouse and we have a ton of the episodes on our DVR, including all of the episodes from this DVD. The show is great and a big hit in our house. It always has a positive message and teaches kids about a variety of subjects through the gang's adventures and interaction with your child. This particular episode has been very popular in our house since it came out this year.  My 3 year old is always asking for ""Crystal Mickey"".

Quest for the Crystal Mickey is a fun episode about the gang searching for a magical statue in order to save the Clubhouse.  They go on an adventure through jungles and over rivers, all while avoiding that pesky Pete's traps.  It has a very ""Indiana Jones"" feel to the episode which is fun for parents too.

This DVD contains the main title episode plus four great bonus episodes. Amazon doesn't always do a good job on their DVD episode listings so here are the episodes that are included on this DVD:
1. Quest for the Crystal Mickey
2. Donald of the Desert - Donald and the gang go to the desert to get sand for the clubhouse sandbox.
3. Donald the Genie - Donald becomes a genie and grants a wish to each friend.
4. Goofy's Coconutty Monkey - The gang searches for coconuts with Coco the Monkey.
5. Goofy's Giant Adventure - Goofy searches for a special elixir to cure Willie the Giant's upset tummy.

We use cartoon DVDs for car trips and these popular episodes are perfect for our collection. Highly Recommended!",1368662400,24,1490,4.43956043956044
