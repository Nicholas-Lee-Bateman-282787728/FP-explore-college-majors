The camera work is horrid when indoors. The lighting needs work. The voice over does nothing more than trash the historical aristocracy The title says, "" Global Treasures"". The producers treated it like a drive by desecration.

I would have liked more information about the Palace rooms and the specific rooms shown and art contained. For example:  The bedroom of Marie Antoinette  just passed by (quickly) without identification. I am thankful that I did not buy this. And the other reviewers are correct it is not even the 11 minutes advertised. That information should be more prominent.

You would actually do better to watch Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette to get a better glimpse of Versailles if you are looking for one as the movie was filmed on location.

Very Very Disappointing.
